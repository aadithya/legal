Creations owned by defendant No. 2 is carrying on the
business of advertising and marketing.

Plaintiff had

business dealings with the defendants for the purpose of
publication of various advertisements in the newspapers
and

published

by

the

plaintiff.

These

advertisements were published from time to time under the
instructions of the defendants as per various job orders
issued between September 2002 to October 2002 to the
entire satisfaction of the defendants.

Against these orders

on completion of work, plaintiff raised 64 bills for a total
sum of Rs. 30,07,157.93/-. Defendants failed to make the
payment of this amount which is shown as outstanding
amount in the accounts of the defendants as per the
statement of account placed on record with the plaint.
Plaintiff also claimed a sum of Rs. 5,70,334/- as interest on
the said amount @ 24% per annum upto October, 2003.
Defendants failed to make the payment of the amount
despite service of legal notice dated 14.10.2003.

Hence

the present suit.

2. Summons for appearance were duly served upon the
defendants by way of publication in Times of India as well

as by way of affixation at the last known addresses.
Process was also

served by way of display on the Court

Notice Board on filing of PF as the defendants could not be
served by ordinary means. This publication was effected in
Times of India dated 15.9.2006. However, despite service
the defendants failed to file their memo of appearance as
required under Order 37 Rule 2, sub Rule 3.

3. Since defendants have defaulted in entering appearance as
required under the law, the allegations in the plaint are
deemed to be admitted by the defendants and the plaintiff
is entitled to a decree as prayed for. Accordingly, I hereby
pass a decree for Rs. 35,77,491.93/- with cost of the suit in
favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants. Plaintiff
is further awarded interest pendente lite and future
interest @ 12% per annum on the principal amount of
Rs.30,07,157.93/- from the date of the filing of the suit till
