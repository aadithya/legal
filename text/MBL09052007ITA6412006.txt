MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
The Revenue is aggrieved by an order dated 28th October,
2005 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench B (for
short the Tribunal) in ITA Nos.328D/98, 1783/D/99 and 916/D/2000
relevant for the assessment years 1994-95 to 1996-97.

2.

Although three issues arose before the Tribunal, we are really

concerned with two issues that have been urged by the Revenue.

3.

The assessee is a 100% subsidiary of Oracle Corporation,

USA and was incorporated with the object of developing, designing,
improving, producing, marketing, distributing, buying, selling and

ITA No.641/2006

Page 3 of 9

importing of computer software. The assessee is entitled to sub-license
the software developed by Oracle Corporation, USA to its local clients.

4.

The assessee imports master copies of the software from

Oracle Corporation, USA. These are then duplicated on blank discs,
packed and sold in the market along with the relevant brochures and
information by way of a sub-license. The assessee pays a lump sum
amount to Oracle Corporation, USA for the import of the master copy
and in addition thereto it also pays royalty at 30% of the list price of the
licensed product.

5.

The first issue that we are concerned with is the disallowance

of royalty paid by the assessee to Oracle Corporation, USA on the
ground that TDS was not paid by the assessee in the relevant previous
year; the second issue relates to the allowability of a deduction under
Section 80IA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act).

6.

The issue regarding disallowance of royalty is relevant for

the assessment years 1994-95 and 1995-96.

ITA No.641/2006

The Assessing Officer

Page 4 of 9

noted that for the assessment year 1994-95, tax was deducted at source
on the royalty paid by the assessee and after deduction, it was deposited
on 6th September, 1994. For the assessment year 1995-96, tax was
deducted at source and deposited on 6th July, 1995. The Assessing
Officer took the view that in view of Section 40(a)(i) of the Act, the
assessee was not entitled to a deduction in respect of payment of royalty
to Oracle Corporation, USA. This provision reads as under:“40. Amounts not deductible. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in sections 30 to 38, the following amounts shall
not be deducted in computing the income chargeable under
the head “Profits and gains of business or profession”, –
(a) in the case of any assessee –
(i) any interest (not being interest on a loan issued for public
subscription before the 1st day of April, 1938), royalty, fees
for technical services or other sum chargeable under this Act,
which is payable outside India, on which tax has not been
paid or deducted under Chapter XVII-B.
Provided that where in respect of any such sum, tax has been
paid or deducted under Chapter XVII-B in any subsequent
year, such sum shall be allowed as a deduction in computing
the income of the previous year in which such tax has been
paid or deducted.”
The interpretation given by the Assessing Officer to the
above provision was that tax must not only be deducted but also actually
paid within the relevant previous year.

7.

Feeling aggrieved, the assessee filed an appeal before the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [CIT (A)] who relied upon a
decision of the Rajasthan High Court in Additional Commissioner of
Income-Tax v. Farasol Ltd., (1987) 163 ITR 364 for deciding in favour
of the assessee.

8.

We do not think the decision rendered by the Rajasthan High

Court is quite apposite. However, in so far as we are concerned, the
Tribunal noted that there is no dispute that the assessee deducted the tax
during the relevant year. The Assessing Officer made the disallowance
only on the ground that payment was actually made in the next financial
year. On a plain reading of Section 40 (a)(i) of the Act, as long as the
tax was deducted within the year, as was done in the present case, the
provisions of the Section come into play and the assessee must,
therefore, be entitled to its benefit. There is no dispute about the fact
that tax for the assessment year 1994-95 was deducted during the
relevant previous year (but paid on 6th September, 1994). For the
assessment year 1995-96 the tax was deducted during the relevant
previous year and while most of the amount (Rs.1,97,23,418/-) was paid

ITA No.641/2006

Page 6 of 9

during the relevant previous year, a small amount of Rs.11,011/- was
deposited on 6th July, 1995. On a reading of Section 40(a)(i) of the Act,
we are of the view that the Assessing Officer erred while the appellate
authorities rightly held in favour of the assessee.

No substantial

question of law arises for consideration.

9.

As regards the second issue pertaining to Section 80IA of the

Act, the question that arose was whether the assessee manufactures any
goods.

10.

As noted above, the assessee duplicates the software from the

imported master copies by formatting a blank disc and copying the
software onto it. The duly formatted disc with the software is then
packed and sold in the market along with the relevant brochures.
According to the Assessing Officer, this did not amount to manufacture
and this view was affirmed by the CIT (A).

11.

The Tribunal made a note that in fact the assessee converted

blank discs (which are raw material for it) into software loaded discs

ITA No.641/2006

Page 7 of 9

with the help of the imported master copy. This by itself amounted to a
change or a conversion of the blank disc into a different and distinct
commercial product which was then marketed after labelling and
packing.

12.

The Tribunal took into consideration the decision of the

Supreme Court in Gramophone Co. of India Ltd. v. Collector of
Customs, 1999 (114) ELT 770 wherein the Supreme Court considered
the meaning of the word “manufacture” as used in the Central Excise
Act, 1944. The Supreme Court noted that pre-recorded audio cassettes
are known in the market as goods different and distinct from blank
audio cassettes. The two have different uses and since the appellant
therein was converting blank audio cassettes into recorded audio
cassettes which were sold in the market as such, it was carrying out a
manufacturing activity.

13.

It is true that the meaning of the word “manufacture” as used

in the Central Excise Act, 1944 cannot be automatically applied to the
provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, but in the absence of any

ITA No.641/2006

Page 8 of 9

definition of the word “manufacture” as used in Section 80IA of the Act,
one has to appreciate its meaning as commonly understood by any
reasonable person. Looked at from this point of view, the conversion of
a blank disc, which has its own utility, to a software loaded disc clearly
amounts to a manufacturing activity because a new commercial product
enters the market which is distinct and different product from the blank
disc.

14.

On this issue, we see no reason to differ with the view taken

by the Tribunal which merely follows the decision of the Supreme
Court. Under the circumstances, we are clearly of the view that the
assessee would be entitled to the benefit of Section 80IA of the Act
since it carries out a manufacturing activity.

15.

No substantial question of law arises for consideration. The

appeals are dismissed.
