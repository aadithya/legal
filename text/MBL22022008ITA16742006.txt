MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
The Revenue is aggrieved by an order dated 1st February,
2006 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench „F‟ in

ITA No.1674/2006

ITA No. 4803/Del/2002 relevant for the Assessment Year 1989-90.
2.

The case has rather a chequered history beginning with the

assessment order dated 18th March, 1991 passed by the Assessing
Officer under Section 143(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short the
Act).
3.

It appears that the assessment order did not contain the

computation of income under Section 115-J of the Act. The Assessee
had computed a loss at Rs.46,65,746/- while determining the book
profit for the purposes of Section 115-J of the Act but while arriving at
this figure, the Assessee brought forward depreciation or loss that was
wrongly calculated.
4.

The Commissioner of Income Tax was of the view that the

order passed by the Assessing Officer was prejudicial to the interest of
the Revenue and accordingly issued a notice to the Assessee under
Section 263 of the Act on 29th November, 1991 to show cause why the
assessment be not set aside and the profit correctly computed under
Section 115-J of the Act.
5.

After hearing the Assessee, the Commissioner gave the

following direction in her order passed under Section 263 of the Act on
15th January, 1992: -

ITA No.1674/2006

Page 2 of 8

“On the facts of the case, as the assessment framed is
erroneous, in so far as it is prejudicial to the interest of
revenue, the same is cancelled on the limited issue with
the direction that the assessing officer should computer
profit under s. 115J as per provisions of the Act and before
doing so, adequate opportunity should be allowed to the
assessee. For this specific purpose, the assessment stands
set-aside.”
6.

When the matter was then taken up by the Assessing

Officer, the Assessee contended that for the purposes of Section 115-J of
the Act the book profit has to be computed on charging depreciation as
prescribed under Section 350 of the Companies Act, 1956.

This

contention was rejected by the Assessing Officer in his order dated 16th
March, 1992.
7.

Another issue that came up for consideration before the

Assessing Officer, at the instance of the Assessee, was on the
allowability of an expenditure of Rs.41,14,955/-.

According to the

Assessee, the claim for this expenditure was made in the subsequent
assessment year, that is, 1990-91 but in the assessment order for that
year, the Assessing Officer held that the expenditure could not be
allowed in the assessment year 1990-91, since it related to an earlier
year. In view of this, the Assessee contended that the expenditure of
Rs.41,14,955/- be allowed to the Assessee in the assessment year 1989-

ITA No.1674/2006

Page 3 of 8

90 (the year under consideration).
8.

The Assessing Officer rejected this contention of the

Assessee on the ground that the order passed by the Commissioner
under Section 263 of the Act on 15th January, 1992 was on the limited
issue of computing the profit under Section 115-J of the Act and,
therefore, it was not possible for him to look into the issue raised by the
Assessee.
9.

The consequence of the assessment order passed on 16th

March, 1992 read with the assessment order for the assessment year
1990-91 was that the Assessee was not entitled to claim the expenditure
of Rs.41,14,955/- in the assessment year 1990-91, nor could it claim that
expenditure in the assessment year 1989-90.
10.

Feeling aggrieved by this decision, the Assessee preferred

an appeal which was heard and disposed of by the Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) [CIT(A)] by an order dated 31st January, 1995.
The CIT (A) dismissed the appeal of the Assessee without considering
the allowability of the expenditure claimed by way of a deduction for
the assessment year 1989-90.
11.

The Assessee then preferred a second appeal to the Income

Tax Appellate Tribunal (for short the Tribunal) and by an order dated

ITA No.1674/2006

Page 4 of 8

27th December, 200, the Tribunal confirmed the finding that the
expenditure of Rs.41,14,955/- related to the assessment year 1989-90
but on the question whether the Assessee was entitled to claim this in
the re-computation of its total income pursuant to the order passed by
the Commissioner under Section 263 of the Act, the Tribunal did not
give any finding but remitted the matter back to the CIT (A) for dealing
with the issue raised by the Assessee.
12.

Pursuant to the order passed by the Tribunal on 27th

December, 2000, the CIT (A) considered the issue of allowing the
deduction to the Assessee for the assessment year 1989-90 and
concluded that the order passed by the Commissioner under Section
263 of the Act did not disentitle the Assessee from agitating any fresh
issue that arose as a result of certain developments that had taken place
in the meanwhile. It was held that for re-computing the book profit for
the purposes of Section 115-J of the Act, the Assessing Officer could
have looked into the facts as they existed on that day and, therefore,
the Assessing Officer was not right in refusing to entertain the claim of
the Assessee which arose out of the order passed in respect of the
Assessee for the assessment year 1990-91.
13.

Against the order passed by the CIT (A) on 31st July, 2002,

ITA No.1674/2006

Page 5 of 8

the Revenue preferred an appeal before the Tribunal and that appeal
was dismissed. It is under these circumstances that the Revenue is
before us in appeal under Section 260A of the Act.
14.

We find that apart from anything else, the Assessee is

placed in a rather piquant situation. It is not entitled to a deduction for
the expenditure of Rs.41,14,955/- for the assessment year 1990-91 on
the ground that it is referable to an earlier assessment year but the
contention of the Revenue is that it is not entitled to that deduction in
the earlier year because that issue was not raised by the Assessee at the
appropriate time. The Revenue forgets, in the process, that when the
original assessment order was made on 18th March, 1991, this argument
was not even open to the Assessee and, therefore, could not have been
urged by it. It is only as a result of subsequent developments that the
Assessee could raise such a contention. Moreover, we are also of the
view that since the order passed under Section 263 of the Act by the
Commissioner on 15th November, 1992 related to re-computation of the
income, the Assessee was well within its rights to place all the material
on the record of the Assessing Officer to enable him to re-compute the
correct income in accordance with law.
15.

That apart, we find that the Tribunal has referred to

ITA No.1674/2006

Page 6 of 8

Commissioner of Income Tax v. Geo Industries and Insecticides (I) Pvt.
Ltd., [1998] 234 ITR 541. In this decision, it has been held by the
Madras High Court, on a pragmatic understanding of the law, that
where a claim is made by an assessee for considering an item for
deduction during the course of the assessment proceedings, the
Assessing Officer is duty bound to examine the claim on its merits.
16.

In that case also, certain developments had taken place in

the assessment proceedings for the subsequent year and taking that
into consideration, the Madras High Court observed as follows: “We are of the view that when the assessee made a claim
for consideration of an item for deduction during the
course of assessment proceedings, it is the duty of the
Income-tax Officer to examine the claim on the merits of
the claim. The present case is not a case where the
assessee made a claim with reference to a matter which
was concluded and has become final in the original
assessment proceedings. But, on the other hand, it was
found in the subsequent year‟s assessment proceedings
that the liability of the assessee had accrued when the suit
for injunction filed by the assessee was dismissed by the
City Civil Court, Madras, and in view of the subsequent
event that the deduction might relate to the present
assessment year, the assessee made a claim for deduction
of the damages and when such a claim was made, the
Income-tax Officer was bound to examine the claim on the
merits and it is not open to him to reject the claim even at
the threshold and refuse to entertain the claim.”
17.

In our opinion, the law laid down in Geo Industries is fully

ITA No.1674/2006

Page 7 of 8

applicable to the facts of the present case.
18.

Since, on the own showing of the Revenue, the Assessee was

not entitled to claim the expenditure in the assessment year 1990-91 but
only in an earlier assessment year, and that claim was made by the
Assessee for the assessment year 1989-90, as a result of a direction
given by the Commissioner under Section 263 of the Act to re-compute
the income of the Assessee, no error was committed both by the CIT
(A) and the Tribunal in concluding that the Assessing Officer ought to
have taken these facts into consideration for the purposes of computing
the correct income of the Assessee.
19.

In our opinion, no substantial question of law arises. The

appeal is dismissed.
