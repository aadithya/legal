CM No.10288/2006 in W.P(C) No.2177/2006

1.

The respondent no.1/workman has filed this application under

Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking a direction
to the petitioner to pay minimum wages as per the Minimum wages
Act in terms of the statutory notification issued in respect thereto till
the final disposal of the writ petition.
2.

The respondent no.1/applicant contended that he has been

unemployed since the date of his removal being 17th October, 1994,
and that he has not been able to acquire employment in any
CM No.10288/2006
in W.P(C) No.2177/2006

establishment and has no other source of livelihood because of which
he and his family members are facing acute financial hardship and
mental torture. According to the respondent no.1 he is entitled to be
paid full salary including the revised pay scale in terms of the 5th Pay
Commission Report.
3.

A reply has been filed on behalf of petitioner/non applicant

contending that the applicant/respondent no.1 being a driver cannot
remain unemployed since 17th October, 1994. The petitioner also
contended that the impugned award dated 2nd November, 2004
passed by the Labor Court is illegal and thus the applicant/workman
is not entitled for any relief claimed under section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act.
4.

Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 comes into

operation when an Award directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in further proceedings by the employer. Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act is as under:"17-B. Payment of full wages to workman pending proceedings in
Higher Courts. - Where in any case a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal by its award directs reinstatement of any workman and
the employer prefers any proceedings against such award in a High
Court or the Supreme Court, the employer shall be liable to pay such
workman, during the period of pendency of such proceedings in the
High Court or the Supreme Court, full wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance admissible to him under any rule if
the workman had not been employed in any establishment during such
CM No.10288/2006
in W.P(C) No.2177/2006

Page 2 of 5

period and an affidavit by such workman had been filed to that effect
in such court :
Provided that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the High Court
or the Supreme Court that such workman had been employed and had
been receiving adequate remuneration during any such period or part
thereof, the Court shall order that no wages hall be payable under this
section for such period or part, as the case may be."
Thus a workman would be entitled for relief under Section 17B
of the Industrial Disputes Act, if there is an award directing reinstatement of the workman and the employer has preferred proceedings
against such award at the High Court or Supreme Court and that the
workman had not been employed in any establishment during the period of pendency of such proceedings and an affidavit to that effect
has been filed by the workman. On satisfaction of the requisites as
laid down under section 17B, the court is bound to grant relief to the
workman in terms of the provision as laid down under section 17B of
the Industrial Disputes Act. Also the Court cannot go into the merits
of the case/writ petition while deciding an application under section
17B of the Act as was held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi)
413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.
5.

The object underlying section 17B of the Industrial Disputes

Act, 1947 is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship
which would be caused to a workman due to delay in the
implementation of an award directing reinstatement of his services on
account of the challenge made to it by the employer.
CM No.10288/2006
in W.P(C) No.2177/2006

Section 17B

Page 3 of 5

recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body
and soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award
directing his reinstatement as the statutory provision provides no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal.

6.

Also granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing

orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule;
refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the relief
could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional
error where there is no relationship of employer and employee
between the parties.
7.

In the present case the workman has categorically averred that

he has been unemployed since the date of termination of his services.
The only plea taken by the petitioner refuting the factum of
unemployment of the respondent no.1 is that being a driver the
respondent/workman could not have remained unemployed, is not
sustainable as the same is not supported by any material particulars.
On the basis of the bald allegation of the petitioner the relief under
section 17B cannot be denied to the workman. The applicant,
therefore, fulfills the criteria for availing the benefit under section 17B
of the Act and in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the
Constitution, if the requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial
CM No.10288/2006
in W.P(C) No.2177/2006

Page 4 of 5

Disputes Act, 1947 are satisfied, no order can be passed denying the
workman the benefit of statutory provisions of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
8.

Consequently, the application of the workman/respondent no.1

under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is allowed and
the petitioner is directed to pay to the respondent no.1/workman the
last drawn wages or the minimum wages whichever is higher from the
date of award dated 2nd November, 2004. Arrears of last drawn wages
or the minimum wages be paid within eight weeks. Future last drawn
wages or the minimum wages whichever is higher be paid by 10th of
every month. Respondent no.1/workman is also directed to file an
