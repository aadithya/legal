ANIL KUMAR, J.
Rule.
With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for final
hearing.

1.

The petitioner has impugned the order dated 7th January, 1997 of

Labour Court passed on an application of the respondent No.2 under
WP (C) 5048 of 1999

Page 1 of 9

Section 33(C)(2) holding that the respondent No.2 is entitled for wages
from 13th January, 1984 till the date of his joining duties with the
management on the ground that the respondent No.2 was compulsorily
put off from the duty by the Management and was refused duty despite
respondent No.2 being not under suspension.

2.

The respondent No.2/workman had filed an application under

Section 33(C)(2) and has claimed wages from 13th January, 1984 till
31st December, 1987. His plea is that he had joined the petitioner in
1968. From 1982 he remained absent for certain period and
proceedings were initiated against him. A notice was published against
him directing him to join the duties within fifteen days and therefore, in
January, 1984 he wanted to resume his duties, however, he was not
allowed to join the duties till 31st December, 1987. The petitioner,
therefore, prayed for wages during the said period.

3.

The respondent No.2 admitted that after 18th June, 1982 he did

not return for duty up till 13th January, 1984 on account of his family
circumstances and after reading of notice in the newspaper on 5th
January, 1984 whereby he was called upon to join his duties within 15
days, he sent a communication dated 11th January, 1984 and he
reported on 13th January, 1984 and he also submitted his joining report
to his Chief Engineer but he was not taken on duty.

According to respondent No.2, his case was transferred to

Vigilance Department, however, charge sheet was issued to him only in
October 1987 and though an inquiry was conducted and pursuant
thereto disciplinary authority by order dated 17th April, 1990 had
imposed a penalty of withholding of four increments with future effects
and his period of unauthorized absence on 3rd January, 1981; 16th
January, 1981; 17th January, 1981; 3rd February, 1981 to 21st
February, 1981; 10th April, 1981 to 21st April, 1981 and 23rd May, 1981
to 26th May, 1981 was regularized with the sanction of issue as stood at
the credit of respondent No.2 during the period 9th August, 1981 to 12th
August, 1981; 16th June, 1981 to 25th June, 1981; 27th June, 1981 to
30th June, 1981, however, the period with effect from 18th June, 1982
till the date of his returning on duty was directed to be treated as dies
non.

5.

The respondent No.2, therefore, contended that he is entitled for

wages from 13th January, 1984 when he returned for duty, however, he
was not allowed the join the duties till 31st December, 1987 when he
was allowed to join duties.

6.

The application was contested by the petitioner contending that

the respondent No.2 remained absent without prior permission or
WP (C) 5048 of 1999

Page 3 of 9

without intimation to the management with effect from 18th June, 1982
and did not come to join his duties up to the years 1987 and on this
ground the claim of the respondent No.2 was denied.

7.

The Labor Court framed issues regarding the maintainability of

the application of the respondent No.2 and to what amount respondent
No.2 is entitled.

8.

On the maintainability, the Labor Court had held that no specific

objections had been taken by the petitioner in their written statement
nor any evidence led regarding the non maintainability of the
application and consequently issue was decided in favor of the
respondent No.2. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the
application is not maintainable on the ground that the application is
under Section 33(C)(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and since
the claim of the respondent No.2 is not pursuant to a settlement or an
award or under the provisions of Chapter VA or VB of the Industrial
Disputes Act,1947 consequently, the application is not maintainable.

9.

Perusal of the application of the respondent No.2 reveals that the

application was not filed under Section 33(C)(1) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 nor it has been treated as an application Section
33(C)(1) of the said Act by the Labor Court. Learned counsel for the
WP (C) 5048 of 1999

Page 4 of 9

petitioner contends that in the reply filed on behalf of respondent No.2,
it has been stated that the application filed by respondent No.2 under
Section 33(C)(1) was allowed by the Labor court and consequently the
application is under Section 33(C)(1).

10.

Perusal of the order of the Labor Court and the application filed

by the petitioner, it is apparent that the application was filed under
Section 33(C)(2) and was treated as an application under Section
33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Merely because in the
counter affidavit filed in this court, it has been stated that the
application was filed by the respondent No.2 under Section 33(C)(1), it
shall not become an application under Section 33(C)(1) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947.

The learned counsel for the petitioner is also

unable to point out any specific plea taken by the petitioner regarding
non-maintainability of the application before the Labor Court. On the
contrary, it is apparent that the application is under Section 33(C)(2) of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 which is as under:
“2.
Where any workman is entitled to receive from the
employer any money or any benefit which is capable of
computed in terms of money and if any question arises as
to the amount of money due or as to the amount at which
such benefit should be computed, then the question may,
subject to any rules that may be made in this Act, be deiced
by such Labour Court as may be specified in this behalf by
the appropriative Government [within a period not
exceeding three months]:
[Provided that where the Presiding Officer of a Labour Court
considers it necessary or expedient so to do, he may, for
WP (C) 5048 of 1999

Page 5 of 9

reasons to be recorded in writing extend such period by
such further period as he may think fit).

11.

The respondent No.2 was imposed the punishment of withholding

of four increments with future effect and unauthorized absence was
regularized, however, only the period from 18th June, 1982 till the
respondent

No.2

returned

for

duty

was

treated

as

dies

non.

Consequently, for the period when the respondent No.2 returned for
duty on 13th January, 1984 till 31st December, 1987 is the period for
which the wages have been claimed and the wages for such period can
be computed in terms of money. In the circumstances, the plea of the
petitioner

that

the

application

under

Section

33(C)(2)

is

not

maintainable is without any basis and cannot be sustained. The right
of the respondent No.2 to claim wages from 13th January, 1984 till 31st
December, 1987 was an existing right and the Labour Court was
justified in adjudicating the rights of the respondent No.2 for the said
period.

12.

Regarding the entitlement of the respondent No.2 to receive the

wages from 13th January, 1984 till the date of his joining date, i.e., 31st
December, 1987, it has been held by the Labour Court that the
application by the respondent No.2 dated 11th January,1984 to allow
him to join the duties was received in the office of the petitioner on 13th
WP (C) 5048 of 1999

Page 6 of 9

January, 1984 requesting the petitioner to take him on duty in view of
notice published in Nav Bharat Times on 5th January, 1984 whereby
the respondent No.2 was asked to report for duty within 15 days.

The

Labor Court relied on the fact that despite the application being given
by the respondent No.2 dated 11th January, 1984 which was received
on 13th January, 1984, the petitioner did not take any action and the
respondent No.2 was not allowed to resume his duties on the ground
that the matter was referred to the Vigilance Department and the
respondent No.2 was asked to wait for further orders.

13.

Merely because the petitioner had referred the matter to the

Vigilance Department, pursuant to the petitioner’s own notice dated 5th
January, 1984 to resume the duty within 15 days, the respondent No.2
could not be denied to join the duties on the ground that the matter has
been referred by the petitioner to the Vigilance Department.

The

petitioner was not put under suspension. After giving notice to the
respondent no.2 to join the duties, the petitioner could not deny him
from joining duties on any of the grounds. If the respondent no.2 was
not allowed to join the duties without any legal justification, the
respondent no.2 cannot be denied wages for the period till he was
allowed to join the duties. The inquiry conducted by the petitioner also
resulted into penalty of withholding of four increments, however, the
period from 18th June, 1982 to the date of his returning to the duty was
WP (C) 5048 of 1999

Page 7 of 9

to be treated as dies non and, therefore, the period from 18th June,
1982 till 13th January, 1984 only could be treated as dies non.
Consequently, the respondent No.2 is entitled for wages from 13th
January, 1984 till 31st December, 1987 when the respondent was
allowed to join the duties.

14.

Learned counsel for the petitioner is unable to point out any

illegality in the order dated 7th January, 1997. Rather the attempt was
made to confuse the issue that the period 13th January, 1984 to 31st
December, 1987 was held to be dies non pursuant to the order of the
Disciplinary Authority.

From the order dated 17th April, 1990, it is

apparently clear that the period only with effect from 18th June, 1982
till the date of returning on duty was to be treated as dies non and as
the respondent No.2 returned on duty on 13th January, 1984, pursuant
to the public notice given by the petitioner, however, he was not
assigned any duties on the ground that his matter was pending with the
Vigilance Department, will not disentitle the petitioner his wages. There
is no manifest error or illegality in the order dated 7th January, 1997
passed by the Labor Court so as to entail inference by this Court under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. By now it is a well-established
principle of law that the High Court exercising power of judicial review
under Article 226 of the Constitution does not act as an appellate
authority. Its jurisdiction is circumscribed and confined to correct
WP (C) 5048 of 1999

Page 8 of 9

errors of law or procedural error, if any, resulting in manifest
miscarriage of justice or violation of principles of natural justice.
Judicial review is not akin to adjudication on merit by re-appreciating
the evidence as an appellate authority. Considering the pleas and
evidence taken before the Labor Court, the learned counsel for the
petitioner is unable to show any manifest error or violation of principles
of natural justice.

15

The writ petition, in the facts and circumstances, is without any

merit and it is, therefore, dismissed and the rule is discharged. Parties
are, however, left to bear their own costs.
