MUKUL MUDGAL, J

1.

This appeal arise out of the judgment/decree dated 20th December, 1999

RFA No.324/2000

Page 1 of 16

passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Delhi, by the learned Judge
had held Issue No.4 in favour of the respondents 1 and 2 and against the
appellant and dismissed the suit of the appellant/plaintiff on the ground that the
suit was barred under Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
2.

The facts of the case briefly stated are as follows:-

a)

M/s. Bharat builders and Colonisers A-14/3, Asaf Ali Road, New Delhi

agreed to sell a plot No.E-102, Mansarover Garden, New Delhi for a
consideration of Rs.3600/- on 31st October, 1957 in favour of Sh. Budh Singh,
81, Gaffar Market, Karol Bagh, New Delhi. Sh. Budh Singh died leaving
behind his Legal Heirs (hereinafter referred to as LRs), who are the appellants
in this appeal.
b)

The said M/s. Bharat Builders and Colonisers failed to execute the sale

deed, so the LRs of Sh. Budh Singh filed the suit for specific performance,
which was assigned to Sh. Gian Inder, Sub Judge, Delhi, numbered as Suit
No.212/67.
c)

Since said plot no. E-102 was transferred by M/s Bharat Builders and

RFA No.324/2000

Page 2 of 16

Colonisers to Sh. S.R. Kapur during the pendency of the suit, consequently, Sh.
S.R. Kapur was also impleaded in the said suit. On 14th May, 1968, the decree
for the specific performance of the contract of sale was passed in favour of
heirs of Sh. Budh Singh and against M/s. Bharat Builders and Colonisers and
Sh.S.R. Kapur.
d)

Since the Judgment Debtors failed to execute the sale deed as directed by

the judgment dated 14th March, 1968 then the Court of Sh. B.B.Chaudhary,
Sub-Judge, Delhi executed the sale deed on 20th February, 1978 in favour of
the L.R.s of Sh. Budh Singh. In the execution proceedings, possession of the
plot was also obtained on 10th April, 1978.
e)

The Decree Holders remained in actual possession of the suit plot till 7th

January, 1980. On 7th January, 1980 it was informed that the appellant no.6 Sh.
Sant Singh (defendant No.2 therein) collected bricks near the plot and tried to
create a boundary wall.
f)

The Decree Holders filed the Suit No. 07/80 for perpetual and mandatory

injunction against the said appellant no.6 for raising any construction. The
RFA No.324/2000

Page 3 of 16

appellant no.6 appeared and pleaded the ownership of the respondent no.1 Smt.
Anjana Devi (Defendant No.1 therein) and claimed to raise the construction.
The said respondent no.1 also was impleaded in the said suit.
g)

The said suit was ultimately dismissed by Sh.A.K. Garg, Sub-Judge,

Delhi vide judgment dated 25th May, 1983 holding that the appellants no.1 to 5
herein, i.e., the legal heirs of Budh Singh were not in possession of the suit
plot, and accordingly the suit for mandatory injunction was not maintainable.
It was held in the said judgment that the remedy for the plaintiffs was to file a
suit for possession.

It was also held that the evidence disclosed that the

respondent no.1 and appellant no.6 took forcible possession of the suit plot
during January 1980, and they are in its unauthorized possession. They have
also not surrendered the vacant possession of the suit plot inspite of having
been required to do so.
h)

Consequently, to the aforesaid judgment dated 25th May, 1983

dismissing the suit upon holding that the remedy of the appellant was to sue for
possession, the appellant/plaintiff filed the suit for possession against the
RFA No.324/2000

respondents/defendants in respect of the suit property, viz., Plot No. E-102,
Mansarover Garden, New Delhi, in the learned court of Additional District
Judge, Delhi being Suit No. 222/89. The other legal representatives of late Sh.
Budh Singh were impleaded as proforma defendants.

j)

Sh. G.S. Jugti, the Additional District Judge, Delhi, delivered his

impugned judgment/decree dated 20th December, 1999, thereby dismissing the
suit of possession of the owners/landlords of the plot bearing No. E-102,
Mansarover Garden, New Delhi-110015. The learned ADJ, Delhi had given a
verdict in favour of the appellants on the issue No.1, 3,5,7 and 8. The learned
ADJ, Delhi, had held issues no. 4 and 6 in favour of the respondents no.1 and 2
and against the appellants/plaintiffs and dismissed the suit of the appellants on
the ground that the suit was barred under Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil
Procedure.
k)

Being aggrieved by the said impugned judgment/decree dated 20th

December, 1999, passed by the ADJ, Delhi, Sh. G.S. Jugti, the appellant herein
RFA No.324/2000

Page 6 of 16

preferred the present appeal.
3.

Since the other issues were held in its favour the appellant has

challenged the finding of the learned Additional District Judge only on the
issue No.4 which reads as follows:
“Issue No.4: Is the suit barred by Order
2 Rule 2 CPC, if so, to what effect?
O.P.D.”

4.

The reasoning of the Additional District Judge qua issue no.4 is to be

found in paragraph 17 of the impugned judgment which reads as follows:
“17. The present plaintiffs filed the suit
for permanent injunction against the
present defendants No.1 and 2. The said
suit has been decided by the Court of Sh.
st
A.K. Garg, Ld. Sub-Judge, 1 Class (as he
then was) on 25.5.83. In the said suit it
was held that the present plaintiffs were
not in possession of the plot and the
possession was with defendant No.1 and
IA Defendant No.1 is Sh. Jagdish Lal and
Defendant No.1A is Smt. Anjana Devi.
Accordingly, the suit of the plaintiffs was
dismissed on 25.5.83.
After having
failed in the said suit, the plaintiffs have
filed the present suit for possession. This
suit for possession clearly shows that
plaintiff are not in possession and the
possession is with the defendants. In the

RFA No.324/2000

Page 7 of 16

said suit before the Court of Sh. A.K.
st
Garg, Sub Judge, 1 Class Delhi, no relief
of possession was claimed.
No
application filed for reserving this relief
of possession to be claimed in subsequent
suit. There is no such order by the Trial
Court also for granting such permission.
When the relief was available under a
particular cause of action, it was not
claimed in the suit, it clearly means that it
was given up and it was omitted in the
said suit. The defendants have taken a
defence that the present suit for
possession is barred by order 2 rule 2, so
it is not maintainable, Order 2 Rule 2 is
hereby reproduced as under:
Suit to include the whole claim:2(1) Every suit shall shall include the
whole of the claim which the plaintiff's is
entitled to make in respect of the cause of
action; but the plaintiff may relinquish
any portion of his claim in order to bring
the suit within the jurisdiction of any
court.
Relinquishment of part of claim-(2)
Where a plaintiff omits to sue in respect
of or intentionally relinquishes any
portion of his claim, he shall not
afterwards sue in respect of the portion so
omitted or relinquished.
Omission to sue for one of several
reliefs(3)
A person entitled to more
than one relief in respect of the same
cause of action may sue for all or any of
such reliefs; but if he omits, except with
leave of the Court, to sue for all such

RFA No.324/2000

Page 8 of 16

reliefs, he shall not afterwards sue for any
relief so omitted.”

5.

Thereafter the learned Additional District Judge relied upon the

following judgments to hold the issue of Order 2 Rule 2 of the CPC against the
appellant:
(i)

Krishna Ji Ramchandra v. Raghunath Shankar and others,
AIR (1954) Bombay 125.

(ii)

Gnanaprakasam v. Sabasthi Ammal, 1980-Madras Law Journal
Reports-182.

(iii)

Indubai v. Jawahar Lal, AIR (1980) MP 80.

6.

Thereafter, the rationale for finding the issue No.4 against the appellant

is in the following terms:
“21. In the present case, the first suit
was filed by the plaintiffs for permanent
and mandatory injunction before the court
of Sh. A.K. Garg, the Ld. Sub-Judge (as
he then was), and that was dismissed on
25.5.83. That suit was also related to plot
No.E-102, Mansarover Garden, against
defendant No.1 Sh. Jagdish Lal, and
defendant No.1-A Smt. Anjana Devi. In
the present case they are also defendant
RFA No.324/2000

Page 9 of 16

No.1 Smt. Anjana Devi and defendant
No.2 Sh. Jagdish Lal. In the earlier suit
the relief of mandatory injunction was
nothing but a relief of possession, though
cleverly worded in order to save Court
fees being paid on the plaint. Cause of
action in the first suit decided on 25.5.83,
by the court of Sh. A.K. Garg, and the
cause of action in the present suit is the
same between the same parties touching
the same property. If the relief of
possession was not claimed in the earlier
suit then it would mean that it was given
up and omitted. The same relief of
possession cannot be claimed in the
present suit in view of order 2 rule of
CPC.
In the earlier suit, the issue No.3
and 5 were framed as under:Issue No.3: Whether the suit is
not maintainable? OPD
Issue No.5: Whether
the
plaintiff is entitled to the relief as
claimed? OPP.
Both these issues have been decided
against the plaintiffs in the said suit, who
are now plaintiffs also in the present suit.
When the issues in the earlier suit have
been decided between the parties
touching the same property, these issues
will operate as res judicata also, even then
the suit is not maintainable. So the relief
of possession claimed in the present suit
by the plaintiffs cannot be allowed in
view of the bar of order 2 rule 2 read with
the section 11 of CPC.”

RFA No.324/2000

7.

The issues framed in the impugned judgment by the Additional District

Judge in Suit No. 222/89 are as follows: -

i.
Whether the plaintiffs and the defendants 3
to 5 are owners of the plot?
OPP
ii.
Whether the defendants no.1 and 2 have
taken forcible possession of the plot during Jan,80?
OPP
iii.
Is the suit correctly valued for the purpose
of court fees and jurisdiction, if not, what is the
correct valuation?
OPP
iv.
Is the suit barred by Order 2 Rule 2 CPC, if
so, to what effect?
OPD
v.
Whether Sh.S.R. Kapur and M/s. Bharat
Builders and Colonisers are necessary parties to
the suit?
OPD
vi.
If the suit for possession is not maintainable
against defendants 1 and 2?
OPD
vii.
Whether decree dated 14.5.68 is a nullity
for the reasons mentioned in para 5 of the written
statement of defendants 1 and 2, if so, its effect?

Is the suit within time?

OPD

Is the defendant No.1 purchaser of the plot

x.

Relief.”

None of the above issues pertains to res judicata.
The issue nos. 1,3,5,7 and 8 were decided in favour of the appellants.
However, the learned Additional District Judge held the issues no.4 and 6 in
favour of the respondent no.1 and 2 and had dismissed the suit of the appellants
to this extent.
8.

The issues in the previous suit decided by Sh. A.K. Garg on 25th May,

1983 in suit no. 7/80 filed by the appellant are as follows:“(1) Whether the defts No.1 & 1(a) are bound by
the decree passed against S.R. Kapoor by the Court
st
of Sh. Gian Inder Singh, the then Sub-Judge, 1
Class, on 14.5.68?
OPP
(2)
Whether the deft. No.1 & 1(a) are not bound
by the sale-deed dated 20.2.78 executed by the court
of Sh. B.B. Choudhary, the then SJIC, Delhi on
behalf of the M/s. Bharat Builders & Colonizers and
S.R. Kapoor?
OPD
(3)

(4)
RFA No.324/2000

Whether the suit is not maintainable?
OPD
Whether the suit has not been properly
Page 12 of 16

valued for the purpose of court-fee and jurisdiction?
OPD
(5)
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief
as claimed?
OPP
(6)
Relief.
(7)
Whether there was no privity of contract
between S.R. Kapoor and Plaintiffs? If not its
effect?”

The finding on issue no.3 by the learned Additional District Judge , A.K.
Garg is as follows:“Issue No.3: 12.
The plaintiffs pray for mandatory injunction as well
as perpetual injunction. They seek perpetual injunction
restraining the defendants No.1 & 2(a) from interfering
with their possession. Obviously this relief is being
claimed on the assumption that the plaintiffs are in
possession of the suit land. Similarly the mandatory
injunction is also being claimed on the same assumption.
The evidence, however, discloses that the plaintiffs are not
in possession of the disputed land. Plaintiff No.1 Iqbal
Singh as (sic has) examined himself as PW1. He has
stated that the physical possession of the plot in dispute is
with the defendants. He further admits that a chowkidar
employed by defendants No.1 & 1(a) is residing in a
covered room on the disputed place. He further admits
that the cement sheets on the covered place was laid by the
defendants. He also concedes that there is a door in the
boundary wall constructed by the defendants. All these
admissions made by the plaintiff demolish the case for

RFA No.324/2000

Page 13 of 16

perpetual injunction. When the plaintiffs are not in
possession, where is the question of protecting them
against dispossession. They are already out of possession
and as such their remedy would be a suit for possession
and not a suit for injunction. Since the plaintiffs are not in
possession, it would not be possible to grant them the relief
of mandatory injunction because that would serve no
purpose.
Ld. Counsel for plaintiff has cited A.I.r. 1978
Madhya Pradesh-76, Amrit Lal Vs. Kesari Parshad,
wherein it was held that when any land or immovable
property is not of any use to the owner, the doctrine that
possession follows title applies.
There can be no
dispossession or discontinuance of possession by the mere
absence of use and enjoyment when the land or the
property is not capable of any use or enjoyment. I do not
know how this authority helps the plaintiffs. Admittedly,
there was no boundary wall around the plot in dispute.
There is also a room constructed on it. A Chowkidar
employed by defendants No.1 & 1(a) is residing there.
How then can it be said that the property is not capable of
any use or enjoyment. Moreover, the plaintiff has
expressly admitted that defendants No.1 & 1(a) are in
possession. It, therefore, does not lie in the mouth of the
plaintiffs to argue that they are still in possession.
In view of the above discussion, I came to the
conclusion that the suit for injunction is not maintainable.”

9.

In our view, the learned Additional District Judge in the impugned

judgment dated 20

th

December, 1989 in Suit No. 222/89 has completely

ignored the aforementioned underlined portion where it is clearly postulated
that the remedy of the appellants was to file a suit for possession. The above
RFA No.324/2000

Page 14 of 16

findings, in our view, though not in explicit terms but nevertheless by
necessary implication do permit and indeed enable the appellant to file a suit
for possession, as the omission to sue for possession lead to the rejection of the
Suit No. 07/80 by Sh. A.K. Garg. Thus, the entire rationale of the impugned
judgment qua issue no.4 leading to the dismissal of the suit on the basis of
Order II Rule 2 CPC is unsustainable. This apart, the finding of res judicata
while discussing Order II Rule 2 CPC cannot also be sustained as there was no
issue framed qua res judicata.
10.

Besides, the interest of justice also shows that the appellant has since 14th

May, 1968, when he secured a judgment in his suit for specific performance in
his favour, been battling to enjoy the fruits of such a judgment. The original
claimant Budh Singh has already died and his legal heirs even after about 40
years are still struggling to obtain possession of the suit premises.

RFA No.324/2000

Page 15 of 16

11.

Consequently, the appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment/decree

dated 20th December, 1999 passed by the learned Additional District Judge,
Delhi, is set aside to the extent of findings on issue No.4 and 6. The cross
objections of the respondent not having been pressed are thus dismissed. The
respondents 1 and 2 or any one seeking to derive title / possession from the
respondents 1 and 2 are directed to hand over the possession of the suit
premises at E-102, Mansarovar Garden to the appellants on or before 30 th April
2008.
