The petitioner has filed this writ petition against

the Air Port Authority of India and the Mahanagar
Telephone Nigam Limited praying for quashing of the

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 1 of 26

proposal dated 22nd August, 2002 whereby the respondents
have proposed to set up a modern communication center in
an area admeasuring approximately 20 square meters with
facilities including STD/ ISD/ PCO/ fax/ internet/ e-mail/
video conferencing etc in the Transit Lounge of the Terminal
II Indira Gandhi International Airport. The petitioners have
made the following prayer in the writ petition :“a)
allow this writ petition, issue
a writ of certiorari, quash the
communication/proposal bearing Ref.
No. AAD/EST-227(2)/PAY PHONES/
02/3037-40, DATED 22.8.2002 after
holding it to be unreasonable and
unconstitutional:
b)
issue a writ of mandamus,
directing the respondents to continue,
allowing
the
petitioners
to
continue/operate the STD, ISD and
PCO facilities at its premises on
reasonable terms and conditions and;

2.

c)
issue such other writ or write
as are deemed fit in the circumstances
of the case.”
The challenge has been made by the petitioner

principally

on

the

grounds

that

the

action

of

the

respondents is opposed to the constitutional mandate
whereby social justice has to be ensured to all citizens.

There is no dispute to the basic facts on which the

writ petition has been based. Briefly stated it appears that
the Government of India had framed a liberalised policy of
allotment of STD pay phones with a view to provide greater
employment opportunity to the educated unemployed. This
benefit was available to Indian nationals only who were
required to produce an unemployment certificate from their
local

MPs/MLAs/Revenue

Authorities

of

the

rank

of

Tehsildars and above/Employment Officer/Chairman of Zila
Parishad etc who has jurisdiction over the locality where the
applicant resided. The applicant was required to be over 18
years of age. In rural areas he was also required to be 8th or
middle school passed and above and for urban areas, was
required

to

possess

a

matriculation

or

high

school

certificate or above. The application form was required to
be scrutinised. These PCOs were inter alia to be provided
at public places at airports, railway stations, terminal and
suitable sites in consultation with respective authorities
where necessary.
The scheme provided for withdrawal of the PCO at

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 3 of 26

the discretion of the sanctioning authority. Payments and
timings was all postulated under the scheme.
4.

It

has

been

submitted

that

pursuant

to

sponsorship by the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited
respondent no. 3 herein, the petitioners were all granted
licences by the International Airports Authority of India,
predecessor-in-interest of the Airports Authority of India in
1993.

These PCOs were granted a licence of six months

period initially and the licencee was required to provide and
man the STDS/ISD/PCO in the arrival lounge of the IGI
Airport on terms and conditions stated in the letter of
allotment.
5.

These licences were continued from time to time

till 1999 when the respondents proposed to change the
method of allocation by inviting tenders for the same.
6.

This decision of the respondent no. 2 to invite

tenders instead of continuing the licences of the petitioners
was impugned by the licencees in writ petitions before this
court including CW No.51051/99 entitled Jai Karan singh
Vs. Airport Authority of India. The action was challenged

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 4 of 26

principally on the ground that though the petitioners were
originally granted tenure licences but the same were
extended from time to time giving rise to a legitimate
expectation of the allottees that the same would be
continued indefinitely. It was also urged that the allocation
to

the

petitioners

was

based

on

the

policy

of

the

respondents to ensure availability of employment to the
unemployed masses.

This was the mandate of the

constitution and that the respondents were constitutionally
enjoined to ensure that social justice is administered.
Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the Apex
Court in AIR 1991 Supp (1) SCC 600 entitled Delhi
Transport Corporation vs DTC Mazdoor Congress & Ors.;
AIR 1990 Supreme Court 1031 entitled Mahavir Auto Stores
& Ors. vs Indian Airlines Corporation and AIR 1989 SC
1642 entitled Dwarka Dass Marfatia & Sons vs Board of
Trustees,

the policy of the respondent no. 2 was also

challenged on the ground that it was violative of the circular
and

guidelines

laid

down

by

the

Bureau

of Public

Enterprises which required public bodies action not to be

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 5 of 26

actuated with commercial considerations.

The petitioner

has also placed reliance on inter se notings between the
officials of the respondents to assert that the petitioners
were being dealt with arbitrarily unfairly and the policy
decisions were mala fide.
7.

The respondents had vehemently disputed the

submissions made and had placed reliance on the terms of
licence executed between the parties as well as Section 11
of the Airport Authority of India Act.
8.

This court had heard the matter at length and vide

a judgment dated 25th September, 2000 rendered in writ
petition 1294/1999 entitled Jaikaran Singh & Ors. vs
Airport Authority of India & Ors. and civil writ petition no.
5105/1999 had rejected the challenge holding interalia as
follows :“11.
I have carefully considered
the respective submissions made on
behalf of the parties. Admittedly, the
terms of licences granted have expired.
Respondents no. 1 has indisputable
right to invite fresh tenders. As per the
terms of the fresh tenders, petitioners
as well as other educated unemployed
were eligible to participate. Petitioners
cannot protest if open tenders are
W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 6 of 26

invited and they are permitted to
compete with unemployed youth who
have not yet had any chance of
rehabilitating themselves. Petitioners
cannot claim that they have a right in
perpetuity to continue with these
allotments,
especially
when
the
allotment was for a limited period and
at the time of extension they had been
informed that they would have to
participate
in
future
tenders.
Condition no. 11 is reproduced
hereunder :
“The said allotments are on
purely temporary basis and
you will have to participate
in the proposed tenders to
be invited to AAI for grant of
regular
licences
for
operating
STD/ISD/PCO
facilities.”
in the wake of this specific
stipulation, petitioners cannot claim
that
they
had
any
legitimate
expectation that they would continue
indefinitely or that there would be any
kind
to
permanency
in
these
allotments, as urged by learned
counsel for the petitioners. Besides,
the petitioner had specifically accepted
the above stipulation when the licence
was extended.
12.
xxxxx From the foregoing, it
would be seen that persons like the
petitioners were eligible to bid Not
only this, even members of their staff
were eligible to bid.
Additionally,
W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 7 of 26

educated unemployed persons who
were registered with the employment
exchange for two years were eligible to
bid without any experience. Based on
the aforesaid eligibility criteria, it
cannot be said that the action of
respondent (illeg.) was arbitrary,
unreasonable or unfair. It may be
noticed that petitioners who were at
the time of allotment found eligible on
the basis of unemployed educated
persons have had nearly seven years of
opportunity to rehabilitate themselves.
At this juncture, if the respondents
with to augment their resources and
revenue by inviting fresh tenders, in
competitive bids, where petitioners as
well as other educated unemployed are
eligible to bid, their said action cannot
be faulted with.
13.
There is also merit in the
contention of learned counsel for
respondent no. 1 that Section 11 of the
Airports Authority Act enjoins upto the
Airports Authority of India to discharge
its functions, so far as it may be, “on
business principles”.
The proposed
action of the respondents, inviting
tenders, is in consonance with the
business principles of augmenting the
public revenue and acting on business
principles.
14.
xxxxx The said guidelines or
memorandum would not advance
petitioner's case because they had
been granted the licence for a limited
period and on its expiry they are
bound
to
surrender
possession.
W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 8 of 26

Petitioners, in any case, were having a
chance to compete and bid in the fresh
tenders.
In case petitioners have
chosen not to bid or participate in the
tenders, it is a decision of their own
violation, for which none else is
responsible. In these circumstances,
petitioners
submission
regarding
violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the
Constitution of India is misconceived.
The authorities cited by learned
counsel for the petitioner, in the light
of the above discussions, would not
apply or advance petitioner's case.

9.

15.
In view of the foregoing
discussion, petitioners have failed to
make out any case for quashing of the
impugned tender notice or for a
restraint against their dispossession or
for issuance of the directions under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
The writ petitions are devoid of any
merit and are dismissed.”
The petitioners impugned the judgment of the

learned Single Judge in LPA No. 523/2000 and 549/2000
which was decided against them by the Division Bench vide
a judgment dated 5th February, 2001. The Division Bench
inter alia held as under :“xxxx As per the terms of the
licence deeds, the licenses of the
appellants were liable to be terminated
at any point of time by giving one
month's clear notice. In view of this
condition which had been incorporated
W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 9 of 26

in the agreements, we fail to appreciate
as to how the licenses could have any
legitimate expectation to continue as
licensees for all times to come. It is
not disputed that the periods for which
the licences were granted have expired.
Therefore, none of the appellants can
claim any right over the space which
were provided to them at the GIIA for
running STD/ISD/PCO booths after
the expiry of the period for which the
licences were granted. The licenses
cannot be allowed to claim permanent
rights to run STD/ISD/PCO booths at
the sites.
It is significant o note that
pursuant to the notice of the first
respondent
inviting
tenders
the
appellants could have submitted their
tenders but they failed to avail of the
opportunity.
The action of the
respondent in inviting tenders is in
keeping with the principles of justice
and fair play.

10.

Keeping in view the principle
laid down in the aforesaid decisions,
the action of the first respondent
inviting tenders for allotting the sites
for running STD/ISD/PCO booths at
the IGIA cannot be faulted.”
It is noteworthy that the Division Bench did not

extend the time sought by the petitioners for submitting
tenders in response to the notice inviting tenders inasmuch
as the last date 5th February, 2001 for submitting the same

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 10 of 26

was long over.
11.

Therefore, so far as the issue relating to the

change of policy on the part of the respondent no. 2 with
regard to the method of allocation of the PCOs is concerned,
the same cannot be gone into the present proceedings. The
courts also already considered the challenge made by the
petitioner to the action of the respondents based on the plea
of the mandate of the constitution necessitating guarantee
of social justice to all in the facts of the instant case.
12.

My attention has been drawn by Mr.Lalit Bhasin,

Advocate, learned counsel appearing for the respondent, to
the reasons which necessitated further
policy.

changes in the

The respondent no. 2 has pointed out that the

successful tenderers of the year 1999 were prevented from
operating the booth as the MTNL, respondent no. 3 herein
refused to sanction lines in favour of the successful bidder
on the grounds that lines can be sanctioned only in favour
of the respondent no. 2 and that the respondent no. 2 can
in turn release these lines to the selected licencees.

The

respondent no. 2 was in these circumstances compelled to

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 11 of 26

take up the issue with the respondent no. 3 stating the
practical difficulties which would arise if such proposal was
to be accepted.

It has been pointed out that out of the

seven successful tenderers, four had started operating their
STD booths at the Airport and one was about to start. The
term of their licence was three years. Two out of the seven
successful tenderers had since withdrawn and one was no
longer interested.
13.

It has further been pointed out that the petitioner

and others had not been allotted the PCO booth through
any tender or competitive selection process but were
individuals whose names were sponsored and allotted
telephone lines either by the MTNL or the Airport Authority.
All these persons were VIP recommendees.
14.

The respondent no. 2 has adverted to difficulties

being faced and complaints having been received against
the petitioner and the other allotees.
The facilities provided by the individual booth
operators were also not satisfactory.
15.

According to the respondents, after liberalisation of

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 12 of 26

the Government policy in the field of communication, four
basic service providers entered the field. These includes the
MTNL, Tata Telenet Services Limited, Bharti Telenet and
M/s Reliance Infocom Limited.
It has been submitted on affidavit that these are
the only four basic service providers who have entered the
arena with the promise of providing better technology and
sofisticated equipments with better revenue generation
ideas for the Government of India and have also promised
to do away with the danger of overcharging.
16.

After consideration of the entire conspectus of

facts and the situation which has emerged on liberlisation
of the services intended, the respondent no. 2 had decided
to set up a modern communication center at the Indira
Gandhi International Airport and to award licences for
providing communication facilities to one of the service
providers who would be responsible for manning and
running the STD booth etc.

It has been stated that the

same is a well thought out policy decision and has been
arrived at after considerable deliberations.

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 13 of 26

17.

I find that the RCAC meeting held on 13th August,

2002 observed that the existing 18 STD/ISD counters were
not functioning satisfactorily and there was also a growing
awareness all around of the requirement of modern
communication facilities including fax/internet browsing/email/video conferencing etc.
18.

In this view of the matter, it was decided to invite

limited tenders for setting up of one communication center
in the transit lounge in terminal II from the only four basic
service providers existing in India.

It was decided that

gradually this concept would be extended to other areas of
terminal II and terminal I and would gradually replace the
manual STD booth. The respondents have also pointed out
that this was necessary in order to modernise the available
facilities at the Airport and bring the same at par with
contemporary airports of all over the world. The same was
in public interest as it would ensure better facilities to the
travelling public.

The decision to invite comprehensive

tenders for providing the entire gamut of communication
facilities not restricted to provision of only STD/PCO

booths. It was decided to invite tenders from all the services
providers in the country so as to maintain quality at the
service centers as well as at the airport and to ensure
fixation of responsibility. The respondents have placed on
record the difficulties being faced through sponsored
franchisers which had resulted in poor quality of service
and complaints.
19.

I find that pursuant to the decision taken by the

respondent no. 2, on 13th August, 2002 tenders were invited
from the four basic service providers vide a tender notice

The

respondents

had

decided

to

standaridise the scope of services when it was decided that
the service provider who succeeded in getting award for the
licence for operating the communication center in the
transit lounge of terminal II shall also provide additional

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 15 of 26

20.

I

also

find

merit

in

the

contention

of

the

respondents, that the proposal awarding licences to the
basic service providers was also desirable as the revenue
areas of the IGI Airport would increase manifold if the
tender process was effected. The respondents have pointed
out that whereas the individual STD/PCO booth operators
were paying merely 2.5% of the monthly bill which came to
Rs.2,500/- per month per booth, the successful basic
service providers was required to pay a sum of Rs.50,000/or 20% of the monthly bill, which ever is higher, in the
transit lounge. Further as per the scheme and as per the
projections of this scheme, as and when any individual
booth came up in other parts of the Airport, the service
profit would be 8.5% of the monthly bill or Rs.4,500/- per
month, which ever is higher. According to the respondents,
the endeavour was to keep pace with advancing technology
and ultimately achieve unmanned STD/ISD/PCO booths at
the IGI Airport just as are available in all Airports all over
the world. The respondent no. 2 intends to have modern

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 16 of 26

well designed user friendly facilities with tamper proof
meters using latest technology of international standards.
21.

The

respondents

have

challenged

the

maintainability of the writ petition on the ground that the
writ petitioners have no right whatsoever to make or sustain
the challenge.

It has further been submitted that the

decision has been taken in public interest. The decision of
the respondent no. 2 is a considered and conscious decision
and the purpose being sought to be achieved is that the
passengers

can

access

communication through the best available facilities.

of
It is

only to remove the intervention controls that the respondent
no. 2 has taken the decision to enter into a direct license
agreement with the basic service providers so that there can
be better and effective control on both the communication
facilities as well as those actually managing the facilities.
22.

The impugned letter dated 22nd August, 2002 is

addressed to the four aforestated service providers inviting
proposals and tenders has been placed on record.

The

effort of the respondents is aimed at providing the best

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 17 of 26

facilities and the best opportunities to the international
travellor.

A proposal to achieve such purpose cannot be

denigrated or discouraged.
23.

The objection of the petitioner that the decision

has been taken motivatedly to benefit a chosen few is also
wholly misconceived inasmuch as the respondent no. 2 has
invited the tenders from all the basic services providers
available in the country.

The petitioners have not been

able to dispute the fact that tenders were invited from all
the service providers in the country. The respondents are
in the best position to assess the technical and financial
feasibility of the proposals by inviting tenders. It has been
so held by this court in the judgments referred to above.
The respondents implemented such schemes as were
placed before the court in the earlier petition. In view of the
difficulties faced, they have further examined the entire
matter and made variations in their policy. The proposals
which have been implemented in 2002 relate to the
development of a modern communication center in order to
make available such facilities as are available all over the

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 18 of 26

world at international airports and such decision can
neither be faulted nor impugned or challenged on any
legally tenable grounds. I find no reason to hold that the
proposal was activated with the arbitrariness or malafide.
24.

So far as the allocation of the provider is

concerned, it becomes necessary to consider the provisions
of Section 11 of the International Airport Authority of India
Act which reads as under :-

25.

“11. Authority to act on business
principles-In the discharge of its functions
under this Act, the Authority shall act, so far
as may be, on business principles.”
The issue as to the manner in which public and

statutory authorities must function and also the question
as to whether they can be permitted to make profit in
certain areas arose for consideration before the Apex Court
in the judgment entitled ONGC etc reported at 1990 (Supp)
SCC

(page

Apex Court as hereunder:“31.
The notion that the cost plus
basis can be the only criterion for
W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 19 of 26

26.

fixation of prices in the case of public
enterprises stems basically from a
concept that such enterprises should
function either on a no profit – no loss
basis or on a minimum profit basis.
This is not a correct approach. In the
case of vital commodities or services,
while private concerns must be allowed
a minimal return on capital invested,
public undertakings or utilities may even
have to run at losses, if need be and
even a minimal return may not be
assured. In the case of less vital, but
still basic, commodities, they may be
required to cater to needs with a
minimal profit margin for themselves.
But given a favourable area of operation,
“commercial profits” need not be either
anathema or forbidden fruit even to
public sector enterprises.”
The respondent no. 2 therefore cannot be faulted

for aspiring and aiming to make profits.

It is noteworthy

that the international airports cater to an international
traveller who is normally expected to belong to the well to
do strata of society. The international traveller is used to
the best of facilities available all over the world.

All

countries show case their best facilities and put their best
foot forward at international airports and there is no reason
as to why the respondent no. 2 should be prohibitted from
so doing as well.

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 20 of 26

27.

The petitioners have placed on record certain

communications addressed by different firms to the service
providers

to

assert

that

the

services

providers

are

themselves allotting booths to other persons.
28.

The respondent no. 2 has pointed out that the

person who had written the letter to the service provider
which has been referred to by the petitioner, has also
pointed out that he has the experience of over forty years
and that he would be in a position to provide all the
communication facilities which is not so in the case of the
petitioners.
29.

It is alleged by the petitioners that what is really

intended to be done is not being done.

According to the

petitioners, by a circuitous method the service providers are
being permitted to make allocations to persons who are
similarly placed as the petitioner.
30.

On the other hand the respondent no. 2 has

referred to these communications to show that these are
part of correspondence between the prospective firms who
are intending to associate themselves with the service

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 21 of 26

providers. So far as respondent no. 2 is concerned, it is the
service providers to whom the tender is awarded alone who
shall remain responsible and liable for the various facilities
and services which are to be provided at the communication
center.
In any case, if the terms of the tender and licence
permit franchising, the petitioners would also have an
opportunity

to

satisfy

the

service

provider

of

their

credentials and to compete alongwith such persons.
31.

The petitioners have enjoyed the benefit of having

manned PCOs for over seven years which allocations were
made without any competition or assessment of ability. In
view of the statutory mandate of Section 11 of the Airports
Authority of India Act, the Authority has to be run on
business principles.
I may notice that the service providers are not a
party to the present petition.

The rights of the petitioner

stand extinguished and the decision to award the tender to
a service provider has also not been challenged.
32.

So far as all other contentions and the rights of the

W.P.(C) 7559/2002

page 22 of 26

petitioners

are

concerned,

there

has

been

binding

adjudication thereof in the earlier writ petition and appeal.
I am bound by the findings of my learned brother
in the judgment dated 25th September, 2000 upheld by the
Division Bench in its judgment dated 5th February, 2001. It
has been authoritatively held that the petitioners have no
vested right with regard to the PCO booths. The arguments
on behalf of the petitioner based on the constitutional
mandate and principles of social justice also stand rejected
and cannot be re-agitated in the present petition.
33.

I have already held that the proposal of the

respondents as contained in the communication dated 22nd
August, 2002 cannot be impugned on any legally tenable
grounds.
34.

Reliance has also been placed on the judgment

reported at 63(1996) DLT 62 entitled G.N. Mehra vs.
International Airport Authority of India

to contend that

balance of convenience and public interest are against the
petitioners and that interests of public revenue would
override the private interest of the petitioner.

I may also notice here that the petitioners had filed

an interim application on which the following order was
made on 5th August, 2003:“05.08.2003
