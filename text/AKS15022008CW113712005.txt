A.K. SIKRI, J.
1. This petition raises an interesting question of law.

The

question which requires consideration is as to whether
SC/ST candidates appointed by promotion on their own
merit are entitled to be adjusted against the reserved
points of the roster, or in the general category. The
respondents herein, who belong to general category, claim

WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 1 of 19

that action of the Government in not adjusting such SC/ST
candidates against the reserved points but giving them the
slots in the general category was not appropriate.

They

challenged the action of the Government by filing OA No.
2095/2004. This OA has been allowed by the Tribunal vide
its judgment dated 31.1.2005.

Feeling aggrieved, the

Union of India has preferred this petition impugning that
judgment.

Before taking note of the rival contentions, it

would be appropriate to note as to how Tribunal has dealt
with the issue.
2. Respondents, who are to in numbers, were employed as
Inspectors of Central Excise under the charge of Chief
Commissioner, Central Excise, Delhi, (petitioner No. 3
herein). The cadre of Inspectors is a feeder cadre for
promotion to the post of Superintendent Grade 'B'. As per
the

recruitment rules for

this

promotional post,

an

Inspector with 8 years' service on regular basis is eligible
for consideration for promotion to the next grade of
Superintendent Grade B which is a selection post.

The

selection is to be made on the basis of relative performance
of the Inspectors in the feeder cadre and their seniority in
that cadre.

As per Government of India instructions,

reservation to the extent of 15% and 7.5%is provided for
SC/ST category Inspectors for promotion to the said post
WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 2 of 19

respectively.

This policy of reservation is implemented by

post based roster system introduced vide DOP&T OM
dated 2.7.1997 read with OM dated 11.7.2002.

The

Chairman, Central Board of Excise & Customs (petitioner
No.

2

herein)

has

issued

letter

dated

18.3.2003

interpreting aforesaid OM dated 11.7.2002 stating that this
reservation is to be granted in the following manner:
“It is clear that there are a
total of 282 vacancies of which 39
and 24 are reserved for SCs and
STs. Remaining 219 vacancies are
un-reserved.
If a select list is
prepared for 282 candidates taking
into account the merit of the
candidates, first 219 candidates of
the select list would be candidates
selected by their own merit.
If
some
SC/ST
candidates
are
included
in
these
first
219
candidates, they are evidently
selected on their own merit and
would
be
adjusted
against
unreserved slots. SC/ST candidate
appearing at S.No. 220 onwards
whether out of the normal or the
extended zone of consideration will
be taken to have been selected by
reservation.”
3. As per the aforesaid clarification, those SC/ST candidates
who are selected on their own merit are to be adjusted
against unreserved slots.

Following this mandate, when

promotion of Inspectors to the Superintendent Grade B was
made, some of the persons belonging to SC/ST category

WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 3 of 19

were adjusted against unreserved posts meant for general
category candidates.

4. It is the issuance of these orders with which the
respondents herein felt aggrieved and filed OA before the
Tribunal under Section 19 of the Central Administrative
Tribunal Act.

They contended that these orders caused

prejudice to their interest seeking promotion to the post of
Superintendent Grade B.
SC/ST

candidates

who

It was their submission that
had

availed

the

benefit

of

reservation and got promotion had been adjusted against
unreserved slots to the prejudice of general candidates and
reserved slots are included as backlog vacancies in
violation of the instructions, which action was violative
under Articles 16 & 14 of the Constitution.

They relied

upon the judgment of the Hyderabad Bench of the Tribunal
dated 31.7.2003 in the case of B.C.K. Ralu v. Chief

Commissioner of Central Excise, A.P. Zone & Another.

5. After

considering

the

aforesaid

submission

of

the

respondents and the submissions of the petitioner herein,
the Tribunal directed the petitioners to apply the principles
evolved by it in B.C.K. Ralu (supra). Entire discussion in
this behalf can be traced to two paragraphs in the
WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 4 of 19

impugned judgment which are reproduced below:
“7. A perusal of the OA makes
it amply clear that applicants are
Inspectors of Central Excise and
seek promotion to the post of
Superintendent Grad 'B'.
They
have
sought
benefit
of
the
Tribunal's order dated 31.7.2003 in
the case of B.C.K. Ralu (supra).
The
learned
counsel
for
respondents further stated that the
Tribunal's orders relied upon by
applicants relate to promotion from
a lower post to the post of
Inspector and as such, the issue
involved in the present case is not
identical to that of the case of
B.C.K. Ralu.
This contention of
respondents is not acceptable.
True that applicants before us are
Inspectors while applicants in the
case of B.C.K. Ralu belonged to the
feeder category for promotion to
the post of Inspectors.
In the
present
case,
applicants
are
Inspectors and seek promotion to
the
next
higher
post
of
Superintendent Grade 'B'.
This
distinction is immaterial as the
principle decided in the case of
B.C.K. Ralu is applicable to the
present case as well.
8. Having regard to the
discussion made above, we dispose
of the present OA with a direction
to the respondents to apply the
principles evolved by the Court in
the case of B.C.K. Ralu (supra) and
decide, by passing a detailed and
speaking
order,
applicants'
representation Annexure A-4 dated
2.4.2004 within a period of two
months
from
the
date
of
communication of these orders.
Ordered accordingly.”

6. It is clear from the aforesaid order that Tribunal did
nothing more than holding that the case of the respondents
was covered by B.C.K. Ralu (supra) and directing the
petitioners to apply the principles contained therein.
7. Copy of the judgment in B.C.K. Ralu (supra) is also
enclosed with this writ petition and it would be prudent to
take note of the principles laid down by the Hyderabad
Tribunal in the said case as well.

8. A perusal of that judgment would reveal that the Tribunal
had considered the import of office memo dated 11.7.2002
read with office memo dated 2.7.1997 and also some of its
earlier judgments. These aforesaid office memoranda were
interpreted by the Tribunal in the following manner:
“Heard the learned Counsel
on both sides.
We have gone
through all the facts of the case
and the material placed before us
along with the arguments put forth
by the learned counsel on both
sides.
The position is now clear
from
the
DOPT
Office
Memorandum dated 2.7.1997 and
further clarification issued on
11.7.2002 that if an SC/ST/OBC
candidates recruited through direct
recruitment
competes
with
unreserved
candidates
in
all
aspects and is selected to the
unreserved vacancy based on his
WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 6 of 19

merit, he would be counted as
unreserved candidate. But if an
SC/ST/OBC candidate gets a higher
merit/rank and if he is a person
who had earlier availed the benefits
of reservations/ concessions, he has
to
be
accommodated
against
reserved quota only.”
9. Based on the aforesaid principle of law stated by the
Tribunal, the Tribunal in that case found that since 15
SC/ST candidates who had taken over their position in the
general category and had been shown against unreserved
vacancies but had already availed the benefit of reservation
in one form or the other were not allowed to take their
place

further held that OM dated 11.7.2002 was nothing but

misinterpreted by the official/respondents in the said case
on

the

of

would

be

The Tribunal also

pointed out that OM dated 2.7.1997 was issued as a
consequence of the judgment of the Apex Court in R.K.

WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 7 of 19

Sabharwal v. State of Punjab – (1995) 2 SCC 745 and
therefore it was to be given effect to on the basis of
principle laid down in R.K. Sabharwal (supra).

The

Tribunal also referred to some of its earlier judgments
taking this view as is clear from the following discussion:
“This
action
of
the
respondents is contrary to the very
concept and object of the office
memo dated 2.7.1997 read with the
clarificatory memo dated 11.7.2002
and the following judgements
which explain to draw distinction
between the SC/STs who have
availed the benefit of relaxation:1) BIR SINGH AND OTHERS
V.
UNION
OF
INDIA
AND
OTHERS, dated 30.7.2002 – held
that it has to be exercised whether
the SC/ST candidates who qualified
the selection with central standards
has
received
the
benefit
of
reservation in lower grade posts
held by them resulting in their
accelerated promotion.
2) SIBRAM ADAK V. UNION
OF INDIA AND OTHERS (Kolkatta
C.A.T. Bench) dated 31.1.2001 –
held that once a SC/ST candidate
availed accelerated promotion in
their reserved category, he cannot
change the line and ask for
promotional avenue as a general
category candidate.
3) RAM SINGH V. UNION OF
INDIA AND OTHERS (Patna C.A.T.
Bench) dated 4.8.1999 – held that a
SC/ST candidate who has availed
relaxation/concessions has to be
adjusted against reserved vacancy
only despite securing high position
in the select list on his own merit.

SC/ST candidates who have availed
of the benefit of reservation/

the time of appointment were

slots.”
POSITION OF VARIOUS OMs
10.We may state at the outset that it is common ground that
the judgment of the Apex Court in R.K. Sabharwal

(supra) would govern the field. It is also not in dispute
that OM dated 2.7.1997 is a sequel to the aforesaid
judgment of the Supreme Court as the said circular was
issued to comply with the directions contained therein. It
is also not in dispute that office memo dated 11.7.2002 is a
clarificatory

memo

as

certain

doubts

raised

in

implementation of OM dated 2.7.1997 are clarified therein.
We may also point out that DOP&T has issued further OM
dated 31.1.2005 giving further clarifications. It would be
necessary to extract the relevant portions of all these office
memoranda which have a bearing on the present case.

11.OM

dated

2.7.1997

starts

with

reference

to

the

Constitution Bench judgment of the Supreme Court in R.K.

Sabharwal (supra) and points out that it is held in the
said judgment that the reservation of jobs for backward
classes namely SC/ST/OBC should apply to posts and not to

vacancies.

The court further held the vacancy based

rosters can operate till such time as the representation of
person belonging to the reserved categories in a particular
cadre reaches the percentage of prescribed reservation.
Thereafter, the rosters cannot operate and the vacancies
released by retirement, resignation, promotion etc. of the
persons

belonging to the general

and

the reserved

categories are to be filled by appointment of persons from
the respective category so that the prescribed percentage
of reservation is maintained.
12.Going by the aforesaid principle, it was decided that
existing 200-point, 20-point and 120-point vacancy-based
rosters would be replaced by post-based rosters.

The

principles for preparing these rosters are mentioned in
para 4 of the said OM.
explanatory notes.

Annexure I to the OM contains

For our purposes, note No. 11 is

relevant and we reproduce the same as below:
“11. While operating the
roster,
persons
belonging
to
communities for whom reservation
has been made, but who are
appointed on merit and not owing
to reservation, should not be shown
against reserved points. They will
occupy the unreserved points.”
13.Reading of OM dated 11.7.2002 would show that in
substance it clarifies the doubts raised vis-a-vis aforesaid
WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 10 of 19

para 11.

It indicates that DOP&T had been receiving

reference

from

various

Ministries

etc.

regarding

adjustment of SC/ST candidates promoted on their own
merit in the reservation category introduced vide OM
dated 2.7.1997.

It was clarified that in so far as

appointment by way of direct recruitment is concerned, if
the SC/ST/OBC candidates were appointed on their own
merit and not owing to reservation, they were to be
adjusted on unreserved points.

However, doubts were

raised about SC/ST candidates promoted on their own
merit. In this behalf, following clarification is furnished in
OM dated 11.7.2002:
“(i) The SC/ST candidates
appointed by promotion on their
own merit and not owing to
reservation
or
relaxation
of
qualifications will not be adjusted
against the reserved points of the
reservation roster. They will be
adjusted against unreserved points.
(ii) If an unreserved vacancy
arises in a cadre and there is any
SC/ST candidate within the normal
zone of consideration in the feeder
grade,
such SC/ST
candidate
cannot be denied promotion on the
fake plea that the post is not
reserved. Such a candidate will be
considered for promotion along
with other candidates treating and
as if he belongs to general
category, in case he is selected, he
will be appointed to the post and
will be adjusted against the
unreserved point.
WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 11 of 19

(iii)
SC/ST
candidates
appointed on their own merit (by
direct recruitment or promotion)
and adjusted against unreserved
points will retain their status of
SC/ST and will be eligible to get
benefits
reservation
in
future/further promotions, if any.
(iv) 50% limit on reservation
will be computed by excluding such
reserved category candidates who
are appointed/promoted on their
own merit.”
14.A conjoint reading of the aforesaid four clarifications
would

make

it

abundantly

clear

that

when

SC/ST

candidates are appointed even by promotion on their merit
and not owing to reservation or relaxation of qualifications
will be adjusted against unreserved points and not against
reserved points.

They would still retain their status of

SC/ST and will be eligible to get benefit of reservation in
future/further promotions.

Once such SC/ST candidates

getting promotion on their own merit and not due to
reserved points, even while calculating 50% points on
reservation such persons would be excluded meaning
thereby they would not be treated as promoted against
reserved category.

15.Upto this point, there is no quarrel or difficulty.

The

problem arises in the implementation of these directions

WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 12 of 19

namely when it would be treated that a particular SC/ST
candidate is appointed by promotion on his own merit and
not owing to reservation/relaxation of qualifications. Some
guidance is provided in OM dated 31.1.2005, in this behalf.
Para 3 thereof affords clarification to the effect that since
in the case of promotions by non selection, promotions are
made on the seniority-cum-fitness and the concept of merit
is not involved in such promotions, OM dated 11.7.2002
does not apply to promotions made by non-selection
methods. This OM also reproduces the clarification given
earlier vide OM dated 1.7.1998 which reads as follows:
“It is clarified that only such
SC/ST/OBC candidates who are
selected on the same standard as
applied to general candidates shall
not be adjusted against reserved
vacancies. In other words, when a
relaxed standard is applied in
selecting
an
SC/ST/OBC
candidates, for example in the agelimit,
experience,
qualification,
permitted number of chances in
written examination, extended zone
of consideration larger than what is
provided for General category
candidates, etc., the SC/ST/OBC
candidates are to be counted
against reserved vacancies. Such
candidates would be deemed as
unavailable
for
consideration
against unreserved vacancies.”
CASE AT HAND
16.This brings us to the rules for promotion to the post of
Superintendent Grade B in the instant case.
WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

This

Page 13 of 19

promotion is governed by Superintendents of Central
Excise Recruitment Rules, 1986.

As per the said rules,

post in question is in the pay scale of Rs. 2000-3500 (pre
revised) and is treated as 'Selection Post'.

Method of

recruitment is stated to be by promotion with the proviso
that not more than 5% of the total posts may be filled by
direct recruitment as and when considered necessary.
Thus, post in question is to be filled by promotion and the
mode of promotion is 'Selection'.

OM dated 8.2.2002

issued by DOP&T prescribes the procedure which is to be
observed by DPCs when mode of promotion is selection. It,

inter alia, provides that the selection hitherto distinction in
the nomenclature ('selection by merit' and 'selection-cumseniority') is dispensed with and mode of promotion in all
such cases is rechristened 'as selection only'.

It further

provides that element of selectivity (higher or lower) shall
be determined with reference to the relevant bench-mark
('Very Good' or 'Good'). The DPC is to determine the merit
of those being assessed for promotion with reference to
bench-mark by grading them 'fit' or 'unfit' only.

Those

graded as fit are to be promoted.
17.For promotion to grades below the revised pay-scale of Rs.
12,000-16,500 where the mode of promotion is 'selection',
the bench-mark prescribed is 'good'. Thus, those officers
WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 14 of 19

who qualify the bench-mark of good will be graded by the
DPC as fit or unfit. Those who are graded as fit shall be
included in the select panel prepared by the DPC in order
of their inter-se seniority in the feeder grade and there
shall be no supersession in promotion among those who are
found fit by the DPC in terms of the prescribed bench mark
of 'good'.
DISCUSSION WITH REFERENCE TO THE AFORESAID
RECRUITMENT
RULES
VIS-A-VIS
OMs
HAVING
REGARD TO PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN IN R.K.
SABHARWAL (SUPRA)
18.Based

on

the

position

contained

in

the

aforesaid

recruitment rules, submission of the learned counsel for
the petitioner was that since promotion is by selection it
would imply that merit is the criteria and therefore if
candidate belonging to the reserved category is promoted
on the basis of his merit, he is not to be adjusted against
reserved points of the reservation roster. Learned counsel
for the respondent, on the other hand, had based his
submission on aforesaid OM dated 8.2.2002 as per which
even when the mode of promotion is 'selection' all the
candidates who achieve bench mark of 'good' are to be
classified as fit or unfit only and there is no supersession in
promotion.

He therefore submitted that there was no

element of merit as visualised in OM dated 11.7.2002. He
WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 15 of 19

also placed on record letter dated 16.3.2007 issued by the
Office of Commissioner of Central Excise which, inter alia,
stipulates as under:“There is no provision for
supersession in promotions from
the
post
of
Inspector
to
Superintendent, among the officers
found fit by the DPC.
As per
DOPT's
relevant
instructions
governing above promotions, those
graded as 'fit' (i.e. who meet the
prescribed bench mark) by the
DPC shall be included & arranged
in the select panel in order of their
inter se seniority in the feeder
grade.”
19.On the basis of this letter his submission was that
promotions to the post are only on the basis of seniority,
subject to fitness and in the higher grade also inter se
seniority in the feeder grade was maintained. He argued
that notwithstanding the aforesaid recruitment rules, for
last 30 years the promotions had always been made in the
aforesaid manner.

When the aforesaid submissions were

made in the hearing held on 20.8.2007 taking note of the
respective

submissions

we had

directed the learned

counsel for the Union of India to file an affidavit explaining
this position. However, no affidavit was filed and learned
counsel for the petitioner chose to argue the case without
affidavit contending that position in rules was clear and

WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 16 of 19

there was no such necessity.
20.After considering the respective submissions and the
position contained in various office memoranda, we are of
the opinion that having regard to the recruitment rules, it
cannot be

said

that the promotion to the post

of

Superintendent Grade B is merely on the basis of seniority.
It is treated as selection post.

The procedure to be

observed by the DPC when the mode of promotion is
selection as prescribed in OM dated 8.2.2002. As per this
OM the bench mark 'good' is provided.

No doubt, the

persons are to be ultimately rated as 'fit' or 'unfit'.
However, only those candidates would be eligible for
promotion who are declared fit and to get the declaration
of fit, DPC has to consider and arrive at a conclusion, on
the basis of ACRs and other material provided to it, as to
whether they are to be graded as good.

There is an

element of selection here and unless a candidate achieves
this bench mark, he would be treated as unfit. Fit or unfit
therefore has relevance to achieving the prescribed bench
mark and does not have the same connotation as senioritycum-fitness.

The bench mark 'good' has the element of

merit.
21.Therefore, what is relevant for us to note as to whether
SC/ST candidates are selected for promotion to this post on
WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 17 of 19

the same standard as applied to general candidates. If that
is so, they would not be adjusted against reserved
vacancies.

On the other hand, if relaxed standards are

applied in making their promotions, for example lesser
Bench Mark, lesser period of qualifying service, bringing
them in zone of consideration because of the reason of
their being SC/ST, comparatively lesser ACRs etc., then
they would be deemed as promoted against reserved
vacancies. The bench mark for general category candidates
is good. It is not known and nothing has come on record to
show as to what was the bench mark provided for those
Inspectors who belonged to the categories of SC/ST. In the
absence of such material provided before us or before the
Tribunal it is not possible to come to a definite conclusion.
At the same time, we find that without focusing on this
aspect which was relevant, the Tribunal simply followed

B.C.K. Ralu (supra) and directed the petitioners to pass
a detailed and speaking order on the representation of the
respondents herein. In these circumstances, having regard
to the aforesaid legal position, we modify the directions
contained in the order of the Tribunal and dispose of the
writ petition by substituting the following directions:Those candidates belonging to SC/ST
category who were recommended for
promotions applying the same bench
WP (C) No. 11371-73/2005

Page 18 of 19

mark of 'good' as applicable to the
general
candidates
such
SC/ST
candidates would be adjusted against
unreserved points. On the other hand
such SC/ST candidates who are given
promotion on the basis of relaxed
standards would be treated as promoted
against reserved vacancies.
22.The representation of the respondents herein shall be
considered in the aforesaid light and speaking orders shall
be passed thereon within three months from today. There
shall no orders as to cost.
