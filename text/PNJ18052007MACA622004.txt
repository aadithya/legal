1.

The two captioned appeals arise out of the same

accident which took place on 8.10.1995.

The captioned

appeals are filed by the owner and driver respectively of the
offending vehicle.

The appellant in both the appeals prays

that they should be absolved of their liability to satisfy the
award.
2.

On 8.10.1995, deceased Ravinder Singh aged 28

years died in a road accident stated to be caused by the rash
or negligent driving of the driver of truck bearing No. HR-298954. He left behind a wife, a minor child and parents.
3.

After discussing the evidence on record pertaining

to the accident and holding the driver of the offending
vehicle, guilty of rash and negligent driving, learned Tribunal
awarded compensation in sum of Rs.5,32,000/- to the
claimants. Since it was not proved that the offending vehicle
was insured at the time of the accident, the owner and the
driver of the offending vehicle have been held liable to pay
under the award.
4.

Vide MAC.APP.No.62/2004, owner of the offending

vehicle has challenged the award in so far it determines that
accident in question was caused due to rash or negligent
Page 2 of 12

driving of the driver of the offending vehicle.
5.

Vide MAC.APP.No.76/2004, driver of the offending

vehicle has challenged the award on same grounds as are
urged by the owner of the vehicle.
6.

Since the issue involved in both the appeals is

same, I shall deal with both the appeals in light of the
evidence on record pertaining to the accident.
7.

Reverting to the claim petition, I note that the case

of the claimants before the Tribunal was that on 8.10.1995
when deceased was going on his two wheeler scooter, he was
hit by the truck bearing No. HR-29-8954 which was being
reversed by the driver namely, Muzamin in a rash and
negligent manner. It was stated that nobody was assisting
the driver when he was reversing the truck.
8.

To establish the manner in which the accident took

place, claimants examined Gyan Singh and Manish Kapur who
were stated to be eye witnesses of the accident in question.
9.

On behalf of driver and owner of the truck, reliance

was sought to be placed on testimonies of above aforenoted
witnesses in the criminal case in FIR No.595/1995.

It was

contended that there were contradictions between the
Page 3 of 12

testimonies before the MACT and those before the Criminal
Court and thus Tribunal ought not to rely upon testimonies of
these witnesses in order to determine the manner in which
the accident took place.
10.

Tribunal rejected the contention of the owner and

driver of the truck and on the basis of the testimonies of Gian
Singh, PW-3 and Manish, PW-4 as also site plan of the
accident, Ex.PW1/5 held that accident in question was caused
solely due to the rash or negligent driving of the driver of the
truck.
11.

Aggrieved by this finding of the Tribunal, owner

and driver of the truck have filed the present appeal.
12.
the

The first ground raised by the learned counsel for
appellants is

that

Tribunal

erred

in ignoring

the

contradictions between the testimonies before the Tribunal
and those before the Criminal Court and thereby holding that
the accident in question was caused due to the rash or
negligent driving of the driver of the truck. Second ground
urged is that Tribunal erred in holding that truck was
positioned in the middle of the road at the time of the
accident.
Page 4 of 12

13.

To appreciate the first ground urged by the

learned counsel for the appellants, it is important to note the
testimonies of aforenoted witnesses.
14.

Relevant part of the testimony of Gyan Singh, PW-

3 reads as under:“On 8.10.1995 at about 12.00 noon, I went to
market at Om Dharam Kanta, at Sanjay Nagar,
Samaipur Badli to purchase a pipe piece. Then I
saw a truck which was reversing without any
helper and at a high speed and stuck the
scooterist which was coming from the side of
Nahar and was going towards Samaipur. The
scooterist fell down on the road and he
sustained fatal head injuries. The truck number
was HR-29-A-8954. I took the injured to Hindu
Rao hospital in a three wheeler scooter. When
we reached the hospital the doctors brought the
injured brought dead.
XXXX
XXXX
XXXX
XXXX
The name of the scooterist was later on I came
to know as Ravinder who was aged about 23-24
years. The accident took place due to the rash
and negligent driving of the truck driver who
reversed his vehicle without any helper
abruptly.”
15.
However, Gian Singh, PW-3 in his crossexamination deposed as under :-

16.

“I did not see the cause of the accident as I saw
after the deceased had fell down after the
accident.”
Since aforenoted deposition of Gian Singh

establishes that he was not an eyewitnesses to the accident
Page 5 of 12

in question,

therefore, his testimony before the Criminal

Court becomes irrelevant.
17.

Relevant part of the testimony of Manish, PW-4,

before the Tribunal reads as under:
“In the month of the Oct. 95 I was present at my
shop of spare parts at about 12.00 noon I went
on my scooter towards bawana Road Samaipur
Badli. to purchase some spare parts from the
market which is Dharmkata. Ravomder Singh,
Deceased, has also gone in the same direction
about 10 minutes prior to me to take a test
drive. After purchasing the spare parts from the
shop, as I was walking towards my scooter I saw
Sh. Ravinder Singh coming from the front and
the truck suddenly reversed from the Dharam
kata without any helper and hit into the scooter
being driven by Ravinder Singh. I immediately
rushed to the spot but the driver ran away by
then. Shri Ravinder Singh had suffered serious
head injuries and was bleeding profusely. I
rushed to Shane Punjab Dhaba on my scooter
and brought Shri Gyan Singh from there and
together we took Ravinder Singh to Hindu Rao
Hospital in a three wheeler scooter. When we
reached the hospital, the doctor declared
Ravinder Singh dead.”

'I was 14 years old in the year 1995. I was
studying as well as working at that time. The
shop of spareparts and mechanical work was
owned by Shri Ravinder Singh.'
xxxx

xxxx

xxxx

xxxx

'I do not have any documentary proof to show
Page 6 of 12

that I was working in the shop of the deceased.'
xxxx

18.

xxxx

xxxx

'No statement of mine was recorded by the
doctor of the police in the hospital.'
Relevant part of testimony of Manish before

Criminal Court, Ex.RW1/3, reads as under :'On 8.10.95 at 12 noon my brother-in-law
Sr.Ravinder Singh went to take try of a two
wheeler scooter No.DAA 9006 and I was on shop
of my jeeja and when my jeeja was coming after
taking try from side of nahar. And in the way a
truck No.HR 29 8954 was being driven back from
Shiv Dharam Kanta, and there was no helper/
conductor behind the truck to gave any signal.
The aforesaid truck hit the scooter from back
and my jeeja fell down from the scooter.
Meanwhile the driver of the truck came down
and saw my jeeja falling down and thereafter
driver tried to run away from there but mean
while I also reached there and other persons
tried to apprehend the driver but he did not stop
and run away by saying that he would made
telephone call to the owner of the truck.
Thereafter I took my jeeja in TSR with the help of
Gian chand and then we took to HRH. Where the
doctor declared my jeeja dead.
xxxx
xxxx
xxxx

19.

My statement was also recorded by the IO and
thereafter I along with Gian Chand went to the
PS to make enquiry about one case where the
truck which caused accident was also standing
in the PS.”
According to the learned counsel for the appellant,

there are following contradictions between testimony of

Page 7 of 12

Manish before Tribunal and that before Criminal Court:“1. Before the Tribunal, Manish deposed that
deceased that he was employed with deceased
while before the Criminal Court, he deposed that
deceased was his Jeeja.
2.
Before the Tribunal, Manish deposed that
before he reached the spot of accident, the
driver of the truck had already run away while
before the Criminal Court, he deposed that he
tried to apprehend the driver.

20.

3.
Before the Tribunal, Manish deposed that
his statement was not recorded by the police
while before the Criminal Court, he deposed that
his statement was recorded by I.O.
The aforenoted consistencies as pointed out by

learned counsel for the appellants are minor in nature. It is
relevant to note that there is no inconsistency in his
depositions pertaining to manner in which the accident took
place.
21.

Even otherwise, testimony of Manish in Criminal

Court was recorded on 5.8.1998. His testimony before the
Tribunal was recorded on 17.10.2003.
22.

In

order

to

rely

on

aforenoted

alleged

contradictions, it was necessary that Manish should have
been confronted with his statement as recorded in the
Criminal Case and opportunity had to be granted to the

Page 8 of 12

witness to explain the contradiction before the same could
have been read against him. The driver in his testimony as
RW-1 merely referred to the testimony of Manish before the
criminal court. In the trial before MACT, Manish, PW-4, was
never confronted with his statements made before the
criminal court.
23.

Motor Vehicles Act is a beneficial Act intended to

provide monetary solace to dependents of the victims of the
road accident.

Burden of proof as envisaged under Motor

Vehicle Act is liberal.
24.

The testimony of Manish, PW-4 clearly establishes

that accident in question was caused due to rash or negligent
driving of the driver of the truck bearing No. HR-29-8954.
25.

Noting the site plan, Ex.PW1/5, Tribunal in para 19

has observed as under :'19. The witness has described the manner in
which the accident took place. Even, if, we
ignore the testimony of PW3 and 4, then too in
the present case, the circumstances itself speak
of the negligence on the part of the driver of the
truck. The certified copy of the site plan as
prepared in the criminal case, has been placed
on record, which is Ex.PW1/5.
It has been
indicated that the trailer was found standing in
the middle of the road and the scooter had been
going on the road perpendicular to the road on
Page 9 of 12

which the trailer was standing. The position of
the vehicles itself corroborate the case of the
witnesses that the scooterist was going on the
Samaipur Badli road, and was hit by the truck
while it was being reversed without taking due
care and caution.'
26.

According

to

the

learned

counsel

for

the

appellants, Tribunal erred in holding that truck was found
standing in the middle of the road.
27.

I agree with the learned counsel for the appellants

inasmuch as Tribunal has mis-appreciated the site plan
Ex.PW1/5.

In the site plan, Dharamkata (weigh bridge) is

shown as a road and Tribunal without realizing that it was not
a road but Dharamkata has held that truck was found
standing in the middle of the road.
28.

However, this error committed by the Tribunal

does not help the case of the appellants. The said site plan
shows that the truck was reversing out from Dharamkata.
It's rear is protruding on the road.

This corroborates the

testimony of Manish, PW-4 who had deposed that accident in
question was caused when the driver reversed the truck from
the Dharamkata, and was not being guided.
29.

In

view

of

my

above

discussion,

Page 10 of 12

MAC.APP.No.62/2004

and

MAC.APP.No.76/2004

are

dismissed.
26.

No costs.
