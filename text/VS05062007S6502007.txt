By this order, I propose to dispose of the application filed

by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2

of the CPC and IA No.

the applications under Order 39 Rule 4

Page 1 of 32

CPC filed by defendant Nos. 1 and 10 to 12 respectively. Defendant
Nos. 2 to 9 have also adopted the aforesaid applications under Order
39 Rule 4 filed by defendant no.1 and prayed for the vacation of the
ex-parte ad interim order of injunction passed by this Court on 4th April,
2007.
2.

The plaintiff has filed the present suit seeking the relief of

permanent injunction and damages. The claim of the plaintiff is that it
entered into a distribution agreement with defendant No. 1, Gyrus
Group PLC on 27th September, 2004, whereunder the plaintiff was
granted the exclusive distributorship in respect of various products of
the defendant company over the defined territory i.e. India, Nepal and
Bangladesh.
3.

The term of the agreement was for two years, and the

plaintiff states that the agreement was automatically renewable and
that the same stood renewed for a period of one year upto 26.9.2007,
after the initial term of two years, which expired on 26th September,
2006. Plaintiff submits that despite exclusive distributorship granted
to the plaintiff, the defendant was preparing to breach the exclusive
rights of the plaintiff by entering into other agreements with defendant
Nos. 10 to 12 in contravention of the said distribution agreement.
4.

When the suit came up before the Court at the ex-parte

stage, after hearing counsel for the plaintiff and on the basis of the
record and the averments made in the plaint in the application, this

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 2 of 32

Court passed the following order :“I.A.4072/07
Issue notice to the defendant, returnable on 22-82007.
The plaintiff has filed the present suit against the
defendants, inter alia seeking relief of permanent
injunction.
The plaintiff had entered into an
agreement with defendant no.1 referred to as Gyrus
on 22.9.2004 whereunder the plaintiff was
appointed as the exclusive distributor of Gyrus with
the right to import, promote and sell the products of
Gyrus in the agreed territory i.e India, Nepal and
Bangalore. Clause 2 of the Distribution Agreement
reads as follows:2. Grant of Distributorship
“Gyrus hereby grants Distributor the right to import,
promote and sell its products in the Territory and
Distributor hereby accepts such appointment. If the
Exclusivity in Paragraph 1 above is described as
Exclusive, then Gyrus hereby grants Distributor the
exclusive right to import, promote and sell its
products in the Territory. This means that Gyrus
shall not sell the products directly in the Territory, or
appoint further distributors for such products in the
Territory.”
The plaintiff states that since the execution of the
said agreement over the last about 2-1/2 years, the
plaintiff has expended huge amount of money in
trying to develop the market for the products of
Gyrus within the territory. The plaintiff has filed list
of various potential clients all over the country and it
is explained that 1,127 potential clients have been
talked to by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has also filed
the list of various customers with whom agreements
are likely to be finalised for supply of medical
equipment of Gyrus.
This list contains 122
prospective buyers of the said equipment. The
plaintiff has filed on record large number of
documents to show the hard work done by its
employees to develop the market by contacting the
IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 3 of 32

prospective clients. It is also claimed that in respect
of about 76 prospective clients, live demonstrations
have been made on laptop computers etc to large
number of prospective clients.
The plaintiff has also given live demonstration to a
large number of prospective customers over this
period of the products of Gyrus.
The plaintiff has filed E-mail communications
exchanged between defendants nos. 8 and 11 from
which it appears that defendant no.8 who represents
defendant no.1 is planning to terminate the
distributorship agreement of the plaintiff with a view
to appoint defendant no.10 (of whose defendant
nos.11 and 12 are the Directors) as its new
distributor. It is argued that such a move would
cause immense prejudice to the plaintiffs who have
invested huge amounts of time and effort, apart
from money in developing the market of the
machines of Gyrus. Counsel for the plaintiff submits
that the agreement in question is in fact governed
by the laws of England. It is argued that in view of
the exclusivity granted under clause 2 of the
agreement, under the Indian Law, the plaintiff is
entitled to enforce the negative covenant and
thereby seek an injunction to restrain Gyrus from
appointing any other distributor or dealing with any
other entity in respect of the products within the
territory reserved for the plaintiff.
It is further
submitted that by placing reliance on Gujarat
Bottling Co.Ltd and Others v. Coca Cola Co. &
Others, (1995), 5 SCC 545, that under the Indian
law, where a contract is negative in nature, or
contains an express negative stipulation, breach of it
may be restrained by injunction and injunction is
normally granted as a matter of course, even though
the remedy is equitable and thus in principle a
discretionary one and a defendant cannot resit an
injunction simply on the ground that
that
observance of the contract is burdensome to him
and its breach would cause little or no prejudice to
the plaintiff and that breach of an express negative
stipulation can be restrained even though the
plaintiff cannot show that the breach will cause him
any loss.
IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 4 of 32

It is further argued that in the Indian law, the
plaintiff would be entitled to seek a restraint against
the defendant from terminating the distributorship
agreement. It is however pointed out that in the
present case till date, the distributorship agreement
between the plaintiff and defendant no. 1 has not
been terminated.
In my view, in the light of the aforesaid submissions,
the pleadings contained in the plaint and the
documents filed on record, the plaintiff has made
out a prima facie case for grant of ex parte order of
injunction. I accordingly restrain the defendants in
terms of clause (a) to (c) of the application till the
next date of hearing. Compliance of order 39 Rules
1 and C.P. C be made within a week.
Copy of the order be given dasti under the signature
of the Court Master.”
5.

The defendants were served the injunction order and, as

aforesaid, have preferred the applications under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC. I
have heard the arguments of the parties in these applications and that
is how, I am now proceeding to dispose of these applications.
6.

The case of the plaintiff is fonded upon Clauses 2 & 6 of

the Distribution Agreement dated 27th September, 2004 and therefore,
I reproduce these Clauses hereunder :
“2. GRANT OF DISTRIBUTORSHIP
Gyrus hereby grants Distributor the right to
impart, promote and sell its Products in the
Territory, and Distributor hereby accepts such
appointment. If the Exclusivity in Paragraph 1
above is described as Exclusive, then Gyrus hereby
grants Distributor the exclusive right to import,
promote and sell its Products in the Territory. This
means that Gyrus shall not sell the Products
directly in the Territory, or appoint further
IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 5 of 32

distributors for such Products in the Territory.
6.

TERM AND RENEWAL

The initial term of this Agreement shall commence
as of the effective date as set out above and shall
continue, subject to the termination rights stated
herein, for a period of two (2) years from such
date.
At the end of such initial term, the
Agreement would automatically be renewed for
successive terms of one (1) year. However, either
party may decide not to renew this Agreement
beyond the initial or any renewal term. Further,
that for any successive term the parties shall agree
upon a new annual Purchase Target for the next
year of the Agreement no later than three (3)
months prior to the expiration of the contract term
then in progress. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Agreement may be terminated for cause at
any time in accordance with the provisions of
Paragraph 12 hereof.”
7.

The submission of the plaintiff is that as per Clause 15(d),

the agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales and
under the English Law, a negative covenant would normally be
enforced by a Court. As recorded in the ex-parte order, counsel for the
plaintiff placed reliance on Supreme Court decision in Gujarat
Bottling Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. Coca Cola Co. & Ors. 1995 (5) SCC
545.
8.

The contention of the plaintiffs is that the agreement stood

renewed automatically, since there was no expression of intention by
either party, not to renew the same. Counsel for the plaintiff referred
to Clause 12 of the agreement, which contains the rights of the parties
to terminate the agreement, by contending that there had been no

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 6 of 32

notice of termination issued by the defendant, prior to the automatic
renewal of the agreement on 27th September, 2006. Clause 13 sets
out the procedure for termination, and it is argued that the said
procedure has also not been resorted to by any of the parties to the
agreement.
9.
agreement,

On the issue of interpretation of Clause 6 of the
counsel

for

the

plaintiff

placed

reliance

on

the

correspondence exchanged with the defendant on 21st April, 2004 i.e.
before the execution of the Distribution Agreement. It is stated that in
the draft Distribution Agreement, the term for renewal had been
worded in a fashion that it would terminate automatically at the end of
its term, unless renewed three months in advance. By this e-mail
communication, the plaintiff had stated that normally, the renewal
should be automatic, unless recalled or terminated by either party, by
giving three months' notice.

It is submitted that in view of the

aforesaid negotiation undertaken by the plaintiff, Clause 6 of the
Distribution Agreement was modified to incorporate the view of the
plaintiff which now provides for automatic renewal.
10.

Counsel for the plaintiff drew my attention to the

averments made in the plaint, coupled with the documents filed as
Annexure R, which contains the list of 1127 prospective clients
tapped by the plaintiff all over India for selling the products in
question.

He also referred to Annexure S, which enlists 122

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 7 of 32

prospective clients in respect of whom the contracts for supply of the
products in question are likely to be finalized in due course.

The

plaintiff also drew my attention to Annexure T, which enlists 76
prospective clients, to whom laptop presentations have been given in
respect of products of the defendants.

The plaintiff has also filed a

large number of documents such as bills, vouchers, correspondence
exchanged

with

prospective

clients

to

show

the

efforts

and

expenditure expended for the purpose of developing the market for
the defendants' products in India. The plaintiff states that after having
availed of the services of the plaintiff in the initial stage, when great
deal of effort is required to develop the market, the defendants are
now acting malafide by proceeding to breach the agreement,
whereunder the plaintiff enjoys the exclusive right to distribute the
products in question within the earmarked territory.
11.

The

plaintiff

also

placed

reliance

upon

an

email

communication received from the defendants on 3rd January 2007, to
say that far from having the termination of the Distribution Agreement
on its mind, the defendants were desirous of expanding their business
association with the plaintiff by consolidating all the businesses
pertaining to the fields of ENT, Urology, Gynecology and General
Surgery.

It is argued that had the agreement not been renewed

automatically beyond 26th September, 2006, there is no question of
the defendants communicating with the plaintiff in the manner they

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 8 of 32

did on 3rd January, 2007.
12.
oversight,

The plaintiff argued that, apparently, on account of an
the

defendants

forwarded

their

inter-se

email

communication to the plaintiff from which the plaintiffs learnt that the
defendants were planning to terminate the Distribution Agreement.
13.

It appears that on 11th September, 2006 at 9.06 PM, a

communication was sent from Mr. Ram Narain, Defendant No. 11 to
Mr. Mark Lawrence, Defendant No. 8. In this communication, Mr. Mark
Lawrence in response to the query by Mr. Ram Narain: whether the
defendant company has a distributor and whether their contract is still
valid, stated, that the agreement is overdue and will be terminated
with notice. It appears Mr. Ram Narain was apprehensive of stepping
into a situation of confrontation, and stated that he would not like to
promote a product and have legal issues on his hands subsequently.
The plaintiff also finds mention in the said communication.
14.

Mr. Mark Lawrence also stated that they (referring to the

plaintiff) would have some stock which the company of Mr. Ram Narain
may buy in return for customer lists. Mr. Mark Lawrence also offered
to broker this deal for Mr. Ram Narain.
15.

On

the

same

day,

there

is

a

subsequent

email

communication from Mr. Ram Narain at 10.50 PM wherein he writes to
Mr. Mark Lawrence that it is important that he wrote 'him” (which
refers to the plaintiff) about the 'change' of distributor and also of the

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 9 of 32

'discontinuation' of the Distribution Agreement.
16.

He further states that “this is a small market, I know him

well and I would like to avoid any unpleasantness. Once this is done,
then talk to him about his stock ML”. It appears that Mr. Mark
Lawrence responded to this by stating that it would be done.
17.

The plaintiff also relied upon an email communication

dated 26th March, 2007 from the defendants, to state that by this
communication, the defendants in fact disclosed the breach of the
exclusivity clause contained in the Distribution Agreement when they
admitted that they had reached an agreement with Healthcare Pty Ltd.
establishing them as the exclusive distributor in India, for the full
Gyrus ACMI product range. It is argued that this product range would
obviously include the products in respect of which the distribution
agreement was entered into with the plaintiff.
18.

Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that even under the Indian

Law as contained under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act,
(notwithstanding Section 41 (e) - which states that

an injunction

cannot be granted to prevent the breach of a contract, the
performance of which can not be specifically enforced), where a
contract comprises an affirmative agreement to do a certain act, and a
negative covenant, not to do certain act, even though the Court may
not be able to compel specific performance of the affirmative
agreement, that would not preclude the Court from granting an

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 10 of 32

injunction to restrain the breach of the negative covenant. It is argued
that the negative covenant contained in the Distribution Agreement
against the defendant is that they would not deal with any other
person in relation to the products in question, and within the territory
in question, during the subsistence of the Distribution Agreement.
19.

Plaintiffs argued that the defendants made evident their

malafides by seeking to terminate the distribution agreement on
9.5.2007, that is after the filing of the present suit and the service of
the ex parte ad interim order of injunction.

It is argued that the

termination notice is an after-thought and has been issued with a view
to defeat the claim of the plaintiff as well as the ex parte ad interim
order passed by this Court. It is also argued that the ground taken by
the defendants for termination of the agreement- that the plaintiff had
not met the target for the year September, 2005 to September, 2006stood waived upon the automatic renewal of the Distribution
Agreement and also in view of the subsequent conduct of the
defendant in offering an even wider range of products to the plaintiff
for being covered by the Distribution Agreement. It is argued that the
stand

taken

by

the

defendant,

that

the

agreement

was

not

automatically renewed upon the expiry of the initial period of two
years, on the ground that no annual purchase target for the year 20062007 had been agreed to, was also an after-thought. The automatic
renewal was not dependent on the fixation of a fresh annual purchase

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 11 of 32

target, and if a fresh annual purchase target was not specifically
agreed to, the implication was that the target fixed in the previous
year would continue to remain valid for the renewed one year period.
20.

On the other hand, counsel for the defendants, at the

outset, points out that the plaintiff has not even impleaded the
contracting

party,

namely,

Gyrus

International

Limited,

United

Kingdom who had executed the distribution agreement with the
plaintiff. No doubt Gyrus Group PLC is the umbrella company and the
contracting party Gyrus International Limited is a part of the same
Group. However, the plaintiff ought to have impleaded the contracting
party.
21.

It is next contended that the prayers made by the plaintiff

in the suit and in the interim application under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2
CPC are separate and distinct. In the suit the plaintiff has sought the
reliefs of injunction;
(i) to restrain termination of the Distribution Agreement
dated 27.9.2004;
(ii) to restrain the stopping of the supply of machines as
and when ordered by the plaintiff, or the stopping of
supplies of consumables or parts of the machines
already supplied;
(iii) to restrain the defendants 1 to 9 from dealing with any
entity other than the plaintiff.

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 12 of 32

22.

However, in the interim application, the relief sought by

the plaintiff and granted by the Court is to:
(i) restrain the defendants from

dealing with the clients

mentioned in the list annexed as Annexures R, S & T
to the plaint to the exclusivity of the plaintiff with
regard to the products which are subject matter of the
Distribution Agreement dated 27.9.04;
(ii) direct the defendants 1 to 9 to supply to the plaintiff
information with regard to any dealing and/or meeting
and/or any transaction which may take place between
clients mentioned in Annexures R, S & T ; and
defendants 1 1o 9 with regard to the products being
subject matter of the Distribution Agreement dated
27.9.2004, and;
(iii) injunct and restrain the defendants 10 to 12 against
their dealing with entities mentioned in Annexures R, S
& T and for further restraining them from inducing the
breach of the Distribution Agreement dated 27.9.2004
which the plaintiffs have with defendants 1 to 9.
23.

The plaintiff could not seek a larger relief by way of an

interim application than what is not even prayed for in the suit.
Counsel for the defendants relied on Section 14, 41 & 42 of the
Specific Relief Act (The Act).

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 13 of 32

24.

Section 14 of the Act in so far as it is relevant reads as

follows:“14. (1) – The following contracts cannot be
specifically enforced namely;a) a contract for the non-performance of which
compensation in money is an adequate relief;
b) ..............
c) a contract which is in its nature determinable.”
25.

Defendants rely on clause 12(iv) of the distribution

agreement which states that “either party shall have the right to
terminate this agreement upon writing notice on the occurrence of any
of the following events:
(i)...............
(ii).............
(iii).............
(iv)

The failure by the distributor to achieve the annual

purchase target for the preceding year.”
26.

It is further argued that the Distribution Agreement is in its

nature determinable and the same is evident from the fact that it is
within the powers of the parties to terminate the agreement in
accordance with Clause 12 thereof.
27.

The defendants contended that they were entitled to, and

they have terminated the distribution agreement vide notice dated 9 th
May 2007. The relevant extract of the notice of termination of the
distribution agreement sent by Gyrus International Ltd., reads as
follows:
IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 14 of 32

“As you are aware, the initial term of the agreement
was for a period of two (2) years which expired on
26th September 2006. Whilst the agreement had a
renewal clause, it also provided either party an
option not to renew the agreement.
You are aware that IPL had been unable to meet its
annual purchase target of Pounds 150,000.00 for
the year 2006 and that there was a shortfall of more
than pounds 100,000.00 on the part of IPL in
achieving the aforesaid target. For this reason,
amongst others, Gyrus on the expiry of the initial
term of the agreement on 26th September 2006, had
exercised its option not to renew the agreement
with IPL and the agreement is no longer subsisting
between parties.
The expiry of the agreement is evidenced, amongst
other factors, by the fact that admittedly no annual
purchase target for the year 2007 was determined
by parties as required in the event of renewal of the
agreement.
Despite being aware of the fact that the agreement
is no longer in existence, IPL has mala fide
approached the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi by way
of a civil suit, bearing no.CS(OS) No.650 of 2007,
seeking injunctive relief and damages against Gyrus
by falsely alleging that the Agreement stands
renewed and there is a valid and subsisting
agreement between parties. We are taking steps to
place the correct facts before the Hon'ble High
Court.
Without prejudice to the above, by way of abundant
caution, assuming without admitting, that the
Agreement subsists, we hereby exercise our right
under Clause 12A(iv) of the Agreement to terminate
the same.
IPL having failed to achieve the Annual Purchase
Target of $150,000.00 for the year 2006, the
Agreement, if any, hereby stands terminated
forthwith.”

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

28.
Distribution

Defendants submit that even if it was assumed that the
Agreement

stood

automatically

renewed

after

the

termination, the agreement could not be reinstated through the
instrumentality of the Court. It is argued that under Section 41 of the
Act, an injunction cannot be granted to prevent the breach of a
contract, the performance of which would not be specifically enforced.
Since the Distribution Agreement cannot be specifically enforced, no
injunction could be granted to prevent its breach and the only remedy
available to the plaintiff is in damages which have already been
claimed in the present suit.

The Defendants also agreed to render

accounts of any sales undertaken by them after the 27 th September
2006 in the event of it being finally held that the distribution
agreement stood automatically renewed for the period of one year.
The defendants contend that there is no equity in favour of the Plaintiff
who has itself admittedly and miserably failed to meet the targets for
the first two years.
29.

It is submitted that the plaintiffs were well aware that

under the law they are not entitled to grant of an order of injunction in
a case like present, and that is why the plaintiffs have also made a
claim for damages of Rs. 3,42,11,558/-. The interim injunction sought
by plaintiffs and granted by this Court is not to enforce the negative
covenant. It has the effect of completely paralyzing the business of
the defendants. It is also argued that, in fact, the plaintiff is seeking

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 16 of 32

specific performance of the Distribution Agreement and an injunction
against its termination, and neither of these reliefs can be granted by
the Court in view of the various provisions contained in the Specific
Relief Act.
30.

While not disputing that Clause 2 of the Distribution

Agreement contains a negative covenant against the other contracting
party, i.e., Gyrus International Ltd., counsel for the defendants points
out that the plaintiff would not be entitled to seek the enforcement of
the negative covenant since the plaintiff had itself failed to perform
the contract in so far as it is binding upon it.
31.

It is submitted that the admitted position is that the

plaintiff had failed to meet the annual purchase targets set under the
agreement for the first two years. Reference has been made by the
defendants to the e-mail communications sent by the plaintiff on 2nd
August, 2006 wherein the plaintiff admits the fact that it had failed to
meet the annual purchase targets for the first two years which was set
at GBP 50,000 and GBP 150,000 respectively. The shortfall in the year
2005, which was the first year under the agreement (from September,
2004 to September, 2005), was to the tune of GBP 34,384.54 and the
shortfall in the subsequent year (between September, 2005 to
September, 2006) was GBP 112907.30.
32.

From the communication dated 2nd August 2006 and 4th

January 2007, sent by the plaintiff, by email, (filed by defendant No. 1

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 17 of 32

along with I.A. No. 5687/2007), it was pointed out that even to the
plaintiff it was clear that the distribution agreement was no longer
subsisting. The plaintiff by writing this communication was trying to
emphasize that the defendant should continue to deal with the plaintiff
alone in relation to representation of Gyrus ACMI in India. There would
have been no occasion to write this letter, if it was clear to the parties
that the plaintiff is, and would continue to act as the sole and exclusive
distributor of the defendant Nos.1 to 9.

The plaintiff in this

communication inter-alia stated as follows:
“If you are even dealing with 2-3 responsible
companies and they do not bother you much, you
will be able to encash on the strength of each one
of them, individually. As far as I can see, it may not
be possible to find a single company covering all
areas, without actually losing out on a big
percentage of business. This is because in this
age of super-specialization, only the specialized
companies are active nationwide. Then there is a
segment of surgical dealers who deal with all
products, but then, they are active only region
wise.
From your point of view you may feel that the
current business does not justify dealing with
several companies, but trust me, the market does
have a potential to grow big.
I have tried to cover it exhaustive (I hope, it did not
exhaust you already) but I wanted you to have a
complete picture from your experienced partner in
India.”
33.

In this very communication, the plaintiff had advocated the

appointment of Healthware i.e. Defendant No. 10 to 12 alongwith the

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 18 of 32

plaintiff itself to act on behalf of Gyrus ACMI in India. If the right to
exclusivity for distribution was subsisting in favour of the plaintiff in
January 2007, it is argued that there was no occasion for the plaintiff
to either appeal for its continuation as a distributor of the defendants
or to recommend defendant No. 10 to 12 also to the defendants for
being appointed as its co-distributor alongwith the plaintiff.
34.

It was next argued that the pre-requisite, without the

fulfillment of which the distribution agreement could not have been
automatically renewed, was not fulfilled in the present case. The
renewal clause states “that for any successive term the parties shall
agree upon a new annual purchase target for the next year of the
agreement not later than three(3) months prior to the expiration of
the contract term then in progress.”

(emphasis supplied) The

defendants submit that, admittedly, no annual purchase target has
been set at least 3 months prior to the expiration of the contract term
on 26th September 2006 for the next year i.e. 2006-2007. The fixation
of the target for the renewal period of one year was essential so that
the parties could fix their respective responsibilities and obligations.
Else the parties would be left without any definite commitment on
either side about the respective obligations. It is argued that from the
point of view of the defendants, the fixation of the fresh annual
purchase target for the renewed year was absolutely essential, lest the
sole distributor takes no interest in enhancing the sales of the products

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 19 of 32

in question to their grave detriment. Without establishing an annual
purchase target for the renewed year, in the event of there being a
breach of the distribution agreement by the plaintiff, there would be
no way by which the defendants would measure or quantify the
damages suffered by them. There would be absolutely no sanction
upon the plaintiff, in case of its failure to fulfill its obligations under
the distribution agreement. Such a course is not envisaged under the
agreement, since the annual purchase targets have been set in the
first two years of the agreement,

and in the renewal clause it has

been made mandatory for the target to be set for the renewal period
of one year, at least 3 months in advance of the expiry of the existing
term of the agreement.
35.

The defendants further argued that in view of the dismal

performance of the plaintiff in the first two years, it was clearly
understood by the parties that the distribution agreement was not to
be renewed any further, and it is for that reason that fresh annual
purchase targets were not set for the third year. The defendants also
state in paragraph 12 of their application being I.A. No. 5687/2007,
that Gyrus International Ltd., communicated its dissatisfaction with the
performance of plaintiff No.1 time and again and being dissatisfied
with the performance of the plaintiff, it had taken the decision not to
renew the agreement. Accordingly, no annual purchase target was
fixed for the year 2006-07 as required in clause 6 of the distribution

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 20 of 32

agreement and the same was allowed to lapse.
36.

The defendants further state that after the expiration of

the distribution agreement by efflux of time, the plaintiff has placed
only a couple of ad hoc orders for the products in question with the
knowledge that the exclusive arrangement under the distribution
agreement has lapsed.
37.

The defendants also argued that it is absolutely wrong for

the plaintiff to claim that the dealings between defendant No. 1 to 9
and 10 to 12 were clandestine or mala fide.

From the email

communication dated 29th December 2006 sent by the plaintiff to Mr.
Mark Lawrence, defendant No. 8, it is clear that, in fact, it was Mr. Ram
Narain of defendant No. 10 to 12 who had introduced the said Mr. Mark
Lawrence, defendant No. 8, to the plaintiff. Counsel for the defendants
relied upon “Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., v. Amritsar Gas
Services & Ors.” (1991) 1 SCC 533, “M/s. Jai Drinks P. Ltd. v.
Pepsi Foods Ltds.”, 1996 (1) AD (Delhi) 1097.
38.

Mr. Parag P. Tripathi, Sr. Advocate, who appeared for

Defendant No. 10 to 12, adopted the argument advanced by Mr. Anil
Dewan, Sr. Advocate. He further submitted that the agreement in
question was determinable and relied upon section 14(i)(c) of the Act
to state that such an agreement cannot be specifically enforced. He
also cited various English Authors to submit that the English Law is the
same as the Indian Law on the subject. He relied upon the decision in

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 21 of 32

Rajasthan Breweries Ltd v. Stroh Brewery Co., AIR 2000 Delhi
450 to submit that even if the termination is mala fide, the agreement
cannot be specifically enforced.
39.

Having considered the rival submissions of the parties, I

am of the view that the ex-parte ad interim injunction granted by this
court on 4th April, 2007, cannot be sustained and the same deserves to
be vacated forthwith.
40.

The distribution agreement entered into by the plaintiff

with Gyrus International Limited, UK, on the face of it, is a
determinable contract. The distribution agreement does not purport to
be an agreement which is to operate perpetuity.

Even the renewal

clause specifically states “however, either party may decide not to
renew this agreement beyond the initial or renewal term”.

The said

clause further states “......... this agreement may be terminated for
cause at any time course in accordance the provisions of paragraph 12
herefor”.
41.

Clause 12 of the agreement gives both parties the right to

terminate the agreement upon written notice upon the occurrence of
the continuencies mentioned therein.

Clause 13 sets out the

procedure for termination of the agreement.
42.

That being the position, under Section 14(1)(c) of the Act,

the distribution agreement in question cannot be specifically enforced.
This means that neither Gyrus International Limited, UK nor defendant

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 22 of 32

nos. 1 to 9 can be compelled by a decree or order of this Court to
honour the said agreement. The said defendants cannot be directed
to make supplies of the equipments, or consumables, or parts to the
plaintiff.

The fall out of the fact, that the distribution agreement is

determinable and therefore not specifically enforceable, is that an
injunction cannot be granted to prevent the breach of the said contract
by virtue of Section 41(e) of the Act which states “An injunction cannot
be granted to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of
which would not be specifically enforced”.
43.

Consequently, the plaintiff may be entitled only to claim

damages for the breach or termination of the distribution agreement,
in case it establishes that the said agreement stood renewed after 26th
September 2006 and that the termination thereof on 9 th May 2007 by
Gyrus International Ltd. UK is illegal.
44.

The argument of the Plaintiff that the Defendant had

waived its right to take action under clause 12(iv) of the distribution
agreement upon the automatic renewal of the distribution agreement
since no notice had been issued during the currency of the contractual
period 2005-06, is falacious. Since the notice for termination under
clause 12(iv), has to relate to the preceding year, such a notice could
obviously not have been given

during the currency of the year to

which it relates, since there would still be time to meet the annual
purchase target set for that year. Such notice obviously has to be

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 23 of 32

issued after the close of the year to which it relates. The contention
that the termination of the distribution agreement on 9 th May, 2007 is
malafide is also of no avail. The termination of the agreement, if it is
held to be illegal, may give rise to claim for damages, which have been
claimed by the plaintiffs in the suit.
45.

In Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (Supra), the Hon'ble

Supreme Court held that the distributorship agreement could not be
said to be for an indefinite period where it was revokable in
accordance with Clauses 27 and 28 thereof.

Section 14(1)(c) was

invoked by the Court and the restoration of the distributorship of the
Respondent, even on a finding that the breach of the agreement was
committed by the appellant corporation, was held to be contrary to the
mandate of section 14 (1) of the Specific Relief Act.
46.

In Rajasthan Breweries Limited (supra), the Division

Bench of this Court held that even in the absence of a specific clause
authorizing and enabling either party to terminate the agreement in
the event of happening of the events specified therein, from the very
nature of the agreement, which is a private commercial transaction,
the same could be terminated even without assigning any reason, by
serving reasonable notice. At the most, in case ultimately it is found
that the termination was bad, illegal or contrary to the terms of the
agreement, or the understanding between the parties or for any other
reason, the remedy of the aggrieved party would be to seek

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 24 of 32

compensation for wrongful termination, but it could not claim specific
performance of the agreement.

Such an injunction is statutorily

prohibited in view of Section 14(1)(c) read with Section 41 of the
Specific Relief Act.
47.

The Hon'ble Division Bench cited with approval another

decision of this Court in M/s. Classic Motors Ltd. vs. M/s. Maruti
Udyog Ltd. (1997) 65 DLT 166.

Another decision of this Court

reported as M/s. Jai Drinks Pvt. Ltd. vs. Pepsi Foods Ltd. 1996 (1)
AD (Delhi) 1097 also follows the same principle while relying on the
decision in Classic Motors Ltd. (Supra).
48.

The law in England and Wales, which governs the

distribution agreement between the parties also appears to be no
different from the Indian Law on the subject.

Farnsworth on

Contracts, Second Edition, Vol.III at page 165 states:
“........A court will not order a performance that has
become impossible, unreasonably burdensome, or
unlawful, nor will it issue an order that can be
frustrated by the defendant through exercise of a
power of termination or otherwise.”
49.

Chitty on Contracts, Twenty Nineth Edition, Vol.I at page

1543 states:
“If a contract is expressed to be revocable by the
party against whom an order of specific performance
is sought, the order will be refused as the defendant
could render it nugatory by exercising his power to
terminate.”

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 25 of 32

50.

Similarly, Halsbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition,

Vol.44(I) in paragraph 818 states:

51.

“Specific performance is not decreed if the defendant
would be entitled to revoke or dissolve a contract
when executed, as in the case of a contract
containing an express power of revocation, since it
would be idle to do that which might instantly be
undone by one of the parties.”
Therefore, the only issue is whether the plaintiff is entitled,

under Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, to the relief of injunction to
perform

the

negative

agreement

contained

in

the

distribution

agreement, i.e, to preserve the exclusivity of distributorship of the
plaintiff under Clause 2 of the distribution agreement.
52.

In my view, the plaintiff has not made out a case for grant

of an injunction to perform the aforesaid negative agreement, since:
(i) it cannot be said, prima facie, at this stage that the
distribution agreement stood automatically renewed
for a period of one year on 27th September, 2006 after
the expiry of the initial period of two years;
(ii) the said agreement has, in any event, been terminated
on the 9th May 2007 and;
(iii) the plaintiff is itself guilty of failure to perform its
obligations under the Distribution Agreement.
53.

I find force in submission of the defendants that as a pre

requisite for the renewal of the distribution agreement, it was
imperative that “the parties shall agree upon a new annual purchase

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 26 of 32

target for the next year of the agreement no later than three (3)
months prior to the expiration of the contract term then in progress”.
This stipulation is couched in mandatory terms since the parties have
used the word “Shall” which normally connotes that the compliance
with the term is mandatory. There is nothing pointed out by the
plaintiffs from the terms of the agreement that the parties intended to
read “shall” as “may”. The defendants are right in contending that
without an annual purchase target having been agreed upon for the
renewal term, the agreement between the parties for the renewal
period would remain ineffective and un-enforceable. The defendant is
the manufacturer and supplier of the specialised equipments and
products mentioned in the agreement. It is only fair that in return for
grant for the exclusive rights to distribute their products in the large
territory earmarked under the agreement, there should be a definite
commitment to make annual purchase of the specified value by the
distributor.

By agreeing to appoint an exclusive distributor for the

territory, the defendants agreed to give up their right to deal with any
other party. It cannot be that the distributor who claims the valuable
privilege of exclusivity, would not commit itself to a minimum annual
purchase target. The importance of the annual purchase target can
also be assessed by the fact that the failure to achieve the same gives
the defendants the right to terminate the agreement.
54.

The interpretation of the distribution agreement, as put

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 27 of 32

forward by the plaintiff, to my mind, is most unreasonable and would
lead to absurd results. I do not agree that even if the parties do not
specifically agree to set a fresh annual purchase target for the renewal
year, the implication is that they agreed to continue with the target
that was set for the previous year. Such an implication is not borne out
from the terms of the Distribution Agreement, which requires a fresh
annual purchase target to be set by the parties, much in advance of
the expiry of the term of the agreement, and also by the fact that even
for the first two years, the targets set were different. Any business
enterprise cannot be expected to be satisfied with stagnation of its
business/turnover and one would normally expect, in keeping with the
trend for the first two years, that the fresh annual purchase targets for
the later years would be successively higher.
55.

Now coming to the facts of this case, admittedly the

plaintiff miserably failed to meet their annual purchase targets for the
first two years under the distribution agreement.

This is evident from

the various e-mail communications sent by the plaintiff, relied upon by
the defendants. In the background of the dismal performance of the
plaintiff in the first two years, and I am not going into the reasons for
the same, it appears that the parties realised that the agreement is
not working as planned and neither of them appear to have seen any
point in even discussing the annual purchase target for the next year
beginning 27th September, 2006. From the communication dated 2nd

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 28 of 32

August 2006 it is evident that even before the expiry of the initial term
of the distribution agreement on 26th September 2006, the Plaintiff had
sensed that the said distribution agreement was not to be renewed by
Gyrus International Ltd.
56.

In my view, the defendants are right in their submission

that the distribution agreement did not stand automatically renewed
on 27th September, 2006 since the annual purchase target for the
renewal period was not agreed upon between the contracting parties
at any point of time before the expiry of the initial distribution
agreement.
57.

I do not see any force in the arguments of the plaintiffs

that from a reading of the e-mail communication dated 3rd January,
2007 of the defendants to the plaintiff, it appears that the defendants
did not consider the distribution agreement as having expired on 26th
September, 2006. The said communication has to be seen in the light
of the fact that another competitor of defendant nos. 1 to 9, namely,
ACMI, had emerged with it to offer a wider range products in the
region including India. In that context, it appears the defendants sent
a communication to the plaintiff on 3rd January, 2007. There is nothing
to suggest in that communication of the defendants, that the
defendants understood the distribution agreement in question to be
subsisting, or that the defendants offered a wider range of products to
the plaintiff for distribution under the distribution agreement in

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 29 of 32

question.
58.

From the correspondence placed on record, it also appears

that there was nothing clandestine about defendant nos. 1 to 9 dealing
with defendant nos. 10 to 12.

In fact, it was the plaintiff who

advocated the cause of defendant nos. 10 to 12 for being appointed as
a co-distributor. It also appears that the plaintiff and defendant nos.
10 to 12 were working in tandem and in fact the plaintiff was
introduced to defendant no. 8 by defendant nos. 10 to 12, as is evident
from the email communication dated 29th December 2006 of the
plaintiff.
59.

The

e-mail

communications

exchanged

between

the

defendant nos. 1 to 9 on one hand and defendant nos. 10 to 12 on the
other hand relied upon by the plaintiff only shows that they
apprehended some resistance and legal action from the plaintiff to the
formalization of their, inter se, arrangements.

Obviously, those

apprehensions were well founded since the plaintiff has indeed
instituted these proceedings.

However, it does not follow from a

reading of those communications dated 11th September, 2006 that the
defendants were in breach of the distribution agreement then in force.
There was nothing wrong in defendant nos. 1 to 9 talking to other
potential distributors for their products in India, once they had decided
not to renew the distribution agreement with the plaintiff. It is not the
plaintiff's case that the defendant nos. 1 to 9 on the one hand and

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 30 of 32

defendant nos. 10 to 12 on the other hand, entered into a distribution
agreement before the expiry of the distribution agreement in question
on 26th September, 2006.
60.

Assuming

that

the

distribution

agreement

stood

automatically renewed as contended by the plaintiff, the plaintiff
cannot rely upon Section 42 of the Act also for the reason that
admittedly it has failed to perform its obligations under the contract.
The plaintiff has failed to meet the annual purchase targets in the first
two years of the agreement. Obviously, the plaintiff cannot seek to
restrain the defendants, to enforce the negative agreement while at
the same time itself failing to perform its own obligations thereunder.
61.

Another important aspect to be noticed is that the

defendants have admittedly terminated the distribution agreement on
9th May, 2007.

That being the position, the distribution agreement

certainly cannot be enforced or reinstated through the instrumentality
of the Court.
62.

In the facts of this case, the ratio of the judgment of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in Gujarat Bottling Company and Ors.
(Supra) has no application.
63.

As recorded hereinabove, the defendants have undertaken

to maintain and furnish complete account of the transactions
undertaken by them in relation to the products in question, within the
territory in question, after 27th September, 2006, in the event of it

IA Nos. 4072/07, 5687 & 5689/07 in CS(OS)650/2007

Page 31 of 32

being held that the distribution agreement stood automatically
renewed, and that the termination thereof by the defendants was
wrongful.

The defendants would be bound by that aforesaid

undertaking.
64.

For

the

reasons

aforesaid,

I

dismiss

the

plaintiff's

application being IA No. 4072/2007 and allow the defendants'
application being IA nos. 5687/2007 and 5689/2007.
