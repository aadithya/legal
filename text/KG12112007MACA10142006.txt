KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
Even on the last date, nobody was present for
respondent No.3 New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Respondent No.3
is proceeded ex-parte. Since respondent No.3 has not shown any
interest to contest the present appeal, therefore, the present
appeal is taken up for final hearing.
The present appeal is preferred against the award
MAC. App. No. 1014-16/2006

dated 23.8.2006 of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. The brief
facts of the case are that:
On 14.5.2005 at about 8.45 a.m., Shri Bhagwan Dass
was travelling on his cycle and when he reached and stopped at
the red light of Vidya Marg, Pankha Orad Crossing, a bus bearing
registration No. DL 1P 1146, being driven by respondent No.1,
came from behind at a very high speed in a rash and negligent
manner and hit Shri Bhagwan Dass, as a result of such a forceful
impact, he fell on the road and received fatal injuries.

A claim

petition was filed on 28.5.2005 and award was passed by the
learned Motor Accident Claims Tribunal on 23.8.2006. Aggrieved
with the said award the present appeal is filed by the appellants.
Mr.O.P. Mannie, counsel for the appellant states that
the appellant is aggrieved only on account of the fact that the
Tribunal has not taken into consideration the future cost
neutralization factor although the minimum wages of unskilled
worker as fixed under the Minimum Wages Act for the relevant
period were taken into consideration.

The appellant is also

aggrieved due to the fact that the Tribunal has granted a meagre
amount of Rs.5,000/- towards loss of consortium. Counsel for the
appellant contends that since the deceased is survived by his
MAC. App. No. 1014-16/2006

Page 2 of 6

widow of a very young age besides his minor son and grown up
daughter, therefore, minimum amount of Rs.50,000/- should have
been awarded towards loss of consortium.
I have heard learned counsel for the appellant and
perused the records.

The deceased in the present case was

working as a daily wager in the MCD and, therefore, the Tribunal
referred to the wages under the Minimum Wages Act for
determining the income of the deceased at Rs.3,100/-. The date
of accident in the present case is 14.5.2005 and as per the
minimum wages, the applicable wages for unskilled labourer in
May 2005 were Rs.3044.90 which were taken by the Tribunal as
Rs.3,100/-. The Tribunal has not applied the criteria laid down in
Sarla Dixit Vs.Balwant Yadav & Ors., 1996 ACJ 581 (SC) in
view of the judgment of the Apex Court reported in Bijoy Kumar
Dugar Vs. Bidya Dhar Dutta, (2006) 3 SCC 242. However, this
Court has already taken a view that the future prospects cannot
be treated at par with increase in minimum wages as fixed under
the Minimum Wages Act. The increase in minimum wages for the
reason that the inflation eats the purchasing power of the rupee
and to neutralise the falling power of rupee wages are increased .
The increase in the minimum wages are revised by the
MAC. App. No. 1014-16/2006

Page 3 of 6

Government keeping in view the inflationary trends and cost
index and, therefore, the increase in minimum wages are required
for a person to sustain himself at the minimum level of
subsistence. Since the accident in the present case had occurred
on 14.05.2005 and the multiplier of 11 has been applied,
therefore, the wages that the deceased would have earned for
this period of 11 years has to be taken into consideration. The
said 11 years period from the date of accident would expire in the
year 2016. Therefore, the increase in index for the past 10 years
can be taken into consideration. Counsel for the appellant after
referring to the Minimum Wages Act states that minimum wages
for unskilled worker as on 01.02.1995 were Rs.1,495/- and after a
period of 10 years, they became double to the said amount i.e.
Rs.3044.90. Since the minimum wages have doubled in the past
10 years as per the Minimum Wages Act, therefore, safely the said
increase at least can be taken in view as a future increase of
double Minimum Wages under the Minimum Wages Act. The said
wages of Rs.3,044.90/- which have been taken into consideration
as Rs.3,100/- for the year 2005 would come to Rs.6,200/- and
taking an average of the same, the monthly income of the
deceased would come to Rs.4,650/- p.m.
MAC. App. No. 1014-16/2006

Deducting 1/3rd

expenses from the same, the average monthly dependancy would
come to Rs.3,100/- per month and annual dependancy would
come out as Rs.37,200/- and after the same is multiplied by the
multiplier of 11, the total yearly loss of dependancy of the
appellant

would

come

to

Rs.4,09,200/-.

Accordingly

the

compensation towards the loss of dependancy stands enhanced
from Rs.2,72,800/- to Rs.4,09,200/-.
On the second contention of counsel for the appellant, I
also find myself in agreement with counsel for the appellant that a
very meagre amount of Rs.5,000/- has been awarded by the
Tribunal towards loss of consortium.

In the judgment cited by

counsel for the appellant in Mohinder Kaur & Ors. Vs. Hira
Nand Sindhi (Ghoriwala) & Anr., 2007 ACJ 2123, the Supreme
Court has upheld the decision of the High Court and granted
Rs.50,000/- for loss of consortium. Since the High Court did not
grant the interest on the said amount, therefore, the matter was
taken by the claimants to the Apex Court in Special Leave
Petition. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has not only upheld the said
amount towards loss of consortium but has also awarded interest
at the rate of 9% p.a. on the said amount from the date of filing of
the petition.

In view of the said decision of the Hon'ble Supreme

MAC. App. No. 1014-16/2006

Page 5 of 6

Court, I enhance the said amount to Rs.50,000/-. Accordingly the
said amount of Rs.5,000/- towards loss of consortium stands
enhanced to Rs.50,000/- which shall be paid by the respondents
jointly and severally along with interest at the rate of 7.5% p.a. on
the differential amount from the date of filing of the petition till
realization. Counsel for the appellant states that respondent No.3
has already complied with the impugned award. Respondent No.3
shall be liable to pay the differential amount of Rs.1,81,400/towards the loss of dependancy in addition to the amount of
Rs.2,92,800/- already paid by respondent No.3. In addition to the
said amount, respondent No.3 shall also be liable to pay an
additional amount of Rs.45,000/- towards loss of consortium.
Both the said differential amounts shall be paid by respondent
No.3 along with upto date interest at the rate of 7.5% from the
date of filing of the petition till final realisation.
With these directions, the appeal stands disposed of.
