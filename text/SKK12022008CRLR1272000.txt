SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J. (ORAL)

1.

The petitioner runs a shop under the name and style

of M/s Good Luck Salt Company behind Shadipur Depot,
New

Delhi

as

a

proprietor-cum-manufacturer

of

food

articles. On a visit of the food Inspector at the premises of
the petitioner, two samples of iodized salt were taken which
Crl.Rev.P.127/2000 and Crl.Rev.P.128/2000

Page 1 of 5

were found to contain low iodine content as also matters
soluble in water other than NaCl. The samples were taken
of the brand Swastic manufactured by the Gagan Salt
Company of which the petitioner was the seller.

The

complaint was lodged against the petitioner and after
framing of charges and recording of evidence, the petitioner
was found guilty of violation of provisions of Section 2
(ia)(a)(m) and rule 32 (e)(f) r/w Section 7/16 of the
Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (‘PFA Act’ for
short) by the order dated 09.01.1992.
2.

The order of sentence was pronounced on 15.01.1992

whereby the petitioner was sentenced to undergo RI for six
months and to pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- and in default further
six months RI.
3.

The petitioner aggrieved by the said order, filed an

appeal before the learned Addl.Sessions Judge and the said
appeal was dismissed by the order dated 22.03.2000. The
petitioner now seeks to challenge both the aforesaid orders.
4.

Learned

counsel

for

the

petitioner

confines

his

submissions to grant of benefit to the petitioner under the
Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 (‘the said Act’ for short)
and contends that the petitioner has already undergone
sentence of one month and has deposited the fine.

It is

stated that the petitioner is 67 years old and has undergone
protracted trial and further appeals and revisions and is no
more in the said business.

It is stated that the petitioner

Crl.Rev.P.127/2000 and Crl.Rev.P.128/2000

Page 2 of 5

was only a seller of the brand and there is no prior criminal
antecedents of the petitioner nor has the petitioner been
found to be indulging in any such similar offences after the
alleged commission of offence and that the report of the
Probation Officer has been called, which is not adverse to
the petitioner.
5.

Learned counsel in support of his contention has relied

upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Isher Das v. The
State of Punjab; AIR 1972 SC 1295 where it has been held
that the provisions of the said Act apply to offences under
the PFA Act.
6.

Learned Addl.P.P. for the State, on the other hand,

contends that in case of prosecution under the PFA Act, the
benefit cannot be granted under the said Act and in that
behalf has relied upon the judgment of the erstwhile
Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court in Pyarali
K.Tejani v. Mahadeo Ramchandra Dange and Ors; 1974 SCC
(Cri) 87, more specifically, what is observed in para 30,
which is as under:
“30. The finale in every criminal trial is
sentence.
Let us take stock of the
social and personal facts, the features
of the crime and the culprit.
The
Prevention of Food Adulteration act,
1954 is meant to save society and
Parliament
has
by
repeated
amendments emphasized the statutory
determination to stamp out food
offences by severe sentences. Indeed,
dissatisfied with the indulgent exercise
of judicial discretion, the Legislature has
deprived the Court of its power to be
lenient. In the light of escalating food
Crl.Rev.P.127/2000 and Crl.Rev.P.128/2000

Page 3 of 5

adulteration this is understandable.
Even so, there are violations and
violations. Scented supari is neither is a
staple diet nor popular with the poor,
being an expensive item.
Nor is
saccharin poisonous but prohibited
more as a precaution. That may be the
reason for the prosecution not leading
evidence of its injuries properties. The
circular bearing on saccharin in supari,
though irrelevant to nullify the Rule,
suggest that it is not so grave a danger
and may, perhaps be permitted again.
Cyclamate stands on a somewhat
different footing, although in a practical
sense, the menace to health from it is
not too serious except where unusually
massive doses are consumed.
The
accused’ non knowledge has been
rejected by us but he alleges that he
has retired from the firm.
He has
undergone a week in jail and is not
known to be a repeater.”
7.

A perusal of the aforesaid observations, in my

considered view, shows that the Constitution Bench has not
taken the view that the provisions of the said Act do not
apply to a conviction under the PFA Act, but has taken a
larger intent of the PFA Act which is meant to save the
society from the menace of adulterated food items.
Similarly, it has been observed that there are ‘violations and
violations’ and thus the nature of violation would be
material.
8.

Learned counsel has also relied upon the judgment of

the Apex

Court in

Delhi Administration v. Manohar Lal;

2002 IV AD (Cr.) S.C.244 where the decision of this Court to
commute the sentence by directing the Government to
formulize the order was held not to be in accordance with
Crl.Rev.P.127/2000 and Crl.Rev.P.128/2000

Page 4 of 5

law since the exercise of power under Section 433 of the
Code

of

Criminal

Procedure,

1973

vested

with

the

Government. It was held that a mandatory direction to the
government with no discretion or liberty left with it, except
to formalize the same, on payment of fine, could not be
sustainable.
9.

In the present case, as noticed above, the allegation is

of lower iodine content and the presence of matters soluble
in water other than NaCl in respect of the salt sample sold
by the petitioner though not manufactured by him.

The

petitioner has no prior or past antecedents and otherwise is
manufacturing his own products under his brand name.
The petitioner has undergone sentence of one month and
has further paid the fine.
10.

In the given facts and circumstances of the case, I am

of the considered view that the benefit under the said Act
should be made available to the petitioner in view of the
Isher Das v. The State of Punjab’s case (supra).

The

petitioner will furnish a personal bond for good conduct in
the sum of Rs.25,000/- for a period of one year with one
surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial
Court and the benefit be consequently extended to the
petitioner under Sections 3 and 4 of the said Act.
11.

The petitions stand disposed of.
