1. The present Appeal has been filed by Mr. Joginder Singh (hereinafter
referred to as the appellant, for short) against the Order dated 16

th

March, 2006 passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing his
application for amendment of the written statement under Order VI,
Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to
as the Code, for short). By the said amendment application, the
appellant wanted to incorporate the following sentence in paragraph
7 of the preliminary objections and paragraph 24 of the reply on
merits:“That the market value of the properties even
at the time of filing of the suit on 19.08.2001
of Lajpat Nagar Property was of Rs.1 crore
and Sarojini Nagar Property was of Rs.3
crore. The plaintiff was suppose to pay court
on both these properties on Rs.4 crore and
not as Rs.33/- only.”
2. Learned Single Judge has dismissed the said application on two
grounds. Firstly, it was observed that the application was not
maintainable in view of the proviso to Order VI, Rule 17 incorporated

FAO(OS) 310/2006

Page 3

by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002 (hereinafter
referred to as the Amending Act of 2002, for short) which came into
st

force w.e.f. 1 July, 2002. Secondly, there was delay in filing of the
application as the same was filed nearly after four years.
3. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and examined the
records and pleading brought to our notice.
4. The Supreme Court in the case of State Bank of Hyderabad versus
Town Municipal Council reported in 2006 (13) SCALE 332 has
examined the proviso to Order VI, Rule 17 of the Amending Act of
2002. In view of Section 16(2) of the Amending Act of 2002, it has
been held that the said proviso will not be applicable to any pleading
filed before the commencement of Section 16 of the Code of Civil
Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the
Amending Act of 1999, for short). The amending Act of 1999
commenced and came into force on 01.07.2002. In the present case,
written statement was filed in May, 2002 i.e. before the Amending Act

FAO(OS) 310/2006

Page 4

of 1999 had come into force. Therefore, the proviso under Order VI,
Rule 17 of the Amending Act of 2002 does not apply. In view of the
above, we have to examine whether the amendment is justified and
permitted as per law under the unamended provisions of Order VI,
Rule 17 of the Code.
5. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the amendment
sought in the written statement is merely clarificatory in nature and
objections with regard to the valuation of the suit property had
already been raised in the written statement. He made reference to
paragraph 7 of the preliminary objections and paragraph 24 of the
reply on merits.
6. As per the plaint, two immovable properties, subject matter of the
suit, have been valued at Rs.18,48,400/- and Rs.43,47,000/respectively. The plea taken in paragraph 7 of the preliminary
objections of the written statement, is that the plaintiff is not in actual
physical possession of both the properties and therefore he is liable

FAO(OS) 310/2006

Page 5

to pay ad valorem court fees. The appellant did not dispute the
market valuation of the two properties. Similarly, in the reply to
paragraph 24 of the plaint, relating to valuation and court fees, no
objection with regard to valuation of the suit properties is raised. The
contents of paragraph 24 of the plaint were vaguely denied in the
written statement. The denial is not specific as required under law.
7. It is apparent that the appellant who is in possession of the properties
is deliberately trying to delay the proceedings as noticed by the
learned Single Judge.
8. It may be relevant to state here that the respondents herein, namely
the plaintiff and the defendants 2 and 3 before the learned Single
Judge have already filed their affidavits by way of evidence. It is the
case of the plaintiff and the said defendants that their father late Mr.
Gurbachan Singh had left behind several properties which were
inherited by all of them and therefore the suit for partition has been
filed on the ground that each one of them has right, title and interest

FAO(OS) 310/2006

Page 6

in the property of late Mr.Gurbhachan Singh to the extent of 1/4

th

each. The application for amendment of the written statement was
filed by defendant no.1-the appellant herein, when the matter was
already fixed for cross-examination of the witnesses by the plaintiff
and the defendants 2 and 3, the respondents herein. It is clear from
the original written statement of the appellants that he had accepted
the market value of the properties as disclosed and stated in the
plaint. By now questioning and challenging the market value in the
amendment application, the appellant wants to set back the clock by
more than four years and raise issues which were never disputed
and challenged by him in the original written statement. In fact in the
original written statement the appellant admitted the market value as
disclosed. Amendment, if allowed, will require framing of additional
issues, filing of fresh affidavits

by way of evidence and more

witnesses being produced in support and against the plea of the
market value of the properties. This will considerably delay the trial.

The object and purpose of the amendment application therefore is to
prolong and prevent expeditious disposal and decision of the suit.
The application has been filed with a malafide motive and intention.
9. Power of amendment no doubt is wide but like all discretionary
powers, has to be exercised with care and caution balancing equities
and for doing justice to both the parties. An application for
amendment moved in bad faith just to prolong litigation, create
obstacles and cobwebs should be rejected. Leniency in such
circumstances rather than serving cause of justice, causes delay and
increases backlog of cases. What the appellant seeks by the
amendment, is to virtually withdraw his admission regarding the market
value of the properties and raise objection to the same. Admissions can

be explained but on justifiable, good grounds and on cause being
explained, why earlier a different statement was made. No reason or
cause for moving application for amendment has been given nor it is
explained why initially objection with regard to the market value of the

FAO(OS) 310/2006

Page 8

properties could not be taken, specially when the market value of the
properties were fixed by the plaintiff not on the basis of whole figures.

Property no. 6, K-Block, Lajpat Nagar was valued at Rs.18,48,000/and property no. 198, Sarojini Nagar was valued at Rs.43,47,000/-.
The appellant in the amendment application without disclosing any
ground as to why no objection to valuation was earlier raised, now
claims that the market value of the said two properties as on the date
th

of filing of the suit on 19 August, 2001 was Rs.1 crore and Rs.3
crores respectively.
10.In view of the above, we find no merit in the present Appeal and
accordingly the same is dismissed. No costs.
