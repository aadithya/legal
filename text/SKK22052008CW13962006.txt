Rule DB.

2.

At the request of the learned counsels for the parties, the
petition is taken up for final disposal.

3.

The petitioner joined the services of the ITBP as a
Constable/GD on 19.11.2002 and is aggrieved by the
action of the respondent in removing him from service on
the ground that he had given false information at the

WP (C) No.1396 of 2006

stage of his enrollment while filling up the character
verification form on 14.12.2002.
4.

The petitioner was a witness in a murder case against
one Shri Harkesh Bahadur Singh for murder of the Uncle
of the petitioner.

Shri Harkesh Bahadur Singh made a

complaint on 30.10.2002 to the effect that there was a
murder attempt on him by the petitioner.

On the said

complaint being made, FIR No.315/2002 under Sections
307/504/506 of the IPC was registered at P.S. Lal Ganj,
District Pratap Garh, U.P.

The IO was deputed to

investigate the matter and on investigation found, after
recording of statements of witnesses at the place of
occurrence, that it is the complainant himself who had
fired on himself and got himself injured to get the
complaint against the petitioner registered with the
object of pressurizing the petitioner not to make the
statement in the murder case registered against the
complainant. The closure report was, thus, filed on the
same date.
5.

The complainant, not being satisfied by the closure
report made a representation to the SP for further
investigation and in pursuance to the said request further
investigation was made. On further investigation it was
found that the petitioner had been selected in the ITBP
and his character verification was pending and thus the

WP (C) No.1396 of 2006

Page 2 of 8

complainant was bent upon pressurizing the petitioner
and

his

family

members

to

somehow

not

make

statements against him in order to avoid his conviction.
Thus, a fraudulent, fabricated and manipulated injury
was made by the complainant on himself to register the
criminal case and the IO had properly investigated the
case.

This report was submitted by the Inspector-in-

Charge of the police station.
6.

The aforesaid, thus, put an end to the matter insofar as
the petitioner is concerned and the petitioner got
recruited on 19.11.2002 thereafter and filled in the
character verification form on 14.12.2002. The petitioner
naturally answered in the negative to the following
questions:
“12. (a)
Have
you
ever
been
arrested,
prosecuted, kept under detention or bound
down/fined, convicted by a court of law for any
offence or debarred/disqualified by any Public
Service Commission from appearing at its
examination/selections or debarred from taking any
examination/rusticated by any University or any
other educational authority/Institution?
(b) Is any case pending against you in any court
of law, University or any other educational
authority/Institution at the time of filling up this
Verification Roll.”

7.

The complainant, however, filed a protest petition before
the court of CJM against the closure report and in terms
of an order dated 26.2.2003, the CJM deemed it
appropriate to issue summons to the petitioner as prima

WP (C) No.1396 of 2006

Page 3 of 8

facie he found that there was material to carry out a trial.
The next date fixed was 16.6.2003 when the petitioner
appeared and after trial the petitioner has been acquitted
in terms of order dated 15.12.2006.
8.

The complainant Harkesh Bahadur Singh not only filed
the protest petition but made a complaint to the ITBP
that there was a criminal case pending against the
petitioner and the respondents deemed it appropriate to
act in pursuance to the complaint. A show cause notice
dated 31.3.2004 was served on the petitioner to which
the petitioner filed a reply. Another show cause notice
dated 20.5.2004 was issued to the petitioner to file the
relevant documents and thereafter vide order dated
12.6.2004 the services of the petitioner had been
terminated on the ground that he had wrongly answered
in the negative against the aforesaid columns/questions.
The petitioner filed a statutory appeal which has been
rejected by the appellate authority on 6.9.2005.

The

petitioner has thereafter approached this Court.
9.

We have heard learned counsels for the parties. There is
no

and

another

judgement of a Division Bench of this Court in WP (C)
No.1446/2003 titled Harnarain Vs.

UOI decided on

12.12.2007. In fact, no judgements were really required
for the said proposition as the proposition itself is not
disputed. Learned counsel also sought to emphasise that
the subsequent acquittal of the petitioner would not
justify a false declaration being made. Once again there
is no dispute about this proposition.
10.

The only question to be considered is as to whether on
the

date

when

the

petitioner

filled

the

character

verification form on 14.12.2002 it can be said that the
petitioner had furnished wrong information against the
columns/questions mentioned aforesaid.

The petitioner

has never been arrested, kept under detention or fined
as on that date. No case was pending in any court of law
against the petitioner nor was the petitioner prosecuted.
All that has happened was that on a false complaint
being made by Shri Harkesh Bahadur Singh, the FIR was
registered (which naturally had to be so registered) and a
closure report was filed on the same date on 30.10.2002.
WP (C) No.1396 of 2006

Page 5 of 8

The request for further investigation made by the
complainant to the SP also resulted in reaffirmation of
the closure report on 14.11.2002. Thus, on the date of
filling of the form nothing was pending against the
petitioner.

The petitioner would be unaware of the FIR

registered against him and in any case the FIR is nothing
else but a statement of fact on the allegations made by
none other than the person who apprehended deposition
against him in a murder case. On investigation the case
was found to be false.
11.

It is only when the closure report was filed before the
court of CJM and a protest petition was filed by the
petitioner that the CJM in his wisdom decided to issue
summons on 26.2.2003. The said date is after the form
was filled in. The occasion for the petitioner to come to
know of the pendency of any case against him only arose
when he received the summons issued by the CJM on
26.2.2003 returnable on 16.6.2003.

12.

In view of the aforesaid it can hardly be said that there
was any case pending against the petitioner or that he
made any false declaration which would give occasion to
the respondents to terminate his services.

13.

No doubt the subsequent acquittal of the petitioner
would not justify a false declaration being made but we
are constrained to note that the complainant (accused in

WP (C) No.1396 of 2006

Page 6 of 8

a murder case) has succeeded in his endeavour, thanks
to the respondents. He first filed a false complaint and
kept on prosecuting the false complaint.

The report of

the In-charge of the police station on re-investigation
shows that the object was to see that the petitioner did
not get recruited in the ITBP in case he insisted on being
a witness in a murder case against the complainant. It is
the Uncle of the petitioner who had been murdered. The
given facts of the case which were brought to the notice
of the authorities of the respondents should have made
them even more cautious while taking such a decision
but the respondents threw the caution to the wind while
deciding to terminate the services of the petitioner.
14.

In an age where endeavour is made for witness
protection programme witnesses like the petitioner have
been made to suffer by the conduct of the respondents.

15.

The petitioner has unnecessary suffered on account of
the illegal and arbitrary action of the respondents and is
liable to be restored to service with all consequential
benefits.

16.

A writ of mandamus is issued quashing the orders dated
12.6.2004 and 6.9.2005 and the petitioner is directed to
be restored to the service with all consequential benefits
including back wages within a period of two (2) months
from today.

In the given facts of the case we also consider it
appropriate to impose costs on the respondents of
Rs.5,000.00.

18.

Petition stands allowed in the aforesaid terms.

19.

In view of the orders passed in the petition, the
applications do not survive for consideration and are
accordingly disposed of.
