This is an application seeking leave to defendant. One of the

points raised by the learned counsel for the defendant is that the suit
itself is barred by time. It was contended by the learned counsel that the
disbursement of the loan by the plaintiff to the defendant No.1 was
completed on 20.06.1997. It is an admitted position that the last payment
made by the defendant No.1 to the plaintiff by way of repayment of the
loan was made on 25.01.2001. Consequently, the period of limitation

Page No.1 of 6

starts from 25.01.2001. Three years taken from that date would end on
25.01.2004.

The present suit has been filed on 04.04.2005.

Consequently, it is contended that the suit is beyond the period of three
years and is, therefore, barred. In response, the learned counsel for the
plaintiff submitted that on 15.04.2004, a letter was written by the
defendants to the plaintiff wherein they have acknowledged the liability
under the loan and they have agreed to repay the principal amount of
loan, subject to certain conditions which they indicated in the said letter.
The material portion of the letter reads as under:“After looking into this current scenario, we concluded
& still we are determined to repay the loan component
provided following relaxations are granted to us by
RMK:➔

➔

➔

Accrued interest & penal interest must be
waived.
Deferment period be extended at least for 3
years with quarterly instalments.
De-list from the defaulter list & the funding
agencies be informed in order to ensure normal
funding so that financial health of the
organisation be regained & boost up the
capacity to repay the RMK loan easily.

If above relaxations are granted by RMK
generously, INRECA Sansthan assuring repayment of
over-dues without fail. Not only the over-due would
be settled by doing so; glorious past of this NGO
would be restored where 100 odds dependents be
survived & blessed.”

In response to this letter, the plaintiff replied by a letter dated

06.05.2004 which was to the following effect:“RMK/GUJ/04/3922

The President
INRECA (International Rural Educational &
Cultural Association)
Inreca Complex
Rajpipla Road
Dediapada-393 040
Dist.:-Narmada, Gujarat
Sub: Submission of acknowledged statement of
loan account.
Sir,
We have received your letter no. IN / RMK/
Overdue/04/145 dated 15th April, 2004 requested for
extending relief in interest, penal interest etc. as the
state was affected by flood, cyclone, earth quake &
riots etc. at different periods. In this regard, we have
to inform you that Rashtriya Mahila Kosh does not
have any provision for giving concession in interest or
penal interest as per the terms of sanction. However,
your proposal for rephasement of loan can be put up to
appropriate authority only after getting related
documents from State Government / Central
Government regarding floods / cyclones / earth quake
and other communal riots as declared by them in
different years. You are also requested to submit all
the statement of accounts submitted to you by RMK at
different times which should be properly
acknowledged by Chief Functionary of the
organisation with seal and signature.
Hope the documents / information
mentioned above should be submitted by your
organisation as quick as possible to take further action
on the matter.

Thereafter, there is no further correspondence on this issue,

apart from the demand notice issued by the plaintiff on 31.08.2004,
which preceded the filing of the suit on 04.04.2005.

Even if it is

assumed that the letter dated 15.04.2004 is an acknowledgment of a debt,
it would be of no assistance to the plaintiff because the acknowledgment
came beyond the three year period prescribed under the Limitation Act,
1963. Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963 cannot be invoked because
the acknowledgment is not within the period of limitation. The learned
counsel for the plaintiff then pointed to the provisions of Section 25 (3)
of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (hereinafter referred to as 'the said Act')
to submit that the letter amounted to a promise and, therefore, was a
contract in itself. He submitted that there is a distinction between an
acknowledgment under Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963 and a
contract under Section 25 (3) of the said Act. He placed reliance on the
following decisions:i)

Tulsi Ram v. Same Singh: AIR 1981 Delhi 165;

ii)

In Re: Business Forms Ltd. And Ashoka Agencies: AIR
1996 Cal. 153;

N. Ethirajulu Naidu v. K.R. Chinnikrishnan Chettiar:
AIR 1975 Madras 333.”

After examining the arguments advanced by the counsel for

the parties, I am of the view that although the plaintiff has made out a
prima facie case for a suit based on a contract under Section 25 (3) of the
said Act, it has also to be considered as to whether the same can be
conclusively held to be a contract under Section 25 (3) of the said Act.
This is so because the learned counsel for the defendant had pointed out
that the letter dated 15.04.2004 was not an unconditional promise, but
was a conditional offer / proposal extended by the defendants. The
conditions were not accepted by the plaintiff and, therefore, it cannot be
said that there was a resultant promise. He made the submissions in the
context of the provisions of Section 2 of the said Act which defines the
expressions “proposal” and “promise”.

5.

Considering the arguments advanced by the counsel for both

the parties, the issue is debatable. This being the case, in view of the
decisions of the Supreme Court and, particularly in the case of Uma

Shankar Kamal Narain & Another v. M.D. Overseas Ltd: 2007 (4)
SCC 133, the defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to defend.
This application is, therefore, allowed.
