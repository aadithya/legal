KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
The present appeal is preferred against the Award of the
Motor Accident Claims Tribunal dated 7.4.2004.
Brief facts of the present appeal are that Shri Dharampal
Gupta, aged about 60 years, along with his wife Smt. Veena
Gupta, aged about 53 years, their son, Shri Rahul Gupta, aged
about 29 years and daughter-in-law, Smt. Raj Shree Gupta at

pages 1 of 5

about 10.00 a.m. on 22.6.1997 met with an accident on G.T.
Road, Muzaffar Nagar, Roorkee Road, near Falauda, P.S. Purkaji,
Distt. Muzazzaffar Nagar, U.P.

while travelling in a Maruti car

bearing registration No. HR-51 B-1199, and were proceeding from
Delhi to Pondha (Dehradun). A Tata Sumo Car bearing registration
No. UP 15F 3787 came from opposite side being driven at a very
fast speed, rashly and negligently by its driver and truck being
driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner came from the
opposite side on extreme right side of the road and collided with
the car bearing registration No. HR51 B1199, due to forceful
impact the occupants of the car along with the car were thrown
out of the road and Shri. Dharam Pal Gupta and his wife Smt.
Veena Gupta succumbed to their injuries and died on the spot. A
claim petition was filed on 27.3.1998 before the MACT and Award
was made on 7.4.2004. Aggrieved with the said Award the
present appellant/claimant has preferred this appeal.
By way of this appeal, the appellant seeks to challenge the
impugned Award primarily on the ground that the Tribunal has
wrongly assessed the monthly income of the deceased at Rs.
16,000/- per month, although the documents placed on record by
the appellant clearly shows that the deceased was earning Rs.
MAC APP No.500/2004

pages 2 of 5

17,000/- per month towards his salary besides Rs. 500/- per
month towards bonus. To substantiate his arguments the counsel
for the appellant invited my attention to the salary certificate
dated 18th August, 1997 placed on record by the appellant before
the Tribunal, which was also exhibited as Ex. PW 1/34.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have
perused the record. Perusal of the impugned Award evidently
shows that the Tribunal has taken into consideration the salary of
the deceased at Rs.16,000/- per month and has miscalculated the
income of the deceased from Rs. 16,000/- to Rs. 28,000/- per
month. As per Ex. PW 1/34 the gross salary of the deceased for
three months i.e. for April, May and June comes to Rs. 51,000/-.
The said documents also shows that bonus of Rs. 6,000/- for 199697, bonus of Rs. 1500/- for April, 1997 to June, 1997 and ex gratia
amount of Rs. 17,000/- have been added to the three months
salary of the deceased to arrive at a total sum of Rs. 75,500/-. By
dividing the said salary by 1/3rd the amount comes to about Rs.
28,000/- and this higher figure of Rs. 28,000/- possibly led the
Tribunal to disbelieve such a quantum jump in the salary of the
deceased from Rs. 16,000/- to Rs. 28,000/-. There is thus glaring
mistake committed by the Tribunal and, therefore, the Tribunal
MAC APP No.500/2004

pages 3 of 5

has wrongly taken into account the salary of the deceased at Rs.
16,000/-. The appellant never claimed the salary of the deceased
at Rs. 28,000/- per month rather the case set up by the appellant
was that there was increase of about Rs. 1,000/- in his salary i.e.
from Rs. 16,000/- to Rs. 17,000/- per month. Besides the said sum
the deceased was also entitled to a bonus of Rs. 500/- per month
and thus in all the earnings of the deceased were Rs. 17,500/- per
month. Since there is an apparent mistake in the calculation made
by the Tribunal, therefore, I accept the salary of the deceased at
Rs. 17,500/- per month being the last drawn salary on the basis
and strength of Ex. PW 1/34.
In the light of the above discussion, the impugned Award is
modified to the extent of substituting the income of the deceased
from Rs. 16,000/- to Rs. 17,500/- per month. Rest of the Award
passed by the Tribunal would remain the same. The Tribunal shall
carry out the necessary modifications in the Award in compliance
with the above directions.
The parties are directed to appear before the Tribunal on
17th January, 2008.
The recovery rights have already been given to the
respondent insurance company to recover the Award amount
MAC APP No.500/2004

pages 4 of 5

from the owner of the offending vehicle. After the payment of the
present enhanced amount the insurer shall have every right to
recover the same from the owner of the offending vehicle. The
appellant shall be entitled to same rate of interest on the said
enhanced amount as awarded by the Tribunal.
With these directions the appeal is disposed of.
