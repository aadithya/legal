V.B. GUPTA, J.

Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter
referred to as Act) against the order dated 2nd September,

ITA No.914/2006

2005 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi in
ITA(TDS) No.5/Del/2002 for the assessment year 1994-95.
2.

The following substantial question of law has been

framed by us for consideration:-

3.

“Whether the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal was correct in law in holding
that the amount of Rs.1,50,24,000/(termed as security deposit) paid by the
Assessee to its landlord under the
Agreement to Lease dated 10th March,
1995 was not 'rent' as defined in the
Explanation to Section 194-I of the
Income Tax Act, 1961?“
The brief facts of this case are that the Assessee-

company entered into an agreement with M/s ABCO
Footwear Care to take on lease the premises bearing
No.328/1, Village Bijwasan, New Delhi at a monthly rent of
Rs.6,26,000/-.

The lease agreement also provided for

payment of security deposit amounting to Rs.1,50,24,000/which was to be reduced every six months by an amount of
rent which became payable in accordance with the
agreement.

The Assessee deducted tax at source under

Section 194-I of the Act, on the actual payment of rent
made by it.
4.

The Assessing Officer vide his order dated 16th

ITA No.914/2006

Page 2 of

9

March, 2000 held that the amount of security deposit was
nothing but advance rent and hence as per provisions of
Section 194-I of the Act, the Assessee should have deducted
tax at source therefrom and as such he raised a demand of
Rs.7,62,674/- under Section 201(IA) of the Act.
5.

Aggrieved against the order of the Assessing Officer,

the Assessee filed an appeal before the Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) who allowed the appeal of the
Assessee.
6.

Being dissatisfied, the Revenue filed an appeal before

the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to
as Tribunal). The Tribunal vide impugned order held that
the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) was justified in
cancelling the levy of interest and as such upheld the order
of the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals).
7.

It has been argued by learned counsel for the

Appellant that the amount of Rs.1,50,24,000/- paid by way
of security deposit was the advance rent which was agreed
to be adjusted every six months on regular basis by the
amount of rent which became payable

and due

accordance with the terms of the agreement.
ITA No.914/2006

in

Since the

Page 3 of

deposit made by the Assessee was a non-refundable
deposit, it represents the advance consideration for use of
land and building and, therefore, was clearly in the nature
of rent as defined in Section 194-I of the Act.

The

definition of 'rent' defined in the Explanation (i) to Section
194-I of the Act, is wide and includes payment by whatever
name called and paid under any arrangement for use of
land or building and as such there is no justification on the
part of the Assessee for not deducting tax at source.
8.

On the other hand, it has been argued by learned

counsel

for

the

Respondent

that

Clause

14

of

the

agreement provides for the refund of unadjusted portion of
security deposit paid by the Assessee and as such the tax
was not deductable unless the rent has become due to the
landlord.
9.

Section 194-I of the Act which is relevant for deciding

the present controversy, reads as under:“ S.194-I. RentAny person, not being an individual or a
Hindu undivided family, who is responsible
for paying to any person any income by way
of rent, shall, at the time of credit of such
income to the account of the payee or at
the time of payment thereof in cash or by
ITA No.914/2006

Page 4 of

9

the issue of a cheque or draft or by any
other mode, whichever is earlier, deduct
income-tax thereon at the rate of(a)fifteen per cent if the payee is an individual
or a Hindu undivided family; and
(b)twenty per cent, in other case:
Provided that no deduction shall be made
under this section where the amount of
such income or, as the case may be, the
aggregate of the amounts of such income
credited or paid or likely to be credited or
paid during the financial year by the
aforesaid person to the account of, or to,
the payee, does not exceed one hundred
and twenty thousand rupees.
Explanation-For the purposes of this
section,(i)'rent', means any payment, by whatever
name called, under any lease, sub-lease,
tenancy or any other agreement or
arrangement for the use of any land or
any building (including factory building),
together with furniture, fittings, and the
land appurtenant thereto, whether or not
such building is owned by the payee;
(ii) where any income is credited to any
account,
whether
called
'suspense
account or by any other name, in the
books of account of the person liable to
pay such income, such crediting shall be
deemed to be credit of such income to
the account of the payee and the
provisions of this section shall apply
accordingly.”
Clause (i) of the Explanation to Section
194-I coins a definition of the expression 'rent',
so as to mean-any payment, by whatever name called, under
anyITA No.914/2006

Page 5 of

9

-lease,
-sub-lease,
-tenancy or
-any other agreement or arrangement
for the use of any land or any building (including
factory building), together with-furniture,
-fittings and
-the land appurtenant thereto,
whether or not such building is owned by the
payee.
The definition for the purpose of this Act of
the nomenclature rent as expounded in the
Explanation column of section 194-I itself, amply
reveals that the same is projected as the generic
term which includes within the ambit of payment
made on whatsoever account for occupation of a
tenanted portion. After taking into account the
definition of rent, it apparently appears to be a
composite concept.
Once the rent is
comprehended as a composite concept then it is
not capable of being fragmented. The moment
any attempt will be made to have the germane
expression fragmented by splitting up the
amount covered by the rent, it will cease to be
rent and the same will not satisfy the test of the
definition.”
10. The relevant clauses of the lease agreement are
Nos.3 & 14, which read as under:“3.1.The rent for the Premises shall be
Rs.6,26,000/-(Rupees six lacs twenty six
thousand only) per month for the Term of
this lease commencing February 1, 1995.
Unless otherwise agreed the rent shall
become due and payable every six months
in arrears, that is, to say that the first six
months' rent (from February 1, to July 31,
1995) will become due and payable on July
31, 1995 and thereafter the rent will
ITA No.914/2006

Page 6 of

9

become due and payable every six months.
3.2(a)Simultaneously with the execution of the
Agreement REEBOK has paid to ABCO an
amount of Rs.1,50,24,000/-(Rupees one
crore fifty lacs and twenty four thousand
only), subject to mutual agreement
referred to in Clause 3(b) shall be applied
and adjusted as follows:
as Security Deposit which shall stand
reduced every six months when the rent
becomes due and payable in accordance
with Clause 3.1, by an amount of
Rs.25,04,000/- by appropriation of the said
amount of Rs.25,04,000/- towards the rent
due and payable for six months i.e.
Rs.37,56,000. The balance amount i.e.,
Rs.37,56,000/- less Rs.25,04,000/- being
Rs.12,52,000/- shall be paid by REEBOK to
ABCO after deduction at source of any
applicable taxes on the rent due and
payable.
(b) The parties have agreed that they may by
mutual agreement adjust and apply, the
said
amount
of
Rs.1,50,24,000/differently. Unless the parties reach such
an agreement by March 31, 1995, the
provisions of Clause 3.2.(a) shall prevail.”
14.Upon termination of the lease, REEBOK
shall hand over and put ABCO in vacant
possession of the Premises and every part
thereof undisputed as provided in Clause
5(v) hereof and REEBOK shall be obliged
to refund the unadjusted portion if any of
the advance/security deposit paid by
REEBOK under Clause 3.2(a).
Hereof,
failing which ABCO shall be liable to pay
interest thereon at the rate of 18%
(eighteen percent) per annum from the
date REEBOK delivers vacant possession
ITA No.914/2006

11.

to ABCO unto and until the date of
refund.”
A bare reading of clause 3.2(a) shows that the sum of

Rs.1,50,24,000/- paid by the Assessee to ABCO is in the
nature of “advance rent” and not as security deposit as
according to this clause “such security deposit shall stand
reduced every six months when the rent becomes due and
payable.”
12.

If it had been the security amount, then, firstly, it

would have been in the nature of “refundable amount” at
the time of the termination of the lease. Secondly, there
would have been no reduction in the security amount, after
every six months and thirdly, as per clause 14 of the lease
agreement,

the

Assessee

is

“obliged

to

refund

the

unadjusted portion, if any, of advance/security deposit,”
which means that this amount was adjustable against rent
and the same was adjusted also, and thus this amount was
in the nature of advance rent.
13.

Since, this amount paid by the Assessee was not fully

“refundable deposit amount” thus this amount was in fact
the advance rent and as per provision of Section 194-I of
the Act, the Assessee was required to deduct tax at the
ITA No.914/2006

Page 8 of

9

source from the payment of such advance rent at the time
of its assessment.
14.

Accordingly, we hold that Income Tax Appellate

Tribunal was wrong in law in holding that the amount of
Rs.1,50,24,000/- (termed as security deposit) paid by the
Assessee to its landlord under the Agreement to Lease
dated 10th March, 1995 was not 'rent' as defined in the
Explanation to Section 194-I of the Act and, accordingly,
the appeal filed by the Revenue is accepted.
15.

The substantial question of law is answered in the

negative, in favour of the Revenue and against the
Assessee.
