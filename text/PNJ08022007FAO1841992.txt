PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Madan Mohan Saini aged 33 years received fatal injuries in a

road accident on 3.9.87. He died on 8.9.87.
2.

The dependents of the deceased, his widow, 4 daughters

and mother filed a claim petition before the MACT seeking
compensation.

FAO 184/1992

3.

Learned

MACT

awarded

a

total

compensation

of

Rs.3,36,000/- to the dependents of the deceased on account of
death of deceased in the said road accident.
4.

Aggrieved by the amount of compensation awarded under

the award, appellants have filed the present appeal praying for
enhancement of compensation.
5.

Since enhancement of compensation is prayed for and there

are no cross objections, I would only be noting the relevant facts
pertaining to the compensation assessed to the appellants.
6.

Vide award dated 13.7.92, loss of dependence worked out to

the family is Rs. 1,120/- per month. Multiplier of 25 has been
applied noting that the deceased was 33 years of age at the time
of the accident and as he was employed in a government service
he would have continued to support his family for another 25
years. Thus, total loss of dependency to the family assessed by
the Tribunal is Rs. 3,36,000/-. (1120 x 12 x 25).
7.

Counsel for the appellants has urged three main grounds.

Firstly, Tribunal wrongly noted the income of the deceased at the
time of his death as Rs. 1,681/- per month. Secondly, Tribunal has
ignored the future prospects. Thirdly, Tribunal erred in awarding
no compensation to

the appellants

towards non-pecuniary

damages.

8.

As regards the first contention, learned counsel for the

appellants contends that deceased was working as a Sanitary
Inspector in DDA and was drawing a salary of Rs. 1,788/- per
month at the time of his death. In support of his contention,
learned counsel relies upon testimony of Suresh Kumar, PW-1,
who was a colleague of the deceased and deposed that the
deceased was drawing a salary of Rs. 1,788/- per month at the
time of his death.
9.

In arriving at the conclusion that the monthly income of the

deceased at the time of his death was Rs. 1,681/- the Tribunal has
relied upon testimony of S.N. Tripathi, PW-6, who was also
colleague of the deceased and deposed on the basis of cash book,
salary register and pay bill for the month of August 1987 to the
effect that the deceased was drawing gross salary of Rs. 1,682/per month.
10.

In my view the Tribunal rightly determined the income of the

deceased by relying upon testimony of S.N.Tripathi, PW-6 as his
testimony is corroborated by the documents which clearly show
that income of deceased was Rs. 1,681/-p.m. at the time of his
death.
11.

The second submission made by the learned counsel for the

appellants is that while determining the income of the deceased
FAO 184/1992

Page No.3 of 10

at the time of his death the Tribunal erred in ignoring the future
prospects.
12.

Relying upon decision reported as AIR 1996 SC 1274 Smt.

Sarla Dixit & Anr. v Balwant Yadav & Ors and various other
decisions of Supreme Court and this Court, the learned counsel
submitted that

future prospects had to be considered and

granted.
13.

In the appeal, appellants have filed letter dated 27-2-99

(Annexure B) and letter dated 3-5-02 (Annexure D) issued by
DDA, the employer of the deceased. The afore-noted letters show
the salary structure of the deceased and that the deceased would
have received Rs.25,00,321/- during his entire service and that
his last salary would have been Rs.11,230/- p.m.
14.

The question is whether the sum awarded by the Tribunal is

on the lower side as claimed by the appellants.
15.

In a fatal accident action, the accepted measure of damages

awarded to the dependants is the pecuniary loss suffered by them
as a result of the death. 'How much has the widow and family lost
by the death?'
16.

The assessment of damages to compensate the dependants

is beset with difficulties because from the nature of things, it has
to

take

into

FAO 184/1992

account

many

imponderables,

e.g.,

the

life

Page No.4 of 10

expectancy of the deceased and the dependents, the amount that
the deceased would have earned during the remainder of his life,
the amount that he would have contributed to the dependents
during that period, the chances that the deceased may not have
lived or the dependents may not live up to the estimated
remaining period of their life expectancy, the chances that the
deceased might have got better employment or income or might
have lost his employment or income together.
17.

One

of

the

two

methods

adopted

to

determine

compensation in fatal accident actions is the multiplier method
mentioned in Davies v. Powell Duffregn Associated Colliers Ltd,
1942 AC 601.
18.
of

The multiplier method involves the ascertainment of the loss
dependency or

the

multiplicand

having

regard

to

the

circumstances of the case and capitalizing the multiplicand by an
appropriate multiplier. The choice of the multiplier is determined
by the age of the deceased (or that of the claimants whichever is
higher) and by the calculation as to what capital sum, if invested
at a rate of interest applicable to a stable economy, would yield
the multiplicand by way of annual interest. In ascertaining this,
regard should also be had to the fact that ultimately the capital
sum should also be consumed-up over the period for which the
FAO 184/1992

Page No.5 of 10

dependency is expected to last. Since the dependents can invest
their damages, the lump sum awarded in respect of future loss
must be discounted to reflect interest on invested funds, the
intention being that the dependents will each year draw interest
and some capital (the interest element decreasing and the capital
drawings increasing with the passage of years), so that they are
compensated each year for their annual loss, and the fund will be
exhausted at the age which the court assesses to be the correct
age, having regard to all contingencies.
19.

Thus, the compensation awarded by way of multiplier

method takes care of future prospects. I will demonstrate the
same in the present case. Taking monthly income of deceased as
Rs. 1,681/- and considering the extended family of the deceased,
I deduct 1/5th on account of personal expenses of the deceased,
loss of dependency is assessed as Rs.1,344/- per month. (More
than the sum treated as per the award). I increase the wages by
10% each year. I take interest on the capital @ 12% p.a. from
1987 to 1995 and @ 10% for the period 1995-2002 and thereafter
@ 8% p.a. for the period 2002-2012. Annual interest is shown in
column 4.

Annual loss of dependency in column 5 and

excess/shortfall of interest over annual dependency in column 6.

A perusal of the table shows that till the 15th year, there is

excess of interest over dependency.

The excess interest has

been capitalized for the next year. After 15 years, the capital is
eroded and stands completely eroded in the 25th year.
21.

According to Annexure-D filed by the appellants, the salary

of the deceased would have been Rs.2,293/- p.m. as on 31.12.90,
Rs.4,117/- p.m. as on 31.12.95, Rs. 8,940/- p.m. as on 31.12.00,
Rs. 10,235/- p.m.

as on 31.12.05 and Rs. 11,230/- p.m. as on

31.12.14 i.e. at the time of his retirement.
22.

As per appellants, loss of dependency at the end of 25 years

comes to Rs. 8,984/-. Whereas, loss of dependency assumed by
me as per the chart is Rs.13,184/- p.m. in the 25th year. The
table clearly shows that compensation awarded by way of
multiplier method has taken into account future prospects.

FAO 184/1992

Page No.8 of 10

23.

I also note that it has come in evidence that at the time of

his death, deceased was a work charge employee. Suresh Kumar,
PW-1 and S.N. Tripathi, PW-6 have deposed before the Tribunal
that the deceased was a work charge employee at the time of his
death. There is no evidence to show that in due course of time
deceased would have been confirmed.
24.

I find no merit in the contention of the learned counsel for

the appellants that the Tribunal had erred in ignoring the future
prospects. The table clearly shows that the compensation
awarded by the Tribunal for loss of dependency is just, fair and
reasonable.
25.

Lastly, counsel for the appellants submits that Tribunal erred

in awarding no compensation to the appellants towards nonpecuniary damages.
26.

I agree with the said submission made by the counsel for the

appellants.

Accordingly, I award conventional damages on

account of loss of consortium to the wife, father's love and
affection to the children at Rs.15,000/-.

Funeral expenses are

awarded in sum of Rs.2,000/-.
27.

Net effect is that the compensation stands enhanced by

Rs.17,000/-.

FAO 184/1992

Page No.9 of 10

28.

The appeal stands disposed of enhancing the compensation

by a sum of Rs.17,000/-.
29.

The enhanced compensation shall be paid to the appellants

together with interest @ 6% per annum from date of the claim
petition till date of realization.
30.

No costs.
