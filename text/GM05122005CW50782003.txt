By way of this writ petition the petitioner is impugning

an Award dated 9th April, 2000 whereby it was held by the
Industrial Tribunal that the respondent is entitled to be paid wages
in the pay scale of the X-Ray Technician in the proper pay scale.
An Award dated 9th April, 2000 passed by the Industrial Tribunal
in favour of the respondent/workman directing payment of the
same wages as are being paid to the other employees has been

assailed before this court by way of the present writ petition.
2.

There is no dispute so far as the material dates and

events are concerned. Admittedly the respondent was appointed
as an X-Ray Technician on 1st September, 1972 by the petitioner.
The admitted position is that the petitioner had sent a requisition
to the employment exchange for the recruitment of an X-Ray
Technician.

It had invited applications for the post of X-Ray

technicians in the Tibbia College Hospital.

Pursuant to such

invitations, various applications were received and after a
subsequent interview, the petitioner was offered the post of X-ray
technician in the Tibbia College Hospital.
3.

The respondent/workman fulfilled the petitioner's

requirement and consequently the workman was appointed in this
post.
The appointment letter issued to the petitioner read
thus:“

Tibbia College Act V 1952,

(Satya Prakash)
However

taking

Registrar(N.A.)”
advantage of the

fact

that

no

recruitment rules were in vogue, the respondent/workman was
paid salary in the scale which was paid to a LDC/Laboratory
Technician that is in the scale of Rs.150-300.
4.

There is no dispute that the petitioner has been

rendering satisfactory service as an X-Ray Technician ever since
the date of his appointment in 1972.
W.P.(C) 5078/2003

5.

Thereafter another resolution was passed and the

employment exchange was asked to effect recruitment for the post
of X-Ray Technician. It was during this process that as late as in
1993, one Sh. Dharamvir Sharma was appointed as an X-Ray
Technician. The said Sh. Sharma was given a salary in the scale of
Rs.1200-2040.
6.

So

as

the

pay

scales

admissible

to

the

respondent/workman is concerned, after his initial appointment
on 1st September, 1972 when he was paid in the pay scale of Rs.110180 which was revised on 1st January, 1973 to Rs.260-440 and
revised on 1st January, 1986 to Rs.950-1500.
7.

The petitioner states that a post of X-Ray Technician

was created in the grade of 1200-2040 on 22nd February, 1993 and
the following qualifications were prescribed for the same :“i)
Matriculation or Higher Secndary
or Senior Secondry (10+2) with Science.
ii)
Certificate in Radiography (2 year's
course) or diploma in Radiography (2 years)
or B.Sc.(2 years course.)”
8.

The petitioner contends that Sh. Daramvir Sharma who

had the requisite qualification of X-Ray Technician having a
radiographic diploma was appointed in this post in the grade of
Rs.1200-2040.
W.P.(C) 5078/2003

On this plea, it is contended that there is no
Page 4 of 12

comparison between the respondent and Sh. Daramvir Sharma.
9.

According

to

the

petitioner,

because

the

respondent/workman did not fulfill the eligibility criterion in
respect of the post of X-Ray Technician as per recruitment rules in
1993 which were given effect to subsequent to his appointment,
the respondent/workman was not entitled to the revision of the
pay scale in terms thereof. It is submitted that the respondent did
not have a certificate in Radiography or a diploma in radiographer
of two years duration and that he was also only a matriculate at the
time of his appointment.
10.

Aggrieved by the arbitrary action of the petitioner in

denying the wages to him at the rate being paid to the other person
performing identical duties, the respondent through the Hospital
Employees Union served upon it a demand notice dated 4th
November, 1995.

The dispute raised by the respondent was

referred by the appropriate government to the industrial
adjudicator for adjudication in the following terms :“Whether Sh. Daramvir Sharma is entitled
to pay scale of Rs.1200-2040 and if so what
direction are necessary in these directions ?”
11.

The petitioner contested the claim of the respondent

W.P.(C) 5078/2003

Page 5 of 12

workman in the same terms as has been noticed above. Sh. Ashok,
a junior accounts officer was examined as a witness on behalf of
the petitioner. This witness on behalf of the petitioner admitted
that the respondent was taken into service in the year 1972
through the Employment Exchange and that he fulfilled the
recruitment criterion as provided in the recruitment rules for the
said post. The witness also admitted that the respondent was
appointed as an X-Ray Technician on that date and he continues
to work on the said post even till date. In his deposition, the
witness on behalf of the petitioner, admitted that Sh. Daramvir
Sharma was much junior to the respondent, yet was given a higher
pay scale, emoluments and other benefits much higher than those
given to the respondent. It was unequivocally admitted by the
witness that the nature of work and duty hours of Sh. Daramvir
Sharma and the respondent/workman were identical.

Despite

these facts, the witness stated that the respondent was given salary
in the scale of theatre technician/LDC which carry the pay scale of
Rs.150-300 which was revised with effect from 1st January, 1992 to
Rs.350-400. The witness on behalf of the management admitted

served

by

the

According to this

witness, when the respondent/workman was taken into service in
1972, the recruitment rules of X-Ray Technician were not in
existence and came into existence only in 1984. He admitted that
there was no complaint about the work and conduct of the
respondent as an X-Ray Technician.
12.

In these circumstances, the learned Industrial Tribunal

passed an Award dated 9th April, 2002 holding that the
respondent/workman was entitled to the pay scale of X-Ray
technician which was revised from 330-560 with effect from 1st
January, 1986 to Rs.1200-2040 and all consequential benefits.
The reference was answered in the affirmative and the petitioner
was directed to pay the workman in the proper pay scale of
Rs.330-560 with effect from 1st January, 1973 and also give the
benefit of the revision with effect from 1st January, 1986 to
Rs.1200-2040 with all consequential benefits, monetary or nonmonetary. The Tribunal directed the petitioner to pay arrears of
the difference of wages by the date when the award became
enforcible. This award was published by the competent authority
on 9th October, 2002 and became enforcible with effect from 6th
November, 2002.
13.

It appears that the respondent/workman had served a

W.P.(C) 5078/2003

Page 7 of 12

demand notice dated 8th June, 2002 for implementation of the
impugned award and also filed an application under Section 33 (C)
(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 claiming difference of
salary for the relevant period. In these proceedings, on 9th April,
2003, the workman has recovered an amount of Rs.69,160/- for
the period of 1st October, 1988 to 30th June, 2003.
14.

The workman has explained that this writ petition was

filed and an order of stay was passed on 13th August, 2003 but the
workman was not aware of this order of stay and as the same was
not communicated either to the Recovery Officer or to him and in
these circumstances, the recovery was effected on 14th October,
2003. It has further been submitted that being law abiding, the
respondent/workman has expressed his willingness to comply
with all directions as may be passed by this court with regard to
the amount which was recovered in the aforestated proceedings.
15.

In view of the aforenoticed facts, there can be no manner

of doubt that the respondent/workman was appointed as an X-Ray
Technician and that he fulfilled the requirements of the petitioner.
He was appointed through a regular recruitment process through
the employment exchange and therefore there can be no denial to
the legality and validity of his appointment. The nature of duties
W.P.(C) 5078/2003

Page 8 of 12

performed by the respondent/workman is admitted by the
petitioner. There is an unequivocal statement on behalf of the
petitioner by its witness to the effect that the duties which are
being performed by the workman are identical to those which are
being performed by the X-Ray Technician who was appointed in
1994 or more than 22 years after the respondent's appointment.
The service of the respondent/workman has been proved to be
satisfactory and it is also clearly established beyond any doubt that
the respondent/workman is effectively performing the same duties
even on date.
16.

In these circumstances the plea of the petitioner that the

workman deserves to be paid less than what was admissible to an
X-Ray Technician on the specious ground that he does not fulfil
the eligibility requirement which came into vogue more than 12
years after the respondent's appointment is devoid of any legal
force.
17.

The present case is not a case where the court was being

required to consider a plea of regularisation or initial induction or
appointment into service. This court is also not examining any
issue relating to promotion. The respondent/workman had set up
a simple claim of entitlement to the same wages as were
W.P.(C) 5078/2003

Page 9 of 12

admissible to the other X-Ray Technician appointed subsequently
to him and who was performing the same duties and functions as
the respondent.
18.

The principles laid down by the Apex Court in AIR 1990

SC 371 entitled DCMDC vs Bhagwati Prasad apply on all fours in
favour of the respondent/workman. In this case it was held that
lack of a prescribed qualification would not come in the way of
entitlement to equal pay for equal work as the practical experience
obtained by the workman would lead him to effectively
discharging duties and responsibilities attached to the said post.
The observations of the Apex Court in this behalf read thus :“The main controversy centres round the
question whether some petitioners are
possessed of the requisite qualifications to
hold the posts so as to entitle them to be
confirmed in the respective posts held by
them. The indisputable facts are that the
petitioners were appointed between the
period 1983 and 1986 ever since, they have
been working and have gained sufficient
experience in the actual discharge of duties
attached to the posts held by them.
Practical experience would always aid the
person to effectively discharge the duties
and is a sure guide to assess the suitability.
The
initial
minimum
educational
qualification prescribed for the different
posts is undoubtedly a factor to be reckoned
with, but it is so at the time of the initial
entry into the service.
Once the
W.P.(C) 5078/2003

Page 10 of 12

19.

appointments were made as daily rated
workers and they were allowed to work for a
considerable length of time, it would be
hard and harsh to deny them the
confirmation in the respective posts on the
ground that they lack the prescribed
educational qualifications. In our view,
three years' experience, ignoring artificial
break in service for short period/periods
created by the respondent, in the
circumstances, would be sufficient for
conformation.”
The Award dated 9th April, 2000 cannot be assailed on

any legally tenable grounds. The findings of fact are based on the
admissions by the witness of petitioner.
For all the foregoing reasons, I find no merit in the writ
petition which is hereby dismissed with costs of Rs.10,000/- Out
of this amount a sum of Rs.5,000/- shall be paid to the respondent
within a period of four weeks. The balance amount shall be paid
within the same period in equal portions to the Delhi High Court
Legal Services Authority and the Delhi High Court Bar Association
Library Fund within the same period.
Intimation of these directions shall be given by the
Registry to the Delhi High Court Legal Services Authority and the
Delhi High Court Bar Association.
