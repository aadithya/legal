record.

3.

This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner

who submits that he is scheduled caste and landless
person who was allotted a piece of land in Khasra
No.996 (admeasuring 4 bighas 16 biswas) under the
revenue estate of village Dindarpur, Delhi by the
Pradhan Shri Tarif Singh after passing of resolution in
accordance with Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954 and
the rules framed thereunder.
4.

It has been submitted that such allotment was

made for upliftment of the landless and poor sections
of the society in accordance with the 20 Point
Programme of the then Prime Minister. In support of
this plea, reliance is placed on LR Form No.37 dated
11th March, 1974 and a copy of the certificate of
allotment issued in favour of the petitioner.

The

petitioner claims to be in cultivatory possession of the
property since then.
5.

Aggrieved by an order of ejectment passed

against him, the petitioner had made an application

WP(C) No.7161/2007

Page No.2

under paragraph 14 of Appendix

VI of Delhi Land

Reforms Act, 1954 for setting aside the ex parte order
dated 20th July, 2001 and 9th November, 2001. The
petitioner confirms that his revision against the orders
orders passed is still pending before the Financial
Commissioner.
6.

The petitioner points out that in the meantime,

the amendment which had been issued to the Rule 63
of the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1989 had been
assailed in a civil writ petition before this court
wherein the amendment was quashed.

The orders

passed by the Single Judge of this court were
sustained by the Division Bench and a special leave
petition of the Government against the same was
dismissed as back as on 5th May, 2000.
7.
plea

This writ petition has been necessitated on the
that

despite this

factual

position

and the

petitioner being in actual physical possession of the
land in question, the respondent is not recording the

WP(C) No.7161/2007

Page No.3

correct entries in the Khasra Girdawari with regard to
the existing facts despite repeated representations of
the petitioner. It is however on record that so far as
Khasra Girdawari for the year 2005 is concerned, the
occupation of the petitioner has been recorded in form
P-5 to be filled for kharif 2005 thereby the petitioner is
recorded as an unauthorised occupant of the subject
land.
The petitioner, therefore, prays that direction be
issued to the respondent to record the possession of
the petitioner in the revenue records in respect of the
land in question.
8.
that

There can possibly be no dispute to the effect
respondents

are

bound

to

discharge

their

functions and perform statutory duties in accordance
with law.

Law permits the respondents to make

appropriate records of the entries based on the factual
situation including noticing unauthorised occupation.
9.

Accordingly, this writ petition is disposed of with

WP(C) No.7161/2007

Page No.4

the direction to the respondent to consider the
representation of the petitioner, based on the correct
factual position and after consideration of the relevant
records, make necessary entries in the revenue record
in accordance with law.
This writ petition is disposed of in the above
terms.
