profit declared by the Assessee in the real estate
business

for

agreement

signed

by

him

at

London

on

26th

September, 1995 for extinguishing his rights in the
property – 13, Golf Links, New Delhi.
3.

The sequence of events which are relevant for

appreciating the facts of the present case have been
mentioned in the assessment order as follows:“The property under reference located
at 13-Golf Links, New Delhi measuring
171 sq.yds was originally obtained by
Dr.BC Guha since deceased vide deed
of Perpetual lease dated 8.8.1995 from
the President of India acting through
the Land Development Office of the
Govt. of India, thereafter a double
storied structure was built upon this
land after getting sanction from the
Municipal authorities.
The said Dr.BC Guha transferred
his rights in the said property in favour
[ITA No.391/2007]

Page 3 of 16

of his wife Smt.Leela Guha, son Dr.PK
Guha and daughter Smt.Santona Guha
by way of gift deed dated 26.1.1958.
The shares of Smt.Leela
and
Smt.Santona Guha were subsequently
inherited by Smt.Ina Guha and Shri JK
Guha on 8.2.1984 and 8.1.69 on the
death of these two parties as per their
separately executed wills, thus Dr.PK
Guha, Smt. Ina Guha and Shri JK Guha
became 1/3rd owner of the undivided
share in the property.
The third party Shri JK Guha filed a
suit entitled JK Guha Vs. PK Guha and
others in the High Court of Delhi vide
Civil Suit No.3104 of 1989 for partition
claiming
separation
of
his
1/3rd
undivided share in the said property.
Subsequently the claim was amended to
½ share instead of 1/3rd Share.
During the pendency of these
proceedings the assessee Shri JK
Kashyap, moved an application under
order 1 Rule 10 CPC seeking to be
made party to the proceedings on the
averments that Shri JK Guha had
entered into an agreement with him to
sell his 1/3rd share in the said property,
the assessee also filed a suit for specific
performance against Shri JK Guha
being Civil Suit No.2312 of 1990,
[ITA No.391/2007]

Page 4 of 16

entitled JK Jashyap Vs. JK Guha and
others in the High Court of Delhi
claiming that Shri JK Guha had agreed
to sell and transfer his share to the
assessee
for
a
consideration
of
Rs.25,00,000/- out of which an amount
of Rs.3.7 lakhs had been already paid as
part payment.
However, this claim of the assessee
was denied by Shri JK Guha and
subsequently he entered into an
agreement with one Shri Singh
Chauhan S/o Shri Shanker Singh
Chauhan to sell his rights in the said
property for a sum of Rs.One Crore.
Shri Ram Singh Chauhan made some
advances and payments and obtained
some documents including General
Power of Attorney, will and affidavit by
virtue of which Shri JK Guha created
rights and interest in the property in
favour of Shri Ram Singh Chauhan.
During the pendency of these
proceedings, the assessee along with
one Mr.Parveen Nayyar entered into an
agreement on 9.11.1993 to purchase
the undivided 2/3rd share of Dr.PK Guha
& his wife Mrs.Ina Guha for a total sale
consideration of Rs.2 crores and an
amount of Rs.20 lakhs was paid as
earnest money. Necessary permission
from the Appropriate Authority in form
[ITA No.391/2007]

Page 5 of 16

37-I was duly obtained for purchase the
said 2/3rd share for Rs.2 crores.
Thus it became evident that the
three co-owners Dr.PK Guha, Smt.Ina
Guha
and
Shri
JK
Guha
had
subsequently
created
rights
and
interest in the property in favour of the
assessee Shri JK Kashyap and Shri
Praveen Nayyar and Shri Ram Singh
Chauhan.
The above six parties
mutually agreed that in view of the
litigation, engagement claims and
counter claims between themselves it
was not possible to give effect to their
said agreement executed previously and
therefore, subsequently on 26.9.95 an
agreement
as mentioned earlier,
between the following parties was
signed (1) the vendors, Dr.PK Guha, Ina
Guha & JK Guha and (ii) the assignors
Shri JK Kashyap, Sh.Praveen Nauuar
and Sh.Ram Singh Chauhan and (iii) the
vendee FMI Investment Pvt.Ltd. It was
signed in London, U.K. wherein the
vendee M/s FMI Investment Pvt.Ltd,
was to purchase the property at 13-Golf
Links, New Delhi.
As per this agreement it was
mutually decided that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
parties (vendors) shall sell their
ownership and priprietory rights in the
property and the 4th, 5th & 6th parties
[ITA No.391/2007]

Page 6 of 16

(assignors)
shall
assign
all
and
whatever rights they claim.
All the
previous
agreements
claims
and
counter claims in respect of the said
property were to come to an end and
resolved.
In consideration of this offer,
representations & assurances, the 7th
party (vendee) was to pay a sum of Rs.
10 crores, which was to be divided
between 1st to 6th parties. Out of this
amount, Rs.9 crores 45 lacs, was to be
paid as part payment, on application for
compromise/withdrawal being moved in
the High Court and orders being passed
thereon and all other necessary
documents being executed. Out of this
amount, the assessee, Shri J.K.Kashyap,
was to receive a sum of Rs.2.24 crores.
The Balance Rs.55 lakhs, which
inlcuded the assessee's share of Rs.10
lacs, was to be paid on execution of the
sale deed before the Sub-Registrar,
New Delhi.
As per this agreement, the assessee
received banker's cheque dated 22.9.95
for Rs.2.24 crores drawn on Banque
Nationale de-Paris, and then he
withdrew the suit filed before the High
Court (vide order No.IA 9384/94 in S
2312/90) on 28.9.95. Moreover, as per
the said agreement, a Power of
Attorney, was issued by the assessee in
the name of Mr.Rakesh Kumar Jain,
[ITA No.391/2007]

was
nominated
as
the
trustee/caretaker of the property on
behalf of the vendors.”
4.

The

Assessing

Officer

after

examining

the

provisions of the agreement dated 26th September,
1995 concluded that it is immaterial - whether the
agreement has been completed or not; whether the
vendee has taken the possession of the property or not.
According to the Assessing Officer what is relevant in
the case of the Assessee is that he has relinquished his
rights in the said property for a consideration and this
transfer has taken place as per Section 2(47) of the Act
and thus he is liable to capital gain tax under Section
45 of the Act.
5.

The order of Assessing Officer was challenged by

the Assessee before CIT(A).
6.

CIT(A) in his order held that since the possession

of the property has not been given to the buyer and the

[ITA No.391/2007]

Page 8 of 16

transfer has not taken place as such the transactions
are not complete, so there cannot be any liability to
charge of capital gains, either short term or long term.
Therefore, the addition made by the Assessing Officer
was deleted by CIT(A).
7.

Aggrieved with the order of CIT(A), Revenue filed

an appeal before the Tribunal and the Tribunal vide
impugned order, set aside the order passed by CIT(A)
and allowed the appeal filed by Revenue.
8.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

Assessee that under Section 2(47) of the Act, a person
cannot be held liable to pay capital gains tax for a
payment

received

in

the

context

of

property

transactions, without a finding as to what is the precise
right in the property of the Assessee that has been
extinguished and which extinguishment is sought to be
made the basis of fastening the capital gains tax

[ITA No.391/2007]

Page 9 of 16

liability on the Assessee, since the transfer of the
property has not yet taken place.

Further, the

Assessee is not the owner of the property and he is
only a confirming party to the sale if at all the sale
finally takes place between the vendor and the vendee.
The property is still in dispute and the amount received
by the Assessee for relinquishing his interest in
property was only an advance and if ultimately the
agreement dated 26th June, 1995 was not implemented,
the Assessee was required to refund the whole amount.
9.

According to Section 45(1) of the Act, any profits

or gains arising from the transfer of capital asset
effected in the previous year are to be chargeable to
income tax under the head “capital gains” and shall be
deemed to be the income of the previous year in which
the transfer took place.

[ITA No.391/2007]

Page 10 of 16

10. The term “capital asset” has been defined in
Section 2(14) of the Act, so as to mean property of any
kind held by an Assessee, whether or not connected
with his business or profession.

It excludes certain

properties such as stock-in-trade, personal effects,
agricultural land etc.
11. Section 2(47) of the Act gives an inclusive
definition of transfer in relation to capital asset and
extinguishment of any right in the capital asset is also
considered to be a transfer for the purpose of the Act.
12. The combined reading of the above provisions of
law makes it clear that transfer of capital asset is not
confined to the transfer of immovable property only
but its scope is much wider for the purpose of the Act.
Section 45(1) of the Act would apply even if the
consideration is received from a party other than the
one in whose favour the transfer is effected.

[ITA No.391/2007]

Page 11 of 16

13. The word transfer under Section 2(47) has a very
wide meaning and its meaning cannot be narrowed
down by referring to the provisions of other statues.
14. In the present case, the Assessee in the year 1990
paid a sum of Rs.3.7 lacs as part payment to
Sh.J.K.Guha out of total consideration of Rs. 25 lacs for
acquiring 1/3rd share in the property. In the year 1993
further payments were made for purchase of undivided
interest of other owners of the property. However, due
to litigation, the sale could not be materialised and
subsequently on 26th September, 1995 an agreement
was entered with new vendee namely M/s FMI
Investment Pvt. Ltd.

Since the property had not yet

been transferred in the name of the Assessee, so the
Assessee became a party to this agreement as a
confirming party having acquired interest in the
property by virtue of earlier agreement.

[ITA No.391/2007]

Even if the

Page 12 of 16

Assessee has not become the owner of the property
due to litigation, the fact remains that he received
consideration for acquiring interest in the property and
that interest was ultimately relinquished by him in
favour of new vender by virtue of an agreement dated
16th September, 1995 and the consideration received
by him for relinquishing his right in the property, thus,
attracts the provisions of Section 45(1) of the Act,
making him liable to capital gains tax.
15. In this respect, it would be relevant to quote the
averments made by the Assessee in a civil suit filed by
him in this very Court against Mr.J.K.Guha and others
where the Assessee has stated in the petition that “the
plaintiff has a vital interest in the said property being
the purchaser under agreement to sell of 1/3rd in the
suit premises which was agreed to be partitioned and
thereafter to be sold to the plaintiff.”

[ITA No.391/2007]

Page 13 of 16

16. Moreover in the agreement to sell dated 26th
September, 1995 in which the Assessee is the fourth
party and he along with Fifth party, has entered into
an agreement to purchase the undivided 2/3rd rights
and undivided shares of first and second parties for a
total consideration of Rs. 2 crore.
17. The Assessee has also placed on record copy of
his statement recorded in suit No.2312/90 filed in this
Court, which reads as under:“ Statement of Mr.J.K.Kashyap, Plaintiff on
S.A. and of counsel for the parties:
The parties have arrived at a settlement an
agreement of sale has been entered into
M/s FMI Investment Pvt. Ltd. Has today
handed over a Bankers cheque No.217252
dated 22nd September, 1995 for a sum of
Rupees Two Crores twenty four lakhs to the
plaintiff Mr.J.K.Kashyap drawn on 'Banque
Nationale Paris'. All the original documents
relating to the suit property and in
possession of the plaintiff have been
handed over to the intending purchaser.
The plaintiff has no other document left
with him. The claim of the plaintiff stands
[ITA No.391/2007]

Page 14 of 16

satisfied.
The suit be dismissed as
withdrawn leaving the parties to bear their
own costs.”
18. So, it is clear from the record that by way of first
agreement which was entered in the year 1990, the
Assessee had acquired right in the property and this
right he has relinquished in favour of new vendor in
1995. Thus, we are of the considered opinion that the
Assessee is liable to long term capital gain and not to
short term capital gain.
19. Under the circumstances, we do not find any
infirmity in the impugned order passed by the Tribunal
and since it is a finding of fact given by the Tribunal
that the Assessee acquired right in the property at the
time of execution of first agreement in the year 1990
and had relinquished his rights in favour of new vender
in 1995, no substantial question of law arises for our
consideration.

[ITA No.391/2007]

20. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
