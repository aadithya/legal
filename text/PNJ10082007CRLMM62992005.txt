PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

At the outset I may note that learned counsel for the

petitioners has drawn out the memorandum of parties in a most
unsatisfactory manner.

The memo of parties states that 6

petitioners have joined in a common action to challenge the
summoning order dated 18.5.2002. But, in the preamble to the
petition and the prayer made it is stated that only petitioners
No.1, 4 and 5 are approaching the Court praying that the

Crl.M.C. No.6299-304/2005

Pg.No.1 of 8

summoning order be quashed vis-a-vis said petitioners.
2.

Learned counsel for the petitioners who is a senior

member of the Bar is expected to be more vigilant while
drafting petitions.
3.

Respondent filed a complaint under Section 138

read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881
impleading 6 respondents as accused.

The same are as

under:“1.
2.

Shri A.Niaz Ahmed.

3.

Shri T.Abdul Jabbar.

4.

Shri T.Azeezur Rehman.

5.

Shri T.Habeebur Rehman.

6.

4.

M/s.T.Azeezur Rehman & Co., 12, Karpura
Mudoli Street, Periamet, Madrass.

Shri A. Faiyaz Ahmed.

All residents of 12, Karpura Mudoli Street, Periament,
Madrass.”
Necessary averment against the accused persons

made in the complainant are that accused No.1 is a partnership
firm and accused No.2 to 6 are its partners. That accused No.2,
as partner of accused No.1 issued a cheque in sum of Rs.5 lacs
from an account maintained by the branch of accused No.1
called Nadira Leather Co., Madras. It was stated that accused

Crl.M.C. No.6299-304/2005

Pg.No.2 of 8

No.1 owed Rs.90 lacs to the complainant and Rs.5 lacs was
paid to liquidate part liability.
5.

Alleging that the cheque was dishonoured and

notice of dishonour was served upon the accused, prayer made
was to take action against the accused persons as per law.
6.

Learned Metropolitan Magistrate took cognizance of

the complaint and issued summons for appearance of the
accused persons.
7.

A two fold submission was urged by learned for

petitioners No.1, 4 and 5 at the hearing held on 6.8.2007.
8.

It was firstly urged that the cheque in question

which formed the foundation of the complaint as per the
complaint was issued by accused No.2 and was admittedly
drawn from an account in the name of Nadira Leather Co.
Madras.

Thus, it was urged that neither petitioner No.1 nor

petitioner No.4 nor petitioner No.5 could be made liable on
account of the said cheque not being cleared for payment by
the banker on whom the cheque was drawn as they had no
concern with the cheque.
9.

The second contention urged was that there are no

averments in the complaint that petitioners No.4 and 5 were
the persons in-charge and responsible for the conduct of the
Crl.M.C. No.6299-304/2005

Pg.No.3 of 8

business of respondent No.1. Thus, qua said petitioners, it was
urged that the summoning order requires to be quashed.
10.

The first submission made by learned counsel for

petitioners No.1, 4 and 5 appears to be very attractive at the
first blush. But, a little probe reveals that learned counsel for
said petitioners is attempting to raise a castle of sand without
any foundation.
11.

Pertaining to the cheque in question, in para 4 of the

complaint it has been specifically pleaded that accused No.2
signed the cheque on an account maintained with Allahabad
Bank by the branch of accused No.1 at Madras carrying on
business in the name Nadira Leather Co.
12.

There is no prohibition in law for a partnership firm

to carry on business under any name and style. The fact that
normally a partnership firm carries on business under its own
name and style does not mean that a partnership firm cannot
adopt any other trade name or trading style.
13.

Indeed, in the instant case the 5 partners of accused

No.1 after drawing up an agreement to carry on business as
partners with effect from 1.11.1975 appended a codicil to the
partnership deed recording as under:“The Partners of the firm have started a Branch
Crl.M.C. No.6299-304/2005

Pg.No.4 of 8

in 59, Perianna Maistry Street, Madras-3 in the
name of Nadira Leather Co. and a Tannery in
Thuthipet from April 1976 and the profit and
loss of these belong to this firm T.Azeezur
Rehman & Co.

14.

This is to be treated as part and parcel of
partnership deed dated 13.11.75.”
Thus, it is an obvious case where accused No.1 was

carrying on business at Madras under the trading name and
style Nadira Leather Co.

An account was maintained by

accused No.1 in said trade name with Allahabad Bank, from
which account the cheque in question was issued.
15.

Thus, no case is made out for interference vis-a-vis

petitioner No.1.
16.

Aforesaid

reasoning

takes

care

of

the

first

submission made by learned counsel for petitioners No.1, 4 and
5.
17.

To appreciate the second contention urged by

learned counsel for petitioners, Section 141 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act needs to be looked into. Relevant part thereof
reads as under:“(1) If the person committing an offence under
Section 138 is a company, every person who, at
the time the offence was committed, was in
charge of, and was responsible to the company
for the conduct of the business of the company,
as well as the company, shall be deemed to be
guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be
Crl.M.C. No.6299-304/2005

Pg.No.5 of 8

proceeded against and punished accordingly.

18.

(a) “company” means any body corporate and
includes a firm or other association of
individuals.”
Pertaining to the liability of the partners of a

partnership firm, in para 6 of the report published as Monaben
Ketanbhai Shah & Anr. vs. State of Gujarat & Ors. AIR 2004 SC
4274, Supreme Court has opined as under:-

19.

“Section 141 does not make all partners liable for
the offence.
The criminal liability has been
fastened on those who, at the time of the
commission of the offence, was in-charge of and
was responsible to the firm for the conduct of the
business of the firm. These may be sleeping
partners who are not required to take any part in
the business of the firm; they may be ladies and
others who may not know anything about the
business of the firm. The primary responsibility is
on the complainant to make necessary averments
in the complaint so as to make the accused
vicariously liable.
For fastening the criminal
liability, there is no presumption that every
partner knows about the transaction.
The
obligation of the appellants to prove that at the
time the offence was committed they were not incharge of and were not responsible to the firm for
the conduct of the business of the firm, would
arise only when first the complainant makes
necessary averments in the complaint and
establishes that fact.”
Though, the complaint is silent vis-a-vis the

authority of the partners of accused No.1, the partnership
deed, vide clause 7 and 10 records as under:-

Crl.M.C. No.6299-304/2005

Pg.No.6 of 8

“(vii) The bank account of the firm shall be
operated by either of the first, second and third
partners.

20.

(x) The partners shall attend to the business of
the firm diligently. The first, second and third
partners are authorized to negotiate for loan or
overdraft facilities with or without security for the
purpose of the firm and by offering security if
necessary any or all the firm's properties. The
fourth and fifth partners have no borrowing power
in the name of the partnership.”
Co-relating the five partners of accused No.1 vis-a-

vis their identity as accused in the complaint the position would
be as under:(i) T.Abdul Jabbar

...

First partner:Accused No.3.

(ii) T.Azeezur Rehman
No.4.

...

Second

(iii) A. Niyaz Ahmed

....

Third partner : Accused No.2.

(iv) T.Habeebur Rehman

....

Fourth partner : Accused No.5.

partner

:

Accused

(v) A.Faiyaz Ahmed
.... Fifth partner : Accused No.6.
21.
As noted above, vis-a-vis the partners the instant
petition was filed only for the benefit of accused Nos.4 and 5
viz. the second partner T.Azeezur Rehman and the fourth
partner T.Habeebur Rehman.
22.

Vis-a-vis the fourth partner it is apparent that even

under the partnership deed he had no borrowing powers to
bind the partnership firm and in relation to the loans, overdraft
facilities or securities to be offered by the firm had no authority
Crl.M.C. No.6299-304/2005

Pg.No.7 of 8

to act on behalf of the firm.
23.

Qua the second partner it is apparent that he was

not only authorized to incur financial liability on behalf of the
firm but was also authorized to issue securities on behalf of the
firm.
24.

Indeed, the cheque in question has been signed by

the second partner.

The petition is accordingly liable to

succeed only qua petitioner No.5 impleaded as accused No.5.
25.

Petition stands disposed of quashing the summoning

order but only in relation to petitioner No.5 arrayed as accused
No.5 in the complaint.
26.

The

petition

is

dismissed

vis-a-vis

the

other

petitioners.
