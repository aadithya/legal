V.B. GUPTA, J.
Revenue is aggrieved by the order dated 25th

ITA No. 876/2005

Page 1 of 6

was dismissed for the Assessment year 1999-2000.
2.

The facts giving rise to present appeal are that M/s

Regency Express Private Limited (hearinafter referred to as
Assessee) had filed its return on 1st December, 1999
declaring a loss of Rs.1785/- for the Assessment Year 19992000.
3.

The Assessing Officer issued notice under Section

143(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short 'the Act') to
the Assessee on 29th December, 2000 and the said notice
was sent at the address given by the Assessee in its return.
The said notice was duly served on the Assessee which was
received by one “Gunanand” and according to this notice,
the date of hearing was 11th January, 2001.
4.

In pursuance to the aforesaid notice, Assessee's

representative Shri Harish Bansal, Chartered Accountant
attended the hearing on 11th January, 2001 and was asked
to furnish the various information.
5.

Next, the hearing for assessment was taken up on 7th

February, 2001 and on that day one Shri Mohammad Aslam,
Assistant

with

M/s

S. Prasad

and

Co.,

Chartered

Accountant appeared and filed letter dated 7th February,
ITA No. 876/2005

Page 2 of 6

2001 seeking adjournment and accordingly the matter was
adjourned.

Thereafter,

in

the

presence

of

Assessee/

representative, assessment order dated 27th March, 2002
was passed under Section 143(3) of the Act.
6.

Assessee being dissatisfied with the order of the

Assessing Officer, filed an appeal before the Commissioner
of Income Tax (Appeal) and for the first time raised
objections stating that no notice was served upon him within
the period of 12 months from the end of the month in which
the return of Income Tax was filed; that the notice has not
been served either on the Assessee, directors or any of its
authorized agents.
7.

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeal) accepted the

contentions of the Assessee and held that the notice has
neither been served within time nor on duly authorised
person.
8.

Revenue being dissatisfied with the order of the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeal), filed an appeal
before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the Tribunal
dismissed the appeal of the Revenue and canceled the
impugned assessment.
ITA No. 876/2005

9.

On these facts, we framed the following substantial

question of law for consideration:

10.

“Whether service of notice U/s 143 (2) to
employee of the Assessee within limitation is
valid service specially when Assessee raises no
objection before Assessment Officer and
participates in the proceedings?”
It has been contended by learned counsel for the

Revenue that notice in question was issued on 29th
December, 2000 that is within one year from the end of the
month of filing of return on 1st December, 1999 and was
within limitation and the same was served on the Assessee
on 29th December, 2000 and was duly accepted by one of
the employees of the Assessee. The representative of the
Assessee attended the hearing on 11th January, 2001 and
even filed his authority letter and thereafter on subsequent
hearing also representative of the Assessee was present and
no such objection was raised.
11.

On the other hand, it has been contended by learned

counsel for the Assessee that no notice as required under
the law has been served upon the Assessee or any of its
authorised agents.
12.

As per Annexure-I, which is copy of notice under

ITA No. 876/2005

Page 4 of 6

Section 143(2) of the Act, it has been received by one
“Gunanand” on 29th December, 2000. It has nowhere been
pleaded on behalf of the Assessee either before Assessing
Officer, Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeal) or the
Tribunal, that Gunanand is not their employee or he is a
fictitious person.
13.

Even assuming for arguments sake that no notice

under Section 143(2) of the Act has been received on behalf
of the Assessee on 29th December, 2000, then there was no
occasion for Assessee or his representative to appear before
the Assessing Officer on 11th January, 2001.
14.

The fact that on 11th January, 2001 Mr Harish Bansal,

Chartered Accountant appeared before the Assessing Officer
and filed his Power of Attorney and was asked to file
details/information and thereafter on 7th February, 2001,
one Shri Mohammad Aslam, Assistant alongwith M/s. S.
Prasad and Co., Chartered Accountant appeared before the
Assessing Officer and filed a letter seeking adjournment,
goes on to show that notice under Section 143(2) of the Act
has been duly served on the Assessee through his
representative on 29th December, 2000 and that is why the
ITA No. 876/2005

Page 5 of 6

representatives of the Assessee have been appearing before
the Assessing Officer in pursuance of the notice.
15.

Accordingly, we hold that the Income Tax Appellate

Tribunal erred in observing that the notice under Section
143(2) of the Act has not been served upon the Assessee
and the assessment stands vitiated.
16.

The substantial question of law is answered in the

affirmative, in favour of the Revenue and against the
Assessee.
17.

Present appeal filed by Revenue is accordingly

allowed and order passed by the Commissioner of Income
Tax (Appeal) canceling the impugned assessment is set
aside and the matter is remanded back to the Commissioner
of Income Tax (Appeal) to consider the matter afresh in
accordance with the law.
