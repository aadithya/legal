S.N.AGGARWAL, J (ORAL)

This order shall dispose of the objections filed against the
arbitral award dated 31.03.2006 awarding an amount of
Rs.21,05,866/- in favour of the contractor. The arbitral award
directs the respondent/MCD to pay the award amount within 30

days from the date of the award failing which to pay 12%
interest on the award amount from the date of award till
payment.

The contractor being the petitioner herein does not

dispute that he has already received the entire award amount
in terms of the arbitral award dated 31.03.2006. His grievance
against the award is on account of non-awarding of pendente
lite interest by the learned Arbitrator.
3

Mr. Rastogi, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of

the contractor/petitioner has contended that the amount
awarded by the learned Arbitrator is based upon the admission
of liability by the respondent/MCD made in the office notings of
12.9.2003 for releasing the amount of Rs.21,05,866/- on
account of difference in the price of wheat for the period from
21.7.2000 to 29.11.2000.
4

Mr. Singh, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

MCD has not disputed that the amount awarded by the learned
Arbitrator is based upon the admission of the respondent
contained in the office noting at page 49 of the paper book.
OMP No. 295/2006

Page Number 2 of 6

The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has contended
that the learned Arbitrator has legally misconducted himself in
not awarding the pendente lite interest on the amount
admittedly withheld by the MCD. He has submitted that to that
extent there is an error apparent on the face of the

record.

Reliance has been placed by him on a Division Bench judgment
of this Court Tata Motors Ltd. Vs. NDMC & Ors, 2006, RLR
105.

Further relying upon a judgment of the Bombay High

Court in Larsen and Toubro Ltd. Vs. Sunfield Resources
Pvt. Ltd., 2006 (4) R.A.J. 401 (Bom), Mr. Rastogi has
contended that this Court in exercise of its powers under
Section 34 of the Arbitration Act can interfere in the arbitral
award if it is shown that either there is an error apparent on the
face of the record or that the finding suffers from violation of
principles of natural justice. According to Mr. Rastogi, the award
under challenge suffers from an error apparent on the face of
the record because the learned Arbitrator has failed to dealt
with the claim of the petitioner/ contractor for award of
pendente lite interest on the claim amount.
5

Mr. Singh, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

OMP No. 295/2006

Page Number 3 of 6

MCD has strongly argued that in view of provisions contained in
Section 31 (7) (a) & (b) of the Arbitration Act, the matter
regarding award of pendente lite interest is purely in the
discretion of the learned Arbitrator and this Court in exercise of
its powers under Section 34 of the said Act cannot interfere in
the decision of the Arbitrator in such matter relating to grant of
pendente lite interest. He has supported his said contention
relying upon a Division Bench Judgment of Madras High Court
in

Sree

Kamatchi

Amman

Constructions

Vs.

the

Divisional Railway Manager/Works, Palghat Division,
2007 (4) Arb. Law Reporter 261 (Madras). The submission
of Mr. Singh is that since the learned Arbitrator has not
awarded the pendente lite interest, it should be presumed that
the

Arbitrator

has

refused

the

claim

of

the

petitioner/

contractor for pendente lite interest.
6

I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival

arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties. I
could not persuade myself to agree with the submissions made
by the learned counsel for the respondent. The arbitral award
in favour of the contractor is based upon the admission of the
OMP No. 295/2006

Page Number 4 of 6

respondent/MCD. The admission of liability to the tune of award
amount was made in the office noting dated 12.09.2003
produced

by

the

Department

itself

before

the

learned

Arbitrator. The Arbitration proceedings had commenced with
the appointment of the Arbitrator on 08.04.2005. The award
against which objections have been filed was published on
31.03.2006. Since the respondent/MCD has withheld the
admitted payment of the contractor till the payment was made
pursuant to the award dated 31.03.2006, the ends of justice
require that contractor should also get interest for the period
arbitration proceedings remained pending i.e. for the period
from 08.04.2005 to 31.03.2006. Since the learned Arbitrator
has not dealt with the question regarding grant of pendente lite
interest, there appears to be an error apparent on the face of
the record to this extent and therefore the said award is
modified holding the petitioner/contractor entitled to pendente
lite interest on the award amount @ 12% per annum. The
respondent/MCD is given 30 days time for making the said
payment of pendente lite interest to the contractor.

In view of the above, this objection petition stands
