PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Heard.

2.

The petitioner and the respondent are bound by a

matrimonial bond.

Unfortunately, the marriage has turned

sour. A petition for divorce is pending. Respondent filed an
application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act alleging
that she had no income and that the petitioner was gainfully
employed in automobile business being sole proprietor of a
workshop M/s.New Milap Auto Engineering Works. She alleged
that he was the only son of his parents. She stated that her

husband was having an income of Rs.50,000/- per month. She
claimed maintenance in sum of Rs.33,000/- per month.
3.

Petitioner refuted each and every assertion made by

the respondent.
parents.

He stated that he was disbanded by his

He stated that he was carrying on business as a

motor mechanic from a shop at Mangol Puri. He stated that he
was earning between Rs.75,000/- to Rs.80,000/- per annum.
He relied upon his income tax returns.
4.

In rejoinder the wife pointed out the social and

economic status of the two families when she got married. She
pointed out that her parents spent lavishly at the wedding and
even gave an Alto car to her husband. She pointed out that at
the time of marriage apart from usual gifts, furniture to fill a
drawing room, colour television, refrigerator, washing machine
and other electrical gadgets were gifted by her parents. From
the extent of dowry articles she wanted the Court to gather the
economic status of the parties.
5.

The wife succeeded.

6.

Disbelieving the income tax returns of the husband

and with reference to the dowry articles given at the time of
marriage learned Judge has opined that the petitioner should
give to the respondent a monthly maintenance of Rs.10,000/-.
7.

Learned

Matrimonial

Judge

has

noted

various
Page 2 of 5

decision wherein it has been noted that income tax returns are
not the true measure of the income of a spouse and that when
divorce claims are made by parties some conjectures and
guess-work is permitted when resorted to by the Court.
8.

I note that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its decision

reported as (1997) 7 SCC 7 Jasbir Kaur vs. D.J.Dehradun upheld
an order passed by a Court on guess-work.
9.

Suffice would it be to state that in matrimonial

disputes the income of every husband disappears even when in
employment.

It is noted that husband's resort to excessive

deductions from their salaries. All kinds of loans are taken and
monthly deductions are effected from their salaries.
10.

In my opinion, the socio-economic background of

the parties is a relevant consideration while determining the
income of a respective spouse.
11.

Maintaining a car would need at least Rs.5,000/- per

month on fuel, maintenance and insurance.

A person who

owns a refrigerator, a colour television, a washing machine,
mixer grinder and other electrical and electronic appliances
would obviously be using them.
12.

Detergents used in washing machines are 30 times

as expensive than ordinary washing soaps. Only a person with
means would use an expensive detergent in a washing

machine.
13.

At the time when he got married, obviously,

petitioner had a good income for the reason if he was earning a
meagre sum of Rs.6,000/- to Rs.7,000/- per month, the girl's
family would not have married their daughter to him.
14.

The family of the bride and the groom come from a

well-off strata of the society.
15.

The wife would be entitled to the same standard of

living to which she was used to when living with her husband.
She would be entitled to use the same kind of electrical and
electronic gadgets.

Why should she be denied the use of a

car?
16.

I accordingly hold that the learned Trial Judge was

justified in disbelieving the income tax returns produced by the
petitioner.

Learned Judge was justified in estimating the

income of the petitioner with reference to the socio-economic
background of the parties.
17.

I have made a brief reference to the dowry articles

given by the family of the bride at the time of the marriage.
The same shows that the petitioner was having a matching
social and economic status.
18.

I find no merits in the petition.

The same is

dismissed.
