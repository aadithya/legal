2.

“Recruitment
of
Trade
Test,
where
prescribed, has to be met before grant of
financial upgradation. Only a person, who is
fully
eligible
for
promotion
under
Recruitment Rules but fails to secure a
promotion within 12/24 years is eligible for
grant of financial upgradation under ACP. As
such, the proposal cannot be accepted.”
The Petitioners 2 to 7 were regularized

Mason/Khallasi/Wireman/Operator(E&M)/Beldar,

by

as
the

Respondent sometime between 1986-1993. The Petitioners claim
that they have completed more that 12 years of regular services
and consequently, under the Assured Career Promotion scheme
dated 9.8.1999, they became entitled to benefit of the said
scheme. Petitioner No.1 is a Trade Union registered under the
Trade Unions Act. Petitioner No.2, 4, 5 and 6 viz. Ram Sahay, Sher
Singh, Dviwedi A.K., and Joginder Singh, are stated to be regular
mason, wire man and Operators (E&M) i.e. Group `C' employees,
Petitioner Nos. 3 and 7, viz. Manvar Singh and Bulle Ram are
stated to be

regular Khallasi and Baildar, i.e. Group `D'

employees. The pay scale of Group `D' employees is Rs.25503200 while the pay scale of Group `C' is Rs.3550-4590. The
Petitioners claim that under the Assured Career Promotion
scheme they are entitled to first financial up gradation after 12
years of regular service in the pay scale of Rs.3050-4590 for
W.P. (C) No. 1227-33.06

Page No. 2 of 7

Group `D' employees and Rs.4000-6000 for Group C employees.
However, they complain that the Group `D' employees have been
placed in lower pay scale of Rs.2610-4000

and Group C

employees have been denied the benefit of the ACP Scheme
altogether.
3.

The Petitioner submits that for getting the benefit of

Assured Career Promotion scheme, under the said scheme, there
was no such requirement of clearing the trade test and the
respondents may hold a screening process only for considering
their cases for promotion to the next higher post in their channel
of promotion. They contend that by issuing clarifications the
Assured

Career

Promotion

scheme

could

not

have

been

supplemented but only supplanted. By issuing the impugned
classification, it is contended, the respondents have taken away
the benefit to which the petitioners were entitled. The Petitioner's
contend that the Assured Career Promotion scheme dated
9.8.1999 no where provides for any condition of passing the trade
test or securing a license etc . As best, the Respondents were
entitled to hold a DPC for screening the candidates to assess the
eligibility as provided for under the Assured Career Promotion
scheme like having qualification, if any, prescribed for the said
purpose, but the same does not include the requirement of
W.P. (C) No. 1227-33.06

Page No. 3 of 7

passing a trade test required or obtaining the requisite license.
4.

The Tribunal rejected the aforesaid submissions of the

Petitioners by examining paragraph 6 of the OM dated 9.8.1999
whereby the Assured Career Promotion scheme was formulated.
The Tribunal also relied upon a Full Bench judgment of the
Chandigarh Bench in O.A.-125/CH/2003 and O.A.-465/CH/2003.
The relevant extract from the aforesaid OM dated 9.8.1999 and
the Full Bench decision of the Chandigarh Bench of the Tribunal
as extracted by the Tribunal in its impugned order are reproduced
herein below:
“6. We have carefully considered the
submissions made by the learned counsel
for the applicants. Para 6 of Annexure I of
OM dated 9.8.1999 provides as follows:
“6. fulfillment of normal promotion
norms
(bench-mark,
departmental
examination, seniority-cum-fitness in
the case of Group 'D' employees, etc.)
for grant of financial upgradation,
performance of such duties as are
entrusted to the employees together
with retention of old designations,
financial upgradations as personal to
the incumbent for the stated purposes
and restriction of the ACP Scheme for
financial and certain other benefits
(House Building Advance, allotment of
Government
accommodation,
advances, etc.) only without conferring
any privileges related to higher status
(e.g. invitation to ceremonial functions,
deputation to higher posts, etc.) shall
be ensured for grant of benefits under
W.P. (C) No. 1227-33.06

the ACP Scheme”

(emphasis supplied)

7.
We also find that this issue has been
considered by the Full Bench at Chandigarh
in OA-125/CH/2003 and OA-465/CH/2003,
wherein the following question was referred
to the Full Bench:
“Whether a person, for getting
financial upgradation under the ACP
scheme dated 9.8.1999 to the next
higher grade/scale is required to be
possessed of educational qualifications
required for appointment/promotion to
the next higher post, carrying the
same scale which is to be given now
under the Scheme as a financial
upgradation.”
The Full Bench has decided
question in the following terms:

the

said

“Answer
A person for grant of financial
upgradation under the ACP scheme
dated 9.8.1999 to the next higher
grade/scale is required to possess the
educational qualifications required for
appointment/promotion to the next
higher post carrying the same scale.”
5.

The Tribunal also noted that the view of the Full Bench

of the Chandigarh Bench of the Tribunal was followed by the
Jabalpur Bench, Circuit sitting at Bilaspur in O.A. No. 23/2001,
113/2003 and 327/2002.
6.

The issue raised by the petitioners is no longer res

W.P. (C) No. 1227-33.06

Page No. 5 of 7

integra and is covered by a decision of this Court in Deepak
Kumar v. UOI & Ors, W.P(C) No.7322/2002 decided on
November 28, 2006 reported as 2007 (93) DRJ 328. the relevant
extract from the said decision reads as follows:“It may be noticed that para 5 of OM dated
9.8.1999 and para 6 of Annexure 1 of the said
OM are based on, rather are the manifestation
of the recommendation of the Fifth Central Pay
Commission itself. The Pay Commission while
recommending
the
ACP
Scheme
itself
suggested that moving to higher scale would be
subject to fulfilment of usual norms of
promotion and if this involves passing of a trade
or departmental test or acquisition of higher
qualifications, that pre-requisite would have to
be fulfilled before the benefit of ACP Scheme is
given.
Further, grant of automatic upgradation on
completion of 12/24 years of regular service
without meeting the usual norms is not the
purpose of the Scheme.
The ACP Scheme
envisages financial upgradation where there are
no promotional avenues. The intent is to avoid
stagnation
and
provide
a
chance
for
upgradation to those who are meritorious but
yet denied the same on account of nonavailability of promotional avenues.
The
rationale and intent appears not to grant an
automatic financial upgradation to all those who
complete 12/24 years of service, irrespective of
their performance. The inefficient and indolent
are not to be rewarded by automatic financial
upgradation. Services below the benchmark
and those above cannot be equated.
Accordingly, the provision for screening is
necessary and essential to serve the purpose of
the scheme. Normal promotional norms have to
be applied for grant of financial upgradation
under the ACP Scheme.”

7.

We also do not find any merit in the petitioner's

submission that the clarification in question supplants the ACP
Scheme. A perusal of the aforesaid judgment shows that the ACP
scheme itself postulated that for grant of the benefit of the said
scheme, the conditions for grant of promotions have to be met.
The upgradation granted to such of the Group`D' employees who
are otherwise ineligible for promotion, in the scale of Rs.26104000 cannot become a reason for them to claim the benefit of
the ACP Scheme. Consequently we see no merit in this petition
and dismiss the same. No costs.
