ANIL KUMAR, J. (Oral)

1.

The respondent in this application has claimed that the order

directing the Managing Director of the respondent corporation to
be present, be recalled and his personal appearance be dispensed
with. The application seeking exemption from personal appearance
of the Managing Director of the respondent is supported by an
affidavit of Shri K. Mukhopadhyaya, Chief General Manager,

OMP No. 437 of 2007

Northern Region. The ground which is taken in the application for
exemption is as under:
“8.
That the Managing Director of the respondent is
the executive head of the respondent corporation and
normally he is very busy from early morning till late in
the evening and he has to meet number of officers from
different offices situated all over India besides number
of outside visitors. It is stated a number of meetings
were already fixed for on December 20, 2007 and he
has to attend the same and it would be extremely
difficult for the Managing Director to be personally
present in the Court on December 20, 2007 and it is
therefore respectfully submitted that his personal
appearance be very kindly dispensed with.

2.

The presence of Managing Director was sought because by

letter dated 20th July, 2007 it was intimated to the petitioner that
the amount of Rs.30.60 lakhs will be refunded subject to petitioner
submitting Bank Guarantee valid for six months for the same
amount. This letter was sent almost after six months in reply to the
letter dated 8th December, 2006 by which the petitioner had
protested against levy of penalty of Rs.41,78,000/-. By this letter
dated 20th July, 2007 it was also communicated that the records of
the petitioner have been rechecked for the period 1.4.2005 to
15.04.2006 and the respondent has decided to levy another
amount of Rs.11,14,000/- as penalty. It was also intimated to the
petitioner that the penalties for the entire period will be rechecked.

3.

By letter dated 4th July, 2007 addressed to the Managing

Director of the respondent, the petitioner had contended

about

illegal deductions made from his bills and as his various letters
had not been replied by the officials of the respondent, therefore,
he has sought for appointment of an arbitrator. The relevant
allegations made in the said communication are as under:
“……. We had been working for you also as Road
Transport Operator (RTO) at DCT Okhla since
16.8.1999. The contract expired on 15.08.2003. The
same was extended for next four months upto
15.12.2003 as per contract clause no. 4.2 and again
extended for two years upto 15.12.2005 as per
contract clause no. 4.1 and after that we were asked to
continue till finalization of next contract, in viewing
our long time relationship the work was continued till
20.11.2006 (Ad-hoc basis).
But we regret to inform you that despite our best
of services during the contract period a sum of
Rs.24,68,000/towards
Non
deployment,
Rs.17,10,000/towards
Non
compliance
and
4,96,850/- towards both way loading containers i.e
total of Rs.46,74,850/- was deducted from our freight
bill during the period of April, 2005 to 15th April, 2006
without any justified reason nor considering the
practical aspects in RTO operation at DCT.
We request your kind attention to our earlier letters
dated 22.11.2005; 21.012006; 31.01.2006; 03.02.2006
; 10.4.2006; 19.06.2006; 23.08.2006; 23.09.2006;
25.10.2006; 27.11.2006; 8.12.2006, 26.12.2006 and
22.01.2007. Copy of our letter dated 8.12.2006 and
22.01.2007 is enclosed.

OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 3 of 17

We brought to your kind notice that a sum of
Rs.46,74,850/- (Ruppes Forty six lacs Seventy four
thousand Eight hundred Fifty only) was deducted from
our freight bill in the name of non deployment of
vehicles, non compliance of job order and both way
loading containers for the period mentioned above.
In this regard, we wrote several letters to General
Manager and Chief General Manager-NR (details
already sent to you) for waiver of the unjustified
deductions in the name of non deployment of vehicles,
non compliance of job order and both way loading
containers. However, we did not receive any response
in this matter and your official concerned kept on
imposing deductions. The facts and evidence in this
connection already submitted to all of you as below:1.

There is no provision in the aforesaid contract
for wrong deductions in the name of “penalty
due to non-deployment of vehicles”

2.

The aforementioned Penalties had no justified
basis e.g. the so called penalties were imposed
on the day also, while the vehicles remained
standing idle in the yard or nearby the yard.

3.

Though there is mentioning of the 10 vehicles
having the size of 40’ length and 40 vehicles
having the size of 20’ length to be deployed for
the work of CONCOR, For smooth working of
the terminal, your concerned officials had
been ‘directing us regularly not to park
empty trailers in the yard (as the same
remained deployed for your work as per clause
mentioned in the contract failing which we as a
RTO might be considered as violator of this
clause). This compelled us to keep the aforesaid
empty trailers away from the yard at our cost,
risk & expenses. We facilitated you to utilize the

OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 4 of 17

vacated space. We must not have been penalized
for honoring the directions issued to us from
time to time orally as well as written by your
various concerned officials e.g refer your letter
dated 02.05.2005, 03.06.2005 and 13.04.2005.
We completely fulfilled the spirit of terms and
conditions of the agreement.
4.

We used to deploy more than 50 trailers for your
work in any given day as the trailers go away for
delivery/destination having the distance of more
than 75 kilometers ( some time more than 300
kilometers) and the same did not use to come on
return on the next day. However, we used to
execute the job order for the next day also
without waiting for the aforementioned trailers
yet to be returned on the next day and we had to
deploy the additional vehicles without much
waiting the aforesaid vehicle yet to be returned
on the next day.

5.

After the execution of the aforesaid agreement,
certain unforeseen legal implications caused the
trailers could enter in Delhi only from Badarpur
Border, this new legal binding on the trailers
caused certain trailers not to reach at your yard
on the same day from NCR area. The turnaround
time for the vehicle became more time
consuming and expensive.

6.

The trailers were unnecessarily delayed by the
customers by detaining vehicles at their
factory/premises after assurances of unloading
on the same day.

7.

No advance letter/notice as per the contract
clause was ever served upon us to increase or
decrease the number of vehicle to be deployed
for your work.

OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 5 of 17

We suffered very badly and incurred huge losses. Due
to increase of the operational cost like – increase in
tyre price, toll tax, long distance turn cuts of the road
to reach the destination, resulting in more fuel and
other expenditures.

4.

The said letter dated 4th July, 2007 to the Managing Director

was also not replied. Various other letters dated 22.11.2005;
21.012006;

31.01.2006;

03.02.2006;

10.4.2006;

25.10.2006;

27.11.2006;

19.06.2006;
8.12.2006,

26.12.2006 and 22.01.2007 addressed to General Manager and
Chief General Manager copies of some of which were sent with this
letter were also not replied. Rather a letter dated 20th July, 2007
from Sr. General Manager/Domestic Div. was sent intimating that
an amount of Rs.30,64,000/- is to be refunded after adjusting
another amount of

Rs.11,14,000/- imposed as penalty on

rechecking of the bills which will be refunded subject to furnishing
bank guarantee for a period of six months. It is pertinent to note
that the petitioner has challenged the levy of Rs.46,74,850/- as
penalty deducted from his bills which letter was sent by the
petitioner on 8th December, 2006. The letter dated 4th July, 2007
demanding appointment of arbitrator in terms of arbitration
agreement was also not replied. In reply to letter dated 20th July,

OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 6 of 17

2007, the petitioner sent letter dated 3rd August, 2007 to the
Managing Director protesting against re-checking of penalties on
the ground that the bills were raised on monthly basis and were
found to be in order after due verification and even security
deposits

had

been

refunded

after

issuance

of

‘NO

DUES

CERTIFICATE’ and contended that rechecking is nothing but
harassment to the petitioner and attempt not to pay the amount
due to him and again prayed for release of Rs.30,64,000/- which
according to the petitioner was liable to be released as per the
admission of the respondent.

5.

The petitioner thereafter, filed the petition under section 9 of

the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking refund of
Rs.30,40,000/- and another petition under section 11 (6) of the
Arbitration

and

Conciliation

Act,

1996

for

appointment

of

arbitrator as the respondent had failed to appoint an arbitrator
within thirty days of demand being made by letter dated 4th July,
2006 and before filing of the petition for appointment of an
arbitrator which was filed on 7th August, 2007.

6.

In

these

circumstances,

OMP No. 437 of 2007

on

4th

December,

2007

the

Page 7 of 17

respondent’s counsel was directed to take instructions to deposit
the amount which the petitioner may be allowed to withdraw
subject to furnishing security.

7.

On 17th December, 2007 the counsel for the respondent was

asked as to for what period prior to April, 2005 the records have
been rechecked in order to ascertain whether the penalties are
leviable for

period prior to 1st April, 2005. The allegation of the

petitioner was that rechecking has been ordered merely to deny
him the amount which is already due to him and to harass him.
The counsel for the respondent stated that penalties for one year
had been definitely checked, however, he again stated that the
penalties for two years have been rechecked. Thereafter, he again
stated that he is not certain as to for how many years the penalties
have been rechecked and therefore, he took instructions from Mr.
Pankaj Sahani who was present, who, however, stated that the
penalties have been rechecked for entire period and an amount of
about Rs.5.53 lakhs more has been found due.

8.

In the present application which is signed by the counsel for

the respondent Mr. Joshi, some of the facts have been twisted. On
OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 8 of 17

17th December, 2007 when the counsel was unable to answer with
certainty as to for how many years prior to April, 2005 penalties
have been rechecked, he turned back, called the person, Mr Pankaj
Sahani, senior supervisor who stated that penalties have been
checked and an amount of about Rs.5.53 lakhs more have been
found due. In the present application it is contended that said
senior supervisor meant clearly that about Rs.5.53 was due in
respect of the records which have been verified and in regard to the
records which have yet to be verified the amount is still not known
and Mr. Sahani is a very low official in the hierarchy and the
respondent has not checked the penalties for all the years.

9.

This is nothing but persistence of the respondent to mislead

this Court. If Mr. Sahani was a very low official in the hierarchy,
the counsel for the respondent Mr. Joshi should not have taken
instruction from him nor should have produced him on 17th
December, 2007 and should have stated that he does not know the
correct position. Even in this application, it is not stated as to up
to which period prior to April, 2005 the penalties have been
rechecked in five months after 20th July, 2007. The application is
not supported by the affidavit of Mr. Sahani and/or Mr. Joshi,
learned counsel for the respondent, who has also been making
OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 9 of 17

contradictory statements.

10.

The present application seeking exemption from appearance

of Managing Director also states facts contrary to what transpired
in the Court on 17th December, 2007 and is an attempt to improve
the version of the respondent and is supported by an affidavit of
the Chief General Manager. The Chief General Manager, Northern
Region who was not present on 17th December, 2007 has given an
affidavit in support of this application on the basis of his personal
knowledge. As he was not present he could not swear an affidavit
on the basis of his personal knowledge. The said official could not
give an affidavit in respect of what transpired on 17th December,
2007 as the copy of the said order was not available to the
respondent and therefore on the basis of alleged record, the
averments could not be made in the application seeking exemption
from personal appearance of the Managing Director. Apparently the
officials of the Respondent are consistently trying to mislead this
Court and their counsel Mr. Joshi has also taken different stands
and has tried to improve the version of the respondent in present
application which is signed by him. The behavior of Mr. Joshi,
learned counsel for the respondent is also not appreciable in the
facts

and

circumstances

OMP No. 437 of 2007

who

has

tried

to

cover

up

the

Page 10 of 17

irregularities of the respondent and its officials.

11.

The plea that the Managing Director of the respondent is the

executive head of the respondent corporation and normally he is
very busy from early morning till late in the evening and he has to
meet number of officers from different offices situated all over India
besides number of outside visitors and so he cannot appear is also
reflective of utter disregard which the respondent corporation and
its official and counsel for the respondent has for the Court. The
plea is almost contemptuous.

12.

The Learned Additional Solicitor General Mr. Singh in these

circumstances further contends that this Court does not have
jurisdiction to direct the Managing Director to appear under
Section 9 of the Arbitration and conciliation Act. Section 9 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is as under:

9.Interim measures etc.by Court
.- A party may, before, or during arbitral proceedings or at any
time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced
in accordance with section 36, apply to a court-

OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 11 of 17

(i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or person
of unsound mind for the purposes of arbitral proceedings;
or
(ii) for an interim measure or protection in respect of any of
the following matters, namely:(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any
goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration
agreement;
(b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration;
(c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any
property or thing which is the subject-matter of the
dispute in arbitration, or as to which any question
may arise therein and authorising for any of the
aforesaid purposes any person to enter upon any
land or building in the possession of any party or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation
to be made, or experiment to be tried, which may be
necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining
full information or evidence;
(d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver;
(e) such other interim measure of protection as may
appear to the Court to be just and convenient,
and the Court shall have the same power for making orders as it
has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before
it.

13.

From the perusal of the relevant provisions it is apparent

that this Court can direct for the security of the amount which is
in dispute in the arbitration and can pass such other interim measures which may appear to the Court to be just and convenient.
This Court has power to ascertain whether the penalties have been
imposed on rechecking with a view to harass the petitioner or the
OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 12 of 17

rechecking is being done with a view to delay the payment of
amount which was found due to the petitioner by the respondent
itself. For any of the measures as contemplated under section 9 of
the act, the court has the power to direct any petitioner or respondent to appear in person. The argument of the learned Additional
Solicitor General that the presence can be directed only in exercise
of jurisdiction under article 226 of the constitution of India in the
present facts and circumstances is without any legal and factual
basis.

14.

The learned counsel for the respondent has also relied on

2007 (11) SCALE 556, State of Gujrat Vs Turabali Gulamhussain &
anr to contend that the Managing Director of the respondent
should not be summoned. Perusal of the case relied on by the respondent reflects that it is apparently distinguishable. In this case
the Chief secretary and the law secretary of the State government
were summoned to explain the delay of 25 days in filing the appeal.
The Apex court had held that no doubt that the High Court has
power to someone the officials but it should be done in exceptional
cases when there are compelling circumstances to do so. In the
present facts and circumstances of this case various letters to the
various officials and the managing director were not replied rather

OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 13 of 17

proceedings for imposing the penalty by rechecking were initiated
and an amount of rupees than11,14,000/- was again imposed as
an amount of Rs.45,74,850/- had already been deducted on account of penalties. For refund of the amount found Rs.30,64,000/due, the condition of bank guarantee was imposed. The rechecking
of bills prior to April, 2005 was apparently decided to harass the
petitioner as the security amount for this period had been refunded
after issuance of “NO DUES CERTIFICATE” by the manager of
DCT. Though in July, 2007 it was stated that the rechecking shall
be done for the period prior to April, 2005, till December, 2007 the
counsel Mr. Joshi was giving different versions and after he took
instructions from an official on 17th December, 2007 it was stated
in the court that the bills prior to April, 2005 had been rechecked
and an the amount of about Rs. 5.30 lakhs more was found due on
account of the penalties. Now by this application a new version is
being propounded that the official did not have the correct knowledge. Even in this application it is not disclosed as to for what
period the accounts have been rechecked and what amounts have
been found due on account of penalties. The application is supported by the affidavit of another official who could not have personal knowledge about the order passed on 17th December, 2007.
There is consistent effort by the officials of the respondent corporation to mislead and even by the counsel to given different versions.
OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 14 of 17

Whether these acts are within the knowledge of the Managing Director or even managing director is a party to it, can be ascertained
only if he is present. The letters written to Managing Director has
not been replied consistently. Perhaps he does not have the time to
deal with the complaints made against the officials of the corporation and the other officials feels that he is too busy and more important jobs with him than to appear in this Court. It is also not
clear whether almost contemptuous application for exemption for
appearance of managing director was filed at the instance of Managing Director himself or it has been filed by other officials to conceal their misdeeds and apparent harassment to the petitioner. In
the circumstances, this is one of the exceptional cases where the
Managing Director must appear before this Court. In any case a
managing director of a corporation can not equate himself with the
Chief Secretary or any other secretary of a State. Even the Chief
Secretary and Secretaries can be directed to appear in appropriate
cases and they cannot plead that they are too busy or above law.

15.

In Ambica Quarry Works v. State of Gujarat and Ors.

MANU/SC/0049/1986

the Supreme Court had observed:-

"The ratio of any decision must be understood in
the background of the facts of that case. It has
been said long time ago that a case is only an

OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 15 of 17

authority for what it actually decides, and not
what logically follows from it."

In Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd
(2003) 2 SC 111 (vide para 59), the Supreme observed:" It is well settled that a little difference in facts
or additional facts may make a lot of difference
in the precedential value of a decision."

16.

When this Court is considering the application for appoint-

ment of arbitrator as the respondent had not appointed the arbitrator till the time of filing of the petition under Section 11 (6) of the
Act and after expiry of thirty days and regarding the interim protection granted to the petitioner, it is not discharging administrative
functions only and acting mechanically but is discharging its judicial functions. If this Court is discharging the judicial functions,
the presence of the parties can be secured especially the managing
director of the Corporation whose officials has consistently misled
this Court and has not disclosed the complete facts and have filed
an application with almost contemptuous pleas and grounds. This
is nothing but sheer abuse of process of Courts by the respondent.

OMP No. 437 of 2007

Page 16 of 17

17.

For these reasons and in the present facts and circum-

stances the application for exemption of appearance of the managing director of the respondent is, therefore, dismissed. The presence of the managing director for today is however, exempted as
the copy of the order dated 17th April, 2007 was not available to the
respondent. The managing director of the respondent is now directed to appear before this Court on 25th January, 2008. A copy of
this order be given Dasti to the counsel for the parties. List on 25th
January, 2008 as a part heard matter along with AA 343 OF 2007,
M/s Indo Arya Central Transport Ltd. Vs Container Corporation of
India which is also a part heard matter.
