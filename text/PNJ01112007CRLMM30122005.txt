PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
Petitioners

are

aggrieved

by

the

order

dated

19.1.2005 summoning them to face trial for the offences under
Sections 420/467/468/120-B IPC.
2.

The order reads as under :“Present: Shri Rajesh Tyagi, advocate for the
complainant Madan Mohan
At his request complainant is exempted for today.
Arguments heard at length.
page 1 of 6

Pre-summoning evidence perused.
In my
considered view, offence is made out u/s 420/467 &
468 I.P.C. r/w 120B I.P.C. Against all the accused
persons.
All accused be accordingly summoned on filing of
P.F. and Dasti for 21.05.05.
Learned Counsel states that accused no.3, S.S.
Bhalla has already died and wishes to withdraw the
complaint against him. The remaining accused
persons be summoned.
3.

It is urged by learned counsel for the petitioners that

howsoever brief the reasons may be, the order summoning a
person to face trial for a criminal offence must reflect that the
learned Magistrate has applied his mind to the facts of the case
and has applied the law thereto; that the learned Magistrate
has examined the nature of the allegations and evidence, both
oral and documentary, in support thereof and prima facie
recorded sufficiency thereof to opine that an offence has been
made out.
4.

Learned counsel for the petitioners relies upon a

decision of the Supreme Court reported as AIR 1998 SC 128
Pepsi Foods Ltd. Vs. Special Judicial Magistrate & Ors.
5.

In dictionary the word 'cognizance' is defined as

under :'knowledge or awareness; the action of taking
judicial notice; a distinctive devise or mark,
especially as formerly worn by retainers of a noble
house.'

page 2 of 6

6.

Cognizance is co-existant when a person is in a state

of cognition.
7.

8.

In the dictionary 'cognition' is defined as under :'The mental action or process of acquiring
knowledge through thought, experience and the
senses ; perception, sensation or intuition resulting
from this.'
A summoning order is the order by which a learned

Magistrate evidences his act of taking cognizance of a
complaint.

Thus, it must reveal that the learned Magistrate

was in a state of cognition.
9.

The reasons which have led the learned Magistrate

to hold that prima facie offence is made out has therefore to be
discernible from the order. If not discernible from the order, it
would be left to guesswork as to on what basis learned
Magistrate directed summoning of the accused persons.
10.

What are reasons?

11.

The mental process which culminates in the decision

is reasoning.
12.

Howsoever brief reasons may be, they must reflect a

cognitive mind, i.e. a mind which has come to grips with the
factual matrix and has considered the law applicable thereto;
from the twin resulting the decision.
page 3 of 6

13.

The impugned order is bereft of all afore-noted

features.
14.

In para 27 of the decision in Pepsi Foods Ltd's case it

was noted as under :“27. Summoning of an accused in criminal cases is
a serious matter. Criminal law cannot be set into
motion as a matter of course. It is not that the
complainant has to bring only two witnesses to
support his allegations in the complaint to have the
criminal law set into motion. The order of the
magistrate summoning the accused must reflect
that he has applied his mind to the facts of the case
and the law applicable thereto. He has to examine
the nature of allegations made in the complaint and
the evidence both oral and documentary in support
thereof and would that be sufficient for the
complainant to succeed in bringing charge home to
the accused. It is not that the Magistrate is a silent
spectator at the time of recording of preliminary
evidence before summoning of the accused.
Magistrate has to carefully scrutinse the evidence
brought on record and may even himself put
questions to the complainant and his witnesses to
elicit answers to find out the truthfulness of the
allegations or otherwise and then examine if any
offence if prima facie committed by all or any of the
accused.”
15.

Factual backdrop of the instant case is that the

complainant had entered into 2 agreements with petitioners 5
and 6. He alleged that petitioners 1 and 3 who are chartered
accountants were giving him professional advise and had in
fact induced him to enter into the agreements with petitioners
5 and 6. Petitioners 2 and 4 are the wives of petitioners 1
and 3

page 4 of 6

respectively. Complainant alleged that they were conspirators.
16.

In respect of the agreements, civil proceedings by

way of Suit No.501/2002 were already pending in this court on
the original side when the complaint in question was filed.
17.

What was required to be considered by the learned

Magistrate was, whether the transactions in question were
purely civil in nature.

What was further required to be

considered by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate was whether
there was any material to hold that petitioners 1 and 3 as
professional

chartered

petitioners 5 and 6.

accountants

had

conspired

with

What was required to be further

considered by the Magistrate was whether petitioner No.2 who
is a housewife had any role in the formulation of the agreement
between the parties.

What was further required to be

considered by the learned Magistrate was whether there was
any material wherefrom conspiracy could be inferred.

18.

Suffice would it be to state that where a civil

transaction takes colour of criminal litigation, the summoning
order must bring out, howsoever briefly it may be so, the
contours of the criminality involved.
19.

I thus dispose of the petition quashing the order

dated 19.1.2005 summoning petitioners as accused persons.

page 5 of 6

20.

Further, I clarify that it would be open to the learned

Metropolitan Magistrate to revisit the evidence and after
recording reasons, howsoever brief they may be, if case is
made out to summon any person accused in the complaint for
an offence to pass appropriate orders.
21.

No costs.
