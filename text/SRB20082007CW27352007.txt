Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat:
1.

The writ petitioners seek directions under Article 226 of the Constitution to

the respondent to impart training of school experience programme (hereafter SEP)
and to allow them to appear in the first year examination.

2.

In WP Nos 2735 and 2743/ 2007 the facts are that the Petitioners applied

for the entrance exam of two year course for Eliminatory Teacher Education (ETE,
hereafter "the course") conducted by State council of Research & Training of
National Capital region of Delhi. They qualified in the written test; the respondent
WP(C) No. 2735, W.P.(C) 2743, W.P.(C) 3000 of 2007

2 of 12

advertised in the newspaper for the first counseling. At the time of counseling
candidates of the reserved category were called. Despite figuring in the merit list,
the candidates were allotted seats in reserved categories. It is alleged that they
should have been allotted seats in the general category, according to the rules.
3.

The petitioners filed writ petitions. This court issued notice; after a hearing,

the petitions were allowed by this court, on 12-2-2007. The respondents were
directed to admit the petitioners with immediate effect. However, the Respondents
delayed the process for 10 days; the Petitioners were granted admission on
28.02.07 . The respondents did not allow the petitioners to participate in the SEP.
It is alleged that the Director SCERT allegedly issued instructions to the principals
of the training institutes that 85% attendance is necessary to complete the training
session. The petitioners were not allowed to deposit their examination form as they
did not have 85% attendance.

4.

In WP 3000/2007, the Petitioner, Reena Mann seeks directions to the

respondents to impart training of school experience programme (hereafter SEP)
and to allow her to appear in the first year examination. The facts in her case are
that she appeared in the entrance test of Diploma course in Elementary teacher
Education (ETE) on 4th June 2006. She qualified the said exam and her rank in the

WP(C) No. 2735, W.P.(C) 2743, W.P.(C) 3000 of 2007

3 of 12

merit list was C-71/0-03407 (private institution and sports category). Her
counseling was to be held on 29.7.2006 but she could not appear as she was
unwell. Thereafter she went to the office of the Respondent and requested them do
consider her; the request was not acceded to. She approached this court and the
Respondents were by an interim order directed by the court to allow her for
counseling and admit her to the course.
5.

The petitioner allegedly went for the counseling and her candidature was

rejected there on the ground that her sports certificate was not valid. Her writ
petition was allowed by an order dated 11.12.2006 and the Respondents were
directed to admit her. The said order was not complied with. The Petitioner filed
contempt proceedings. Thereafter, she received a letter dated 19.2.2007 from the
Director of Respondent no.2 asking her to report to the Controller of Examinations
within a week of receipt of the admission no ETC course 2006-2008. The
Petitioner’s admission was considered and she was granted admission in ETE
course in the session 2006-2008 under sports category on 28.2.2007.
6.

It is alleged that on 8.3.2007 the petitioner requested the Respondent no.2 to

organize School Education Practice (SEP)/ teaching practice before the final
exams but her request was not acceded to. She was not issued with the
examination form for the reason that she had not fulfilled the requisite conditions.
The Petitioner avers that the Respondents delayed her admission process. She
WP(C) No. 2735, W.P.(C) 2743, W.P.(C) 3000 of 2007

4 of 12

cannot be faulted for non compliance with norms, because that was on account of
the respondent's deliberate and wilful conduct. Since her admission she had been
attending her classes regularly.
7.

The Ld. Counsel, in all the cases submit that the attendance of the

petitioners had to be reckoned from the date of their admission. The respondent
could not take refuge in the attendance norms to defeat the petitioner's legitimate
claim, because they were guilty in the first instance of not admitting them. The
petitioners were forced to approach this court; in Renu Maan's case, despite
interim orders, the respondents did not give admission. The writ petition was
allowed in December, 2006; yet admission was given only in end of February,
2007. In the other cases, the respondents wrongly did not admit the petitioners;
their writ petitions were finally allowed on 12-2-2007. They had approached the
court in September, 2006. In these circumstances, the insistence of the respondents
that the attendance norms have to be adhered to strictly, on the basis of total
number of classes held, is unjustified.
8.

The Petitioners submitted that the SEP test of 100 marks is internal

assessment and that they have been regularly attending the classes including even
for the period when other students went on preparatory leave. It is submitted that
if the condition of 3-4 months of formal training/ teaching experience is essential

WP(C) No. 2735, W.P.(C) 2743, W.P.(C) 3000 of 2007

5 of 12

for each student then it is impossible for the students who were admitted in
February 2003 to appear in their examination. Counsel relied on 2003 IV. AD
(Delhi) Ms. Manju Vs. Lt. Governor & Ors to say that such conditions cannot be
insisted upon; the petitioners can be allowed to appear in the examination, and get
promoted to the second year.
9.

Ms. Avnish Ahlawat contended that the respondents were directed to grant

admission to the Petitioner Ms. Maan, under the sports quota, the certificate
produced by the Petitioner was disputed. The Letters Patent Appeal filed by the
respondents was decided on 16.1.2007 leaving it open to the respondent to dispute
the sports certificate, if fresh or new materials were available. It was thus clarified
that in future validity of a certificate issued by the krida bharti can always be
questioned in accordance with law after placing relevant materials on record. As
regards the other cases, counsel submitted that the judgment directing their
admissions, on 12-2-2007, had reserved the condition that the Petitioners will be
required to adhere/complete all the requirements/ norms of the examination cell,
SCERT in all respects prior to appearing in the examination.
10.

The Ld. Counsel submitted that a student can appear in the examination

only if he/she fulfills the required rules prescribed in the prospectus. Learned
counsel submitted that SEP (students' education programme) course is held in the

WP(C) No. 2735, W.P.(C) 2743, W.P.(C) 3000 of 2007

6 of 12

first year; it should be undergone by students of the ETC course. The students who
missed the SEP or who have less than 85% attendance or have obtained less than
50% marks will not be entitled for promotion to the 2 nd year. The SEP course is
mandatory before a student can appear for 1st year examination.
11.

The Learned Counsel further submitted that in normal course the court

would not have allowed admission at belated stage in a professional course like
ETT where both practicals and theory are given equal importance. Both are
necessary in order to get a degree of ETE. Counsel submitted that passing SEP is a
must in the ETE course; it is a separate paper of 100 marks. The SEP comprises of
3 months training in the MCD/NDMC/ directorate of Education Schools
conducted by the SCERT from October to December every year and non
appearance in SEP will not absolve the Petitioners from fulfilling the necessary
criteria for promotion to the 2nd year ETE course.
12.

Learned counsel placed reliance on the decision reported as Rohit Singhal

and others V. Principal Jawahar N. Vidyalaya & others reported as (2003) 1 SCC
687 in which the Supreme court held that regular attendance and receiving
instructions are a must even if there is no fault is not on part of the student.
Counsel also further relied on Maharshi Dayanand university V. Dr. Anto Joseph
and others reported as 1998 (6) SCC 215 in which the Supreme Court held that
requirements in professional courses are prescribed down to ensure that the full
WP(C) No. 2735, W.P.(C) 2743, W.P.(C) 3000 of 2007

7 of 12

period of training necessary for acquiring the qualification is completed and it is in
public interest that they are not lightly deviated from.
13.

Counsel for contended that ETE course is a 2 years course to train the

students for the post of Assistant teacher. She further contended that the petitioners
were admitted into the course in February 2007 subject to the condition that it
would not absolve them from fulfilling any other criteria which are necessary for
taking up the examination and obtaining the Diploma in ETC course. Counsel
urged that there was no delay by the SCERT in granting admission. It was lastly
contended that the petitioners would be permitted to attend classes in the first year,
and appear in the end of the term, provided they make up the attendance and other
norms; they would not be required to seek admission as fresh or new candidates.
14.

The conspectus of facts discussed above shows that in the cases of

petitioners in WP 2735 & 2743/2007, the respondent did not grant them admission
in 2006 initially having regard to the manner in which counseling had to be carried
out in respect of reserved category candidates. The matter was settled in their
favour on 12-2-2007. The court directed the respondents to admit them; they were
admitted on 28-2-2007. In WP 3000/2007, the petitioner had occasion to approach
the court earlier as the respondents were refusing to admit her; the rationale was
that they did not recognize the sports certificate relied upon by her. Initially an
interim order was made; it was apparently not complied with; the writ petition was
WP(C) No. 2735, W.P.(C) 2743, W.P.(C) 3000 of 2007

8 of 12

allowed on 11-12-2006; the Division Bench dismissed the respondents' appeal on
16-1-2007. The student was able to secure admission only on 28-2-2007.
15.

There is no doubt that in both cases, all the students were kept out of the

course due to the actions of the respondents, which were declared unlawful. The
question is therefore, whether in these circumstances they can claim special
equities, for not fulfilling the minimum attendance norms, spelt out for the course,
and also not fulfilling the criteria of having to qualify the SEP which is mandatory,
(under which the candidate has to perform actual three months teaching) he or she
is examined on that score; the marks allocated for the test are 100.
16.

The conditions relied upon by the respondents read as follows:
" 2. Students shall not be allowed to appear in the theory
examinations in case their attendance is less than 85% attendance in
the session. These students shall not be promoted to IInd year. They will
have to seek readmission in the 1st year. Relaxation of 5% in shortage
of attendance can be granted by the Principal of Institute and
additional relaxation of 10% in attendance may be also granted by the
Director, SCERT on medical ground or extra ordinary circumstances
on the merit of the case.

5.
Students shall not be promoted from 1st year to 2nd year
course if they have missed their SEP (School Education Programme) or
have less than 85% attendance after relaxation or have secured less
than 50% marks in SEP."

WP(C) No. 2735, W.P.(C) 2743, W.P.(C) 3000 of 2007

9 of 12

17.

It is evident from a reading of the above that much emphasis is placed by

the ETE course on attendance; a very high minimum percentage of 85% norm has
been prescribed. That is relaxable ordinarily by 5%. A further 10% relaxation on
medical grounds, or extraordinary circumstances is permissible. That would mean
that given all concessions, the candidate has to under all circumstances, attend at
least 70% of the classes. That norm is not under challenge here; it cannot therefore
be undermined by the court. The question is whether the court can direct the
respondents to ignore that, and the condition of having qualify in the SEP (which
the petitioners admittedly did not, as it was conducted before their admission) in
the circumstances of the case.
18.

In several judgments, such as Medical Council of India -vs- Madhu Singh

2002 (7) SCC 258; Maharshi Dayanand University -vs- Dr. Anto Joseph 1998 (6)
SCC 215; C.B.S.E & Anr -vs- P. Sunil Kumar 1998 (5) SCC 377, the Supreme
Court has cautioned the courts against taking a liberal approach in regard to
compliance with eligibility and attendance norms. It has been ruled that such
requirements are laid down to ensure that the full period of training necessary for
acquiring the qualification is completed and it is in the public interest that they are
not lightly deviated from. In Dental Council of India -vs- Subharati KKB
Charitable Trust 2001 (5) SCC 486, the Supreme Court affirmed the observations
in State of Maharashtra v. Vikas Sahebrao Roundale ((1992) 4 SCC 435) as
WP(C) No. 2735, W.P.(C) 2743, W.P.(C) 3000 of 2007

10 of 12

follows:
"Slackening the standard and judicial fiat to control the mode of education
and examining system are detrimental to the efficient management of the
education."

19.

There is no doubt that the quandry faced by the petitioners is not of their

making. They should have been given admission in time; they sought recourse to
law and were successful. Yet these equities should not, in my opinion blind the
court into waiving what are clearly public interest norms prescribed for uniform
adherence. As is often said, hard cases make bad law.
20.

In the above circumstances, the relief claimed by these petitioners cannot be

granted, since they did not possess the minimum attendance norms, nor did they
qualify in the SEP. The respondents need not declare their results. Nevertheless, it
would be a complete travesty of justice if the petitioners are denied relief
altogether. In the circumstances of the case, having regard to the stand of the
respondents that the petitioners would be continued, but in the first year, the
respondents are hereby directed not to collect fees for the current academic session
(for 2007-2008), i.e. the first year of the present petitioners. The respondents shall
continue the petitioners as first year candidates. In the peculiar circumstances of
the case, although the reliefs claimed are not being granted, the respondents shall

11 of 12

bear costs of these proceedings, quantified at Rs. 15,000/- for each petitioner. The
costs shall be paid to them within four weeks.
21.

The writ petitions are dismissed, but subject to the directions to the

respondents in para 20 above.
