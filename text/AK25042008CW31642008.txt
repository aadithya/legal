for another year in service as Principal of the Arya Samaj Girls

per

the

terms

and

conditions

provided

in

Circular

No.F.30-

3(28)/Coord./2006/3398-3411. The petitioner has further sought a
declaration that she continues to hold the post of Vice-Principal of the
said school till 30th April, 2008 as per Rule 110 of Delhi School
Education Act and Rules, 1973.

The petitioner contended that she attained the age of 60 years on
29th February, 2008 and in accordance with Rule 110 of Delhi School
Education Act and Rules she was to be re-employed as Vice-Principal of
the school till 30th April, 2008.

The petitioner’s grievance is that she has been re-employed only
upto 31st March, 2008 which is in gross violation of the Rule 110 of
Delhi School Education Act and Rules and, therefore, the petitioner is
deemed to be continuing as a Vice-Principal upto 30th April, 2008. The
petitioner is stated to have made a representation to the respondents,
however, the case of the petitioner has been rejected by order dated 24th
March, 2008.

A Division Bench of this Court in Kathuria Public School and Ors
Vs. Director of Education and Anr, 2005 VI AD (Delhi) 893 relying on
T.M.A.Pai Foundation Vs. State of Karnataka, AIR 2003 SC 345 had
held that it is advisable that the specialized Tribunal constituted should
look after the legal matters relating to hearing of grievances of
teachers and employees. The Division Bench relying on T.M.A.Pai
Foundation (Supra) had held that specialized Tribunal should hear any
grievance of the teacher. It was further held that no restriction has been
placed on the scope and ambit of the consideration of the grievances of
the teacher or employee by the Tribunal and consequently the Tribunal
should be able to hear all the grievances including in respect of
suspension of a teacher or an employee and, therefore, the Tribunal
constituted under the Delhi School Education Act should be able to
hear all the grievances of the staff and teachers and not necessarily as
restricted to in sub Section (2) of Section 8 of the said Act. The Division
Bench in para 42 at page 910 had held as under:“42.

No restriction has been placed on the scope and

ambit of the consideration of the grievances of the teacher
or employee by the Tribunal. Under the said Act in
question, the Tribunal is already constituted. Thus, all that
is to be done is that the Tribunal should be able to hear all
grievances including in respect of suspension by a teacher

or an employee. Taking into consideration the observations
made by the Apex Court in T.M.A.Pai Foundation case
(supra), we are of the considered view that pending
necessary legislative action by the State, the Tribunal
constituted should be able to hear all grievances of the
staff and teacher and not necessarily as restricted to in
sub Section (2) of Section 8 of the said Act. The result
would be that if a teacher is aggrieved by a suspension
order or its prolongation, the grievance can be made before
the Tribunal depending upon the fact and circumstances of
the case.”

Considering the facts and circumstances the petitioner has an
alternative remedy to approach the Tribunal constituted under the
Delhi School Education Act, 1973 for the direction to the respondents to
allow her to hold the office of Vice Principal of the respondent No.4
school upto 30th April, 2008 and that she is entitled for appointment on
contract basis for a period of one year which is extendable for another
year as a principal of respondent No.4.

Therefore, in the facts and circumstances this Court is not
exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
and it is for the petitioner to exhaust her alternative remedy available to
her under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973 and to
approach Delhi School Tribunal.
In the circumstances, the writ petition is disposed of with liberty
to the petitioner to approach Delhi School Tribunal under the Delhi
School Education Act, 1973 or to invoke any other remedy, if available
to her. With these directions the writ petition and all pending
applications are disposed of.
Dasti to the counsel for the Petitioner.
