A.K. Seth in a road accident.
3.

Deceased

A.K.

Seth,

was

serving

as

Deputy

Commissioner of Police in Delhi Police and on 24.4.1992,
was driving his maruti car No. DIB 4649 at about 5.00 a.m.
near Swami Nagar, DTC Bus Stop on main outer ring road
while returning from his official duty at I.G.I. Airport, New
Delhi. The deceased was going on correct side of the road,
when all of a sudden a truck bearing No. HR-26-A-5448
came from behind, which was driven at a very fast speed,
rashly and negligently by respondent No. 2 and overtook
the car of deceased from its right side and suddenly
swerved to his left side while applying sudden brakes. The
truck almost came ahead of the car and the car struck
against the rear of the truck and in that process the
deceased sustained head injuries.

The deceased was

removed to the A.I.I.M.S., where he was treated but he
succumbed to injuries in the hospital on 22.5.92.

The

truck is owned by respondent No.1 and is insured with
respondent No. 3.
4.

Notice of this appeal was issued to all the respondents

who put in appearance through their respective counsel
FAO No.185/1997

Page 3 of 14

and sought time for filing reply, but no reply was filed on
behalf of any of the respondents.
5.

On 20th July, 1999, none was present on behalf of

appellants whereas Shri B.S. Mann, Advocate was present
for respondents No. 1 and 2 and Shri. S.C. Dhanda,
Advocate

has

put

in

appearance

on

behalf

of

the

respondent No. 3 and the appeal was admitted.
6.

Prior to that, none appeared on behalf of the

appellants on 21.9.1998, 7.1.1999 and 10.2.1999.
7.

On 2.2.2007, none was present and the matter was

renotified for 5.2.2007 and on that date also none was
present on behalf of the appellants and as such the case
was reserved for judgment.
8.

The decision of the learned Tribunal has been

challenged by the appellants on various grounds.

It is

stated that the Tribunal erred in applying the multiplier of
10 years and it ought to have applied the multiplier of 18
years. Promotion avenues and the recommendation of Fifth
Pay Commission were also not taken in to consideration.
No weightage was given to the fact that family of the
deceased was enjoying certain perks allowed by the
FAO No.185/1997

Page 4 of 14

Government by virtue of the service of the deceased. The
deceased was expected to earn main fold income after his
retirement.

No compensation was allowed on account of

total loss of the car involved in the accident and expenses
incurred

on the treatment while the deceased in the

hospital, was also disallowed. The learned Tribunal did not
allow the expenses incurred for engaging the attendant and
for daily diet and the funeral expenses were disallowed
wrongly by the Tribunal.
9.

With regard to the factum of accident, the defence of

respondent driver/owner is that deceased met with the
accident of his own rash and negligent driving and not due
to any fault or negligence on the part of the driver of the
truck.

The truck was in stationary position due to some

mechanical defect.
10.

The respondent driver has not led any evidence to

substantiate his

version regarding the accident. In fact,

the respondents absented during the trial. As per finding
of the learned Tribunal, the version of the appellants has
been duly substantiated. I do not find any reason to differ
with the conclusion arrived at by the learned Tribunal on
FAO No.185/1997

Page 5 of 14

this aspect.
11.

Regarding age of the deceased, as per statement of

PW-7, the date of the birth of deceased is 8.7.1950. The
accident has taken place on 24.4.1992.

So, at that time

deceased was about 42 years old.
12.

Now, coming to the monthly income of the deceased,

he was posted as Deputy Commissioner of Police in Delhi
Police and as per last pay certificate Exhibit PW 6/1, his
gross monthly salary was Rs. 8,724/- and after deductions,
the net salary was Rs. 4,620/-.
13.

The learned Tribunal has

assessed the income of

deceased as Rs. 12,500/- per month after taking into
consideration increase in future income. It has been held
by the learned Tribunal that:“ Since the higher estimate will be
taken into consideration for ascertaining
multiplicand from the initial stage itself,
when actually the gross salary was Rs.
8724/- with carry home salary of Rs.
4620/- and share of dependents being
Rs. 2887.50, this higher estimate of Rs.
12,500/- per month will take care of
increase in future income of the
deceased. Taking monthly gross income
of the deceased at the rate of Rs.
12,500/- per month means that annually
his income would be Rs. 1,50,000/-. This
FAO No.185/1997

Page 6 of 14

is subject to normal deductions on
account of income tax.
After giving
allowance for standard deductions and
maximum savings U/S 80 of the income
tax, income tax on the said sum comes to
Rs. 16,000/-. After deducting the same,
the income of the deceased comes to Rs.
1,34,000/-. One third thereof (i.e. Rs.
44,666/-) on account of his personal
expenses and one eighth thereof (in sum
of Rs. 5,582/-) towards his out of pocket
expenses means that out of his earning,
Rs. 50,248/- are to be deducted towards
his personal expenses. After doing, so, a
sum of Rs. 83,752/- p.a. is ascertained as
dependency
of
the
Legal
Representatives which will be adopted
as multiplicand.
The above mentioned multiplicand
is to be multiplied by an appropriate
multiplier which cannot exceed 18 and
which is to be chosen with reference to
the age of the deceased or dependents
whichever is higher. In this case, the
petitioners include wife and children of
the deceased who are younger to him.
Hence the age of the deceased will be
determining factor. He was nearly 42
years old.
In 1996 JT (5) SC 356,
multiplier
of
15
was
considered
appropriate to the deceased aged 35. In
1994 ACJ 1 the deceased was 39 years
old and multiplier of 12 was held
appropriate to his age.
In the
circumstances, at the most, multiplier of
10 can be adopted in the present case,
where the deceased was 41 years 11
months old. Calculating in this manner,
the compensation payable to the
petitioners comes to Rs. 8,37,520/-. To
this, sum of Rs., 10,000/- is to be added
FAO No.185/1997

Page 7 of 14

14.

as conventional sum by way of loss of
expectation of life as per ruling of JT
1996 (5) SC 356 referred to above (para
14 thereof). In addition to this, the
petitioners have been found entitled to
Rs. 8,700/- on account of attendant
charges. Total of all this comes to Rs.
8,56,220/-. They are further entitled to
interest thereon.
They are claiming
interest @ 24% p.a. However, interest
@ 12% p.a. has been awarded by
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in cases
1994 ACJ 1 and 1992 ACJ 300 and by
Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in cases
reported as 1993 (1) TAC 17, 1994(1)
TAC 233, 1994(1) TAC 237, 1992 ACJ
258, 1992 ACJ868 and 1996 ACJ 372.
Therefore, interest @ 12% p.a. is being
allowed in this case. The sum arrived at
with interest thereon is in fact near
about proportionate share of the
dependents out of gross income of
deceased as per Exhibit PW 11/1 and
this sum duly invested will yield interest
for maintenance of the petitioners. In
the circumstances, it is held just
compensation.”
So, the question to be seen is, as to whether the

compensation awarded by learned Tribunal is just or not.
15.

Section 168 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides

that; Claim Tribunals may make an award determining the
amount of compensation which appears to it to be “just”.
16.

In

the

case

State

Road

Transport

Corporation & Ors. vs. Trilok Chandra & Ors, (1996) 4

FAO No.185/1997

Page 8 of 14

SCC 362, the deceased aged about 26 years met with a
fatal road accident. The tribunal applied a multiplier of 24
years whereas, the High Court applied the multiplier of 34
years. So the question was whether the Tribunal was right
in applying the multiplier of 24 or the High Court was right
in applying multiplier of 34. It was held by the Apex Court
that:“4. India is one of the countries with the
highest number of road accidents.
Motor accidents are everyday affairs.
A large number or claims for
compensation for injury caused by
road accidents are pending in
various Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal.
In a fatal accident the
dependants of the deceased are
entitled to compensation for the loss
suffered by them on account of the
death. The most commonly practised
method of assessing the loss suffered
is to calculate the loss for a year and
then to capitalise the amount by a
suitable multiplier. To that is added
the loss suffered on account of loss of
expectation of life and the like. The
Tribunals and High Courts have
adopted
divergent
methods
to
determine the suitable multiplier.
Even this Court has not been
uniform;
maybe
because
the
principle on which this method came
to be evolved has been forgotten. It
has, therefore, become necessary to
examine the law and to state the
FAO No.185/1997

Page 9 of 14

5.

correct principles to be adopted.
The topic of compensation for
causing death by negligent driving
came up for serious discussion
before this Court in Gobald Motor
Service Ltd. vs. R.M.K. Veluswami,
AIR 1962 SC 1. The Court referred
to the House of Lords decision in
Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated
Collieries Ltd., 1942 AC 601 and
quoted the following passage from
the judgment:
“The damages are to
be based on the reasonable
expectation of pecuniary
benefit or benefit reducible
to money value.
In
assessing the damages all
circumstances which may
be legitimately pleaded in
diminution of the damages
must be considered. ...The
actual pecuniary loss of
each individual entitled to
sue can only be ascertained
by balancing, on the one
hand, the loss to him of the
future pecuniary benefit,
and, on the other any
pecuniary advantage which
from
whatever
source
comes to him by reason of
the death.”

6.The court also referred to the
judgment by Viscount Simon in
Nance v. British Columbia Electric
Rly. Co. Ltd. in which the same
principles were
enunciated for
estimating the damages, the method
FAO No.185/1997

Page 10 of 14

adopted however differed. Various
factors
that
would
enter
the
calculation as per Viscount Simon
were set out in the judgment as
under:
“....at first the deceased
man's expectation of life has to
be estimated having regard to
his age, bodily health and the
possibility
of
premature
determination of his life by
later accidents; secondly, the
amount required for the future
provision of his wife shall be
estimated having regard to the
amounts he used to spend on
her during his lifetime, and
other circumstances; thirdly,
the estimated annual sum is
multiplied by the number of
years of the man's estimated
span of life, and the said
amount must be discounted so
as to arrive at the equivalent in
the form of a lump sum payable
on his death; fourthly, further
deductions must be made for
the benefit accruing to the
widow from the acceleration of
her interest in his estate; and,
fifthly, further amounts have to
be deducted for the possibility
of the wife dying earlier if the
husband had lived the full span
of life; and it should also be
taken into account that there is
the possibility of the widow
remarrying
much
to
the
improvement of her financial
position. It would be seen from
the said mode of estimation
FAO No.185/1997

Page 11 of 14

that many imponderables enter
into the calculation.”
17.

Further held:“15. We thought it necessary to reiterate
the method of working out 'just'
compensation because, of late, we
have noticed from the awards made
by tribunals and courts that the
principle on which the multiplier
method was developed has been lost
sight of and once again a hybrid
method based on the subjectivity of
the Tribunal/Court has surfaced,
introducing uncertainty and lack of
reasonable uniformity in the matter
of determination of compensation. It
must
be
realised
that
the
Tribunal/Court has to determine a
fair
amount
of
compensation
awardable to the victim of an
accident
which
must
be
proportionate to the injury caused.
The two English decisions to which
we have referred earlier provide the
guidelines for assessing the loss
occasioned to the victims. Under the
formula advocated by Lord Wright in
Davies, the loss has to be ascertained
by first determining the monthly
income of the deceased, then
deducting therefrom the amount
spent on the deceased, and thus
assessing the loss to the dependants
of the deceased.
The annual
dependency assessed in this manner
is then to be multiplied by the use of
an appropriate multiplier.
Let us
illustrate: X, male, aged about
35years, dies in an accident.
He

FAO No.185/1997

Page 12 of 14

leaves behind his widow and 3 minor
children. His monthly income was Rs
3500. First, deduct the amount spent
on X every month. The rough and
ready method hitherto adopted
where no definite evidence was
forthcoming, was to break up the
family into units, taking two units for
an adult and one unit for a minor.
Thus X and his wife make 2+2=4
units and each minor one unit i.e. 3
units in all, totaling 7 units.
Thus
the share per unit works out to Rs
3500/7=Rs 500 per month. It can
thus be assumed that Rs 1000 was
spent on X. Since he was a working
member some provision for his
transport and out-of-pocket expenses
has to be estimated. In the present
case we estimate the out-of-pocket
expense at Rs 250. Thus the amount
spent on the deceased X works out to
Rs 1250 per month leaving a balance
of Rs 3500-1250=Rs 2250 per month.
This amount can be taken as the
monthly loss to X's dependants. The
annual dependency comes to Rs
2250x12=Rs 27,000.
This annual
dependency has to be multiplied by
the use of an appropriate multiplier
to assess the compensation under the
head of loss to the dependants. Take
the appropriate multiplier to be 15.
The compensation comes to Rs.
27,000x15=Rs 4,05,000. To this may
be added a conventional amount by
way of loss of expectation of life.
Earlier this conventional amount was
pegged down to Rs 3000 but now
having regard to the fall in the value
of the rupee, it can be raised to a
FAO No.185/1997

Page 13 of 14

18.

figure of not more than Rs 10,000.
Thus the total comes to Rs
4,05,000+10,000=Rs 4,15,000.”
In the present case, deceased was getting gross

monthly salary of Rs. 8,724/- at the time of his death and
after deductions his net carry home salary was Rs. 4,620/-.
Learned Tribunal has taken care of increase in future
salary and monthly income assessed as Rs.12,500/- is on
much higher side, but I am not disturbing this finding of
fact.
19.

Since, the deceased was aged 42 years at the time of

his death, the multiplier of 10 years adopted by the learned
Tribunal is quite reasonable, since it assessed the monthly
income of the deceased on much higher side. The learned
Tribunal has also rightly awarded Rs.8,700/- on account of
attendant charges and interest @ 12% per annum is quite
justified. Accordingly, no infirmity can be found with the
order of learned Tribunal. The present appeal is, therefore,
dismissed. No orders as to costs.
