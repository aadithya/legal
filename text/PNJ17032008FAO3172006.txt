PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

At the outset learned counsel for the parties state

that except for the date of the impugned orders, being order
dated 11.8.2006 passed by Ms.Shalinder Kaur, ADJ, Delhi
disposing of S.No.96/2005 “Union if India Vs. M/s. Hardeep
Engineers” challenged in FAO No.317/2006 and order dated
26.7.2006 passed by Mr.Babu Lal, ADJ, Delhi disposing of S.
No.129/2005 challenged in FAO No.319/2006 “Union of India
vs. M/s. Hardeep Engineers Pvt. Ltd.”, all other facts are
FAO No.317/06 & 319/06

page 1 of 6

identical and hence for the purposes of noting the facts
reference may be made to FAO No.317/2006.
2.

A short point arises for consideration in both the

appeals and hence both have been heard together and are
being disposed of by a common order.
3.

The

respondents

in

the

2

appeals

were

the

successful tenderers and managed to obtain acceptance of
their offer in respect of manufacture and supply of Elastic Rail
Clips to the Railway authorities.

Different quantities of item

pertaining to the same commodity were offered for supply by
the respondents in the 2 appeals. Both quoted the same rate
of Rs.23.4 per piece. Quantities being different and all other
terms of the offer being same, the offer of the respondents was
accepted

vide

purchase

order

issued

by

the

Railway

authorities. Inter alia the purchase order recorded as follows :(a)

Rate

:

Rs.23.4 per piece

(b)

Other terms and
conditions of the

:

Excise duty
(Inclusive in rates upto 16%
ad-valorem)

purchase order
4.

The case of the respondents is that the rate quoted

by them being Rs.23.4 was inclusive of excise duty upto 16%
ad-valorem, meaning thereby that if excise duty exceeded
16% they would be entitled to extra.

FAO No.317/06 & 319/06

The respondents

page 2 of 6

elaborated that their offer did not stipulate or state that the
price as ex-factory price with taxes as applicable to be paid
extra.

They claimed that the price offered by them was an

inclusive price but limited to impact of excise duty upto 16%.
5.

On the other hand the appellants relied upon clause

9.2 of the General Conditions of Contract as per which the
tenderers were supposed to quote at the ex-factory price with
taxes to be reimbursed by the Railway authorities on actuals.
6.

The effect of the dispute was that while releasing

payment the Railway authorities did not release the full
payment by alleging that the excise duty paid by the
respondents was @ 9.6%.
7.

The

learned

Arbitrator

held

in

favour

of

the

respondents on 2 counts. Firstly that there was a noting on the
file to the effect that full payment be released. Secondly by
noting the terms of the purchase order.
8.

With respect to the notings on the file, case of UOI is

that the notings were subject to the approval of the Competent
Authority and this vital fact has been ignored, in that, the
Competent Authority never gave the approval.
9.

Eschewing any reference to the notings on the file it

has to be noted that the manner in which the price is quoted
becomes relevant to determine the consideration forming the
FAO No.317/06 & 319/06

page 3 of 6

contract.

Where goods are offered at an ex-factory price,

stating that taxes as applicable on date of supply would be
payable extra, the consideration which has to flow from the
recipient of the goods is the ex-factory price + reimbursement
of the taxes paid by the supplier to the government.

But,

where the offer is a lump sum and offer i.e. the price quoted is
not split into a basic price and taxes separately shown,
irrespective of the taxes applicable, price has to be paid unless
the term of the acceptance records otherwise.
10.

A

unconditionally

contract

concludes

accepted.

The

when
offer

and

the

offer

is

unconditional

acceptance thus conclude the terms of the bargain.
11.

What better evidence would one have other than

the letter of acceptance issued by U.O.I i.e. the purchase order
which itself specifies the unit rate to be Rs.23.4 per piece with
a term that the aforesaid quoted price is inclusive of excise
duty upto 16% ad-valorem, meaning thereby, if the supplier
claimed excise duty beyond 16% then alone same had to be
paid additionally on proof of it being paid in excess. But if the
supplier did not ask for any differential extra payment on
account of excise duty, there arises no occasion to look into
the element of excise duty actually paid for the reason the
offer does not list the price at ex-factory price + taxes as
FAO No.317/06 & 319/06

page 4 of 6

applicable.
12.

This is the reasoning, though in brief, by the

Arbitrator. The Arbitrator nominated by the Railway Authorities
is the Deputy Chief Engineer/ Construction-II, Northern Railway,
a senior officer who understands what a price is.
13.

Before concluding I would regretfully note that the

Additional District Judges before whom objections were filed
have unfortunately not dealt with the objections in the manner
required to be looked into by law. I am noticing many such
orders being passed by learned ADJs, which is a matter of
concern.
14.

In the instant case, the learned Additional District

Judges have not dealt with the award in relation to how the
arbitrator has dealt with the purchase order and its language.
The learned Additional District Judges have not referred to the
award in the context of a contract concluding when an offer is
unconditionally accepted.
Judges have

The learned Additional District

not considered the issue with respect to the

lumpsum price vis-a-vis the ex-factory price, listing the taxes
applicable to be reimbursed extra.

The learned Additional

Distridt Judges have also not dealt with the issue with
reference to the lump sum price being limited to excise duty at
a

certain

percentage,

FAO No.317/06 & 319/06

reserving

right

to

claim

further
page 5 of 6

reimbursement if excise duty exceeds, as in the instant case,
16%.
15.

It is hoped and expected that objections to the

award are dealt with by specific reference to the case
projected by the parties.
16.

Rather than having remitted the matter to the

learned Additional District Judges, as noted hereinabove, I have
considered the merits of the objections.
17.

Finding none, the appeals are dismissed.

18.

The amount deposited pursuant to the award is

directed to be paid over to the respondents.
19.

Costs shall follow.
