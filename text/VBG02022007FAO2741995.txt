V.B. GUPTA, J.
Appellant has filed the present appeal against the
judgment and award dated 4th January, 1995 and order
dated 26th October, 1995 passed by Shri Charanjeet Jawa,
Judge,

Motor

Accident

Claims

Tribunal

(for

short

as

'Tribunal'), Delhi.
2.

Brief facts of the case are that the Respondents No. 1

to 4 filed a petition on account of death of one Ram Prakash
in a road accident involving bus No. DEP 8875 allegedly
driven rashly and negligently by the Respondent No. 5.
3.

Parties settled their case before the Lok Adalat on 10th

F.A.O. No. 274/1995

Page 2 of 7

December, 1994 for a sum of Rs. 2,80,000/- minus Rs.
25,000/-(already paid) in full and final settlement of the
Respondent's claim. The grievance of the Appellant is that
the learned Tribunal vide order dated 4th January, 1995
passed the award and modified it with a direction to pay the
award amount within 30 days failing which to pay interest at
the rate of 12 % per annum.

The direction to pay the

interest is contrary to the settlement between the parties at
the Lok Adalat and this direction was liable to be recalled.
Accordingly, the Appellant filed a review application for
reviewing the award dated 4th January, 1995 and to pass
the order to pay interest from the date of order till its
realisation, instead of from the date of filing of the petition.
The said review application was dismissed vide impugned
order dated 26th October, 1995 hence this appeal.
4.

On 31st January, 2007, none appeared on behalf of the

Respondents and as such arguments of the Appellant were
heard.
5.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

Appellant that the award dated 4th January, 1995 as well as
the order dated 26th October, 1995 passed on the review
F.A.O. No. 274/1995

application is contrary to law and without jurisdiction. The
learned Tribunal has no jurisdiction to award interest or
modify the terms of the settlement arrived at between the
parties before the Lok Adalat and make a new award for the
parties. The learned Tribunal erred in granting interest to
the Respondents No. 1 to 4 from the date of petition, when
the parties never agreed in the settlement and accepted the
lumpsum award.
6.

It is an admitted fact that the matter was settled in the

Lok Adalat on 10th December, 1994 and the award was
passed on 4th January, 1995 by the learned Tribunal. This
was a compromise award and it has been clearly stipulated
that “Respondents are directed to deposit the same within
30 days from today failing which interest @ 12% per annum
from the date of petition shall be chargeable”.
7.

It would not be out of place to mention that, as per

application for recording the compromise made before the
Lok Adalat, the Appellant has agreed to deposit the cheque
for the award amount in the court in the names of claimants
within one month from the date of passing of the award
failing which they are to be liable to pay interest @ 12% per
F.A.O. No. 274/1995

annum from the date of passing of the award.

The

Appellant, if had any grievance against the order dated 4th
January, 1995 passed by the Learned Tribunal, could have
challenged the same but admittedly the Appellant did not
challenge the compromise award and after deep slumber,
on 18th September, 1995, i.e. more than 8 months, after the
award has been passed, moved an application for review.
Admittedly, review application was hopelessly time barred
and as such it was rightly rejected by the Learned Tribunal.
8.

Section 171 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 deals with

the powers of Tribunal to award interest and it reads as
under :-

9.

171. Award of interest where any claim
is allowed – Where any Claims Tribunal allows
a claim for compensation made under this Act,
such Tribunal may direct that in addition to the
amount of compensation simple interest shall
also be paid at such rate and from such date
not earlier than the date of making the claim
as it may specify in this behalf.
As per this provision, the Tribunal is empowered to

award simple interest at such rate and from such date not
earlier than the date of making the claim as it may specify in
this behalf. No distinction has been made in case of award
based on compromise and award based on contested case.

As such, the order passed by the

Tribunal, awarding 12% interest from the date of petition
was in consonance with the provisions of Section 171 of the
Motor Vehicle Act.
10. As per the order dated 26th September, 1995 passed
by the Learned Tribunal while dismissing the review
application, it has been clearly stated that no amount of
principal award has yet been deposited by the Appellant and
had the Appellant been sincere,

It could have at least

deposited the awarded amount by this time when more than
9 months have passed.
11.

Under these circumstances, the present appeal is not

maintainable, firstly, the award dated 4th January, 1995 was
not challenged within the period of limitation and secondly,
the review application of the Appellant was rightly dismissed
by the Learned Tribunal being barred by limitation as well as
on merits.
12.

The present appeal is accordingly dismissed. No order

as to cost.
