1.
The plaintiff has filed this suit for permanent injunction,
infringement of copyright / trademark, passing off and rendition of accounts
etc. The defendants have been proceeded ex parte. The plaintiff has filed its
evidence in the shape of affidavits of PW1 to PW12. The plaintiff has also
filed documents which have been marked as exhibits PW1/1 to PW1/13. The
document at page 51 filed on behalf of the plaintiff as Annexure – VIII contains
the plaintiff's mark as well as the defendants' mark. The plaintiff's mark is
marked as exhibit-A. The defendants' mark is marked as exhibit-B. The

document at page 52 (Annexure – IX) which is a bill issued by the defendant
No.3 is marked as exhibit-C.

2.

The plaintiff is a registered partnership firm which was constituted

in 1925. Later, in 1981, due to expansion of the business, the plaintiff moved a
part of its business activities as well as its head office to Delhi. The plaintiff
firm is in the business of manufacturing and selling snuff through its licencees.
Shri Manohar Lal Wadhwa (PW-1) is one of the partners in the firm and he has
given his affidavit by way of evidence. The affidavit filed by PW1 reiterates
and substantiates the contents of the plaint. Exhibit PW1/1 is a certified copy
of the registration of the firm.

Exhibit PW1/2 is a certified copy of the

trademark registration of the mark SWAMI.

The registration number is

301792. It is registered in Class 34 and is effective from 28.12.1974 for the
sale of snuff in the States of Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar
Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Assam,
Sikkim, Bhutan and Nagaland. A certified copy of the copyright registration in
respect of the plaintiff's SWAMI Label has also been filed and the same is
exhibited as exhibit PW1/3. The label of the plaintiff is indicated in Exhibit-A
and that of the defendant Nos 1 and 2 is indicated in Exhibit B. The defendant
No.3 is the person through whom the goods of defendant Nos 1 and 2 are sold.
Since the defendants have chosen not to appear, the evidence filed on behalf of
the plaintiff has gone uncontroverted.

The main question that needs to be examined in the present case is

whether the defendants' mark (Exhibit B) is deceptively similar to the plaintiff's
mark (Exhibit A). The defendant Nos 1 and 2 were earlier manufacturing and
selling their products under the mark SWAMI. However, subsequently they
have changed it to SNUFF. A look at the two exhibits – Exhibit A and Exhibit
B would clearly indicate that Exhibit B is deceptively similar to Exhibit A. If
the two exhibits are looked at separately and not side by side then the similarity
and deceptiveness become even stronger.

Accordingly, I hold that the

defendants' label which is represented in Exhibit B is deceptively similar to the
plaintiff's label which is represented in Exhibit A. It may also be noted that the
colour scheme1 that has been employed by the defendants is virtually identical
to the colour scheme employed by the plaintiff. Taking into account the class
of purchasers who purchase snuff would also aggravate the situation further
inasmuch as they would not be so discerning as to the mark the minute
differences which have been introduced by the defendants in their label. An
examination of the entire case reveals that the defendants have copied the label
of the plaintiff entirely and have cleverly sought to introduce minor differences
which would not be noticed by the class of purchasers who normally purchase
such goods. Accordingly, in my view the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of
injunction.

With regard to the question of damages, the learned counsel for the

plaintiff submitted with reference to the affidavits of PW5, PW6, PW7, PW8
and PW9 that the plaintiff has suffered substantial losses on account of the
defendants' aforesaid activities. For example, it has been stated by PW5 that it
is carrying on the business of general merchants under the name and style of
M/s Mahesh Traders at Jabalpur. The said PW5 (Pavan Bashani) has stated that
his firm regularly purchases and sells SWAMI snuff of the plaintiff firm and for
the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 his purchases have been to the extent of Rs 1.48
crores, Rs 1.40 crores and Rs 1.51 crores. It has also been stated that SWAMI
snuff of the plaintiff is in great demand. It has been stated in paragraph 3 of the
affidavit that his sale of SWAMI snuff would have been much more than the
existing sale, had the infringing and / or deceptively similar trademark of the
defendants not been introduced. He has stated that this has caused a loss of sale
of Rs 10 lacs. Similar affidavits have been given by PW6, PW7, PW8 and
PW9. According to PW6, the loss is to the tune of Rs 15 lacs per annum.
PW7 says that the loss is to the extent of Rs 10 lacs and PW8 also says that the
loss is to the extent of Rs 10 lacs. PW9 has stated that the loss was to the extent
of Rs 10 lacs per annum.

5.

As against this, PW1 in his evidence affidavit has stated in

paragraph 15 that 80% of the plaintiff's sale pertains to the SWAMI trademark
CS(OS)1205/2006

Page No 4 of 7

label. The year-wise sale figures for 1995-96 right up to 2005-2006 have been
indicated in the said paragraph. The sale in 1995-96 for SWAMI Snuff was
approximately Rs 7.74 crores. It rose continuously till 1999-2000 when the sale
was approximately Rs 10.97 crores. For the year 2000-2001, the sales dropped
by approximately Rs 90 lacs as the sale figures were of Rs 10.06 crores. The
sale increased in 2001-2002 to Rs 11.31 crores and made a further drop of Rs
10 lacs in 2002-2003 when the sales were of approximately Rs. 11.21 crores.
Thereafter, the sales figure continuously increased to 2005-2006 when the sales
amounted to Rs 12.90 crores. From the aforesaid, it is apparent that although
there are statements of PW5 to PW9 indicating loss of sales on account of the
activities of the defendants, there is no evidence of a matched decrease in the
sales of the plaintiff. Insofar as the exact quantities are concerned, there is no
doubt that there has been drop in the sales to the extent of Rs.90 lacs in 20002001 and a drop of Rs 10 lacs in 2002-2003. There is no other evidence
available of there being a drop in sales. It may well be that had the activities of
the defendants not taken place, the increase in the sales might have been more
but there is no conclusive evidence as to the exact quantum of the loss that has
been caused to the plaintiff. There is ample evidence however of the fact that
loss had been caused to the plaintiff by the defendants. At the time of the filing
of the suit, the plaintiff had estimated the damage caused by the defendants'
activities to be Rs 20,00,100/-. In paragraph 36 of the plaint, it is stated that the

CS(OS)1205/2006

Page No 5 of 7

plaintiff estimates that such amount would be found due to the plaintiff when
accounts are rendered by the defendants.

6.

Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and the

evidence that is on record, I do feel that the quantum of loss that has been
occasioned by the defendants' infringing activities would be greater than what
was initially estimated by the plaintiff. However, it would also not be to the
extent that the plaintiff now indicates in the affidavits filed on its behalf. In my
view, it could be reasonably estimated to have lost to the extent of Rs 25 lakhs
on account of the defendants' activities. But the matter does not rest here. As
observed in The Himalaya Drug Company v. Sumit: 126 (2006) DLT 23,
apart from compensatory damages, in cases of infringement of trade marks,
copyrights, etc., courts should not only grant compensatory damages but award
punitive damages also with a view to discourage and dishearten law breakers
who indulge in violations with impunity out of lust for money so that they
realise that in case they are caught, they would be liable not only to reimburse
the aggrieved party but would be liable to pay punitive damages also, which
may spell financial disaster for them. These observations were made on the
basis of certain other decisions, namely, Time Incorporated v. Lokesh
Srivastava and Another: 116 (2005) DLT 599 and Mathias v. Accor Economy
Lodging reported in 347 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2003). In the case of Himalaya
Drug Company (supra), punitive damages, equivalent to compensatory
CS(OS)1205/2006

damages were awarded. Accordingly, adopting the same principle, the plaintiff
would be entitled to an additional sum of Rs 25 lakhs from the defendants by
way of punitive damages.

7.

The suit is decreed in terms of prayers (a), (b), (c) and (d) as

contained in paragraph 37 of the plaint. In lieu of the prayers of rendition of
accounts as contained in prayer (e), the plaintiff is entitled to a decree for Rs 25
lakhs by way of compensatory damages as well as a decree in the sum of Rs 25
lakhs on account of punitive / exemplary damages in the plaintiff's favour and
against the defendants. The plaintiff is also entitled to costs. The damages
awarded shall be payable by the defendants jointly and severally and shall carry
interest @ 9% per annum from the date of decree till the date of payment. The
suit stands decreed accordingly. Before the formal decree is drawn up, the
balance court fee shall be paid by the plaintiff.
