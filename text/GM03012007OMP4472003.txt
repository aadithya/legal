By this judgment, I propose to dispose of the present

petition which has been filed by the petitioner under Section 34 of
the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking setting aside of an
award dated 16th September, 2003 purportedly passed by the sole
arbitrator Shri Suryakant Sasan, ADR Arbitral Tribunal, ADR
House, 2/3 West Patel Nagar, Main Road, New Delhi-110008.

Notice of the filing of the present petition was served on

O.M.P. No. 447/2003

page 1 of 12

both the respondents. The respondent no. 2 entered appearance
through counsel and even filed a reply. However, none appeared
to support the reply before this court on the several dates on which
the matter was listed from 10th July, 2006. On 7th November,
2006, this court deferred hearing and orders in the interest of
justice to enable appearance on behalf of the respondents. As
none appeared on behalf of the respondents on 12th of December,
2006, the arguments were heard in the matter and the judgment
reserved.
3.

Facts giving rise to the present petition to the extent as

are necessary for adjudication of the present case are briefly
noticed hereinafter.
4.

On the 12th of April, 1972, the Food Corporation of India,

the petitioner herein entered into an agreement with M/s
Jalpaiguri Trading Corporation Ltd. for the delivery of resultant
rice produced out of the paddy which was given by the petitioner
to the miller.

It would be useful to consider the arbitration

agreement between the parties which was contained in clause 33
of the agreement dated 12th April, 1972 and reads thus:“33. All disputes and differences arising out of or
in any way touching or concerning this agreement
whatsoever (except as to any matter the decision
O.M.P. No. 447/2003

page 2 of 12

of which is expressly provided for in the
agreement) shall be referred to the sole
arbitration of any person appointed by the
Managing Director of Food Corporation of India.
It will be no objection to any such appointment
that the person appointed is or was an employee
of the Corporation, that he had to deal with the
matters to which the agreement relates and that
in course of his duties as such employee of the
corporation he had expressed views on all or any
of the matters in dispute or difference. The award
of such Arbitrator shall be final and binding on
the parties to this agreement. It is a term of this
agreement that in the event of such arbitrator to
whom the matter is originally referred being
transferred or vacating his office being unable to
act for any reason the Managing Director of the
Food Corporation of India at the time of such
transfer, vacation of office or inability to act, shall
appoint another person to act as arbitrator. Such
person shall be entitled to proceed with the
reference from the stage at which his predecessor
left it. It is also a term of this agreement that no
person other than a person appointed as aforesaid
should act arbitrator and if for any reason that is
not possible the matter is not to be referred to
arbitration at all.
Provided further that any demand for
arbitration in respect of claim(s) from the
agent(s) under the agreement, shall be in writing
and made with in one year of the date of
termination or completion (expiry of the period)
of the agreement and where such demand is not
made within that period claim(s) of the agent
shall be deemed to have been waived and
absolutely barred and corporation shall be
discharged and released of all liabilities under the
agreement in respect of these claims.
Subject as aforesaid, the Arbitration
Act, 1940 shall apply to the arbitration
proceedings under this clause. Work under the
O.M.P. No. 447/2003

agreement shall if reasonably possible continue
during the arbitration proceedings and no
payment due to or payable by the corporation
shall be withheld on account of such
proceedings.”
It appears that by a letter dated 9th December, 1974, the

petitioner terminated the agreement with M/s Jalpaiguri Trading
Corporation Ltd. for the reason that it had failed to deliver the
goods in terms of the contract.

M/s Jalpaiguri Trading

Corporation Ltd. accepted this termination and did not take any
steps in the matter for almost 20 years.

The petitioner has

contended that it received a letter dated 5th October, 1994 from
M/s Jalpaiguri Trading Corporation Ltd. informing the petitioner
that the M/s Jalpaiguri Trading Corporation Ltd. had appointed
one Shri D.S. Deo, an Advocate of the Supreme Court of India to
act as an arbitrator regarding 'overall settlement of the disputes
between Food Corporation of India and M/s Jalpaiguri Trading
Corporation Ltd.' Shri D.S. Deo who was appointed as a sole
arbitrator by M/s Jalpaiguri Trading Corporation Ltd. passed an
ex-parte award dated 10th December, 1994 in favour of M/s
Jalpaiguri

Trading

Corporation

Ltd.

for

a

sum

of

Rs.

1,39,22,097.93/-. M/s Jalpaiguri Trading Corporation Ltd. filed
this award before the court of Civil Judge (Senior Division),

O.M.P. No. 447/2003

page 4 of 12

Sealdah, West Bengal for making the same as rule of the award.
6.

In

these

proceedings,

M/s

Jalpaiguri

Trading

Corporation Ltd. filed an application under Order 22 Rule 10 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 praying for permission to allow
one Shri Arun Kumar Sinha to proceed with the matter on the
ground that by a declaration dated 29th January, 1996, the award
stood assigned in interest to Shri Raj Kumar Sinha.

This

application was dismissed by the learned Civil Judge, Sealdah by
an order passed on 1st August, 1997.
M/s Jalpaiguri Trading Corporation Ltd. assailed the
order of learned Civil Judge before the High Court of Judicature at
Calcutta by way of an appeal no. 3258/1997. This appeal was
rejected by the High Court in limini.
7.

So far as the award dated 10th December, 1994 was

concerned, Food Corporation of India, the petitioner herein filed
objections thereto which were accepted by the learned Civil Judge.
By a detailed judgment dated 7th June, 2001, the learned Civil
Judge held that the appointment of the arbitrator was not based
on any agreement between the parties and that even the
arbitration proceedings were conducted without service of notice
to the present petitioner. After recording detailed findings, the
O.M.P. No. 447/2003

page 5 of 12

court accepted the objections filed by the Food Corporation of
India and held that the award was hit by the mischief of Section 30
(c) of the Arbitration Act, 1940 and consequently set aside the
same.
M/s

Jalpaiguri

Trading

Corporation

Ltd.

had

vehemently contested the objections before the court of learned
Civil Judge. The order dated 7th June, 2001 has attained finality
inasmuch as the same was not assailed by M/s Jalpaiguri Trading
Corporation Ltd. before any forum.
8.

The petitioner points out that it has been constrained to

move this court in view of a communication dated 28 th July, 2003
received by its Chairman from the Freedom Charities Fund,
claiming to be a charitable trust established by M/s Jalpaiguri
Trading Corporation Ltd. By this communication, the Freedom
Charities Fund arrayed as respondent no. 2 herein notified the
petitioner that the award dated 10th December, 1994 was
executable under the provisions of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Act, 1996 and that the award money constitutes the trust property
of the respondent no. 2. This communication contained a demand
that the petitioner shall make payment of dues in terms of the
award dated 10th December, 1994 by 15th of August, 2003 or to
O.M.P. No. 447/2003

page 6 of 12

refer disputes to the ADR Arbitral Tribunal of the Government of
India failing which the respondent no. 2 would treat the same as a
reference by ADR Arbitration at its instance. The petitioner has
submitted that there was no privity of contract with the
respondent no. 2 and no arbitration agreement with it. It has been
further contended that the award dated 10th December, 1994 stood
set aside by the court of competent jurisdiction by a judgment
dated 7th June, 2001 and this communication wrongly mentioned
the same as mutual agreement.
9.

There was no communication whatsoever either from

the respondent no. 1 or from any arbitrator thereafter. The
petitioner has submitted that it received only a photocopy of a
document purporting to be an ex-parte award dated 16th
September, 2003 passed by Shri S.K. Sasan, respondent no. 1
herein in favour of respondent no. 2. This award purportedly was
passed under the provisions of Arbitration & Conciliation Act,
1996 and was passed at New Delhi. This award has been assailed
by way of the present petition under Section 34 of the Statute of
1996 inter alia on the ground that the same was only without
jurisdiction, was perverse and passed in violation of law.
10.

I have heard Mr. Yashobant Das, learned senior counsel

O.M.P. No. 447/2003

page 7 of 12

for the petitioner who has carefully drawn my attention to the
entire record. I find that the award dated 10th December, 1994 was
set aside by the court of the learned Civil Judge, Sealdah by the
judgment dated 7th June, 2001.

There is no dispute to the

opposition that only the benefit under an award would be
transferrable with the consent of the other side and that
obligations cannot be assigned. In the instant case, by an order
dated 1st August, 1997, the assignment in interest of the award in
favour of Shri Raj Kumar Sinha of the Freedom Charities Fund
stood rejected by the Civil Judge. This order dated 1 st August, 1997
was sustained by the High Court at Calcutta when it dismissed the
appeal no. 3258/1997 filed by M/s Jalpaiguri Trading Corporation
Ltd. which was the assigner.
11.

There is no dispute that there is no arbitration

agreement between the petitioner FCI and the respondent no. 2
herein. The award dated 10th December, 1994 was passed under
the provisions of Arbitration Act, 1940. The same stood set aside
by the order dated 7th June, 2001 passed by the learned Civil
Judge, Sealdah.

The only remedy available to M/s Jalpaiguri

Trading Corporation Ltd. was to assail such order by way of an
appeal under Section 39 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. No such
O.M.P. No. 447/2003

page 8 of 12

remedy was invoked by M/s Jalpaiguri Trading Corporation Ltd.
12.

Perusal of the award dated 16th September, 2003 shows

that the respondent no. 1, the sole arbitrator has drawn
jurisdiction on a letter dated 28th July, 2003 addressed by the
Freedom Charities Fund to the Food Corporation of India. This
unilateral communication noticed hereinabove does not amount to
or create any arbitration agreement between the parties which
would have given jurisdiction to the respondent no. 1.
Furthermore, the claimed successor in interest of the respondent
no. 2 namely M/s Jalpaiguri Trading Corporation Ltd. had taken
recourse to arbitration under the Arbitration Act, 1940 which
proceedings stood culminated in the order dated 7th June, 2001
setting aside the award dated 10th December, 1994 passed in its
favour. Therefore, so far as arbitration is concerned, the award
dated 10th December, 1994 was of no legal consequences or effect.
13.

I find that Shri S.K. Sasan, respondent no. 1 herein has

not only assumed jurisdiction which did not exist but has
proceeded to act under the provisions of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996. There is no record of any notice or any
proceedings being served on the petitioner hereinabove.
Furthermore, the respondent no. 1 has held that the
O.M.P. No. 447/2003

page 9 of 12

award dated 10th December, 1994 was executable under the
provisions of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and that the
parties had agreed to such executability. The award dated 16th
September, 2003 further holds that the Freedom Charities Fund is
the assignee in interest and that this trust acting through its sole
trustee Shri Raj Kumar Sinha was at liberty to execute the award
dated 10th December, 1994 to the High Court of Delhi where the
award was being filed by the sole arbitrator.
14.

This award has been passed in patent violation of the

applicable principles of law. The same also ignores the orders and
judgment which were binding in the matter. As noticed above, by
the order dated 1st August, 1997, the court of competent
jurisdiction had already held that the award or the interest in the
award was not assignable which order was final and binding on all
parties including the respondent no. 2.

The objections of the

petitioner to the award dated 10th December, 1994 had also been
accepted by the learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), Sealdah and
by the judgment dated 7th June, 2001, the award dated 10th
December, 1994 stood set aside.

As noticed above, the only

remedy available to the beneficiaries under this award was by way
of an appeal under Section 39 of the Arbitration Act, 1940.
O.M.P. No. 447/2003

page 10 of 12

15.

The methodology adopted by M/s Jalpaiguri Trading

Corporation Ltd. and the respondent no. 2 which is stated to be a
trust of M/s Jalpaiguri Trading Corporation Ltd. to compel the
petitioner to comply with the amount awarded by the award dated
10th December, 1994 is totally misconceived and illegal. Certainly,
the finding by the respondent no. 1 to the effect that the award
dated 10th December, 1994 is executable under the provisions of
the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 has no basis in law. The
award passed under the Arbitration Act, 1940 has to follow the
provisions of the same statute. It is not open to a party to take
recourse to the provisions of Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
so as to enforce an award passed under the 1940 enactment which
stood set aside thereunder.
16.

Shri Raj Kumar Sinha was not an applicant in the

application filed under Order 22 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 in the proceedings before the learned Civil Judge,
(Senior Division), Sealdah, was rejected on 1st of August, 1997.
Certainly, such a person cannot seek the benefit of the award dated
10th December, 1994 for this reason as well.
17.

In the light of the above discussion, I have no hesitation

in holding that the award dated 16th September, 2003 is without
O.M.P. No. 447/2003

page 11 of 12

authority of law and contrary to the specific statutory provisions
and is hence liable to be set aside under the provisions of Section
34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996.
I also find that there is no arbitration agreement
between the petitioner and the respondent no. 2. The letter dated
28th July, 2003 does not amount to an arbitration agreement
between the parties and that the proceedings conducted by the
respondent no. 1 are without authority of law, without jurisdiction
and not sustainable.
Accordingly, the present petition is allowed. The award
dated 16th September, 2003 is hereby set aside and quashed.
The petitioner shall be entitled to the costs of the
present petition which are quantified at Rs. 25,000/-.
