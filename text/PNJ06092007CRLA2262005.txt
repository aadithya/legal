PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
Afore-noted

appeals

arise

out

of

a

common

judgment of conviction dated 21.2.2005 in Sessions Case
No.139/2001.
2.

Thus, the 4 appeals have been taken up together for

hearing.
3.

At the outset, I may note that in Crl.Appeal

No.240/2005 which was listed on 29.8.2007 learned counsel for
the appellant was directed to send communications to learned
counsel for the other appellants informing them that all appeals

would be listed for final hearing on 6.9.2007 i.e. today.
4.

Learned counsel for the appellant in Crl.Appeal

No.240/2005 has produced 3 receipts issued by Blaze Flash
Couriers Ltd. which evidence that learned counsel, Shri Vikas
Pahwa, had intimated Shri Sachin Chopra, Shri Randhir Jain as
also Shri Vijender Sharma, counsel for appellants in the other 3
appeals that matter would be listed for hearing today. Mr.Vikas
Pahwa states that his colleague Mr.Abhinit Das has personally
spoken to Mr.Vijender Sharma, counsel for appellant Ashok
Kumar and had duly informed him that Crl.Appeal No.265/2005
would be listed today. Learned counsel states that Mr.Vijender
Sharma, Advocate for accused Ashok Kumar informed the
counsel i.e. Abhinit Das that he was never the counsel for
Ashok Kumar.
5.

I note that Crl.Appeal No.265/2005 has been filed by

Vijender Sharma, Advocate.
6.

Since

Mr.Vikash

Pahwa

is

appearing

for

the

appellant of Crl.Appeal No.240/2005 and Mr.Randhir Jain,
Advocate

is

appearing

for

the

appellants

in

Crl.Appeal

No.226/2005 I have requested learned counsel to act as amicus
for appellant Ashok Kumar.

Since learned counsel have

prepared the brief they have agreed to assist the Court in
Crl.Appeal No.265/2005 as well.

7.

Criminal

investigation

commenced

when

PW-3

Raghunath lodged a complaint which resulted in registration of
FIR No.410/1999 PS Mehrauli informing that in the intervening
night of 17.6.1999 and 18.6.1999 he was proceeding from
Village Manger in Haryana to his house in Vasant Kunj in his
maruti Esteem car bearing No.DL-3CV-9810. At around 12.30
in the night he crossed Jaunapur village on main Delhi-Gurgaon
road.

He wanted to ease himself.

Stopping the car by the

roadside he indulged in the usual habit of urinating on the road.
Not only was he relieved of the pressure on his bladder but was
even relieved of his car, his gold ring, his gold chain, his mobile
telephone, his briefcase, his watch and the money he was
carrying in his wallet. He stated that 5 boys came in maruti car
bearing No.DL-3CB-5254 and so relieved him. He stated that
leaving behind the maruti car, his car was carjacked by said
persons.

FIR No. 410/99 P.S. Mehrauli, Ex. PW1/A was

registered at 3.40 A.M. pursuant to D.D.No. 76 B recorded at
1.55 A.M.
8.

PW-2, K.A.Singh visited the scene of the crime on

18.6.1999 and lifted chance finger prints from the maruti car.
They later on matched with the finger prints of Ashok.

The

maruti car was seized at the site of the crime vide seizure
memo Ex.PW-7/B.

9.
car

2 days thereafter information was received that the
of

PW-3

had

met

with

an

accident

near

Dadri.

Accompanied by PW-3, the investigating officer reached Dadri.
The car was taken into custody.
10.

Another 2 days thereafter, Jagbir and Ajit were

arrested by the police.

Statedly, Ajit made a disclosure

statement at the first instance followed by a disclosure
statement made by Jagbir. The two statedly not only confessed
to the carjack and the dacoity, implicating besides self,
Ravinder Kumar @ Ravi, Ashvir, Ashok Kumar and Manoj.
Stately, Ajit Singh further disclosed to the police that the booty
was shared as follows:(1)

....

Briefcase.

(2)

Ashvir

....

Gold ring.

(3)

Jagbir

....

Watch

(4)

Ashok

....

Cash (Rs.1,200/-)

(5)

Manoj

....

Gold Chain.

(6)
11.

Ravinder

Ajit

....

Mobile.

Accompanied by Head Constable Satyawan, PW-6

recoveries as per disclosure statement of Ajit was statedly
made from the persons named by Ajit in his disclosure
statement save and except no recovery being effected from
Ashok Kumar.

The prosecution alleges that he spent the

money which was shared by him as a part of the booty.
12.

Challan was filed. Charges were framed against the

accused.

They were charged for offences under Section

398/395/412 IPC.
13.

PW-6 proved recovery memos PW-6/M, PW-6/J, PW-

6/F, PW-6/H, PW-6/E pertaining to the stated recovery of the
brief case, gold ring, watch, gold chain and mobile telephone
from

accused

Ravinder,

Ashvir,

Jagbir,

Manoj

and

Ajit

respectively.
14.

The complainant as also the victim, Raghunath who

deposed as PW-3 deposed at the trial that he was carjacked as
disclosed by him in the FIR. That before carjacking his car he
was relieved of his brief case, gold ring, watch, money, gold
chain and mobile telephone but stated that when he received a
telephone call from the police that his car had been involved in
an accident at Dadri and he accompanied the police to Dadri he
identified his vehicle at the Dadri Police Station he saw that his
brief case along with his documents was in the car. He stated
that brief case was thereafter handed over to him. PW-3 failed
to identify any accused at the trial.
15.

In that view of the matter, learned Trial Judge has

held that recovery of the briefcase against Ravinder has fallen.
As against the other accused, learned Trial Judge has opined

that since recoveries were effected pursuant to the disclosure
statement made by Ajit and Jagbir the recovery lends
assurance and credibility to the disclosure made by co-accused
Ajit and Jagbir, Section 27 of the Evidence Act was attracted.
Thus, learned Trial Judge has proceeded to convict all the
accused persons save and except Ravinder.
16.

PW-2, K.N.Singh, finger print expert from the Finger

Print Burearu, Malviya Nagar proved that he had examined the
maruti car bearing No.DL-3CB-5254 and had lifted finger prints
Q-1, Q-2, Q-3 and Q-4. That the same tallied with the finger
prints of Ashok as per his report PW-2/A.
17.

Pertaining to the maruti car, it would be relevant to

note that not only were particulars thereof disclosed in the FIR
by PW-3, the car was recovered from the spot where
complainant had been victimized vide seizure memo Ex.PW17/B. Seizure being duly proved by PW-7 Sub-Inspector Vijay
Kumar.
18.

Thus, vis-a-vis Ashok Kumar incriminating evidence

surfaced in the form of his finger prints on the maruti car which
I note was itself a stolen car. I further note that Ashok Kumar
has failed to give any satisfactory explanation when his
statement was recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. as to under
what circumstances his finger prints came on the maruti car.

19.
conviction

Pertaining to accused Ashok Kumar to sustain his
it

would

be

sufficient

for

me

to

note

that

incriminating evidence has surfaced in the form of the PW-3,
the victim, disclosing the number of the white maruti car in
which accused persons came before he was waylaid. Recovery
of the car from the spot where complainant was waylaid.
Finger prints of Ashok Kumar in the maruti car. Thus, there is
no merits in Crl.Appeal No.265/2005 filed by Ashok Kumar. The
same is dismissed.
20.

Pertaining to the other accused, it would be relevant

to note that recovery of briefcase against Ravinder was
doubted by the learned Trial Judge on account of testimony of
the complainant PW-3 who stated that his briefcase was in his
car when he identified his car at PS Dadri, 2 days after the
incident.

Obviously, recovery memo Ex.PW-6/M is a doubtful

recovery memo.
21.

It is no doubt true that a statement of a co-accused

which results in a discovery of a fact within the ambit of Section
27 of the Evidence Act is admissible in evidence not only
against the maker of the statement but even against the coaccused but as held by the Full Bench of the Madras High Court
in the decision reported as ILR (1937) Madras 695 In Re:
Athappa Goundan followed by a learned Single Judge of the

Nagpur High Court in the decision reported as AIR 1947 Nagpur
57 Narayan Dinba vs. Emperor such a disclosure statement is a
weak evidence. Its evidenciary value is very low.
22.

Suffice would it be to note that a statement made by

an accused when in custody of a police officer is inadmissible
evidence save and except when the same results in the
discovery of a fact not within the knowledge of the police. This
limited admissibility to such a statement is under Section 27 of
the Evidence Act. The reason is this. Law views with a taint a
statement purportedly made by an accused when in custody of
a police officer. But when discovery of a fact emanates, said
discovery of a fact lends some credibility or assurance of the
truthfulness of the disclosure statement made and as recorded
by the police. Thus, rule of prudence is followed by the Courts
to look for either intrinsic strength in the disclosure statement
or corroboration by independent evidence.
23.

In the instant case admittedly there is no other

corroborative evidence.
24.

On the intrinsic strength of the disclosure statement

made by Ajit and Jagbir pursuant whereto recoveries have been
effected, as noted herein above, pertaining to the briefcase,
disclosure statement and recovery has been found to be
tainted. Thus, there is intrinsic weakness of strength/credibility

in the purported disclosure statement of Ajit.
25.

The evidence of the prosecution becomes further

weak in view of the testimony of PW-3 i.e. the victim who
neither gave the EMIE number of the mobile telephone nor
deposed with confidence that the stated mobile telephone was
his.

Even pertaining to the gold chain and the gold ring he

stated in his examination-in-chief that neither articles of
jewellery had any distinctive mark and if mixed up with similar
objects it would not be possible for him to identify either the
ring or the watch. Further he stated in his testimony, to quote:
“I was called at the police station after about 4/5 days. They
showed me my gold chain, my ring and my mobile phone.”
26.

I note that as per seizure memo's Ex. PW-6/J, Ex.

PW-6/H and Ex.PW-6/E pertaining to the gold chain, ring and
mobile phone the three items were sealed in different parcels
on which seal of V.K. was affixed.

Thus testimony of PW-3

discredits the seizure of said 3 items.
27.

I thus hold that evidence on record is too weak and

tenuous vis-a-vis Ashvir, Jagbir, Manoj and Ajit.
28.

Standard of proof required at a criminal trial is proof

beyond reasonable doubt. A standard of proof attained by the
prosecution which falls short of the said standard is insufficient
to sustain a conviction

29.

Crl. Appeal Nos.226/2005, 240/2005 and 279/2005

are accordingly allowed. The conviction and sentence imposed
upon Ashvir, Jagbir, Manoj and Ajit is hereby quashed.
30.

If not detained or required in judicial custody in any

other offence, said 4 persons are directed to be set free
forthwith.
31.

Ashok

Kumar

i.e.

Crl.Appeal

No.265/2005 is dismissed.
32.

LCR be returned.
