JUDGMENT
Per Thakur, J(oral)
1.

This appeal arises out of an order passed by the Court of Additional

District Judge, Delhi enhancing the compensation payable to the
appellant/land owner from Rs.13000/- per bigha awarded by the Collector
Land Acquisition to Rs.36400/- per bigha. Dissatisfied with the said
enhancement the appellant has appealed to this Court for further
enhancement.
2.

Learned counsel for the appellant is not available. A reading of the

orders on the file would also show that on most dates of hearings learned

counsel for the appellant had not appeared. When the matter came up on
17th March, 2008, Ms. Meena Chaudhary was reported unwell. Ms.
Meena Chaudhary was not, however, present even on 02nd April, 2008 to
which date the case was adjourned. She is absent today also.
3.

Mr. Ray, proxy counsel for Mr. Poddar, however, points out that

this appeal can be allowed in part as the issue raised by the appellant is
covered by a judgment of this Court in Sita Ram vs. Union of India:
79(1999) Delhi Law Times 10 (DB). The land which form the subject
matter of the said case was also, according to Mr. Ray, situated in village
Amberhai and had been acquired by the same notification and
declaration under Section 6 of Land Acquisition Act. This Court had by
the said decision enhanced the compensation payable to the land owners
to Rs.47224/- per bigha with statutory benefits. Mr. Ray submits that this
appeal can be allowed on the terms set out in Sita Ram vs. Union of India
(Supra) and the appellant held entitled to the enhanced compensation of
Rs.47224/- per bigha with proportionate statutory benefits.
4.

We see no reason to reject that submission. Although, on account of

the absence of the learned counsel of the appellant this appeal ought to
have been dismissed for non-prosecution, but keeping in view the
decision of this Court in Sita Ramâ€™s case supra we are inclined to allow
this appeal for the reasons stated in the said decision and enhance the
amount of compensation payable to the appellant to Rs.47224/- per bigha
with proportionate statutory benefits including additional market value in
terms of Section 23(1A) and solatium in terms of 23(2) of the Act.

5.

We accordingly allow this appeal and in modification of the order

passed by the Reference Court, direct that the appellant land owner shall
be entitled to compensation @Rs.47224/- per bigha with proportionate
statutory benefits like additional market value and solatium. The
appellant shall also be entitled to interest on the amount of compensation
including the additional market value and solatium in terms of decision of
the Supreme Court in Sunder vs. Union of India; 2001(60) DRJ 627. The
appellants shall also be entitled to proportionate cost.
