JUDGMENT
1.

The Petitioner has assailed, by means of this Writ Petition

under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the decision of the
Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT)
dated

19.7.2006

WP(C) No.976/2007

whereby

the

following

Order

of

the
1 of 7

Commissioner was upheld:
i) I order confiscation of 3979 pairs of shoes valued at
Rs.32,56,344 and biris, gutka and zarda valued at
Rs.3,52,700/- attempted to be exported by M/s. I.J.
Exim under Section 119 and 113(i) of the Customs
Act respectively and I order a fine in lieu of
confiscation under Section 125 of the Customs Act
Rs.2.50 lakh and Rs.50,000/- respectively.
ii) I order denial of drawback of Rs.47,506/- on ladies
leather boots found short.
iii)I also impose a penalty of Rs.1,00,000/- on Mr.
Inderjeet Singh proprietor of M/s. I.J. Exim under
Section 114 of the Customs Act.
iv) I order denial of drawback of Rs.1650/- on shoes
found short in respect of M/s. Vakil Exports.

2.

It should be recalled that Section 130, as it stood before its

repeal by the National Tax Tribunal Act, 2005, permitted an
Appeal to the High Court. That Appeal was not of a general
nature but was restricted to the adjudication or determination of
a substantial question of law. A Writ Petition has been filed
before us and learned counsel for the petitioner has been unable
to disclose what substantial question of law is involved in these
proceedings. In fact, his arguments are purely in the nature of a
regular appeal. The repealed provisions also mandated that the

WP(C) No.976/2007

2 of 7

High Court must decide the question of law so formulated and
deliver such judgment thereon containing the grounds on which
such decision is founded.

3.

The High Court of Madras has passed interim Orders

in WP(C) No.1290-91/2006 titled Madras Bar Association -vs-

Union of India dated 20.01.2006 staying the operation of the
National Tax Appellate Tribunal Act, 2005 with the result
that National Tax Appellate Tribunal has not been constituted.
These interim Orders have been assailed before the Supreme
Court which has not considered it necessary or expedient to stay
the operation of the impugned Orders of the High Court of
Madras. It is in these circumstances that a number of writ
petitions

have

been

filed

in

this Court and have been

permitted to be withdrawn to enable the filing of Appeals under
erstwhile/repealed Section 130 of the Customs Act, 1962. Prima
facie, therefore, only an Appeal on a substantial question of
law alone can at best be available at the present

stage.

WP(C) No.12203/2006 was in these circumstances permitted
to be withdrawn with liberty granted to file an Appeal. Be
that as it may, in order to conclude the matter we have heard
this writ petition on merits.

Succinctly stated, the facts of the case are that the

Petitioner had attempted to export a consignment of 4600 pairs of
ladies boots stated to be packed in 250 cartons. A Declaration to
this effect had been made. On examination of the consignment by
the Respondents it was discovered that boots were packed only in
199 cartons and there was a substantial shortfall in the total
number of boots sought to be exported. In the remaining 31
cartons biris, gutka and zarda had been packed. There was no
mention of biris, gutka and zarda in the Declaration. These events
have resulted in the impugned Order being passed by the
Commissioner of Customs.

5.

It has been contended by Mr. Bagai, learned counsel for the

Petitioner, that the Petitioner had engaged M/s. Karam Freight
Movers,

who

have

been

duly

licensed

by

the

Customs

Department. M/s. Karam Freight Movers were thus duty-bound
to make a proper Declaration and, therefore, the Petitioner could
not be held culpable or responsible in this regard. We cannot
accept this argument for the simple reason that M/s. Karam
Freight Movers acts as the Agent of the Petitioner. It also appears
that the packaging was not done by M/s. Karam Freight Movers.
The Petitioner does not allege that M/s. Karam Freight Movers
WP(C) No.976/2007

4 of 7

have packed the biris, gutka and zarda in some of the cartons
without their authorisation and knowledge. Therefore, it is the
Petitioner who must remain responsible for the mis-declaration.

6.

It has next been contended that in fact there is no mis-

declaration and that in this context Section 113(i) is not attracted
because this argument has no substance since this Section
specifically speaks of exported goods which do not correspond in
respect of value or in material particular. It has been emphasised
that the Checklist for export mentions samples (NFEI). In our
view, the presence of biris, gutka and zarda should have been
clearly spelt-out and this should not have been vaguely stated to
be in the nature of samples. Section 113(i) is attracted as appears
to be the case before us.

7.

It has also been contended that the Respondents were

unduly

concerned with customs duties payable in Australia.

Even if this is so, it would not detract from the attraction of
Section 113(i). International Protocols now make it obligatory on
Customs Department to inform each other of attempts to violate
the law.

There was no justification

for

exercise

of

extraordinary powers to strike down such action between
WP(C) No.976/2007

5 of 7

Customs Department of India on the one hand and the foreign
countries, such as Australia, on the other.

8.

It has next been contended that the Order-in-Original

passed by the Commissioner finds M/s. Karam Freight Movers
guilty of mis-declaration but yet it has not imposed any penalty on
it. In the penultimate paragraph of the Order-in-Original it has
been stated - “From the facts and circumstances of the case, I do
not find any evidence against Shri Vijay Singh Yadav employee of
M/s. Karam Freight Movers, and therefore do not impose any
penalty on him”. This is no justification for us to exercise
extraordinary powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India even if M/s. Karam Freight Movers were, in fact, guilty of
willful mis-declaration.

9.

It has further been contended that the Petitioner has

been given treatment adverse to that accorded to M/s. Vakil
Exports. That was a case where 25 pairs of shoes were
found short in 10 cartons without any other commodities
being sought to be clandestinely exported under cover of the
purported export of shoes.

Furthermore, it is not logical to

argue that an order or decision should be set aside only for
WP(C) No.976/2007

6 of 7

the reason that a contrary decision has been taken in the case of
another party.

10.

We

find

no

merit

in

the

Petition.

Dismissed.

CM

Nos.1716/2007 and 3483/2007 are also dismissed.
