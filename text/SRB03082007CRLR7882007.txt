Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat:
1.

The Present revision petition is directed against the order of discharge

dated 22.03.2002 made the Ld. Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ). The petitioner
was complainant in the proceedings filed before the Metropolitan Magistrate.
2.

The brief facts necessary to decide this present petition are as follows. The

CRL.REV.P.788/2002 & CRMA 12512/2005

Petitioner and the accused had a scuffle relating to a shop property which resulted
in exchange of words. The petitioner alleged that the accused snatched Rs. 5,000/from him. Therefore, on the same day i.e. 26.04.1991 he approached the police
(hereafter referred as the respondents) to register a complaint, as the accused
persons had beaten him up. The respondents refused to register the complaint. The
respondent Sh. Mahender Singh, the then SHO allegedly started threatening the
petitioner and said “KI SALE KE 500 LATHI MAROONGA AGAR DOBARA
THANE AYA TO”. It was alleged that ASI Ishwar Singh slapped the petitioner
and said that if he ever visited the police station again he would be implicated in a
false criminal case.
3.

The Petitioner approached the Deputy Commissioner of Police, who

directed him to the ACP and a FIR was lodged on 29.4.1991; however, allegedly
no action was taken in the matter. It is alleged that on 21.5.1991 the Respondents
threatened the petitioner to settle the matter with the accused for a sum of Rs.
55,000/-. The petitioner was given Rs. 50,000/- and forcibly made to write that he
had received a sum of Rs. 55,000/- from the accused towards settlement. The
respondents allegedly took away the remaining Rs.5,000/-. The Petitioner asked
for the balance amount of Rs.5,000/- from the SHO who again threatened the
Petitioner that he would implicate the Petitioner in a false criminal case and that he
would also be killed

It was alleged that on 29.6.1991 the accused were called by the police. The

petitioner was accompanied by one Constable Mohd. Iqbal. The accused beat up
the petitioner in the presence of the Constable. The Respondents refused to record
the statement of constable Mohd. Iqbal in whose presence the accused persons had
beaten up the petitioner. The Respondents did not lodge any report concerning the
incident, nor was the Injured Petitioner medically examined.
5.

The Petitioner on 1.7.1991 approached the DCP who directed the ACP to

get the report lodged. The report was thereafter lodged and the Petitioner was
medically examined. The Petitioner submitted that due to injuries, his condition
worsened and he was admitted in the J.P.N. hospital on 25.7.1991 where he was
operated upon but yet still no action was taken by the police. Since the
Respondents failed to perform their duty the Petitioner approached the
Metropolitan court with his complaint. The trial court took cognizance of the
matter and summoned all the accused persons under Sections 383, 506 and, 323 of
the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
6.

The Respondents preferred a revision before the ASJ seeking discharge on

the ground that they were public servants and prior sanction was necessary for
prosecuting them. The ASJ allowed the revision and discharged the Respondents
by his order dated 22.3.2002. The extracts of the order are as follows;

CRL.REV.P.788/2002 & CRMA 12512/2005

3 OF 7

“I am of the view that the Ld. M.M. Mis-directed himself by
not considering the protective umbrella provided to such police
officials in right perspective who while acting in discharge of
official duty and commit certain un-called for action which may
amount to the offence while purporting to act in their official duty,
cannot be prosecuted for such offences and no cognizance of such
offences can be taken except with the previous sanction of the state
government for taking cognizance of the offences allegedly
committed by the petitioners, the impugned orders of the summoning
as well as the impugned orders of the Ld. M.M. whereby he rejected
the application of the Petitioner need to be set aside”

7.

The Learned counsel for the Petitioner contended that the protection under

section 197 Cr. P.C. is available only when the act is done pursuant to official
duty and under the colour of office. The duty of a police officer is to register the
FIR whenever a person approaches with a complaint about commission of a
cognizable offence. He submitted that threatening the complainant to involve him
in some false and frivolous criminal case, causing bodily harm, compelling him to
enter into a compromise with accused persons and not giving him the complete
amounts as per the compromise do not come within the ambit of the phrase “colour
of office”. The protection under section 197 Cr. P.C. should therefore not be
extended to such officials.
8.

The respondent accused, on the other hand, supported the impugned order.

Learned counsel submitted that each of the allegations levelled against the accused
were admittedly committed by them in the capacity of police officers; it was the
CRL.REV.P.788/2002 & CRMA 12512/2005

case of the complainant that the accused committed those acts in the course of their
job. Therefore, the trial court could not have proceeded further in the absence of a
sanction under Section 197, read with Section 140 of the Delhi Police Act.
9.

The issue of applicability of Section 197 is a vexed one; it has arisen for

consideration in numerous decisions. Indeed it would appear that the courts have
had occasion to visit and revisit the question and re-state the law on many
occasions. The latest in the series is Prakash Singh Badal& Anr. V .State of
Punjab &Ors. reported as 2007 (1) JCC 236; the Supreme Court held that before
Section197 can be invoked, it must be shown that the official concerned was
accused of an offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or
purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties. It is the duty which requires
examination so much as the act, because the act can be performed both in the
discharge of the official duty as well as in the dereliction of it. The act must fall
within the scope and range of the official duties of the public servant concerned. It
is the quality of the act which is important and the protection of this section is
available if the act falls within the scope and range of his official duty. Court had
held in Raj Kishore Roy -vs- Kamleshwar Pandey 2002-(108)-CRLJ -3780 -SC as
follows:
"The law on the subject is well settled. It has been held by this
Court in the case of P.P. Unnikrishnan and another vs. Puttiyottil
CRL.REV.P.788/2002 & CRMA 12512/2005

5 OF 7

Alikutty and another, reported in 2000 (8) SCC 131 (2000 Cri. LJ
4041 : 2000 AIR SCW 3223 : AIR 2000 SC 2952) that under
Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code no protection has
been granted to the public servant if the act complained of is not in
connection with the discharge of his duty or in excuse of his duty.
In the case of P. K. Pradhan vs. State of Sikkim reported in 2001
(6) SCC 704), it has been held that the legislative mandate
engrafted in sub-section (1) of Section 197 is a prohibition imposed
by the statute from taking cognizance. It has been held that the
offence alleged to have been committed must have something to do,
or must be related in some manner, with the discharge of official
duty. It has been held that the only point for determination is
whether the act was committed in discharge of official duty. It has
been held that there must be a reasonable connection between the
act and the official duty. It has been held that for invoking
protection under Section 197 of the Code, the acts of the accused,
complained of, must be such that the same cannot be separated
from the discharge of official duty, but if there was no reasonable
connection between them and the performance of those duties, and
the official status furnishes only the occasion or opportunity for the
acts, then no sanction would be required. It has been held that if the
case as put forth by the prosecution fails or the defence establishes
that the act purported to be done is in discharge of duty, the
proceedings will have to be dropped. It is held that the question of
sanction under Section 197 of the Code can be raised any time after
the cognizance; maybe immediately after cognizance or framing of
charge or even at the time of conclusion of trial and after
conviction as well. It is held that there can be cases when it may not
be possible to decide the question effectively without giving
opportunity to the defence to establish that what he did was in
discharge of official duty. It has been held that the claim of the
accused, that the act that he did was in course of the performance
of his duty, was a reasonable one and neither pretended nor
fanciful, can be examined during the course of trial by giving
opportunity to the defence to establish it."

10.

Fortunately for me, further analysis on the issue is unnecessary, in view of a

CRL.REV.P.788/2002 & CRMA 12512/2005

6 OF 7

judgment of this court, reported as Inspector Bal Krishen -vs- State of Delhi, 2000
(106) Crl.LJ 1217. In that case, the petitioner, a policeman was alleged to have
pushed the complainant from the roof of the house which resulted in fracture in the
left leg. The court held that such action cannot lie within the scope of his official
duties as there is no reasonable nexus between that act and the duties attached to
his office. Here too, the allegations of misbehaviour of the respondent accused, in
slapping, and abusing the petitioner and compelling him to accept a compromise
cannot be said to have reasonable connection with the performance of duties, of
the said public servants. The official status furnished them the occasion or
opportunity for the alleged acts.
11.

For the reasons discussed above, the revisional court fell into error in

proceeding to hold that sanction was necessary to prosecute the respondent. The
impugned order is therefore in error; it is hereby set aside. The matter is remitted
to the concerned Metropolitan Magistrate, who shall proceed further upon the
complaint, in accordance with law.
12.

The revision petition is allowed, in the above terms. No costs.
