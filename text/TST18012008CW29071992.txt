Per Thakur, J (oral)
This writ petition calls in question an interim order passed in
Appeal No. 310/STT/90-91 pending before the Sales Tax Appellate
Tribunal, Tis Hazari, Delhi whereby the petitioner herein has been
directed to deposit 20% of the Sales tax amount of Rs.8,35,209/determined as payable for the assessment year 1985-86. The Tribunal
has, while disposing of an application under Section 43(5) of Delhi
Sales Tax Act, 1975 read with Rule 36(6) of Delhi Sales Tax Rules,
1975 directed a predeposit as indicated above but demanded security
for the balance amount to be furnised within a period of 30 days.

When this matter came up for orders before this Court on 21st

October, 1992 this Court directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of
Rs.1 Lac and furnish a bank guarantee for the remaining amount of
Rs.7,35,209/-. That order was complied with by the petitioner and the
amount of Rs.1 lac deposited by it. A bank guarantee for Rs.7,35,209
was also furnished by it. By another order dated 2nd December, 1993,
the bank guarantee earlier furnished by the petitioner was released in
favour of the petitioner subject to the petitioner depositing a further
sum of Rs.1 lac in cash and furnishing immovable property security in
a sum of Rs.6,35,209/- to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Sales
Tax.

It is not in dispute that the petitioner has complied with that

direction also. The result, therefore, is that the petitioner has already
deposited a sum of Rs.2 lacs in cash and furnished property security
to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Sales Tax for the balance
amount of Rs.6,35,209/-.

In that view, therefore, the direction

regarding deposit of 20% of the tax amount and furnishing security
for the balance is satisfied by the petitioner, no matter, in
consequence of the directions issued by this Court. Such being the
position the entire controversy in the writ petition relating to the
validity of the order impugned in the same is rendered academic.
Learned counsel for the parties, therefore, submitted and in our
opinion rightly so that this petition could be finally disposed of making
the arrangement mentioned above absolute with a direction to the
Appellate Authority to expeditiously dispose of the appeal.

We,

accordingly make the interim arrangement in terms of orders dated
21st October, 1992 and 2nd December, 1993 absolute and direct that
the first Appellate Authority shall expeditiously dispose of the appeal
pending before it.
