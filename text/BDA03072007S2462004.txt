BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J
1.
This is an application under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the “CPC”) whereby the
plaintiffs seeking an interim injunction restraining the defendant from using
the impugned trade mark WHIP TOPPING which, according to the plaintiffs,
is deceptively similar to their registered trade mark RICH'S WHIP TOPPING
or any other deceptive variations thereof upon or in relation to their goods or
business. The plaintiffs have also sought an interim injunction restraining the
defendant from passing off and infringement of copyright by restraining the
IA1607/04 in CS(OS)246/2004

Page No.1 of 11

defendant from using the identical trade dress, similar packaging, colour
scheme, instructions etc in respect of its WHIP TOPPING product.

2.

It has been contended that the plaintiff No.1 is one of the world's

premium food companies with more than 2300 products sold in over 75
countries. The plaintiff No.2 is a company incorporated in India under the
Companies Act, 1956 and is a joint venture concern for making the plaintiff
No.1's products, including non-dairy products, available in the Indian market.
According to the plaintiffs, the plaintiff No.1 is a family owned business
founded in 1945 by Robert E Rich, Sr., founder and chairman of the Board.
The said Mr Robert E Rich Sr., directed a laboratory team to search for a
vegetable based replacement for whipped cream derived from a new source –
the soya bean. While still in the development stage, Rich discovered that the
soya bean substance could be frozen, thawed and whipped. According to the
plaintiffs, the new product was immediately hailed as the miracle cream from
soya bean and it revolutionised food processing and opened up a new world of
non-dairy products to the growing frozen food industry. The miracle cream
was called Rich's Whip Topping (non-dairy topping) and later served as the
springboard for a series of other non-dairy products including Rich's
Bettercreme Icing and Filling, Rich's On Top non-dairy dessert topping.
According to the plaintiffs the mark RICH'S WHIP TOPPING and WHIP
TOPPING are registered and / or pending registration in several countries of
IA1607/04 in CS(OS)246/2004

Page No.2 of 11

the world. Insofar as India is concerned, RICH'S WHIP TOPPING is a duly
registered trade mark of the plaintiffs under No. 561884 from November 13,
1991 in Class 30 for “non-dairy toppings, icings, fillings and other goods in
Class 30”.

3.

The plaintiffs have also indicated that in India itself there has been

substantial sale of its products – RICH'S WHIP TOPPING.

In 1978-79 the

sales were to the extent of Rs 2,17,71,722/-. In 1998-99 the sales were
Rs 3,97,68,704. The sales have continued to grow and for the year 2002-2003
the figure was Rs 15,67,06,584/-.

4.

It is alleged by the plaintiffs that sometime in April, 2003, it came

to the attention of the plaintiffs that the defendant was selling a product which
had various similarities with the product of the plaintiffs. The defendant was
using the trademark WHIP TOPPING even though it had been marked as
having a trademark significance in the plaintiffs' product. The plaintiffs also
contended that the defendant used an identical red, blue and white colour
scheme so as to render both, the plaintiffs' products and the defendant's
products, identical. Even the instructions given on the plaintiffs' packaging
has allegedly been copied verbatim by the defendant.

According to the

plaintiffs, the similarities of the packaging is obvious to the naked eye. The
case of the plaintiffs is that as the product looked similar to each other, it was
IA1607/04 in CS(OS)246/2004

Page No.3 of 11

obvious that the defendant was not only infringing the trademark of the
plaintiff but also trying to pass off its product as that of the plaintiffs.
According to the plaintiffs, the defendant was fully aware of the plaintiff's'
worldwide goodwill and reputation with regard to RICH'S WHIP TOPPING
for over 50 years and wanted to derive unjust benefit therefrom.

The

defendant product is marketed under the trademark BELLS WHIP TOPPING.
It is pertinent to note that the defendant had also filed a suit No.53/2003
wherein it has claimed that it had filed trademark applications for the said
trademark BELLS WHIP TOPPING.

5.

Mr Sanjay Jain, the learned counsel for the plaintiffs submitted

that while considering this application under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2, because
the trademark is registered in favour of the plaintiff, prima facie, the case has
to be assumed in its favour. He submitted that the trademark of the plaintiffs
RICH'S WHIP TOPPING is registered since 1991 and that the defendant
applied for registration of its trademark BELLS WHIP only after receiving
notice from the plaintiffs and the registration is still pending.

For the

proposition that, prima facie, the case is assumed in favour of the registered
trademark, Mr Sanjay Jain referred to the following decisions :
1.

Goyal Gramodyog Sansthan and Ors v Seth Brothers & Anr.:
(2003) 27 PTC 142 (Del.)

2.

Midas Hygiene Industries P. Ltd & Anr. V Sudhir Bhatia &
Ors : 2004 (28) PTC 121 (SC)

6.

Metro Playing Cards Co. v Wazir Chand : AIR 1972 Del 248
Wackhaedt v Aristo Pharmaceuticals Ltd : (1999) 2 Arb. LR
258
Mr Sanjay Jain next contended that while comparing trademarks,

the trademarks, as a whole, have to be seen. According to him, the trademark
in the present case, is a package of the word trademark RICH'S WHIP
TOPPING alongwith the colour scheme, lettering style, design, instructions,
orientation and configuration of packaging. He submitted that if the product
with a deceptively similar word mark, packaging and get up for same class of
purchaser trading through same channel is introduced, it would then amount to
passing off even if only a few essential features are common in the word
mark He submitted that side by side comparison of the two marks is not
essential. For this proposition, he relied upon the following decisions :1. Atlas Cycles (Haryana) Ltd v Atlas Products Pvt Ltd and Anr :
(101) 2002 DLT 324.
2. Parle Products (P) Ltd v J.P. & Co. : AIR 1972SC 1359.
3. Hindustan Lever Limited, Bombay v Nirma Private Ltd :AIR
1992 Bom 195.
7.

Mr Jain further submitted that admitted prior user tilts the balance

of convenience in favour of the plaintiffs and, according to him, public policy
also requires protection by way of grant of an order of injunction. In this
context, he reiterated that the plaintiff No.1 had been using the trademark in

IA1607/04 in CS(OS)246/2004

Page No.5 of 11

relation to its product since 1945 and even in India since 1991. On the other
hand, the defendant's alleged user is from 1995. Therefore, according to him,
the plaintiffs' user is the prior user and this in itself is sufficient to tilt the
balance of convenience in their favour. Mr Jain relied upon the following
decisions :1.
2.

8.

Glaxo Synthetic Pharma v Naval Kishore Goyal : 2004 (29)
PTC 421.
Laxmikant V Patel v Chetanbhat Shah : (2002) 24 PTC 1
(SC).

The learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the plaintiffs'

registration under No.561884 in Class 30 in respect of RICH'S WHIP
TOPPING is subject to the following disclaimer :“Registration of this trademark shall give no right to the
exclusive use of the letter “S” and word “TOPPING”

9.

He submitted that it was necessary for the plaintiffs to have

disclosed the factum of this disclaimer and the non-disclosure of such a
material fact would make the suit liable for dismissal. For this proposition, he
placed reliance on a decision in the case of Om Prakash v Praveen Kumar :
2000 PTC 326. Continuing on the question of disclaimer, the learned counsel
for the defendant submitted that the disclaimers are put because they are of
non-distinctive character or serve no trademark function or the same have

IA1607/04 in CS(OS)246/2004

Page No.6 of 11

become common to the trade. It was further submitted that the plaintiffs had
accepted the disclaimer and are bound by it.

10.

He also contended that the trademark and the goods for which the

trademark is employed are two different things. It was contended that the
trademark is used on the goods to identify their source and origin. Generally
speaking, the mark must be something different from the thing marked. It was
further contended that the expression WHIP TOPPING is the name of the
product itself. It is generic term. It is descriptive of the product i.e., non-dairy
toppings, icing and fillings, imitation dairy products commonly used for
desserts, baked and frozen products etc. According to the defendant since the
expression WHIP TOPPING is descriptive of the product, no person can claim
exclusivity over the same. The trademark over which the plaintiffs could claim
exclusivity are RICH'S and RICH'S WHIP TOPPING. It was contended that,
insofar as the defendant was concerned, its trademark was BELLS and BELLS
WHIP TOPPING as a whole. According to the defendant, there could be no
exclusivity in respect of WHIP TOPPING.

The learned counsel for the

defendant submitted that WHIP TOPPING is disclaimed in the plaintiff No.1's
registration in USA itself, where the plaintiff No.1 is incorporated. The learned
counsel for the defendant also submitted that under the relevant Canadian
legislation, WHIP TOPPING is described as a product. He also submitted that
the trade and industry at large use WHIP TOPPING as a product. He referred
IA1607/04 in CS(OS)246/2004

Page No.7 of 11

to some instances of the same which are at pages 33-56 of the defendant's
documents.

11.

The learned counsel for the defendant further submitted that even

the plaintiffs were using the expression WHIP TOPPING in a descriptive
manner. The trademark RICH'S WHIP TOPPING clearly refers to the WHIP
TOPPING manufactured by Rich as distinct from the defendant's product
which is BELLS WHIP TOPPING or, in other words, WHIP TOPPING
manufactured by BELLS. It was further submitted that the essential feature of
the trademark of the plaintiffs was RICH'S and that of the defendant was
BELLS and the two words are entirely different. The learned counsel for the
defendant referred to various decisions where injunction has been declined due
to descriptive words or lack of infringement or passing off or use of a word
common to the trade. In J.R. Kapoor v Micronix India : 1994 Supp (3) SCC
215, the trademarks that were considered were 'Microtel' and 'Micronics' in
connection with the use in Micro-chip Technology. Similarly in SBL Ltd v
Himalaya Drug Co : 1997 PTC (17) 540 (Delhi-DB), the trademarks that were
considered were 'Liv52' and 'Liv-T' which were both medicines for the liver. In
Gillette Company and Others v A.K. Stationery and Others : 2001 PTC 513
(Delhi), 'Flexgrip' and 'Ekco Flexgrip' were considered in respect of writing
instruments. In M/s Panacea Biotec Ltd v M/s Recon Ltd : 1996 PTC (16)
561 (Delhi), the marks were 'Nimulid' and 'Remulid' both of which were
IA1607/04 in CS(OS)246/2004

Page No.8 of 11

medicines which were derived from the basic drug Nimesulide. In Rupee
Gains Tele-Times Private Ltd v Rupee Times : 1995 PTC (15) 384, the
trademarks that were considered were 'Rupee Time' and 'Rupee Gain'. Both of
which were used in respect of Journals and newspapers.

Finally in

Competition Review (P) Ltd v N.N. Ojha : 1996 PTC (16) 124, the trademarks
that were considered were 'Competition Review' and 'Competition (Success)
Review', both of which were employed for journals for competitive exams. In
all the above cases, injunctions were not granted.

12.

Mr Sanjay Jain, in rejoinder, submitted with respect to the

disclaimer argument advanced by the learned counsel for the defendant that the
disclaimer part of a trademark is relevant only for subsequent registration and
not in a passing off action. In such an action, the defendant cannot take
advantage of the disclaimer. The validity of the two trademarks is to be taken
as a whole and not fragmented in two parts. For this proposition, he placed
reliance on : (1) Charan Das & M/s Veer Industries v Bombay Crockery :
1984 (PTC) 102 ; (2) Pidilite Industries v S.M. Associates : (2004) 28 PTC
193 (Bom) and (3) M/s Jindal Industries v M/s Samana Steel : 1993 PTC
129

IA1607/04 in CS(OS)246/2004

Page No.9 of 11

13.

Mr Jain also submitted that the descriptive nature of the registered

trademark does not dilute its entitlement to protection. For this, he placed
reliance on Globe Super Parts v Blue Super Flame : AIR 1986 Del 245

14.

There is no doubt that the plaintiffs are prior users of the trademark

RICH'S WHIP TOPPING. There is no doubt that this trademark was registered
in favour of the plaintiffs in 1991. There is also no doubt that the defendant
claims user of its trademark BELLS WHIP TOPPING since 1995.

The

question here is whether there is any infringement of the plaintiffs' registered
trademark. The first thing that has to be noted is that the disclaimer that was
placed in respect of the plaintiffs' trademark was not disclosed by the plaintiffs
in the plaint. That apart, it appears that the expression WHIP TOPPING has
become descriptive of the product.

The plaintiffs have two registered

trademarks, one of which is RICH'S and the other being RICH'S WHIP
TOPPING. WHIP TOPPING by itself is not a registered trademark. Insofar as
the exclusivity of use of the trademark RICH'S is concerned, there is no doubt
that the plaintiffs are entitled to its exclusive use. But the defendant is not
using the word RICH'S in its trademark at all. As regards the trademark
RICH'S WHIP TOPPING, the same has to be taken as a whole and cannot be
fragmented into RICH'S and WHIP TOPPING separately. The plaintiffs have
exclusivity over the whole expression i.e., RICH'S WHIP TOPPING. Prima
facie, they do not have exclusivity over the expression WHIP TOPPING.
IA1607/04 in CS(OS)246/2004

Page No.10 of 11

Inasmuch as the latter has become somewhat descriptive of the product itself.
This being the case, the distinctive features in the plaintiffs' trade mark and the
defendant's trademark are the word RICH'S and word BELLS. Straightaway it
can be said that there is no similarity between the two. Furthermore, while the
colours employed in the packaging by the defendant may be similar to those
employed by the plaintiffs, their presentation is different. This can be easily
discerned by a visual examination of their respective packages as placed on
record. Therefore, prima facie, I also do not see any scope for passing off the
defendant's product as that of the plaintiffs.

15.

For all these reasons, I am of the prima facie view that the

defendant has not infringed the plaintiffs' trademark nor has it passed off its
goods as those of the plaintiffs.

In these circumstances, it would not be

possible for this court to grant the interim injunction which the plaintiffs seek.
This application is dismissed.
