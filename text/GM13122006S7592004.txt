Shri Puran Chand Sethi entered into an agreement to sell dated 14th

January, 2004 with Shri Ravinder Nangia in respect of the property no.C269, admeasuring 325 sq. yards, Defence Colony, New Delhi for a total sale
consideration of Rs.2,74,00,000/-. Shri Ravinder Nangia paid a sum of
Rs.26 lakhs to Col. Puran Chand Sethi pursuant to the agreement to sell,
receipt whereof was acknowledged in the agreement dated 14th January,
2004 itself. The balance amount of Rs.2,48,00,000/- was agreed to be paid
by Shri Ravinder Nangia within three and a half months, i.e. on or before
30th April, 2004 against execution and registration of the sale deed and
handing over of the vacant and peaceful possession of the suit property by
Col. Puran Chand Sethi to Shri Ravinder Nangia.
2.

Shri Ravinder Nangia claims to have made a further payment of
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.2

Rs.13,00,000/- to Col. Puran Chand Sethi on 22nd January, 2004 pursuant to
a request from him even though he had no obligation to make any further
payment prior to execution of the sale deed under the agreement dated 14th
January, 2004.
3.

On or around the 27th April, 2004, Captain Rajesh Sethi (SC) filed CS

(OS) No.436/2004 against Col. Puran Chand Sethi and Shri Ravinder
Nangia being a suit for declaration, permanent injunction and mandatory
injunction seeking the following reliefs:“(a) Pass a decree of declaration that the Agreement to
Sell dated 14th January, 2004 entered into between
Defendants No.1 and 2 is void ab-initio and non-est and
of no consequence and effect;
(b) Pass a decree of mandatory injunction
commanding and directing the Defendants to cancel the
Agreement to Sell dated 14th August, 2004.
(c) Pass a decree of permanent injunction restraining
the Defendants, either directly, and/or indirectly, from
doing any act in furtherance of and/or indirectly, from
doing any act in furtherance of and/or under the
Agreement to Sell dated 14th January, 2004.
(d) Pass a decree of permanent injunction restraining
the Defendant No.1, either directly, and/or indirectly,
from transferring, alienating, or in any manner parting
with possession of property bearing No.C-269, Defence
Colony, New Delhi to Defendant No.2 or any other third
party.”

This suit was filed on the allegation that property no.C-269, Defence

Colony, New Delhi, was property owned by Hindu Undivided Family
(`HUF' for brevity) which HUF, at present, comprises:(i)

Col. P.C. Sethi, arrayed as Karta-defendant no.1 therein, who resides

in the property.
(ii)

Shri Ravi Sethi (eldest son of Col. P.C. Sethi, who resides in USA)

(iii)

Captain Rajesh Sethi (the second son of Col. P.C. Sethi, who resides

in the property)
(iv)

Shri Raman Sethi (the youngest son of Col. P.C. Sethi, who also

resides in the property).
5.

Captain Rajesh Sethi claimed that he was residing in the property

no.C-269, Defence Colony, New Delhi. It was further urged that this
property was purchased partly out of

monies received towards claims

received in respect of ancestral properties left behind in Pakistan and partly
from loans which were paid back from the sale of ancestral jewelery; that
the property being C-269, Defence Colony, New Delhi, was duly reflected
as joint family property in all returns filed by Col. Puran Chand Sethi in his
capacity as Karta of Hindu Undivided Family; that Captain Rajesh Sethi as
co-parcener of the said HUF, contributed to the keep and maintenance of the
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.4

property and asserted that he had made payment of conversion fee of
Rs.52,200/- by cheque no.121922 dated 3rd August, 1996 to facilitate
conversion of the HUF property from leasehold to freehold; that Col. Puran
Chand Sethi had no right to sell the property without the concurrence of the
co-parceners and to appropriate to his account the sale proceeds therefrom;
that Col. P.C. Sethi was 82 years of age, was facing extreme pressure on
account of acrimony with Shri Raman Sethi (his younger son) and his wife
Smt. Sangeeta Sethi and that he had been duped and an unfair advantage
taken of his advanced age and mentally distrait state and that undue
influence was exercised on Col. P.C. Sethi in order to procure the agreement
to sell dated 14th March, 2004.
On inter alia these pleas, it has been asserted that Col. Puran Chand
Sethi was not authorised to deal with this property in his individual capacity
and that the agreement to sell dated 14th January, 2004 is invalid, nonest and
void ab initio.
6.

Shri Ravinder Nangia received summons in CS (OS) No.436/2004. It

appears that Col. Puran Chand Sethi also wrote a letter dated 21st March,
2004 to Shri Ravinder Nangia stating that he did not intend to sell the suit
property to him.

Consequently, Shri Ravinder Nangia filed CS (OS)

IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.5

No.759/2004 against Shri Puran Chand Sethi being a suit for specific
performance urging that the suit filed by Shri Rajesh Sethi, was collusive
and had been got filed by Col. P.C. Sethi. It has been urged in the plaint
that Col. P.C. Sethi is bound by the terms and conditions of the agreement
to sell dated 14th January, 2004 and consequently the following prayers have
been sought:“(i) a decree for specific performance may please be passed in
favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant directing
ht edefendant to perform his part of obligations under
Agreement to Sell dated 14.01.2004 by executing the Sale
Deed and handling over of vacant peaceful possession of
the property No.C-269, Defence Colony, New Delhi in
favour of the plaintiff against the receipt of the balance
sale consideration of Rs.2,35,00,000/(ii) if and only if the Court comes to the conclusion that the
defendant is not the exclusive owner but only a co-owner
in respect of the suit property, then a decree for specific
performance may please be awarded in favour of the
plaintiff and against the defendant in respect of such share
of the defendant against payment of the proportionate
amount of sale consideration.
(iii) if and only if this Court ultimately comes to the conclusion
that the decree for specific performance cannot be granted
ion favour of the plaintiff, in that event and only in that
event and not byw ay of the alternative relief, it is prayed
that a decree for refu7nd of Rs.39,00,000/- alongwith a
decree for recovery of damages of Rs.75,00,000/alongwith interest @ 18% p.a. from the date of Agreement
till the date of payment be passed in favour of the plaintiff
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.6

and against the defendant;
7.

(iv) the costs of the suit be awarded in favour of the plaintiff.”
In CS (OS) No.436/2004, an application IA No.2730/2004 seeking

interim injunction was filed under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 of the Code of
Civil Procedure. On the 30th April, 2004, an ex parte ad interim injunction
was issued in favour of Capt. Rajesh Sethi against the defendants restraining
them from selling, alienating, creating any third party interest and/or taking
any steps pursuant to the agreement to sell dated 14th January, 2004.
8.

So far as CS (OS) No.759/2004 filed by Shri Ravinder Nangia is

concerned, the same was listed on the 22nd July, 2004. On the application
filed under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 of the CPC by him, being IA
No.4469/2004, this court restrained Col. Puran Chand Sethi from selling,
alienating, encumbering or creating any third party interest in the property
no.C-269, Defence Colony, New Delhi.
9.

On the 9th August, 2004, in CS (OS) No.436/2004, the court directed

that the suit be listed with CS (OS) No.759/2004 after obtaining necessary
orders from the Judge Incharge (Original Side).
The record shows that thereafter, from the 18th November, 2004, the
two cases have been listed on the same dates.

IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

10.

In the meantime, Capt. Raman Sethi filed IA No.5479/2004 seeking

impleadment in CS (OS) No.759/2004. This application was not opposed
on behalf of Shri Ravinder Nangia and on 7th March, 2005, Capt. Raman
Sethi was permitted to be impleaded as a defendant without prejudice to the
pleas raised by the plaintiff. Therefore, Capt. Raman Sethi who has been
arrayed as defendant no.2, is also contesting CS (OS) No.759/2004.
11.

In the written statement which has been filed by Shri Raman Sethi, i

Raman Sethi had taken pleas which are similar to the pleas taken by Capt
Rajesh Sethi, the other son of Col. Puran Chand Sethi, who has filed CS
(OS) No.436/2004.

Capt. Raman Sethi also urged that Shri Ravinder

Nangia was not entitled to the relief of specific performance inter alia on the
ground that Col. P.C. Sethi was not competent to execute the agreement
dated 14th January, 2004 in his individual capacity as the property was HUF;
that Shri Ravinder Nangia had duped defendant no.1 to enter into the
agreement on account of the age of the defendant no.1 along with intra
family conflicts amongst his sons; that the agreement was not registered in
accordance with law and that the agreement had been obtained by undue
influence and stood terminated by Col. P.C. Sethi vide his letter dated 21 st
March, 2004.
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

12.

Both the suits were listed before the court on 20 th March, 2006. With

the consent of parties, in both suits, IA No.2730/2004 in CS (OS)
No.436/2004 and IA No.4469/2004 in CS (OS) No.759/2004, both being
applications under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 CPC, were disposed of with the
direction that the parties shall maintain status quo with regard to the
possession and title in respect of the suit properties till disposal of the suit.
13.

On the same date, issues were framed in both suits and parties were

directed to file their respective list of witnesses within two weeks. The
plaintiffs were directed to file their evidence by way of affidavit and the
matter was directed to be listed before the Joint Registrar for fixing a dates
for trial.
14.

It appears that Shri Rajesh Sethi, plaintiff in CS (OS) No.759/2004

has filed his affidavits of evidence of his witnesses.
15.

In CS (OS) No.436/2004, the plaintiff-Capt. Rajesh Sethi, has filed

IA No.4592/2006 seeking consolidation of the two suits for the purposes of
trials.
16.

At the same time, IA No.5979/2006 has been filed by Shri Ravi Sethi,

another son of Shri Puran Chand Sethi in CS (OS) No.436/2004 and IA
No.5990/2006 in CS (OS) No.759/2004. These applications have been filed
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.9

under the provisions of Order 1 Rule 10 of the CPC by Shri Ravi Sethi,
urging that he too is entitled to be impleaded as a party in these suits on the
ground that suit property is HUF property and the agreement to sell was
entered into without his consent and permission and that as a co-parcenar,
the applicant had substantial interest in the property and would be directly
effected by the judgment which may be passed. Shri Ravi Sethi has urged
that he is settled in the USA and living there for the past 38 years. He
became aware of the pendency of the suits and the matters only when he
visited India in January, 2006.

Consequently, the applications for

impleadment were filed on or around the 18th May, 2006.
17.

All these applications have been vehemently opposed by Mr. Dinesh

Garg, learned counsel representing Shri Ravinder Nangia.
IA No.5990/2006 in CS (OS) No.759/2004
18.

So far as the application for impleadment under Order 1 Rule 10

being IA No.IA No.5990/2006 in CS (OS) No.759/2004 by Shri Ravi Sethi
is concerned, Mr. Dinesh Garg, learned counsel for the plaintiff, has
contended that Shri Ravi Sethi, applicant, was not a party to the agreement
dated 14th January, 2004 and had no concern with the same and
consequently is not a necessary or proper party to the suit. Placing reliance
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.10

on JT 2005 (4) SC 565 Kasturi Vs. Iyyamperumal, it is urged that it is well
settled that all co-owners are not necessary to be impleaded in suit for
specific performance. It is contended that only a party to the agreement to
sell relied upon by the plaintiff is a necessary and proper party in a suit.
19.

On the other hand, Mr. Ravi Gupta, learned counsel appearing for the

applicant Shri Ravi Sethi in IA No. 5990/2006, has urged that the plaintiff
Shri Ravinder Nangia had recorded a no objection to the impleadment of his
brother Capt. Raman Sethi who has an identical claim in the suit property as
that of the present applicant. It is contended that the issue as to whether the
property is an HUF property or not, has already been framed and
consequently, no prejudice would result to the plaintiff if this application is
allowed.
20.

It would be appropriate to consider IA No.5990/2006 which has been

filed by Shri Ravi Sethi, claiming to be a son of the defendant Col. Puran
Chand Sethi in CS (OS) No.759/2004. This application has been filed
under the provisions of Order 1 Rule 10 of the CPC seeking impleadment as
a defendant. The principal reason cited in support of this application is that
the issue which the defendant is seeking to urge, is already before this court
inasmuch as the applicant's brother Shri Raman Sethi, was added as a party
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.11

on behalf of Shri Ravinder Nangia on 7th March, 2005.

It has been

submitted that issue nos.4, 6 & 7 which were framed on 20th March, 2006,
relate to the question as to whether the suit property was HUF property. I
find that the applicant has asserted a right in the property only being a
member of the HUF.
21.

The maintainability of this application and its merits would require to

be tested on the settled principles of law. Merely because, the plaintiff had
not objected to the grant of an application filed by the applicant's brother
Shri Raman Sethi for impleadment, would not justify the grant of the
present application. Inasmuch as the same has been vehemently opposed on
behalf of the plaintiff Shri Ravinder Nangia the consideration thereof can
be only as per law.
22.

So far as the concession made by Shri Ravinder Nangia in permitting

Mr. Raman Sethi to be added as a party defendant, is concerned, the
plaintiff cannot be compelled to make a similar concession for permitting
the applicant Shri Ravi Sethi to be also so added. The order passed on a
concession by the plaintiff is not in the nature of a judgment on adjudication
which would constitute a binding precedent for the purposes of the
consideration of the present application. In the light of the opposition by
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.12

the plaintiff, the application of Shri Ravi Sethi has to be clearly adjudicated
upon and decided in accordance with law. Merely because another person
claiming right similar as that of the applicant was added as a party
defendant, would not, by itself, justify grant of the present application as
well. In asmuch as the same has been vehemently opposed on behalf of the
plaintiff Shri Ravinder Nangia the consideration thereof can only be as per
law.
23.

My attention has been drawn to the principles laid down by the

Supreme Court in JT 2005 (4) SC 565 Kasturi Vs. Iyyamperumal & Ors.
In this case, the court held thus:“6. In our view, a bare reading of this provision namely,
second part of Order 1 Rule 10 sub-rule (2) of the CPC
would clearly show that the necessary parties ina suit for
specific performance of a contract for sale are the parties to
the contract or if they are dead their legal representatives as
also a person who had purchased the contracted property
from the vendor. In equity as well in law, the contract
constitutes rights and also regulates the liabilities of the
parties. A purchaser is a necessary party as he would be
affected if he had purchased with notice of the contract, but
a person who claims adversely to the claim of a vendor is,
however, not a necessary party. From the above, it is now
clear that two tests are to be satisfied for determinating the
question who is a necessary party. These are – (1) there
must be a right to some relief against such party in respect
of the controversies involved in the proceedings (2) no
effective decree can be passed in the absence of such party.
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.13

8.
We have carefully considered sub-sections (a) to (e)
of Section 19 of the Act. From a careful examination of the
afore-said provisions of sub-sections (a) to (e) of the
Specific Relief Act we are of the view that the persons
seeking addition in the suit for specific performance of the
contract for sale who were not claiming under the vendor
but they were claiming adverse to the title of the vendor do
not fall in any of the categories enumerated in sub-sections
(a) to (e) of Section 19 of the Specific Relief Act.
10. As noted herein earlier, two tests are required to be
satisfied to determine the question who is a necessary
party, let us now consider who is a proper party in a suit for
specific performance of a contract for sale. For deciding
the question who is a proper party in a suit for specific
performance the guiding principle is that the presence of
such a party is necessary to adjudicate the controversies
involved in the suit for specific performance of the contract
for sale. Thus, the question is to be decided keeping in
mind the scope of the suit. The question that is to be
decided in a suit for specific performance of the contract
for sale is to the enforceability of the contract entered into
between the parties to the contract. If the person seeking
addition is added in such a suit, the scope of the suit for
specific performance would be enlarged and it would be
practically converted into a suit for title. Therefore, for
effective adjudication of the controversies involved in the
suit, presence of such parties cannot be said to be necessary
at all. Lord Chancelor Cottenham in Tasker v. Small made
the following observations:
“It is not disputed that, generally, to a bill for a
specific performance of a contract for sale, the parties
to the contract only are the proper parties; and, when
the ground of the jurisdiction of Courts of Equity in
suits of that kind is considered it could not properly
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.14

be otherwise. The Court assumes jurisdiction in such
cases, because a Court of law, giving damages only
for the non-performance of the contract, in many
cases does not afford an adequate remedy. But, in
equity, as well as in law, the contract constitutes the
right and regulates the liabilities of the parties; and
the object of both proceedings is to place the party
complaining as nearly as possible in the same
situation as the defendant had agreed that he should
be placed in. It is obvious that persons, strangers to
the contract, and, therefore, neither entitled to the
right, nor subject to the liabilities which arise out of
it, are as much strangers to a proceeding to enforce
the execution of it as they are to a proceeding to
recover damages for the breach of it.”
(Emphasis supplied)
12. From the aforesaid discussion, it is pellucid that
necessary parties are those persons in whose absence no
decree can be passed by the Court or that there must be a
right to some relief against some party in respect of the
controversy involved in the proceedings and proper parties
are those whose presence before the Court would be
necessary in order to enable the Court effectually and
completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions
involved in the suit although no relief in the suit was
claimed against such person.
17. That apart, there is another principle which cannot
also be forgotten. The applicant, who has filed the instant
suit for specific performance of the contract for sale is
dominus litus and cannot be forced to add parties against
whom he does not want to figtht unless it is a compulsion
of the rule of law, as already discussed above. For the
reasons aforesaid, we are therefore of the view that
respondent nos.1 and 4 to 11 are neither necessary parties
nor proper parties and therefore they are not entitled to be
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.15

added as party-defendants in the pending suit for specific
performance of the contract for sale.

24.

21. For the reasons aforesaid, in our view, the stranger to
the contract, namely, the respondent nos.1 and 4 to 11
making claim independent and adverse to the title of the
respondent nos.2 and 3 are neither necessary nor proper
parties, and therefore, not entitled to join as party
defendants in the suit for specific performance of the
contract for sale.”
The Apex Court in Kasturi's case (supra) placed reliance and cited

with approval, the principles laid down in its earlier pronouncement in JT
1995 (1) SC 273 (para 13), Anit Kumar Singh Vs. Shiv Nath Mishra and
JT 1997 (7) SC 226 (para14) Vijay Pratap & Anr. Vs. Sambbu Saran
Sinha & Others.
25.

Certainly, it is the plaintiff who is dominus litus and decides who it

wishes to join as party in the suit. The plaintiff before this court has
knowledge of the fact that the applicant is asserting rights in the property
and claim and entitlement thereto and yet does not want to join him. Thus,
the result of the rejection of such application is obviously at the risk of the
plaintiff because he cannot be compelled to join any other person as party
with defendants. However, in the light of the binding principles laid down
by the Apex Court and the applicable statutory provisions, a person who is
not a party to the contract or is claiming interest from a party to the
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.16

litigation, is not a necessary or a proper party for the consideration of a
claim by a plaintiff seeking entitlement to specific performance.
26.

The applicant before this court, Shri Ravi Sethi, is the son of the

executant of the contract. He has admittedly neither made nor signed the
agreement to sell in favour of the plaintiff. He is claiming title in the suit
property. However, as noticed hereinabove, it is well settled that such
person is neither a necessary nor a proper party for the consideration of the
plaintiff's claim seeking entitlement to a decree for specific performance
against Col. Puran Chand Sethi.
27.

In this view of the matter, I find no merit in this application which is

hereby dismissed.
IA No.12192/2006 in CS (OS) No.759/2004
By this application, Shri Raman Sethi defendant no.2 has sought
permission to amend the list of witnesses filed by him.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties. I find that in this case is
yet commence.

Certain directions have been passed today in IA

No.4592/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004 which would impact the trial.
It is well settled that rules of procedure are handmaids to ends of
justice. Certainly no prejudice results to any party if this application is
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.17

allowed.
Accordingly, IA No.12129/2006 is allowed and defendnat no.2 is
permitted to file the amended list of witnesses in two weeks.
IA No.4592/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004
1.

By this application, Captain Rajesh Sethi has made a prayer for an

order consolidating this suit with CS (OS) No.759/2004 filed by Shri
Ravinder Nangia.

This application has been strongly opposed by Mr.

Dinesh Garg, learned counsel for the purchaser who is the plaintiff in CS
(OS) No.759/2004. It has been urged that by consolidation of the two suits,
trial in this suit would be delayed.

It has been further contended that the

suit No.759/2004 by his client, is a suit seeking the relief of specific
performance of the agreement to sell dated 14th January, 2006 while the
issues raised in the other suit have no bearing in this case. It has been urged
that in a suit for specific performance, the court is only concerned with the
legality and validity of the agreement to sell which was admittedly executed
by Col. Puran Chand Sethi. The other ground of the objection is based on
the contention that the parties to the two suits are not the same and for this
reason also, there can be no consolidation of the two suits as has been
prayed for by Capt. Rajesh Sethi, plaintiff in Suit No. 436/2004 by way of
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.18

IA No.4592/2006.
2.

It is well settled that one of the considerations in an application

seeking consolidation of a suit with the another litigation, would be the
nature of the matters in issue in the two suits. There is no dispute that both
suits relate to the same property, i.e. the property bearing No.C-269,
Defence Colony, New Delhi. Pursuant to the order passed on 9th August,
2004 in CS (OS) No.436/2004, both the suits are being listed together.
Issues in the two suits were separately framed on 25th March, 2006.

My

attention has been drawn to those issues which overlap or would involve the
same evidence in the two suits and deserve to be considered in extenso. For
the sake of convenience, the same are set out along side hereinbelow.
Issues in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Issues in CS (OS) No.759/2004

4. Whether the suit property is a
HUF property of the plaintiff,
defendant no.1, defendant no.3 and

From the above, it is clearly evident that the questions raised by the

parties in the two suits would definitely overlap and that these issues are
almost identical. I also find from the list of witnesses which have been filed
by the parties in the two suits, that the list of witnesses of the plaintiff in CS
(OS) No.436/2004 and of the defendant Col. P.C. Sethi in Suit No.436/2004
as well his witnesses in the list of witnesses in Suit No.759/2004 are almost
identical.

In CS (OS) No.759/2004, Col. P.C. Sethi has sought some

IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.20

additional witnesses. However, a large number of witnesses are same.
4.

From the above, it is evident that on such overlapping issues if the

statements of the witnesses who are common in the two suits on such
overlapping witnesses, were to be separately recorded, the same would
result in unnecessary protraction of the trial.
5.

Undoubtedly, there would be unwarranted delay and additional

expense of requiring the same witness to be summoned twice. Conflicting
evidence by the same witness on similar issues may even lead to conflicting
decisions on such issues.
6.

My attention has been drawn to the principles laid down by this court

in 67 (1997) DLT 189 S.C. Jain Vs. Smt. Bindeshwari Devi wherein the
court has succinctly laid down the law which would govern a request for
consolidation of two suits. The principles which would bind the court and
the procedure to be followed were authoritatively laid down by the court.
The court noticed that sufficient unity or similarity in the matter in issue in
the suits or the fact that determination of the suits rests mainly on common
questions which would make it convenient to have them tried as analogous
cases would require exercise of the power to consolidate the suits.
However, it was noticed that the court could pass three kinds of directions,
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.21

firstly, a direction for analogous or simultaneous hearing of the suits;
secondly, consolidation of the suits in their entirety;

and thirdly,

consolidation of the suits for the purposes of trial.
7.

In the instant case, it has to be borne in mind that though some of the

issues do overlap in the two suits, however, the absolute identity of the
parties is not so. Additionally, there are certain issues in respect of which
only Col. Puran Chand Sethi would be concerned. These would relate to,
for instance, readiness, willingness and ability to specifically perform his
obligations under the agreement to sell dated 14th January, 2004 on the part
of the Shri Ravinder Nangia plaintiff in CS (OS) No.759/2004.
Consequently, consolidation of the two suits in their entirety would result in
injustice to one party and would not be legally permissible. Similarly, a
direction for analogous or simultaneous hearing of the suits by itself would
also not result in avoiding the mischief as noticed above.
8.

The only alternative which would remain consequently would be a

direct consolidation of the suits for trial and such issues wherein the same
evidence is required to be led.
9.

It would be useful to consider the principles laid down by the court in

67 (1997) DLT 189 S.C. Jain Vs. Bindeshwari Devi in so far as
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.22

consolidation of suits for merely trial was concerned. In this behalf, the
court laid down the applicable principles thus:“20.3 Consolidation of suits for trial merely or partial
consolidation enables the evidence in the two suits being
recorded in one suit only and the evidence so recorded
being read in the other suit as well. Inspite of the
consolidated trial having taken place the two suits remain
separate and distinct from each other. They may be
disposed of by one judgment or two judgments on the
same evidence but in any case two decrees shall have to be
drawn up at the end. Take for example the case of the
cross suits filed on a cause of action arising out of the
same transaction. One suit may be dismissed and the other
may be decreed. The two decrees in the two suits will be
different. One out of the two parties may appeal against
one and may not appeal against the other if the bar of res
judicata is not attracted while doing so. Take the case of
an owner of limited estate haivng made several alienations
in favour of different persons and the transactions having
been challenged by the reversioners in different suits
against different purchasers. Some suit may be decreed
some may be dismissed though evidence may be common
and common questions of law and facts arise. Inspite of
consolidation for trial of the suits and disposed of by the
Court pronouncing one or more judgments separate
decrees shall have to be drawn up.
10.

It would also be useful to consider the pronouncement of the Supreme

Court in (2004) 3 SCC 85 Chitivalasa Jute Mills Vs. Jay Pee Rewa
Cement wherein the Apex Court was required to consider the issue of
consolidation and held thus:IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.23

“9. On the facts averred in the two plaints filed by the
two parteis before two different courts, it is clear that the
parties are substantially the same. Jaypee Rewa have
alleged and Willard India or Chitivalasa Jute Mills do
not deny that Chitivalasa Jute Mills is nothing but a
division of Willard India Limited. The fact remains that
the cause of action alleged in the two plaints refers to the
same period and the same transactions i.e., the supply of
jute bags between the period 7-1-1992 and 31-12-1993.
What is the cause of action alleged by one party as
foundation for the relief prayed for and the decree sought
for in one case is the ground of defence in the other case.
The issues arising for decision would be substantially
common. Almost the same set of oral and documentary
evidence would be needed to be adduced for the purpose
of determining the issues of facts and law arising for
decision in the two suits before two different courts.
Thus, there will be duplication of recording of evidence
if separate trails are held. The two courts would be
writing two judgments. The possibility that the two
courts may record findings inconsistent with each other
and conflicting decrees may come to be passed cannot be
ruled out.
12. The two suits ought not to be tried separately.
Once the suit at Rewa has reached the court at
Visakhapatnam, the two suits shall be consolidated for
the purpose of trial and decision. The trial court may
frame consolidated issues. The Code of Civil Procedure
does not specifically speak of consolidation of suits but
the same can be done under the inherent powers of the
court flowing from Section 151 CPC.
Unless
specifically prohibited, the civil court has inherent power
to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of
justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the court.
Consolidation of suits is ordered for meeting the ends of
justice as it saves the parties from multiplicity of
IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

11.

proceedings, delay and expenses. Complete or even
substantial and sufficient similarity of the issues arising
for decision in two suits enables the two suits being
consolidated for trial and decision. The parties are
relieved of the need of adducing the same or similar
documentary and oral evidence twice over in the two
suits at two different trials. The evidence having been
recorded, common arguments need to be addressed
followed by one common judgment. However, as the
suits are two, the court may, based on the common
judgment, draw two different decrees or one common
decree to be placed on the record of the two suits. This
is how the trial court at Visakhapatnam shall proceed
consequent upon this order of transfer of suit from Rewa
to the court at Visakhapatnam.”
Before this court, the applicant has restricted its prayer to an order

directing a consolidation to be restricted only for the purposes of trail and
decision.
In the light of the aforegoing discussion, this application would
require to be allowed, however, subject to the following directions:(i).

The two suits are consolidated for the purpose of the evidence which

is to be led in respect of issue nos.4, 7, 9 & 10 in CS (OS) No.436/2004 and
issue nos.1, 2, 4, 6 & 7 in CS (OS) No.759/2004.
(ii)

The evidence on these issues shall be led in CS (OS)

No.436/2004.
(iii)

Captain Rajesh Sethi, as plaintiff, shall commence to lead the

IA 4592/2006 & IA 5979/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2004

Page No.25

evidence followed by Col. Puran Chand Sethi and the other defendants in
CS (OS) No.436/2004. Shri Ravinder Nangia shall lead evidence only
thereafter.
(iv)

So far as the other issues which have been framed in CS (OS)

No.759/2004 is concerned, only Col. Puran Chand Sethi shall have the right
to cross-examine Shri Ravinder Nangia, the plaintiff herein.
(v)

The parties shall have the right to lead evidence on other issues and

on all other rights in accordance with law.
(vi)

In the light of the order directing consolidation for the purposes of

trial on the afore-noticed issue, it is directed that the evidence on such
issues which have been recorded on issue nos.1, 2, 4, 6 & 7 in CS
(OS)No.436/2004 shall be read as evidence recorded on the issues noticed
above in CS (OS) No.759/2004.
(vii) So far as the adjudication is concerned, it shall be for the court to take
a decision as to whether it is desirous of disposing of the two suits by a
single judgment or by two separate judgment. Needless to say, two decrees
would require to be drawn up.
IA No.4592/2006 filed by the plaintiff in CS (OS) No.436/2004 is
consequently allowed in the above terms.

IA No.12193/2006 in CS (OS) No.436/2006
This application filed by Shri Raman Sethi, defendant no.3 seeks the
same prayers as in IA No.12192/2006 in CS (OS) No.759/2006.
The same has been allowed.
For reasons stated in the order passed in IA No.12192/2006, this
application is also allowed.
The defendant no.3 shall file its amended list of witnesses within two
weeks.
There shall be no orders as to costs.
