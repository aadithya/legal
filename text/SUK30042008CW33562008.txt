1.

The petitioner is a student of B.Tech. Course with

Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology/respondent No.2. The
institute

is

affiliated

to

Guru

Govind

Singh

Indraprastha

University/respondent No.1. By this petition, the petitioner prays
that he be permitted by the respondents to appear in the IVth
Semester End Term Theory Examination 2007-08 in the said

WP(C) No.3356/2008

course scheduled to commence from 6th May, 2008.
2.

According to the petitioner, by a notice dated 17th

April, 2008, the respondents have permitted as many as 74
students who were short of attendance to appear for the End
Term Semester Examinations as a special case by giving grace
attendance

to

make

up

the

shortage.

He

states

that

inexplicably, the petitioner, who ought to have been treated
similarly, has been denied this opportunity.
3.

Counsel appearing for respondent No.2 Institute in

response to advance notice has tendered a certificate dated 29th
April, 2008 issued by the Director of the Institute certifying that
the petitioner's aggregate attendance in all subjects is 20.3%
only. He has also brought to my notice the relevant ordinances
of the Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University applicable to
the institute and in particular Clause 9 of Ordinance 11 which,
inter alia, states as follows :
“A student shall be required to have a
minimum attendance of 75% or more in
the aggregate of all the courses taken
together in a semester, provided that the
Dean of the school in case of University
Schools and Principal/ Director in case of
University maintained/ affiliated institutes
may condone attendance shortage upto
5% for individual student for reasons to be
recorded. However, under no condition, a
student who has an aggregate attendance
of less than 70% in a semester shall be
allowed to appear in the semester end
examination.”
4.

An examination of this ordinance makes it clear that

at best, the 5% shortage in attendance can be condoned for

WP(C) No.3356/2008

reasons to be recorded and that there is no scope for any
further condonation.

Looking to the certificate proffered by

counsel for respondent No.2 at the bar, which is taken on
record, it is obvious that even if the requisite relaxation were to
be granted, the petitioner's attendance would still remain
woefully short. At the insistence of counsel for the petitioner,
counsel for respondent No.2 on instructions from Mr. Samandar
Singh, Office Superintendent of the Institute states that no
student has been given condonation in attendance beyond what
is permitted under the relevant ordinances and regulations.
5.

Be that as it may, and regardless of this fact, one

thing is clear that the petitioner's case must stand on its own
footing. Even if it is assumed for a moment that the Institute
has acted in violation of any regulation with regard to the
attendance rules in the case of some other students by granting
them any relaxation or condonation beyond the permissible
limits; that would not confer any right on the petitioner to the
benefit of the same infraction.
claimed in illegality.

In short, equality cannot be

In U.P. State Sugar Corporation Ltd.

Vs. Sant Raj Singh 2006 (9) SCC 82, the Supreme Court held
that;
“26. Yet again in Union of India Vs.
International
Trading
Company
(2003) 5 SCC 437, this Court opined;
'A party cannot claim that since
something wrong has been done in
another case direction should be given for
doing another wrong. It would not be

setting a wrong right, but would be
perpetuating another wrong.
In such
matter there is no discrimination involved.
The concept of equal treatment on the
logic of Article 14 of the Constitution of
India (in short 'the Constitution') cannot be
pressed into service in such cases. What
the
concept
of
equal
treatment
presupposes is existence of similar legal
foothold.
It does not countenance
repetition of a wrong action to bring both
wrongs on a par. Even if hypothetically it
is accepted that a wrong has been
committed in some other cases by
introducing a concept of negative equality
the respondents cannot strengthen their
case.'
Moreover, Article 14 has a positive
concept. Nobody can claim equality in
illegality.”
Similar observations were made by the Supreme Court in Ekta
Shakti Foundation Vs. Government of NCT Delhi (2006)
10 SCC 337 and State of U.P Vs. Raj Kumar Sharma
(2006) 3 SCC 330.

Consequently, and without going into this fact, I do

not find any merit in this petition. The same is dismissed.

Since

dismissed,

this

application does not survive and is disposed of as such.
