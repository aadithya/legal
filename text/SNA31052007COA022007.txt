The factual matrix of the case giving rise

to this appeal is as follows:

the

petitioner in the winding up petition. It had filed
a winding up petition and had sought winding up of
the respondent company under Sections 433(c) and
434 of the Companies Act, 1956 on the ground that
the said company was unable to pay its admitted
co.app.02-2007

Page 2 of 12

debt to the tune of Rs.20,16,455/- allegedly due as
on September, 1998. This petition was filed by the
respondent

The

thereafter filed an application (CA No. 275/2005 in
CP No. 236/2006) and prayed for setting aside of
the afore-mentioned ex-parte order passed against
it. The ex-parte winding up order was sought to be
set aside by the appellant company on the ground
that

it

was

not

with

the

notice

of

the

petition at its registered office and that it was
not aware about the pendency of winding up petition
against it. It was stated that the affidavit of

order, the application of the appellant for setting

We have heard the learned counsel for the

parties and have also perused the record.

The counsel for the appellant relying upon

Form 18 at Page 64 of the appeal paper book had
contended

that

no

attempt

was

made

by

the

respondent to serve the appellant with the notice
co.app.02-2007

Page 5 of 12

of winding up petition at its registered office by
registered post acknowledgment due before effecting
service on it by publication. It was contended that

whereas

admittedly the notices were not sent at the said
address

and,

therefore,

the

service

by

way

of

publication could not have been acted upon while
passing the ex-parte winding up orders against the
appellant company. On merits, the learned counsel
had

argued

that

Page 6 of 12

had urged that the appellant has suffered a serious
prejudice by the impugned order inasmuch as the
order of

winding up

had

been passed against it

without giving any opportunity of hearing to the
said

company.

As

The

the
and

learned

senior counsel had referred to the proceedings of
26.3.2003 in support of his contention relating to
service on the respondent effected in March, 2003.
The learned senior counsel had further argued that
in case the ex-parte winding up order is set aside
in the present appeal then the respondent would
suffer great injustice as the clock would be set
back to

the

start of

proceedings that began in

said ground.
6.

On giving our anxious consideration to the

above
counsel

rival
for

arguments
the

advanced

parties,

we

by

could

the
not

learned
persuade

ourselves to agree with the submissions made on
behalf of the respondent. A perusal of Form 18 at
Page 64 of the appeal paper book would show that
the appellant company had changed its registered
office at Paschim Vihar, New Delhi w.e.f 20.3.2001
and to Wadhwa Complex, Laxmi Nagar, Delhi w.e.f
11.7.2003. The winding up petition was filed on
16.4.2001. The orders for service by publication
was passed on 10.8.2004. The need for service by
publication arose as notices sent to the appellant
in

the

ordinary

course

and

by

registered

post

before that date were received back unserved with
the report 'Left'. The address of the appellant
given in the winding up petition at which notices
co.app.02-2007

Page 8 of 12

were sent was of Jhandewalan Extension and later
on,

on

the

request

of

the

respondent,

the

respondent was allowed to serve the appellant at
the following two addresses also pursuant to orders
dated 17.10.2003 and 19.12.2003:
1.

Skipper Beverages Pvt.Ltd.
3-75, KM, Hansi Hissar Road,

26.3.2003

A

(Page

perusal
53

of

of

the

the
paper

Page 9 of 12

book)

reveals

a

noting

by

the

Registry

in

the

proceedings of the said date to the effect that the
registered A.D envelop sent to the appellant for
26.3.2003

was

received

back

unserved

with

the

remarks of the postal authority 'Left'. In view of
this noting by the Registry, the order passed by
the Joint Registrar on 26.3.2003 declaring deemed
service

of

the

petition

on

the

appellant

was

against the record. In case appellant was served
for

26.3.2003,

as

contended

on

behalf

of

the

respondent, where was the need for passing fresh
service orders on subsequent dates particularly on
17.10.2003 and 19.12.2003 before allowing service
by publication. Furthermore, the order of deemed
service passed on 26.3.2003 was never acted upon
and, therefore, the said order even otherwise is of
no consequence. Rule 28 of the Companies (Court)
Rules, 1959 mandate for service of notice of the
petition on the company at its registered office by
co.app.02-2007

registered post acknowledgment due. It seems that
the ex-parte winding up order dated 14.2.2005 was
passed against the appellant company in disregard
of

the

mandatory

provision

relating

contained in Rule 28 referred above.

to

service

Needless to

say that the obligation of service on the opposite
party lies on the person who files the petition.
The respondent cannot be heard to say that more
than six years have passed since the filing of the
winding up petition because unless valid service is
effected

upon

the

opposite

party,

effective

proceedings cannot take place in the matter.

To

the credit of the appellant, we must say that the
appellant on our persuasion had agreed to deposit

In view of the above and having regard to

the circumstances of the case, we are of the view
that the order impugned in this appeal cannot stand
the test of judicial scrutiny and is, therefore,
set aside. The appeal is allowed subject to the
condition

of

appellant

depositing

50%

of

the

principal amount with the Registrar General of this
Court within four months from today.

No order as
