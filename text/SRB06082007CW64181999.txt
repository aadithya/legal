1.

This judgment will dispose of two petitions under Article 226 of the

Constitution of India. Both challenge the judgment and order of a learned
Additional District Judge (the appellate authority, hereafter called "ADJ"). In WP
6418/1999 (hereafter called "Sudhir's Petition" the order dated 8-9-1998 has been
assailed. The ADJ upheld an order of assessment made by the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi (hereafter "MCD"). In WP 6466/1999, ( "Indu Art's
petition") the order of ADJ dated 18-10-1999 has been challenged.

2.

The MCD's assessment order in Sudhir's petition was made, on 9-2-1996; it

was in respect of flat No. 38/504, Nehru Place, admeasuring 388 square feet. The
petitioner acquired it for a consideration of Rs. 3,20,000/-. Possession was handed
over on 3-5-1994. The notice of assessment was issued sometime in 1992; it was
to be effective from 1-4-1992. The petitioner filed objections on 29-4-1993. The
assessing officer decided the case on 9-2-1996. He assessed the property as
follows:
________________________________________________________

The petitioner appealed to the ADJ; the grounds urged were that the order

of assessment was actually served in April 1996 and therefore time barred.
Another contention was that the building was not complete till later and therefore,
it could not be assessed to tax. The third important ground raised was that the
notice issued for the year 1992-93 cannot be used to fix the rateable value for the
year 1993-94 and 1994-95 without issuance of fresh notice under Section 124/126
of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (hereafter "the Act"). A reading of
the impugned order would show that this was the only ground on which the appeal
was pressed before the ADJ.

4.

The ADJ, after noticing Section 126 of the Act, held that the provision

obliged that a property could not be assessed with effect from a date prior to the
commencement of the year in which a notice under Section 126(2) is issued. The
ADJ further went on to hold that there is nothing in Section 126 which debars the
assessing authority from making assessment of the property for the next year on
the basis of the said notice.
5.

In Indu Art's petition, the assessment was made by order dated 9-2-1994,

whereby rateable value was fixed at Rs. 24,200/- with effect from 7-2-1992, in
respect of flat No. 207, District Centre, Janak Puri. An earlier notice had been

W.P.(C) 6418/1999, W.P.(C) 6466/1999

3 of 8

issued, proposed to be effective for the period from 1-4-1990. The petitioner
claims to have got possession of the premises on 15-7-1992. The rateable value
was fixed with effect from 7-2-1992. Three contentions were raised before the
ADJ; one, that notice to the builder could not be construed as notice to the
assessee-purchaser; two, that in the absence of a notice with effect from 1-4-1991,
the notice for the earlier period could not be utilized to finalize the assessment and
three, the cost paid for the property was wrongly taken into consideration, to fix
the rateable value, contrary to judgments of the Supreme Court, which had
indicated the valid criteria. In this case, the ADJ accepted the last contention and
remitted the matter for consideration to the assessing authority.

6.

Learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the text of Section 126 of the

Act. He submitted that though the order ( in Sudhir's case) was ostensibly issued
on 9-2-1996, it was in reality despatched much later; it was received by the
assesssee in April 1996. Hence the assessment order itself was barred, having been
made beyond the period of limitation under the provision.

7.

Counsel next urged, in both Sudhir's case, as well as in Indu Art, that the

text of Section 126 negatived the findings of the ADJ, who fell into error in not

W.P.(C) 6418/1999, W.P.(C) 6466/1999

4 of 8

seeing that the obligation to make the assessment effective from a particular date,
constituted a fetter on the power, as well as a limitation on the operation of notice.
The notice being made effective from 1-4-1992 and 1-4-1990, could have been the
basis for

assessment with effect from any date of that assessment year,

but up to 31-3-1993 ( in Sudhir's case) and 31-3-1991 ( in Indu Art's case); once
those dates passed by, the notice could not have been the basis for issuance of an
assessment order for a later period. Counsel relied upon the decisions reported as
M.C.D.-vs- Dharma Properties & Anr 120 (2005) DLT 588 (DB); and Savitri
Devi v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi, 55 (1944) DLT 391 (DB).
8.

Learned counsel for the MCD submitted that the orders of the ADJ cannot

be faulted. She pointed out that the only issue urged in Sudhir's case was as to the
validity of notice; it was therefore, not open to the assessee to urge other grounds,
such as the non-receipt of notice, etc. As far as the petition in Indu Art was
concerned, it was contended that the impugned order is merely one of remand and
cannot be considered arbitrary or illegal.
9.

As far as the first two grounds urged in Sudhir's case is concerned, I am of

the opinion that they are entirely factual; the petitioner did not urge them in the
appeal. As a result, this court, in exercise of its jurisdiction, should refrain from
examination of those aspects, which are settled by factual findings.

10.

That takes me for a consideration of the common points which were urged,

and contended in these two petitions, namely whether a notice issued and effective
for one distinct period can be utilized for finalizing assessments for a later period.
The issue has now been decided by a decision of the Division Bench in Dharma
Properties & Anr (supra) in the following terms:
"33. The contention of the appellants about the notice being valid for a
future period, other than the one for which it is given cannot be accepted in
view of the Explanation to Section 126(4). It provides for only one situation
where the time period can be stretched, viz. where the assessment is held up
(after due service of notice) due to a stay order by a Court of law. That
covers only one eventuality, namely assessment proceedings. The fact that
the other periods have not been mentioned leads to the inference that the
delay in issuance of notice, or delays in other situations have been
intentionally left out, and the consequence of such imperatively framed time
periods being breached, result in invalidity of the action. The judgment of a
Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Superintendent of Taxes v.
Onkarmal Nathmal Trust, 1976 (1) SCC 766, rendered in the context of a
period of limitation prescribed in a taxing statute is an apt authority on the
point that such stipulations (as in Section 16) are not mere periods of
limitation; they also act as fetters on the jurisdiction of the taxing authority,
which is required to act within the limitation imposed by the statute. Our
view is also fortified by another Division Bench judgment in Prem Prashad
Juneja v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi, 1996 (2) AD (Delhi) 69. That
case was examined on the legality of the notice on the question of whether
sufficient reasons were given; it did not deal with the situation where the
notice itself transgressed the time-limit prescribed by law. Therefore, the
Court after holding that the notice was bereft of particulars, permitted a
supplementary notice, since not taking such a course would have meant a
tax holiday to the assessee. Implicit in such reasoning is the recognition of
the fact that the notice was validly served, but the action was curable, since
reasons in support of the notice could be issued later, through such
supplementary notice. Here, such a course would not be possible, since
initiating action is impressible in law.
34. We are also not persuaded to agree with the appellant that by virtue of
W.P.(C) 6418/1999, W.P.(C) 6466/1999

6 of 8

bye-laws the notice would itself result in a provisional assessment that
would be eventually finalised. By doing so, we would be injecting life to
something which is in fact a nullity, namely, a notice that is issued beyond
time- limit prescribed.
35. On the second issue, therefore, we hold that in the absence of any
notice for the periods commencing from 1.4.1998, the appellant cannot rely
upon the notice in question here, namely, issued on 25.3.1998 once the
same has been declared illegal and void. As a result, the assessments for
the period upto March, 2001 are also based upon no material and notice
and were rightly declared as illegal by the learned Additional District
Judge and affirmed by the learned Single Judge."

The ratio of the above decision is binding; it is to the effect that if a notice is
issued for amendment of an assessment list, it can relate back for the period
commencing from the beginning of the year of assessment. Its validity cannot be
stretched forward; in case the MCD is of the opinion that assessment cannot be
finalized, and rateable value fixed for that period, that notice cannot be used for
fixing rateable value for a subsequent period, in the absence of a notice. Its validity
cannot be deemed by fiction to subsist for a later period.
11.

These petitions, therefore, have to succeed in terms of the ratio in the above

case. The assessments in question therefore are hereby set aside. The petitions are
therefore allowed. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.
