PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
On 24.1.87, deceased died in a road accident

involving a scooter No.DEM-4984.
was uninsured.

The scooter in question

Dependants of the deceased filed a claim

petition under Section 92-A and 110-A, Motor Vehicles Act,
1939 before the Tribunal.
2.

The accident was caused when scooter in question

was hit by an unidentified truck.
FAO 421/2003

Unfortunately, there is
Page No.1 of 12

nothing on record to show the manner in which the accident
had taken place.
3.

Case of the claimants being before the Tribunal was

that respondent no.1, Lalit Kumar, was the owner of the
scooter and was driving the scooter and deceased was the
pillion rider at the time of accident and that accident was
caused due to rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1.
4.

Respondent no. 1 denied the allegations made by

the claimants and contended that deceased was driving the
scooter and he was the pillion rider at the time of the accident
and accident was caused by an unknown truck. He also
denied being owner of scooter no. DEM-4984.
5.

Later on, respondent no.2, Sudhir Dutta, was

impleaded as a party on the allegation that he was the owner
of the scooter.
6.

In his defence, respondent no.2 stated that he was

not the owner of the scooter in question, as on 23.9.86 he
had sold the same to respondent no.1.

He stated that

thought sale letter and delivery letter relating to scooter were
duly executed, same are untraceable.

He admitted that

registration certificate of the scooter stands in his name but

FAO 421/2003

Page No.2 of 12

submitted that at the time of sale, respondent no.1 had
undertaken to get the registration transferred in his name,
but failed to do so. He contended that he should not be made
liable for the default committed by the respondent no.1.
7.

Vide order dated 29.11.1999, on pleadings of

parties, following issues were framed:“i)
Whether respondent no.1 was
driving the two wheeler scooter no. DEM-4984
and the deceased Sunil Kumar Gaur was the
pillion rider when the accident in question
took place?
ii)
If issue no. 1 is affirmed in
affirmative, whether deceased Sunil Kumar
died in this accident due to rash and negligent
driving on part of respondent no.1 of this
scooter?
iii)
Whether the accident was caused by
an unknown truck as alleged by respondent
no.1?
iv)
Whether the petitioners are entitled
to any compensation? If so, to what amount
and from whom?
8.

v)
Relief.”
For the first time in the written submissions

submitted by claimants, it was prayed that claim petition be
converted to one under Section 163-A, Motor Vehicles Act,
1988 and compensation as per Section 163-A be awarded to
them. The said prayer was rejected by the Tribunal.

In support of their case, claimants examined PW-1

Smt.Sneh Lata, wife of the deceased, PW-2 Smt. Shyam
Kumari Gaur, mother of the deceased, PW-3 Sh.K.S.Gaur,
father of the deceased, PW-4 Rajesh Kumar, brother- in- law
of the deceased and PW-5 R.S.Gill, Law Officer, Metal
Forgings Pvt. Ltd.

Respondent No.1 besides examining

himself as R1W4, examined R1W1 Constable Subhash, R1W2
S. Mahto, Medical Record Technician, R.M.L. Hospital and
R1W3 Constable Sanjay Kumar.

Respondent No.2 only

examined himself as R2W1.
10.

Considering testimony of witnesses and other

evidence on record, Tribunal held that claimants had failed to
establish that respondent no.1 was driving the scooter DEM4984 and deceased was pillion rider at the time of accident
and that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent
driving by respondent no.1.
11.

Tribunal further noted that on basis of evidence on

record, respondent no. 2 continued to be the owner of the
scooter as his name admittedly continued in the records of
RTO as owner, thus he was held liable to third party i.e.
claimants and was directed to pay Rs.15,000/- to claimants

FAO 421/2003

Page No.4 of 12

on the basis of no fault liability.
12.

Aggrieved by the award, claimants have filed the

present appeal seeking enhancement of the compensation.
Prayer made in the appeal is that respondents be directed to
pay to the claimants a compensation of Rs.3,00,000/- on the
principle of 'Fault Liability'.
13.

Thus in order to succeed in the appeal, it is

necessary for the claimants to establish that respondent no.1
was driving the scooter and deceased was the pillion rider at
the time of the accident and that the accident was caused
due to rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1.
14.

In support of aforesaid contention, counsel for the

claimants relied upon testimony of PW-1, wife of deceased
and PW-4, brother-in-law of deceased.
15.

Relevant part of PW1's testimony relied upon by

claimants as under:

16.

“On 24.1.87, my husband had left with R-1 from our
residence in the evening on his two-wheeler
scooter.”
Relevant part of PW-4's testimony reads as under:
“On 24.1.87, I had to go Bahadur Garh with Sunil
Kumar (deceased) and Lalit Kumar (R-1). I met them
at Peera Garhi Chowk. Lalit Kumar was driving a twowheeler scooter and Sunil Kumar was pillion rider.”

FAO 421/2003

Page No.5 of 12

17.

Counsel for the claimants submits that as PW-1 and

PW-4 had testified to the fact that on the day of accident,
they had seen that respondent no. 1 was driving the scooter
and deceased was the pillion rider. Therefore, the Tribunal
should have drawn an inference that Respondent no. 1 was
driving the scooter and deceased was the pillion rider at the
time of the accident.
18.

As regards PW-4 testimony, it is noted that in the

later part of his testimony, PW-4 deposed as under:
“Q: I put it to you that on day of accident Sunil Kumar
(deceased) was driving the scooter and Lalit Kumar
(Respondent no. 1) was the pillion rider?
A: I did not see myself.”
19.

PW-4 contradicted himself when he deposed that he

did not see who was driving the scooter on day of the
accident while earlier he had deposed that on day of accident
he had seen respondent no. 1 driving the scooter and
deceased was the pillion rider.
20.

As

he

has

made

contradictory

statements,

statement of PW-4 that on day of accident he saw respondent
no.1 driving the scooter and deceased was the pillion rider
cannot be believed.

FAO 421/2003

Page No.6 of 12

21.

But, testimony of PW-1 that on evening of accident,

she saw deceased leaving with respondent no. 1 on his twowheeler scooter is relevant.
22.

In his defense, respondent no. 2 stated that on

23.1.86, he had sold the offending two-wheeler scooter to
respondent no. 1.
23.

The testimony of PW-1 that on evening of accident,

she saw deceased leaving with respondent no. 1 on his twowheeler scooter and stand of respondent no. 2 that he sold
the two-wheeler scooter to respondent no.1 leads to an
inference that at the time of accident, respondent no. 1 was
driving the scooter and deceased was the pillion rider.
24.

I, accordingly hold that the evidence on record, if

not establishes, at least probabilizes that at the time of
accident, Respondent no. 1 was driving the scooter and
deceased was the pillion rider.
25.

This is not a criminal trial. Standard of proof to be

applied is of preponderance of probabilities.
26.

But to succeed in the appeal, claimants are further

required to prove that accident was caused due to rash or
negligent driving by respondent no. 1.

FAO 421/2003

Page No.7 of 12

27.

As regards the allegation pertaining to rash or

negligent driving by respondent no. 1, in the rejoinder filed by
the claimants before the Tribunal, it was stated:
“The petitioners have verified the entire instance
from the labourers who were having the temporary
residence at the work site and who had actually seen
the accident.”
28.

But, in testimony of PW-1, no reference has been

made to the fact that factum of the accident was verified
from the labourers. In fact, she stated in her testimony:

29.

“I do not know as to what was the destination where
my husband and Lalit Kumar were going and for
which place. Some police officials came to me on
day of accident and informed me about the same at
about 11.30 night. I did not come to know if any
other vehicle was involved in above accident or not.
Similarly I never came to know what was the speed
of scooter on which my husband was there at time of
accident. It is correct that I do not know about the
manner in which accident had taken place.”
A perusal of the records of the tribunal shows that

no witness was produced by the claimants before the Tribunal
to depose as to how the accident took place. There is not
even an iota of evidence on record to show that accident was
caused due to rash or negligent driving by Respondent no. 1.
30.

In the light of the evidence on record, I agree with

the decision of the tribunal that claimants had failed to
establish that accident was caused due to rash or negligent
FAO 421/2003

Page No.8 of 12

driving by Respondent no. 1.
31.

As

claimants

failed

to

establish

the

fault

of

respondent No.1 in causing the accident in question, no case
is made for enhancing compensation on basis of fault liability
as prayed for in the appeal.
32.

Another ground advanced by the claimants is that

Tribunal was wrong in rejecting prayer of claimants that
petition be converted to one under Section 163-A, Motor
Vehicles Act 1988.
33.

It is noted that claim petition was originally filed

under Section 92-A and Section 110-A, Motor Vehicles Act
1939.

Later, in the summary of pleadings, evidence and

submissions submitted before the Tribunal, it was prayed that
petition be converted to one under Section 163-A, Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 and compensation be awarded as per
Section 163-A, Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
34.

Section 92-A, Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 relates to

compensation in case of no fault liability while Section 163-A,
Motor vehicles Act, 1988 relates to compensation in case of
hit and run motor accidents.
35.

Tribunal rejected the prayer of the claimants and

FAO 421/2003

Page No.9 of 12

awarded the compensation to the claimants as per Section
92-A, Motor Vehicles Act, 1939.
36.

The prayer of the claimants for conversion of claim

petition was to be refused for the simple reason that the
provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 had no applicability
to the case of the claimants.
37.

In the decision reported as Maitri Koley & Anr. v New

India Assurance Co. & Anr.,(2003) 8 SCC 718, the question
before the Supreme Court was whether the claim petition was
governed by Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 or Motor Vehicles Act,
1988.
38.

In the

aforesaid case, accident in question took

place on 1.4.1986. Appellants had challenged quantum of
compensation awarded by the Tribunal. On behalf of the
appellants, it was contended that the Tribunal had applied a
wrong multiplier. It was submitted that on the date the
Tribunal gave the award the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 had
already come into force. It was submitted that schedule for
payment of compensation should have been applied.
39.

Supreme Court rejected the aforesaid contention

raised by the appellants and observed in para 4 of the

FAO 421/2003

Page No.10 of 12

judgment as under:

40.

“ It has been held by this Court in the case of
Padma Srinivasan v Premier Insurance Co. Ltd., AIR
1982 SC 836 that the law prevailing on the date of
the accident has to apply. On the date of the
accident the 1988 Act had not come into force.
Under the old Act there was no schedule. Thus the
multipliers then being applied were on the basis of
ratio laid down by this court in various cases. It
could not be said that the multiplier of 14, which
was applied, was unreasonable.”
Again, in the decision reported as United India

Insurance Co. Ltd., Shimla v Tilak Singh & Ors., AIR 2006 C
1576, Supreme Court reiterated that it is the accident which
furnishes the cause of action for application before the
Tribunal.
41. In the appeal before me, accident in question took place
on 24.1.87 i.e. before Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 came into
force. There is no provision in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939
corresponding to Section 163-A, Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
42.

I find no infirmity in the Tribunal's decision in

rejecting the prayer of the claimants that claim petition be
converted from Section 92-A, Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 to
Section 163-A, Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
43.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

44.

No Costs.
