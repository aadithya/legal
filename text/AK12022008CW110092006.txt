CM No.15083/2006 in W.P(C) No.11009/2006

1.

The respondent/workman has filed this application under

Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 read with section
151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 seeking a direction to the
petitioner to pay to the respondent/workman full wages.
2.

The respondent/applicant contended that the impugned award

directing his reinstatement was passed on 11th July, 2005 and that
CM no.15083/2006
in W.P(C) No.11009/2006

he has not been employed in any establishment since the date of
illegal termination of his services. The applicant pleaded that he has
no other source of livelihood. The respondent also stated that his last
drawn salary was Rs.4,602/-.
3.

A reply to the application of the respondent under section 17 B

of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 has been filed on behalf of
petitioner/non-applicant wherein the petitioner contended that the
impugned award is contrary to law as the employment of the
respondent was temporary in nature and same came to an end on the
expiry of the fixed term of appointment as contained in the
appointment letter and that the same is not retrenchment and
therefore, the petitioner is not entitled for reinstatement nor for
payment of retrenchment compensation. The petitioner has further
denied the factum of unemployment of the respondent stating that he
has been gainfully employed, however, no particulars of gainful
employment the respondent have been given.
4.

Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 comes into

operation when an Award directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in further proceedings by the employer. Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act is as under:"17-B. Payment of full wages to workman pending proceedings in
Higher Courts. - Where in any case a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal by its award directs reinstatement of any workman and
CM no.15083/2006
in W.P(C) No.11009/2006

Page 2 of 6

the employer prefers any proceedings against such award in a High
Court or the Supreme Court, the employer shall be liable to pay such
workman, during the period of pendency of such proceedings in the
High Court or the Supreme Court, full wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance admissible to him under any rule if
the workman had not been employed in any establishment during such
period and an affidavit by such workman had been filed to that effect
in such court :
Provided that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the High Court
or the Supreme Court that such workman had been employed and had
been receiving adequate remuneration during any such period or part
thereof, the Court shall order that no wages hall be payable under this
section for such period or part, as the case may be."
Thus a workman would be entitled for relief under Section 17B
of the Industrial Disputes Act, if there is an award directing reinstatement of the workman and the employer has preferred proceedings
against such award at the High Court or Supreme Court and that the
workman had not been employed in any establishment during the period of pendency of such proceedings and an affidavit to that effect
has been filed by the workman. On satisfaction of the requisites as
laid down under section 17B, the court is bound to grant relief to the
workman in terms of the provision as laid down under section 17B of
the Industrial Disputes Act. The Court cannot go into the merits of
the case/writ petition while deciding an application under section 17B
of the Act as was held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413,
Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.
5.

The preliminary consideration for making available such a relief

CM no.15083/2006
in W.P(C) No.11009/2006

Page 3 of 6

under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 to a workman
is to be found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment, the spirit,
intendment and object underlying which is to mitigate and relieve, to
a certain extent, the hardship which would be caused to a workman
due

to

delay

in

the

implementation

of

an

award

directing

reinstatement of his services on account of the challenge made to it by
the employer. Section 17B Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 recognizes a
workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body and soul
together when a challenge has been made to an Award directing his
reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no inherent right of
assailing an order or an award by an industrial adjudicator by way of
an appeal. The payment which is required to be made by the employer
to the workman has been held to be akin to a subsistence allowance
which is neither refundable nor recoverable from a workman even if
the Award in his favor is set aside by the High Court. In 1999 (2) SCC
106 (Para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex Court was
of the view that the object under Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the hardship
that is caused to the workman due to the delay in implementation of
the Award.
6.

Granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing orders

directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule; refusing
to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the relief could

in W.P(C) No.11009/2006

Page 4 of 6

be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional error
where there is no relationship of employer and employee between the
parties.
7.

In the present case the workman has categorically averred that

an award dated 11th July, 2005 directing his reinstatement was
passed by the Labor Court which has been challenged by the
petitioner and that he has not been gainfully employed in any
establishment since the date of termination of his services and has
also filed an affidavit deposing the same. Apart from bald denial of
this fact nothing has been placed on record by the petitioner to negate
the plea of unemployment of the respondent. Also whether the award
has been passed in accordance with law and whether the respondent
is not entitled for reinstatement is to be adjudicated at the time of
final disposal of the writ petition. These questions cannot be gone into
at the stage of deciding the application under section 17B of the Act.
The Court while deciding an application under Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 can only consider whether the
requirements mentioned therein have been satisfied and if the
requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are
satisfied, no order can be passed denying the workman the benefit of
statutory provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947.

8.

In the facts and circumstances, the applicant fulfills the

requisites for availing the benefit under section 17B of the Act.
Consequently, the application of the respondent is allowed.

The

petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or minimum wages
whichever is higher from the date of the award, i.e., 11th July, 2005.
Arrears of last drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher
be paid within four weeks. The petitioner shall continue to pay last
drawn wages or minimum wages to the respondent by the 10th of
every calendar month. The respondent is also directed to file an
undertaking that in case this writ petition is allowed, the respondent
shall return/refund the difference of last drawn wages and minimum
wages within such time as will be permitted by this Court. The
undertaking be filed within four weeks.
With these directions, the application is disposed of.
