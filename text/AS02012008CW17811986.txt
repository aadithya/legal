In Ram Chand and others v. Union of India – (1994)

1 SCC 44, one of the grounds on which the validity of the land
acquisition proceedings was challenged by the land owners was
that the said proceedings had not been completed within a
reasonable period. The Court examined the explanation offered
by the authorities for the delay in the completion of the

WP(C) 1781/1986

page 1 of 5

proceedings and came to the conclusion that the same was not
acceptable. There was, in the opinion of the Court, no cogent
explanation for the non-completion of the proceedings even
after the pronouncement of the judgment of the Supreme Court
in Aflatoon v. Union of India - AIR 1974 SC 2077 . Having
said so, the Court upheld the acquisition proceedings while
protecting interest of the land owners by directing that they
shall be paid an additional amount of compensation @12% p.a.
from the date of expiry of two years reckoned from 23rd August,
1974 till the date of the making of the awards by the Collector.
The Court observed :
“According to us, after the judgment of
this Court in Aflatoon case on August
23, 1974, the reasonable time for
making the awards was about two
years from that date.
Beyond two
years, the time taken for making of the
awards will be deemed to be
unreasonable. As such, after expiry of
the period of two years, some
additional compensation has to be
awarded to the cultivators. Taking into
consideration the interest of the
cultivators and the public, instead of
quashing
the
proceedings
for
acquisition,
we
direct
that
the
petitioners shall be paid an additional
amount
of
compensation
to
be
calculated at the rate of twelve per
cent per annum, after expiry of two
years from August 23, 1974, the date of
the judgment of this court in Aflatoon
case till the date of the making of the
WP(C) 1781/1986

page 2 of 5

awards by the Collector, to be
calculated with reference to the market
value of the lands in question on the
date of the notifications under subsection (1) of Section 4.”
2.

Relying upon the above decision, the Supreme Court, in

Murari and others v. Union of India and others – (1997) 1
SCC 15, granted a similar relief to the petitioners and observed:
“After overall consideration of
the issues involved in these transfer
cases and the appeals we find no
ground to take a different view than
the one taken by the High Court in the
impugned judgment.
Consequently,
the acquisition proceedings could not
be quashed on any grounds. We also
find ourselves in respectful agreement
with the view taken by this Court in the
case of Ram Chand. Consequently, the
appeals fail and are hereby dismissed.
The transfer cases are allowed in terms
of the order made in the case of Ram
Chand directing that the transfer
petitioners and the appellants shall be
paid
an
additional
amount
of
compensation to be calculated at the
rate of 12 per cent per annum, after
the expiry of two years from the date of
decision
of
Aflatoon
case
i.e.,
23.8.1974 till the date of making of the
awards by the Collector, to be
calculated with reference to the
market value of the land in question on
the date of notification under Section
4(1) of the Act.
In the facts and
circumstances of the case we make no
order as to costs.”

In the case at hand, the acquisition proceedings were

WP(C) 1781/1986

page 3 of 5

initiated in the year 1965 by a preliminary notification dated
6.3.1965 followed by a declaration under Section 6 of the Land
Acquisition Act dated 7.1.1969. An award followed but only on
19.9.1986 i.e. nearly 16 years later.

The proceedings in the

present petition are as in the cases mentioned above challenged
on the ground of unreasonable delay in the completion of the
same.

A similar challenge in respect of the very same

notifications and land in the very same village was examined by
a Division Bench of this Court comprising Swatanter Kumar and
Madan B. Lokur, JJ. in Balwant & Ors. v. Union of India and

others – 119 (2005) DLT 458.

Relying upon the decisions of

the Supreme Court in Murari and others (supra) and the Full
Bench of this Court in Roshanara Begum v. Union of India &

Ors. - 61 (1996) DLT 206, the Court disposed of the petition
with the direction that the owners shall be entitled to the same
relief as was granted to the owners in Murari's (supra) case.
There is, in our opinion, no reason for us much less a cogent one
to strike a discordant note.

In fairness to counsel for the

petitioner, we must mention that even he limited his prayer in
the petition to the disposal of the petition on the lines of Ram

Chand and Murari's cases (Supra) disposed of by the Supreme
Court and in Balwant & Ors.(supra) disposed of by this Court.

4.

In the circumstances, therefore, while rejecting the

petitioner's challenge to the acquisition proceedings, we direct
that the petitioner shall be entitled to compensation at the rate
of 12 per cent per annum on the amount of compensation
representing the market value of the land as on the date of
notification under Section 4 on the analogy of the decision in the

Murari's (supra) case. No cost.
