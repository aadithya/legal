PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

I do not intend to catalog the various decisions

under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955. It would be
sufficient for me to note the judicial principles required to be
applied while deciding an application under Section 24 of the
Hindu Marriage Act 1955.
2.

Since the Section relates to entitlement of the

CM(M) No.40/2005

Page 1 of 9

appellant spouse to receive interim maintenance from the nonapplicant spouse, it is obvious that the focus of enquiry has to
be the means of the applicant spouse to maintain him/her self
as also the financial means of the non-applicant spouse. The
issue of conduct or misconduct of either spouse is irrelevant for
the reason, in every proceedings for divorce, dissolution or
judicial separation, there is bound to be some allegations or the
other pertaining to matrimonial misconduct. Thus, if conduct
or misconduct were to be considered, no spouse would get any
interim maintenance under Section 24.
3.

The Section contemplates a summary enquiry and

not a trial at length.
4.

Right to maintenance is an incident of the status

from an estate of matrimony.

Interim maintenance has an

element of alimony, which expression in its strict sense means
allowance due to wife from husband on separation. It has its
basis in social conditions in United Kingdoms under which a
married woman was economically dependent and almost in a
position of tutelage to the husband and was intended to secure
justice to her.
5.

Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act goes a step

further inasmuch as it permits maintenance to be claimed by
CM(M) No.40/2005

Page 2 of 9

the husband even against the wife.
6.

While considering a claim for interim maintenance,

the court has to keep in mind the status of the parties,
reasonable wants of the applicant, the income and property of
the applicant. Conversely, requirements of the non applicant,
the income and property of the non applicant and additionally
the other family members to be maintained by the non
applicant have to be taken into all.

Whilst it is important to

insure that the maintenance awarded to the applicant is
sufficient to enable the applicant to live in somewhat the same
degree of comfort as in the matrimonial home, but it should not
be so exorbitant that the non applicant is unable to pay.
7.

Maintenance awarded cannot be punitive. It should

aid the applicant to live in a similar life style she/he enjoyed in
the matrimonial home. It should not expose the non applicant
to unjust contempt or other coercive proceedings. On the other
hand, maintenance should not be so low so as to make the
order meaningless.
8.

Unfortunately, in India, parties do not truthfully

reveal their income.

For self employed persons or persons

employed in the unorganized sector, truthful income never
surfaces. Tax avoidance is the norm. Tax compliance is the
CM(M) No.40/2005

Page 3 of 9

exception in this country.

Therefore, in determining interim

maintenance, there cannot be mathematical exactitude. The
court has to take a general view.

From the various judicial

precedents, the under noted 11 factors can be culled out,
which are to be taken into consideration while deciding an
application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The
same are:
“1.

Status of the parties.

2.

Reasonable wants of the claimant.

3.
The independent income and property of
the claimant.
4.
The number of persons, the non applicant
has to maintain.
5.
The amount should aid the applicant to
live in a similar life style as he/she enjoyed in
the matrimonial home.
6.

Non-applicant's liabilities, if any.

7.
Provisions for food, clothing, shelter,
education, medical attendance and treatment
etc. of the applicant.
8.

Payment capacity of the non applicant.

9.
Some guess work is not ruled out while
estimating the income of the non applicant
when all the sources or correct sources are not
disclosed.
10. The non applicant to defray the cost of
litigation.
CM(M) No.40/2005

11. The amount awarded u/s. 125 Cr.PC is
adjustable against the amount awarded u/s. 24
of the Act.”
With the backdrop facts aforesaid validity of the

9.

impugned order dated 13.5.2004 has to be decided.
10.

The

non-applicant

Smt.Saroj

Hegde

sought

dissolution of her marriage on grounds of cruelty and desertion.
She filed a an application under Section 24 of the Hindu
Marriage Act praying that she should be awarded a reasonable
interim maintenance from her husband.

She stated that she

was unemployed.
11.

In support of her claim, she pleaded that her

husband was the son of Shri Rama Krishna Hegde, Ex Chief
Minister of the State of Karnataka. She stated that he was an
industrialist operating a unit at Peeneya Industrial Estate,
Stage-II, Bangalore wherefrom he was earning at least Rs.10
lacs per month. She further stated that the husband was a coowner in the following properties:1. Property No.229, Raj Mahal Vilas Extension, Bangalore
valued Rs.6 crores.
2. Fionika Building, Walkeshwar Road, 12th Floor, Bombay
valued Rs.4 crores.
3. Ancestral property at Sidapur, Mytri valued Rs.1 crore.
4. Peeneya Industrial Estate, II Stage, Bangalore valued
CM(M) No.40/2005

Page 5 of 9

Rs.50 lakhs.
5. Flat at Ferozshah Road, New Delhi valued Rs.2 crores.
6. Coffee Gardens at Coorg, Karnataka valued Rs.10 crores.
7. 40 acres of agricultural farm land near Jai Nagar valued
Rs.5 crores.
12.
Averments in respect of the immovable properties
owned by the husband are in para 7 of the application filed by
the wife under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The same
read as under:PROPERTIES

Response of the husband to the averments made in

para 7 are as under:“7. The respondent respectfully submits that, the
respondent is unemployed and he has no source of
income and that he is totally dependent on his
parents.”
14.

It may be noted at the outset that the husband has

CM(M) No.40/2005

Page 6 of 9

not denied the assertion that he is the owner of the properties
disclosed in para 7 of the application filed by the wife under
Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.
15.

By and under the impugned order, Rs.25,000/- per

month has been awarded to the wife besides litigation
expenses in sum of Rs.25,000/-.
16.

Shri K.N.Bhatt, learned senior counsel for the

petitioner urged that while awarding maintenance to the
respondent, learned Judge had to consider only the revenue
income of the husband. Consideration of capital assets may be
relevant in a claim for permanent alimony, urged the counsel.
It is wholly irrelevant for purposes of deciding a claim under
Section 24, submitted the learned senior counsel.
17.

I do not agree.

18.

If the capital asset is an industrial property, a coffee

plantation, an orchard or any other agricultural holding, there
would be a presumption that the said capital asset is yielding
some income. It is not presumed to be a dead asset.
19.

As noted herein above, unfortunately, nobody pays

proper taxes to the Government.
seldom disclose their true income.

society litigate it can always be used by a Judge to broadly
ascertain as to what is going on in the society. By no means,
said knowledge can be used where law requires a fact to be
conclusively proved.

But where the law requires a Judge to

form an opinion based on a host of primary data, a Judge can
formulate an opinion pertaining to the likely income from the
capital assets of the husband.
20.

The matter can be viewed differently.

21.

It is not the case of the husband that he has

abandoned his capital assets. It is not his case that he is not
residing in Raj Mahal Vilas Extension, Bangalore.
22.

How is he maintaining the said properties?

23.

The husband has disclosed nothing about the

salaries paid to the various employees, servants and others
employed at the various capital assets owned/co-owned by the
husband.
24.

It is a well recognized principle of law that where a

person withholds vital information, a presumption arises
against him that had he disclosed the information, the same
would have been adverse to him.
25.

Keeping in view the capital assets owned/co-owned

by the husband, his social status, his place of residence, it is
CM(M) No.40/2005

Page 8 of 9

difficult to believe that the husband does not have the requisite
means

to

support

his

wife

a

monthly

maintenance

of

Rs.25,000/-.
26.

As regards the wife, there is no proof of she having

any income.
27.

Order sheets of the present case show numerous

attempts made to effect a reconciliation or separation on
amicable terms. Unfortunately, the attempts have failed.
28.

I find no merit in the petition.

29.

Dismissed.

30.

The husband is directed to pay costs of the present

litigation before this Court to the wife quantified at Rs.25,000/-.
31.

No costs.
