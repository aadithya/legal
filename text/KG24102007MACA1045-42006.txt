KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
By way of this present appeal the appellant seeks enhancement
in the compensation amount only on the limited ground that the
Tribunal has not considered the increase in the minimum wages for
determining the amount of compensation towards the loss of

dependency.
The background of facts in nutshell are as follows:
On 30.12.1994 at about 8.00 p.m. Shri Nuju aged 30 years was
paddling goods rickshaw and was proceeding towards Raghubir
Nagar, inthe meantime on reaching near peeragarhi at rohtak Road a
truck model TATA-407, bearing registeration No. DBL-3459, being
driven by its driver, respondent No. 1 herein, Shri Mukesh Kumar, in
a very rash and negligent manner came from Peeragarhi side and
colided with the goods rickshaw of Shri Nuju. As a result Shri Nuju
succumbed to his injuries. Claim petition was filed before Motor
Accident Claims Tribunal and Award in a sum of Rs. 2,35,000/- was
passed on 7.9.2006. Aggrieved with the said award present appeal is
preferred by the Appellant.
Counsel for the appellant contends that the Tribunal has
considered the minimum wages index as payable to unskilled person
in the year 1994 at Rs. 1420/-, but the increase in wages as per the
Minimum Wages Act has been ignored. Counsel for the appellant has
placed reliance on the judgment of this Court reported in 2007 ACJ
2165 Lekh Raj and Anr. vs Suram Singh and Ors. where this

Court has taken into consideration the factor of increase in the
minimum wages for determining the amount of compensation
towards the loss of dependency. In the present case, the deceased was
30 years of age at the time of the accident and a multiplier of 18 has
been made applicable to the multiplicand to calculate the
compensation.
Per contra learned counsel for the respondent states that
already the Tribunal has applied the multiplier on the higher side and
the correct multiplier as laid down in Schedule II of the Motor
Vehicles Act, as per the age of the deceased, is 17 years. The counsel
also contends that the Tribunal has already awarded quite fair
compensation to the appellant. The same need not be enhanced any
further to give extra benefit to the claimant.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and I have perused
the records. The Tribunal has taken the help of Minimum Wages Act
for fixation of the income of the deceased at Rs. 1420/-. This was
done by the Tribunal as no cogent evidence was led by the appellant
to prove the income of the deceased, who was stated to be working as
cart puller with some TV shop. The increase in the minimum wages

as is fixed from time to time by the Government cannot be treated at
par or akin with the future prospects. The increase in the Minimum
Wages Act takes place primarily due to the price index, which is
eventually based on the inflation and devaluation of the currency and
other economic factors. I, therefore, find myself in agreement with
the contention of the counsel for the appellant that in such cases
where in the absence of any cogent evidence resort is made to the
Minimum Wages Act, then, at least the revision also, as made in the
Minimum Wages Act, can be taken into consideration. Taking note of
the said multiplier of the 18 the Minimum Wages as applicable on the
date of decision in the present case as per the Minimum Wages Act is
Rs. 3312/- and taking a mean of both the wages the annual income of
the deceased would come to Rs. 2366/- and after deducting 1/3 rd
expenses towards personal maintenance and pleasure, the loss of
dependency would be Rs. Rs. 1577/- p.m.
The annual dependence of the appellants thus would be Rs.
18924/-, hence total compensation after applying the said multiplier
of 18 would be Rs. 3,40,632/-. The Tribunal in the present case had
awarded a sum of Rs. 2,35,000/- towards the entire compensation

amount, which includes a sum of Rs. 2,04,480/- towards the loss of
dependency. The Award of the Tribunal is thus modified and
enhanced from Rs. 2,04,480/- to Rs. 3,40,632/- towards the loss of
dependency. While compensation as granted under other heads by
the Tribunal shall remain the same. The appellants shall now be
entitled to the differential of the compensation amount with interest
@ 6% per annum w.e.f. 24th July, 2001, which date the Tribunal has
taken into consideration for awarding the interest. The present
appeal is remitted back to the Tribunal to pass necessary directions
for apportionment of the Award amongst the appellants so far as
enhanced amount of the compensation is concerned. With these
directions the present appeal is disposed of.
