JUDGMENT
:Dr. S.Muralidhar, J.

1.

These

two

writ

petitions

involve

common

question

and,

therefore, are being disposed of by this common judgment.

2.

Shri

Dharampal

Sharma,

the

petitioner

in

W.P.(C)

No.

13427/2006 states that he has been running a water cooling plant in
the Mehrauli area in his own plot No. 248, Ward No.6 since 1988. He
divided the businesses on the plot:

An ice-cream factory on Plot

248/5B was given to his son late Shri Deepak Kumar Sharma which is
W.P.(C) 13427/2006

1 of 10

now being run by his widow Smt. Simmi Sharma, the petitioner in the
companion W.P.(C) No. 13461/2006.

The water cooling plant

continued to be run by the petitioner Shri Dharampal Sharma on plot
No. 248/5A. It is claimed that both units are permissible household
activities and non-polluting and non-hazardous in nature.

3.

The petitions further state that when the Municipal Corporation

of Delhi ('MCD') commenced a scheme in 1990 for registration of such
units, the petitioner applied and obtained a trade licence on 1.2.1995.
The petitioner states that the trade licence fee was paid for the period
1.4.1990 onwards. It is claimed that the trade licence was regularly
renewed by the MCD in terms of the ad hoc registration policy of
1990 and Resolution No. 560 dated 15.3.2000.

4.

The petitioners state that from 2003 onwards, the MCD kept

issuing various notices compelling the units to shut down.

These

notices were challenged by the petitioners in this Court in various writ
petitions each of which came to be allowed. It is stated that by an
order dated 30.1.2006 in WP(C) No. 14187/2006 this Court referred
to the orders passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta

vs. Union

of India (2004) 5 SCALE 405, and directed that the

Commissioner, MCD to refer the issue of the renewal of petitioners'
licences to the Monitoring Committee constituted in terms of
Direction no. 8 in para 17 of that judgment.

The Monitoring

Committee was asked to take a decision whether a water colling plant
and an ice-cream factory are permissible activities from residential
areas.

5.

Pursuant to the directions issued by this Court on 30.1.2006, the

petitioners' applications for renewal were referred to the Monitoring
W.P.(C) 13427/2006

2 of 10

Committee.

In its 11th meeting on 22.6.2006, the Monitoring

Committee considered the issue and concluded that only those icecream factories and water cooling plants that have come up in
residential/non-conforming areas in Delhi on or after 1.8.1990 shall be
closed. Consequent upon the decision of the Monitoring Committee, a
show cause notice was issued to the petitioners by the MCD which
was replied to by them on 31.7.2006. By an order dated 5.8.2006,
petitioners were informed by the MCD that the replies given by them
were not satisfactory and they were directed to forthwith stop
operations.

By a further communication dated 7.8.2006, the

petitioners were informed that the ad hoc registration granted to their
respective units, stood cancelled. The units were sealed by an order
dated 21.8.2006.

6.

Challenging the above decision of the Monitoring Committee

and the consequential orders dated 5.8.2006, 7.8.2006 and 21.8.2006
of the MCD, the petitioners filed the present writ petitions. A further
prayer is for a direction to the MCD to either direct the Monitoring
Committee to reconsider the issue and consequently direct the MCD
to renew petitioner's licence or, in the alternative, direct the MCD to
allot to each of the petitioners

a similar plot in a conforming area

after giving them time to shift. By an interim order dated 28.8.2006,
this Court directed the de-sealing of the premises subject to the
petitioners filing undertakings not to commence business activities
therein.

7.

In each of the petitions it is claimed that the unit has been

running since 1988 i.e. before the deadline of 1.8.1990 set by the
Monitoring Committee, and therefore the water cooling plant and the
ice-cream factory should be permitted to continue functioning in
W.P.(C) 13427/2006

3 of 10

terms of the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

8.

In the reply filed by the MCD, it is pointed out that in the

application filed by the petitioners for renewal of registration, it was
indicated by the petitioner himself here that the water cooling plant
and the ice-cream factory were established in 1991. Acting on this
statement, respondents cancelled registration of the plant in favour of
the petitioner no.1 by an order dated 7.8.2006. On the undertaking of
the petitioner Shri Dharampal Sharma that he would not commece
business activities in the form of the ice cream factory and the water
cooling plant, they were desealed on 1.9.2006. It is pointed out that
the ice cream factory and water cooling plant are operating in a
residential/non-conforming areas;

that such business activities are

not included in list A or A1, and, therefore, were impermissible under
the Master Plan for Delhi ('MPD').

9.

Appearing for the petitioner, Mr. Sanjay Parikh, Advocate

submits that the units have been functioning since 1988; that they had
already obtained trade licences and, therefore, the protection granted
by

the

Hon'ble

Supreme

Court

to

the

pre

-

1.8.1990

licensees/registrants, should be available to these petitioners as well.
Without prejudice to these contentions, it is stated that Monitoring
Committee erred in observing that the activity was commercial. It is
maintained that these are, in fact, household industries and should
have been treated as such.

Mr. Parikh criticized the logic of the

reasoning of the Monitoring Committee and submitted that if such an
activity could be permitted in the local shopping centre then certainly
it could also be permitted in a residential area.

10.

Appearing for the respondent MCD, Ms. Smita Shankar,

W.P.(C) 13427/2006

4 of 10

Advocate pointed out that records of the MCD clearly showed that the
activities in question began only in 1991 according to the petitioners
Shri Dharampal Sharma's own showing. The record of the MCD was
also produced before the Court.

It was found that in fact, the

application by the petitioner did mention

1991 as the date of

commencement of the activity.

11.

The first question that arises is whether the petitioners are

justified in their contentions that running of water cooling plant or
ice-cream factory is an activity that can be carried on in residential
areas and that the classification of such activity as industry is not
justified.

12.

The decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta

(supra) deals with the issue in paras 57 and 58 of the judgment which
read as under:“57. The position in respect of household industries
which are permissible, the question of the same not
being carried on in residential/con-conforming area
would not arise. The difficulty arises in carrying on
of such activity of household industry which is not
permissible. The State government sought expansion
of 'A' category industries. The government of India
has approved only 6 out of list of 41 industries. In
case, the remaining are not approved, impermissible
'A' category industrial units shall also have to stop
functioning.

It

is

imperative

for

the

Central

Government to expeditiously decide this issue one
way or the other.

In short, permissible household

industry activity can go on and impermissible activity
has to stop.

58. ............ In regard to other illegal industrial units,
the suggestion put forth on behalf of the Delhi

W.P.(C) 13427/2006

5 of 10

government

is

that

immediate

directions

for

closure/shifting of only those industrial units shall be
made which were set up after 31st December, 1996 as
under the Order dated 19th April, 1996, the industrial
activity

in

residential/non-conforming

areas

was

directed to be closed after 31st December, 1996. We,
however, see no justification for continuance of the
illegal

and

unauthorized

industrial

activity

in

residential/non-conforming areas which commenced
after 1st August, 1990.

It would also apply to

industries in categories 'B' to 'F'.”

13.

The above decision was taken note of by this Court in its order

dated 30.1.2006 in the petitioners' Writ Petition (C) No. 14187/2005.
In regard to the observation in para 59 of the judgment of the
Supreme Court that the proposal for the additional 41 items “for
being placed in category A has been approved by the DDA and the
matter is pending with the Government of India”, this Court observed
in para 29 of its judgment dated 30.1.2006 that “neither party has
brought on record as to what category of activities are listed in the
list of 41 activities which their Lordships of the Supreme Court noted
were intended to be included in Category 'A'.” In para 32, this Court
observed that “activities listed in Category 'A' have a common
characteristic of being non-polluting industries. A water cooling plant
and an ice-cream plant is, prima facie, a non-polluting plant, for the
reason the two activities do not generate any waste. With the aid of
colling/chilling equipment, milk in the case of ice-cream and water in
the case of a water cooling plant, are chilled. In the case of an icecream unit, some mixing of foodstuffs would also take place.”

14.

This Court was informed that “water cooling plants were

operating under the valid permission from the local shopping
centers”. In para 38, while referring these cases to the Monitoring
W.P.(C) 13427/2006

6 of 10

Committee, this Court required the said Committee to decide on the
following issues:“1. To decide the issue in light of the decision of this
Court dated 31.8.2004 in WP(C) No. 6857/2004 and
6858/2004 pertaining to, whether petitioners are
employing more than 10 workers and whether the
premises qualifies to be labelled as a factory under
the Factories Act, 1948.
2. The monitoring committee would decide the issue,
after verifying which activities have been further
authorized by the Central Government to be included
as part of Group 'A' to the Schedule to the Master
Plan

for

Delhi

as

permissible

activities

from

residential premises as household industries.
3.

In light of the permissible activities from

residential areas as household industries, decision
would be taken whether a water cooling plant and an
ice-cream factory are permissible activities from
residential areas.”

15.The following further consequential directions were issued:
“If decision is that the activities are permissible,
MCD would proceed ahead to renew the licenses. If
decision of the committee is that the activities are not
permissible activities in residential areas, it would be
open to the MCD to reject renewal of the licenses
sought. In said eventuality, MCD would ensure that
no water cooling plant and an ice-cream factory
operates from areas other than industrial areas and
to bring parity, would revoke licenses issued to
persons for operating water cooling plants and icecream units from areas other than notified industrial
areas. Needless to state, said action would be after
notice to said persons.”

16.

When the matter went before the Monitoring Committee, a good

deal of discussion took place.

W.P.(C) 13427/2006

The representatives of the DDA

7 of 10

informed the Committee that in the draft MPD 2021, the activities in
question

were

representatives

covered
also

under

appear

to

the

household

have

category.

informed

the

The

Monitoring

Committee that such activities (water cooling plant and ice-cream
units) involved use of gases in closed chambers and, therefore, could
be permitted in local commercial areas. Thereafter, the Monitoring
Committee observed as under:
“7. The representative of the DDA informed that as
per

draft

MPD

2021,

industries

have

been

categorized into two categories namely (i) list of
industries

permissible

in

residential

areas

as

household industries subject to their functioning
within prescribed parameters; and )ii) industries
which would not be allowed to be established in the
NCT of Delhi. It was further informed that the activity
of ice cream and water cooling plants are not covered
in any of the aforementioned two categories.
8.

After detailed deliberations the consensus was

that since the process of water cooling and ice cream
manufacturing are more or less the same, the activity
of water colling plant may also be permitted in local
commercial area subject to their functioning within
the prescribed parameters as detailed above.
9.

The attention of the Monitoring Committee was

also drawn to the Hon'ble Supreme Court's order
dated 7the May, 2004 delivered in the matter of
closure/shifting of unauthorized industrial activities
in Delhi in residential area in Writ Petition (Civil) No.
4677 of 1985 titled “M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India &
Others” which reads as under:(1) “All Industrial units that have come up in
residential/non-conforming areas in Delhi on or
after 1st August, 1990 shall close down and stop
operating as per the following schedule:(a)

Industrial

unites

pertaining

to

extensive industries ('F' category) within
a period of four months;

W.P.(C) 13427/2006

8 of 10

(b)

Industrial units pertaining to light

and service industries (category 'B' to 'F')
within five months.
(c)

Impermissible

industries

(category

household
'A')

within

six

months.
10.Accordingly it was decided that only those ice cream
factories water cooling plants, that have come up in
residential/non-conforming areas in Delhi on or after
1st August, 1990 shall be closed, and MCD may take
further action on the above lines in terms of the order
dated 30.1.2006 of the Hon'ble High Court.”

17.

It appears to this Court that the decision taken by the

Monitoring Committee not to permit the activity in question in
residential areas is based on relevant considerations. This Court has
not been shown anything in the decision which could be termed as
being perverse. This being a matter of a technical nature, Court will
not like to substitute its view for that of the Monitoring Committee
that such activities ought not to be permitted in residential areas.

18.

The only question that remains to be considered is whether

these two petitioners were, in fact, operating earlier than 1.8.1990.
The application form submitted by the petitioner Shri Dharampal
Sharma at the time of registration, has been produced by the counsel
for the MCD and also seen by the counsel for the petitioner.

It

contains a very clear statement by the petitioner Shri Dharampal
Sharma

that the unit started functioning in 1991.

This being the

factual position, counsel for the petitioner was unable to deny that on
their own showing, the petitioners had stated that they had
commenced operations in 1991.

In that view of the matter, the

petitioners do not stand to benefit by the limited protection given by
W.P.(C) 13427/2006

9 of 10

the Hon'ble Supreme Court to such of those units which have been
functioning prior to 1.8.1990.

19.

Viewed from any angle, therefore, the petitioners have failed to

make out a case for interference by the Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India. The writ petitions are dismissed, with no orders
as to costs. The interim orders stand vacated and the applications are
disposed of.
