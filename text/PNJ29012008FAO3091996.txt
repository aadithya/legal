PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (ORAL)

1.

A petty sum of Rs.79,690/- is the subject matter of

the instant litigation.
2.

The slow and grinding wheels of justice render it

painful for this court to record that the ethos of the Arbitration
Act 1940, namely, speedy and cheap justice has not been
achieved in the instant case.
3.

The matter requires to be re-considered by the

Arbitrator. I have no option but to set aside the award as also
the impugned order whereunder objections filed by the
Page 1 of 8

appellant to the award dated 24.9.1991 published by Shri Shiv
Prakash have been dismissed by the learned Additional District
Judge before whom objections under Section 30 read with
Section 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 were filed.
4.

My reasons for so remanding.

5.

A contract concluded between the petitioner and the

Director General of Civil Supplies and Disposal (GOI) when
appellant's offer as per tender floated by the Director General
of Supplies and Disposal was accepted vide undated letter (Ex.
P-44).

Inter alia the letter of acceptance contained a price

variation clause as under :“PRICE VARIATION CLAUSE
Prices:Accepted Rates are based on
present raw material price of Rs.3000/per kg. as fixed by Deptt. of Chemicals
effective from 27.1.87.
Variation in
accepted rates shall be applicable on
every increase/decrease of Rs.1/- per
kg. in bulk price of Rifempicin Powder
during the currency of Rate Contract.
The price will vary by Rs.0.30 per 1000
cap. In respect of Rifamicin Cap. 300
mg. And Rs.0.15 per 1000 caps. In
respect of Rifampicin Caps. 150 mg.”
6.

Supplies had to be effected between 1.10.1987 to

30.6.1988. But the time schedule was not adhered to by the
parties without demur or protest on either side.
7.

The month of September, 1988 reached.

Page 2 of 8

8.

Under the contract the goods had to be offered for

pre-shipment inspection before delivery.

Appellant offered

inspection of the goods on 9.9.1988, 14.9.1988 and 16.9.1988.
9.

Goods offered for inspection on 9.9.1988 and

16.9.1988 were inspected on 27.9.1988.

Goods offered for

inspection on 14.9.1988 were inspected on 6.10.1988.
10.

Post inspection the goods were thereafter delivered

on various dates in the month of October, November and
December, 1988.
11.

Bills were raised.

12.

They were raised at the contract stipulated rate.

13.

While effecting payment Rs.79,690/- was deducted

by the respondents. The reason for deduction was a stated
decrease in the price of raw material notified on 28.9.1988 by
the Department of Chemicals & Petro-Chemicals.
14.

The

respondent

intimated

the

effect

of

said

notification to the appellant under cover of its letter dated
28.11.1988.
15.

In its claim before the learned Arbitrator, appellant

inter alia, urged that the raw material was admittedly
consumed for manufacture of the capsules in question before
the dates on which notice of inspection was given.

That all

Page 3 of 8

dates were before 16.9.1988. According to the appellant this
evidenced that the raw material consumed was the one which
was purchased by the appellant before the price was reduced
vide notification dated 28.9.1988.
16.

The respondent did not pay heed.

It refused to

refund Rs.79,690/- to the appellant.
17.

Contract

between

the

parties

contained

an

arbitration clause. Same was invoked.
18.

Before the learned Arbitrator, appellant projected its

case as afore-noted. It was a simple case.

Appellant stated

that the raw material was consumed by 16.9.1988 evidenced
by the fact that the last lot of manufactured capsules was
offered for inspection on 16.9.1988. That the respondent took
time to inspect the goods and in the interregnum price of raw
material was decreased is of no consequence.
19.

To bring home the point that the date on which raw

material was consumed was treated as the relevant date for
purposes of applying the prince variation clause, a letter dated
27.2.1989 written by the Director General of Supplies and
Disposal (Ex. P-111) was relied upon.
20.

In respect to another contract having similar clause

the Director General of Supplies and Disposal had queried from

Page 4 of 8

the appellant as under :To,
M/s. Alpine Industries,
A-67, Naraina Industrial Area,
Phase-I, New Delhi-110028
Sub:- This Office Rate Contract No.DM-2/RC1963/88-89/52/COAD/427 dt. 22.4.88 for the
supply of Tablet Analgin 500 mg Specn: I.P.
For the period from 1.4.88 to 31.3.89
Ref:-Your
letter
No.8889/AI/DGS&D/(Analgin)/3770 dt. 6.1.89.
Dear Sirs,
You are requested to furnish a certificate from
your Chartered Accountant showing the Stock
Position of raw material prevailing on
20.12.88.
Please also furnish a consolidated Drawal
Reports for the period from 1.4.88 to 31.1.89
against the subject Rate Contract.
This is, however, without prejudice to the
terms and conditions of the Rate Contract.”
21.

With reference to Ex. P-111 it was urged before the

Arbitrator that the respondent was itself applying the rate
variation with respect to the date on which raw material was
consumed and hence in the instant case also the respondent
was bound to apply the same yardstick.
22.

By

a

cryptic

award

learned

Arbitrator

has

pronounced against the appellant as under :“The claim is disallowed for the reason the
claimant/contractor failed to supply the
Page 5 of 8

ordered supply within the stipulated delivery
period as per terms of the contract and
supplied the same during the extended
delivery period which was subject to R/R and
denial clause as contained in para 2 on the
extension letter.”
23.

The extension letter referred to by the learned

Arbitrator is the letter dated 28.11.1988. As noted hereinabove
the said letter is not actually the extension letter but is a letter
intimating the reduction in the price of raw material as per
Government of India notification dated 28.9.1988.
24.

Suffice would it be to record that the learned

Arbitrator has ignored a vital document being respondent's
letter dated 27.2.1989, contents whereof have been noted in
para 20 above.
25.

It may be noted that the contract is silent on the

point of the date on which price of raw material would be
applied.

The contract does not state that the price of raw

material to be taken into consideration would be when the
goods are offered for inspection.

The contract does not

stipulate that the date would be when the goods are inspected.
It even does not state that the date would be when goods are
delivered.
26.

The conduct of the parties would thus be relevant.

27.

Ex.P-111 was a good evidence of conduct of the
Page 6 of 8

respondent for the reason when price rose, respondent
required the supplier to show the date on which it consumed
the raw material for the reason price paid for finished goods
was in relation to the price of raw material when raw material
was consumed in the manufacture of capsules.
28.

If aforesaid conduct was good when price increased,

the same had prima facie to hold good when price decreased.
29.

Be that as it may, the inference with respect to

letter Ex. P-111 was a vital inference to be considered by the
learned Arbitrator.
30.

Unfortunately, the learned Judge who dealt with the

objections to the award has also ignored the aforesaid position.
31.

It is settled law that where an Arbitrator ignores a

vital evidence or eschews a vital document it amounts to a
misconduct requiring award to be set aside.
32.

The appeal accordingly stands disposed of setting

aside the impugned order dated 22.5.1996 disposing of RCS
No.753/1995 (422/1991) Alpine Industries Vs. UOI. Objections
filed to the award dated 24.9.1991 passed by Shri Shiv Prakash
the Sole Arbitrator are allowed. The award is set aside.
33.

The Director General of Supplies and Disposal is

directed to appoint a fresh Arbitrator who would re-decide the

Page 7 of 8

claim of the appellant and while so doing would be guided by
the observations in the present order.
34.

The registry is directed to return the trial court

record.
35.

Since the record of arbitration is with the record of

the learned Trial Court, learned counsel for the appellant is
notified that before the new Arbitrator appointed he would
make a request to summon the record of arbitration from the
Trial Court record.
36.

Needless to state learned Arbitrator would not

complete pleadings nor record any evidence. On the basis of
the existing pleadings and the evidence, after hearing the
parties decision would be taken.
37.

Since none appears at the hearing to oppose the

petition I refrain from awarding any costs.
