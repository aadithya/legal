PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Appellants are aggrieved by the compensation

awarded as per the award dated 27th March, 1991.
2.

Deceased Jagdish Prasad was a pillion rider on a two

wheeler scooter being driven by one Gian Chand.
1.12.1984 they were proceeding towards

On

Ghaziabad when

truck No.UHD-853 hit the scooter and as a result of the
impact, the occupants of the scooter fell down.

3.

Multiple injuries received by Jagdish Prasad proved

to be fatal. He died. Jagdish Prasad was aged 34 years when
he died. Photocopy of a school certificate recorded his date
of birth as 1.7.1950.
4.

Since loss of dependence to the family had to be

determined by the award, learned Tribunal has considered
the income as also the number of dependants.
5.

On a monthly income of Rs.2000/-, applying the

multiplier 25 loss of dependence to the family has been
worked out at Rs.6,00,000/-. (Rs.2000 x 12 x 25).
6.

Interest @ 12% p.a. from date of the claim petition

till award has been directed to be paid.
7.

Dependants of the deceased were his wife Sneh

Lata, 3 sons Sandeep, Vineet and Sanjay and his mother
Jagwanti Devi.
8.

As per the award, the 3 sons were minor.

9.

Unfortunately, from the evidence on record age of

the children is not forthcoming.
10.

At this stage, I may note that the trial court record is

not available.

But Shri O.P.Goyal, learned counsel for the

appellant referred to the evidence recorded before the
FAO 12/1991

Page No.2 of 8

Tribunal from the copies available.
11.

The Tribunal has assessed compensation at a

monthly income of Rs.2000/- for the reason appellant No.1
who appeared as PW-12 stated that her husband was giving
to her Rs.2000/- per month.

Believing said statement,

compensation as aforenoted has been determined.
12.

It is urged before me that appellant No.1 stated

before the Tribunal that her husband was having agricultural
land in Village Rateeoli, Tehsil Sardana, Distt. Meerut, Uttar
Pradesh and had also installed a crusher. In the said crusher
sugarcane juice was extracted and converted into gur. She
also stated that her husband was doing business of sale
purchase of foodgrain. She also stated that he was a partner
in a brick kiln. She stated that the earnings of her husband
were between Rs.10,000/- to Rs.12,000/-.
13.

Accordingly, counsel urges that the compensation of

Rs.6 lacs which has been awarded is inadequate.
14.

When questioned by me as to where is the proof

that the deceased was running a cane crusher, had foodgrain
business and was a partner in a brick kiln, save and except
the self serving statements of the wife, learned counsel for
FAO 12/1991

Page No.3 of 8

the appellant conceded that there was no evidence, save and
except the statement of the wife.
15.

When questioned as to whether there was any proof

of the husband acquiring capital assets or depositing money
in the bank for the reason case projected is that the deceased
had a

monthly income between Rs.10,000/- to Rs.12,000/-

per month and according to the wife she was being handed
over Rs.2000/- per month for household expenses, learned
counsel for the appellant conceded that there was no proof.
16.

When

further

questioned

as

to

whether

the

deceased was paying any income tax, counsel for the
appellant conceded that he was not. But, counsel urged that
the income of the deceased was mainly from agricultural
lands.
17.

There being no proof that the deceased was

accumulating Rs.8000/- to Rs.10,000/- per month by way of
the savings and there being no evidence of acquisition of
capital assets by the deceased, I cannot believe the version of
the wife that the deceased was earning between Rs.10,000/to Rs.12,000/- per month.
18.

Besides, if argument of learned counsel for the

FAO 12/1991

Page No.4 of 8

appellants is to be accepted that the main income of the
deceased was from agricultural lands, decision of the
Supreme Court reported as (2005) 10 SCC 720 New India
Assurance Co. Vs. Charlie & Anr. is attracted.
19.

In said case, injured was an agriculturalist. It was

observed that the capital asset wherefrom income was
generated remained and this had to be taken note of while
determining the compensation to the injured.
20.

It is not the evidence of the appellants that the

deceased was himself tilling the land. Thus, hardly any loss
would be occasioned to the family due to death of the
deceased, vis-a-vis the income from agricultural activity.
21.

Theoretically, the supervision which deceased was

exercising over his farm labour would be required to be
converted into a money value and recompensed thereafter to
the family.
22.

The topic of compensation for causing death by

negligent driving has been a subject matter of consideration
in thousands of decisions.
23.

Unfortunately, India is one of the countries in the

world having highest number of road accidents.
FAO 12/1991

Page No.5 of 8

24.

A discernible principle which has emerged in all

decisions is that damages to be awarded have to be based on
the reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit or benefit
reducible to money value.

In assessing damages all

circumstances which legitimately result in diminution of the
damages have to be considered.

On the other hand,

ascertainment of the loss to the family by taking into account
future pecuniary benefits, and, or any other pecuniary
advantages have to be considered.
25.

In the words of Viscount Simon in the decision

reported as 1951 (2) All ER 448 Nance Vs. British Columbia
Electric Railway Co. for estimating damages, the method
adopted requires :“.....at first the deceased man's expectation of life
has to be estimated having regard to his age, bodily
health
and
the
possibility
of
premature
determination of his life by later accidents;
secondly, the amount required for the future
provision of his wife shall be estimated having
regard to the amounts he used to spend on her
during his lifetime, and other circumstances; thirdly,
the estimated annual sum is multiplied by the
number of years of the man's estimated span of
life, and the said amount must be discounted so as
to arrive at the equivalent in the form of a lump
sum payable on his death; fourthly, further
deductions must be made for the benefit accruing
to the widow from the acceleration of her interest in
FAO 12/1991

Page No.6 of 8

his estate; and, fifthly, further amounts have to be
deducted for the possibility of the wife dying earlier
if the husband had lived the full span of life; and it
should also be taken into account that there is the
possibility of the widow remarrying much to the
improvement of her financial position. It would be
seen from the said mode of estimation that many
imponderables enter into the calculation.”
26.
I do not intend to pen down a catalogue of various
decisions but would note that pertaining to accidents of a
comparable date i.e. the year 1984, in the decision reported
as 1994 2 SCC 174, G.M.Kerala State Road Transport
Corporation Vs. Susamma Thomas & Ors., for a deceased
earning Rs.1032/- per month, giving benefit of future increase
in the earnings, compensation awarded to the family was
Rs.2,25,000/-.

I may note that while arriving at the

compensation, taking Rs.2000/- per month as the gross
income, which as noted above included future prospects,
1/3rd was deducted towards the personal expenses of the
deceased and loss to the family was determined on the basis
of monthly dependence of Rs.1400/-.
27.

In the instant case loss of dependence has been

worked out at Rs.6 lacs. It is nearly 2.75 times higher than
the loss of dependence worked out in Sussama Thomas's
case.
FAO 12/1991

Page No.7 of 8

28.

I find hardly any scope for any increase as I find that

pertaining to accidents for the year 1984 and earnings being
around Rs.1200/- per month, after giving benefit of future
increase in the income, judicial trends indicate compensations
being awarded near about Rs.2.5 lacs.
28.

In the instant case, the Tribunal has determined

monthly income of the deceased at Rs.2000/-. On the entire
sum, applying the multiplier 25 compensation of Rs.6 lacs has
been awarded.
29.

Assuming future prospects would have resulted in

increase in income but noting that very high multiplier has
been applied and if multiplier of even 15 is applied,
compensation payable would be much less than Rs.6 lacs.
30.

I find no merit in the appeal.

31.

The same is dismissed.
