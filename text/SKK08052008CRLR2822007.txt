Pablo Picasso, a renowned artist said, “Art is never chaste.
It ought to be forbidden to ignorant innocents, never
allowed into contact with those not sufficiently prepared.
Yes, art is dangerous. Where it is chaste, it is not art.”

2.

Art, to every artist, is a vehicle for personal expression. An
aesthetic work of art has the vigour to connect to an
individual sensory, emotionally, mentally and spiritually.
With a 5000-year-old culture, Indian Art has been rich in
its tapestry of ancient heritage right from the medieval
times to the contemporary art adorned today with each
painting having a story to narrate.

3.

Ancient Indian art has been never devoid of eroticism
where sex worship and graphical representation of the
union between man and woman has been a recurring
feature.1

representation of the act of creation, the union of Prakriti
and Purusua.2 The ultimate essence of a work of ancient
Indian erotic art has been religious in character and can
be enunciated as a state of heightened delight or ananda,
the kind of bliss that can be experienced only by the
spirit.
4.

Today Indian art is confidently coming of age. Every form
of stylistic expression in the visual arts, from naturalism to
abstract expressionism derives its power from the artist's
emotional connection to his perceptual reality. The Nude
in contemporary art, a perennial art subject, considered to
be the greatest challenges in art has still not lost its
charm and focuses on how the human form has been reinterpreted by the emerging and influential artists today.
The paintbrush has become a powerful tool of expression
as the pen is for some, and has thus occasionally come
under the line of fire for having crossed the ‘Lakshman
Rekha’ and for plunging into the forbidden, which is called
‘obscene’, ‘vulgar’, ‘depraving’, ‘prurient’ and ‘immoral’.3
No doubt this form of art is a reflection of a very alluring
concept of beauty and there is certainly something more

to it than pearly ‘flesh’ 4 but what needs to be determined
is which art falls under the latter category.
5.

The

present

petitions

seeking

to

challenge

the

summoning orders against the petitioner arise from such
a contemporary painting celebrating nudity made by an
accomplished painter/petitioner. The said painting depicts
India in an abstract and graphical representation of a
woman in nude with her hair flowing in the form of
Himalayas displaying her agony. It is stated that the said
painting was sold to a private collector in the year 2004
and that the petitioner did not deal with the same in any
manner whatsoever after sale. Subsequently in the year
2006, the said painting entitled “Bharat Mata” was
advertised as part of an on-line auction for charity for
Kashmir

earthquake

victims

organised

by

a

non-

governmental organisation with which the petitioner
claims to have no involvement. It is stated that the
petitioner at no point in time had given a title to the said
painting. The advertisement of the said painting led to
large scale protests for which the petitioner also had to
tender an apology.
6.

It is in this background that there were private complaints
filed at various parts of the country being Pandharpur,
Maharashtra; Rajkot, Gujarat; Indore and Bhopal, Madhya
Pradesh alleging various offences against the petitioner
on account of the aforesaid painting consequent whereto

4 Id. n. 1.

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 4 of 74

summons and warrants of arrest were issued against the
petitioner. The petitioner approached the Supreme Court
seeking consolidation of the matter. The Supreme Court
acceded to the request and in pursuance to the directions
passed vide order dated 04-12-2006, the said complaint
cases

pending

consideration

were

consolidated

and

transferred to the court of the Ld. ACMM, Delhi by way of
transfer petitions filed by the petitioner being T.P. (Cri.)
No. 129/2006, T.P. (Cri.) No. 182/2006 and T.P. (Cri.) No.
224/2006. The Ld. ACMM, Delhi issued summons to the
petitioner for various offences u/s 292/294/298 of the
Indian Penal Code ('IPC' for short) against which the
present revision petitions have been filed.
7.

Notices were issued by this court and exemption was
granted to the petitioner from personal appearance. In
view of certain propositions having arisen, this court
deemed it appropriate to issue court notice to the Ld.
Attorney General in order to depute a law officer for
assistance to this court. A perusal of the order sheets
shows that none had sought to appear and argue the
matter for the respondents in Crl. Rev. P. 114/2007 and
Crl. Rev. P. 280/2007, thus this court vide order dated 2003-2008 closed the right of the said respondents to
advance any further submissions. However, the GPA
holder of the respondent in Crl. Rev. P. 280/2007 entered
appearance on 31-03-2008 and requested to make further
submissions in that behalf which was permitted.

India has embraced different eras and civilizations which
have given her a colour of mystery and transformed into
her glorious past adapting various cultures and art forms.
In the Mughal period too one may see murals and
miniatures depicting mating couples. That has been the
beauty of our land. Art and authority have never had a
difficult relationship until recently. In fact, art and artists
used to be patronized by various kings and the elite class.
It is very unfortunate that the works of many artists today
who have tried to play around with nudity have come
under scrutiny and have had to face the music which has
definitely made the artists to think twice before exhibiting
their work of art. Therefore, looking at a piece of art from
the

painters’

perspective

becomes

very

important

especially in the context of nudes. What needs to be seen
is that the work is not sensational for the sake of being so
and hence needs to be understood before any objections
are raised. The courts have been grappling with the
problem of balancing the individuals’ right to speech and
expression and the frontiers of exercising that right. The
aim has been to arrive at a decision that would protect
the “quality of life” without making “closed mind” a
principal feature of an open society or an unwilling
recipient of information the arbiter to veto or restrict
freedom of speech and expression.
9.

In order to examine the matter closely it would be
pertinent to discuss the broad realms of the law relating

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 6 of 74

to obscenity and the artistic freedom given within the
parameters of Article 19 of the Constitution of India
(hereinafter referred to as the Constitution). The learned
counsel for the petitioner and the Ld. ASG have assisted
this court to bring to light this aspect by way of a plethora
of precedents (Indian as well as international) where the
courts faced with similar situations have discussed and
enunciated the law in relation to obscenity. The position in
this respect is summarized below:
United States of America
10.

The courts in United States of America have given primary
importance to protect the freedom guaranteed by the
First Amendment to the American Constitution wherein an
absolute prohibition is imposed on the abridgment of
freedom of speech thus casting a heavy burden on
anyone

transgressing

the

right

to

justify

the

transgression. Since the constitutional provision contained
no exceptions, these had to be evolved by judicial
decisions.
11.

It was in the case of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire 315
U.S. 568, wherein the Courts recognized “obscenity” as an
exception to an absolute freedom guaranteed by the
American Constitution. In Roth v. United States 354 U.S.
476 the Supreme Court directly dealt with the issue of
“obscenity” as an exception to freedom of speech and
expression. It delved into the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C
1461 that made punishable the mailing of any material

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 7 of 74

which was “obscene, lascivious, lewd or filthy and other
publication of an indecent character”. While upholding the
constitutional validity of the above Code the Court
observed that “obscenity is not within the area of
constitutionally protected freedom of speech or press either (1) under the First Amendment, as to the Federal
Government, or (2) under the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, as to the States”. The Court
further held that the rejection of “obscenity” was implicit
in the First Amendment. Sex and Obscenity were held not
to be synonymous with each other. Only those sex-related
materials which had the tendency of “exciting lustful
thoughts” were held to be obscene. The aspect of
obscenity had to be judged from the point of view of an
average person by applying contemporary community
standards.
12.

In this case the Supreme Court also rejected the common
law test evolved in England in the case of Regina v.
Hicklin 1868. L. R. 3 Q. B. 360 of the material having the
tendency to deprave and corrupt the minds of only those
persons who are open to such immoral influence, and into
whose hands the publication of this sort may fall. The
Supreme Court observed as follows:
“The Hicklin test, judging obscenity by the
effect of isolated passages upon the most
susceptible persons, might well encompass
material legitimately treating with sex, and
so it must be rejected as unconstitutionally
restrictive of the freedoms of speech and
press. On the other hand, the substituted

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 8 of 74

standard provides safeguards adequate to
withstand the charge of constitutional
infirmity.”
13.

Court

the

in

Memoirs

explained

v.
the

meaning of the term “obscenity” in the following words:
“Under this definition, as elaborated in
subsequent cases, three elements must
coalesce: it must be established that (a) the
dominant theme of the material taken as a
whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex;
(b) the material is patently offensive
because
it
affronts
contemporary
community standards relating to the
description or representation of sexual
matters; and (c) the material is utterly
without redeeming social value.”
14.

The California Penal Code was approximately based on
the above test, under the terms of which an intentional
distribution of obscene matter was an offence. In Miller v.
California 413 U.S. 15, the test of “utterly without
redeeming social value” was rejected. This was a case
involving an aggressive sales campaign relating to a book
containing sexually explicit material which came to be
thrusted upon people who had expressed no desire to
receive them. It was observed that the court has
recognized that the States have a legitimate interest in
prohibiting

dissemination

or

exhibition

of

obscene

material when the mode of dissemination carries with it a
significant

danger

of

offending

the

sensibilities

of

unwilling recipients or of exposure to juveniles.
15.

In Stanley v. Georgia 394 U.S 557, the Supreme Court of
United

States

dealt

with

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

another

issue

related
Page 9 of 74

to

“obscenity”

which

concerned

private

possession

of

obscene material by the Appellant which was an offense
under the law of Georgia. The Court in this case held that
mere possession of the obscene material was not a crime.
In doing so, the Court did not hold that obscene material
had become a “protected speech”, rather, the Court
recognized that the freedom of speech goes beyond selfexpression and includes the fundamental right to “receive
information and ideas regardless of their social worth.”
16.

In Mishkin v. New York 383 U.S 502 the Court removed the
test of the average person by saying that if the material is
designed for a deviant sexual group, the material can be
censored only if it appeals to the prurient interest in sex
of the members of that group when taken as a whole.

17.

The United States of America has recently enacted a
statute

regulating

obscenity

on

the

internet

i.e.

Communication Decency Act, 1996 (CDA) which prohibits,
knowingly sending or displaying of “patently offensive”
material depicting or describing sexual or excretory
activities or organs, in any manner that is available to a
person under 18 years of age using an “interactive
computer service”. The constitutionality of this statute
came to be challenged before the Supreme Court in the
case of Reno v. ACLU, 117 S. Ct. 2329 (1997) wherein it
was argued that the aim of the Government while enacted
the said statute was protecting the children from harmful
material. The Supreme Court observed that the words of
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 10 of 74

the statute were vague and uncertain. It further held that
the provisions of CDA lacked the precision that the First
Amendment requires

when a statute regulates

governments’

interest

the
in

protecting children from exposure to harmful material was
held not to justify “an unnecessarily broad suppression of
speech addressed to adults”. The court observed that the
undefined terms “patently offensive” and “indecent” were
wide enough to cover large amounts of non-pornographic
material with serious educational value. In relation to the
internet the "community standards" criterion was held to
mean that any communication available to a nation wide
audience

will

be

judged

by

the

standards

of

the

community most likely to be offended by the message,
though in the case of New York v. Ferber 458 U.S 747
child pornography was recognized as an exception to
freedom of speech guaranteed under the American
Constitution.
Canada
18.

For quite some time, the Canadian courts followed the
Hicklin's Test but with the introduction of the statutory
provision of section 163(8) in the Criminal Code, the said
test was replaced with a series of rules developed by the
courts. The Canadian Criminal Code defines obscene
material as any publication a dominant characteristic of
which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any
one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime,

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 11 of 74

horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be
obscene. The first case to consider the said provision was
Brodie v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 681. The majority
found in that case that D.H.Lawrence's novel, Lady
Chatterley's Lover, was not obscene within the meaning of
the Code.
19.

One of the most progressive and liberal judgments on
obscenity was Regina v. Butler (1992) 1 SCR 452 by the
Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada
extensively

interpreted

exploitation,

holding

the

that

the

meaning
dominant

of
test

"undue
is

a

community standard one. The portrayal of sex coupled
with violence will almost always constitute the undue
exploitation of sex. Explicit sex, which is degrading or
dehumanizing may be undue if the risk of harm is
substantial. Finally, explicit sex that is not violent and
neither degrading nor dehumanizing is generally tolerated
in our society

and will not qualify

as the undue

exploitation of sex unless it employs children in its
production. In order for the work or material to qualify as
'obscene' the exploitation of sex must only be its
dominant characteristic, but such exploitation must be
'undue'. In determining when exploitation of sex will be
'undue', the courts formulated a workable test. The test
being the 'community standard of tolerance' test. It was
further

observed

that

the

State

could

not

restrict

expression simply because it was distasteful or did not
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 12 of 74

accord

with

dominant

conceptions

of

what

was

appropriate. In Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd. v. The Queen,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 494 the court elaborated the the
community standards test and held that it is the standard
of tolerance, not taste that is relevant. What matters is
not what Canadians think is right for themselves to see
(but) what the community would (not) tolerate others
being exposed to on the basis of the degree of harm that
may flow from such exposure. In R v. Dominion News &
Gifts 1963. 2 C.C.C. 103., the court stated that the
community standard test must necessarily respond to
changing mores.
Australia
20.

There is no express right to free speech in Australia as in
the USA. At most, Australia has a limited implied
constitutional guarantee of political discussion. The right
of free artistic expression in Australia is constrained by
defamation law; trade practices laws; the provisions as
per the Online Services Act and various State and
Territory obscenity laws in particular the state Summary
Offences Acts which create offences related to the display
of indecent, obscene or offensive material. Definitions of
'obscene' or 'indecent' are often not contained in the
legislation and courts rely on traditional legal tests such
as the capacity of the material to 'deprave and corrupt'
and/or community standards. .

21.

Justice Windeyer settled the test for obscenity in Australia

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 13 of 74

in Crowe v. Graham (1968) 121 CLR 375.
"Does the publication... transgress the
generally
accepted
bounds
of
decency?
...where "[c]ontemporary standards
are those currently accepted by the
Australian
community...
And
community standards are those which
ordinary
decent-minded
people
accept."
22.

It is well established that this community standards test
will be applied to sexual, violent, criminal and certain
religious matters. These are the very concepts often
explored in art. The courts while answering the question
in particular cases relating to visual art and obscenity as
to whether the artwork offends contemporary community
standards have taken in consideration the following
factors into account: the circumstances of the artwork's
publication

(including

any

evidence

of

its

limited

circulation); the target group of the publication (including
whether the target audience was narrowed physically or
by appropriate warning signs about the content of the
artwork); and whether or not the artwork has artistic merit
(taking into account any expert evidence on this point).
There is not, however, any absolute or partial defence of
artistic merit.
United Kingdom
23.

Under the Common Law, obscenity being an indictable
offense is punishable with fine and imprisonment at the
discretion of the court. The offence of obscenity was
established in England three hundred years ago, when Sir

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 14 of 74

Charles Sedley exposed his person to the public gaze on
the balcony of a tavern. Obscenity in books, however, was
punishable only before the spiritual courts as was held in
1708 in which year Queen v. Read 11 Mod 205 Q.B. came
to be decided. In 1857, Lord Campbell enacted the first
legislative measure against obscene books etc. and his
successor in the office of Chief Justice interpreted his
statute in Regina v. Hicklin (Supra) where it was held as
follows:
"The test of obscenity is whether the
tendency of the matter charged as obscenity
is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds
are open to such immoral influences and into
whose hands a publication of this sort may
fall."
(Emphasis Supplied)
24.

This came to be known as the Hicklins test. It set an early
precedent for obscenity which was followed by the
American courts until the decisions in Roth’s Case (supra).
The Hicklin’s rule allowed a publication to be judged for
obscenity

based

on

isolated

passages

of

a

work

considered out of context and judged by their apparent
influence on most susceptible readers, such as children or
weak-minded adults.
25.

The general law of obscenity in England is contained in
the Obscene Publications Act, 1959. In terms of the said
Act publication of obscene article, whether for gain or not
and its possession solely, either of the person himself or
for gain of another person is an offence. Interestingly, the
statute defines “obscenity” as follows:

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 15 of 74

“an article shall be deemed to be obscene if
its effect or the effect of any one of its items
is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to
deprave and corrupt persons who are likely,
having regard to all relevant circumstances,
to read, see or hear the matter contained or
embodied in it.”
26.

A 1994 amendment also brought within the purview of
this statute data stored or transmitted electronically.

27.

In DPP v Whyte [1972] AC 849 the respondent booksellers
were charged with “having” obscene articles, namely
books and magazines for publication for gain. They were
acquitted on the basis that their clientèle was already
depraved and corrupted, but the House of Lords held that
even those already depraved and corrupted could be
corrupted further. Lord Wilberforce observed as under:
“The Act is not merely concerned with the
once for all corruption for the wholly
innocent; it equally protects the less innocent
from further corruption, the addict from
feeding or increasing his addiction. To say
this is not to negate the principle of relative
obscenity certainly the tendency to deprave
and corrupt is not to be estimated in relation
to some assumed standard of purity of some
reasonable average man. It is the likely
reader. And to apply different tests to
teenagers, members of men’s clubs or men
in various occupations or localities would be
a matter of common sense.”

28.

Thus, it is clear that the Hicklin’s Test has been applied to
determine obscenity in England since its evolution. The
Courts in the United States of America have given up the
Hicklins Test, but the Indian law on obscenity is more or
less based on it. In addition to this, law on obscenity in
India also panders to the test of 'lascivious and prurient

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 16 of 74

interests' as taken from the American law.
India
29.

The general law of obscenity in India can be found in
Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 which reads as
under:
“S. 292. Sale, etc., of obscene books,
etc.-[(1)] For the purposes of sub-section (2)

more distinct items) the effects of any one of
its items, is, if taken as a whole, such as to
tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are

30.

Section 292 IPC was enacted by the Obscene Publications
Act to give effect to Article I of the International
Convention for suppression of or traffic in obscene
publications to which India is a signatory. By Act 36 of
1969, section 292 was amended to give more precise
meaning to the word ‘obscene’ as used in the section in
addition to creating an exception for publication of matter
which is proved to be justified as being for the public
good, being in the interest of science, literature, art or
learning or other objects of general concern. Prior to its

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 18 of 74

amendment, section 292 contained no definition of
obscenity. The amendment also literally does not provide
for a definition of ‘obscenity’ inasmuch as it introduces a
deeming provision.
31.

On a bare reading of sub-section (1) of Section 292 it is
obvious that a book etc. shall be deemed to be obscene (i)
if it is lascivious; (ii) it appeals to the prurient interest, and
(iii) it tends to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely
to read, see or hear the matter alleged to be obscene. It is
only once the impugned matter is found to be obscene
that the question of whether the impugned matter falls
within any of the exceptions contained in the section
would arise.

32.

Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000
relevant for the subject under discussion reads as follows:
“67. Publishing of information which is
obscene in electronic form.--Whoever
publishes or transmits or causes to be
published in the electronic form, any material
which is lascivious or appeals to the prurient
interest or if its effect is such as to tend to
deprave and corrupt persons who are likely,
having regard to all relevant circumstances,
to read, see or hear the matter contained or
embodied in it, shall be punished on first
conviction with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to
five years and with fine which may extend to
one lakh rupees and in the event of a second
or subsequent conviction with imprisonment
of either description for a term which may
extend to ten years and also with fine which
may extend to two lakh rupees.”

33.

Thus Section 67 is the first statutory provisions dealing
with obscenity on the Internet. It must be noted that the

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 19 of 74

both under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the
Information Technology Act, 2000 the test to determine
obscenity

is

similar.

Therefore,

it

is

necessary

to

understand the broad parameters of the law laid down by
the courts in India, in order to determine “obscenity”.
34.

The Indian Penal Code on obscenity has grown out of the
English Law and while interpreting the meaning of
“obscenity” the Supreme Court in Ranjit D. Udeshi v. State
of Maharashtra AIR 1965 SC 881 uniformly adopted the
test laid down by the English Court in Hicklins Case Supra
wherein it was held that the word “obscene” in the section
is not limited to writings, pictures etc. intended to arouse
sexual desire. At the same time, the mere treating with
sex and nudity in art and literature is not per se evidence
of obscenity. It was emphasized that the work as a whole
must be considered,

the obscene matter must be

considered by itself and separately to find out whether it
is so gross and its obscenity so decided that it is likely to
deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to
influences of this sort. Where art and obscenity are mixed,
art must so preponderate as to throw the obscenity out
into

the

shadow

or

the

obscenity

so

trivial

and

insignificant that it can have no effect and may be
overlooked.
35.

The Courts explained that the Hicklin’s test does not
emphasize merely on stray words, as the words are
“matters charged” and to that extent it must be held to

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 20 of 74

secundum subjectum materiam, that is to say, applicable
to the matter there considered. Thus, the court must
apply itself to consider each work at a time.
36.

It was further observed that there exists a distinction
between “obscenity” and “pornography”, while later
consists of pictures, writings etc. which are intended to
arouse sexual feelings whereas the former consists of
writings etc. which though are not intended to arouse
sexual feelings but definitely has that tendency.

37.

In Shri Chandrakant Kalyandas Kakodkar v. The State of
Maharashtra 1969 (2) SCC 687, which case relates to
articles and pictures in the magazine being alleged to be
obscene and calculated to corrupt and deprave the minds
of the reader, the courts reiterated the ratio as was laid
down in Ranjit Udeshi’s case (supra) and held that the
concept of obscenity would differ from country to country
depending on the contemporary standards of the society.
But to insist that the standard should always be for the
writer to see that the adolescent ought not to be brought
into contact with sex or that if they read any references to
sex in what is written whether that is the dominant theme
or not, they would be affected, would be to require
authors to write books only for the adolescent and not for
the adults. It was held that with the standards of
contemporary society in India fast changing, the adults
and adolescents have available to them a large number of
pieces of literature which have a content of sex, love and

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 21 of 74

romance and if a reference to sex by itself is considered
obscene, no books could be sold except those which are
purely religious. Thus, what one has to see is whether a
class, not an isolated case, into whose hands the book,
article or story falls suffer in their moral outlook or
become depraved by reading it or might have impure and
lecherous thought aroused in their minds.
38.

The Supreme Court of India in the K.A. Abbas v. UOI
(1970) 2 SCC 780 has called the test laid down in
Mishkin’s case (supra) as “selective-audience obscenity
test” and observed as follows:
“49. Our standards must be so framed that
we are not reduced to a level where the
protection of the least capable and the most
depraved amongst us determines what the
morally healthy cannot view or read………..
The requirements of art and literature include
within themselves a comprehensive view of
social life and not only in its ideal form and
the line is to be drawn where the average
moral man begins to feel embarrassed or
disgusted at a naked portrayal of life without
the redeeming touch of art or genius or social
value. If the depraved begins to see in these
things more than what an average person
would, in much the same way, as it is
wrongly said, a Frenchman sees a woman’s
legs in everything, it cannot be helped. In our
scheme of things ideas having redeeming
social or artistic value must also have
importance and protection for their growth.”
(Emphasis supplied)

39.

In Samaresh Bose v. Amal Mitra (1985) 4 SCC 289 the
courts

while

distinguishing

between

vulgarity

and

obscenity held that “vulgarity” may arouse a feeling of
revulsion,

disgust

and

even

boredom

but

unlike

“pornography” or “obscenity” do not have the tendency
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 22 of 74

to corrupt or deprave the minds of a person. In addition to
the above, the court observed that for the purposes of
judging obscenity, firstly the judge must place himself in
the position of the author in order to appreciate what the
author really wishes to convey, and thereafter he must
place himself in the position of the reader of every age
group in whose hands the book is likely to fall and then
arrive at a dispassionate conclusion.
40.

The

court

in

Sada

Nand

&

Ors.

v.

State

(Delhi

Administration) ILR (1986) II Delhi 81 laid down the test to
the affect that the pictures of a nude/semi-nude woman
cannot per se be called obscene unless the same are
suggestive of deprave mind and are designed to excite
sexual passion in the persons who are likely to look at
them or see them. This will depend on the particular
posture and the background in which a nude semi-nude
woman is shown. While applying this test in the instant
case, the court held that the nude pictures cannot be
termed as obscene i.e. which will have a tendency to
deprave and corrupt the minds of people in whose hands
the magazine in question is likely to fall. However, a look
at the impugned pictures was held to show beyond a
shadow of doubt that they can hardly be said to have any
aesthetic or artistic touch, rather they seem to have been
taken with the sole purpose of attracting readers who may
have a prurient mind. The women in nude had been just
made to lie on a grassy plot or sit on some stool etc. and
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 23 of 74

pose for a photograph in the nude. So they may well be
said to be vulgar and indecent but all the same it may be
difficult to term them obscene within the meaning of
Section 292 IPC.
41.

The findings of the court in Bobby Art International & Ors.
v. Om Pal Singh Hoon & Ors. (1996) 4 SCC 1, which may
be relevant for the present matter, have been reproduced
below:
“First, the scene where she is humiliated,
stripped naked, paraded, made to draw
water from the well, within the circle of a
hundred men. The exposure of her breasts
and genitalia to those men is intended by
those who strip her to demean her. The
effect of so doing upon her could hardly been
better conveyed than by explicitly showing
the scene. The object of doing so was not to
titillate the cinema-goer's lust but to arouse
in him sympathy for the victim and disgust
for the perpetrators. The revulsion that
Tribunal referred to was not at Phoolan Devi's
nudity but at the sadism and heartlessness of
those who had stripped her naked to rob her
of every shred of dignity. Nakedness does
not always arouse the baser instinct. The
reference by the Tribunal to the film
'Schindler's List' was apt. There is a scene in
it of rows of naked men and women, shown
frontally, being led into the gas chambers of
a Nazi concentration camp. Not only are they
about to die but they have been stripped in
their last moments of the basic dignity of
human beings. Tears are a likely reaction;
pity, horror and a fellow feeling of shame are
certain, except in the pervert who might be
aroused. We do not censor to protect the
pervert or to assuage the susceptibilities of
the over-sensitive. 'Bandit Queen' tells a
powerful human story and to that story the
scene of Phoolan Devi's enforced naked
parade is central. It helps to explain why
Phoolan Devi became what she did: rage and
vendetta against the society that had heaped
indignities upon her.

In the case of Ajay Goswami v. Union of India (2007)1 SCC
143 the Supreme Court, while recognizing the right of
adult entertainment, reviewed the position of law on
obscenity and summarized the various tests laid down of
obscenity.

43.

Recently, in Vinay Mohan v. Delhi Administration 2008 II
AD (Delhi) 315, Pradeep Nandrajog J. while dismissing the
petition against framing of charge held that it is a
recognised principle of law that concept of obscenity is
moulded to a great extent by the social outlook of people
and hence in relation to nude/semi-nude pictures of a
woman it would depend on a particular posture, pose, the
surrounding circumstances and background in which
woman is shown.

Artistic Freedom and Obscenity
44.

There is a sharp distinction between Constitution of United
States of America and India. In the former, freedom of
speech guaranteed is absolute and in the later the
Constitutional itself provides for certain exceptions. The
duty cast upon the courts in India is to ensure that the
State does not impose any unreasonable restriction.

45.

The Constitution of India, by virtue of Article 19 (1) (a),
guarantees to its citizen the freedom of speech and
expression. India is also a party to the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and therefore bound
to respect the right to freedom of expression guaranteed
by Article 19 thereof, which states:

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 25 of 74

a. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions
without interference.
b. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of
expression; this right shall include freedom to seek,
receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds
regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in
print, in form of art, or through any other media of his
choice.
46.

Nevertheless, there is an inseparable connection between
freedom of speech and the stability of the society. This
freedom is subject to sub- clause (2) of Article 19, which
allows the State to impose restriction on the exercise of
this freedom in the interest of public decency and
morality. The relevant portion of the same has been
reproduced below:
“Article 19(1) (a): All citizens shall have a
right to freedom of speech and expression.
…(2) Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1)
shall affect the operation of any existing law,
or prevent the State from making any law,
insofar as such law imposes reasonable
restrictions on the exercise of the right
conferred by the said sub-clause in the
interests of 4[the sovereignty and integrity
of India,] the security of the State, friendly
relations with foreign States, public order,
decency or morality or in relation to
contempt of court, defamation or incitement
to an offence.]”

47.

A bare reading of the above shows that obscenity which is
offensive to public decency and morality is outside the
purview of the protection of free speech and expression,
because the Article dealing with the right itself excludes

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 26 of 74

it. Thus, any interpretation of ‘obscenity’ in the context of
criminal offences must be in consonance with the
constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression which
freedom is not confined to the expression of ideas that are
conventional or shared by the majority. Rather, it is most
often

ideas

which

question

or

challenge

prevailing

standards observed by the majority that face the greatest
threat and require the greatest protection as was so
observed in Ranjit Udeshi’s case (supra).
48.

The Supreme Court in Gajanan Visheshwar Birjur v. Union
of India (1994) 5 SCC 550, while dealing with an order of
confiscation

of

books

containing

Marxist

literature,

referred to the supremacy of the fundamental right of
freedom of speech and expression, and observed as
under:
"Before parting with this case, we must
express our unhappiness with attempts at
thought control in a democratic society like
ours. Human history is witness to the fact
that all evolution and all progress is because
of power of thought and that every attempt
at thought control is doomed to failure. An
idea can never be killed. Suppression can
never be a successful permanent policy. Any
surface serenity it creates is a false one. It
will erupt one day. Our constitution permits a
free trade, if we can use the expression, in
ideas and ideologies. It guarantees freedom
of thought and expression - the only
limitation being a law in terms of Clause (2)
of Article 19 of the Constitution. Thought
control is alien to our constitutional scheme.
To the same effect are the observations of
Robert
Jackson,
J.
in
American
Communications Association v. Douds 339 US
382, 442-43 (1950): 94 L Ed 925 with
reference to the US Constitution: 'Thought
control is a copyright of totalitarianism, and
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 27 of 74

we have no claim to it. It is not the function
of our Government to keep the citizen from
falling into error; it is the function of the
citizen to keep the Government from falling
into error. We could justify any censorship
only when the censors are better shielded
against error than the censored'."
(Emphasis supplied)
49.

As was also pointed out by Mr. Justice Holmes in
Abramson v. United States 250 U.S. 616:
"The ultimate good desired is better reached
by free trade in ideas-the best test of truth is
the power of the thought to get itself
accepted in the competition of the market."

Krishna Iyer, J., speaking for the Court in Raj Kapoor v.
State AIR 1980 SC 258, dealing with a pro bono publico
prosecution against the producer, actors and others
connected with a film called "Satyam, Shivam, Sundaram"
on the ground of prurience, moral depravity and shocking
erosion of public decency held that the censor certificate
is a relevant material, important in its impact, though not
infallible in its verdict and observed as under:
“…Art, morals and law's manacles on
aesthetics are a sensitive subject where
jurisprudence meets other social sciences
and never goes alone to bark and bite
because State-made strait-jacket is an
inhibitive prescription for a free country
unless
enlightened
society
actively
participates in the administration of justice to
aesthetics.
…The world's greatest paintings, sculptures,
songs and dances, India's lustrous heritage,
the Konarks and Khajurahos, lofty epics,
luscious in patches, may be asphyxiated by
law, if prudes and prigs and State moralists
prescribe
paradigms
and
prescribe
heterodoxies.”

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 28 of 74

High Court has said that there should be a substantial
allowance for freedom thus leaving a vast area for
creative art to interpret life and society with some of its
foibles along with what is good. Art and literature include
within themselves, a comprehensive view of social life and
not only in its ideal form.
52.

In S. Rangarajan’s case (supra), the Apex court dealt with
the aspect of censorship and held that freedom of
expression cannot be held to ransom, by an intolerant
group of people. The fundamental freedom under Article
19(1) (a) can be reasonably restricted only for the
purposes mentioned in Articles 19(2) and the restriction
must be justified. It was observed as under:
“The standard to be applied by the Board or
courts for judging the film should be that of
an ordinary man of common sense and
prudence and not that of an out of the
ordinary
or
hypersensitive
man.
We,
however, wish to add a word more. The
censors Board should exercise considerable
circumspection on movies affecting the
morality or decency of our people and
cultural heritage of the country. The moral
values in particular, should not be allowed to
be sacrificed in the guise of social change or
cultural assimilation. Our country has had the
distinction of giving birth to a galaxy of great
sages and thinkers. The great thinkers and
sages through their life and conduct provided
principles for people to follow the path of
right conduct. There have been continuous
efforts at rediscovery and reiteration of those
principles. …Besides, we have the concept of
"Dharam" (righteousness in every respect) a
unique contribution of Indian civilization to
humanity of the world. These are the bedrock
of our civilization 3 and should not be allowed
to be shaken by unethical standards. We do
not, however, mean that the Censors should
have an orthodox or conservative outlook.

change and they must go with the current
climate.”
53.

In Sakkal Papers (P) Ltd. v. Union of India AIR

“This Court must be ever vigilent in

Constitution, The resson for this is obvious.
The freedom of speech and expression of
opinion is of paramount importance under a

The Apex court in Ranjit Udeshi’s case (supra) while
answering the question in affirmative as to whether the
test as laid down of obscenity squares with the freedom of
speech

and

expression

guaranteed

under

our

Constitution, or it needs to be modified and, if so, in what
respects, pointed out as under:
“…The laying down of the true test is not
rendered any easier because art has such
varied facets and such individualistic appeals
that in the same object the insensitive sees
only obscenity because his attention is
arrested, not by the general or artistic appeal
or message which he cannot comprehend,
but by what he can see, and the intellectual
sees beauty and art but nothing gross.
…The test which we evolve must obviously
be of a general character but it must admit of
a just application from case to case by
indicating a line of demarcation not
necessarily sharp but sufficiently distinct to
distinguish between that which is obscene
and that which is not.”
“…A balance should be maintained between
freedom of speech and expression and public
decency and morality but when the latter is
substantially transgressed the former must
give way.”
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 30 of 74

55.

In so far as the scope of section 292 is concerned, from
the above discussion, it is clear that that for an offence to
be made out under the said section, its ingredients need
to be met. In the context of the present painting to be
deemed to be obscene, it has to satisfy at least one of the
three conditions: (i) if it is lascivious; (ii) it appeals to the
prurient interest, and (iii) it tends to deprave and corrupt
persons who are likely to read, see or hear the matter
alleged to be obscene. In addition to this, the relevance of
exceptions arises in excluding otherwise obscene matter
from the ambit of the criminal offence of obscenity and
such exceptions has no role to play in determination of
the obscenity of the impugned matter.

56.

The evolution of law in relation to the delicate balance
between artistic freedom viz-a-viz the right of speech and
expression while dealing with the question of obscenity
requires certain important norms to be kept in mind.

Contemporary standards
57.

In judging as to whether a particular work is obscene,
regard must be had to contemporary mores and national
standards. While the Supreme Court in India held Lady
Chatterley’s Lover to be obscene, in England the jury in
the case of R v. Penguin Books, Ltd. (1961) Crim. L.R. 176
acquitted the publishers finding that the publication did
not fall foul of the obscenity test. This was heralded as a
turning point in the fight for literary freedom in UK.

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 31 of 74

“Community mores and standards” played a part in the
Indian Supreme Court taking a different view from the
English jury. Judging the work as a whole
58.

A holistic view must thus be taken apart from a closer
scrutiny of the impugned subject to come to a conclusion
whether the same is grossly obscene and likely to deprave
and corrupt.

Aesthetic or artistic touch
59.

The work of art must have any aesthetic or artistic touch
and should not seem to have been taken with the sole
purpose of attracting viewers who may have a prurient
mind. In other words, where obscenity and art are mixed,
art must be so preponderating as to throw obscenity into
shadow or render the obscenity so trivial and insignificant
that it can have no effect and can be overlooked.

60.

Sex and obscenity are not always synonymous and it
would be wrong to classify sex as essentially obscene or
even indecent or immoral. The basic concern should be to
prevent the use of sex designed to play a commercial role
by making its own appeal.

61.

In relation to nude/semi-nude pictures of a woman it
would

depend

on

a

particular

posture,

pose,

the

surrounding circumstances and background in which
woman is shown.
Opinion of literary/artistic experts
62.

In Ranjit Udeshi’s case (supra) this Court held that the
delicate task of deciding what is artistic and what is

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 32 of 74

obscene has to be performed by courts and as a last
resort by the Supreme Court and, therefore, the evidence
of men of literature or others on the question of obscenity
is not relevant. However, in Samaresh Bose’s case (supra)
this Court observed:
“In appropriate cases, the court, for
eliminating any subjective element or
personal preference which may remain
hidden in the subconscious mind and may
unconsciously affect a proper objective
assessment, may draw upon the evidence on
record and also consider the views expressed
by reputed or recognised authors of literature
on such questions if there be any for his own
consideration and satisfaction to enable the
court to discharge the duty of making a
proper assessment.”
(Emphasis supplied)
Freedom of speech and expression
63.

In S. Rangarajan v. P. Jagjevan Ram and Ors. (1989) 2 SCC
574, while interpreting Article 19(2) this Court borrowed
from the American test of clear and present danger and
observed:
“Our commitment to freedom of expression
demands that it cannot be suppressed unless
the situations created by allowing the
freedom are pressing and the community
interest is endangered. The anticipated
danger should not be remote, conjectural or
far-fetched. It should have proximate and
direct nexus with the expression. The
expression of thought should be intrinsically
dangerous to the public interest. [In other
words, the expression should be inseparably]
like the equivalent of a ‘spark in a power
keg’.”
(Emphasis supplied)

64.

Public decency and morality is outside the purview of the
protection of free speech and expression, and thus a
balance should be maintained between freedom of speech

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 33 of 74

and expression and public decency and morality but the
former must never come in the way of the latter and
should not substantially transgress the latter.
Test of ordinary man
65.

The test for judging a work should be that of an ordinary
man of common sense and prudence and not an “out of
the ordinary or hypersensitive man”.

Social purpose or profit
66.

When

there

is

propagation

of

ideas,

opinions

and

information or public interests or profits, the interests of
society may tilt the scales in favour of free speech and
expression. Thus books on medical science with intimate
illustrations

and

photographs

though

in

a

sense

immodest, are not to be considered obscene, but the
same illustrations and photographs collected in a book
from

without

the

medical

text

would

certainly

be

considered to be obscene.
67.

Obscenity without a preponderating social purpose or
profit cannot have the Constitutional protection of free
speech or expression. Obscenity is treating with sex in a
manner appealing to the carnal side of human nature or
having that tendency. Such a treating with sex is offensive
to modesty and decency.

Test of strict liability
68.

Knowledge is not a part of the guilty act. The offender's
knowledge of the obscenity of the impugned matter is not
required under the law and it is a case of strict liability.

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 34 of 74

69.

It is also clear and apparent that the criminal offence of
obscenity is predicated upon the legal term of art and that
the legal test of obscenity cannot be equated with the
dictionary definition of obscenity which takes within its
fold anything which is offensive, indecent, foul, vulgar,
repulsive etc. In legal terms of obscenity, the matter
which offends, repels or disgusts does not thereby tend to
deprave or corrupt a person exposed to such matter and
cannot therefore, without more, be said to be obscene.

70.

To fall within the scope of ‘obscene’ under section 292 &
294 IPC, the ingredients of the impugned matter/art must
lie at the extreme end of the spectrum of the offensive
matter. The legal test of obscenity is satisfied only when
the impugned art/matter can be said to appeal to a
unhealthy, inordinate person having perverted interest in
sexual matters or having a tendency to morally corrupt
and debase persons likely to come in contact with the
impugned art.

71.

It must also be remembered that a piece of art may be
vulgar

but

not

obscene.

In

order

to

arrive

at

a

dispassionate conclusion where it is crucial to understand
that art from the perspective of the painter, it is also
important to picture the same from a spectator’s point of
view who is likely to see it.
72.

The learned counsel for the petitioner pleaded that the
impugned painting on the face of it contains no matter
capable of being held to be obscene in terms of the legal

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 35 of 74

test of obscenity delineated. It was thus submitted that in
the complaints filed against the petitioner, the allegation
of obscenity in terms of section 292 is sought to be
sustained on the basis of the nudity of the figure depicted
in the painting and the identity of the figure alleged as
‘Bharat Mata’. The alleged identity of the figure has no
bearing on the alleged obscenity of the said painting. The
alleged ‘Bharat Mata’ painting in issue was at no given
point in time either given a title or publicly exhibited by
the petitioner. The petitioner had no involvement in any
manner with the said on-line auction for charity.
73.

The learned counsel further went ahead and contended
that even if it is assumed that the said figure is ‘Bharat
Mata’, its identity as such does not contribute in any
manner to the painting being lascivious, or appealing to
the prurient interest, or tending to deprave and corrupt
persons who are likely to view the painting and that its
identity is irrelevant to the alleged obscenity of the
painting. This aspect is of some significance as the stage
for recording of defence evidence has not arrived and the
challenge is to the summoning orders.

74.

The submission made on behalf of the petitioner was that
the instant complaints were filed in the background of the
protests being led even when the petitioner had tendered
an apology which was so reported and the said painting
was withdrawn from the auction. It was also pointed out
that the complainants have selectively targeted the

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 36 of 74

petitioner for a painting which depicts nudity only in a
mild, stylized manner which according to him is hardly
graphic or anatomically precise especially taking into
consideration that the petitioner has repeated asserted
that nudity in his art is intended as an expression of purity
as also the fact that there have been even more graphic
depictions of nudity and sexuality, including hindu deities
and mythological figures in many contemporary and
ancient Indian art by the various artists concerned, some
of which have also been placed on record.
75.

The

complainants/respondents

in

Crl.

Rev.

P.

Nos.

114/2207 and 282/2007 have also alleged of an offence
u/s 294 and 298 IPC against the petitioner. Section 294
IPC reads as under:
“Section 294. Obscene acts and songs.
Whoever, to the annoyance of others(a) Does any obscene act in any public place,
or
(b) Sings, recites or utters any obscene song,
balled or words, in or near any public place,
Shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may
extend to three months, or with fine, or with
both.]”
76.

Section 294 IPC deals with the prevention of an obscene
act being performed in public to the annoyance of the
public. In this respect, the submissions made by the
petitioner was that to make out a case under the
aforesaid section the main ingredients of the section need
to be complied with which includes the impugned act to

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 37 of 74

be performed in a public place; the said act to be obscene
and lastly, to cause annoyance to others. The learned
counsel placing reliance on Narendra H. Khurana & Ors. v.
The Commisssioner of Police & Anr. 2004Cri. L.J. 3393
stated there is no prima facie case made out under the
aforesaid section since there is no disclosure made in the
complainants

of

any

immediate,

proximate

nexus

between the alleged annoyance of the complainants and
act done in a public place by the petitioner. The alleged
annoyance could have been by viewing the painting on
the internet and the only alleged act of the petitioner
having a nexus with the alleged annoyance is the
uploading of the painting on the website. It was also
pleaded that there could have been no ‘annoyance’
caused to the complainants by their viewing the said
painting

on

the

website

for

the

reason

that

the

complainants could have easily chosen not to view the
website any further.
77.

For the offence to be made out under section 298 IPC, the
accused must have a deliberate intention of wounding the
religious feelings of the complainant by uttering some
word or making some sound or a gesture or placing an
object in the sight of the complainant and it is the
contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that
the petitioner has done no such act which can fall under
the said purview. Section 298 IPC provides as under:
“Section 298. Uttering, words, etc., with

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 38 of 74

deliberate intent to wound the religious
feelings of any person
Whoever, with the deliberate intention of
wounding the religious feelings of any person,
utters any word or makes any sound in the
hearing of that person or makes any gesture
in the sight of that person or places any
object in the sight of that person, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to
one year, or with fine, or with both.”
78.

Akin to section 294 IPC, section 298 IPC also requires a
nexus between the impugned act and the alleged
deliberate intention of the petitioner to wound the
religious feelings of the complainants, which according to
the learned counsel is not so in the present case. It is the
case of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the
impugned

painting

cannot

form

the

basis

of

any

deliberate intention on the part of the petitioner to wound
the religious feelings of the complainants since the figure,
on the basis of the identity alleged, represents an
anthropomorphic depiction of the nation. It is also not a
religious depiction which is capable of offending the
‘Hindu’ religious feelings as alleged as also that the
concept of Bharat Mata is not the sole premise or belief of
Hindus alone. Learned counsel for the petitioner drew
strength from the judgments of Narayan Das & Anr. v.
State AIR 1952 Ori 149; Shalibhadra Shah & Ors. v. Swami
Krishna Bharati & Anr. 1981 Cri. L.J. 113 and Acharya
Rajneesh v. Naval Thakur & Ors. 1990 Cri.L.J. 2511 to
advance the proposition that a mere knowledge of the

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 39 of 74

likelihood that the religious feelings of another person
may be wounded would not be sufficient to hold a person
liable u/s 298 IPC.
79.

In addition to this, in Crl. Rev. P. No. 282/2007, the
offence u/s 500 IPC is also alleged against the petitioner.
It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner
that such offence cannot be made out against the
petitioner for the reason that the basic ingredient of the
offence of defamation being some imputation capable of
harming the reputation of the complainant is absent from
the complaint.

80.

On the other hand, the submissions made by the learned
counsel for the respondents was that the petitioner having
painted many contemporary and modern form of art in
the

past

owns

and

maintains

a

website

http./www.mfhussain.com where in the present case, the
said painting was uploaded for the purposes of sale with
the cause title “Mother India Nude Goddess”. It was
averred that the petitioner has placed nothing substantial
on record to show that the said website is not owned by
him. It was thus submitted that the painter's earlier
conduct has also been on the same lines while he painted
many hindu Gods/Godesses which resulted communal
disharmony but on his tendering an apology no further
action was taken. The argument advanced by the learned
counsel was that for the reason that no action was taken
against this painter earlier, he has now taken a further
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 40 of 74

liberty and went ahead to paint Bharat Mata depicting the
boundaries of our nation with names of the various states
on it and the national emblem i.e. the Ashoka Chakra. The
alleged Bharat Mata is depicted in nude in a manner
thereby making it obscene showing the different parts of
her body as different states of our country. It was also
contended that the painting depicts the Ashoka Chakra in
an objectionable manner showing disrespect to the same
which is covered under the provisions as envisaged in the
Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 and the
Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act,
1950.
81.

This act of the petitioner is alleged to have not only hurt
the feelings of Hindus who are in majority in India but also
every patriotic Indian who loves his mother land. Bharat
Mata is a symbol of pride, prestige, dignity and the soul of
this country and it was the case of the respondents that
the petitioner cannot be given the right to hurt the
sentiments and feelings of the society under the garb of
freedom of expression and that no one can be permitted
to have onslaught on such sensibilities. It was contented
that the standard set by the courts over the time have
given substantial freedom for the creative persons thus
leaving a vast area for creative art to interpret life and
society with some of its foibles along with what is good.
The line has to be drawn where the average man or a man
with morals begins to feel embarrassed or disgusted at a

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 41 of 74

naked portrayal of life without redeeming touch of art or
genuine or social value. It is a settled law that when the
question pertains to an individual's rights versus public
welfare, the rights of public at large prevails as so held in
Baragur Ramachandrappa & Ors. v. State of Karnataka
(2007) 3 SCC 11. It was submitted that since public
decency and moral values of the society are to be given
due consideration, making of nude picture of mother India
cannot be termed in any manner as in the interest of the
society or as an art having an aesthetic or artistic value.
82.

It was argued that place of the motherland is above
heaven which has been explicated by way of a sanskrit
shloka i.e. “Janani Janam Bhumisch Swargadapi Gariasi”.
The values and the ethics are so imbibed in an Indian that
the mother land is placed much above his own mother
and that is the reason why mothers in India never hesitate
in sacrificing their sons for the nation and the painter by
depicting mother India in nude has offended such
soldiers/sons sitting at the borders and their mothers.
Although, it might not have provoked feelings of lust but
has definitely provoked the feeling of hatred and hurt
nationalistic feelings of millions of Indians which can be
detrimental to our integrity and sovereignty.

83.

The learned counsel for the respondents laid emphasis on
the alleged previous/past misconduct of the petitioner
where the petitioner's paintings with the depiction of
Hindu Gods/goddesses in nude and erotic postures led to

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 42 of 74

widespread protests and agitations in masses. It was
pleaded that the past conduct can be used as an evidence
to prove that the petitioner had the mens rea to draw
such a painting in order to hurt the sentiments and
feelings of Indians as also that in such cases mens rea can
be gathered only by circumstantial evidence. In this
regard, the learned counsel drew the attention of this
court to the decision of the Apex court in State of
Karnataka v. Praveen Bhai Thogadia (Dr),(2004) 4 SCC
684, which has been reproduced as under:
“...Past conduct and antecedents of a person
or group or an organisation may certainly
provide sufficient material or basis for the
action contemplated on a reasonable
expectation of possible turn of events, which
may need to be avoided in public interest
and maintenance of law and order. No
person, however big he may assume or claim
to be, should be allowed, irrespective of the
position he may assume or claim to hold in
public life, to either act in a manner or make
speeches which would destroy secularism
recognised by the Constitution of India.
Secularism is not to be confused with
communal or religious concepts of an
individual or a group of persons. It means
that the State should have no religion of its
own and no one could proclaim to make the
State have one such or endeavour to create a
theocratic State. Persons belonging to
different religions live throughout the length
and breadth of the country. Each person,
whatever be his religion, must get an
assurance from the State that he has the
protection of law freely to profess, practise
and propagate his religion and freedom of
conscience. Otherwise, the rule of law will
become replaced by individual perceptions of
one’s own presumptions of good social order.
...Communal harmony should not be made to
suffer and be made dependent upon the will
of an individual or a group of individuals,
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 43 of 74

whatever be their religion, be it of a minority
or that of the majority. Persons belonging to
different religions must feel assured that they
can live in peace with persons belonging to
other religions.
...The valuable and cherished right of
freedom of expression and speech may at
times have to be subjected to reasonable
subordination to social interests, needs and
necessities to preserve the very core of
democratic life — preservation of public order
and rule of law. At some such grave situation
at least the decision as to the need and
necessity to take prohibitory actions must be
left to the discretion of those entrusted with
the duty of maintaining law and order, and
interposition of courts — unless a concrete
case of abuse or exercise of such sweeping
powers for extraneous considerations by the
authority concerned or that such authority
was shown to act at the behest of those in
power, and interference as a matter of course
and as though adjudicating an appeal, will
defeat the very purpose of legislation and
legislative intent.”
(Emphasis supplied)
84.

The learned counsel for the respondents relied upon the
judgment of Aveek Sarkar v. State of Jharkhand 2006 Cri.
L.J. 4211 where the manufacturer and the TV channels
were not held directly or indirectly responsible for the
pictures of God/goddesses being used for products on
television as distinguished from the present case where
the petitioner is directly responsible for making such
painting and uploading it on his own website thereby
infringing the rights of the complainants and many other
Indians.

85.

The petitioner himself opted for getting the complaints
cases filed against him to be transferred at one place and
therefore had approached the Supreme Court to pass

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 44 of 74

appropriate directions. But, even after that, it is alleged
that he has been flouting the law and refraining himself
from the process of court on some or the other pretext
and has filed the present revision petitions also with the
same objective. In such a case, thus, the petitioner should
not be entitled to any discretionary relief u/s 482 of the
said Code which as per the settled law has to be exercised
only in rarest of rare cases to prevent abuse of court or
miscarriage of justice.
86.

It was submitted that the matters at hand are being tried
under certain provisions of the Indian Penal Code but that
cannot be a reason to scuttle the proceedings on such
technical grounds, specially when sections can be added
or subtracted at any later stage of the proceedings as was
held in Dinesh Bharat Chand Sankla v. Kurlon Limited &
Ors. 2006 Cri.L.J. 261.

87.

The learned counsel argued that it is not the case that the
impugned painting was put up for display in some art
gallery or private exhibition, instead it was uploaded on
his own website which could be accessed by any person
and any common man who is a patriot would get affected
by the said picture. Hence, the yardstick to determine
whether the painting is obscene or not should be seen
from the mindset of the society as a whole and not of a
particular 'class'.

88.

The plea raised on behalf of the respondents was that the
present petitions filed by the petitioner is at a premature

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 45 of 74

stage since evidence has to be led and parties have to be
heard for determination of the case and that quashing the
said proceedings at the threshold at such nascent stage
would not be appropriate.
89.

It was also averred that when the petitioner can make the
deliberate act of outraging the sentiments of his fellow
nationals by drawing such painting at the fag end of his
life then he might as well be punished for such act if so
held

guilty.

Thus,

the

petitioner

cannot

take

the

advantage, excuse and defense of his old age.
90.

It was brought to the notice of this court that the State
also in this regard has preferred to maintain its silence
thereby not performing its duty and if this situation
prevails, then anarchy would follow as a consequence. It
is the bounden duty of the state to generate faith in the
minds and hearts of its citizens so that they feel that their
rights would be protected and that they would be given
equitable justice.

Judicial scrutiny and abuse of process
91.

It was contended that the complaints made in all the
revision petitions bear a striking similarity to one another
and hence have been used as a tool to harass the
petitioner which amounts to gross abuse of the process of
the court. It was submitted that where the avenue of filing
a

private

complaint

directly

before

the

magistrate

provides a salutary and invaluable remedy to a genuine
complainant seeking redressal, easy recourse to such a
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 46 of 74

procedure as a convenient substitute to filing a complaint
with the police also makes the remedy susceptible to
misuse.

In

a

police

complaint

case,

prior

to

the

summoning of an accused, the Magistrate has the benefit
of a police report. Such a safeguard in favour of the
accused ought not to be circumvented merely by taking
recourse to the private complaint procedure and therefore
the suggestion put forward by the learned counsel is that
only in appropriate cases should a private complaint case
proceed further without a prior investigation by the police
consequent upon the direction of the Magistrate u/s
156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the said Code
for short) in the matter.
92.

It was further submitted that in case the magistrate feels
appropriate to take cognizance of an offence, he still has
the discretion u/s 202 of the Code to postpone the issue of
process against the accused and either enquire himself
into the case or direct investigation to be made by the
police or by such other person he deems fit, for the
purposes of deciding whether or not there is sufficient
ground for proceeding u/s 204 of the Code. In this regard,
reliance was placed on Pepsi Foods Ltd. v. Special Judicial
Magistrate,

(1998)

5

SCC

749

and

Naganagouda

Veeranagouda Patil & Anr. v. Special Judicial Magistrate &
Ors. 1998 Cri.L.J. 1707 where it has been observed that
summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious
matter. Criminal law cannot be set into motion as a
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 47 of 74

matter of course. The order of the Magistrate summoning
the accused must reflect that he has applied his mind to
the facts of the case and the law applicable thereto. He
has to examine the nature of allegations made in the
complaint and the evidence both oral and documentary in
support thereof and would that be sufficient for the
complainant to succeed in bringing charge home to the
accused. It is not that the Magistrate is a silent spectator
at the time of recording of preliminary evidence before
summoning of the accused. The Magistrate has to
carefully scrutinise the evidence brought on record and
may even himself put questions to the complainant and
his witnesses to elicit answers to find out the truthfulness
of the allegations or otherwise and then examine if any
offence is prima facie committed by all or any of the
accused.
93.

In Punjab National Bank v. Surendra Prasad Sinha, 1993
Supp (1) SCC 499, the court held as under:
“…judicial process should not be an
instrument of oppression or needless
harassment.
…There lies responsibility and duty on the
Magistracy to find whether the concerned
accused should be legally responsible for the
offence charged for. Only on satisfying that
the law casts liability or creates offence
against the juristic person or the persons
impleaded then only process would be
issued. At that stage the court would be
circumspect and judicious in exercising
discretion and should take all the relevant
facts and circumstances into consideration
before issuing process lest it would be an
instrument in the hands of the private
complaint as vendetta to harass the persons

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 48 of 74

needlessly. Vindication of majesty of justice
and maintenance of law and order in the
society are the prime objects of criminal
justice but it would not be the means to
wreak personal vengeance.”
(Emphasis supplied)
94.

It was stated that under section 200 the magistrate is
cast upon with a duty to take cognizance of an offence
only upon oath of the complainant and the witnesses
present therein to proceed u/s 204 Cr.P.C. The said
requirement must not be treated as a mere formality,
especially when the proceedings at that stage are exparte. It was thus contended that in the absence of a
police report, ordinarily, unless a Magistrate is satisfied
that the complaint provides the necessary facts and
details and is adequately supported by pre-summoning
documentary oral evidence, an enquiry u/s 202 may
not be instituted. It was pointed out that a further
safeguard

has

been

provided

through

a

recent

amendment by the Act 25 of 2005 w.e.f. 23-06-2006 to
section 202 of the said Code wherein it is now
obligatory on the Magistrate to postpone issue of
process against the accused where the accused is
residing at a place beyond the area in which he
exercises jurisdiction.
95.

The submission made by the learned counsel on behalf
of

the

respondents

was

that

the

legal

position

enunciated by the learned counsel for the petitioner
cannot be disputed but the process against the

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 49 of 74

petitioner in the present cases was initiated only after
recording the statement of the complainants and
hearing the arguments on the same and thus it cannot
be said that the Ld. Magistrate had not applied his
judicial mind before issuing process.
96.

I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and
given deep thought to the matter keeping in mind the
importance of the legal principles raised in this matter.
A perusal of the complaints and the material placed on
record show that the narrow questions which need
consideration of this court are that whether an artist
like in the present case be given the liberty to paint a
nation in the context of motherland in nude and
whether such a painting would be considered as
obscene

or

not.

In

the

trial

proceedings,

only

summoning orders have been passed till now, thus the
determination of the above said questions shall be
based on certain assumptions that the painter had
made the said painting portraying Mother India in nude
titled 'Mother India Nude Goddess' and put up on the
website owned by the artist himself.
97.

In order to examine the matter closely, the impugned
painting itself has been reproduced below:

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 50 of 74

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 51 of 74

98.

In the conspectus of the legal principles enunciated and
discussed aforesaid both of India and across the globe,
the legal tests governing the law on obscenity are clear.
On applying the said tests governing obscenity, in my
considered view, the said painting cannot be said to fall
within the purview of section 292 thereby making it
obscene. The impugned painting on the face of it is
neither lascivious nor appeals to the prurient interests. At
the same time, the person who is likely to view the said
painting would not tend to be depraved or corrupted. In
other words, the said painting would not arouse sexual
interest in a perverted inordinate person or would not
morally corrupt and debase a person viewing the said
painting. Though some might feel offended or disgusted
at the very inception of seeing the alleged Mother India in
nude but that by itself and nothing more in my opinion is
not sufficient to qualify the test of obscenity. The said
painting depicting India in a human form in no manner
has that tendency to make an average person feel
embarrassed by naked portrayal of a concept which has
no particular face to it since the painting has not lost its
artistic value/touch.

99.

An attempt to understand the said painting from the
artist's/petitioner's perspective would show

how

the

painter by way of an abstract expression has tried to
elucidate the concept of a nation in the form of a
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 52 of 74

distressed woman. No doubt, the concept of a nation has
had a long association with the idea of motherhood but
just because the artist has expressed it in nude does not
make the painting obscene per se thereby satisfying the
test that nudity or sex alone cannot be said to be
obscene. If the painting is looked as a whole, it would
reveal that that the revulsion referred to by learned
counsel for the respondents of patriotic nationals would
not arise for the reason that except the fact that it is in
nude, there is nothing which can be considered as
pinching to the eye. As a matter of fact, the aesthetic
touch to the painting dwarfs the so called obscenity in the
form of nudity and renders it so picayune and insignificant
that the nudity in the painting can easily be overlooked.
100. Once Hans Hofmann said and I quote, “A work of art is a
world in itself reflecting senses and emotions of the
artist's world.” To put it differently in the words of Edward
Hopper, “Great art is the outward expression of an inner
life in the artist.” If the above holds true, then it would not
be wrong to suggest that the petitioner is pained by the
growing untold misery of our nation and made an attempt
to bring the same out on a canvass. The artist's creativity
in this painting is evident from the manner in which the
artist by way of a tear and ruffled, unkempt, open hair of
the woman tried to portray the sad and the dispirited face
of our nation who seems to have suffered a great deal of
anguish and agony. A woman's sorrow has been described
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 53 of 74

by the way the woman is lying with her eyes closed, with
one arm raised on her face and a tear dropping from the
eye. The object of painting the woman in nude is also part
of the same expression and is obviously not to stimulate
the viewer's prurience but instead to shake up the very
conscious of the viewer and to invoke in him empathy for
India and abhorrence for the culprits. The person who may
view the painting is likely to react in tears, silence or
analogous to the same but no way near the feelings of
lust. There can be many interpretations to the painting.
One of the interpretations to it can be to show the
disconsolate India which is entangled in various problems
like

corruption,

criminalisation,

crisis

of

leadership,

unemployment, poverty, over population, low standard of
living, fading values and ethics etc. The other can be that
Bharat Mata is perhaps just used as a metaphor for being
so bereft because of the earthquake which occurred
around the time when this painting was made. Other than
this, the bold use of colour and the depiction of the great
range of Himalayas by way of the hair flowing of the
women restores the artistic touch in the painting.
101. One of the tests in relation to judging nude/semi nude
pictures of women as obscene is also a particular posture
or pose or the surrounding circumstances which may
render it to be obscene but in the present painting, apart
from what is already stated above, the contours of the
woman's

body

represent

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

nothing

more

than

the

Page 54 of 74

boundaries/map of India. There can be a numbers of
postures or poses that one can think of which can really
stimulate a man's deepest hidden passions and desires.
To my mind, art should not be seen in isolation without
going into its onomatopoetic meaning and it is here I
quote Mr. Justice Stewart of the US Supreme Court in
Jacobellis v. Ohio 378 U.S. 184 (1964) who defined
‘obscenity’ as, “I will know it when I see it”. The nude
woman in the impugned painting is not shown in any
peculiar

kind

of

a

pose

or

posture

nor

are

her

surroundings so painted which may arouse sexual feelings
or that of lust in the minds of the deviants in order to call
it obscene. The placement of the Ashoka Chakra or the
States in the painting is also not on any particular body
part of the woman which may be deemed to show
disrespect to the Ashoka Chakra/States and the same was
conceded by the learned counsel for the respondent
during the course of the arguments advanced. Even if a
different view had to be taken that if the painter wanted
to depict India in human form, it may have been more
appropriate to cloth the woman in some manner may be
by draping a sari or by a flowing cloth etc., but that alone
cannot be made a ground to prosecute the painter. It is
possible that some persons may hold a more orthodox or
conservative view on the depiction of Bharat Mata as
nude in the painting but that itself would not suffice to
give rise to a criminal prosecution of a person like the
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 55 of 74

petitioner who may have more liberal thoughts in respect
of mode and manner of depiction of Bharat Mata. The very
theme of our Constitution encompassing liberty, equality
and fraternity would abhor the non tolerance of another
view. The judge also must not apply his more liberal or
conservative view in determining this aspect but should
place himself in the shoes of the painter and endeavor to
decipher the theme and thought process of the painter
who created the painting. It would always be prudent for
the judge to err on the side of a liberal interpretation
giving the scheme of our Constitution.
102. The learned counsel had vehemently argued that the
petitioner

is

a

habitual

offender

who

gets

into

controversies and uses it as a tool of publicity. He had
offended the feelings of a particular sect of people by
painting such pictures in the past also by depiction of
Hindu Gods/Goddesses in nude. His conduct has been
such that he cannot be pardoned. It was pleaded that the
petitioner uses nudity just as a gimmick and to gain
mileage over others.
103. In my considered view, the alleged past misconduct of the
petitioner cannot have any bearing on the present case
because there has been nothing which has come on
record to prove the converse. It is made clear that the
paintings depicting Hindu Gods/Goddesses in nude by the
petitioner do not form a subject matter of the present
case and as such the learned counsels have been unable
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 56 of 74

to bring to the notice of this court any cases/complaints
pending or decided in this regard to go against the
petitioner. The persons who may feel aggrieved by those
set of paintings have an appropriate remedy in law to get
their rights redressed. Hence, commenting on those
paintings would be prejudging the said paintings and
passing a verdict on the same thus prejudicing the rights
of the accused/petitioner.
104. There are a few paintings brought on record which
provide a glimpse of the ancient Indian art showcasing the
absence of inhibition and guilt and the candour and
boldness with which our society set out seeking its
pleasures.5 Other than this, the literature of India both
religious and secular is full of sexual allusions, sexual
symbolisms and passages of such frank eroticism the likes
of which are not to be found elsewhere in world
literature.6 Hinduism being the world’s oldest religious
tradition, incorporates all forms of belief and worship
without necessitating the selection or elimination of any.
The Hindu is inclined to revere the divine in every
manifestation, whatever it may be, and is doctrinally
tolerant. A Hindu may embrace a non-Hindu religion
without ceasing to be Hindu, and since the Hindu is
disposed to think synthetically and to regard other forms
of worship, strange gods, and divergent doctrines as

inadequate rather than wrong or objectionable, he tends
to believe that the highest divine powers complement
each other for the well-being of the world and mankind.
The core of religion does not even depend on the
existence or non-existence of God or on whether there is
one god or many. Since religious truth is said to transcend
all verbal definition, it is not conceived in dogmatic terms.
Hinduism is then both a civilization and a conglomerate of
religions with neither a beginning, a founder, nor a central
authority, hierarchy, or organization.7
105. The conundrum which has blocked the minds of a few
today was given a riposte by Swami Vivekananda in the
following words8:
“...we tend to reduce everyone else to the
limits of our own mental universe and begin
privileging our own ethics, morality, sense of
duty and even our sense of utility. All
religious conflicts arose from this propensity
to judge others. If we indeed must judge at
all, then it must be `according to his own
ideal, and not by that of anyone else'. It is
important, therefore, to learn to look at the
duty of others through their own eyes and
never judge the customs and observances of
others through the prism of our own
standards.”
106. It would not be proper to hold that the painter/petitioner
had a deliberate intention to manifestly insult Bharat Mata
which is clear from his various interviews and reports
placed on record where he has consistently maintained

that he actually celebrates nudity and considers it as the
purest form of expression. It also cannot be lost sight of
that he had immediately withdrawn the said painting from
the auction and apologised to those offended, thus
making it clear that his is only an artistic impulse. Under
the criminal jurisprudence, for an offence to be made out
against an accused, the ingredients of mens rea and actus
reas need to be proved. In the present case, since the
scope of the subject is so limited, it does not really require
any evidence to be led and on the face of it, both the
elements i.e. mens rea and actus reas appear to be
absent.
107. I am unable to accept the plea raised by the learned
counsel for the respondents that the said painting
uploaded on a website could be accessed by any person
sitting across the globe who in consequence whereto
could get affected by viewing the same. There can be no
exasperation caused by viewing such painting on the
website for the reason that a person would firstly access
such a website only if he has some interest in art and that
too contemporary art and in case he does view such a
website, he always would have the option to not to view
or

page.

It

seems

that

the

complainants are not the types who would go to art
galleries or have an interest in contemporary art, because
if they did, they would know that there are many other
artists who embrace nudity as part of their contemporary

art. Hence, the offence alleged u/s 294 IPC can not be
made out. Similarly, the ingredients of section 298 IPC as
alleged are not met since there seems to be no deliberate
intention on the part of the petitioner to hurt feelings of
Indians as already stated and as a matter of fact, the
subject matter i.e Bharat Mata could be alleged to wound
nationalist feelings of an individual and not any religious
feelings. I am in agreement with the contention raised by
the learned counsel for the petitioner that the impugned
painting cannot form the basis of any deliberate intention
to wound the religious feelings of the complainants since
the figure, on the basis of the identity alleged, represents
an anthropomorphic depiction of a nation as also that to
hold a person liable under the above said section, mere
knowledge of the likelihood that the religious feelings of
another person may be wounded would not be sufficient.
108. Section

500

IPC

requires

the

basic

ingredient

of

defamation to be satisfied which seems to be completely
absent in the present case.
109. From the dawn of civilization, India has been home to a
variety of faiths and philosophies, all of which have coexisted harmoniously. The then Chief Justice S.R. Das in In
Re: Kerala Education Bill 1957 AIR 1958 SC 956 speaking
of the Indian tradition of tolerance observed as under:
“...Throughout the ages endless inundations
of men of diverse creeds, cultures and races
— Aryans and non-Aryans, Dravidians and
Chinese, Scythians, Huns, Pathans and
Mughals — have come to this ancient land
from distant regions and climes. India has
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 60 of 74

welcomed them all. They have met and
gathered, given and taken and got mingled,
merged and lost in one body. India’s tradition
has thus been epitomised in the following
noble lines:
“None shall be turned away
From the shore of this vast sea of humanity
That is India”
110. Consensus and accommodation have formed a significant
and integral part of Indian culture and cornerstone of our
constitutional democracy. In the context of obscenity,
community mores and standards have played a very
significant role in the past with the Indian courts. Indian
art has always celebrated the female form. There is
nothing salacious about it. Gloria Stienem, a feminist
scholar and writer, once made a salient point about the
problem behind obscenity:
"Sex is the tabasco sauce that an adolescent
national pallet sprinkles on every dish on the
menu."
We have been called as the land of the Kama Sutra then
why is it that in the land of the Kama Sutra, we shy away
from its very name? Beauty lies in the eyes of the
beholder and so does obscenity. It is our perception to
objects, thoughts and situations, which rule the mind to
perceive them in the way we do. Way back then, perhaps
it would not be wrong to assume that the people led
exotic lives dedicated to sensuality in all its forms. It was
healthy and artistic. They studied sex, practiced sex,
shared techniques with friends, and passed on their
secrets to the next generation. All in good spirit. Sexual
pleasure was not behind closed doors or a taboo; it was in
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 61 of 74

the air in different forms. There was painting, sculpture,
poetry, dance and many more. Sex was embraced as an
integral part of a full and complete life.9 It is most
unfortunate that India's new 'puritanism' is being carried
out in the name of cultural purity10 and a host of ignorant
people are vandalizing art and pushing us towards a prerenaissance era.
111. We are at such a juncture where for the purposes of
introspection, for looking both inwards and outwards,
there is a lot to be learnt from the past and the same to
be implemented in the future. India is one such pluralist
society which acts a model of unity in the mosaic of
diversities and has taught the world the lesson of
tolerance by giving shelter to the persecuted and
refugees of all religions and all nations. The standards of
the contemporary society in India are fast changing and
therefore, now in this age of modernization, we should
more so embrace different thinking and different thoughts
and ideas with open arms. But while an artist should have
his creative freedom, he is not free to do anything he
wants. The line which needs to be drawn is between the
art as an expression of beauty and art as an expression of
an ill mind intoxicated with a vulgar manifestation of
counter-culture where the latter needs to be kept way

112. Plato once asked, “What do men organise themselves into
the society for?” and answered, “To give the members of
the society, all the members, the best chance of realizing
their best selves”. This is the very purpose of social
organisation. All human beings incomplete in themselves
seek their ordainment of fulfillment and destiny in the
enriching human company and democracy provides the
richest and the most profound opportunities of that
mutual enrichment.11
113. Democracy has wider moral implications than mere
majoritarianism. A crude view of democracy gives a
distorted picture. A real democracy is one in which the
exercise of the power of the many is conditional on
respect for the rights of the few. Pluralism is the soul of
democracy. The right to dissent is the hallmark of a
democracy. In real democracy the dissenter must feel at
home and ought not to be nervously looking over his
shoulder fearing captivity or bodily harm or economic and
social sanctions for his unconventional or critical views.
There should be freedom for the thought we hate.
Freedom of speech has no meaning if there is no freedom
after speech. The reality of democracy is to be measured
by the extent of freedom and accommodation it extends. 12

take deep roots and have its efflorescence only in a
climate where all display an attitude of tolerance and a
spirit of moderation. 13
115. Our Greatest problem today is fundamentalism which is
the triumph of the letter over the spirit.14 In a free
democratic society tolerance is vital especially in large
and complex societies comprising people with varied
beliefs and interests. An intolerant society does not brook
dissent.

our Indian Psyche and tradition. It must be realised that
intolerance has a chilling, inhibiting effect on freedom of
thought and discussion. The consequence is that dissent
dries up. And when that happens democracy loses its
essence.15
116. Our Constitution by way of Article 19 (1) which provides
for freedom of thought and expression underpins a free
and harmonious society. It helps to cultivate the virtue of
tolerance. It is said that the freedom of speech is the
matrix, the indispensable condition of nearly every other
form of freedom. It is the wellspring of civilization and

117. Every

time

an

artist

portrays

something

different,

something which is an unpopular view point, it may
accompany discomfort and unpleasantness but that in
itself cannot be a ground to curb the artistic freedom and
quickly go on to label it as obscene. There might be
people who may actually get offended by those of
Hussain's paintings or others but the right course of action
for them, is to simply shrug it off or protest peacefully. In
my considered view, criticism of art may be there. Rather,
there are many other more appropriate avenues and fora
for expression of differences of opinion within a civil
society. But criminal Justice system ought not to be
invoked as a convenient recourse to ventilate any and all
objections to an artistic work. It should not be used as a
mere tool in the hands of unscrupulous masters which in
the process can cause serious violations of the rights of
the people especially taking into consideration the people
in the creative fields. Such a pernicious trend represents a
growing intolerance and divisiveness within the society
which

pose a threat to the democratic fabric of our

nation. It would be relevant to reproduce the observations
made by Markandey Katju J. in Himsa Virodhak Sangh v.
Mirzapur Moti Kuresh Jamat & Ors. JT 2008 (3) SC 421
where laying stress on the importance of tolerance, the
court gave the historical illustration of Emperor Akbar's

“These days unfortunately some people
seem to be perpetually on a short fuse, and
are willing to protest often violently, about
anything under the sun on the ground that a
book or painting or film etc. has “hurt the
sentiments” of their community. These
dangerous tendencies must be curbed. We
are one nation and must respect each other
and should have tolerance.”
(Emphasis Supplied)
Thus, the practice of tolerance in our multi-religious,
multi-cultural nation must be regarded as a fundamental
duty of every citizen and must be actively encouraged
and performed if we are to make our pluralist democracy
a living robust.17
118. In this regard, the role of the magistrates and judicial
scrutiny in protecting individual rights and freedoms and
promoting constitutional values is not discretionary but
obligatory. In a constitutional democracy wedded to and
governed by the rule of law, responsibilities of the
judiciary arouse great expectations.18 Justice Frankfurt
once remarked:

process. Its applications to the actualities of

Government is not a mechanical exercise,
but a high function of statecraft.”
Thus, a magistrate must scrutinise each case in order to
prevent vexatious and frivolous cases from being filed and
make sure that it is not used a tool to harass the accused
which will amount to gross abuse of the process of the
court.

himself into the case or direct investigation to be made by
the police or by such other person as he deems fit, for the
purposes of deciding whether or not there is sufficient
ground for proceeding u/s 204 of the Code. He must
examine the nature of allegations made in the complaint
and the evidence both oral and documentary in support
thereof and may even himself put questions to the
complainant and his witnesses to elicit answers to find out
the truthfulness of the allegations or otherwise and then
examine if any offence is prima facie committed by all or
any of the accused as enunciated in

119. The general principles laid down of the duties to be
performed by the Magistrate before issuing summons are
all the more applicable in matters pertaining to art,

to

prevent

any

unnecessary

harassment of persons from the creative fields where
liberal thought processes permeate. We have had the
scenario of painters, actors, writers, directors and theatre
personalities being dragged to court on account of a
mechanical exercise of issuance of summons ignoring the
pressures created on such persons implicit in the process
of issuance of summons. The result would be that that
apart from the harassment element there would be
growing fear and curtailment of the right of the free
expression in such creative persons. This is hardly a
desirable or an acceptable state of affairs.
120. In the end, it may be said that education broadens the
horizons of the people and means to acquire knowledge to
enhance one's ability to reason and make a sound
judgment. However, when one is instructed to only view
things in a certain manner, regardless of truth and facts,
this is actually a form of programming - not education.19

thoughts should not be curtailed by the age old moral
sanctions of a particular section in the society having
oblique or collateral motives who express their dissent at
the every drop of a hat. The society instead should be
engaged in more meaningful activities which would go to
show the importance of education over plain literacy.
121. In view of the aforesaid, the summoning orders and
warrants of arrest issued against the petitioner in the
complaint cases are quashed and the revision petitions
filed against them are allowed leaving the parties to bear
their own costs.
Jurisdiction
122. During the course of the hearing, the learned counsel for
the parties were even confronted with a general question
as to which court would be considered as a competent
court having the jurisdiction to try the matter particularly
when the nature of the case is like the present one where
the

impugned

painting

uploaded

on

the

website,

accessible to people across the globe, was being viewed
by different people/complainants across the country who
in turn got offended with such painting and filed their
complaints at various places in India, especially keeping in
mind the vexatious and the frivolous complaints which
can be filed as an instrument to harass the accused. In
the present case, the petitioner is a celebrated artist who
can afford the costs borne out of such litigation but what
about those who are not in a position to expend that
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 69 of 74

much of an amount and are unnecessarily foisted with
such liability and harassment.
123. Learned ASG accepted and submitted that as such our
Criminal Code does not deal with such jurisdictional
aspect directly and submitted that the answer only rested
in the power conferred to the Supreme Court of India
under section 406 of the said Code which procedure has
been adopted in the present case and reads as under:
“406. Power of Supreme Court to
transfer cases and appeals. (1) Whenever
it is made to appear to the Supreme Court
that an order under this section is expedient
for the ends of justice, it may direct that any
particular case or appeal be transferred from
High Court to another High Court or from a
Criminal Court subordinate to one High Court
to another Criminal Court of equal or superior
jurisdiction subordinate to another High
Court.
(2) The Supreme Court may act under this
section only on the application of the
Attorney General of India or of a partly
interested, and every such application shall
be made by motion, which shall, except when
the applicant is the Attorney-General of India
or the Advocate-General of the State, be
supported by affidavit or affirmation.
(3) Where any application for the exercise of
the powers conferred by this section is
dismissed, the Supreme Court may, if it is of
opinion that the application was frivolous or
vexatious, order the applicant to pay by way
of compensation to any person who has
opposed the application such sum not
exceeding one thousand rupees as it may
consider appropriate in the circumstances of
the case.”
(Emphasis supplied)
124. The sum and substratum of the his submissions was that
Chapter XIII of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 governs
the law relating to the jurisdiction of courts with respect to
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 70 of 74

inquiries and trial and under section 177 of the said Code,
every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by
a court within whose local jurisdiction it was committed.
Section 178 provides that when it is uncertain in which of
the several local areas an offence was committed or
where an offence is committed partly in one local area
and partly in another or is a continuing one and continues
to be committed in more local areas or one or consists of
several acts done in different local areas, in such cases
then it may be tried and inquired by a court having
jurisdiction over any of such local areas.
125. Section 179 of the Code reads as follows:
“179. Offence triable where act is done
or consequence ensues.—When an act is
an offence by reason of anything which has
been done and of a consequence which has
ensued, the offence may be inquired into or
tried by a Court within whose local
jurisdiction such thing has been done or such
consequence has ensued.”
126. As per section 179 of the Code, in case of an act which is
an offence because of the ensuing consequences either
the Court where the act was committed or where the
consequences ensued will have jurisdiction. Under the
above provision, it is not necessary to prove that things
done must necessarily be an offence, as the conjunction
“and”

used

in

this

section

suggests

that

the

act

contemplated becomes an offence on account of the
cumulative

effect

of

the

things

done

and

the

consequences ensued. In Ashok v. State of U.P 2005 Cri

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 71 of 74

L.J. 2324 where a leader of a political party made insulting
remarks against a particular religious community in an
interview to weekly magazine having all India circulation,
the Court held that the Courts either in the place where
interview was given or in the place where consequences
of these interviews ensued, had jurisdiction to try the
offence. In S. Bangarappa v. Ganesh Narayan 1984 Cri L.J.
1618

conference were published in the newspaper in the same
place and on the next day, in a newspaper in a different
place, it was held that the Court in second place had the
jurisdiction to try the offense.
127. Section 186 of the said Code provides that in cases where
two or more courts have taken cognizance of the same
offence then the High Court will resolve the doubt relating
the jurisdiction of the one of those courts to proceed with
the matter in the following manner:
a. where the courts are subordinate to the same High
Court, that High Court;
b. where the courts are not subordinate to the same
High Court, then the High Court within whose appellate
jurisdiction the proceedings were first commenced.
128. In Kuljit Singh v. CBI 2000 CriLJ 3681, a case was
registered based on a report from the Indian Ambassador
in Greece regarding the incident of a high sea tragedy on
the night intervening 24/25 December 1996 in which 170

were

also

registered in District Hoshiarpur, Punjab. The Court in this
case applied Section 186 CrPC and held that the CMM,
Delhi would alone be competent to inquire into and try the
offences in question.
129. In

my

considered

view,

this

particular

aspect

of

jurisdiction fettered within the parameters of scrutiny of
section 202 of the said Code as discussed above derives
its

importance

especially

with

the

advent

of

the

technological explosion where a person sitting anywhere
across the globe can get access to what ever information
he has been looking for just with a click of a mouse.
Therefore,

it

has

become

imperative

that

in

this

information age, jurisdiction be more circumscribed so
that an artist like in the present case is not made to run
from pillar to post facing proceedings. It was found
necessary to at least examine this aspect in view of the
large number of incidents of such complaints which had
been brought to light by press resulting in artists and
other creative persons being made to run across the
length and breath of the country to defend themselves
against criminal proceedings initiated by oversensitive or
Crl. Rev. P. Nos.282/07; 114/2007 & 280/2007

Page 73 of 74

motivated persons including for publicity. This however is
not an aspect where a direction can be issued since it is
within the domain of appropriate legislation. The learned
ASG while assisting this court fairly stated that he would
advice

the

Government

to

take

steps

by

way

of

appropriate legislative amendments as may be proper
keeping in mind the balancing of interest between the
person aggrieved and the accused so as to prevent
harassment of artists, sculptors, authors, filmmakers etc.
in different creative fields. I say nothing more but hope
that this aspect would get the attention it deserves and
the legislature in its wisdom would examine the feasibility
of possible changes in law.
Epilogue

130. A liberal tolerance of a different point of view causes no
damage. It means only a greater self restraint. Diversity in
expression of views whether in writings, paintings or visual
media encourages debate. A debate should never be shut
out. 'I am right' does not necessarily imply 'You are wrong'.
Our culture breeds tolerance- both in thought and in actions.
