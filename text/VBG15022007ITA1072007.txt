Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (in short 'Tribunal').
2.

Brief facts of the case are that Assessee has been

engaged in manufacturing of rubberised cork sheets since
2nd January, 1992.

For assessment year 2001-02, in

respect of its profit from industrial concern, the deduction
was claimed under Section 80-IA @30% of its profit. The
Assessing Officer

declined the Assessee's claim holding

that the items manufactured by the Assessee comes under
Eleventh Schedule at Sl.No.27 & 28, and these items are of
packaging and fittings. The contention of the Assessee that
the Department has allowed deduction in respect of the
same very product in assessment year 1998-1999 was
declined on the plea that every assessment year is a
separate assessment year, therefore, the contention of
Assessee was not found acceptable.
3.

The Commissioner of Income Tax(A) confirmed the

order of Assessing Officer by observing that the Assessee is
a small scale industrial undertaking which has started
manufacturing on 2nd January, 1992 which is much before
than 1st April, 1995 as mentioned in Sub-section 3(ii) of
Section 80-IB.
ITA No.107/2007

The plea of the Assessee that it is also
Page 2 of 9

covered under sub-section 3(i) has got no force and merit
because clause 3(i) is for the industrial undertakings which
are not small scale industrial undertakings.
4.

The Tribunal vide its impugned order reversed the

finding of Commissioner Income Tax(A) holding that the
Assessee is entitled for deduction for ten years from the
date of start of its production, which was 2nd January,
1992.

The year under consideration is assessment year

2001-2002, which is very well within a period of 10 years
from the first year from which the Assessee is entitled for
deduction under Section 80-IA. Tribunal further held that
in the earlier assessment year, the Assessing Officer has
allowed

the

deduction

and

during

the

year

under

consideration, there is no change in the facts and
circumstances as the Assessee continued to manufacture
the same very product. It was further held that though the
principle of res judicata does not apply to the provisions of
the Income Tax, but at the same time, it is equally true that
unless there is a change of circumstance, the authorities
will not depart from the previous decisions at their sweet
will in the absence of material circumstances or reasons
ITA No.107/2007

Page 3 of 9

for such departure.

Thus, the rule of consistency which

applies to the Income Tax proceedings has to be followed.
5.

Being dissatisfied with the order of the Tribunal, the

present appeal has been filed by the Revenue on the
grounds that the Assessee is not entitled to benefit under
Section 80-IA of the Act since the Assessee is engaged in
the production of articles/goods mentioned in the negative
list/Eleventh Schedule of serial No.27 & 28 and the benefit
of deduction is allowed to small scale units only when they
begin to manufacture goods during the period for which
the benefit is available and as the Assessee started
manufacturing the said goods only from 2nd January, 1992,
i.e., before benefit was allowable to such small scale units,
hence the case of Assessee does not fall within the proviso
to the exclusion clause contained to Section 80-IA of the
Act and plea of consistency is not applicable, as each year
is distinct and separate and Assessing Officer is required to
determine whether benefit or deduction is available for
each year.

6.

The Assessing Officer has disallowed the deduction

ITA No.107/2007

Page 4 of 9

claimed under Section 80IA of the Act on the ground that
the Assessee is a manufacturer of rubberized cork sheet
and rubber product. So it is covered in the list of things
specified in the list of Eleventh Schedule as mentioned at
Sl.No.27 & 28 therein.
7.

Whereas, Commissioner Income Tax(A) in its order

dated 21st July, 2003 held that, the Appellant's case is not
covered under the provisions of sub-section 3(ii) of Section
80IB because it has started production before 1st day of
April, 1995.
8.

On the other hand, the Tribunal vide impugned order

held that :“In view of the proviso to clause (iii)
of Section 80-IA, we do not find any
justification in the action of the AO
for declining deduction, insofar as
there is no dispute to the fact that
the Assessee was a small scale
industrial undertaking and a finding
to this effect has also been recorded
by the lower authorities and a
relevant certificate was also filed
before the AO during the course of
assessment proceedings on 5.2.03.
The objection of the CIT(A) for
confirming the disallowance was that
the Assessee
is not covered by
Section 80-IB since it started
production much
prior to the
ITA No.107/2007

Page 5 of 9

9.

provisions of Section 80-IB having
come into force. In this case the
Assessee is entitled for deduction for
ten years from the date of start of its
production, which was 2.1.92. The
year under consideration is AY 200102, which is very well within the
period of 10 years from the first year
from which the Assessee is entitled
for deduction u/s 80-IA.
We are,
therefore, inclined to reverse the
finding and conclusion of the lower
authorities for allowing deduction to
the
Assessee
u/s
80-IA,
notwithstanding the fact that product
manufactured by the Assessee was
coming under Eleventh Schedule.
By virtue of the Finance Act, 1992, amendment has

been made in Section 80-IA of the Act and these
amendments have taken effect from 1st April, 1993 and
accordingly, shall apply in relation to assessment year
1993-94 and subsequent years. Thus Section 80-IA is not
applicable to assessment year 2001-02 for which the
present appeal has been filed.
10.

The present case falls under Section 80-I of the Act

and the relevant portion of this Section reads as under:“S.80-I. Deduction in respect of
profits and gains from industrial
undertakings after a certain date,
etc.-(1) Where the gross total income
of an assessee includes any profits
and gains derived from an industrial

Page 6 of 9

undertaking or a ship or the business
of a hotel (or the business of repairs
to ocean-going vessels or other
powered craft) to which this section
applies, there shall, in accordance
with and subject to the provisions of
this section, be allowed, in computing
the total income of the assessee, a
deduction from such profits and
gains of an amount equal to twenty
per cent. thereof:
Provided that in the case of an
assessee, being a company, the
provisions of this sub-section (shall
have effect in relation to profits and
gains derived from an industrial
undertaking or a ship or the business
of a hotel) as if for the words “twenty
per cent.”, the words “twenty-five per
cent.” had been substituted.
(1A)..........
(2) This section applies to any
industrial undertaking which fulfills
all the following conditions namely:(i)it is not formed by the splitting up,
or the reconstruction, of a business
already in existence;
(ii) it is not formed by the transfer to
a new business of machinery or
plant previously used for any
purpose;
(iii) it manufactures or produces any
article or thing, not being any
article or thing specified in the list
in the Eleventh Schedule, or
operates one or more cold storage
plant or plants, in any part of India,
and begins to manufacture or

Page 7 of 9

produce articles or things or to
operate such plant or plants, at any
time within the period of (fourteen
years) next following the 31st day
of March, 1981, or such further
period as the Central Government
may, by notification in the Official
Gazette, specify with reference to
any
particular
industrial
undertaking;
(iv) in a case where the industrial
undertaking
manufactures
or
produces articles or things, the
undertaking employs ten or more
workers
in
a
manufacturing
process carried on with the aid of
power, or employs twenty or more
workers
in
a
manufacturing
process carried on without the aid
of power:
Provided that the condition in clause
(i) shall not apply in respect of any
industrial undertaking which is
formed as a result of the reestablishment,
reconstruction
or
revival by the assessee of the
business of any such industrial
undertaking as is referred to in
section 33B, in the circumstances
and within the period specified in
that section:
Provided further that the condition in
clause (iii) shall, in relation to a
small-scale industrial undertaking,
apply as if the words “not being any
article or thing specified in the list in
the Eleventh Schedule” had been
omitted.

Explanation 1: .............”
11.

Since,

Assessee

was

a

small

scale

industrial

undertaking and started its production on 2nd January,
1992, so the Assessee is

entitled for deduction for the

assessment year 2001-02.
12.

In the result, since no substantial question of law

arises, the present appeal is hereby dismissed.
