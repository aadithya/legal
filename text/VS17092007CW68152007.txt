VIPIN SANGHI, J. (Oral)
The Petitioner was appointed as a Daily Wage Peon on
01.1.2002 in the office of the Minister of State (Agro & Rural
Industries). His services were dis-continued on 23.6.2004.

He

represented to the Respondents against the dis-continuation of his
services, which was rejected by the Respondents on 7th July 2004. He
approached the Tribunal by filing O.A. No. 2735/2004, which has been
disposed of by the impugned order dated 23.08.2005. The Tribunal, in

view of the winding up of the office of the former Ministry, has directed
the Respondents to engage the Petitioners as and when the vacancies
were available in preference to juniors and freshers in any other
Department or the Ministries. The grievance of the Petitioner is that
despite the said directions, the Respondents are not giving any
appointment to the Petitioner.
Admitted case of the Petitioners is that they were engaged
only as daily wagers and no recruitment process was resorted to.
Consequently, the Petitioners have no legal right to claim appointment
in view of the decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court
in Secretary, State of Karnataka,vs. Uma Devi, 2006 (4) SCC 1.
We find no merit in this petition. The petition and the
application stands dismissed.
