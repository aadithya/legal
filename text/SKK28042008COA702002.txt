SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J. (Oral)
1. A petition for winding up of M/s National Chemical Industries
Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the said company) was
filed before this Court and a winding up order was passed
on 19.2.1981.

The scheme propounded u/s 391 of the

Companies Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as the said
Act) was sanctioned by the Company Judge on 1.3.1983 to
facilitate revival of the said company. It is stated that the
order sanctioning the scheme provided for no alienation of
immovable properties and the Official Liquidator was made

as the observer to supervise and report on the progress of
revival

and

implementation

of

the

scheme.

The

consequence of this order was stated to be the stay of the
winding up order.
2. It is the case of the appellant that the company was actually
never revived in pursuance to the scheme and the Official
Liquidator failed to report the non-revival.
3. The appellant and his mother were the shareholders of the
said company in terms of an arrangement arrived at and the
shares were sought to be transferred. The appellant and his
mother were objecting to the scheme and it is in those
circumstances that the orders are stated to have been
passed on 24.9.1984.
4. The appellant moved an application for release of the
amount of Rs.50,000/- out of Rs.1.00 lac retained in respect
of the liability of the Estate Duty.

The application was

accompanied by a Estate Duty certificate.

The appellant

also claimed interest on the amount of Rs.50,000/-.

This

application was opposed on behalf of the company.

The

appellant claims that in terms of the order dated 30.8.1991,
the Registry was directed to release Rs.50,000/- and
interest thereon to the appellant but only a sum of
Rs.50,000/- was released on 28.10.1991 but not the interest
contrary to the mandate of the order dated 30.8.1991. The
appellant, thus, moved C.A.746/1991 for release of the
Co.Appeal 70/02

Page 2 of 6

amount along with interest @16% P.A. on the sum of
Rs.50,000/-. It is stated that this application was disposed
of by an order dated 9.1.1992 without any order for release
of the amount. The review application was also disposed of.
5. The

appellant

once

again

moved

an

application

C.A.797/1992 for release of interest as the amount of
Rs.50,000/- is stated to have been paid to the appellant.
The interest was claimed for the period 6.12.1984 till date in
terms of the order dated 30.8.1991.
6. The appellant claims that in C.A.797/1992 an order came to
be passed that the interest was to be calculated on the
amount of recovery for the period of stay obtained by the
respondent company and the office was directed to
calculate the interest. The office calculated the interest for
the period of 6 years and 10 months but not for the stay
period.

The appellant, thus, moved C.A.788/1995.

The

Company Court by the order dated 26.7.1996 directed the
release of Rs.54,666/- being the interest calculated by the
Registry. The respondent is stated to have carried out the
matter

further

right

till

the

Supreme

Court,

but

unsuccessfully.
7. The appellant kept on agitating the grievance and in terms
of

the

impugned

order

dated

12.11.2002

passed

in

C.A.788/1995 the prayer of the appellant for any higher
multiplier/period for grant of interest has been rejected.
Co.Appeal 70/02

8. The appellant has been heard in person. The orders passed
by the learned Company Judge show that the appellant was
opposing the scheme of rehabilitation and in view of the
interest of the appellant and his mother by reason of
holding of shares, the shares were sought to be transferred
on payment of consideration of Rs.8.00 lacs as per an
agreed order with interest. The amount of Rs.1.00 lacs was,
however, detained on account of the Estate Duty liability
arising from the demise of the father of the appellant
Mr.Girdhara Singh (whose shares were inherited by the
appellant and his mother) and the appellant moved
C.A.759/1983 attempting to wriggle out of the settlement.
The said request was not acceded to in terms of the order
dated 30.1.1984.

The mother of the appellant, Smt.Piar

Kaur, also passed away in November, 1985.

A perusal of

the order itself shows that the application arose out of the
increase in the value of land and machinery of the company
but the plea was rejected on the ground that the same
cannot be the basis for re-consideration which would also
have been the position if the price had gone down.
9. An amount of Rs.1.00 lac was detained towards the Estate
Duty clearance as is apparent from the order dated
6.12.1984 and the same was to await the final certificate to
be produced by the applicants. The order thereafter passed
on 30.8.1991 again makes the position clear that in view of
Co.Appeal 70/02

Page 4 of 6

the Estate Duty clearance certificate in respect of the estate
of late Shri Girdhara Singh out of which the appellant and
his mother had to receive payment, 50% of the amount
retained along with interest was to be released and the
balance was to be detained in Court.

On 6.7.1993 the

appellant prayed that interest may be paid on diminishing
basis and the Registry was directed to calculate interest on
diminishing basis. The order dated 28.4.1995 provided that
the respondent would have to deposit the interest on the
amount which was stayed. The calculations of the Registry
show that the payment of Rs.50,000/- was given to the
petitioner on 28.10.1991 which was actually due on
6.12.1984.

There was, thus, a delay of 6 years and 10

months and interest of 16% P.A. was calculated on the said
amount. The noting is dated 16.10.1995.
10.

The aforesaid facts and circumstances show that the
appellant and his mother were paid the due amounts for the
transfer of shares and only a sum of Rs.1.00 lac was
detained that too for production of the Estate Duty
certificate.

On production of the certificate, 50% of the

amount of Rs.50,000/- along with interest was directed to be
paid. The appellant kept on making grievance in respect of
the interest.

The calculation of interest is based on the

period of delay which is from 1984 to 1991 and the amount
along with the interest have been paid @16% P.A. We, thus,
Co.Appeal 70/02

Page 5 of 6

see no merit in the plea of the appellant that there is any
other or further interest due and payable to the appellant
apart from the staleness of the claim of the appellant.
Another connected appeal, bearing Co. Appeal No.35/2006
has been dismissed today which also showed an endeavour
of the appellant to somehow keep the issues alive even
though the claim of the appellant stood satisfied.
11.

We see no reason to interfere with the effect of the order in
appeal since the appellant has been paid the principal
amount as also the interest for the period of delay. What
the appellant seeks is to appropriate the payment towards
the overdue interest first instead of the principal amount
but that is not what the arrangement envisaged. Thus, the
principal amount having been paid, interest has been
calculated on the principal amount for the period of delay,
which also stands paid.

12.

There is no merit in the appeal.

13.

Dismissed.
