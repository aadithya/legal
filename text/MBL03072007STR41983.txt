MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
The following references have been made to this Court by the
Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal under Section 45(1) of the Delhi Sales
Tax Act, 1975 read with Section 9(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act,
1956:
STR No.4/1983 – assessment year 1971-72
STR No.8/1980 – assessment year 1972-73
STR No.9/1980 – assessment year 1973-74
STR No.13/1987 – assessment year 1974-75
STR No.14/1987 – assessment year 1975-76
2.

Learned counsel for the parties informed us that the

questions of law raised in all these references are substantively the same
and so we took up STR No.4/83 for hearing. Our opinion in this
reference will govern the other references as well.

STR No.4/1983

Page 3 of 13

3.

The following three questions of law have been referred for

our opinion:
“(i) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was right in holding that the sales made to
M/s. New Bharat Chemical Industries and M/s Vaish
Brothers by delivery of the goods ex-works at Najafgarh
Road, Delhi, were in the course of inter-state trade or
commerce liable to sales tax under the provisions of the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956?
(ii) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case,
the Tribunal was right in holding that if the petitioner-dealer
wishes to contend that certain goods did not move outside
Delhi, the matter being particularly in his knowledge, the
onus would be on him to prove it?
(iii) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was right in disallowing the oral prayer of
the petitioner that alternatively he be allowed an opportunity
to furnish declarations in Form-C before the Assessing
Authority?”
4.

In so far as the first question is concerned, we answer it in

the affirmative, in favour of the Revenue and against the Assessee. The
second question was not pressed by learned counsel for the Assessee
and so we decline to answer it. In any event, since we answer the first
question affirmative, it must follow that the second would also have to
be answered in the affirmative. The third question is now infructuous
since by an order dated 10th May, 1982 on a review/rectification

STR No.4/1983

Page 4 of 13

application filed by the Assessee, the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal
granted the Assessee an opportunity to furnish declarations in Form C
before the Assessing Authority.
5.

The broad facts of the case, as they appear from the paper

book, are that the Assessee sold, in Delhi, chemicals such as caustic
soda and sulphuric acid to its sole distributors/selling agents, namely,
Vaish Brothers (for sale in the State of Uttar Pradesh) and New Bharat
Chemical Industries (for sale in Ludhiana in the State of Haryana).
Although the chemicals were sold by the Assessee to these dealers in
Delhi, they could sell them only to their customers in the territories
allotted to them, that is, in the State of U.P. and in Ludhiana. The
Tribunal (in its order dated 19th March, 1982) concluded that, under
these circumstances, the sales were made in the course of inter-state
trade and would attract central sales tax.

6.

It appears that during the hearing of the case before the

Tribunal, an oral prayer was made by the Assessee to the effect that the
matter may be remitted back to the Assessing Authority since part of the
goods had been locally sold by the dealers. The Tribunal rejected the
oral prayer and so the Assessee filed a review/ rectification application
STR No.4/1983

Page 5 of 13

on which the Tribunal ordered (on 10th May, 1982) that the matter would
be remitted back to the Assessing Authority before whom the Assessee
“shall adduce evidence …. to show that the goods of a particular value
which had been sold to these two dealers were locally sold and had not
been transferred to branches outside Delhi or sold in places outside
Delhi. In all other respects the appeal stands dismissed.” It is in view of
this direction that the third question has effectively become infructuous.

7.

In response to the first question of law, learned counsel for

the Assessee contended that the goods are sold in Delhi to its dealers
and possession of the goods is also handed over to them in Delhi and as
such the sale transaction is complete in Delhi. The Assessee has no
knowledge what the dealer does with the goods and does not know
where the goods are eventually sold by the dealer. On this basis, it was
submitted that the sale of chemicals by the Assessee to its dealers is not
an inter-state sale but a local sale.

8.

In the statement of case, it has been mentioned that the

contention of the Assessee was (and this was reiterated before us) that
its dealers dispose of the goods by:STR No.4/1983

Page 6 of 13

(i)

making outright sales to the customers in Delhi, or

(ii)

selling the goods in the course of inter-state trade and
commerce from their establishment in Delhi to their
customers outside Delhi, or

(iii)

transferring

the

goods

to

their

branch/head

office/

establishment out of Delhi.

The submission of the Assessee was that the dealers are not under any
obligation to remove or take away the goods to their territories outside
Delhi and the sales are complete, as against the Assessee, as soon as the
delivery is given ex-works at Delhi.

9.

Learned counsel for the Assessee cited several judgments

before us including Endupuri Narasimhan and Son v. State of Orissa,
[1961] 12 STC 282, Coffee Board, Bangalore v. Joint Commercial
Tax Officer, Madras, [1970] 25 STC 528 and Tata Engineering and
Locomotive Co. Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Tax,
[1970] 26 STC 354 but we find that these have been considered by a
Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in State of Bihar & Another
v. Tata Engineering & Locomotive Co. Ltd., [1971] 27 STC 127. The
STR No.4/1983

Page 7 of 13

Supreme Court, after considering these and various other decided cases,
held that sales will be considered as being in the course of export or
import or sales in the course of inter-state trade and commerce under the
following circumstances:(i)

when the goods which are in export or import stream are
sold;

(ii)

when the contracts of sale or law under which goods are sold
require those goods to be exported or imported to a foreign
country or from a foreign country, as the case may be, or are
required to be transported to a State other than the State in
which the delivery of goods takes place; and

(iii)

where as a necessary incidence of the contract of sale goods
sold are required to be exported or imported or transported
out of the State in which the delivery of goods takes place.

The Supreme Court noted the well-established position in law, stated
unambiguously, that where under the terms of a contract of sale, the
buyer is required to remove the goods from the State in which he
purchased those goods to another State and when the goods are so
moved, the sale in question must be considered as a sale in the course of
STR No.4/1983

Page 8 of 13

inter-state trade or commerce.

10.

In view of this explicit statement of law by the Supreme

Court, what we are first required to see in the present case is whether
there was any obligation on the dealers to take the goods out of Delhi.

11.

The Tribunal has noted the terms and conditions of the

contract (which was before it) between the Assessee and the dealers
wherein in terms of clause (2), the territory in which the dealers could
sell the goods was stated, and in so far as delivery of the goods is
concerned, clause (7) of the agreement provided that all supplies would
be made on ex-works basis and the dealer shall take local delivery of the
goods at the factory gate and arrange to store them in their godowns in
Delhi. In the event the dealer is desirous of transporting the goods to
the territory outside Delhi, the Assessee would charge freight charges
and also be liable for central sales tax. The contract between the parties
clearly made out that the goods were to be moved outside Delhi and that
was one of the conditions of the sale.

A breach of the agreement

resulted in a penalty on the dealer, that is, forfeiture of the security
deposit of Rs.1,000/- given by the dealer to the Assessee. This being the
STR No.4/1983

Page 9 of 13

position, there is no doubt in our minds that as a necessary incidence of
the contract of sale, the goods were required to be transported out of the
State (that is Delhi) in which the delivery of goods took place, and so
the sale was an inter-state sale and the decision rendered by the Tribunal
in this regard is correct in law.

12.

Section 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, reads as

follows:
“3. When is a sale or purchase of goods said to take
place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place
in the course of inter-State trade or commerce if the sale or
purchase (a) occasions the movement of goods from one State to
another; or
(b) is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the
goods during their movement from one State to another.
Explanation 1. - Where goods are delivered to a carrier or
other bailee for transmission, the movement of the goods
shall, for the purpose of clause (b), be deemed to commence
at the time of such delivery and terminate at the time when
delivery is taken from such carrier or bailee.
Explanation 2. - Where the movement of goods commences
and terminates in the same State it shall be deemed to be a
movement of goods from one State to another by reason
merely of the fact that in the course of such movement the
goods pass through the territory of any other State.”
STR No.4/1983

Page 10 of 13

Clause (a) of Section 3 above was the subject of interpretation by the
Supreme Court in Balabhagas Hulaschand & Another v. State of
Orissa, [1976] 37 STC 207 in which the Supreme Court held that
Section 3(a) of the Act would be applicable if the following facts were
established:(i)

that there is a sale or purchase of goods, and

(ii)

that the sale occasions the movement of goods from one State
to another.

If these two conditions are satisfied, the sale becomes an inter-state sale
on which tax could be levied under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.

13.

The expression “occasions the movement of goods” was

considered by the Supreme Court in K.G. Khosla & Co. (P) Ltd. v.
Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Madras Division,
Madras, [1966] 17 STC 473 wherein reliance was placed upon Tata
Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. V. S.R. Sarkar, [1960] 11 STC 655 in which it
was held that a sale “occasions” the movement of goods from one State
to another within Section 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 when
the movement is the result of a covenant or incident of the contract of
STR No.4/1983

Page 11 of 13

sale. The expression “occasions the movement of goods” is, therefore,
obviously referable to the agreement between the parties which
necessitates the movement of goods from one State to another. As we
have mentioned above, on the facts of this case, the contract between the
parties relating to the sale of goods is that “occasion” which results in
the movement of goods from Delhi to the territories in which the dealers
may sell them in terms of the contract.

14.

The expression “movement of goods” was adverted to by the

Supreme Court in Oil India Ltd. v. The Superintendent of Taxes and
Others, [1975] 35 STC 445 and it was observed that it has been held in
a number of cases that if the movement of goods from one State to
another is the result of a covenant or an incident of the contract of sale,
then the sale is an inter-state sale. Reference was made to Tata Iron
and Steel Co. Ltd. and State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Caltex (India)
Ltd., [1966] 17 SCT 612.

15.

In view of the clear position in law, we answer the first

question in the affirmative, in favour of the Revenue and against the
Assessee.
STR No.4/1983

Page 12 of 13

16.

In so far as the third question is concerned, it is possible, as

contended by learned counsel for the Assessee, that the dealers may
have breached the terms of the contract and sold the chemicals in Delhi
and not in the territories allotted to them. If that is the position, then the
Assessee would of course not be obliged to pay central sales tax on the
sale of those goods and as held by the Tribunal in the review/
rectification order dated 10th May, 1982, the Assessee may adduce
evidence before the Assessing Authority to show that the goods were
locally sold by the dealers and had neither been transferred to branches
outside Delhi or sold in territories outside Delhi. No further orders are
required to be passed in this regard except that the Assessee will now
appear before the Assessing Authority on 23rd July, 2007 for directions
and the Assessing Authority would then fix a schedule for dealing with
this contention of the Assessee.

17.

All the references stand disposed of as above.
