1.

This petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India

is directed against the order dated 28.6.1999 passed by the Central
Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (the Tribunal) in
O.A. No. 1992/97 whereby the original application filed by the
petitioner has been dismissed.

WP(C) 7370/99

2.

Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner joined the

office of Respondent No. 3 i.e. Ministry of Industry on temporary basis
as Lower Division Clerk (LDC) on 24.3.1956. In 1964 he was
transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture. He applied for the post of
Inspector in the Central Fisheries Corporation Ltd.(CFCL for short), a
Central Public Sector Undertaking(PSU for short) under the Ministry of
Agriculture, through proper channel. Permission was granted and
pursuant to his selection order, he tendered his technical resignation
and joined the CFCL.
3.

Petitioner requested the respondent for grant of pro-rata

pensionary benefits on the basis of the service rendered by him with
the Respondents. However his claim was rejected vide respondent's
letter dated 27.2.1997. In this background, petitioner preferred the
aforesaid O.A. No. 1992/97 before the Tribunal praying for grant of
pro-rata pensionary benefits.
4.

The petitioner had relied upon DOPT OM No.28016/5/85-

Estt.(C) dated 31.1.86 whereby the requirement of holding a
permanent post had been done away with. The Tribunal concluded
that the aforesaid OM could not come to the aid of the Petitioner since
the same had been specifically made effective from 6.3.1985.

The

Tribunal also relied upon the Supreme Court decision in Union Of
India v. V.R. Chadha reported as (1997) 11 SCC 242, wherein it was
held that the petitioner not having been absorbed in the PSU in public
WP(C) 7370/99

Page 2 of 7

interest, the benefit of T.S. Thiruvegadam v. Secretary to
Government of India and Ors.,(1993) 2 SCC 174 could not be
made available to him. Relying upon the said decision the ld. Single
Member dismissed the O.A. preferred by the petitioner vide its
impugned order dated 28.6.1999.
5.

It may be noted that at the time when the Petitioner had

joined service there was no provision for allowing pro-rata pensionary
benefit. Subsequently, vide OM dated 16.6.67, permanent Central
Govt.

Employees

on

deputation/transfer

to

PSUs

upon

their

permanent absorption in a PSU in public interest, were made eligible
for receiving pro-rata pensionary benefits. However, this benefit was
restricted only to those who were absorbed on or after June 16, 1967.
There were two more OMs dated 8.11.68 and 21.4.72 on the subject
leading to D.O.P.T. O.M. No. 28016/4/76-Estt(C) dated 25.3.1977
whereby Govt. Servants who were deputed/transferred and then
absorbed, or had joined of their own volition in a PSU, on or after
8.11.1968 were made eligible for pro-rata retirement benefits.
However the actual financial benefits were allowed only from
1.8.1976.

Therefore,

the

distinction

between

deputationists/transferees who were absorbed in a PSU in public
interest and those who joined the PSU of their own volition post
8.11.1968 was obliterated. However, the cut-off date of 8.11.68 was
still maintained to make eligible those employees who had joined the

WP(C) 7370/99

Page 3 of 7

PSU of their own volition. The categorization of pensioners, i.e., those
who were absorbed prior to June 16, 1967 and those who were
absorbed after the said date, was declared unconstitutional by the
Apex Court in T.S. Thiruvengadem's case (supra). Thereafter, the
Government, issued OM dated 3.1.1995, extending the benefit of
prorata pension to even those Government servants, who had joined
Public Sector Undertakings prior to 16.6.67 subject to certain
conditions.
6.

In Union of India and Ors. v. O.P. Sharma and

Anr.,2002 III AD (Delhi) 37, prorata pensionary benefit has been
extended by this Court even to a person who had moved to PSUs prior
to 8.11.1968 of his own volition. In the said case this Court upheld the
grant of prorata pensionary benefits to an ex-employee of CPWD who
moved to ONGC of his own accord on 30th June 1961 i.e. much before
the petitioners case. One of us (A.K. Sikri, J.) observed and we quote:
“The learned Tribunal also noted that the
aforesaid OM was subsequently followed by
another OM dated 16th June, 1967 which
provided that those absorbed in PSUs etc
after 16th July, 1967 would be entitled to
prorata pensioin and DCR Gratuity but this
was conditional on the transfer of government
servants to the PSUs etc being in the public
interest. Thus public interest remained the
guiding factor upto this stage. However, after
consideration the government removed this
condition of absorption by the PSU in the
public interest and by DOPT's OM dated 21st
April, 1972 laid down that those appointed in
PSUs etc on their own application will also be
governed by the aforesaid orders of the
WP(C) 7370/99

Page 4 of 7

Ministry of Finance dated 8th November,
1968, the effect of which would be to give
benefit to those who were absorbed
permanently in PSUs on or after 21st April,
1972.”
7.

The above passage was quoted with approval in Shri K.K.

Dhir Vs. Union of India and Ors.,W.P.(C ) No. 5562/2002, also decided
by a division Bench of this Court on 24.11.2006. In the said decision it
was observed that:
“So far as the cut off dates fixed by the
Government are concerned, following D.S.
Nakara (supra) and Thiruvengadam (supra), it
stands concluded that such classification on
the basis of a cut off date which is fixed
without any rationate would be arbitrary.
Therefore, merely because the petitioners
case pertains to 1965/1966, he cannot be
denied prorata pension, if otherwise he fulfills
the requirements for grant of this benefit. So
far as the twin conditions that (i) the
Government Servant should have been first
transferred/deputed to the PSU and thereafter
got absorbed in the PSU, as opposed to his
movement of his own volition and (ii) his
movement to the PSU should have been
declared in Public Interest, is concerned, the
same have also been relaxed by the
Government from time to time, as would
appear from the Government O.Ms of 1968,
1972, 1977 and 1991. Once these conditions
have been relaxed, it does not stand to
reason that these relaxations should be only
from and after a cut off date, which has no
rational basis.”
8.

It was held that the relaxation introduced by these OM’s

would be applicable to all such Government servants who joined PSUs
even before such arbitrarily fixed cut off dates, irrespective of a
WP(C) 7370/99

Page 5 of 7

declaration of their move being in Public Interest having been made
or not, would be entitled to prorata pension. Thus, the Tribunal clearly
fell in error on both counts, i.e., insisting on a declaration that the
joining was in public interest and that the OM dated 31.1.86 would
not be applicable to the Petitioner.
9.

We may also note the GOI, DOP & AR, OM No.28.10.1984

Pension Unit dated the 29th August 1984 paras 3(a)(i), 6 and 7 of
which are relevant and read as follows:
“(i) Where a Central Government employee
borne on pensionable establishment is
allowed to be absorbed in an Autonomous
Body, the service rendered by him under the
Government shall be allowed to be counted
towards pension under the Autonomous Body
irrespective of whether the employee was
temporary or permanent in Government. The
pensionary benefits will, however, accrue only
if the temporary service is followed by
confirmation. If he retires as a temporary
employee in the Autonomous Body, he will
get terminal benefits as are normally
available to temporary employees under the
Government.”
“6.
These orders will be applicable only
where the transfer of the employee from one
organization to another was/is with the
consent of the organization under which he
was serving earlier, including cases where the
individuals had secured employees directly on
his own volition, provided he had applied
through
proper
channel/with
proper
permission of the administrative authority
concerned.”
“7.
[These order will take effect from the
date of issue, viz., 29th August 1984. The
benefits under these orders should also be
WP(C) 7370/99

Page 6 of 7

extended to all those who had retired prior to
the issue of these orders and who are
otherwise eligible for the benefit of counting
of service thereunder. The arrears of pension,
if any, which become due to the concerned
pensioners, would be disbursed to them with
effect from 29.8.1984 only and that they
would not be entitled to get any relief in
respect of the period prior to 29.8.1984.]”
10.

Therefore, the petitioner was clearly entitled to the grant

of prorata pensionary benefit.
11.

Thus, we allow this petition and the impugned order dated

28.6.1999 is quashed. The respondents are directed to grant the
benefit of prorata pension to the petitioner and pay the arrears of
pension to him within three months of passing of this order. If the
arrears are not paid within three months, the petitioner would be
entitled to interest @ 6% per annum for any further delay in making
payment. The respondents are also directed to regularly pay the
prorata pension henceforth beginning 1.01.2008.
