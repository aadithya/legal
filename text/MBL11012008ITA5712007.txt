MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
The Revenue is aggrieved by an order dated 8th June,
2006 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench

ITA No.571/2007

Page 1 of 8

‘B’, New Delhi in ITA No.1886/Del/2003 relevant for the
assessment year 1990-91.

2.

The grievance of the Revenue relates to the deletion of

penalty by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) as well as
by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The penalty was imposed
by the Assessing Officer under Section 271(1)(c) of the Income
Tax Act, 1961 (for short the Act).

3.

The Assessee claimed depreciation on a biogas plant

and that was disallowed by the Assessing Officer on the ground
that the plant had not started giving the end product, that is,
biogas during the relevant previous year but only from the
subsequent accounting year. According to the Assessing Officer,
by claiming depreciation in the assessment year 1990-91, the
Assessee had furnished inaccurate particulars for reducing its tax
liability and was, therefore, liable to be penalized.

4.

The Commissioner reversed the Assessing Officer by

holding that the Assessee had not furnished inaccurate
particulars. At best, it was a case of rejection of the Assessee’s
explanation for a claim of depreciation and, therefore, the case

ITA No.571/2007

Page 2 of 8

would not be covered by Section 271(1)(c) of the Act.

5.

The Tribunal held that the Assessee is really a distillery

unit and in terms of the provisions of the Water (Prevention and
Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, it was mandatory for the Assessee
to treat its effluent before discharging the same either on the
ground or in a drain or a water body.

The Assessee had

employed Swiss technology for treatment of the distillery effluent
and it so transpires that the technology is such that it also helps in
producing biogas which could be utilized by the Assessee for its
business of running a distillery.

6.

Possession of the effluent treatment plant was handed

over to the Assessee on 20th March, 1990 and the Assessee
immediately put it to use on 21st March, 1990 by filling the main
reactor with water and providing media for injecting seed
material and development of bio-cell for methane gas generation.
The required quantity of sludge, that is, industrial waste was also
added to the plant.

7.

According to the Assessee, since the process was

technical and biological, it took some time for the biological

ITA No.571/2007

Page 3 of 8

reaction to stabilize and the actual manufacture of biogas started
in the subsequent year, that is, 1991-92.

8.

The Assessee claimed depreciation on the ground that

since the effluent treatment plant had been put to use for its
business purposes, and even though the gestation period resulted
in production of biogas only in the subsequent assessment year,
that would not deprive the Assessee from claiming depreciation.

9.

On the above reasoning, the Tribunal accepted the view

of the Commissioner and set aside the levy of penalty by the
Assessing Officer. According to learned counsel for the Revenue
before us, the imposition of penalty was fully justified since the
Assessee had furnished inaccurate particulars and was liable
under Section 271(1)(c) of the Act.

10.

We are not in a position to agree with learned counsel

for the Revenue. In the first instance, it must be noted that the
business of the Assessee was not that of manufacture of biogas. It
was a distillery and the Assessee was required by law to treat the
effluent before discharging it.

It just so transpires that the

technology used by the Assessee for treatment of effluent was

ITA No.571/2007

Page 4 of 8

capable of enabling the Assessee to produce biogas. Manufacture
of biogas was not the business of the Assessee but was ancillary
to the treatment of effluent.

11.

The claim of depreciation by the Assessee was in terms

of Section 32(1) of the Act and as pointed out by learned counsel
for the Assessee, what is of importance is that the plant or
machinery should be owned by the Assessee and used for the
purposes of its business. According to the Assessee, both
conditions were satisfied by the Assessee but, unfortunately, the
Assessing Officer took a different view.

12.

In The Liquidators of Pursa Limited v. Commissioner

of Income-tax, Bihar, [1954] 25 ITR 265, the expression “used for
the purpose of the business” as appearing in Section 10(2)(vii) of
the Income Tax Act, 1922 was considered by the Supreme Court.
It was held that the words obviously mean “used for the purpose
of enabling the owner to carry on the business and earn profits in
the business.”

13.

This Court had occasion to consider the expression as

appearing in the 1922 Act in Capital Bus Service (P) Ltd. v.

ITA No.571/2007

Page 5 of 8

Commissioner of Income-tax, New Delhi, [1980] 123 ITR 404.
After surveying the decisions on the subject, it was held that there
was a consensus of judicial opinion in favour of adopting a liberal
interpretation or a wider interpretation to the expression “used
for the purposes of the business”.

14.

In Multican Builders Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-

tax [2005] 278 ITR 142, the Calcutta High Court considered the
expression “used for the purpose of business or profession” as
appearing in Section 32 of the Act and concluded that the claim of
depreciation is not dependent on the “actual” use or the asset
being “put to” use. The expression has to be interpreted in the
ordinary grammatical sense, as in common parlance and not in
the legal or technical sense.

15.

This Court had occasion to consider the expression as

appearing in Section 32 of the Act in Commissioner of Income-tax
v. Refrigeration & Allied Industries Ltd., [2000] 113 TAXMAN
103. This Court noted that even though the Supreme Court had
left the question of active or passive user open in the Liquidators
of Pursa Ltd., but in Machinery Manufacturers Corporation Ltd.
v. Commissioner of Income-tax, [1957] 31 ITR 203, the Bombay

ITA No.571/2007

Page 6 of 8

High Court had given it a wider meaning. After considering
Commissioner of Income-tax v. Dalmia Cement Ltd., [1945] 13
ITR 415 and Commissioner of Income-tax v. Viswanath Bhaskar
Sathe, [1937] 5 ITR 621, this Court was of the view that passive
user of machinery such as by keeping it in good working
condition so that it could be used at any moment would be the
correct approach to adopt for interpreting the expression “used
for the purposes of the business” occurring in Section 32 of the
Act.

16.

All these decisions suggest that the expression “used

for the purposes of the business” needs to be liberally interpreted.
This is precisely what the Assessee did and the view taken by the
Assessee was certainly a plausible view – it just so happens that
the Assessing Officer did not agree with the Assessee. But that by
itself would not mean that the Assessee had furnished inaccurate
particulars for the purposes of reducing its tax liability. A penal
provision such as the one that we are concerned with ought to be
strictly construed.

17.

We may also note that it has concurrently been held by

the Commissioner as well as by the Tribunal that the Assessee

ITA No.571/2007

Page 7 of 8

had not furnished inaccurate particulars. We do not think, under
these circumstances, that it would be appropriate to reverse the
view taken by the Commissioner as well as by the Tribunal. No
substantial question of law arises in this regard inasmuch as there
is nothing to show that the decision of the Tribunal is perverse or
that the claim made by the Assessee was motivated.

18.

The appeal is dismissed with costs. We assess counsel’s

fee at Rs.10,000/- which will be paid by the Revenue by
depositing the amount by way of a cheque in the name of the
Registrar General of this Court within four weeks from today.

19.

List for compliance on 20th February, 2008.
