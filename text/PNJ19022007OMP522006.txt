1.

These are objections by the petitioner to the award

dated 24.10.2005 published by Sh. V.D.Tiwari, the learned sole
arbitrator appointed by this court to decide the disputes and
differences between the petitioner and the respondent.

OMP.52/06

page 1 of 10

2.

Petitioner is a cooperative group housing society.

Respondent is a building contractor and carries on a business
under the name and style 'Rana Construction Company'.
3.

The impugned award has awarded Rs.75,19,230/- to

the contractor.
4.

Admitted case of the parties is that the society had

invited offers from contractors to construct 166 residential flats
on the land allotted to the society. Offer of the respondent was
accepted and a formal agreement was executed between the
parties on 25.2.1996.
5.

The stipulations in the tender documents as also

certain post offer letters exchanged between the parties were
included as a part of the contractor terms.
6.

Clause

9

of

the

agreement

dated

25.2.1996

incorporated, by reference, letters exchanged between the
parties as forming part of their contract.
7.

Work had to commence on 1.3.1996.

It had to be

completed within 24 months.
8.

Parties ran into commercial disputes.

period of time work remained suspended.

For a long
There was

negotiation between the contractor and the office bearers of
the society. The contractor was allowed to continue with the
OMP.52/06

page 2 of 10

work.

Somewhere in the year 2002 work was completed.

However, I may note at the very beginning that the society
disputed the work done by the contractor. It also disputed that
the work was not completed.
9.

At the hearing held on 2.1.2007, Sh. V.B.Andley,

learned senior counsel for the petitioner attempted to urge the
matter as if I was sitting in appeal.

Learned counsel made

lengthy submissions calling upon the court to go through each
and every piece of evidence.
10.

I had called upon the learned counsel to restrict

submissions within the scope of a challenge permissible under
Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996.
11.

But, due to insistence by the counsel that it was a

case of an award based on no evidence, I had heard
submissions as if an original proceeding was being decided by
me.
12.

I

had

called

upon

the

parties

to

file

written

submissions. The same have been filed.
13.

Unfortunately, both parties have given to me their

respective versions, without dealing with the submissions of
the rival parties.
14.

Therefore written submissions do not guide me any

OMP.52/06

page 3 of 10

better.
15.

I do not intend to refer to the verbose submissions

made by learned counsel for the society and as reproduced in
the written submissions running into 30 pages.

My reason

thereof is that a preliminary, and in my opinion, a most
fundamental point remains unanswered.
16.

Needless to state, the same remains unanswered by

the society.
17.

As noted above, award in favour of the contractor is

in sum of Rs.75,19,230/-.
18.

If submissions made by the society were to be

accepted and all payments alleged by the society stand
proved, it would be a case where the society would have paid
an excess sum of Rs.75 lacs to the contractor.
19.

I had questioned Mr. V.B.Andley, learned senior

counsel whether it was plausible for the society to have paid an
excess sum of Rs.75 lacs. If yes, I questioned learned counsel
as to how this had happened.
20.

After all, the society had engaged the services of an

architect who was scrutinizing the bills.
21.

No answer, much less a satisfactory answer was given

by the learned counsel.
OMP.52/06

page 4 of 10

22.

It was urged by learned counsel for the petitioner and in

respect whereof written submissions have been pend down at page
no.26 and page no.29 of the written submissions that a sum of
Rs.50 lacs paid in cash to the contractor was not accounted for by
the learned arbitrator and that a sum of Rs.30 lacs paid by cheque
which was paid has been wrongly treated as not paid by the
arbitrator.
23.

Needless to state, if the society proved said payment of

Rs.50 lacs and also established that Rs.30 lacs paid by the society
was not accounted for by the contractor effect would have been that
the contractor would have been over paid a sum of Rs.5 lacs. The
learned

arbitrator

has

held

that

Rs.75,19,230/- to the contractor.

the

society

has

to

pay

It is thus obvious that the

arguments predicated on the running bills and the attempt to show
that the value of work done was to be decreased by Rs.80 lacs over
and above the value of work done found completed by the arbitrator
would be a highly exaggerated argument for the reason in said
circumstance, if stand of the society qua the payments was to be
accepted, over payment by Rs.80 lacs would have been made to the
contractor.
24.

In respect of the sum of Rs.50 lacs stated to have been

paid in cash to the contractor, suffice would it be to note that no
receipt

in

OMP.52/06

respect

thereof has

been

produced by

the

page 5 of 10

society. Extracted from the written submissions of the society,
the stand is as under:-

25.

“The former secretary of the society Sh. Madan
Sharma informed the society vide his letter
dated 7.11.2004 that a sum of Rs.50 lacs was
paid in cash to the contractor on his request.
The former secretary being
friend of the
contractor obliged him by paying a cash
amount of Rs.50 lacs.
The arbitrator was
requested to direct the contractor to file the
statement of his account in Punjab National
Bank, which was declined by the arbitrator.
This amount of Rs.50 lacs is outstanding
against the former secretary and managing
committee under the head “Cash in hand” in
society's account.”
If Rs.50 lacs is outstanding against the former

managing committee under the head “Cash in hand”,

the

society has to get the sum accounted from the previous
managing committee.
26.

If the previous managing committee has defalcated

the accounts and has withdrawn huge amount of cash, it does
not mean that the contractor has been paid the same.
27.

What is relevant is that there is no receipt executed

by the contractor evidencing receipt of Rs.50 lacs in cash.
28.

As regards Rs.30 lacs, suffice would it be to note that

along with his letter dated 20.1.2002, contractor enclosed
therewith a statement showing details of the payment received
by the contractor till issuance of the letter dated 20.1.2002.
OMP.52/06

page 6 of 10

29.

in the said letter contractor admitted having received

Rs.30 lacs in the financial year 1.4.1999 to 31.3.2000 and
Rs.35 lacs in the financial year 1.4.2000 to 31.3.2001.
30.

In the statement of accounts which was annexed by

the contractor with the letter dated 20.1.2002, details of the
payment received were disclosed as under:“RANA CONSTRUCTION CO.

letter

20.1.2002, contractor had stated that Rs.79,51,886/- were still
due and payable to him. Needless to state, while indicating the

OMP.52/06

page 7 of 10

gross work done and payments received, contractor had
reflected in his statement of account, Rs.30 lacs received
during the financial year 1.4.99 to 31.3.2000 and Rs.35 lacs
during the financial year 1.4.2000 to 31.3.2001.
32.

Before the learned arbitrator, it was pleaded by the

society that Rs.30 lacs paid by the society were not accounted
for by the contractor.
33.
the

I am afraid, learned counsel for the petitioner as also
petitioner

have

either

not

understood

the

simple

accounting mechanism or are refusing to accept the truth.
34.

As noted above, details of the cheques by which

contractor had received Rs.30 lacs in the financial year 19992000 and Rs.35 lacs in the financial year 2000-01 were
indicated in the statement of account filed by the contractor
along with his letter dated 20.1.2002.
35.

In para 6.20 and 6.21 of the objections, it is inter alia

urged as under:“6.20
Because the learned arbitrator erred
in law in losing sight of the fact that the
respondent has admitted the receipt of
Rs.30,00,000/- from the petitioner by cheque
dated 21.4.1999, 8.5.1999, 19.6.1999 and
29.7.1999 which also find mention in the books
of accounts kept by the respondent, copies of
which have been filed before the learned
arbitrator.
OMP.52/06

page 8 of 10

36.

6.21
Because the learned arbitrator should
have held that the sum of Rs.30 lacs was a
payment only for the work done for which 18th
pre final bill was given.”
I am afraid, learned arbitrator has duly taken note of

the aforesaid payment of Rs.30 lacs but what has been held is
that

after

giving

adjustment

of

said

payment,

balance

outstanding work for which payment had to be made was
Rs.75,19,230/-.
37.

It is not a case where the learned arbitrator, while

determining the payment due has excluded the sum of Rs.30
lacs.
38.

In my opinion, the aforesaid facts i.e. society not

proving having paid Rs.50 lacs in cash and the stand of the
society that Rs.30 lacs paid by cheques were not accounted
for, being contrary to the record, the inevitable conclusion is
that the amount found due and payable by the learned
arbitrator is correct.
39.

I find no merits in the objections. I refrain from noting

the submissions made in respect of the running bills for the
reason work done under the running bills is a question of fact.
Questions of fact have to be decided by the arbitrator.
Findings pertaining to facts are immune for challenge save and

OMP.52/06

except if it can be shown that a material document was ignored
or that the finding is perverse.
40.

None has been shown.

41.

The petition is accordingly dismissed.

42.

No costs.
