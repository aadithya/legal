ANIL KUMAR, J.
CM Nos.12140 & 17173/2007
1.

The petitioner no.1 is an association of absorbed DOT Group A

officers of MTNL who have already exercised their option for absorption
in MTNL. In the writ petition they are seeking implementation of the
terms and conditions of letter dated 4th October, 2005 and other
CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 1 of 16

letters/circulars issued on the same subject and for direction to the
respondents not to post on promotion, transfer or deputation DOT
officers in MTNL and to prepare a seniority list for Group A officers in
MTNL and to fill the post on promotion and to repatriate the
unabsorbed officers from MTNL and to create a trust under Rule 37A of
the CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 for pension as provided under clause
18(i) of the general terms and conditions and for a direction to
respondents to call for options for pro-rata pension and to grant the
same to the petitioners.

2.

The petitioners have filed CM No.12140/2007 seeking an interim

restraint against the posting on promotion/transfer and deputation of
DOT officers in MTNL and directions to the respondents to promote the
eligible officers of Group A against the vacancies available in MTNL after
preparing the seniority list and to provide pension for retiring absorbed
officers from Government of India and to grant pro-rata pension as an
interim measure.

3.

On behalf of Secretary, Department of Telecommunications,

respondent no.2 the counsel had made a statement on 11th September,
2007 that no posting on promotion/transfer of DOT officers shall be
made in MTNL. On the statement of the counsel for respondent No.2
the Court had ordered accordingly and it further clarified that in case of
CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 2 of 16

any transfer it would be open for the respondent to approach the Court.
The arrangement pursuant to the statement of respondent No.2 is
continuing.

4.

An application being CM No.17173/2007 has also been filed by

the respondent No.2 for vacation of order dated 11th September, 2007
passed on the statement made by the counsel for the respondent no.2.

5.

The petitioner in his application for interim directions has

contended that the action of the respondents in not implementing the
terms and conditions for absorption of Group `A' officers in MTNL is
arbitrary and discriminatory. It was alleged that the posts in MTNL are
being filled up by DOT officers, ignoring the claim and seniority of
absorbed Group `A' officers which is causing irreparable loss and
injustice to Group `A' absorbed officers. It is also contended that the
officers who have not exercised the option for absorption are promoted
on regular basis against the work and post in MTNL and are being
posted to work in PSU whereas the names of the absorbed officers have
been removed from the promotion list of DOT altogether which is
contrary to the vital terms and conditions of absorption. The
petitioners/applicants have also sought interim directions on account of
not settling the pro-rata pension and because the option has not been
invited by the respondents as per clause 18(2). The interim direction is
CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 3 of 16

also sought regarding non creation of pension fund by the Government
in MTNL as warranted under Rule 37A.

6.

The petition is contested by respondents. Respondent No.2 has

contended that petitioner No.1 is alleged to be an association, however,
no resolution has been filed in support of authorization of the
competent person nor any copy of the Memorandum of Association and
bye-laws or registration certificate has been filed on behalf of the
petitioner no.1. It is also contended that though the petition is filed in
representative capacity but the disputes will be individual service
disputes and no facts have been disclosed as to how a particular
individual officer has been prejudiced.

Regarding absorption it is

contended that number of Court cases are pending and consequently
list

prevailing

before

initiation

of

absorption

process

is

being

maintained. Regarding absorption process of ITS Group `A' officers it is
stated that OM dated 24th March, 2005 has not attained finality due to
various Court cases and presidential order issued for absorption in
MTNL/BSNL in respect of individual officers are also subject to final
outcome of Court cases.

7.

According to respondent No.2 DPCs for regular promotions

against civil posts are only conducted by UPSC to consider the eligible
officers for promotion to next higher grade who are available in the
CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 4 of 16

department as on crucial date of vacancy year and none of the
vacancies arising out of retirement, resignation, VRS etc of the absorbed
Group `A' employees has been considered for holding of DPC by the
UPSC and these vacancies are being used for promotion of eligible
absorbed officers only. The respondents have also asserted that it is
ensured that absorbed ITS officers are not put to any loss in the matter
of promotion and to fulfill that a common seniority list of ITS officers is
also being maintained which fact is also being clarified by clarification
dated 30th May, 2005 stipulating that seniority within the respective
cadres shall be the same as was prevailing in DOT as on 1st October,
2000 subject to any alterations in the seniority made by Department of
Telecommunications after 1st October, 2000 till the presidential order
for absorption is issued.

8.

The respondent No.2 has also contended that the concerned

CMDs have already been intimated to convene the DPCs in respect of
eligible officers and to promote them. Reliance has been placed for this
on office memorandum dated 30th September, 2000. Regarding the prorata pension it is stated that Department of Pension and Pensioner‟s
Welfare has amended sub Rule 8 of Rule 37A of CCS Pension Rule,
1972 with effect from 14th October, 2005 and has made provision for
giving option to the absorbed Group “A” officers to receive pro-rata
retirement benefits for the service rendered under the Central
CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 5 of 16

Government and the Department of Pension and Pensioner‟s Welfare
has been requested to amend the rule further to make it effective from
30th September, 2000. Regarding creation of pension fund reliance has
been placed on DO letter No.40-14/3-2003-Pen (T) dated 23rd August,
2005 address to CMD, MTNL advising him for creation of pension fund
and also to communicate the quantum of Government liability towards
one time lump sum settlement in accordance with sub Rule 15 of Rule
37A. The averment has also been made that every effort is being made
to implement the terms and conditions for absorption of Group A
officers in MTNL/BSNL and those employees who have already been
absorbed in MTNL are not put to any loss.

9.

An ex parte order dated 11th September, 2007 was passed on the

application of the petitioners on the statement made by the counsel for
the respondent no.2,

directing the respondents not to post on

promotion/transfer DOT Officers in MTNL. The respondents have filed
an application being CM No.17173/2007 for vacation of this interim
order

whereby

respondents

were

directed

not

to

post

on

promotion/transfer DOT Officers in MTNL on various grounds including
the ground that the statement was given by the counsel for the
respondent no.2 on account of misunderstanding.

CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

The respondents have contended that the office memorandum

dated 24th March, 2005 of Department of Telecommunication calling for
option from all the Group `A' Officers and various clarifications given by
OM dated 4th October, 2005 were challenged before the Central
Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, in New Delhi in OA
No.693/2005. The petition was disposed of by order dated 31st October,
2005 holding that Secretary, Department of Telecommunication shall
extend the date of submission of options of Group `A' Officers who have
not yet been absorbed in MTNL to 30th November, 2005 and thereafter,
respondents shall be at liberty to take appropriate decisions on such
options within a reasonable period.

Against the order dated 31st

October, 2005 by the Central Administrative Tribunal, the writ petition
being W.P.C. No.22515/2005 was filed and after hearing the parties the
following order has been passed:
“In terms of the prayer made by the counsel appearing for
the petitioners, the petitioners are allowed further 10 days
time to enable them to exercise their options. Any option, if
exercised, by the petitioners in terms of the order passed by
the respondents and any other order passed by the
respondents during the pendency of this writ petition
pertaining to the subject matter which is being agitated
herein would be subject to the result of the writ petition
making it clear that if in case the petition is allowed and
any adverse order is passed by the respondents against the
petitioners, the same would abide by the final orders to be
passed in the writ petition.”

CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 7 of 16

11.

Pursuant to order dated 28th November, 2005 of the Division

Bench, the 10 days‟ time granted to exercise the option has expired, yet
the repatriation of Group `A' Officers who have not exercised the option
pursuant to interim order, it appears cannot be finalized as the writ
petition is still pending and other petitions are pending before Central
Administrative Tribunal. After hearing the writ petition, if the Division
Bench comes to the conclusion that the Group `A' Officers who had
been asked to exercise options and who had not exercised options, were
not offered comprehensive terms and conditions for absorption in
MTNL, and because the terms and conditions of absorption lacked
complete information on various aspects of absorption like promotional
avenues, pension, etc., they can still be allowed to be absorbed.
Consequently it is inevitable to infer that

the absorption process of

officers of DOT in MTNL/BSNL has not attained finality. Such officers
are still working with MTNL/BSNL and

continuing as Officers of

Department of Telecommunication.

12.

This cannot be disputed, in the facts and circumstances, that the

absorption process started in terms of OM dated 24th March, 2005 has
not attained finality as the matter is still sub-judiced before the Division
Bench and in some other Tribunals and other High Courts which is
apparent from the copies of orders passed by Central Administrative
Tribunal, Allahabad Bench and Mumbai Bench and the copy of the
CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 8 of 16

order dated 11th July, 2006 of High Court of Andhra Pradesh extending
the interim suspension of OM dated 24th march, 2005. Another relevant
fact which is not disputed by the petitioner is that only 36 officers of ITS
Group have been permanently absorbed in MTNL on the basis of their
option whereas approximately 218 ITS Group `A' Officers have not
exercised their option for absorption but are still working in MTNL.

13.

By the order dated 18th October 2005 those officials who had not

exercised their option were directed to be repatriated to Department of
Telecommunication. An interim order to maintain the status quo ante
prior to 18th

October 2005 was granted by Central Administrative

Tribunal benches situated at Allahabad and Mumbai. Consequent
thereto the Grade `A‟ officers who had been ordered to be repatriated
have been allowed to join back and they are still working with
MTNL/BSNL. There are about 218 group `A‟ officers who are involved in
operations, development, planning and other related work out of which
only 36 officers have been absorbed after they exercised their option.
Since the absorption has not been completed the seniority which was
prevalent before some of the officers were absorbed is still continuing.
Presidential orders issued for absorption in MTNL/BSNL in respect of
individual officers are also subject to final outcome of court cases

CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

14.

The petitioners have prayed that no officer be posted on transfer,

promotion or deputation to the MTNL. The generic plea on behalf of the
association cannot be accepted because no details have been given by
the petitioners to substantiate the plea that they shall suffer irreparable
loss in case unabsorbed officers are transferred or appointed on
deputation. If the rules of the MTNL permit appointment on deputation,
the petitioner no.1 association cannot claim that no officers of DOT
should be appointed on deputation. The petitioners also cannot insist
that

no

person

should

be

promoted

in

the

department

of

telecommunication on the vacancies which are available in the
department as on crucial date of vacancy year and none of the
vacancies arising out of retirement, resignation, VRS etc. as none of
these vacancies are being considered for filling which are only for
absorbed officers in MTNL. The seniority of the members of petitioner
No.1 shall not be affected by promotion of the officials of other
departments in the facts and circumstances. The time permitted by the
orders of the Government and orders passed by the Courts for
exercising their options for absorption has already expired. The time
granted by the Division Bench to the officials who had not exercised
their option for absorption has already expired. Whether such officials
whose petition is still pending before the Division Bench shall be
entitled to be absorbed in MTNL is yet to be decided. The possibility that
such officers who have not exercised their option up till now and whose
CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 10 of 16

writ petition is still pending may be allowed and they may be absorbed
in MTNL, cannot be denied their promotion in their parent department
on the grounds as raised by the petitioners.

15.

The

petitioners

have

also

sought

interim

directions

for

preparation of seniority list of MTNL considering those officials who
have exercised their option and who have already been absorbed. This
cannot be disputed that the OM dated 24th March, 2005 has not
attained finality due to various court cases and presidential orders
issued for absorption in MTNL/BSNL in respect of individual officers are
subject to final outcome of Court's cases. Preparation of seniority list
considering only those officials who have exercised their option and not
considering other officials whose matters are still pending will create
multiplicity of proceedings and in the facts and circumstances it will not
be an appropriate to direct the respondents to finalize the seniority list
by an interim direction.

16.

The petitioners have sought repatriation of unabsorbed officials.

The Court cases on behalf of these officials are still pending. Though the
time granted in the proceedings to exercise their option has expired,
however, the proceedings have not been finally disposed of and they are
still pending. In the circumstances by an interim order no directions

CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 11 of 16

should be given to the respondent no.1 to repatriate those officials to
their parent department who have not exercised their options.

17.

The plea of the petitioners that the posts in MTNL are being filled

up by the DOT officers ignoring the claim and seniority of absorbed
officers prima facie appears to be without any basis, as no particulars
have been given of the officers who have not been promoted according
to recruitment rules for promotion. Nothing has been disclosed about
the officers who have been appointed on deputation ignoring the claim
of the absorbed officers who are allegedly entitled for promotion for
those posts on which the unabsorbed officers on deputation have been
appointed. If a post is to be filled by promotion, it cannot be filled by
appointing an officer on deputation unless the rules provides for filling
the posts on deputation.

If the rules provide for filling the posts by

deputation, the petitioner's member cannot have any grievance. The
allegations made by petitioners are generic without any particulars and
in the circumstances the petitioners are unable to show any prime case
in their favor. The officers who are on deputation are not entitled for
promotion in MTNL unless they are absorbed, If a post in the MTNL can
be filled up on deputation, the members of the petitioner no.1 cannot
have a grievance about it nor can they allege that they will suffer
irreparable loss or that they will suffer greater inconvenience on

CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 12 of 16

account of promotion of officers in their department who have not
exercised their option and who are still on deputation in MTNL.

18.

The petitioners have also alleged that the officers who have not

been absorbed, are promoted on regular basis against the work and
post in MTNL. No particulars and details of any of such officials have
been given. Merely on the bald plea of the petitioners they are not
entitled for any interim relief in the facts and circumstances nor in the
circumstances it can be inferred that the balance of convenience is in
favor

of

the

petitioners

so

as

to

be

entitled

for

an

interim

direction/order from this Court.

19.

From the pleas of the respondents it is apparent that the DPCs

for regular promotions against civil post only are being conducted by
UPSC to consider the eligible officers for promotion to next higher grade
which are available to the department and none of the vacancies arising
out of retirement, resignation, VRS etc. of absorbed group `A‟ employees
have been considered which are only for absorbed officers. The
respondent no.2 has also asserted that the members of petitioner no.1
are not put to any loss in the matter of promotion and to achieve that a
common seniority list is also being maintained. The petitioners are
unable to show as to how they will be prejudiced in the facts and
circumstances from the promotion of those officers who have not been
CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 13 of 16

absorbed. The respondents have further asserted that to further
safeguard the interests of the members of petitioner no.1, CMDs of
MTNL/BSNL have been asked to convene the DPC in respect of eligible
officers and to promote them on the recommendation of the DPC. No
details of the officers who have been promoted on regular basis in MTNL
although they have not exercised their option for absorption, have been
given by the petitioners. The members of petitioner's association cannot
have a grievance about removal of their names from the promotion list
of DOT after their absorption nor they can claim on this ground that the
officers of DOT who have not yet been promoted should not be
promoted or should not be appointed on deputation to MTNL/BSNL.
The allegations of the petitioners are vague and in the circumstances,
the interim directions/orders and as prayed by them cannot be passed
in their favor

20.

The Department of Pension and Pensioner‟s Welfare has amended

sub Rule 8 of Rule 37A of CCS Pension Rule, 1972 with effect from 14th
October, 2005 and has made provision for giving option to the absorbed
Group “A” officers to receive pro-rata retirement benefits for the service
rendered under the Central Government and the Department of Pension
and Pensioner‟s Welfare has been requested to amend the rule further
to make it effective from 30th September, 2000. In view of this averment

CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 14 of 16

of the respondents, no interim order can be granted at this stage nor it
will be appropriate to pass any general order.

21.

For pension fund it is apparent that DO letter No.40-14/3-2003-

Pen (T) dated 23rd August, 2005 has been address to CMD, MTNL
advising him for creation of pension fund and also to communicate the
quantum of Government liability towards one time lump sum
settlement in accordance with sub Rule 15 of Rule 37A. In the
circumstances it will not be appropriate to grant any general directions
to the respondents regarding creation of pension fund and for pro-rata
pension.

22.

In the circumstances the apprehensions and allegations of the

petitioners are without any legal basis and the petitioners are unable to
show that inconvenience caused to them shall be greater in case
interim relief as prayed by them is not granted.
therefore,

are

not

entitled

for

an

order

that

The petitioners
no

postings

on

promotion/transfer of Department of technology officer be made in
MTNL nor they are entitled for other interim directions.

23.

For the forgoing reasons, the application for interim directions by

the petitioners being CM 12140 of 2007 is dismissed and the
application of the respondent no.2 being CM No.17173 of 2007 is
CM Nos. 12140 & 17173 of 2007 in WP (C) 6465/2007

Page 15 of 16

allowed and the order dated 11th September, 2007 passed on the basis
of the statement made by the counsel for the respondent no.2 is
vacated. Considering the facts and circumstances, the parties are
however, left to bear their own costs.
