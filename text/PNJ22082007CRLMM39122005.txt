The first respondent had instituted a complaint

under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against
the

petitioner.

for

Complainant received 4 cheques in sum of

Rs.45,000/- each from the petitioner and recorded a settlement

Total amount Rs.1,80,000/(Rupees One Lac Eighty Thousand Only)

2.

On receipt of the above cheques withdraw my court
case against Mr.Dhar. This settlement is subject to
realization of all the above four cheques.”
The cheques were encashed by the complainant but

he turned around and did not withdraw the complaint.

On

10.2.2005, learned Metropolitan Magistrate passed an order
that settlement between the parties and receipt of payment by
the complainant would not wipe out the offence.
3.

Holding so, learned Trial Judge notified a date for

framing of notice under Section 251 Cr.P.C.
4.

Petitioner rushed to this Court praying that in view

of the settlement between the parties the complaint filed by
the first respondent deserves to be quashed.
5.

In para 6 of the petition, petitioner has averred as

under:Page 2 of 4

6.

“6. That again the petitioners appeared before the
learned Trial Court on 8th June and the fact of
compromise between the petitioners and respondent
No.1 was brought to the notice of the learned Trial
Court as the compromise was already arrived at
between the petitioner and respondent No.1 before
the appearance of the petitioners in the learned Trial
Court. This fact was recorded in the order sheet
dated 8th June 2004. Copy of the order sheet dated
8th June 2004 is annexed herewith as Annexure-B
and copy of the compromise letter is annexed
herewith as Annexure-C.”
Reply filed by the respondent to para 6 of the

instant petition reads as under:-

7.

“6. That the contents of para No.6 of the petition
are correct to the extent that the petitioners offered
a
settlement of accounts with the present respondent
and they arrived at a compromise regarding the
outstanding balance amount. It is submitted that the
petitioners again with an ulterior motive promised
the present respondent with a compensation amount
because of harassment he has undergone due to
continuous dishonour and presentation of the cheque
and legal expenses incurred by him since the
sending of legal notice till incurring expenses on
filing of the complaint and attending of the date of
hearing, the fact of which is suppressed by the
petitioners before the trial court as well as before
this Hon'ble Court.
Rather the petitioners have
levelled vague and false allegations against the
present respondents without any basis and the
reason of which is best known to them, hence the
petitioners cannot claim their acquittal as a legal
right.”
The respondent has in categorical and unequivocal

terms admitted that parties arrived at a settlement.
8.

If that be so, I see no reason why complaint filed by
Page 3 of 4

the respondent should continue.
9.

It is not the case of the respondent that he arrived

at a settlement under some bona fide mistake or that the
settlement is a result of an inducement coercion or a threat. I
additionally note that the respondent has received benefit
under the settlement.
10.

Before respondent resiles from the settlement he

must restore the benefit which he has received under the
settlement.

I note that the respondent has not restored the

benefit which he had received under the settlement.
11.

In the decision reported as 2005 (1) JCC 83

Mohd.Shamim & Ors. vs. Nahid Begum & Ors. in a dispute
between husband and wife where the wife received a benefit
agreeing that she would join the husband in quashing of the FIR
but later on resiled from the compromise, Hon'ble Supreme
Court opined that the complaint filed by the wife had to be
quashed notwithstanding consent not being given by her, for
the reason she had taken benefit under a settlement.
12.

The petition is accordingly allowed. Complaint filed

by the first respondent against the petitioners is quashed.
