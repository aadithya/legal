A.K. SIKRI, J.
1.

The issue involved in all these writ petitions, being identical,
including the facts, the same were heard together and are being
decided vide this common judgment.

For the sake of brevity,

facts of WP (C) Nos. 16582-84/2004 are taken.
2.

Vide advertisement No. F-3(20)/97/S-II dated 9-16.8.1997, the
Government of NCT of Delhi advertised various posts of DASS
Grade-II and Grade-IV posts for appointment of the Govt. of NCT
of Delhi. All these posts were reserved for sports persons and
were to be filled from amongst meritorious sportsmen and
women. For Grade-II, there were 10 posts and for Grade-IV the
advertisement was for 27 posts. Number of persons claiming to
be covered in the said sports category submitted their

applications. While this process was on, the Delhi Subordinate
Service Selection Board (hereinafter referred to as the 'Board')
was constituted in the Month of September 1999, which is given
the task of making recruitments to the various appointments in
the Govt. of NCT of Delhi. Thus, after the constitution of this
Board, the entire record pertaining to the selection was sent to
the Board for making selections.

The Board constituted an

Expert Committee comprising of Dr. S.N. Gupta, Deputy Director
(Sports), Delhi University; Dr. R.S. Maan, Reader in Physical
Education, Shaheed Bhagat Singh College, Delhi University; the
Chairman, Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Board.

This

Committee formulated the criteria which was to be adopted for
carrying out the selections. As per this criteria the candidates
were required to be assessed in the following three stages :“60 marks for past achievement in National
International events.

and

25 marks for present achievement in the trials.
25 marks for personality test.
The grand total of the same comes out to 110.”

3.

After conducting the trials, a comparative merit list was drawn
adding the marks obtained by the candidates in the first two
stages, i.e. past achievement and trials. The candidates in the
said comparative merit list were called for interview.
Mr.Shailesh Mudgal did not receive the interview call.

One
He

approached the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Principal
Bench, New Delhi through an application filed under Section 19
of the Administrative Tribunal Act praying for quashing of the
entire selection and for reconducting of the trials etc. after

WP (C) No. 16563-70/2004

nsk

Page 3 of 18

framing fresh criteria. This OA was filed on 17.5.1999 and vide
orders dated 11.11.1999, the Tribunal dismissed this OA
upholding the validity of the criteria and also recording that the
same was uniformly applied. However, even before this OA was
filed, another person, namely Amar Nath Shukla, who is arrayed
as respondent No.3 herein, had also filed OA No. 1056/1999 on
6.5.1999. His grievance was that he had not received call for
interview despite the fact that he stood first in the trials for his
game, i.e. Chess.

Notice in this application was issued and

interim order was also passed by the Tribunal directing that he
be provisionally interviewed and his selection be kept in a sealed
cover. This OA was disposed of on 18.4.2002 granting liberty to
him to proceed in the matter afresh in accordance with law. The
respondent No.3, being not satisfied with that order, impugned
the same by filing WP (C) No. 4145/2002 in this Court.
was,

however,

dismissed

as

withdrawn

on

This

16.9.2002.

Thereafter, in January 2003 he filed another OA 116/2003 in
view of the permission granted by the Tribunal in its order dated
18.4.2002. The respondent No.3, this time, succeeded in this
efforts as vide judgment dated 24.8.2004 the Tribunal has
allowed the said OA and quashed the appointments of the
petitioners in this petition with directions to the Board to
conduct the entire exercise of recalculation and preparing the
merit list by assuming the marks in the trial to be 100 and not
25, as decided by the Expert Committee constituted by the
Board.

All these writ petitions, except WP (C) No. 263/2005, are filed by

WP (C) No. 16563-70/2004

nsk

Page 4 of 18

the persons who were successful in the selections conducted by
the Board. WP (C) No. 263/2005 is filed by the Board impugning
that very judgment. It is, thus, clear that in all these petitions
challenge is to the impugned judgment dated 24.8.2004.
5.

Before coming to the grounds on which the judgment passed by
the Tribunal is assailed, we make take note of the reasons which
persuaded the Tribunal to arrive at the aforesaid conclusion.

6.

IMPUGNED JUDGMENT OF THE TRIBUNAL
On going through the impugned judgment, we find that
the Tribunal had directed the Board to produce the record of the
selection and after perusing the same it found, in the first
application

filed

by

the

respondent,

that

the

Selection

Committee had adopted unfair marking policy inasmuch as
initially it had fixed 100 marks for the trial test but while
preparing the final merit list these marks were reduced to 25. In
this manner, a person who had gained a substantial lead over
others was pushed down in the merit list. The record further
revealed grave errors in totalling of marks which had led to
wrong selection.

The Tribunal in one of its OA had recorded

that – 'during the course of hearing, we inspected the mark
sheets containing marks awarded for trial tests and we noted
that prima facie there appeared to be some discrepancies in the
figures while totalling was being carried out.” Inspection of the
records was permitted to the counsel for the applicant
(respondent No.3 herein) and further glaring irregularities were
noted.

However, at that moment it was noticed that selected

persons had not been impleaded as parties.
WP (C) No. 16563-70/2004

nsk

In these
Page 5 of 18

circumstances, the first OA was disposed of on 18.4.2002
permitting the respondent No.2 to proceed in the matter in
accordance with law and armed with this permission, as noted
by us in chronological order above, the second OA was filed
impleading the selected candidates, i.e. the petitioners in these
petitions.

After hearing the second application, the learned

Tribunal in the impugned judgment found, on the basis of
records produced, that recommendations made by the Selection
Board were objected to by the Govt. of NCT of Delhi, which is
clear from the following noting pertaining to the candidates :S.No. Name

No one from selected

line – That despite the
above gross irregularities
the Board recommended
the selection of above
candidates
for
illegal
considerations. The GNCT
had also given appointment
to these candidates even
though no clarification was
made by the GNCT on their
respective Dossiers.

Apart from the above, the argument of counsel for the
respondent No.3, which prevailed with the Tribunal, was that
though initially 100 marks were fixed for the trial test, but when
the merit list was prepared they were reduced to 25 and in this
manner the person who had gained substantial lead over others
in the trial test was pushed down in the merit list. This fact was
even admitted in the reply filed by the official respondents in the
said OA, noted the learned Tribunal.

WP (C) No. 16563-70/2004

nsk

The Tribunal, thus,
Page 7 of 18

observed that once there was an admission that 100 marks were
fixed as maximum pass for the trial test, there was no reason
for the Interview Board to reduce the same thereafter to 1/4th to
give overall score of 110.

Recording this fact the Tribunal

stated as under, pointing out the implication thereof :“18. Decision in this regard is always to be taken in
advance. They cannot be changed subsequently. Our
attention has not been drawn to any decision by an
appropriate authority to reduce the marks before the
test was held. The Interview Board otherwise also was
not competent to do so. Decision taken subsequently
without any basis or logic cannot be sustained merely
because it was felt that it will give overall score of 110
is not a proper explanation. Once 100 marks were
fixed for the trial test, necessarily the same had to be
adhered to. The result is obvious that a person who
might score well in the trial test out of 100 marks and
if it is divided by ¼ may slide down on the overall merit
that will be totally contrary to law. To that extent the
contention of the respondents indeed is not at all
sustainable.”

8.

Referring to certain judgments, including the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Union of India & Ors. v. Rajesh
P.U., Puthuvalnikathu & Anr., 2003 SCC (L&S) 1048, the
Tribunal came to the conclusion that there was no reason
otherwise to quash the entire selection process but it was
necessary to quash the appointments/results declared giving
the following directions :“24. .....a) The respondent No.1 will re-examine the
entire dossiers of the candidates to enquire that they
have filed complete certificates and were within the age
limit prescribed etc;
b)
The marks obtained in the trial test should be
calculated as was decided to be 100 marks; a fresh
merit list in this regard should be prepared and
thereafter the result should be declared as per the
merit of the candidates.
25. Subject to aforesaid, the impugned selection is
quashed. This exercise should be completed preferably
within two months from the date of receipt of the
certified copy of this order. No costs.”

So far as objections of the Govt. of NCT of Delhi mentioned in
the tabulated form above are concerned, the Tribunal observed
that since the matter was remanded back to the authorities,
they may look into this controversy.

10.

THE CONTROVERSY
The pivotal issue which requires determination, in the
aforesaid admitted factual matrix, is as to whether fixing 100
marks for the trial test and awarding the candidates marks in
the trial test on that basis out of 100, but thereafter reducing
the same to 25 by dividing the marks obtained in the trial test
by 4 has made any difference in the overall position of the
candidates in the merit list.

If it has, the judgment of the

Tribunal is perfectly valid.
11.

ARGUMENTS
Learned counsel for the petitioners, including counsel for
the Board Mr. V.K. Tandon, submitted that since the marks
obtained in the trial test of all the candidates were reduced to
1/4th, it had not made any difference in the overall results. It
was submitted that criteria was not changed inasmuch as from
the very beginning 25 marks were assigned for the trial test.
However, while giving the marks, for the sake of convenience,
these marks were awarded taking marks for the trial test as 100
and thereafter, as per the criteria originally fixed, the maximum
marks were reduced to 25. It was argued that when the marks
for trial test was fixed at 25 in the beginning, this parameter
could not have been given much importance as fixing 100 marks
for trial test and 25 each for past achievement and personality

WP (C) No. 16563-70/2004

nsk

Page 9 of 18

test would rather disturb the equilibrium and divide the object
of giving benefit to the meritorious sports persons.
12.

It was argued that by fixing 25 marks for trial all the three
factors, namely, past achievements, personality test and trial,
were given importance in proper ratio to meet the objective
sought to be achieved. It was also argued that if the marks for
trial are taken as 100 and for past achievement and personality
test 25 each, the candidates of individual sports having less
competition will get considerable lead vis-a-vis candidates
having specialization in team games.

For example, if in the

game of chess the candidates participating are less and of
district level and state level, naturally the competition would be
of less degree, but where the candidates participating in
another game, namely, boxing are of international and national
level, definitely competition would be of higher degree.

This

would be despite the fact that the petitioners are the players of
international and national repute, whereas the respondent No.3
has played at State Level or National Junior Level. It was also
argued that the respondent No.3 was not making place in the
selected list, whether trial marks are taken as 100 or 25 and,
therefore, he had no locus standi even to file the OA in view of
the judgment of the Supreme Court in Subhash Chander Bajaj
v. Kamal Singh Singhmar & Ors., 1998 (6) Scale (SP). Learned
counsel also pointed out that when there were no mala fides or
arbitrariness found in the selection process, it was not proper to
uproot the petitioners who have been serving for the last 8 years
and they should not be punished for no fault of theirs. Some of

WP (C) No. 16563-70/2004

nsk

Page 10 of 18

the petitioners have even joined their service after leaving their
earlier services. They had also crossed the age limit of 35 years
which is prescribed for getting such public employments and,
therefore, the decision would adversely affect them. In the end
it was submitted that once it is found from the record that the
selection criteria was never changed and during this period the
petitioners were appointed after due verifications of their
academic/sports qualifications, date of birth etc. and the
respondent No.3 was not coming within the selection zone, in
any case such a selection should not be quashed and the
petitioners should not be made to suffer in view of the dicta laid
down by the Supreme Court in the case of Reserve Bank of
India & Anr. v. C.L. Toora & Ors., (2004) 4 SCC 657.
13.

Mr. Tandon, learned counsel appearing for the Board, produced
list of candidates with their marks, report of Selection Board for
the recruitment of these posts and the merit list on the basis of
maximum trial marks of 100 as well as merit list taking
maximum trial marks at 25 by reducing the same to 1/4th in
order to show the impact of pro-rata reduction.

14.

Learned counsel for the respondent No.3, on the other hand,
gave the same arguments which were given before the Tribunal
and recorded in the judgment. He highlighted the irregularities
contained in the remarks made by the Govt. of NCT of Delhi in
the aforesaid tabulated form in respect of each selected
candidate and also submitted that by awarding the marks in
respect of trial test against 100 and reducing the same to 25
had adversely affected some of the candidates who were pushed

WP (C) No. 16563-70/2004

nsk

Page 11 of 18

down in the merit list. He, thus, submitted that in view of such
glaring illegalities and irregularities, the entire selection was
vitiated and the directions of the Tribunal quashing the
selections and not the entire selection process and preparing
the merit list on the basis of marks obtained by the candidates
in the trial test out of 100 was just and proper and should not
be interfered with.
15.

FINDINGS
We have considered the respective submissions and have
also gone through the records filed.
At the outset, we may mention that the Tribunal has
proceeded on the basis that for the trial test the Committee had
decided to award the marks out of 100 which were later on
reduced to 25 and this could not

have been changed

subsequently. This appears to be factually incorrect and is not
born from the record. On the contrary, it has been pointed out
by the Board that even before the selection process started,
criteria was formulated by the Selection Committee fixing 25
marks for trials, 60 marks for the past performance and 25
marks for interview. Therefore, observations of the Tribunal in
para 18 of the impugned judgment on the basis of aforesaid
premise, which is factually incorrect, is not sustainable.
16.

It appears that though for the trial test the maximum marks
were fixed at 25 by the Interview Board, at the time of
conducting those trials, candidates were awarded marks against
a score of 100. According to the Board, this was done only for
the sake of convenience, though such a reason is not very

WP (C) No. 16563-70/2004

nsk

Page 12 of 18

logical as marks could have been awarded for trial test even
against 25 without much difficulty.

Fact remains that if even

before the trials started the criteria for awarding marks was
fixed by the Selection Committee and the Committee had
decided to award marks out of 25 insofar as trial test is
concerned, we do not find any such serious irregularity in
reducing the marks to 25, i.e. reducing the marks awarded to
different candidates on dividing by 4. On the contrary, if the
marks for the trial are taken as 100, though initially fixed at 25,
we find merit in the contention of learned counsel for the
petitioners that this would act unfairly by giving much more
importance to the trial than what was decided in the beginning
and in those games where there were very less number of
candidates, such course of action would give them undue
advantage. It was for the Selection Committee to fix the criteria
and if they decided to give more importance to past record, this
yardstick for assessing the overall suitability cannot be changed.
In fact, as noted in the beginning, OA No. 1146/1999 filed by
one Shailesh Mudgil was dismissed by another coordinate Bench
vide orders dated 5.11.1999 giving some reasons.

In view

thereof, as held by the Apex Court in the case of S.I. Rooplal &
Anr. v. Lt. Governor through Chief Secretary, Delhi & Ors., JT
1999 (9) SC 597, if subsequent Bench in the impugned judgment
was taking contrary view, it should have referred the matter to a
larger Bench.
Be that as it may, since the matter is before us in the writ
petition, which is filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India, and we are undertaking judicial review of the impugned
WP (C) No. 16563-70/2004

nsk

Page 13 of 18

judgment, we have decided to deal with this matter on merits
with the concurrence of counsel for all the parties.
17.

Thus, whereas we do not find anything wrong in otherwise
reducing the marks to 25, the only aspect which needs
determination is as to whether by initially recording the marks
against 100 and thereafter reducing it to 25 has disturbed the
merit list by pushing down certain persons in the said list who
had gained substantial lead over the others.

18.

As mentioned above, we have directed the Board to undertake
this exercise and Mr. Tandon produced the two merit lists – one
prepared on the basis of giving 100 marks and the other on the
basis of maximum marks of 25 against the trial rest. We find
that it had not made any substantial difference to the course of
selection. No doubt, position of some of the candidates have
changed, but it has had hardly any impact on the final selection.
We may point out that insofar as the respondent No.3 is
concerned, his position was at S.No. 137 when the marks are
given out of 100 and he would be at S.No. 55 when the marks
are awarded out of 25. Therefore, he remains out of contention
in either case.

19.

We also find force in the argument of learned counsel for the
petitioners that in the entire selection process, insofar as the
petitioners are concerned, they are not to be blamed. Moreover,
there are no mala fides or arbitrariness attributed to the
Selection Board. The only irregularity, even if it is presumed to
be so, was that though before the selection process started

WP (C) No. 16563-70/2004

nsk

Page 14 of 18

maximum marks against trial test was fixed at 25, at the time of
taking trials candidates were awarded the marks against 100 in
this category, but again while making the final merit list these
marks were divided by 4 to bring it at part with the selection
criteria fixed in the beginning.

After their selections, the

petitioners have been working for last more than eight years.
Many of them left their earlier service and they are now even
over age.
20.

Thus, taking a holistic view of the matter, keeping in view all the
aforesaid considerations and also the observations of the
Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v. K.P. Tiwari,
2003 SCC (L&S) 1233, it would not be appropriate to interfere
with the appointments of these persons at this stage.

We,

therefore, make the rule absolute, allow this writ petition, set
aside the impugned judgment passed by the Tribunal and
dismiss the OA filed by the respondent No.3 herein.

There

shall, however, be no order as to costs.
