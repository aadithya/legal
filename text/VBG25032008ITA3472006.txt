V.B.GUPTA,J.
The following substantial question of law arises in the
ITA No.347/2006

Page 1 of 7

present appeal:“Whether the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal was correct in law in quashing
the assessment framed by the Assessing
Officer on the ground that notice under
Section 143(2) of the Income Tax Act,
1961 was not served upon the Assessee
within the prescribed period?”
The facts in brief are that Assessee filed his return on
31st October, 2001 declaring loss of Rs.8,37,355/-. Notice
under Section 143(2) of the Act was issued by the
Assessing Officer on 23rd October, 2002 and thereafter on
18th December, 2002 fixing the case for hearing on 29 th
October, 2002 and 24th December, 2002. None attended in
response to these notices. Accordingly, Assessing Officer
again issued notice under Section 142(1) of the Act on 29th
January, 2003 fixing the case on 7th February, 2003. This
notice was also not complied with.

Accordingly, the

Assessing Officer framed assessment under Section 144 of
the Act and disallowed the claim of the Assessee with
ITA No.347/2006

Page 2 of 7

respect

to

advertisement

and

public

expenses

of

Rs.8,87,917/-, as the Assessee did not furnish any evidence
in support of his claim despite of it being specifically asked.
Aggrieved with the assessment order passed by the
Assessing Officer, the Assessee filed an appeal before the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) (in short as „CIT
[A]‟) also challenging the assessment order on the ground
that notice under Section 143(2) of the Act was not served
on the Assessee within the prescribed period. The CIT(A)
held that notice was issued by the Assessing Officer on 23 rd
October, 2002 i.e. within the prescribed period and the
assessment order framed by the Assessing Officer was
upheld.
Being dissatisfied with the order passed by the
CIT(A), the Assessee filed an appeal before the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal (for short as „Tribunal‟) and the Tribunal
vide the impugned order dated 31st May, 2005 passed in
ITA No.918(Del)/2005 for the assessment year 2001-02

ITA No.347/2006

Page 3 of 7

quashed the assessment as well as the demand raised in
pursuance thereto, on the ground that notice under Section
143(2) of the Act was not served upon the Assessee within
a period of limitation as prescribed under Section 143(2) of
the Act.
Now, the Revenue has filed the present appeal
challenging the impugned order passed by the Tribunal.
It has been contended by learned counsel for the
Revenue that notice in question was issued on 23rd
October, 2002 and the same was dispatched on 25 th
October, 2002 and since the same has not been received
back undelivered, there is a presumption under the law
that notice has reached the Assessee.
Learned counsel for the Respondent has relied upon
the order passed by the Tribunal and has contended that
no notice has been served within the prescribed period.
Service of notice under Section 143(2) of the Act must
be affected in the manner laid down in Section 282 of the

ITA No.347/2006

Page 4 of 7

Act.
Section 282(1) of the Act which is relevant for
deciding the present controversy, reads as under:“S.282 Service of notice generally-(1)
A notice or requisition under this Act
may be served on the person therein
named either by post or as if it were a
summons issued by a court under the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of
1908).”
In the present case, the notice has been issued on
23rd October, 2002 and was sent through speed post from
I.P. Estate Post Office on 25th October, 2002 at the address
of the company as per return which has been mentioned by
the Assessing Officer in his remand report.
Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 provides
that service by post is deemed to have been effected by
properly addressing, pre-paying and posting by registered
post, a letter containing the notice required to be served.
Unless the contrary is proved the service is deemed to have

ITA No.347/2006

Page 5 of 7

been effected at the time when the letter would be
delivered in the ordinary course of post.
Though this presumption is rebuttable but in the
absence of proof to contrary, the presumption of proper
service or effective service of the notice would arise. There
is nothing on record to show that the notice dated 23 rd
October, 2002 dispatched on 25th October, 2002 by speed
post was undelivered or received back. Under the normal
circumstances, a presumption will lie that this notice has
reached the Assessee within 2/3 days. Since the envelope
containing the notice in question has not been received
back

by

the

Income

Tax

Department,

there

is

a

presumption that it has reached the Assessee and, this
presumption has not been rebutted by the Assessee at all.
No affidavit has been filed by the Assesse to the effect that
the notice was not received by it.
Under these circumstances, we hold that notice under
Section 143(2) of the Act was served upon the Assessee

ITA No.347/2006

Page 6 of 7

within the prescribed period and as such this finding given
by the Tribunal that no notice under Section 143(2) have
been served upon the Assessee within the prescribed
period is hereby set aside and the substantial question of
law is decided in the negative in favour of the Revenue and
against the Assessee.
Accordingly, the present appeal stands allowed.
