1.

These writ petitions raise questions relating to the

manner of exercise of the discretion conferred on the respondents
to permit migrations of students from one course and institutions
under the Delhi University to another.

The impugned order

passed in all the petitions is the same and questions raised being
identical, these petitions have been taken up together for hearing
and disposal.
However, it is necessary to note facts of each case in
order to appreciate the contentions of the petitioners and the
same are so noted.
2. Facts in Writ Petition(C) No. 20013/04 entitled
Radhika Garg vs Delhi University
(i)

The petitioner in this case has claimed that she had a

brilliant academic record and scored over 74% in the school
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 2 of 84

leaving examination conducted by the Central Board of Secondary
Eduction. Based on her grading, she was admitted to the B.Sc.
General (Industrial Chemistry) course and was allotted the Atma
Ram Sanatan Dharam College by the Delhi University(arrayed as
respondent no. 1 herein). The petitioner had deposited fees in
respect of such admission in the said college on the 16 th October,
2003.
(ii)

It is submitted that the petitioner was suffering medical

problems for which she was under treatment at the Deen Dayal
Upadhyaya Hospital and could not continue this course. Copy of
the out patient ticket of this hospital of October, 2003 bearing
OPD no. 48679/2003 has been placed on record. The petitioner
has submitted that on account of her medical condition, she was
unable to attend her practical classes and was finding it difficult to
pursue the course.

As such she made an application to the

Chairman of the Standing Students Council of the University of
Delhi seeking transfer of her course from B.Sc. General (Industrial
Chemistry)

to

B.A.(Honors)

English/B.Com(Honors)/B.Com.(Pass).
In the same application, apart from the change of
course, the petitioner also pointed out that she had scored the
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 3 of 84

requisite percentage of marks or met the cut off percentage for
admission to these courses in the same college and that she also
met the percentage required for admission to these courses in the
School of Correspondence Course & Continuing Education.
(iii)

This application appears to have been received by the

authorities on the 17th February, 2004. The Principal of the ARSD
College put an endorsement thereon to the following effect
therein:-

(iv)

“She was admitted on 16th October, 2003.
Her case has been sent to the University for
condonation of delay in Admissions 2003 2004 vide letter no. 2172 dated 10th
December, 2003. Forwarded Sd/- 9.2.2004 ”
The undisputed factual position is that the Standing

Committee of the Academic Council of the Delhi University
considered this application of the petitioner alongwith the
applications made by sixteen others students in its meeting on 16th
April, 2004. The applicants were called for the meeting and after
hearing the applicants, the Standing Committee recommended
change of courses and change of institution to the School of
Correspondence Courses and Continuing Eduction in respect of
the present petitioner whose name featured at serial no. 14 of the
list.

(v)

The

petitioner

submits

that

based

on

this

recommendation of the Standing Committee, the petitioner had
approached the Principal of the School of Correspondence
Courses and Continuing Education(respondent no. 2 herein) and
submitted an application for permission to take admission in
B.Com(P) as per the recommendation of the Standing Committee.
The position with regard to the recommendation of the standing
committee was confirmed from the authorities and directions
were issued by the respondent no. 2 for issuance of the prospectus
as per endorsement on the application of the petitioner itself. The
petitioner was also directed to deposit the fees and as such, the
petitioner had deposited the requisite charges vide a receipt
bearing serial no. 4866 dated 26th April, 2004.
(vi)

The petitioner has submitted that the admission granted

to her was unconditional and absolute and there was nothing
provisional in the admission granted to her by the respondent no.
2. The petitioner was never informed that her admission was
subject to any resolution or acceptance of any other authority of
the respondent no. 1.
(vii)

According to the petitioner, she pursued her course of

B.Com(P) and was issued the admission ticket no. 4552774 for
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 5 of 84

taking examinations for the B.Com(P) - Part I Examination by
both the respondents. This admission ticket was issued by the
Controller of Examinations and bears the counter signature of the
Principal of the respondent no. 2.

It is submitted that the

examinations for the said course were held on 28th , 31st of May
and 2nd June, 2004 as per the admission tickets.
(viii)

There was no objection whatsoever either to the

admission of the petitioner or her candidature at any time even
when she took her examination.
(ix)

It appears that the petitioner was awaiting her result but

the same had not been declared without any reason. To the shock
of the petitioner she received a letter dated 18th November, 2004
from the School of Correspondence Courses and Continuing
Education(respondent no. 2 herein) to the following effect :“To,
Ms. Radhika Garg,
G-15, Maharani Bag
New Delhi-110065.
Subject: Cancellation of admission

session 2003-2004 on the recommendation
of the Standing Committee(Students) subject
to the approval of the Academic Council.
In this connection, I am to inform
you that the Academic Council has rejected
your request for admission by the Resolution
dated 18.06.2004. Hence the provisional
admission granted to you is being cancelled
and no further correspondences will be
entertained in this regard.
Yours faithfully,
Sd/Officer-on-Special Duty”
The petitioner has impugned the cancellation of her
admission to the course in question by this letter on several
grounds which are noticed hereafter.
(x)

Despite earnest efforts and representations to the

respondents nothing fruitful resulted necessitating the filing of
this petition.
3.
Facts in W.P.(C) 1467/2005 entitled Ayushman
Kakoty vs
Delhi University
(i)

Ayushman Kakoty has asserted that he was admitted to

the B.A.(Pass) course being conducted by Dr. Zakir Hussain
College on the 8th July, 2003. He has stated in his petition that his
attendance was falling short due to reasons of ill health. He had
therefore sought migration from his regular course of study to the
B.A.(Pass) course conducted by the School of Correspondence and

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 7 of 84

Continuing Education.
According to this petition, he had made this request as
he did not want his health problems to cause any impediment to
his studies.
(ii)

The application of this petitioner for change institution

was also considered by the Standing Committee of the Academic
Council of the respondent no. 1 in its meeting on 16th April, 2004.
According to the petitioner he was called for the meeting in order
to support his application for migration and only thereafter his
case was approved by this committee. The petitioner was asked to
complete all formalities for effecting migration of the institution to
the

School

of

Correspondence

Courses

and

Continuing

Education(arrayed as respondent no.2 herein) which he duly
completed.
(iii)

The petitioner has placed on record photocopies of his

application to the respondent no. 2 and placed reliance on the
endorsement made in his favour based on the recommendation of
the Standing Committee of the respondent no. 1. The petitioner
has contended that his admission to the respondent no.2 was
unconditional and

the directions to issue prospectus and

acceptance of fees were also unconditional.

He was issued a

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 8 of 84

receipt dated 26th April, 2004 by the respondent no. 2 after
acceptance of the fees.
The petitioner was never informed that his admission
was only “provisional” or that there was any requirement of its
approval by the academic council.
(iv)

The petitioner submits that he was issued an admission

ticket by the respondents in view of acceptance of the validity of
his admission to the respondent no. 2 and he took his
examinations without any objection. The result of the examination
of this petitioner is stated to have been declared on the 9th
November, 2004 but was allegedly removed from the notice
board.
(v)

To the shock of the petitioner, he received a letter which

was dated 10th November, 2004 from the respondent no. 2 to the
following effect :“Mr. Ayushman Kakoty,
Kala Guru Bishnu Rabha Path

Condonation of delay category, on the basis
of the decision of Sub-Committee of the

Now the above mentioned decision
of Sub-Committee of Standing Committee of
the Students were not accepted by the
Academic Council, University of Delhi, Delhi7.
Therefore,
the
provisional
admission granted to you is hereby cancelled
and your name has been struck off from the
rolls.

(vi)

Yours faithfully,
Sd/-Officer-on Special Duty”
The petitioner immediately made a representation

dated 11th November, 2004 to the Dean of Students Welfare of
respondent no. 1 which also recommended the same for
consideration.

However, as no action was taken by the

respondents in favour of the petitioner, he has been compelled to
file the present writ petition impugning the cancellation of his
admission by the respondents.
4. Facts in W.P.(C) 652/2005 entitled Kavita Dhawan vs
Delhi
University
(i)

This petitioner has contended that she was admitted to

the B.A.(Hon.) Course in English in the Delhi College of Arts and

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 10 of 84

Commerce under the ageis of the University of Delhi in the year
2001. It appears that she had scored 70% marks in her school
leaving examination.
She finished her first and second years in the said
course in the college and was undergoing the final year when she
suffered from facial paralysis in August, 2003 effecting the
complete left side of her face including her left eye. The petitioner
submits that she was under treatment for this at the Max Hospital
at Panchsheel and later was under the treatment of Dr. L.K.
Malhotra, a renowned neurologist.
In order to treat the paralysis, it has been submitted
that the petitioner had to take strong steroid based medicines.
The petitioner has averred that the medication did not have the
desired results till 17th November, 2003 and the petitioner was
advised to go for surgical consultation in case the paralysis did not
recede. Fortunately, from the period November, 2003 to March,
2004, the petitioner started gradually recovering although she
remained unable to attend regular classes in the College.
(ii)

It is submitted that the petitioner was fearful of having

to lose an academic year, which would have jeopardised her
ambition to undergo the MBA course at the scheduled time. In
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 11 of 84

these circumstances, the petitioner is stated to have submitted an
application dated 31st March, 2004 to the Principal of her college
seeking permission to complete her education with the School of
Correspondence Courses and Continuing Education where such
shortage of attendance would not have been a factor for eligibility
to take the examination.
The

Principal

of

the

college

recommended

the

petitioner's case and made an endorsement on the application to
the following effect :-

(iii)

“Forwarded with a request that college has no
objection if she is considered as a special case”
The application of the petitioner was placed before the

sub- committee of the Standing Committee(students) of the
Academic Council University of Delhi on the 6th April, 2004. This
committee recommended the petitioner's migration to the School
of Correspondence Courses and Continuing Education and made
the following recommendation :“May allow as special case to migrate to SCC”
This recommendation of the sub-committee was placed
before the Standing Committee(students) of the University of
Delhi in its meeting held on 16th April, 2004 wherein a resolution
approving the recommendation of the sub-committee was passed.
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 12 of 84

(iv)

Based on these recommendations, the petitioner

appears to have approached the Principal of the Delhi College of
Arts and Commerce who issued her the requisite certificate of
migration

dated

21st

April,

2004.

The

petitioner

was

unconditionally admitted as a student of the School of
Correspondence Courses and Continuing Education on the
recommendations of the Standing Committee on the 23rd April,
2004. The petitioner deposited the fees against receipt on the
same date in the said institution. Thereafter the admission ticket
was issued by the respondents to the petitioner o take the IIIrd
year examination which were to be held in May, 2004.
(v)

It appears that there was no objection taken to the

candidature of the petitioner at any point of time and she
undertook the examination which were conducted between 13th
May, 2004 to 22nd May, 2004. The result of the petitioner was
declared on the 2nd August, 2004 when she was declared
successful in the B.A. (English Honors) Part III Examination by
the respondents.

The respondents also issued the provisional

mark sheet and provisional degree, certificate dated 2nd August,
2004 to the petitioner.
(vi)

The petitioner has submitted that as she was granted

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 13 of 84

admission in the School of Correspondence and Continuing
Courses Education, she did not join any other course nor could
she continue to pursue her studies as the regular students of Delhi
College of Arts and Commerce. Admission to the fresh session for
the B.A.(English Honors) Part III started in the college from July,
2004.

Based on the mark sheet and provisional degree, the

petitioner took admission to a MBA programme in the Institute of
Management Technology Ghaziabad(Distant Learning) and paid
her fees for the post graduate course. Additionally, the petitioner
applied for the post of Cabin crew in the Singapore Airlines on the
basis of the mark sheet and provisional degree certificate granted
by the University in October, 2004. The petitioner was one out of
the six candidates selected from Delhi out of thousands who had
applied for the post.
(vii)

To the shock of the petitioner, in November, 2004 she

received a letter dated 15th October, 2004 from the School of
Correspondence and Continuing Education whereby she was
informed that her request for migration from the Delhi College of
Arts and Commerce to the School of Correspondence Courses had
not been accepted by the University authorities and hence the
provisional admission granted to her had been cancelled and her
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 14 of 84

name struck off the rolls. The letter dated 15th October, 2004

The petitioner submits that she made representations to

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 15 of 84

the Vice Chancellor of the Delhi University which were dated 7th
November, 2004 and 6th December, 2004.

No reply was

forthcoming to these communications.
Only on 7th January, 2005, the petitioner's mother
received a letter dated 5th December, 2004 from the respondents
directing her to see the Section Officer of the respondent no. 1
alongwith the original of the mark sheet and provisional certificate
of B.A. (Honors English) Part III which had been issued to the
petitioner on the ground that the provisional admission to her had
been cancelled by the Delhi University.

(ix)

In these circumstances, the petitioner was left with no

option but to file the present writ petition impugning the letters
dated 15th October, 2004 and 5th December, 2004 and praying for
a direction to the respondents to issue the final degree to the
petitioner as she has passed her B.A.(Honors English) Part III
Examination.
(x)

Alongwith the writ petition, the petitioner has filed a

copy of a judgment dated 5th November, 2004 passed in Writ
Petition(C) no. 17174/2004 entitled Chandni Mehra vs University
of Delhi. It is contended that Chandni Mehra was the other
candidate in whose favour also the sub-committee had made
recommendations on 6th April, 2004 which were identical to those
in favour of the petitioner. It is submitted that Chandni Mehra
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 17 of 84

and the petitioner were the only two cases considered on 6th of
April,

2004

whose

request

for

admission/migration

was

recommended purely on medical grounds. It is pointed out that
the facts relating to the petitioner have been noticed by the court
in this judgment whereby the decision of the academic council and
the action of the respondents in cancelling admission has been set
aside and quashed. The petitioner before me has contended that
she is entitled to parity of treatment and grant of the writ petition
as prayed for.
(xi)

It has further been submitted that migration is provided

for under Ordinance IV of the University Calender and that
attendance is irrelevant for the purposes of consideration of an
application for migration.

As the application was beyond the

stipulated date, therefore exemption under Ordinance XC became
necessary.

The submission of the petitioner is Ordinance VII

being relied upon by the respondents has no application in the
instant case.
5.

The respondents have appeared in answer to the notice

to show cause and have filed counter affidavits in two of these
matters. Original records relating to the consideration by the
Standing Committee as well as the Academic Council have been
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 18 of 84

also placed before me. The respondents' case rests principally on
the plea that the petitioners were amongst several students who
were short of attendance and did not have the necessary
attendance percentages which would have enabled them to take
the annual examinations in their respective courses. According to
the respondents, as per clause 2(ii) of Ordinance VII of the
University Calender read with Appendix 2, a candidate must have
attended at least two thirds i.e. 66% of the lectures and practicals
separately in the course which were being pursued by them.
Having failed to achieve this percentage and being aware that the
respective petitioner would not be permitted to sit for the annual
examination in her/his respective courses, the petitioners made
applications seeking migration to the School of Correspondence
and Continuing Education at the highly belated stage barely
before the end of the academic session. It is submitted that as per
the notified Bulletin of Information, no migration is permissible
after 31st December, 2003 and that the applications of the
petitioners reflects abuse of provisions relating to migration.
Appearing for the respondents, Ms.Maninder Acharya,
Advocate has contended that all the applications were based on
medical grounds which were not genuine and that the medical
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 19 of 84

certificates were only a camouflage for the real reason which was
shortage of attendance.
It has been vehemently contended by Ms.Maninder
Acharya, learned counsel for the respondents that the petitioners
were aware that the admission granted to them was provisional
and, therefore, derive no benefit from the fact that they were
permitted to take admission in the School of Correspondence
Courses & Continuing Education.
In these circumstances it has been vehemently urged
that the Academic Council was justified in rejecting the
application for condonation of delay in the 16 cases placed before
it which included the cases of the petitioners.
6.

According to the respondents, the highly belated

applications seeking migration made only on account of the
candidates being short of attendance in the courses to which they
had been admitted could not have been granted and for this
reason the recommendation of the standing committee(students)
made in its meeting on 16th April, 2004 were not approved by the
Academic Council of the Delhi University in its meeting dated 18th
June, 2004.
7.

The respondents have pointed out that the delayed

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 20 of 84

applications could be granted only if the delay in making them was
condoned by the Academic Council under Ordinance X(C) of the
University Calender. It has been submitted that the Academic
Council alone has been empowered by this provision and granted
discretion to grant condonation and exemption from operation of
the Ordinances governing admissions of students, migration etc
and that such discretion can be favourably exercised only in
exceptional cases provided that two thirds of the members of the
academic council present in the meeting agreed with the same.
According to Ms. Acharya, as the applications were
beyond the last date for migration, therefore they had to be
treated as if they were applications seeking fresh admissions.
Therefore Ordinance IV would have no relevance in the instant
case.
8.

It was in these circumstances and in view of the

resolution dated 18th June, 2004 passed by the academic council
that the provisional admissions given to the petitioners were
cancelled by the School of Correspondence and Continuing
Education vide its letter dated 15th October, 2004 and 5th
December, 2004. The respondents have defended their action
and decisions on the plea that the Academic Council has exercised
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 21 of 84

its discretion under the statutory provisions governing its actions.
It has been submitted that the issues raised in the writ petitions
are matters best left to academic experts and that the present writ
petitions would not be maintainable especially in view of the
conduct of the petitioners.
9.

According

to

the

respondents,

one

of

the

petitioners(namely Kavita Dhawan) was short of attendance even
in her first and second year of the course in her college and was
permitted to take the examination only upon her giving an
undertaking that she would make up the deficiency in her
attendance in the next year. This petitioner is stated to have zero
percent attendance in the final year as per information received
by the respondents on the 17th of January, 2005.
10.

Reliance has also been placed on a judgment dated 3rd

December, 2004 passed in Civil Writ No. 18485/2004 filed by one
Sh. Satish Bhatti impugning the same decision dated 18 th June,
2004 of the Academic Council wherein his request for migration
was also rejected alongwith that of the present petitioners.
According to the respondents for the reasons given in this
judgment dated 18th June, 2004, the writ petitions which are the
subject matter of the present adjudication also deserved to be
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 22 of 84

dismissed.
11.

Learned counsel appearing for the respondents has also

submitted that no show cause notice is required nor any
opportunity for hearing was required to be given inasmuch as the
petitioners were all aware that their admission was provisional
and that the approval of the Academic Council was necessary.
12.

Learned

counsel

Mr.

Arun

Bhardwaj,

Advocate

appearing for the petitioner Radhika Garg has placed reliance on
the judgment of this court reported in 2003 VII AD(Delhi) 349
entitled Avijit Bansal vs University of Delhi & Ors. in support of
his submission that having received the application seeking
migration of the petitioner, the respondents were duty bound to
act with utmost urgency.

On the contrary, even though the

respondents were fully aware of the recommendations of the
Standing Committee and the consequential admission of the
petitioner to the course in the School of Correspondence Courses
and Continuing Education, the respondents themselves issued the
roll number to the petitioner and permitted her to take the
examination. The meeting of the Academic Council was not held
till 18th June, 2004.
Without giving any opportunity of hearing or putting
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 23 of 84

the petitioner to notice, the Academic Council cryptically ignored
the recommendations of the Standing Committee and decided that
they be not accepted.
It has been contended that there was no material
whatsoever before the academic council to the effect as has been
stated in the counter affidavit or placed before the court in the oral
submissions with regard to the attendance record of the
petitioner.
13.

It is further submitted that despite passing of the said

resolution, the Academic Council took no step whatsoever to
notify the petitioner of the same. The petitioner remained under
the bona fide impression that the result would be declared. The
petitioner was permitted to even join other courses or to pursue
the second year of the course.

It has been submitted that

cancellation of the admission would ruin the career of the
petitioner and shall not benefit anyone and as such ought not to be
permitted to sustain.
14.

Learned counsel

appearing for Radhika Garg has

further contended that the Academic Council was an authority
created under the Delhi University Act and therefore being a
public authority is required to give reasons for its decisions to
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 24 of 84

ensure compliance with the natural justice.
It is particularly necessary when it was cancelling the
admission of students. It has been submitted that despite the
adjudication against the University of Delhi in the aforestated
decision rendered in Avijit Bansal's case(supra) on 20th June,
2003, the respondents have failed to abide by the mandate of this
court.
15.

It is submitted that the respondents are bound by

principles of promissory estoppel having permitted the petitioner
to take admission and pursue the course, take the examination
and to permit continuation of the course and that the discretion
conferred on the academic council in Ordinance XC has to be
exercised in favour of the petitioner keeping in view the
recommendations of the standing committee.
16.

In addition to the submissions made in the other

petitions, Mr. Sanveer Mehlwal, Advocate for Ayushman Kakoty
has placed reliance on the pronouncement of this court in 2002
III AD (Delhi) 81 entitled Liya Belliappa vs CBSE in support of his
contention that the respondent was bound by principles of
promissory estoppel, principles of natural justice and fair play to
continue with the course to which he had been admitted and that
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 25 of 84

the writ petition deserve to be allowed inasmuch as there was no
mis-representation by the petitioner and no statutory rules were
being followed if the petition was granted.
Reliance has also been placed on the judgment of the
Apex Court rendered in Sanatan Gauda's case reported at 1990(3)
SCR 23 in support of this submission.
17.

It is also submitted by Mr. Mehlwal, learned counsel for

Ayushman Kakoty that it was bounden duty of the respondents to
have

scrutinised the matter thoroughly before permitting the

migration of the petitioner and admission to the School of
Correspondence

Courses

and

Continuing

Education

and

permitting him to appear in the examination. Learned counsel
has also drawn my attention to the judgment of the Division
Bench of this court reported at 43 (1991) DLT 670 entitled
Kanishka Aggarwal vs University of Delhi & Ors. in support of the
submission that the petitioner was not put to notice by the
respondents in any manner that the admission to the School of
Correspondence

Courses

and

Continuing

Education

was

provisional or that it was subject to confirmation by the academic
council.

It is submitted that in the instant case, the Division

Bench has held that the University of Delhi was estopped from
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 26 of 84

cancelling provisional admission to the LLB course of the
petitioner in that case.
18.

Appearing for Kavita Dhawan, it has been contended by

Ms.Rachna Joshi, Advocate that the orders passed by the
respondents have been impugned by the petitioner inter alia on
the submission that the application of the petitioner for migration
is to be processed in terms of Ordinance IV of the University
Calender and that Ordinance VII relied upon by the respondents
had no application as the petitioners were not seeking
condonation of shortage of attendance. It has been submitted that
the reason for creation of School of Correspondence and
Continuing Education is to provide for such like contingencies as
in the present case and to ensure that there is no break in the
academic course being pursued by a student.
19.

According to Ms. Joshi appearing for the petitioner, the

petitioner was given an opportunity for hearing by the Standing
Committee which made the recommendations after considering
each case on its merit. Therefore, the admission given to the
petitioners upon such recommendations by the Standing
Committee cannot be cancelled without grant of notice to show
cause and opportunity of hearing and after compliance with the
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 27 of 84

principles of audi alteram partem.
20.

The petitioner has vehemently objected to the purported

grounds for cancellation of admission as have been submitted on
behalf of the respondents in the affidavit and in the oral
submissions. Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the
Supreme

Court

reported

at

1952(1)

SCR

135

entitled

Commissioner of Police Bombay vs Gordhan Dass Bhanji, it has
been submitted that an order made by an authority must speak for
itself and that it cannot be construed in the light of explanations
subsequently given.
21.

Learned counsel is placing reliance on the equitable

principles of promissory estoppel to urge that the petitioner has
acted upon the recommendations of the Standing Committee.
Based on the admission given to her by the School of
Correspondence Courses and Continuing Education, she forfeited
her right to pursue her regular course in the Delhi College of Arts
and Commerce and has undertaken the examinations on the
validity of the admission given. Based on the results thereof, the
petitioner has taken admission in the MBA course, paid fees and
also accepted employment. At this stage, the respondents are
bound by the principles of promissory estoppel and cannot be
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 28 of 84

heard to challenge the legality of the petitioner to have been
granted admission to the School of Correspondence and
Continuing Education or cancel the admission of the petitioner.
In this behalf reliance has been placed on 1989(3) SCC 362
entitled Dr. Mrs.Sheela Ashok Patwardhan vs Dean, Dr. V.M.
Medical College, Slapurt & Ors., 1990 Volume 3 SCR 23 entitled
Sanatan Gauda vs Berhampur University & Ors.
22.

The petitioner has urged that the respondents cannot

plead doctrine of freedom of administrative action in support of
their contentions that they had the authority to override any
equity in favour of the petitioner on the ground of principles of
promissory estoppel by virtue of this doctrine. According to the
petitioner, the respondents had pre-determined the issue
inasmuch as the Vice Chancellor had recorded a noting on the file
that the admissions have to be cancelled before the matter was
placed before the Academic Council. It has been submitted that
there was inherent bias on the subject matter inasmuch as in view
of the noting recorded by the Vice Chancellor the consideration by
the Academic Council remained an empty formality and was really
a foregone conclusion inasmuch as the Vice Chancellor was the
Chairman of the Academic Council. In this behalf the petitioner
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 29 of 84

has placed reliance on the judgment of the Apex Court reported in
2002(2) SCC 290 entitled

Amar Nath Chowdhury

Vs. Braithwaite and Co. Ltd. and others; 1977(1) SCR 64 entitled
G.Sarana vs University of Lucknow.
23.

Having thus noticed the factual matrix and the

submissions made on behalf of the parties, it would be useful to
set down the relevant legal provisions and the law on the subject.
24.

The

respondents

have

been

created

under

the

provisions of the Delhi University Act, 1922. In exercise of powers
under this enactment, Ordinances and Statutes have been
provided in order to ensure proper functioning of the various
constituents of the respondents and to enable effective discharge
of its functions. Migration from one course to another is provided
under the provisions of Ordinances IV of the University Calender
which reads as under :“Ord. IV - Migration
1. (1)
A student who has not completed
his course of study or having completed his
course of study has not appeared at the
examination for which he was reading in any
other Indian University or in any College
under the control of a Board of Intermediate
Education shall not be admitted to the
University except on production of the
following documents :
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 30 of 84

(a)
leaving certificate from
the Principal of the College or from the
Registrar of the University he is leaving;
(b)
certified copies of the
report of attendance against his name in the
register of students of the University ;or the
College concerned.
(2)
Admission of a student to the
University in the second academic year of
study for a degree examination may only be
allowed on the ground that the parent or
guardian of the student is residing in or has
migrated to Delhi.
(3)
In all cases of migration a certificate
is required from the Principal of the College to
which admission is sought by a student to the
effect that he has attended a sufficient number
of lectures in the subjects offered by him at
this University in the College or the University
from which he migrates, so as to enable him to
complete the course of study prescribed by the
University.
2.
Applications for migration from the
College of the University to another shall only
be entertained by the Principal if forwarded by
the Principal of the College from which
migration is sought, and the necessary
alteration in the enrolment entries shall only
be made in the University Register by the
Registrar after obtaining the consent in
writing of both Principals.”
25.

It is necessary to examine the provisions which

empower the Academic Council to grant exemption from the
operation of any of the ordinances governing admissions and

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 31 of 84

migrations of students. The same reads as under :“Ord. X-C. Permissive Provisions
The Academic Council may, in
exceptional cases grant exemption from the
operation of any of the Ordinances governing
admission of students, migration, the courses
to be pursued by them, attendance at lectures
or sessional or other work or the examination
of candidates and authorise what is proper to
be done instead in such cases, provided that
no such exemption and authority shall be
deemed to have been granted unless not less
than two-thirds of the members present of the
Academic Council voted in favour of the
motion for such exemption nd authority made,
by, or with the written authority of the ViceChancellor; and
Provided further that this two-thirds
majority voting for the exemption should not
be less than half the total strength of the
Academic Council at the time.”
26.

The respondents have placed reliance on the provisions

of Ordinance VII 2(2) which reads as under:“(2) The required conditions shall not be deemed
to have been satisfied in respect of the following
degrees unless the candidate has attended not
less than two-thirds of lectures and practicals,
separately, delivered in his College or the
University, as the case may be, for the course of
study in each academic year:
B.A. (Pass) and (Honours) B.A. (Vocational
Studies)
B.Com (Pass) and (Honours)
B.A. (Honours) Music
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 32 of 84

B.Sc.(General) and (Honours)
Provided that in the case of Honours Courses and
B.Sc. (General) Course attendance as above will
be required to be put in separately in the Main
Subject in the case of Honours Courses and in
Group `B' subjects in the case of B.Sc.(General)
Courses and in the Qualifying/Subsidiary
Subjects in each academic year.
Other conditions regarding attendance
in respect of these courses shall be as laid down
in Appendix II of this Ordinance.”
27.

Appearing for the respondents, Ms. Maninder Acharya

has also placed on record the Resolution No.228 and 232 of the
Academic Council of the University of Delhi whereby the Standing
Committee of the Academic Council was constituted.
Resolution reads as under:“228. The Council took up for consideration the
cases of students involving late admissions,
permission to appear at the examinations beyond
the permissible span period, relaxation of
requirement of attendance at lectures etc. etc.
The Council was of the view that the order to
have a consistent approach in such matters and
to save time of the Council spent in examining
detailed circumstances of such cases, it would be
desirable if all such cases before being brought
on the agenda of the Council were initially
examined by a Standing Committee of the
Academic Council and only such cases were
brought before the Council for consideration as
were recommended by the Said Standing
Committee.
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 33 of 84

This

After discussion, it was decided that a Standing
Committee of the Academic Council be
constituted to scrutinize all such cases of
students in future and subject to procedural
requirements of Ordinance X-A wherever this
Ordinance required to be invoked, only such
cases be brought before the Academic Council as
would be recommended by the Committee. The
Council further ordered the Vice-Chancellor to
constitute the Standing Committee for the
purpose and further decided that all the cases
which were before the Council under items
Nos.7,8,9,10,22,41,46,55,
56,57,58,59,60,61,68,69, and 70 of the Agenda
be referred to the Standing Committee for
scrutiny and consideration in the first instance.
232. The Vice Chancellor reported that as
authorised by the Academic Council at its
meeting held on 17th February, 1975 had
constituted the Standing Committee, to consider
the case of students, consisting of the undernoted persons:
1. Prof. U.N.Singh-Chairman
2. Prof. I.P.Singh
3. Prof.R.C.Pandeya
4. Prof.R.S.Nigam
5. Prof.Urmila Khanna

Learned counsel appearing for the University of Delhi

has produced the original record of the Standing Committee as
well as of the Academic Council dated 18th June, 2004 before me.
The parties have taken me carefully through the records of the
writ petitions.

I have given my considered thought to all the

submissions raised before me.
29.

The core issue which requires consideration in these

matters can be summarised as follows:-

(i)
Whether there is any discretion in the
Academic Council to reject applications seeking
migration or refuse to condone delays for such
applications seeking migration on the ground
that the applicants were short of attendance in
the regular courses to which they had been
admitted;
(ii)
What is the effect of the noting dated
th
24 May, 2004 made by the Vice Chancellor
prior to the meeting of the academic council on
18th June, 2004;
(iii)
Whether the resolution dated 18th
June, 2004 is based on relevant material and
consideration and could have been passed
without service of show cause notice and
opportunity of hearing by the Academic Council;

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 35 of 84

30.

I find that issues regarding migration have arisen before

this court in earlier writ petitions decided by this court. One such
petition, where the rights of students and the power of the
University of Delhi to grant or permit migration came up for
consideration was Civil Writ Petition 3089/1995 entitled Sumeet
Sawhney vs the Principal Sri. Aurobindo College and Ors. The
University in these petitions had taken a stand that no university
or college can bind or compel the student to study in a particular
college if the student seeks migration elsewhere. However the
petition was being opposed by the college from which the
migration was sought. This was based on the decision of the
college and the requirement under Ordinance IV of the no
objection from the college. In these circumstances in its judgment
dated 19th October, 1995 the Division Bench held as under :“Though the anxiety of the Staff Council
and the College to maintain and improve
the academic standard of the College as
also their anxiety to maintain the student
teacher ratio, may be appreciated but at
the same time, we find it difficult to accept
the contention that in order to achieve the
said objects, the students can be compelled
against their desire and wish to continue
study
in
a
particular
college.
Undoubtedly no student has any
vested right to seek migration but the
real question in these cases is not about
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 36 of 84

the vested right of the students, but is
about the legality of the stand of the
College from where migration is sought.
Can No Objection Certificate be refused to
a student when the College to which
admission is sought, is willing to give
admission to that student. The answer
to this question has to be in favour
of the student. Where a student
with a view to improve his career
wants to join another college, which
student feels is better and thinks
that he would be able to make better
mark in another collage to deny
migration to such a student on the
grounds stated by the College from
which migration is sought, would be
unjust and unreasonable. The grant
of permission to migrate may be
discretionary but the discretion is
required to be exercised on sound
legal principles and by adopting just
and reasonable approach. Ordinarily
this court may not interfere in exercise of
discretion in academic matters but where
the career of students is involved and the
approach of college is not just and
reasonable, the court has to come to the
aid of aggrieved students. As already
noticed above, the stand of the
University and the College to which
migration is sought is also that
students cannot be compelled to
study in a particular college. Further
apart from the decision of the Staff
Council, no other provision has been
brought to our notice barring migration.
On the other hand Ordinance-4, as
noticed above, specifically permits
migration. It may also be noticed that
while operating aforesaid Ordinance in
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 37 of 84

practice the student who is to apply for No
Objection Certificate from which he seeks
migration, would do so only when he has
been ensured admission in any other
college and, therefore, the question of
violation of Ordinance-4 not arise.”
Having held so, the Division Bench had directed the
college from which migration was sought to issue the no objection
certificate.
31.

In a judgment reported at 71 (1998) DLT 202 DB in a

case entitled Aman Ichhpuniani vs Vice

Chancellor, Delhi

University & Ors. The Division Bench reiterated the principles
laid down in Sumeet Sawhney's case holding that students have
no absolute unbridled vested right to seek migration.

It was

further stated that the exercise of discretion to permit or refuse
migration has to be exercised on certain principles and that a
mandamus can be issued for compelling of performance of the
duty to exercise discretion on such principles. It would be useful
to set down some of the material observations made by the Bench
in this judgment.
“ 12.
We are conscious of our limitation
on jurisdiction to judicially review a decision
taken in the field of academics.
In
Maharashtra
State
Board
of
Secondary And Highter Secondary
Education & Anr. v. Paritosh Bhupesh
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 38 of 84

Kumarsheth, AIR 1984 SC 1543, their
Lordships have held :
“The Court should be extremely
reluctant to substitute its own views as to what
is wise, prudent and proper in relation to
academic matters in preferences to those
formulated by professional men possessing
technical expertise and rich experience of
actual day-to-day working of educational
Institutions and the departments controlling
them.”
13.
However, that does not amount to
saying that the decisions taken by the
administrative authorities in the field of
academics and education are immune from
judicial review and no writ can issue for
securing performances of statutory duty cast
on such authorities. In S.G. Lekhraj v. N.M.
Shah, AIR 1966 SC 334, their Lordship have
held that a writ of mandamus maybe granted
where there is a statutory duty imposed upon
the officer concerned and there is a failure of
that officer to discharge that statutory
obligation. The chief function of the writ is to
compel the performance of public duties
prescribed by statute and to keep the
Subordinate Tribunals and officers exercising
public functions within the limits of their
jurisdiction.
14.
A writ of mandamus may issue not
only for enforcement of a right but also for
compelling performance of a duty. The very
provision for migration from the College to
another within the University enacted by
Ordinance IV contemplates the existence of a
right to migrate. We will not go on to the
extent of saying that such a right is a vested
unbridled right. Nobody can be permitted to
migrate just for whim and fancy. Good
education is a scarce commodity and good
Institutions displaying pieces of good
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 39 of 84

education on their selling counters are equally
scarce.
The seats are invariably limited
because the number of seats depends on very
many considerations including administrative
and financial. Once a student has been
allowed admission in a particular Institution
in a particular Course of study he occupies
that seat excluding others in waiting from
entering the Course by necessary implication.
If such a student is allowed to leaves the seat
and migrate to another Institution at his sweet
will or merely for whim and fancy, he is
certainly depriving someone else known or
unknown from learning by leaving the seat
vacant.
16.
Nevertheless, the existence of
Ordinance-IV does contemplate migration.
The provision also casts a duty on the
Principal of the College from which migration
is sought to exercise his discretion and take a
decision on prayer for migration guided by
reason keeping in view the relevant
considerations and not merely by whim and
caprice. Like all other discretionary powers
vesting in public authorities, the power to
forward an application seeking migration is
also coupled with a duty. Each prayer shall
have to be dealt with on its own individual
merits. If the prayer for migration be a bald
prayer it may not be allowed merely for
asking. On the contrary if there are valid
reasons assigned providing reasonable
justification for such demand, the Principal on
being satisfied of the availability of just
grounds for migration, is duty bound to
forward the application. Else the exercise of
discretionary power would stand vitiated for
unreasonableness or arbitrariness.
18.
Every student aspires to have the
best education and for that purpose searches
for the best Institution accessible to him and
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 40 of 84

within his means.
Having opted for an
educational Institution and having been
successful in securing admission therein
ordinarily he would not opt out of it unless
there be reasons for doing so. Students in
School and even upto initial years of the
College are invariably advised by their parents
and guardians in choosing Course of study
and the Institution. While asking migration
they will ordinarily have the counsel of their
parents and guardians without which they
would not decide to migrate. In appropriate
cases the Principal would do well to have a
dialogue with the parents or guardians of the
student before taking a decision on the
students' request for migration. Applications
made by the students to their teachers and
Principal are not drafted on legal advise. They
have to be dealt with in an atmosphere full of
affection and harmony. An interview or
dialogue between the Principal and the
student, accompanied by parents or guardian
if need be, would bring out the real reason for
the prayer for migration enabling a just
decision thereon by the Principal.
19.
No Institution can afforded to retain
good students with it by forcing them to do so.
They have to be persuaded and made to feel
convinced. A good student leaving a good
Institution is a contradiction in terms. It is
equally true that a student cannot be allowed
to migrate if Institutional discipline would
suffer in permitting him to do so.
To
illustrate,
student facing disciplinary
proceedings in an educational institution
cannot be allowed to migrate if motivated by
the idea of getting rid of such proceedings.
23.
To sum up, in our opinion :
(i)
to migrate from one
College of the University to another is not a
vested right of student. A student may seek
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 41 of 84

migration from one College to another, if there
be reasons for doing so. Ordnance-IV confers
discretionary power on the Principal of the
College from which migration is sought to
forwarded or not to forward a prayer by a
student seeking migration. The power is
coupled with a duty to act reasonably guided
by relevant consideration not by whim or
caprice. The welfare of the student and the
Institution have both to be kept in view and
weighed - if there be conflict between the two;
(ii)
A student has a right to
choose an educational Institution of his choice
while seeking an admission, but such right
cannot be exercised with the same vigour and
vitality while seeking migration;
(iii)
A request by student
seeking migration for reasons relevant and
germane to such prayer may not be denied
unless the Principal be satisfied of the nonavailability of the grounds or be of the opinion
that the migration will not be in the interest of
the student or the interest of he Institution
outweighs the interest of the student. The
choice of the student has to be respected by
giving due weight; for no sensible student
would ordinarily like to leaves the Institution
which he had chosen to join.”
In such legal position, the Division Bench was pleased to
grant the writ petition made by those petitioners who had
informed the University as to the reason in which they were
seeking migration. The two writ petitions where the petitioners
had not given reasons in their application, were given liberty to
make fresh applications setting out the reasons for migration and

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 42 of 84

the principal of the college was required to dispose of the same
within three days of receipt of the application. The principal was
required to give reasons for the decision in case a different
decision was being taken.
32.

The

issue

of migration

has

recently

fallen for

consideration before Single Judge of this Court in a judgment
which is reported at 99(2002) DLT 546 entitled Jatin Behl Vs.
University of Delhi and others.

Placing reliance on the

pronouncements of the Division Bench and considering the
refusal to give a no objection certificate by the Principal of the
College from where migration was sought, this Court was of the
view that the consent in this case was not being withheld
unreasonably inasmuch as the case was not of extreme hardship
or of any other supervening circumstances. It is also to be noticed
that the College where to migration was being sought was already
having students strength in excess of the sanctioned strength of
the College. It was in these circumstances that the Court held
against the student in this case.
33.

From a consideration of the pronouncements of this

Court some of the reasons which would justify refusal to exercise
discretion in favour of a student and rejection of the application
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 43 of 84

for migration would include, inter alia, the following:(i)An application making a bald prayer based on
the whim or wish of a student without
assigning any valid reasons (para 16 of Aman
Ichhpuniani's case);
(ii)A prayer for migration from an institution of a
student who is facing disciplinary proceedings
in such educational institution cannot be
permitted if motivated by the idea of getting rid
of such proceedings (para 19 of Aman
Ichhpuniani's case).
(iii)Ordinance VII places a disability upon a
student to take examinations if the student is
short
of
the
prescribed
attendance
requirement. In case a student who is short of
attendance and seeks migration for this reason
to avoid the disability incurred by him/her
under Ordinance VII, the institution may be
justified in rejecting such application for the
reasons given in para 19 of Aman Ichhpuniani's
case.
However in case the student could
justify her/his shortage of attendance by relevant
and bona fide reasons & support the same with
material, the application could be favourably
considered.
(iv)Even an application made by a student
making a prayer for migration giving reasons
can be rejected if the authority/principal is
satisfied that the reasons assigned by the
student were sham and a camouflage for the
real intent of the student (para 16 of the Aman
Ichhpuniani's case).
(v)Again an application giving valid and cogent
reasons may also be validly rejected by the
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 44 of 84

College/
Institution
if
the
Authority
considering the request is of the opinion that
the migration will not be in the interest of the
student or in case the interest of the Institution
out weighs the interest of the student(para 23
of the Aman Ichhpuniani's case).
The

instances

set

out

hereinabove

are

merely

illustrative and the list is by no way exhaustive.
34.

So far as the request for migration is concerned, reasons

which have been considered as relevant and germane for
favourable consideration of an application for migration amongst
others include the ground of medical reasons, convenience of
location of the institutions, distance and time spent in commuting
from residence to the place of study; convenience of the shift i.e.
from evening to morning or vice versa on account of grounds of
security and even a request for migration motivated by a desire to
improve career prospects based on the motive of achieving
academic excellence etc. These considerations bear the seal of
judicial scrutiny and approval as noticed above.
35.

The manner of consideration of an application for

migration has been considered in the aforestated pronouncements
and it has been authoritatively held that a student is incapable of
always making a considered and capable decision. Consequently

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 45 of 84

an onerous duty has been cast upon the head of the institution to
interview and have a dialogue with the parents of the student and
the student on receipt of such application. The welfare of the
student have to be given paramount consideration and the choice
of a student with regard to the educational institution where he
seeks to pursue academic course has to be largely respected while
considering the application for migration.

The courts have

required consideration of relevant material while consideration of
the application and required giving of reasons in the event that the
authority arrives at a conclusion that the application deserves to
be rejected. Expedition in undertaking the aforestated exercise
and consideration of the application is inherent in the process and
which has to be dealt with utmost urgency and dispatch. This
answers the first issue raised herein.
36.

In this background, it is necessary to examine he

manner in which the respondents have taken the decision in the
instant case.

It is an admitted position that all the three

petitioners had each given medical grounds as the reason for
which

they

were

seeking

migration

to

the

School

of

Correspondence Courses Studies & Continuing Education and had
placed medical certificates on record.
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 46 of 84

Before me, it is also accepted that if the application had
been made prior to 31st December, 2003, if satisfied with
grounds/reasons for migration (Ref: pronouncement of the DB in
Aman Ichhpuniani case), the respondents had limited discretion
circumscribed by the limits afore-stated to refuse to grant the
application.

In any case the petitioner would have been

permitted to migrate to the college of his/her choice without any
intervention by the Academic Council.

Only

a no objection

certificate was required from the Principal of the college from the
student was seeking to migrate.

The matter has gone to the

Academic Council only for condonation of the delay in making the
application.
37.

From perusal of the original record, I find that the

applications of the three petitioners were all forwarded by their
respective Principals.

The Principal of the colleges where from

the petitioner was seeking to migrate have endorsed that they
have no objection to the migration on the application forms itself.
Thus, so far as the requirement under Ordinance IV is concerned,
the same stood satisfied. It is to be presumed that the respective
Principals were satisfied with the genuineness of the grounds
stated.
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 47 of 84

38.

The applications having been made after the last date

notified by the respondents, the matter was put up before the
Academic Council only for condonation of the delay under
Ordinance X C. The petitioners have contended that the Standing
Committee or the Sub-Committee had required the petitioners to
appear before it and to defend their application for migration. It
was because this committee was satisfied of the genuineness of the
grounds stated and the material placed before it that the Standing
Committee made the recommendations on the applications of the
petitioners seeking migration. The recommendation required the
petitioners only to complete the formalities at the School of
Correspondence Course & Continuing Education.

This

recommendation was forwarded to the Academic Council and
simultaneously the petitioners were granted admission by the
School of Correspondence Courses and Continuing Education.
39.

I also find that there is nothing in the record of the

Standing Committee to the effect that the recommendations or the
admissions granted were provisional. There is no indication on
the note endorsed on the documents placed on record by the
petitioners from any authority of the University or the School of
Correspondence Courses and Continuing Education to the effect
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 48 of 84

that the admission was provisional. The factual position is that
the petitioners joined their courses and were issued the roll
number by the university without any kind of objection
whatsoever. The petitioners and the other candidates also took
the examination conducted by the University. Even the results of
Ayushman Kakoty and Kavita Dhawan were declared.
40.

Based on the grant of admission to the School of

Correspondence Courses and Continuing Education, all the three
petitioners forfeited their admissions in the regular course and
college of study. The petitioner Kavita Dhawan is stated to have
joined her MBA course and has also been granted employment
based on the mark sheet awarded to her in her examination in the
final year at the School of Correspondence Courses and
Continuing Education.
41.

In the meantime and unknown to the students, it

appears that after the meeting and recommendations of the
Standing Committee(students) of the Academic Council on 16th
April, 2004, the following noting was recorded in the University
file on 14th May, 2004.
“If approved, the Minutes may please be
submitted to the Vice-Chancellor for
approval
under
provision
of
the
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 49 of 84

Ordinance X-C of the Ordinances of the
University, so that the matter may be
reported to the Academic Council meeting.
Action on the Minutes has been taken.”
From this noting it is apparent that the respondents
themselves were treating the cases as merely cases of condonation
of delay under Ordnance X(C) of the Ordinances. It was decided
to place the recommendations of the Standing Committee of the
Academic Council before the Council for its consideration in the
noting recorded on 21st May, 2004.
42.

It transpires that, however, when the file was put up

before the Vice Chancellor of the University, the following noting
was recorded by him on the 24th May, 2004
“I agree. The aforesaid cases, relating to
shortage of attendance, recommended by
the Standing Committee are not approved.
Indeed, these cannot be approved as they
are not in conformity with the Ordinances.
The matter be placed before the Academic
Council for its consideration.”
43.

This matter was placed before the Academic Council in

the meeting held on 18th June, 2004 when the following resolution
was passed.
“ ACADEMIC COUNCIL RESOLUTION/S DATED
18TH JUNE, 2004.
Resolution No. 1 to 52

(6 members dissented)”
44.

It is noteworthy that the Vice Chancellor who had

recorded his note on 24th May, 2004 in the aforestated terms was
the Chairperson of this meeting.
45.

Even

after

having

passed

this

resolution

the

respondents took no action whatsoever in the matter. The first
correspondence in this behalf placed before the court is a letter
dated 3rd August, 2004 addressed by the Deputy Registrar of the
Council to the OSD (Examination) of the University of Delhi
enclosing recommendations of the Standing Committee for
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 52 of 84

further action. Thereafter, it appears that ACE conduct of the
University of Delhi has addressed a note to the OSD Examination
on 1st October, 2004 to the following effect :“This is with reference to the A.C. Resolution
dated
18.6.2004
wherein
the
recommendation of the Standing Committee
(students) dated 16.4.2004 were not accepted
by the A.C. About migration/admission of 18
students in the School of Correspondence
Courses and Continuing Education.
In this connection O.S.D.(SCC) is
hereby requested to kindly certify in the first
instance that the admission of the above
students has been cancelled so that the
further action may be taken by the Result
Section in the matter.
Sd/A.C.E.(Conduct)”
Inherent and implicit in this note is the knowledge that
all

the

students

had

been

admitted

to

the

School

of

Correspondence Courses & Continuing Education and that such
admissions had to be cancelled.
46.

By such date, all the three petitioners had duly acted

upon the recommendations of the Standing Committee in their
favour. The University of Delhi and its authorities including the
Standing Committee were aware of the fact that admissions had
been granted, the students were permitted to pursue the course,
take examinations and their results were announced and they
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 53 of 84

were permitted to make further choices and exercise career
options based on the admissions and consequences thereof.
47.

It is settled law that any authority vested with a

statutory power to perform certain statutory duties, functions and
responsibilities and vested with discretion has to act within a
reasonable time. This is more so in matters relating to education.
The Apex Court has repeatedly emphasised upon the requirement
of students abiding by strict academic schedule. For the same
reason,

inasmuch

as

admission

to

courses,

migration,

examination is concerned, the respondents have to abide by the
same discipline.
The respondents would in such matters be limited by
the same limitation as are imposed on students who are required
to act before commencement of next academic session. In the
instant case, the respondents were duly aware that the students
were seeking migration before commencement of University
examination.
48.

This court has already considered the issue relating to

migration in the aforestated two pronouncements by the Division
Bench whereby the court has already held that a student cannot be
compelled to undertake the course of study in a particular college
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 54 of 84

subject to the parameters noticed hereinabove. It has not been
disputed that if the application seeking migration had been made
before the 31st December, 2003, then the Academic Council would
have had no role to play and only the no objection certificates
from the Principals would have sufficed.

The Principal's had

endorsed their 'no objections' to the applications for migration of
the petitioner.
49.

The petitioners' applications were delayed at best by a

period of four to six weeks.
Admittedly the grounds for seeking migration were
medical grounds and medical certificates had also been placed in
support of the applications. There were findings in favour of the
petitioners with regard to these in view of the no objections given
by the Principal of Colleges as well as in the recommendations of
the Standing Committee.
50.

Therefore, the only issue which was required to be

considered by the Academic Council was to the effect as to
whether the students could be permitted to be to migrate after the
last date of allotment to the School of Correspondence Courses
and Continuing Education for the reasons stated in their
applications.
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 55 of 84

51.

So as to test the validity of this reason of rejection of the

applications on the only ground being shortage of attendance, the
same can be examined from yet another angle. Assuming that a
candidate had not undertaken any classes despite having taken
admission to a regular course in the University, could such
student be refused permission to migrate to the School of
Correspondence

Courses

&

Continuing

Education

if

the

application was made before the cut off dated 31st December,
2004?
The answer to such question when put to learned
counsel for the respondents was obviously in the negative.
52.

The noting of the Vice-Chancellor dated 24th May, 2004

has also not found any fault with the genuineness of these reasons
or grounds. There is no finding by either the Vice-Chancellor or
the Academic Council that the grounds stated by the petitioners
were not genuine or that the medical certificates were not correct.
There are no reasons recorded in the meeting dated 18 th June,
2004. the noting dated 24th May, 2004 of the Vice Chancellor
merely records that the cases relate to shortage of attendance and
are not approved.
In my view, this is also totally violative of the
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 56 of 84

pronouncements of the Division Benches of this court which have
been reproduced at length here-in-above. As noticed above, a
student may be short of attendance because of genuine medical
reasons.

In such circumstance, it cannot be successfully

contended that the application for migration or condonation of
delay must not be permitted merely because the attendance of
such student was short in the regular course. The authorities are
concerned only with the genuineness of the given reasons.
53.

The original record produced before me does not reflect

availability of any material with regard to the attendance position
of the petitioners before the Vice-Chancellor when he made the
noting or the Academic Council on 18.6.2004 when it hold the
meeting. On the contrary reliance has been placed on behalf of
the respondents received during the pendency of the case on a
letter dated 17th January, 2005 from the Principal of the college
where the petitioner namely Kavita Dhawan was undergoing her
regular course in support of the contention that she was short of
attendance. Therefore the admitted position is that neither on
24th May, 2004 nor on 18th June, 2004 there was any material
before the Vice Chancellor or the Academic Council to show that
the petitioners were short of attendance or the extent thereof,
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 57 of 84

even if such consideration could be a valid consideration for
rejection of the application.
54.

The Standing Committee had required the candidates to

appear before it prior to making its recommendations and
permitting the migrations.
There was no such variation in the material placed
which had been placed before the Standing Committee and which
was available on the file placed before the Vice Chancellor on the
24th May, 2004 or before the Academic Council on 18th June,
2004.

In such circumstances having regard to the fact that the

Academic Council was considering the matter more than five
months after the applications had been made and long after the
commencement of the next University academic session,

the

students/petitioners could have been at least heard prior to
rejection of the recommendations by the Standing Committee and
reasons been assigned. This would have been in compliance with
the dicta of the aforestated pronouncements.
55.

It cannot possibly be contended that attendance of

classes is not a requisite for part taking the regular course of
study.
However,

assuming

what

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

is

contended

by

page 58 of 84

the

respondents is correct that the medical reason stated by the
petitioners as a ground for migration was a camouflage for the real
position which is stated to be shortage of attendance, it cannot be
denied that the petitioners were being made to pay for the
consequences of their dalliance by the very fact that they were
moving

from

regular

course

of

study

to

courses

by

correspondence. It cannot be disputed that the petitioners were
all migrating from prestigious colleges which are affiliated to the
University of Delhi.
56.

From perusal of the note dated 21st May, 2004 as well as

the resolution dated 18th June, 2004 it is abundantly clear that
there has been no consideration of individual cases and the entire
matter had proceeded on general prejudice against all the
applicants.

The respondents were bound to consider each

application on its individual merit and pass a reasoned order on
the merits/demerits thereof. The respondents had before them
the requirement of stating the reasons of rejection in the judgment
reported at 71 (1998) DLT 202 Aman Ichhpuniani case.
57.

Strong grievances has been made that the decision

against the petitioners was pre-determined and there was no
consideration in law by the Academic Council.
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

The Vice

page 59 of 84

Chancellor had decided the matter and influenced the meeting on
18th June, 2004 as Chairperson.

I may usefully refer to the

pronouncement of the Apex Court in the judgment reported at
1977 (1) SCR 64 entitled G. Sarana vs University of Lucknow &
Ors. To the following effect :“It would be advantageous at this stage
to refer to the following observations made by
this Court in Manak Lal v. Prem Chand.
“Every member of a tribunal that sits to try issues
in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings must be
able to act judicially; and the essences of judicial
decisions and judicial administration is that
judges should be able to act impartially;
objectively and without any bias. In such cases
the test is not whether in fact a bias has affected
the judgment; the test always is and must be
whether a litigant could reasonably apprehend
that a bias attributable to a member of the
tribunal might have operated against him in the
final decision of the tribunal. It is in this sense
that it is often said that justice must not only be
done but must also appear to be done.”
Again as held by this Court in A.K.
Karipak's case (supra), re-iterated in S.
Parthsarthi v. State of Andhra Pradesh and
followed by the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir
in Farooq Ahmed Pandey and Ors. v. Principal
Regional Engineering College & Anr. the real
question is not whether a member of an
administrative Board while exercising quasijudicial powers or discharging quasi-judicial
functions was biased, for it is difficult to prove
the mind of a person. What has to be seen is
whether there is a reasonable ground for
believing that he was likely to have been biased.
In deciding the question of bias, human
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 60 of 84

probabilities and ordinary course of human
conduct have to be taken into consideration. In a
group deliberation and decision like that of a
Selection Board, the members do not function as
computers. Each member of the group or board
is bound to influence the others, more so if the
member concerned is a person with special
knowledge. His bias is likely to operate in a
subtle manner.
From the above discussion, it clearly
follows that what has to be seen in a case where
there is an allegation of bias in respect of a
member of an administrative Board or body is
whether there is a reasonable ground for
believing that he was likely to have been biased.
In other words whether there is substantial
possibility of bias animating the mind of the
member against the aggrieved party.”
58.

At this stage, I may also appropriately notice here the

findings of my esteemed brother (C.K. Mahajan, J) in the
judgment in Civil Writ No. WP (C) No.17174/2004 entitled at
Chandni Mehra vs University of Delhi & Ors. on the implications
of the notings of the Vice Chancellor and the legality of the
resolution dated 18th June, 2004 of the Academic Council to the
following effect:“A perusal of the aforesaid noting shows that the
Vice-Chancellor, who is also the Chairperson of the
Academic Council, had already made up his mind.
The Vice Chancellor had failed to appreciate that
the cases of the petitioner and Kavita Dhawan were
distinct and different from those of 16 other
students who had been detained for shortage of
attendance and had applied for migration whereas
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 61 of 84

the petitioner's case was recommended for
migration as a special case on medical grounds.
Since the entire file was placed before the
Academic Council along with the observations of
the Vice Chancellor obviously the Academic
Council would have been influenced by these
observations which culminated in the rejection of
the petitioner's case also. The opinion expressed
by the Vice Chancellor in his administrative
capacity while referring the petitioner's case to the
Academic Council which was presided over by him
would vitiate the proceedings insofar as the
petitioner is concerned.
The petitioner was never apprised of the
decision of the Academic Council. It is only after
she became aware of the rejection of her request
for migration when she received the impugned
letter dated 15th October, 2004 from the School of
Correspondence informing her that provisional
admission granted to her had been cancelled and
she had been struck off the rolls. Moreover a
perusal of the impugned letter dated 15th October,
2004 shows that it is cryptic and issued
mechanically. If the University had decided to
cancel the admission of the petitioner, the
petitioner ought to have been afforded an
opportunity of hearing before cancelling her
admission to the Correspondence Course. This
was not done in the present case. The decision of
the University to cancel her admission was
conveyed to the petitioner. No other reason was
assigned. Migration of the petitioner was in
consonance with Ordinance-IV. No provision of
the Ordinance IV has been violated.
The Academic Counsel had taken a
decision on 18th June, 2004 and the same was
communicated to the petitioner on 21st October,
2004. The respondents have failed to explain the
delay of about four months in communicating the
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 62 of 84

decision of not admitting the petitioner to the
School of Correspondence. Had the petitioner not
been admitted to the School of Correspondence
Courses, she would have pursued the Course i.e.
B.Com (Pass) II year in the regular College which
commenced from July, 2004. In view of the
silence and inaction on the part of the respondents,
the plea of equitable estoppel is well founded. The
respondents are barred from refusing to grant
admission and declaring the result. One academic
year will inevitably be lost if the University was not
to be permitted to deny the petitioner her right to
admission and declaration of result. This is not a
case where the petitioner has played any fraud or
misrepresented facts or concealed any material
particulars while seeking admission.
I draw
support from a decision of the Division Bench of
this Court reported as Miss Sangeeta
Srivastava Vs. Prof. U.N. Singh & Others
AIR 1980 Delhi 27.
The petitioner was allowed to file the
application form and deposit the requisite fee.
Admission Ticket was also issued to the petitioner
for taking the examination. The petitioner also
took the examination. The petitioner was led to
believe that there was no impediment in her taking
the examination.
She prepared for the
examination and devoted her time, effort and
energies. Cancellation of her admission at such a
late stage when she was expecting her results to my
mind is not fair, just and proper.
In the facts and circumstances of the
case, the career of the petitioner cannot be allowed
to be jeopardised on the basis of a mechanical
action of the Academic Council suffering from nonapplication of mind.
It is also brought to the notice of the
Court that the result of a similarly placed candidate
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 63 of 84

Kavita Dhawan (whose name appeared at Sl. No.17
in the Resolution before the Academic Council) has
been declared and she has already taken
provisional certificate and mark sheet. The result
of another candidate Prem Kochar (whose name
was at Sl. No.2 in the Resolution before the
Academic Council) whose case was also not
accepted by the Academic Council, has been
declared. In these circumstances the action of the
respondents in withholding the results of the
petitioner and cancelling her admission is arbitrary
and discriminatory and is liable to be quashed.”
59.

The court did not have cases of the other 16 students

including the petitioners Radhika Garg and Ayushman Kakoty
before it. The recommendations made by the Standing Council in
their favour and their applications were on a different date, as
noticed herein. The decision in respect of these students was also
based on the same noting of the Vice-Chancellor and all these
cases were also rejected arbitrarily without any material before the
Academic Council and by non application of the independent
mind.
60.

This court has already held in Chandni Mehra's

case(supra) that the decision dated 18th June, 2004 was rendered
illegal as it suffered from the vice of apparent bias in the mind of
the Chair Person of the Academic Council which obviously
influenced the decision.
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 64 of 84

This finding is binding on me. I have also been taken
through the original records and I find myself in complete
agreement with the findings recorded in the judgment in respect
of the Academic Council resolution dated 18th June, 2004 in
respect of the present petitioners also. Having been so held, the
impugned decision dated 18th June, 2004 of the Academic Council
cannot be sustained. The second question is answered thus.
61.

It is noteworthy that in the afore-stated decision in

Chandni Mehra's case the court also noticed that the result of
Kavita Dhawan had been declared and that she had taken the
provisional certificate and the mark sheet. It was also noticed that
the result of another candidate Prem Kochar (whose name was at
serial no. 2 in the resolution before the academic council) whose
case was also not accepted by the academic council, has been
declared. In these circumstances, the court held that action of the
respondents in withholding the results of the petitioner and
cancelling her admission was arbitrary and discriminatory.
62.

I find that while recording the order dated 3rd

December, 2004 in writ petition(civil) 18455/2004, this aspect of
the matter and the findings in the Chandni Mehra's case were not
brought to the notice of the court. In Chandni Mehra's case, the
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 65 of 84

court had clearly held that the opinion expressed by the Vice
Chancellor in his administrative capacity while referring the
petitioner's case to the Academic Council which was presided over
by him would vitiate the proceedings and also that it suffered from
the vice of apparent bias. It was also held that the impugned letter
of cancellation was cryptic and had been issued mechanically. It
was also found that if the University had decided to cancel the
admission of the petitioners, the petitioners and the petitioners
could have been awarded an opportunity of hearing before
cancellation of her admission to the School of Correspondence
Courses and Continuing Education.
It is apparent that neither these findings nor the original
record were placed before the court while considering the decision
rendered on 3rd December, 2004. It was also not brought to the
court's notice that the result of Ayushman Kakoti(petitioner before
me) had also been declared and he has been permitted to continue
with the next year of the course in the School of Correspondence
Courses and Continuing Education.
63.

In the light of all these facts, there can be no and I find

no reason to vary the findings of the court on 5th November, 2004
so far as the noting of the Vice Chancellor dated 24th May, 2004

and the decision dated 18th June, 2004 is concerned.

The

resolution in all the cases (including petitioners) was one. It was
as cryptic, based on no material and identical as in Chandni
Mehra's case. The delay in the communication is similar. These
petitioners have also not been afforded an opportunity before
cancelling of their admissions and no reason has been assigned for
the same. No plea of violation of any provision of law by these
petitioners has been pleaded or established.
64.

I also find that there is no allegation of fraud or mis-

representation or cancellation of any material particulars on the
part of the petitioners. The petitioners were permitted to fill the
application form for admission to the School of Correspondence
Courses and Continuing Education and deposit the requisite fee.
They were permitted to take the University examination without
any impediment.
The issue relating to cancellation of admission at
belated stages after a student had been permitted to undergo the
course and take examinations has been held to be not fair or
equitable. In this behalf the observations of the Apex Court in the
case of Sanatan Gauda(supra) to the following effect are
noteworthy :W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 67 of 84

“15.
This is apart from the fact that I find
that in the present case the appellant while
securing his admission in the Law College had
admittedly
submitted
his
marks-sheet
alongwith the application for admission. The
Law College had admitted him. He had
pursued his studies for two years.
The
University had also granted him the admission
card for the Pre-Law and Intermediate Law
examinations. He was permitted to appear in
the said examinations. He was also admitted
to the final year of the course. It is only at the
stage of the declaration of his results of the
Pre-Law and Inter-Law examinations that the
University raised the objection to his so-called
ineligibility to be admitted to the Law Course.
The University is, therefore, clearly estopped
from refusing to declare the results of the
appellant's examination or from preventing
him from pursuing his final year course.
16.
For all these reasons, I am
of the view that the University is not justified
in refusing to declare the appellant's results of
the
Pre-Law
and
Intermediate
Law
examinations. The appeal, therefore, succeeds.
The respondent-University is directed to
declare the said results as well as the result of
the final examination if the appellant has
appeared for the same. The appeal is allowed
accordingly. In the circumstances of the case,
there will be no order as to costs.”
65.

I may also advert to the observations by this court in the

judgment reported at 43 (1991) DLT 670 entitled Kanishka
Aggarwal vs University of Delhi which reads as under :“33.
What do we find in this case? It is
the Professor-in-charge who may make
provisional admissions. It is he, who, as the
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 68 of 84

so-called Convener, may admit provisionally
even those who do not find their names in any
of the Lists. There was no Waiting List and as
many as 72 vacancies were crying to be filled
up on the very last date of admissions. The
petitioner was there. So were the like of him.
They were all waiting in the wings with money
in their wallets to pay admission fees. They
were invited. They paid the fees. (It was
argued by Mr. Rao that the petitioner must
have named the person who had invited him to
pay the fees. We regard it immaterial. There
was some Barkes some-where who was willing
a la David Copperfield. And, then how could
fees be deposited without the other side willing
to accept? Have we not heard and heard again
that line from the Goblin Market : “One may
lead a horse to water, twenty cannot make him
drink?”) They were issued regular receipts for
the same. Let us not forget that as per Clause
IX of the Bulletin fees is to be paid only by an
“applicant selected for admission”. Let us also
not forget that before the payment of fees, the
applicants admitted provisionally have to
produce all the requisite certificates in original
and their confirmation is to be made by none
other than the Professor-in-charge himself,
and as per the applicant, he had actually
produced those certificates. (See Clause VII (c)
) As per Clause IX (3). The applicant also
furnished two copies of his latest passport size
photograph, the same being essential to “effect
his/her admission by payment of fees”. He
was allotted a roll number. He was issued
even the requisite identity card. He was also
assigned to one of the seven sections. He even
started attending the lectures. And later, in all
the communications of he University he was
shown to have been provisionally admitted.
Does all this not constitute a representation?
What is all this if not the requisite 'conduct'?
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 69 of 84

Was the applicant not justified, under the
circumstances, to raise the assumption ?(See :
Sanatan Gaurda v. Brahampur University, JT
1990 (2) SC 57).
36.
We hold that the plea of estoppel is
available and applicable.
37.
Let us assume, the plea of estoppel is
not available. Still, should the applicant be
allowed to be thrown out? Should we deprive
him of the rainbow of today and make his
tomorrows bleak, barren and ominous?
Whom shall we be serving thereby? An inefficient, if not corrupt, system which has been
spreading its fangs year after year? The Rip
Van Winkles who refused to come out of their
deep slumber even in the face of the
reverberations caused by loud protests of foul
play and demand for a CBI enquiry? Those
who found it well high impossible to even
transfer certain clerical staff inspite of pressing
demand by the teaching community? Should
we serve them or this innocent student who
bought a dream with his time and money? He
played no fraud. His only fault was his
assumption that vistas or knowledge were
being opened to him. Must he suffer for this
innocence? Where lies his fault? How much
do we wish, somebody had whispered to the
University : un pey de charite, voyons'.
38.
Yes, Wells is right (Situated Decision
making 63 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1727 (1990)) in
pointing out that judges remain impartial
spectators while hearing the witnesses and
going through reports, but at the end of the
trial they become agents by interacting not
only with those who are involved in the case,
but with unknown others also whose cases will
be decided in accordance with this case and
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 70 of 84

ultimately they become “situationalists” or
“formalists” inspite of their having been
trained in the same legal system. John Dewey
(Logical Method and Law, in 15th Middle
Works 1889-1924, 68 (1983)) quotes Justice
Holmes as saying :
“The whole outline of the law is the resultant of
a conflict at every point between logic and
good sense-the one striving to work fiction out
to consistent results, the other restraining and
at last overcoming the effort when the results
become too manifestly unjust”.
Though Dewey points out that
Holmes uses “logic” in a narrow “sylogistic”
sense, and himself advocates “experimental
logic”(P 69), let us say, the formalist judge
represents logic, while the situationalist judge
represents good sense. With respect, it is the
situationalist judges we find working in
Rajendra Prasad Mathur v. Karnataka
University 1986 Supp. SCC 740 ; Thaper
Institute of
Engineering and Technology
Patiala v. Abhinav Taneja and others, JT 1990
(3) SC 72 and Ashok Chand Singhvi v. Jodhpur
University, AIR 1989 SC 823. For, in all these
cases, the Supreme Court protected the
interests of the students though found having
been initially ineligible for admission. Who
would not love to be in such august company?”
66.

All the aforestated observations squarely apply to the

action of the University of Delhi authorities in the instant case as
well.
67.

I may also notice that while recording the noting dated

24th May, 2004 and in addressing the impugned decision, the

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 71 of 84

respondents have completely ignored the impact and consequence
of the same on the students involved. The petitioners all forfeited
admissions in the regular courses. The petitioner Kavita Dhawan
was in the final year and made arrangements to pursue further
studies and to pursue an MBA course and also was successful in
securing employment based on the result announced by the
respondents.

The petitioner Ayushman Kakoty, based on the

result is pursuing the next year of the course. The respondents
made no provision as to the fate of these students in case their
decision was implemented. The question arises as to whether
there could be any restitution and whether these petitioners could
be reverted to the position subsisting on the date they made the
applications. The answer is clearly in the negative. Each of these
candidates would lose a complete academic year. One of the
petitioners Kavita Dhawan would lose her admission in a
professional course and employment also.
68.

It would be appropriate to notice here the observations

of this court in the judgment reported at 2002(III) AD (Delhi) 81
entitled Liya Belliappa vs CBSE & Anr. to the following effect :“13.
Learned counsel for respondent
no. 1 has relied upon a Supreme Court
judgment in Civil Appeal No. 2662 of 1998
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 72 of 84

CBSE & Anr. Vs. P. Sunil Kumar and
Ors. in which the Apex Court has
deprecated the practice of allowing the
students to appear in the examinations of
the Board or the Universities and then
ultimately regularising the same by taking
sympathetic view in the matter. It is also
observed that the Courts by their fiat cannot
direct the Universities to disputes to which
they owe their existences. Learned counsel
also relies upon the orders passed by the
Apex Court in SLP- 18853/97 Central
Board of Secondary Education vs
Nikhil Gulati and Anr. On 13.2.1998 in
which once again the practice of permitting
ineligible students to undertake Board or
University examinations was disapproved.
However it was also added that unless the
High Court can justify its decision on
principle and precept it should better desist
from passing such orders as it puts the rule
of law to mockery. It is true that the Courts
must not countenance in-fraction of rules
nor should interfere with the rules,
guidelines and policies made by the experts
in academic matters but in a case like the
present one where a student is shown to be
put in an extremely disadvantageous
position without any fault on his part the
Court has the duty to intervene and set the
equities right to ensure that the student is
not made to suffer without any fault on his
part.”
Undoubtedly the admissions of the petitioners cannot
be disturbed in such manner and at such stage and the impugned
decisions deserve to be quashed to balance equities.
69.

This is a direct consequence of the action of the

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 73 of 84

respondents in not promptly disposing of the applications which
were made in the beginning of February, 2004 and delaying
consideration by the academic council till June, 2004 long after
the academic session was over.
70.

The delay in communication of the decision taken, i.e.,

till 18th December, 2004 to Radhika Garg, November 2004 to
Kavita Dhawan and till 10th November, 2004 to Ayushman Kakoti
also militates against the permissibility of the action of the
respondents. The respondents intimated the decision taken by
them well into the next academic year.
71.

In this regard, I may appropriately refer to the

observations by this court in the judgment of Arijit Bansal which
are to the following effect :“14. xxx

xxx

xxx

In short, the wrong declaration in the application
form did not affect petitioner's merit position, in
the selection process. At the risk of repetition in
this case, the petitioner had secured 78.6% marks
in xiith class examination. He was eligible and
undertook Entrance Test in the year 2000 but could
not make up to the merit list. He again appeared in
the Entrance Test in the year 2001 and made upto
the merit list. He has already completed about two
years study in the MBBS course and has already
passed the professional course in all the subjects.
Even if petitioner's admission is cancelled, the seal
in the second year cannot be occupied by any other
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 74 of 84

candidate, therefore, no useful purpose can be
served by cancelling the admission at this stage.
Ordinance X-C of the University of Delhi Calender
permits the Academic Council in suitable cases, to
grant exemption from the operation of any of the
Ordinances governing admission of the students.
The cancellation of petitioner's admission, at this
juncture would destroy his entire professional
career without benefiting anybody else.
The
Medical Courses Admission Committee comprising
of
eminent
educationists,
after
detailed
examination of the material available on record,
decided to allow the petitioner to continue the
courses, with the warning that in case of any other
misconduct committed by the petitioner, his
admission to the course would be cancelled. This
decision of the Medical Courses Admission
Committee, could not be set aside by a cryptic non
speaking resolution by the Academic council. xxx

17.
There is nothing in the Academic Council
Resolution to show what material was circulated to
the members of the AC, when the above resolution
was passed. Respondents were again directed to
produce the documents, which were circulated to
the AC members or in the alternative to file
affidavit.
On 9.6.2003 respondents filed an
affidavit which only shows that except the decision
of the Medical Courses Admission Committee dated
24.10.2002, nothing else was circulated to the
members of the Academic Council alongwith the
agenda. On being asked, learned counsel for the
respondents very fairly conceded that no other
document was circulated to members of the
Academic Council. It is really surprising that the
documents like memorandum, show cause notice,
replies, representations of the petitioner and other
connected documents were not even circulated to
the members of the Academic Council alongwith
the agenda. In the absence of these documents,
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 75 of 84

how could the members of the Academic Council
overrule the well-considered decision of the
Medical Courses Committee, which comprised of
two members of the Academic Council, Principal,
UCMS, Vice-Principal, LHMC and the Dean,
Faculty of Medical Sciences. For this reason alone,
the resolution of the Academic Council, cancelling
petitioner's admission, is liable to be set aside for
non-application of mind and being violative of
principles of natural justice.

Delhi University was created by an Act of
Parliament under the Constitution.
It is
substantially financed by the funds provided
directly or indirectly by the Government. The AC is
an authority created under the Delhi University Act,
therefore, in my view, AC is a public authority
within the meaning of Section 2(g) of the Act.
Section 4(d) of the Act imposes obligation on a
public authority to give reasons for its decisions,
whether administrative or quasi judicial. This duty
helps compliance with the principles of natural
justice. Thus, the AC, being a public authority, was
bound to give reasons, for its resolutions,
particularly while setting aside the admission of a
student whose career is going to be decided by such
a decision. The resolution of AC, being nonspeaking, is liable to be quashed on this ground as
well.”
In my considered view, in the facts of the instant case,
the resolution dated 18th June, 2004 and the admissions of the
petitioners could not have been cancelled without notice to show
cause, opportunity of hearing and without a reasoned and
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 76 of 84

considered decision. The third question is answered thus.
72.

According to Ms. Acharya, as the applications were

beyond the last date for migration, therefore, they had to be
treated as if they were applications seeking fresh admissions and
Ordinance IV would have no relevance in the instant case.

The respondents have recorded notings that the matter
related to Ordinance XC as noticed above.
The respondents were themselves treating these
applications as applications for condonation of delay under
Ordinance XC and cannot be permitted to contend that the same
were applications for fresh admission.
73.

In this case the recommendations of the standing

committee were permitted to be given effect to and migration was
permitted which was well within the knowledge of the University
of Delhi.

It has been contended that the admissions were

provisional and that only the academic council was competent to
permit migration of the student. In this view of the matter the
university would be advised to consider the permissibility of
admissions based only on the recommendations of the standing
committee.

This would deserve to be balanced against the

W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 77 of 84

administrative hitch expressed on behalf of the respondent that it
is not possible to convene a meeting to the academic council
expeditiously. If this be so, the university ought not to be
permitted to brush away recommendations of the standing
committee which have been given effect to by it without
compliance of the principles laid down in the authoritative judicial
pronouncements noticed here-in-above.
The decision taken by the Academic Council and the
order communicated to the petitioners reflect no reasons at all.
There is no material on the record other than the noting by the
Vice-Chancellor dated 24th May, 2004. The respondents cannot be
permitted to read any

reason as the basis of the decision taken

other than the reason disclosed in the order. The order/decision
has to be tested only on the basis of material on record. I am
supported in this view by the pronoucement of the Apex Court in
Commissioner of Police Vs. Gordhan Dass Bhanji (supra).
74.

I may also advert to the submission made on behalf of

the respondents that the petitioners are bound by the provisions
of the statute which provides that the delay in the application
could be condoned by the Academic Council alone and hence the
petitioners were aware that their admissions were provisional.
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 78 of 84

This is vehemently disputed by the petitioners who have stated
that they have learnt for the first time that their admission was
provisional only on the receipt of the letter dated 18th November,
2004.
I am unable to agree with the learned counsel for the
respondent.

In the facts noticed here-in-above even if the

admission was initially provisional on account of the supervening
circumstances the petitioners had every reason to believe that the
admissions had been accepted and confirmed by the respondents
inasmuch as they were issued admission tickets for the
examinations and had taken their respective examinations
without any objection from the respondents and the results of two
of the petitioners namely Ayushman and Kavita Dhawan had been
declared.
I may notice the principles laid down by the Apex Court
in (1996) 5 SCC 468 while considering the representation made by
the authority on the grounds of promissory estoppel:“It is well settled that the doctrine of
promissory estoppel represents a
principle evolved by equity to avoid
injustice and, though commonly named
promissory estoppel, it is neither in the
realm of contract nor in the realm of
estoppel. The basis of this doctrine is
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 79 of 84

the inter-position of equity which has
always proved to its form, stepped in to
mitigate the rigour of strict law. It is
equally true that the doctrine of
promissory estoppel is not limited in its
application only to defence but it can
also find a cause of action. This doctrine
is applicable against the Government in
the exercise of its governmental public
or executive functions and the doctrine
of executive necessity or freedom of
future executive action, cannot be
invoked to defeat the applicability of
this doctrine.
It is further well
established that the doctrine of
promissory estoppel must yield when
the equity so requires. If it can be
shown by the Government or public
authority that having regard to the facts
as they have transpired, it would be
unequitable to hold the Government or
public authority to the promise or
representation made by it, the court
would not raise an equity in favour of
the person to whom the promise or
representation is made and enforce the
promise or representation against the
Government or public authority. The
doctrine of promissory estoppel would
be displaced in such a case because on
the facts, equity would not require that
the Government or public authority
should be held bound by the promise or
representation made by it (vide Godfrey
Philips case)”
In the instant case also the respondents could be bound
by their conduct and on grounds of the equitable principles of
promissory estoppel to the effect that the admissions made to the
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 80 of 84

petitioners were valid and binding.
75.

It is apparent that the issues raised in the present

petition and the validity of the action of the respondents will arise
repeatedly so long as the provisions for migration exists and
students would continue to make applications. In addition to the
directions of the Division Bench of this court in Aman
Ichhpuniani's case that an application stating relevant reasons for
seeking migration would deserve to be favourably considered
unless the reason was found to be false, however, bald
applications for migration on the sole ground of a student
“wishing to migrate” may not invite exercise of the discretion
favourably in favour of the candidates. However it is imperative
that the respondents follow a definite procedure while considering
the

applications

for

migration.

From

the

aforestated

pronouncements of this Court and consideration of the issues
raised in the present writ petition, the following principles can be
laid down:(i)Consideration of an application for migration involves a
consultative process between the head of the institution or the
recommending body with the student and the respective
parents/guardians.
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 81 of 84

(ii)Consideration and decision making on the application have to
follow a time bound frame. The entire process has necessarily
to be completed expeditiously giving time to the student to
prepare for the exams at the end of the academic session for
which the application has been made. Under no circumstance
can the decision making be protracted into the next academic
session.
(iii)The consideration of the application entail application of mind
to the reasons set out, materials placed in support thereof,
welfare of the student and balancing of what may sometimes be
conflicting interests of the students vis-a-vis the institution.
(iv)Rejection of an application must be by a reasoned order.
(v)Communication of the decision taken on an application for
migration has to be made immediately upon the decision having
been taken.
(vi)The decision taken must be communicated immediately to the
concerned student,

the institution wherefrom migration is

sought as well as the institution to which migration is sought.
(vii)In the event of admissions having been granted to the
institution to which migration is sought in circumstances as the
present case and the next academic session having commenced,
W.P.(C)20013/2004, 1467/2005 & 652/2005

page 82 of 84

no cancellation of admission ought to be permitted without
service of notice to show cause and opportunity of hearing by
the competent authority.
