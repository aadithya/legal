The case of the Petitioner is that his services have

been wrongly terminated. Learned counsel for the Petitioner
submits that since the appointment letter of the Petitioner has
been signed by the DIGP (CRPF), the dismissal order issued by
the Commandant 153 Bn CRPF, dated 2nd January, 2004 violates
Article 311 of the Constitution of India. Learned counsel for the
Respondent submits that the appointing authority is actually the
Commandant and therefore, no infraction is made out.
argument of the Respondent is accepted.

This

The discussion

contained in Kanta Devi Vs. Union of India, (2003) 4 SCC
753 is topical, as it has been held that just because the prior
approval of the IG is required it does not alter the position that
the Commandant is actually the appointing authority.

We are

so mindful of the position that in the case in hand the
appointment appears to have been signed by an officer senior to
the Commandant.

The relevant submissions made in the Counter

Affidavit reads as follows:“2(iv) In reply to the contents of para 2(iv) of
the writ petition it is submitted that the
Petitioner had reported in the 153 Battalion
CRPF on 9.3.2003 for basic training. His basic
training along with other recruits commenced

Keeping in view his

abnormal behaviour and indulging in such
unwanted activities he was again referred to
Base Hospital-I of the Respondent at New
Delhi where he was admitted on 15.11.2003.
Despite better treatment and investigation,
he continued to have headache off and on,

“depression

Delhi opined that the Petitioner cannot

Respondent Force. Therefore, the services
of the Petitioner were terminated w.e.f.

5.

The Petitioner was admittedly a temporary servant.

Since the asseverations in the Counter Affidavit have been
deliberately not replied to, it must be presumed that the
statements made therein are correct. In these circumstances,
we find no irregularity or illegality in the impugned Order.

Dismissed.
