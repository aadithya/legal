FAO Nos.209/1994, 232/1994

Page No.1 of 10

1.

The 2 captioned appeals arise out of the same accident

which took place on 3.3.1979. The insurance company prays
that its liability should be held to be limited to the extent of
Rs.50,000/-. Claimants pray that compensation be enhanced.
2.

As a result of the accident, Prakaram Chand aged 34

years received fatal injuries. He died. He left behind a wife, 4
minor children and mother.

His mother died during the

pendency of the claim petition.
3.

After discussing the evidence on record pertaining to the

accident and holding the driver of the offending vehicle guilty
of

rash

and

negligent

driving,

Tribunal

awarded

a

compensation of Rs.1,72,800/- to the claimants. The owner,
driver and the insurance company have been held liable to pay
under the award.
4.

Vide

FAO

No.209/1994,

insurance

company

has

challenged the award in so far it determines that insurance
company is liable to satisfy the award.
5.

A defence was raised by the insurance company that

policy in question was an 'Act Only Policy' and in view of the
statutory provision contained in clause 'b' of Sub-Section 2 of
Section 95 of M.V.Act, 1939, it's liability is limited to the extent

FAO Nos.209/1994, 232/1994

Page No.2 of 10

of Rs.50,000/- only.
6.

Learned Tribunal has not discussed the issue of limited

liability of insurance company in the award.

However,

considering that insurance company admitted that offending
vehicle was insured with it, learned Tribunal has directed the
insurance company to satisfy the award.
7.

To establish that policy in question was an 'Act Only

Policy', an insurance policy purported to be the true copy of the
original policy was filed on record. The same is at Page No.209
of the record of the Tribunal.
8.

No official from the insurance company was summoned to

prove that said policy was a true copy of the original policy.
The alleged true copy does not bear the signature of the
person under whose authority same has been issued.
9.

The alleged true copy of the original policy has thus

remained an unproved document.
10.

There is no presumption in law that policy of insurance

issued by an insurance company is 'act only policy'.

For if,

insurance company takes additional premium, it can cover
additional risk. A contract of insurance is between insurance
company and assured. Where policy covers a third party risk,

FAO Nos.209/1994, 232/1994

Page No.3 of 10

third party is beneficiary of the risk. Thus, obligation is that of
insurance company to prove terms of its liability.

Where

insurance company alleges that its liability is limited, onus is on
the insurance company to prove it.
11.

To the similar effect are the observations of the Kerala

High Court in the decision reported as Ouseph Vs. Antony 1990
ACJ 57. In the said case, it was observed as follows:'The insurance company has not chosen to
produce the policy or to adduce any evidence to
show that their liability is limited to the statutory
liability. As insurance company has not
discharged the burden by either producing the
policy or adducing any other evidence to that
effect, the insurance company is liable to pay the
entire amount due under the award.'
12.

Since the insurance company has failed to prove that its

liability was limited to the extent of statutory liability, I direct
insurance company to satisfy the award. FAO No.209/1994 is
accordingly dismissed.
13.

In FAO No.232/1994, appellants who were the claimants

before the Tribunal seek enhancement of the compensation
awarded to them due to the death of the deceased in the said
road accident.
14.

Vide award dated 14.7.1994, total compensation granted

to the appellants is Rs.1,72,800/-.
FAO Nos.209/1994, 232/1994

Page No.4 of 10

15.

Since the only issue involved in this appeal relates to

quantum of compensation, I shall only note such facts as are
relevant for adjudication of said issue.
16.

Deceased was aged 34 years as on the date of the

accident.
17.

He left behind his wife, 4 minor children aged 13 years,

11 years, 10 years, and 4 ½ years respectively and his mother.
18.

Deceased was employed as a tailor and was earning

Rs.1200/- per month at the time of the accident.
19.

Noting the testimony of the wife of the deceased and

other surrounding evidence, learned Tribunal has determined
the earnings of the deceased at the time of the accident as
Rs.1200/- per month.
20.

Relying upon the decision reported as Radha Kishan

Sachdeva & Ors. Vs.L.D.Sharma & Anr. 1994 ACJ 109, learned
Tribunal has taken last income of the deceased, i.e. Rs.1200/per month as the loss of dependence. Noting that deceased
was aged 34 years at the time of the accident, multiplier of 12
has been applied by the Tribunal.

Thus, total compensation

has been determined by the Tribunal at Rs.1200 x 12 x 12 =
Rs.1,72,800/-.

FAO Nos.209/1994, 232/1994

Page No.5 of 10

21.

After perusing the award, I find that the compensation

assessed to the appellants is faulty on 1 count.
22.

In my view, Tribunal erred in ignoring the prospects of

future increase in the income of the deceased. Tribunal failed
to take note of the fact that wages increase from time to time
to equalize fall in purchasing power of the rupee. Considering
that the deceased was aged 34 years at the time of the
accident, it could be expected that he would have worked for
another 26 years.
23.

A perusal of the minimum wages notified under the

Minimum Wages Act show that minimum wages increase by
nearly 150% in 10 years. Take for instance, minimum wages
for skilled workman as on 1.1.1980 were Rs.320/- per month.
Same rose to Rs.1,043/- in the year 1990 and further rose to
Rs.2,843/- in the year 2000. Meaning thereby that there has
been an increase of 225% from the year 1980-1990 and an
increase of 172% from the year 1990-2000.
24.

Noting that minimum wages virtually double after every

10 years to neutralise increase in inflation, cost of living,
purchasing power of rupee and the fact that deceased would
have worked for another 26 years, it could reasonably be

FAO Nos.209/1994, 232/1994

Page No.6 of 10

assumed that his earnings would have at least tripled by the
time he would have left gainful employment.

Thus, mean

average income of the deceased comes to Rs.2400/- per
month. (Rs.1200 + Rs.3600 ( 3 times increase in income)÷ by
2 = Rs.2400/-.
25.

I note that the deceased was maintaining besides himself,

a wife, 4 minor children, aged between 4 ½ years and 13 years
and his mother. Noting the principle that lesser is the income,
lesser is the presumed expenses on self and the second
principle larger is the family, lesser is the presumed expenses
on self, I consider deduction of 1/5th for the personal spending
of the deceased as appropriate.

Thus, loss of dependence

comes to Rs.1920/- per month.
26.

Tribunal has rightly applied multiplier of 12. In so holding,

I note the undermentioned judgments :(i)

U.P.State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Krishna Bala
& Ors., (2006) 6 SCC 249

(ii)

Managing Director, TNSTC Ltd. Vs. K.I.Bindu, (2005) 8
SCC 473.

(iii)

T.N.State Transport Corporation Ltd. Vs. S.Rajapriya,
(2005) 6 SCC236.

& Ors., 2007 (2) Scale 227

FAO Nos.209/1994, 232/1994

Page No.7 of 10

27.

Applying multiplier of 12, total loss of dependence comes

to Rs.1920 x 12 x 12 = Rs.2,76,480/-.
28.

Tribunal has awarded no compensation under the head

'non-pecuniary

damages'.

Considering

that

accident in

question relates to the year 1979, I award compensation in
sum of Rs.10,000/- under the said head.

Thus, total

compensation comes to Rs.2,86,480/-.
29.

Tribunal

Rs.1,72,800/-.

has

awarded

compensation

in

sum

of

Therefore, compensation is enhanced by a

further sum of Rs.1,13,680/-.
30.

Noting that the interest rates fluctuated between 13%

p.a. to 5.5% p.a. between the years 1979 and 2007, I direct
that enhanced compensation shall be together with interest @
8% p.a. from date of claim petition till date of realisation.
31.

Enhanced compensation shall be disbursed as follows :-

(a)

Appellant No.1 (widow)

Rs.93,680/-

(b)

Appellant No.2,3, 4 and 5
(children)

Rs.5000/- (each)

32.

FAO No.232/1994 is allowed in terms of para 29, 30 and

31 above.
33.

FAO No.209/1994 is dismissed.

34.

No costs.
