ORDER:
E.A.No.347/2005

1.

By this application under Section 47 of CPC, applicant has

raised objections against the attachment of property/flat no.31-A. Ground
Floor, Block A-1-A Janakpuri, New Delhi.

The applicant, Kunta Devi has

claimed herself to be owner of the property.
2.

Brief

facts

relevant

for

the

purpose

of

deciding

the

application are that in suit no. 93/94 a decree was passed against Sh.
Inder Bhushan Kohli, Smt. Uma Kohli and Sh. Pulkit Kohli on 16.12.2003
and in execution of the decree the property in question was sought to be
attached.

A notice of attachment was issued by this Court, whereafter

objections have been filed by the applicant. It is stated by the applicant
that this property was alloted to Inder Bhushan Kohli vide allotment dated
31.5.1984 and Inder Bhushan Kohli sold the flat for valid consideration to
one Sh. C.L. Kapoor son of Sh. Dhyan Chand Kapoor on 4th October, 1993
for a sum of Rs.1,90,000/-. Mr. C.L. Kapoor sold the flat to the applicant
on 13.10.1995 for consideration of Rs.2,25,000/- and executed various
documents like agreement to sell, power of attorney, possession letter,

etc., etc. The applicant is a bonafide purchaser of the property and had
been enjoying the property without any interference from any party since
October, 1995. She had been in possession of the property since 1995
and the property does not belong to judgment debtor therefore this
cannot be attached or sold in execution. Along with this application, there
is an affidavit of the objector testifying to the facts. The application is also
accompanied by copies of documents viz.: i) possession letter issued in
favour of Inder Bhushan Kohli on 2.6.1984, ii) payment receipt showing
payment of amount by Inder Bhushan Kohli on 18.5.84, iii) an agreement
to sell by Inder Bhushan Kohli in favour of C.L. Kapoor executed on 4 th
October, 1993, iv) a receipt of payment of Rs.1,19,000/- by C.L. Kapoor to
Inder Bhushan Kohli of the same date, v) Another agreement to sell
executed on 13th October, 1995 by C.L. Kapoor in favour of applicant,
Kunta Devi, vi) a receipt of payment of Rs.2,25,000/- by Kunta Devi to C.L.
Kapoor, vii) Ration card of the applicant at the same address issued on
23rd March, 1998 and viii) election card issued on 6th April, 2002.
3.

In reply to the application, it is stated by the decree holder

that though the applicant was not a party to the suit, the property in
question is not owned by the applicant and is owned by the judgment
debtor. The judgment debtor was employed with the decree holder/bank
and had taken housing loan for allotment of the house.

A sum of

Rs.1,12,865/- was paid by the decree holder directly to DDA on behalf of
judgment debtor no. 1 and it was specifically told to DDA that decree
holder had financed the flat. DDA was requested to send the perpetual
lease deed to the bank for creation of equitable mortgage. Thus decree
holder/bank has first charge over the property.

DDA, however, did not

execute any conveyance deed in favour of judgment debtor no. 1 and no
conveyance deed was sent to decree holder/bank.

The flat still stands

alloted in the name of judgment debtor no. 1 in records of DDA. It is
submitted that flat could not have been sold without the permission of
DDA and any transaction of sale between judgment debtor no. 1 and Mr.

E.A.No.347/2005 in Ex.P.No.95/2004

Kapoor or between Mr. Kapoor and applicant was null and void.

The

judgment debtor while working with the decree holder/bank had
committed various frauds, criminal offences and misappropriated huge
amounts of the decree holder/bank. So decree holder/bank dismissed him
from the service. Judgment debtor, out of money earned by him through
fraud, had purchased various immovable properties and this Court vide
order dated 12.1.1994 had restrained judgment debtor from disposing of
his properties including the property in question. The Judgment debtor
had also applied for conversion of leaseholds rights to freehold rights and
got papers issued from DDA on 18.8.1997 for stamping from Collector of
Stamps but the same had been returned to the judgment debtor.

It is

stated that judgment debtor had been dealing with the DDA as an owner
and judgment debtor cannot take the stand that he was not the owner
and neither the applicant can take the stand that she was the owner. The
applicant can not become the owner of the property on the basis of the
documents like agreement to sell, GPA, possession letter and receipt.
4.

I have heard counsel for the parties. It is admitted case of

decree holder that an injunction was granted against the sale of the
property in question in 1994.

However from documents, it is apparent

that judgment debtor had parted with possession of this property in 1993
itself by entering into an

agreement to sell, payment receipt showing

payment of amount, etc. Mr.C.L. Kapoor to whom possession was
transferred by judgment debtor was not a party to the suit and was not
aware of the injunction at the time when he further sold the property to
applicant.

It seems that the present applicant purchased the property

without being aware of the judgment debtor's involvement in the fraud
with the bank or that the property was the subject matter of an
application under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC. The fact that applicant has
been residing in the property has not been denied. The documents placed
by the applicant show that the applicant has been living in the property as
an owner.

5.

Considering the judgment passed by this Court in 2002 (II)

AD (Delhi) 734 Asha M. Jain vs. The Canara Bank & Ors., I consider
that this Court has to uphold the objections raised by the applicant and
the property being occupied by the applicant as an owner though based
on unregistered documents, cannot be sold in execution of the decree.
6.

It is a peculiar case where judgment debtor had been working

with the bank and had played fraud with the bank. He created immovable
properties namely Shop No. 20, 1st Floor, Community Shopping Centre
No.6, Pocket-B, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, LIG Flat No. A2/1A/228, Janak Puri,
New Delhi, Flat No.B-723, Anand Dham, Haridwar(U.P) and the flat in
question. Apart from the fact that he had about 100 shares in Colgate
Palmolive India and a cash amount of Rs.1,07,992/- was recovered in a
house search of judgment debtor by police in a criminal case. Looking
into the facts, I consider that the judgment debtor has been successfully
thwarting efforts of execution of the decree. It is a fit case where a notice
should be sent to the judgment debtor under Order 21 Rule 37 CPC to
show cause as to why he should not be sent to the civil imprisonment for
execution of the decree.
7.

Notice be sent to judgment debtor, returnable for 28th March,

2008.
8.

The

decree

holder,

in

the

meantime,

shall

deposit

subsistence allowance for judgment debtor's civil imprisonment for a
period of 2 weeks.
