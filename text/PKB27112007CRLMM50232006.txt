JUDGMENT
P.K.BHASIN, J:
The present petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 seeking quashing of FIR no. 558/2002 for the offences punishable under
Sections 406/420/120-B of Indian Penal Code (‘IPC’ in brief) registered on
29.12.2002 at Police Station Ambedkar Nagar and also the resultant criminal
proceedings emanating there from pending in the Court of Ms. Geetanjali Goel,
Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi.
2.

It is the case of the prosecution that under the “PRIME MINISTER ROJGAR

YOJANA” launched by the Central Government in the year 1995 the objective of
which was to provide financial assistance for self employment after being
recommended by the Commissioner of Industries, Government of National Capital
Territory of Delhi was sanctioned a loan of Rs. 70,000/- on 12.08.1995 vide
account no. TL-204/1995 by respondent no. 4, Punjab National Bank. In order to
get the sanctioned loan, the petitioner hypothecated some goods but failed to
make payment of instalments and interest accruing thereon and when respondent
no. 4’s employees visited the premises of the petitioner it transpired that the
hypothecated goods had already been sold without permission of respondent no. 4bank in violation of terms and conditions of the loan agreement. Respondent no. 4
then got registered a criminal case at police station Ambedkar Nagar on
29.12.2002 for the offences punishable under Sections 406/420/120B I.P.C.
pursuant to which the matter was investigated by the police and after completion
of the investigation charge sheet was filed in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate,
New Delhi.
3.

During the pendency of the above said criminal proceedings the petitioner

and respondent no. 4 resolved their dispute regarding the loan amount and have
come to an amicable settlement and the petitioner is stated to have made the
payment to the complainant bank as per the settlement.
4.

Since one of the offences for which the petitioner was being prosecuted,

namely, under Section 406 IPC was not compoundable as per the provisions of

Section 320 Cr.P.C the present petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was filed by the
petitioner. Notice of the petition was sent to the State and the complainant bank.
The bank entered appearance through its counsel on 10.10.2007. In support of
this petition learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance upon one judgment
of the Apex Court in “Nalini Shankaran & Ors. v. Neelkanth Mahadeo Kamble &
Ors.” 2007 (2) Crimes 329 (SC), and three judgments of this Court in “Rishi Raj &
Ors. v. The State” 2001 (2) JCC 234, “Ajay Kumar & Ors. v. State & Ors.”
131(2006)DLT 130 and “D.C. Singham v. State & Anr.” 2006 (1) JCC 371.
5.

Learned counsel representing respondent no.4 submitted before this Court

that bank has received its loan amount and affirmed that the matter has been
amicably resolved and so it was no more interested in pursuing the case against
the petitioner. On receipt of full and final payment of the entire amount respondent
no. 4 issued a certificate in writing on 04.03.2005 which is annexed to this petition
as ‘Annexure-B’ stating that bank has adjusted the term loan by way of
compromise and that there are no outstanding dues against the petitioner.
6.

Learned APP for the State, however, opposed quashing of the FIR on the

ground that that allegations against the petitioner are grave in nature and the
offence under Section 406 IPC is not compoundable under Section 320 Cr.P.C. and
if this offence is permitted to be compounded that would amount to bye-passing
the provisions of section 320 Cr.P.C. which should not be done by this Court by
exercising the inherent jurisdiction vested in it under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

7.

I have given my due consideration to the rival submissions. It is now well

settled by many judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court that FIRs even in respect
of those offences which are not compoundable under section 320 Cr.P.C. can be
quashed as also the criminal proceedings emanating therefrom if it is felt by the
Court while dealing with a quashing petition under section 482 Cr.P.C. that it would
secure the ends of justice if the FIR and criminal proceedings arising therefrom are
quashed and continuation of the criminal proceedings would amount to abuse of
the process of law. Reference in this regard can be made to one of the judgments
of Hon’ble Supreme Court which is reported in “B.S.Joshi & Ors. Vs. State of
Haryana & Anr.”, AIR 2003 SC 1386 wherein it has been so held. It is significant to
note that one of the offences in that case was also under section 406 I.P.C. but still
the criminal proceedings were quashed because of the compromise between the
complainant side and the accused persons. In the present case, the FIR against the
accused came to be registered primarily because of his failure to pay the
instalment amount which the complainant bank had sanctioned. Since the
complainant has received back the amount from the accused it would secure the
ends of justice if the FIR registered against the petitioner and the ongoing trial are
quashed.
8.

This petition is accordingly allowed and consequently FIR No. 558/2002

under Sections 406/420/120-B IPC registered at police station Ambedkar Nagar
and criminal proceedings arising therefrom pending in the Court of Ms. Geetanjali

Goel, Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi are hereby quashed against the chargesheeted accused.
