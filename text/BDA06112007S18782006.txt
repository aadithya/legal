1.

This application has been filed, essentially under Section 151 of

the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 invoking the inherent powers of this
Court, by the plaintiff seeking a direction that the defence of the
defendant be struck off on account of the non-compliance with the orders
passed by this Court on 19.03.2007 in IA No. 11084/2006.

2.

It is admitted that on 19.03.2007 this Court had directed the

IA 8048/2007 in CS(OS) 1878/2006

Page No. 1 of 3

defendant to continue to pay a sum of Rs 3.6 lacs per month as per the
licence agreement dated 09.05.2005 between the parties. The Court had
also directed that the arrears be deposited within four weeks in Court and
to await further orders. Unfortunately, the defendant has not abided by
these orders as, neither have the arrears been deposited in Court nor have
the monthly payments of Rs 3.6 lacs been paid to the plaintiff. It is on
the basis of these facts and relying upon the decision of a Division Bench
of this Court as well as two other decisions of learned Single Judges of
this Court that the plaintiff seeks a direction that the defence of the
defendant be struck off. The decisions relied upon by the plaintiff are:(i)

V. P. Puri & Ors. v. Union of India: 2001 III AD (Delhi) 669

(ii)

Arum Travels v. Kanwar Rani: 69 (1997) DLT 567 and

(iii)

Purnima Dhawan & Anr v. Agmoz Online Pvt. Ltd.:
103 (2003) DLT 572.

3.

The learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the order

passed by this Court was an executable order and the same could be
executed at the stage of the final decree.

Therefore, there was no

question of the defence of the defendant being struck off.

4.

I have heard the counsel for the parties and I have also examined

IA 8048/2007 in CS(OS) 1878/2006

Page No. 2 of 3

the decisions mentioned above.

It is apparent that this Court has

inherent powers under Section 151 CPC to strike off the defence of the
defendant in case of disobedience of orders of this Court. The decision
in V. P. Puri (supra) was clearly on this point and it gave a final
opportunity to the defendant to comply with the orders failing which the
defence would be struck off. I feel that the same course of action ought
to be adopted in the present case. This is so because there is no answer
as to why the defendant did not comply with the orders passed on
19.03.2007 particularly when no appeal was preferred from the said
order nor was any variation of the same was ever sought.

5.

In these circumstances, I direct that the defendant shall deposit all

arrears in Court within six weeks and shall also make the monthly
payments of Rs 3.6 lacs each month to the plaintiff for the month of
November 2007 onwards. In case this is not done, then the defence of
the defendant shall be struck off.
This application stands disposed of.
