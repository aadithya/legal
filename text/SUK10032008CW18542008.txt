1.

The matter has been passed over and there has been no

appearance on behalf of the petitioner even on the second call.
2

The petitioner is aggrieved of the rejection of his candidature

apparently conveyed to him by the respondent by letter dated 16th
November, 2006 on the ground that he did not possess essential
qualifications.
3.

According to the petitioner, before taking any decision to reject

his candidature, the respondent was obliged to give him an
opportunity to be heard in the matter.
4.

It is the petitioner's case that after receiving his rejection letter

dated 16th November, 2006 from the respondent, he approached the
Deputy Secretary of the Scrutiny Cell of the respondent seeking

further particulars about the decision taken by the respondent
rejecting his candidature.

He claims that the Deputy Secretary

informed him that his mark sheets are false.

According to the

petitioner, after disclosing this information, no further cooperation
was extended to the petitioner by the respondent.
5.

The petitioner also claims that immediately thereafter, he

discovered

that

although

the

respondent

had

rejected

his

candidature, his friend, namely Mr. Sohan Pal son of Sh. Chandra
Bhan, was allotted a roll number and permitted to sit in the selection
examination to be held on 24th December, 2006 despite the fact that
Mr. Sohan Pal possessed the same qualifications as that of the
petitioner.
6.

It appears that thereafter the petitioner filed an application

under the Right to Information Act on 14th December, 2006 asking the
respondent to disclose why his candidature has been rejected
outright whereas his friend, Mr. Sohan Pal who possesses identical
qualifications

was

considered

qualified

to

take

the

selection

examination. In reply, the respondent informed the petitioner, inter
alia, that they had also issued a show cause notice to him and since
he failed to reply to the show cause notice within the time granted,
the respondent took the impugned decision.

The petitioner claims

that he never received any show cause notice.
7.

Learned counsel for the respondent states although the

relevant information about the required qualifications was duly given
to the petitioner and has also been annexed by the petitioner himself
in Annexure-A at page 23 of the writ petition, the petitioner has failed
to disclose as to whether he holds the requisite qualifications.

8.

In any case, I find that this petition has been filed belatedly.

The

petitioner's

candidature

was

admittedly

rejected

on

16th

November, 2006. Thereafter on 13th December, 2006, he claims to
have approached the respondent's office. On the next day i.e. 14th
December, 2006, he also applied for information under the Right to
Information Act which was supplied to him on 22nd January, 2007. He
applied for further information on 31st January, 2007. To this also, he
had received a reply by 21st February, 2007. Even thereafter, he has
waited for one year before approaching this Court. No explanation is
given to indicate why he could not approach this Court earlier. The
relevant selection was to be held on the basis of a competitive
examination which has already been held some time in December,
2006.

The cause of action, if any, accrued in his favour on 16 th

November, 2006. Whilst the petitioner is seeking relief to the effect
that the letter communicating his rejection on 16th November, 2006
be quashed and that his candidature be considered with retrospective
effect with all consequential benefits, the fact of the matter is that not
only has the relevant examination been held in December, 2006;
counsel for the respondent informs me that the vacancies that
existed on that date have already been filled.

He also states that

thereafter, the next examination of 2007 has also been held.
9.

As I have already stated, for a cause of action that may have

accrued in favour of the petitioner on 16th November, 2006 pertaining
to an examination to be held in December, 2006; I do not see any
reason for this Court to entertain this petition after more than one
year and four months, that too when the next examination of 2007 is
also over. Under the circumstances and keeping in mind the maxim,

Vigilantibus, et non dormientibus, jura subveniunt – the
WP(C) No.1854/2008

Page 3 of 4

vigilant and not the sleepy are assisted by the laws; It would
not be appropriate for this Court to entertain this petition at this
late stage.
10.

The writ petition is dismissed.
