statement refuting the allegations of the plaintiff in the
main suit and raised certain preliminary objections which
are legal in nature. Defendant also filed its counter claim
against the plaintiff but the plaintiff failed to file written
statement to the counter claim. On 12.12.2005, suit of the

It is the counter claim of the

defendant (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff) which is
under consideration before this Court.

3. Plaintiff in the counter claim has averred that it is a duly
incorporated company and Mr. Shantanu Prakash, Director
of the plaintiff company, is competent to sign, verify and
file the counter claim. Brief facts of the counter claim are
that defendant Shabnam let out her entire premises No. R7, Hauz Khas, New Delhi for plaintiff company's office-cumresident/guest house by way of lease agreement dated
18.12.2000.

Plaintiff company carried out renovation in

the premises including Barsati floor in consultation with

After

certain deliberations, it was agreed that the plaintiff

shall be permitted to use the same for five years without
any additional charge towards rent and therefore would be
entitled to all refunds/adjustments.

that unauthorized construction was being carried out at the
second floor without the sanction plan. Vide order dated
25.4.2001 under Section 345A of Municipal Corporation
Act, the Deputy Commissioner, South Zone ordered the
sealing of the entire premises which were accordingly
sealed. Plaintiff was deprived from using the premises for
the purposes for which it had taken the same on rent. The
sealing of the premises was on account of defendant's act

avoided. Premises were sealed on 27.4.2001. In exercise

communication dated 2.9.2001, called upon the defendant
to take back the possession of the premises. Plaintiff has
claimed the following amount from the defendant:(1)a sum of Rs. 6 lacs towards furniture
and fitting security,
(2)rent of Rs. 3,30,000/- to be refunded,
(3)advance rent of Rs. 2,57,500/- to be

on

behalf of the defendant in the suit
premises and Rs.5,00,000/- as damages.
Plaintiff in all has claimed a sum of Rs.
34,76,023/-.

4. Plaintiff company in the counter claim led evidence by way
of an affidavit of Sh. Shantanu Prakash, Managing Director
of the company which is Ex. PW1/A. From this affidavit in
CS (OS) No. 321/2002

Page 4 of 11

evidence it is proved that plaintiff is a duly incorporated
company vide certificate of incorporation copy of which is
Ex. PWCC-1/2 and Sh. Shantanu Prakash, the deponent,
has been authorised by way of a Resolution dated
30.8.2006 to sign, verify and file the present suit on behalf
of the plaintiff company.

5. Plaintiff and the defendant had entered into a lease
agreement dated 18.12.2000 Ex.PWCC-1/3. As per clause
11 of the lease agreement, plaintiff paid security deposit of
Rs. 4,40,000/- refundable at the time of expiry of lease
agreement and after handing over vacant possession of the
premises with all the fittings and fixtures to the lessor. As
per clause 12

of the lease agreement plaintiff also paid

advance of Rs. 3,30,000/- as is established from the receipt
dated 15.12.2000 dated PWCC-1/8 equivalent to three
months rent to be adjusted in 12 months by deducting
every month an equal amount from the monthly rent.
Premises were let out on a monthly rent of Rs.1,10,000/-.
There is a moratorium period in clause 14 of the lease
agreement by virtue of which time was granted to the
plaintiff for doing upgradations before moving in and the
rent was to begin from 1.2.2001.

As per this agreement

plaintiff paid a total sum of Rs. 7,70,000/- to the defendant

CS (OS) No. 321/2002

Page 5 of 11

in terms of clauses 11 and 12 of the lease agreement.
Therefore, it is proved that since after sealing of the
premises by the MCD on 27.04.2001, plaintiff remained out
of possession and finally plaintiff handed over the symbolic
possession

of

the

premises

to

the

defendant

communication dated 2.9.2001 Ex. PWCC1/6.

vide

Therefore,

plaintiff has successfully established his claim of Rs.
7,70,000/-.

6. Plaintiff has claimed Rs. 6 lacs as security paid for
furniture and fitting.

However, neither from the lease

agreement nor from evidence of the plaintiff or by way of
any documentary evidence it is proved that plaintiff had
paid a sum of Rs. 6 lacs as security for furniture and fitting.
Plaintiff has not even explained as to how it was paid
whether in cash or by way of a cheque and when this
money was paid. Since lease agreement was reduced into
writing, this amount would have found mention in the lease
agreement if it was paid. It is specifically mentioned in the
plaint that defendant did not provide any furniture when
the premises were being renovated and some additions and
alteration repairs were carried out on the second floor of
the suit premises. Therefore, plaintiff has not been able to
establish its claim for Rs. 6 lacs as security for furniture

CS (OS) No. 321/2002

Page 6 of 11

and fitting. Hence it is not entitled to this amount.

7. Since plaintiff was in possession of the suit premises from
the date of the execution of the lease till the premises were
sealed by the MCD on 27.4.2001, it is liable to pay rent to
the defendant for the said period. However, since there is
a moratorium clause in the lease agreement and the rent
was to begin from 1.2.2001, plaintiff is liable to pay rent
for two months amounting to Rs. 2,20,000/-.

8. As per admission of the plaintiff itself in exercise of its
right under clause 13 of the lease agreement it had sent
communication

dated

2.9.2001

Ex.

PWCC1/6

to

the

defendant to take vacant possession of the property.

It

seems that defendant did not take symbolic/physical
possession of the suit premises (as they were sealed by the
MCD).

Since plaintiff could not effectively use the

premises after 27.4.2001 and the defendant failed to take
any steps to get the premises desealed and the efforts of
the plaintiff to get the premises desealed failed, plaintiff
cannot

be

held

liable

to

pay

rent

for

the

period

commencing from 1.4.2001. But at the same time plaintiff
cannot claim the refund of rent paid by it to the defendant
for the period from 1.2.2001 to 31.3.2001 as it remained

CS (OS) No. 321/2002

Page 7 of 11

in physical possession of the premises immaterial of the
fact that it was carrying out additions, alterations or
renovation in the suit premises during that period.

By

virtue of clause 14 of the lease agreement, it is liable to
pay rent of the premises from 1.2.2001.

Moratorium

period was only for 45 days to carry out the renovation
work. In case plaintiff continued the renovation work even
thereafter, it cannot claim suspension of rent for the period
till the premises was actually sealed by the MCD.
Therefore, plaintiff is not entitled to refund of the entire
rent paid by hit to the defendant. In all out of sum of Rs.
2,57,000/-, it is entitled to a sum of Rs.37,500/-.

9. Plaintiff has claimed Rs.13,48,523/- as expenses incurred
by it for additions, alterations and renovation of suit
premises. To prove its claim, it has placed on record and
proved in evidence various invoices and bills Ex.PWCC1/4
(colly).

Perusal of these bills/invoices indicates that

plaintiff paid a sum of Rs. 5,69,310/- only against Bills
06/2001, 07/2001, 03/2001, 04/2001, 4245, 4247, 4264,
4253, 2129 and 183.

Plaintiff has failed to prove in

evidence that it had paid other bills/invoices 12/2001,
14/2001, 17/2001, 21/2001, 10/2001, 15/2001, 13/2001,
11/2001, 09/2001, 0022, 054, 055 and 1823. Plaintiff has

CS (OS) No. 321/2002

Page 8 of 11

not

examined

any

of

the

representatives/proprietors/

owners of the firms to show that they had supplied goods
to the plaintiff in the said premises and they had received
the payment against those bills/invoices.

It was for the

plaintiff to prove its own case which it has failed.

It is

pertinent to mention here that as per clause 15 of the lease
agreement, lessor (defendant) had permitted the lessee
(plaintiff) to make temporary additions to the property at
the lessee's cost.

However, the agreement is silent as to

who had to bear the cost of the upgradation of the suit
premises.

If clause 14 & 15 are read together, then

plaintiff is entitled to claim the money spent by it on the
upgradation of the suit premises but not for temporary
additions made in the property. Plaintiff has to bear the
cost of temporary additions at its own end.

Since the

plaintiff has only established its claim for Rs. 5,69,310/and as observed above, it can claim money spent on the
upgradation of the suit premises.

It is entitled to Rs.

5,69,310/- as proved in evidence.

10.Plaintiff has claimed damages amounting to Rs. 5 lacs.
This claim of damages has been made on the plea that it
had spent substantial amount to shift its office to the suit
premises. Plaintiff was in the process of closing down office

CS (OS) No. 321/2002

Page 9 of 11

at 1211, Padma Tower I, 5 Rajendra Place, New Delhi.
However, again plaintiff has failed to prove in evidence
that it incurred expenses amounting to Rs. 5 lacs or even
more, as it was closing down its business at 1211, Padma
Tower I, 5 Rajendra Place, New Delhi, with a view to shift
its office cum residence to the suit premises. No statement
of accounts to that effect has been placed on record to
indicate the income of the plaintiff company prior to its
entering into lease agreement with the defendant and the
income incurred by it in the month of February and March,
2001 when it was preparing for shifting its business to
prove that it suffered loss in the business due to the
shifting process. Admittedly, the plaintiff had not shifted in
the suit premises at all. In the absence of any corroborative
evidence, bald statement of Sh. Shantanu Prakash that
plaintiff suffered damages to the tune of Rs. 5 lacs is not
sustainable. Therefore, in view of my discussion as above,
plaintiff is not entitled to damages as claimed.

11.Hence, I hereby pass a decree for Rs. 13,76,810/- with
proportionate cost in favour of plaintiff and against
defendant.

Plaintiff is also awarded interest @12 % per

annum on the decretal amount from the date of the
institution of the counter claim till realisation of the

CS (OS) No. 321/2002

decretal amount. Decree be prepared accordingly. File be
consigned.
