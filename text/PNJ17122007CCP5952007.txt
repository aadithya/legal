PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
On 6.2.2007, WP(C) No.11857/2006 filed by the

petitioner was disposed of with the following order :“06.02.2007
Rule.
With the consent of learned counsel for both
the parties, the petition is taken up for final
disposal.
Learned counsel for the petitioner states that
he is confining the relief in the present
petition to the prayer that the respondent be
directed to complete the inquiry proceedings
pending against the petitioner in a time bound
manner. It is stated by the learned counsel
page 1 of 7

for the petitioner that 3 charge sheets were
issued by the respondent to the petitioner,
dated 28.8.1996, 18.12.1997 and 10.9.2003.
Learned counsel for the respondent states
that the Inquiry Committee is making efforts
to complete the inquiry proceedings with
respect to all the three charge sheets
expeditiously.
Directions are issued to the respondent to
ensure that the inquiry proceedings in respect
of all the three charge sheets are completed
expeditiously, preferably within four months,
under intimation to the petitioner.
The
petitioner also gives an assurance that he will
extend full cooperation in completion of the
inquiry and there shall be no attempt on the
part of the petitioner to delay the
proceedings.
The writ petition and the
applications are disposed of accordingly.

2.

Copy of this order be given dasti to learned
counsels for the parties.”
From the order dated 6.2.2007 it is apparent that

challenge was made to the 3 charge sheets dated 28.8.1996,
18.12.1992 and 10.9.2003 on the ground that the continued
disciplinary proceedings were in violation of the right of the
petitioner to a speedy trial. I note that the order records the
desire of the court to have the inquiry proceedings concluded
as early as possible preferably within 4 months.
3.

Alleging contempt it is stated that notwithstanding

the order dated 6.2.2007 disciplinary proceedings continued
much beyond 4 months. Prayer made is to initiate proceedings
for contempt against the respondent as also to quash the
charge sheets and release the retiral benefits of the petitioner.
page 2 of 7

4.

At the outset it may be noted that order dated

6.2.2007 is not couched in mandatory language. The language
is akin to a pious belief.
5.

I may note that the direction issued by the

respondent is to complete the enquiry as expeditiously as
possible. Hope expressed is that preferably the same would be
completed within 4 months.
6.

Be that as it may, I have independently considered

the matter on merits for the reason, respondent cannot unduly
prolong the disciplinary proceedings, especially for the reason,
petitioner has retired and has not received, as is claimed by
him, the retiral benefits.
7.

I had called for the records of the Enquiry Officer to

peruse the steps taken after 6.2.2007 to complete the enquiry
proceedings with right earnest.
8.

I note that when the order in question was passed,

the next date had already been notified for further proceedings,
to

be

5.3.2007.

On

said

date

departmental

witness

Mr.R.Gulgule was examined. Part of the proceedings relate to
the enquiry committee dealing with the request of the
petitioner that one Mr.R.Nag who had since retired from service
be permitted to act his defence assistance and the committee
responding that under the regulations only a serving employee
page 3 of 7

could act as the defence assistance. The next date notified was
6.3.2007, i.e. the very next day.
9.

What is relevant for purposes of the instant petition

is that on 5.3.2007 the Enquiry committee took earnest steps to
continue with the enquiry.

Record of the enquiry committee

pertaining to the meeting held on 6.3.2007 shows the further
desire of the petitioner to have assistance of Mr.R.Nag and his
request that cross-examination of the departmental witness
Mr.R.Gulgule be deferred till he arranges a defence assistance.
The matter was renotifed for 22.3.2007. Nothing transpired on
said date in view of representation received from the petitioner
that he had sought permission from the Chairman-cumManaging Director that Mr.R.Nag be permitted to act as his
defence assistance.

Matter was renotifed for 9.5.2007 when

petitioner was allowed to be represented through Mr.R.Nag as
his defence assistance.

Mr.R.Gulgule was cross-examined by

the defence assistance for about an hour. Matter was listed on
10.5.2007. On said date Mr.R.Gulgule was cross-examined at
length for nearly 5 hours. The order dated 10.5.2007 records
that the committee desired that further hearing should be held
as quickly as possible and proposed 18.5.2007 for said
purpose.

But, petitioner stated that he was not in town and

requested for another date. The matter was listed thereafter
page 4 of 7

for further consideration on 16.7.2007. Mr.R.Gulgule was crossexamined on said date.

Cross-examination continued on

17.7.2007. Order sheet dated 17.7.2007 record that the
Enquiry Committee was inclined to hold further proceedings the
next date subject to an assurance from the defence counsel
that cross-examination would be completed in 2 hours.

The

defence counsel, i.e. petitioner's assistant informed that the
cross-examination was likely to continue much beyond 2 hours.
It records by consensus that further proceedings would be held
from 21.8.2007 till 23.8.2007. Hearing scheduled for 21.8.2007
could not take place as a member of the Enquiry Committee
had to attend official work.
22.8.2007.

The committee reassembled on

Matter had to be adjourned as Mr.R.Nag, the

defence assistant was stated to be out of town. Proceedings
were adjourned to 24.9.2007. On said date the defence
assistant Mr.R.Nag did not appear and on said account matter
had to be adjourned. 12th to 14th November, 2007 were notified
as the dates for further hearing. All 3 dates got frustrated as
neither petitioner nor his defence assistant were present. Next
date notified was 19.11.2007. When the committee assembled
petitioner sought hearing to be deferred by a few hours stating
that Mr.R.Nag was likely to be available at around lunch time.
Defence assistant did not come.

Matter was adjourned for
page 5 of 7

20.11.2007. Mr.Gulgule was present for being cross-examined.
Defence assistant was not present.

Matter was listed for

21.11.2007. Once again, defence assistant was not available.
Matter was thereafter listed for 29.11.2007. It was postponed
for the next date i.e. 30.11.2007. Defence assistant failed to
appear. Petitioner was given an opportunity to cross-examine
the witness. He declined.
10.

It is apparent that the petitioner is dragging on with

the matter. I note that the order dated 6.2.2007 records that
the petitioner will extend full cooperation in the completion of
the enquiry.
11.

It was sought to be urged by learned counsel for the

petitioner that the department is not willing to bear the
traveling expenses of the defence assistant.
12.

I am afraid, this substantive dispute cannot form the

subject matter of consideration under contempt jurisdiction. If
the rules require that the department has to bear the traveling
expenses of the defence assistant, petitioner would be advised
to take resort to an appropriate action. If the rules are silent or
do not permit so, petitioner has to make available the
necessary finances.
13.

No case is made out to take any action under

contempt jurisdiction against the respondent.

The petition is dismissed.

15.

No costs.
