1.
The Petitioner, Director of Education and others
challenge the order passed by the Central Administrative
Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (the Tribunal) in O.A. No.
2886/2005 dated 2nd May 2006 whereby, while holding that there
is no infirmity in the order passed by the petitioner herein,
direction was issued to consider the case of the Respondent

herein for compassionate appointment by having regard to the
DOPT OM dated 5.5.2003.
2.

The Respondent No.1 is the younger of the two sons,

and Respondent No. 2 is the widow of Late Shri Ram Chander,
who died in harness on 18.12.2004 while suffering from paralysis.
His family consisted of his widow and two sons, out of which the
elder one is

living separately. Shri Ram Chander also had

daughters, who were married of by him in his life time. The family
was granted a sum of Rs.7,65,309/- towards terminal benefits
upon the death of Late Shri Ram Chander and the wife of
deceased is getting family pension of Rs.4,275/- per month. The
family owns a residential house of their own, where they reside.
Respondent No. 1 is a married son, and was 33 years of age at
the relevant time.

Upon

Respondents

the

applied

death
for

of

Shri

compassionate

Ram

Chander,

appointment

of

Respondent No. 1 on 22.3.2005. After making certain inquiries
from

the

Respondents,

on

31.7.2005

the

Petitioners

communicated their decision not to recommend the Respondent's
case

for

compassionate

appointment.

Thereafter

his

representation dated 11.10.2005 was also rejected by the
Director of Education i.e., Petitioner No.1 herein.

4.

Consequently,

the

Respondents

preferred

the

aforesaid Original application before the Tribunal.
5.

The stand of the Petitioner before the Tribunal, as

noted by the Tribunal in the impugned order itself, was that,
though the Petitioner had considered the application of the
Respondent, he was found to be less deserving when compared
to the other applicants for seeking compassionate appointment.
The Petitioners stated that compassionate appointments were
made in cases where the emoluments were even less and
dependants were more, and there were liabilities of a minor child.
6.

The Tribunal held, and in our view rightly so, that on a

comparative evaluation, if any candidate is found to be more
deserving, he has a preferential case to be appointed. The
Tribunal also notes that the right of compassionate appointment
is only a right of consideration and cannot be used to gain
indirect entry into Government service.

However, by placing

reliance on DOPT OM dated 5.5.2003, the Tribunal held that the
Respondent no.1 had a continuing right of consideration of his
case for compassionate appointment from time to time, for upto
three years, in the eventuality of change of circumstances. Based
on the aforesaid understanding of the O.M. dated 5.5.2003, the
Tribunal gave a direction to the petitioners to consider the case
W.P. (C) No. 10784-87/2006

Page 3 of 7

of the applicant within the time limit prescribed by the said O.M.
7.

The petitioners are aggrieved by the interpretation

given by the Tribunal to the said OM dated 5.5.2003.
8.

The OM dated 5.5.1993 reads as follows:
“Time-limit
for
compassionate
appointment. - The undersigned is directed to
refer to Department of Personal and Training
O.M. No.14014/6/94-Estt. (D), dated 9.10.1988
and O.M. No. 14014/23/99-Estt. (D) dated
3.12.1999
(Orders
(2)
and
(3)
above
respectively) on the above subject and to say
that the question of prescribing a time limit for
making appointment on compassionate grounds
has
been
examined
in
the
light
of
representations received, stating that the oneyear limit prescribed for grant of compassionate
appointment is often resulting in depriving
genuine
cases
seeking
compassionate
appointments, on account of regular vacancies
not being available, within the prescribed period
of one year and within the prescribed ceiling of
5% of Direct Recruitment quota.
2. It has, therefore, been decided that if
compassionate appointment to genuine and
deserving cases, as per the guidelines
contained in the above OMs is not possible in
the first year, due to non-availability of regular
vacancy, the prescribed Committee may review
such cases to evaluate the financial conditions
of the family to arrive at a decision as to
whether a particular case warrants extension by
one
more
year,
for
consideration
for
compassionate appointment by the Committee,
subject to availability of a clear vacancy within
the prescribed 5% quota. If on scrutiny by the
Committee, a case is considered to be
deserving, the name of such a person can be
continued for consideration for one more year.

W.P. (C) No. 10784-87/2006

Page 4 of 7

3. The minimum time a person's name can be
kept
under
consideration
for
offering
Compassionate Appointment will be three
years, subject to the condition that the
prescribed Committee has reviewed and
certified the penurious condition of the
applicant at the end of the first and the second
year. After three years, if compassionate
appointment is not possible to be offered to the
applicant, his case will be finally closed, and will
not be considered again.
4.
The instructions contained in the above
mentioned OMs stand modified to the extent
mentioned above.
5.
The above decision may be brought to the
notice of all concerned for information,
guidance and necessary action.”

9.

A reading of the aforesaid OM shows that it is not in

every case that the application for compassionate appointment, if
not immediately allowed, has to be kept pending and reviewed
for a period of three years. It is only in cases where the
Committee

considering

compassionate

appointments

has

reviewed and certified the penurious condition of the applicant at
the end of the first and the second year that the application can
be kept pending for consideration up to a maximum of 3 years.
Moreover, this OM would not apply in situations where the
application is not granted on the ground of comparative merit.

W.P. (C) No. 10784-87/2006

Page 5 of 7

This OM would apply only in situations, where even though a
highly deserving case exists, the applicant cannot be granted
appointment

due

to

non-availability

of

vacancies.

If

the

interpretation of the Tribunal of the said O.M is taken to be
correct, every such application would necessarily have to be kept
pending and considered every year for a period of three years.
That, in our view is not the purpose of the said OM.
10.

It

was

not

the

Respondent's

case

that

the

Respondent's application was so considered by the Committee to
be highly deserving and that it was decided, at the end of the
first or the second year to keep the application pending for
consideration in subsequent years. In fact, the Respondents were
informed on 31.7.2005 that their case was not recommended for
compassionate

appointment

at

all.

Upon

their

further

representation made on 11.10.2005, the same was turned down
by the Petitioner herein on 28.10.2005. The stand of the
petitioner was not that there were no vacancies existing to
consider case of the Respondent No. 1. The stand was that there
were more deserving cases who were granted compassionate
appointment. Consequently, the said OM dated 5.5.2003 had no
application in the facts of this case.
11.

This petition is accordingly allowed.

W.P. (C) No. 10784-87/2006

Rule made

Page 6 of 7

absolute. The direction issued by the Tribunal to the Petitioners to
consider the case of the Respondent/applicant within the time
limit prescribed under OM dated 5.5.2003, i.e., up to a period of 3
years as contained in the impugned order dated 2.5.2006 is
quashed and set aside. The O.A. filed by the Respondents is
accordingly dismissed.
12.

No costs.
