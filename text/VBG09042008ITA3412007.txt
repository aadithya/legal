The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (for short as
„Tribunal‟) vide its order dated 31st August, 2006 in ITA
No.3231/Del/04 relevant for the assessment year 2001-02
has allowed to the Assessee relief of Rs.15,48,502/- on
account of valuation of its opening stock.

2.

Aggrieved by the decision of the Tribunal, the

Revenue has filed the present appeal.
3.

Brief facts leading to dispute are that the Assessee is

a registered firm showing income from business of
manufacturing rubber flaps and re-treading of tyres.
Return was filed by the Assessee declaring loss at
Rs.86,170/-

on

29.10.2001.

During

the

assessment

proceedings, the Assessing Officer noted that the Assessee
had hypothecated its stock with Bank of India, Hauz Khas,
New Delhi for availing overdraft facility.

The details of

stock hypothecated with bank quantity-wise and value-wise
was obtained from the Bank, according to which the total
value of stock was Rs.33,98,640/- whereas the Assessee
had

declared

the

valuation

of

closing

Rs.16,14,155/- in its books of accounts.

stock

at

The Assessing

Officer, therefore, required the Assessee to explain the
difference.
4.

On behalf of the Assessee it was submitted that the

valuation of stock was inflated in the statement furnished
to the bank for obtaining the maximum cash credit limit. It
was further added that because of the sudden closure of

ITA No.341/2007

Page 2 of 6

the factory operation in November, 2002, the Assessee
could not make any fresh purchases and consequently the
sales also declined, creating lot of financial constraints and
under these circumstances, there was no alternative but to
inflate the stock so as to avail the maximum over draft
limit.
5.

The Assessing Officer rejected this explanation of the

Assessee and made addition of Rs.17,84,486/- on account of
the difference between the value of stock shown in the
hypothecation

statement

and

value

of

closing

stock

declared in the return.
6.

Aggrieved by this order, Assessee filed an appeal

before Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [for short as
„CIT(A)‟]. Besides repeating the explanation taken by the
Assessee before the Assessing Officer, a fresh plea was also
raised by the Assessee that there was, no doubt, a
difference of Rs.17,84,486/- but then there was also a
difference of Rs.15,48,502/- in the value of stock as on the
opening day.

It was explained that the value of closing

stock as on

31.3.2000

as per

bank

statement was

Rs.40,06,760/- whereas in the balance sheet the same was

ITA No.341/2007

Page 3 of 6

at Rs.24,58,257/-.

Thus, a plea was made, that, if an

addition to be made on account of difference between the
stock shown to the bank and the stock shown in the
balance sheet is to be confirmed, reduction should be
allowed for the difference which was there in the opening
stock.

Thus, it was pointed out that net difference of

Rs.2,35,983/- only (Rs.17,84,486/- to Rs.15,48,502/-) would
be left which could be added as against the addition of
Rs.17,84,486/-.
7.

CIT (A) confirmed the addition in the difference of

stock as made by the Assessing Officer (which has also
been accepted by the Assessee), though he allowed the
relief of Rs.15,48,502/- to the Assessee, accepting alternate
plea of the Assessee that such difference in the valuation of
closing stock is to be reduced by the similar difference in
the opening stock.
8.

Aggrieved thereby, the Revenue filed an appeal

before the Tribunal who confirmed the order passed by the
CIT (A).

It has been contended by the learned counsel for the

Revenue

that

the

Assessing

Officer

had

added

the

difference only after considering the explanation made by
the Assessee and the details obtained from bank.

The

Assessee

discrepancy in valuation of closing stock.

The opening

stock of the current year is the closing stock of the
immediately preceding year and therefore, if any relief is
allowed in the current year on account of valuation of
opening stock then the similar addition would have to be
made in the immediately preceding year.
10.

As per facts, the Assessee has fairly accepted the fact

that there was a difference between the stock shown in the
balance sheet and the stock shown to the bank.
difference in money value has been accepted.

The

The only

plea is that the difference of the value of the goods in the
opening stock as between that shown to the bank and that
shown to the department should be reduced.
11.

It has been held by CIT (A) that:“The justice demands that reduction should
be allowed for that part of the inflated cost

ITA No.341/2007

Page 5 of 6

which pertains to the opening stock i.e. the
closing stock of the last year.
For that
purpose, an addition of the equivalent
amount for the inflated stock pertaining to
the immediate assessment year is to be
excluded. As for the year in question, a
corresponding reduction will be allowed so
as to avoid double addition.”

12.

The Tribunal has also confirmed the findings of the

CIT (A) on this issue.

Further, both the authorities had

taken into account the opening and closing stock of last
year and have rightly excluded the inflated stock pertaining
to the immediately preceding year. Thus, the approach of
Tribunal cannot be said to perverse or erroneous.
13.

In view of the above, no substantial question of law

arises for consideration.
14.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
