JUDGMENT
P.K.BHASIN, J:
By these petitions under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973, the petitioners have prayed for quashing of the complaint case no. 98/05
filed by the respondents under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,
1881 as also the order dated 29.10.2005 passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate
summoning them as accused. Since both these petitions arise out of the same
criminal complaint and were heard also analogously I shall be deciding them by
this common order.
2.

The relevant facts are that the respondents filed a complaint against the

petitioners no. 1 to 4 in Crl.M.C.No. 1761-65/2006 and ICICI Bank Housing Finance
Ltd. and also against the two petitioners in Crl.M.C.No. 6235-36/2005 under
Section 138 read with Sections 141 & 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,
1881 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’) alleging that respondent no. 2 herein
and his wife had agreed to sell a flat in Vaishali(Ghaziabad) to respondent no.3
herein and his wife and to enable them to pay the sale consideration to respondent
no. 2 they approached the ICICI Bank Home Finance Ltd. for loan. It was alleged
in the complaint that loan of Rs. 9,00,000/- was sanctioned by and two demand
drafts for Rs. 5,50,000/- and Rs. 2,40,000/- were prepared in the joint name of

respondent no.2 herein and his wife(the sellers of the flat) and the same were to
be deposited in A/c No. 68-100-19940 with Allahabad Bank and that account was
in the names of respondents no. 1 and 2 herein and this account number was
specifically mentioned in the two Demand Drafts also. Third Demand Draft for Rs.
1,10,000/- was prepared in the name of respondent no. 3 (the purchaser of the
flat as the borrower). All the three Demand Drafts were issued by ICICI Bank.
When the three demand drafts dated 31st July, 2005 were presented for
encashment by the respondents to ICICI Bank all were dishonoured as their
payment was stopped by the drawer. After serving statutory demand notices on
the petitioners 1 to 4 in Crl.M.C.No. 1761-65/2000 and the two petitioners of
Crl.M.C.No. 6235-36/2006 as well as upon ICICI Bank Housing Finance Ltd. the
respondents herein filed a criminal complaint in Court in respect of the three
dishonoured Demand Drafts. In that complaint accused no. 1 was the ICICI Bank
Housing Finance Ltd. and other accused were the petitioners 1 to 4 of Crl.M.C.No.
1761-65/2006 and petitioners 1 and 2 of Crl.M.C.No. 6235-36/2006. The learned
Magistrate took cognizance for the offence under Section 138 of the Act in respect
of the two demand drafts for Rs. 5,50,000/- and Rs. 2,40,000/- only since the third
demand draft had not been placed on record by the complainants and then
summoned all the seven accused. The petitioners of these two petitions, out of
whom one petitioner is ICICI Bank Ltd., which was not an accused in the complaint
nor was it summoned felt aggrieved by the summoning order and so they filed

these two petitions for quashing of the complaint and the summoning order.
3.

The only point urged on behalf of the petitioners in these two petitions by

their counsel was that the complaint qua petitioners 1 to 4 in Crl.M.C.No.1761-65
of 2006 and the two petitioners in the other petition was not maintainable since in
the complaint nothing had been pleaded as to how these petitioners, who had
been arraigned in the complaint as accused only because of being the employees
of ICICI Bank Housing Finance Ltd., were responsible and liable for the dishonour of
the two Demand Drafts in question which were allegedly got prepared as a loan to
respondent no. 3 herein by ICICI Bank Housing Finance Ltd. to enable them to
purchase some flat in Vaishali. Learned counsel had also submitted that the only
averment in the complaint against these petitioners was that they were employees
of accused no. 1(ICICI Bank Housing Finance Ltd.) and they were holding office as
Manager/Senior Executive and were responsible collectively for giving the ‘stop
payment’ instructions in respect of the Demand Drafts in question but these
averments were not sufficient to make them vicariously liable in respect of the
offence allegedly committed by the Company of which they were alleged to be the
employees, namely, ICICI Bank Housing Finance Ltd.
4.

On the other hand, respondent no. 1, who argued the matter in person being

a practicing advocate and as a counsel for other two respondents, (although as per
the case of the petitioners he is a builder as well as a broker), submitted that the
averments against the employees of ICICI Bank Housing Finance Ltd. made in the

complaint were more than sufficient to summon them as accused. In support, he
cited one judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in “S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Vs.
Neeta Bhalla & Anr.” JT 2005 (8) 450.
5.

I have gone through the said judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in S.M.S.

Pharmaceuticals’ case (supra) relied upon on behalf of the respondents and find
that in that case itself it was clearly held that a clear case should be spelled out in
the complaint against the persons sought to be prosecuted by invoking Section
141 of the Act. In that case one Director of the accused Company was sought to
be prosecuted with the aid of Section 141 of the Act and when that Director
challenged his prosecution it was observed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court that a
Director cannot be prosecuted merely on the allegation of his being a Director. It
has to be averred in the complaint that at the time the offence was committed the
person impleaded as an accused was in charge of and responsible for the conduct
of business of the company. In the present case, none of the petitioners in the two
petitions was even a Director of ICICI Bank Housing Finance Ltd. and, therefore, the
complaint against them on the mere allegation that they were the employees of
the said Company could not be entertained. It appears that it was the grievance of
the complainants that petitioner no. 3 Ms. Abhishikha Chaddha and petitioner no.
4 Ms. Sangmitra in Crl.M.C. no. 1761-65/2006 and petitioner no. 1 Nitin Yadav in
the other petition had demanded ‘refreshment/bribe amount’ of Rs. 50,000/- from
the complainants for releasing the payment of the three demand drafts. However,

learned Metropolitan Magistrate took cognizance only for the offence under section
138 of the act and not of these allegations of demand of bribe by the said three
employees of ICICI Bank Housing Finance Ltd. Therefore, in my view, the
employees of ICICI Bank Housing Finance Ltd. who had been impleaded as
accused in the complaint could not be summoned for the offence under Section
138 of the Act with the aid of Section 141 of the Act without there being an
averment in the complaint that at the time of the commission of the offence they
were in charge and responsible to the Company for the conduct of the business of
the Company.
6.

In the result, both these petitions are allowed to the extent that the criminal

complaint No. 98 of 2005 against petitioners no. 1 to 4 in Crl.M.C. No. 176165/2006 and against petitioners 1 & 2 in Crl.M.C. No. 6235-35/2005 and the
order dated 29.10.2005 passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate
summoning them as accused would stand quashed.

The complaint would,

however, proceed against ICICI Bank Housing Finance Ltd., which was impleaded
as accused no.1 in the complaint since it has chosen not to challenge the order
dated 29.10.2005 whereby it was also summoned as an accused through its
Chairman cum Managing Director.
