ORDER

%
1.

Possession of the flat was handed over to the petitioner by DDA on
20th June, 2006. The respondent-Distcom however, refused to grant
electricity connection till payment of Rs.52,438.34p towards dues prior
to 20th June, 2006.

2. Earlier, the flat was occupied by Mr.S.S.Bhattacharya, who had vacated
the

flat

on

21st

August,

1999.

Before

accepting

surrender,

Mr.S.S.Bhattacharya was asked to get clearance and pay electricity
bills. It is an admitted case of the respondent-distcom that a final bill
dated 30th June, 1999 for Rs.8366.58
Bhattacharya and the same stands paid.

was issued to

Mr.S.S.

3.

The question which arise for consideration is whether respondentdistcom can raise any further demand from Mr.S.S. Bhattacharya or
from DDA after the final bill had been issued and paid. It is the admitted
case that the respondent-distcom raised demand of Rs.52,438.28
towards electricity charges against Mr.S.S.Bhattacharya, after the final
bill dated 30th June, 1999 was issued. This additional demand is
claimed without giving show cause notice and without hearing DDA or
Mr.S.S.Bhattacharya. It is the case of the respondent-DDA that before
Mr.S.S. Bhattacharya had surrendered possession, he was asked to
obtain and make payment of the final bill, so that DDA is not burdened
with any liability on account of electricity dues.

4. Accordingly, it is directed that the respondent-distcom will refund
Rs.27,000/- paid by DDA to them within a period of 15 days. Learned
counsel for the respondent-DDA has handed over latest address of
Mr.S.S.Bhattacharya available with them to the learned counsel for the
respondent-distcom. Liberty is granted to the respondent-distcom to
claim arrears from Mr.S.S. Bhattacharya or from DDA in accordance
with law, after issue of show cause notice and hearing them.
5. However, on this account, the petitioner will not be denied electricity
connection. Petitioner will approach respondent-distcom on 10th April,
2008 at 2.00 p.m. and comply with all formalities and thereafter

electricity connection will be granted within a period of one week
thereafter.
6.

Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of.

DASTI.
