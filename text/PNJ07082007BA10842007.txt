1.

FIR No.1384/2006 dated 8.12.2006
U/S 406/120-B IPC
PS Saraswati Vihar.
Petitioners, father and son have knocked the door of

this Court seeking anticipatory bail in the above captioned FIR.
Before noting the version of the petitioners it would be useful to
note the gravement of the allegations against the petitioners as
find mentioned in the FIR.

Page 1 of 4

directions issued by a learned Metropolitan Magistrate.

The

complainant is Pramod Verma who states that he is carrying on
business in the name and style M/s.P.J.Impressions. He stated in
the complaint that the petitioners are in printing business and he
supplied paper to the petitioners for printing.

He states that

The

charge

inter

alia

of

entrustment

pointing

out

to

is
the

repelled
Court

by

the

that

the

complainant owed them Rs.10,70,261/- towards printing charges.
In respect of said debt he issued various cheques on different
dates, all of which were dishonoured by the banker of the
complainant when presented for encashment.
4.

I note that the date of return of the cheques is

2.12.2002.
5.

According to the petitioners, they lodged a complaint

under Section 138 read with Section 142 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act and it was only when summons were
the complainant by way of a retaliatory

issued

to

Page 2 of 4
measure instant FIR was lodged.
6.

Petitioners have relied upon a letter dated 31.5.2004

written by the complainant admitting therein that Rs.10,70,261/are payable to the petitioners.
7.

It may however be noted that in said letter complainant

has referred to paper and other material lying entrusted to the
petitioner.
8.

Factum of petitioners lodging a complaint against the

complainant of the FIR and petitioners' complaint being under
Section 138 read with Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments
Act is not in dispute.
9.

Following circumstances stand out:(a)

Complainant admittedly issued cheques totaling more
than Rs.10 lacs payable to the petitioners in the year
2002.

(b)

Complainant's grievance pertaining to entrustment of
paper and other material to the petitioners in value of
approximately Rs.66 lacs surfaced for the first time in
the year 2004.

(c)

It remains unexplained as to why the complainant who
had

entrusted

goods

worth

Rs.66

lacs

to

the

petitioners, to off-load his reciprocal obligations
Page 3 of 4
would tender cheques of over Rs.10 lacs to the petitioners.
10.

Normal business transactions of the kind as pleaded by the

complainant required adjustment of mutual entries at the end of each
financial year.
11.

Apart from the normal rule of business prudence, case is

made out for granting anticipatory bail to the petitioners additionally
for the reason the business transaction between the parties is
expected to be documented in the books of accounts; not requiring any
custodial interrogation of the petitioners.
12.

Learned counsel for the State under instructions from the

Inquiry Officer states that the petitioners have been joining the
investigation as and when required by the Inquiry Officer.
13.

Petition accordingly stands disposed of directing that on the

petitioners furnishing a personal bond in sum of Rs.20,000/- each with
one surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Inquiry
Officer, petitioners would be admitted to bail in the above captioned
FIR by the IO.
14.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned counsel for

the petitioner.
