1.
The petitioner faces prosecution under Section
135 of the Customs Act for alleged evasion of customs
Bail Application No. 820/2007

duty to the tune of Rs.1.27 crores.
2.

The petitioner, as proprietor of M/s Pioneer
Soap and Chemicals, imported Crude Palm Oil (nonedible grade) for manufacture of washing soap at
concessional rate of customs duty during the period
of 13th January, 2005 to 11th August, 2005 against 6
bills of entry.

He thus against 65% of normal

customs duty, while seeking exemption in respect of
six consignments of imported raw material, deposited
in cash duty at concessional rate of 20% and out of
balance of 45%, 20% was secured by FDR and the
rest of 25% by furnishing bonds. The petitioner in all
imported consignment to the extent of 1371.878 MT
during the said period availing benefit of payment of
only part of duty.

Against six bills of entry, bonds

against four bills of entry were later discharged and
FDRs returned to the petitioner.
3.

According to the prosecution, the petitioner

Bail Application No. 820/2007

Page 2 of 17

availed benefit of concessional rate of customs duty
by furnishing false returns and fabricated documents
to the jurisdictional Central Excise Authorities. The
statements of witnesses show that the consignments
were, in fact, diverted to the Ghee manufacturers in
U.P. and Haryana and no washing soap was actually
manufactured by him, as claimed. It was pointed out
that

the

applicant

was

functioning

under

Self

Assessment Scheme and as such he was only to
maintain a simple account in respect of receipt and
consumption

of

the

imported

raw

material

for

production before the Assistant Commissioner of
Central Excise as and when so required. As a certain
degree of trust had to be reposed under the Self
Assessment Scheme in the matter of maintenance of
the records by the petitioner, the records maintained
by him, were not being officially checked. The bonds
in respect of four bills of entry out of six were
Bail Application No. 820/2007

Page 3 of 17

discharged and FDRs released to the petitioner on a
bonafide assumption that the relevant records were
being truly and correctly maintained.
4.

Mr. G.L. Rawal, senior counsel, appearing for
the petitioner, argued that out of the amount of
alleged evaded customs duty to the tune of Rs.1.27
crore,

apart

from

deposit

of

duty

in

cash

at

concessional rate of 20%, 10 lakhs have been
deposited by the petitioner on being pressurized in
that regard and FDRs for Rs.11 lakhs being already
with the complainant, there is only a difference of
Rs.20/21 lakhs. He contended that on completion of
investigation a complaint has already been filed before
the Court concerned and thus keeping the petitioner
in confinement is not likely to serve any useful
purpose. Referring to a single Bench decision of the
Bombay High Court in “Sangit Krishna Kumar
Agrawal Vs. Union of India & Ors.”, 2007 (79) RLT
Bail Application No. 820/2007

Page 4 of 17

110 (Bom) rendered by relying upon an earlier single
Bench judgment of the same Court in “Subhash
Chaudhary Vs. Deepak Jayala & Ors”, 2004 (64) RLT
651 (Bom) as also a Punjab and Haryana High Court
decision dated 6th March, 2006 in “Kulbhushan Goyal
v. Joint Commissioner of Customs, CFS, Focal Point,
Ludhiana”

in Criminal

Misc.

Nos.71789-M-2005,

learned senior counsel argued that since an offence
under Section 135 (1) (ii) of the Customs Act, 1962
(for short the 'Act') is punishable with imprisonment
which may extend to three years or fine or both, it
would constitute only a bailable offence and the
petitioner is, therefore, as a matter of right, entitled to
be released on bail.

It was submitted that the

cancellation of bonds and release of FDRs in respect
of four bills of entry out of six, show that the records,
which were produced by the petitioner before the
authority concerned at the relevant
Bail Application No. 820/2007

time, were

Page 5 of 17

accepted to be truly and correctly maintained and
that now it is not open to the complainant to turn
around to say that the records so produced by him
before

the authority concerned, were false and

fabricated ones.
5.

A counter argument was raised on behalf of
the prosecution that the bonds in relation to four bills
of entry were discharged and FDRs released believing
that the relevant records produced by the petitioner
were truly and correctly maintained by the petitioner.
The law, it was contended, reposed an absolute trust
in petitioner as he was functioning under Self
Assessment Scheme and was obliged to maintain a
simple account in respect of receipt and consumption
of imported goods to produce the same before the
authority concerned as and when required. It was
only later in the course of investigation, discovered
that the records, which were produced in respect of

Bail Application No. 820/2007

Page 6 of 17

aforesaid four bills of entry, were actually false and
fabricated ones as instead of using the consignments
in question for manufacture of washing soap, the
same were actually found to have had been diverted
by the petitioner to Ghee manufacturers in U.P. and
Haryana.

In this connection, learned counsel for

complainant referred to statements of transporter/s,
consignment agents and reports of jurisdictional
Central Excise Authorities.

Learned counsel for the

complainant in the context of defence plea that an
offence punishable under Section 135 (i) (ii) of the Act
falls within the category of bailable offences pointed
out that the decision of the Bombay High Court in
Subhash Chaudhary (Supra) holding the offence
punishable under Section 135 (1) (ii) of the Act
bailable and which forms basis of the other decision
of the Bombay High Court in Sangit Krishna Kumari
Agrawal (Supra) as also of Punjab and Haryana High

Court in Kulbhushan Goyal v. Joint Commissioner of
Customs, CFS, Focal Point, Ludhiana being under a
stay by the Supreme Court, cannot be used to lend
assurance to the plea that the offence complained of
is a bailable one.

It was pleaded that as a complaint has already
been filed and cognizance taken by the Court
concerned and the matter is now posted for pre-

Bail Application No. 820/2007

Page 8 of 17

charge evidence, the release of the petitioner on bail,
at this juncture, may jeopardise the prospect of a fair
trial as there is a reasonable apprehension of
petitioner

tampering

with

the

evidence

by

intimidating, pressurising or influencing the public
witnesses keeping in view his past conduct. Learned
counsel submitted that to ensure that the trial is
speeded up, the matter may be directed to be taken
up on day to day basis and concluded within a
specified time frame.

Learned counsel sought to

assure that for complainant only two effective dates
would suffice to conclude its pre-charge evidence.
7.

Adverting to the individual points raised in
support of plea for bail, the fact that against alleged
customs duty evasion to the extent of Rs.1.27 crores
only a difference of Rs.20/21 lacs remains recoverable
from the petitioner is of little consequence in finding
if the petitioner has committed an offence punishable

Bail Application No. 820/2007

Page 9 of 17

under Section 135(1)(ii) of the Act.

The amount of

customs duty deposited at a concessional rate of 20%
and furnishing of FDRs for Rs.11 lacs had, in any
case, to be made by the petitioner to avail of the
benefit of importing raw material at a concessional
rate of customs duty.

Though according to the

records maintained by the petitioner, the raw material
imported against six bills of entry are shown to have
been used for manufacture of washing soap, the

The raw

material imported against six bills of entry were found
to have had actually been diverted by the petitioner to
ghee manufactures in UP and Haryana instead of
using the same for manufacture of washing soap. No
doubt in respect of four bills of entry out of six the
Bail Application No. 820/2007

Page 10 of 17

bonds furnished by the petitioner were discharged
and the FDRs released, but it was done as the
authority concerned, at the relevant time, acted under
a bona-file belief that the relevant records produced
by the petitioner were truly and correctly maintained.
Falsity of returns and fabrication of documents could
be discovered only on evidence regarding diversion of
imported raw material to ghee manufacturers instead
of user thereof for manufacture of washing soap being
collected. Where on arrival of imported raw material
and release of consignments thereof the same are
shown to have, instead of being taken to the factory
premises of the petitioner, been diverted to the ghee
manufactures

in UP and Haryana, the records

showing receipts of such raw material at factory
premises and user thereof in manufacture of washing
soap would prima facie render the genuineness and
correctness

of

the

records

maintained

the

Page 11 of 17

petitioner questionable. Simply because in respect of
import of raw material against four bills of entry out
six, on the basis of records produced
petitioner,

by the

bonds and FDRs furnished against the

same were discharged and released could not be a
reason to brush aside contrary evidence that came to
the notice of the prosecuting agency. Thus, in view of
prima facie evidence of petitioner availing the benefit
of importing raw material at a concessional rate of
customs

duty

by

furnishing

false

returns

and

fabricated documents and thereby evading payment of
normal customs duty, it is altogether immaterial as to
how much amount on account of evasion of customs
duty remains recoverable as on date.
8.

The other argument raised by learned senior
counsel for the petitioner, based on the decisions
referred to above, that an offence punishable under
Section 135(1)(ii) of the Act being a bailable one, the

Bail Application No. 820/2007

Page 12 of 17

petitioner is, as a matter of right entitled to bail, is
unacceptable in the face of a decision of this Court in
“Mohan

Lal

Thapar

Vs.

Y.P.Dabara,

Inspector,

Customs, New Customs House, New Delhi”, 2002 (1)
JCC 460 and another decision dated 1.3.2005 in Bail
Application No.1902/2004 entitled “Inderjeet Nagpal
Vs. Director of Revenue Intelligence(DRI)”, clearly
holding against an offence punishable under Section
135(1)(ii) of the Act being a bailable one.

Even

otherwise, as pointed out by learned counsel for the
respondent-complainant, the decision of the learned
Single Judge of the Bombay High Court in Subhash
Chaudhary(supra), which forms basis for the other
two decisions, referred to above, holding an offence
punishable under Section 135(i)(ii) of the Act as
bailable being under stay by the Supreme Court in
“Union of India & Another Vs. Subhash Chaudhary &
Another” , in petition(s) for special leave to appeal(crl.)
Bail Application No. 820/2007

Page 13 of 17

No.5369-5370/04, no sustenance to the aforesaid
plea can be drawn from these decisions.
The petitioner is, no doubt, in confinement

9.

since 28th of February, 2007, his period of detention
alone, however, in the given facts and circumstances,
cannot supply adequate justification for his release on
bail.

for consideration in deciding the question of grant of
bail, societal and/or National interest must outweigh
such consideration.

bad bargain.

Nature

and

seriousness

of

the

offence,

reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being
tampered with and the larger interest of the public
and the State are some of the considerations that
have to be kept in view to decide the question of grant
of bail to a particular accused.[see Capt. Jagjit
Singh(supra)]. In the present case, apart from there
being a prima facie case of customs duty evasion by
the petitioner to the extent of 1.27 crores, another
disturbing aspect that has to be kept in mind is that
not only that the petitioner by his alleged criminal act

manufacturers played for his selfish gain with the

of the offence. Thus, taking into account the nature
and seriousness of the offence and

reasonable

apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with as
also the larger interest of the public and the State, the
petitioner does not deserve his release on bail.

His

bail plea is, therefore, declined and the petition is
dismissed.

However, keeping in view that the

petitioner is in jail custody since 28th of February,
2007, the learned trial court shall endeavour to
expedite the trial and conclude it within a period not
later than six months from this date. The period of
delay occasioned on account of adjournments sought
on behalf of the petitioner shall not count towards

this six months period.

The petition stands disposed of.
