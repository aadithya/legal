JUDGMENT
1.
that

In this batch of writ petitions it has been prayed -(a)
the

demolition

of

structures

belonging

to

the

Petitioners carried out by the DDA is arbitrary and in
violation of the principles of natural justice; (b) that a
WP(C) 861/2002

Page 2 of 11

mandamus be issued restraining the Respondents from
interfering with the possession of the Petitioners; (c) that a
mandamus be issued declaring the acquisition proceedings
of land forming part of Khasra Nos.733 and 734 measuring
35 bighas 5 biswas situated in Village Basai Darapur as
having lapsed pursuant to Section 11-A of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 ('LA Act' for short); and (d) that the
Respondents be directed to release the land of the
Petitioners under Section 48 of the LA Act.

Prior to the

filing of these Petitions a person interested in this very
parcel of land had approached this Court by filing WP(C)
No.4362/2001 which was decided on 20.12.2001. In those
proceedings

it

had

been

asseverated

by

the

Delhi

Development Authority (DDA) that there was no decision
for de-notifying the subject land acquired under Award
No.7/97-98. This statement contained in the Counter
Affidavit filed on behalf of the Government of NCT of Delhi
has

not

been

challenged.

The

grievance

in

WP(C)

4362/2001 titled Shri Anand Tyagi & Ors. -vs- Union of

India & Ors. was that the Respondents were adopting pick
and choose policy for carrying out demolition. It was in that
WP(C) 861/2002

Page 3 of 11

context that the learned Single Judge had directed “that
the respondents will not take possession only of the land
belonging to the petitioner without taking steps to take
possession of the other portions of the land acquired by the
aforesaid award, which may be required by the respondent
as per requirement of the beneficiaries”. The Petition was
disposed of with these observations. Mr. Sethi, learned
Senior Counsel for the Petitioners, has contended that
under ostensible compliance with these Orders of the
learned Single Judge the entire tract of land belonging to
the sundry petitioners before us had been taken possession
of, overlooking and ignoring the fact that only a small
portion of the land was actually required.

2.

It appears that some of the residents/occupants of the

acquired land had written to the Land Acquisition Collector
that since the acquisition was vide Notification No.F4(35)/
65 L & H dated 28.1.1966, consequent upon amendments
carried out to the LA Act, certificates be issued that the
land was no longer required. An undated letter has been
placed on record as Annexure P-11 purporting to have been
WP(C) 861/2002

Page 4 of 11

written by Naib Tehsildar(LA) Branch Delhi confirming that
the land had not been acquired and it was now free from
acquisition.

This document has been denied by the

Respondents who have emphasised that it does not bear
any reference number or file number. Prima facie, these
documents do not inspire any confidence. Our attention has
also been drawn to a letter dated February, 1998 authored
by Shamim Ahmed, Director (LM) HQ, DDA informing the
residents and local politicians that the Khasra Nos. were
heavily built-up and “as such the land pertaining to these
Khasra

Nos.

cannot

be

utilised

by

DDA”.

The

residents/occupants were advised to take up the matter of
de-notification with the Authorities concerned. By itself any
official or officer of the Government cannot, on its own,
bind the Government as has been observed in this very
letter that the DDA was to convey its opinion regarding denotification

to

the

De-Notification

Committee.

The

Petitioners would have been better advised to rely on the
decision of the De-Notification Committee. Learned counsel
for the Petitioners has also referred to the Representation
dated 8.5.1997 made to the Hon'ble Chief Minister,
WP(C) 861/2002

Page 5 of 11

Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi for
release of the built-up land. Minutes of the Meeting held in
the Office of the Hon'ble Chief Minister on 4.11.1997 have
been placed on the record. It refers to the subject Khasra
No.732 and mentions that the whole area is built-up and in
possession of more than 377 persons and about 1200
tenants; that the acquisition proceedings were to be
completed before 23.9.1986 provided under Section 11-A of
the LA Act; and that the lands were not required for any
project.

These statements are not correct for the reason

that acquisition proceedings had been halted/stayed as a
consequence of interim Orders passed by this Court.
Therefore, it would not be correct to contend that Section
11-A

mandated

proceedings

to

be

completed

before

23.9.1986. It appears that at that Meeting it had been
decided that (1) the Land and Building Department would
immediately write to the DDA regarding de-notification of
the area and (2) only land required for construction of few
shops should be acquired. Since the requisite steps have
not been taken by the Government, the Petitioners cannot
avail of decisions purportedly taken in such Meetings. A
WP(C) 861/2002

Page 6 of 11

vain attempt had been made to establish possession of the
Petitioners over the land by adverting to the letters of Shri
Shamim Ahmed, Director (L & M) to the effect that physical
possession of land acquired vide Award No.7/97-98 had not
been received by the DDA. This does not establish that
physical possession was not taken by the appropriate
Authority.

3.

The Petitioners also rely on a letter dated 28.1.2002

authored by the ADM/LAC (West)

to the Commissioner

LM-II, DDA on the subject of handing over of land required
for development of Local Shopping Center (LSC) at Basai
Darapur. In this letter the addressee was called upon to
furnish to the LAC(West) the exact area of land for
development of the LSC. On this basis it has been
contended that only a small portion of land was required,
and that the rest ought to have been released from
acquisition. We have perused the said letters and are
unable to arrive at the conclusion that the land, other than
that required for the LSC, was in excess of the purposes of
the acquisition. Development of the LSC was only one of
WP(C) 861/2002

Page 7 of 11

the purposes behind the acquisition. For the same reason
the letter authored by the same officer two days later does
not, in any wise, advance the case of the Petitioners. On
the other hand the complaint of the DDA to the effect that
possession of the land measuring 77 Bighas and 8 Biswas in
village Basai Darapur acquired vide Award No.7/97-98 had
not been handed over to the DDA, as expressed in their
letters dated 26.7.1999 and 5.10.2001, makes it amply
clear that the entire land was required for the purposes of
Planned Development of Delhi.

4.

The argument that since the Award was not published

within two years, the entire acquisition had lapsed is devoid
of merit. In Abhey Ram (Dead) by LRs -vs- Union of India,
(1997) 5 SCC 421, a Three-Judges Bench had held that stay
Orders obtained by some of the claimants prohibiting the
Authorities from publication of Declaration under Section 6
would be applicable even to others similarly placed who
had not obtained stay. Without reference to Abhey Ram a
Two-Judges

Bench

had

recently

come

to

the

same

conclusion in the case titled Smt. Bailamma (Dead) -vsWP(C) 861/2002

Page 8 of 11

Poorxnaprajna House Building Co-operative Society, AIR
2000 SC 1132. It was clarified that the “explanation is in
the widest possible terms which do not limit its operation to
cases where an order of stay is obtained by a landowner
alone.

One can conceive of cases where apart from

landowners others may be interested in stalling the land
acquisition proceedings.”

5.

Possession of the lands, which are the subject matter

of these writ petitions, was taken between the period
31.1.2002

and

2.2.2002.

thereafter.

Governor,

ILR(2007) II Delhi 121 and WP(C) No.2972/2007 titled

Satya Narain Prakash Punj -vs- Union of India one of us
along with J.P. Singh, J. had rejected the argument that
assurances given by the Lieutenant Governor to the effect
that colonies and built-up areas would be identified for
regularisation and would be excluded from acquisition
proceedings did not operate as estoppel in favour of the
Petitioners. We had noted that it is incongruent that builtup areas which may subsequently be regularised would be
WP(C) 861/2002

Page 9 of 11

impervious to acquisition, where a regular and legal colony
would be subject to acquisition for public purposes. We had
also reiterated the conclusion that once a prayer under
Section 48 of the LA Act had been made, challenge to the
acquisition proceedings must logically be treated as having
been given up.

6.

Learned counsel for the Respondents have submitted

that the entire land of approximately 77 Bighas continued
to be required for the Planned Development of Delhi. This
is borne out from the documents available on the record.
Several Petitioners had filed Claims pursuant to the
Notices under Sections 9 and 10 of the LA Act.

7.

It will be relevant to mention that five other residents

of Khasra No.732, Basai Darapur, New Delhi, have filed
Civil Writ Petition No.1586/1982 with substantially the
same prayers. On 20.3.1997 that Writ Petition had been
dismissed as being devoid of merit in view of the Full
Bench decision in Roshanara Begum -vs- Union of India,
AIR 1996 Delhi 206 which came to be affirmed by the Apex
WP(C) 861/2002

Page 10 of 11

Court in Murari -vs- Union of India, (1997) 1 SCC 15.

The

only difference is that Mr. Ravinder Sethi had appeared for
the DDA instead of Petitioners. CW 78/1982 titled Shri
Laxmi Chand and Twelve Others -vs- Union of India came to
be dismissed for the same reasons on 9.5.1997. Shri Om
Prakash Tyagi and eight others also residents of the land
bearing the same Khasra Nos. have filed CW 1653/1984
titled Shri Om Prakash Tyagi and Eight Others -vs- Union of
India & Ors. which was decided in terms of Roshanara

Begum.

8.

Writ Petitions are totally devoid of merit and are

dismissed. All pending applications also stand disposed of.
We, however, refrain from imposing costs.
