1.

The plaintiff has filed a suit for damages and injunction
arising out of a contract between the plaintiff and
defendant

no.1

Metallurgical

for

Coke

purchase
for

of

13,000

manufacture

of

MTs
Pig

of

Iron.

Defendant no.2 is the carrier of the consignment.
2.

The plaintiff claims to be engaged in the business of
manufacture of Pig Iron, having its plant at Shiroda,

a

corporation

incorporated under the law of Republic of China carrying
on commercial business of import and export of mineral
products. Defendant no.1 through its agent submitted
offers dated 29.4.1993 and 4.5.1993 to the plaintiff for
supply of Metallurgical Coke and order was placed for
13,000 MTs @ US Dollars 81.5 per MT CIF which was
accepted by defendant no.1 vide letter dated 10.5.1993.
The plaintiff accordingly opened a Letter of Credit in
terms of the purchase order for US Dollars 10,59,500 +/5%. The date of shipment was 23.7.1993. The purchase
order required the payment to be made to the extent of
95% within 21 days of the date of the Bill of Lading and
the balance 5% to be based on test results at discharge
port.
3.

It is the case of the plaintiff that defendant no.1 failed to
deliver the contracted goods within time and the Letter
of Credit had to be amended on three occasions at the
request of defendant no.1.

The goods were finally

shipped under the Bill of Lading dated 15.9.1993 issued
by defendant no.2, the carrier.
4.

The vessel, M V Lok Vikas, carrying the consignment

CC 387/95 in  CSOS 2839/93

Page 2 /17

arrived at Redi Port in the State of Maharashtra on
7.10.1993 but the goods could not be discharged due to
non-availability of original documents with the plaintiff's
banker, State Bank of Hyderabad. It is stated that the
negotiating bank, the Barclays' Bank, PLC, Singapore,
pointed out certain discrepancies in the documents
presented for negotiations by defendant no.1 but in
order to avoid any delay, the plaintiff authorised the
Barclays' Bank to negotiate the documents in spite of
the discrepancies pointed out and without prejudice to
the plaintiff's right to claim damages.

The matter did

not end at this since further discrepancies were pointed
out by the Barclays' Bank, PLC, Singapore but the
plaintiff once again sorted out the discrepancies.
5.

In view of the fact that the relevant documents were not
available and the plaintiff was desirous of discharge of
the consignment, the plaintiff furnished a Letter of
Indemnity dated 7.10.1993 to defendant no.2 to start
discharge of the cargo at the port. It is in pursuance to
this indemnity that defendant no.2 in good faith stated
to have started discharge of the consignment on
11.10.1993.

The total consignment discharged was to

the tune of 5030 MTs.

CC 387/95 in  CSOS 2839/93

Page 3 /17

6.

The plaintiff claimed that in terms of the purchase order,
it got the discharge material inspected and tested by
SGS India Limited, an independent agency, which found
that the specifications of the goods shipped varied from
the contracted verifications.

The plaintiff also called

upon defendant no.1 to depute their technical staff to
check the exact quality of the goods received.

The

plaintiff claimed that even defendant no.1 agreed to
take a joint sample with the plaintiff and get the same
analysed from an independent agency, but apparently
no such agreement over an independent agency could
be arrived at. The plaintiff claimed that defendant no.1
has committed a breach of the agreement. The plaintiff
volunteered to lift the balance cargo after an analysis by
an independent international reputed analyst.

The

plaintiff claimed right of rebate in view of the goods
being of inferior quality which it was willing to pay to
defendant no.1 minus the demurrage and other costs
payable to defendant no.2.
7.

The plaintiff prayed for a decree of damages of over
Rs.1.00 crore being the amount of damage for goods
taken delivery of (in the suit the claim is of delivery of
4823.71 MTs which it transpired subsequently was 5030

CC 387/95 in  CSOS 2839/93

Page 4 /17

MTs as per affidavit of evidence of the plaintiff).

The

plaintiff also sought a mandatory injunction for delivery
of the balance goods.
8.

The defendants were served and both the defendants
put in appearance. It, however, appears that defendant
no.1 did not file any written statement and was
ultimately proceeded ex parte on 23.1.1995.

9.

In the meantime, certain developments took place
inasmuch as defendant no.2, the carrier, moved an
application seeking discharge of the cargo from the
vessel on account of the accumulating demurrage and
the ship being stationed on the port on account of failure
of discharge of the consignment. This application, after
notice to the other parties, was allowed on 16.3.1994
with the direction to defendant no.2 to keep the goods in
safe custody after such discharge. This was followed up
by another order dated 14.7.1994 whereby the goods
were permitted to be sold by public auction. This was so
on account of strong monsoon winds, heavy showers
and storms, which was causing damage to the goods
both as regards quantity and quality. The goods were
actually sold thereafter by public auction and it is stated
that the proceeds for 7593 MTs sold (as per affidavit of

CC 387/95 in  CSOS 2839/93

Page 5 /17

evidence) amounting to Rs.1.60 crores were deposited in
this Court and are lying in the form of an FDR. This is
also recorded in the order dated 25.10.1994. Defendant
no.2 also filed a counter claim arising from the
demurrage and other charges both on account of
detention of the vessel as also the storage of the goods.
10.

A further development which took place was that
defendant no.1 initiated arbitration proceedings against
defendant

no.2

arising

out

of

the

Charter

Party

Agreement. The vessel of defendant no.2 was detained
in China on account of the claim of defendant no.1 for
the goods which had been shipped. These disputes gave
rise

to

a

settlement

(Ex.D2W1/113B).

agreement

dated

6.12.1995

The settlement agreement records

that disputes had arisen between the defendants inter
se as to the liability for the delivery of the cargo and for
demurrage and

detention

cost.

In

view

of

the

settlement, defendant no.2 paid to defendant no.1 a
sum of US Dollars 6,00,000.00 in full and final settlement
of all and any claims between them in respect of the
consignment.

The

settlement

also

records

that

defendant no.1 had agreed to consign to defendant no.2
unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably any and all

CC 387/95 in  CSOS 2839/93

Page 6 /17

rights and interests of defendant no.1 in the cargo or the
proceeds of sale thereof and any rights of defendant
no.1 against the plaintiff. The result was that defendant
no.2 really stepped into the shoes of defendant no.1 in
pursuance to this settlement.
11.

The plaintiff and defendant no.2 both subsequently
amended their plaint and counter claim.

The plaintiff

failed to file the reply to the amended counter claim and,
in fact, stopped appearing thereafter.

The result was

that the suit of the plaintiff was dismissed on 24.8.2006.
It is, thus, only the counter claim of defendant no.2
which has to be adjudicated.
12.

Defendant no.2, in order to prove its case, has examined
only

one

witness,

Mr.Shrinivas

Bhaskar,

General

Manager Bulk Carrier Commercial, who has exhibited his
affidavit at Ex.D2W1/A. The said witness has affirmed to
what is stated in the affidavit and has approved what is
written in the counter claim.
13.

In the nutshell, the counter-claim of defendant no.2,
which is liable to adjudicated, arises from the CIF value
of 5030 MTs goods discharged on the indemnity of the
plaintiff as also the auction proceeds realized from the
sale of the balance amount. The CIF value of the goods

CC 387/95 in  CSOS 2839/93

Page 7 /17

discharged

is

stated

in

the

affidavit

to

be

Rs.1,28,59,975/-. It may be noted that for the balance
cargo which was sold in auction, the CIF value is stated
to be more than the value realized from the auction but
the claim is restricted to the value obtained in auction.
Apart from this, defendant no.2 seeks to recover the
demurrage and other expenses when the ship remained
standing at the port on account of failure to discharge
the goods as also for other incidental expenses.
14.

The matter does not end at this since it is the case of
plaintiff that defendant no.2 suffered on account of the
detention of its vessel in China, such detention being at
the behest of defendant no.1, as also the cost for getting
the vessel released by furnishing a bank guarantee and
the cost of the arbitral proceedings. This liability is also
sought to be fastened on the plaintiff on the basis that
there were really no disputes inter se the defendants
except in respect of the discharge of the goods and the
detention of the goods. Thus, in pursuance to the
settlement between the defendants and the arbitral
proceedings, defendant no.2 is liable to claim the
amount payable to defendant no.1 for which the
counter-claim also stands amended.

15.

In order to support the aforesaid plea, a copy of the
indemnity bond (Ex.D2W1/119) is sought to be relied
upon. It is the case of defendant no.2 that the original of
this bond was taken by the plaintiff for counter signature
by their bankers, but were never returned. It would be
necessary to reproduce the terms of the indemnity bond
dated 7.10.1993, which are reproduced hereinbelow:
“To,
The Shipping Corporation of India Limited,
Goa (India).
-----------------The owners of the S.S./M.V. Lok Vikas.
Goods:
No.12621 MT
Description: Low Ash Metallurgical Coke in Bulk.

We hereby request you to deliver such goods to

In consideration of your complying with our

our request.
2. In the event of any proceedings being

6. This indemnity shall be construed in
accordance with Indian Law and each and
every person liable under this indemnity shall
at your request submit to the jurisdiction of
the High Court of Justice of Indian. (This
clause may be amended to show another
jurisdiction where appropriate).
Yours faithfully,
for and on behalf of
USHA ISPAT LIMITED
FOR USHAL ISPAT LIMITED
Sd/Authorised Signatory
Place: New Delhi
Date: Oct. 7, 1993.”

16.

A reading of the aforesaid indemnity bond shows that it
is comprehensive and covers all the consequences of
release of consignment to the plaintiff. This indemnity
bond is not disputed and, in fact, admitted in the plaint
(para 11). The clauses of the indemnity bond also show

CC 387/95 in  CSOS 2839/93

Page 10 /17

that the plaintiff has made itself liable even for the
detention of any other vessel of defendant no.2 arising
from such discharge of the consignment as well as for
any legal proceedings which may arise therefrom.
17.

In view of the aforesaid, it is apparent that the case of
the plaintiff rested on the quality of the goods not being
of the requisite level as per the purchase order and,
therefore, it was for the plaintiff to establish the same.
The plaintiff, however, stopped prosecuting the suit or
defending the counter-claim with the result that such a
claim of the plaintiff remains unproved. If such case is
unproved then it was the obligation of the plaintiff to
have honored the documents and taken delivery of the
goods.

If there was a delay in delivery of the goods,

defendant no.2 certainly cannot be held responsible for
the same and the carrier must be compensated for all
losses and expenses in respect thereof.

The only

question, thus, to be determined is as to what is the
amount which would be liable to be paid to defendant
no.2 as carrier.
18.

In order to determine the aforesaid, the settlement
between defendant no.1 and defendant no.2 has also to
be taken into account which would show that it is

CC 387/95 in  CSOS 2839/93

Page 11 /17

defendant no.2 which is liable to recover the value of the
consignment. Defendant no.2 having satisfied the claim
of defendant no.1, defendant no.2 has stepped into the
shoes of defendant no.1. Defendant no.2 has also filed a
counter-claim for all the claims in respect thereof.
19.

Insofar as the goods which were discharged at the port
and not paid for, there can be little doubt that the CIF
value of these goods being 5030 MTs would be liable to
be paid by the plaintiff, amounting to Rs.1,28,59,975/-.
The plaintiff never took delivery of the remaining goods.
Such goods were sold by auction. Defendant no.2 has
satisfied the claim of defendant no.1 in this behalf. The
value realized from the auction is less than the CIF value
and only that amount has been claimed.

Thus, the

realized value of Rs.1.60 crores is liable to be released to
defendant no.2 along with interest accrued thereon by
discharge of the FDR on maturity.
20.

It is, however, seen that undisputably defendant no.2
has settled the claim of defendant no.1 for the sum of
US Dollars 6,00,000.00, quantified as equivalent to
Rs.2,17,17,000/- as on the date of payment.

Thus,

defendant no.2 has been able to settle the claim of
defendant no.1 at a lesser amount and that being the

CC 387/95 in  CSOS 2839/93

Page 12 /17

amount which would have been the liability of the
plaintiff

to defendant

no.1,

it is this amount

of

Rs.2,17,17,000/- which would be liable to be paid instead
of

the

alternative

claim

of

Rs.1,28,59,975/-

plus

Rs.1,60,00,000/-, equivalent to Rs.2,88,59,975/-.
21.

In the affidavit of Mr.Shrinivas Bhaskar (Ex.D2W1/A) the
other amounts have been specified in para-29 as under:
“29. I state that SCI has suffered damages and
losses and/or have incurred expenses as under:
(i) ....
(ii)....
(iii)The expenses incurred after suspension of
the discharge operation at Port Redi till
completion of Auction at Marmagoa including
storage charges upto auctioning of cargo till
30.9.94 Rs.49,72,112/-.
(iv)I submit that since Usha Ispat by Dishonest
means taken delivery of part cargo (5030
MT) without paying for the value, in
retaliation Minmetal arrested SCI's vessel
“M.V. Lok Priti” at Qingdao (China) and she
was detained by the Authorities from 31.3.94
to 9.4.94 till her release after executing the
bank guarantee by SCI for the detention of 9
days SCI suffered a loss of Rs.21,17,475/-.
(v)Costs, charges and expenses paid by SCI to
State Bank of India with respect to furnishing
of a Bank Guarantee for 1.2 million dollars to
the Chinese Court for the period 6.4.94 to
22.4.96 amounting to Rs.20,67,837.00.
(vi)The costs, charges and expenses incurred
by SCI for defending the proceedings in
Chinese Court and for proceeding with the
Arbitration
proceedings
in
Hongkong
amounting to Rs.63,93,104.50.

CC 387/95 in  CSOS 2839/93

Page 13 /17

(vii)Demurrage incurred by the vessel while
waiting at the Port of Redi/Marmagoa during
the period of suspension of discharge i.e.
From 22.10.93 to 19.4.94 (179 days approx)
at the rate of U.S. $ 4500 per day aggregate
to US $ 805000 equivalent to Indian
Rs.2,52,68,535.00
@
exchange
rate
Rs.31.37). In the alternative in any event SCI
is entitled to recover the standing costs,
charges and expenses incurred by SCI in
maintaining the said vessel and in keeping
the said vessel safely afloat during the
aforesaid
period
amounting
to
Rs.1,73,38,969.25.
(viii)Costs expenses and charges incurred by
SCI in relation to diversion of the said vessel
from Port Redi to Port Marmagoa for
providing bunkers amounting to Rs.1,45,254.
(ix)Costs, charges and expenses incurred in
auctioning the cargo as per orders passed by
this Hon'ble Court Rs.98,910/-.”

22.

It may, however, be noticed from the aforesaid that in
respect of clause (vii) of para-29, there is an alternative
relief claimed. In my considered view, what defendant
no.2 would be entitled to would be the actual expenses
incurred in keeping the shipping afloat during the
interregnum period of time which is Rs.1,73,38,969.25.

23.

It is pertinent to mention that the above claims in
respect of the full and final settlement of the claims of
Minmetals have been proved by defendant No.2 through
exhibited
