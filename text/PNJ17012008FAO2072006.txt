PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Heard.

2.

Appellant is aggrieved by the order dated 28.4.2006

returning the plaint holding that Courts at Delhi had no
territorial jurisdiction to entertain the plaint.
3.

Reason for holding that Courts at Delhi have no

territorial jurisdiction is that the works executed in respect
whereof payment is claimed in the plaint were at Jhansi. The
tenders were submitted at Jhansi.

The acceptance of the

tenders was at Jhansi. That the works were executed at Jhansi.

dealt

whereto

with

the

territorial

jurisdiction was pleaded, is the grievance urged in the instant
appeal.
5.

In the plaint, in para 9 a specific averment has been

made as under :“Moreover the part payments in respect of the
afore-said works executed by the plaintiff
under the various work orders, have been
made by the defendant to the plaintiff vide
various bank drafts payable at Delhi and part
of cause of action has arisen in Delhi.”
6.

The impugned order has not discussed the issue

whether payment is a part of cause of action and whether
place where payment has to be received or was being received
would therefore be the place where part of cause of action has
accrued.
7.

I need not note a large number of authorities which

hold that payment for work done is a part of cause of action
and place where payments were being made or were required
to be made would be relevant to determine territorial
jurisdiction.
8.

One such authority on the point is reported as 90

(2001) DLT 386 K.S.Wahi Vs. M/s. Ganga Exports & Ors.

Vinay Engineering Enterprises and 1994 4 SCC 711 ONGC Vs.
Utpal K. Basu.
10.

The decision in South East Asia Shipping Co.'s case

dealt with the issue whether place where bank guarantee is
issued would be a place where part of cause of action arises. It
has been held that issuance of a bank guarantee under a
contract is not part of cause of action and hence territorial
jurisdiction cannot be determined with reference to the place
where bank guarantee was issued.
11.

The decision is clearly distinguishable.

12.

In the decision in Aligarh Muslim University's case

Hon'ble Supreme Court noted that Calcutta High Court had
assumed jurisdiction with respect to the residence of the
plaintiff. It was found to be faulty.
13.

The decision does not deal with the issue which has

arisen for consideration in the instant appeal, namely that,
whether place where payment was made would confer
territorial jurisdiction.
14.

Decision in ONGC's case pertained to the exercise of

jurisdiction in a writ proceedings and on facts it was held that
no part of cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction
Page 3 of 4

of the Calcutta High Court. The decision holds that a dispute
on facts must form an integral part of the cause of action and
some thing which is incidental would not be a part of cause of
action.
15.

The decision did not deal with the issue whether

place where payment was being tendered would be the place
where part of cause of action would accrue to a party.
16.

Having noted the averment in the plaint pertaining

to place of payment and the decision in K.S.Wahi's case the
appeal has to be allowed.
17.

Ordered accordingly.

18.

The appeal is allowed. Impugned order dated

28.4.2006 is quashed.
19.

Learned Trial Judge is directed to proceed with the

plaint in accordance with law.
20.

No costs.

21.

Parties are directed to appear before the learned

Trial Judge on 25.2.2008.
