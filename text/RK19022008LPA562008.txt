DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ. (ORAL)

1.

This appeal is directed against the order dated 09.11.2006

passed by the learned Single Judge on the writ petition filed by the
respondent whereby the award passed by the Tribunal was set
aside.
2.

The appellant herein was working as a driver with the

respondent Corporation. He absented himself from duties without
any intimation to the respondent and also without filing any leave
application in April, 1988. His whereabouts were not known from
1988 to 1998 for long ten years. In the meantime, the Management
wrote several letters to him asking him to join, but despite such
LPA 54/2008

Page 1 of 4

letters the appellant did not join the service of the respondent
Corporation.

In the letter written by the respondent dated

08.07.1988, it was specifically stated that no leave could be granted
to the appellant beyond three months and that if he does not
report for duty, he would be considered to have resigned. Despite
the aforesaid letter dated 08.07.1988, the appellant did not send
any intimation nor submitted any leave application. Consequently,
an order was passed by the respondent on 28.07.1988 declaring
that the appellant was deemed to have resigned from service.
After ten years of time, the appellant suddenly woke up to submit
an application to allow him to join the duty and for restoring his
previous job, contending that he had been kidnapped. However,
in support of the same, he could not place any documentary
evidence or any letter supporting the fact that any FIR was lodged.
The appellant submitted a request to the appropriate Government
for referring a dispute, which was referred in the following terms:
“Whether the punishment inflicted upon Shri Dharam
Pal by the management vide its order dated 28.7.1988
is illegal and/or unjustified and if so, to what relief is he
entitled and what directions are necessary in this
respect?”
3.

The Tribunal, however, passed an award holding that the

invocation of the provisions of Clause 14(10)(c) of the D.R.T.A.
(Conditions of Appointment and Service) Regulations, 1952 by the
respondent was bad as the said provisions have been held to be
ultra vires the Constitution by the Delhi High Court in the case of
LPA 54/2008

Page 2 of 4

D.T.C. vs. Om Kumar & Ors. in WP(C) No.4231/97. The respondent
being aggrieved filed a writ petition against the aforesaid award
passed by the Tribunal. The learned Single Judge before whom the
writ petition was filed considered the contentions raised and on
going through the records held that the appellant had made
representations giving false and vague stories and that in two
different representations he had given two different stories. Learned
Single Judge also found that the appellant had knowledge that his
services had been terminated on 27.07.1988, but still he did not
approach any labour authority against the termination of his service
and that for the first time he made such a representation on
11.03.1998 only.

The reference was made sometime in the year

2000 by the appropriate Government.

The appellant never

attended duties from 17.04.1988 for long ten years and an
application was filed to allow him to join duties after long ten years.
The reason given by him for his absence was also found to be false
and vague by the learned Single Judge and, therefore, there was
clearly abandonment of service by the appellant. In that view of
the matter, the learned Industrial Adjudicator could not have
directed for his reinstatement in service with full back wages.
4.

The claim of the appellant for reinstatement itself, in our

considered opinion, was barred by the principle of laches and
inordinate delay and, therefore, the impugned order calls for no
interference. It was submitted by the counsel appearing for the
LPA 54/2008

Page 3 of 4

appellant that reference having been made by the appropriate
Government to the Labour Court, the said reference could not have
been dismissed by the learned Single Judge on the ground of delay
and laches. In our considered opinion, the aforesaid submission is
also without any merit, for, while allowing the writ petition the
learned Single Judge has referred to and relied upon the decisions
of the Supreme Court in Asstt. Engineer, CAD, Kota and Dhan
Kunwar 2006 (3) LLJ (12) and also the decision in The Nedungadi
Bank Ltd. vs. K.P. Madhavankutty and Ors. AIR 2000 SC 839.
5.

We may also refer to the decisions of the Supreme Court in

Viveka Nand Sethi vs. Chairman, J&K Bank Ltd. and Ors. (2005) 5
SCC 337, Syndicate Bank vs. General Secretary, Syndicate Bank
Staff Association and Anr. 2000 SCC (L&S) 601 and Chief Engineer
(Construction) vs. Keshava Rao (Dead) by Lrs. 2005 SCC (L&S) 872,
wherein also the Supreme Court has held that a workman who has
not reported for duty and thereafter approaches after long delay
for reinstatement should not be given relief. We, therefore, find no
merit in this appeal.

LPA 56/2008 and CM Nos.1858-59/2008 are

accordingly dismissed.
