PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
Petitioner lays a challenge

to

the

order

dated

29.10.2004 passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate
refusing to drop proceedings initiated by the MCD against the
petitioner under Sections 347/461 of the DMC Act, 1957. Further
challenge is laid to the order dated 10.5.2005 passed by the
learned ASJ, Delhi dismissing the revision petition filed by the
petitioner challenging the order dated 29.10.2004 passed by the

learned Metropolitan Magistrate.
2.

A two fold contention has been urged by learned

counsel for the petitioner. Firstly, in view of Section 300 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, since petitioner was tried for
same offence and was acquitted by Shri Brijesh Sethi, then
learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi, petitioner could not be
prosecuted for a second time for the same offence.

Second

contention urged is that the learned Revisional Court failed to
apply its mind to the issue raised evidenced by the fact that after
noting the contention of the petitioner, save and except
reproducing the operative part of the order passed by the learned
Metropolitan

Magistrate,

the

Revisional

Court

has

not

independently applied its mind.
3.

Property No.F-15, Preet Vihar, New Delhi is admittedly

in a residential colony. Land use of the plot on which the building
is constructed is residential.
Development

Act

1957,

Under Section 29 of the Delhi

Delhi

Development

Authority

is

empowered to prosecute a person found guilty of violating the
land use as prescribed under the Master Plan or the Zonal
Development Plan.
4.

In the year 1994, DDA had prosecuted the petitioner

for violating Section 29 of the Delhi Development Act in respect of

the property in question. As per the complaint filed by DDA,
inspection carried out by its staff on 18.8.1993 had revealed a
misuse of the property.
5.

Vide order dated 18.9.1998, petitioner was acquitted.

6.

The order dated 18.9.1998 passed by the learned

Metropolitan Magistrate shows that the testimony of the Junior
Engineer of DDA was disbelieved.
7.

Instant

complaint

has

been

filed

by

Municipal

Corporation of Delhi alleging violation of Section 347 of the DMC
Act, 1957 which stipulates that no person shall put to use a
property for a purpose other than for which plans were got
sanctioned. It is alleged in the complaint that on 8.11.2002 the
Junior Engineer who had visited the property at 11:00 AM had
noted a complete change of user from residential to commercial,
commercial activity being running of the hospital.
8.

Suffice would it be to note that prosecution by DDA

commenced with an inspection carried out on 18.8.1993. Instant
prosecution relates to an inspection conducted on 8.11.2002.
9.

I fail to understand as to how Section 300 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is attracted. A person who is alleged
to be misusing a property in the year 1993, on being acquitted
can certainly be prosecuted for misuse of the property but only

where the misuse alleged is pursuant to a distinct and an
independent inspection. Only then would it be a case of a person
not being tried for the same offence.
10.

In respect of the second contention urged by learned

counsel for the petitioner, suffice would it be to state that where
the Appellate or the Revisional court concurs with the reasoning of
the learned Trial Judge, it is sufficient to broadly indicate the
reasons for concurrence. I find nothing wrong in the Revisional
Court quoting the discussion on the subject from the order of the
learned Trial Judge and thereafter briefly recording that it concurs
with the reasoning of the learned Trial Judge.
11.

I find no merits in the petition.

12.

The petition is dismissed.
