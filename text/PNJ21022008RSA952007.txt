PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Appellant,

a

lawyer

by

profession,

seeks

to

challenge the order dated 1.12.2006 refusing to condone the
delay of 297 days in filing the first appeal.
2.

The appeal laid a challenge to a judgment and

decree dated 10.3.2005 passed by the learned Trial Judge in
Suit No.1952/2001.
3.

In the application seeking delay to be condoned in

filing the appeal, it was inter alia stated that the impugned
judgment and decree dated 10.3.2005 was contrary to an

RSA No.95/07

page 1 of 5

award dated 26.9.2004 passed by a competent Lok Adalat on
the same cause and that the appellant thought that the
conflict between the award passed by the Lok Adalat and the
decree could be corrected by way of a petition under Article
227 of the Constitution of India which was filed in this court
praying that in view of the award dated 26.9.2004 passed by
the Lok Adalat on the same subject matter, the decree dated
10.3.2005 be set aside.

It was further stated that the said

petition filed in Delhi High Court was dismissed on 12.1.2006
for the reason appellant had a remedy of appeal. Accordingly,
it was stated that thereafter the appeal was filed.
4.

I note that the appeal has been filed on 1.2.2006.

5.

Reason given by the learned Additional District

Judge is that the appellant who is a lawyer could not have been
misguided by the interim order dated 26.9.2004 passed by the
Lok Adalat and could not treat the said interim order as an
award.

I note that the order dated 26.9.2004 concludes as

under :“In case this is not settled as above then this
matter be placed before the next Lok Adalat.”
6.

The earlier part of the order is in the nature of a

recommendation

for

both

the parties to consider the

suggestion of the Lok Adalat so that the dispute could be

RSA No.95/07

page 2 of 5

amicably resolved.

It is apparent that the order dated

26.9.2004 is not a conclusive settlement of the dispute before
the Lok Adalat.
7.

It has further to be noted that after the

suit was

dismissed on 10.3.2005, appellant went back to the Lok Adalat
with a grievance that the decree in the suit was at variance
with the order dated 26.9.2004. On 29.5.2005, the Lok Adalat
recorded that its order dated 26.9.2004 was an interim order
and since the suit was dismissed, the Lok Adalat could pass no
directions.
8.

Whatever may have been the misconception in the

mind of the appellant viz-a-viz the nature of the order dated
26.9.2004 passed by the Lok Adalat, same ought to have come
to a rest when order dated 29.5.2005 was passed.

Inspite

thereof, appellant chose to still persist with a wrong stand that
the interim order dated 26.9.2004 passed by the Lok Adalat
was a final award.
9.

I reiterate that the appellant is a lawyer of

substantial standing and he cannot be misled by the tenor or
purport of the orders passed.
10.

Notwithstanding the order dated 29.5.2005 passed

by the Lok Adalat recording that its earlier order dated
26.9.2004 was not an award but was an interim order, the
RSA No.95/07

page 3 of 5

appellant still persisted by filing a petition under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India in this court. The petition was filed
after 7 months of the order dated 29.5.2005 passed by the Lok
Adalat. As noted above, the petition was filed in the month of
January,2006 and was listed for preliminary hearing on
12.1.2006, on which date it was dismissed.
11.

Under the circumstances, it cannot be held that the

appellant was bonafide misled by the order dated 26.9.2004
passed by the Lok Adalat and that delay of 297 days in filing
the appeal should be condoned.

At best, the bonafide belief

of the appellant pertaining to interim order dated 26.9.2004
passed by the Lok Adalat came to an end when the Lok Adalat
passed order dated 29.5.2005 recording that its earlier order
dated 26.9.2004 was an interim order.
12.

I note that on 30.3.2007, following two substantial

questions of law have been framed :“1. Whether the appellant did not have
sufficient ground for condonation of delay and
whether the appeal filed by him is barred by
time before the First Appellate Court?
2.
Whether the Trial Court was competent
to pass a decree on the subject matter of the
suit after an award had already been passed
by a competent Lok Adalat after recording
the agreement between the parties and
settled the matter finally?”
13.

With due respect to the learned Judge who has

RSA No.95/07

page 4 of 5

framed the questions of law on 30.3.2007, I beg to differ on the
second question framed for the reason it relates to the merits
of the decision of the learned Trial Judge. The said question of
law cannot arise for consideration

in the instant appeal for

the reason the second appeal lays a challenge to an order
passed by the learned First Appellate Court declining delay to
be condoned in filing the first appeal and as a consequence
dismissing the first appeal as not maintainable. The only issue
before this court is whether the Appellate Court was justified
in not condoning the delay in filing the appeal beyond
limitation.
14.

I hold that on the material on record the learned

Appellate Judge has correctly opined that no sufficient cause
was shown to have the delay condoned in filing the appeal.
15.

The instant appeal is dismissed.

16.

No costs.
