who made an offer to mill 10,000 M.T. of Paddy into rice as per
the petitioner's specifications vide its offer received by the
petitioner on 16.02.1995. The offer was accepted by the
petitioner and the written agreement dated 24.02.1995 was
executed between the parties whereby the respondent agreed
to mill

10,000 M.T. of Paddy into rice in three phases as

The

1/3rd by the end of March, 1995
1/3rd by the end of April, 1995 and
1/3rd by the end of May, 1995
respondent allegedly did not mill the Paddy of the

petitioner lying at the Hemda Open Complex, Karnal and the
Paddy brought at Taraori which was a part of the contract
between the parties. The petitioner is alleged to had suffered a
loss of Rs. 2,52,86,402/- due to non-performance of the
contract by the respondent.

The agreement dated 24.02.1995 executed between the

parties contained an arbitration clause being Clause 22 by
which the parties agreed to refer their disputes and differences
that might arise between them under the contract for
arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the Indian Council of
Arbitration. It was agreed upon between the parties that the
award in pursuance of the said agreement between them shall

be binding on the parties.

The disputes under the agreement dated 24.02.1995 that

arose between the parties were referred for arbitration by the
Indian Council of Arbitration to a panel of three arbitrators
presided by Hon'ble Mr. Justice N.N. Goswami, a former Judge
of this Court with Mr. N.K. Verma and Mr. Sarwamitter as
members of the Arbitral Tribunal. The petitioner made a claim
of Rs. 2,52,86,402/- against the respondent on account of
alleged loss suffered by it due to breach on the part of the
respondent in not milling the Paddy in terms of agreement
dated 24.02.1995. The respondent also filed a counter claim of
Rs. 53,13,365.51 paise before the Arbitral Tribunal. The Arbitral
Tribunal vide its award dated 12.08.1999 dismissed the claim
as well as the counter claim of the parties. Aggrieved
therefrom the petitioner has filed the objections under Section
34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 whereas the
respondent has not filed any objections against the said award.

The arbitral award dated 12.08.1999 is sought to be

challenged by the petitioner inter-alia on the following
grounds:(i)The award is a non-speaking award and therefore it is
contrary to the terms of the Arbitration Agreement contained
OMP No. 368/1999

Page 3 of 7

in clause 22 of the Agreement which specifically provides
that the panel of arbitrators shall give a speaking award.
(ii)The award is bad in law because the Arbitral Tribunal has
not returned any findings on issues No. 5 to 7.
(iii)The award is opposed to public policy because of judicial
misconduct on the part of the arbitrators in ignoring the
letter dated 15.03.1995 (Annexure P-5 to the petition)
written by the respondent No. 1 to the petitioner informing
that it was ready to mill 4100 M.Ts. Paddy lying at Hemda
Open Complex Karnal provided it was supplied at their mill at
Taraori.
(iv) The Arbitral Tribunal has failed to take into account that
the time was the essence of the contract and since the

respondent No. 1 had failed to mill the paddy in terms of
agreement dated 24.02.1995, there was clear breach on the
part of the respondent No. 1.

I have gone through the contents of the award and have

also given my thoughtful consideration to the arguments
advanced by the counsel for the parties in the light of the
material available on record.
8

There is absolutely no merit in the contention of the

counsel for the petitioner that the award under reference is a
non-speaking award. The Arbitral Tribunal has given cogent

OMP No. 368/1999

Page 4 of 7

reasons in its award for rejecting the claim of the petitioner.
The relevant portion of the award is reproduced hereinbelow:“There is no material on record to show that
this stand of the respondents was ever questioned
by the claimants. Therefore, we have to accept that
the quality of Paddy was not in accordance with the
specifications and as such was rightly rejected.
Further there is also no dispute that the Paddy
brought to the mill premises has already been
accounted for though a portion of which was milled
little later for which no grievance was made.
Now coming to the legal question, the
respondents had admittedly informed the claimants
in March, 1995 that the Paddy was of inferior quality
and as such no further stock should be sent for
milling. No reply to that letter was sent by the
claimant and no effort was made to send any
further Paddy. this leads us to the conclusion that
the claimants accepted the stand of the
respondents. In any case Clause XIV of the contract
clearly states that the Corporation/Claimant could
get the work executed at Miller's risk. The contract
does not contemplate that the Paddy could be sold
at such a late stage and Miller could be held liable
for the same. Assuming that the respondents had
wrongly refused to Mill the Paddy, it was open to
the claimants to have it milled from another miller
and loss if any could be claimed from the
respondents. Admittedly there were number of
other Mills in the same area, but no effort was made
to get the Paddy milled. At the request of counsel
for the claimants a further opportunity was given to
show if any effort was made to get the Paddy
milled. The claimants along with further affidavit
filed a tender notice which was issued for the next
year and not for the Paddy in question. The Paddy
was kept in the open for more than 21 months and
sold thereafter. It is the concerned official/officials
of the claimants who are answerable and not the
respondents.

For the reasons recorded above, the claimants
have failed to prove their claims and the same is
dismissed in toto.”
A bare reading of the above would show that the Arbitral

Tribunal has rightly rejected the claim of the petitioner on
account of loss allegedly suffered by it because of alleged
breach on the part of the respondent No. 1. No fault can be
found with the reasoning of the Arbitral Tribunal referred
hereinabove. The reliance placed by the petitioner on letter of

respondent No. 1 dated 15.03.1995 is of no consequence.
The counsel for the petitioner has failed to show as to how the
award given by the Arbitral Tribunal in the present case can be
said to be opposed to public policy. The learned counsel for the
petitioner did not point out any defect or irregularity in the
procedure followed by the Arbitral Tribunal in adjudicating the
disputes between the parties. The award is in accordance with
the terms of the Arbitration Agreement between the parties.
This Court can neither reappreciate the evidence nor sit in
appeal over the judgment of the Arbitral Tribunal and
substitute its own opinion in place of that of Arbitral Tribunal.
The objections against the award preferred by the petitioner do
not fall within the parameters of section 34 of the Arbitration

OMP No. 368/1999

and Conciliation Act, 1996.
10

In view of the above, this petition fails and is hereby

dismissed with no orders as to costs.
