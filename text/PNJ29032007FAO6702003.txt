1.

Only issue urged by the insurance company was that

the driving licence of the driver was a fake licence and hence
there was a violation of the policy of insurance by the insured.
Hence, impugned award is liable to be set aside insofar it fixes
liability on the appellant to satisfy the same.
FAO No.670/03

2.

Date of the accident is 23.4.1994.

Evidence on

record which has been discussed by the learned Judge, MACT is
as per para 13 of the award. The said para reads as under:“13.
The next question arises as to from whom
the petitioners are entitled to receive the said
amount of compensation. The counsel for R-3 in this
regard has contended that the driving licence of R-1
was not valid on the date of the accident and as
such it was violation of the terms of the insurance
policy and hence, the insurance company is not
liable to pay the said compensation. The said
contention on behalf of the R-3 is not tenable in view
of the fact that the RW5 has categorically stated
that the record of the driving licence is not traceable
as per Mall Road Transport Authority vide Ex.RW5/1
and Ex.R3W2/A.
The report of the Transport
Authority of North East Zone, Loni Road
categorically established that the driving licence of
the R-1 was valid up to 01.07.2001 and the date of
issue of the same was 02.07.1998. There is no
record available prior to 02.07.1998 and also on the
date of the accident.
However, the RW-1 has
specifically explained that the driving licence was
issued on 18.07.1993 vide No.C-9/910717 renewed
on 30.06.1998 and 19.06.1990. He has further
deposed that his licence is a valid up to 01.07.2001.
He has proved the copy of the driving licence as
Ex.RW1/1. He has further deposed (illegible) the
original driving licence was issued from Rajpur Road
Licensing Authority and was renewed from the same
Licensing Authority. Thereafter his driving licence
was lost and the said Rajpur Road Licensing
Authority issued the duplicate licence and it was
renewed thereafter from Loni Road Licensing
Authority on 02.07.1998. His evidence on record
remained unrebutted and there is no reason to
disbelive the RW1 so far as his driving licence is
concerned. Hence, the contention on behalf of R-3
that R-1 was not having a valid driving licence on
FAO No.670/03

3.

the date of the accident is hereby rejected and all
the respondents are held jointly and vicariously
liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners.”
It was urged by learned counsel for the appellant and

in support thereof, provisions of the M.V.Act 1988 (Section 14
and 15) were relied upon to make good the point that for a
heavy transport vehicle, licence issued is valid for 2 years and
therefore, in view of the dates of renewal, it is apparent that
there was something amiss.
4.

Issue is not that simple as projected by learned

counsel for the appellant. Decision of Supreme Court reported
as 2004 (3) SCC 297, National Insurance Company Ltd. vs.
Swaran Singh & Ors. has dealt with the issue in detail. In para
14 of the judgment it has been held that onus is on the
insurance company to prove that there has been a breach of a
specified condition of the policy.
5.

It is trite that a person would be duly licensed to drive

a motor vehicle if he holds a driving licence issued by the
competent authority and empowers the holder to drive a motor
vehicle of the category which was being driven at the time of
the accident.
6.

However in para 49 of the decision in Swaran Singh's

case it was held that if insurance company has to avoid liability
FAO No.670/03

page 3 of 10

under the policy it is required not only to show that the
conditions laid down in Section 149(2)(a) or (b) are satisfied,
but is further required to prove that there has been a breach on
the part of the insured.

Explaining the said legal position a

little further, in para 51 it was held that the insurer is to prove a
willful violation of the law by the assured. It was held that the
insurance company must establish that the owner acted
intentionally or so recklessly as to denote that the assured did
not care what the consequences of his act might be.
7.

Following observations from the decision of the

Supreme Court in the report published as 1987 (2) SCC 654,
Skandia Insurance Company vs. Kokilaben were extracted with
approval. The same is reproduced as under:“14.
Section 96(2)(b)(ii) extends immunity to
the insurance company if a breach is committed of
the condition excluding driving by a named person
or persons or by any person who is not duly
licensed, or by any person who has been
disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving
licence during the period of disqualification. The
expression 'breach' is of great significance. The
dictionary meaning of 'breach' is 'infringement or
violation of a promise or obligation' (see Collins
English Dictionary). It is therefore abundantly clear
that the insurer will have to establish that the
insured is guilty of an infringement or violation of a
promise that a person who is duly licensed will have
to be in charge of the vehicle. The very concept of
infringement or violation of the promise that the
FAO No.670/03

page 4 of 10

8.

expression 'breach' carries within itself induces an
inference that the violation or infringement on the
part of the promisor must be a willful infringement
or violation. If the insured is not at all at fault and
has not done anything he should not have done or
is not amiss in any respect how can it be
conscientiously posited that he has committed a
breach? It is only when the insured himself places
the vehicle in charge of a person who does not hold
a driving licence, that it can be said that he is
'guilty' of the breach of the promise that the vehicle
will be driven by a licensed driver. It must be
established by the insurance company that the
breach was on the part of the insured and that it
was insured who was guilty of violating the promise
or infringement of the contract. Unless the insured
is at fault and is guilty of a breach the insurer
cannot escape from the obligation to indemnify the
insured and successfully contend that he is
exonerated having regard to the fact that the
promisor (the insured) committed a breach of his
promise. Not when some mishap occurs by some
mischance. When the insured has done everything
within his power inasmuch as he has engaged a
licensed driver and has placed the vehicle in charge
of a licensed driver, with the express or implied
mandate to drive himself, it cannot be said that the
insured is guilty of any breach.”
In para 84 it was held that the insurance company

has to establish that the vehicle was allowed consciously to be
driven by the owner of the vehicle by a person not holding a
valid licence.
9.

In the summary of findings noted in para 110 it was

observed that the question, whether the owner has taken
reasonable care to find out as to whether the driving licence

FAO No.670/03

page 5 of 10

produced by the driver does not fulfill the requirement of law
will have to be determined in each case.
10.

Examining the evidence in the instant case it is to be

noted that the driver, Braham Prakash, was examined as RW-1.
He stated that the driving licence issued to him was bearing
No.C-9/8070056.

It was issued on 18.7.1993.

He further

stated that initial number when driving licence was issued was
C-9/910717. It was renewed on 30.6.1998 and 19.6.1990. He
stated that the licence was valid till 1.7.2001.
11.

R3W4, record keeper, from the Loni Road, Shahdara

Transport Authority stated that the driving licence was renewed
by the authority on the basis of the driver producing an earlier
driving licence bearing No.C-910787.

He further stated that

the earlier licence was issued by the licensing authority having
office at Mall Road and that record pertaining to the original
licence was destroyed.
12.

Submission

made

by

learned

counsel

for

the

appellant was that according to the driver, original licence
issued bore No.C-9/910717 and according to R3W4 original
licence bore No.C-9/910787. Thus, the licence relied upon was
a fake licence.

FAO No.670/03

page 6 of 10

13.

The owner of the vehicle was examined as R3W3. He

stated that he had employed the driver 2-3 months prior to the
accident and had seen the driving licence shown to him by the
driver.
14.

On the issue of the number of the original licence,

whether it was C-9/910717 as stated by the driver or whether it
was C-9/910787 as stated by R3W4, it is relevant to note that
RW-5, an employee of the Road Transport Authority, Mall Road
who had produced the driving licence verification report,
Ex.RW-5/1, stated that the report related to driving licence
No.C-910787 as also C-910717.
15.

Ex.RW5/1 records that the record of either number

was not traceable in the record of the Transport Authority.
16.

Whatever may be the licence number, fact of the

matter remains that on the basis of a driving licence issued on
18.7.1993 from the Mall Road office of the Road Transport
Authority, authorities at Loni Road office renewed the licence.
This shows, if not more, that the driver had produced a driving
licence before the authorities at Loni Road and based thereon,
the authority had renewed the licence.
17.

If the authority at Loni Road could not detect that the

FAO No.670/03

page 7 of 10

licence was a fake licence, assuming it was so, wherefrom
could the owner of the vehicle assume that it was a fake
licence?
18.

If the competent authority could be misled, so could

be the owner of the vehicle.

With the advancement of

technology, it has become impossible to distinguish between
original and the fake.
19.

Law does not enjoin upon the employer to verify the

authenticity of the licence produced by the person seeking
employment as a driver.

If, on the face of it, the licence

produced looks genuine, it would be sufficient discharge of
duty of care by the owner to verify the qualification of the
person proposed to be employed as a driver.
20.

In the teeth of the deposition of the owner of the

vehicle that he saw the driving licence produced by the driver,
to whom employment was given 2 to 3 months prior to the date
of the accident, the assured has sufficiently discharges the
onus on him to establish that he acted with reasonable care.
21.

In this connection, it would be relevant to note that

the owner who examined himself as R3W3 was not cross
examined by the insurance company. No questions were put to

FAO No.670/03

page 8 of 10

him in relation to his statement that he had seen the driving
licence possessed by the driver.
22.

Fact

of

the

destruction

of

the

original

record

pertaining to the licence issued in the year 1993 cannot be
used against the owner of the vehicle.
23.

Contention urged that a heavy duty vehicle licence is

valid for only 2 years and statement of the driver pertaining to
its renewal shows something hanky panky inasmuch as, as per
the statement of the driver, licence was renewed beyond 2
years needs to be noted and rejected for the simple reason
under the M.V.Act 1988 an expired licence can be renewed
within up to 5 years of date of expiry with the qualification that
it would be an effective licence with effect from the date of
renewal.
24.

The possibility of the driver renewing the licence

renewed after 30 days of the expiry but within 5 years thereof
cannot be ruled out.

In any case, accident in question took

place on 23.4.1994. Licence issued for the first time as relied
upon was issued on 18.7.1993. Said licence would be in any
case valid and effective for a period of 2 years.
25.

I do not find any infirmity in the impugned award.
