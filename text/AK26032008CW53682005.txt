ANIL KUMAR, J.
CM No.641/2007
1.

This is an application by the respondent applicant under Section

17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The applicant has contended
that by award dated 11th March, 2004 the respondent was directed to
be reinstated with continuity in service along with 25% back wages.

2.

The plea of the respondent applicant is that he is out of job since

his removal from service on 5th May, 1989 and he has not been
employed in any establishment ever since. He has pleaded that he has
five daughters and no means of livelihood. The applicant has also

contended that he fulfills the requirement under Section 17-B to get
direction to the petitioner to pay wages at Rs.3000/- per month and at
present at Rs.10,000/- per month which a conductor with Delhi
Transport Corporation is receiving.

3.

The application is supported by the affidavit of the respondent

deposing categorically that he has been out of job since his removal
from service on 5th May, 1989 and even from the date of the award 11th
March, 2004 and he has not been employed in any establishment ever
since.

4.

The application is contested by the petitioner contending inter-

alia that the allegation of the applicant that he has been out of job and
not employed in any establishment since his dismissal is not admitted
as the petitioner has no knowledge about the same. The allegation of
the applicant that his daughters/legal heirs are entirely dependent on
him has also been denied.

5.

Perusal of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

reveals that it comes into operation when an Award directing
reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further proceedings by the
employer. The preliminary consideration for making available such a
relief under Section 17B to a workman is to be found in the benevolent
purpose of the enactment, its spirit, intendment and object underlying,
W.P(C) No.5368/2005

Page 2 of 7

which is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship which
would be caused to a workman due to delay in the implementation of an
award directing reinstatement of his services on account of the
challenge made to it by the employer. Section 17B recognizes a
workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body and soul
together when a challenge has been made to an Award directing his
reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no inherent right of
assailing an order or an award by an industrial adjudicator by way of
an appeal. The payment which is required to be made by the employer
to the workman has been held to be akin to a subsistence allowance
which is neither refundable nor recoverable from a workman even if the
Award in his favor is set aside by the High Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106
(para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex Court was of the
view that the object under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the hardship that is caused to
the workman due to the delay in implementation of the Award.

6.

Moreover granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing

orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule;
refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the relief
could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional
error where there is no relationship of employer and employee between
the parties.

Thus if the requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes

Act, 1947 are satisfied then no order can be passed denying the
workman the benefit of statutory provisions of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The statute requires satisfaction of the
following four conditions:
(i) an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed
in proceedings in a High Court or the Supreme Court;
(ii) during the pendency of such proceedings, employer is
required to pay full wages to the workman;
(iii) the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full wages
last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance
admissible to him under any Rule;
(iv) such wages would be admissible only if the workman
had not been employed in any establishment during such
period and an affidavit had been filed to such effect

8.

The practice of disposal of the petition as well as the application

under Section 17B of the Act contemporaneously was deprecated by the
Apex Court and the High Court was directed to first expeditiously
dispose of the application under Section 17B by the Supreme Court by
its decision reported at VII (2000) SLT 70=JT 2000 (8) SC 501,
Workmen Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Hindustan
Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. & Ors. While considering an application
under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Court cannot go
into the merits of the case in the writ petition. It was so held in 86
(2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.
W.P(C) No.5368/2005

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 entitled Town Municipal, Athani v.
P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman has
a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot
be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act for
enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was concerned with
the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the Court would have a
bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well. From the
authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court, the right of a
workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified under the
Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the
constitutional mandate. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean
all the wages that have fallen due at least from the date of the Award.

10.

The respondent/applicant has deposed that he has remained

unemployed from the date of his dismissal and also from the date of
award. The award was in his favor directing his reinstatement which
has not been done because the stay of implementation of the award
sought by the petitioner and which was granted by order dated 4th
April, 2005. There is nothing to show that the applicant is employed in
any establishment. The applicant fulfills all the criteria for granting
relief under section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 in the
W.P(C) No.5368/2005

facts and circumstances.

11.

stated hereinabove the application is allowed. The petitioner is directed
to pay the last drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher
from the date of award, 11th March, 2004 to the respondent. Arrears of

minimum wages whichever is higher by the 15th of every English
calendar month during the pendency of the writ petition. The
