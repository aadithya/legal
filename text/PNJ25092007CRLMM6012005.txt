in

Crl.M.C.

No.601/2005 following order was passed:“Crl.M.C. No.601/2005 and Crl.M.A. No.2022/2005
The petitioner is the Managing Director of
Intercorp Industries Ltd. Learned counsel for the
petitioner says that although the offence alleged
against the petitioner relates to a balance-sheet,
the balance-sheet has not been placed before the
Court along with the complaint. The complaint says
that the balance-sheet is annexure-3 to the
complaint. Learned counsel for the petitioner says
that there is no annexure-3 or in other words
annexure-3 has not been filed before the learned
Metropolitan Magistrate. It is also submitted that
the report under Section 209-A of the Companies
Act has also not been placed before the learned
Trial Court.

List on 13.7.2005.
Trial Court record be summoned two days
prior to the next date of hearing.

2.

Till the next date of hearing personal
appearance of the petitioner before the trial court is
exempted provided he is represented by a counsel,
subject to the condition that he will appear in
person whenever required by the trial court for a
specific purpose.”
Trial Court record has been received. It has been

perused.
3.

Complaint in question under Section 211 of the

Companies Act has been filed by the Registrar of Companies
against Anand Srivastava stated to be the Managing Director of
M/s.Intercorp Industries Ltd.
4.

In the complaint there is reference to as many as 6

annexures.
5.

Indeed, not a single annexure has been filed along with

the complaint.
6.

I note that certain documents have been filed but none

has been marked as an annexure.
7.

From a perusal of the complaint it is apparent that

case of the prosecution against the petitioner is that as Managing
Director of the company he was responsible for compliance with
the provisions of Section 211 of the Companies Act 1956. That an
annual return was filed up to 22.8.1998. That the same revealed
that the petitioner was the Managing Director.

That the return

was Annexure-2 to the complaint.
8.

No such return marked as Annexure-2 has been filed

along with the complaint.
9.

It is further pleaded in the complaint that the

inspection of the books of accounts and records of the company
was conducted by one Shri J.N.Tiku whose report revealed certain
irregularities.

That the irregularities pertained to the balance-

sheet as on 31.3.1999 marked as Annexure-3 to the complaint.
10.

I note that no document has been marked as

Annexure-3 to the complaint.
11.

I need not note anything further for the reason

averments have been made thereafter to a stated show cause
notice, an order authorizing the filing of the complaint and a
receipt to the show cause notice; documents are referred to as
Annexure-4 to Annexure-6. None have been filed. I do not find in
the record of the trial

court

any

document

marked

as

Annexure-4, Annexure-5 or Annexure-6.
12.

In that view of the matter, though unfortunately this

Court is left with no option but to quash the impugned
summoning order dated 18.10.2001.
13.

But before formally quashing the same I would be

failing not to note a trend which is unfortunately emerging. A preformatted cyclo-styled proforma order having blank spaces filled
up by hand has been used as a summoning order.

14.

It reveals a non-application of mind.

15.

Had the learned Judge been vigilant and had perused

the complaint it would have dawned upon him that documents
marked and referred to as Annexure-1 to Annexure-6 along with
the complaint have not been filed as marked annexures.

The

complaint could have been rejected there and then.
16.

Be that as it may, petition stands disposed of quashing

the summoning order dated 18.10.2001.
17.

LCR be returned.
