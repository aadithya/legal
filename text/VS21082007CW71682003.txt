The Petitioner was transferred from Delhi to Hissar vide

transfer order by filing O.A. before the Tribunal, which was dismissed

Petitioner submits that now office order dated 30.04.2007 has been
issued by the Department, as per which the Petitioner stands
transferred to New Delhi again. In view of this development, present
writ petition has, in any case, become infructuous. The only
grievance of the petitioner remaining now is that though this
transfer order was passed on 30th April 2007, which was in respect of
14 persons, all other 13 persons have joined their new place of
posting but the petitioner is still not relieved by the Doordarshan
Kendra, Hissar and therefore he has not been able to join the duties
at DD News, New Delhi, where he is posted now.
Learned counsel for the Respondent fairly states that he
will look into the matter and ensure that this order is complied with
as early as possible.
With

these

observations,

present

writ

petition

is

dismissed as infructuous.
