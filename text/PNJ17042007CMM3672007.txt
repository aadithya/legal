PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Alok Kumar Jain was married to Ms.Purnima Jain at

New Delhi. They were blessed with 2 daughters.
2.

Alok Kumar Jain was employed as a Senior Manager

with Engineers India Ltd.

Unfortunately for the couple their

daughter, Radhika, suffered from severe hearing loss of both
ears. The couple spent considerable money on her treatment.
CM(M) No.367/07

page 1 of 10

In the year 2000, Alok Kumar Jain, in consultation with his wife,
decided that if he took up employment in Abu Dhabi he could
enhance his monetary prospects. He tendered his resignation.
He received Rs.27 lacs as terminal benefits from Engineers
India Ltd.

The money was deposited in a joint account

operated by the husband and the wife. The husband took up
employment

in

Abu

Dhabi.

Unfortunately,

the

couple

separated. The 2 daughters are with the mother.
3.

The wife filed a petition for divorce under Section

13(1)(i)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act. She filed an application
under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act praying that she be
granted interim maintenance @Rs.2 lacs per month. She also
prayed that the husband should pay to her Rs.11 lacs for
treatment of their daughter Baby Radhika.
4.

To sustain the claim she averred that her husband

was earning approximately Rs.7 lacs per month in Abu Dhabi.
That he was being provided an accommodation free of cost by
the employer.
5.

In the reply, husband stated that over the last 3

years, the wife had withdrawn approximately Rs.56 lacs from
the joint accounts maintained by the couple.

CM(M) No.367/07

That she had

page 2 of 10

exaggerated the income of the husband.

That his monthly

income was Rs.2.11 lacs. That out of Rs.56 lacs withdrawn by
the wife, she had made investments, details whereof was not
disclosed to the husband. Not denying his liability to maintain
the wife and the 2 daughters, it was stated by Alok Kumar Jain
that the wife was having sufficient funds, interest income
wherefrom was sufficient to sustain the monthly expenses of
the family.
6.

By a cryptic order, without calling upon the wife to

explain how she had spent Rs.56 lacs which was withdrawn by
her from the joint accounts, learned Matrimonial Judge has
directed the husband to pay maintenance of Rs.20,000/- per
month for the benefit of the 2 minor daughters with effect from
the date of the application.
7.

In respect of the claim of the wife that Rs.11 lacs be

paid for medical treatment of the daughter Baby Radhika,
learned Judge has opined that issue would be decided when the
wife produces details of the likely expenses supported with the
opinion of renowned surgeon.
8.

Impugned

order

dated

13.2.2007

has

been

challenged by the husband inter alia on the ground that the

CM(M) No.367/07

page 3 of 10

learned Judge has ignored that the wife had not accounted for
Rs.56 lacs withdrawn by her from the joint accounts maintained
by the husband and the wife.
9.

Since

I

am

remanding

the

matter

for

fresh

adjudication, lest prejudice is caused to either party, I refrain
from discussing the plethora of precedents cited at the Bar by
learned counsel for the parties.
10.

Law under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act is

well crystallized.

From the judicial precedents, factors which

can be culled out as required to be kept in mind while awarding
interim maintenance are as under:(i)

Status of the parties,

(ii)

Reasonable wants of the claimant,

(iii)

The income and property of the claimant,

(iv)

Number of persons to be maintained by the husband,

(v)

Liabilities, if any, of the husband,

(vi)

The amount required by the wife to live a similar life style

as she enjoyed in the matrimonial home keeping in view food,
clothing, shelter, educational and medical needs of the wife
and the children, if any, residing with the wife and
(vii) Payment capacity of the husband.

CM(M) No.367/07

page 4 of 10

11.

Further, where it is noted that the respective

spouses have not come out with a truthful version of their
income, some guesswork has to be resorted to by the Court
while forming an opinion as to what could possibly be the
income of the 2 spouses. This guesswork has to be based on
the status of the family, the place where they are residing and
the past expenses on the children, if any.
12.

In the instant case, husband has truthfully disclosed

his monthly income in Abu Dhabi i.e. Rs.2.11 lacs per month.
While deciding what maintenance has to be paid to the wife
who is maintaining 2 daughters, cost of living in Abu Dhabi has
to be taken note of.
13.

If this was the only fact to be considered, there

would have been no problem in sustaining the impugned order.
However, there is a problem. The problem is non disclosure of
how has the wife spent appropriated Rs.56 lacs over the past 3
years.

Admittedly, said amount was available in the joint

accounts of the parties.

Admittedly, said amount has

dissipated.
14.

An additional fact to be noted is that the wife and

the 2 daughters are living in a flat purchased by the husband,

CM(M) No.367/07

page 5 of 10

i.e., no rent is being paid by the wife.
15.

Further,

admittedly,

Baby

Radhika

considerable money for her medical treatment.

needs

But, on this

issue, learned Matrimonial Judge has kept the matter open for
adjudication as and when wife provides cogent material in the
form of medical opinion supported with evidence as to how
much money would be required for the cochlear operation of
the daughter.
16.

It is not in dispute that 2 accounts were opened in

the joint names of the husband and the wife with Corporation
Bank, Bhikaji Cama Place and State Bank of India, Vasant Vihar
respectively. The second account is a NRE account.
17.

From the statement of bank accounts filed by the

husband, undisputed position is that between February 2001 to
January 2004, a sum of Rs.61,94,011/- was credited in the said
2 accounts. It is also not in dispute that the wife has withdrawn
a sum of Rs.56,02,000/- from the 2 accounts between 1.2.2001
to 28.1.2004.
18.

From the statement of bank accounts it is further

revealed

that

withdrawn

page 6 of 10

Rs.41,78,000/- from the 2 accounts. It would be interesting to
note that the wife sought divorce by filing a petition on
29.1.2004.
19.

The statement of bank accounts show that between

the years 2001 to 2003, the wife has spent Rs.5,25,303/- by
making cash withdrawals, paying school fee, electricity and
water bills etc. in sum of Rs.5,25,303/-. In this period she has
withdrawn or spent Rs.6,12,000/- for purchase of a car, a
computer + a hearing aid with FM receiver for Baby Radhika.
Further, between March 2003 to March 2007 the wife has
withdrawn Rs.9,80,000/-, which approximates to Rs.20,000/per month for household expenses.
20.

In respect of the huge cash withdrawals made by the

wife only Rs.18,94,000/- have been accounted for. These are in
the shape of 2 fixed deposits totalling Rs.14 lacs + monies
deposited in the public provident fund account opened in the
name of the children.
21.

Thus,

an

approximate

sum

of

Rs.34,00,000/-

remains unexplained.
22.

If I look to the statement of accounts, it is obvious

that between the year 2001

CM(M) No.367/07

to 2003, the wife spent

page 7 of 10

Rs.5,25,303/- to sustain the household, pay the school fee and
electricity and water bills. During this period, she purchased a
car and a sophisticated hearing aid + a computer for the
daughter

for

which

3

items

she

spent

Rs.6,12,000/-.

Thereafter, from March 2003 to March 2007 i.e. in 4 years she
withdrew Rs.4,80,000/- presumably spent towards household
expenses for said period.
23.

It is evident that the wife was able to sustain herself

and the daughters in sum of Rs.20,000/- per month as
household expenses + other miscellaneous expenses excluding
capital expenses incurred for purchase of a car, hearing aid and
a computer.
24.

The learned Judge ought to have called upon the

wife to disclose on oath as to where has she spent or invested
approximately Rs.34 lacs.

The learned Judge ought to have

called upon the wife to explain as to why she withdrew
Rs.41,78,000/- between 24.3.2003 and 28.1.2004. What was
the need to withdraw such an heavy amount?
25.

Further investigation was required to be made as to

in what manner interest accruing on the 2 fixed deposits
totalling Rs.14 lacs was being spent by the wife.

CM(M) No.367/07

page 8 of 10

26.

It could well be argued that the wife has invested

huge sums in undisclosed places wherefrom she is getting
considerable income by way of interest or dividends.
27.

I need not analyze the evidence on record any

further inasmuch as I am relegating the parties before the
learned Matrimonial Judge and therefore I do not want either
party to be prejudiced at the inquiry, lest any observation
made by me, inadvertently concludes the issue one way or the
other.
28.

The

petition

accordingly

stands

disposed

of

quashing the impugned order dated 13.2.2007.
29.

The matter is remanded for fresh adjudication

before the learned Matrimonial Judge.

I direct that at the

remanded proceedings, learned Matrimonial Judge would call
upon the wife to file a detailed affidavit disclosing investments
made by her as also render a true account of all withdrawals
effected by the wife from the year 2001 till date. Further, the
wife would be called upon to explain details of the monthly
household expenditure as also expenses incurred on the
education and medical treatment of the 2 daughters. Further,
the wife would be called upon to explain withdrawals made in

CM(M) No.367/07

page 9 of 10

sum of Rs.41,78,000/- from 24.3.2003 to 28.1.2004. Further, in
respect of withdrawals made prior and subsequent thereto, the
wife would be called upon to explain that if she could maintain
herself and the 2 daughters in approximately Rs.20,000/- per
month preceding and succeeding the period 24.3.2003 to
28.1.2004, where has she spent the money withdrawn between
24.3.2003 to 28.1.2004.
30.

An analysis of withdrawals made from the 2

accounts from time to time shall be done by the learned
Matrimonial Judge and thereafter the application under Section
24 of the Hindu Marriage Act filed by the wife would be redecided. Needless to state, principles culled out by me in para
10 above would be kept in view by the learned Matrimonial
Judge while re-deciding the application.
31.

No costs.
