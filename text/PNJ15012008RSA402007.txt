PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Stay of operation of the impugned judgment and

decree dated 11.1.2007 passed in RCA No.22/2006 has been
prayed

for

in

the

above

captioned

civil

miscellaneous

application.
2.

A substantial question of law stands framed vide

order dated 31.5.2007.
3.

Since hearing of the appeal is likely to take time,

arguments were heard in the afore-noted civil miscellaneous
RSA No.40/07

Pg.No.1 of 6

application.
4.

Jural relationship between the parties of landlord-

tenant is not in dispute. The dispute is whether the appellant
is liable to be ejected from the suit premises as per the case
set up in the plaint or is it entitled to defend its possession as
per defence pleaded in the written statement.
5.

To put it pithly, according to the appellant, under

the agreement dated 20.9.1980 being not a lease agreement
but an agreement to lease it was entitled to protect the
possession under Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act
1882.

The stand of the landlord was to the contrary.

The

landlord succeeded. Two concurrent decisions are in favour of
the landlord.
6.

The decrees are not only for ejectment but even for

money, in that, damages for continued use and occupation
after the date, it has been held that possession of the appellant
became unlawful, have also been awarded.
7.

A perusal of the grounds urged in the second appeal

reveal that the principal grievance of the appellant relates to
the findings returned by the Courts below that Ex.PW-1/DZ4
was a lease agreement and not an agreement to lease and that
since the lease was not renewed possession of the appellant
became that of a tenant from month to month. Tenancy being
RSA No.40/07

Pg.No.2 of 6

determined, continued possession was unlawful. In the second
appeal, aforesaid finding has been challenged.
8.

Pertaining to the quantification of the mesne profits

has not been questioned in the appeal. In other words, if the
decision of the Courts below is upheld appellant would be liable
to pay the monetary part of the decree.
9.

To put it differently, in appeal, the monetary part of

the decree would stand or fail depending upon the decision on
the legal interpretation of the agreement Ex.PW-1/DZ4.
10.

The property is at Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.

fleet street of Delhi.

It is in the heart of Delhi.

The

It is a

commercial premises. Ex.PW-1/DZ4 was entered into between
the parties way back on 20.9.1980.
11.

With reference to the evidence led it has been held

that comparable rent in the area increased to Rs.19/- per sq.ft.
per month as of January 1991 and in the year 2000 the same
increased to Rs.40/- per sq.ft. per month.
12.

As per the decree passed by the learned Trial Court

total damages payable are in sum of Rs.41,07,880/-. Amounts
paid by the appellant have to be deducted. The same are in
sum of Rs.18,80,254/-. In terms of the decree passed by the
First Appellate Court a further sum of Rs.1,22,696/- has to be
deducted from out of the amount as awarded by the learned
RSA No.40/07

Pg.No.3 of 6

Trial Court. Appellant deposited with the First Appellate Court
Rs.9,34,142/-. A bank guarantee in sum of Rs.9,34,142/- has
been furnished. Rs.2,36,646/- remains outstanding.
13.

Ordinarily, unless it is shown that the decision under

challenge is perverse, pertaining to money decrees, rule of law
is not to stay the same.
14.

I see no reason to stay the monetary part of the

decree, more so when in the second appeal there is no
challenge to the quantification of the mesne profits.
15.

It was urged by learned counsel for the respondent

that in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
reported as (2005) 1 SCC 705 Atma Ram Properties vs. Federal
Motors, considering a steep increase in rentals, during the
pendency of the appeal appellants be directed to pay monthly
mesne profits at a sum at least double of what has been
determined by the Courts below. Learned counsel submitted
that since as of the year 2000 monthly rent at market rate has
been determined at Rs.40/- per sq.ft., as of the year 2008 the
said amount could reasonably be doubled.
16.

In para 18 of the decision in Atma Ram Properties'

case (supra) it was held as under:“18.
That apart, it is to be noted that the
appellate court while exercising jurisdiction under Order
41 Rule 5 of the Code did have power to put the
RSA No.40/07

Pg.No.4 of 6

appellant tenant on terms. The tenant having suffered
an order of eviction must comply and vacate the
premises. His right of appeal is statutory but his prayer
for grant of stay is dealt with in exercise of equitable
discretionary jurisdiction of the appellate court. While
ordering stay the appellate court has to be alive to the
fact that it is depriving the successful landlord of the
fruits of the decree and is postponing the execution of
the order for eviction. There is every justification for
the appellate court to put the appellant tenant on terms
and direct the appellant to compensate the landlord by
payment of a reasonable amount which is not
necessarily the same as the contractual rate of rent. In
Marshall Sons & Co. (I) Ltd. vs. Sahi Oretrans (P) Ltd.
this Court has held that once a decree for possession
has been passed and execution is delayed depriving
the judgment-creditor of the fruits of decree, it is
necessary for the Court to pass appropriate orders so
that reasonable mesne profits which may be equivalent
to the market rent is paid by a person who is holding
over the property.”
17.

Since I propose to expedite the disposal of the

second appeal in my opinion ends of justice and equity would
be met requiring appellant to pay to the respondent, monthly
damages for continued use and occupation, during pendency
of the appeal, payment being made by the 7th day of each
calendar month @Rs.40/- per sq.ft.

being the sum held

payable by the learned First Appellate Court.
