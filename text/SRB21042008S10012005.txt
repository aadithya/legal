1.

In these proceedings, the plaintiff seeks decree for

permanent injunction and damages for passing off rendition of
accounts etc. against the defendant.
2.

According to the plaint averments, the plaintiff engages

itself in the business of manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical
products and medicinal preparations under various formulations. It
claims to own and mark the tablet as "DOMIZOL". It is averred that
the trade mark was adopted and after it was conceived in March,
CS(OS) 1001/2005

1 of 8

2002, in respect of Omeprazole magnesium equivalent to Omeprazole
being 10mg. The tablet is sold in 10mg. and 20 mg. potency. The
plaintiff claims to use the trade mark continuously and extensively
after March, 2002.

The plaintiff further avers that it filed an

application for registration of the said trademark "Domizol" under
No.1071053 in class-5 of the 4th Schedule to the Trade and
Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, on 21.12.2001.

Its application was

allowed on 1.6.2005. The plaintiff, therefore, avers it is the exclusive
owner of the trade mark.
3.

It

is

claimed

that

the

plaintiff

came

across

an

advertisement under Section 20(1) of Trade and Merchandise Marks
Act, 1999 in the Trademark Journal dated 14.10.2003 where the
defendant No.1 had claimed for registration of the trade mark
Domizole.

The said advertisement contained a statement that the

defendant had proposed to use the said mark. The plaintiff claims to
have filed notices of opposition to the application for registration of
the trade mark on 7.4.2004, resisting the registration of the
defendant's trademark Domizole as amounting to infringement as well
as passing off its mark. The plaintiff, in the circumstances, avers that
it caused a legal notice to the defendant No.1 dated 29.9.2004 calling
upon it to desist from using trade mark Domizole as it was deceptively
similar to the plaintiff's trademark and in any event infringe the

CS(OS) 1001/2005

2 of 8

plaintiff's trade mark "Domilzol".
4.

The plaintiff claims that the defendant did not heed the

request and, therefore, it has sought for the relief. Besides claiming a
decree for perpetual injunction, the plaintiff has also sought for
damages quantified at Rs.10 lakhs.
5.

After summons

were issued, the defendant entered

appearance and filed its written statement on 1.6.2002. Its defence is
that of an honest bona fide prior user of the mark Domizole. Apart
from relying on the application for registration of the said mark
Domizole, defendant also avers that registration was obtained from
the Drug Controller, Panipat on 21.12.2001 through its then
manufacturer M/s.HIS Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. It avers that the said
concern sold entire stocks of the medicinal preparations under the
trade mark DOMIZOLE to the defendant exclusively. The defendant
further denies the plaintiff's right to exclusivity and claims to have
been recipient of substantial profits of the product in question.

It

avers in paragraph 10 for the year 2001-02, the sales figures were to
the extent of Rs.58,000/-; for the year 2002-03, the sales figures were
Rs.8,32,000/- and for the next year 2003-04, it was Rs.7,18,000/-.
6.

During the course of the proceedings, on several dates,

the parties had requested and obtained adjournment on the ground of
exploring possibilities for an amicable settlement. Subsequently, the

CS(OS) 1001/2005

3 of 8

defendant stopped appearing and went unrepresented.

In the

circumstances, the defendants were proceeded ex-parte by order
dated 18.5.2007.

They did not join the proceedings at any stage

thereafter.
7.

The plaintiff, in support of its case has relied upon the

evidence of Shri Rajesh Kabu, PW-1 who filed his affidavit on
18.1.2008.

The said witness also deposed before the Court on

19.3.2008 and exhibited the affidavit as Ex.PW-1/A.

PW-1 has

supported the averments in the plaint and has also marked the
documents. These include PW/A-2, which are copies of the plaintiff's
product DOMIZOL. In addition, the plaintiff has relied upon PW/A-3,
which is the description of the said tablet DOMIZOL, and contain a list
of products along with the description of their manufacturers of
Domperidone and Omeprazole which chemical formulations, marked
by the plaintiff under the trade mark DOMIZOL. The plaintiff has also
produced a certified copy of the registration dated 1.6.2005 as
PW/A-4.

PW/A-5 are invoices evidencing the sale of the plaintiff's

product on 27.3.2002 and 31.3.2002. PW-1 has also exhibited a list
showing the plaintiff's sales turnover for the year 2002, 2003 and
2004. According to the claim in these documents, the sales have been
increasing exponentially and are to the tune of Rs.1.07 crores. The
plaintiff has also produced the advertisement for the defendant's

CS(OS) 1001/2005

4 of 8

product in the Trademark Journal dated 14.10.2003, which clearly
mentions that an application was preferred by it on 14.6.2002.

In

addition, the plaintiff has filed the copy of its opposition as Ex.PW/A-8.
8.

The Court has considered the materials on record.

The

defendant has been set down ex-parte and is un-represented. In any
event, its claim is that it was an honest bona fide prior user of the said
trade mark DOMIZOLE. It also generally denies that the said mark
amounts to an infringement of plaintiff's trade mark. However, it has
not chosen to prove or produce any document or adduce any oral
evidence.
9.

The plaintiff has produced evidence in support of its claim

as the owner of the trade mark DOMIZOL, by relying on registration
certificate dated 1.6.2005.

The said Certificate mentions that the

registration is valid from 1.1.2002, i.e. the date when the plaintiff
sought for it.
10.

Besides, the plaintiff has also produced copies of its

products as Ex.PW/A-1 and Ex.PW/A-2. In support of its claim that the
product has been sold and the trade mark is being used, the plaintiff
has relied upon Ex.PW/A-5 and PW/A-6, which are invoices for the
period March, 2002. The plaintiff has also produced the defendant's
mark Domizole.

It bears a close and confusing similarity with the

plaintiff's mark.

11.

In a case where the plaintiff alleges the infringement of its

registered mark, it is under an obligation to show that the mark of the
defendant is deceptively or confusingly similar as to mislead members
of the general public into believing it to be that of the plaintiff. The
element of dishonesty is an essential ingredient in every action for
infringement in case of pharmaceutical products. Discussing the law
on 'deceptive similarity', the Supreme Court in CADILA HEALTH

CARE LTD. VS. CADILA PHARMACEUTICALS LTD., 2001 (5) SCC
73, enlisted the following factors to be considered:-

"35(a) The nature of the marks i.e. whether the
marks are word marks or label marks or
composite marks i.e. both words and label
works.
(b) The degree of resembleness between the
marks, phonetically similar and hence similar
in idea.
(c) The nature of the goods in respect of which
they are used as trade marks.
(d) The similarity in the nature, character and
performance of the goods of the rival traders."
(e) The class of purchasers who are likely to
buy the goods bearing the marks they require,
on their education and intelligence and a
degree of care they are likely to exercise in
purchasing and/or using the goods.
(f) The mode of purchasing the goods or
placing orders for the goods.
(g) Any other surrounding circumstances
which may be relevant in the extent of
dissimilarity between the competing marks.
It also observed that:-

"32. Public interest would support lesser
degree of proof showing confusing similarity in
CS(OS) 1001/2005

6 of 8

the case of trade mark in respect of medicinal
products as against other non-medicinal
products.
Drugs are poisons, not sweets.
Confusion between medicinal products may,
therefore, be life threatening, not merely
inconvenient.
Noting the frailty of human
nature and the pressures placed by society on
doctors, there should be as many clear
indicators as possible to distinguish two
medicinal products from each other. It is not
uncommon that in hospitals, drugs can be
requested
verbally
and/or
under
critical/pressure situations.
Many patients
may be elderly, infirm or illiterate. They may
not be in a position to differentiate between
the medicine prescribed and bought which is
ultimately handed over to them."
12.

In the present case, the two competing marks are

DOMIZOL (which is owned by the plaintiff) and DOMIZOLE which is
used by the defendant. The defendant has not been able to show that
it was using the trade mark in a bona fide manner or before the
plaintiff, to fall within the exception spelt out in Section 34, which
enables prior user to continue using the mark, if it were using the
trade mark in question before its registration or used by the plaintiff.
On the other hand, the plaintiff has been able to show that it has been
continuously using the mark since March, 2002; it also obtained the
registration in June, 2005. In terms of provisions of Trade Mark Act,
the registration relates back to the date of application, i.e. 1.1.2002.
13.

Having regard to the conspectus of this case, the Court is

satisfied that the plaintiff has been able to prove infringement of its

CS(OS) 1001/2005

7 of 8

mark by the defendant. However, as far as the question of damages
are concerned, besides the material already produced, the plaintiff
has not been able to show by any empirical method, or objective
materials, the probability of its losses or assessable loss on account of
its defendant's use of the mark.

For these reasons, the claim for

damages cannot succeed.
14.

In view of the above discussion, the plaintiff is entitled to

relief in terms of paragraph 23(a) of the plaint.

A permanent

injunction restraining the defendants from using the trade mark
DOMIZOLE or any other trade mark deceptively similar to the
plaintiff's mark is hereby issued.
15.

The suit is accordingly decreed in terms of paragraph

23(a) of the plaint. Let a decree sheet be drawn. No costs.
