1.

The appellants are the tenant of the respondents in respect

of different portions of the same property, namely, Statesman House,
Barakhmaba Road, New Delhi. After taking on rent various portions of
the premises in the said building from different owners, the appellant
Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. was running its office. Four flats which
are the subject matter of these appeals are on the first floor of the said
building.

Out of these four flats, two flats were vacated by the

appellant. The lease deed executed between the parties contains
identical terms and same rent. For the sake of convenience, we may
refer to the facts as appeared in RFA No.75/2007.

In this case,

respondents are the owners of the flat bearing No.B-104, 1st floor
Statesman House, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi.

RFA Nos.75-78/2007

Lease Agreement

Page 2 of page 7

dated 13.12.2004 was executed between the respondents and the
appellant in respect of the aforesaid flat as per which three years lease
was granted to the appellant.

Monthly rent was fixed @ Rs.95 per

sq.ft. The total monthly rent in this manner comes to be Rs.85,880/-,.
As per the respondents, besides the above rental, the appellant was
also liable to pay maintenance charge to the Maintenance Society at
the agreed charges

@ Rs.14 per sq.ft. towards common service

charges etc. and further separate maintenance agreement was
entered into between the parties. This lease also contains a stipulation
that the lease period can be extended for a further period of two terms
of three years each on the option of the appellant with an increase of
20% of the monthly rental after every three years of the last paid. It
was also stipulated that the appellant was required to inform about the
renewal of the lease agreement by giving at least three months notice
prior to the expiry of the first lease Agreement.
2.

The first period of Agreement, in this manner, expires on

12.12.2004. The appellant continued to occupy the leased premises.
According to the respondent, the appellant became liable to pay the
rent after increasing the same by 20% as per the stipulation contained
in this Agreement dated 13.12.2004. In this manner, the rent was to
be @ Rs.114 per sq.ft.

However, instead of paying the rent at the

aforesaid rate, the appellant unilaterally and suo motu reduced the
same to Rs.72.85 per sq. ft. The respondents in these circumstances,

RFA Nos.75-78/2007

Page 3 of page 7

filed a suit for the recovery of the arrears of rent claiming that they
were entitled to the rent @114 per sq.ft.

Since the appellant had

started paying monthly rent calculated @72.85 per sq.ft.,
making the total payment of Rs.65,856/- per month,

thereby

therefore,

the

respondents claimed difference in the rental per month which
according to them comes to Rs.37,200/-(Rs.114 per sq.ft minus 72.85
per sq.ft). The suit was filed under the provisions of Order XXXVII of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The appellants were served with

court and the suit of the plaintiff is decreed allowing their claim

to pay rent @ Rs.114 per sq.ft

Similar order was passed in other three suits

preferred by the respondents in other cases. Aggrieved by the said
order, these appeals are filed by the appellants.
3.

The learned trial court by passing the said judgment and

decree has held that as per the Agreement,

the respondents were

entitled to stipulated increase of 20% per annum after the expiry of
three years period and, therefore, the payment of rent @ Rs.114 per
sq.ft. was proper. Learned Additional and District Judge has further
held that it was not open to the appellant to reduce the rent
unilaterally to Rs.72.85 paisa per sq.ft. and, therefore, according to
the trial court and in view of the Agreement dated 13.12.2004, no

RFA Nos.75-78/2007

triable issue arises.
4.

We may point out at this stage that some other flats

owners in the same building had also filed a suit for possession and
mesne profits against the appellant and in some of these suits decree
for possession has been passed. The appeals were filed against those
orders and in the appeal, statement was made by the learned counsel
for the appellant that the appellant had taken decision to vacate those
premises by 31.8.2007 and this Court has passed orders in those
appeals granting time to the appellant to vacate the said flats by
31.8.2007. Of course, no suit for possession is filed by the respondents
herein, therefore, obviously learned counsel for the appellant cannot
make any such statement in these cases. However, it is possible that
when the appellants are vacating the other portion of the premises,
which the appellants took on rent from some other landlords,

the

appellant may adopt the same course of action in these cases as well.
5.

We may state at the outset that though the trial court has

passed the decree for arrears of rent on the basis that rental of the
premises is increased to Rs.114 per sq.ft.,

learned counsel

for the

respondents on instructions from the respondents, who are also
present in the court, had made a statement to the effect that
respondents would confine their claim for arrears of rent to be
calculated @ Rs.95 per sq.ft. which was the contractual rent agreed to
in the unregistered lease deed dated 31.1.2001 even if clause related

RFA Nos.75-78/2007

Page 5 of page 7

to escalation in the said rent by 20% is not enforced.
6.

In view of this concession given by the respondents, the

only question which needs to be determined is as to whether it was
open to the appellant to reduce the rent to Rs.72.85 paisa per sq.ft.
w.e.f. 13.12.2004?

The answer will be in negative.

The only

submission which is made by the learned counsel for the appellant,
which was the argument raised before the trial court as well, is that
the rental during that period had gone down substantially and,
therefore, decision to reduce the rent was taken by the appellant
which was based on the

prevailing market rent, therefore the

appellant paid rent to the respondents @ 72.85 paisa per sq.ft.
Whether the
or not,

market rent of the premises in question had gone down

is not the question before this Court to go into.

The fact

remains that there was an Agreement between the parties as per
which the rent was fixed @ 95 per sq.ft.

The Clause in the

agreement was for increase of rent and not for decrease of rent.
Therefore, any decision to decrease the rent has to be taken with the
mutual consent of the parties as it amounts to novation of the contract
entered into between the parties.

After the expiry of the initial term,

if the appellant wanted to continue in the said premises, such a
decrease, therefore, could not have been the unilateral act on the part
of the appellant and again in this manner it cannot bind the
respondents at all.

RFA Nos.75-78/2007

7.

Respondents would be entitled to receive the rent at the

rate agreed upon, if not at escalated rates (which question as aforesaid
is not gone into, in view of the concession given by the respondents
herein). We, therefore, do not find any merit in these appeals which
are accordingly dismissed.

However, the decree of the trial court

stands modified to the extent that arrears of rent shall be calculated
on the basis that rental of the premises is Rs.95 per sq.ft. and not
Rs.114 per sq.ft.
8.

The appeals and all pending applications stand disposed of

accordingly.
