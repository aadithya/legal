1.

The petitioners are OT Technicians working in Lady

Hardinge Medical College.

Before the implementation of 5th

Central Pay Commission recommendations, they were placed in
the pay scale of Rs.1200-2040.

The Laboratory Technicians

working in the hospitals were getting pay scale of Rs.1320-2040.
These OT Technicians therefore represented before 5th Pay
Commission for grant of same pay scale as given to Laboratory
Technicians on the ground that they were discharging similar
duties. 5th Pay Commission went into this aspect and in its report
W.P. (C) No. 13566-80 OF 2006

recommended

same

pay

scale

as

given

to

Laboratory

Technicians, namely, Rs.5000-8000 (revised scale of Rs.16002660 which scale was given to the Laboratory Technicians prior to
its revision). The operative portion of the said recommendation
contained in para 52.78 reads as under :“The Administrative Ministry have observed
that, there is similarity in the training,
qualification & recruitment rules among the
laboratory technical staff and the O.T.
Technical Staff.
In view of comparable
qualifications and duties, we recommend
parity of O.T. Technicians and Lab Technicians
at the initial levels also. Accordingly, the
following grades are proposed for O.T.staff in
future.
i) OT Attendant – Rs.750-940 with 2 ACP
levels of Rs.775-1025 and Rs.800-1150 with
minimum 8th Standard qualification, at entry;
ii) OT Assistant – Rs.950-1500 with 2 ACP
levels of Rs.1200-2040 and Rs. 1400-2300
with minimum qualification of matric (with
Science) plus certificate or 10+2 with Science
for direct recruitment; and

2.

iii) OT Technician- Rs.1600-2660 with 2 ACP
levels of Rs.1640-2900 and Rs.2000-3500
with minimum B.Sc. plus Diploma/Certificate
in the relevant subjects.
The existing
incumbents in each organization in
operation theaters as well as sterlisation
services will be placed in appropriate
matching pay scales.”
This
recommendation
was
accepted
by

Government.

the

The pay scale of petitioners and other similarly

situated persons was fixed in the revised scale of Rs.5000-8000
W.P. (C) No. 13566-80 OF 2006

Page 2 of 8

vide orders dated 22nd December, 1998 and the petitioners were
enjoying the scale for quite some time.

However, sometime in

the year 2005, the respondents took the view that the petitioners
herein were not entitle to the revised pay scale of Rs.5000-8000,
inasmuch as, as per the recommendations of 5th Central Pay
Commission that pay scale was to be granted only to those OT
Technicians who were having a minimum qualification of BSc. plus
diploma/certificate in the relevant subjects. Show-cause notices
were issued to the petitioners and thereafter, petitioners were
placed in the pay scale of Rs.4000-6000.

Challenging the said

order of the respondents, petitioners preferred the application
under Section 19 of the Administrative Tribunal Act which has
been dismissed by the Tribunal vide orders dated 3rd August,
2006 and impugning these orders, present writ petition is filed.
3.

Perusal of the order of the Tribunal would show that

Tribunal was of the opinion that the higher pay scales were
recommended by the Central Pay Commission only with the
condition that it would be admissible to those who were having
the higher qualification of BSc. plus diploma/certificate in the
relevant subjects. This conclusion is contained in para 15 of the
impugned judgment which is to the following effect :“We have heard the rival contentions of both
the parties and have considered all aspects of
W.P. (C) No. 13566-80 OF 2006

the case in view of the directions of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is not in dispute
that there are number of posts and categories
of posts for which higher pay scales are
recommended by the Central Pay Commission
but with certain conditions like higher
qualification etc. It is also not in dispute that
once the recommendations of the Central Pay
Commission are accepted by the Government,
sometime even with modification, only then
the pay scales would become admissible to
the concerned employees.
In the instant
case, there is no doubt that higher pay scale
of Rs.5000-8000 could have been granted
only to those OT Technicians who possessed
the prescribed qualification. Since the revised
pay scale of Rs.5000-8000 was erroneously
granted to the employees of one institution,
namely Lady Hardinge Medical College,
withdrawal of the pay scale by way of
rectification cannot be said to be unjustified
nor can an erroneously granted pay scale
become the basis for grant of the same scale
to the employees of other institution, namely
the Safdarjung Hospital.”
It is trite that while granting higher pay scale, condition

that the person should have higher qualifications, can be
imposed.
5.

The contention which is raised by learned counsel for

the petitioner, however, is that there was no such condition
imposed for possessing the higher qualification of BSc. plus
diploma/certificate in the relevant subjects, in so far as the
present

incumbents,

like

the

petitioners,

are

concerned.

Referring to the same portion of the recommendation extracted
above, Mr. Krishna, learned counsel for the petitioner argued that
W.P. (C) No. 13566-80 OF 2006

Page 4 of 8

the pay scale was given after satisfying that there was similarity
in training, qualification and Recruitment Rules among the
Laboratory Technical Staff and the OT Technical Staff. He further
submitted that the proposed grades which are mentioned
thereafter and wherein qualifications are also stated are for the
incumbents who would be appointed in future as stated therein.
He also submitted that the recommendations clearly stated that
“the existing incumbents in each organization in Operation
Theaters as well as sterilization services will be placed in
appropriate pay scale”.
6.

Mr Gangwani, learned counsel for the respondent, on

the other hand, submitted that while recommending the grades it
was categorically stated that same would be given to the OT
Technicians who possess “minimum BSc. plus diploma/certificate
in the relevant subjects”.

He also submitted that the following

lines thereafter for giving existing incumbents the matching pay
scale is preceded by the condition of minimum qualification and
therefore it is implicit therein that only those existing incumbents
who have the qualifications would be given the said pay scales.
7.

Mr. Gangwani also refers to the counter affidavit filed

by the Government wherein it is, inter alia, mentioned that as per
the prevalent Recruitment Rules for the OT Technicians, LHMC
W.P. (C) No. 13566-80 OF 2006

Page 5 of 8

and Smt. S.K. Hospital notified on 25.7.1989, the minimum
qualification prescribed for the post is matriculation or equivalent
from a recognized board with 5 years experience as Operation
Theater Assistant and non-matric with 7 years of experience as
OT Assistant and therefore it is evident that the condition of
minimum qualification as laid down by the Pay Commission was
not fulfilled as per the existing Recruitment Rules.

He further

submitted that neither the Pay Commission had recommended
upgradation of the existing pay scale of the existing OT
Technicians without anything more, nor the Government had at
any time taken any conscious decision that the pay scale of the
existing incumbents shall be upgraded whether or not they
possess

the

minimum

educational

qualifications

of

BSc.,

diploma/certificate in the relevant field.
8.

After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and

going through the judgment of the learned Tribunal, with
reference to the recommendations of the Pay Commission, we are
of the view that the view taken by the Tribunal is plausible.
Therefore, it would not be necessary to interfere with the
impugned judgment.
9.

However, we are also of the view that the submission

made by the learned counsel for the petitioner merits proper
W.P. (C) No. 13566-80 OF 2006

Page 6 of 8

consideration which can be done by the 6th Central Pay
Commission

that

has

already

been

constituted

by

the

Government and at present the same exercise is going on before
it.
10.

We, therefore, dispose of this Writ Petition with liberty

to the petitioner to raise the aforesaid issue before this Pay
Commission and it would be for the 6th Pay Commission to clarify
as to whether imposition of the condition of acquisition of higher
qualification of BSc. with diploma/certificate in relevant subjects is
necessary for all such OT Technicians, including the existing
incumbents or it is only for the future recruits.

We say so also

because of the reason that in the afore-quoted recommendations
of the 5th Pay Commission, the Administrative Ministry had agreed
that there was similarity in training, qualification and Recruitment
Rules among the Laboratory Technical Staff and the OT Technical
staff. Thus, even with regard to qualifications, the Administrative
Ministry had conceded that there was similarity. The Writ Petition
is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
