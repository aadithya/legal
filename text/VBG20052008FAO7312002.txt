Appellants have filed the present appeal seeking
enhancement of the compensation as awarded in this
case by the learned Tribunal.
2.

Vide the judgment dated 3rd August, 2002 passed

by Sh. Ajit Bharioke, Judge, MACT, Shahdara, Delhi, a
sum of Rs.17,45,000/- together with 9% interest
thereon from the date of filing of the petition i.e. 18th
September, 2002 till the realization of the amount, was

FAO No.731/2002

Page 2 of 10

passed in favour of the appellants and respondent No.4
and against respondents No.1 to 3.
3.

Brief facts of this case are that on 15th July, 2000,

after his night duty, the deceased T.M. Joseph was
returning home on his two wheeler scooter No.DL-7SJ9877. The deceased was driving the scooter and his
colleague K. Joy was sitting as a pillion rider. They left
Mother Dairy after 6 a.m. On reaching, Ghaziabad Red
Light

Crossing on

Delhi-Ghaziabad

Highway,

the

deceased stopped his scooter and was waiting for the
green signal. In the meanwhile, a Truck No.DL 1GA
3014 which was being driven by its driver/respondent
No.2 came at a very high speed from behind in a rash
and negligent manner and hit the scooter. Due to the
impact, the scooter along with its driver and pillion
rider were dragged to a distance of about 10 metres.
The pillion rider fell on the right side while deceased
came under the truck.

Consequently, the deceased

suffered several head injuries and also severe damage

FAO No.731/2002

Page 3 of 10

on the left side. A PCR van came on the spot and took
the deceased to Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital, Delhi,
where he was declared dead. The offending truck was
registered in the name of respondent No.1 and was
insured with respondent No.3.
4.

Being dissatisfied with the compensation amount,

the appellant have filed the present appeal.
5.

There is no challenge to the factum and the

manner in which the accident took place.
6.

The age of the deceased and his monthly income

and the multiplier adopted in this case by learned
Tribunal has not been disputed.
7.

The grouse of appellants as per the grounds of

appeal are that the learned Tribunal wrongly deducted
the canteen allowance of Rs.681/- p.m. from the
monthly gross salary of the deceased.

FAO No.731/2002

Page 4 of 10

8.

It has been contended by learned counsel for

respondent that this canteen facility was given by
office and it was for the use of the deceased for his
personal use and with the death of the deceased, this
allowance has come to an end and the Tribunal has
rightly deducted the canteen allowance from the
monthly gross salary of the deceased.
9.

The canteen allowance which was paid to the

deceased was specifically for the deceased himself and
it was meant for consumption of the deceased only and
the same has been rightly excluded from the gross
salary of the deceased while computing the loss of
earning and consequent loss of dependency caused to
the appellants.
10. The second contention of learned counsel for the
appellants is that only 1/3rd amount has been deducted
by way of personal expenses, in fact the Tribunal ought
to have deducted only 1/4th amount towards personal

FAO No.731/2002

Page 5 of 10

expenses keeping in view the number of family
members of the deceased.
11. I do not find any force in the contention of learned
counsel for the appellants that the Tribunal has
wrongly deducted 1/3rd of the income of the deceased
towards personal expenses and the same should have
been 1/4th keeping in view the number of family
members of the deceased.

In the present case,

deceased left behind widow, two children and widow
mother.
12. In a plethora of cases, the Apex Court and various
High Courts have held that 1/3rd amount of the income
should be deducted towards self-expenses of the
deceased.
13. In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. V. Charlie

and another, AIR 2005 Supreme Court 2157, the
Apex Court has observed as under;

FAO No.731/2002

Page 6 of 10

“What
would
be
the
percentage
of
deduction for personal expenditure cannot
be governed by any rigid rule or formula by
universal application. It would depend upon
circumstances of each case. In the instant
case the claimant was nearly 37 years of
age and was married. Therefore, as rightly
contended by learned counsel for the
appellant, 1/3rd deduction has to be made
for personal expenditure.”

14.

Another

contention

of

learned

counsel

for

the

appellants is that the Tribunal has refused to pay the cost

of embalming, the cost of special coffin and the cost of
air lifting of the body of the deceased to Kerela and
flight charges of the appellants and the escort
accompanying the body to Kerala.
15. In this regard, the findings of learned Tribunal
are relevant and the same are given below:
“While entertaining a claim in fatal
accident case and computing the
compensation for funeral expenses, the
Tribunal, in my view, is required to
award reasonable expenses for funeral
to the claimants. In this case, Shri.
T.M. Joseph who was residing and
working for gains at Delhi, therefore,
the claimants could easily have

FAO No.731/2002

Page 7 of 10

undertaken his funeral at Delhi also. If
they had indulged in luxury of taking
the dead body to Kerala by air for the
purpose of funeral, the burden for those
expenses cannot be placed upon the
respondents. Similarly, if the claimants
have
indulged
in
elaborate
and
expensive funeral that burden is not
supposed
to
be
borne
by
the
respondents. More so, because of the
fact that in any case if it had been a
natural death, then also the claimants
would have incurred the expenses
on funeral. Considering said circumstances, I allow a compensation of
Rs.5,000/- only to the petitioners on
account of funeral expenses.”

16. The second Schedule of the Act lays down certain
specific amount payable against general damages in
the case of death and for funeral expenses and the
amount laid down is Rs.2,000/-.
17. Since the deceased was residing and working for
gains at Delhi, and even till date, the appellants are
residing in Delhi, which is clear from their residential
address

as

mentioned

in

the

memo

of

parties,

therefore, the appellant could easily have undertaken

FAO No.731/2002

Page 8 of 10

his funeral at Delhi. However, if they have chosen to
air lift the body of the deceased to Kerela and bury at
their native place, for these expense, the respondent
cannot be burdened with.
18. Keeping in view, the second schedule of the Act, I
find that the amount of Rs.5,000/- awarded by the
learned Tribunal towards funeral expenses is just and
fair and requires no enhancement.
19. The judgment cited by learned counsel for the
appellant in support of its contentions namely Smt.

Sarla Dixit and Anr. vs. Balwant Yadav and Ors.
[1996] 3 S.C.R. 30 and U.P. State Road Transport
Corporation and Ors. vs. Trilok Chandra and Ors.
(1996) 4 SCC 362, are not applicable to the facts of
the present case.
20. The Tribunal in this case has awarded just and
fair compensation to the Legal Heir’s of the deceased
and have taken all the aspects into consideration while

FAO No.731/2002

Page 9 of 10

awarding compensation and no infirmity can be found
with the impugned order and no ground is made out
for enhancement of compensation awarded in this
case.
21. Hence,

the

present

appeal

under

these

circumstances is not maintainable and the same is
hereby dismissed.
22. Trial court record be sent back forthwith.
