defendants respectively.
3.

A recovery suit was filed by the plaintiffs alleging that

the defendants have inherited the estate of late Shri O.S.Khosla
who took a loan in sum of Rs.25,000/- from the first plaintiff.
Acknowledging the loan and agreeing to repay the same within
1 year together with interest @24% per annum, a writing was
stated to have been executed by late Shri O.S.Khosla which
reads as under:“I, O.S. Khosla s/o Late Shri V.N.Khosla r/o B11/8262, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi hereby
acknowledge that I have received a loan amount of
Rs.25000/- from M/s. Packing Paper Sales, 2483,
Chhipiwara Kalan, Chawri Bazar, Delhi-110006
through its partner Shri G.K.Jain through cheque
bearing No.105229 drawn upon Allahabad Bank,
Hauz Qazi Branch, Delhi-110 006.

4.

I promise to pay back the loan amount to Shri
G.K.Jain, partner of M/s.Packing Paper Sales, within
one year from today i.e. 22.10.1991 within one
year from 22.10.1991 along with interest @24%
per annum.
Sd/(O.S.Khosla)”
That, loan was taken on 22.10.1991. Same was not

repaid. On 6.6.1994, another acknowledgment with a promise
to pay back the loan was stated to have been executed by late
Shri O.S.Khosla. The acknowledgment coupled with a promise
CM(M) No.543/2005

page 2 of 14

to pay reads as under:“It is acknowledge be me today on 6.6.1994 that I
O.S.Khosla son of Late Shri V.N.Khosla resident of
B-11/8262, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi has taken a loan
amount of Rs.25,000/- from M/s.Packing Paper
Sales, 2483, Chhipiwar Kalan, Chawri Bazar, Delhi110006 through its partner Shri G.K.Jain on interest
@24% per annum.

5.

And I promise to pay it back within six months. I
will also pay the upto date interest.
Sd/(OM SARUP KHOSLA)”
Rs.2,000/- towards interest was paid by late Shri

O.S.Khosla.

Acknowledging the loan and promising to repay

the same as also requesting to waive the interest, on
4.11.1996, late Shri O.S.Khosla was stated to have executed a
writing which reads as under:“This is acknowledged today on 4.11.1996 by me
that I O.S.Khosla son of Late Shri V.N.Khosla
resident of B-11/8262, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi shall
pay back the loan amount of Rs.25000/- (Rupees
Twenty five thousand only) to M/s.Packing Paper
Sales, 2483, Chhipiwara Kalan, Chawri Bazar, Delhi110006 through its partner Shri G.K.Jain.
I have already paid the amount of Rs.2000/(Rs.Two thousand only) in cash to Shri G.K.Jain
towards the interest amount. I am very ill and I am
unable to pay the interest. It is requested that
interest amount may be forgone.

Stating that the defendants, being the wife and son

respectively of late Shri O.S.Khosla inherited his estate, since
principal i.e. Rs.25,000/- as also interest in sum of Rs.18,000/from

November

1996

to

October

1999

was

repayable,

defendants were liable to repay the same.
7.

So alleging, recovery suit was filed.

8.

When witnesses of the plaintiff were being examined

and the 3 afore noted writings stated to have been executed by
late Shri O.S.Khosla were sought to be proved, an objection was
raised to the admissibility of the documents alleging that the
same were promissory notes and requisite stamp duty not
having

been

paid

or

affixed

thereon,

the

same

were

was

that

being

inadmissible in evidence.
9.

Plea

taken

by

the

plaintiff

acknowledgments, documents were liable to be regularized by
paying the requisite penalty as also the stamp duty, which was
offered to be paid, hence plaintiffs stated that the documents
should be treated as admissible in evidence and plaintiff be
permitted to prove the same in accordance with law.
10.

Vide

CM(M) No.543/2005

order

dated

15.1.2005,

holding

that

the

page 4 of 14

documents were promissory notes which could not be made
good in law by paying the deficient stamp duty because of
proviso (a) to Section 35 of the Indian Stamp Act 1899,
objection of the defendants was sustained. It was held that the
documents could not be validated at all. Therefore, the same
were held inadmissible in evidence.
11.

Said order dated 15.1.2005 is under challenge.

12.

It was conceded by learned counsel for the parties at

the hearing held on 5.3.2007 that if the documents were
promissory notes, requisite stamp duty not being paid, the
same could not be validated in view of proviso (a) to Section 35
of the Indian Stamp Act 1899.

However, counsel made

submissions on the issue whether the 3 writings were
promissory notes or not.
13.

Needless to state, plaintiffs urged that the documents

were not promissory notes.

The defendants urged to the

contrary.

14.

Section 4 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881

defines a promissory note as under:CM(M) No.543/2005

page 5 of 14

15.

“4.
“Promissory note”. -A “promissory
note” is an instrument in writing (not being a banknote
or
a
currency-note)
containing
an
unconditional undertaking signed by the maker, to
pay a certain sum of money only to, or to the order
of, a certain person, or to the bearer of the
instrument.”
Article 1 under Schedule 1 of the Indian Stamp Act

1899 reads as under:-

16.

“1.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT of a debt exceeding
twenty rupees in amount or value, written or signed
by, or on behalf of, a debtor in order to supply
evidence of such, debt in any book (other than a
bankers' pass-book) or on a separate piece of paper
when such book or paper is left in the creditors'
possession: provided that such acknowledgment
does not contain any promise to pay the debt or
any stipulation to pay interest or to deliver any
goods or other property.
Sub section (22) of Section 2 of the Indian Stamp Act

1899 defines a promissory note as under:“(22)
“Promissory note” means a promissory
note as defined by the Negotiable Instruments Act,
1881 (26 of 1881);
It also includes a note promising the payment of
any sum of money out of any particular fund
which may or may not be available, or upon any
condition or contingency which may or may not
be performed or happen;”
17.

Whereas learned counsel for the defendants urged

that Article 1 under Schedule 1 to the Indian Stamp Act 1899

CM(M) No.543/2005

page 6 of 14

clearly legislated that a document being an acknowledgment
containing a promise to pay a debt or any stipulation to pay
interest would not be an acknowledgment as stated in Article 1
of the Schedule 1 (due to the proviso to said article) and since
the first document contained a promise to pay, the document
stands excluded as an acknowledgment.
18.

Counsel for the plaintiff urged that intention of the

parties is the test to be applied and if intention was not to
create a promissory note, notwithstanding the language of the
document, the same had to be treated as on acknowledgment
or a receipt or a promise to repay a loan.
19.

Various authorities, as noted in the order impugned

were cited by the learned counsel for the parties.
20.

I need not note the various authorities which were

cited inasmuch as all dealt with a particular document (being
considered in the authority).

Each document had a different

language.
21.

No document considered in the authorities is pari

materia with the 3 documents with which I am concerned.
22.

Section 13 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881

CM(M) No.543/2005

page 7 of 14

reads as under:“13. “Negotiable instrument”.- (1) A “negotiable
instrument” means a promissory note, bill of
exchange or cheque payable either to order or to
bearer.
Explanation (i)- A promissory note, bill of
exchange or cheque is payable to order which is
expressed to be so payable or which is expressed
to be payable to a particular person, and does not
contain words prohibiting transfer or indicating an
intention that it shall not be transferable.
Explanation (ii)- A promissory note, bill of
exchange or cheque is payable to bearer which is
expressed to be so payable or on which the only
or last indorsement is an indorsement in blank.
Explanation (iii)- Where a promissory note, bill
of exchange or cheque, either originally or by
indorsement, is expressed to be payable to the
order of a specified person, and not to him or his
order, it is nevertheless payable to him or his
order at his option.
(2)
A negotiable instrument may be made
payable to two or more payees jointly, or it may be
payable in the alternative to one of two, or one or
some of several payees.”
A perusal of Section 4 read with Section 13 of the

23.

Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 reveals that in order to be a
promissory note, a document must conform to the following
conditions:(a)

it should be in writing,

CM(M) No.543/2005

page 8 of 14

(b)

it must contain an unconditional undertaking by
the maker of the document,

(c)

such unconditional undertaking must be to pay
certain sum of money to a certain person or to the
order of that person or to the bearer of the
instrument; and

(d)
24.

the maker should sign it.
Explanation 1 to Section 13 of the Negotiable

Instruments Act 1881 envisages that if the document conforms
to the aforesaid conditions and if the document bears no words
prohibiting transfer or indicating the intention that it will not be
transferred, the document must be deemed to be negotiable.
No specific form is noted, except that the document should be
in such a form that it should be ordinarily acceptable by a man
of commerce to be a promissory note, intended to be
negotiable.

25.

A comparison of the definition of a promissory note as

defined vide sub-section 22 of Section 2 of the Indian Stamp
Act 1899 and the definition of a promissory note as defined
CM(M) No.543/2005

page 9 of 14

under Section 4 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 read
with the definition of a negotiable instruments as defined in
Section 13 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 reveals that
the definition of a promissory note in the Indian Stamp Act
1899, for the purposes of stamp duty, is wider than the
definition

of

a

promissory

note

under

the

Negotiable

Instruments Act 1881, but it is only to the extent that in order
to fall within the extended meaning, a document should be a
promissory note in all respects except for the contingencies
affecting the payment in the 2 cases envisaged in the proviso
( to Article 1) in the ordinary mercantile sense.
26.

The extended meaning only extends to a document

(a) which includes a promise to pay the sum named out of
particular funds, such amount may or may not be available
with the fund or (b) where promise to pay a sum depends upon
happening of condition or contingency which may or may not
happen. When payment is not dependent upon any condition
envisaged above, the inclusive definition does not become
operative.
27.

In the decision reported as AIR 1936 PC 171 Nawab

CM(M) No.543/2005

page 10 of 14

Major Sir Mohammad Akbar Khan vs. Attar Singh, it was
observed as under:“If this document is otherwise within the definition
of a promissory note, it would seem that it must be
negotiable, for there appear to be no words
prohibiting transfer, or indicating an intention that
it should not be transferable.”
“Their Lordships prefer to decide this point on the
broad ground that such a document as this is not,
and could not be, intended to be brought within a
definition relating to documents which are to be
negotiable instruments.
Such documents must
come into existence for the purpose only of
recording an agreement to pay money and nothing
more, though, of course, they may state the
consideration. Receipts and agreements generally
are not intended to be negotiable, and serious
embarrassment would be caused in commerce if
the negotiable net were cast too wide.
This
document plainly is a receipt for money, containing
the terms on which it is to be repaid. It is not
without significance that the defendants who drew
it, and who were experienced moneylenders, did
not draw it on paper with an impressed stamp, as
they would have had to if the document were a
promissory note and that they affected a stamp
which is sufficient if the document is a simple
receipt. Being primarily a receipt, even if coupled
with a promise to pay, it is not a promissory note.”
28.

From the aforesaid decision, it is apparent that

notwithstanding that a document contains a promise to pay but
if it is primarily intended to be a receipt and not intended to be

CM(M) No.543/2005

page 11 of 14

negotiable in the ordinary mercantile sense, the document
does not become a promissory note within the meaning of the
Negotiable Instruments Act 1881.
29.

In the said decision, affixation of a stamp sufficient for

a receipt by men of business was taken to be a relevant
consideration of great importance in gathering the intention of
the parties.
30.

Noting the decision in Akbar Khan's case, in the

decision reported as AIR 1938 PC 121 Lala Karam Chand vs.
Firm Mian Mir Ahmad Aziz Ahmad, considering a document
which reads as under:“Received from you this 5th day of Asuj, 1986,
Sambat corresponding to 20th September, 1929, a
cheque for Rs.10,000/- drawn by you on Messrs.
Grindlay & Co., Ltd., Peshawar. The amount would
be repaid with interest thereon at the rate of Rs.114-0 p.c. Time ten months. The principal amount will
be paid with interest after ten months from this
date.”
it was held that the document was not a promissory
note but a mere receipt.
31.

As I read the law, to be labelled as a promissory note,

not only must the document be negotiable and not only should
it satisfy the 4 requirements referred to in para 23 above, the
CM(M) No.543/2005

page 12 of 14

document must pass 3 further tests, namely: (a) the promise to
pay must be the substance of the instrument, (b) there must be
nothing else inconsistent with the character of the document as
substantially a promise to pay, and (c) the instrument must be
intended by the parties to be a promissory note.
32.

In order to find out whether a particular document is a

promissory note or not, the intention of the parties at the time
of execution of the document is to be looked into with
reference to the substance of the document, the surrounding
circumstances in which the document has been executed and
its negotiability in the popular sense, whether the document
was intended to be a promissory note or was intended to be a
mere acknowledgment of a debt or receipt of consideration.
This is a question of fact in each case and requires to be so
interpreted and determined with reference to the backdrop
facts constituting the transaction.
33.

The first writing dated 22.10.1991 contains an

acknowledgment

of

having

received

a

loan

in

sum

of

Rs.25,000/-. No doubt, the latter part of the document contains
a promise but records the same to be a promise to pay back
CM(M) No.543/2005

page 13 of 14

the loan. It records a rate of interest at which the loan was
advanced.
34.

The dominant intention of the document is to be

receipt.
35.

The second document executed on 6.6.1994 is an

acknowledgment of the loan received under the document
executed on 22.10.1991 coupled with an undertaking to repay
the same.
36.

The

third

document

dated

4.11.1996

undertaking to repay the loan of Rs.25,000/-.

is

an

It contains a

request that the interest be waived.
37.

I therefore hold in favour of the plaintiffs.

The

impugned order dated 15.1.2005 is set aside.
38.

On paying the requisite stamp duty as also the

penalty, the documents in question would be treated as
admissible in evidence.
39.

No costs.
