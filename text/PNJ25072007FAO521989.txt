PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

The four captioned appeals and three cross

objections arise out of the same accident involving a bus
bearing No. DEP-2800.
2.

On 26.11.1982, an unfortunate accident had

occurred when a car bearing No. DEA-3007 and bus bearing
No. DEP-2800 collided with each other.
3.

There were 4 passengers travelling in the car. As

FAO. No. 52/1989

Page 2 of 14

a result of the said accident, 3 passengers namely Anand
Shivpuri, Sunil, Gopal Singh sustained injuries while 4th
passenger P.S.Ramanathan died.
4.

Dependents of the deceased, P.S.Ramanathan

filed a claim petition claiming compensation on account of
death of the deceased in the said road accident. Injured also
filed claim petitions claiming compensation.

All the claim

petitions were consolidated and tried together by the
Tribunal.
5.

Defence raised by the insurance company was

that the policy issued in respect of bus was a statutory policy
and as per Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939, it's
liability under the policy was limited to the extent of
Rs.50,000/- only.
6.

After

considering

the

evidence

on

record

pertaining to the accident and holding that the accident in
question was caused due to rash and negligent driving by
the driver of the bus No. DEP-2800, learned Tribunal
awarded compensation to the dependents of the deceased
as also to the injured.

Defence of the insurance company

that it's liability was limited to the extent of Rs.50,000/- was
rejected by the learned Tribunal as it was held that onus to
FAO. No. 52/1989

Page 3 of 14

prove that the policy was a statutory policy only was upon
the insurance company and that it had failed to prove the
same.
7.

FAO.

Nos.

52/1989,

53/1989,

54/1989

and

55/1989 are the appeals filed by the insurance company
challenging the award dated 24.11.1988 in so far it
determines that the liability of the insurance company is
unlimited.
8.

Learned Counsel for the appellant insurance

company submitted that the Tribunal erred in not restricting
the liability of the insurance company to Rs.50,000/- only.
9.

Learned counsel for the appellant relied upon

testimony of R.K.Mehra, Assitant Manager, United India
Insurance Company, RW-1 in support of his contention that
the liability of the insurance company limited to the extent of
Rs.50,000/- only.
10.

Bhajan Singh, RW-1 produced a photocopy of a

policy of insurance (Ex.R-1) and deposed that the said copy
was a photocopy of the office policy (carbon copy) issued in
respect of bus No. DEP-2800.
11.

Learned counsel for the appellant contented that

the Tribunal failed to appreciate the testimony of the
FAO. No. 52/1989

Page 4 of 14

R.K.Mehra, RW-1 which according to the learned counsel
clearly proved that the policy issued by the insurance
company was a statutory policy. He further contended that
in absence of any evidence to show that an extra premium
was charged by the insurance company to cover risk to a
larger extent, the learned Tribunal erred in holding that the
liability of the insurance company is unlimited.
12.

The

question

is

whether

R.K.Mehra,

RW-1

successfully proved that the policy of insurance (Ex.R-1)
produced by him was the photocopy of the original policy
issued by the insurance company.
13.

I have perused the testimony of R.K.Mehra, RW-1.

14.

R.K.Mehra, RW-1 admitted in cross examination

that he had no personal knowledge regarding the original
policy issued by the insurance company.
15.

R.K.Mehra, RW-1 deposed that no extra premium

was charged for covering the third party risk. But later in
cross examination, he stated that extra premium was
charged.
16.

As

regards

insurance

company's

failure

to

produce office copy and other records pertaining to issue of
insurance cover in respect of insurance cover, R.K.Mehra,
FAO. No. 52/1989

Page 5 of 14

RW-1 deposed that he had no knowledge about the same.
He stated that he had no knowledge whether office copy was
destroyed or not.
17.

I also note that no notice was served by the

insurance company calling upon the owner of the offending
bus to produce the original policy.
18.

The above circumstances compel me to draw an

adverse inference against the insurance company. I am in
perfect agreement with the finding of the learned Tribunal
that appellant insurance company failed to prove that Ex.R-1
was a photocopy of the office copy of the policy of insurance.
More so, when the witness failed to explain as to from which
copy Ex.R-1 was photocopied.
19.

In the decision reported as National Insurance Co.

Ltd. Vs. Jugal Kishore & Ors. AIR 1988 SC 719, Supreme
Court made it imperative for the insurance companies to
establish the

insurance policy by placing on record office

copy of the policy in so far as third party claims are
concerned.

In para 10 of the report, it was observed as

under :“10. Before parting with the case, we consider it
necessary to refer to the attitude often adopted by
the Insurance Companies, as was adopted even in
FAO. No. 52/1989

Page 6 of 14

20.

this case, of not filing a copy of the policy before
the Tribunal and even before the High Court in
appeal. In this connection what is of significance is
that the claimants for compensation under the Act
are invariably not possessed of either the policy or
a copy thereof.
This Court has consistently
emphasised that it is the duty of the party which is
in possession of a document which would be helpful
in doing justice in the cause to produce the said
document and such party should not be permitted
to take shelter behind the abstract doctrine of
burden of proof. This duty is greater in the case if
instrumentalities of the State such as the appellant
who are under an obligation to act fairly. In many
cases even the owner of the vehicle for reasons
known to him does not choose to produce the
policy or a copy thereof. We accordingly wish to
emphasise
that in all such cases where the
Insurance Company concerned wishes to take a
defence in claim petition that its liability is not in
excess of the statutory liability along with its
defence.”
I, therefore, dismiss FAO. Nos.52/89, 53/89, 54/89

and 55/89.
21.

Vide CM.No.1730/1989 in FAO.No.53/89 claimants

of the deceased P.S.Ramanathan seek enhancement of the
compensation.
22.

I note that compensation in sum of Rs.2,34,000/-

has been granted to the dependents of the deceased
P.S.Ramanathan by the Tribunal.
23.

Deceased was aged 44 years at the time of the

accident.

He was survived by a widow, 2 minor children,

aged 15 years and 12 years. Deceased was employed as a
FAO. No. 52/1989

Page 7 of 14

photographer. He was employed as cameraman (Grade-I)
with Madras Doordarshan Kendra. The last drawn salary of
the deceased was Rs.2,147/- p.m.
24.

Tribunal

has

taken

monthly

income

of

the

deceased as Rs.2,147/-. Deducting 1/3rd towards personal
spending of the deceased, loss of dependence worked out
to the family is Rs.1500/- p.m.
25.

Multiplier of 13 has been applied. Thus, total loss

of dependency to the family assessed by the Tribunal is
Rs.2,34,000/-. (Rs.1500 x 12 x 13).
26.

A perusal of the award together with evidence led

by the claimants shows that while determining loss of
dependency, the Tribunal erred in ignoring the prospects of
future increase in the income of the deceased.
27.

In order to establish future prospects of the

deceased, claimants examined Shri R.Logananda, Deputy
Director (Admn.), Doordarshan Kendra, Madras, PW-11.
Said witness brought service record of the deceased.
(Ex.PW-11/2.) On the basis of said record, witness deposed
that had the deceased lived, he would have been promoted
to the post of Video Executive and would have drawn a
salary of Rs.3,650.50 p.m. at the time of his retirement.
FAO. No. 52/1989

Page 8 of 14

28.

I see no reason to disbelieve the testimony of PW-

11.
29.

Ample evidence was produced before the Tribunal

to show the salary which the deceased would have drawn
from time to time but it was not taken into consideration by
the

Tribunal

while

calculating

compensation

which

is

contrary to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
decision reported as Sarla Dixit & Anr. Vs. Balwant Yadav &
Ors. AIR 1996 SC 1274.
30.

Therefore, I take that the salary of the deceased

would have been Rs.3,650/- p.m. at the time of his
retirement.

Mean average income of the deceased comes

to Rs.2,898/- p.m. (Rs.2147 + Rs.3650 ÷ 2).
31.

Deducting 1/3rd towards personal spending of the

deceased, loss of dependence comes to Rs.1,932/- p.m.
32.

I maintain the multiplier 13 applied by the

Tribunal. I note the decision reported as Abati Bezbaruah v
Deputy Director General Geological Survey of India, I (2003)
ACC 352 (SC) in which Supreme Court applied multiplier 15
in case of deceased aged 41 years.
33.

Applying multiplier 13, total loss of dependence

comes to Rs.3,01,392/-. (Rs.1932 x 12 x 13).
FAO. No. 52/1989

Noting that no compensation was awarded to the

claimants towards loss of consortium, loss of love and
affection

and

I

award

Rs.17,000/-.

conventional

Thus,

the

total

compensation payable comes to Rs.3,18,392/-.
35.

Tribunal has awarded compensation in sum of

Rs.2,34,000/-. Thus, compensation stands enhanced by a
sum of Rs.84,392/-.
36.

CM No.1730/1989 in FAO.No.53/89 is disposed of

as under :(i)

Compensation

is

enhanced

by

a

sum

of

Rs.84,392/-.
(ii)

Enhanced compensation be paid together with

interest @ 9% p.a. from date of claim petition till realization.
(cross objections were filed in the year 1989. Between the
years 1989 to 2007 interest rates have fluctuated between
14% p.a. to 5.5% p.a.)
(iii)

Apportionment of enhanced compensation be as

per the award.
37.

Sunil Kumar has challenged the compensation awarded to
him. He is dissatisfied by the quantum of the compensation.

compensation in sum of Rs.83,062.50 to the injured.

Injured Sunil Kumar was aged 26 years at the

time of the accident.

As a result of the accident, injured

suffered right thigh fracture, fracture of right femur, head
injury, injuries on right ear, right cheek, face, right side of
neck, and fingers of both hands. There is evidence of three
spells of hospitalization. There is evidence that he remained
under treatment for a period of around 8 months. His right
leg was shortened by ¼ inch.

He suffered permanent

disability to the extent of 45%.

40.

A perusal of the award together with nature of

FAO. No. 52/1989

Page 11 of 14

injuries, period

of treatment show that compensation

awarded to injured Sunil is wanting in three areas namely,
compensation for permanent disability, pain and suffering
and loss of amenities of life. I note that no compensation
under the latter head has been awarded by the Tribunal.
Keeping in view the injuries sustained by Sunil Kumar and
the permanently disability suffered

by him,

I consider it

reasonable to award a further compensation in sum of
Rs.50,000/- to the injured, Sunil. It is directed that enhanced
compensation be paid together with interest at 9% per
annum from date of claim petition till date of realization.
41.

.....

Rs.8100/-

(ii)

.....

Rs.4210/-

(vii)

....

Rs.20,000/-

(viii)

Loss of future income

....

Rs. 5,000/-

43.

The total of aforenoted compensation comes to

Rs.68,810/-.

However, while awarding total compensation,

Tribunal failed to list compensation of Rs.8100/- awarded
under the head 'Loss of Salary for laid off period' and thus
wrongly awarded compensation in sum of Rs.60,710/-.
44.

Injured Gopal was aged 24 years and was working

as a driver at the time of the accident. As a result of the said
accident, he suffered head injury, fracture of right femur and
humorous. His right leg remained under plaster for a period
of 3 months. Due to mal-uniting of fracture, his right leg has
shortened by half inch and he limps while walking.

He

suffered permanent disability to the extent of 40%.
45.

I note that no compensation has been awarded

under the head 'Loss of Amenities of Life'.

Compensation

under the said head is granted when life of an injured is
significantly impaired by the injury. Considering that the
injured limps while walking, I award further compensation in
sum of Rs.20,000/- to the injured.
46.

I

correct the award by listing the sum of

Rs.8100/- which due to a listing error was not granted by the
FAO. No. 52/1989

compensation is enhanced by a sum of

Rs.28,100/-. Enhanced compensation be paid together with

realization.
