March, 2007 of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (for short as
Tribunal), Delhi Bench „E‟ in ITA No.89/Del/2005 relevant
for the Assessment Year 1998-1999 has filed this appeal.
2.

The brief facts of this case are that Assessee who is

engaged in the business of manufacturing of steel ingots,
filed a return of income on 29th September, 1999 showing
„Nil‟ income from business and profession. The Assessing
Officer assessed the income of Assessee at Rs.1,09,19,779/wherein he disallowed cash credit, wrote off liabilities and
added the same to the income of the Assessee liable to tax.
3.

Aggrieved with the order passed by the Assessing

Officer, the Assessee filed an appeal before Commissioner
of Income Tax (Appeal) (CIT(A) for short) and CIT (A)
deleted the addition on account of cash credits made by the
Assessing Officer and further disallowed the addition of
Rs.73,36,374/- made by the Assessing Officer on account of
brought forward balance of unsecured loans on the ground
that there was cessation of business.

4.

The Assessee thereafter filed an application for

rectification under Section 154 of the Act claiming that CIT
(A) had not considered brought forward depreciation which
forms part of brought forward losses and which had been
assessed in the past. The Assessee contended that brought
forward unabsorbed depreciation must be allowed even if
the business is discontinued.
5.

The CIT (A) rectified order dated 7th March, 2002 and

allowed the carry forward depreciation.
6.

The Revenue challenged the order of CIT (A) allowing

the application of Assessee under Section 154 of the Act
before the Tribunal and vide impugned order, the Tribunal
dismissed the appeal of the Revenue.
7.

Thus, the Revenue is before this Court.

8.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

Revenue that the order of the CIT(A) rectifying its order is
erroneous in as much as it allows deduction in respect of
unabsorbed depreciation even though Assessee never

Page 3 of 5

claimed depreciation and the same was never adjudicated
upon by the Assessing Authorities and due to amendment
in Section 32(2) of the Act read with first proviso, w.e.f
Assessment Year 1997-98, it is necessary that the Assessee
continues the same business.
9.

The Tribunal in the impugned order has held that:“The claim for unabsorbed depreciation is a
matter of record for which no factual finding is
necessary. Thus, after computing the income,
the Assessee is always entitled to claim for set
off of unabsorbed depreciation. This claim is
admissible whether the Assessee carry on the
same business or not.”

10.
that

Since there is a finding of fact given by the Tribunal
the

Assessee

was

having

certain

unabsorbed

depreciation and the claim is admissible whether the
Assessee carry on the same business or not, we do not find
any infirmity in the impugned judgment passed by the
Tribunal.
11.

The above being the position, no fault can be found

with the view taken by the Tribunal. Thus, the order of the

ITA No.95/2008

Page 4 of 5

Tribunal does not give rise to a question of law, much less
a substantial question of law, to fall within the limited
purview of Section 260-A of the Act, which is confined to
entertaining only such appeal against the order which
involves a substantial question of law. The present appeal
filed by the Revenue is thus hereby dismissed.
