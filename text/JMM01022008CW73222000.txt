1.
This judgment shall dispose of the above said two writ
petitions as both are inter linked and are based on similar facts
and common questions of law.
2.

The petitioner union is espousing the cause of the 36

workmen/trainees

belonging

to

West

Bengal

workmen/trainees belonging to Amritsar, Punjab.

and

46

Every trainee

on whose behalf the abovesaid two writ petitions are preferred
have filed separate court fee for each of them at the time of filing
of present petitions. According to the petitioners the writs were
filed under its name without undergoing the rig morale of
impleading all the trainees / workmen separately as petitioners
and making the memo of parties cumbersome.

M/s Hindustan

Vegetable Oils Corporation Ltd. (to be referred as HVOC
hereinafter) was originally known as Ganesh Flour Mills.

This

company is wholly owned by the Government, which was
acquired by the Central Government, under the Ordinanace,
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 3 of 19

1984, which was published in the Gazette of India on 28.01.1984.
It was renamed as Hindustan Vegetable Oils Corporation Ltd. The
respondent no. 2 has 11 factories spread all over India. The first
writ is filed by the employees of West Bengal and the second writ
is filed by employees of Amritsar. In September 1987, respondent
nos. 2 & 3 took for employment 36 workmen on contract basis at
their

office

located

in

West

Bengal

having

its

office

at

Narasinghapur, Chhota Jagulia, Barasat, North 24 Parganas. The
said workmen continued to remain on contract basis till 1990
without any break in their service.

On 21.02.1990 the said

workmen were taken as casual workmen by respondents nos. 2 &
3 for working in its factory run by respondent no. 3. The status of
workmen continued to remain as that of casual workmen till the
year 1995. Since the workmen had already completed 240 days
of employment without any break, therefore, the management
was requested to regularise their service.
3.

As the respondents failed to take any action, therefore, the

petitioner union initiated conciliation proceedings before the
Labour Commission, Barasat, West Bengal. The Assistant Labour
Commissioner, vide his order dated 09.09.1992, observed that it
was resolved at the joint conference that the local management
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 4 of 19

would write to the corporate body at New Delhi regarding
regularisation of casual labourers in HVOC Ltd as per the statute
i.e. on the basis of their employment with them for more than 240
days at a stretch and a copy of such correspondence would be
forwarded to the concerned union to pursue the matter from their
level also. However, on the contrary, the respondents changed
the status of the above said workmen from “casual” to that of
“trainees”

w.e.f.

01.09.1995.

Despite

the

fact

that

the

respondents continuously put in service for more than 13 years,
they were paid remuneration by way of monthly stipend of a sum
of Rs.3,050/- only, but, the permanent employees used to draw a
gross salary of Rs.5,700/-.
4.

The petitioner union again initiated conciliation proceedings

before the office of Assistant Labour Commissioner, Barasat,
Government of West Bengal for demanding the regularisation of
above 36 trainees.

Conciliation Officer vide order dated

18.11.1996 came to the conclusion that there existed no logic in
retaining these trainees as trainees beyond 31.08.1996 depriving
thereby from their legitimate benefits as or being enjoyed by
other regular / permanent workmen of the said organisation. He
advised the representative of the management to take up the
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 5 of 19

matter with the appropriate authority for defusing such difference
in status of the trainees and the regulars. Respondent no. 3 vide
his letter dated 21.11.1996 assured the petitioner union that the
suggestion of Additional Labour Commissioner would be complied
with.

On 11.03.1997 respondent no. 2 also recommended

regularisation of the above said trainees to respondent no.1 but
the needful could not be done. Vide order dated 25.02.1999 Mr.
R.K.

Shah,

Additional

Labour

Commissioner,

West

Bengal

impressed upon the respondents to consider the case of the
workmen and take appropriate steps for giving due relief to those
workmen.

He also directed the representative of the local

management to attend the next meeting on 15.03.1999 so as to
finally resolve the matter. On 21.01.1999 the union sent a letter
to the respondent no. 1 and demanded the regularisation of 36
trainee workmen.

On 12.02.1999 respondent no. 3 gave them

assurance that their matter will be considered favourably.
Another representation was sent on 29.09.2000.
5.

In the meantime, the respondents floated a Voluntary

Retirement Scheme (VRS) inviting proposal from the workmen
who were interested to avail the said Scheme, but that was not
made applicable to the trainees. It was made clear that those
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 6 of 19

employees, who did not avail the Scheme would be retrenched.
6.

Now I turn to the Facts of WP(C) No.373/2001. Respondent

no. 2 took the employment of 46 workmen on contract basis in
September 1982.

The said workmen were taken as casual

workmen working in its factory run by respondent no. 3 in
Amritsar, Punjab.

The status of those workmen continued to

remain as that of casual workmen till the year 1992. The status
of workmen changed from that of casual workmen to trainees and
they were paid stipend of Rs.3,050/- P.M. only as against
Rs.5700/-

P.M.

for

demanding the regularisation of their service.

On 23.09.1993

respondent no. 3 sent a recommendation to respondent no. 2 for
regularising the service of these trainee workmen. Respondent
no. 2 did not take any action.

On 04.11.1993 petitioner union

made a representation by sending a letter to the respondent no. 1
for regularisation of 46 trainee workmen. Another representation
was

made

on

20.09.1995.

Respondent

no.

3

strongly

recommended for regularisation of the service of these trainees
by sending a letter to respondent no. 2, but no action was taken.
On 06.10.1997 workmen initiated conciliation proceedings. The
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 7 of 19

Senior Officer of respondent no. 3 attended the hearing wherein
he was directed by the conciliation officer to take immediate
steps for regularisation of service of the trainee workmen.
Another representation was made on 10.11.1997.

The trainee

workmen approached the Labour Officer on 20.05.2000.

On

31.10.2000 BIFR appointed IDBI as Operating Agency to give the
Revival Scheme of various factory units of respondent nos. 2 & 3
by 28.02.2001.

On 10.11.2000 the respondents floated a

Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) inviting proposal from the
permanent / regular workmen only.

The said Scheme was

operative till 08.02.2001.
7.

Under these circumstances the present writ petitions were

filed with the following similar prayers :
“(a) order, writ of certiorari/mandamus or any other
writ or direction against the respondents jointly and
severally and directing them not to discriminate and
create disparity in conditions of service, status and
wages between the “trainee” workmen who are
similarly situated to the permanent / regular workmen;
(b) direct the respondents to regularise the service of
the 36 or 46 “trainee” workmen whose details are
given in Annexure “C” hereto with effect from
01.01.1991 and from 1983;
(c) direct payment of all arrears including all the
consequential benefits attached to their course of
employment as regular workmen commensurative with
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 8 of 19

the respective post and work done by the said
“trainee” in the period with effect from 01.01.1991 and
1993 till date alongwith interest @24% per annum;
(d) direct the respondents to extend the benefits under
the VRS and VSS to these 36 or 46 “trainee” workmen
also, if they so desire; and

8.

(e) pass such other order or orders as this Hon'ble
Court may deem fit and proper in the circumstances of
the case.”
The respondents have contested the present petitions.

9.

I have heard the counsel for the parties and considered their

written submissions. First of all, they have locked horns over the
question of jurisdiction. The learned counsel for the respondent
argued with vehemence that this court does not have territorial
jurisdiction.

He pointed out that the above said workers /

trainees were appointed in West Bengal and Amritsar only. The
association had invoked the jurisdiction of Labour Department in
West Bengal.

It is pointed out that the cause of action had

accrued in those places only. Consequently, High Courts of those
places only have the territorial jurisdiction. In support of his case
he has cited authorities reported in Vinod Kumar Vs. UOI, 135
(2006) DLT 414 (DB), ONGC Vs. Utpal Kumar, 1994 Z(4) SCC 711
and State of Rajasthan Vs. Swastika Properties, AIR 1985 SC
1289.

WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 9 of 19

10.

For the following reasons I do not find myself amenable to

these arguments. The authorities cited by the respondent have
no parallels with the facts of the present cases. The facts which
go to distinguish the instant case with the above cited cases are
enumerated as follows. First of all, M/s Hindustan Vegetable Oils
Corporation Ltd. has its head office at 64-65, Satguru Ram Singh
Marg,

Industrial Area, Kirti Nagar, New Delhi. Its Chairman-

cum-Managing Director and the General Manager who have been
arrayed as respondent nos. 2 & 3 are stationed at New Delhi.
Again Ministry of Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution,
Department of Food and Public Distribution (HVOC) is also based
in New Delhi. Section 12 of the above said Ordinance which was
published in the Gazette of India on 28.01.1984 provides :
“12(1) every person who has been immediately before
the appointed date, employed by the company in
connection with the Ganesh Flour Mills shall become
(a) On and from the appointed day, an employee of
the Central Government, and
(b) Where the Ganesh Flour Mills is directed, under
sub-section (1) of Section 5, to vest in a Government
company, an employee of that company on and from
the date of such vesting.”
It is thus clear that the petitioners are the employees of the
Central Government.
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 10 of 19

11.

Again, as already stated above the Additional Labour

Commissioner, West Bengal vide his order dated 25.02.1999
issued directions to the respondent no. 2 based in Delhi. Letter
dated 11.03.1997 shows that respondent no. 2 had sent a letter
to respondent no. 1 regarding the issue of regularization of above
said trainee workmen.

Letter dated 12.02.1999 sent by

respondent no. 2 to unit Incharge Kolkata reveals that assurance
was given that the conditions of service of the trainee workmen
would be brought in parity to the permanent workmen.

The

above said VSS was also floated under the directions of
respondent no. 1. The competent authority to consider the VSS is
respondent no. 2 himself. It is apparent that cause of action also
arose at New Delhi.
12.

Again, it must be borne in mind that the above said two writ

petitions were filed in the year 2000. After the lapse of 8 years it
will not be proper to hold that this court has no jurisdiction to try
this case. A Division Bench of this Court in a case reported in
135 (2006) DLT 414, was pleased to observe:
“We have already noticed that expeditious
disposal is one of the underlining features of
the amended provisions of Article 226 and
to ensure balancing of convenience between
the parties to the lis, it may be appropriate
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 11 of 19

that the Courts determine the question of
jurisdiction at the very threshold of the
proceedings. Proper exercise of jurisdiction
would ex facie take in its ambit remedies
which are effective and efficacious. If both
or any of these ingredients are not satisfied,
it would be a factor which will tilt the view of
the Court against exercising its jurisdiction.
The Court is expected to deal with the issue
of jurisdiction right at the initial stages and
normally while taking the petition as framed
to be correct. Article 226 (2) opens with the
words 'The power conferred by Clause (1) to
issue directions.....' which clearly indicates
amplification of jurisdiction and that the
provision is meant to aid the powers vested
in the High Court for issuance of writ, order
or direction located within their territorial
jurisdiction.
The expression 'may also'
would have to be given their true meaning
while ensuring that such connotations are in
consonance with the law enunciated by the
Supreme
Court
and
also
spirit
of
constitutional territorial jurisdiction of a High
Court.”
Consequently, I clap no importance to this objection raised
by the respondent.
13.

The key argument urged by the counsel for the respondent

was that this is an indisputable fact that units at Kolkata and
Amritsar are lying closed.

The BIFR declared it as a sick unit,

therefore, there is no question of regularisation.

It was further

argued that when the organisation is in a very precarious financial
condition it cannot be further burdened with financial burden.

WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 12 of 19

14.

The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that this

objection is not sustainable. It was submitted that it came out
from the horse's mouth itself as the management of the
respondent itself admitted that these trainee workmen were
required to be regularised forthwith i.e. after the lapse of one
year from the date of their appointment as temporary workmen.
My attention was drawn towards an authority reported in Food
Corporation of India Vs. Shayamal K. Chatterji, AIR 2000 SC 3554,
wherein it was held that casual workers doing same jobs which
are done by permanent employees are entitled to wages at par
with such employees.

Learned counsel for the petitioner cited

another authority reported in Surya Narain Yadav Vs. Bihar State
Electricity Board, AIR 1985 SC 1941 wherein it was held that
regularization of trainee engineers who were on pay rolls for a
long time and where the management treated them as a specific
class was equitable and mandamus was issued directing the
Board to regularize these trainee engineers.
15.

It was also argued that the petitioners are neither contract

employees or casual labourers but temporary workmen. The socalled trainee workmen were bound to be regularized after the
lapse of one year from the date of their appointment as trainees
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 13 of 19

as per Secretary, State of Karnataka Vs. Uma Devi and ors, AIR
2006 SC 1806, para 53 makes it abundantly clear that in case of
workmen who have worked for ten years or more are to be
regularized as one time measure. It was pointed out that these
trainee workmen are on the pay rolls of the respondents for more
than 30 years when they were taken as contract workmen. They
are working for their for last more than ten years.

It was also

argued that rather than addressing them as temporary workmen
by way of nomenclature they were designated as trainees. It was
further argued that the work trainee is not to be understood as it
appears

in

ordinary

peralance

as

defined

under

the

Apprenticeship Act, nor it was so ever understood by the
management itself.

The above said workmen who were

admittedly doing the same work as permanent workmen except
for their wages were provided the same facilities and benefits like
permanent workmen i.e. as PF, ESI, earned leave, bonus, gift,
canteen facilities etc. It was pointed out that the Supreme Court
has deprecated giving same nomenclature to the temporary
workmen

in

the

case

of

Mineral

Exploration

Corporation

Employees Union Vs. Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd., 2006
(6) SCC 310.
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 14 of 19

16.

It was brought to the notice of this Court that the petitioners

had sought specific directions / permission from the company
court to further prosecute the present writ petitions.

Mr. V.K.

Shali the counsel for the respondents himself appeared before the
Company Judge and gave his no objection on the applications
moved by the petitioners. The respondents are now represented
through Official Liquidator being represented by Mr. V.K. Shali
himself. He further argued that under the Companies Act at the
time of winding up, the wages of the workers have to be taken
into account for discharge of liabilities of the company to be
wound up which can be realised through sales of assets including
movable and immovable properties of the company.

The

respondent company has several immovable properties spread all
over India. The issue which remains is the payment of the arrears
of the trainee workmen by considering them to be at par with the
permanent workmen and to direct the implementation of VRS and
VSS already floated by the respondents.

According to the

petitioner the entire controversy hinges on the mandatory
benefits in terms of arrears of wages and compensation under
VRS and VSS to which these workmen are entitled to. In case this
court holds that all these trainee workmen are entitled to arrears
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 15 of 19

of wages and compensation under VSS or VRS on revised wages,
it is for the Official Liquidator to consider the mandatory claims of
the workmen along with other secured creditors of the company
and to discharge the same out of the available assets of the
company. The respondents are now thus not even to incur any
liability for the payment of these wages out of their own pockets.
17.

All these questions were answered by the Apex Court in a

recent authority, which I was able to locate and which is reported
in Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. Workmen, Indian
Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2007) 1 SCC 408. The facts of the
case are given in para no. 2, which is reproduced as follows :
“2. This appeal has been filed against the impugned
judgment and order dated 30.09.2005 passed by the
Uttaranchal High Court in WP No. 3360 of 2001. By
that judgment the High Court has modified the award
of the Labour Court, U.P., Dehradun, to the extent
that the workmen, in whose favour the award had
been made, were allowed to be continued in the
service of the appellant employer till their
superannuation, and if their services were not
required they should not be terminated except in
accordance with industrial law.
The High Court
further directed that the workmen in question should
be paid wages like the regular employees performing
the work and duties in the appellant Company.”
While relying upon Secretary, State of Karnataka and Ors.
Vs. Uma Devi and Ors.(Supra) and various other authorities the
Apex Court was pleased to hold :
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 16 of 19

“In Rajendra v. State of Rajasthan, (1999) 2 SCC 317
this Court following its own decision in Delhi
Development Horticulture Employees Union v. Delhi
Administration, Delhi, (1992) 4 SCC 99 held that the
right to livelihood was found not feasible to be
incorporated as a fundamental right in the
Constitution and therefore employment was also not
guaranteed under the Constitutional scheme.
In
Sandeep Kumar v. State of U.P, 1993 Supp (1) SCC
525 this Court observed that where there was no work
in the project the employees cannot be regularized. In
State of Himachal Pradesh v. Ashwani Kumar, (1996) 1
SCC 773 this Court held that where a project has to be
closed down for non-availability of funds a direction to
regularize the displaced employees of the project
could not be given because such direction would
amount to creating posts and continuing them in spite
of non-availability of work. The same view was taken
in State of U.P v. U.P. Madhyamik Shiksha Parished
Shramik Sangh, (1996) 7 SCC 34. It follows from
these decisions that there is no legal right in
temporary employees (whether called casual, ad hoc,
or daily rated workers) to get absorption, or to be
continued in service or get regular pay.

18.

In the present case, the appellant is a sick company
which has been running on huge losses for many
years, and is practically closed down. There are no
vacancies on which the respondents could have been
appointed. While we may have sympathy with them,
we cannot ignore the hard economic realities, nor the
settled legal principles. The appeal is allowed.”
Moreover the case of the respondents draws further support

from a recent authority in case reference C.S. Azad Krishi Evam
Prodyogiki Vishwavidyalaya Vs. United Trades Congress and Anr.
decided on 13.12.2007 by the Apex Court, it was held :
“A feeble attempt, however, was made by the learned
WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 17 of 19

counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no. 2 to
state that he had been appointed against a permanent
vacancy. In his written statement, he did not raise any
such contention. It does not also appear from the
records that any offer of appointment was given to
him. It is inconceivable that an employee appointed
on a regular basis would not be given an offer of
appointment or shall not be placed on a scale of pay.
We, therefore, have no hesitation in proceeding on the
premise that respondent no. 2 was appointed on daily
wages. The Industrial Court in passing the impugned
award proceeded on the premise that respondent no.
2 had been working for more than 240 days
continuously from the date of his engagement. It is
now trite that the same by itself does not confer any
right upon a workman to be regularized in service.
Working for more than 240 days in a year was relevant
only for the purpose of application of Section 6N of the
UP Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 providing for
conditions precedent to retrench the workmen. It does
not speak of acquisition of a right by the workman to
be regularized in service.”
19.

In the light of these discussion it is found that the petitioner

are neither entitled to be regularized nor they are entitled to seek
salary provided to the regular employees.
20.

The respondents have also raised two other objections. The

first pertains to the availability of the alternative / efficacious
remedy of Labour Court Industrial Tribunal and secondly pertains
to the non-maintainability of the writ petitions filed by the trade
union and not by the workers themselves. In view of my findings

WP(C) Nos.7322/2000, 373/2001

Page 18 of 19

above, these objections pale into insignificance.

These hardly

require any adjudication from the court. In the result I find that
the petitions filed by the petitioners are meritless and the same
are therefore dismissed. However, there shall be no order as to
cost.
