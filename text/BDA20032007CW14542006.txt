BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.

In this writ petition, the order dated 17.01.2006 passed by Mr S.K.

Singh, Deputy Commissioner of Industries (Land), Government of NCT of
Delhi, Delhi has been impugned both on the grounds of lack of proper
procedure as well as on merits. At the outset, I may observe that the writ
petition is liable to be allowed on the first ground itself and, therefore, it would
not be necessary for me to examine the merits of the matter.

2.

Earlier, the petitioner had approached this court by way of filing a

writ petition [WPC 4280/1999] which was allowed by an order dated
14.01.2005. The petitioner was directed to appear in person or through a duly
authorised representative before the competent authority being Deputy
Secretary (Industries) on 28.02.2005 at 3.00 p.m. for further proceedings. By
virtue of the said order, the orders impugned in that writ petition were set aside
and the matter was remanded to the said competent authority to determine the
matter afresh in pursuance of the show cause notice dated 05.05.1998. The
order dated 14.01.2005 passed by this court also required the competent
authority to endeavour to complete the proceedings within a period of three
months.

3.

The only point urged on the procedural lapse or violation of

principles of natural justice on the part of the petitioner is that while the matter
was heard by the Deputy Secretary (Industries), the order which is impugned
herein was passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Industries (Land). The
simple point urged is that the authority which heard the petitioner is the one
which ought to have passed the order.

4.

It is obvious that the Deputy Commissioner of Industries who

passed the impugned order had not heard the petitioner. The admitted position
is that on 28.02.2005 and on 10.05.2005, personal hearing was granted to the

petitioner and he was heard by Ms Rashmi Krishnan, Deputy Secretary,
Industries (Land). However, the impugned order has been passed by Mr S.K.
Singh, Deputy Commissioner of Industries (Land). Clearly, the order has been
passed by the person who never heard the petitioner. On this ground alone, this
writ petition is liable to be allowed. The impugned order is accordingly set
aside. The matter is once again remanded to the competent authority [Deputy
Commissioner of Industries (Land)]. The petitioner shall appear before the said
authority on 16.04.2007 at 3.00 p.m. in the first instance. Since the matter has
been pending decision from the competent authority for one reason or the other
for a long time, it would be appropriate that the competent authority determines
the same as early as possible, but not later than eight weeks.

5.

It is, however, made clear that this court has not expressed any

opinion on the merits of the matter.
