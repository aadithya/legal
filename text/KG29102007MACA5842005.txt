KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:

Counsel for the appellant

contends that the

appellant is primarily aggrieved by the impugned award
on account of the fact that the injured in his deposition
has duly admitted that he had consumed alcohal in his
office before the occurrence of the accident, therefore,
the contributory negligence on the part of the injured
should have been taken more than 20% and of the
appellant less than 80%.
Another contention raised by the counsel for
the appellant is that the injured who was an employee
of the DVB was not entitled to any medical expenses.
I have heard counsel for the parties and have
perused the records.
It is correct that the injured respondent in his
cross-examination has admitted that before crossing the
road he had consumed alcohal in his office. However,
while admitting the said fact of consuming the alcohal,

he

was not under any kind of influence of the liquor and
was not unmindful

of

the traffic while walking on the

road, 3-4 feet away from the Patri.
Be that as it may, the case as set up by the
appellant before the Tribunal was that the injured was hit
by the Maruti Car

and not by the

It is an admitted case that no police

report was lodged against the Maruti Car and even the
registration number of the alleged Maruti Car was not
known to the driver of the offending vehicle.
The Tribunal in

the impugned award

has

made reference to the deposition of the respondent, his
cross-examination

as well as cross-examination of

R1W1, driver of the offending vehicle and after the
elaborate discussion on the said depositions, reached to
the conclusion that

for hitting the respondent. Perusal of the

only

Certified

copies of the criminal record were duly produced before
the Tribunal and same were exhibited as Ex.PW-4/23-28.
Based on the said

evidence and the criminal records,

the Tribunal gave the finding that presumption can be
easily drawn against the driver of the offending vehicle
who caused accident due to rash and negligent driving.
'Negligence' is a species of law of torts.
Accordingly, negligence
either

by

an

omission

is omission of duty caused
to

do

something

which

a

reasonable man guided upon those considerations, who
ordinarily by reason of conduct of human affairs would do
or be obligated to, or by doing something which a
prudent man would not do. Negligence means either
subjectively a careless state of mind, or objectively
careless conduct. Negligence can be either contributory

negligence or composite negligence. In the instance case
we are concerned with contributory negligence. The
question of contributory negligence arises when there
has been some act or omission on the claimants part,
which is materially contributed to the damage caused,
and is of such a nature that it may properly be described
as negligence. Where an accident is due to negligence of
both parties, substantially there would be contributory
negligence and both would be blamed. In a case of
contributory negligence, the crucial question on which
liability depends would be whether either party could, by
exercise

of

reasonable

care,

have

avoided

the

consequence of the other’s negligence. Whichever party
could have avoided the consequence of the other’s
negligence would be liable for the accident. In the instant
case on perusal of the award and after going into the
reasoning of the Tribunal, it is clear that the question of
contributory negligence does not arise.

The Tribunal in the award

There is no ground to interfere.
