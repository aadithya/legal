Pertaining to accused No.2 and 4 i.e. petitioner No. 1 and 2

there are no averments whatsoever in the complaint.

Learned counsel for respondent No.2 fairly concedes that

he is unable to point out even a single word in the complaint where
reference has been made to accused No. 2 and accused No. 4.
5.

Qua accused No.5 averments are to be found in para 3 and

para 4 of the complaint which reads as under:“3. That towards the part discharged of their contractual
liability/debt payable in money, arising out of the hiring
charges for the crawler cranes hired by the accused No.1
from the complainant, the accused No.3 and 5 drew and
tendered on behalf of accused No.1, to the complainant, the

That the above cheque was tendered and delivered by
the accused No.5 on behalf of the accused No.1 to the
complainant at his office at Delhi, towards the part
discharge of a legally enforceable and unequivocally
admitted contractual liability, payable in money arising out
of the hiring charges for the crawler cranes hired, rendering
the accused liable to honour the cheque issued by him in
consideration thereof.”

Director of a Company, in a complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act,
is that he was incharge and was responsible for conduct of
page 2 of 3

business of the company.
7.

In the absence of any allegation in the complaint against

accused No.2 and accused No. 4, summoning order viz-a-viz said
accused is hereby held to be faulty and without jurisdiction. Viz-a-viz
accused No.5 i.e. petitioner no.3, in para 3 and para 4 of the complaint
specific averments have been made that he along with accused No.3
tendered, on behalf of accused No.1, 2 cheques which have formed the
subject matter of the complaint. Qua him, further averment has been
made in para 4 that he i.e. accused No.5 (petitioner no.3) tendered the
cheques to the complainant.
8.

In that view of the matter the petition which challenges the

summoning order against the petitioners stands disposed of quashing
the summoning order and the complaint against petitioner No.1 and 2.
The complaint and the summoning order qua petitioner No.3 is
affirmed.
9.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned counsel for

the parties on payment of usual charges.
