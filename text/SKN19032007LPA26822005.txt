SANJIV KHANNA, J :
1. The present Letters Patent Appeals have been filed by 30
employees of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (hereinafter referred to
as the BSNL, for short)- a Public Sector Company.
2. The appellants were earlier Group-B and C employees of
Directorate

of

Telecommunication,

Ministry

of

Telecom,

LPA No.2682-2711/2005

Page 2

Government of India.
3. In 2000, the Government of India formed BSNL and the assets and
liabilities of the Department of Telecommunication were transferred
to the said company. Employees working in various cadres of the
Ministry of Telecommunication were put on deemed deputation with
BSNL till they exercised their option.
4. On 14th January, 2002, BSNL called upon the employees working
on deemed deputation to exercise their option/willingness for
permanent absorption in BSNL. The appellants opted for BSNL and
are now employees of BSNL .
5. The appellants were in possession of accommodation allotted to
them from the State Pool. The said accommodations had been
allotted at the time when they were employees of Ministry of
Telecommunication, Government of India.
6. In 2003, BSNL started deducting tax at source in terms of Circular
No.9 of 2003 dated 18th November, 2003 issued by the Income Tax
Department by adding 10% to the taxable salary of the appellants
as 'perquisite' as the appellants were in possession of official
accommodation.
7. The appellants protested against the said deduction of tax at source
and stated that this was illegal and 10% of their salary cannot be
deemed to be a 'perquisite'. In the meanwhile, BSNL also

LPA No.2682-2711/2005

Page 3

introduced IBA scales of pay replacing the existing LDA scales of
pay for the executive staff-group B employees absorbed in BSNL
w.e.f. 1st October, 2000. In terms of the said pay scales, BSNL
executives were entitled to House Rent Allowance on the basis of
revised pay scales w.e.f. 1st October, 2000, as per the terms
applicable

to

Central

Government

employees

based

upon

reclassification of the cities as notified by the Government of India.
8. The appellants herein filed a Writ Petition (C) No. 9898-9927/2005
against deduction of tax at source on “the perquisite”. The said Writ
Petition was dismissed by the learned Single Judge vide Order
dated 30th May, 2005. Learned Single Judge held that tax deducted
at source is being made by virtue of the amendment to the Income
Tax Rules, 1962 in 2001 and therefore the Writ Petition had no
merit.
9. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants at
the time of absorption in BSNL were given to understand that the
existing Government Rules and Regulations would apply and
therefore deduction of tax at source by virtue of amendment to the
Income Tax Rules, 1962 in 2001 is contrary to law and against the
principle of promissory estoppel.
10.Learned counsel for the respondents-BSNL and the Income Tax
Department, on the other hand, submitted that amendment to the

LPA No.2682-2711/2005

Page 4

Income Tax Rules is legal and valid and BSNL is liable to deduct
tax at source on the salary paid in accordance with law. Principle of
promissory estoppel has no application.
11.We have examined the contentions raised by the parties and gone
through the record. At the time of absorption of the appellants in
BSNL, general terms and conditions for absorption were circulated.
Clause 10 of the general terms and conditions of absorption reads
as under:“10. Residential Quarters:The DOT officers, who are allotees of
BSNL quarters, will continue to occupy the
same on “as is where is basis” even after
permanent absorption in BSNL. However,
the officers who opt for BSNL and are
occupying quarters from the estate pool
would be allowed to retain the same up to
30.9.2005 on payment of standard license
fee.”
12. The aforesaid Clause states that officers who opt for BSNL and
were occupying quarters from State Pool would be entitled to retain
the accommodation upto 30th September, 2005 on payment of
standard licence fee. What was the standard licence fee was not
stipulated. Further the appellants are not challenging or questioning
or stating the standard licence fee as applicable to Government
Servants was not charged from them upto 30th Sept.,2005 as stated
in clause 10. The grievance of the appellants is against deduction of

LPA No.2682-2711/2005

Page 5

tax at source in accordance with the amended provisions of the
Income Tax Rules w.e.f. 2001. Clause 10 quoted above does not
deal with deduction of tax at source. No assurance was given to the
appellants that tax at source in accordance with law will not be
deducted. In fact no such assurance could have been given. Every
employer be it Government, Public Sector Undertakings or private
company has to comply with the statutory provisions relating to
deduction of tax at source. It is also well known that deduction of
tax at source is done as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act
and the relevant Rules. The Income Tax Act and the Rules,
everyone is aware, are modified from time to time and by the
Finance Act, which is passed every year. Income Tax Act and the
Rules change form time to time and do not remain static. Therefore,
the contention of the appellants that because of the principle of
promissory estoppel, the respondent BSNL should be restrained
from deducting tax at source as per applicable Rules, is liable to be
rejected. The said submission cannot be countenanced. No such
promise was ever made. It is well settled that principle of
promissory estoppel does not apply to statutory enactments and
mandatory provisions stipulated in the Statutes.
13.The provision of deduction of tax at source under the Income Tax
Act only facilitates collection of tax. It is only a mechanism to collect

LPA No.2682-2711/2005

Page 6

tax. The employee is given benefit and credit of the tax deducted at
source. However, on the basis of assessment, assessee is entitled
to refund of the tax already paid by him or tax deducted at source
credited to his account. The Income Tax Department is under an
obligation and duty to refund the excess tax. In case of delay, it is
liable to pay interest. [See observations of the Supreme Court in
Transmission Corpn. Of A.P. Ltd. Versus CIT, reported in (1999)
7 SCC 266].
14.Recently, the Supreme Court in the case of

Arun Kumar and

others versus Union of India and others reported in (2007) 1
SCC 732 examined constitutional validity of Rule 3 of the Income
Tax Rules, 1962 as amended in 2001. Constitutional validity of the
amendment was upheld. However, the Supreme Court held that
Rule 3 applies when there is “concession” in the matter of
accommodation provided by an employer to an employee. It was
held that this jurisdictional fact mentioned in Section 17(2)(ii) has to
be established before calculation of “concession”, under Rule 3 of
the Income Tax Rules, 1962 can be made. In case, there is no
“concession” then Section 17(2)(ii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 will
not apply and in the absence of the said “jurisdictional fact”,
computation under Rule 3 is inconsequential. Rule 3 was held to be
merely a machinery provision included

in the subordinate

LPA No.2682-2711/2005

Page 7

legislation, which applies only if there is “concession” in the matter
of providing accommodation by an employer to an employee. To
this extent, the petitioners will be entitled to take advantage and
benefit of the said judgment, subject of course, to further
amendment in the Income Tax Rules, 1962 and the Income Tax
Act, 1961. It may be mentioned that some further amendments
have been proposed in the recent budget presented in the
Parliament in Feb.,2007.
15.However, in

Arun Kumar (supra), the Supreme Court also

examined the question of classification and discrimination between
Central

and

State

Government

employees

and

employees

belonging to companies, corporations and other public sector
undertakings. It was held that doctrine of equity has limited place in
taxation statutes and the classification cannot be struck down as
ultra vires on the ground that it violates Article 14. Reference was
made to another recent decision of the Supreme Court in the case
of Confederation of Ex-Servicemen Association versus Union
of India reported in (2006) 8 SCC 399 and it was held that rule
making authority is competent to distinguish between employees of
the Central and the State Government and other employees. It was
further held that the classification made in Rule 3 has rationale and
nexus with the object to be achieved and it takes into consideration

LPA No.2682-2711/2005

Page 8

that service conditions of government employees are different from
employees of government owned corporations, private companies,
and other undertakings. Reference was made to Article 311 of the
Constitution of India and it was observed that certain benefits are
not available to employees of companies, corporations and
undertakings, etc.
16.In view of the findings given above, we find no merit in the present
Appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed. However, in the
facts and circumstances of the case there will be no order as to
costs.
