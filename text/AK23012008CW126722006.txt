CM No.5678/2006 in W.P(C) No.12672/2006

1.

This is an application filed by the respondent/workman under

Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking direction to
the

petitioner

to

pay

regular

wages

and

allowances

to

the

applicant/respondent during the pendency of the writ petition.

2.

The

respondent/applicant

contended

that

he

has

been

unemployed since 19th July, 2000, the date of termination of his

CM No.5678/2006 in W.P(C) No.12672/2006

services, and that he has not been able to get any employment and is
unemployed till date as a result of which he is facing severe hardship
and that he is unable to support his wife and two grown up children.
The respondent also contended that he has become dependent on his
father and has been helping him in small agricultural land in
Himachal Pradesh whereas his other family members are looked after
by his brother and they stay with him at Delhi. The respondent also
contended that he has not been able to get a suitable job inspite of
best efforts and is not gainfully employed in any establishment and is
suffering from severe prejudice, financial hardship and instability.

3.

A reply has been filed on behalf of petitioner/non-applicant

wherein the petitioner denied the averments made by the respondent
in the application. The petitioner/non applicant contended that the
application of the respondent under section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 is not maintainable as the respondent/applicant
has not filed any affidavit stating that he is not employed in any
establishment. The petitioner also denied that the termination of the
services of the respondent was malafide, without any reason and for
ulterior motive and submitted that all the dues of the respondent were
cleared after the termination of his services on 19th July, 2000. The
petitioner also submitted that the respondent did not place any
material before the Labour Court to show that he was unemployed or

CM No.5678/2006 in W.P(C) No.12672/2006

Page 2 of 8

that he tried but was unable to get a job. The petitioner relied on the
cross examination of the respondent on 12th July, 2004 in support of
his contention wherein the respondent stated that “I did not try for
any job anywhere” which according to the petitioner in fact suggests
that the respondent was not interested to do any service though there
is great demand of drivers. Thus the petitioner pleaded that the
application of the respondent under section 17B of the Industrial
disputes Act, 1947 is not maintainable.

4.

Perusal of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

reveals that it comes into operation when an Award directing
reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further proceedings by the
employer. The statute requires satisfaction of the following four
conditions:
(i)

an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in proceedings in a High Court or the
Supreme Court;

(ii)

during the pendency of such proceedings, employer
is required to pay full wages to the workman;

(iii)

the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any
maintenance allowance admissible to him under
any Rule;

(iv)

such wages would be admissible only if the
workman had not been employed in any
establishment during such period and an affidavit
had been filed to such effect.

CM No.5678/2006 in W.P(C) No.12672/2006

Thus under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, the
court is to ascertain whether the workman was gainfully employed in
any establishment and once the court comes to the conclusion that
the workman was not gainfully employed in any establishment then
the court is bound to grant relief to the workman in terms of the
provision. Also the Court cannot go into the merits of the case/writ
petition while deciding an application under section 17B as was held
in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish
Chander.

5.

The preliminary consideration for making available such a relief

under Section 17B to a workman is to be found in the benevolent
purpose of the enactment, the spirit, intendment and object
underlying which is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the
hardship which would be caused to a workman due to delay in the
implementation of an award directing reinstatement of his services on
account of the challenge made to it by the employer. Section 17B
recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body
and soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award
directing his reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment which is required to be
made by the employer to the workman has been held to be akin to a
CM No.5678/2006 in W.P(C) No.12672/2006

Page 4 of 8

subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor recoverable
from a workman even if the Award in his favor is set aside by the High
Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (Para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T.
Patel the Apex Court was of the view that the object under Section
17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain
extent, the hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay
in implementation of the Award.

6.

The other question is whether the applicant would be entitled

for last drawn wages or something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 entitled
Town Municipal, Athani v. P.O. LC Hugli & Ors, it was held by the
Apex Court that a workman has a legal right to wages under the
Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot be diverted to a remedy under
Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act for enforcing such right. In this
case, the Apex Court was concerned with the power of the Act under
Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the
principles laid down by the Court would have a bearing on the issues
raised before this Court as well. From a conspectus of the
authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court, the right of a
workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified under the
Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the
constitutional mandate and nothing more. It is undoubtedly, the bare
minimum which is required by the workman to subsist and is nothing

CM No.5678/2006 in W.P(C) No.12672/2006

Page 5 of 8

more. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean all the wages
that have fallen due atleast from the date of the Award.

7.

Moreover granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and

passing orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the
rule; refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the
relief could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of
jurisdictional error where there is no relationship of employer and
employee between the parties.

8.

In the present case the workman has categorically averred in

the application that he was not employed in any establishment since
the date of termination of his services and has been facing severe
hardship and an affidavit in support of the same has also been filed
wherein the respondent/applicant has deposed that the contents of
the application be read as part of the affidavit and that the same are
not repeated for the sake of brevity. In the facts and circumstances
the

plea

of

the

petitioner/non

applicant

that

the

respondent/applicant has not filed any affidavit stating that he is not
employed in any establishment is not sustainable.

Furthermore the

court is not to go into the questions as to whether the workman
actually tried to find a job after termination of services or not or that
since he is a driver he could have easily found a job, had he tried.

CM No.5678/2006 in W.P(C) No.12672/2006

Page 6 of 8

Such questions are not germane to decide an application under
section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

9.

In the facts and circumstances, the applicant fulfills the criteria

for availing the benefit under section 17B of the Act and in exercise of
powers under Article 226 of the Constitution. If the requisites of
Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are satisfied, no
order can be passed denying the workman the benefit of statutory
provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
Consequently, the application of the workman/respondent under
Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is allowed and the
petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or the minimum
wages whichever is higher from the date of award dated 24th April,
2006. Arrears of last drawn wages or the minimum wages which ever
is higher be paid within six weeks. Future last drawn wages or the
minimum

wages

be

paid

by

10th

of

every

month.

Respondent/workman is also directed to file an undertaking that in
case

the

petition

is

allowed,

the

respondent/workman

shall

refund/repay the difference of last drawn wages and minimum wages
within the time allowed by this Court. The undertaking to this effect
be filed by the respondent/applicant within two weeks. With these
directions, the application is disposed of.
