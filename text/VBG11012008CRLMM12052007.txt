No.2

Sh.Vineet Arora, complainant, (who is respondent
in

Crl.M.C.No.1205/2007)

has

got

the

F.I.R.

No.636/2005 registered under Sections 323/341/506/34
IPC at P.S.Defence Colony on the allegations that he is a
family friend of the petitioner for last more than 10 years
and due to some misunderstanding he got the F.I.R. in
question registered against the petitioners with the police
and now due to intervention of the common friends and
respectable elderly persons of the area, the matter has
been compromised and a deed of compromise

has been

drawn and signed between the parties and since both the
parties have amicably arrived at a compromise, no useful
purpose will be served if the proceedings in the present
F.I.R. allowed to be continued and so it is prayed that the
proceedings

against

the

petitioners

may

be

quashed/dropped.

In Crl.M.C.No.1119/2007, F.I.R. No.638/05 under

Sections 323/341/506/509 IPC was registered at P.S.
Defence Colony by complainant Deepak Kukreja , who is
one of the accused, in F.I.R. No.636/05 against Sh.Vineet
Arora, complainant of F.I.R.No.636/2005.
4.

It is stated that due to the intervention of common

friends and respectable elderly persons, the parties have
compromised the matter and a deed of compromise has
been drawn and signed between the parties and both the
parties have amicably arrived at a compromise and no
useful purpose will be served

if the proceedings in the

present F.I.R. are allowed to be continued as both the
parties are family friends.
5.

The only objection taken by the counsel for the State

in these matters

is that the offences which are not

compoundable under Section 320 Cr.P.C., the same cannot
be quashed by this Court.
6.

It has been laid down by this Court in R.S.Arora Vs.

State (1995) JCC 439 that:-

Crl.M.C.No.1205/2007

Page 4 of 6

“It is true that offences which are noncompoundable in relation to the quashing of
such offences, the High Court has to act with
great caution and circumspection but to agree
with the arguments of learned counsel for the
State that those offences which are noncompoundable in view of the Section 320 of the
Cr.P.C., the High Court will be without power
although parties have settled their matter
amicably would be to make the provisions of
Section 482
of the Cr.P.C. nugatory and
ineffective.
The Parliament has specifically
provided Section 482 in the Cr.P.C. and High
Court in exercise of these powers which are
plenary are neither fettered by any provision of
the Code and certainly not by Section 320 of the
Cr.P.C. So long as these powers are exercised by
the High Court to secure the ends of justice and
to stop abuse of the process of the Court.
Compromise in modern society is a sine qua non
of harmony and orderly behavior. Compromise
is the soul of justice. Exercising the inherent
powers, Under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. in
disputes which emanates out of matrimonial
differences,
landlord-tenant
matters
or
commercial transactions are to advance the
course of justice. No useful purpose will be
served after the parties have amicably settled
their disputes, buried their past, want to live in a
sprit of peace and harmony to relegate them
before the police and the Courts, that will be
sheer abuse of the process of Court and instead
of
securing
justice
would
amount
to
perpetuating injustice to such parties, who have
compromised their matters.”
7.

In the present two petitions also, both the parties are

family friends and they are known to each other for the last

Crl.M.C.No.1205/2007

Page 5 of 6

10 years and both the parties are resident of the same
colony, that is, Defence Colony.

So, keeping in view the

facts and circumstances of the cases and the fact that the
matters have been amicably settled between the parties,
no useful purpose will be served if proceedings in these
two cases are allowed to be continued.
8.

Under these circumstances,

both the F.I.Rs. in

question, i.e., F.I.R. Nos.636/05 & 638/05 P.S.Defence
Colony are, hereby, quashed. However, the petitioners of
each case shall pay Rs.5,000/- as costs of the proceedings.
Costs be deposited with the Delhi High Court Legal
Services Committee within one month from today.
9.

List on 18th February, 2008 for compliance.
