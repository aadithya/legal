1.

Present appeal has been filed by the appellants

against the impugned judgment dated 11th December, 1996
passed in suit No.614/1992 by Sh.Rakesh Kapur, Judge,
Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Delhi, wherein a sum of
Rs.2,65,200/- was awarded to the appellants on account of
death of Manjeet Singh in a road accident.
2.

Brief facts of the case are that on 6th October, 1992 at

about 9.00 a.m. deceased Manjeet Singh was driving two
wheeler scooter No.DDM-335 and when he reached the
round about at Rama Road, Patel Road, a DTC bus No.DHP3915 plying at route No.820, came from behind at a very
fast speed. This bus first of all hit a three wheeler scooter
which over-turned and thereafter the said bus hit the

FAO No.96/1997

Page 2 of 13

scooter of the deceased. The scooter of the deceased was
completely crushed and deceased died at the spot.
3.

The factum of accident and the fact that respondent

No.1 was driving the bus in a rash and negligent manner
are not in dispute. The only question raised in the present
appeal is as to whether the compensation awarded is much
less than the reasonable.
4.

It has been argued by learned counsel for the

appellant that the learned Tribunal erred in assessing the
monthly income of the deceased at Rs.2,500/-, in fact the
deceased was earning much more than this amount and as
such monthly income of deceased would not have been less
than Rs.4,000/-. The learned Tribunal ignored the income
tax return Ex.PW-3/E which was filed for the assessment
year 1993-94. The price index should ought to have been
taken consideration by the learned Tribunal and the 1/3rd
deduction is on the higher side. The multiplier applied in
this case was of 13 years whereas, as per Second Schedule
of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 the multiplier ought to have
been of 17 years.

Learned counsel in support of his

contention has cited the decision of Supreme Court in the
FAO No.96/1997

Page 3 of 13

case of Sarla Dixit vs. Balwant Yadav, (1996), 3 SCC 179,
in which it has been observed that the future prospects of
advancement in life and career should also be sounded in
terms of money to augment the multiplicand.
5.

On the other hand, it has been argued by learned

counsel for the respondents that the deceased was more
than 33 years at the time of the accident, which is clear
from the school leaving certificate which is Ex.PW-3/G.
The learned Tribunal rightly rejected the income tax return
Ex.PW-3/E, since the same was filed much after the death
of the deceased. As per income tax return Ex.PW-3/D, filed
on 11th June, 1992, i.e. four months prior to death of the
deceased, which is an authenticated document the learned
Tribunal rightly considered it. According to this document,
the annual income of deceased was Rs.30,490/- and, thus,
his monthly income was assessed at Rs.2,500/6.

As per statement of wife of the deceased who has

appeared in the witness box of the PW-3, the deceased was
carrying the business along with his brother. In crossexamination, PW-3 admits that in the shop run by her
husband, his brother Gurcharan was also with him. Thus,
FAO No.96/1997

Page 4 of 13

from this shop, income accrued to deceased as well as to
his brother and as such there was sharing of the income.
7.

The multiplier of 13 years in this case has been

adopted by the learned Tribunal in view of the various
decisions of the Apex Court and as per decision in the case
of UP Road Transport Corporation and Ors vs. Trilok

Chandra & Ors. (1996) 4 SCC 362, the Second Schedule
of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 suffers from several defects
and Courts and Tribunals cannot go by the ready reckoner.
This schedule can only be used as a guide and the selection
of multiplier cannot be solely dependent age of the
deceased. Hence, there is no force in this appeal and the
compensation awarded by the learned Tribunal is just and
reasonable and the trial court order does not call for any
interference.
8.

As per averments made in the petition, the age of the

deceased has been mentioned as 30 years. However,
appellants themselves have placed on record the school
leaving certificate, Ex.PW-3/G.

According to it, the date of

birth of the deceased is 2nd May, 1959. The deceased has
died on 6th October, 1992.
FAO No.96/1997

As such, at the time of the
Page 5 of 13

death, deceased was about 33 and half year.
9.

Coming to the income of the deceased, it has been

mentioned as Rs.5000/- per month, in the petition. PW-3,
(widow of the deceased) has stated that total income of her
husband from business was Rs.7,000/- per month and he
used to give her Rs.4,000/- to Rs.5,000/- per month for
running the house hold.
10.

The appellants have placed on record, income tax

returns of the deceased Ex.PW-3/C to Ex.PW-3/E. Ex.PW3/E was filed on 13th July, 1993, i.e. about nine months after
the death of the deceased, which is not relevant in this
case.

As per Ex.PW-3/D, filed on 11th June, 1992 (four

months prior to the death of the deceased) income of
deceased was assessed at Rs.30,490/- per annum.
the monthly income of

Thus,

deceased comes to Rs.2,500/-

approximately.
11.

It is well settled that the persons can tell lie but

document cannot and when there is any documentary
evidence, no amount of oral evidence to that effect can be
considered.

The income of the deceased, was rightly

assessed at Rs.2,500/- per month by the Tribunal and there
FAO No.96/1997

Page 6 of 13

is no ground to disturb this finding of the fact.
12.

Now, coming to the question as to what multiplier

should have been adopted in this case.
13.

Section 168 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides

that; Claim Tribunals may make an award determining the
amount of compensation which appears to it to be “just”.
14.

In the case of UP State Road Transport(supra), the

deceased aged about 26 years met with a fatal road
accident.

The tribunal applied a multiplier of 24 years

whereas, the High Court applied the multiplier of 34 years.
So the question was whether the Tribunal was right in
applying the multiplier of 24 or the High Court was right in
applying multiplier of 34. It was held that:“4. India is one of the countries with the
highest number of road accidents.
Motor accidents are everyday affairs.
A large number or claims for
compensation for injury caused by
road accidents are pending in
various Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal.
In a fatal accident the
dependants of the deceased are
entitled to compensation for the loss
suffered by them on account of the
death. The most commonly practised
method of assessing the loss suffered
is to calculate the loss for a year and
then to capitalise the amount by a
FAO No.96/1997

Page 7 of 13

suitable multiplier. To that is added
the loss suffered on account of loss of
expectation of life and the like. The
Tribunals and High Courts have
adopted
divergent
methods
to
determine the suitable multiplier.
Even this Court has not been
uniform;
maybe
because
the
principle on which this method came
to be evolved has been forgotten. It
has, therefore, become necessary to
examine the law and to state the
correct principles to be adopted.
5. The topic of compensation for
causing death by negligent driving
came up for serious discussion
before this Court in Gobald Motor
Service Ltd. vs. R.M.K. Veluswami,
AIR 1962 SC 1. The Court referred
to the House of Lords decision in
Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated
Collieries Ltd., 1942 AC 601 and
quoted the following passage from
the judgment:
“The damages are to
be based on the reasonable
expectation of pecuniary
benefit or benefit reducible
to money value.
In
assessing the damages all
circumstances which may
be legitimately pleaded in
diminution of the damages
must be considered. ...The
actual pecuniary loss of
each individual entitled to
sue can only be ascertained
by balancing, on the one
hand, the loss to him of the
future pecuniary benefit,
and, on the other any
FAO No.96/1997

Page 8 of 13

pecuniary advantage which
from
whatever
source
comes to him by reason of
the death.”
6.The court also referred to the
judgment by Viscount Simon in
Nance v. British Columbia Electric
Rly. Co. Ltd. in which the same
principles were
enunciated for
estimating the damages, the method
adopted however differed. Various
factors
that
would
enter
the
calculation as per Viscount Simon
were set out in the judgment as
under:
“....at first the deceased
man's expectation of life has to
be estimated having regard to
his age, bodily health and the
possibility
of
premature
determination of his life by
later accidents; secondly, the
amount required for the future
provision of his wife shall be
estimated having regard to the
amounts he used to spend on
her during his lifetime, and
other circumstances; thirdly,
the estimated annual sum is
multiplied by the number of
years of the man's estimated
span of life, and the said
amount must be discounted so
as to arrive at the equivalent in
the form of a lump sum payable
on his death; fourthly, further
deductions must be made for
the benefit accruing to the
widow from the acceleration of
FAO No.96/1997

Page 9 of 13

her interest in his estate; and,
fifthly, further amounts have to
be deducted for the possibility
of the wife dying earlier if the
husband had lived the full span
of life; and it should also be
taken into account that there is
the possibility of the widow
remarrying
much
to
the
improvement of her financial
position. It would be seen from
the said mode of estimation
that many imponderables enter
into the calculation.”
15.

Further held:“15. We thought it necessary to reiterate
the method of working out 'just'
compensation because, of late, we
have noticed from the awards made
by tribunals and courts that the
principle on which the multiplier
method was developed has been lost
sight of and once again a hybrid
method based on the subjectivity of
the Tribunal/Court has surfaced,
introducing uncertainty and lack of
reasonable uniformity in the matter
of determination of compensation. It
must
be
realised
that
the
Tribunal/Court has to determine a
fair
amount
of
compensation
awardable to the victim of an
accident
which
must
be
proportionate to the injury caused.
The two English decisions to which
we have referred earlier provide the
guidelines for assessing the loss
occasioned to the victims. Under the
formula advocated by Lord Wright in

FAO No.96/1997

Page 10 of 13

Davies, the loss has to be ascertained
by first determining the monthly
income of the deceased, then
deducting therefrom the amount
spent on the deceased, and thus
assessing the loss to the dependants
of the deceased.
The annual
dependency assessed in this manner
is then to be multiplied by the use of
an appropriate multiplier.
Let us
illustrate: X, male, aged about
35years, dies in an accident.
He
leaves behind his widow and 3 minor
children. His monthly income was Rs
3500. First, deduct the amount spent
on X every month. The rough and
ready method hitherto adopted
where no definite evidence was
forthcoming, was to break up the
family into units, taking two units for
an adult and one unit for a minor.
Thus X and his wife make 2+2=4
units and each minor one unit i.e. 3
units in all, totaling 7 units.
Thus
the share per unit works out to Rs
3500/7=Rs 500 per month. It can
thus be assumed that Rs 1000 was
spent on X. Since he was a working
member some provision for his
transport and out-of-pocket expenses
has to be estimated. In the present
case we estimate the out-of-pocket
expense at Rs 250. Thus the amount
spent on the deceased X works out to
Rs 1250 per month leaving a balance
of Rs 3500-1250=Rs 2250 per month.
This amount can be taken as the
monthly loss to X's dependants. The
annual dependency comes to Rs
2250x12=Rs 27,000.
This annual
dependency has to be multiplied by
FAO No.96/1997

Page 11 of 13

16.

the use of an appropriate multiplier
to assess the compensation under the
head of loss to the dependants. Take
the appropriate multiplier to be 15.
The compensation comes to Rs.
27,000x15=Rs 4,05,000. To this may
be added a conventional amount by
way of loss of expectation of life.
Earlier this conventional amount was
pegged down to Rs 3000 but now
having regard to the fall in the value
of the rupee, it can be raised to a
figure of not more than Rs 10,000.
Thus the total comes to Rs
4,05,000+10,000=Rs 4,15,000.”
So, keeping in view the above decision of the Apex

Court, it is to be seen as to whether the compensation
awarded by the learned Tribunal is just or not.
17.

The deceased in the present case was aged about 33

and a half years and his income was Rs.2,500/- per month.
Assuming that the deceased was spending 1/3rd on his
personal expenses, the loss on account of dependency
comes

to

Rs.1,700/-

per

month

or

in

other

words

Rs.20,400/- per annum. The learned Tribunal has applied
the multiplier of 13 years which is quite reasonable and
was the appropriate multiplier.
18.

As such no infirmity can be found with the order

passed by the learned Tribunal and the compensation

FAO No.96/1997

Page 12 of 13

awarded is just and reasonable. Hence, there is no force in
the present appeal and the same is, hereby dismissed. No
order as to costs.
19.

Trial court record be sent back forthwith.
