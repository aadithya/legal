1.

This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner

who submits that he is claiming rights under an oral
agreement to sell, to purchase the property bearing
no.M-289, Greater Kailash Part II, New Delhi.

The

petitioner contends that under such agreement, he
has paid an amount of Rs.5,00,000/- to the respondent
no.4 as earnest money through the lawyer of the
respondent no.4.

WP (C) No.7388/2007

There is no date of agreement to

Page No.1

sell pleaded anywhere in the petition. No date of any
payment to the respondent no.4 is also pleaded in the
entire writ petition.
2.

So far as the rights of the respondent no.4 are

concerned, the petitioner has submitted that the
father of the respondent no.4 Shri Pritpal Singh Kohli
had filed a suit for declaration being Suit No.548/1993
against

one

Smt.

Commissioner

of

Surjit
Police

Kaur
wherein

and

the

Deputy

he

has

sought

adjudication as to his claim and declaration of being
the exclusive and absolute owner in possession of the
subject land. It is an admitted position that this suit is
pending adjudication and there has been no final
adjudication even so far as the claim and the
ownership of the father of the respondent no.4 is
concerned.
3.

So far as the respondent no.4 is concerned, the

petitioner contends that on account of expiry of
Mr. Pritpal Singh Kohli, his son the respondent no.4
has

been

impleaded

as

his

legal

heir

and

representative in the suit. So far as the rights of the
respondent no.4 in the suit property are concerned, it
WP (C) No.7388/2007

Page No.2

is therefore evident that the same have not been
determined and even the respondent no.4 has not
been held to be owner of the subject property so far.
The agreed sale consideration which the petitioner
contends,

is

stated

to

be

an

amount

of

Rs.3,00,00,000/- against which the petitioner is relying
on a payment of barely Rs.5,00,000/- to the counsel
for the respondent no.4.
There is therefore nothing

on record which

would evidence that the petitioner has any legal or
enforceable right to seek the relief which he has
sought in the present petition.
4.

Be that as it may, the petitioner has contended

that the Deputy Commissioner of Police has passed an
order dated 2nd September, 1992 taking possession
of the plot of land bearing no.M-289, Greater Kailash
Part II, New Delhi. The petitioner contends that by an
order passed on the 4th of March, 1993 in Suit
No.548/1993, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (who
was the defendant no.2 therein) was restrained from
delivering possession of the suit property bearing
no.M-289, Greater Kailash Part II, New Delhi to any
WP (C) No.7388/2007

Page No.3

other person except the plaintiff.

According

to

the

writ petitioner, in violation of this order dated 4th
March, 1993, the Deputy Commissioner of Police has
handed over possession to some other parties who
have raised construction on the subject land. It is also
contended that the building plans in respect of the
construction

which has been raised, have been

illegally sanctioned by the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi.
5.

As noticed above,

the petitioner herein is not

even a party to suit No.548/1993. He does not appear
to have taken any steps for enforcing of rights, if any,
in respect of the subject property before this court
nor details of any agreement has been placed on
record. In any case, so far as the contention that the
Deputy Commissioner of Police has violated the order
dated 4th March, 1993 is concerned, the appropriate
remedy in respect thereof would be available to the
plaintiff in the pending suit. This writ petition at the
instance of the petitioner, in the given facts, is wholly
misconceived.
6.

So

far

as

WP (C) No.7388/2007

sanction

of

building
Page No.4

plans

unauthorisedly and illegally by the MCD is concerned,
no material has been placed by the petitioner before
the court with regard to the date on which the plan
was sanctioned or the person in whose favour the
same has been so done.

The writ petition does not

even disclose the name of the persons who have
undertaken the construction.
7.

Perusal of the photographs would show that this

writ petition has been filed long after a complete
building has raised on the plot in question. There is
not even an assertion anywhere on record as to the
particulars of the person who has carried out the
construction.
This writ petition and application are wholly
misconceived and are dismissed with costs which are
quantified at Rs.10,000/- which shall be apportioned
between

the

Delhi

High

Court

Legal

Services

Committee and the Delhi High Court Lawyers Social
Security and Welfare Fund.

The costs shall be

deposited within a period of two weeks from today.
Proof of deposit of costs shall be placed before this
court.
