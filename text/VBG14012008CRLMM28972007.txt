Brief facts of this case are that the complainant, Dive

Nikhil Kundra who is respondent No.2 in this case, is a
resident of Rajouri Garden. On 28th June, 2007, he wanted
to park his car in front of house No. J-9/15, Rajouri Garden
but the Guard present there objected to. In spite of that,
the complainant parked his car and after he came back, he
found that his car was having dent on its back door. One
person named Piolot, had put the dent on his car and he
again hit his car with the bricks and started beating the
complainant. In the meanwhile, people gathered there and
the complainant telephoned and his father and other
relatives came. That Piolot also called some persons. One
of them, was having a sword while, another one was having
a rod in his hand and two other persons including the
owner of the house in front of whose house the car was
parked, were having bricks in their hands and they started
beating the complainant and his family members and in
this process complainant and his family members sustained
injuries and thus the present case was registered.
3.

Now in the present petition, it has been stated by the

Crl.M.C.No. 2897/2007

Page 3 of 5

petitioners that due to the intervention of the common
friends and relatives, both the parties have settled their
disputes and have decided to live with peace and harmony
and respondent No.2 does not want to proceed with the
present case and as such the FIR in question should be
quashed.
4.

On behalf of the State, it has been contended by

learned counsel that the accused persons were armed with
swords, rod and bricks and they have caused injuries to
various persons and keeping in view the nature and gravity
of the offence, no case is made out for quashing of the FIR.
5.

In the present case, admittedly, a quarrel has taken

place spontaneously on the parking of a car in front of
house of one of the petitioners by the complainant.

No

mens rea is involved and the incident occurred at the spurr
of the moment and there was no earlier planning on behalf
of any of the accused persons, to cause injuries to any of
the victims.
6.

All the injured persons have filed their affidavits

stating that due to intervention of common friends and well
wishers, they have settled the matter with the petitioners
Crl.M.C.No. 2897/2007

Page 4 of 5

and they do not want to proceed with the FIR and they
have entered into a compromise without any fair or
pressure.
7.

Admittedly, the complainant and the owner of the

house in front of whom the complainant had parked his car,
are resident of the same locality.

So, in order to have

peace and harmony between the parties, it is a fit case
where this Court in its inherent power should grant
permission for quashing of the FIR.
8.

Keeping in view, the facts and circumstances of the

case, the present petition is allowed and the FIR No.
485/2007 under Sec. 323/308/325/34 IPC PS Rajouri
Garden is hereby quashed, subject to the condition that the
petitioners

shall

pay

Rs.15,000/-

as

costs

of

the

proceedings. Costs of the proceedings shall be deposited
with the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee with a
period of one month from today.
9.

List on 18th February, 2008 for compliance.
