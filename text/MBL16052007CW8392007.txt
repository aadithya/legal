MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
The Petitioner is a company incorporated under the laws of
Finland and is engaged in the business of supplying advanced
telecommunication systems and equipment for use in fixed and mobile
phone networks. According to the Petitioner, it does not have any
permanent establishment in India and, therefore, being a tax resident of
Finland and governed by the provisions of India-Finland Double
Taxation Avoidance Agreement, the income derived by the Petitioner
from supply of telecommunication equipments to Indian telecom
operators qualifies as “business profits” and no portion thereof is
taxable in India. Accordingly, in respect of the assessment year 200304, the Petitioner filed a nil return of income.

2.

Unfortunately for the Petitioner, the Assessing Officer did

not agree with it and, therefore, assessed its income under Section
143(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) and raised a demand of
Rs.37.47 crores by way of tax and Rs.14.05 crores by way of interest

WP (C) No.839/2007

Page 2 of 13

under Section 243B of the Act. The assessment order was, of course,
passed on the basis that the Petitioner had a permanent establishment in
India and, therefore, the profit arising to it from the supply of equipment
to Indian customers is taxable in India.

3.

Feeling aggrieved by the order passed by the Assessing

Officer, the Petitioner preferred an appeal which is pending before the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [CIT (A)]. Before the appellate
authority, the Petitioner asked for a stay of deposit of the tax and interest
and it seems that the Petitioner was asked to indicate, according to it, the
amount due by way of tax. The Petitioner relied upon a judgment
delivered by the Special Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
(the Tribunal) dated 22nd June, 2005 in the case of the Petitioner itself
and pertaining to the assessment years 1997-98 and 1998-99, and
responded by saying that if the judgment is implemented by the
Revenue, the liability of the Petitioner would be about Rs.4.86 crores for
the assessment year 2003-04. On this basis given by the Petitioner, it
was asked to deposit an amount of Rs.4.86 crores by the Revenue.

4.

Feeling aggrieved by this demand, the Petitioner preferred

WP (C) No.839/2007

Page 3 of 13

this writ petition praying for a stay of the demand.

5.

As mentioned above, there is a decision of the Special Bench

of the Tribunal in the case of the Petitioner itself for the assessment
years 1997-98 and 1998-99. According to the Petitioner, this decision
should be applied across the board for all the assessment years from
1997-98 to 2003-04 and if that is done, then the Petitioner would in fact
be entitled to a refund of tax on the basis of the cumulative demands and
deposits for assessment years 1997-98 till assessment year 2003-04.
Therefore, the contention of the Petitioner is that if it is asked to deposit
Rs.4.86 crores for the assessment year 2003-04, it will be casting an
unnecessary burden on the Petitioner and would mean that the Revenue
is not looking at the entire picture for all these assessment years
cumulatively, but for one assessment year at a time which, according to
the Petitioner, it should not do.

6.

It appears that the Revenue has challenged the order dated

22nd June, 2005 passed by the Special Bench of the Tribunal by filing
an appeal under Section 260A of the Act but we are told that this appeal
has not yet been listed for preliminary hearing and in any case there is

WP (C) No.839/2007

Page 4 of 13

no stay of the order dated 22nd June, 2005 passed by the Special Bench
of the Tribunal.

7.

It was submitted that across the board implementation has in

fact been accepted in principle by the Tribunal before whom appeals
filed by the Petitioner in respect of assessment years 1999-2000, 200001 and 2001-02 (three assessment years) are pending. With regard to
these three assessment years, the Petitioner had filed an application for
stay before the Tribunal in respect of an outstanding demand of
Rs.15.74 crores. Reliance was placed by the Petitioner on the pendency
of its appeal before the Special Bench of the Tribunal. The Tribunal
took note of this fact and against a demand of Rs.15.74 crores, it
directed the Petitioner by an interim order dated 3rd June, 2005 to pay
Rs.50 lakhs for three months, that is, June, July and August, 2005
(making a total of Rs.1.5 crores). The Tribunal also took note of the fact
that the CIT (A) had differed with his predecessor in so far as levy of
interest was concerned and that the Petitioner had also paid a sufficient
amount towards the tax liability.

8.

After the interim order dated 3rd June, 2005 was passed by

WP (C) No.839/2007

Page 5 of 13

the Tribunal, the Special Bench of the Tribunal decided the appeals of
the Petitioner on 22nd June, 2005 in respect of the assessment years
1997-98 and 1998-99.

Consequently, the Petitioner moved an

application for modification of the order dated 3rd June, 2005. By an
order dated 29th July, 2005, the Tribunal noted that the Petitioner seems
to have paid excess tax of about Rs.16.90 crores (if the order of the
Special Bench is implemented) and that the Petitioner had also paid
Rs.50 lakhs in terms of the order dated 3rd June, 2005 and so, relying on
the decision of the Special Bench, the Tribunal modified its earlier order
dated 3rd June, 2005 and relieved the Petitioner of its requirement to
pay the balance amount of Rs.1 crore in terms of the order dated 3rd
June, 2005. In other words, against a liability of Rs.15.74 crores, the
Tribunal was satisfied with the Petitioner's deposit of Rs.50 lakhs
primarily in view of the applicability of the decision of the Special
Bench.

9.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner mentioned these details

pertaining to the three assessment years to impress upon us the fact that
even the Tribunal had felt bound by the order passed by the Special
Bench and, therefore, it had granted interim relief to the Petitioner. It

WP (C) No.839/2007

Page 6 of 13

was submitted that on this very basis, the CIT (A) also ought to have felt
bound by the order passed by the Special Bench and ought not to have
required the Petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs.4.86 crores by way of an
interim order.

10.

Learned counsel for the Revenue, as expected, vehemently

opposed the writ petition and relied upon its various affidavits. It was
categorically asserted that no refund is due to the Petitioner and that the
figure of Rs.4.86 crores was arrived at only because the Petitioner itself
admitted that this was its tax liability for the assessment year 2003-04.
Accordingly, it was submitted that there is no question of granting any
further relief, let alone any stay in favour of the Petitioner. With regard
to the calculations on an across the board basis, learned counsel
submitted that each assessment year is an independent assessment year
and what this Court is concerned with is the assessment year 2003-04
and in so far as that assessment year is concerned, there is an admitted
liability of the Petitioner to pay Rs.4.86 crores by way of tax. The
general proposition that the Petitioner would be entitled to a refund (if
an adjustment is made across the board on the basis of the decision of

WP (C) No.839/2007

Page 7 of 13

the Special Bench) was not adverted to by the Revenue, although it was
submitted that the order passed by the Special Bench was not final in the
sense that an appeal had been filed under Section 260A of the Act in
this Court. It was further submitted by learned counsel for the Revenue
that as things stand today, there is factually no refund due to the
Petitioner.

11.

We may mention by way of completion of facts that for the

assessment year 2002-03 (the only other remaining assessment year), an
appeal filed by the Petitioner is pending before the CIT (A).

The

Petitioner has also asked for a stay of deposit in that appeal but it
appears that no order has as yet been passed by the CIT (A), one way or
the other.

12.

The Supreme Court stated, many years ago, in Union of

India v. Kamlakshi Finance Corporation Ltd., 1991 (55) ELT 433 as
follows:
“The principles of judicial discipline require that the orders
of the higher appellate authorities should be followed
unreservedly by the subordinate authorities.

WP (C) No.839/2007

Page 8 of 13

It was further observed by the Supreme Court that if the order of an
appellate authority is the subject matter of further appeal, that cannot
furnish any ground for not following it, unless its operation has been
suspended by a competent Court. The Supreme Court went on to say
that if this healthy rule is not followed, the result will not only be undue
harassment to assessees but chaos in the administration of tax laws.

13.

In Commissioner of Income Tax, Bhopal v. Ralson

Industries Ltd., (2007) 2 SCC 326, the Supreme Court held:“When an order is passed by a higher authority, the lower
authority is bound thereby keeping in view the principles of
judicial discipline.”

The Supreme Court drew support from Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd. v.
ITO, (1960) 40 ITR 618 wherein it was held:
“If a subordinate tribunal refuses to carry out directions
given to it by a superior tribunal in the exercise of its
appellate powers, the result will be chaos in the
administration of justice......”

It was further observed in Bhopal Sugar Industries:
“The Judicial Commissioner was not sitting in appeal over
the Tribunal and we do not think that in the circumstances of
this case it was open to him to say that the order of the
Tribunal was wrong and, therefore, there was no injustice in

WP (C) No.839/2007

Page 9 of 13

disregarding that order. As we have said earlier such a view
is destructive of one of the basic principles of administration
of justice.”

14.

Similarly, in Triveni Chemicals v. Union of India & Anr.,

(2007) 2 SCC 503, the Supreme Court reiterated the principle that
adjudicating authorities are bound by the doctrine of judicial discipline.

15.

Following the view laid down by the Supreme Court, we are

faced with a situation where there is admittedly an order passed by the
Special Bench of the Tribunal which considerably reduces the tax
liability of the Petitioner than what had been determined by the
Assessing Officer. That there would be a reduction in the liability is
evident from the decision given by the Tribunal in its order dated 29th
July, 2005 in respect of the assessment years 1999-2000 to 2001-02. All
that the Tribunal did in that order was to follow the tenets of judicial
discipline as laid down by the Supreme Court and on that basis grant
relief to the Petitioner. We are of the view that if the Tribunal can
follow its earlier order passed by the Special Bench, in keeping with the
high standards of judicial discipline, then there is absolutely no reason
why a subordinate authority such as the CIT (A) should feel hesitant to

WP (C) No.839/2007

Page 10 of 13

follow the order of the Special Bench and give relief to the Petitioner.

16.

What has apparently come in the way of the CIT (A) is the

impression carried by him (and which has been articulated by learned
counsel for the Revenue) that each assessment year has to be treated as
independent of the other and, therefore, the CIT (A) took the assessment
year 2003-04 by itself and applying the decision of the Special Bench of
the Tribunal granted relief to the Petitioner by requiring a deposit of
only Rs.4.86 crores. This is, of course, one possible way of looking at
the issue. However, it has to be remembered that the State is bound to
be fair to those with whom it has to deal with, and to the extent possible,
it must avoid any harassment to the assessee public without causing any
loss to the exchequer. Therefore, if one looks at the matter in a broader
perspective (and there is no reason why we should not), then it would be
necessary to take into account the tax liability of the Petitioner for the
entire period in respect of which the dispute is still alive, that is to say
from the assessment year 1997-98 till the assessment year 2003-04. If
this is done and an across the board review is taken of the tax liability of
the Petitioner as well as the amounts paid by the Petitioner, as has
actually been done by the Tribunal in its order dated 29th July, 2005,

WP (C) No.839/2007

Page 11 of 13

then the Petitioner would be entitled to a refund. On the other hand, if
each year is taken separately, then of course there would be a liability
against the Petitioner for the assessment year 2003-04 – but such a
narrow or constricted view does not commend itself to us since it would
unnecessarily deprive an assessee of good money due to it from the
Revenue. Looked at in this larger perspective, we are of the view that
the Petitioner would be entitled to the relief prayed for since it has, quite
clearly, paid more than the amount that is due if the order passed by the
Special Bench is implemented.

17.

In arriving at this conclusion, we have also taken note of the

fact that the order of the Special Bench has not been stayed and is still
operative and has in fact been given effect to by the Tribunal itself in its
order dated 29th July, 2005.

Consequently, we issue a writ of

mandamus and stay the requirement of the Petitioner having to deposit
Rs.4.86 crores till its appeal for the assessment year 2003-04 is
heard by the CIT (A). This would necessarily imply that the CIT (A)
should hear the appeal of the Petitioner for the assessment year 2003-04
without insisting on any deposit.
