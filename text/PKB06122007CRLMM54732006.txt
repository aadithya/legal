JUDGMENT
P.K.BHASIN, J:
This petition is filed by the petitioners under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 for quashing of FIR no. 588/2002 registered at Police Station
Mehrauli on 08.11.2002 for the offences under Sections 454/427/435/34 of
Indian Penal Code (‘I.P.C.’ in short) as also the case titled as “State v. Suraj
Prakash and Ors.” pending in the court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi.

2.

Brief facts leading to the controversy are that on 08.11.2002 at about 9.30

a.m., when respondents no. 2 & 3 were present in their shop, petitioners who were
having a shop opposite to their shop armed with sticks came to their shop and
complained about respondent no.2 having urinated last night near their shop and
on this an altercation took place and petitioners no. 1 & 3, out of whom petitioner
no. 3 is now dead, dragged the respondents no. 2 & 3 and started beating them
and on hearing their hue and cry respondent no. 4, wife of respondent no. 2 came
down and she was also beaten up by petitioner no. 2. In this tiff the respondents
received ‘simple’ injuries. It has further been alleged that the petitioners also
entered the shop of respondent no.2 and broke the glasses of his shop.
3.

Thereafter the matter was reported to the police and respondents no. 3 & 4

were medically examined at AIIMS and on the basis of the statement of
respondent no. 1 FIR was lodged. The police after investigating the matter filed
charge-sheet against the petitioners in the court of Metropolitan Magistrate under
Sections 341/324/427/506/341 I.P.C. where that case is pending trial.
4.

During the pendency of the criminal proceedings the petitioners and

respondents no. 2, 3 & 4 resolved their dispute and arrived at an amicable
settlement and thereafter the present petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. was filed
by the petitioners. Notice of the petition was given to the State and the respondent
nos. 2-4. On 10.09.2007 petitioners no. 2 and 3 and respondents no. 2-4 appeared
in Court and affirmed that the matter has been amicably resolved. Respondent no.

2 to 4 stated that they were no more interested in pursuing the case against the
petitioners.
5.

Learned APP for the State, however, opposed quashing of the FIR on the

ground that allegations against the petitioners are serious.
6.

It is now well settled that FIRs even in respect of those offences which are not

compoundable under Section 320 Cr.P.C. can be quashed as also the criminal
proceedings emanating therefrom if it is felt while dealing with a quashing petition
under Section 482 Cr.P.C. that it would secure the ends of justice if the FIR and
criminal proceedings arising therefrom are quashed and continuation of the
criminal proceedings would amount to abuse of the process of law. Reference in
this regard can be made to one judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in “B.S.
Joshi & Ors. Vs. State of Haryana & Anr.”, AIR 2003 SC 1386 where it has been so
held. Since the complainants in the present case have now no grievance against
the petitioners it would secure the ends of justice if the FIR registered against the
petitioners no. 2 and 3 and the ongoing trial against them are quashed.
7.

This petition is accordingly allowed and consequently FIR No. 588/2002

registered at Police Station Mehrauli for the offences under Sections
454/427/435/34 I.P.C. and the case titled as “State v. Suraj Prakash and Ors.”
pending in the court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi are hereby quashed.
