SANJIV KHANNA, J:

1. The present Appeal under Clause 10 of the Letters Patent Act is
th

directed against the Order dated 6 May, 2005 passed in W.P.(C)

LPA 374-2006

Page 2

No. 4984/2005 dismissing the Writ Petition filed by the appellant
herein.
2. Learned

counsel

for

the

appellant

had

submitted

that

compassionate and lenient view may be taken and the appellant
may be allotted a MIG Flat at the current costs. In this regard he
had relied upon the decision of the Division Bench of this Court
th

dated 28 March, 2005 passed in LPA No. 61/2005 titled Vimal
Marwah versus Delhi Development Authority and another and
LPA No. 731/2003 titled Balber Prasad Jain versus Delhi
Development Authority. It was also submitted that there is no
document on record to establish that the appellant was informed
that he was successful in the draw of lots held in 1993.
3. The appellant had registered himself under the SFS Scheme
floated by Delhi Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as
DDA, for short) in 1985 for category II flat. He had deposited
Rs.10,000/- with the DDA.
4. As per the Scheme, DDA was to periodically intimate/inform about
availability of flats constructed under the Scheme in different

LPA 374-2006

Page 3

areas. This intimation/ information was given by taking out press
advertisements and inviting applications from the registrants under
the Scheme.
5. In 1987 and 1990, DDA had invited applications and the appellant
applied for being considered for allocation of a flat but was not
successful.

In 1993, the appellant again applied and he was

allotted a MIG flat in Rohini.
6. The appellant however claims that he was never informed about
the said allotment. Learned counsel for the appellant in this regard
had referred to Section 43(1) of the Delhi Development Act, which
requires that notice should be send under registered post. It was
submitted that there was nothing on record to establish that the
appellant was informed about the allotment of the MIG flat by
registered post.

The appellant also claims that he had made

repeated visits to the office of DDA between 1993-2004 but failed
to get positive response and was compelled to file the aforesaid
Writ Petition which stands dismissed by the impugned judgment.
7. We have examined the original file produced by DDA. Records

LPA 374-2006

Page 4

show that the appellant was successful in the draw of lots held on
rd

23 March, 1993 and was allotted MIG Flat in Block 11, Rohini.
The estimated cost of the flat was Rs.5,61,400/-. Office copy of
the said letter is available on record. “Registered A.D.” is written
on the top right hand corner of the said letter. There is no
correspondence or letter written by the appellant during the period
1993-2004. The first letter available on record is dated 23

rd

January, 2004. The said letter, however, has been captioned as
'third reminder' and

states that two other letters were written

earlier. The so-called letters written earlier were not filed along
with the writ petition. There is no evidence or material to show that
th

the appellant had written any letter till 24 January, 2004. It was
admitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that from 1993
till 2002, DDA had from time to time invited applications from
registrants for allocation of flats under construction in different
areas. During this period from 1993-2002, the appellant did not
apply for allotment of any flat. This may be contrasted with three
applications for allotment made by the appellant during the period

LPA 374-2006

Page 5

from 1985-1993. Learned Single Judge in para 7 of the impugned
judgment has specifically recorded that the counsel appearing for
the appellant admitted that the appellant was aware that he was
successful in the draw of lots in 1993 and consequently he
stopped applying to the subsequent notices/advertisement. The
statement was reiterated before us. If the appellant was aware and
had knowledge about his allotment in 1993, as admitted, and had
not received any allotment letter, he would have certainly written to
the DDA. In the present case, it is admitted that there is no letter
and correspondence written by the appellant during the period
1993-2004. This period is more than 11 years. It appears that the
appellant was not interested in the flat at Rohini and therefore took
his chance.
8. It may be relevant to state here that DDA had stated in the counter
affidavit

that

they

weed

out

records

relating

to

letters/communications sent by registered post after every three
years. In these circumstances, they

can not now

produce

records to show that the letter of allotment in 1993 was sent to the

LPA 374-2006

Page 6

appellant by registered post. The appellant having belatedly
approached the Court after nearly 11 years is guilty of laches as
he himself claims that he was aware of allotment in 1993. In these
circumstances, no fault can also be found with the DDA in not
preserving and keeping the records relating to

the letter of

allotment sent under registered post. In any case, the appellant
has admitted that he had knowledge of allotment in 1993,
therefore the allegation that he had never received letter of
allotment is of no consequence. It was for the appellant to
approach DDA if he had not received the letter of allotment within
reasonable time or at least write to DDA.
9. DDA has also explained that SFS Scheme in question was
scrapped in 2002 after allotments were made to all the applicants
who were interested. As the said Scheme has been closed, the
appellant cannot now claim allotment of any flat under the said
Scheme. We do not think any direction should be issued to DDA to
allot a flat to the appellant at the current cost after the Scheme
was closed in 2002. It is well known that there is difference

LPA 374-2006

Page 7

between the current cost charged by the DDA and the market
value of the flats. The appellant wants to take advantage of the
same. Admittedly, the appellant did not apply between the period
1993-2002 when repeatedly applications were invited by DDA from
the registrants for allocation of flats. Issuing direction to DDA to
offer a flat to the appellant at this stage will deprive some one who
would be entitled to allotment. If the appellant is still interested and
wants to acquire any flat he will have to be treated at par with
others and not differently.
10.

Order of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Vimal

Marwah (supra) is in a different context. In the said case the
registrant had filed a writ petition in 1996 but the same was
dismissed. Thereafter, an appeal was filed and DDA accepted her
request for allotment of flat at the current cost. Order passed by
the Court specifically records that the same was being passed in
view of peculiar circumstances of the case and as the registrant
had been dragged into litigation from 1992 i.e. before the Scheme
was scrapped. The said Order cannot be regarded as laying down

LPA 374-2006

Page 8

any ratio or precedent.
11.We entirely agree with the findings of the learned Single Judge
that the Writ Petition filed in 2004 was highly belated and bad for
laches. Nothing prevented the appellant from approaching the
Court within reasonable time if he had any grievance. The conduct
of the appellant is also indicative of the fact that he was fully aware
of the allotment made to him in 1993, as he had stopped applying
thereafter. Learned Single Judge has rightly refused to accept the
contention that the appellant used to visit DDA for a period of ten
years. Learned Single Judge has also specifically recorded that
public notices were issued in 2002 regarding closure of the
Scheme.
12. It may be noted here that the learned Single Judge has already
directed DDA to refund the amount paid by the appellant towards
registration fee within four weeks with interest as per its policy. In
these circumstances, we find no merit in the present Appeal. The
appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
