Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat (Open Court)
IA 13646/2006 (u/S.8 of Arbitration Act)
1.

This is an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration

and Conciliation Act, 1996 by the defendant who has also invoked the
provisions of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC.
2.

The plaintiff sued the defendant for decree of possession

in respect of premises No.Shanti Villa, Khasra No.810/2, Main Road,
Chattarpur Extension, New Delhi. The plaintiff has inter alia averred
that the defendant was given possession of the suit property on

CS(OS) 1987/2006

1 of 5

14.8.2003, through a deed executed by both parties. It is alleged that
the defendant agreed to pay a monthly rent of Rs.51,000/-.

The

plaintiff further alleges that the defendant's monthly tenancy was
terminated by notice dated 17.8.2006 under Section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act and thereafter defendant continued in
unauthorized occupation.
3.

The defendant, in the application, has accused the plaintiff

of not revealing material facts relating to the lease deed and existence
of an arbitration clause in it. It has produced a copy of the said lease
deed in support of the application and claimed that the disputes in the
suit ought to be referred to arbitration in accordance with the said
condition, i.e. clause 11. The said clause reads as follows:-

“11. All the disputes or differences,
whatsoever arising between the parties out of
or relating to the construction, meaning,
operation or effect to this agreement or the
breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration
in accordance with the rules and regulations of
the Indian Council of Arbitration and the
award made in pursuance thereof shall be
binding on both the parties.”
4.

In support of the application, learned senior counsel

contended that once the parties agreed to have their disputes
resolved through arbitration and provided for it, through an agreed
mechanism like clause 11, they were bound by it and the Court,
consistent with that agreement should not proceed to adjudicate the

dispute but refer the parties to arbitration. He also adverted to the
averments

in

the

Understanding(MOU)

application
dated

about

a

Memorandum

between

the

of

parties.

According to counsel, the said document also contains a similar
stipulation, which amounted to arbitration clause. That condition has
been reproduced in para 6 of the application.
5.

The plaintiff in its reply has refuted the contention and

submitted that this Court cannot refer the disputes to arbitration
since the lease deed upon which the defendant - applicant relies is an
unregistered document. In addition, the plaintiff avers and its counsel
contends that reliance on the MOU is misplaced as it is a contested
document in respect of which a First Information Report (FIR) has
been registered and investigations are on.

Counsel additionally

contended that the defendant's petition under Section 482 of the
Criminal Procedure Code for quashing of that First Information
Report, has been dismissed, by this Court.
6.

Learned counsel submitted by placing reliance on the two

judgments

of

this

Court

reported

as

RANI

GUPTA VS.

S.R.SACHDEVA,

2000-(001)-ARBLR-0437-DEL that arbitration agreements contained
in unregistered lease deeds (which are compulsorily registrable under

CS(OS) 1987/2006

3 of 5

Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908), and have to be duly
stamped in accordance with the provisions of Stamps Act, cannot be
relied upon by the Court; that the Court would be within its rights to
reject application under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act.
7.

There is no doubt that clause 11 of the deed relied upon in

this case does amount to an arbitration clause.

The question,

however, is whether this alone is sufficient for the Court to refer the
disputes that are subject matter of the present proceedings to
arbitration. In Bimla Rani Gupta (supra), this Court stated that a
lease deed or rent agreement which requires registration, but is not
actually registered, cannot be seen even if it contains an arbitration
clause. The Court had noticed an earlier ruling in SMT. DARSHAN

KAPUR VS. TILAK RAJ, 1982 RLR 516, and held that similar
applications under the old Arbitration Act were not maintainable.
Applying the said issue, this Court held that an application under
Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 could not be
maintained.
8.

In the subsequent judgment in CHEMICALS SALES

(supra), the Court took into consideration all relevant authorities on
the issue and concluded that recourse to Section 8 would be
permissible if the Court is empowered to look into the document. If

registrable, in fact is not registered, the Court, regardless of its

to

In view of these decisions, it has to be held that

irrespective of clause 11 of the lease deed, which is unregistered in
this case, disputes cannot be referred to arbitration.
9.

As regards the applicability of the clause 11 in the alleged

MOU, it would be relevant to notice that the applicant – defendant has
already preferred another proceedings, i.e. CS(OS) 8835/2006, which
is said to be pending on the file of this Court. Furthermore, at this
stage, when the genuineness and veracity of the document is in
question, it would be unwise for the Court to assume the binding
nature of the arbitration agreement said to be in MOU.
10.

In view of the above reasons, the relief claimed in the

application cannot be granted.
IA 13646/2006 is accordingly dismissed.
CS(OS) 1987/2006
Defendants shall file their written statement within four
weeks.
