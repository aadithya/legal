Since the disputes involved in these petitions are common, the
same were heard together and are being disposed of vide this
common order. However, for the sake of brevity, facts of OMP
No. 465/2005 are taken.

Petitioner No.2, as sole proprietor of petitioner No.1, responded
to the Notice Inviting Tenders (NIT) issued by respondent Delhi
Transport Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ‘DTC’) for
appointment of area-wise agents for display of advertisement
boards on the DTC Bus Queue Shelters (for short, ‘BQS’) and
Time Keeping Booths (for short, ‘TKB’) for a period of three
years. He was declared a successful bidder in respect of 7 zones
and was granted sole advertisement rights on all the BQSs and
TKBs in respect of the above-said zones for a period of three
years. The names of the zones, licence fee payable and the date
of allotment, in a tabulated form, are as under :S.No.

This monthly licence fee, as per the terms of allotment, was
payable in equal proportions to the DTC and the MCD. In the
event of delay, late payment of charges @ 2% p.m. are payable.
The petitioners were also to make deposit of security amount,
equivalent to three months licence fee payable in equal
proportions, to the DTC and MCD respectively.

for

Rs.31,62,504/-, in respect of other zones the security could not
be deposited by the petitioners by due date and they requested
the respondent for extension of time to furnish the bank
guarantee for the remaining allotments.
4.

Insofar as payment of licence fee is concerned, case of the
petitioners is that it was paid upto 30.10.2005.

One of the

terms of the allotment is that licence fee is payable as per the
actual number of BQSs and TKBs in a particular zone and if in a
given month the number of BQSs and TKBs increase or decrease,
the licence fee shall also be proportionately increased or
decreased. Obviously the allotment of these BQSs and TKBs was
for the purpose of display of advertisement thereon by the
petitioners. Petitioners could book the advertisement from the
prospective

advertisers

and

charge

them

accordingly.

Therefore, according to the petitioners, availability of BQSs and
TKBs in a particular zone becomes important.

The petitioners

also state that it is obligatory on the part of the respondent to
conduct such surveys/investigation to find out the exact number
of BQSs and TKBS in a particular zone.

This is important

because in view of mass infrastructural development going on in
the entire city in the form of building and widening of roads,
construction of new flyovers and other infrastructural activities,
these shelters are being dismantled, removed and demolished.
Petitioners, therefore, made representations and requested the
respondent to carry out joint inspection/survey as various
shelters were removed. However, respondent did not pay any
OMP No. 465 & 466/2005

Page 3 of 13

heed to these requests.

Even on certain occasions when the

survey was carried out, the respondent did not give full effect to
such surveys as it deliberately did not give due adjustment in
respect of the missing and/or non-existing shelters.
giving

such

adjustments

and

reducing

the

Without

licence

fee

proportionately, respondent has been pressuring the petitioners
to pay full amounts of monthly licence fee as per the original
agreement. This act on the part of the respondent is perceived
by the petitioner as arbitrary and illegal as the petitioners are
entitled to proportionate reduction in the licence fee.

Thus,

according to the petitioners disputes and differences have
arisen on the question of proportionate reduction of licence fee,
which depends on the exact availability of BQSs and TKBs and
the amount payable on that basis.

Agreement entered into

between the parties contains arbitration clause, i.e. Clause 34,
in case of disputes, the operative part of which is reproduced
below :“34.

ARBITRATION IN CASE OF DISPUTE

a.
There shall be a Dispute Settlement Committee
which shall try to settle all disputes at the first stage.
The Dispute Settlement Committee shall consist of CGM,
Addl. CAO, concerned Dy. CGM and Sr. Manager Law. If
the Committee fails to resolve the issue, it shall be
referred for arbitration. Chairman-cum-M.D. Shall be the
final authority in all litigation/arbitration.
He can
nominate any arbitrator for settlement of disputes.
Chairman-cum-M.D.'s decision shall be final and binding
on all the parties. All questions and disputes between
the parties, the settlement of which has not been herein
specifically recorded, shall be referred to the Sole
arbitration of the Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Delhi
Transport Corporation or any other officer so nominated
and appointed by him. There shall be no bar to the
reference of dispute to the arbitration of such an officer
of the Corporation appointed by the Chairman-cumManaging Director even though the said officer may have
dealt with the matter and had expressed his opinion
thereon.”

Since, according to the petitioners, disputes and differences
have arisen between the parties as to their respective rights and
obligations under the agreement/contract in question, which are
to be adjudicated upon in the manner specified in clause 34,
petitioners are in the process of invoking the said arbitration
clause. In the meantime, present petition is filed under Section
9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 praying for
temporary injunction to the effect that respondent be restrained
from terminating the allotment/contract of the petitioner,
and/or, from interfering in any manner whatsoever in the display
of commercial advertisements of the petitioner on BQSs and
TKBs of the respondent being displayed and ought to be
displayed under its aforesaid contract/allotment in respect of
the above 7 zones.

the respondent from terminating

contract. After notice, matter came up for hearing on 31.1.2006
when direction was given to the petitioners to make payment of
the licence fee as per the agreement without prejudice to the
rights and contentions of the parties in this petition.

Taking

note of the arbitration clause which provides for Dispute
Settlement Committee, it was also directed that the said
Committee shall try to settle all disputes in the first instance.
Petitioners were directed to make a request for settlement of
dispute by the said Committee without one week from that date
with directions to the Committee to endeavour to resolve the
disputes as early as possible.

It is inter alia stated that the petitioner was found to be the
highest bidder (H-1) in the 7 zones and was awarded the
contract for advertisement on the BQSss and TKBs of the said
zones. Award letters were accordingly issued accepting the bid
of the petitioners provisionally and requiring it to complete the
formalities within seven days of the issue of the award letters.
These formalities included payment of advance licence fee and
security deposit equivalent to three months licence fee of each
zone in the shape of bank guarantee of an agreement for the
contract of each zone separately with the respondent.

The

petitioners, however, failed to complete these formalities in
time.

Number of reminders were sent to the petitioners;

however, in respect of six zones petitioners have not submitted
the bank guarantees. All these letters sent for completing these
formalities are collectively filed as Annexure R-1.

It is stated

that the petitioners executed the agreement belatedly on
25.7.2005 and 9.11.2005. The petitioners were also in the habit
of making delayed payments of licence fee, repair
maintenance charges and interest

and

and because of these

irregular payments number of letters were written to the
petitioners from time to time.

The matter was strenuously argued by both sides and orders
were reserved on earlier occasion. However, after some time the
matter was listed again as it was felt that clarification on certain
aspects is required.

After the listing of the matter afresh, it

took different direction.

and

Better sense prevailed on both the

set

in.

The

petitioners

approached the respondent for reconciliation of accounts. They
also offered to make payment of entire undisputed amount. The
petitioners also permitted the respondent to encash the bank
guarantees given by them against the outstanding payments. In
these circumstances, following common order in respect of both
the petitions was passed on 28.7.2006 :“Learned counsel for the petitioner states that petitioner
has approached the respondent for reconciliation of the
accounts. He further mentions that petitioner has offered
to make payment of entire undisputed amount.
He
submits that he has even permitted the respondent to
encash the bank guarantees given by the petitioner
against the outstanding payments. Mr. Maniktala, learned
OMP No. 465 & 466/2005

Page 7 of 13

counsel for the petitioner, further assures that the entire
admitted outstanding amount payable till 31.7.2006 shall
be paid by the first week of August 2006. The license fee
as well as repair and maintenance charges etc. under the
contract for the month of August 2006 shall be paid by
the end of August 2006. He further states that for
ongoing contracts, fresh bank guarantees shall be
furnished by 7th August 2006. For future period also, the
charges shall be paid regularly and in time. To resolve
the issue regarding missing shelters etc., the petitioner
shall approach the Dispute Settlement Committee on
4.8.2006 at 3.00 p.m.
List on 1st September 2006.
Dasti to counsel for the parties.”

10.

On subsequent dates, orders were passed from time to time
which would indicate that the petitioners kept on complying with
certain directions.

In respect of 12 agreements, instead of

furnishing bank guarantees, the petitioners gave 12 cheques
representing the amount of the bank guarantees. In respect of
two zones, namely, Karol Bagh and West Zone-II, as bank
guarantees were not furnished, on 1.9.2006 order was passed
permitting the respondent to terminate those contracts. During
this period, the petitioners had been paying the licence fee as
well, though belatedly.
11.

The main dispute was about 117 BQS which was referred to the
Grievance Settlement Committee. On 1.9.2006, following order
was passed in respect of settlement of these 117 BQS :“There are about 1900 Bus Queue Shelters (BQS) which
are covered by the aforesaid 14 contracts. The dispute
is in respect of 117 BQSs which is pending before the
Grievance Settlement Committee.
In respect of
remaining BQSs since there is no dispute, there is no
reason not to make payment of licence fee as per the
contract in respect of those BQSs. Representative of the
petitioner shall visit the office of the Chief General
Manager on 4.9.2006 at 5:00 PM for reconciliation of the
statement of dues as far as arrears are concerned. It is
stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner on
instructions that in so far as dues of August 2006 are
concerned, the same shall be paid before the next date.
He further states that the petitioner shall endeavour to
clear the dues for September 2006.”

The Dispute Settlement Committee filed its report in February
2007. DTC were to calculate financial implications based on the
said report.

The gist of this report and the disputes which

remained to be resolved are set out in the order dated
20.2.2007 and regarding 26 BQS, in respect of which dispute
persisted, the matter was referred for mediation.

It would,

therefore, be appropriate to reproduce this order in entirety,
which is to the following effect :“The petitioner had, on an earlier occasion, raised
dispute in respect of 117 Bus Queue Shelters (hereinafter
called the 'Shelters'), which, according to the petitioner,
were non-existent and the licence fee in respect of those
shelters was demanded by the respondent-DTC. It was
directed that Dispute Settlement Committee would go
into this aspect. As per the report of the Dispute
Settlement Committee, which has been filed, particulars
of 13 shelters were repeated and, therefore, the dispute
was only in respect of 104 shelters. These are divided
into three categories. In Category A, 38 shelters are
mentioned in respect of which the respondent-DTC had
already agreed to give the rebate. Category B gives the
particulars of 40 shelters in respect of which the
Settlement Committee has recommended grant of rebate
to the petitioner. In Category C, particulars of remaining
26 shelters are given and in respect of these shelters, it
is stated in the report that the petitioner is not entitled
to any rebate. It is agreed by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that the bills for licence fee, which are raised
by the respondent-DTC do not include these 38 shelters.
In respect of 40 shelters covered by Category B, it is
stated by the learned counsel for the respondent-DTC
that the exact amount of rebate to which the petitioner
would be entitled, is being worked out, which should not
be more than Rs.40 lacs. The exact figure shall be
worked out within one week and communicated to the
petitioner. The dispute, therefore, remains in respect of
26 shelters, particulars whereof are given in Category C
of the report.
Learned counsel for the respondent
states, on instructions, that the respondent has no
objection if dispute regarding these 26 shelters is
referred for mediation. It is also agreed between the
parties that in case mediation fails, the matter can be
adjudicated by the process of arbitration as per the
arbitration clause in the contract.
Learned counsel for the petitioner states
that in addition to the aforesaid shelters, report in
respect of which is filed by the Dispute Settlement
Committee, the petitioner has been writing to the
respondent-DTC about other shelters, which were
demolished after January 2006. He submits that the
notices in respect of these shelters were given from time
OMP No. 465 & 466/2005

Page 9 of 13

to time indicating the particulars of those shelters and
the dates from which they were demolished, for one
reason or the other. The petitioner shall, within two
days, give particulars of all these shelters in a tabulated
form to the respondent-DTC along with copies of the
letters, which were written pointing out demolition of
these shelters to the respondent. Learned counsel for
the respondent states that the position in respect of
these shelters shall also be verified and report submitted
within four weeks.
Orders have been passed from time to time
directing the petitioner to give the licence fee regularly.
Learned counsel for the respondent informs that the
petitioner has been giving post-dated cheques.
However, it is not disputed that if there is delay in
payment, the petitioner is paying interest also for the
delayed period in terms of the agreement.
The
petitioner shall file an affidavit of the payments given
and the interest component included in those payments,
within one week from today.
The Managing
Director/Chairman of the petitioner shall also file
affidavit to the same effect.
Undertaking given by
Mr.Amrit Pal Singh, who is present in the Court, is
reiterated to the effect that all these cheques would be
honoured on presentation.
Mr. Singh states that
cheques towards licence fee for February 2007 has
already been handed over to the respondent-DTC today.
Dispute regarding 26 shelters covered by
Category C of the report is referred to the Delhi High
Court Mediation and Conciliation Centre. Parties shall
appear before the said Mediation Centre on 28.2.2006 at
3:30 PM.
List before the Court for further proceedings
as well as to await the report of the Mediation Centre on
29.3.2007.”

13.

Without taking specific note of further developments, suffice is
to state that the mediation has succeeded and the Mediator has
submitted the report. It is agreed that both the parties would
be bound thereby and act thereon.

That apart, the disputes

which now persists are of the following nature :(i)

the petitioners had been paying the licence fee belatedly
and had undertaken that for late payment they would pay
the interest. The interest component, as calculated by the
DTC, is substantial.

The petitioners are disputing the

same. There is, thus, a dispute about the exact amount
payable as interest on late payments and licence fee. The
petitioner shall give his calculations within two weeks
OMP No. 465 & 466/2005

Page 10 of 13

indicating the amount payable on this account. In case of
dispute, the matter shall be dealt with in accordance with
the arbitration clause;
(ii)

the contract period in respect of some of the zones have
expired which are not renewed. However, in respect of
those zones, namely, South Zone-I, South Zone-III, South
Zone-IV, Civil Lines-II, Najafgarh(R)–I and City Zone-I,
though the contract expired in November 2007, monthly
extension was given, i.e. up to 7.12.2007. Though there
was no formal extension thereafter, in anticipation of
further extension by one month, the petitioners had given
a sum of Rs.1 crore in the form of demand draft and
cheque on 13.12.2007. As the contract was not awarded
to anybody and the aforesaid amount was given, on
20.12.2007 order was passed extending this contract by
one month, i.e. up to 7.1.2008. After 7.1.2008, there is no
further extension and the DTC does not want to give
another extension.

The petitioners, however, point out

that on 3.1.2008, they had given cheques representing the
licence fee as well as separate cheques for repairs and
maintenance for these six zones for a period from
8.1.2008 to 7.2.2008.

Though the cheques towards

licence fee have not been encashed as these were the postdated cheques, cheques for repair and maintenance have
been encashed, which are for a total sum of Rs.1,57,343/-.
These cheques were given along with covering letter dated
3.1.2008 mentioning that they are for the period from
8.1.2008 to 7.2.2008. Even if the contract is not extended
OMP No. 465 & 466/2005

Page 11 of 13

beyond 8.1.2008 and the petitioners are directed to
remove their hoardings, it may taken about two weeks
from today.
January 2008.

This process would take us to the end of
It would, therefore, be more appropriate

and even in the interest of DTC to extend the contract till
7.2.2008 in respect of these six zones as well, more
particularly, when the cheques representing the amount
towards repairs and maintenance for this period have been
encashed by the DTC. This is more so when contract in
respect of various other zones is expiring on 7.2.2008;
(iii)

the petitioners shall not be entitled to any further
extension in respect of these six zones beyond 7.2.2008.
Even in respect of other zones, on the expiry of the term of
the contract, it would be open for the DTC to treat those
contracts as over and there would not be any right with
the petitioners to seek any extension;

(iv)

in case the Sales-Tax authorities impose service tax, it is
considered that that shall be the liability of the petitioner,
as per the agreement;

(v)

the other contracts shall, however, be not terminated
prematurely. This would be subject to the condition that
the petitioners continue to pay the licence fee, as per the
contract, in time.

Learned counsel for the DTC had

informed that the security deposit in respect of certain
contracts is to be replenished as the earlier security has
been appropriated towards the monthly licence fee which
was due from the petitioners.

The petitioners shall

deposit the said security as well within one week of
OMP No. 465 & 466/2005

Page 12 of 13

informing the amount; and
(vi)

insofar as the disputes are concerned, Mr. Tripathi,
learned senior counsel appearing for the DTC, fairly
agreed that those would be settled as per the mechanism
provided in the contract. It was agreed that the petitioners
shall enlist those disputes and forward the same to the
Chairman, DTC.

Likewise, the DTC also shall make its

claims, if any, against the petitioners by writing a letter
within one week to the Chairman, DTC and within two
weeks thereafter, as per the arbitration clause/mechanism
provided in the contract, steps would be taken by the
Chairman.
14.

The petitions are disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
