:

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

Petitioner (DH) is aggrieved by an order dated

27.11.1999 passed by the Executing Court holding that execution
proceedings had to be dropped as claim of the decree holder
stood satisfied.
2.

Facts have been correctly noted in the impugned

order. I cull out the relevant facts from the same.
3.

The ex-parte decree in sum of Rs.40,340/- was

obtained by the decree holder. An application under order 39
page 1 of 4

Rule 13 CPC was filed. The same was allowed vide order dated
8.9.1995 but subject to the term that a bank guarantee would be
furnished to secure the decretal amount.

In the meanwhile,

decree holder had put the decree in execution. The execution
petition was also tagged with the main suit. Bank guarantee
limited in sum of Rs.30,000/- was furnished.
4.

On 27.2.1996 orders were passed that the decree

stands since term of recall was not complied with.

Sum of

Rs.30,000/- secured by the bank guarantee was directed to be
released to the petitioner.
5.

Remaining decree was sought to be got executed. On

7.4.1998 a compromise was arrived at in the execution petition
under which decree holder received Rs.15,000/- by means of a
cheque in full and final satisfaction of all claims. The decree was
held to be satisfied. Unfortunately, the cheque bounced. On an
application filed the execution was restored.

On 15.5.1998

judgment debtor tendered pay order in sum of Rs.15,000/-. The
same was received by the decree holder.

On same day an

application under Section 151 CPC was filed praying that balance
decree be got executed.
6.
settlement

Learned

Executing

effected

on

Court

has

opined

that

the

7.4.1998 was an accord, satisfaction

whereof would have satisfied the decree. Since banker's cheque
page 2 of 4

was received in lieu of the dishonoured cheque it was held that
the decree stands satisfied in its entirety.
7.

As noted by the Division Bench of this Court in the

decision dated 4.3.2003 in FAO (OS) NO.417/2001 M/s. Jindal
Aromatic Vs. South Coast Spices Exports Pvt. Ltd. an accord
discharges the performance of obligations under a contract. The
dispute

pertaining

to

satisfaction

furnishes

a

fresh

and

independent cause of action, in that until and unless it is
established that the performance of the satisfaction was a
condition precedent for discharge under the contract, if promise is
received in satisfaction, it is a good satisfaction, but if the
performance and not the promise is intended to operate in
satisfaction,

then

there

will

be

no

satisfaction

without

performance. Wherever there is an accord, obligations under the
original contract would be discharged until and unless it is
specifically provided that the performance of the satisfaction
would discharge the obligation under the contract.
8.

In the instant case, decree holder did not reserve right

by making it clear to the court that the banker's cheque being
received by him was not in lieu of the dishonoured cheque but
was without prejudice to his right to continue with the execution
proceedings.
9.

I find no merits in the petition.
