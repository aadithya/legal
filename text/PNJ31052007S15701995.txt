PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
Reliefs claimed in the suit are as follows:(a)

decree for possession in respect of premises bearing
No. 6 & 7, in Block E, Saraswati Bhawan, inner Circular
road, Connaught Place, New Delhi-110 001, more
specifically shown in red colour in the plan filed
alongwith the plaint.

(b)

Decree for mesne profit @ Rs. 4,56,510/- from 1st May,
1995 till such time the plaintiff is able to obtain
possession of the premises alongwith interest at the
rate of 18 per cent per annum on the amount of mesne
profits found due which interest is to form part of
mesne profit.

(c)

Decree for a sum of Rs.15,627.50 being the arrears of
rent as shown in the schedule to the plaint alongwith

CS(OS) No.1570/1995

Page 1 of 11

interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the time
the amount fell due till such time that payment is
received.
(d)
2.

Costs of the suit be awarded to the plaintiffs.
At the outset I may note that in prayer 'C' amount

actually claimed is Rs.15,62,750/- as would be evident from para
8 of the plaint. There is obviously a typographic error in prayer
'C'.
3.

Cause set up in the plaint is that the plaintiffs are the

owners of property bearing No. 6 & 7, Saraswati Bhawan, Block E,
Saraswati Bhawan, Inner Circular Road, Connaught Place, New
Delhi-110001. That the same comprises of a basement, a ground
floor, a first floor and a second floor. That the property was let
out to the Union of India i.e. defendant No. 1 vide agreement
dated 1st August, 1994 at a monthly rent of Rs.2,28,255/-. That
the lease period was commencing from 11th November 1993 and
was to expire on 11th November 1995. That Union of India was
irregular in paying the rent and arrears in sum of Rs.15,75,627/had accumulated. That vide notice dated 6.3.1995 the tenancy
was determined and since possession was not handed over,
plaintiffs had no option but to file the suit. That since the rent
was more than Rs.3500/- per month, Union of India did not have
the protection of the Delhi Rent Control Act.
4.

When the plaint was filed, only Union of India was

impleaded as a defendant.

It filed a written statement

questioning the notice determining the lease. It was pleaded that

CS(OS) No.1570/1995

Page 2 of 11

under the lease, Union of India had an option to extend the lease
period and that the option was exercised.

It was denied that

Union of India was in arrears of rent.
5.

For unexplainable reasons, a simple suit lingered on

without any meaningful progress.

Interim orders were passed

directing Union of India to pay the agreed monthly rent till
disposal of the suit.
6.

Noting that Union of India had not complied with the

interim orders passed directing that agreed monthly rent would
be paid each month till suit was disposed of, vide order dated
5.2.2001, defence of Union of India was struck of.
7.

On 16th July, 2001, the counsel for the plaintiffs stated

that without prejudice to the right of the plaintiffs they would like
to lead evidence so that the suit could be disposed of.
8.

Pursuant to the said statement, the plaintiffs were

permitted to lead evidence. On 11.12.2001 part statement of Shri
V.P.Puri (plaintiff No.1) was recorded as statement of PW-1.
Further statement of PW-1 by way of examination in chief was
recorded on 26th February 2002. He was cross examined on 14th
February 2002.
9.

That no further evidence was recorded thereafter. On

11th April 2002, learned counsel for the plaintiffs made a
statement that evidence of the plaintiffs may be treated as
closed.

CS(OS) No.1570/1995

Page 3 of 11

10.

That as per the clause '4' of the agreement dated 1st

August 1994, without the consent of the plaintiffs, the defendant
i.e. Union of India was entitled to sub-let the whole or any part or
parts of the demised premises. The said clause reads as under:“4.

11.

The Government shall have the right to sublet
the whole or any part or parts of the said
premises without the consent of the Lessor but
shall be responsible for the full payment of rent.”
That pursuant to the power vested in it under clause 4

of the agreement a major portion of the tenanted premises was
let out to Delhi State Financial Corporation (in short DFC).
12.

That DFC was of the opinion that it should be

impleaded as a party in the suit since it could possibly be affected
by a decision in the suit, for if a high mean profits was awarded,
the money would ultimately go out of its coffers.

DFC filed an

application seeking impleadment. Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of
Civil Procedure was relied upon. The application was registered
as IA No. 3574 of 2002.
13.

The said application was dismissed vide order dated 7th

January, 2003. Appeal was filed against the order dated 7.1.2003.
It was registered as F.A.O.(OS) No. 81 of 2003. The appeal was
dismissed vide order dated 2nd April, 2003.
14.

DFC challenged the order in appeal before the

Supreme Court vide Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.
17685 of 2003.
15.

The petition succeeded.

Vide order dated 16th July,

2004, Supreme Court ordered the impleadment of DFC as a

CS(OS) No.1570/1995

Page 4 of 11

proper party. DFC was granted time to file a written statement
and further pleadings in the suit.
16.

The order dated 16th July, 2004 reads as under :
“

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4148 OF 2004
[arising out of SLP (C) No. 17685/2003]

Delhi Financial Corporation
V.P. Puri & Ors.

Versus

ORDER
Leave granted.

….

Appellant(s)

… Respondent(s)

Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
The respondents are the owners of a building in
Delhi. The building was let out to the Union of India as per
a lease deed dt. 1st August, 1994. The appellant Delhi
Financial Corporation claims that they are the sub-lessee in
possession of this building under the Union of India by
virtue of Clause (4) of the lease deed executed by the
Union of India in favour of the respondents. They filed an
application to implead themselves in the suit filed by the
respondents but the prayer was rejected by the learned
Single Judge and that was challenged before the Division
Bench and Division Bench too rejected the prayer of the
respondents.
The counsel for the appellant submits that the
building has been in occupation of the appellant since it
was leased to the Union of India and the appellant
Corporation is a proper party for the proceedings for
eviction. The Union of India had on earlier occasion filed
application to implead this appellant and the same was
rejected. Counsel pointed out that the appellant was not a
party to that proceedings and the common order was
passed therein. It is also submitted that appellant is
directly paying rent to the landlords.
Counsel for the respondents seriously objects to the
impleadment of the appellant Delhi Financial Corporation
and it is contended that the appellant Corporation is not a
sub-lessee and may be permissive occupant under the
Union of India. It is also submitted that impleadment of
the appellant would protract the litigation proceedings
and the respondents would not be in a position to recover
the possession within a reasonsble time.
CS(OS) No.1570/1995

Page 5 of 11

Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the
case, we feel that Appellant Corporation would be a proper
party for the proceedings as the disputes between the
parties would be effectively settled. The learned Single
Judge, before whom the matter is pending, is directed to
implead the Delhi Financial Corporation as second
defendant in the suit. The appellant shall file the written
statement within four weeks from today and the Court is
requested to dispose of the Suit at in early date.
[Emphasis supplied]

17.

The appellant Corporation shall not seek adjournment on
any flimsy ground. The appeal is disposed of.”
Pursuant to the order dated 16th July, 2004 passed by

the Supreme Court DFC was formally impleaded as a defendant
No.2 and a written statement was filed by DFC. Thereafter, the
matter was listed before the learned Joint Registrar for completion
of pleadings and filing documents.
18.

The suit stagnated without any progress in the suit for

the reason the plaintiffs filed an application registered as IA No.
3980 of 2005 under Order 12 Rule 6 CPC seeking a decree on
admission.
19.

That when said application was being heard, as

recorded in the order dated 13th December 2005, DFC which by
then came in possession of the entire property as a sub tenant
under Union of India stated before the Court, as recorded in the
order dated 13th December 2005, that it would vacate the
premises.
20.

Before handing over possession of the premises, DFC

raked up an issue.

CS(OS) No.1570/1995

It pleaded that the offer to hand over

Page 6 of 11

possession was conditional upon the plaintiffs foregoing relief of
mesne profits.
21.

By a detailed order dated 7th August 2006 it was held

that the suit would proceed for adjudication as regards relief of
mesne profits.

It was held that offer of DFC to handover

possession was unconditional.
22.

DFC and Union of India challenged the order dated 7th

August 2006 by way of an appeal. The same was registered as
FAO (OS) No.535/06. The appeal was dismissed vide order dated
31st August 2006.
23.

DFC filed a Petition for Special Leave to Appeal before

the Supreme Court laying a challenge to the order dated
31.8.2006. The same was registered as Petition for Special Leave
to Appeal (Civil) No.18722/06.

After notice to the plaintiffs,

Petition for Special Leave to Appeal was dismissed.
24.

Issue which needs to be decided at this stage is

whether the suit has to be disposed of on the existing evidence or
whether DFC has to be granted an opportunity to cross examine
PW-1 and thereafter lead evidence in rebuttal. I may note that
issue pertaining to prayer 'A' has since dissolved as admittedly
possession of the suit premises has been restored to the plaintiffs
on 5.10.2006. Issue pertaining to prayers 'B' and 'C' have to be
decided till the date 5.10.2006.
25.

Whereas plaintiffs urged, and indeed this was the

submission made by Shri P.V.Kapoor, learned senior counsel for

CS(OS) No.1570/1995

Page 7 of 11

the plaintiffs that DFC has stepped into the shoes of Union of India
and therefore would be entitled to participate in the proceedings
from the stage they were when DFC was impleaded as a party.
Learned counsel urged that since DFC was impleaded as a party
pursuant to the order dated 16th July 2004 passed by the Supreme
Court and evidence of the plaintiffs was closed much earlier i.e.
on 11.4.2002, only right available to DFC was to argue the matter.
Counsel further urged that in fact DFC had no right to even argue
the matter inasmuch as the plaintiffs were not claiming any
decree against DFC.
26.

Per contra, Shri Sanjay Poddar, learned counsel who

appeared for Union of India as also DFC urged that consequences
of the order dated 16th July 2004 had to follow and since DFC was
impleaded as a defendant No.2 pursuant to said order, status of
the suit got relegated to the stage of pleadings and therefore
evidence led prior thereto has to be ignored or at least PW-1 be
resummoned for cross examination and right granted to DFC to
lead evidence.
27.

The issue between the parties has to be decided with

reference to the provisions of Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil
Procedure 1908. It reads as under:“Order 1 Rule 10 CPC:
Suit in name of wrong plaintiff – (1) Where a
suit has been instituted in the name of the wrong
person as plaintiff or where it is doubtful whether it
has been instituted in the name of the right
plaintiff, the Court may at any stage of the suit, if
satisfied that the suit has been instituted thought a
CS(OS) No.1570/1995

Page 8 of 11

bona fide mistake, and that it is necessary for the
determination of the real matter in dispute so to do,
order any other person to be substituted or added
as plaintiff upon such terms as the Court thinks
just.
(2)Court may strike out or add parties - The Court
may at any stage of the proceedings, either upon
or without the application of either party, and on
such terms as may appear to the Court to be
just, order that the name of any party
improperly joined, whether as plaintiff or
defendant, be struck out, and that the name, of
any person who ought to have been joined
whether as plaintiff or defendant, or whose
presence before the Court may be necessary in
order to enable the Court effectually and
completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the
questions involved in the suit, be added.
(3)No person shall be added as a plaintiff suing
without a next friend of a plaintiff under any
disability without his consent,
(4)Where defendant added, plaint to be amended –
Where a defendant is added the plaint shall
unless the Court otherwise directs, be amended
in such a manner as may be necessary and
amended copies of the summons and of the
plaint shall be served on the new defendant and,
if the Court thinks fit, on the original defendant.

28.

(5)Subject to the provisions of the Indian Limitation
Act, 1877 915 of 1877) section 22, the
proceedings as against any person added as
defendant shall be deemed to have begun only
on the service of the summons.”
A perusal of sub-rule 4 of Rule 10 of Order 1 CPC

reveals that when a party is impleaded as a defendant the plaint
shall be amended in such a manner as may be necessary and
amended copies of the suit summons and of the plaint shall be
served on the new defendant, unless the Court otherwise directs.
29.

A perusal of sub rule 5 of Rule 10 of Order 1 CPC

shows that where a party is impleaded as a defendant
CS(OS) No.1570/1995

Page 9 of 11

proceedings in the suit shall be deemed to have begun only on
the service of the summons contemplated by sub rule 4 thereof to
be served upon the newly impleaded party.
30.

Consequences of law have to follow. on impleadment

of a party, the proceedings in the suit get reopened and one has
to go back to the stage of completion of pleadings i.e. after
granting an opportunity to the newly impleaded defendant to file
a written statement, issues have to be re-framed, if required,
evidence has to be re-led or at least witnesses who have been
examined have to be recalled for cross examination and newly
impleaded defendant has to be given a right to lead evidence. I
need not note the various authorities which hold that in case of
addition of a plaintiff or a defendant the suit shall be deemed to
have been instituted when such party was added. Those desirous
of looking for precedents may read the AIR Manual (Civil &
Criminal) 6th Edition Volume 5 page 483 where note 50 pertaining
to Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure has made a
catalogue of a few decisions.
31.

In harmony with the mandate of law, while directing

impleadment of DFC as a defendant, vide order dated 16.7.2004
Supreme Court granted a right to DFC to file a written statement.
The said right cannot be converted into a meaningless right by
denying DFC a right to cross examine PW-1 and lead rebuttal
evidence.

CS(OS) No.1570/1995

Page 10 of 11

32.

I accordingly hold that the suit cannot be disposed of

at this stage.

I direct that PW-1 shall be recalled to be cross

examined by DFC.
33.

Since only issue to be decided is mesne profits and

considering that the suit has remained pending for a substantial
number of years I direct the parties i.e. the plaintiffs and DFC, if
they desire, to file documents on which they rely to establish the
market rent of similar properties from the date when the suit was
filed till possession was surrendered. Needful be done within 6
weeks.

Admission/denial would be recorded before the learned

Joint Registrar on 23.7.2007.

Matter would thereafter be listed

before Court for further proceedings.
34.

List before the Joint Registrar on 23.7.2007.
