VIPIN SANGHI, J.
1.

Plaintiff has instituted the above suit under Order 37 of CPC, for

recovery of Rs.24,75,607 with interest thereon. Plaintiff is engaged in
the

business

of

manufacturing

and

sale

of

various

types

of

jersey/polyster, cotton clothes etc. The defendant No.1 M/s. Kalatex is
a partnership firm with defendant No.2, 3 and 4 as partners carrying
CS (OS) No. 1802/2001

Page No.1 of 11

on the business of manufacturing readymade garments.
2.

Defendant No.2 is stated to

be the managing partner of

defendant No.1, who conducted business transactions on behalf of the
defendant firm with the plaintiff.

The defendants ordered and

plaintiffs supplied, from time to time, various types of jersy polyster
cotton

fabrics

to

the

defendants.

These

supplies

were

duly

acknowledged by the defendant firm who received these goods on
credit. Payments were being made from time to time. However, the
defendants did not make the payment for all the supplies and various
cheques issued
outstanding

dues

by the defendants towards payment of the
were

dishonoured

upon

presentation.

The

defendants also acknowledged their liability as on 31.3.98 vide fax
communication dated 22.8.98.
3.

The suit was registered and summons were issued on 5.9.2001

to the defendants to be served in the form prescribed under Order 37
Rule 2(3) CPC. Summons were received at the office of Defendant
No.1 on 22.11.2001.
4.

The defendant No.1 however entered appearance only on

11.12.2001, along with the aforesaid application (being IA No.
11614/2001) seeking condonation of delay in entering appearance.
The defendant firm states that summons were received by one Mr.
Joseph Thomas, who was an ex-employee of the firm on the date on
which summons were served.

CS (OS) No. 1802/2001

He had, on that day, come to the

Page No.2 of 11

defendants office to collect his experience certificate. It is further
averred that since the office of the defendant firm was closed, the post
man who had come to deliver the summons handed the same to Mr.
Joseph Thomas despite his resistance/refusal to accept the same. The
summons so served remained with Mr. Joseph Thomas and were
handed over to the security guard of the firm by him only on 8 th of
December 2001 when he again visited the defendant's premises. The
defendant firm entered appearance on the 11th of December 2001
“under protest” claiming that the summons were not properly served.
In any event, delay of 9 (nine) days is sought to be explained on these
averments

and

condonation

sought.

The

said

application

is

accompanied by the affidavit of Mr Joseph Thomas himself.
5.

The defendant No. 4 has also filed an application for seeking

condonation of delay in filing his appearance, being I.A.No.7624/2003,
inter alia, on the ground that he had no knowledge of the pendency of
the suit, and the order recording that the defendant No.4 was deemed
to be served as defendants 1, 2 and 3 stood served was itself
erroneous as defendant No.1 was never served in accordance with
law, and service on defendants 2 and 3 was deemed to be effected on
the basis of alleged service on defendant No. 1. It is also stated that
the address of defendant no.4 had been wrongly given in the plaint,
and defendant no.3 was dead even before the suit was filed by the
plaintiff. The plaintiff has accepted this position and filed an amended
CS (OS) No. 1802/2001

Page No.3 of 11

memo of parties on record on 19.8.2004. The partnership firm ceased
to exist upon the demise of defendant No.3, and therefore defendant
No.4 could not be deemed to have been served merely because
defendant No.1 firm is assumed (though wrongly) to have been
served. The address of defendant No.4 was deliberately wrongly given
by the plaintiff in his plaint. Thus, if it was held that the defendant
No.1 was not served properly then consequently the deemed service
on other defendants would also be bad and delay ought to be
condoned.
6.

The defendant firm was ordered to produce Mr Joseph Thomas in

court. However, despite several opportunities the defendant failed to
do so. Thereafter, defendant No.2 filed an affidavit expressing his
inability to contact Mr. Joseph Thomas despite all efforts and also filed
IA No. 451/06 for bringing on record the aforesaid affidavit. This
application was also taken up along with the applications under
Section 5 of the Limitation Act, and arguments were advanced by both
sides and orders reserved.
7.

The Ld. Senior Counsel appearing for the defendant applicants

submits that the service of summons was not affected on the
defendant partnership firm as per the provisions of Order 3 Rule 3 and
5 CPC. According to the defendants, the summons ought to have been
accompanied by a notice of the nature referred to in Rule 5. The
burden to prove that the service was effected in the aforesaid manner

CS (OS) No. 1802/2001

Page No.4 of 11

was on the plaintiff, and the plaintiff having failed to adduce any
evidence to that effect, it could not be taken that the defendants had
been served in the suit in the prescribed manner. Consequently, the
time to put in appearance also did not begun to run against the
defendants, and there was no default in putting in appearance by the
defendants.

He relied upon 1994 (28) DRJ 328; AIR 1974 Bom

101; AIR 1975 Rajasthan 121; 84 (2000) DLT 54.
8.

He submits that despite this lapse on part of plaintiff to serve the

Firm in the prescribed manner, the defendant applicants entered
appearance within 3 (three) days of acquiring knowledge of pendency
of the above suit against them. He further averred that Mr.Joseph
Thomas could not be traced despite all possible efforts made by the
defendants and since the affidavit of Mr. Joseph Thomas was already
on record, the court could proceed on the basis of the said affidavit
without

drawing

defendants/applicants.

any

the

He submits that the defendants had acted

bona fide and had come out with true facts and delay of nine days
ought to be condoned in the facts and circumstances of this case. He
submitted that if the intention of the defendant was to refuse service,
or the delay was intentional, the defendant would not have come
rushing to the court on 11.12.2001, when the next date in the suit was
fixed for 28th February, 2002.
9.

The Counsel for the plaintiff however opposes the applications

CS (OS) No. 1802/2001

Page No.5 of 11

filed under Section 5 of the Limitation Act on the ground that IA No.
11614/2001 is not accompanied by a proper affidavit and the affidavit
of Mr. Joseph Thomas cannot be looked into as he is neither a party to
the suit, nor has the defendant produced him despite directions given
by this court. The name of the Security guard was not disclosed in the
application and therefore the affidavit of Mr. Joseph Thomas is vague.
He further submitted that the present suit has been filed under Order
37 CPC which is a complete code in itself and service has been
effected in the the manner provided by Rule 2 of Order 37. He argues
that even otherwise the interpretation being sought to be given to
Rule 5 of Order 30 by the defendant is not tenable in law as it would
only strengthen the hands of the unscrupulous defendants who would
very easily manage to avoid service of summons by taking shelter of
the procedure provided therein.
10.

He also contends that the decision in Shri Rooplal’s case

1994 (28) DRJ 328 is not applicable to the facts of this case since
the defendants had failed to produce Mr. Joseph Thomas and the case
is covered by the decision in Industrial Medical Engineers &Ors vs
Anil Nijhawan &Anr. 110 (2004) DLT 581. He also relies on P. Sen
Engineering P. Ltd. v. Delite Builders P. Ltd. & Ors. AIR 1993
Cal. 28.
11.

The question

that arises for consideration

is whether

a

partnership firm ought to be served in accordance with Rules 3 and 5

CS (OS) No. 1802/2001

Page No.6 of 11

of Order 30, even in a summary suit, and if so, the effect of
noncompliance with said provisions.
Rules 3 and 5 of Order 30 C.P.C read as follows:“R.3. Service- Where persons are sued as
partners in the name of their firm, the summons shall
be served either(a) upon any one or more of the partners, or
(b) at the principal place at which the
partnership business is carried on within India
upon any person having, at the time of
service, the control or management of the
partnership business there,
as the Court may direct; and such service shall be
deemed good service upon the firm so sued,
whether all or any of the partners are within or
without [India]:
Provided that, in the case of a partnership
which has been dissolved to the knowledge of the
plaintiff before the institution of the suit, the
summons shall be served upon every person within
India whom it is sought to make liable.”
5. Proviso: [Service Upon a Dissolved Firm]The word `person' in the proviso does not mean any
person, but any person sought to be made liable as
a partner. Where there has been dissolution to the
knowledge of the plaintiff before suit, no outgoing
partner can be made liable unless the summons is
served upon him. So also in a decree against a firm
(on the death of a partner) the personal estate of
the deceased partner cannot be made liable unless
the legal representative of the deceased partner is
joined [Mathuradas v. Ebrahim, A. 1927 B 581: 51 B
986]. It is not incumbent upon the applicant to have
served the legal representatives of the deceased
partner [Subhash Oil Company v. Balwant Rai Tayal,
(2001)(2) Punj LR 82(85) ( P&H).
Or 21 r 50(2) is controlled by the proviso to this rule
CS (OS) No. 1802/2001

Page No.7 of 11

where the dissolution was to the knowledge of the
plaintiff. If the plaintiff had knowledge of the
dissolution at the time of the suit, the decree binds
all the partners whether they have served
individually or not [Gordhandas v. Gautam, A 1925 B
331; see Wigram v. Cox & Co, 1894, 1QB 792].
Where plaintiff has notice of dissolution, a decree
obtained after service on one partner only is a good
decree against the firm. The only effect is that it
could not be executed individually against the
partners not served, nor could plaintiff get leave
under Or 21 r 50(2) [Satya v. C H E Co, 42 CWN
820].
12.

The judgments of various High Courts, cited by the defendant

including a decision of Satpal J. of this very High Court have dealt with
this aspect in detail.

The Bombay, Rajasthan and Delhi High Court

have, in the judgments cited by the defendant held that service of
summons on a partnership firm must be effected strictly in accordance
with Rules 3 and 5 of Order 30 C.P.C. As per Rule 3 summons may
either be served on a partner, or if not on a partner then on a person
having control and management of the firm at the time of service.
When summons are sought to be served on the firm in the manner
prescribed by clause (b) to Rule 3, i.e., on a person in control of
business, the requisite notice under Order 30 Rule 5 must accompany
the writ of summons. The Bombay High Court also laid down in the
above case the proposition that the special provisions in regard to
service of summons on a firm against which a suit is filed in the firms
name contained in Order 30 of CPC must prevail over the general
provisions of the code in regard to service by registered post or latter,

CS (OS) No. 1802/2001

Page No.8 of 11

must be read so as to harmonise with those special provisions. There
is no reason to accept the contention that the provisions of Order 30
Rule 3 and 5 would not apply to service of summons issued in a
summary suit under Order 37 CPC. Order 37 in fact imposes additional
conditions for service of summons in a summary suit by prescribing
that the summons have to be issued in a particular form (Form No.4 in
Appendix B) and that the summons should be accompanied with a
copy of the plaint and annexures thereto (Rule 3(1) of Order 37 CPC).
13.

Order 37 CPC does not draw any distinction with regard to

service of summons. In fact, I would think that the service of summons
in a summary suit under Order 37 CPC deserves greater and stricker
compliance of the regours of the law, since Order 37 fixes a tight time
schedule for entering of appearance by the defendant, and can result
in drastic consequences for the defendant if he fails to put in timely
appearance. If service is effected sans the notice of the nature
specified by Rule 5 of Order 30, the service is not effective.

the

endorsement 'refused' on the AD card, of the summons sent by
registered AD post, to the principal place of business of the defendant
firm. The said decision, as pointed out by the counsel for the
defendant and rightly so, was made without taking into consideration
the provisions of Order 30 Rule 3 and 5 and the decision is therefore

CS (OS) No. 1802/2001

Page No.9 of 11

not germane to the present controversy.
15.

The decision in P. Sen (Engneering) (Supra) can at the most

be treated as an authority on the interpretation of Rule 3 of Order 30.
The said case only lays down that the summons though required to be
served 'upon' the partners are not compulsorily required to be served
“personally” on them. Summons may be served upon any person
expressly or impliedly authorised to receive summons or letters on
behalf of the partner or at the principle place of business.
16.

It is not the plaintiffs case that while effecting service the

aforesaid procedure was of Rule 5 of Order 30 CPC complied with. It is
also not the plaintiffs case that the summons in the name of the
defendant firm were served upon a partner or that Mr. Joseph Thomas
was a partner of the defendant firm. There is nothing to show that Mr.
Joseph Thomas was in control or management of the business of the
defendant firm. I see no force in the contention of the plaintiff that
the application for seeking condonation of delay be rejected since it is
not supported by an affidavit of the defendants, and is purportedly
supported by an affidavit of Mr.Joseph Thomas. Firstly, the relevant
facts pleaded in the said application are those attributed to Mr. Joseph
Thomas. Secondly, the defendant No.2 has filed his affidavit dated
12.1.2006 on record with IA No. 451/2006, which removes the
technical deficiency, if any.
17.

In view thereof, this question must be answered in favour of the

CS (OS) No. 1802/2001

Page No.10 of 11

defendant and the service of summons on the defendants cannot be
deemed to be effective. In any event, the delay of 9 days is of little
consequence and the same is condoned since, the defendants have
disclosed sufficient cause for the delay in filing their memo of
appearance. The conduct of the defendants appears to be bona fide
since they put in appearance, under protest, much before the
returnable in the summons. It is trite law that parties must litigate on
merits and mere technicalities should not hamper administration of
justice. The I.A's preferred by defendants are therefore allowed.
