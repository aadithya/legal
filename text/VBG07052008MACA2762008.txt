V.B.Gupta, J.
The present appeal under Section 173 of Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short as „Act‟) has been filed against
the order dated 08.01.08, passed by Sh. V.K. Maheshwari,
Judge, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (for short as
“Tribunal”), New Delhi.
2.

In a nutshell, the facts relevant for the purpose of

dealing with this appeal are that on 27.10.04 deceased, Sh.
Anjani Jha as a pillion rider along with his friend namely,
Rinku was coming from Delhi Cantt to R.K. Puram after
finishing his work on a two wheeler scooter bearing no.
DNN-6079 which was driven by deceased‟s friend and he
was sitting as a pillion rider. When they reached at Red
Light of Sector 1 of R.K. Puram near Sangam Cinema, at
that time a Toyata Qualis bearing no. DL-4C-R-2764 driven
by its driver, respondent No.4 came from the side of Hyatt
Hotel, in rash and negligent manner and hit their scooter.

As a result thereof, the deceased and his friend fell down
and sustained fatal injuries. Deceased was taken to
Safdarjung Hospital, where he was declared as brought
dead.
3.

A petition seeking compensation was filed by the legal

heirs of the deceased against the appellant herein and
respondent no. 4 herein.
4.

Vide impugned judgment, the Ld. Tribunal passed an

award for a sum of Rs.7,22,400/- along with interest @ 7%
per annum from the date of filing of the petition till
realization in favour of respondents no. 1 to 3 herein.
5.

It has been contended by Ld. Counsel for the

Appellant that in absence of any proof of income or earning
of the

deceased,

the

Tribunal erred in

taking into

consideration the minimum wages prevailing in the year
2007 of unskilled labourer for the purpose of calculating
the average earning of the deceased at Rs.3,182/- per
month when in the year of accident, the minimum wages of
unskilled labourer

was Rs.2,894/-

p.m. It is

further

submitted that the Tribunal has proceeded with the wrong
assumption that since the deceased was 38 years old at the

MAC Appl.No.276/2008

Page 3 of 8

time of accidental death, he had to live about 32 years
more as the normal span of life in this part of the country is
70 years, as the Tribunal failed to take into consideration
the uncertainty of one‟s life. The deceased was 38 years
old, therefore, the multiplier of 12 should be adopted. The
future increase in earning has wrongly been taken into
consideration, when there is no evidence to this effect.
6.

Ld. Counsel for the appellant has also relied upon

Bijoy Kumar Dugar v. Bidya Dhar Dutta and Others,
(2006) 3 Supreme Court Cases 242 and The Managing
Director, TNSTC v. Sripriya & Ors., 2007 (4) Scale 22
in support of its contentions.
7.

In Bijoy Kumar Dugar (Supra) the Apex Court has

observed;
“It is by now well-settled that the
compensation should be the pecuniary loss to
the dependants by the death of a person
concerned.
While
calculating
the
compensation, annual dependency of the
dependants should be determined in terms of
the annual loss, according to them, due to the
abrupt termination of life. To determine the
quantum of compensation, the earnings of the
deceased at the time of the accident and the
amount, which the deceased was spending for
the dependants, are the basic determinative
factors. The resultant figure should then be
multiplied by a `multiplier'. The multiplier is

MAC Appl.No.276/2008

Page 4 of 8

applied not for the entire span of life of a
person, but it is applied taking into
consideration the imponderables in life,
immediate availability of the amount to the
dependants, the expectancy of the period of
dependency of the claimants and so many
other factors. Contribution towards the
expenses of the family naturally is in
proportion to one's earning capacity.”
8.

In Smt. Sarla Dixit and Anr. v. Balwant Yadav &

Ors., AIR 1996 SC 1272, the Apex Court has observed;
“So far as the adoption of the proper
multiplier is concerned, it was observed that
the future prospects of advancement in life
and career should also be sounded in terms
of money to augment the multiplicand.
While the chance of the multiplier is
determined by two factors, namely, the rate
of interest appropriate to a stable economy
and the age of the deceased or of the
claimant
whichever
is
higher,
the
ascertainment of the multiplicand is a more
difficult exercise. The average gross future
monthly income could be arrived at by
adding the actual gross income at the time
of death to the maximum which he would
have otherwise got had he not died a
premature death and dividing that figure by
two. Thus the average gross monthly income
spread over his entire future career, had it
been available, would have been the gross
monthly average income available to the
family of the deceased had he survived as a
bread winner.”

MAC Appl.No.276/2008

9.

In the present case, no documentary evidence with

regard to earnings of deceased has been placed on the file;
therefore, the Tribunal is adopting the minimum wages of
an unskilled labourer to assess the earnings of the
deceased.
10.

Once the income of the deceased is determined under

the Minimum Wages Act, then increase in the Minimum
Wages can also be taken into consideration as the
minimum wages are revised by the Government every year
so as to meet the increase in the price index, inflationary
trends and other economic factors.
11.

After taking judicial facts and circumstances, the Ld.

Tribunal has taken into consideration future advancement
prospects

of

deceased

while

assessing

the

loss

of

dependency and held;
“This accident had taken place on
21.10.04. Age of deceased was 38 years at
the time of this accident. This Court is
deciding this case in the year 2008.
Deceased had to live about 70 years
according to the normal span of life, thus
he had to live about 28 years more from
now onwards had he not died in this
accident. Minimum wages of a unskilled
labourer, in the year 2004 were Rs.2,894/pm, when this accident had taken place.
Minimum Wages of unskilled labourer in

MAC Appl.No.276/2008

Page 6 of 8

the year 2007 are Rs. 3470/- when this
Court is deciding this petition. Thus
average earning of deceased are being
assessed at Rs.2,894+3,470=Rs.6,364 / 2=
Rs.3,182 per month. As deceased has to
live about 28 years more from today
onwards had he not died in this accident,
hence after taking in consideration
chances of advancement of his future
prospects his average earnings will be
Rs.3,182/- + Rs.6,364= Rs.9,546 / 2 = Rs.
4,773/- per month for assessing loss of
dependency to petitioners.”
12.

The minimum wage, in the very context of economy

has a correlation with the growth and development of the
nation's economy, postulating increase in the price index,
reduction of purchasing power with the denunciation of
currency value and consequent fixation of minimum wages
giving some periodical increase so as to ensure sustenance
and survival of the workman class. Keeping this in view,
under no circumstance the revision of minimum wages can
be treated on the same footing with the factor of future
prospects.
13.

As regards the contention of multiplier, deceased

was 38 years of age at the time of his death. Multiplier for
the age group of a person between 35 years to 40 years as
per schedule II of the Act is 16. The same has been adopted

MAC Appl.No.276/2008

Page 7 of 8

by the learned Tribunal, which in my opinion is correct and
do not warrant any interference. Thus, the decision cited
by Ld. Counsel for the Appellant is not applicable to the
facts of the present case.
14.

Thus, no fault can be found with the reasoning given

by the learned Tribunal. The compensation awarded by the
learned Tribunal is just and reasonable and no ground is
made out for interference with the award passed by the
learned Tribunal.
15.

With the result, present appeal stands dismissed.

16.

Copy of the judgment be sent to the trial court.
