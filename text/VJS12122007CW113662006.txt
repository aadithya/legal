1.

JUDGMENT
The facts in this Petition are that the Petitioner

was enrolled in the Indian Army on 11.1.2002.

He

completed his Training on 22nd October 2002 and was
posted at 5, Rajputana Rifles as a Recruit.
2005 he was served

with a Chargesheet

In May
dated

21.5.2005 alongwith a copy of the Summary of
WP(C) No.11366/2006

Page 1 of 7

Evidence so that he would prepare his defence as
envisaged in Army Rules 33 and 34 of the Army Rules,
1954. The Petitioner was further informed that he
would be tried by a Summary Court Martial (SCM) on
25.5.2005. The Petitioner was dismissed by the SCM
and his subsequent Appeal was also unsuccessful. The
Charge against the Petitioner reads as follows:
Army Act

MAKING

AT

Section
44

ENROLMENT

THE
A

TIME

WILFULLY

OF
FALSE

ANSWER TO A QUESTION SET FORTH
IN

THE

PRESCRIBED

FORM

OF

ENROLMENT WHICH WAS PUT TO HIM
BY THE ENROLLING OFFICER BEFORE
WHOM

HE

APEPARED

FOR

THE

PURPOSE OF BEING ENROLLED
In that he,
at BRO Jhunjhunu on 04 Oct 2001, when
appeared

before

Colonel

U

Sachdev,

an

enrolling officer, for the purpose of being
enrolled

for

service

in

the

'RAJPUTANA

RIFLES REGIMENT' to a question put to him,
“Have you ever been imprisoned by the Civil
Power or are you under trial for an offence or
has any complaint or report been made
against you to the magistrate or Police for any
offence? If so give details”? answered 'No'
WP(C) No.11366/2006

Page 2 of 7

well knowing it be false since a case was
pending against him at Police Station Sri
Madhopur

bearing

No222/97

under

IPC

Section 147, 148, 149, 323, 325, 447 and 326
respectively.

2.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner states that

when the Petitioner was fifteen years of age he was
mentioned in an FIR and had to face prosecution.

3.

The District Magistrate, Sikar, vide his letter

dated 25.11.2002, informed the Respondents that a
case for offences under IPC Nos. 147, 148, 149, 323,
325, 447, 326, 222/97 against the Petitioner was
pending in the Civil Court since 30.6.1998.

The

important fact is that at the time when the Attestation
Form was filled-up the Petitioner was over eighteen
years of age, and most importantly, the criminal
proceedings were still pending.

It is, therefore,

irrelevant that the Petitioner was allegedly fifteen
years of age when the prosecution commenced.
Knowingly, the Petitioner has incorrectly responded to

WP(C) No.11366/2006

Page 3 of 7

the queries in the Attestation Form.

4.

The prosecution ended with an Order dated

24.1.2005 which reads as follows:
Accused minor Sultan with guardian
present. The Gist of charge under IPC 147,
148, 149, 447, 323, 325, 326 was verbally
told to the accused minor Sultan and he
confirmed the accusation for which he filed
an application.
After confirmation of the accusation,
prosecution was closed. Argument heard.
Application was considered. After proving the
charge under IPC 147, 148, 149, 447, 323,
325, 326 against accused minor Sultan he
was sent with guardian for counseling and
under Juvenile Act 2000 Act 15 (1) (d) he was
handed over to his guardian after warning.
His guardian was fined Rs.5000/- u/s 15 (1)
(d) of Juveniles Act. The presence and arrest
warrant of minor Sultan were cancelled.
It is directed that there will be no
adverse effect of the offence on Government
service of the minor.
As per order the guardian of minor
Sultan deposited Rs.5000/- and it is seen to
that to that effect receipt no.43049/32 has
WP(C) No.11366/2006

Page 4 of 7

been given.
There is no action left in this case and
the case is confined to the record.

5.

In Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan -vs- Ram Ratan

Yadav, 2003(3) SCC 437 in the Attestation Form the
employee had stated that he had not been prosecuted
or convicted by any Court of any offence and that no
case was pending against him in any Court at the time
of the filling of the Attestation Form. Since these were
found to be incorrect, he was dismissed from service
and this action was upheld by the Supreme Court.

6.

A similar view was taken by the Supreme Court

in Ram Saran -vs- IG of Police, CRPF, (2006) 2 SCC
541 where the petitioner concealed his correct birth
date and it was held thatThis is a case which does not deserve any
leniency otherwise it would be giving premium
to a person who admittedly committed forgery.

WP(C) No.11366/2006

Page 5 of 7

In the instruction (GO No.29 of 1993), it has
been provided that whenever it is found that a
government servant who was not qualified or
eligible in terms of the recruitment rules, etc.
for

initial

recruitment

in

service

or

had

furnished false information or produced a false
certificate in order to secure appointment
should not be retained in service.

7.

An almost identical question had arisen before a

Division Bench of this Court in Yogesh Kumar Singh v.
Union of India, WP(C) No. 11460/2004, decided on 19th
October, 2006. Our learned brothers had dismissed the
Petition in view of the settled law.

We are in

respectful agreement with that Judgment. Where a
Verification Roll has been wrongly filled up, despite
the caution contained at its very threshold, it would be
inappropriate for the Writ Court to exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction.

8.

It is altogether another matter that had the

Petitioner

honestly

and

candidly

mentioned

the

prosecution it may not have been held against him as

WP(C) No.11366/2006

Page 6 of 7

he was a juvenile at the relevant time. In fact, the
Order dated 24.1.2005 itself mentions that there will
be no adverse effect of the offence on the government
service of the accused. We must, however, draw the
distinction that the Petitioner's service had been
terminated not because of his involvement in a
criminal prosecution but because of his incorrect
answers to the questions contained in the Attestation
Form.

9.

Writ Petition is without merit and is dismissed.
