MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
This case exposes us to another unfortunate aspect of the
underbelly of litigation in India – one where both litigating parties go
hammer and tongs at each other with neither side willing to give any
quarter. This may be understandable where the litigating parties are
individuals or corporations seeking a slice of the cake. But where one of
the parties is the State, it is a little difficult to appreciate why a litigation
should be fought tooth and nail, particularly when a Constitutional
Court has repeatedly taken a view that is not only unfavourable to it, but
has resulted in observations suggesting that the State is trying to
overreach the process of the Court. There is also a severe indictment of
a functionary of the State, by this Court, of interpolations and
manipulations in an official order. This is perhaps what makes the stage
show enacted by the State in this litigation a little distasteful and
unpalatable if not sordid and tragic.

2.

To make matter worse, if we were to include the initiation of

contempt proceedings, this is the fifth time that the Petitioner has had to
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 2 of 54

approach this Court for relief that was due to it as far back as in April,
2003 – such is the irony of this litigation, which has twice reached the
Supreme Court already.

3.

Add to this the fact that when we requested learned counsel

for the parties to let us know the expenses incurred by their clients so
that meaningful costs could be awarded to the successful party, as laid
down by the Supreme Court, we were shocked to learn that this
litigation alone (not to mention the earlier forays in this Court or the
Supreme Court) has cost the parties almost half a crore of rupees – so
much for access to inexpensive and affordable justice!

4.

With this preface, it is necessary to consider the challenge

mounted by the Petitioner which is to:
(a) An order dated 19th April, 2007 issued by the
Commissioner, Value Added Tax. By this order, the
jurisdiction in respect of the Petitioner for the assessment
year 2000-2001 onwards under the Delhi Sales Tax on
Works Contract Act, 1999 (the Works Contract Act) and the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 was transferred to the Deputy
Commissioner (Special Zone).
(b) Another order dated 19th April, 2007 issued by the
Commissioner, Value Added Tax. Essentially, this order
delegates revisionary powers under Section 46 of the Delhi
Sales Tax Act, 1975 (the DST Act) to the Deputy
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 3 of 54

Commissioner (Special Zone). It may be noted that the DST
Act was repealed on 31st March, 2005.
(c) A notice dated 18th July, 2007 issued by the Deputy
Commissioner (Special Zone) of the Government of NCT of
Delhi, Department of Trade and Taxes. By this notice, the
Deputy Commissioner (Special Zone) seeks to exercise his
(delegated) revisionary jurisdiction to call for and examine
the record/proceedings pertaining to the assessment of the
Petitioner under the Works Contract Act and the DST Act.

The initial facts:
5.

On 31st March, 2003, an assessment order was passed by the

Tax Assessment Officer in respect of the Petitioner for the assessment
year 2001-2002. By virtue of this order, the Assessing Officer granted a
refund of Rs.6,30,79,487/- to the Petitioner which was then to be made
over to the Petitioner on an application filed by it. The assessment order
was accepted by the Revenue and was not sought to be immediately
revised or otherwise set aside. It may be mentioned, en passant, that the
assessment order was rectified on 9th June, 2003 but that is admittedly of
no real significance or import.

6.

Consequent upon the assessment order, the Petitioner

preferred an application on 2nd May, 2003 for refund of the amount due
to it under Section 30(1) of the DST Act. Unfortunately, the Assessing

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 4 of 54

Officer, instead of granting the refund, went on to consider the merits of
the assessment order as if he were sitting in appeal over the assessment
made.

7.

Eventually, the Assessing Officer passed an order dated 14th

August, 2003 whereby he rejected the refund application. But what is
worse, he made interpolations and manipulations in the order dated 14th
August, 2003. The Assessing Officer also did not communicate the
order dated 14th August, 2003 to the Petitioner. Instead, on 4th
September, 2003 a notice was issued to the Petitioner seeking to reopen
the assessment in respect of the assessment year 2001-2002.

The

reassessment proceedings continued and culminated in an order of
reassessment dated 15th January, 2004.
The first writ petition:
8.

Feeling aggrieved by the rejection of its refund application

preferred under Section 30(1) of the DST Act (by the order dated 14th
August, 2003) as well as the order of reassessment dated 15th January,
2004, the Petitioner filed in this Court WP (C) No.869 of 2004 (the first
writ petition). In that writ petition, which was decided on 28th July,
2004 the following conclusions were arrived at by the Division Bench:

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 5 of 54

(1) The order dated 14th August, 2003 passed by the
Assessing Officer was the following:“Dealer is asked to file the present addresses of
sub-contractor and sales tax wards, tax deposited
figures of each. But he refused to sign and left
office. Application is not kept in abeyance and is
rejected.”
(2) The underlined words, that is, „not‟ and „and is rejected‟
were interpolated by the Assessing Officer and so the order
rejecting the refund application deserved to be quashed.
(3) A refund could be withheld only under the conditions
mentioned in Section 30(6) of the DST Act. These conditions
are: (a) the assessment order is the subject matter of an
appeal or further proceedings or where any other proceeding
is pending under the DST Act, and (b) the Commissioner is
of the opinion that the grant of refund is likely to adversely
affect the Revenue.
(4) In the present case, no such proceedings were pending
and so the refund could not be withheld. “Therefore it goes
without saying that it is very clear that an application for
refund ought to have been allowed under Section 30.”
(Emphasis given)
(5) The order rejecting the refund was quashed and the
reassessment order was also quashed.
(6) The Commissioner was directed to pass appropriate
orders on the refund application keeping in view the mandate
of Section 30 of the DST Act within a period of 15 days.

9.

Instead of complying with the mandamus issued by this

Court, the Commissioner passed an order on 12th August, 2004 (on the
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 6 of 54

extended date) on the application for refund and came to the prima facie
conclusion that the assessment order dated 31st March, 2003 was
erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the Revenue. Therefore, he
concluded that before granting the refund, the assessment order dated
31st March, 2003 is required to be revised under Section 16 of the
Works Contract Act read with Section 46 of the DST Act.
Consequently, the Commissioner directed the concerned Assistant
Commissioner [who was delegated powers of the Commissioner under
Section 46 of the DST Act by an order dated 12th September, 1994] to
revise the assessment order. It was further directed that only thereafter
should the Zonal Assistant Commissioner take up the question of refund
due to the Petitioner.

10.

Section 46 of the DST Act is of some importance and this

reads as follows:
“46. Revision of orders prejudicial to revenue: The
Commissioner may call for and examine the record of any
proceeding under this Act and if he considers that any order
passed therein by any person appointed under sub-section (2)
of section 9 to assist him, is erroneous in so far as it is
prejudicial to the interests of revenue, he may, after giving
the dealer an opportunity of being heard and after making or
causing to be made such inquiry as he deems necessary, pass
such order thereon as the circumstances of the case justify,
including an order enhancing or modifying the assessment
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 7 of 54

and penalty (if any) imposed or cancelling the assessment
and penalty (if any) imposed and directing a fresh
assessment.
Provided that a final order under this section shall be made
before the expiry of five years from the date of the order
sought to be revised.”

11.

Feeling aggrieved by the failure of the Commissioner to

comply with the mandamus issued by this Court in the matter of refund,
and instead, attempting to revise the assessment order dated 31 st March,
2003 the Petitioner filed a miscellaneous application in the first writ
petition seeking appropriate orders from this Court.

12.

On 20th September, 2004 an order came to be passed on the

miscellaneous application directing the Revenue to deposit the entire
refundable amount with interest, in the Registry of this Court, within
one week. The order dated 12th August, 2004 passed by the
Commissioner was also stayed by this Court and this interim stay
continued until the miscellaneous application was decided on 18th
November, 2005 when it was held that it would be appropriate for the
Petitioner to initiate separate substantive proceedings challenging the
order dated 12th August, 2004 instead of through a miscellaneous

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 8 of 54

application.

13.

In the meanwhile, on 31st March, 2005 both the Works

Contract Act as well as the DST Act were repealed and on 1st April,
2005 the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004 (the DVAT Act) was
brought into force.

14.

There are two significant aspects of the DVAT Act that we

are concerned with. Firstly, the provision for repeal and savings, which
is Section 106 of the DVAT Act and this reads as follows:
“106. Repeal and savings
(1) The Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975 (43 of 1975), the Delhi
Tax on Entry of Motor Vehicles into Local Areas Act, 1994
(4 of 1995), the Delhi Sales Tax on Works Contract Act,
1999 (9 of 1999), and the Delhi Sales Tax on Right to Use
Goods Act, 2002 (13 of 2002) as in force in Delhi (referred
to in this section as the “said Acts”), are hereby repealed.
(2) Notwithstanding sub-section (1) of this section, such
repeal shall not affect the previous operation of the said
Acts or any right, title, entitlement, obligation or liability
already acquired, accrued or incurred thereunder.
(3) For the purposes of sub-section (2) of this section,
anything done or any action taken including any
appointment, notification, notice, order, rule, form or
certificate in the exercise of any powers conferred by or
under the said Acts shall be deemed to have been done or
taken in the exercise of the powers conferred by or under
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 9 of 54

this Act, as if this Act were in force on the date on which
such thing was done or action was taken, and all arrears of
tax and other amounts due at the commencement of this Act
may be recovered as if they had accrued under this Act.”

15.

Secondly (and this is important in so far as the Petitioner is

concerned) no power of revision was conferred upon the Commissioner
of Value Added Tax under the DVAT Act. The revisionary power,
which earlier existed under the DST Act, was not saved under the
DVAT Act. It came into existence under the DVAT Act only by an
amendment brought into force with effect from 16th November, 2005 by
the inclusion of Section 74A in the DVAT Act. In other words, the
power of revision conferred upon the Commissioner under the DST Act
was omitted under the DVAT Act and conferred on the Commissioner
only on 16th November, 2005.

16.

Given this factual background, it is necessary at this stage to

pause and take stock of the facts as they existed on 1 st April, 2005 when
the DVAT Act came into force. The important facts are:
1. The Works Contract Act and the DST Act were repealed
by the DVAT Act. Section 106 of the DVAT Act dealt
with repeal and savings.
2. Under the DVAT Act, on 1st April, 2005 the
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 10 of 54

Commissioner of Value Added Tax did not have the
power to revise an assessment order which was erroneous
or prejudicial to the interest of the Revenue. [Such a
power was conferred on him much later only on 16th
November, 2005].
3. The power of revision earlier available with the
Commissioner under the DST Act was omitted under the
DVAT Act.
4. An order dated 12th September, 1994 issued by the
Commissioner was in existence delegating powers of
revision under Section 46 of the DST Act to the Assistant
Commissioner.
5. The order dated 12th August, 2004 passed by the
Commissioner was in existence. By this order, the
Assistant Commissioner was asked to revise the
assessment order dated 31st March, 2003 and thereafter
take up the application filed by the Petitioner for refund.
6. No proceeding was initiated or pending in respect of the
Petitioner on 1st April, 2005 pursuant to the order dated
12th August, 2004.
7. The Petitioner had filed a miscellaneous application in the
first writ petition (decided on 28 th July, 2004) in which an
order was passed by this Court on 20th September, 2004
staying the operation of the order dated 12th August, 2004.

The contempt petition:
17.

It appears that in view of the recalcitrant attitude (but despite

the pendency of the miscellaneous application in the first writ petition)
the Petitioner filed a civil contempt petition in this Court on 11th May,

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 11 of 54

2005 against the Commissioner of Value Added Tax (earlier the
Commissioner of Sales Tax) being CCP No.381 of 2005. The grievance
of the Petitioner was that not only was the refund denied to it in spite of
a mandamus of this Court but the order dated 12th August, 2004 was an
attempt to overreach the orders passed by this Court in the first writ
petition decided on 20th July, 2004.

18.

The civil contempt petition came to be heard by a Division

Bench of this Court and by an order dated 18 th November, 2005 the
learned Judges expressed different opinions. One of the learned Judges
(T.S. Thakur, J) was of the view that the contempt petition merited
dismissal and that the amount deposited by the Revenue pursuant to the
orders of this Court passed on 20th September, 2004 shall stand refunded
to the Revenue. The other learned Judge (Badar Durrez Ahmed, J) was
of the opinion that the Commissioner had committed contempt of Court
by showing complete and thorough disrespect to the orders passed by
this Court and had deliberately and intentionally and by a device
thwarted the opinion of this Court dated 20 th July, 2004. However, the
learned Judge was of the view that since contempt proceedings involve
penal consequences and T.S. Thakur, J did not find the Commissioner in

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 12 of 54

contempt, it would be appropriate to give him the benefit of doubt and
not haul him up for contempt of Court. Accordingly, the contempt
petition was dismissed.

The second and third writ petitions:
19.

On 16th January, 2006, an office order was issued by which

the Commissioner transferred the jurisdiction concerning the assessment
of the Petitioner to the Special Zone in respect of all proceedings,
whether commenced, pending or to be initiated.

20.

Pursuant thereto, the Joint Commissioner, Special Zone

issued a notice dated 21st February, 2006 to the Petitioner in exercise of
powers delegated to him under Section 46 of the DST Act. It was stated
in the notice that the assessment order dated 31 st March, 2003 was
erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the Revenue and therefore
the Petitioner may show cause why the assessment order be not revised.
Although no reference was made to the order dated 12 th August, 2004 it
is quite clear that the notice was pursuant to that order passed by the
Commissioner of Sales Tax.

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 13 of 54

21.

A few days earlier, on or about 17th February, 2006, the

Petitioner had filed WP (C) No.2355 of 2006 (the second writ petition)
in this Court in which it was prayed that the order dated 12 th August,
2004 passed by the Commissioner of Sales Tax be quashed. The writ
petition was heard for admission by a Division Bench of this Court on
20th February, 2006 and judgment reserved. Judgment was eventually
delivered by the Division Bench on 15th September, 2006 when again
there was a difference of opinion between the learned Judges
constituting the Division Bench (T.S. Thakur and B.N. Chaturvedi, JJ) –
but more on that a little later.

22.

The Petitioner filed a reply to the show cause notice dated

21st February, 2006 and soon thereafter in April, 2006 filed WP (C)
5272 of 2006 (the third writ petition) in this Court challenging that show
cause notice. It was contended in the third writ petition, inter alia, that
the show cause notice is without jurisdiction since it was issued in
exercise of powers conferred by the Works Contract Act and the DST
Act both of which statutes had been repealed, the revisionary power
vested in the Commissioner under the DST Act was not saved or
preserved and that no revisionary power was conferred on the

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 14 of 54

Commissioner under the DVAT Act until 16th November, 2005 when
Section 74A was inserted in that statute.

23.

The third writ petition challenging the show cause notice

dated 21st February, 2006 was heard for admission on 3rd April, 2006
when orders were reserved. However, it was directed on that date that
the revision proceedings may go on before the appropriate authority but
no final order shall be passed thereon and that the Petitioner should
cooperate with the proceedings.

24.

As mentioned above, the second writ petition which was

argued for admission on 20th February, 2006, was decided by a Division
Bench of this Court on 15th September, 2006. T.S. Thakur, J upheld the
validity of the notice dated 12 th August, 2004 whereby the refund
application of the Petitioner was rejected by the Commissioner and a
direction was given to the Zonal Assistant Commissioner to revise the
assessment order dated 31st March, 2003 and thereafter decide the
refund application of the Petitioner. On the other hand, B.N. Chaturvedi,
J concluded that the order dated 12 th August, 2004 deserved to be
quashed, which he did. It was directed by the learned Judge that the

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 15 of 54

Revenue should pass appropriate orders on the refund application filed
by the Petitioner in conformity with the orders dated 20th July, 2004
passed by this Court in the first writ petition. Liberty was granted to the
Revenue to pass appropriate orders in regard to revision of the
assessment order, in accordance with law, but not before disposing of
the refund claim.

25.

In view of the difference of opinion between the learned

Judges in the second writ petition, the matter was referred to a third
learned Judge (Mukul Mudgal, J) who passed an order on 18th October,
2006 concurring with the view taken by B.N. Chaturvedi, J quashing the
order dated 12th August, 2004. It was held that the Revenue should first
comply with the mandamus dated 20th July, 2004 directing refund to the
Petitioner.

26.

After the third learned Judge rendered his opinion, the

second writ petition was placed before the Division Bench on 3 rd
November, 2006 for passing consequential orders. On that date, the
Division Bench allowed the writ petition and quashed the order dated
12th August, 2004. The Commissioner was directed to pass appropriate

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 16 of 54

orders on the refund application in conformity with the orders of this
Court dated 20th July, 2004 in the first writ petition. The Revenue was
also given liberty to pass appropriate orders, in accordance with law, in
regard to the assessment order but only after disposing of the refund
application.

27.

The Revenue preferred Special Leave Petition (C) No.20786

of 2006 against the final order dated 3 rd November, 2006 in the second
writ petition, but the SLP was dismissed by an order dated 4th January,
2007 with the Supreme Court observing that:
“On the facts of the case, we are not inclined to interfere
keeping the question of law open. The special leave petition
is dismissed.”

28.

Therefore, the factual position as it stood on 4 th January,

2007 when the Supreme Court dismissed the SLP of the Revenue was as
follows:
1. The Petitioner was entitled to a refund on the basis of the
assessment order dated 31st March, 2003. This was
conclusively held by two Division Benches of this Court,
both in the first writ petition (decided on 20th July, 2004)
as well as in the second writ petition (decided on 3rd
November, 2006).
2. An SLP against the decision rendered by this Court in the
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 17 of 54

second writ petition was dismissed on 4th January, 2007.
3. The order passed on 12th August, 2004 to initiate
reassessment proceedings against the Petitioner stood
quashed in the second writ petition.
4. While the order dated 12th August, 2004 was quashed in
the second writ petition, liberty was given to the
Respondents to pass appropriate orders in respect of the
assessment order dated 31st March, 2003 in accordance
with law.
5. The Works Contract Act and the DST Act were repealed
with effect from 31st March, 2005 and the DVAT Act was
brought into force on 1st April, 2005.
6. The DVAT Act did not confer any power of revision on
the Commissioner of DVAT till 16th November, 2005
when Section 74A was inserted in the DVAT Act.
7. The third writ petition challenging the show cause notice
dated 21st February, 2006 issued by the Joint
Commissioner, Special Zone on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction was heard for admission on 3 rd April, 2006
and judgment reserved. The Joint Commissioner was
permitted to go ahead with the proceedings but was
restrained from passing a final order thereon.

The fourth writ petition:
29.

After finality was given to all the pending proceedings (other

than the third writ petition in which judgment was still awaited), the
refund due to the Petitioner was granted to it by an order dated 8 th
January, 2007 passed by the Commissioner (T&T). However, in the

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 18 of 54

order dated 8th January, 2007 the Commissioner stated in paragraph 10
thereof as follows:
“This order would, however be without prejudice to the
rights and powers of the competent authority for suo-moto
revision under Section 46 of the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975
read with section 16 of Delhi Sales Tax on Works Contract
Act, 1999 which have already been initiated by the
competent authority keeping in view the serious
discrepancies observed in the assessment order dated
31.3.2003, passed by the assessing authority.”

30.

Pursuant to the order dated 8th January, 2007 two events

occurred. Firstly, the Commissioner issued two orders on 19 th April,
2007 both of which are impugned in the writ petition that we are
presently concerned with. The first Order No. 29 reads as follows:

“OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER,
VALUE ADDED TAX

Trade & Taxes, in exercise of the powers conferred by
section 10 of the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975 read with section

106 of DVAT Act, 2004, do hereby delegate powers vested

This order shall come into force with immediate effect.

The other Order No. 34 reads as follows:

31.

The second event that occurred was that a notice dated 7th

February, 2007 was served upon the Petitioner requiring it to appear
before the Deputy Commissioner (Special Zone) on 19 th February, 2007
along with all relevant records and to show cause why the assessment
order dated 31st March, 2003 be not revised pursuant to the show cause
notice dated 21st February, 2006 (in respect of which the third writ
petition was still pending, but in which liberty was granted to the
Revenue to proceed with the adjudication without passing a final order).

32.

Be that as it may, it is not clear why, but the third writ

petition came to be listed before the Division Bench on 30 th March,
2007 (that is almost a year later). On that date, the writ petition was
ordered to be re-heard. It was then adjourned a couple of times and
eventually taken up on 27th July, 2007.

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 21 of 54

33.

On 27th July, 2007 the Division Bench noted the submission

of learned senior counsel for the Revenue that the show cause notice
dated 21st February, 2006 has been withdrawn and a fresh notice dated
18th July, 2007 has been served upon the Petitioner. Consequently, the
writ petition had become infructuous.

34.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner admitted receipt of the

notice dated 18th July, 2007 and sought liberty to challenge it. Liberty
was granted to the Petitioner as prayed for and the third writ petition
was dismissed as infructuous.

35.

It is under the above circumstances that the present writ

petition (the fourth writ petition) has been filed challenging the two
orders dated 19th April, 2007 and the notice dated 18th July, 2007
whereby the Petitioner has been asked to show cause why the
assessment order dated 31st March, 2003 be not revised.

36.

It is worth mentioning at this stage that the notice dated 18th

July, 2007 was issued in exercise of powers conferred by Section 16 of
the Works Contract Act read with Section 46 of the DST Act (both

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 22 of 54

repealed statutes). The notice was not issued under any provision of the
DVAT Act.

Proceedings in the fourth writ petition:
37.

On 10th August, 2007 a Division Bench of this Court issued

notice to the Revenue in the fourth writ petition as well as in the
application seeking stay of further proceedings pursuant to the show
cause notice dated 18th July, 2007. In the meanwhile, an ad interim stay
as prayed for was also granted to the Petitioner. On 15 th November,
2007 learned counsel for the parties were heard and the writ petition was
admitted for final hearing and the interim order passed on 10th August,
2007 was confirmed.

38.

Thereafter, on 4th January, 2008 an early hearing application

filed by the Respondents was taken up for consideration and dismissed.
Against the order rejecting early hearing, the Respondents preferred
Special Leave Petition (C) No. ……. /2008 [CC 2612-2613/2008] in
which the following order was passed on 22nd February, 2008:
“Heard.
Delay condoned.

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 23 of 54

We request the High Court to dispose of the writ petition as
early as practicable preferably by 15th March, 2008 so that
the apprehension of the petitioner that the proceedings may
get barred by time can be avoided. Let parties appear before
the Chief Justice of the High Court with a copy of our order
so that an appropriate Bench can be fixed and a firm date of
hearing can also be fixed.
The special leave petitions are accordingly
disposed of.”

This is how the fourth writ petition was listed before us for expeditious
disposal.

39.

We heard learned counsel for the parties from 27th to 29th

February, 2008 and then again from 3rd to 5th, 7th and 10th March, 2008
when judgment was reserved.

40.

During the course of hearing, we required learned counsel for

the Revenue to produce before us the order withdrawing the show cause
notice dated 21st February, 2006 and the order on the basis of which the
fresh show cause notice dated 18 th July, 2007 was issued. Learned
counsel placed before us an order passed by the Deputy Commissioner
dated 15th June, 2007 in the revision proceedings (initiated pursuant to
the earlier show cause notice dated 21 st February, 2006) and the
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 24 of 54

operative portion thereof reads as follows:
“Considering the objections raised by the dealer
and that the proper delegation to the D.C. (Spl. Zone) was
issued on 19.4.2007, there remains scope for some
confusion/ambiguity about the jurisdiction of the then Joint
Commr. Special Zone/Joint Commr. V who initiated the
proceedings on 21.2.2006 and also of the Deputy
Commissioner (Special Zone) before 19.4.2007.
“Without going into the merits of the case, it may
be appropriate that a fresh notice be issued to the dealer
calling for revision proceedings under Section 46 and the
case under Section 46 to be taken up accordingly.”

41.

We are unable to appreciate how the Deputy Commissioner

could have „withdrawn‟ the show cause notice dated 21 st February, 2006
issued by his superior officer, the Joint Commissioner, but we leave it at
that. In any event: no order was passed withdrawing the show cause
notice dated 21st February, 2006 but the withdrawal finds a mention in
the fresh show cause notice dated 18 th July, 2007 and no order was
passed permitting the issuance of the show cause notice dated 18 th July,
2007.

Submissions and discussion:
42.

At the outset, we may note two preliminary objections raised

by learned counsel for the Revenue. Firstly, it was contended that on the
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 25 of 54

principles of estoppel and res judicata the Petitioner cannot challenge
the jurisdiction of the Revenue to issue the show cause notice dated 18 th
July, 2007. Secondly, in the second writ petition decided on 3rd
November, 2006 this Court had permitted the Revenue to act in
accordance with law and it was thereby accepted that the Revenue could
issue the impugned show cause notice.

43.

Both the preliminary objections are only stated to be rejected.

The question of a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Revenue could
arise only when the show cause notice was issued and not earlier. There
is no question of the Petitioner being estopped or barred by the
principles of res judicata from challenging a show cause notice that was
not in existence earlier. There is also nothing that prevents the Petitioner
from challenging the show cause notice dated 18 th July, 2007 on all
available grounds, including jurisdictional ones. For the record, we may
only note that learned counsel for the Revenue relied upon M.P.
Raghavan Nair v. State Insurance Officer, AIR 1971 Kerala 175, State
of Uttar Pradesh v. Nawab Hussain, (1977) 2 SCC 806 and State of
Punjab v. Varinder Kumar, (2005) 12 SCC 806.

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 26 of 54

44.

In so far as the second preliminary objection is concerned,

that this Court permitted the Revenue to act in accordance with law
cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be construed to mean tacit
acceptance of the legitimacy of the actions of the Revenue. This goes
without saying.

45.

Coming to the meat of the matter, we are required to consider

whether, after the DVAT Act came into force, the Revenue could issue
the show cause notice dated 18th July, 2007 seeking to revise the
assessment order dated 31st March, 2003. To answer this question, we
would need to consider the following three issues:
1. Whether any proceedings for revising the assessment
order were at all initiated by the Revenue before 31st
March, 2005 when the DST Act and the Works Contract
Act were repealed? If not, the impact thereof.
2. If the answer to the above question is in the affirmative,
whether the proceedings initiated by the Revenue were
saved by the DVAT Act on the repeal of the DST Act and
the Works Contract Act on 31st March, 2005?
3. What is the effect (if any) of the omission, in the DVAT
Act, of the power to revise an assessment that was
available to the Commissioner under Section 16 of the
Works Contract Act read with Section 46 of the DST Act?

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 27 of 54

46.

The answer to the first question is entirely factual and that

question must be answered in the negative. The order dated 12th August,
2004 passed by the Commissioner directed the Zonal Assistant
Commissioner to revise the assessment order dated 31 st March, 2003 in
exercise of powers delegated to him under Section 46 of the DST Act.
However, the Zonal Assistant Commissioner took no steps to call for or
examine the record relating to the assessment order; nor was any
opportunity given to the Petitioner in this connection, either by issuing a
show cause notice or in any other manner calling upon the Petitioner to
place its case before him on or before 31st March, 2005.

47.

The Joint Commissioner, Special Zone took the first step

only on 21st February, 2006 when he issued a notice to the Petitioner
requiring it to show cause (somewhat indirectly though) why the
assessment order dated 31st March, 2003 be not revised. The Petitioner
was asked to appear before him on 27th February, 2006 along with
relevant records for the assessment year 2001-2002. Needless to say,
this notice was issued well after the repeal of the DST Act and the
Works Contract Act and also well after the DVAT Act came into force.

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 28 of 54

48.

Quite clearly, therefore, no steps were initiated by the

Revenue on or before 31st March, 2005 to revise the assessment order
dated 31st March, 2003. What is the impact of this?

49.

In Gajraj Singh v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal,

(1997) 1 SCC 650 the issue of inchoate rights is discussed just before
paragraph 30 of the Report under the heading Effect upon inchoate
rights. It was said:
“Rights of action which are dependent upon a statute, and
which are still inchoate and not reduced to possession or
perfected by final judgment, are lost by the repeal of the
statute from which they stem. This rule of construction is
simply a restatement of the common law principle of
construction that the repeal of a statute operates to divest all
rights accruing under the repealed statute and all proceedings
not concluded prior to the repeal, since inchoate rights are by
definition not vested rights such as to escape the common
law rule of effacement. The inchoate rights are but an
incident to the statute and fall with its repeal.”

50.

Similarly, in Gammon India Ltd. v. Special Chief Secretary,

(2006) 145 STC 1 it was held in paragraph 71 of the Report as follows:
“Since the effect of a repeal is to obliterate the statute and to
destroy its effective operation in future, or to suspend the
operation of the common law, when it is a common law
principle which is abrogated, any proceedings which have
not culminated in a final judgment prior to the repeal are
abated at the consummation of the repeal.”
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 29 of 54

51.

The effect of this is, quite clearly, that the process of a

revisionary proceeding, not having been initiated by the Revenue, dies a
natural death on the repeal of the DST Act and the Works Contract Act unless the right of the Revenue is otherwise saved by the DVAT Act –
an issue that we will presently consider.

52.

The matter may be looked at from another point of view.

Before the order dated 12th August, 2004 could be acted upon, its
operation was stayed by this Court on 20 th September, 2004 in a
miscellaneous application filed by the Petitioner in the first writ petition.
No steps were taken by the Revenue to have that stay lifted or vacated
and so the interim stay continued till 18 th November, 2005 by which
time the DST Act and the Works Contract Act were repealed.

53.

In other words, as on 1st April, 2005 there was no operative

order as far as the Petitioner is concerned. It was submitted by learned
counsel for the Revenue that the order dated 12 th August, 2004
nevertheless existed. As far as a theoretical and academic existence is
concerned, learned counsel may be correct but the existence was purely
academic and theoretical, since the order dated 12th August, 2004 was

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 30 of 54

set aside by this Court in the 3 rd November, 2006 in the second writ
petition. The effect of such a setting aside is explained in Shree
Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. v. Church of South India Trust Association,
(1992) 3 SCC 1 wherein it is held in paragraph 10 of the Report:
“Quashing of an order results in the restoration of the
position as it stood on the date of the passing of the order
which has been quashed.”

54.

Therefore, whichever way one considers the matter, the

inevitable conclusion is that no proceedings for revising the assessment
order were pending on 1st April, 2005.

55.

What existed, if at all, was a direction given by the

Commissioner to the concerned Assistant Commissioner to revise the
assessment order and that direction had not even been implemented by
that officer. Moreover, that direction was stayed before it could be
implemented and to make matters worse for the Revenue, the order
dated 12th August, 2004 was eventually struck down by this Court in the
second writ petition. Therefore, even if the Commissioner had any right
to revise the assessment order, neither he, nor his delegate ever
exercised that right (assuming it to be a right) till 1 st April, 2005. The

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 31 of 54

effect of this is that the “right” stood extinguished when the DST Act
and the Works Contract Act were repealed.

56.

This leads us to the second question, namely, whether the

revisionary proceedings (if they were initiated) were saved by the
DVAT Act. To answer this, we need to look at two „sub-issues‟. Firstly,
we need to interpret Section 106 of the DVAT Act and consider the case
law on the subject. It may be recalled that Section 106(2) of the DVAT
Act saves the previous operation of the DST Act and the Works
Contract Act and any right, title, entitlement, obligation or liability
already acquired, accrued or incurred there under. Therefore, we need to
consider whether the Revenue had any right to revise the assessment
order dated 31st March, 2003 on the repeal of the DST Act and the
Works Contract Act. Secondly, Section 106(3) of the DVAT Act
provides that anything done or any action taken under the repealed
statutes shall be deemed to have been done or taken in exercise of
powers conferred by the DVAT Act as if the DVAT Act was in force on
that date. Therefore, what we need to consider in this respect is whether,
notwithstanding anything else, Section 106(3) of the DVAT Act comes
to the rescue of the Revenue.

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 32 of 54

57.

Section 58(3) of the Administration of Evacuee Property

Ordinance 27 of 1949 (for short the Ordinance) is a combination of
Section 106(2) and Section 106(3) of the DVAT Act. Section 58(3) of
the Ordinance reads as follows:
“The repeal by this Act of the Administration of Evacuee
Property Ordinance, 1949 (XXVII of 1949)............... shall
not affect the previous operation thereof, and subject thereto,
anything done or any action taken in the exercise of any
power conferred by or under that Ordinance shall be deemed
to have been done or taken in the exercise of the powers
conferred by or under this Act, as if this Act were in force on
the day on which such thing was done or action was taken.”

58.

In Indira Sohanlal v. Custodian of Evacuee Property, AIR

1958 SC 77 the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court „divided‟ the
above provision into two parts, namely, the first part (which it described
as being in negative terms) whereby the previous operation of the
repealed statute survived the repeal. The second or positive part of the
provision deemed that the repealing statute was in force at an earlier
date.

59.

The Supreme Court drew a very important distinction

between the “previous operation of the repealed law” and the “future
operation of the previous law”. Amplifying this, in the context of the
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 33 of 54

second part of Section 58(3) of the Ordinance, it was held in paragraph
15 of the Report:
“Broadly speaking, the second portion of section
58(3) refers to the whole range of things that may be done, or
action that may be taken, under the previous Ordinance and
the rules framed thereunder, while the first portion of section
58(3) relates to the legal consequences resulting under the
Ordinance or the rules from certain facts or from completed
acts or things done thereunder.
Without attempting to be meticulously accurate, it
may be stated in general terms, that the scheme underlying
section 58(3) appears to be that every matter to which the
new Act applies has to be treated as arising, and to be dealt
with, under the new law except in so far as certain
consequences have already ensued or acts have been
completed prior thereto, to which it is the old law that will
apply.
In this view of section 58, the application of the
appellant for confirmation pending on the date when Central
Act XXXI of 1950 came into force had to be dealt with and
disposed of under this Act and the order of confirmation
passed in 1952 would clearly be subject to the revisional
power of the Custodian General under section 27 of the said
Act.”

60.

The need for such a long quotation is to emphasize what the

Supreme Court held, namely, that the first portion of Section 58(3) of
the Ordinance (which is similar to Section 106(2) of the DVAT Act)
relates to the legal consequences of a repeal. The second portion of
Section 58(3) of the Ordinance (which corresponds to Section 106(3) of
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 34 of 54

the DVAT Act) requires that every matter, to which the repealing Act
applies, has to be dealt with under the repealing Act and not under the
repealed statute.

61.

Therefore, even if revisionary proceedings had been initiated

in respect of the Petitioner under Section 46 of the DST Act, they would
have to be dealt with under the DVAT Act (which is not what has
happened in the present case that we are dealing with). But, as the
Legislature would have it, the DVAT Act did not provide for
revisionary proceedings in the first instance. Consequently, even if it
were to be argued that the revisionary proceedings initiated by the
Revenue were somehow or the other „saved‟, they died a legal death
because they could not be dealt with under the DVAT Act since no
revisionary jurisdiction was provided for under the DVAT Act.

62.

In Bishambhar Nath Kohli v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR

1966 SC 573 the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court again
considered Section 58(3) of the Ordinance. It was clarified, in respect of
the first part of Section 58(3) of the Ordinance that: “By the first part of
Section 58(3) repeal of the statutes mentioned therein did not operate to

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 35 of 54

vacate things done or actions taken under those statutes.” Thereby
matters and transactions past and closed remain operative.

63.

What this simply means (in so far as we are concerned) is

that in respect of the previous operation of the repealed statutes, a legal
fiction is created as a result of which it must be deemed that the repealed
statutes never existed, except as to transactions past and closed.

64.

This is made explicit in Gajraj Singh. In paragraph 22 of the

Report, it is said:
“Whenever an Act is repealed it must be considered, except
as to transactions past and closed, as if it had never existed.
The effect thereof is to obliterate the Act completely from the
record of Parliament as if it had never been passed; it never
existed except for the purpose of those actions which were
commenced, prosecuted and concluded while it was an
existing law. Legal fiction is one which is not an actual
reality and which the law recognizes and court accepts as a
reality. Therefore in case of legal fiction the court believes
something to exist which in reality does not exist. It is
nothing but a presumption of the existence of the state of
affairs which is actuality is non-existent. The effect of such a
legal fiction is that a position which otherwise would not
obtain is deemed to obtain under the circumstances.”

65.

Applying the law laid down by the Supreme Court, it must be

held that by virtue of Section 106(2) of the DVAT Act since the
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 36 of 54

previous operation of the DST Act and the Works Contract Act was
saved, the assessment order being a transaction past and closed under
those statutes, was also saved. As far as Section 106(3) of the DVAT
Act is concerned, the deeming provision only means that an order
passed under the repealed statute would have to be dealt with as if the
repealing Act was in force on that day and the powers and jurisdiction of
the authorities under the repealing Act must also be deemed to have
been in force on the date when that order was passed. But, it must be
remembered that the DVAT Act did not provide for any revisionary
power and so, no such power or jurisdiction was available on the date of
the assessment order, if the deeming fiction is taken to its logical
conclusion. However, it is not necessary for us to go to that extent,
because the next issue that we are required to consider is the right or
entitlement (if any) of the Revenue to revise the order of assessment – is
that saved by the provisions of the DVAT Act, even if everything is
assumed in favour of the Revenue?

66.

To answer this, it must be appreciated that there are three

kinds of revisionary powers. One in which a suitor or litigant may
approach a superior authority to revise an erroneous order. Section 115

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 37 of 54

of the Code of Civil Procedure is an obvious example of this; second,
where a superior authority has a suo motu power to revise an erroneous
order. Section 46 of the DST Act is an example of this. Third, a hybrid
revisionary power such as the one that existed in Section 36 of the
Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 where the „suitor‟ could approach
the Central Government to revise an erroneous order and the Central
Government could suo motu and independently revise an erroneous
order. We are concerned with the second category of the revisionary
power.

67.

The Supreme Court has interpreted the meaning of

revisionary power and that interpretation is applicable to all the above
three kinds of revisions. Three important decisions of the Supreme
Court were cited before us on the subject, and one of the Punjab and
Haryana High Court. Learned counsel for the Revenue relied upon a
decision of the Bombay High Court in Siemens India Ltd. v. State of
Maharashtra, [1986] 62 STC 40 but that decision did not even note the
earlier decisions of the Supreme Court and was even otherwise rightly
distinguished by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Moreover, the
observations made by the Bombay High Court (relied on by learned

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 38 of 54

counsel for the Revenue) are obiter and not binding. We are, therefore,
not adverting to that decision in any detail.

68.

The sum and substance of the contention of learned counsel

for the Petitioner was (and we agree with him) that the power of revision
is not a right and, therefore, it is not saved by the second part of Section
106(2) of the DVAT Act.

69.

In Hari Shankar v. Rao Girdhari Lal Chowdhury, AIR

1963 SC 698 the Supreme Court held in paragraph 7 of the Report:
“The distinction between an appeal and a revision is a real
one. A right of appeal carries with it a right of rehearing on
law as well as fact, unless the statute conferring the right of
appeal limits the rehearing in some way as, we find, has been
done is second appeals arising under the Code of Civil
Procedure. The power to hear a revision is generally given to
a superior Courts so that it may satisfy itself that a particular
case has been decided according to law. Under Section 115
of the Code of Civil Procedure, the High Court's powers are
limited to see whether in a case decided, there has been an
assumption of jurisdiction where none existed, or a refusal of
jurisdiction where it did, or there has been material
irregularity or illegality in the exercise of that jurisdiction.
The right there is confined to jurisdiction and jurisdiction
alone. In other acts, the power is not so limited, and the High
Court is enabled to call for the record of a case to satisfy
itself that the decision therein is according to law and to pass
such orders in relation to the case, as it thinks fit.”

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 39 of 54

In other words, the Supreme Court drew a distinction between a right of
appeal given to a suitor and an enabling power conferred on an authority
to correct an erroneous decision of a subordinate authority.

70.

The State of Kerala v. K.M. Charia Abdullah, AIR 1965 SC

1585 contains an oft quoted passage from the decision rendered by K.
Subba Rao, J. Unfortunately, that passage appears in the minority
judgment and gives a rather narrow interpretation to the scope of the
revisionary power of a superior authority. We are not concerned with the
scope and extent of the power of revision but the distinction between a
revision and an appeal. It is in this context that the view of K. Subba
Rao, J is important. This is what is said in paragraph 5 of the Report:
“When the Legislature confers a right of appeal in one case
and a discretionary remedy of revision in another, it must be
deemed to have created two jurisdictions different in scope
and content. When it introduced the familiar concepts of
appeal and revision, it is also reasonable to assume that the
well-known distinction between these two jurisdictions was
also accepted by the legislature. There is an essential
distinction between an appeal and a revision. The distinction
is based on differences implicit in the said two expressions.
An appeal is a continuation of the proceedings; in effect the
entire proceedings are before the appellate authority and it
has power to review the evidence subject to the statutory
limitations prescribed. But in the case of a revision, whatever
powers the revisional authority may or may not have, it has
not the power to review the evidence unless the statute
expressly confers on it that power.”
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 40 of 54

Purely by way of academic interest, it may be mentioned that the broad
interpretation given to the scope and extent of the power of revision by
J.C. Shah and S.M. Sikri, JJ in Charia Abdullah was upheld in Swastik
Oil Mills Ltd. v. H.B. Munshi, AIR 1968 SC 843 without disturbing the
distinction drawn between an appeal and a revision.

71.

All these decisions came up for consideration in Shiv Shakti

Coop. Housing Society v. Swaraj Developers, (2003) 6 SCC 659. In
that decision, the Supreme Court was dealing with the power of
revision. It was noted, in paragraph 13 and 14 of the Report that the
right of appeal is a substantive right, but there is no substantive right in
making an application for revision. Section 115 of the Code of Civil
Procedure is essentially a source of power to supervise a subordinate
Court and it does not confer any right on a litigant to have an erroneous
order corrected. “The scope for making a revision under Section 115 is
not linked with a substantive right.” In paragraph 33 of the Report, it
was categorically stated:
“Section 6 of the General Clauses Act has no application
because there is no substantive vested right available to a
party seeking revision under Section 115 of the Code [of
Civil Procedure].”
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 41 of 54

72.

All the above decisions were considered by the Punjab and

Haryana High Court in Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. v. State of
Haryana, [2005] 14 STC 119. Additionally, in that decision, a
contention was raised that Shiv Shakti concerned itself only with the
scope of revisionary powers under Section 115 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, but that contention was rejected. Eventually, in paragraph 23
of the Report, it was held:
“Even otherwise, we find that section 40 of the 1973 Act
merely conferred a power on the revisional authority giving
suo motu power to the revisional authority. No corresponding
right was conferred upon the department to file a petition
seeking revision of the order. An enabling provision in a
statute conferring certain power upon a competent authority
cannot be taken to be any right, much less a vested right in
favour of a suitor-department.”

73.

Based on the law cited before us, it is clear:
 The power of revision is an enabling power available to a superior
authority to correct an error committed by a subordinate authority.
 Shiv Shakti is not limited in its application to Section 115 of the
Code of Civil Procedure but follows the law earlier laid down,
generally, on the revisionary power of an authority.
 The power of revision being only an enabling power and not a
substantive right, it is not saved by Section 106(2) of the DVAT

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 42 of 54

Act, which only saves a „right‟ or an „entitlement‟, both being
synonymous.
 Consequently, whichever way one considers the problem, the
assessment order dated 31st March, 2003 could not have been reopened by the Revenue in the manner that we are concerned with.

74.

For a decision on the third issue, it is necessary to appreciate

the effect of the omission of a provision in a legislation enacted
subsequent to the repeal of an earlier legislation. We have already held
that no revision proceedings were initiated by the Revenue before 1st
April, 2005 pursuant to the order dated 12 th August, 2004. We have also
held that the enabling power of revision was not saved by Section
106(2) of the DVAT Act. Even if revision proceedings were initiated
and pending, we now have to consider the effect of the omission by the
Legislature to confer the power of revision under the DVAT Act.

75.

In paragraph 32 of the Report in Gajraj Singh the effect of

an omission in a subsequent legislation is discussed in the following
words:
“Existence of the corresponding provisions similar to the
repealed provisions is a condition precedent. If the operation
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 43 of 54

of the provisions in the Act is inconsistent and incompatible,
it gets obliterated and the earlier provisions no longer revive
or survive. If analogous provision in the Repealed Act does
not find place in the Act, the rights accrued or acquired
thereunder would not continue under the Act unless fresh
rights are acquired under the Act.”

76.

Kolhapur Canesugar Works Ltd. v. Union of India, (2000)

2 SCC 536 is far more categorical. In paragraph 34 of the Report, it is
held:
“It is our considered view that … the court is to look to the
provision in the rule which has been introduced after
omission of the previous rule to determine whether pending
proceedings will continue or lapse. If there is a provision
therein that pending proceedings shall continue and be
disposed of under the old rule as if the rule has not been
deleted or omitted then such proceedings will continue……
In the absence of any such provision in the statute or in the
rule the pending proceedings would lapse on the rule under
which the notice was issued or proceedings were initiated
being deleted/omitted.”
Similarly, in paragraph 37 of the Report, it is held:
“In a case where a particular provision in a statute is omitted
and in its place another provision dealing with the same
contingency is introduced without a saving clause in favour
of pending proceedings then it can be reasonably inferred
that the intention of the legislature is that the pending
proceedings shall not continue but fresh proceedings for the
same purpose may be initiated under the new provision.”
Earlier, in the same paragraph 37 of the Report, it has been held:
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 44 of 54

“If a provision of a statute is unconditionally omitted without
a saving clause in favour of pending proceedings, all actions
must stop where the omission finds them, and if final relief
has not been granted before the omission goes into effect, it
cannot be granted afterwards.”
This passage has been referred to by the Supreme Court in Shiv Shakti.

77.

Finally, in Gammon India Ltd. it has been held in paragraph

73 of the Report:
“On critical analysis and scrutiny of all relevant cases and
opinions of the learned authors, the conclusion becomes
inescapable that whenever there is a repeal of an enactment
and simultaneous re-enactment, the re-enactment is to be
considered as reaffirmation of the old law and the provisions
of the repealed Act which are thus re-enacted continue in
force uninterruptedly unless, the re-enacted enactment
manifests an intention incompatible with or contrary to the
provisions of the repealed Act. Such incompatibility will
have to be ascertained from a consideration of the relevant
provisions of the re-enacted enactment and the mere absence
of saving clause is, by itself, not material for consideration of
all the relevant provisions of the new enactment. In other
words, a clear legislative intention of the re-enacted
enactment has to be inferred and gathered whether it is
intended to preserve all the rights and liabilities of a
repealed statute intact or modify or to obliterate them
altogether.” (Emphasis supplied)

78.

It is clear, therefore, that the Supreme Court is emphatic in

holding that where an existing power is not conferred on the given
WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 45 of 54

authority by the repealing statute, it cannot survive the repeal; nor can
its ghost be invoked to revive a transaction that gets closed on the repeal
of an enactment. Furthermore, if a power does survive, it does so under
the new statute and not under the repealed statute.

79.

Learned counsel for the Revenue, however, contended that

the taxable event is when the Petitioner incurs a liability. Reliance was
placed on Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar, AIR 1958 SC
452 and The Kedarnath Jute Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The
Commissioner of Income Tax, (1972) 3 SCC 252 and T.K. Khadar
Mohiuddin v. State of Andhra Pradesh, [1968] 21 STC 45. It was
submitted that since the Petitioner had incurred a liability to pay tax, all
subsequent actions taken by the Revenue to recover the tax are
permissible and survive. We do not think this is correct for two reasons.
The question of the liability of the Petitioner to pay tax had come to an
end on the passing of the assessment order, which gave it an entitlement
to a refund. The liability of the Petitioner to tax would have arisen (if at
all) only after the revision of the assessment order - until then the
Revenue was liable for a refund. The liability of the Petitioner could
have arisen only if the assessment order was validly revised, and not

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 46 of 54

otherwise or until then.

80.

Secondly, the submission of learned counsel seeks to give

future operation to a previous law – which is clearly not permissible.
Section 106(3) of the DVAT Act cannot come to the rescue of the
Revenue because it proceeds on the basis that anything done under the
repealed Act would be deemed to have been done under the DVAT Act.
We have held that the power of revision was not exercised by the
Commissioner under the DST Act and so it could not continue under the
DVAT Act. Assuming that the Commissioner had exercised power
under the DST Act, it would (at best) be deemed to have been taken
under the DVAT Act by virtue of Section 106(3) thereof. But, the
fiction could continue only 31 st March, 2005 because thereafter the
DVAT Act actually came into force and it did not provide for a power of
revision. In other words, the real state of affairs overtook the imagined
state of affairs on 1st April, 2005 and it is only the real state of affairs
that could be recognized after 1st April, 2005. Section 106(3) of the
DVAT Act did not save the future operation of a previous law.

81.

The intention of the legislature was clear on 1st April, 2005

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 47 of 54

that it did not wish the Commissioner to have the power of revision,
otherwise it would certainly have been provided for. In any event, we
cannot read into the repealing statute a substantive provision that is not
provided for.

82.

Learned counsel for the Revenue referred to Southern

Petrochemical Industries Co. Ltd. v. Electricity Inspector & ETIO,
(2007) 5 SCC 447. The submission was that the provisions of Section6
of the General clauses Act, 1897 do not apply to the facts of the present
case. This was also the submission of learned counsel for the Petitioner,
though his reasons were different. Therefore, we need dwell at length on
this decision. There is, however, a passage in this decision in paragraph
92 of the Report, which is of some importance. This reads as follows:
“Omission of words in a particular statute may
play an important role. The intention of the legislature must
be, as is well known, gathered from the words used in the
statute at the first instance and only when such a rule would
give rise to an anomalous situation, may the court take
recourse to purposive construction. It is also a well-settled
principle of law that casus omissus cannot be supplied. (See
J. Srinivasa Rao v. Government of Andhra Pradesh, (2006)
12 SCC 607).

83.

The consequence of this is that the repeal of the DST Act and

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 48 of 54

the Works Contract Act coupled with the omission of the revisionary
power of the Commissioner under the new enactment, that is, the DVAT
Act completely obliterated or effaced that power such that it did not
survive after 1st April, 2005. There is nothing in the DVAT Act to
suggest that the power was intended to survive or be acted upon.

84.

It is true that a fresh power of revision was conferred on the

Commissioner by an amendment brought about to the DVAT Act on
16th November, 2005 when Section 74A was inserted in that Act but this
did not resuscitate or resurrect the long-dead revisionary power
conferred on the Commissioner under Section 46 of the DST Act. It had
no retrospective effect.

85.

What is the consequence of all this as on 1st April, 2005?

There were no pending proceedings for revision of the assessment order.
The power of revision earlier available with the Commissioner had
suffered a legal death. The natural consequence of this is that all the
delegated powers conferred by the Commissioner in relation to the
exercise of revisionary powers also suffered a legal demise.

This

includes the power delegated under the order dated 19 th September,

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 49 of 54

1994 (as mentioned in the order dated 19th April, 2007). Similarly, all
orders transferring the revisionary jurisdiction in respect of the
Petitioner from one jurisdiction to another also experienced a legal
death. This includes the order dated 16th January, 2006 (transferring
jurisdiction over the Petitioner to the Special Zone) and the order dated
24th August, 2006 (transferring the revisionary jurisdiction concerning
the Petitioner from the Joint Commissioner (Zone–I) to the Deputy
Commissioner, Special Zone). A copy each of both these orders was
handed over to us in Court by learned counsel for the Revenue.

86.

At this stage, we may mention that on our asking, learned

counsel for the Revenue informed us that the revisionary power
conferred on the Commissioner by Section 74A of the DVAT Act with
effect from 16th November, 2005 has not yet been delegated to anybody.
That being so, it is quite obvious that the order dated 16 th January, 2006
transferring jurisdiction over the Petitioner to the Special Zone cannot
have any relation to the power to exercise revisionary jurisdiction.

87.

In so far as the order dated 24th August, 2006 is concerned it

was not explained to us how it could transfer jurisdiction in respect of

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 50 of 54

revisions (which power has admittedly not been delegated) concerning
the Petitioner from the Joint Commissioner (Zone–I) to the Deputy
Commissioner, Special Zone. It is nobody‟s case that the Joint
Commissioner (Zone–I) ever had jurisdiction over the Petitioner and so
the transfer of the Petitioner‟s case from his jurisdiction simply does not
arise.

88.

For these very reasons, both the orders dated 19th April, 2007

(impugned in the writ petition) cannot be sustained.

The show cause

notice dated 18th July, 2007 (impugned in the writ petition) issued by the
Deputy Commissioner pursuant to the orders dated 19 th January, 2007
and under the repealed Works Contract Act read with the DST Act must
also fall through for the very same reasons.

89.

We note that the Deputy Commissioner also realized the bind

that he was in when he passed the order dated 15th June, 2007. He was
aware that the revisionary power had been delegated to the Assistant
Commissioner by the order dated 19th September, 1994. The show cause
notice dated 21st February, 2006 was issued by the Joint Commissioner
while the hearing was being conducted by him as the Deputy

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 51 of 54

Commissioner. It is for this reason that he stated in his order dated 15 th
June, 2007 that there was “scope for some confusion/ambiguity about
the jurisdiction of the then Joint Commr. Special Zone/Joint Commr. V
who initiated the proceedings on 21.2.2006 and also of the Deputy
Commissioner (Special Zone) before 19.4.2007.” This was quite an
understatement

and

under

these

circumstances,

the

Deputy

Commissioner „withdrew‟ the show cause notice dated 21st February,
2006 issued by an officer superior to him and issued a fresh show cause
notice dated 18th July, 2007 without reserving any right to do so and
without having the power to do so. The Revenue created a chakravyuh
and found itself trapped in it.

90.

This being so, we have no option but to allow the writ

petition and quash both the orders dated 19 th April, 2007 and the show
cause notice dated 18th July, 2007. We do so.

Costs:
91.

In paragraph 37 of the decision of the Supreme Court in

Salem Advocate Bar Association v. Union of India (2005) 6 SCC 344
it is said:

WP (C) No.5828/2007

Page 52 of 54

“Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that many
unscrupulous parties take advantage of the fact that either the
costs are not awarded or nominal costs are awarded against
the unsuccessful party. … … When Section 35(2) provides
for cost to follow the event, it is implicit that the costs have
to be those which are reasonably incurred by a successful
party except in those cases where the court in its discretion
may direct otherwise by recording reasons therefor. The costs
have to be actual reasonable costs including the cost of the
time spent by the successful party, the transportation and
lodging, if any, or any other incidental costs besides the
payment of the court fee, lawyer‟s fee, typing and other costs
in relation to the litigation.”

92.

Following the law laid down by the Supreme Court, we

requested learned counsel for the parties to indicate the costs incurred
by their respective clients. Both the parties have filed their memo of
costs. Since we have decided this writ petition in favour of the
Petitioner, we award costs incurred by it as per the memo filed, which is
Rs. 26,18,000/-. The costs be deposited by the Revenue by a cheque
drawn in favour of the Registrar General of this Court within four weeks
from today.
