JUDGMENT
19.02.2008
MUKUL MUDGAL, J. (ORAL)
The application being CM No.11522/2005 for condonation of delay of
th

883 days is filed on 18 July 2005 on behalf of the appellant stating therein

RFA 592/05

1 of 9

that there is sufficient cause for the delay in filing of the appeal. However,
in our view, no sufficient cause arises for the condonation of delay as the
appellant has not provided any documentary evidence to show that his father
was unwell and suffering from Cancer. Further reasons given for the delay,
such as the counsel met with an accident and he was busy in his treatment,
do not fall under the clause 'sufficient cause' required for granting
condonation of delay in terms of Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
2.

Though the appeal is liable to be dismissed for the delay, nevertheless

we have also considered the case on merits. With the consent of the learned
counsel for the parties the appeal is taken up for hearing.
3.

The brief facts as per the appellant sans unnecessary details leading to

the culmination of this appeal are as follows:
a)

The property bearing No.1859, Kucha Khayali Ram, Mohalla Imli,

Kucha Pati Ram, Bazar Sita Ram, Delhi – 110 006 (hereinafter referred to as
the “suit property”), earlier numbered as 1168 was previously owned by

RFA 592/05

2 of 9

Lala Harnath.
b)

Lala Harnath died at Delhi in the year 1945. Lala Harnath was only

having one female child named Tara Devi and the father of the appellant
named Shri Ram Kishore was the only son of Tara Devi who died on 3 rd
March 1969. During his life time Lala Harnath executed a Will dated 3 rd
April 1944 which was duly registered on 11th April 1944 bequeathing the
share of his properties to the present appellant as well as the respondent.
c)

At the time of execution of the Will by Lala Harnath, the appellant

was not born. The appellant, however, after birth and as per the contents of
the Will became the owner of the various properties including property
bearing House No.1859, (old number – 1168).
d)

In terms of the aforesaid Will, the appellant was since entitled for the

partition of the suit property.

The appellant requested the respondents

several times to get the suit property partitioned.
e)

Having left with no alternative the appellant filed a suit for partition

RFA 592/05

3 of 9

of the suit property as well as separate possession and mense profit which
was initially pending before this Court.
f)

The matter was subsequently transferred to the District Court due to

enhancement of the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Court.
g)

During the pendency of the aforesaid suit, Ram Kumar Gupta, (also

referred as Ram Kanwar Gupta) nephew of Lala Harnath, died and after his
death his legal heirs namely Shri Hari Kumar Gupta, Shri Narender Kumar
Gupta, Shri Krishan Kumar Gupta and Shri Rajan Kumar Gupta were
brought on record in place of deceased Ram Kumar Gupta.
h)

The learned Additional Sessions Judge heard the arguments of the

parties and delivered the judgment on 9th October 2002 thereby the suit of
the plaintiff / appellant was dismissed and accordingly, decree sheet was
drawn.
4.

The appellant has contended that the suit property was previously

owned by Lala Harnath, the maternal father of his father, who executed a

RFA 592/05

4 of 9

Will dated 3rd April, 1944 bequeathing his properties in favour of the present
appellant as well as the respondent.
5.

At the time of execution of the Will the appellant was not born,

however the appellant contended that as per the contents of the Will the
appellant was the owner of the suit property and as per the effect of the Will
of Lala Harnath the appellant was entitled to claim partition of the suit
property. Therefore, the appellant has requested the respondent on several
occasions to partition the suit property, however, the respondent failed to
partition the suit property. Thereafter the appellant filed a suit for partition
of the suit property.
6.

The grievance of the appellant is non-grant of the partition of the

property bearing No. 1168 (old) and 1859(new), Kucha Khayali Ram,
Mohalla Imli, Kucha Pati Ram, Bazar Sita Ram, Delhi 110 006, to the
appellant. The finding of the trial court is, that based on the Will, the
predecessor in title of the appellant only had a life time interest in the

RFA 592/05

5 of 9

property and the title so derived by the appellant, being at best a life time
interest therefore does not entitle him to claim partition of the said property.
7.

The appellant was directed to file in Court the Will made in favour of

the Bhagirti, his predecessor in title. The relevant portion of the Will reads
as follows:“(i)
The entire property, moveable and
immovable including cash, house hold
goods of every sort shall owned by my wife
Smt. Bhagirti in all the rights that I have
now in it, for her life. She shall realise the
rent of the houses. She shall have the
unrestricted right to have the joint property
partitioned.
Since Smt. Bhagirti can
adequately maintain herself from the rental
income she shall maintain herself from cash,
ornaments, and rental income. She can
spend it as she likes in going to pilgrimage
and giving donation. But she shall not have
the power to alienate in any manner the
immoveable property. After the death of my
wife Smt. Bhagirti, House Nos. 1145 and
1147, situated in Chowk Shah Mubarak
shall be owned and possessed by my
daughter's son Ram Kishore. Further in
House No. 1168, Ram Kishore my
daughter's son and his off spring shall have
the right of residence. But Ram Kishore

RFA 592/05

6 of 9

aforesaid shall have no right to alienate
houses Nos. 1145 and 1147 mentioned
above. He shall have only the right to
realise the rent and use it. After the death of
Ram Kishore my daughter's son, his male
offspring whether adopted or natural born,
shall be the owner of the property Nos. 1145
and 1147 like myself and they shall have full
rights to alienate the property in any way
like myself.
But in House No. 1168 they shall have only
the right of residence. The remaining half
share in House No. 1148 and the entire
Houses Nos. 1052, 1053, after the death of
Smt. Bhagirti shall be owned and possessed
by Ram Kumar my nephew. But he shall
have no right to alienate the property. He
shall have only the right to realise rent and
use it. After the death of Ram Kumar his
male issue shall own and possess the half
share in House No. 1148 and House No.
1052 and 1053 just like myself and they will
have all the full rights to alienate the same in
any way they like just like the rights I have.
Further, if no offspring of Ram
Kishore my daughter's son occupy half
house No. 1168 owned by me, it would
revert to my nephew Ram Kumar. But Ram
Kumar my nephew shall have only the right
to realise rent. He shall have no right to sell,
gift, mortgage etc. the property. After his
death his male offspring shall own it in the

RFA 592/05

7 of 9

same capacity as I now own it. No relation
of mine near or distant shall have any right
to interfere with the Will.”
(Emphasis supplied)

8.

Only a limited right having been received by the appellant through

Bhagirti in property No.1859 (old number – 1168), who herself only had a
right of residence, only a lifetime interest had been granted to him. Having
perused the above contents of the Will, the finding of the trial court based
upon the Will declining the grant of partition sought by the appellant cannot
be faulted.

Furthermore, we can not help noticing that the appellant who

claims his descent and rights through Ram Kishore, who had already
secured his rights in property No.1145 and 1147 and in addition is trying to
have his limited right enforced to the detriment of the respondent Ram
Kumar Gupta who had half right in the property No.1859 (old number 1168)
and further right to the extent that if no offspring of Ram Kishore the
appellant's father occupies half house No.1168, the said property would
revert back to the respondent. Thus, even the interest of justice also do not
RFA 592/05

8 of 9

warrant interference with the impugned judgment. Accordingly, we find no
merit in the appeal which is dismissed as such.
9.

The appeal and all pending applications are dismissed and stand

disposed of accordingly.
