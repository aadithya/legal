PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
Petitioner as well as first respondent are in dispute

qua ownership and possession of a piece of land.

Common

case of both the parties is that Hari Kishan owned the land in
question at some point of time.
2.
in the

Whereas Nirmla, R-1, claims right, title and interest
land

through

a

registered

general power of

attorney, agreement to sell and a will dated 5.5.2004 executed
in her favour by one M.K.Tyagi who in turn claims right under
page 1 of 3

Hari Kishan through similarly executed documents, petitioner
claims a direct interest under Hari Kishan and relies upon
certain documents stated to be executed by Hari Kishan on
7.8.1997 being a general power of attorney, agreement to sell,
receipt etc. But, the documents relied upon by the petitioner
are not registered documents.
3.

On the issue of interim injunction ,learned Trial Judge

held that the documents relied upon by both parties entitled
none to an injunction against each other. The appeal filed by
respondent No.1 resulted in an interim injunction being passed
in her favour. Reason given by the learned Appellate Judge is
that documents relied upon by Nirmla are better documents for
the reason they are registered documents. Qua the documents
of the petitioner it has been held that being unregistered
documents they would have lesser probated evidentiary value.
4.

The land in question is a vacant land.

5.

I concur with the reasoning of the learned Appellate

Judge.
6.

Before concluding I must note that unauthorized

colonization

is

creating a problem

disputes are very difficult to resolve.

in

Courts. Possessory

The reason is that law

requires evidence to be tested with reference to some admitted
position at site, when the dispute relates to possession;

meaning thereby, rival versions are tested on some authentic
factual situation at the site.

Pertaining to unauthorized

colonization the purity of evidence can never be tested for the
reason everything is done illegally and there is no reference
point wherefrom the Court can test the purity of the evidence
led by respective parties. Unfortunately, the rule of the jungle
prevails. He who is in possession retains the same.
7.

Be that as it may, the view taken by the learned

Appellate Judge is a reasonable and a probable view. The view
taken by the learned Appellate Judge does not call for any
interference under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
8.

The petition is dismissed in limine.
