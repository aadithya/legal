1.

The petitioner (Alcon Builders & Engineers Pvt Ltd) was enlisted as a

Class-I electrical contractor with the Directorate General of Works, Central
Public Works Department sometime in 1983. The enlistment of the petitioner
as a Class-I electrical contractor was revalidated from time to time and for a
further period of five years it was revalidated upto 07.08.2005 by virtue of an

WP(C)13002/06

Page No.1 of 5

Office Order dated 12.09.2000. The petitioner applied for further revalidation
which was received in the office of the respondents on 15.07.2005. The request
for revalidation was rejected by the impugned Office Memorandum dated
24.07.2006 in the following terms:“The competent authority has considered the case of
revalidation as the contractor had failed to secure any work of
appropriate nature & amount as required as per Enlistment
Rules 2001 under Para 21 (i), (ii) & (iii) during the
revalidation of enlistment & provisional extension granted to
the contractor.
Accordingly the name of the Contractor M/s Alcon Builders
& Engineers Pvt. Limited, B-1/51, Malviya Nagar, New
Delhi-110017 is removed from the approved list of CPWD
Contractors.”
A plain reading of the aforesaid reasons for refusing revalidation of the
petitioner indicates that the petitioner had allegedly failed to secure any work of
appropriate nature and amount as required in terms of Enlistment Rules, 2001
under para 21 (i), (ii) & (iii) during the revalidation of enlistment and
provisional extension granted to the contractor.

2.

The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that this reason is

without any factual basis. First of all, she drew my attention to Rule 19 of the
aforesaid Enlistment Rules which deals with revalidation of enlistment. The
same reads as under:“19.0 Revalidation of Enlistment
The validity of initial enlistment of the contractor shall be as
given in para 7.0. It shall, however, be revalidated on merits if
desired by the contractor. Only the contractor who has secured at
least one work of appropriate magnitude in CPWD, PWD
WP(C)13002/06

(NCTD) or CCU of Ministry of Environment & Forests during
the period of enlistment or last revalidation period of enlistment
as the case may be, shall be considered for revalidation.
A work completed/secured as an associate contractor of the main
contractor, to whom a composite contract was/has been awarded,
shall also qualify for consideration of revalidation.”
Reading the said Rule 19.0, the learned counsel submitted that for a
consideration for the purposes of revalidation, it was necessary that the
contractor should have secured at least one work of an appropriate magnitude in
CPWD, PWD(NCTD) or CCU of Ministry of Environment & Forests during
the period of enlistment or last revalidation period of enlistment as the case may
be.

3.

In this context, she submitted that on 30.09.2003, the petitioner was

awarded the work of LT Panel Board for a contract amount of approximately 17
lakhs. She referred to the document at page 44 which is a copy of a completion
certificate issued by the CWPD on 13.06.2005 indicating therein the
satisfactory completion of the said work. Apart from this, the learned counsel
for the petitioner was able to point out that the CPWD had awarded two further
works on 28.09.2005 and 09.09.2005 of the value of approximately Rs.2.24
crores and Rs.2.16 crores.

Therefore, according to her, the contention of

having at least one work of an appropriate nature and amount stood satisfied
and the reason indicated in the impugned order dated 24.07.2006 stood belied.
She further submitted that by virtue of a letter dated 23.08.2005 issued by the
Superintending Engineer (C&M), CPWD, a temporary extension validation was
WP(C)13002/06

granted to the petitioner for enlistment with immediate effect upto 21.02.2006.
Therefore, according to the learned counsel for the petitioner, even the
statement that the petitioner had failed to secure any work during the
provisional extension granted to the contractor is also factually incorrect. She
submits that in view of these errors on the understanding of the factual position,
the petitioner's enlistment has not been revalidated.

4.

The learned counsel for the respondent attempted to justify the impugned

Office Memorandum dated 24.07.2006 by stating that not only the quantity of
work, but also the nature and quality of the work was required to be seen before
revalidation was granted. However, he could not give any satisfactory reason
for the incorrect statement recorded in the Office Memorandum that no work
had been secured either during the revalidation period or during the provisional
extension period granted to the contractor.

5.

Considering the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties,

I am inclined to agree with those made by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
The reason is very clear. The facts clearly belie the findings recorded in the
Office Memorandum dated 24.07.2006. The petitioner had been awarded work
during the revalidated period and also during the period of provisional
extension. Even the quantity of the works was of sufficient magnitude. In

WP(C)13002/06

these circumstances, the impugned order is set aside. The respondents are
directed to re-validate the enlistment of the petitioner within two weeks.

This writ petition stands disposed of. No order as to costs.
