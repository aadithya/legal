PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
FIR No.259/07 Dated 12.4.2007
U/S 498A/406/34 IPC
P.S. Punjabi Bagh
It appears to be a case of commercial-cum-

1.

matrimonial dispute.
2.

Uma Kapur and Shashi Kapur seek pre-arrest bail in

the afore-noted FIR which has been lodged by Aakanksha.
Shashi Kapur is the wife of the younger brother of the fatherin-law of the complainant. Uma Kapur is the mother-in-law of
the complainant.
3.

Complainant married Shashank Kapur on 27.6.2004.

She claims that her father spent Rs.1.5 crores when marriage
took place.
4.

Allegations in the F.I.R. are that her husband was a

drunkard and a drug addict and that after marriage the couple
proceeded

to

Spain

for

their

honeymoon.

Shashank

misbehaved with her and hit her. From Spain, they reached
London. At London also her husband would remain in drunken
condition. They were left with no money.

She rang up her

father-in-law and requested that some money may be sent to
them.

He refused.

Her father had to send money.

They

came back to Delhi. Shashank apologised for whatever had

page 2 of 13

happened.

They went back to London and set up residence.

At London her husband used to regularly assault her.

She

was compelled to leave London and come back to India.

That

her mother-in-law and her chachi saas (Shashi Kapur) had
taken away her entire jewellery.
5.

According to petitioners, Aakanksha and Shashank

knew each other since the year 2000. It was a love marriage.
Marriage was solemnised on 27.6.2004.
marriage.

It was a dowry less

After the marriage, Parveen Gupta, father of the

complainant and Sunil Gupta, younger brother of the father of
the complainant started demanding money from Shashank's
father.

They told that they were in financial hardship.

A

company, M/s Suave Apparels Pvt.Ltd. was a family concern of
Parveen Gupta and his brother. M/s Walaity Ram Kewal was
their family firm. M/s Manohar Lal Kapur & Sons Pvt.Ltd. was a
family firm of the father of Shashank. From the account of the
said family firm, Rs.50 lacs and Rs.60 lacs were given to M/s
Suave

Apparels

Pvt.Ltd.

and

M/s

Walaity

Ram

Kewal

respectively. That notwithstanding transfer of said money to
the company

and the family firm of the father of the

complainant, it was the complainant and her family members
who continued to harass the family of Shashank demanding

6.
lacs

Transfer of money in sum of Rs.50 lacs and Rs.60
to M/s Suave Apparels Pvt.Ltd. and

M/s Walaity Ram

Kewal is an undisputed fact.
7.

Learned counsel for the petitioners urged that

gravement of the allegations in the FIR

pertaining to the

harassment are directed only against the husband of the
complainant. That only allegation against the petitioners is of
retaining the dowry of the complainant.

It was urged that

there are no particulars of the date, place or to whom
entrustment

was made.

It was urged that the complaint is

false. That the complainant had got her jewellery in her locker.
8.

Lastly,

counsel

submitted

that

the

in-laws

of

Shashank are prepared to deposit Rs.50 lacs by means of a
fixed deposit receipt and place the receipt at the disposal of
the learned Trial judge. The amount could be disbursed at the
end of the trial depending upon the result of the trial.
9.

Opposing the application for bail, learned counsel

for the complainant submitted that the petitioners are playing
hide and seek with the court.

That Shashank's father entered

into a settlement with the complainant and her father on
4.5.2007 as per which it was agreed that Rs.2.5 crores would
page 4 of 13

be paid to the complainant in full and final satisfaction of her
claim for dowry and maintenance. It was agreed that Rs.5 lacs
would be paid by 8.5.2007. Rs.1.2 crores by 8.5.2007. Rs.1.25
crores would be paid by 8.6.2007. That it was further agreed
that based on the settlement, the in-laws of the complainant
would be granted anticipatory bail. Learned counsel for the
complainant further submitted that application for anticipatory
bail was filed by the petitioners before the learned ASJ.
Shashank's father who was arrested applied for bail.

In the

application seeking anticipatory bail filed by the petitioners
they relied upon the settlement dated 4.5.2007.

Shashank's

father obtained bail by relying upon the settlement. That on
11.5.2007 learned ASJ while adjourning the hearing of the
application filed by the petitioners seeking anticipatory bail
noting the settlement between the parties.

That the matter

was adjourned from time to time to enable the in-laws of the
complainant to pay the amount as per the settlement. They
failed.

On 10.9.2007, learned ASJ refused to

extent

anticipatory bail granted. That the petitioners filed a revision
petition in this Court challenging the order passed by the
learned ASJ declining to extend the interim bail.

That the

revision petition was dismissed vide order dated 12.10.2007
page 5 of 13

on the ground that the petitioners could not predicate the
claim for anticipatory bail de-hors the ground on which they
had pleaded for grant of anticipatory bail, namely, settlement
arrived at between the parties. Since settlement was not being
adhered to, no member of the family of Shashank was entitled
to anticipatory bail. It was urged by learned counsel for the
respondent that in view of order dated 12.10.2007 passed by
V.B.Gupta, J. dismissing the revision petition filed by the
petitioners, no case was made out for grant of anticipatory bail
to the petitioners. In respect of the money advanced to the
company and firm of the family of the complainant, learned
counsel submitted that it was purely a commercial transaction.
In any case, a suit has been

filed for recovery of the said

amount.
10.

It is not in dispute that the settlement dated

4.5.2007 arrived at was when Harish Gupta, father-in-law of
the complainant and husband of Uma Kapur, was in police
custody.

Thus prima facie, said settlement has to be taken

with a pinch of salt.
11.

However, the petitioners still have a hurdle to

overcome.
12.

As noted above, on 11.5.2007 the petitioners filed
page 6 of 13

an application seeking anticipatory bail before the learned ASJ.
They could have pleaded for anticipatory bail by projecting a
case on merits and not basing their claim on the settlement
between the parties.

Further, having obtained interim

bail

they

to

the

matter

being

considered on the ground that the settlement required
payments to be made in three installments and that money
would be paid. Not only that, first installment of the agreed
settlement in sum of Rs.5 lacs was also paid.
13.

The subsequent conduct, to some extent, mitigates

against the presumption that the settlement was the result of
police coercion and since Shashank's father was arrested and
was in police custody,

the police personnel brokered a

settlement between the parties.
14.

But, issue of personal liberty has not to be decided

on a bargain between the parties.

Right to life and property is

too precious to be bartered.
15.

Even statutory rights have

been placed at a high

pedestal

and have been held not subject to the rule of

estoppel where a plea is raised that a party concerned has
consented to a particular course of action, which action is in
derogation of the statutory right of the party concerned.
page 7 of 13

16.

In the decision reported as (1998) 6 SCC 507

P.R.Deshpande Vs. Maruti Balaram Bibatti it was observed as
under :“9. It is now trite that the principle of estoppel
has no application when statutory rights and
liabilities are involved. It cannot impede right of
appeal and particularly the constitutional remedy.
The House of Lords has considered the same
question in Evans V. Bartlam, (1937) 2 All ER 646.
The House was dealing with an order of the court of
appeal where Scott, L.J. approved contention of a
party to put the matter on the rule of election on
the premise that the defendant knew or must be
presumed to know that he had the right to apply to
set the judgment aside and by asking for and
obtaining time he irrevocably elected to abide by
the judgment. Lord Atkin, reversing the above
view, has observed thus :
“My Lords, I do not find myself convinced by
these judgments. I find nothing in the facts
analogous to cases where a party, having
obtained and enjoyed material benefit from a
judgment, has been held precluded from
attacking it while he still is in enjoyment of
the benefit. I cannot bring myself to think
that a judgment-debtor, who asks for and
receives a stay of execution, approbates the
judgment, so as to preclude otherwise. Nor
do I find it possible to apply the doctrine of
election.”
10. Lord Russell of Killowen while concurring with
the aforesaid observations has stated thus :
“My Lords, I confess to a feeling of some
bewilderment at the theory that a man (who,
so long as it stands, must perforce
acknowledge and bow to a judgment of the
court regularly obtained), by seeking and
page 8 of 13

17.

obtaining a temporary suspension of its
execution, thereby binds himself never to
dispute its validity or its correctness, and
never to seek to have it set aside or reversed.
If this were right, no defeated litigant could
safely ask his adversary for a stay of
execution pending an appeal, for the grant of
the request would end the right of appeal.
The doctrine of election applies only to a man
who elects with full knowledge of the facts.”
In the decision reported as Upalaniappan & Anr. Vs.

Sub Inspector of Police 2005 SCC (Crl.) 1586, a condition
requiring the accused to pay Rs.10 lacs for securing the benefit
of bail was held to be onerous.
18.

No doubt, while granting bail or anticipatory bail,

conditions can be imposed but the conditions cannot be such
which amount to compelling a person to buy his or her
freedom.
19.

In my considered opinion, petitioners are entitled to

have their case considered for grant of anticipatory bail on
merits,

ignoring the settlement which Shashank's

father

executed with the complainant.
20.

Thus,

order

passed

by

my

learned

brother

V.B.Gupta, J. dismissing the revision petition filed by the
petitioners challenging the order passed by the learned ASJ
refusing to extend the interim anticipatory bail granted to
them would not come in the way of the petitioners and the
page 9 of 13

petitioners would be entitled to have their case considered for
grant of anticipatory bail on merits.
21.

Reverting to the merits of the controversy, suffice

would it be to note that allegations of harassment in the FIR do
not relate to dowry demand at all.

Further, the allegations of

harassment are directed against Shashank.

Even read very

liberally, the FIR does not make out the offence under Section
498A against the petitioners.
22.

Pertaining to the offence under Section 406 IPC,

relevant would it be to note that only allegations in the FIR
which are referable to entrustment are as under :-

23.

“My mother-in-law and chachi saas took my
entire dowry articles including ornaments
and did not give back to me despite various
requests.”
When was the jewellery entrusted to the petitioners

has not been stated by the complainant.

Further, the

complainant and her husband set up their matrimonial house
in London.

A strong presumption would arise that the

complainant had kept with her the jewellery which was gifted
to her at the time of her marriage. Besides, the complainant
has a locker in her name in a bank.

She operates the locker.

This re-enforces the presumption that the complainant had
custody of her jewellery with her.

I have prefaced the present order by opining that it

appears to be a matrimonial-cum-commercial dispute.

from the coffers of the firm of Shashank's family to the family
company and firm of the complainant. The said amount has
yet to be returned. A civil suit is pending on the Original Side
of this court pertaining to the money advanced.
25.

It is thus not a case where the family of the girl was

in a subservient position to the family of the in-laws. The two
families appear to be in an equal position of bargain.

29.

As noted above, learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that Shashank's family is prepared to deposit Rs.50
lacs by means of a fixed deposit receipt with the learned ASJ
subject to any orders which may be passed at the end of the
trial.
30.

I thus dispose of the petitions directing that within

three weeks from today petitioners would deposit in the trial
court a fixed deposit receipt

in sum of Rs.50 lacs, deposit

being with a nationalised bank for a period of three years and
in the name of the learned trial court, subject to said deposit
being made and on the condition that petitioners would
cooperate with the Investigating Officer in the conduct of
investigation, in the

event of arrest, petitioners would be

released on bail on their furnishing personal bond in the sum of
Rs.50,000/- each with one surety each in the like amount to
the satisfaction of the learned I.O.
31.

It would further be a term of the bail granted to the

petitioners that they would surrender their passport.
32.

Deposit made with the learned trial court pursuant

to the present order would be subject to any further orders
which may be passed by the learned trial court after evidence
