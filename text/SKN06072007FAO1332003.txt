SANJIV KHANNA, J:
1. The present appeals arise out of the common award dated 27th
May, 2002 passed by Motor Accidents' Claim Tribunal deciding
the claim petitions filed by the appellants. The appellants have
claimed enhancement of compensation in the present appeals.
The appellant no. 1, Smt. Ramesh, in all three appeals is
mother of late Ms. Lalita, Ms. Munita and Mr. Dinesh. The
second appellant in these appeals is Mr. Paramjeet, brother of

FAO NOS. 133/2003, 135/2003 & 136/2003

Page 2

the late Ms. Lalita, Ms. Munita and Mr. Dinesh.
2. The deceased were travelling in a car bearing registration No.
DNC-3697, which met with an accident on the night intervening
18th and 19th June, 1997 with truck bearing registration No. HR38-A-6990. As a result of the said accident, all three of them
expired. The said truck was being driven by Mr. Nand Lal, the
respondent No. 1 and owned by Mr. Rajinder Pal Singh, the
respondent No. 2.

The said truck was

insured with the

Oriental Insurance Company Limited at the time of the
accident. Learned Motor Accidents' Claim Tribunal has given a
finding that the deceased lost their lives due to the accident
caused by rash and negligent driving of the respondent No. 1.
There is no challenge to the said finding. Therefore, I need not
re-examine this aspect. The only question and issue raised in
the present appeals is with regard to quantum of total
compensation awarded to the appellants. In the case of Ms.
Lalita and Ms. Munita, compensation of Rs.1,50,000/- has
been awarded and in the case of Mr. Dinesh, compensation of
Rs.2,00,000/- has been awarded.
3. In the case of Ms. Lalita and Ms. Munita, learned Tribunal
noticed that both of them were studying but it was claimed that
they were simultaneously stitching clothes and earning income.

FAO NOS. 133/2003, 135/2003 & 136/2003

Page 3

Neither of them had obtained any diploma or special training
for stitching clothes. Learned Tribunal however believed that
the two daughters must be stitching clothes, but noticed that no
evidence was produced to show any income being earned by
them.

It was also noticed that in normal course the two

daughters would have got married and this was a relevant
factor to be taken into consideration while calculating loss of
dependency. In the case of Mr. Dinesh, the allegation made
was that he was earning Rs.3,000/- per month by driving
tractor and ploughing fields.

He was educated upto class-XII.

However, in his case also the learned Tribunal held that no
conclusive and relevant evidence was led to show that Mr.
Dinesh

was

earning

and,

therefore,

compensation

of

Rs.2,00,000/- was awarded.
4. The appellant-claimants herein are mother and brother of the
the deceased. The mother is a widow. She has lost her three
children in one accident.

Compensation is paid to the

claimants on account of loss of dependency as well as nonpecuniary loss.
4. Loss of dependency is calculated on the basis of the pecuniary
loss caused to the claimant due to the untimely death.
Multiplier method is applied to calculate the said loss of

FAO NOS. 133/2003, 135/2003 & 136/2003

dependency.

Page 4

This method requires computation of annual

pecuniary loss caused to the claimants on the basis of the
annual income of the deceased. This is done by reducing from
the annual income that the deceased would have earned, a
proportion towards personal expenditure which the deceased
would have incurred on himself.

In the present case, the

claimants are mother and brother of the three deceased who at
the time of the accident were unmarried. But for the accident,
three of them in the normal course would have got married and
it can presumed that substantial part of their income/earnings
would have been utilized by them on their spouses and
children. This aspect has to be kept in mind while calculating
the annual dependency of the appellant-claimants. Normally,
where deceased was an unmarried person who was likely to
get married and the claimants are parents,

about 50% of the

annual income that deceased would have earned in future is
regarded as annual loss of dependency or multiplicand.
5. For the purpose of multiplier, the age of the deceased and the
age of the claimants is taken into consideration. The multiplier
is selected keeping in mind the term and the period during
which the dependency of the claimants on the deceased is
expected to last. It also depends upon the bank interest rates

FAO NOS. 133/2003, 135/2003 & 136/2003

Page 5

and the annual return or yield. The multiplier given in Schedule
II, with some modification and scaling down is applied to a
petition u/s 166 of the Act. The object and purpose is to
calculate a principal sum to give sufficient annual yield/return in
a stable economy to the dependent claimants, equal to the
annual loss of dependency during the entire term during which
the dependency is expected to last.

While calculating the

capital lump sum figure, we have to keep in mind that the
capital sum figure itself would be gradually reduced, utilised
and paid as a part of the annual yield so as to be reduced to
zero level at the end of the expected term of the dependency.
6. Keeping these aspects and principles, let us examine the
evidence on record.

7. The claimants-appellants had only produced one witness
namely appellant no.1, Smt. Rajesh who was examined as
PW-1. She was 48 years old on the date of her statement on
22.3.2001.

Her husband has died 14 years back and the

accident had taken place on the night intervening 18th and 19th
June, 1997.

Her age can be, therefore, taken as 45 years on

the date of the accident. The other claimant, Mr. Paramjit, as
per the medical papers produced on record, (he was also

FAO NOS. 133/2003, 135/2003 & 136/2003

Page 6

injured in the said accident), was 14 years old at the time of the
accident. Smt. Ramesh in her statement had claimed that Ms.
Lalita was 21 years old and was studying in B.A. (Final).
Similarly, it was stated that Ms. Munita was 17 years old and
studying in Class XII. It was further claimed that both of them
were earning by doing stitching work etc.

However, no

evidence has been placed on record to show that Ms. Munita
and Ms. Lalita were studying. It may be pointed out that in the
case of the third deceased, Mr. Dinesh, provisional certificate
issued by the Kerala School was placed on record. It has not
been explained why no document or school records of Ms.
Munita and Ms. Lalita were filed and proved, while in the case
of Mr. Dinesh, school certificate was produced. Similarly, there
is no evidence whatsoever to show that Ms. Munita and Ms.
Lalita were doing stitching work and earning income.
Admittedly they had not taken any training.

No bills/receipt

book or copy of bank account of the deceased was placed on
record. With the evidence available, it cannot be presumed
that Ms. Lalita and Ms. Munita were studying and also earning
any income. Certified copy of the post mortem report in the
case of Ms. Munita is on the record. In the said report, her age
is described as 25 years old and not 17 years old as mentioned

FAO NOS. 133/2003, 135/2003 & 136/2003

Page 7

by Ms. Ramesh. Post mortem report of Mr. Dinesh and Ms.
Lalita has not been placed on record. In case of Mr. Dinesh,
the date of birth

as per the provisional school certificate

Ex.PW1/1 is 16th July, 1979 and, therefore, on the date of the
accident he had recently become an adult or 18 years old. It
was claimed that Mr. Dinesh was the owner of a tractor and
used to plough fields and was earning Rs.3,500/- per month. It
is difficult to believe the said statement. The driving licence of
Mr. Dinesh was not produced and the registration book and
papers of the tractor allegedly owned by Mr. Dinesh were not
filed. To have a driving licence under the Motor Vehicles Act, a
person should be 18 years old.

Mr. Dinesh as per school

leaving certificate had just become 18 years of age at the time
of the accident.

No pass book or statement of bank account

was filed to prove income that Mr. Dinesh was allegedly
earning. Mr. Dinesh had got compartment as per the
provisional certificate having secured 10 marks in Mathematics
out of 100.
8. As per the IInd Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, income of
non-earning persons is deemed to be Rs.15,000/- per annum.
Similarly, in case of death of a spouse, 1/3rd is deduced from
the annual income towards personal expenses. In this case the

FAO NOS. 133/2003, 135/2003 & 136/2003

Page 8

claimants being mother and brother and the deceased being
unmarried, 50% should be deducted from the annual income
that the deceased were expected to earn. The dependency of
the claimants on the deceased is therefore 50% of the annual
income that the deceased would have earned in future.
Keeping all these aspects in mind and treating the annual
income of all the deceased as Rs.15,000/- per annum, I am
inclined to deduct 1/2 from the aforesaid amount towards
personal expenses in the case of Mr. Dinesh, Ms. Munita and
Ms. Lalita.

In view the age of the claimants, specially the

mother, multiplier of 12 is applied, the total compensation or
loss of dependency works out to Rs.90,000/- in the three
cases. Even if we award non-pecuniary compensation of
Rs.50,000/- in each of the three cases, the total compensation
payable will be Rs.1,40,000/- each, which is less than the
compensation

awarded

by

the

learned

Tribunal

of

Rs.1,50,000/- each in the case of Ms. Lalita and Ms. Munita
and Rs.2 lacs in the case of Mr. Dinesh.
9. While fixing non-pecuniary compensation at Rs.50,000/-, I have
taken into account the fact that Smt. Ramesh, the mother had
lost her husband 14 years back and in the accident she lost her
two grown up daughters and one son. It goes without saying

FAO NOS. 133/2003, 135/2003 & 136/2003

Page 9

that this must have been a traumatic experience and an
emotional set back for a mother. In addition to the loss of
dependency, the appellants are also entitled to non-pecuniary
compensation for loss of company, love and affection. Human
life cannot be simply measured in terms of loss of dependency
or pecuniary loss. Loss of a brother, sister, son or daughter is
always painful. It is easy to appreciate the difficult time and the
emotional stress and strain which the widow mother has gone
through as she has lost her three young children in an accident
in one day.

The said children were in the age group of 17-25

years. They would have been a pillar of support to her in her
old age and provided her with emotional as well as physical
helping hand.
10. While fixing the multiplicand, I have not taken into
consideration future prospects of increase in “Income” of the
deceased. This is so because no evidence has been led by the
appellant-claimants to justify any such claim. (Ref. Bijay Kr.
Dugar versus Bidya Dhar Dutta reported in (2006) 3 SCC
242). It may be mentioned here that with regard to Ms. Munita
and Ms. Lalita there is no document or material to show that
they were studying and/or to establish their educational
qualification. Thus dependency (including future prospects) of

FAO NOS. 133/2003, 135/2003 & 136/2003

Page 10

the mother and the brother in the case of Ms. Munita and Ms.
Lalita has to be calculated keeping this aspect in mind. There
is therefore no justification or reason to enhance annual
income in these two cases on the ground of future prospects.
However, even if multiplicand is increased from Rs.7,500/- to
Rs.11,250/- in the case of Mr. Dinesh, the loss of dependency
payable on applying multiplier of 12 will be Rs.1,35,000/-. To
the above figure, if non-pecuniary compensation of Rs.50,000/is added, the total compensation payable in the case of Mr.
Dinesh

will be

Rs.1,85,000/-

which

is

less

than

the

compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- awarded by the Tribunal.
11.

In view of the above, I do not find any merit in these

appeals and the same are dismissed. No Costs.
