Nos. J-9/45, Rajouri Garden, New Delhi-110027, owned by the

3.

This Court, by an order dated 17.1.2002 attached the

property. The judgment debtor entered appearance and sought time
to explore the possibility of amicably resolving the dispute. Later his
wife, Ms.Archana Grover, filed an application, i.e. EA 441/2002,
objecting to the maintainability of the execution proceedings, and
objecting to the attachment. Notice was issued on that application on
1.10.2002.
4.

There was no appearance of either the decree holder or

objector on 6.11.2003.

The entire proceedings was, therefore,

dismissed for non-prosecution.

The decree holder later moved an

application, i.e. EA836/2003. The notice was issued to the judgment
debtor, returnable on 18.3.2004.

The Court restored the execution

proceedings on 18.3.2004, recording as follows:-

The Judgment Debtor was not appearing

the application were dismissed in default.
Accordingly, there is no need to issue notice of
this application of the Judgment Debtor.

application, the petition as well as EA No.

number.
The application stands disposed of.

This Court, by its order dated 27.7.2004, drew the

schedule for proclamation of sale; notice was directed to be published
in the newspapers on 30.8.2004. On 20.9.2004, the auction sale took
place, as scheduled. The property was auctioned for Rs.10,60,000/(Rupees ten lakhs sixty thousand only). 25% of the amount was paid
on the date of auction, i.e. 20.9.2004 and the balance was paid on
1.10.2004. The said amount has been deposited in Court.

dismissed.

However, this Court restored the proceedings by its

subsequent order dated 2.12.2005. The Court also issued notice to
the auction purchaser and judgment debtor, on the same date. The
subsequent proceedings on 2.2.2006, 20.4.2006 show that counsel for
the auction purchaser was present. However, the decree holder had
to take steps for serving the judgment debtor through publication
under Order V Rule 20 CPC.
7.

On subsequent dates of hearing, counsel for the Objector,

Mr.Karunesh Tandon appeared in the proceedings. In the meanwhile,
yet another development took place. The judgment debtor, in spite of
attachment of the property, apparently, transferred it to a third party.
In the circumstances, the Court directed the Objector to be present by
its order dated 5.11.2007. On 15.11.2007, the Court after considering
the materials on record, passed the following order:-

“The objector is not present even today
despite directions.
It seems that she is
willfully avoiding her appearance in the court
despite repeated directions.
Under these
circumstances, the order dated 5th November,
2007 and subsequent order dated 14th
November, 2007 have become operative. The
objections of the objector stands dismissed for
non-prosecution.”
8.

In the above circumstances, learned counsel for the

decree holder urges that this Court independently of its contempt
action against the judgment debtor, should proceed to confirm the

EX.P. 4/2002

sale. Counsel has relied upon the provisions under Order XXI Rule 92
CPC for this purpose.

Learned counsel has relied upon for this

purpose on the judgment reported as HARBANS LAL VS. SMT.

RAM JAWAI DEVI, 16 D.L.T. (1979) 109.

9.

The provisions of Order XXI Rule 92 CPC, reads as

follows:-

“Sale when to become absolute or be set
aside – (1) Where no application is made
under rule 89, rule 90 or rule 91, or where
such application is made and disallowed, the
Court shall make an order confirming the sale,
and thereupon the sale shall become absolute:
[Provided that, where any property is sold in
execution of a decree pending the final
disposal of any claim to, or any objection to
the attachment of, such property, the Court
shall not confirm such sale until the final
disposal of such claim or objection.].
(2) Where such application is made and
allowed, and where, in the case of an
application under rule 89, the deposit
required by that rule is made within [sixty
days] from the date of sale, [or in cases where
the amount deposited under rule 89 is found
to be deficient owing to any clerical or
arithmetical mistake on the part of the
depositor and such deficiency has been made
good within such time as may be fixed by the
Court, the Court shall make an order setting
aside the sale].
Provided that no order shall be made
unless notice of the application has been
given to all persons affected thereby:

[Provided further that the deposit under
this sub-rule may be made within sixty days in
all such cases where the period of thirty days,
within which the deposit had to be made, has
not expired before the commencement of the
Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act,
2002].
(3) No suit to set aside an order made under
this rule shalfl be brought by any person
against whom such order is made.
(4) Where a third

(5) If the suit referred to in sub-rule (4) is
decreed, the Court shall direct the decreeholder to refund the money to the auctionpurchaser, and where such an order is passed
the execution proceeding in which the sale
had been held shall, unless the Court
otherwise directs, be revived at the stage at
which the sale was ordered].”
10.

In the present case, the above narrative would show that

the decree holder sought for execution of the decree dated 13.7.2001
for Rs.35,24,805.51 paise with pendente lite and future interest
@ 18% per annum. This Court, by its order dated 17.1.2002, in the
present case, attached the immovable property of the judgment
debtor.

On no less than two occasions, sale proclamations were

issued. Eventually, sale of the said property took place through Court
ordained auction, on 20.9.2004.
EX.P. 4/2002

The auction purchaser's bid for

Rs.10,60,000/- was accepted, subject to confirmation by this Court.
The judgment debtor has in spite of the service in these proceedings
not appeared nor chosen to object the proceedings.

on her behalf or indeed on behalf of the judgment debtor; no attempt
was made to object to the attachment or the sale.
11.

In HARBANS LAL's case (supra), this Court noticed the

imperative nature of the provision, in particularly, the backdrop of the
amendments introduced by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1906.

By

that amendment, a proviso was introduced to Order XXI Rule 92(1)
CPC.

The Court construed the proviso as an injunction upon the

Courts not to confirm the sale where an attachment is under objection
till such objections are finally disposed of.

This was to avoid

complications on a later date.

12.

A plain textual reading of Order XXI Rule 92(1) CPC would

show that the Court has to confirm the sale in which event, it would
become absolute. The contingencies where the Court is relieved of
such an obligation are firstly where applications under Rule 89 (to set
aside the sale, on deposit of the amount by a person claiming interest
in the property sold); secondly, setting aside the sale on ground of
fraud or irregularity (Rule 90); thirdly, the application by a purchaser
to set aside the sale on account of judgment debtor not having any
saleable interest, such as title (Rule 91) exist.

sale

In the present proceedings, the

order-sheet in this case shows that there are no objections pending.
Therefore, on a textual and plain interpretation of Order 21 Rule 92
CPC, this Court has no choice, but to confirm the sale. This view is
supported by the decision of the Supreme Court in JANAK RAJ VS.

GURDIAL SINGH, AIR 1967 SC 608 and HUKUMCHAND VS.
BANSILAL, AIR 1968 SC 86.
14.

In view of the above discussion, the sale has to be

confirmed. Consequently, the auction sale dated 20.9.2004, is hereby
confirmed, under Order XXI Rule 92(1) CPC.

It is open to the auction purchaser to seek steps for

securing possession of the premises. The decree holder is at liberty to
withdraw the amount lying deposited in the Court.
