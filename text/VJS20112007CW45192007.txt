1.

In this batch of writ petitions the Petitioners are

aggrieved with the failure/refusal of the Respondents to
accept their requests for revocation of the withdrawal of
their

respective

pleas

for

premature

retirement

or

discharge from the Army. This legal conundrum has arisen
before the Court on several occasions. A Division Bench of
this Court had opined in Union of India -vs- Harendralal

Bhattacharya, 1984 (1) SLR 1, a quarter century ago, that a
notice

for

voluntary

retirement

can

be

withdrawn

unilaterally so long as the employee remains in service, but
cannot be allowed after termination of his service. In other
words, a notice for voluntary retirement can be withdrawn
at any time before it becomes effective. In Balram Gupta

-vs- Union of India, MANU/SC/0608/1987 : 1987 Supp SCC
228 the Apex Court was seized of a situation where
WP(C) 4519/2007

Page 2 of 14

voluntary retirement from service had been submitted in
terms of letter dated 24.12.1980. This request, however,
was withdrawn by letter dated 31.1.1981 but nevertheless
the employee was relieved from service by an Order dated
31.3.1981, which also recorded that the withdrawal of the
application

for

voluntary

retirement

“has

also

been

considered and found not suitable”. The Court held that
there was no valid reason for withholding the Petitioner's
request for revocation or withdrawal of the request for
voluntary retirement. More recently, this very question,
once again, came up for consideration before the Supreme
Court of India in Srikantha S.M. -vs- Bharath Earth

Movers Ltd., MANU/SC/2119/2005 : (2005) 8 SCC 314. In
that case, the employee had submitted his resignation on
4.1.1993 and it was accepted on that very date. However,
Casual Leave was granted from 4.1.1993 to 13.1.1993. The
Management informed the employee that he would be
relieved after office hours on 15.1.1993. The employee
withdrew his resignation on 8.1.1993. Their Lordships
referred to Power Finance Corporation Ltd. -vs- Pramod

Kumar Bhatia, MANU/SC/1136/1997 : (1997) 4 SCC 280 :

Since

Srikantha had been granted Casual Leave upto 15.1.1993,
their Lordships held that vinculum juris continued till that
date and the request for withdrawal of voluntary retirement
prior to that date perforce had to be accepted. This
proposition of law is, therefore, very well-entrenched in our
service

jurisprudence. The question that remains to be

determined by us is whether the request for withdrawal of
the application for voluntary or premature retirement had
been made prior to its becoming effective, since acceptance
thereof would not act as a jural severance of the
engagement or contract of personal services.

The Petitioner (Vinay Chauhan) in WP(C) 4519/2007

has filed an application for premature discharge on
compassionate

grounds,

citing

family

problems,

on

15.11.2006, which was “accepted /approved” on 12.1.2007.
The Petitioner was informed by the OIC Records that his
WP(C) 4519/2007

Page 4 of 14

discharge would be carried out under Item-1(I) (b) and
III(iv) of the Table annexed to the Rule 13(3) of the Army
Rules, 1954 ( for short 'Army Rules'). The Petitioner, Vinay
Chauhan, alongwith two Applicants, were ordered to report
to PRTC (Depot Coy) for “Discharge Drill” on 10.6.2007 for
being Struck off Strength(SoS) from the Army with effect
from 30.6.2007. We had sought an explanation from the
Respondents as to why a passage of six months was found
necessary for the Petitioner to be declared SoS. It has been
explained to us that after an application for Discharge had
been accepted by the Commanding Officer (CO) it has
thereafter still to receive the sanction or approval from the
CO under Rule 13(3). One of the factors that are kept in
mind at the second stage is whether the discharge will
adversely or severely affect the strength of the Army. The
consequence is that the date on which a resignation or
request for discharge becomes effective is not the date on
which it receives the sanction or approval from the OC
under Rule 13(3), but the date on which the person
concerned is struck of the Strength of the Army, that is,
SoS. We hold so. The situation is identical to that which had
WP(C) 4519/2007

occurred in Srikantha.

3.

In these circumstances WP(C) 4519/2007 is allowed.

The Petitioner shall be deemed to have continued in
service, notwithstanding his application for discharge from
the Army; he shall be entitled to all consequential reliefs.

5.

On our specific query as to whether there is any proof

of delivery of this letter Mr. Kapur has answered in the
negative.

Instead, he has heavily relied on asseverations

made in the Writ Petition to the effect that “petitioner,
WP(C) 4519/2007

Page 8 of 14

therefore, immediately after his arrival at the Grenadiers
Regimental Centre on 30.5.86, during the staff parade held
on 1.6.1986, withdrew his request for discharge.

The

petitioner was interviewed first by the Adjutant and later by
the Commandant of the Centre during Commandant's staff
parade.

This is a routine parade during which all new

arrivals

and

departures

are

interviewed

by

the

Commandant. At the interview the petitioner made a
request to the Adjutant that he no longer was willing to
seek discharge from the Army Service. The Petitioner was
told by the Adjutant that he may make a written application
in connection with his unwillingness to proceed on
discharge.

The petitioner made an application dated

13.6.86, a translated copy of which is at Annexure P-2,
wherein he expressed his unwillingness to proceed on
discharge. Such application was made by the petitioner
much before his discharge on 25.7.86.....”. Mr. Kapur's
contention is that a specific denial to these statements has
not been made in the Counter Affidavit. It is true that the
rigours of pleadings are applicable to writ petitions, but in
our view not to the same extent as in civil suits. If, on a
WP(C) 4519/2007

Page 9 of 14

holistic reading of the Counter Affidavit, it is evident that
the statements made in the Writ Petition have not been
admitted the Writ Court should not stand on strict legal
formalities.

If the pleadings in the Counter Affidavit

present a sequence of events into which the Petitioners'
version of events cannot be inserted without violating the
other, the Court should infer that a denial has been made.

6.

In the Counter Affidavit it has been asserted that “on

30.5.1986 the petitioner reported
Regimental Centre

for

his

to

The

discharge.

Grenadiers
Thereafter,

petitioner was discharged from service on 25th July 1986
under Army Rule 13 (3) III (iv) ....” Furthermore, that “the
petitioner's averment in para 3 of the writ petition that
despite his discharge he was serving in the Grenadiers
Regiment as a Grenadier is false and misleading”.

Most

importantly, it has been pleaded that “the petitioner sent
an application by Registered AD Post dated 22 July 86 to
The Officer-in-Charge Records for reinstatement .....” which
was received in the Record Office on 16.8.1986. After the
Petitioner had been discharged from service all formalities
WP(C) 4519/2007

Page 10 of 14

required thereof had been completed. It is palpably clear
that the Respondents have not admitted that any oral
request was made by the Petitioner prior to his discharge.

7.

We have reproduced the letter of the Petitioner

admittedly received by the Respondents on 16.8.1986,
which statement has not been denied in the Rejoinder. We
are of the opinion that the letter was actually written in
August, 1986 and was predated by scoring out letter 'Aug'
and overwriting it with '22 Jul'. Since the date of discharge
is not in dispute, and since the Petitioner speaks of failure
to find proper employment thereafter, we conclude that the
letter could not have been written on 22.7.1986. Even more
significantly this letter ought to have mentioned the alleged
verbal requests for withdrawal of the discharge orally on
1.6.1986 and subsequently in writing inter alia through an
application dated 13.6.1986. The documents put forth by
the Petitioner do not commend credence.

8.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner has drawn our

attention to the Orders dated 3.10.2007 allowing WP(C)
WP(C) 4519/2007

Page 11 of 14

No.5037/2000.

However, these Orders are of no avail to

the Petitioner since the facts are totally distinct. A request
for voluntary retirement was contained in the Notice dated
4.2.1999; the request was accepted on 31.3.1999 making it
applicable as per the Petitioner's request with effect from
3.7.1999. The Petitioner had withdrawn the Notice dated
dated 4.2.1999 on 3.4.1999, well before it could have
become effective.

9.

Tampering with documents and deliberately filing

documents that are manufactured is sufficient reason for
dismissal of writ petition. We dismiss the writ petition on
this ground. Even on merits, since the letter dated “Aug
1986”

had

been

written

and/or

received

by

the

Respondents after the Petitioner had been struck of the
Strength of the Army (SoS) since his request for discharge
had become effective, it could not have been acted upon.

been signed by two Witnesses.

The version of the

Petitioner lacks credence. The statutory petition dated

alleged forcible and illegal discharge, praying for the
cancellation of his discharge under Rule 11(2) of the Army

Reliance

is

placed

by

counsel

for

the

Petitioner on Rule 11(2) which states that - “the discharge
of a person, validly sanctioned by a competent authority,
may, with the consent of the discharged person, be
cancelled by any authority superior to the authority who
sanctioned the discharge either without any conditions or
subject to such conditions as such discharged person
accepts.”

This provision does not provide an avenue to

WP(C) 4519/2007

Page 13 of 14

discharged personnel to seek a cancellation of their
discharge on the grounds of a change of heart or mind after
it has attained finality, that is, after he has been declared
SoS. This provision empowers the appropriate authority to
call back to service any discharged personnel, but with his
consent. It is not at the instance of the discharged person
that this Rule can be invoked.

12.

Writ Petition is without merit and is dismissed.
