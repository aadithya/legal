CM Nos. 15280/07 & 179/2008
1.

By this order I propose to dispose of these two

applications filed by the petitioner at different stages of this petition.
With the petition, the petitioner had filed CM No. 15280/2007. There
the following reliefs were sought:
“(a) appropriate orders/ directions directing the
respondent No.1 to relieve the petitioner
forthwith by retaining her lien so as to unable
her to join service in respondent No.3 pending
disposal and subject to the decision of the writ
petition.
(b)
appropriate orders/directions directing
the respondent No.3 to keep open the offer of
appointment for the post of Dy. Director (Audit)
given to the petitioner, pending disposal of the
writ petition.

(c)
pass such other further order (s) as this
Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the
facts and circumstances of the present case
and in the interest of justice.”
Thereafter, on 4.1.2008 CM No.179/2008 came to be filed by the
petitioner. In that application, the following reliefs were sought:
“(a) Issue appropriate orders/ directions
staying the operation on the letter dated
1.1.2008 (Annexure III) issued by the
respondent No.3 and further restrain the
respondent No.3 from offering/ appointing any
other candidate to the post of Dy.Director
(Audit), pending disposal of the writ petition.
(b)
further prepone the date of hearing from
7.4.2007 to some time in the month of January,
2008 itself for hearing and disposal of the case.
(c)
pass such other further order (s) as the
Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the
facts and circumstances of the present case
and in the interest of justice.”
2.

While issuing notice in the second application i.e. CM

No.179/2008, I had directed respondent No.3 to maintain status quo.
The counsel for respondent No.3, National Co-operative Development
Corporation, states that the original offer of appointment issued to
the petitioner makes it clear that in case the petitioner fails to join by
the stipulated date, i.e 15 days from the date of issue of letter
offering

automatically cancelled.

He has drawn my attention to the letter

dated 26.07.2007 issued by his client to the petitioner and in
particular, the contents of paragraph 3 thereof where it clearly states
that “if no reply is received from you or you fail to report for duty by
the prescribed time limit, the offer will be treated as cancelled.”
Thereafter, respondent No.3 cancelled the appointment of the
petitioner by a letter of 1st January, 2008, inter alia, on the ground
that the petitioner has failed to report for duty. Copy of this letter has
WP(C) No.8095/2007

Page 2 of 7

been filed on the record by the petitioner herself along with her
application CM No.179/2008. Counsel for respondent no. 3 further
states that this action of his client had been challenged by the
petitioner in a substantive Writ Petition No. 986/2008.
petition,

the specific prayer of the petitioner was for,

In that
“a writ of

certiorari quashing the action of the respondent, in cancelling the
offer of appointment made to the petitioner, being illegal, arbitrarily,
malafide, unwarranted and irregular and in violation of the rules,
regulations and policies of Constitution of India and consequently the
letter dated 1.01.2008”.

It would appear that in that writ petition,

while challenging the said order of 1.01.2008, the petitioner had also
annexed a copy of the aforesaid order passed by me on 7.01.2008 in
the present petition whereby respondent No.3 was directed to
maintain status quo with regard to the post which was offered to the
petitioner. Ultimately that writ petition was dismissed as withdrawn
on 6.02.2008.
3.

One of the contentions of respondent No.3 is that, in fact,

there is no challenge by the petitioner to its order of 1.1.2008 in this
petition and hence there can be no question of any interim directions
being passed in respect of that order. In this respect, it would be
necessary to note that after my aforesaid order of 7.1.2008 directing
status quo in CM No. 179/2008; the petitioner approached this court
in writ petition No. 986/2008 against the aforesaid impugned order
dated 1.01.2008, cancelling the offer of appointment with a view to
“avoid any technical hitch and difficulty”. There, it was alleged that
the action of respondent No.3 in issuing the order dated 1.01.2008
was illegal and mala fide and amounts to over-reaching the court in
as much as the respondents knew fully well that an application for
WP(C) No.8095/2007

Page 3 of 7

stay being CM No. 15280/2007 was pending before the court in this
writ petition, and yet they cancelled the offer of appointment in
violation of the doctrine of lis pendence.

For that reason, the

petitioner sought quashing of the order dated 1.01.2008 by that writ.
4.

On 6.02.2008, that writ petition, WP (C ) No. 986/2008,

came be to be dismissed as withdrawn. Counsel for respondent No. 3
states that whilst withdrawing Writ Petition No.986/2008, no liberty
was sought, or granted, permitting the petitioner to challenge the
order dated 1.01.2008 in a fresh petition.
5.

It appears to me that the petitioner has taken a

completely obdurate approach in this matter. At the time of its initial
offer, all that respondent No.3 knew was the petitioner possessed the
requisite qualifications and experience for the job and, most
importantly, that the petitioner's application had been duly forwarded
to respondent No.3 for appointment with that organisation on the
post in question. Although admittedly, the said letter stated that no
vigilance case is either pending or contemplated against the
petitioner, it was also clearly stated that in case she gets selected,
she will be relieved as per rules of respondent No.1.

Ultimately,

respondent No.1 has chosen not to relieve her in view of the fact that
a vigilance enquiry has come to be initiated against the petitioner
and a charge sheet is also stated to have been issued to the
petitioner on 5.11.2007, and an enquiry is in progress. In this
connection, the stand of respondent No.1 is that after the petitioner's
application seeking employment was forwarded by it to respondent
No.3 on 19.10.2006; some discrepancy in the petitioner's claim for
medical reimbursement lodged by the petitioner with respondent
No.1 came to light in December 2006. This is what has ultimately
WP(C) No.8095/2007

Page 4 of 7

resulted in the issuance of the charge sheet and the ongoing enquiry
proceedings. It is from the pleadings of the parties in this matter that
respondent No.3 has learnt that in fact some vigilance enquiries are
pending against the petitioner and that her previous employer has
instituted disciplinary proceedings against her. It is not inconceivable
that had respondent No.3 known of these facts before making the
offer of employment to the petitioner, they may not have offered the
appointment at all.
6.

While there is no gainsaying the fact that subject to proof

of the relevant facts; other civil remedies may be available to the
petitioner against the respondent No.1 and 2 including, inter alia, for
the petitioner having lost her chance of employment with respondent
No.3, I am unable to persuade myself to direct respondent No.3 to
keep the post open and unfilled till such time that her dispute with
her current employer is resolved. Even if this writ petition were to be
decided overnight, either party would have the option of filing further
appeals and take the matter right up to the Supreme Court if so
advised. This must necessarily entail considerable loss of time. I do
not think it would be fair to deny respondent No.3; whose position, to
my mind is akin to that of a completely innocent party in this fight
between the petitioner and her employer; the services of an
experienced auditor that it obviously needs. It has put respondent
No.3 in a difficult position where it has to keep this post vacant for an
indefinite period of time and that too only because it had chosen to
offer the post to the petitioner under a given set of circumstances.
7.

As I have stated, there was no certainty that respondent

No.3 would have made this offer to begin with, if it had prior
knowledge of the fact that the petitioner is facing disciplinary

proceedings

and

a

enquiry,

previous

employment. To put it differently, if respondent No.3 were to take
that decision now after full knowledge of all the facts and
circumstances, there is no certainty that the offer of appointment
would be held out. Furthermore, to my mind, respondent No.3 had
merely made an offer of appointment to the petitioner that was valid
up to a specific period.

At the petitioner's request, this offer was

extended for a further period. If the petitioner was unable to join for
any reason within the time granted, I do not see how the petitioner
can compel respondent No.3 to extend its offer any further.
Respondent No.3 is clearly in a position to decline the appointment to
the petitioner on two grounds.

Firstly,

on the ground that the

petitioner has failed to join within the time granted, for the reasons
not attributable to respondent No.3.

Secondly, on the ground that

even if it is assumed that respondent No.3 was obliged to honour its
offer, the same had already expired and was no longer on the table
and in view of the new facts and circumstances that have now come
to the knowledge of respondent No.3, there has been a material
change in the factual circumstances and it does not wish to engage
the service of the petitioner, and therefore there was no question of
renewing that offer or of making any fresh offer. Looking to the
circumstances of this case, in my view, the petitioner has not
demonstrated any unqualified right that might compel respondent no.
3 to engage the petitioner and that too after waiting for an indefinite
period. In addition the fact that even the substantive challenge to the
withdrawal of the offer of respondent no. 3, that was brought by the
petitioner in WP(C) No.986/2008, has been dismissed by the court
cannot be ignored.
WP(C) No.8095/2007

Therefore, prayers of the petitioner for interim

orders against respondent no. 3 in both these applications, are
dismissed. The order of status quo dated 7.01.2008 is also vacated.
8.

With this, CM Nos.15280/07 and 179/2008 are disposed of

CM No.2087/2008.
9.

Mr.Saini, who appears for the petitioner states that he has

received the reply of respondent No.3 only yesterday and that he
wishes to file a rejoinder to the same. Let the same be filed within
two weeks with an advance copy to counsel for the respondent.
W.P.(C) No. 8095/2007
10.

Counsel for the petitioner states that he does not wish to

pursue his challenge against respondent No.2. In view of the matter,
let respondent No.2 be deleted from the array of parties. Petitioner
may file the amended memo of parties within one week from today.
11.

Renotify on 7th April, 2008, the date already fixed.
