judgment?
To be referred to the reporter or not ?
Whether judgment should be reported in Digest ?

1.

ORDER:
Defendant filed IA No. 5621 of 2007 Order 7 Rule 14(3) read with

Section 151 CPC to file additional documents. The defendant filed an
affidavit by way of evidence on 16 th March 2007. Along with the said
affidavit, the defendant filed few more additional documents which it is
contended could not be filed by the defendant at the time of filing written
statement. The second IA being No. 8308 of 2007 for similar relief was
filed.
2.

In IA No. 5621 of 2007, it is stated that the defendant be allowed to

file certificate issued by the statutory auditor showing the sales figures of
the defendant Company i.r.o ZEN iFATS and research and development
expenses for all products, original invoices and documents showing
participation of the defendant in the Exhibitions, documents under which
defendant sent its sub-system for exhibition, e-mails received from
organizers of exhibition showing that the plaintiff and defendant had
participated in the same exhibition, in order to prove that the plaintiff was
very well aware of the defendant's using the trademark. It is submitted
that

the plaintiffs has, for the first time, filed sales, research and

development figures of its own during evidence. The plaintiff's witness has
also relied upon the Annual Report during his cross examination. Hence,
the defendant be allowed to file the above documents to show its
development efforts and amount spent by it. It is further stated that the
plaintiff in the suit claimed damages to the tune of Rs.20 lac but in the
affidavits by way of evidence, it claimed damages to the tune of Rs.75

crore without any basis and, therefore, all above documents were very
much essential to adjudicate upon the issues raised by the parties. The
documents like E-Mails from the organizers of exhibitions, and about the
participation of the plaintiff and defendant in the same exhibition, were
necessary to prove on record the falsity of the plaintiff's witness who
deposed that he became aware of the existence of defendant in middle of
2005. Some of the documents like corrigendum dated 14th January 2002
and 13th

March 2002, office copy of the defendant's bid to a tender,

document under which the defendant sent its sub-systems for exhibition,
letter issued by Ministry of Science and Technology were misplaced by
the defendant when the defendant shifted its premises in 2005. These
documents were now found while searching for some other files. The
letter dated 12th March, issued by the plaintiff's representative to
defendant is intended to show that the plaintiff company was aware of
defendants product ZEN iFATS since 2001 but since the plaintiffs witness
has denied the knowledge of defendant's company till middle of 2005,
filing of this letter is necessary.
3.

In IA No. 8308 of 2007, the defendant wants to bring on record

additional documents filed by it with the affidavit of witnesses by way of
evidence.

It

is

stated

that

the

defendant

incidentally

met

the

representative of M/s Logical Solutions Limited, Hyderabad on 30th March
2007 and was told that the said concern had sought clarification of
tenders issued by the Government of India pursuant to which corrigendum
dated 14th January 2002 and 13th March 2002 were issued. On this,
defendant's company requested M/s Logical Solutions to supply the copies
of the correspondence in this regard. The M/s Logical Solutions asked for
the documents under the Right to Information Act. These documents were
received on 15th July by the defendant's company from M/s Logical
Solutions. These documents show that government tenders, issued on 25 th
May 2000/17th June 2001/5th December 2001, were global tenders for all
manufacturers manufacturing the Firearms Training Systems (FATS).
These documents were necessary to show that FATs was a generic term
I.A.Nos.5621/2007&8308/2007 in CS(OS) No.1472/2005

and was being used by the Government as well as by other manufacturers
and production of these documents was necessary to throw light on the
falsity of the plaintiff's claim in the suit.
4.

The applications are supported by affidavits. No reply to these

application has been filed by the plaintiff, however, applications were
opposed during arguments.
5.

Under Order 7 Rule 14(3) CPC, documents can be filed by a party,

with the leave of the Court,

if a reasonable explanation and ground is

given by the party showing its inability in filing documents earlier at right
stage. In the present case, defendant claimed that the plaintiff though in
the plaint claimed damages of only Rs.20 lac, but in the affidavit of
evidence, he claimed damages to the tune of Rs.75 crore and, therefore,
the defendant felt it necessary to file all its sales figures and other
documents to prove that plaintiff was not entitled to damages and was in
the knowledge of user of this trademark by the defendant and others.
6.

It is settled law that a party cannot travel beyond its pleadings in

evidence. If the plaintiff had restricted its claim of damages in the suit
only to Rs.20 lac. Even if the damages suffered by the plaintiff were in
crores, the plaintiff cannot be granted damages for more than Rs.20 lac.
Filing of affidavit in evidence by plaintiff witness is no ground to allow
additional documents. The other ground taken is that the plaintiff's
witness relied upon the annual report which was not part of the
documents of plaintiff in order to prove its sale figures and other figures
and due to these reasons defendant has to file these documents.
7.

I consider that the defendant, in any event, had to prove that it was

using the trademark since long time. The defendant was supposed to file
all the documents showing his user along with written statement. The
defendant was also supposed to prove that the plaintiff was in the
knowledge of use of the trademark by the defendant, since the
acquiescence is one of the defence available under the Trademarks Act.
The plaintiff in this suit claimed that it spent huge amounts on Trademark
and promotion. The defendant in response was supposed to file
I.A.Nos.5621/2007&8308/2007 in CS(OS) No.1472/2005

Page No.3 of 4

documents in respect of its sale, promotion and advertisement expenses.
The defendant cannot take the plea that these documents were to be filed
by the defendant only after the plaintiff proved its sale figures and figures
of promotion of the market or on advertisement. Similarly, the plea taken
by defendant that the documents were misplaced because of shifting of
office, is not tenable, more so when the defendant has not even disclosed
where its earlier office was situated and where it was shifted. It is quite
unbelievable that in any private sector company, the documents can be
misplaced or become untraceable in the manner described by the
defendant. The plea raised by the defendant seems to unbelievable on
the face of it.
8.

It is mandatory for parties to file all documents along with their

pleadings so that both parties know about each others case. A party,
during evidence, cannot be allowed to file additional documents unless it
shows that these documents were not within its control. None of the
documents stated by the defendant are those which were not within the
control of the defendant neither the documents are those which were not
relevant for the purpose of deciding the issues from the point of view of
the defendant, as is seen from the pleadings of the parties.
9.

I consider that except the document which the defendant got from

M/s Logical Solutions Limited, no other document can be allowed to be
placed on record.
10.

Accordingly, IA No. 8308/2007 is allowed and IA No. 5621/2007 is

hereby dismissed. The documents

which the defendant got from M/s

Logical Solutions Limited, if filed, be taken on record.
11.

Both the applications stand disposed of.

CS(OS) No.1472/2005
List this suit before the Joint Registrar for admission/denial of
additional documents, if any, on 20 th March, 2008 and before the Court on
6th May, 2008.
