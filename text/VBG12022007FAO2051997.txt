V.B. GUPTA, J.
Appellant has

filed

the

present

appeal

seeking

enhancement of amount of compensation to Rs.50,000/- as
prayed for in the claim petition.
2.

Appellant's case is that on 23rd May, 1984 he boarded

bus

No.UTF-2489

belonging

to

U.P.Road

Transport

Corporation from Haldwani for Delhi. At about 9.00 p.m.
FAO No.205/1997

Page 2 of 8

when the bus was three kilometers away from Haldwani
Bus Stand, a truck No.UTF-7836 came from opposite side
at a very fast speed and struck against the right side of the
bus, as a result of which some persons received injuries
and one of them died. The appellant also received injuries
in this road accident. The bus was also being driven at a
very fast speed and does not appear to be under control of
the bus driver. The bus was being driven by respondent
No.1 while respondent No.2 is the owner of the bus
whereas,

respondent

No.3

is

the

truck

driver

and

respondent No.4 is its owner and it is insured with
respondent No.5.
3.

The appellant suffered permanent disfigurement of

his hand and also suffered permanent disablement and for
a period of two months he was confined to bed and had to
engage private nurse and compounder to attend him. The
appellant claimed Rs.50,000/- as compensation on account
of injuries suffered by him in the accident and stated that
details of the amount under various heads shall be
furnished with proof subsequently. It may be pointed out
that no such proof was furnished by the appellant
FAO No.205/1997

Page 3 of 8

subsequent to the filing of the petition.
4.

Vide impugned judgement dated 1st March, 1997

Sh.R.K.Gauba, Judge, Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal,
Delhi, passed an award of

Rs.23,500/- in favour of the

appellant and against respondents 3 to 5.
5.

Being

dissatisfied

with

the

quantum

of

the

compensation, appellant has come in appeal before this
Court.
6.

Appellant had impleaded the driver and owner of bus

also but later on his counsel gave a statement that he does
not want to proceed against them and their names be
deleted from array of respondents. Vide order dated 23rd
September, 1998, names of respondents 1 & 2 were
deleted from the array of the respondents.
7.

Appellant had impleaded

the Presiding Officer of

Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal as respondent No.6. Since
he was an unnecessary party, vide order dated 18th
November, 1997 passed by this Court, name of respondent
No.6 was also deleted from the array of the parties.
8.

On 2nd February, 2007, none was present and matter

was adjourned for 7th February, 2007. On 7th February,
FAO No.205/1997

Page 4 of 8

2007 again none was present for the appellant whereas,
counsel for the respondent No.5/Insurance Company was
present and matter was listed for 8th February, 2007.
9.

On 8th February, 2007 again none was present for the

appellant

while counsel for respondent No.5/Insurance

Company was present and as such arguments were heard.
10.

The grounds on which enhancement of compensation

has been sought are that the learned Tribunal awarded
much less amount of compensation for the loss of future
prospects and ignored the fact that the accident has
resulted in

permanent disfigurement of the appellant's

hand.
11.

Regarding the accident, the learned Tribunal has

given its finding that the accident took place while the bus
was moving on the correct side of the road within
controlable speed and the accident occurred on account of
the truck driver having come from opposite direction
fast speed,

in

as a result of which, apparently truck driver

lost control over the vehicle which went into the wrong
lane and, thus, the accident was caused solely due to rash
and negligent driving on the part of the truck driver. I do
FAO No.205/1997

Page 5 of 8

not find any ground to disagree with this finding of the fact
given by the learned Tribunal.
12.

Regarding quantum of compensation awarded by the

learned Tribunal, the appellant in his petition stated that he
would furnish details of the amounts claimed by him under
various heads with proof subsequently. No such proof has
been submitted. Appellant was 24 years of age at the time
of accident and his monthly salary was Rs.750/-.

In his

statement he stated that the injuries sustained by him were
on his head and fracture in the right hand.

The MLC

Ex.PW-2/2 only confirms lacerated wounds and abrasions
on his right hand. It does not corroborate the claim about
injuries on any other part of his body. As per finding of the
learned Tribunal, an X-ray was advised, though there is no
report confirming that the injuries resulted in any fracture.
Appellant produced disability certificate Ex.PW-5/1 before
the learned Tribunal.

It was observed by the learned

Tribunal that this certificate confirms that the injuries in
appellant's

right

hand

have

resulted

in

Traumatic

permanent stiffness in the right index finger and numbness
in other

four fingers resulting in loss of functioning,

FAO No.205/1997

Page 6 of 8

assessed up to 10%.

The Tribunal also held that the

disability has not affected the career of the appellant and
he continues to be in the same service, without any loss of
earning, but since, it resulted in loss of amenities of life, so
it must be compensated. Since the appellant was treated
in the hospital for about 2 months, as such he was awarded
compensation of Rs.1,500/- on account of loss of earning for
two months.
13.

The appellant did not produce any bill or prescription

relating to his medical treatment but since he must have
incurred some amount, the learned Tribunal awarded
Rs.2,000/- on this account. Keeping in view the nature of
permanent disability, compensation of Rs.10,000/- for loss
of future prospects were awarded

and besides general

damages, for pain & sufferings amounting to Rs.10,000/was awarded.

The Tribunal, thus, awarded Rs.23,500/-

being just compensation to the appellant.
14.

In view of the injuries sustained by the appellant and

the fact that he was confined to bed for two months and has
been fully compensated for loss of earning and also duly
compensated
FAO No.205/1997

for

medical

expenses,

loss

of

future

Page 7 of 8

prospects, pain & sufferings. So, it cannot be said that the
compensation awarded by the learned Tribunal is not just.
No ground for enhancement of compensation is made out.
The compensation awarded by the learned Tribunal is just
and reasonable and no flaw can be found in the award.
Accordingly, the present appeal is not maintainable and the
same is, hereby, dismissed. No order as to costs.
