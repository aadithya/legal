1.

This is an application filed by the defendant for

modification/variation of the order dated 10th January, 2006
whereby ex-parte ad-interim injunction order was passed
against the defendant restraining him, his servants, agents
etc. from parting with possession and selling or alienating the

suit property bearing No. E-22, New Delhi South Extension
Part-II Market, New Delhi in favour of any other person
except the plaintiff or creating any third party interest and
also directing the Central Bank of India to handover the
possession of the said property to the plaintiff.

2.

Defendant seeks modification of this order on the plea

that on one floor of the premises M/s. Mehrasons Jewelers
are running their business vide Agency agreement dated 27th
June, 2006 entered into with the defendant and the defendant
is working as an agent. However, he is not satisfied with the
income which he is deriving as an agent and wants to let out
other two floors lying vacant to different tenants with an
undertaking that the tenant shall vacate the premises in case
any adverse order is passed by the court against the
defendant.

3.

This application is contested by the plaintiff. In para 3

of the reply, the plaintiff alleged that defendant has not
disclosed the names and addresses of the proposed tenants
and the market rate of rent per sq. ft. which he is likely to
charge from the proposed tenants, period of proposed Lease
and proposed area to be let out floor wise and other
important terms and conditions of the Lease.

IA No.6305/07 in CS(OS) No.39/2006

According to

Page 2 of 5

the plaintiff these omissions are deliberate and therefore the
application deserves dismissal.

4.

Defendant accordingly filed an affidavit giving four

names of different companies with whom he is negotiating or
intends to negotiate to let out the said two floor of the
property. This affidavit is also controverted by the plaintiff.
It is pointed out that at this stage, the plaintiff has no right to
know about the proposed area to be leased out, consideration
of rent, etc. and purpose of lease, duration of lease and how
the vacant possession of the suit property shall be handed
over to the proposed tenants as one floor of the property is in
possession of M/s. Mehrasons Jewelers.

5.

Present suit has been filed by the plaintiff for specific

performance of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated
14th

December,

Rs.50,00,000/-

2004.

The

plaintiff

paid

a

sum

of

in pursuance of the said MOU and the

property was to be sold for a total consideration of
Rs.17,25,00,000/-.

Admittedly, the defendant has not been

put in possession of the suit property and the possession of
the same still remains with the plaintiff. The property is
situated in a prime locality of South Delhi and one of the
floors is already being used for commercial purposes by M/s.

Mehrasons Jewelers. Defendant therefore is suffering loss in
terms of the rent as two floors are lying vacant. Income as
disclosed from the Agency Agreement with M/s.Mehrasons
Jewelers in the application clearly indicates that defendant is
not getting adequate return of the property because of the
pendency of the present suit. Under these circumstances, the
plaintiff will not suffer any irreparable loss if the order dated
10th January, 2006 is modified.

6.

Accordingly, ex-parte ad-interim injunction order dated

10th January, 2006 granted to the plaintiff is modified in the
following terms :-

(i)

Defendant is allowed to deal with the property by

leasing it out to any of the tenants as named in the affidavit
dated 22nd October, 2007 for a fixed period of two years by
way of a registered Lease Deed. (As the case is at its initial
stage and no evidence has so far been recorded).

(ii)

Defendant shall ensure that the Lease Deed contains a

clause to the fact that tenant so inducted in the premises
shall be bound by the outcome of the present suit or any
other order which may be passed by the court during the
pendency of the suit

and that tenant shall not claim any

equity.

(iii)

Defendant shall place on record certified copy of the

Lease Deed so executed within 30 days from its execution
alongwith his affidavit as well of the tenant to the fact that he
shall vacate the premises when ordered by the court and
shall be bound by the final out come of the present suit and
also he shall not have any right of equity, claim or interest in
the property (2000 VII AD (DELHI) 1032, “Misha Vadera
& Anr. Vs. Ravi Kumar & Ors” referred to).

(iv)

Defendant shall also give an undertaking that he shall

get the premises immediately vacated subject to the final
decision in this case and shall also adhere to the order of this
court dated 31st August, 2007.

7.
