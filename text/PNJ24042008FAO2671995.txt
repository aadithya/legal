PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Since the consignment was booked on “said to

contain basis”, the Railway Claims Tribunal, vide its order
dated 10.7.1995 has dismissed a claim petition filed by the
appellant registered as TAI.No.578/90.
2.

The Tribunal has noted that the original wagon

when received at the yard of destination for inspection showed
that the seals were intact. It has thus been held that the
FAO No.267/1995

Page No.1 of 7

railway authorities were not liable to recompense any money
to the appellant.
3.

On 29.11.1983 appellant admittedly consigned soap

stone powder for delivery from Rana Pratap Nagar Station to
Delhi Lahori Gate.

To evidence the carriage railway receipt

No.207888 was issued.
4.

The railway receipt recorded loading of 378 bags of

soap stone powder each weighing 50 kg.

But at the place of

destination 189 bags of 1 qtl. each were offered for delivery.
5.

Rejecting the claim, Tribunal has noted as under :“Thus though, the original wagon was received with
seals intact, the respondent did try to see whether
the consignment received was pertaining to some
other party.
All these facts clearly show that the
consignment of 189 bags each weighing 1 quintal
received in the original wagon No.NFC 15782 with
seals intact was the consignment loaded by the party
in the wagon.”

6.

Just before recording the afore-noted finding, the

learned Tribunal has noted as under :“Since the applicant refused to take delivery of the
consignment, the consignment was sent to
Ambavadi, because, on a search some cloth slips
stitched to the bags were found and on these slips,
the name of West Coast Paper Mills, Dandali Dist. was
found. The consignment remained unconnected at
Ambavadi
and was rebooked to the original
destination station, namely Delhi Lahori Gate.”
7.

A perusal of the order passed by the Tribunal shows

that two facts have weighed with the Tribunal. Firstly, that
FAO No.267/1995

Page No.2 of 7

the goods were consigned for delivery on “said to contain”
basis i.e. loading of the goods was not witnessed by railway
officers.

Secondly, that the seals were intact when the

consignment reached the yard of destination.

Though not

stated in so many words, the conclusion drawn by the Tribunal
is premised on the fact that no tampering was found with the
wagon during transit and hence

what was received at the

yard of destination was what was loaded in the wagon at the
station of commencement of journey.
8.

Shri M.L.Bhargava, learned counsel for the appellant

urged that the Tribunal erred in not appreciating the testimony
of DW-3, the witness of the railway authorities

who was

working as a Commercial Clerk at the relevant time. Counsel
urged that testimony of DW-3 clearly established that another
consignor M/s Vijay Minerals had also delivered 210 bags of
soap stone powder meant for West Coast Paper Mills vide
RR.No.207889 and that it was obvious that the railway
authorities had delivered the consignment of the appellant to
the consignee under RR.No.207889 and goods consigned vide
RR.No.207889 were offered to the appellant.
9.

There is prima facie merit in the submission made

by Shri M.L.Bhargava, learned counsel for the appellant.
10.

As noted herein above, the Tribunal has noted that

FAO No.267/1995

Page No.3 of 7

on the bags containing soap stone powder which were offered
for delivery to the appellant the name of West Coast Paper
Mills, written on a slip, was found stitched to the bags.

The

Tribunal ought to have probed the matter a little further and
had this been done, through the testimony of DW-3, it would
have dawned on the Tribunal

that M/s Vijay Minerals vide

RR.No.207889 had consigned soap stone powder

to West

Coast Paper Mills.
11.

In

Ex.DW-3/1.

his testimony, DW-3 proved RR.No.207889 as
The said document Ex.DW-3/1 shows that M/s

Vijay Minerals had entrusted 189 bags of soap stone powder
weighing 189 tons. The consignee was West Coast Paper Mills.
It is obvious that said 189 bags were offered for delivery to the
appellant and since they were not the consignment of the
appellant, the appellant rightly refused to take delivery.
12.

The fact that the seals of the wagon were not

tampered with, therefore, becomes irrelevant.

It is a case

where goods were mixed up.
13.

Let me also clarify the position with respect to the

legal import of a consignment being booked under “said to
contain” railway receipt.
14.

In my decision dated 31.1.2008 in FAO.No.212/1995

M/s Ram Kanwar Ram Niwas Vs. Union of India, in paras 36 to
FAO No.267/1995

Page No.4 of 7

39, I had noted as under :36.
In the decision reported as Union of India
v Roop Narayan & Ors (1997)1 WLN 339 the core
question which had arisen for consideration was
whether
consignment booked under a "said to
contain" railway receipt, amounts to admission on
the part of the railway administration, that the said
number of articles had in fact were loaded.
37.
In said regards the learned court noted the
provisions of Rule 1513 of the Indian Commercial
Railways Manual which reads as under:"The outward tally book is an important
and initial record of the actual loading of
consignments and is likely to be referred
when responsibility has to be fixed in the
event of any package found missing at
repacking and trans shipping points or at
destination station".
38.
After noting the afore-noted rule and
other relevant provisions the learned court summed
up as under:“Upshot of the above discussion is, that if
the railway receipt contains the "said to
contain" remark, it does not amount to
admission on the part of the Railway
Administration that the said number of
articles had in fact been loaded. But when
responsibility has to be fixed in the event
of any package found, missing at
destination station, then examination of
"outward tally book" and "Forwarding
Note" is necessary. The learned Tribunal
by a majority judgment, has rightly
allowed the applications. In view of this, all
the arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for the appellants, devoid of any
force.”
39.
FAO No.267/1995

Thus from the afore-noted discussion it is
Page No.5 of 7

clear that when consignment is booked on “said to
contain” basis the railways is not exonerated from
its liability to pay compensation in respect of short
delivery of loaded goods. The only effect of the
endorsement “said to contain” is that the onus to
prove
that
the
quantity
as
claimed
by
consignor/consignee was actually loaded is on the
consignor/consignee.
15.

In the impugned order the Tribunal has noted an

entry recorded in the loading tally book as follows :
“No. 19. 24/11, NF 15782 CL”
16.

The Tribunal failed to note Rule 1513 of the Indian

Commercial Railways Manual which has been noted in para 37
of the decision in M/s Ram Kanwar Ram Niwas (supra).
17.

Looked at from any angle it is obviously a case

where the Tribunal has ignored material evidence i.e. Ex.DW3/1 as also the testimony of DW-3, a witness of the railway
authorities.
18.

The testimony of DW-3, Ex.DW-3/1 and the railway

receipt of the appellant clearly establishes that 189 soap stone
powder bags were booked by M/s Vijay Minerals for delivery to
M/s West Coast Paper Mills named as the consignee and that
the appellant had booked 378 bags of soap stone powder.
Whereas each bag of the appellant weighed 50 kg., the bags
consigned by M/s Vijay Minerals weighed 100 kg. each.

The

evidence

the

on

FAO No.267/1995

record

conclusively

establishes

that

Page No.6 of 7

appellant's consignment was delivered to West Coast Paper
Mills and the

consignment

meant to be delivered to West

Coast Paper Mills was offered to the appellant. The appellant
was fully justified in declining delivery of the consignment.
19.

The appeal is allowed.

Impugned order dated

10.7.1995 passed by the Tribunal is set aside. Claim petition
filed by the appellant is allowed. The appellant is held entitled
to receive from the railway authorities a sum of Rs.23000/- (Rs.
Twenty Three Thousand) being the value of the consignment
plus cost as also interest @ 6% per annum w.e.f. 15.12.1986
when the suit was filed till date of receipt of payment.
20.

Before concluding I may note that initially a suit was

filed and with the constitution of Railway Claims Tribunal the
said suit was transferred to the Railway Claims Tribunal for
decision.
21.

The appellant is also held entitled to costs in the

instant appeal in sum of Rs.2,000/-.
22.

TCR be returned.
