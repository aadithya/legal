In

this

writ

petition

the

petitioner

has

called in question his discharge from the Army service
w.e.f.

31.08.2005

and

also

the

impugned

order

rejecting his request for reconsideration of his case
for promotion to the rank of Naib Subedar. He has also
prayed for directions to the respondents to treat him
as

continuing

in

service

from

the

date

he

was

superannuated i.e. 31.08.2005 till the actual date he
is taken back in service by the respondents.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties
and have also carefully perused the record of this
case.
Appearing for the petitioner Mr. Kauntae had
argued

that

the

petitioner

was

fully

eligible

for

promotion to the next higher rank of Naib Subedar
during the extended period of his service in view of
para

of

WP (C) no. 90/2007

the

Army

Headquarter

letter

dated

14.10.1998 (Annexure P-2). Learned counsel had further
argued

that

of

the

respondents

had

Government

ignored

dated

03.09.1998

the
by

which the Army personnel were granted extension of two
years in service beyond their normal limit of service.
The contention of the petitioner's learned counsel was
that the petitioner was wrongly denied promotion on
the ground of his over age having crossed 44 years of
age by ignoring the Government's Notification and the
letter of the Army Headquarter referred to above. Mr.
Kauntae had also submitted that the Commanding Officer
of the petitioner had himself vide his D.O. letter
dated 21.12.2003 recommended his case for promotion to
the next higher rank of Naib Subedar to the concerned
authorities

of

the

respondents.

In

this

regard

he

placed reliance on Annexure P-4 to the writ petition.
We have carefully considered all these submissions and
contentions made on behalf of the petitioner but we
have not been able to persuade ourselves to agree with
any of these submissions.

on

of

the

page 4 of 8

impugned order dated 20.11.2006 referred above that
the petitioner was duly considered for promotion to
the next higher rank of Naib Subedar by the DPC held
on 29.06.2004 but he was not granted promotion to the
rank of JCO (Naib Subedar) in terms of para 149 (a)
and (b) of Regulation for the Army 1987 as amended
vide para 2 (c) of the Government of India, Ministry
of Defence letter NO. F.14(3)/98/D(AG) dated 04th March
1999. The provisions of Regulation 149 (a) (b) and (C)
of Regulation for the Army 1987 are relevant and are
reproduced hereinbelow:“149. Promotions-JCOs- (a) NCOs except

The petitioner was working as a Driver and
was holding the rank of Hawaldar on the date he was
considered by the DPC for his promotion to the next
higher rank of Naib Subedar. Admittedly on that date
he was over 44 years of age. The rank he was holding
on the date he was considered for promotion did not
fall in any of the Sub-Clause (i) to (v) of Clause (b)
of the Regulation 149 referred above. The Regulation
that was applicable to the petitioner was Regulation
149

(a)

according

to

which

he

was

entitled

for

promotion to the rank of JCO if he was not over 40
years of age or with less than 22 years of service.

The

counsel

contention

that

in

of

view

of

the
the

Policy of the Government contained in Para-9 of the
letter of the Army Headquarter dated 14.10.1998, the
petitioner could have been considered for promotion
even during extended period of his service, is of no
consequence since the DPC which considered the case of
the petitioner for promotion was admittedly held on
29.06.2004 during the extended period of service of
the petitioner.
In the facts and circumstances of the case,
we are of the considered view that the respondents
were fully justified in rejecting the case of the
petitioner for promotion to the next higher rank of
Naib Subedar. There is no merit in the challenge made
by the petitioner in this writ petition.

In the result, this writ petition fails and
