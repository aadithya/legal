1.

The petitioner has filed objections (IA No.352/2001) in respect of

the award dated 28.04.2000 made by the sole arbitrator (Mr D.R. Gupta, Chief
Manager

Information

Technology,

Rail

Coach

Factory,

Kapurthala).

Objections have also been filed on behalf of the respondent (Railways) being
IA.No. 355/2001.

The petitioner was only aggrieved with regard to the

rejection of its claims towards interest. However, Mr Shiv Khorana, who
appears on behalf of the petitioner, now states that he is ready and willing to
give up this objection.

CS(OS) 1999A/2000

The only question, therefore, that survives for

Page No.1 of 6

consideration are the objections of the respondent as contained in IA 353/2001.
On 24.03.2005, the following issues were framed :
“1. Whether the impugned award dated 28.04.2000 is liable to be
set aside or modified on the grounds raised in the objections?
2.
2.

Relief.”
In order to decide the said issues, it would be necessary to narrate

the sequence of events leading to the making of the award. On 26.08.1993 the
respondent placed an order on the petitioner for supply of 85,377 ltrs of paint at
the price of Rs 34.22 p per liter. According to the purchase order, the petitioner
was to supply 18000 ltrs. per month and to complete the entire supply by
31.3.1994. On 17.11.1993 the respondent sought to change the delivery period
by issuing a letter of that date. According to the letter dated 17.11.1993 the
delivery schedule was to be altered so as to ensure supplies of 35,377 ltrs of
paint by 31.3.1994 and the balance 50,000 ltrs of paint by 30.6.1994. However,
the petitioner did not agree to this change in the delivery schedule and,
therefore, the original schedule was maintained.

3.

On 14.12.1993, 6000 ltrs of paint was supplied and by 31.3.1994

the petitioner had supplied a total quantity of 55,200 ltrs of paint.

On

15.4.1994 a letter was written by the respondent to the petitioner not to make
any further supplies. Subsequently, the respondent changed its mind and on
22.4.1994 issued a letter to the petitioner requiring it to supply the remaining

CS(OS) 1999A/2000

Page No.2 of 6

quantity of approximately 30,000 lts of paint in 5 equal installments of 6000 ltrs
each month commencing from June and ending in November, 1994.

On

27.4.1994, the respondent sought to reduce the price of the paint.

The

petitioner did not agree to this. Thereafter, the respondent also withdrew its
request for reducing the price and permitted the petitioner to supply further
quantities. On 4.6.1994, 12000 ltrs of paint were supplied by the petitioner to
the respondent which they ultimately accepted in July 1994. However, 18000
ltrs of paint which were also sent along with the same supply were returned by
the respondent. In September, 1994 the respondent indicated to the petitioner
that they were now willing to accept 18,000 ltrs of paint, provided the same was
delivered by 31.3.1995. However, the petitioner did not accept this request and
submitted its claim for arbitration.

4.

The claims were under six heads. Insofar as the claim Nos 1 and 2

are concerned, they are related. Claim No.1 was to the following effect : - who
shall bear the cost of 3 trucks of material which reached RCF on 12.6.1994
and were returned and claim No.2 was as under :- who shall bear the both way
freight and related charges for above 3 trucks. Claim No. 3 was rejected so
was claim Nos 4 and 5. Insofar as claim No.6 was concerned that was with
regard to interest at the rate of 23% per annum. The same was limited to only
12 % per annum and that, too, if the payment was not made within three
months.

Anyhow, the objection which the petitioner had with respect to

CS(OS) 1999A/2000

Page No.3 of 6

interest has been given up. So, in this petition, we are only concerned with the
findings of the arbitrator insofar as claim Nos 1 and 2 are concerned. The said
two claims had been discussed by the learned arbitrator in the award in the
following manner :“Claim No.1
Who shall bear the cost of 3 trucks of material which reaches
RCF on 12.6.94 and were returned.
This claim is to be viewed in terms of the various
correspondence and breaches as claimed by the claimant and
denied by the respondent. The action of the respondent
restricting the delivery to 35,377 ltr upto 31.3.94 and balance
50,000 lt. upto 30.6.94 vide their letter dtd 17.11.93 totally
negates the stipulation of 18,000 lts./month with delivery to
commence after 45 days of the date of placement of purchase
order.
The unilateral amendment issued on 27.4.94 reducing the qty.
from 85,377 ltr. to 59,764 ltr and reduction in rate is also
against the contractual law as invoking the clause of 30%
reduction in quantity on total ordered quantity is bad in law
as 55,200 ltr. were already supplied to the consignee before
March '94 and accepted by them. It is significant to note here
that DCOS/RCF/KXH had over-stepped his jurisdiction (C-7
& C-8) in advising the firm not to dispatch the material in the
month of April '94 and then laying down the delivery
schedule totally different from what was given by the
Purchase office. The balance quantity was also lying ready
duly inspected with the claimant and was dispatched within
the delivery period of 30.6.94 as fixed by the respondent vide
their letter dtd 17.11.93. It is also to be noted that the
consignee had overstepped his jurisdiction in accepting the
quantity unto 67200 liters against amended quantity of 59764
liters.
The respondent's subsequent action vide their
amendment dated 7.9.94 enhancing quantity to 67,200 liters
and simultaneously indicating that the delivery schedule of
38,000 liters unto Nov '93 was not adhered to is also
incorrect as by their earlier amendment dated 17 Nov '93 they
CS(OS) 1999A/2000

Page No.4 of 6

had asked for only 35,377 liters unto March '94 but had
already accepted 55,000 liters. The net impact of this
amendment was that the quantity was restored to 67,200 liters
which was already accepted by the consignee.
The
respondent's further action in reinstating the contract vide
their letter dtd 31.1.95 was also meaningless as by that time
the claimant had asked for appointment of the arbitrator to
resolve the dispute as the contract had become null and void.
It was contended on behalf of the respondent that the
company could have supplied the material after amendment
dated 31.1.95. I do not find much force in this argument as
the material was manufactured in February 1994, cleared after
inspection in March 1994 and was returned back by the
respondent for no technical fault. In my view the chances of
the material getting rejected on account of keeping properties
as specified in item xii of table I of IS 2074-1992 were quite
high due to transit time involved, acceptance of material etc.
This contingency for which very high probability exist would
in any case have led to a dispute besides the liability on
account of freight from Lucknow to Kapurthala about which
no mention was made in the amendment order dated 31.1.95.
In view of the foregoing discussion the claim of the claimant
of Rs.6,47,716.00 as cost of material is allowed.
Claim No.2
Who shall bear the both way freight and related charges for
above 3 trucks.
This claim essentially flows from reference 1 – who will bear
the cost of the material? As already brought out in claim
No.1, as the action of the respondent was illegal in returning
the trucks within the delivery period specified by them, the
cost of the freight charges have to be borne by the respondent
only. Total amount payable on this account will be
Rs.51000/- [ Rs.9000x3 =27000+Rs.7000x3 (ex. Kapurthala
to Lucknow) as mentioned in goods receipts + Rs.1000x3 =
3000 for halting charges for 3 days.)]”
5.

Reading the discussion and the conclusion arrived at by the learned

CS(OS) 1999A/2000

Page No.5 of 6

Arbitrator, I do not see any reason as to why the award should be interfered
with. The petitioner had supplied 18000 ltrs of paint in June 1994 itself after
the respondent had permitted the petitioner to supply the same. The fact that
the same were returned as also the fact that the paint had a limited shelf life
meant that the petitioner incurred a loss and the arbitrator has only compensated
the petitioner for the same. I see no reason to interfere with the award. The
objections filed on behalf of the respondent are dismissed. The award is made
a rule of the court with future interest at the rate of 8% per annum. A decree be
drawn up accordingly. The award shall form part of the decree.
