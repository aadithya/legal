BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.

Both the claimant (J & S Construction) and the respondent /

counter-claimant [National Small Industries Corporation Limited] (NSIC) have
filed objections in respect of the impugned award dated 24.06.1992 made by
the sole Arbitrator. The claimant had responded to a notice inviting tender with
respect to construction of an Industrial Marketing Development Centre at NSIC
Complex, Okhla New Delhi.

The claimant had submitted its tender on

02.12.1988. Thereafter, the prices of steel had risen sharply. On 31.03.1988,
the claimant sent a letter to the respondent requesting them to consider the

CS(OS) No.2664A/92 & IA Nos.3133/93 & 9259/93

Page No.1 of 5

question of increase in the prices of steel and thereby to provide for escalation.
It may be pointed out that the tender by itself did not provide for escalation as it
was a fixed rate contract. A Letter of Intent was issued by the respondent to the
claimant on 05.05.1989 which was accepted by the claimant on 16.05.1989
without any objection. The claimant had also commenced work on the basis of
the Letter of Intent. A work order was later issued by the respondent on
18.08.1989. The same was accepted by the claimant on 15.09.1989, but a
condition was attached to the said acceptance. The exact words being:“Work order accepted except for clause 1, the escalation will
be provided as per CPWD clause 10 (c) (c)”.
2.

The major dispute is with regard to the question as to whether the

contract between the parties provided for escalation or not ? It is the contention
of the learned counsel for the claimant even before this court that the
respondent had agreed to give an overall increase of 12.5% as was even
admitted in cross-examination by the respondent's witness [Sh. T.S. Bhagat,
General Manager]. According to the learned counsel for the claimant, the said
witness had accepted that in a meeting held on 25.05.1990, the respondent had
agreed to give an increase of 12.5%. On the basis of this, the learned counsel
for the claimant submits that the Arbitrator has gone wrong by not awarding the
escalation of 12.5% even though the position had been admitted by the
respondent. This aspect of the matter has been considered by the learned
Arbitrator in the following manner:-

CS(OS) No.2664A/92 & IA Nos.3133/93 & 9259/93

Page No.2 of 5

“The claimant through his letter No. US/WD/HO/650/89
dated 15.9.89 asked for escalation in building materials
and labour. Respondent contested this claim through his
letter dated 29.9.89. The claimant sent another letter
dated 11.10.89 staking his claim for incorporation of
escalation clause 10 (c) (c) of CPWD Schedule. In the
meantime, the claimant kept holding the duplicate copy of
the Work Order dated 18.8.89. The Respondent did not
agree to incorporate clause10 (c) (c). I hold that no
justification has been made out for incorporation of
CPWD clause10 (c) (c) and the claimant could have
turned down the offer if it was not acceptable to him.
Any variation subsequent to the submission of offer and
acceptance by respondent firm could only be with mutual
consent of the parties and not unilaterally by the claimant.
The demand for escalation by the claimant
and refusal by respondent resulted in exchange of
considerable correspondences between the parties and
eventually respondent firm agreed to give 12.5% overall
increase in the cost of contract in the interest of
completing the building expeditiously, but the claimant
was not satisfied with the increase and insisted that the
clause10 (c) (c) of CPWD Schedule be incorporated in the
contract and offer by respondent of overall increase by
12.5% was not acceptable. The claimant made it a
condition precedent for starting the construction work
which he had already stopped. The claimant was called
upon to resume the work by the respondent and it was
categorically stated that in case the claimant did not start
the work, he will be deemed to have abandoned the work.
The claimant failed to resume the work and wanted to
remove tools and tackles from the construction site. I
accordingly hold that the claimant had abandoned the
work.”

With reference to the aforesaid extract from the award, the learned counsel for
the claimant submitted that there is no material to support the finding of the
learned Arbitrator that the offer made by the respondent of an overall increase

CS(OS) No.2664A/92 & IA Nos.3133/93 & 9259/93

Page No.3 of 5

by 12.5% was not acceptable to the claimant. In response to this, the learned
counsel for the respondent / counter-claimant has drawn my attention to
Annexure – M before the learned Arbitrator which was a document filed by the
claimant and is a letter dated 11.01.1991 addressed by the claimant to the
respondent. The letter itself has reference to a meeting held on 07.01.1991 and
alongwith the said letter, a copy of the minutes of the meeting of 07.01.1991
has been annexed. Reading the minutes of meeting, it is abundantly clear that
the offer of an overall increase of 12.5% had been made by the respondent and
it was also indicated that it was not possible for the management to go beyond
that. The minutes indicate that the claimant had sought time to consider the
proposal and to give its reaction in a few days time.

The letter dated

11.01.1991, which followed after a few days, contains a categorical refusal in
the following words:“Therefore we are sorry we are unable to accept 12.5%
increase.”

3.

It was also stated in the letter that if the respondent did not accept

the CPWD clause 10 (c) (c) escalation, then the claimant be allowed to remove
its materials and that they cannot go on with the work. This document clearly
establishes the finding recorded by the learned Arbitrator that though the
respondent had made the offer of an overall increase of 12.5%, the same was
not acceptable to the claimant.

4.

In these circumstances, the objections raised by the claimant, which

are founded upon what has been stated above, are not substantiated. The same
are, therefore, rejected.

5,

Coming to the objections raised by the respondent, after having

heard the counsel for the parties, I am of the view that the finding of the learned
Arbitrator insofar as claim No.6 is concerned, cannot be faulted. Accordingly,
this objection is also rejected. The award is accepted in toto and is made a rule
of the court.
