During the pendency of the suit, the plaintiffs and the defendants have

permanent injunction restraining the infringement of their registered trade

The plaintiffs had also instituted this suit for

infringement of copyright, dilution and unfair competition as well as

By way of the settlement / compromise arrived at between the parties,

the defendants have acknowledged the plaintiffs to be the proprietors of the
aforesaid trade marks and the 'SPLASH OF MILK' device. The defendants
have also acknowledged the plaintiffs to be the owners of the copyright in
'MILKYBAR' and 'POP CHOC' packaging, including their get-up, layout,
colour combination and arrangement of features.

The defendants have

undertaken not to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, advertise, or directly or
indirectly, deal in any food products, including confectionery under the
impugned trade marks, 'MILKYBALL', 'POPCHOC' or using the 'HEART
AND MOUTH' device or any other trade mark or logo which may be
identical or deceptively similar to the aforesaid trade mark(s) of the
plaintiffs. The defendants have also undertaken not to do anything as would
amount to passing off their goods as those of the plaintiffs'. The defendants
have agreed to pay a sum of Rs 55,000/- towards token damages to the
plaintiffs. The said amount stands paid and the same is acknowledged by
the learned counsel for the plaintiffs. The defendants have also undertaken
to deliver all the impugned goods and packaging which were taken in
custody and given on superdari within a week from the date of this order to
the authorised representative of the plaintiffs for the purposes of
