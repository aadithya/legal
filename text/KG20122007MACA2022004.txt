KAILASH GAMBHIR, J.
The present appeal is preferred against the award
dated 6.1.2004 passed by Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal in Suit Nos. 1836/98 and 276/99, whereby the
Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 3,74,000/- along with
interest @ 9% per annum from the date of institution of
the petition i.e., 9.1.1999 till its realisation.
The brief facts of the present case are as follows:
The deceased Sh. Raj Kumar Bhasin aged 26 years
met with an accident on 15.11.98 while driving his twowheeler scooter bearing registration no. DL-4S-R0829
on being hit by a tanker bearing registration no. DEG
4730 near Subroto Park red light at Rao Tula Ram Marg,
New Delhi, resulting into his death.

A claim petition

was filed on 9.1.99 and award was made on 6.1.2004.
Aggrieved with the said award present appeal is
preferred by the appellant insurance company.
The

main

grievance

of

appellant

insurance company is that the tribunal has not granted
recovery rights to the insurer.

Mr. Deepak Mallik,

counsel for the appellant contended that the the owner
and driver were proceeded ex parte by the Tribunal and
the driver was having a fake driving licence at the time
of driving the vehicle, therefore, had the owner and
driver of the offending vehicle

been appearing, it

would have been proved beyond reasonable doubt that
there was breach of conditions of policy as the licence
was fake on which the driver was driving the offending
vehicle.

The counsel further urged that the Tribunal

failed to appreciate the fact that both, the owner and
the driver, deliberately failed to appear before the
Tribunal and therefore an adverse inference should
have been drawn against the owner and the driver.
The counsel has placed reliance on the following
judgments in support of his contentions:

Per

contra,

Mr.I.S.

counsel

respondent nos. 1 & 2 has vehemently refuted the
contentions of counsel for the appellant. The counsel
maintained that the onus to prove that the owner had
the knowledge that the driver had a fake licence was
on the insurer, which the insurer failed to prove,
therefore, the Tribunal rightly denied recovery rights to
the insurer.

The counsel has relied on the following

I have heard learned counsel for the parties
and have perused the records.
Perusal of the award shows that the Tribunal has
not given recovery rights to the appellant insurance
company on the ground that the appellant insurance
company has failed to prove on record that the owner
of the offending vehicle had the knowledge of the said
MAC APP.NO. 202/2004

fact of driver's possessing the fake licence.

the driver to

The Tribunal further

observed that in the deposition of the witness of the
insurance company he also failed to state that there
was a breach of terms and conditions of the policy on
the part of the driver and owner of the offending
vehicle.

It is no doubt true that in order to claim

complete exoneration from any liability the onus lies
on the insurer of the vehicle to prove that there is a
breach in the terms and conditions of the policy, and
once such breach is established, then only, the
insurance company cannot be held liable to satisfy the
judgment or award against any person in respect of
MAC APP.NO. 202/2004

page 6 of 10

third party risk as envisaged under Section 149 (2) of
the Motor Vehicles Act.
In the facts of the present case, the appellant
insurance company has duly proved on record to show
that Shri Rohtash, driverof the offending vehicle i.e.,
respondent no.1 was in possession of a fake driving
licence. The moot question which would arise is that
once the insurance company has discharged its onus
of proving the said fact of the driver not holding a valid
driving licence or that the driver was in possession of a
fake licence then still the insurer can be deprived from
claiming the recovery rights from the insured.

In

catena of judgments the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
taken a view that it is only when in the evidence it is
proved that the owner

had no knowledge about the

said fake licence being in possession of the driver of
the offending vehicle, then the owner cannot be held
liable to satisfy the award.
MAC APP.NO. 202/2004

However, the question
page 7 of 10

arises that in a case where the owner of the offending
vehicle does not choose to contest the case and enter
the witness box to depose the said fact then,

can the

insured still be held liable to satisfy the award without
even giving the insurer the recovery rights.

In my

considered view, in a case where the insurer is able to
satisfy the court that either there is no licence or the
licence is fake one or the licence was not valid as on
the date of the accident

then in the absence of any

evidence from the side of the owner to plead and prove
ignorance on his part about such a fact, the insurer of
the vehicle cannot be deprived of the recovery rights to
ultimately claim the award amount from the owner of
the offending vehicle. Non appearance of the owner
and driver of the offending vehicle and lack of any
evidence on their part has to be at their peril and not
at the peril of the insurer of the vehicle.
In the matter of Narcinva V. Kamat & Ors.

(Supra),

as relied upon by the counsel for the

respondent the facts were totally dissimilar, as in that
case not an iota of evidence was led by the insurance
company to prove that the driver did not possess the
valid driving licence to drive the vehicle. In such case
the Apex Court has held that the insurance company
has failed to prove that there was a breach of terms of
the contract of the insurance. The said judgment cited
by the counsel for the respondent can be of no help to
him in the facts and circumstances of the instant case.
The other judgments as cited by the counsel for the
respondent are also not applicable to the facts and
circumstances of the present case.
In the light of the above discussion,

the

present appeal is allowed limited to the extent of the
finding of the Tribunal denying the appellant recovery
rights to recover the award amount from the owner of
the offending vehicle. The appellant being the insurer
MAC APP.NO. 202/2004

page 9 of 10

of the offending vehicle is allowed to recover the award
amount from the respondent owner of the offending
vehicle.
With these directions, appeal stands disposed
of.
