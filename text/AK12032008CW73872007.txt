1.

The petitioner has impugned the award dated 17th May, 2007

holding that the action of the respondent, Punjab & Sind Bank, to treat
the petitioner to have voluntarily retired from service under Clause
17(a) of Bipartite Settlement is legal and justified and the petitioner is
not entitled for any relief as prayed by him.

The Ministry of Labor by its letter No.L-12012/11/2004 (IR(B-II)

Central Government dated 23th June, 2004 had made the following
reference:
“Whether the action of the management of Punjab & Sind
Bank to treat the workman Shri Harswaroop to have
voluntarily retired from service under Clause 17(a) of the
Bipartite Settlement is legal and justified? If not, what relief
is the concerned disputant entitled to.”

3.

The petitioner contended that he was a Peon working with the

respondent Bank from 18th April, 1975. It was asserted that on 24th
February, 1996, he fell sick and was given medical treatment in
government hospital and thereafter he was treated at government
hospital at NOIDA and after a long treatment he was declared fit on
22nd

February,

2002.

He

contended

that

all

the

necessary

applicants/information together with medical certificates were sent to
the Bank from time to time, however, when petitioner got the medical
fitness certificate and he approached the Chief Manager on 22nd
February, 2002 to resume his duties, he was not allowed to join.

4.

The petitioner asserted that the provision of voluntary cessation

of employment as provided under clause 17of 5th Bipartite Settlement
dated 10th August, 1989 has been altogether deleted by clause No.33 of
7th Bipartite Settlement with effect from 1st November, 1997 and there
WP (C) 7387 of 2007

Page 2 of 10

was no provision of voluntary cessation of employment in banking
industry after 1st November, 1997.

5.

The grievance of the petitioner is that he was not issued any

letter/notice as required under clause 17(a) of Bipartite Settlement and
the respondent failed to conduct an inquiry and take action against him
in case the absence of the petitioner tantamount to a misconduct on his
part.

6.

The claim of the petitioner was contested on the ground that the

petitioner remained absent without permission/leave/intimation from
24th February, 1996. According to the respondent, a medical certificate
dated 5th June, 1996 was given stipulating that he is suffering from
some disease from 1st March, 1996 to 2nd June, 1996 and he is advised
rest. The petitioner did not approached for duty on 3rd June, 1996 nor
applied for any leave or informed the Bank about his sickness and did
not join the duties despite various letter on 30th December, 1998 to 26th
April, 1996, 6th July, 1996 and 21st August, 1996. The petitioner was
though advised to appear before the Bank’s medical official, however, he
did not do so. The petitioner was given a notice on 17th October, 1996
to which the petitioner did not reply and by letter dated 13th January,

WP (C) 7387 of 2007

Page 3 of 10

1998, the petitioner was intimated that he has ceased to be in the
service of the respondent Bank.

7.

The respondent Bank contended that the 7th Bipartite Settlement

was arrived at 27th March, 2000, however, deletion of the same will not
make

any

difference

because

the

workman/petitioner

was

not

interested in joining his duties and had remained un-authorizedly
absent for a long period about eight years.

8.

The Labour Court has considered the pleas and evidence of the

parties and has held that the workman/petitioner failed to file any
medical certificate from 3rd June, 1996 to 5th July, 2000. Considering
the previous record of the petitioner, it also became apparent that he is
a habitual absentee and he was absent for 893 days during the period
1991 to 1995.

Though two prescriptions were submitted by the

petitioner, which were dated 4th October, 2000 and 3rd June, 1996,
however, these prescriptions did not reflect that the petitioner was
unable to join duties or he was advised rest.

9.

The Labour Court considered the cross-examination of the

petitioner admitting that he did not know the name of his disease and
WP (C) 7387 of 2007

Page 4 of 10

that he was not hospitalized even for a day during the alleged treatment
from 1996 to 2000. On the basis of the evidence produced before the
Labor Court, it was held that the documents specially the prescriptions
produced by the petitioner seems to be forged and cooked and the
petitioner failed to produce the original medical certificates despite
opportunities granted to him. It was observed by the Court that the
photocopies of the medical certificates had been obtained by the
petitioner in 2002 after manipulation.

10.

The findings and inferences of the Labor Court are based on

evidence and documents on record and there does not appear to be any
manifest errors in it. This court in exercise of its jurisdiction under
Article 226 of Constitution of India is not to substitute its own
inferences with the inferences drawn by the Labor Court. In (2006) 2
SCC 373 , at page 378 Govt. of A.P. v. Mohd. Nasrullah Khan the
Supreme court had held:

11. By now it is a well-established principle of law that the
High Court exercising power of judicial review under Article
226 of the Constitution does not act as an appellate
authority. Its jurisdiction is circumscribed and confined to
correct errors of law or procedural error, if any, resulting in
manifest miscarriage of justice or violation of principles of
natural justice. Judicial review is not akin to adjudication
on merit by reappreciating the evidence as an appellate
authority.

WP (C) 7387 of 2007

Page 5 of 10

11.

Thus it is a settled position of law that in exercise of jurisdiction

under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the Court should not
interfere with factual findings of the lower courts and should restrain
itself from re-appreciating evidence while exercising powers of judicial
review.

Therefore, writ court should refrain from interfering with the

orders of an inferior tribunal or subordinate court unless it suffers from
an error of jurisdiction or from a breach of the principles of natural
justice or is vitiated by a manifest or apparent error of law. The
objective of judicial review is that a person receives a fair treatment and
objective is not to re-appreciate the entire pleas and evidence and draw
inferences again. Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a
review of the manner in which the decision is made. Power of judicial
review is meant to ensure that the individual receives fair treatment and
not to ensure that the conclusion which the authority reaches is
necessarily correct in the eye of the court.

12

Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that there was no

reference for a period prior to 1995 and consequently the finding of the
Labor Court that the petitioner was unauthorisedly absent for 893 days
from 1991 to 1995 could not have been arrived at. Perusal of the pleas
and evidence, it is apparent that though the absence of the petitioner
from 1991 to 1995 was not the fact in issue but the said fact that for
the period even prior to 1996 up to 2002, the petitioner remained
WP (C) 7387 of 2007

Page 6 of 10

absent even during 1991 to 1995 for 893 days will be a relevant factor
which could be taken into consideration before deciding whether the
petitioner is entitled for any of the relief sought by him.

13.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has pointed out the letter dated

17th October, 1996 of the respondent which was addressed to the
petitioner stipulating that since the petitioner has not sent any
document regarding his treatment in a government hospital he was
asked to get himself medically examined from a doctor of the Bank and
the petitioner was asked to join the duties of the Bank within 30 days
failing which it will be deemed that the petitioner has been voluntarily
ceased to be in employment of the Bank.

Learned counsel for the

petitioner’s contention is that notice dated 13th January, 1998 was sent
almost after 1½ years and on that date the clause 17 (a) of bipartite
Settlement had already been cancelled, therefore, it cannot be said that
the petitioner had voluntarily ceased to be in the services of the Bank.
Reading the communication dated 17th October, 1996 and 13th
January, 1998, it is apparent that on expiry of 30 days from the receipt
of the communication dated 17th October, 1996, the petitioner
voluntarily ceased to be in the service of the Bank. By letter dated 13th
November, 1998, it was reiterated by the respondent Bank that on
account of continuous absence of the petitioner, he has

voluntarily

ceased to be in the services of the respondent Bank especially because
WP (C) 7387 of 2007

Page 7 of 10

the petitioner did not join the duties even after 30 days of receipt of the
notice dated 17th October, 1996. Perusal of the memorandum of
settlement dated 27th March, 2000, it becomes apparent that clause 17
of the 5th Bipartite Settlement dated 10th April, 1989 was deleted on
27th March, 2000.

Therefore, the plea of the petitioner that the

petitioner could not be voluntarily ceased to be in the service of the
respondent Bank is not correct and is not made out in the facts and
circumstances.

14.

The learned counsel for the respondent has also relied on 2001

LAB. I.C. 301 (Supreme Court), Punjab & Sind Bank and others v.
Sakattar Singh holding that in terms of Bipartite Settlement clause 17 it
is clear that even in case of an employee absenting himself from duty
for 90 or more consecutive days beyond the period of leave originally
sanctioned or subsequently extended after giving the notice by the
management calling upon the delinquent employee to report for duty
within 30 days and in case the employee fails to join duties, he will be
deemed to have voluntarily ceased from the services on the expiry of the
time fixed in the said notice. The observation of the Supreme Court in
Punjab & Sind Bank (supra) is as under:
“4.
A reading of clause XVI of IV Bipartite Settlement will
make it clear that in the even an employee absents himself
from duty for 90 or more consecutive days beyond the
period of leave originally sanctioned or subsequently
WP (C) 7387 of 2007

Page 8 of 10

extended the Management may, at any time thereafter, give
a notice to the employee at the last known address calling
upon him to report for duty within 30 days of notice
stating, inter alia, the grounds for the Management coming
to the conclusion that the employee has no intention of
joining duty and furnishing necessary evidence wherever
relevant and unless the employee reports for duty within 30
days of the notice or gives an explanation for his absence
satisfying the Management that he has not taken up
another employment or avocation and he has no intention
of not joining the duty, the employee will be deemed to have
voluntarily retired from the bank’s service on the expiry of
the time fixed in the said notice. In the event of the
employee giving a satisfactory reply, he will be permitted to
report for duty thereafter within 30 days from the expiry of
the aforesaid notice without prejudice to the bank’s right to
take any action under the law or rules of service. Under
this Rule the employee is given an opportunity to rejoin
duty with a stipulated time or explain his position to the
satisfaction of the Management that he has no intention of
not joining duty, and a presumption will be drawn that the
employee does not required the job any more and will stand
retired from service. Thus, there is no punishment for
misconduct but only to notice the realities of the situation
resulting from long absence of an employee from work with
no satisfactory explanation thereto.
The principles of
natural justice cannot be examined in vacuum without
reference to the fact-situation arising in the case. This Rule
has been incorporated in an agreement where
representatives of employees’ unions were party. They also
realised the facility of continuing a situation when an
employee
without
appropriate
intimation
to
the
management is playing truant.”

15.

Consequently, it can be held that after 30 days of the notice dated

17th October, 1996 when petitioner failed to report for duty, he was
deemed to have voluntarily ceased to be in the service of the Bank in
accordance with clause 17(a) of Bipartite Settlement. If the petitioner
voluntarily ceased to be in the employment of the respondent Bank in
WP (C) 7387 of 2007

Page 9 of 10

terms of the Bipartite Settlement, the plea of the petitioner that there
should have been an inquiry against him and only after taking action in
accordance with the report of the enquiry, he could be released from his
work, cannot be inferred nor it is made out in the facts and
circumstances.

16.

The findings of the Labour Court do not suffer from any perversity

or such manifest error which require correction in exercise of
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In the
circumstances, there is no infirmity or patent error or perversity in the
findings

of

Central

Government

Industrial Tribunal cum Labour

Court–II so as to entail inference by this Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India.
The writ petition is, therefore, without any merit and it is
therefore, dismissed.
