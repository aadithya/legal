Following substantial questions of law stand formulated in

RSA No.67 & 90/2001

Page No.1 of 12

the memorandum of appeal:“(A) Whether a person in settled possession of the
property under a possessory title is or is not entitled
to protection against dispossession without due
process of Law?
(B) Whether D.D.A. admittedly having not been
put in possession by Ministry of Rehabilitation and
the notification of acquisition having been set aside,
could still claim any right or title to property in
presence to person in actual possession?
(C) Whether the setting aside of the notification of
acquisition under which claim to the property of the
Plaintiff was laid by D.D.A. is not conclusive that the
land was not of the Govt. and had not been
acquired?
(D) Whether the first appellate court has any
jurisdiction to call for and rely
on documents
permitted to be filed without allowing opportunity to
the opposite party to rebut and without calling for
the proof of the documents?”
2.

Briefly noted, relevant facts are that the appellant, Fateh

Singh, filed a suit for permanent injunction impleading UOI,
CPWD, PWD, MCD and DDA as defendants stating that his
grand father Choudhary Kanwar Singh was in cultivatory
possession of land comprised in Khasra Nos. 1285/439/195,
1283/439/195 and Khasra No.1324/134, Village Sadhora Khurd,
East Sarai Rohilla and after the death of his grand father his
father Risal Singh and his cousin Ram Saran came in possession
of the land. That Risal Singh died in the year 1972 and his
father died in the year 1973 and since then he had been in
possession of said lands.
RSA No.67 & 90/2001

That the defendants were forcibly
Page No.2 of 12

trying to evict him from 5 bigha of land in Khasra No.1324/134.
He therefore prayed that a decree of permanent injunction be
passed

in

his

favour

restraining

the

defendants

from

dispossessing him from 5 bigha of land comprised in Khasra
No.1324/134, Village Sadhora Khurd, East Sarai Rohilla.
3.

Various defences were raised in the written statement

filed by DDA. It was stated that the land in question belonged
to the Union of India and vide Package Deal notified vide letter
No. 4(19)/78/55-II(Vol.II) dated 2.9.1982 physical possession of
the lands detailed therein which included Site No.4, Sarai
Rohilla was transferred to DDA.
4.

At the trial, appellant led evidence and so did the

defendants.
5.

The focus of the parties was whether Site No.4 referred to

in letter No.4(19)/78/55-II related to the suit land and whether
appellant, through his ancestors was in possession of the suit
land as claimed by him.
6.

At the trial appellant proved Ex.PW1/1 i.e. certified copy of

judgment and decree dated 12.1.1976 passed in a suit filed by
his father holding that acquisition of land pertaining to Khasra
No.1283/439/195 and 1285/439/195 Village Sadhora Khurd was
struck down and vide Ex.PW1/2 RCA No.171/79 challenging the
judgment Ex. PW1/1 was dismissed.

the

letter/notification No. 4(19)/78/55-II(Vol.II) dated 2.9.1982 as
Ex. DW1/1. It also proved a letter dated 14.2.1988 addressed
by the Government to DDA evidencing that site as per lay out
plan, Ex. DW1/4, was handed over to DDA.

DDA also proved

Ex. DW1/2 wherein Site No.4 was referred to as encroached
agricultural land.
7.

Other evidences were also led but being not relevant are

not being noted by me.
8.

The learned Trial Judge decided the suit in favour of the

plaintiff holding that Ex. DW1/2 itself recorded that the site was
under encroachment.

That Vide Ex. PW1/1 suit filed by father

of the plaintiff was decreed and vide Ex. PW1/2 the appeal filed
was dismissed. Thus, the acquisition notifications having been
quashed and there being no proof that land was subsequently
acquired, stand of the defendants was not established.

In

respect of the Khasra Girdawari which was proved by the
plaintiff, learned Trial Judge held that all 3, i.e. Ex. PW3/1, Ex.
PW3/2 and Ex. PW3/3 established possession of the appellant.
RSA No.67 & 90/2001

Page No.4 of 12

It was held that the defendants could not dispossess the
appellant without adopting the due process of law.
9.

The judgment and decree is dated 20.5.2000.

10.

Two appeals were preferred against the judgment and

decree dated 20.5.2000. DDA as well as UOI filed the appeals.
Appeal filed by DDA was registered as RCA No.105/2000 and
appeal filed by UOI was registered as RCA No.130/2000. Since
2 defendants had filed separate appeals but subject matter of
the 2 appeals was the same, both appeals were clubbed for
disposal.
11.

In appeal filed by DDA an application under Order 6 Rule

17 CPC accompanied by an application under Order 41 Rule 27
CPC for filing additional documents was filed.

Prayer made

was to permit DDA to amend the written statement and taken
on record the additional documents. Amendment prayed was
that issue pertaining to land comprised in Khasra No.1324/134
need not be decided with reference to acquisition notifications
which were quashed vide Ex. PW1/1 for the reason title in the
suit land always vested in the Government and that the
appellant managed to procure false entries in the Khasra
Girdawari for the first time in the year 1993 showing his
possession and immediately filed the suit on 11.10.1993.
Prayer made was to permit DDA to raise, by way of preliminary
objection No.4, a plea as under :RSA No.67 & 90/2001

Page No.5 of 12

'That plaintiff has not locus standi to grab the public
land in which he has no right, title or interest of any
kind. Khasra No.1324/134 is admittedly is Govt. land
since time immemorial and continues to be so till
today, therefore the plaintiff is not entitled to
discretionary relief of injunction of any kind in respect
of public land.'
12.

Along with the amendment application certified copies of

Khasra Girdawari for the period 1980-94; mutation record
pursuant to the settlement effected in the year 1908-09 were
filed.
13.

Vide order dated 20.2.2001 subject to payment of cost in

sum of Rs.300/- the amendment application was allowed.
Application moved under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC for placing on
record certified copies of the Khasra Girdawari and mutation
effected in the settlement of the year 1908 was allowed and
the documents were taken on record.
14.

Costs were accepted by counsel for the appellant. Matter

was argued. Learned Appellate Judge reversed the finding of
the learned Trial Judge principally placing reliance upon Khasra
Girdawari filed along with the application under Order 41 Rule
27 and the settlement record.
15.

In the backdrop facts afore-noted the 4 substantial

questions of law framed and as noted above need to be
answered.
16.

As regards the fourth (D) substantial question of law

framed, suffice would it be to state that having accepted the
RSA No.67 & 90/2001

Page No.6 of 12

cost when amendment was allowed at the appellate stage and
simultaneously additional documents were taken on record,
appellant would be estopped from questioning the amendment
to the written statement at the appellate stage as also the
consequential order taking on record the documents which
were filed.
17.

I note that the appellant did not challenge the order dated

20.2.2001 allowing application of DDA to amend the written
statement as also to take on record the additional documents.
Even in the instant appeals said order has not been challenged.
18.

Pertaining to the third (C) question of law suffice would it

be to state that acquisition notifications which were set aside
vide Ex. PW1/1 being the judgment and decree dated
12.1.1976 did not pertain to the suit land. They pertained to
land comprised in Khasra Nos. 1285/439/195, 1283/439/195,
Village Sadhora Khurd, East Sarai Rohilla. Thus, nothing turns
on said decision affirmed in appeal vide Ex. PW1/2 being the
certified copy of the order dated 11.9.1979 passed in RCA
No.171/79.
19.

The questions of law (A) and (B) need to be decided

together.
20.

Suffice would it be to state that appellant could have

succeeded had he established settled possession.
21.

In this connection I propose to discuss the evidence with

RSA No.67 & 90/2001

Page No.7 of 12

respect to the documents which were proved at the trial
independent of the documents which were taken on record at
the appellate stage. I also propose to discuss the effect of the
documents taken on record at the appellate stage.
22.

In respect of the documents proved at the trial, neither

party led any evidence to establish, with reference to the
original settlement record, as to who was recorded as the
owner of land comprised in Khasra No.1324/134. But, as noted
here-in-above

appellant

himself

proved

khasra

Girdawari

pertaining to the suit land being Ex. PW3/2. Under the column
'Name of Owner as per Jamabandi' it records that the
Government of India was the owner of the said land.
23.

Thus,

EX. PW3/2 i.e. the document relied upon by the

appellant to show his possession itself recorded owner of the
Government.
24.

It is settled law that unless challenged, entries in the

revenue record are prima facie evidence of title. I clarify that a
mutation entry does not create a title but certainly is evidence
relating to the fact that in the revenue records the person so
recorded as owner is the owner of the land for purposes of
payment of land revenue.
25.

Thus, de hors the settlement record pertaining to the year

1908 which was brought on record at the appellate stage,
sufficient evidence existed before the learned Trial Judge to
RSA No.67 & 90/2001

Page No.8 of 12

show that the suit land belonged to the Union of India.
26.

Thus, even ignoring the amendment incorporated in the

written statement at the appellate stage and additional
documents filed at the appellate stage, finding returned by the
learned Trial Judge that since acquisition notification was
quashed vide Ex. PW1/1 appellant was the owner of the suit
land cannot be sustained.
27.

Learned Trial Judge lost sight of the fact that the judgment

and decree Ex. PW1/1 did not pertain to the suit land.

It

pertained to land comprised in Khasra Nos. 1285/439/195 and
1283/439/195, Village Sadhora Khurd, East Sarai Rohilla.
28.

Ex. PW3/2 gets reinforced with reference to the certified

copies of the revenue record pertaining to the settlement of
land revenue in the year 1908.

The same shows that the

Government of India is recorded as the owner of the suit land.
29.

On the issue of possession it would be interesting to note

that the appellant only proved Ex. PW3/2 as proof of
possession. The same is the Khasra Girdawrai issued to the
appellant recording that Government of India is the owner of
the land but appellant's possession is shown therein. However,
the Khasra Girdawari relates to the Kharif and Rabi period for
the year 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998. In other words appellant
showed the possession recorded in the revenue records only
after the suit was filed.
RSA No.67 & 90/2001

Page No.9 of 12

30.

No evidence was brought on record that the appellant was

in possession of the suit land save and except self serving oral
statement of the appellant when he appeared as his witness.
31.

The revenue record produced at the appellate stage

evidences that appellant managed to procure an entry in the
Khasra Girdawari for the Kharif period of the year 1993. Prior
thereto the land was shown as being in possession of the
Government of India and DDA.
32.

As noted above DDA claims transfer of the land to it from

Government of India vide notification, Ex. DW1/1 dated
2.9.1982.
33.

I need not discuss the effect of Ex. DW1/3 and the site

plan Ex. DW1/4 for the reason nothing turns thereon.
34.

The inevitable conclusion is that the finding recorded by

the learned Appellate Judge that there was no evidence to show
that the appellant was in continuous settled possession of the
suit land and hence was not entitled to any injunction is correct.
Thus the questions of law 'A' and 'B' which were framed in the
appeal stand answered holding that the appellant has failed to
establish settled possession. That the revenue entries establish
possession of DDA. That the notifications which were set aside
vide judgment dated Ex.PW1/1 did not relate to the suit land.
The view taken by the learned Trial Judge has rightly been
reversed by the Appellate Judge. The learned Trial Judge has
RSA No.67 & 90/2001

Page No.10 of 12

misdirected the inquiry.

The Appellate Court has correctly

referred to and appreciated the relevant evidence
35.

Before concluding I may note that the learned Trial

Judge got thoroughly confused by the pleadings of the plaintiff.
As noted above, the suit related only to land comprised in
Khasra No.1324/134, Village Sadhora Khurd.

Evidence was led that

notification No.F-15(67)53-MT issued in December 1953 was
quashed vide Ex. PW1/1.

The learned Trial Judge got misled

into going into the issue whether due to quashing of the
notification the Government of India could or could not claim
title to the land. Unnecessary evidence has been permitted to
be brought on record.
36.

With a little care and clarity, scope of evidence could be

restricted. Evidence pertaining to the suit land alone and no
more should have been allowed to be brought on record. Land
comprised

in

No.1283/439/195,

Khasra

No.1285/439/195

and

Khasra

was not the subject matter of the suit. Unnecessary evidence
pertaining to the said lands could have been avoided from
being brought on record.
37

I may note that DDA is in possession of the suit land. After

RSA No.67 & 90/2001

Page No.11 of 12

obtaining orders of status quo from this court on 4.5.2001
appellant attempted to repossess the land by taking gunmen at
the site. On 17.7.2001 the status quo order granted to the
appellant on 4.5.2001 was modified. It was noted by the court
that photographs show that the appellant accompanied by 3
gunmen went to the site to resume possession. Orders were
passed that the appellants would be entitled to arrest any
person who attempts to trespass on the land in question.
38.

The appeals are dismissed.

LCR be returned.
