PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (ORAL)

1.

Petitioners pray that the order dated 18.11.2000

summoning the petitioners to face trial for offences under Section
109/120B/339/340/383/503 IPC be set aside and complaint filed
by the complainant Bhupendra Singh Chauhan be quashed.
2.

At the outset, I may note that petitioner No. 1, Lala

Charat Ram, impleaded as accused No. 1 has died during
pendency of the present petition. Hence, the complain qua him
i.e. Lala Charat Ram has abated.
3.

In his complaint, Bhupendra Singh Chauhan stated that

first petitioner Lala Charat Ram was the Chairman of M/s. Shriram
Pistons & Rings Ltd.

Petitioner No.2 Ashok Kumar Taneja was

stated to be the Senior Executive Director of the said company.
Petitioner No. 3 R.Shriniwasan was stated to be Executive Director
of the company. Petitioner No. 4 Rajeev Sethi was stated to be
the Junior Executive Director of the company.

Petitioner No. 5

Alok Bhattacharjee was stated to be Assistant General Manager of
the company and petitioner No. 6 Ms. Swatantra Wadhwa was
stated to be a Senior Assistant in the company.

Complainant

stated that after being interviewed, he was appointed as an
officer on special duty and signed a service bond on 8.9.1994.
That he joined the company on 5.10.1994.

That the company

started discriminating against the complainant and he protested.
That the management of the company started acting in a manner
which created a hostile work environment for the complainant.
The intention was to somehow or other get rid of the complainant.
That when everything failed, on 10.12.1998, in furtherance of a
conspiracy by the accused persons, Rajeev Sethi, petitioner No. 4
called complainant to his cabin for a meeting at 5.00 P.M. That
when he went to the cabin of Rajeev Sethi, petitioners 5 and 6,
Alok Bhattacharjee and Swatantra Wadhwa were present in the
cabin.

They informed that they had discussed the matter with

Ashok Taneja and R.Shriniwasan, petitioners 2 and 3 respectively
who desired that the complainant should resign. That they told

the complainant that they were instructed by petitioner No.1, Lala
Charat Ram to ensure that the complainant resigns.

That

petitioners 4, 5 and 6 told the complainant that if he did not
resign, he would be transferred to a far away place and the
company might even indict him in

false case.

That the

complainant realized that he was trapped and was being
threatened. On the pretext of going out from the room to type
the requisite resignation letter, so stating, when he attempted to
walk out of the cabin, petitioner No. 4 signaled to petitioner No. 5
and 6 who stood up and came in between the complainant and
the door of the cabin thereby preventing the complainant to go
out of the cabin.

That petitioners 4, 5 and 6 provided a blank

sheet of paper to the complainant and made him write a
resignation letter and told him to date the same as 28.2.1999.
That the complainant was thus forced under threat, illegal
confinement and stress to write the resignation letter.
4.

I may note that in his complaint, complainant stated

that offences were made out even under Section 420 and Section
504 IPC, but learned Metropolitan Magistrate, in his order dated
18.11.2000 has summoned the accused persons to face trial for
offences under Sections 109/120B/339/340/383/503 IPC.
5.

It is urged by learned counsel for the petitioners that

the complainant tendered a voluntary resignation and was just
trying to harass the petitioners by filing a false and a frivolent

complaint.

That the complainant was a law graduate and had

joined the legal profession after his resignation. That complainant
was misusing his position as a Member of the legal profession.
6.

Unfortunately, no assistance has been rendered at the

hearing today by the complainant who has chosen not to appear.
7.

However, I have perused the record of learned

Metropolitan Magistrate.
8.

Along with the complaint, the complainant, under a

index dated 21.4.1999 has filed 31 documents. The same have
been exhibited in his pre-summoning evidence.
9.

Ex.CW-1/21 is a letter dated 18.1.1999 addressed by

the complainant to the Chairman of the company informing him of
the incident on 10.12.1998. It has been stated in the letter as to
how petitioners 4 to 5 procured from him a post-dated resignation
letter dated 28.2.1999.

That the complainant was withdrawing

his post dated resignation.

Further, proved as Ex. CW-1/22 is

another letter dated 18.1.1999 informing petitioner No. 3, the
Executive Director of the Company, that the complainant was
withdrawing his post dated resignation dated 28.2.1999.
10.

Since I am dealing with the issue pertaining to the

summoning order and parties have yet to lead their evidence, lest
prejudice is caused to either party at the trial, I refrain from
noting the further testimony of the complainant at the presummoning stage.

11.

Suffice would it be to note that letters dated 18.1.1999

Ex. CW-1/21 and Ex. CW-1/22 are prima facie sufficient material
for the learned Metropolitan Magistrate to have taken cognizance
of the complaint. They reveal that in the month of January 1999,
complainant was making a grievance pertaining to a letter dated
28.2.1999.
12.

Needless to state, whether complainant proves the

manner in which he states he was compelled to resign or
otherwise needs to be decided after parties lead full and
complete evidence.
13.

However, a correction needs to be made in the

summoning order.
14.

On the allegations in the complaint and the pre-

summoning evidence, no case for wrongful confinement is made
out but certainly a case of wrongful restraint is made out. Thus,
petitioners have to be summoned for offence under Section 341
Cr.P.C. Similarly, pertaining to the grievance of the complainant
that he was forced to do an act which he was not legally bound to
do i.e. submit the resignation letter, offence for which petitioners
have to face trial is under Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code.
15.

Needless to state since there are allegations of

conspiracy and abetment, petitioners have to face trial for alleged
offences under Sections 109 and 120 B IPC as well.
16.

I see no case made out under Section 383 IPC for the

reason no valuable security or nothing signed or sealed which
could be converted into a valuable security has passed on from
the complainant to the accused persons.
17.

The petition accordingly stands disposed of holding

that since first petitioner has died, complaint qua him stand
abated. I modify the summoning order directing the remaining
petitioners

to

face

trial

for

offences

under

Sections

109/120B/341/506 IPC.
18.

No costs.

19.

LCR be returned forthwith.
