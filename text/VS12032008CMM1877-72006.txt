1.

This application has been filed by the petitioner to seek

modification of the order dated 6th December 2006 passed by this
court in the presence of the counsel for the petitioner as well as the
petitioner No.1. The petitioner had filed this petition to challenge the
order dated 20th September 2006 passed by the learned Additional
Rent Control Tribunal whereby the appeal filed by the petitioner
tenant against the eviction order passed by the ARC had been
dismissed. When this matter came up before this court on 8 th

November 2006, as evidenced from the order sheet, after some
hearing the petitioner did not seek to press the petition and only
sought time to vacate the premises on or before 31st December 2007.
The court further recorded that even otherwise, on the perusal of the
impugned order the concurrent finding of fact on the issue of nonpayment of rent and sub-letting, may not be liable to be interfered
with under Article 227 of the Constitution of India., and the court held
that the finding of the courts below, even otherwise, are in
accordance with law. Notice was issued to the respondent limited to
the question of grant of time to the petitioner to vacate the tenanted
premises on or before 31st December 2007 subject to furnishing of
undertaking. Notice was returnable on 6th December 2006.
2.

On 6th December 2006 once again the petitioner stated

that he does not wish to press this petition but seeks time to vacate
the tenanted premises on or before 31st December 2007. The
undertaking given by the petitioner was accepted by the court with a
further direction that the petitioner shall not sublet or part with
possession of the same and pay the rent month by month in advance
by the 7th of each month @ Rs.3000/- per month, besides electricity
and water charges. It was further undertaken that the arrears of rent,
electricity and water charges shall be cleared within one month from
the date of the order. On this basis, the court granted time to the
petitioner uptil 31st December 2007, in the presence of the parties,
and the matter was disposed of.

Thereafter, the present application has been filed by the

petitioner to say that the condition imposed upon him, requiring him
to pay occupation charges at Rs.3000/- per month, should be deleted.
The submission of the petitioner is that since the courts below had
held that the rate of rent was not Rs.3,000/-, such a condition could
not have been imposed upon him, while passing the order dated 6 th
December 2006. It is also argued that this application has been filed
immediately after the passing of the order dated 6 th December 2006,
when it was realized that this condition was imposed by the court in
the said order.
4.

I find no merit in either of the submissions of the

petitioner. The order dated 6th December 2006 was passed in the
presence of the petitioner and his counsel and after hearing the
counsel for the petitioner. It is well settled that once an eviction order
has been passed, the tenant who continues to hold over can be
required to pay the market rent. On 8th November 2006 itself, the
court had heard the petitioner on merits and expressed its view that
the impugned order does not call for interference by this court. Notice
was issued only to consider the aspect of of grant of time uptil
31.12.2007 to the petitioner to vacate the premises. On 6 th December
2006, the order was passed after hearing the parties. It was only fair
that the petitioner was required to pay an amount with the court
found reasonable for his continued use and occupation of the
premises uptil 31st December 2007. In law the petitioner was not

C.M. Appl. No. 17506/2006 in C.M. (M) No. 1877-78/2006

entitled to any such protection. The court exercised its discretion
equitably by granting time to the petitioner to vacate the suit
premises after nearly one year, i.e., by 31.12.2007. However, the said
indulgence was not granted unconditionally. Obviously, the court had
to balance the equities and therefore imposed conditions, one of
which was to require the petitioner to pay the rent @ Rs.3,000/- per
month. But for the said indulgence granted by the court with the
consent of the respondent, the petitioner would have been liable to
be evicted forthwith. The petitioner took advantage of the said order
granting him time uptil 31st December 2007, which was subject to,
inter-alia, the condition with regard to the payment of monthly
charges of Rs.3,000/- besides electricity and water charges. Merely
because application was moved soon after the passing of order dated
6th December 2006, it cannot be said that the order requiring the
petitioner to pay Rs.3,000/- per month could not have been passed.
Had the petitioner been so minded, and had objection to the payment
of the rent at Rs.3,000/- per month, he should have vacated the
premises even before 31st December 2007. I see no merit in the
application. The same is dismissed.
5.

Petition stands disposed of.
