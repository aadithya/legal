Page 1 of 6

Nos.1174, 1165, 1166, 1169,1173, 1176 & 1178 of 2006
filed by the Revenue are disposed of since common
question of law is involved in these appeals.
2.

All these appeals arise out of the consolidated order

dated 23rd December, 2005 passed by the Income Tax
Appellate

Tribunal

(in

short

as

Tribunal)

in

ITA

No.4685(Del)/2000 for the assessment years 1999-2000,
ITA No.596(Del)/2002 for the financial years 1989-90 to
1997-98

and

ITA

Nos.3815-3818(Del)/2004

for

the

assessment years 1995-96 to 1998-99.
3.

M/s Max India Ltd., the Assessee in this case under its

scheme provided to its officers cars and hard furnishing
items.

Under the said scheme, the Assessee purchased

cars and/or hard furnishing items in its name subject to the
limit as indicated in the scheme framed by the Assessee
and gave the same to its officials. Further, under the said
scheme, the Assessee after the prescribed period allowed
its officials to purchase the said items and/or agreed to
replace the items. The Assessee sold to its employees hard
furnishing items and cars at a price mutually agreed to. In
some of the cases, the agreed prices were less than the
ITA No.-1174/06

Page 2 of 6

written down value of the items.

The Assessing Officer

held that the difference in the sale price of the items and
the written down value of the items in the books of
accounts of the Assessee was perquisite in the hands of its
employees and the Assessee had not deducted the required
TDS on the said perquisite value.

Accordingly, the

Assessing Officer initiated proceedings under Section
201/201(1A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961(hereinafter
referred to as Act) and computed the short deduction of tax
under Section 201 of the Act at Rs.3,27,373/- and interest
thereon under Section 201(1A) of the Act at Rs.2,47,860/totaling to Rs.5,75,233/- for the assessment years 1990-91
to 1998-99.
4.

Similarly, the Assessing Officer computed the short

deduction of tax under Section 201 of the Act at
Rs.4,36,461/- and interest under Section 201(1A) of the Act
at Rs.1,26,028/- totaling to Rs.5,62,489/- for the assessment
years 1999-2000.
5.

The Assessee being aggrieved with the order of the

Assessing Officer filed appeals before the Commissioner of
Income Tax(Appeals), who confirmed the order of the
ITA No.-1174/06

Page 3 of 6

Assessing Officer.

Thereafter the Assessee filed appeals

before the Tribunal.
6.

The Tribunal vide impugned judgment, set aside the

orders

passed

by

the

Commissioner

of

Income

Tax

(Appeals) and allowed appeal filed by the Assessee.
7.

Aggrieved against the order of the Tribunal, Revenue

has come in appeal before this Court.
8.

It has been argued by the learned counsel for the

Revenue that the Assessing Officer in his order under
Section 201 of the Act has categorically established that
the Assessee has sold the assets at less than the market
price and these findings are based on the documents
produced by the Assessee himself. Further, the Assessee
did not place any material on record to show that the
market value of the items is the same at which these items
have been sold to its employees.
9.

On the other hand, it has been argued by the learned

counsel for the Assessee that no perquisite was involved in
disposing of the assets by the Assessee to its employees at
less than written down value, as the Assessing Officer has
not brought any material on record to show that the market
ITA No.-1174/06

Page 4 of 6

prices of the assets at which the Assessee sold these items
to its employees, was less than the fair market price.
10.

It is not in dispute that the employer has to deduct

TDS on the estimated salary in terms of Section 192 of the
Act. The Revenue has not placed any material on record to
show that the Assessee had sold the cars and other items to
its employees at less than the fair market price prevailing
at that time.

The only plea taken by the Revenue to

compute the perquisite value in the hands of the employees
of the Assessee is that the written down value of these
assets was higher than the sale price by the Assessee.
There is no substance in the plea of the Revenue that if the
items are sold by the Assessee at a lesser price than the
written down value and in the absence of any material
available on record that the sale price is less than the
market price at that moment, the difference could be
treated as perquisite in the hands of the employees.
11.

Under the circumstances, we find no reason to

disagree with the findings of the Tribunal that the Assessee
could not be held to be in default of short deduction of TDS
under Section 201 read with Section 192 of the Act and as
ITA No.-1174/06

Page 5 of 6

such the question of charging interest under Section
201(1A) of the Act does not arise.
12.

The above being the position, no fault can be found

with the view taken by the Tribunal. Thus, the order of the
Tribunal does not give rise to a question of law, much less a
substantial question of law, to fall within the limited
purview of Section 260-A of the Act, which is confined to
entertaining only such appeals against the order which
involves a substantial question of law.
13.

So, under these circumstances, the question of

penalty under Section 271C of the Act for deduction of tax
does not arise, the Tribunal, thus, rightly cancelled the
penalty imposed by the Assessee.
14.

Accordingly, the present appeals filed by the Revenue

are, hereby, dismissed.
