1.

By an order passed on 18th July, 2005, in this case, issue

no.2, to the effect as to whether the suit is without any cause of
action as the suit amount stands already paid by the defendant,
has been directed to be issued as a preliminary issue. Learned
counsel for the parties contended that this issue can be heard on
the basis of the documents filed by them. Accordingly, learned
counsel for the parties have been heard on this issue.
2.

In order to adjudicate on this issue, it is necessary to notice

CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 1 of 20

certain essential facts giving rise to the filing of the suit. The
plaintiff M/s Motiwala Industries Limited, filed the present suit
seeking recovery of Rs.39,51,980/- with pendente lite and future
interest. According to the plaintiff, the defendant no.1, which is
also a partnership concern, had placed orders for supply of quality
of glass beads on the plaintiff. This supply had commenced on or
about 2nd September, 1999.

As per the plaint, this supply

continued till 11th February, 2000 and was for a total value of
Rs.40,75,156/-

The plaintiff raised regular invoices on the

defendants in respect of these supplies which have been placed on
record. The plaintiff contends that the last payment which had
been received from the defendants was on 31st March, 2000 for a
sum of Rs.9,43,421/- leaving the balance due of Rs.31,31,915/towards the goods sold, supplied and delivered to the defendants.
The plaintiff has claimed that on account of failure of the
defendants to pay this amount, it is also entitled to interest at the
rate of 24% which is the normal commercial rate. Consequently,
the plaintiff claims interest at the rate of 24% from 2nd
September, 1999 to 31st October, 2000 being a sum of
Rs.8,20,065/- on the above amount. It is further contended that
the plaintiff has served a legal notice dated 2nd September, 2000
CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 2 of 20

on the defendants to which it has received no reply. A cheque
dated 5th September, 2000 for the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- issued
by the defendants in respect of the afore-stated payment, is stated
to have been returned dishonoured by the bank with the advice
“payment stopped by the drawer”. In these circumstances, the
plaintiff has filed the present suit on 12th December, 2000
seeking recovery of Rs.39,51,980/-.
3.

The defendants appeared in the suit after service on 11th

April, 2001. On the 4th March, 2002, counsel for the defendant
nos.1(a) & 1(b) made a statement which was recorded by this court
to the effect that the entire claim in the suit has already been paid
to the plaintiff and that a plea in this regard has been taken in the
written statement. Counsel for the plaintiff then sought time to
file the replication. Despite repeated opportunities, no replication
has been filed and consequently, right to file the replication to the
written statement filed by the defendants was closed on 21st
January, 2004. In the light of the arguments led by the parties, it
would be useful to notice the fact that time to file the replication
was given to the plaintiff on 27th August, 2002, 8th November,
2002, 21st March, 2003 and 4th September, 2003 before it was
closed on 21st January, 2004.

The defendants had filed a written statement after service of

the advance copies of the plaint on 24th April, 2001 taking the
following plea:“That the present suit is not maintainable in as
much as there is no cause of action against the
answering Defendants.
The Plaintiff has
concealed from this Hon'ble Court the material
and relevant facts. It is in order to place the true
facts that Defendant No.1 states that the alleged
suit amount of Rs.31,31,915/- (Rupees Thirty One
Lac Thirty One Thousand Nine Hundred Fifteen
Only) is not outstanding against the answering
Defendant No.1 as alleged in as much as the said
amount was duly paid by the Defendant No.1 by
way of cheques dated 14.09.2000 for
Rs.5,00,000/-(Rupees
Five
Lacs
Only),
19.09.2000 for Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lacs
Only), 26.09.2000 for Rs.5,19,051/- (Rupees Five
Lacs Nineteen Thousand Fifty One Only),
04.10.2000 for 5,46,584/- (Rupees Five Lacs
Forty Six Thousand Five Hundred Five Hundred
Eight Four Only) and 20.10.2000 for
Rs.5,66,280/- (Rupees Five Lacs Sixty Six
Thousand
Two
Hundred
Eighty
Only)
aggregating to Rs.31,31,915/- Thirteen One Lacs
Thirty One Thousand Nine Hundred Fifteen
Only). It is further stated that the aforesaid
cheques were cleared at the first instance and
amount paid to the credit of the Plaintiff. It is
strange that the Plaintiff has in spite of the
payment of still chosen to institute the present
Suit. The suit is on the face of it false, fictitious
and there is no cause of action. The plaint is,
thus, liable to be rejected and/or Suit is liable to
be dismissed.”
5.

Along with the written statement, the defendants have filed

CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 4 of 20

several documents in support of their plea that they have made
payment towards the bills and invoices raised by the plaintiff in
respect of which the present suit has been filed.
6.

In this behalf, my attention has been drawn firstly to the

particulars of the invoices and the bills raised by the plaintiff
which have been relied upon by the plaintiff. Along with the
plaint on the 12th December, 2000, the plaintiff has purported to
file an extract of its ledger account for the period 1st April, 1999 to
31st March, 2000. It is noteworthy that the last entry in this
ledger account is dated 31st March, 2000 and reflects a credit
entry of Rs.9,43,241/-. No other credit entry has been shown for
the period 2nd September, 1999 to 30th March, 2000.
The defendants against this have filed an extract of their
supplier ledger for the period 1st April, 1999 to 31st March, 2000.
With regard to the bill numbers, the ledger folder extract of the
plaintiff tallies with the ledger extract filed by the defendants.
However, the ledger entries in the account filed by the defendants
reflect several payments which have not found mention by the
plaintiff.

admitted on behalf of the plaintiff and has been marked as Ex. DCS (OS) No.2833/2000

10.
7.

In further support of the contention that the invoices and

bills in respect of the supplies made by the plaintiff, the
defendants have effected full payment thereof, the defendants
have also filed a letter dated 26th December, 2001 addressed by
the plaintiff to the defendants, giving particulars of the bill
numbers, the date thereof and the amount. The plaintiff made a
demand on the defendants of the form ST-I in respect of these
supplies made by it.

This letter also stands admitted by the

plaintiff in the admission/denial of the documents and has been
marked as ex. D-14.
8.

It would be useful to set out the extracts of these three

documents which would show the facts which stand admitted and
established on record.

In realisation of the fact that it stood cornered, it appears

that the plaintiff filed further documents in September, 2004
wherein the afore-noticed payments made by the defendants have
been included.

However, the plaintiff has couched this as an

extract of ledger account for the period 1st April, 2000 to 31st
March, 2001 which is in contradiction with letter dated 26th
December, 2001 wherein the plaintiff has admitted receipts of the
payments and wherein the same payments have been reflected

CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 9 of 20

against the bills which are the subject matter of the suit.
10.

I find that after receipt of the summons in the suit, the

defendants have addressed a letter dated 3rd April, 2001 to the
plaintiff wherein it notified thus:-

11.

“We are totally taken aback on your going to
court with misconstrued facts about non-payment
of your pending amount of Rs.31,31,915.00. We
have not only cleared this amount through
cheques dt.14/9, 19/9, 26/9, 4/10, 13/10 & 20/10
but our accounts department finds upon
reconciliation that there is a credit of
Rs.3,43,500/- lying as advance. As you are aware
of the fact that we had been totally indisposed due
to the function in the family, the court notice has
come as shock to us. Our legal department shall
be taking care of this now.”
No dispute was raised to these contentions of the

defendants. On the contrary, the plaintiff by a letter dated 16th
April, 2001, informed its counsel that the letter dated 3rd April,
2001 was “self-explanatory” and required the counsel for the
plaintiff to do the needful. The communication dated 3rd April,
2001 has been admitted as having been received by the plaintiff.
The letter dated 16th April, 2001 has been admitted by the
plaintiff and has been marked as ex. D-12. From a perusal of the
Ex. D-12, it is apparent that the plaintiff accepted the receipt of
the contention of the defendants as contained in the letter dated
3rd April, 2001 and had intimated its counsel to take action in the
CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 10 of 20

matter accordingly.
12.

I find that in the plaint which was filed on 12th December,

2000, the plaintiff has concealed the fact that it had received
several amounts from the defendants between the 14th December,
1999 and 23rd November, 2000. From the ledger statements filed
by the defendants on record which stand admitted by the plaintiff,
it appears that the plaintiff has received a sum of Rs.34,35,000/from the defendants between this period. Even the extracts of the
ledger account, as filed by the plaintiff before this court, records
receipt of payment of these amounts, yet in the plaint, in paras 7 &
8, the plaintiff on 12th December, 2000 stated thus:“7. That the defendant also from time to time
made diverse payments the last of which was
made on 31.3.2000 for a sum of Rs.9,43,241/-.
The total payments thus made by the defendant
against the total supplies made, was for a sum
of Rs.9,43,241/-.

13.

8.
That after giving all adjustments against
payments received now remains a sum of
Rs.31,31,915/- as outstanding towards the goods
sold, supplied and delivered to the defendants.”
In my view, in the light of the above, the plaintiff has failed

to disclose material facts which it was bound to have done so.
From the above, the admitted position is that the suit has been
filed in respect of the amount to which it is not entitled, having

CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 11 of 20

received the amounts in regard to which it had raised invoices
upon the defendants. There is no dispute to the averments made
in the plaint by any replication in accordance with law.
14.

The plaintiff has not disputed the averments made by the

defendant in the letter dated 3rd of April 2001. On the contrary, by
its letter of 16th April, 2001, it has requested its counsel to take
appropriate action in the suit in the light of the statement made by
the plaintiff in view of the credit balance in favour of the
defendants in the communication sent on 3rd April, 2001. I find
that there is, therefore, substance in the objections raised by the
defendants.
15.

I may also notice that the plaintiff has also admitted receipt

of the amount stated by the defendants in the rejoinder filed by it
in IA No.13185/2000 in February, 2005, though a vague plea has
been taken that the same is against supplies effected after the
supplies, the non-payment of which is the subject matter of the
present suit. It is evident that this plea has been set up as a cover
up for the concealment by the plaintiff. Certainly, no prudent
businessman would effect supplies to a party which had failed to
pay over Rs.30,00,000/- for earlier supplies in respect of which
the present suit stood filed by the plaintiff.
CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 12 of 20

16.

The principles with regard to the action to be taken by a

court in the event of failure to disclose material facts, are well
settled. In AIR 1994 SC 853 S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu
(dead) by L.Rs. Vs. Jagannath (dead) by L.Rs. & ORS., it
was held by the Supreme Court that such a plaintiff would deserve
to be non-suited and the suit deserves to be dismissed at any stage
of the proceedings. In the instant case, there can be no manner of
doubt that the factum relating to receipt of payments by the
plaintiff from the defendants was a material fact which the
plaintiff was bound to disclose in the plaint. It has failed to do so
and has continued to pursue the suit despite the written statement
having been filed as back as on 9th May, 2001.
17.

However, at the time of framing of issues in the case on 18th

July, 2005, this court has framed the following issue:
“Whether the suit is without any cause of action as
the suit amount stands already paid by the
defendant?”
It was also directed that this issue be treated as a
preliminary issue.
18.

It becomes necessary to examine the statutory provisions

which are concerned with suits which are filed without cause of
action. Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure specifically
CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 13 of 20

deals with such a contingency. The relevant extract thereof reads
thus:“11. Rejection of plaint- The plaint shall be
rejected in the following cases:(a)
action;

where it does not disclose a cause of

(b) where the relief claimed is undervalued,
and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to
correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the
court, fails to do so;
(c) where the relief claimed is properly
valued but the plaint is written upon paper
insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff, on being
required by the Court to supply the requisite stamppaper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to
do so;
(d) where the suit appears from the statement
in the plaint to be barred by any law;
(e)

19.

where it is not filed in duplicate;

(f) where the plaintiff fails to comply with the
provisions of rule 9.”
In the light of the issue as stands framed, this court would

be required to proceed under the provisions of Order 7 Rule 11 of
the Code of Civil Procedure. It is well settled that cause of action
is that bundle of facts which would be required to be adjudicated
upon in order to decide on the claim made by the parties. In this
behalf, reference may be made to a recent judgment reported at

CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 14 of 20

(2004) 6 SCC 254 entitled Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd. vs
Union of India & Anr. the Apex Court has considered this issue
further and held thus :-

20.

“26. The view taken by this Court in U.P.
Rashtriya Chini Mill Adhikari Parishad that the
situs of issue of an order or notification by the
Government would come within the meaning of
the expression “cases arising” in clause 14 of the
(Amalgamation) Order is not a correct view of
law for the reason hereafter stated and to that
extent the said decision is overruled. In fact, a
legislation, it is trite, is not confined to a statute
enacted by Parliament or the legislature of a
State, which would include delegated legislation
and subordinate legislation or an executive order
made by the Union of India, State or any other
statutory authority. In a case where the field is
not covered by any statutory rule, executive
instructions issued in this behalf shall also come
within the purview thereof. Situs of office of
Parliament, legislature of a State or authorities
empowered to make subordinate legislation
would not by itself constitute any cause of action
or cases arising. In other words, framing of a
statute, statutory rule or issue of an executive
order or instruction would not confer jurisdiction
upon a court only because of the situs of the
office of the maker thereof.”
Learned counsel for the plaintiff has contended that the

plaintiff has not made any admission with regard to the receipt of
the amount in the pleadings. Reliance has been placed on several
judicial pronouncements. It is contended that the issue involved
has a mixed question of law and fact and deserves to be proved by

CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 15 of 20

leading evidence.

In this behalf, reliance has been placed on

pronouncement of in this court in AIR 1980 Delhi 121
Bhupinder Kamal & Anr. Vs. The New Delhi Municipal
Committee. In this case, the plaintiff had sought the prohibitory
injunction with regard to a demand of tax by the authority from it.
An issue was framed that on account of the payment of tax, the
suit had been rendered infructious. In the light of the claim made
by the plaintiff, the suit could not have been disposed of on the
basis of the issue which was treated as a preliminary issue. It is
noteworthy that this judgment does not laid down any absolute
principle of law which would prohibit adjudication in the instant
case.
21.

Same is the position with regard to the short note relied on

by the plaintiff reported at AIR 1983 NOC 62 (Orissa) B.N.
Dash & Ors. Vs. Bijay Ketan Mohanty. In this case also, the
court has held that it would be necessary to examine the facts of
the case to treat an issue as a preliminary issue of law only.
22.

In AIR 1985 Punjab & Haryana 184 Daljit Singh Vs.

Joginder Singh Sekhon cited on behalf of the plaintiff, it was
held by the court that if the parties wanted to lead any evidence on
an issue, that ceases to be an issue of law. There can be no dispute
CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 16 of 20

with the legal proposition that a mixed issue of law and fact
cannot be considered as a preliminary issue. However, the court
clearly noticed that discretion has been given to the court to try an
issue as a preliminary issue, depending strictly on the facts and
circumstances of each case.
23.

In the instant case, the parties have placed reliance strictly

on the pleadings and the documents which have been admitted in
the admission/denial of the documents recorded by them on the
documents and the other side.
24.

It would be useful to refer to the adjudication of the Apex

Court in an judgment reported at (2000) 7 SCC 120 Uttam
Singh Duggal Vs. United Bank of India & Ors. wherein the
court was called upon to consider the contention of the plaintiff
that it was entitled to decree on admission under Order 12 Rule 6
of the CPC based on the balance sheet of the plaintiff and the
defendants.

In this behalf, before the Supreme Court, the

plaintiffs (who were defendants in the suit) had contended that
admission under Order 12 Rule 6 has to be confined to the
pleadings of the parties; that the fact of the admission can also
only be considered upon the trial of the main suit and that the
admissions, in any case, have to be read along with Order 8 Rule 5
CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 17 of 20

(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The Apex Court rejected

contention of the defendants in this case and held that once a
claim is admitted, the court could have jurisdiction to pass a
decree on the admitted claim. In this case, the court read the
statements in the pleadings along with the statements made in the
proceedings of the Board of Directors and the letter sent, and held
that the same amounted to unambiguous and clear admissions
with regard to the disputes which was before the court.
25.

Before this court, there is no denial to the assertion of the

defendants in the written statement. On the contrary, the plaintiff
has admitted the documents filed by the defendants in support
and has itself filed before this court documents evidencing receipt
of the payments. The plaintiff has instructed its counsel to take
appropriate steps in the matter by a letter dated 16th April, 2001 in
the light of its having received the payments as detailed in the
defendants' letter dated 3rd April, 2001.
26.

I have, therefore, no manner of doubt that the plaintiff has

filed the instant suit without their being any cause of action and
cannot be continued with in the light of the provisions of Order 7
Rule 11 (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The suit has been filed
in respect of the amounts which have already been paid by the
CS (OS) No.2833/2000

Page 18 of 20

defendants. The suit is thus clearly without cause of action. The
plaint is, therefore, hereby rejected.
27.

I also find that the written statement was filed on 28th

February, 2001. The matter has remained pending ever since.
Admission/denial has been required to be recorded and issues
have even been framed.

As back as on 16th April, 2001, the

plaintiff admitted the receipt of the payments in its letter to its
counsel and had issued instructions to him to take steps but has
failed to implement the same.
28.

The plaintiff has also concealed material facts when it filed

the suit before this court in the plaint as noticed above. In these
circumstances, I am of the view that the plaintiff deserves to be
burdened with heavy costs for filing and persisting with the
present suit. Accordingly, the plaint is rejected. The plaintiff is
burdened with costs of Rs.25,000/-. Out of this sum, the plaintiff
shall pay a sum of Rs.15,000/- to the defendants and the balance
sum of Rs.10,000/- shall be paid in equal shares to the Delhi High
Court Legal Services Committee and the National Legal Aid Fund
(NALSA). The costs shall be deposited and paid within a period of
four weeks from today. Proof of deposit of costs shall be filed in
this court.
