ANIL KUMAR, J.
1.

This is an application by the respondent no.1/workman under

Section 17 B of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking direction to the
petitioner management to pay the back wages.

2.

The services of respondent no.1/workman were terminated on

16th June, 1992 by the petitioner management. The respondent
no.1/workman has categorically stated that since the date of his
CM No.3086/2007 in WP(C) 7511 of 2007

Page 1 of 8

termination, he has never been employed in any establishment for any
period of time and facing great difficulty to meet both ends and is totally
dependent on his family members and other relatives for his livelihood.
The respondent no.1/workman submitted that he is entitled to wages at
the rate last drawn by him from the date of his termination by the
petitioner under section 17B of the Industrial Dispute Act.

3.

The petitioner has filed reply to the application, denying the

averments made by the respondent no.1/ workman by stating that the
application under section 17B of the Industrial Dispute Act is not
maintainable on the ground that no award was passed but there was an
Order under section 33 (2) (b) of the I.D.Act rejecting the approval
application and the said Order did not grant any reinstatement to the
workman. The petitioner in support of his contention referred to the
decision of the Division Bench of this Hon’ble Court in Shri Sardar
Singh Vs. DTC & Ors., LPA No. 361/2002. It was also submitted by the
petitioner that the reliefs prayed by the respondent does not fall within
the purview of the relief which can be granted under section 17B of the
I.D.Act, 1947, as this section does not talks about the back wages but
states only last drawn wages during the pendency of the proceedings.
The petitioner denied the contention of the respondent no.1 that he is
unemployed. The petitioner prayed for the leave of this Hon’ble Court to
make detailed submissions at the time of the arguments. An affidavit
has also been

filed of the Regional Manager in support of the pleas

CM No.3086/2007 in WP(C) 7511 of 2007

taken in the reply.

4.

Though an award reinstating the respondent no.1 has not been

passed, but the application of the petitioner under Section 33 (2) (b) of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 was dismissed by order dated 22nd
January, 2002 holding that the petitioner has failed to prove that the
respondent no.1 committed misconduct and therefore, approval to the
action of the petitioner to remove the respondent no.1 from service
under clause 15(2)(vi) of the DRTA (Conditions of Appointment of
Service) Regulations Act, 1952 was rejected. If the approval application
of the petitioner has been dismissed, the respondent no.1 could not be
removed from the service and he was entitled for reinstatement. The
said order was challenged by the petitioner and the operation of said
order was stayed by this Court by order dated 25th November, 2002.
Consequently the respondent no.1 has not been able to get himself
reinstated.

5.

A full bench of this Court in (2005) III- LLJ Delhi 390 in the

matter of Delhi Transport Corporation Vs Jagdish Chander had held
that the provision of section 17 B of the Act will be applicable to the writ
petition filed against the order passed on the application of the
management under section 33 (2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947. Referring to various decisions, the full Court had held that the
emphasis of the legislature in Section 17B was on the expression
CM No.3086/2007 in WP(C) 7511 of 2007

Page 3 of 8

`reinstatement’ rather than on award and cumulative effect of Sections
2(b) and 2(k) defining award and `industrial dispute’ demonstrated that
the expressions has been widely worded to take within their ambit
duties relatable to any person who satisfied the conditions stated
therein. Consequently the plea of the petitioner that the provision of
section 17B are not available to the respondent no.1 since there is no
award, is not sustainable and is rejected holding that the respondent
no.1 is entitled for the benefit of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 provided he is unemployed.

6.

Granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing orders

directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule; refusing to
grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as it could be passed
only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional error where there is
no relationship between the parties. In the present case the this has not
been disputed that there is relationship of employee and employer
between the petitioner and the applicant While considering an
application under this provision it is necessary to bear in mind that the
spirit, intendment and object underlying the statutory provision of
Section 17B, is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship
resulting to a workman due to delay in the implementation of the
consequence of dismissal of the application of the petitioner resulting
into reinstatement of his services on account of the challenge made to it
by the employer. The preliminary consideration for making available
CM No.3086/2007 in WP(C) 7511 of 2007

Page 4 of 8

such a relief to a workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of
the enactment. It recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to
keep body and soul together when a challenge has been made to the
order passed by the Labor Court. The statutory provisions provide no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment which is required to be
made by the employer to the workman has been held to be akin to a
subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor recoverable from
a workman even if the petitioner is allowed by the High Court. In 1999
(2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex
Court was of the view that the object under Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the
hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay in
implementation of the Award. The practice of disposal of the petition as
well as the application under Section 17B of the Act contemporaneously
was deprecated and the High Court was directed to first expeditiously
dispose of the application under Section 17B by the Supreme Court by
its decision reported at VII (2000) SLT 70=JT 2000 (8) SC 501,
Workmen Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Hindustan
Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. & Ors.

7.

Since the section itself mentions ‘employment in establishment’

self employment quite apparently is not in contemplation. Workman
can be denied the benefits under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes
CM No.3086/2007 in WP(C) 7511 of 2007

Page 5 of 8

Act only when it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the
workmen have been employed and have been receiving adequate
remuneration during the period of pendency of the writ petition. It is
thus well settled that transient employment by the workman does not
affect his entitlement to receive wages pending decision; that is to say
that, the benefit of Section 17B of the Act cannot be denied merely
because the workman is engaged in some activity or in some vocation to
eke out his livelihood. Such relief can be denied only if it is proved that
the workman is gainfully employed in some establishment and is
receiving adequate and regular remuneration which is not the case with
the applicant. In the present case the petitioner has not been able to
show that the workman is gainfully employed in any establishment and
the respondent no.1 has contended on affidavit that he is unemployed
since the date of his dismissal from the service.

8.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 entitled Town Municipal, Athani v.
P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman has
a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot
be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act for
enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was concerned with
the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the Court would have a
bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well. From a
CM No.3086/2007 in WP(C) 7511 of 2007

Page 6 of 8

conspectus of the authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court, the
right of a workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified under
the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the
constitutional mandate and nothing more. It is undoubtedly, the bare
minimum which is required by the workman to subsist and is nothing
more. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean all the wages that
have fallen due at least from the date of the order of the Labor Court
dismissing the application of the management under Section 33 (2) (b)
of the Act.

9.

In the present case the workman has categorically averred in the

application that he has been unemployed since the date of his dismissal
and since the date of dismissal of the application of the petitioner till
date. In the facts and circumstances, the applicant fulfills the criteria
for availing the benefit under section 17B of the act and if the requisites
of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are satisfied, no
order can be passed denying the workman the benefit of statutory
provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 in the
present facts and circumstances of the case.

10.

Consequently, the application of the workman/respondent under

Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is allowed and the
petitioner is directed to pay the arrears of last drawn wages or
minimum wages whichever is higher from 22nd January, 2002, the date
CM No.3086/2007 in WP(C) 7511 of 2007

Page 7 of 8

of dismissal of the application of the petitioner under section 33 (2) (b)
of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The arrears be paid within eight
weeks. The petitioner shall continue to pay last drawn wages or
minimum wages whichever is higher by the 15th of every English
Calendar month during the pendency of the writ petition. The
respondent No.1 is also directed to give an undertaking to the effect
that in case the petition is allowed, the difference in last drawn wages
and the minimum wages shall be repaid/refunded within the time as
shall be permitted by this Court. The undertaking by the respondent
No.1 be filed within four weeks.
With these directions, the application is disposed of.
