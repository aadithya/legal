1.

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
A short question arises for consideration. Whether, FIR

in question can be registered at Delhi.

The FIR is numbered

161/2002 which invokes Section 498A/406/34 IPC.

It has been

registered at PS Shalimar Bagh, Delhi.
2.

Neelam Ahlawat the wife of Sanjay Ahlawat and the

daughter in law of the petitioners has stated in her complaint that
she was a permanent resident of Jaipur. That she got married to
Sanjay Ahlawat on 25.2.2001 at Jind.
3.

According to the petitioners no part of cause of action

has accrued at Delhi for the reason the couple never resided at
Delhi. That the petitioners never resided at Delhi.
3.

Section 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as

Crl.M.C. No.874/06

under:-

4.

“Ordinary place of inquiry and trial – Every offence
shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a Court
within whose local jurisdiction it was committed.”
In the decision reported as 2007 (1) SCC (Cri) 336

Manish Ratan & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. & Anr., Hon'ble Supreme
Court has opined that in view of Section 177 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure 1973 territorial jurisdiction would have to be
considered with reference to the place where cause of action
accrued.
5.

One fact needs to be noted.

resided at Jaipur with her parents.

The complainant is

In the FIR address at Delhi

disclosed by her is the residence of her sister.
6.

If the complainant resides in Jaipur and her marriage

took place at Jind, her matrimonial house was in Jind and no
offence was committed at Delhi, I see no reason why the FIR
needs to be investigated at Delhi.
7.

Learned counsel for the petitioner states that he has

no objection if the FIR and record of investigation is directed to be
transferred to Jind, the place where the marriage took place and
the couple resided.
8.

Since entire cause of action accrued at Jind, I dispose

of the petition directing that FIR in question i.e. FIR No. 161/2002
P.S. Shalimar Bagh, Delhi and record of investigation be
transferred to Jind.

Needless to state, if challan has been

presented by the police to a court at Delhi, the challan would be
transmitted to the court of competent jurisdiction at Jind.
