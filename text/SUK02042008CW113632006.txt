SUDERSHAN KUMAR MISRA, J : (Oral)
CM No.15399/2007

1.

This is an application filed by the respondent No.1/

workman under Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act.
Notice of this application was issued on 5th November, 2007 for
28th January, 2008.

On 28th January, 2008, counsel for the

petitioner was granted another two weeks' time to file reply to
this application and the matter was posted for today.
also, the reply is not forthcoming.

Today

However, Mr. J.S. Bhasin,

Advocate for the petitioner, states that he has instructions to the
WP (C ) No.11363/2006

Page 1 of 6

effect that his clients are taking only one objection to the
application.

He states that the petitioner's stand is that the

workman was dismissed on 28th May, 1996 and whilst his client
has no proof to show that the workman had obtained any gainful
employment in the meanwhile or after his dismissal, which
would disentitle him to relief under Section 17-B; at the same
time, it is not possible for any person to remain unemployed for
such a long period and that he must have been earning some
money to survive to provide for his day to day needs.

He

submits that if this Court were to take into consideration the
said avernment, then there is no need for him to file a reply.
2.

A reading of Section 17-B shows that the workman is

entitled to full wages last drawn by him inclusive of any
Maintenance Allowance admissible to him under any rule if the
workman has not been employed in any establishment during
the period of pendency of any proceedings against any award
directing reinstatement of the workman in a High Court or the
Supreme Court, provided that the workman also files an affidavit
to that effect in such a Court. In this case, the impugned award
dated 18th January, 2005 in ID No.168/97 was passed by the
Labour Court. It directed that the workman is entitled to
reinstatement and full back wages from the date of his removal
from service with continuity of service and other consequential
reliefs. This direction has been impugned by the petitioner in the
instant writ petition. On 19th July, 2006, the operation of the
impugned award was stayed by this Court. In his application, the
WP (C ) No.11363/2006

Page 2 of 6

workman has averred that he has been unemployed ever since
his removal. He has also filed a supporting affidavit wherein he
has stated that he is unemployed since his removal and that he
is not employed in any establishment from the date of his
removal till the date of filing of the said affidavit. It is, therefore,
obvious that the requirements of Section 17-B of the Industrial
Disputes Act are fulfilled in this case.
3.

Under that section, the employer is however given an

opportunity of demonstrating that the workman in question has
been employed and that he had been receiving adequate
remuneration during any such period or part thereof when
proceedings against the said award have been pending before
this Court. In case he were to do so, then the workman would
not be entitled to any order for payment of wages under this
Section for such period or part thereof, as the case may be.
However, in this case, the employer has not been able to prove
any such facts which might demonstrate the employment of the
workman whereby the workman can be said to be receiving
adequate remuneration.

The stand is merely based on a

presumption of having been employed for the reason that it is
difficult for an individual to survive for years together without
any source of income. While this may be true, it is also equally
well settled by the Supreme Court in Rajinder Kumar Kindra
Vs. Delhi Administration (1984) 4 SCC 635 and also by this
Court in Taj Services Limited Vs. Industrial Tribunal – I
1999 (82) DLT 378;

Government of NCT of Delhi & Ors. , CM No. 8312/2004 in
WP(C) No.2076/2003 decided on 30.11.2005; to the effect
that

what

the

section

contemplates

is

regular,

gainful

employment and not merely any remuneration or stop gap
sporadic earnings that might have been earned by the workman
with a view to keeping the body and soul together. It has been
repeatedly held that this section, if construed in such a narrow,
literal and pedantic sense, it would lose all its efficacy.
4.

The onus of proof on both the parties, to my mind, is very

different under this section.

Whilst all that is required of a

workman is that he must disclose his state of unemployment on
an affidavit; and once he does that, his onus is discharged. The
necessary presumption with regard to unemployment which
gives rise to his right to relief under this section, would arise
without anything more. However, in the case of the employer,
the requirement is more onerous.

What the employer is

required to do is to prove to the satisfaction of the Court the
existence of certain facts with regard to the receipt of adequate
remuneration by the workman through employment during the
period proceedings are pending in Court.

In other words, the

employer is enjoined to bring positive proof of these facts.
5.

In that view of the matter, the workman is entitled to relief

WP (C ) No.11363/2006

Page 4 of 6

under Section 17-B as prayed. The petitioner is directed to pay
the last drawn wages or the minimum wages, whichever is
higher, from the date of the award, and to continue to pay at the
same rate during the pendency of this petition in this Court, on
or before 10th of each month. However, looking to the ratio of
Dena Bank Vs. Kirtikumar Patel (1999) 2 SCC 106

and

Regional Authority, Dena Bank & Anr. Vs. Ghanshyam
AIR 2001 SC 2270, and in the interest of justice, the workman
is directed to file an undertaking by way of an affidavit to the
effect that in the event of this court deciding the writ petition in
favour of the petitioner, he shall be liable to refund to the
petitioner, any amount paid to him in terms of the present order
over and above the amount he was drawing at the time of his
termination. This affidavit be filed within four weeks from today.
6.

It would be open to the petitioner to allow the workman to

report for duty and to take work from the workman in terms of
the relevant rules, without prejudice to its rights and contentions
in this writ petition. The employer is directed to release the past
dues of the workman calculated from the date of the impugned
award,

within

three

months

on

receiving

the

required

undertaking.

Application is disposed of.

Counsel for the respondent does not wish to press this

application for the time being and states that the contentions
and relief sought in this application may be considered at the

petitioner may file his rejoinder before the next date with an
