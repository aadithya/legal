ANIL KUMAR, J.
1.

This is an application by the respondent/workman under Section

17 B of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking direction to the petitioner
to

pay

full

wages

last

drawn

or

minimum

wages

to

the

respondent/workman from the date of the award, 8th October, 2004 of
the Industrial Tribunal No.-I and during the pendency of the writ
petition.

2.

The respondent/workman contended that he is entitled for last
CM 714/2008 in WP(C) 23835 of 2005

Page 1 of 11

drawn wages or minimum wages from the date of the award till the
decision of the writ petition on the ground that the award dated 8th
October, 2004 directing reinstatement of the workman has been
challenged by the petitioner and the operation of the impugned award
has been stayed by the Court by order dated 4th January, 2006. The
respondent/applicant also contended that he has not been employed in
any

establishment

nor

has

he

been

engaged

with

any

other

employers/firms/companies/establishment. The applicant contended
that he could not secure the same despite best of his efforts till now.
The respondent/applicant also submitted that it is very difficult for him
to maintain himself and his family members who are totally dependent
on him although all efforts are being made by him but he could not
succeed to get an employment and he has no other means of livelihood.
In the circumstances the applicant has prayed that he be paid full
wages with effect from 8th October, 2004 the date of the award during
the pendency of the writ petition. The respondent also filed an affidavit
deposing that he is not gainfully employed in any establishment since
his dismissal.

3.

A reply has been filed on behalf of petitioner/non applicant

denying the all pleas

of the respondent/applicant as stated in his

application under section 17B. The petitioner contended that the
application of the respondent/workman is not maintainable on the
grounds that the applicant was not appointed as an workman by the
CM 714/2008 in WP(C) 23835 of 2005

Page 2 of 11

management but was engaged as an contractor and as per the law the
contractor is not workman and there was no relationship of employer
and employee between the management and the applicant. The
petitioner/non-applicant denied that the workman has made any efforts
to secure some employment. The petitioner/non-applicant alleged that
the applicant has not come with clean hands before this Honb’le Court
as he did not disclosed his residential address i.e. with whom he is
living and how he has survived during his unemployment and how
many persons are dependent upon him. The petitioner denied that the
applicant does not have any means of livelihood. It was contended by
the petitioner that the respondent/applicant has not disclosed as to
whom he has approached for work or employment.

4.

A single Judge of this Court had culled the principles laid down in

various judicial pronouncement for grant of interim relief under Section
17 B of the Act in 134 (2006) DLT 49, Food Craft Instt. Vs Rameshwar
Sharma & anr which are as under:

(i)
An application under Section 17B can be made only in
proceedings wherein an industrial award directing reinstatement
of the workman has been assailed.
(ii) This Court has no jurisdiction not to direct compliance with
the provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act if all
the other conditions precedent for passing an order in terms of
the Section 17B of the Act are satisfied [Re : (1999) 9 SCC 229
entitled Choudhary Sharai v. Executive Engineer, Panchayati Raj
Department & Anr.].
CM 714/2008 in WP(C) 23835 of 2005

Page 3 of 11

(iii)
As the interim relief is being granted in exercise of
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the
High Court can grant better benefits which may be more just and
equitable on the facts of the case than the relief contemplated by
Section 17B. Therefore, dehors the powers of the Court under
Section 17B, the Court can pass an order directing payment of an
amount higher than the last drawn wages to the workman [Re :
(1999) 2 SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kirtikumar T. Patel].
(iv) Such higher amount has to be considered necessary in the
interest of justice and the workman must plead and make out a
case that such an order is necessary in the facts of the case.
(v) The Court can enforce the spirit, intendment and purpose of
legislation that the workman who is to get the wages from the
date of the award till the challenge to the award is finally decided
as per the statement of the objections and reasons of the
Industrial Disputes(Amendment) Act, 1982 by which Section 17B
was inserted in the Act [Re : JT 2001 (Suppl.1) SC 229, Dena
Bank v. Ghanshyam (para 12)].
(vi)
An application under Section 17B should be disposed of
expeditiously and before disposal of the writ petition [Re : 2000
(9) SCC 534 entitled Workman v. Hindustan Vegetable Oil
Corporation Ltd.].
(vii) Interim relief can be granted with effect from the date of the
Award [Re : JT 2001 Supplementary (1) SC entitled Regional
Authority, Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam; 2004 (3) AD (DELHI) 337
entitled Indra Perfumery Company v. Sudarshab Oberoi v.
Presiding Officer].
(viii) Transient employment and self-employment would not be a
bar to relief under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act [Re :
2000 (1) LLJ 1012 entitled Taj Services Limited v. Industrial
Tribunal; 1984 (4) SCC 635 entitled Rajinder Kumar Kundra v.
Delhi Administration; 109 (2004) DLT 1 entitled M/s. Birdhi
Chand Naunag Ram Jain v. P.O., Labour Court No. IV & Others].
(ix) The Court while considering an application under Section
17B of the ID Act cannot go into the merits of the case, the Court
CM 714/2008 in WP(C) 23835 of 2005

Page 4 of 11

can only consider whether the requirements mentioned in Section
17B have been satisfied or not and, if it is so, then the Court has
no option but to direct the employer to pass an order in terms of
the statute. It would be immaterial as to whether the petitioner
had a very good case on merits [Re : 2000 (5) AD Delhi 413
entitled Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander].
(x) A reasonable standard for arriving at the conclusion of the
quantum of a fair amount towards subsistence allowance payable
to a workman would be the minimum wages notified by the
statutory authorities under the provisions of the Minimum Wages
Act, 1948 in respect of an employee who may be performing the
same or similar functions in scheduled employments. [Re:
Rajinder Kumar Kundra v. Delhi Administration, (1984) 4 SCC
635; Sanjit Roy v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1983 SC 328; decision
dated 3rd January, 2003 in Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 3654 &
3675/1999 entitled Delhi Council for Child Welfare v. Union of
India; DTC v. The P.O., Labour Court No. 1, Delhi & Ors., 2002 II
AD (Delhi) 112 (para 12, 13)]
(xi) Interim orders directing payment to a workman can be made
even on the application of the management seeking stay of the
operation and effect of the industrial Award and order. Such
interim orders of stay sought by the employer can be granted
unconditionally or made conditional subject to payment or
deposits of the entire or portion of the awarded amount together
with a direction to the petitioner employer to make payment of
the wages at an appropriate rate to the workman. Such an order
would be based on considerations of interests of justice when
balancing equities.
(xii) For the same reason, I find that there is no prohibition in
law to a direction by the Court to make an order directing
payment of the wages with effect from the date of the Award. On
the contrary, it has been so held in several judgments that this
would be the proper course [Re : Regional Authority, Dena Bank
& Anr. v. Ghanshyam, reported at JT 2001 (Suppl. 1) SC 229 and
Indra Perfumery Co. Thr. Sudershab Oberoi v. Presiding Officer &
Ors., 2004 III AD (Delhi) 337].
(xiii) While passing an interlocutory direction for payment of
CM 714/2008 in WP(C) 23835 of 2005

Page 5 of 11

wages, the Court may also secure the interests of the employer by
making orders regarding refund or recovery of the amount which
is in excess of the last drawn wages in the event of the industrial
award being set aside so as to do justice to the employer.
(xiv) A repayment to the employer could be secured by directing a
workman to given an undertaking or offer security to the
satisfaction of the Registrar (General) of the Court or any other
authority [Re : para 12, 2002 (61) DRJ 521 (DB), Hindustan
Carbide Pvt. Ltd. v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Ors.(supra)]
(xv) In exercise of powers under Article 226 and Article 136 of the
Constitution, if the requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 are satisfied, no order can be passed denying
the workman the benefit granted under the statutory provisions
of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 [Re: 1999 (2)
SCC 106, Dena Bank v. Kirtikumar T. Patel (para 23)].
(xvi) Gainful employment of the workman; unreasonable and
unexplained delay in making the application by the workman
after the filing of the petition challenging the award/order; offer
by the employer to give employment to the workman would be a
relevant factors and consideration for the date from which the
wages are to be permitted.
(xvii)It will be in the interest of justice to ensure if the facts of the
case so justify, that payment of the amount over and above the
amount which could be directed to be paid under Section 17B to
a workman, is ordered to be paid only on satisfaction of terms
and conditions as would enable the employer to recover the same
[para 13 of Regional Manager, Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam].
(xviii)The same principles would apply to any interim order in
respect of a pendente lite payment in favour of the workman.

It cannot be disputed that the provisions of Section 17 B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 comes into operation when an Award
directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further proceedings.
The statute requires satisfaction of the following four conditions:
CM 714/2008 in WP(C) 23835 of 2005

Page 6 of 11

(i)
an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal
directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed in proceedings
in a High Court or the Supreme Court;
(ii)
during the pendency of such proceedings, employer is
required to pay full wages to the workman;
(iii)
the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full wages last
drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance admissible
to him under any Rule;
(iv)
such wages would be admissible only if the workman had
not been employed in any establishment during such period and
an affidavit had been filed to such effect.

5.

While considering an application under this provision it is

necessary to bear in mind that the spirit, intendment and object
underlying the statutory provision of Section 17B is to mitigate and
relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship resulting to a workman due to
delay in the implementation of an award directing reinstatement of his
services on account of the challenge made to it by the employer. The
preliminary consideration for making available such a relief to a
workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment. It
recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body
and soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award
directing his reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment which is required to be
made by the employer to the workman has been held to be akin to a
subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor recoverable from
CM 714/2008 in WP(C) 23835 of 2005

Page 7 of 11

a workman even if the Award in his favor is set aside by the High Court.
In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the
Apex Court was of the view that the object under Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the
hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay in
implementation of the Award.

6.

While considering an application under Section 17B of the

Industrial Disputes Act, the Court cannot go into the merits of the case
in the writ petition. It was so held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD
(Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander. Since the section itself
mentions

‘employment

in

establishment’

self

employment

quite

apparently is not in contemplation. Workman can be denied the
benefits under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act only when it
is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the workmen has been
employed and has been receiving adequate remuneration during the
period of pendency of the writ petition. It is thus well settled that
transient employment by the workman does not affect his entitlement to
receive wages pending decision; that is to say that, the benefit of
Section 17B of the Act cannot be denied merely because the workman is
engaged in some activity or in some vocation to eke out his livelihood.
Such relief can be denied only if it is proved that the workman is
gainfully employed in some establishment and is receiving adequate

CM 714/2008 in WP(C) 23835 of 2005

Page 8 of 11

and regular remuneration which is not the case with the applicant.

7.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51, Town Municipal, Athani v. P.O. LC
Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman has a legal
right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot be
diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act for
enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was concerned with
the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the Court would have a
bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well. From a
conspectus of the authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court, the
right of a workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified under
the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the
constitutional mandate and nothing more. It is undoubtedly, the bare
minimum which is required by the workman to subsist and is nothing
more. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean all the wages that
have fallen due at least from the date of the Award. This also cannot be
disputed that granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing
orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule;
refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as it could be
passed only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional error where
there is no relationship between the parties.

8.

In the present case all the requirements under Section 17B of the

I.D. Act have been satisfied. The award impugned by the petitioner has
held that there is relation of employer and employee between the
parties. At the time of consideration of this application, prima facie this
Court will not go into merits of the case raised by the petitioner. In the
circumstances, the respondent/applicant shall be entitled to benefit
under section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

9.

For

the

foregoing

reasons,

the

application

of

the

respondent/applicant under section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 is allowed. The petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages
or minimum wages whichever is higher from the date of the award, i.e.,
8th October, 2004. Arrears of last drawn wages or the minimum wages,
whichever is higher, be paid within eight weeks. The petitioner shall
continue to pay the last drawn wages or minimum wages, whichever is
higher, by 15th of every English calendar month during the pendency of
the present writ petition. The respondent is also directed to file an
undertaking that in case the writ petition is allowed, the respondent
shall refund/repay the difference of last drawn wages and minimum
wages within the time as shall be permitted by this Court. The
undertaking by the respondent be filed within four weeks.
