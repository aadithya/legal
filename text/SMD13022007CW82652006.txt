ORDER
S.Muralidhar, J. (open court)
1.

The prayer in this writ petition is for a writ of mandamus to the

respondent-DDA to revive the allotment of flat no. 257, Pocket C-1,
Sector 17, Ground Floor, Rohini in favour of the petitioner and issue a
demand cum allotment letter in respect of the said flat in question in
favour of the petitioner.

2.

The facts in brief are that the petitioner got registered in 1989

under the Ambedkar Awas Yojna, 1989 for allotment of an LIG Flat by
WP(C) 8265/2006

page no 1 of 5

depositing a sum of Rs.8,000/- and was given a priority number. The
draw was held on 15.10.2004 and the petitioner was allotted a flat
bearing No. 372, (Third Floor), Sector A-10, Pocket VI, Group 3,
Narela,

on cash down basis. This allotment was given by mistake

since it was a case of double allotment, the flat having been allotted to
some other person.

It is stated that DDA thereafter included the

petitioner's name in the general draw held on 1.7.2005 in which the
petitioner was held successful and flat bearing No. 257, Pocket C-1,
Sector 17, Ground Floor, Rohini was allotted to the petitioner.

3.

On coming to know of the said allotment, the petitioner wrote to

the DDA on 9.12.2005 and 3.1.2006 requesting for issuance of
demand letter in respect of the said flat in Rohini. In response thereto,
the petitioner

received

the demand-cum-allotment letter

dated

22.12.2005 in respect of flat bearing no. 588 (Third Floor), Sector A10, Pocket 6 at Narela. The petitioner wrote back to the DDA stating
that since his name was included in the general draw and he was
allotted a flat in Rohini, whereas the demand letter received by him
pertained to the flat in Narela, he should be issued a demand letter in
respect of the flat in Rohini.

4.

The reply filed by the DDA to the writ petition basically relies

WP(C) 8265/2006

page no 2 of 5

upon the first two paragraphs of a policy of the DDA expressed in an
Office Order dated 12.6.2001 which reads as under:
“Vide office order no. F2(10)2001/Coordn/[H]1145 dated 27.3.2001, we have
issued the policy regarding how and where to
allot flat to an allottee whose allotment was
cancelled earlier and was restored. It was
decided that wherever there is DDA's fault
due to which cancellation took place and later
restoration was resorted to the flat would be
allotted by way of a restricted draw giving the
alternative flat in the same locality and floor
to the allottee or legal heirs.
In case, where the cancellation has taken
place due to fault of the allottee, then in such
cases of restoration a fresh allotment would
be given that is by including all flats available
in that category in all localities at that point
of time.”
5.

Ms. Richa Kapoor, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

submits that the policy of 2001 cannot have any implication in the
present case where even the first allotment was a mistake and there
was no question of that allotment in Narela determining the area and
locality where the petitioner was to be allotted a flat. She submits
that having included the name of the petitioner in the general draw on
1.7.2005 and having made an allotment to him of a flat in Rohini, it is
not open to the DDA to unilaterally change the location to Narela.

6.

In reply, Mr. Anil Sapra, learned counsel appearing for the DDA

states that since there is no challenge to the policy dated 12.6.2001
WP(C) 8265/2006

page no 3 of 5

and as long as the DDA has acted in accordance with that policy and
made an allotment in favour of the petitioner in Narela, no fault can
be found at the DDA.

7.

In a similar situation, a learned Single Judge of this Court in

WP(C) 12893 of 2005 by an order dated 28.2.2006 held that an
applicant would be entitled to allotment of the same flat, which was
allotted as a result of a general draw held by the DDA consequent
upon the rectification of an earlier erroneous allotment.

In the

instant case since the allotment of the flat in question at Narela was
clearly a double allotment that could not be determinative of the
location of the flat. Further, if indeed, the DDA was following the
policy of 2001, it should have held only a restricted draw by way of
giving an alternative flat. However, it is not dispute in the present
case that the petitioner's name was included in a general draw held
on 1.7.2005. As a result thereof, the allotment of a flat in favour of
the petitioner was made in Rohini. Having included the name of the
petitioner in the general draw and having allotted the flat in Rohini, it
was not open to the respondent-DDA to unilaterally change the
locality particularly where the petitioner had not sought for such
change. The policy of 2001 does not compel the DDA to unilaterally
change the location of a flat that has been allotted pursuant to a

WP(C) 8265/2006

page no 4 of 5

general draw of lots, as in the present case. No other reasons have
been given by the DDA as to why the petitioner could not be issued
the demand letter for a flat at Rohini.

Following the order dated

28.2.2006 of the learned Single Judge in WP(C) 12893 of 2005, it is
held that the petitioner is entitled to be charged the cost prevalent on
the date of the draw held on 1.7.2005.

8.

Accordingly, the writ petition succeeds. A writ of mandamus is

issued to the respondent-DDA to
Rohini of the same size

revive the allotment of a flat at

in favour of the petitioner at the cost

prevalent on the date of general draw held on 1.7.2005. The DDA is
directed to issue a demand-cum-allotment letter within a period of
four weeks from today.

9.

Writ petition is accordingly allowed with no orders as to costs.

The application is disposed of.
