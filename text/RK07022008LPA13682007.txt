DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ. (ORAL)

1.

We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties on this appeal,

which was filed by the appellants being aggrieved by the order dated 5 th
November, 2007 passed by the learned Single Judge allowing the writ petition of
the respondents.
2.

We have gone through the impugned order. The learned Single Judge in

view of pendency of the appeal before the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals)
under Section 128 of the Act, that is, the Customs Act, made an observation that
the appellant should not take any further action upon the impugned show cause

notice issued by the appellant and make any final order. It was also observed by
the learned Single Judge that the continuation and resumption of the proceedings
based on the show cause notice would be guided by the final order of the Tribunal.
The said order of the Commissioner of Appeals has since been passed and
communicated, a copy of which is placed on our record. A perusal of the said
order indicates that the order has been passed partly in favour of the respondents
and also partly in favour of the appellant.
3.

Since the appellate authority has now disposed of the aforesaid appeal, we

are of the considered opinion that it shall be open to the respondents now to file a
reply to the show cause notice, which was issued. It is also brought to our notice
that other appeals filed by the respondents are pending before the appellate
authority, being Appeal Nos.79/08 and 80/08. We are also informed that the said
appeals are being listed for consideration before the appellate authority on 27th
February, 2008. The appellate authority while taking a decision on the show
cause notice issued would not only take into consideration the contentions of the
respondents in the reply to be filed, but would also consider the effect of the order
dated 31.12.2007 passed by the appellate authority and also the order, if any,
passed by the appellate authority on 27th February, 2008 and give due weightage
thereof. In case the respondents are still aggrieved by the final order to be passed
by the appellate authority in terms of the aforesaid show cause notice, it shall be
open to the respondents to take recourse to the remedy as available to the
respondents in terms of the law immediately thereafter.
4.

In terms of the aforesaid order, LPA 1368/2007 and CM No.16793/2007

stand disposed of. We make it clear that the order passed by the learned Single
Judge was passed only for the purpose of deciding the aforesaid writ petition and

the observations made therein shall have no effect on the merit of the allegations
made in the show cause notice issued by the appellants for cancellation of the
licence.
