Per Thakur, J :
Judicial

review

of

administrative

decisions

is

limited

to

examining whether the decision making process is vitiated by any
illegality, procedural irregularity or perversity. The Court does not sit
in appeal over the decision so long as the process leading to the same
is found to be satisfactory and free from anyone of the infirmities
mentioned above.

In cases where the decision making process

involves technical expertise, the scope of review gets further reduced.
That is because the courts are not equipped with the expertise
necessary to sit in judgment over the decisions taken by experts. The
process of review shows deference to the opinions of the experts. The
legal position on the subject is settled by a long line of decisions
rendered by the Supreme Court to which we shall presently refer, but
before we do so, we need to briefly set out the facts in the backdrop

WP(C) 1133/2008

page 1 of 11

whereof the petitioner challenges the rejection of the technical bid
offered by it for a certain scientific equipment being purchased by the
respondents. What is however significant and may be stated at the
threshold is that the rejection of the petitioner's technical bid is based
entirely on the opinion of the experts according to whom the
equipment offered by the petitioner did not satisfy the technical
requirements stipulated in the request for proposal (RFP for short).
The petitioner however contends that the said rejection was unfair
inasmuch as while the Experts Committee had granted an opportunity
to other bidders to make up the deficiencies in the equipment offered
by them, no such opportunity was given to the petitioner.

This,

according to the petitioner, led to discrimination between parties that
were similarly circumstanced and hence entitled to similar treatment.
The respondents deny that allegation and urge that the evaluation of
the

technical

bids

submitted

by

the

intending

suppliers

was

undertaken by an Expert Committee which had adopted an objective
standard that was applied uniformly to all the bidders. Inasmuch as
the Committee had found that the petitioner's bid was not technically
compliant on account of the “Data Logger” offered by it being not up
to the required specifications, it committed no mistake leave alone an
error bordering on perversity to warrant interference by this Court. It
is also contended that the “Data Logger” offered by the petitioner was
upon a proper evaluation, found to be unacceptable in terms of the
requirements of the RFP which fact was admitted even by the
petitioner in a communication dated 27th December, 2007 addressed
after the technical evaluation of the bid whereby it had offered to
remove the deficiencies in the machines it was selling. That belated
offer was not however acceptable to the respondents who were
proceeding under a time schedule for the supplies in question. In the
circumstances, the rejection of the bid on the ground of nonWP(C) 1133/2008

page 2 of 11

compliance of the essential requirements of the RFP could not be
described as illegal, irregular or in any way perverse. Time now to
state a few facts.
2.

Indian Meteorological Department (IMD for short) is operating a

network of 125 Automatic Weather Stations (AWS for short) under
what is described as Pseudo Random Burst Sequence (PRBS),
technique of transmission through the Data Relay Transponder (DRT)
of Kalpana-I satellite. These AWS are also compatible to INSAT series
of satellites.

In PRBS mode of transmission, satellite Data Relay

Transponder (DRT) has a capacity to accommodate only 400 AWS in
the present carrier slot of 402.75 Mhz. This carrier is, according to
the Government, being utilized by various users like the Government
of Andhra Pradesh, Central Water Commission (CWC), Snow and
Avalanche Studies Establishment (SASE) including IMD is already
saturated.

No additional allocation is said to be possible to this

system. In order however to accommodate more number of AWS, the
respondents proposed to switch over to what is described as Time
Division Multiple Access (TDMA) type of transmission technique. This
switch over is possible in view of the current scientific and technical
developments in the field of operational forecasting which most of the
developed countries have adopted.

The Government therefore

appears to have taken a decision to utilize this new technique for all
future AWS to facilitate installation and data reception from more
number of AWS. A modernization plan for commissioning of 550 AWS
has accordingly been drawn up by the Government based on a
feasibility report prepared by the IMD.
3.

With the approval of the above project by the Government, a

request for proposal (RFP) document was prepared and issued for
procurement of the equipment for the automatic weather stations and
one TDMA type data receiving earth station. A global tender enquiry
WP(C) 1133/2008

page 3 of 11

was accordingly floated in July, 2007 which stipulated 20th September,
2007 as the cut off date for submission of the bids. A pre-bid meeting
was then conducted in IMD, New Delhi on 21st August, 2007 with the
suppliers of AWS equipments to provide clarifications to their queries
on the IMD Request For Proposal document. Information regarding
the meeting was provided even in the IMD website. In response to
the global tender enquiry, as many as 11 firms submitted their bids
including the petitioner herein.

These bids were then submitted to

the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) drawn by the Director
General of Meteorology comprising eminent scientists and experts
mostly in the fields of atmospheric sciences and instrumentation from
different

organizations

Establishment,

like

Chandigarh,

Snow

and

Ministry

of

Avalanche
Defence,

Studies
Indian

and

Space

Research Organization and IMD representative for evaluation of the
bids. The Committee evaluated the technical bids received from the
bidders and came to the conclusion that four of the bidders did not
have the requisite certification from the IMD for data logger and
transmitter for functional operation with INSAT/Kalpana series of
satellite. The technical bids offered by the following firms were thus
rejected:
(i)
(ii)

Axys Technologies India, New Delhi.

(iii)

Bharat Electronics Ltd., Bangalore

(iv)
4.

Alpha Design Technologies, Bangalore

Electronics Corporation of India Ltd., Hyderabad.

Aggrieved by the rejection of its technical bid, the petitioner has

filed the present writ petition challenging the rejection inter alia on
the ground of its being arbitrary and unfair. The primary ground on
which the petitioner has assailed the rejection of its technical bid is
that

the

Technical

Committee

had

adopted

double

standards

inasmuch as some of the bids which were similarly found to be
WP(C) 1133/2008

page 4 of 11

deficient by it were taken to the next stage of evaluation, giving to the
bidders time to remove the deficiencies pointed out by the Committee.
No such concession or opportunity was however given to the
petitioner thereby exposing the petitioner to hostile treatment and
rendering the decision to reject the bid arbitrary and discriminatory in
nature.
5.

The respondents have appeared to contest the writ petition and

filed their counter affidavits in which the entire background leading to
the issue of the RPF has been set out. The counter affidavit inter alia
points out that the data logger offered by the petitioner was found to
be technically non-compliant by the TEC. It is further stated that data
logger is the heart of an Automatic Weather Station and that the
technical experts had found that component offered by the petitioner
to be non-compliant with the requirements of RFP.

The petitioner

thus failed to satisfy an essential RFP requirement which was
sufficient to justify the rejection of the equipment offered by it. It is
also alleged that the IMD or the Expert Committee had not granted
any extension to any vendor beyond the scope of RFP which is an
exhaustive document and contains essential mandatory requirements
apart from those that are minor condonable and non-critical in nature.
6.

Appearing for the petitioner, Mr. Sunil Kumar, made a two-fold

submission before us. Firstly, it was contended by him that the RFP
did not contain any provision for the grant of time to any bidder
whose technical bid did not comply with the requirements stipulated
for the equipment. Even so, the Technical Committee had given to
three different bidders, namely, M/s Jin Yang Industrial Company Ltd.,
M/s Instrumentation Ltd. and M/s PEC & AMSH, time to comply with
the technical requirements stipulated for different components of the
equipment offered by them.

No such extension or concession was

shown to the petitioner thereby rendering the entire process of
WP(C) 1133/2008

page 5 of 11

evaluation illegal. Since the RFP binds the parties, the grant of time
to the other three defaulting companies while denying the same
treatment to the petitioner was, argued the learned counsel, illegal.
Secondly, it was contended by the learned counsel that the RFP did
not make any distinction between vital and non-vital components of
the equipment.

The attempt to classify the equipment into two

categories

therefore,

was,

unjustified

and

aimed

at

somehow

supporting and sustaining the action of the respondents which was
otherwise untenable in law.
7.

On behalf of the respondents, it was on the other hand

contended by Mr.Mehra that the evaluation of the technical bids
having been entrusted to a Committee of Experts, there was very little
room for a writ court to interfere with the decision of the Technical
Committee. It was further submitted that while the petitioner's bid
was found to be non-compliant in respect of a very critical part of the
equipment, the deficiencies noted in the equipment of other three
bidders were not comparable to the deficiencies found in the
petitioner's equipment. He drew our attention to the observations of
TEC in this regard to buttress his argument that technical noncompliance qua essential equipment like data logger was totally
different from incidental or minor deficiencies in regard to some other
equipment which the TEC found to be remediable by the bidder
without affecting the essence of the equipment and the underlying
tender process.
8.

We have given our careful consideration to the submissions

made at the bar and perused the record. It is common ground that
the TEC comprised as many as seven technical experts on the subject.
These experts have admittedly evaluated the equipment offered by the
bidders and recorded specific reasons why the same has been found
to

be

non-compliant

WP(C) 1133/2008

wherever

such

non-compliance

has

been

page 6 of 11

reported. The minutes of the TEC based on their technical evaluation
of the equipment have been placed on record.

In so far as the

petitioner's bid is concerned, the TEC observed:

Reasons for non-acceptance
The SAM-GOES-11 antenna
specifications provided support
only RHCP polarization whereas
the requirement is both LHCP
and RHCP field switchable
(5.2.2.1 of RFP). The axial ratio
is not mentioned (5.2.2.7)
3 dB beam width of 40o (5.2.2.4)
is also not mentioned.

is required to be known
proper transmission of data.

Learned counsel for the petitioner did not make any attempt to

question the correctness of the above reasons nor was it disputed that
the deficiencies noted by the TEC did actually exist in the equipment
offered by it. As can be seen from a careful reading of the minutes
extracted above, the TEC has even referred the relevant paragraphs
in RFP while holding that the equipment offered by the petitioner
does not satisfy the requirements stipulated therein. This position is
made abundantly clear even by the letter dated 27th December, 2007
addressed by the petitioner to the Director General of Meteorology in
which the petitioner has referred to certain modifications having been
carried out in the data logger offered by it to make the same fully
compliant with the requirements of RFP.

The following paragraph

from the said letter is in this regard relevant:

“We are now pleased to confirm as promised by our team during presentation
that the modifications are carried out and data logger (100% complaint) is now
ready with our manufacturer and will be made available, if we get opportunity to
supply the equipments.”

10.

In the light of the above, there is no gainsaying that the

equipment offered by the petitioner was technically non-compliant
and was therefore liable to be rejected by the TEC who was perfectly
within its powers to insist that the equipment should strictly comply
with the standards stipulated for the same. The question however is
whether grant of time to the other three bidders, namely, M/s Jin
WP(C) 1133/2008

page 8 of 11

Yang, M/s Instrumentation Ltd. and M/s PEC & AMSH to remove
certain deficiencies in IDMA earth station transmission which is
another component of the equipment would render the process illegal
or irregular. There are two reasons why the decision making process
is not, in our view, vitiated on that account in the instant case. Firstly
because in so far as the data logger is concerned, none of the three
companies mentioned above were found to be non-compliant as was
the position with the petitioner, nor has any time been granted to
them to comply with the requirements of the RFP in regard to that
equipment.

It is not therefore a case where the decision making

authority or an expert/agency assessing the same adopts two different
standards while dealing with the same subject matter qua parties that
are similarly situate. M/s Jin Yang, M/s Instrumentation and M/s PEC
& AMSH were all found to be compliant in so far as the data logger
was concerned.

It was only the petitioner whose equipment was

found to be non-compliant. Grant of time to some while denying the
same to the petitioner would have made material difference if it
related to data logger. It is not however the petitioner's case that any
time was granted to any one of the three other bidders to remove the
deficiencies in data logger. There was in fact no occasion for any one
to do so as the Data Logger offered by the three bidders mentioned
above were fully compliant.
11.

Secondly, because the deficiencies noticed by the TEC in

relation to the earth station were not of such a critical nature as to
render the equipment offered for the earth station transmission to be
wholly unacceptable.

What is evident from the above is that in so far as data logger is

concerned, while the petitioner was found to be non-compliant, M/s
Jin Yang, M/s Instrumentation and M/s PEC & AMSH were found to be
compliant. It is also evident that deficiencies mentioned by the TEC
related to another equipment viz; “earth station transmission” in the
bids offered by the other three companies referred to above and not
WP(C) 1133/2008

page 10 of 11

data logger.

Whether or not the deficiencies noticed in the TDMA

earth station transmission equipment were of critical nature is
however a matter which the experts evaluating the equipment were
better qualified to judge and decide. Inasmuch as the experts took
the view that the deficiencies were not of a kind that would justify the
rejection of the equipment in toto, the said decision cannot be readily
found fault with. In situations involving judicial review of decisions
that are founded on technical evaluation by experts, the courts are
extremely slow in interfering. Reference may in this regard be made
to the decisions of the Supreme Court in Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v.

Union of India & Ors. (1996) 9 SCC 709, Union Public Service
Commission v. Jagannath Mishra (2003) 9 SCC 237 and U.P. Public
Service Commission v. Subhash Chandra Dixit and Others (2003) 12
SCC 701. Respectfully

following

the

above

authoritative

pronouncements, we see no reason to interfere with the decision
taken by the Expert Committee rejecting the bid offered by the
petitioner. That is particularly so when the view taken by the experts
does not appear to us to be erroneous much less so outrageously
perverse as to call for any interference in exercise of our writ
jurisdiction.
13.

In the result, this writ petition fails and is hereby dismissed but

in the circumstances without any order as to costs.
