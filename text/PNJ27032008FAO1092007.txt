Heard learned counsel for the parties.

2.

The Railways is aggrieved by an order dated

16.11.2006
respondent

disposing
and

of

a

awarding

claim

petition

compensation

filed
in

by

the

sum

of

Rs.3,24,044/- to the respondent holding that 55% value of the
consignment of Moong Dal which was entrusted to the Railway
authorities vide RR No.C-304305 dated 10.9.1999 for carriage

FAO.No.109/07

page 1 of 5

from Ahmednagar to Delhi got damaged due to delay in transit
and lack of reasonable steps taken by the Railway authorities
to protect the Moong Dal. From the sum awarded, Rs.57,624/already paid by the Railway authorities has been directed to be
adjusted,

meaning

Rs.2,66,420/-.

thereby,

net

amount

payable

is

Interest @ 6% p.a. from date of the order till

realisation has also been directed.
3.

The Railways did not dispute receipt of 280 bags of

Moong Dal for onward shipment from Ahmednagar to Delhi.
Railways also did not dispute delay in transit and goods being
damaged. However, Railways pleaded that value of the goods
deteriorated was only 10% of the consignment.
4.

The respondent alleged that the value of the goods

damaged was 60%.
5.

The Railways relied upon an assessment made by

their officers.

The respondent relied upon the valuation

pertaining to the deterioration of the goods by Government
approved valuers, namely, Rakesh Kumar Malhotra and Shri
Sadi Ram Sheo Shankar. The former assessed the damage to
be 58% to 60%. The latter assessed the damage to be 55% to
60%.
6.

The Railway authorities

also

took

an additional

defence that there was a full and final settlement of the claim

page 2 of 5

when

on

20.8.2001,

vide

cheque

No.851186,

it

paid

Rs.57,624/- to the respondent on account of goods being
damaged to the extent of 10%.
7.

On the plea of accord and satisfaction the Tribunal

has noted that the evidence does not establish the same.
8.

I have perused the record of the Tribunal. The

record reveals that on 23.7.2001 (letter being at page 143 of
the record of the Tribunal) the Railways intimated to the
respondent that it was prepared to pay Rs.57,624/- to the
respondent on account of the loss of the value of the goods.
Said letter dated 23.7.2001 written by the Railway authorities,
on being received by the respondent, was immediately replied
vide respondent's letter dated 31.7.2001 (at page 131 of the
record of the Tribunal). The letter dated 31.7.2001 written by
the respondent clearly informs to the Railway authorities as
under :“We therefore hereby categorically informed
the Railway Administration that we shall accept
the payment of Rs.57624/- as a Part payment of
our claim and we shall hold the Railway
Administration liable for the balance amount
which may kindly by noted. The amount of
Rs.57624/- if sent to us shall be accepted under
Protest as a part-payment of claim. Please
acknowledge the receipt of this Notice.”
9.

The record reveals that thereafter the Railway

authorities sent the cheque in question to the respondent by
FAO.No.109/07

page 3 of 5

post and on receipt of the cheque, vide letter dated 11.9.2001,
the respondent wrote back that it was receiving and encashing
the cheque under protest and was treating the payment
tendered as a part payment. The said letter dated 11.9.2001 is
at page 135 of the record of the Tribunal.
10.

The letter concludes as under :'In the meanwhile, we are encashing the above
cheque under protest as a part payment after
service of this notice by you.'

11.

Photocopy of the cheque dated 20.8.2001 is at page

133 of the record of the Tribunal.
12.

Thus, the plea of the appellant that there was

accord and satisfaction and that the respondent received
Rs.57,624/- in full and final satisfaction of its claim is contrary
to the record. The plea is rejected.
13.

On the quantification of the loss, suffice would it be

to state that the Tribunal had before it the version of the
Railways and 2 valuation reports submitted by the respondent.
The valuation reports were prepared by the Government
approved valuers.
14.

As noted above, one valuation report assessed the

loss to be between 58% to 60%. The other report assessed the
loss to be between 55% to 60%.
15.

The evaluation of the reports is a matter pertaining

FAO.No.109/07

page 4 of 5

to appreciation of evidence. No infirmity has been pointed out
to this court in the valuation reports. It has not been shown as
to in what manner the reports were not good evidence.
16.

I note that the Tribunal has recompensed the

respondent on the lower percentage of the loss i.e. 55%.
17.

I thus find no infirmity in the impugned order.

18.

The appeal is dismissed.

19.

Costs shall follow.

20.

TCR be returned forthwith.
