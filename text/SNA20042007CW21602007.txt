a

statutory

petition

under

Section

to the gravity of the offence proved

The

said

statutory

petition

of

the

petitioner was dismissed by the Chief of Air Staff vide
order passed on 13.6.2006. The reasons for dismissal of
the statutory petition given by the Chief of Air Staff
as contained in the order dated 13.6.2006 are to the
following effect:“(a) During trial, the petitioner
had voluntarily pleaded guilty to
the charges without any inducement,
threat or promise. The Court had
followed the prescribed procedure
before recording the finding of
'guilty'. Thus, the finding of the
Court is legally sustainable.
(b) The offences committed by the
petitioner against a foreign Air
Force personnel undergoing course
in
AFIS
have
caused
severe
embarrassment to the IAF. By his
acts, the petitioner has seriously
prejudiced 'Good Order' and 'Air
Force Discipline'. Considering the
high standards of moral conduct
expected from Air Warriors, such
indecent
behaviour
renders
him
undesirable
for
retention
in
service.
(c ) The petitioner has exhibited
indecent and unnatural conduct of
disgraceful nature. In fact, the
sentence
awarded
to
him
is
WP(C)

2160-07

considered lenient in the facts and
circumstances of the case. Thus, I
do not find any reason to interfere
with the same.”
Aggrieved by the proceedings of General Court

5.

Mr.Kapoor, counsel appearing on behalf of the

petitioner had vehemently argued that the petitioner
was wrongly convicted by the court martial because of
mistaken identity. It was contended by him that as
there was no evidence in support of the charges framed
against

the

petitioner,

he

could

not

have

been

convicted and sentenced only on the basis of his plea

guilty'

The

in

proceedings
counsel

before

heavily

the

relied

court
upon

a

Division Bench judgment of this Court in Ram Paul vs.
Union of India & Anr. (CWP No. 2287/2001 decided on
26.7.2004)

to

buttress

his

contention

that

the

conviction could not be based on the plea of “plead
guilty” unless there is cogent evidence to support the
charges against the petitioner. We have gone through
the said judgment

relied upon by the petitioner's

counsel as well as the proceedings of the General Court
Martial (Annexure P-7, pages 74 to 118 of the paper
book). In our opinion, the judgment of this Court in
Ram Paul's case (supra) is of no help or consequence to
the petitioner because in the case of Ram Paul, there
was no reference nor any statement made by any of the
witnesses during summary of evidence that delinquent
official had accepted illegal gratification and after
accepting the said illegal gratification allowed the
smugglers to cross the international border.

However, in

that case during the trial before the Summary Security Force
Court

charge

WP(C)

2160-07

came

to

be

amended

wherein

a

specific
Page 5 of 11

allegation was brought against delinquent that he had
accepted

the

illegal

gratification

from

the

local

smugglers for allowing 50-60 bags to be smuggled out of
Bangladesh.

On these facts, it was held by this Court

in Ram Paul's case (supra) that the conviction based on
the plea of 'plead guilty' was illegal and

without

jurisdiction as there was no evidence to support the
allegation

of

illegal

gratification.

The

relevant

portion of the judgment in Ram Paul's case (supra) is
reproduced hereinbelow :“Since there is no evidence on
record to make out a case for
acceptance of illegal gratification
by the petitioner, there could and
should have been no conviction at
the petitioner even assuming the
petitioner had pleaded guilty after
understanding
all
the
circumstances. Therefore, we are of
the considered opinion that the
conviction
and
sentence
passed
against the petitioner is illegal
and without jurisdiction and the
same is liable to be quashed on
this ground alone, which we hereby
do.”
The above judgment in Ram Paul's case (supra)

6.

is not applicable to the facts of this case because on
perusal
WP(C)

of

2160-07

summary

of

evidence

recorded

against

Page 6 of 11

petitioner it is evident that there was, prima facie,
incriminating evidence against him to show that he had
made

sexual

advances

to

a

foreign

national

Flight

Sergeant Phiri Charles Provost of Zambian, Livingstone
thereby

indicating

attempt

on

his

part

for

carnal

intercourse on the person of said foreign national.

A

perusal of the proceedings of the court martial held
against

the

petitioner

(Annexure

P-7)

reveals

that

number of opportunities were given by the court martial
to

the

petitioner

that

if

he

so

likes,

he

could

withdraw his plea of 'plead guilty' and that he was
adequately explained the consequences of his pleading
guilty but still he chose to stick to his plea of
'plead guilty' taken by him before the court martial.
Flight

Lieutenant

P

K

Yadav,

a

Law

graduate,

had

appeared before the court martial as Defending Officer
to assist the petitioner during trial before the court
martial.

A perusal of the proceedings of the court

martial would further show that the Defending Officer
of the petitioner had also explained the charges as
well
WP(C)

as

consequences

2160-07

of

pleading

guilty

to

the

Page 7 of 11

petitioner.

Not

only

that,

the

petitioner

made

a

statement before the court martial, which was recorded
in writing on 23.2.2006 wherein he admitting his guilt
that on 15.2.2006 at about 2100 hours he had entered
the room of Flight

Sergeant Phiri Charles Provost of

Zambian Air Force, Livingstone and sat down near him on
his bed and tried to persuade him for unnatural sex
thereby

requesting

him

for

homo-sex.

After

making

statement to the above effect, the petitioner made a
plea in mitigation of sentence by giving a two page
typed

petition

to

the

court

martial,

the

relevant

portion whereof is extracted below :“On a very essential requirement of the
Air Force, I am attached to 2 Wing, AF

I

knocked the door and the door was opened
by the Flt Sgt of Zambia Air Force.

On

opening the door the occupant of the room
no.7 welcomed me for the discussion and
we started talking to each other and the
discussion continued approximately 10 to
15 minutes.

At the very beginning the

discussion was on very common topics and
on

sharing

of

information

about

the

culture and climate of the two countries.
We also shared the information about the
habit and life style of the people of the
two

countries.

Then

the

discussion

turned on to sex related topic and I made
sexual advances to Flt Sgt Phiri Charles
for homosex.”

Flight Sergeant Phiri Charles had clearly identified
the petitioner as the person who made an attempt of

of the view that there is no merit in the challenge
made by the petitioner in this writ petition against
his conviction and sentence by the court martial.
