1.

Ravinder

Rana,

petitioner

herein,

was

enrolled

as

Constable in the Central Industrial Security Force (in short
„CISF‟).

The petitioner was posted on deputation at Indian

Embassy at Kathmandu, Nepal with other CISF personnel. On
the night falling between 17th / 18th January, 2005 the
petitioner unauthorisedly used the service rifle of Constable
Anoop Singh and opened fire at his colleagues at the security
barrack at Indian Embassy, Kathmandu, Nepal at about 0530
hrs.

Constables R. Kannan and T. Shankar, his colleagues

succumbed to injuries instantaneously and other Constables,
namely, Bidesh Dutta, Sunil Singha, Rajbir Singh received
injuries. A criminal case commenced in the court of Special
Judge, CBI, New Delhi.
2.

The petitioner was placed under suspension with effect

WP(C) No. 9093/2006

Page 2 of 8

from 18th January, 2005.

The petitioner vide his application

dated 19th September, 2005, Annexure P-3, admitted that he
is getting 50% of the subsistence allowance.

The petitioner

completed 90 days under suspension on 17th April, 2005. Vide
order dated 25th April, 2005 the competent authority refused
to enhance the petitioner‟s subsistence allowance.

The

petitioner made a representation on 19th September, 2005.
The said representation was rejected on 8th / 9th October,
2005.
3.

The petitioner has called into question the above-said

order on the following grounds. The review petition and the
representation made by the petitioner were dismissed without
application of mind and without assigning any reason. FR 53
(1)(ii) (a)(i) clearly stipulates,
“The amount of subsistence allowance may be
increased by a suitable amount, not exceeding
50 per cent of the subsistence allowance
admissible during the period of the first three
months, if, in the opinion of the said authority,
the period of suspension has been prolonged
for reasons to be recorded in writing, not
directly attributable to the Government
servant.”

Govt.

Office

Memorandum No.F.15 (16)-E.IV/58, dated the 16th February,
1959 reads :“It is obligatory under FR 53 that in sufficient
time before the expiry of the first six (now
three) months of suspension, the competent
authority should review each case in which the
period of suspension is likely to exceed six
(now three) months, and even if it comes to
the conclusion that the rate is not to be
altered having regard to all the circumstances
of the case, specific orders to that effect are
to be passed placing on record the
circumstances under which the decision had
to be taken.”
Under these circumstances the present petition was filed
with a prayer that the respondents be directed to pay
subsistence allowance to the petitioner at the rate of 75% with
effect from the date of first review of suspension, along with
interest.
4.

The respondents have contested the present case.

5.

We have heard the counsel for the parties. It is apparent

that no cogent or plausible reasons were given in the abovestated impugned orders as to why the enhancement of
subsistence allowance was turned down by the concerned
WP(C) No. 9093/2006

authority.

However,

in

the

counter

affidavit

following

averments were made. The chargesheet under Rule 26 was
issued against the petitioner on 27th May, 2005.

The

petitioner received the same on 28th May, 2005. On the same
date the enquiry officer and the presenting officer were
appointed by the disciplinary authority and the enquiry officer
held the enquiry at Tihar Jail on 7th July, 2005. However, the
petitioner refused to produce the evidence stating that he
would receive the papers and depose in the presence of his
The case was adjourned to 15th July, 2005.

The

petitioner did not cooperate with the enquiry officer.

lawyer.

further stated that the petitioner has been causing delay in
conducting the departmental enquiry.

The above-said facts

were considered and it was rightly observed that it is not a fit
case for revocation of suspension and enhancement of
subsistence allowance.
6.

All these facts were not denied specifically in the

rejoinder.

However the same

were conspicuously missing

from the above-said two impugned orders dated 25th April,

WP(C) No. 9093/2006

Page 5 of 8

2005 and 8th / 9th October, 2005.

It appears that no

opportunity was given to the petitioner to explain the same. It
is a settled law that opportunity of being heard must be
granted to the petitioner.
7.

Counsel for the petitioner has cited an authority reported

in B.D.Shetty and Ors. Vs. M/s. Ceat Ltd. and Ors. [AIR 2001 SC
2953].

The said case is under the Industrial Employment

(Standing Orders) Act (20 of 1946).

We are afraid that the

said authority is not applicable to the instant case in view of
Sections 19 or 20 of the Central Industrial Security Force Act,
1968.
8.

We are of the considered view that the present case is

covered

under

FR

Supplementary Rules.

53

of

the

Fundamental

Rules

and

The petitioner is also entitled to the

right of review of the subsistence allowance after the expiry of
90 days after his suspension. Keeping in view the facts and
circumstances of this case, we are of the considered view that
the review application be decided again in accordance with
law and as per the provisions of FR 53. It is also pertinent to

WP(C) No. 9093/2006

Page 6 of 8

note that although we are going to remand the case, yet there
lies no bar to second or subsequent reviews. Govt. of India,
Member Finance Memorandum No.F.((1)-E.IV (A)/66, dated the
30th June, 1996 provides as under:“(d) Second or subsequent review.-Though the
proviso to FR 54 (1) (ii) (a) does not specifically
provide for a second or subsequent review, there
is no objection to such review(s) being made by
the competent authority. Such authority shall be
competent to pass orders to increase or decrease
the rate of subsistence allowance up to fifty per
cent of the amount of subsistence allowance
initially granted, according to the circumstances
of each case. A second or subsequent review
can be made at any time at the discretion of the
competent authority.
It is permissible to reduce the amount of
subsistence allowance once increased on the
basis of the first review up to fifty per cent of the
amount of the subsistence allowance initially
granted, if the period of suspension has been
prolonged for reasons directly attributable to the
Government servant, i.e., by his adopting
dilatory basis.
Similarly, in a case where the amount of
subsistence allowance has been reduced after
the first review, the same can be increased up to
fifty per cent of the amount initially granted, if
the period of suspension has been prolonged for
reasons not directly attributable to the
Government servant and the Government
servant has given up dilatory tactics.”

It may also be mentioned here that the first order was

passed by the competent authority on 25th April, 2005
whereas the above-said delay occurred afterwards.

The

competent authority is further directed to pass the speaking
order giving all the details and fix the period from which date
to which date the appellant should be or should not be given
the enhanced subsistence allowance. Fathomable reasons
must follow.

The petitioner should also be heard in person

and should be given an opportunity to explain all these facts.
The order in this respect be passed within three months from
the date of pronouncement of this order.
12.

The writ petition stands disposed of.

A copy of this

judgment be given dasti to both counsel for the parties.
