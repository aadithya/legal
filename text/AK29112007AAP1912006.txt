1.

This is a petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1996

for appointment of arbitrator in terms of arbitration agreement
between the parties as the disputes have arisen.

2.

The notice of the petition was issued to the respondent,

however, despite various opportunities given to the respondent, reply
has not been filed and consequently the pleas and averments raised
by the petitioner has not been denied by the respondent.

3.

The contention of the petitioner is that a notice inviting tender

bearing No.25/1 was issued by the Executive Engineer (Pr.), South
Zone, Sewa Nagar, New Delhi for the work of “Widening &
Improvement of Gurgaon Road from Andheri More to Delhi-Haryana
Border, Phase-II, SH: Widening of carriage way from Andheri More to
Sultanpur Village towards Delhi-Haryana Border (L.H.S.)”.

4.

The petitioner has contended that he is a registered municipal

contractor.

Pursuant to the notice inviting tender, the petitioner

furnished the relevant documents and after perusal of the documents,
a tender form was issued by the respondent, Executive Engineer.
The petitioner quoted rates and his rates being lowest amongst all the
contractors and as such work order bearing No.EE(Pr.)/SZ/TC/20002001/34 dated 17th August, 2000 was issued to the petitioner.

The

work was to be started under the work order from 27th August, 2000
and it was to be completed within twelve months. The stipulated date
of completion was 26th August, 2001, however, the work was
completed by the petitioner after a delay of one day on 27th August,
2001.

5.

On completion of work, the petitioner has raised the final bill

which amount has not been paid and consequently the disputes have
arisen between the parties. Since there is an arbitration agreement

AA No.191/2006

between the parties for adjudication of the disputes by an arbitrator
in terms of clause 25 of the agreement, the petitioner invoked the
same. Clause 25 of the agreement containing the arbitration
agreement is as under:“Clause 25:
Except where otherwise provided in the contract all
questions and disputes relating to the meaning of the
specifications, designs, drawings and instructions herein
before mentioned and as to the quality of workmanship or
materials used on the work or as to any other question
claim, right matter or thing whatever in any way arising
out of or relating to the contract designs, drawings,
specifications, estimates instructions order or these
conditions or otherwise concerning the work of execution
or failure to execute the same whether arising during the
progress of the work or after the completion or
abandonment shall be referred to the Sole Arbitrator of
the person appointed by the Commissioner, MCD at the
time of dispute or the administrative Head of MCD at the
time of such appointment. It will be no objection to any
such appointment that the Arbitrator so appointed is a
Govt. Servant, had expressed views on all or any of the
matter in dispute or difference. The Arbitrator to whom
the matter is originally referred being transferred or
vacating his office or being unable to act for any reason,
the reason, the Commissioner or administrative head as
aforesaid at the time of such transfer vacating of office or
inability to act, shall appoint another person to act as
Arbitrator in accordance with the terms of the contract,
such person shall be entitled to proceed with the
reference from the stage at which it was left by his
predecessor, it is also a term of this contract that no
person other than a person appointed by Commissioner
or administrative Head of MCD as aforesaid should act as
Arbitrator and if for any reason that is not possible, the
matter is not to be referred to arbitration at all. In all
cases where the amount of claim in dispute n Rs.25,000/(Rupees twenty five thousand) only and above the
Arbitrator shall give the reason for the award.

The petitioner gave a notice dated 12th January, 2006

demanding

appointment

of

arbitrator

in

terms

of

arbitration

agreement which was sent by registered post and under postal
certificate and copies of postal receipt and UPC has been produced by
the petitioner. No reply to the notice was given.

Thereafter, the

petitioner has filed the present petition and despite opportunities
given, the respondent failed to file any reply and in any case failed to

AA No.191/2006

Page 4 of 7

appoint the arbitrator within 30 days from the receipt of the notice
invoking the arbitration agreement and even before filing the present
petition. Further contention of the petitioner is that the original
agreement was not given to him and the petitioner also sought
production of original agreement which has not been produced by the
respondent.

In the circumstances, the plea of the petitioner that

there is an arbitration agreement in terms of clause 25 cannot be
refuted by the respondent.

7.

Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent states

that he has no instructions.

8.

A learned Single Judge in Haryana Telecom Ltd. v. Union of

India & Anr., 112 (2004) DLT 339=2004 (3) RAJ 147, had held that if
the respondent fails to appoint an Arbitrator within the stipulated
time of 30 days of the notice, and even after filing of the petition
under Section 11 of the Act, it is for the Court to appoint an
Arbitrator. A Division Bench of this Court in Delkon (India) Pvt. Ltd.
v. G.M., Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., 120 (2005) DLT 542 (DB),
relying on Datar Switchgears Ltd Vs Tata Finance Ltd has held in
para 4 is as under:
“4. We have given our careful consideration to the
arguments advanced by learned Counsel for both the
parties. In view of the law laid down in the case of Datar
Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance Ltd. & Anr., IV (2000)
AA No.191/2006

Page 5 of 7

CLT 191 (SC)=VII (2000) SLT 543=JT 2000 (Suppl. 2) SC
226 it is no more res integra that the vacancy can be
supplied by a party pursuant to the arbitration agreement
even after thirty days of the receipt of the notice. However,
once a party approaches the Court and files a petition for
appointment by the designated authority of the Chief
Justice of that Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, the right to supply vacancy by the
opposite party is extinguished. If that right stood
extinguished on filing of the petition under Section 11(6)
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, in September
1998 the appointment of an Arbitrator on 3rd May, 1999
could not be made, therefore in our view, the order
passed by the learned Single Judge on 7th May, 1999
suffers from patent illegality. Therefore, the submission of
the respondent that the petitioner had appeared before
the Arbitrator and the application of the petitioner raising
preliminary objections is pending adjudication which
inter alia challenges the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to
decide the dispute is of no consequence as from the order
reproduced above it was pursuant to the directions
passed by the learned Single Judge that the parties were
directed to appear before the Arbitrator. The petitioner
had no other option but to appear before the Arbitrator
and after appearing before the Arbitrator the petitioner
has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator,
rather has at first opportunity taken the objection that
the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to proceed with the
matter.

9.

In Union of India v. M/s. R.R. Industries, 120 (2005) DLT 572

(DB) also it was held that once a party does not supply the vacancy or
fails to supply the vacancy before filing of a petition under Section
11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, such a party forfeits the
right to supply the vacancy in terms of the arbitration clause and
what remains is only the arbitration clause, i.e. the dispute has to be
resolved under the mechanism of alternative dispute redressal
AA No.191/2006

Page 6 of 7

scheme but no right survives to the respondent to supply the named
Arbitrator in the arbitration clause. Thus the arbitrator was to be
appointed before the filing of the petition and since no arbitrator has
been appointed by the respondent consequently, the respondent has
lost its right to appoint the arbitrator in terms of clause 25 of the
arbitration agreement.

10.

Considering the facts and circumstances, I appoint Shri S.M.

Chopra, Advocate, (Additional District Judge, Retd.),181, Deshbandhu
