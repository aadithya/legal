This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 for quashing order dated
14.1.2005.

Vide

order

dated

14.1.2005,

petitioners

were

summoned by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate to face trial
in the complaint filed by the respondent, M/s.Springer India Pvt.
Ltd. under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881.

Case pleaded by the complainant in the complaint is

as follows:(a)

Petitioner

company,

Shroff

Publishers

and

Distributors Pvt. Ltd., issued a cheque bearing
No.144890

dated

1.8.2004

in

the

sum

of

Rs.7,34,000/- drawn on the Saraswat Cooperative
Bank, Vashi Mumbai towards part discharge of its
liability in the favour of the complainant.
(b)

Complainant presented the cheque for encashment
on 5.8.2004 which was returned unpaid with the
endorsement 'payment stopped by the drawer'.
Complainant was informed about the said dishonour
on 5.8.2004 itself.

(c)

Again on 11.11.2004, the complainant presented
the cheque to its bank, Deutsche Bank, New Delhi.
Cheque was again returned unpaid with the remark
'payment

stopped'.

Complainant

was

informed

about the dishonour of cheque on 13.11.04.
(d)

On 23.11.2004, complainant sent a statutory notice
of demand contemplated under Section 138 of the
NI Act to the petitioner company calling upon it to
pay the amount of the dishonoured cheque.

Crl.M.C. No.1752-56/2005

Page 2 of 11

(e)

Since

the

petitioner

company

failed

to

make

payment of the amount of dishonoured cheque
within the period of 15 days from the receipt of
statutory

notice

sent

by

the

complainant,

complainant filed the present complaint under
Section 138 of the N.I. Act 1881 against petitioner
company as also its directors (petitioners No.2, 3, 4
and 5 herein).
4.

Apart

from

giving

reasons

why

payment

was

stopped, petitioners plead that complainant never re-presented
the cheque in question to its bank, Saraswat Cooperative Bank
Ltd. on 11.11.2004.

That the cheque in question was only

presented once i.e. on 5.8.2004. That since the complainant
had send the statutory notice of demand beyond the period of
30 days as prescribed under clause (b) of proviso to Section
138 of the N.I. Act, present complaint is not maintainable.
5.

It is no longer res integra that a cheque can be

presented any number of times during the period of its validity
(see the decision of the Supreme Court in Sadanandan Bhadran
vs. Madhavan Sunil Kumar, AIR 1998 SC 3043).
6.

The only controversy involved in this petition is

whether

cheque

in

Crl.M.C. No.1752-56/2005

question

was

re-presented

by

the

Page 3 of 11

complainant on 11.11.2004.
7.

To establish that the cheque in question was

presented only once on 5.8.2004, petitioners have placed on
record letters of Saraswat Cooperative Bank Ltd dated 4.12.04,
9.12.04, 6.4.05, 14.4.05,6.5.05 and 30.1.06.

In said letters,

Saraswat Cooperative Bank Ltd has stated that the cheque in
question was presented to it on 5.8.2004 and that it was never
re-presented on 11.11.2004.
8.

In support of averments made in the complaint,

complainant has placed on record letter of Deutsche Bank
dated 24.10.05 as also a pay-slip. In the said letter, Deutsche
Bank has supported the stand of the complainant that the
cheque in question was returned unpaid on 13.11.2004 with
the endorsement 'payment stopped'.

Pay-slip shows that

cheque in question was deposited by the complainant in its
bank on 9.11.2004.
9.

At this stage I note letter dated 24.2.2006 written by

the counsel of the Deutsche Bank addressed to counsel for the
petitioners. Relevant part of the said letter reads as under:“The cheque No. 144890 had again been
deposited with the Bank's Delhi Branch in
November, 2004 and had been then sent by the
Delhi Branch to the Mumbai Branch of the Bank,
where
it
was
discovered
that
the
Crl.M.C. No.1752-56/2005

10.

cheque/negotiable instrument in question had a
defacement with the words 'payment stopped'
being written across the face of the negotiable
instrument. Accordingly, the cheque was not
presented to the Saraswat Cooperative Bank and
returned to the Delhi Branch of the Bank. The
date of 13th November 2004 appearing in the
Bank's letter of 24th October 2005 relates to the
date of the return of the said cheque to the Delhi
Branch.”
If complainant's version as to re-presentation of the

cheque in question is believed to be true, the position which
emerges is that on 11.1104 complainant deposited the cheque
in Deutsche Bank and that Deutsche Bank noting
defacement

on

the

cheque

returned

it

unpaid

the

without

presenting it to the drawer's bank, Saraswat Co-operative
Bank.
11.

In the context of afore-noted position, following 3

issues arise before this Court-:
(i)

What is meant by 'The Bank' as mentioned in clause

(a) of the proviso to Section 138 of the NI Act?
(ii)

Does such bank mean the bank of the drawer of the

cheque or covers within its ambit any bank including the
collecting bank of the payee of the cheque?
(iii)

To which bank the cheque is to be presented for the

purposes of attracting the penal provisions of Section 138 of
the NI Act?
Crl.M.C. No.1752-56/2005

Page 5 of 11

12.

Similar questions came up for consideration before

various High Courts.
13.

Punjab & Haryana High Court in the decision

reported as Om Prakash Vs. Gurcharan Singh (1997) 3 Crimes
433 and Gujrat High Court in decision reported as Arunbhai
Nilkantharai Nanawati Vs. Jayaben Prahaladbhai (1999) 3
Crimes 252 have held that a cheque must be presented to the
bank on which it is drawn within 6 months from the date of
issue of the cheque.
14.

An opposite view was taken by the Madras High

Court in the decision reported as A.B.K Publication Ltd. Vs.
Tamilnadu New Print & Papers Ltd. (1999) 3 Crimes 97. In the
said decision, it was held that cheque can be presented either
in the payee's bank or in the drawer bank and the date of
presentations

in

respective

banks

will

be

reckoned

for

calculating period of 6 months from the date it was drawn.
15.

To answer afore-noted questions, it is important to

note Section 138 of the NI Act. Relevant part of the Section
reads as under:“Where any cheque drawn by a person on an
account maintained by him with a banker for
payment of any account of money to another
person from out of that account for the discharge,
in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability, is
Crl.M.C. No.1752-56/2005

Page 6 of 11

returned by the bank unpaid, either because of
the amount of money standing to the credit of
that account is insufficient to honour the cheque
or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be
paid from that account by an agreement made
with that bank, such person shall be deemed to
have committed an offence ............

(a) the cheque has been presented to the bank
within a period of 6 months from the date on
which it is drawn or within the period of its
validity, whichever is earlier ..........”
Section 3 of the NI Act defines the 'banker' to

include any person acting as a banker and any post office
saving bank.
17.

Section 72 of the NI Act provides that a cheque

must, in order to charge the drawer, be presented at the bank
upon which it is drawn before the relations between the drawer
and his banker has been altered to the prejudice of the drawer.
18.

The use of the words 'a banker' and 'the bank' in the

Section is indicator of the intention of the legislature.

The

former is indirect article and the latter is pre-fixed by direct
article. If the legislature intended to have the same meaning
for 'a banker' and 'the bank', there was no cause or occasion
for mentioning it distinctly and differently by using two
different articles. It is worth noticing that the word 'banker' in
Section 3 of the NI Act is pre-fixed by the indefinite article (a)
Crl.M.C. No.1752-56/2005

Page 7 of 11

and the word 'bank' where the cheque is intended to be
presented under Section 138 is pre-fixed by definite article
'the'. The same section permits a person to issue a cheque on
an account maintained by him with 'a bank' and makes him
liable for criminal prosecution if it is returned by 'the bank'
unpaid.

'The' is always mentioned to the note particular thing

or a person. 'The' would therefore refer implicitly to a specified
bank and not any bank.
19.

A combined reading of Section 3, 72 and 138 of the

Act leaves no doubt that the law mandates the cheque to be
presented at the bank on which it is drawn if the drawer is to
be held criminally liable.
20.

It however does not mean that cheque is always to

be presented to the drawer's bank on which the cheque is
issued. The payee of the cheque has an option to present the
cheque in any bank including the collecting bank where he has
his account. But to attract the criminal liability of the drawer of
the cheque such collecting bank is obliged to present the
cheque in the drawer's bank on which the cheque is drawn
within the period of 6 months from the date on which it is
shown to have been issued.

The non presentation of the

cheque to the drawer's bank within the period specified in
Crl.M.C. No.1752-56/2005

Page 8 of 11

Section 138 would absolve the person issuing the cheque of his
criminal liability under Section 138 of the NI Act.
21.

The observations of the Supreme Court in the

decision reported as Sh.Ishar Alloy Steel Ltd. Vs. Jayaswals
NECO Ltd. AIR 2001 SC 1161 on this issue are conclusive. In
the said case, appellant had issued a cheque dated 21.7.1997
in favour of the respondent.

The respondent presented the

cheque for payment on 26.9.1997 which was returned unpaid.
Again on 20.1.1998, the respondent presented the cheque to
its bank i.e. State Bank of India at Raipur. The cheque reached
the drawer bank on 20.1.1998 admittedly after 6 months from
the date it became payable. The cheque was returned unpaid
by the bank of the respondent on 3.2.1998.

A notice as

required under proviso (b) of Section 138 of NI Act was issued
on 10.2.1998 which was received by the appellant on
16.2.1998. A criminal complaint under Section 138 of NI Act
was filed against the appellant. Holding that as the cheque was
presented for payment beyond the period of 6 months as
prescribed under proviso (a) to Section 138 of the NI Act,
Supreme Court has held the complaint to be non-maintainable.
In para 8 of the said decision, it was observed as under:“Thus, 'the bank' referred to in clause (a) to the
Crl.M.C. No.1752-56/2005

Page 9 of 11

22.

proviso to Section 138 of the NI Act means the
drawee bank on which the cheque is drawn and
not all banks where the cheque is presented for
collection including the bank of the payee, in
whose favour the cheque is issued.”
In the instant case, second presentation of the

cheque in question on 11.11.2004 cannot be termed as a
'presentation' as contemplated under Section 138 of the NI Act
for the reason bank of the complainant did not presented the
cheque in the drawer's bank, Saraswat Co-operative Bank.
Therefore, I hold that the cheque in question was presented to
the drawer of the cheque only once on 5.8.04.
23.

Clause (b) to the proviso of Section 138 of the NI Act

requires that notice of demand for payment of amount of
dishonour cheque must be sent within period of 30 days from
the receipt of information by the bank about the dishonour of
cheque.
24.

In the instant case, bank intimated the complainant

about the dishonour of cheque on 5.8.2004. Thus, notice of
demand sent by the complainant on 23.11.04 was beyond the
statutory period prescribed under clause (b) of the proviso to
Section 138 of the NI Act.
25.

I

thus

hold

that

the

complaint

filed

by

the

complainant is non-maintainable.

Inevitable conclusion is that the summoning order

dated 14.1.05 passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate is
quashed.

No costs.
