1.

Petitioners,

court for relief.

father

and son

have approached this

Whereas the son, Harinder Singh seeks bail,

father seeks anticipatory bail.
2.

Harinder Singh is in judicial custody since 18.9.2006.

3.

It is not in dispute that a challan has been presented

and a charge has been framed against the petitioners under
Section 498A/306 IPC. It is also not in dispute that pertaining to
the order framing charge, a revision petition is pending in this
court where the prayer made is that a charge needs to be framed
under Section 304B IPC.
4.

Thus, position as of today

would be that the

petitioners would be entitled to a consideration of the matter as if
they are charged under Section 498A/306 IPC.
5.

Conscious of the fact that considering the menace of

dowry a charge even under Section 306 IPC is a serious offence, I
have proceed to embark the journey with extra care and caution.
6.
3.10.2003.

Gurpreet Kaur was married to Harinder Singh on
A daughter was born to the couple. Unfortunately,

Gurpreet Kaur committed suicide on 25.8.2006.

Her aggrieved

father made a complaint that the in-laws of her daughter were
harassing her for dowry. He stated that on the pretext that his
daughter was ill lot of money was being spent on her treatment,

money was being demanded from him by the in-laws of her
daughter and that in the month of September,2004 he had given
Rs.40,000/- in cash.
7.

Petitioners have shown to me the voluminous medical

record pertaining to the medical treatment of the deceased.
8.

The same shows that right through her married life, the

deceased was under constant medical treatment.

She had a

kidney problem. Diagnostic report of the Department of Nuclear
Medicine of Saral Diagnostic

(at page 10 of Bail Application

No.3701/06) records a disfunctional right kidney. The problem
diagnosed is recorded as under :
“The right kidney is enlarged, present in its
normal location in the lumbar region. Arterial
perfusion to this kidney is reduced and delayed
in time following tracer appearance in the
abdominal aorta. Initial Te-99m DTPA uptake is
significantly reduced with presence of cortical
thinning. Serial images and region of interest
generated time activity curves reveal gradual
tracer accumulation in the dilated calyceal
system with complete tracer fili-in seen on the
delayed 1.5 hr image. Tracer hold up is noted in
the upper pole of this kidney, which does not
clear on delayed images and on forced diuresis
using intravenous frusemide. Tracer hold up in
the upper pole of this kidney clears promptly on
unclaiming the nephrostomy tube, with flow of
radiolabelled
urine
seen
through
the
nephrostomy tube.

Enlarged
right
kidney
with
severe
hydronephrotic
changes and associated
impairment of glomerular function.

9.

Tracer hold up is noted at upper pole of right
kidney which clears promptly through the
nephrostomy tube on forced diursis.”
The medical record shows that the deceased was under

medical treatment and medication pertaining to renal problem
on the day she died. Viscera report shows that the deceased had
taken crocin.

The medical record shows that the deceased was

visiting various doctors of repute for treatment.

The medical

record pertains to treatment undergone at All Institute of Medical
Sciences, Saat Manjila Shri Sanatan Dharam Charitable Hospital,
Tilak Nagar, Kartic Nursing Home & Urology Centre, as also
treatment by Dr.G.R.V.R.Reddy, Ex.Medical Officer of Dr.Ram
Manohar Lohia Hospital.
10.

The two families come from a middle class background.

The possibility of both families being stressed due to high cost of
medical treatment cannot be ruled out.

Even in the complaint

lodged with the police by the father of the deceased,

he has

stated that the in-laws of his daughter demanded money from him
for the treatment of his daughter. Prima facie, the demand, if at
all made, would not be a dowry demand.
11.

What shape would the trial ultimately take would

depend upon the evidence.

But while considering whether the

husband should be admitted to bail and whether father-in-law
should be granted anticipatory bail, it becomes relevant to weigh
the probabilities of the evidence which would come on record viza-viz the final shape of the adjudication which may take place.
For if, there is a probability that defence may succeed in
establishing that the deceased took her life as she was frustrated
due to her prolonged sickness, case would be made out to grant
the relief prayed for.
12.

The allegations by the father of the deceased in the

complaint are suggestive of demand for money by the in-laws for
the medical treatment of the deceased. Prima facie it was not for
the personal benefit of the in-laws.

Possibility of the deceased

ending her life out of frustration and to free her family from
economic bondage cannot be ignored at this stage.
13.

Question of petitioners tampering with evidence does

not arise as the police has collected all evidence and the challan
has already been filed.
14.

Witnesses of the prosecution the parents

family members of the unfortunate girl who has
untimely death.

and the

There is thus no possibility of the petitioners

influencing any witness.

15.

Clarifying that if revision petition filed against the order

framing charge succeeds and it is held that case is made out to
frame a charge under Section 304 IPC, it would be open to the
State to file an appropriate application seeking modification or
cancellation of the instant order, the

two petitions

stand

disposed of with the following directions :a)

Bail Application No.3701/2006 is disposed of extending
the interim protection of said petitioner
period of 4 weeks.

by a further

Since challan has already been

filed, said petitioner would seek a regular bail from the
learned Trial Judge who is directed not to require the
petitioner

to

formally

surrender

as

a

condition

precedent for deciding the application seeking regular
bail.
b)

Petitioner of Bail Application No.1191/2007 is directed
to be admitted to bail by the learned Trial Judge on his
furnishing a personal bond in sum of Rs.20,000/- with
one surety

in the like amount to the satisfaction of

learned Trial Judge in the above captioned FIR.
16.

It is

hoped and expected

that pertaining to the

application seeking regular bail to be filed by Mohan Singh,
learned Trial Judge would keep in mind the present order and the

fact that the husband of the deceased has been directed to be
admitted on bail by and under the present order.
17.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned counsel

for the parties.
