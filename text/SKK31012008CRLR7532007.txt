SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.
1. The petitioners being the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in
Crl. R. P. No. 772/2007 and Enforcement Directorate in Crl. R.P.
Nos. 753/2007 to 761/2007(hereinafter referred to as the said
petitioners) are aggrieved by the Orders dated 06-12-2007 &
13-12-2007 passed by the Ld. CMM and Ld. ACMM respectively
allowing the applications of the respondent seeking permission to
go abroad for a period of 30 days from 20-12-2007 to 20-01-2008
in different complaint cases pending before the Ld. CMM and Ld.
ACMM pertaining to the violations of Foreign Exchange Regulation
Act, 1973 (in short FERA) and Foreign Contribution Regulation Act,
1976 (in short FCRA).
To appreciate the merits of the case, it would be pertinent to pen
down a brief background of the cases.
Facts:
2. It is the case of the petitioners that with the adjudication
proceedings pending against the respondent in a number of cases
for such violations as mentioned aforesaid, a penalty of Rs. 9.65
crores was imposed on the respondent, to which not even a single
penny has been deposited by the respondent till date. An SLP to
the same effect is also pending. Apart from this, there have been
separate criminal complaints filed by the petitioners for such
CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007

Pg. No.2/21

violations. While the respondent has been enlarged on conditional
bail in these pending cases against him, one of the conditions
imposed on him is that the respondent shall not leave the country
without prior permission of the court and if he even desires to go
out of Delhi, he shall give prior intimation to the said petitioner
department about his programme and intimate the addresses and
places where he could be contacted.
3. It is stated that similar requests like the present one to go abroad
have been made by the respondent in the past where sometimes
the respondent has been allowed while the other times declined.
Such request was last made before the Ld. ACMM in 2004, when
the CBI intervened and opposed the said application along with
the Enforcement Department. One of the grounds for rejecting
the said application was the apprehension of the said petitioners
that the respondent may flee from the country and may not
return back to face the trial in the enforcement cases and
investigation

in

respect

of

conspiracy

in

Rajiv

Gandhi

Assassination case. The Ld. ACMM observed that the allegations
made against the respondent were serious in nature and the
possibility of his not returning back could not be ruled out. It was
also observed that the respondent had failed to adduce any
material to authenticate or substantiate his need to go abroad. In
consequence to this, the respondent filed a writ petition being WP
(Crl.) No. 723/2005 before this court. On

06-11-2007, this Court

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007

Pg. No.3/21

directed the Ld. ACMM to consider the matter only on the merits
of each complaint so filed. Accordingly, the two courts were
moved by the respondent and after hearing the matter, the Ld.
CMM and Ld. ACMM permitted the respondent to go abroad
subject to certain conditions. It is these orders to which the
petitioners have filed the present revision petitions.
Maintainability
4. The preliminary submission made by the respondent is on the
maintainability of such revision petitions. It is the case of the
respondent that the orders permitting the respondent to go
abroad are interlocutory orders and therefore, no revision lies
against such an order. Whereas, the petitioners plead that such
orders are not interlocutory orders but final orders.
5. The noteworthy submissions by the learned Additional Solicitor
General (ASG for short) in this behalf are that the said orders
finally determine the assertion of the respondent that he is
entitled to go abroad for a fixed period which makes the nature of
such order as final one and not an interlocutory order. It cannot
be said by any stretch of imagination that claim of right to travel
abroad is not an important right or liability. The order permitting
to travel abroad cannot be said to affect the particular aspect of
the trial, i.e. whether the respondent can be absent from the trial
and leave the jurisdiction of this Court. The learned ASG to
substantiate his case has relied on the judgment of Amar Nath &

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007

Pg. No.4/21

Ors. v. State of Haryana & Anr., (1977) 4 SCC 137 which has been
followed in Madhu Limaya v. State of Maharashtra (1977) 4 SCC
551,

where

the

term

interlocutory

order

came

up

for

consideration. It was held that orders which are matters of
moment and which affect or adjudicate the rights of the accused
or a particular aspect of the trial cannot be said to be
interlocutory order so as to be outside the purview of the
revisional jurisdiction of the High Court. In Madhu Limaya’s case
(Supra), it was laid down that where the High Court would have
no revisional power u/s 397(2), the High Court could in
accordance with one of the other principle exercise its inherent
powers as there is no other provision in the Code for the redress
of the grievance of an aggrieved party. The real intention of the
Legislature is not to equate the expression “interlocutory order”
as invariably being converse of the words “final order”. There
may be an order passed during the course of a proceeding which
may not be final yet it may not be an interlocutory order-pure-or
simple. Some kinds of order may fall in between the two which
may be taken to be orders of the type falling in the middle course.
6. In Rajendra Kumar Sitaram Pande v. Uttam, (1999) 3 SCC 134, the
Apex Court while upholding the test of intermediate or quasi final
order held that the revisional jurisdiction could be exercised in the
cases of intermediate or quasi final order. In K. K. Patel v. State of
Gujarat (2000) 6 SCC 195, the decisions of Amarnath’s case

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007

Pg. No.5/21

(supra), Madhu Limaye’s case (supra) and Rajendra Kumar’s case
(supra) were considered and upheld and the feasible test evolved
was whether by upholding the objections raised by a party, it
would result in culminating the proceedings, if so any order
passed on such objections would not merely be interlocutory in
nature as envisaged in section 397(2) of the Code. Hence, it is the
case of the petitioners that the proceedings in relation to the
petitioners’ claim of the respondent’s right to travel abroad were
culminated by the impugned order and thus, the High Court would
have the power to exercise its power of revision.
7. Alternatively, it is stated that this petition may be treated as a
petition under section 482. In relation to the same, the learned
ASG for the petitioners referred to the judgments of Col. Anil Kak
v. Municipal Corporation, (2005) 12 SCC 734 and Madhu Limaye’s
case (supra) wherein it was held that the label of the petition is
immaterial and irrelevant. The High Court has a power, right and
duty to do substantial justice to the party. In Puran v. Rambilas,
(2001) 6 SCC 338 it was held that High Court’s inherent
jurisdiction under S. 482 remains unaffected by provisions of S.
397(3).
8. Placing reliance on section 397 (2) of Code of Criminal Procedure
(in short the said Code) which expressly bars the exercise of
power of revision against any interlocutory order passed in any
appeal, inquiry, trial or other proceedings, the learned senior

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007

Pg. No.6/21

counsel for respondent stated that there have been precedents
laid down to the effect that interlocutory orders to be appealable
must be those which decide the rights and liabilities of the parties
concerning a particular aspect and that the language used in
section 397(2) is in the restrictive sense. While distinguishing
between what orders can be interlocutory orders and what cannot
be, the learned senior counsel for the respondent stated that the
scheme of laws in criminal and civil jurisdiction are different in
respect to interlocutory orders and that the orders made under
the provisions of Indian Penal Code are never interlocutory orders,
they are substantive orders. A reference to section 4 and 5 of the
Code

was

made

to

the

effect

that

in

criminal

matters,

interlocutory orders can be made only under the Code.
9. The learned senior counsel elucidating the meaning of the said
term referred to the judgment of Poonam Chand Jain v. Fazru
2005 CrLJ 100 wherein it was held that if the term interlocutory
order has to be defined in its natural and logical sense without
resorting to the Code or any other statute, then it can be
understood as an order which only decides a particular aspect or
a particular issue or a particular matter in a proceeding, suit or
trial but which does not however conclude the trial at all.
Therefore, it was submitted that if the impugned order is
comprehended in these proceedings, the order has to be
regarded as an interlocutory order because leave of absence for

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007

Pg. No.7/21

30 days from the Court would not finally dispose off the rights of
the parties to litigation.
10.Further, reliance was placed on the judgment of In re Robin
Kristo Mookerjee 10 Cal 268, to submit that the power of revision
could be exercised under section 397 only under two conditions,
i.e. where the findings were illegal or improper and where the
proceedings were irregular. It was pointed out that the revisional
power of the High Court merely conserved the powers of the High
Court to see that justice is done in accordance with the
recognized rules of criminal jurisprudence and that its subordinate
courts do not exceed the jurisdiction or abuse the power vested in
them under the Code or to prevent abuse of process of inferior
criminal courts or to prevent miscarriage of justice.
11.In addition to this, the argument advanced by the learned senior
counsel in support of his case was that every order of every court
is discretionary in nature. The attention of this court was brought
to the sections 205/273/317 CrPC and it was stated that the
condition for prior permission of the trial court can be understood
only with regard to the necessity of ensuring the presence of the
respondent in court during the hearing. Otherwise, the Courts are
to be very liberal and generous in granting exemption from
personal appearance and such presence should not be insisted
upon unless the presence of the accused is absolutely necessary
in the proceedings. In this behalf, the judgments of Gopal Ram &

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007

Pg. No.8/21

Ors. v. State of Rajasthan & Anr., 1994 (3) Crimes 559 (Raj),
Ramesh Chandra Lath v. State of Orissa, 1992 Cri.L.J. 2263 and
Feroze Khatoon v. State of Jharkhand, 2004 Cri.L.J. 1457 (Jhar)
were relied on by the learned senior counsel. It was submitted
that dispensing with the presence of the accused cannot be
considered as modification of the order of bail or affecting the
order of the bail but it is only a discretion exercised within the bail
order itself. Such discretion exercised by the learned magistrate
cannot be considered as an order resulting in culmination of any
part of the proceedings.
12.It is also stated that the right to travel abroad can only be
curtailed under the Passports Act, 1967 (in short the said Act)
under section 6(2) (f) read with sections 10 & 11 of the said Act
and that these provisions are the complete Code to restrict
travels abroad and no separate action has been taken in this
behalf against the respondent.
13.To counter the line of reasoning forwarded by the learned ASG
for the petitioners in respect of the petitions being treated as
ones under section 482 of the Code, the learned senior counsel
for the respondent has put forth the rulings of the Apex Court in
Hira Lal Hari Lal Bhagwati v. CBI, 2003 (5) SCC 257 wherein the
decision of G. Sagar Suri and Anr. v. State of U.P. and Ors.,
( 2000 ) 2 SCC 636 was followed and the relevant portion of the
same has been reproduced below:

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007

Pg. No.9/21

"Jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code
has to be exercised with great care. In
exercise of its jurisdiction the High Court is
not to examine the matter superficially. It
is to be seen if a matter, which is
essentially of a civil nature, has been given
a cloak of criminal offence. Criminal
proceedings are not a short cut of other
remedies available in law. Before issuing
process a criminal court has to exercise a
great deal of caution. For the accused, it is
a serious matter. The Supreme Court has
laid certain principles on the basis of which
the High Court is to exercise its jurisdiction
under Section 482 of the Code (State v.
Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335).
Jurisdiction under this section has to be
exercised to prevent abuse of the process
of any court or otherwise to secure the
ends of justice. Merely because the
accused persons had already filed an
application in the Court of Additional
Judicial Magistrate for the discharge, it
cannot be urged that the High Court
cannot exercise its jurisdiction under
Section 482 of the Code. Though the
Magistrate trying a case has jurisdiction to
discharge the accused at any stage of the
trial if he considers the charge to the be
groundless but that does not mean that
the accused cannot approach the High
Court under Section 482 of the Code or
Article 227 of the Constitution to have the
proceeding quashed against them when no
offence has been out against them and still
why must they undergo the agony of a
criminal trial."
14.On consideration of the submissions advanced by learned
counsel for the parties, it is obvious that there is no separate
action taken to prevent the travel of the respondent under the
said Act nor is the passport seized.

Thus the right of the

respondent to travel abroad is preserved within the meaning of

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007
No.10/21

Pg.

Article 21 of the Constitution of India as observed in Maneka
Gandhi v. UOI 1975 (1) SCC 248 .

It, however, cannot be

simultaneously lost sight of that at the stage of grant of bail, one
of the conditions of the said bail order was that the respondent
would surrender his passport and would not leave the country
without prior permission of the trial court and, even if, he desires
to go out of Delhi, he shall give prior intimation to the Department
about his programme and intimate the addresses and places
where he should be contacted.
15.It is once again not disputed that the bail order would be
revisable as it is in the nature of a final order.

The restriction to

travel abroad has been placed as a condition of the bail order.
Thus once the respondent is permitted to travel abroad subject to
certain terms and conditions, it is the relaxation of the said order
and hence, I am of the considered view that the revision would be
maintainable.
16.The judgment cited by the ASG appearing for the petitioners, in
fact, shows that there are orders in the nature which can be
categorized as 'intermediate' or 'quasi final' orders and which do
not strictly fall within the expression 'interlocutory order' as
opposed to 'final order'.

The restriction in filing a revision is only

in case of orders which are interlocutory in nature as per Section
392(2) of the said Code.

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007
No.11/21

Pg.

17.I am unable to accept the plea of the learned counsel for the
respondent that the impugned decision should be construed as
one which permits the respondent not to remain present in court
since there is no other restriction under the said Act for the
respondent to travel outside the country. This is so since it is not
a simplicitor permission not to remain present in Court, but the
permission to travel abroad varying the initial condition imposed
in the bail order.
18.The aforesaid being the position, the revision petition is held to
be maintainable.
Merits of the Case
19.The reasons as disclosed in the application by the respondent for
permission to go abroad are stated to be an invitation from one of
his disciples to visit his place and perform some yagna and to
deliver some lecture on religious matter. It is further stated that
the respondent had been granted permission to go abroad on
earlier occasions and every time he had returned to the country
after such visit.
20.Such request made by respondent has been opposed to by the
petitioners on various grounds that the reasons given for his visit
are inadequate and do not indicate any compelling/compulsive or
pressing need to go abroad. It is the case of the petitioners that
where on one hand the respondent has not met the requirements
of the penalty imposed on him and got a stay on the same on the

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007
No.12/21

Pg.

ground that he has no money, on the other hand, the respondent
has sought permission to go abroad, which are self-contradictory
statements in its own. Further, it is averred that the allegations
made against the respondent in ten different cases pending are
very serious in nature and the petitioners thus apprehend that
there is every likelihood of the respondent not returning back to
India and managing his stay abroad. The petitioners also
apprehend that the respondent being an influential person, may
tamper with the evidence in pending prosecutions.
21.It is submitted that the right to abroad as being part of personal
liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India would not
come into play in the case of the respondent since such a right is
not an unfettered right and reasonable restrictions can always be
imposed on a person in the interest of justice and the respondent
is a person who has contravened the laws of the country and thus
cannot in the garb of such a right subvert the process of law.
22.It has also been averred that the Ld. Trial court has failed to
appreciate the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in
Chandraswami v. CBI (1998) 9 SCC 380 where a similar request of
the respondent was rejected by the court.
23.The respondent in this behalf has brought the attention of this
court

to

para

7

of

the

judgment

Nemi

Chand

Jain

@

Chandraswami v. UOI of this court dated 06-11-2007 which has
been reproduced below:

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007
No.13/21

Pg.

“7. I consider that if any investigating
agency investigating a crime considers
that presence of any suspect was
necessary within India and he should not
be allowed to leave the country, the
investigating agency should request the
State/Central Government for passing an
appropriate order under the Appropriate
provisions of law, for putting restrictions on
the
movement
of
the
person.
If
investigation of a case continues for years
together, without an iota of evidences
having been collected, the personal liberty
of a person cannot be jeopardized only on
the
ground
of
investigation
being
continued. Had there been any additional
evidence collected by MDMA or CBI in last
9 years, CBI would have filed additional
charge sheet before the Court concerned.”
24.It is submitted that the respondent has been proceeded against
under section 8(1) read with section 56 of the FERA and the
punishment prescribed for such an offence if proved is a minimum
of 6 months extended up to 7 years. Relying on the judgments of
Gopal Ram’s case (supra) and Feroze Khatoon’s case (supra),the
learned counsel for the respondent states that the liberal rule of
granting permission to remain absent from court at the time of
hearing would apply since the respondent’s case would fall not
within the purview of “long imprisonment”.
25.As already stated that the right to travel abroad can only be
curtailed under the Passports Act, 1967 (in short the said Act)
under section 6(2) (f) read with sections 10 & 11 of the said Act.
26.It is the case of the respondent that the respondent has been
granted permission to abroad on earlier occasions during (1987 to

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007
No.14/21

Pg.

1995) the pendency of investigations of more serious offences
and had ultimately got acquitted in those matters and that the
FERA matters have been pending in the Department since 1982
when he was given such permission. In so far as the respondent
being not allowed to go abroad in 1998 is concerned, the learned
senior counsel pleaded that at that time criminal proceedings
were pending against the respondent in Lakhu Bhai Pathak’s case
instituted by the CBI but the respondent has been acquitted in the
said case and hence, the decision of the Supreme Court has
become otiose.
27.The learned senior counsel has also stressed upon the personal
liberty of the respondent and his right to go abroad to fall within
the purview of Article 21 of the Constitution by referring to the
case of Maneka Gandhi v. UOI's case (supra) where the Supreme
Court

has

observed

that

personal

liberty

makes

worth

human/person and travel makes liberty worthwhile. However, the
personal liberty and the fundamental rights granted to the
citizens

by

Constitution

are

not

absolute

and

reasonable

restrictions, as envisaged under Constitution of India as well as
warranted by the Security of State and circumstances, can be
imposed by the State.
28.A perusal of the impugned orders show that the learned trial
courts have considered the application of the respondent on
merits and have taken into consideration the pleas raised by the

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007
No.15/21

Pg.

respondent. Such pleas have been opposed to by the petitioners
on the similar grounds as raised in the present revision petitions.
The learned trial courts while taking note of all the facts and
circumstances prevalent in this case have opined that the
respondent is allowed to go abroad since no reasonable ground
has been made out to harbour the apprehension of the petitioners
regarding tampering of evidence. It was found that the trial was
proceeding and at this stage there could not be a question of
tampering with the evidence. In addition to this, necessary
conditions were also imposed on the respondent to ensure his
return.
29.The appreciation of the aforesaid factual and legal position
shows that the cases pending against the respondent in respect
of the Rajiv Gandhi Assassination case and Lakhu Bhai Pathak's
case do not stand in the way of the respondent as those issues
are dead qua the respondent.

The respondent, in fact, stands

acquitted in the Lakhu Bhai Pathak's case and there is nothing
else pending in that behalf. In so far as the investigation pending
in Rajiv Gandhi Assassination case is concerned, I am in full
agreement with the observations made in the judgment of Nemi
Chand Jain @ Chandraswami v. UOI of this court dated 06-112007 that the liberty of the respondent cannot be curtailed on the
ground of investigation which has been pending for the last 9
years.

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007
No.16/21

Pg.

30.The only pending cases against the respondent are the present
ones which relate to violation of FERA and

FCRA.

Thus the

earlier observations of the Supreme Court in Chandraswami and
Anr.v. CBI (Supra) would not apply now to the case of the
respondent.
31.The respondent prior to the restrictions imposed on account of
the Rajiv

Gandhi Assassination case and Lakhu Bhai Pathak's

case had visited abroad a number of times and come back
without ever violating the conditions of the bail. There is thus no
reason why the respondent should not be permitted to travel
abroad and merely general averments by the petitioners against
the respondent would not suffice.

It is this fact which has

weighed with the Trial Court which has granted permission to the
respondent to travel abroad subject to following conditions:
In respect of Crl. Rev. Petition Nos.753-761/2007:
“a) That he shall furnish FDR in the sum
of Rs.2,00,000/- as security for his return
back with an undertaking to report back
in the court after the expiry of 30 days
from the date of his departure failing
which the said amount shall stand
forfeited without giving any further
notice and he shall furnish the date of
departure in the undertaking;
b) That he shall furnish his address
during his stay abroad;
c) That he shall not seek extension of his
stay abroad on any other ground
including medical ground;

CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007
No.17/21

Pg.

d) That he shall authorize his counsel to
receive notice on his behalf during his
stay abroad;
e) That he shall produce his surety in the
court to give statement that he has no
objection in case he is allowed to go
abroad;
f) That he shall file the itinerary before
going abroad;
g) That he shall appear in the court on
the next date of hearing; and
i) That he shall surrender back his
passport on his return from abroad.”

In respect of Crl.Rev.Petition No.772/2007
“i) Applicant/accused shall furnish an
additional personal bonds of Rs.20 lakh
with one surety of the like amount;
ii) Applicant/accused shall furnish a FDR
for an amount of Rs. 10 lakh for surety
of his return to India in time;
iii) Applicant/accused shall not seek
extension of his stay in abroad in any
contingency;
iv)During his absence, he will be
represented by Sh.K.K.Manan, Advocate
and in no case due to the absence of
accused, the proceedings shall be
hampered with.
v)That applicant/accused shall file a
detailed affidavit disclosing his detailed
programme including his stay at various
station at abroad, telephone numbers
and residential address; and
CRL. REV. P.753/2007 to 761/2007 & CRL.REV.P.772/2007
No.18/21

Pg.

vi)Applicant/accused shall furnish the
details of the authorized persons to
receive any process from the court
during his stay in abroad on his behalf.”
32.The aforesaid terms and conditions are identical in nine cases
except Criminal Revision Petition No. 772/2007 where the
respondent was asked by the Trial Court to furnish additional
personal bonds of Rs.20 lakh with one surety of the like amount
and was further asked to furnish an FDR for an amount of Rs.10
lakh for surety of his return to India.
33.Learned ASG in the alternative had contended that in case this
Court was inclined to grant permission, then the respondent
should be directed to deposit the full amount of the amount
claimed from the respondent in view of the prosecution.
34.However, considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I
am not inclined to accept this plea. It may be noticed that during
the course of hearing, the counsel for the respondent was asked
to give an itinerary and as per the said itinerary it is now stated
that the respondent seeks to travel abroad only to UK, UAE and
Mauritius.
35.In the impugned order, the respondent has already been asked
to file a detailed affidavit disclosing his detailed programme
including his stay at various stations at abroad, telephone
numbers and residential address.

36.I am thus of the considered view that the respondent should be
permitted to travel abroad but subject to certain further
conditions/modified terms:
1. The first such additional

term is that the

condition no.(v) of the impugned order in
Criminal

Revision

Petition

No.772/2007

would uniformly apply to all the other nine
cases.
2. Insofar as the furnishing of the FDRs to
secure the return of the respondent to
India is concerned, the amount in each of
the nine cases

where an FDR is to be

furnished by the respondent in the sum of
Rs.2 lakh stands modified to an FDR in the
sum of Rs.10 lakh each.
3. In Criminal Revision Petition No.772/2007,
the FDR to be furnished by the respondent
as security for his return to India would be
for Rs.20 lakh instead of Rs.10 lakh, as
directed by the impugned order. Since the
respondent is stated to be going abroad at
the request of his disciples, it would not be
difficult

for

the

respondent

No.20/21

to

make

appropriate arrangements for furnishing
such security as directed in this Order.
4. The permission for the respondent to travel
abroad is restricted to 30 days in terms of
the impugned order but the period would
commence from the date of his departure.
37.The petitions are disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
38.The trial court record be sent back expeditiously.
