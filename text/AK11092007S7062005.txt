the partners of the plaintiff firm.

Act and

Delhi Sales Tax Rules, 1975. The plaint is signed, verified and

Page 2 of 7

on 1st April, 2004 a sum of Rs.27,45,261.84 was due from defendant to the
plaintiff company.

6.

The defendant company, therefore, issued a cheque bearing

No.727952 dated 11.12.2003 for a sum of Rs.24 lakhs drawn on Bank of
Punjab Ltd, L-40, Connaught Place, New Delhi towards the part payment of
the amounts due from defendant to the plaintiff for the price of the goods sold
and delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant company.

7.

The said cheque when presented by the plaintiff was returned by the

bankers of the defendant company on account of insufficient funds on
presentation in the account of the defendant.

8.

As the cheque given by the defendant toward part payment of

amounts due from the defendant to the plaintiff had been dishonored,
Therefore, the plaintiff sent a legal notice dated 9.1.2004 by registered post
and under postal certificate which was served on the defendant company
demanding the amounts due from the defendant to the plaintiff including the
amount of cheque which was dishonored. However, despite the notice of
demand being sent to the defendant company, the amounts due from the

CS(OS) No.706/2005

Page 3 of 7

defendant to the plaintiff company has not been paid.

9.

Consequently, the plaintiff filed a criminal complaint under Section 138

of Negotiable Instruments Act against the defendant company and one of its
Director, in respect of the cheque for Rs.24 lakhs which was dishonored on
account of insufficient funds which is still pending before the concerned
Criminal Court.

10.

As the amount of the cheque which was given by the defendant

company to the plaintiff company was dishonored, the present suit under
Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure was filed by the plaintiff.

11.

Summons under Order 37 Rule 2 (2) of the CPC in form No.4 in

Appendix B were issued to the defendant which was duly served, however,
no appearance was filed by the defendant.

12.

During the pendency of the suit the registered partner of the plaintiff

firm who had signed, verified and instituted the plaint on behalf of the plaintiff
firm had resigned and consequently the plaintiff had amended the plaint
incorporating the changes undergone in the plaintiff firm. Consequent to the

CS(OS) No.706/2005

amendment of the plaint the summons were issued again in the prescribed
form against the defendant and the summons were served by substituted
service by way of proclamation in the newspaper “Statesman” as well as by
affixation on the notice board. No appearance was again filed by the
defendant. Consequently, the averments made by the plaintiff in the plaint
are deemed to be admitted.

13.

The plaintiff has filed the certified copy of the cheque which was

dishonored, the original of which has been filed by the plaintiff before the
concerned criminal Court. The plaintiff has also filed the certified copy of the
bank memo dated 18th December, 2003 returning the dishonored cheque on

on the amount of Rs.24 lakhs, for which the cheque was given by defendant
