PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
The appellant is aggrieved by the directions issued

in the order dated 28.4.2006 requiring appellant to pay interest
to the insurance company on the principal sum which was
required to be paid by the insurance company to the claimants.
2.

Atender, died an untimely death at a road accident.

His mother, wife and minor sons claimed compensation under
the Motor Vehicles Act 1988. Appellant was the owner of the
vehicle in question.
Insurance

It

was

insured

with

National

Page 1 of 5
Company.

The appellant, the driver of the vehicle and the

insurance company were impleaded as respondents No.1, 2
and 3 in the claim petition.
3.

Appellant was served in the claim petition.

He

engaged a lawyer. He claims that his lawyer cheated him by
pocketing the fee and not appearing before the Tribunal as also
not informing the appellant as to what was happening before
the Tribunal.
4.

The insurance company took a defence that it was

entitled to avoid the policy for the reason it was a term of the
policy that the vehicle which was the subject matter of the
insurance would not be entrusted for being driven to a person
not possessing a valid driving licence. It was alleged that the
driver did not possess a driving licence which entitled him to
drive the vehicle which was the subject matter of the
insurance.
5.

The insurance company successfully proved that the

licence which was seized by the police after the accident, copy
whereof was made available to the insurance company, did not
permit the driver to drive a heavy duty vehicle. It permitted
him to drive a light motor vehicle.
6.

During trial the insurance company served notice on

the appellant under Order 12 Rule 8 CPC to produce the policy
Page 2 of 5
of insurance and the driving licence of the driver if appellant
had one to produce. In spite of service of said notice upon him,
appellant did not bother to attend the hearing before the
Tribunal.
7.

The result was that the Tribunal held that the

insurance company was entitled to avoid liability under the
policy of insurance, but in harmony with the law laid down by
the Supreme Court in the decision reported as 2004 (3) SCC
297 National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Swaran Singh wherein it
was held that the insurance company was liable to satisfy the
award in favour of the claimants and recover the same from
the assured, the tribunal held that on satisfying the award, the
insurance company could recover the amount from the
appellant.
8.

The insurance company satisfied the award and

proceeded to recover the sum paid over to the claimants by
seeking attachment of the property of the appellant.

The

appellant rushed to the Court and filed an application under
Order 9 Rule 13 CPC praying that the ex-parte award be set
aside. He produced what according to the appellant was the
driving licence shown to him by the driver when he had

engaged the services of the driver. He stated that his lawyer
had cheated him.

9.

The Tribunal caused an inquiry to be made and in

relation to the record of the licensing authority found out that
the driver of the offending vehicle possessed a valid driving
licence.
10.

As a result of this evidence which was brought on

record, learned Tribunal absolved the appellant from the
liability to reimburse the principal sum awarded and paid by
the insurance company to the claimants but opined that the
appellant was liable to reimburse the interest to the insurance
company for the reason had he dutifully participated at the trial
and

had

he

produced

the

driving

licence

in

question,

unnecessary trial on the issue of the driver possessing a valid
driving licence would have been avoided. That as a result of
delay, insurance company was saddled with the liability to pay
interest to the claimants.
11.

I concur with the view taken by the Tribunal for the

reason claim petition was filed on 3.2.1999.

Appellant was

served with a notice in the claim petition for 30.8.1999. The
award was published on 5.5.2005.

Appellant did not ever

bothered to contact his lawyer for 6 years.

Not only that,

during trial, insurance company served a notice under Order 12
Rule 8 CPC, Ex.R-1 upon the appellant to produce the licence
and the
Page 4 of 5
original policy.

Postal receipt Ex.R-2 evidences that the

registered envelope containing the notice was posted to the
appellant. AD card, Ex.R-4 shows that the postal envelope was
duly received by the appellant. This happened in the month of
December 2004. In spite thereof, appellant did not bother to
contact his lawyer or visit the Court to respond to the said
notice.
12.

It is a case where appellant has been grossly

negligent in defending the proceedings.

The negligence

borders on culpability.
13.

The appeal is dismissed.

14.

LCR be returned forthwith.
