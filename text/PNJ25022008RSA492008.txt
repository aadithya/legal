PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
The appellant has suffered 2 concurrent decrees of

ejectment and mesne profits against him.

Aggrieved by the

judgment and decree dated 5.12.2007 affirming the judgment
and decree of the learned Trial Judge dated 21.5.2007 instant
second appeal has been filed.
2.

Notwithstanding various questions framed in the

RSA No.49/08

page 1 of 14

memo of appeal at the hearing today, learned senior counsel
for the appellant urges that 4 substantial questions of law arise
for consideration in the instant appeal.
3.

The first substantial question of law sought to be

projected by learned counsel for the appellant is: whether the
suit for ejectment was barred under Order IX Rule 9 CPC on
account of an earlier suit for ejectment being dismissed in
default and not being restored? The second question sought to
be projected is whether by the act of filing a petition for
eviction before the learned Rent Controller and alleging that
the rent of the suit property was Rs.3500/- per month did
notice Ex.PW1/2 and Ex.PW1/3 dated 10.8.1990 and 22.1.1990
respectively stood waived?

Third question projected is

whether suit by only one co-owner was maintainable? Lastly it
is urged that on the evidence on record damages awarded
towards mesne profits @ Rs.25,000/- per month from 1.5.2002
till realization cannot be sustained.
4.

Having gone through the impugned judgments and

decrees and the relevant evidence on record, in my opinion no
substantial question of law arise for consideration in the
instant second appeal.
5.

My reasons are recorded briefly since the second

appeal is being dismissed in limine and I am concurring with
RSA No.49/08

page 2 of 14

the view taken by the learned courts below.
6.

The suit property, a three bedroom single unit

house in Hauz Khas on a plot of land ad-measuirng 512 sq.
yds. was let out to the appellant by late Shri S.S.Randhawa on
16.8.1981. Due to the enforcement of the Delhi Rent Control
Act 1957 the terms of the lease did not enure to the benefit of
the landlord for the reason a tenant could be ejected only on
one or more of the grounds specified in Section 14 of the Delhi
Rent Control Act being established; none were.
7.

Fortunately for the landlords, the Delhi Rent Control

Act came to be amended in the year 1988. Tenancies, where
monthly rent exceeded Rs.3500/-, were not covered by the
Delhi Rent Control Act.
8.

A suit for ejectment was filed before the learned

Civil Judge. The said suit bearing No.177/1992 (referred to in
the

impugned

judgment

as

bearing

No.177/1990)

was

dismissed in default on 17.1.1998. Admittedly, no application
was ever filed seeking restoration of the suit and hence the
suit was never restored. Instant suit seeking ejectment was
filed in the year 2002 after serving a notice dated 11.3.2002
Ex.PW1/11 determining the tenancy.
9.

In respect of the first so called substantial question

of law sought to be projected, the question which arises is :
RSA No.49/08

page 3 of 14

What would be consequence when a suit for ejectment is
dismissed in default?
10.

The answer is to be found in Order IX Rule 9 of the

Code of Civil Procedure. It reads as under :“9. Decree against plaintiff by default bars fresh
suit – (1) Where a suit is wholly or partly dismissed
under rule 8, the plaintiff shall be precluded from brining
a fresh suit in respect of the same cause of action. But
he may apply for an order to set the dismissal aside, and
if he satisfies the Court that there was sufficient cause
for his non-appearance when the suit was called on for
hearing, the Court shall make an order setting aside the
dismissal upon such terms as to cost or otherwise as it
thinks fit, and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the
suit.
(2) No order shall be made under this rule unless
notice of the application has been served on the
opposite party.”
11.

At the outset it may be stated that the principle

underlying Order 9 Rule 9 CPC is public policy; not to vex the
defendant for a second time on the same cause of action. But,
it is not the same as the rule of res judicata enshrined under
Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
12.

What are the consequences of a suit for ejectment

suffering a dismissal in default?
tenant in perpetuity?

Does the tenant become a

Does he become the owner of the

tenanted premises? Does the landlord loose the right to regain
possession for all times to come?

RSA No.49/08

page 4 of 14

13.

Ex facie, once a tenant always remains a tenant

unless the status changes by contract or by operation of law.
14.

Let us consider a situation where a suit for

ejectment of a tenant is dismissed on merits. Since it is not a
title suit for possession, but only one for ejectment, the
dismissal could be either on the ground that the lease has not
expired by efflux of time, or that the tenancy has not been
determined by a valid notice to quit or after such notice has
been served, by subsequent act of the landlord amounting to
waiver of the notice to quit, the notice has been waived. In
such situations the lease subsists subsequent to the date of
the decision, with the result that the lessor has no right of
ejectment save and except after the lessor re-chooses to eject
the tenant as per law.

In such a situation, the lessor-lessee

relationship subsists and on a subsequent cause a fresh suit for
ejectment can be brought.

A defendant against whom an

ejectment suit has been dismissed for default cannot be placed
at a higher pedestal viz-a-viz a defendant against whom a suit
has been dismissed on merits.
15.

The issue can be considered from another angle.

Dismissal of a suit for ejectment does not and can by no
stretch of imagination extinguish the ownership of the lessor
and confer the same upon the lessee.
RSA No.49/08

Similarly, it cannot
page 5 of 14

convert a lease of limited duration into one in perpetuity. At
the very best it operates as a waiver under Section 113 of the
T.P.Act or an assent of the lessee within the meaning of
Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act.

The lessee

remains a lessee. He continues to be liable for the rent that
accrues. Consequent to the dismissal of the suit the lessee is
not a tenant at sufferance but from month to month or year to
year (depending upon the lease) terminable at any future date
as provided under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.
16.

This is how a suit for ejectment differs from a title

suit for possession. The cause of action for an ejectment suit is
the determination of the tenancy with the expiry of a particular
tenancy month or by efflux of time. The termination for any
subsequent month would be a separate and a distinct cause of
action. The elapsing of each tenancy month and service of a
fresh quit notice gives a fresh cause of action.
17.

Since the subject matter of the first suit was

whether

the

tenancy

was

validly

determined

thereby

preventing an automatic renewal at the end of the month, the
dismissal of the suit cannot put it any better and ensure that
the renewal for the month ensuing did take place. It operates,
at best, as a waiver of the notice to quit, or assent to holding
over, but no more.
RSA No.49/08

page 6 of 14

18.

Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act reads as

under :“116.Effect of holding over – If a lessee or underlessee of property remains in possession thereof after
the determination of the lease granted to the lessee, and
the lessor or his legal representative accepts rent from
the lessee or under-lessee, or otherwise assents to his
continuing in possession, the lease is, in the absence of
an agreement to the contrary, renewed from year to
year, or from month to month, according to the purpose
for which the property is leased, as specified in section
106.”
19.

The words “or otherwise assents to his continuing in

possession” in Section 116 of the T.P.Act are sufficiently wide
so as to include the allowing of a suit to be dismissed for
default or abandoning a suit for ejectment under Order 23 Rule
1 and therefore will have the effect as provided by Section
itself that is to say the lease will be renewed from month to
month or year to year according to the purpose for which the
property is leased as specified in Section 106.

Any other

construction will not only be contrary to the statute but shall
be against

the very fundamentals

of a landlord-tenant

relationship.
20.

Even otherwise, a tenant at sufferance is also a

tenant. His rights may be enlarged or upgraded from a tenant
at sufferance to a tenant from month to month or year to year
but by no stretch of imagination can these be converted into

RSA No.49/08

page 7 of 14

an absolute ownership or a tenancy in perpetuity.

The

occupation would remain permissive. A fresh notice to quit is a
must since the earlier notice stands waived.
21.

Under the circumstances it cannot be held that

merely because an earlier suit for ejectment was dismissed in
default, no subsequent suit for ejectment could be filed.
22.

As noted hereinabove, fresh cause of action was

alleged by predicating a claim that notice for ejectment dated
11.3.2002 Ex.PW1/9 was issued and served. I note that at the
trial service of said notice has been established.
23.

An alternative submission in relation to aforesaid

plea which was made may also be considered. It was urged
that the factum of filing of earlier suit and its dismissal was not
brought to the notice of the Court when instant suit was filed
and hence the suit ought to have been rejected on account of
a fraud attempted to be played upon the Court.

It was also

urged that the landlady had taken recourse to an action under
Section 14 D of the Delhi Rent Control Act and had obtained an
order for eviction which was set aside by this Court in CM(M)
No.668/1998 vide decision dated 9.3.2000.
24.

In my opinion the suit was based on notice to quit

dated 11.3.2002 and hence all prior litigations and history
thereof was irrelevant.
RSA No.49/08

page 8 of 14

25.

The second so-called substantial question of law

sought to be urged was that admittedly the suit property was
let out at a rent of less than Rs.3500/- and notice dated
10.10.1990 and 22.1.1992 Ex.PW1/2 and Ex.PW1/3 being
notices of enhancement of the rent under Section 6(A) of the
Delhi Rent Control Act were waived on account of the landlady
suing for eviction by filing a petition before the learned
Additional Rent Controller. The eviction proceedings were
initiated after afore-noted notices were issued.

It is alleged

that in the eviction petition the landlady stated that the rent of
the premises was Rs.3500/- per month and not Rs.3850/- which
would have been the rent if afore-noted notices were given
effect to.
26.

To put it pithily, contention urged is that the

landlady had waived the notice Ex.PW1/2 and PW1/3.
27.

The learned Appellate Court has dealt with this

issue in paragraph 14 of its decision.
28.

By virtue of Section 6A of the Delhi Rent Control Act,

rents are liable to be enhanced by 10% every 3 years.

The

learned Appellate Court has taken note of the fact that when
the landlady sued for eviction before the learned Additional
Rent Controller, appellant took a defence that on account of
the 2 notices aforesaid, rent stood enhanced to Rs.3850/- per
RSA No.49/08

page 9 of 14

month and on said account the court of the Rent Controller did
not have the jurisdiction to entertain the eviction petition. The
learned Appellate Court has also noted that on 11.1.2002 in
presence of counsel for the parties authorized representative
of the appellant had made a statement on oath as under :“I
have
received
a
notice
of
demand/enhancement of rent dated 22.1.1992
where after rate of rent of the premises has
been enhanced to Rs.3850/- with effect from
1.2.1992 much before filing of the present
petition. Hence, this Court has no jurisdiction
to entertain the present eviction petition. I
have also taken a similar plea in my
application for leave to defend in Para-2 of the
said affidavit dated September, 1997.”
29.

eviction petition on account of the learned Rent Controller not
having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the lis.
30.

I concur with the view taken that the appellant

would be estopped from even pleading waiver.

It has to be

noted that if the land lady went before the Rent Controller
notwithstanding having issued the 2 notices, the tenant
predicated a defence under the 2 notices.

The landlady

acquiesced in the defence of the tenant. The appellant is now
estopped from alleging to the contrary.

RSA No.49/08

31.

The third stated substantial question of law sought

to be projected at the hearing was that admittedly the original
landlord S.S.Randhawa having died he was survived by his wife
and children and that the suit for ejectment filed by only one
co-owner was not maintainable.
32.

The learned Trial Judge and the learned Appellate

Court have dealt with the said contention.
33.

The decision of the learned Appellate Court on said

issue is at paragraphs 17 onwards of the impugned decision.
34.

The learned Appellate Court has noted that the

notices dated 10.10.1990 and 22.1.1992 for enhancement of
rent Ex.PW1/2 and Ex.PW1/3 were issued on behalf of all coowners. The learned Appellate Court has also noted that the
appellant admitted paying the rent to the sole plaintiff.
Further, testimony of the son of the plaintiff, namely S. Manjit
Singh Randhawa who appeared as PW-2 has also considered in
light of Ex.PW1/16 being a letter of authorization dated
4.2.2002 as per which all children of the plaintiff empowered
their mother to take necessary steps recording that they had
no objection to their mother suing for ejectment. I note that
Ex.PW1/7

is a deed of relinquishment dated 11.1.1989

executed by Smt.Iqbal Kaur, mother-in-law of the respondent
relinquishing her share in the suit property.
RSA No.49/08

page 11 of 14

35.

I additionally note that the learned Trial Court and

the learned Appellate Court has referred to a decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court reported as AIR 1976 SC 2335 Sh.Ram
Pasricha Vs. Jagan Nath & Ors. holding that a co-owner of a
property is deemed to be owner of each part of the property
and is entitled to maintain a suit for ejectment/possession
without impleading the other legal heirs.
36.

The last so-called substantial question of law sought

to be urged is that the determination of mesne profits @
Rs.25,000/- per month is without any evidence.
37.

The learned Appellate Court has dealt with this

issue in paragraph 24 of the impugned decision.
38.

The learned Appellate Court has referred to the

testimony of Tejinder Singh Randhawa, PW-3, who deposed
that a lease agreement dated 16.1.2003 pertaining to property
No.P-5, Hauz Khas Enclave, New Delhi fetched a rent of
Rs.95,000/- per month. The learned Appellate Court has also
referred to Ex.PW1/27 a newspaper citation pertaining to a
property in Hauz Khas offered to be let out at Rs.60,000/- per
month.
39.
an

Contention urged is that the testimony of PW-3 was
oral

statement

unsupported

by

proof

of

the

lease

agreement dated 16.1.2003. It is urged that the contents of a
RSA No.49/08

page 12 of 14

written document can be proved by proving the document
itself and in no other manner.
40.

The learned Appellate Court has recorded that the

locality Hauz Khas is a prime and posh colony of South Delhi.
The learned Judge has also referred to letter relied upon
Ex.PW1/27 and the testimony of PW-3.
41.

Mesne profits have been awarded with effect from

1.5.2002.
42.

Steep increase in rentals in Delhi is a matter of fact

of which a judicial notice can be taken of by the Courts.
43.

The suit property is a single unit comprising of 3 bed

rooms attached toilets, kitchen, drawing room with a store on
the first floor. Entire property is on rent. The plot size is 512
square yards. Rental of said property as of 2002 at Rs.25,000/per month determined by the learned courts below cannot be
faulted. If at all, the same appears to be on the lower side.
44.

I note that in relation to determination of mesne

profits there is always some element of guesswork. What has
to be ensured is that the finding has not to be the conjecture of
the Court. As long as there is some evidence to sustain the
same, the finding cannot be faulted.
45.

In my opinion Ex.PW1/27 is good evidence to

sustain the finding.
