BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.

A detailed order in Writ Petition No. 3124/207 entitled KRBL Ltd

v. Union of India and others has been passed by this Court today itself in almost
identical circumstances. The only material difference for the purposes of this
writ petition is that in the present case the petitioner had sought documents
relied upon in the show cause notice and details of the grounds mentioned in
the show cause notice.

That has not been supplied to the petitioner. In all

other matters, the circumstances with regard to the procedure adopted by the
Director General of Foreign Trade, were virtually identical as mentioned in the

WP(C)3124.07

other case.

Accordingly, the impugned order suspending the IEC

No.0590012096 is set aside. It would be open to the respondents to issue a
fresh show cause notice, along with documents upon which they rely, giving
the petitioner full opportunity of submitting a written representation as well as
of being personally heard, if they so desire.

The sum and substance of this

order is that the respondents shall comply with the requirements of natural
justice embodied in Section 8 of the said Act. With these directions, this writ
petition stands disposed of.
