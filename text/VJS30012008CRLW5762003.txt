JUDGMENT
1.

This is the second salvo of litigation filed by the Petitioner in

the High Court of Delhi.

WP(Crl.)576/2003

The earlier Writ Petition, bearing No.

page 1 of 11

Crl. W. 1219/2002 was dismissed by detailed Judgment dated
24.3.2003 of the Division Bench. To answer a technical objection as
to the maintainability of this Petition our attention has been drawn
to Lallubhai Jogibhai Patel -vs- Union of India, AIR 1981 SC 728 in
which it has been opined that the “application of the doctrine of
constructive res judicata is confined to civil actions and civil
proceedings. This principle of public policy is entirely inapplicable
to illegal detention and does not bar a subsequent petition for a
writ of habeas corpus under Art. 32 on fresh grounds, which were
not taken in the earlier petition for the same relief”.

2.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner contends that the

Petitioner has studied only upto the 4th class; that in the statement
recorded under Section 108 of the Customs Act it has been stated
by him that he is conversant, that is, could read and write only
Hindi; that the statement is also in Hindi.

3.

In Ground E of the Writ Petition it has been asseverated that

the Petitioner has not been supplied pari passu the Hindi
translation of sundry documents of the Grounds of Detention. The
argument is that this violates the Petitioner's infrangible rights
under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India, thereby rendering
the Detention Order non est. Our attention has been drawn to the

WP(Crl.)576/2003

page 2 of 11

“List of relied upon Documents” accompanying the subject
Detention Order, where the sundry documents find mention. In
paragraph 5 of the Counter Affidavit it has been pleaded
these averments

are

wrong, baseless

and

that

denied; “petitioner

was served upon all the documents in English as well as in its
Hindi translation. The receipt of the same has been acknowledged
by the petitioner himself and it is for this reason that he
never raised this ground either before the Central Advisory Board
or before this Hon'ble Court in

the earlier writ petition Crl. W.

1219/2002, which was dismissed on 24.3.2003”.

4.

Powanammal -vs- State of Tamil Nadu, JT 1999(1) SC 31 :

1999(2) SCC 413 and Kamarunnissa -vs- Union of India, AIR 1991
SC 1640 enunciates that the non-supply of a copy of a document
relied upon in the grounds of Detention must be viewed as fatal.
Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India was given effect to. The
distinction between a document which has been relied upon by
the Detaining Authority in the grounds of Detention and a
document which merely finds a reference in the grounds of
Detention, was delineated and emphasised upon. Powanammal had
represented that he could not understand English and, therefore,
should be supplied with a Tamil version of the copy of the Remand
Order, which the Court found had been relied upon. It was opined

WP(Crl.)576/2003

page 3 of 11

that since the non-supply was of a 'relied upon' document, precise
prejudice caused to the Detenu need not have been made good by
him.

5.

Paragraph 9 of the Powanammal is of general application

and paragraph 15 is topical to the issue canvassed before us:
9. However, this court has maintained a distinction
between a document which has been relied upon by the
detaining authority in the grounds of detention and a
document which finds a mere reference in the grounds
of detention. Whereas non-supply of a copy of the
document relied upon in the grounds of detention has
been held to be fatal to continued detention, the
detenue need not show that any prejudice is caused to
him. This is because non-supply of such a document
would

amount

to

denial

of

the

right

of

being

communicated the grounds and of being afforded the
opportunity

of

making

an

effective

representation

against the order. But it would not be so where the
document merely finds a reference in the order of
detention or among the grounds thereof. In such a case,
the detenue's complaint of non-supply of document has
to be supported by prejudice caused to him in making
an

effective

representation.

What

applies

to

a

document, would equally apply to furnishing translated
copy of the document in the language known to and
understood by the detenue, should the document be in a
different language.

WP(Crl.)576/2003

page 4 of 11

15. Adverting to the facts of this case, the appellant has
made a representation for supply of Tamil version of the
copy of order of remand and specifically stated that the
detenue could not understand the English language.
Admittedly, the Tamil version of order of remand was
not furnished to her. A perusal of the grounds shows
that the order of remand was relied upon by the second
respondent to reach subjective satisfaction, so the
detenue need not show that any prejudice was caused
to her due to non-supply of the Tamil version of order of
remand. Therefore, the High Court is not correct in
holding that non-furnishing of the copy of the order of
remand would not in any way prejudice the detenue.

6.

Ms. Bhayana, learned counsel for the Petitioner, has also

relied on M. Ahamedkutty -vs-Union of India, 1990 SCC(Cri) 258
where, as in the case before us, it had been opined that the bail
application

and

the

bail

order

were

vital

materials

for

consideration which would perforce have to be considered by the
Detaining Authority, even if not specifically mentioned in the list of
documents.

Since admittedly these documents had not been

supplied, the Detention Order was set aside.

7.

We find it necessary to revert back to Lallubhai in which

their Lordships had noted that non-supply of documents had not
been denied in the Counter Affidavit and that affirmation of the

WP(Crl.)576/2003

page 5 of 11

petitioner pertaining to the non-supply of relied upon documents
had thus remained unchallenged. These observations are, in fact,
the watershed between these precedents and the case before us.
We note that Powanammal had been cited and considered by the
Division Bench.

It is wholly inconceivable that, keeping the

pronouncements of the Supreme Court in view, the factual
assertion as to non-supply of relied upon documents would not
have been made before the Division Bench, if in fact this were so.
We, therefore, find credence in the pleadings in the Counter
Affidavit to the effect that the documents had been supplied to the
Detenu.

8.

The present Writ Petition is devoid of merit and is dismissed

on this short ground.

W.P.(Crl.) 578/2003
9.

The circumstances as well as the answer to the Preliminary

Objections is identical and has already been dealt by us above.

10.

The question raised in this Petition is that a fatal delay has

occurred in the consideration and disposal of the Representation
dated 16.4.2003, filed by the father of the Petitioner, namely, Shri
Satpal Popli after the disposal of the previous Representation of

WP(Crl.)576/2003

page 6 of 11

the Detenu/Petitioner. The contention of learned counsel for the
Petitioner is that the said second and subject Representation
raised the following point for the first time, viz., -”that although the
alleged incident took place on 26.4.2002 yet the impugned
Detention Order was not passed till 22.7.2002.

The impugned

Detention Order is liable to be revoked as there has been a long
and undue delay in passing the impugned Detention Order”. In the
previous Petition, that is, Crl. W.1219/2002 which was dismissed
by the Division Bench by Judgment dated 24.3.2003 it had been
noted that the Detenu/Petitioner made a Representation to the
Detaining Authority on 29.8.2002 which was rejected by Order
dated 11.9.2002; he made a Representation dated 23.9.2002 to the
Chairman

of

Government

the
but

Advisory
the

Board

Detention

and
Order

also
was

to the

Central

confirmed

on

10.10.2002.

11.

So far as the alleged delay in the disposal/decision of the

second Representation authored by the father of the Detenu is
concerned, the Respondents' response reads thus:It

is

respectfully

submitted

that

the

representation was received in the COFEPOSA unit
from the President's Secretariat on 28.04.2003 through
their letter dt. 26.04.2003.

The comments of the

Sponsoring Authority i.e. the DRI, New Delhi, on the

WP(Crl.)576/2003

page 7 of 11

said representation were called for on the same day i.e.
28.04.2003 itself. The Sponsoring Authority sent their
comments to the Detaining Authority vide their letter
dated 2.05.2003 which was received in the Office of the
Detaining Authority on 6.05.2003 (3rd and 4th May, 2003
were holidays being Saturday and Sunday respectively).
The COFEPOSA Section put up the relevant file with all
the connected papers to Deputy Secretary(COFEPOSA)
the next day i.e. on 7.05.2003 who after examining the
representation marked the file to the Joint Secretary
(COFEPOSA) i.e. the Detaining Authority on 8.05.2003.
The Joint Secretary (COFEPOSA) i.e. the Detaining
Authority considered the representation and rejected
the same being devoid of any merit on 8.05.2003 itself.
The Memorandum of Rejection of the representation by
the Detaining Authority was sent on 8.05.2003 itself,
both to Sh. Satpal Popli, father of the detenu herein,
who made the representation as well as to the
petitioner through the Jail Authorities where he was
lodged.

Petitioner received the same on 9.05.2003

through the Jail Authorities.
It is respectfully submitted that the file relating to
the said representation to be considered on behalf of
the Central Government was after examination by the
Dy. Secretary (COFEPOSA) marked to DDG and Joint
Secretary

(Admn.)

on

09.05.2003.

DDG

&

Joint

Secretary(Admn.) cleared the file and further marked
the file to Spl. Secretary & DG, CEIB, New Delhi, on the
same day i.e. 09.05.2003.

The Spl. Secretary & DG,

CEIB, considered the said representation on 13th May,
2003 (10th and 11th May 2003 being Saturday and

WP(Crl.)576/2003

page 8 of 11

Sunday respectively) and rejected the same on behalf of
the Central Govt. as he found no merit in the said
representation.

The file was received back in the

COFEPOSA Unit on 14.05.2003. The Memorandum of
rejection of the representation by the Spl. Secretary &
DG, CEIB, New Delhi on behalf of the Central Govt. was
sent both to Sh. Satpal Popli, the father of the
petitioner, who made the representation as well as to
the petitioner/detenu herein himself through the Jail
Authorities where he was lodged on 14.05.2003 itself
and was received by him on 19.05.2003 (17th & 18th
May, 2003 being Saturday and Sunday respectively)
through the said Jail Authorities.
Therefore, in the light of the above facts, the
contention of the petitioner/detenu herein that the
representation by his father was not disposed of is
misconceived, without basis and is liable to be rejected
by this Hon'ble Court.

12.

The

alleged

delay

in

the

disposal

of

the

second

Representation spans a period of five days. Learned counsel for
the Petitioner relies on Rama Dhandu Borade -vs- Shri V.K. Saraf,

Commissioner of Police, JT 1989(2) SC 579 wherein their Lordships
noted that - “...The only explanation offered by the third
respondent is that further information required from the State
Government was received by the third respondent on 17.10.88
after a delay of nearly 14 days and then the representation of the
detenu was disposed of on 27.10.88 within which period there

WP(Crl.)576/2003

page 9 of 11

were certain holidays. Barring that, there is no other explanation.
This delay, when scrutinised in the light of the proposition of law
adumbrated above, we are of the view that there is an inordinate
and unreasonable delay and the present explanation given by the
third respondent is not satisfactory and acceptable”.

13.

Next, our attention has been drawn to Rajammal -vs- State of

Tamil Nadu, JT 1998 (8) SC 598. After reproducing the extracts
from

Kundanbhai

Dulabhai

Sheikh

-vs-

District

Magistrate,

Ahmedabad, JT 1986 (2) SC 532 as well as K.M. Abdulla Kunhi and
B.L. Abdul Khader -vs- Union of India, JT 1991 (1) SC 216 their
Lordships observed that if delay is caused on account of any
indifference or lapse in considering the representation such delay
will adversely affect further detention of the prisoner. It is
significant that the Detention Order had not been set aside but
rather “further detention must necessarily be disallowed. We
therefore allow this appeal and set aside the impugned judgment.
We direct the appellant/detenu to be set at large forthwith”.

14.

Reverting back to the Petition in hand, we are satisfied that

there was no delay sufficient, per se, to defeat the Detention
Order, in the circumstances narrated in the Counter Affidavit of
the Respondents (extracted supra).

WP(Crl.)576/2003

We also find it necessary to

page 10 of 11

draw a distinction between the release of a detenu because of
delay in disposal of his Representation, and the quashing of the
Detention Order as a consequence of which the personal liberty of
the Detenu has been curtailed.

In the present case, the only

remaining relevance of the of the Writ Petition is for the quashing
of the Detention Order which would impact proceedings under
SFEMA.

15.

The Writ Petition is without merit and is dismissed.
