1 to 9

1. These present Criminal Revision Petitions are preferred by the Petitioners against the
charges framed by the Learned Additional Sessions Judge under Sections 498 A/ 304B
Indian Penal Code (IPC) by his order dated 6.11.2006
2. The brief facts necessary to decide this petition are that one Neelam (hereinafter
referred to as “the deceased”) was found hanging on 25.9.2004 in her matrimonial
house. She was declared dead in the hospital. She had died an unnatural death. The
deceased was married to Sunil Bansal (hereinafter referred to as “the husband”, he is
the petitioner in Criminal Revision Petition No.928/2006) on 2.4.1998. Two sons were
born out of the wedlock. The other revision petitioner

is brother in law of the

deceased. The statement of the deceased’s parents and brother were recorded by the
police on the day of the death. Those statements were that the deceased was living
happily in the matrimonial home since the inception of marriage, and there were no
disputes regarding any issue. The deceased was ill, according to them, as she was
suffering from epilepsy/ giddiness since a couple of months. They also stated that no
body could be blamed for her death.
3. It is alleged that on the next day i.e. 26.9.2004 the father of the deceased made a
contrary statement. On the basis of this statement an FIR was lodged by the police
against the Petitioners. Certain allegations were made with regard to harassment,
beatings given to the deceased by her in-laws and dowry demands right from the
eighth month of the marriage. The allegations were general in nature; the Petitioners
allege that the deceased's said relatives did not mention as to when such harassment
was caused to her. The deceased’s father had also stated that she had made a phone
Crl. R.P No. 928/06&893-95/06

2 to 9

call to him on 24.9.2004 and complained that she was beaten by her in-laws for many
days and was not given anything to eat and drink. On the basis of these statements, the
trial court charged the Petitioners for committing offences under sections 498A/304B
IPC.
4. The Petitioners urge that had there been any dowry demands or harassment such as
denial of food and water to the deceased, then her parents and brother would not have
stated that their daughter was living happily in her matrimonial house. Counsel for the
Petitioners further urged that the couple were married for the last 6 years and there was
never any complaint regarding harassment, etc. The Petitioners' counsel urges that
there was no dying declaration of the deceased alleging that they were responsible for
her death. The Post mortem report did not corroborate the allegations of beatings, apart
from the ligature marks on the neck of the deceased which were due to hanging. There
was no other external injury found on the body of the deceased.
5. The Police, on 25.9.2004 recorded three statements; one by the deceased’s father,
secondly of her mother and the third of her brother. All of them stated that the
deceased was happily married; there was no quarrel on any issue. According to them,
the deceased fell ill, as she was suffering from epilepsy/giddiness. They also stated that
no one could be held responsible for her death.
6. On 26.9.2004, the father of the deceased recorded another statement with the Police. It
is on basis of this statement an FIR was lodged against the Petitioners. He stated in the
statement that he had spent around Rs.9 lakhs for the wedding, and that after some
time the deceased’s husband and in laws started beating her for bringing less dowry.
Crl. R.P No. 928/06&893-95/06

3 to 9

The father stated that the Petitioners, on the deceased first child’s birth demanded a
Maruti car and Rs.2 lakhs in cash but the deceased carried just Rs.1 lakh to the
matrimonial house for which she was again harassed. The father stated that this
continued until the birth of the second son, when again a demand for another car and
Rs.2 lakhs was made. He further stated that the deceased on 24.9.2004 at about 7.00
pm called him up, weeping and complained that she was harassed by her in-laws and
husband, that she was not given anything to eat or drink. She had also mentioned that
her life was under threat. Her father stated that he would pick her up the next day. He
also stated that his daughter was killed by the Petitioners.
7. The trial court charged the Petitioners for committing offences under Sec.498A/304B
IPC, the extracts of the order dated 6.11.2006 are as follows:
“The Complaint shows allegations of dowry demand and
harassment on account of dowry soon after marriage and a day
before her death she made a telephone call stating about the
harassment meted out to her. The phrase soon after death is not
to be interpreted strictly but according to the facts of the case.
Where after marriage the deceased was harassed on numerous
occasions on account of dowry and the deceased last
complained to her parents, a day before her death, do not take
out the case from the purview of phrase ‘soon before death’.
Thus, a case of dowry demand is made out against the accused
Sunil Bansal, Leelavati, MadanLal and Parveen Bansal. Hence
a charge u/s 498A/304B/34 IPC be framed against all the above
said accused persons”
8.

The learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioners Mr. D.C.Mathur argued

that the statement of the father of the deceased contain allegations pertaining
dowry demands, harassment and beatings by the in-laws. There is no specific
allegation against any one; the allegations are general in nature. The learned
Crl. R.P No. 928/06&893-95/06

4 to 9

Senior counsel argued that the ingredients of Sec.304-B had not been fulfilled
in this case as there were no allegations regarding dowry demands from the
year 2000 to 2004. He also urged that the post mortem report did not show any
external injuries but ligature marks caused by hanging. It was argued that the
later statement of 26.9.2004 is unreliable, as it is an after thought. The father
gave two contrary statements in the case which could be a result of pressure
from the relatives. If the second statement is taken to be true then he did not
state the circumstances under which the first statement was recorded. The
counsel also argued that mere denial of food and drink for a couple of days
does not constitute dowry demand, so as to call for a charge under Section
304-B, IPC.
9.

Counsel relied on the decision reported in Sarbans Singh Vs. State of

NCT 2005 (116) DLT 698; and Gurcharan Kumar vs. State of Rajasthan
2003(2) SCC 698 to say that a revisional court, examining the correctness of
charges, has to sift and weigh the materials, and if convinced that such proof or
evidence, capable of conversion into material and legal evidence, can uphold
the charges. According to him, the trial court fell into error in not sifting the
materials; and if it had exercised jurisdiction properly, charges would not have
been framed.
10.

The petitions were opposed by Mr. Sharma, learned counsel for the

State.

It was contended that the charges were framed after correctly

appreciating the materials on record. Counsel submitted that merely because
Crl. R.P No. 928/06&893-95/06

5 to 9

some contradictions existed between two statements, the trial Court could not
have inferred that no evidence existed. The later statements, it was submitted
deserved to be taken into account. Mr. Sharma further urged that the death had
occurred in unnatural circumstances, clearly pointing to the complicity of the
accused. The Court had applied its mind as was evident from the fact that the
married sister-in-law was not charged with committing the offences; the Court
charged the rest of the accused.
11.

The facts narrated above are that the death occurred on 24.9.2004. On

that date three statements were recorded. They were by the father, mother and
brother of the deceased. Those statements nowhere implicated the petitioners.
On the contrary uniformaly the parents stated that the deceased was living
happily ever-since her marriage on 20.3.1996.

It also recorded that the

deceased had fallen ill and was suffering for about three months prior to the
incident. Subsequently on the next date; the father got another statement
recorded, alleging harassment of the deceased for dowry at the time of birth of
the children, in 1998 and 2000. He also alleged that cash was given for the
purpose. He further alleged that for a while, the deceased stayed with him, in
the parental house but later went back to the matrimonial home. He alleged
that on 24.9.2004, his daughter rang him up alleging that she was being
continuously beaten and that she apprehended being killed by the accused.
The brother of the deceased also recorded another statement, much later on
6.1.2005. Interestingly in the second statement of the father no mention is
Crl. R.P No. 928/06&893-95/06

6 to 9

made about the earlier statement recorded regarding death of his daughter. He
also did not mention as to under what circumstances he had to make a fresh
statement and whether the earlier statement was given under compulsion or
any kind of threat. His son in his statement on 6.1.2005 alleged that the
statements of all the three namely himself, his father and his mother were
obtained under duress by the police, on 24.9.2004.
12.

The above facts would show that the incidents relating to demands for

dowry and acts of harassment pertaining to dowry, allegedly occurred either
soon after the marriage or around the time of the birth of two children – 1998
and 2000. None of the allegations point to any kind of cruelty, harassment or
cruel behaviour having any proximity, in point of time to the date of death ie
25.9.2004.

Though there is no thumb rule as to what is meant by the

expression “soon before” death of a woman, under Section 304-B yet despite
substantial flexibility, the charge cannot be maintained, if the acts are remote
in point of time.

The Supreme Court has held in Kedya Perumal Vs. State of

Tamil Nadu AIR 2003 SC 3828 and Yashoda Vs. State of M.P. 2004(3) SCC
98 that there should not be too much of a time-lag between cruelty and
harassment in connection with demand for dowry and the death in question. It
was also held that there must exist a proximate and live link between the effect
of cruelty based on dowry demands and death of the woman. The Court held
that if the alleged incident of cruelty is remote in time and has become stale,
not to disturb

mental equilibrium of the woman, it would be of no

Crl. R.P No. 928/06&893-95/06

7 to 9

consequence.
13.

The evidence in this case about dowry harassment, which could have

been the cause for death of the deceased, is at best sketchy and most certainly
contradictory.

Both sets of statements recorded by the relatives of the

deceased point to dowry or other demands proximate to the marriage and birth
of the two children which would go back to at least 3-4 years before the
incident. In these circumstances, on exercise of sifting of materials and
particularly keeping in mind the existence of two contradictory statements, it
cannot be said that a grave suspicion exists about the commission of offence
under Section 304-B, by the Petitioners. It is well-settled that if two views at
charge framing stage exist, based upon the materials available, the view
favouring the accused is to be preferred. (Ref. Dilawar Balu Kurane Vs. State
of Maharashtra 2002 SCC (Crl) 310.
14.

As far as the allegation regarding commission of offence under Section

498-A IPC is concerned I am of the opinion that in view of the un-safe and
contradictory nature of the statements, that charge too cannot be framed. The
statement of the deceased father, as observed in the preceding paragraph, did
not mention anything about the first statement made on 24.9.2004.

That

previous statement had completely ruled out any complicity by the petitioners.
Yet in the statement recorded by his son much later on 6.1.2005, some sort of
explanation for the omission was sought to be given – it was alleged that the
first statement was recorded under duress. These statements in my considered
Crl. R.P No. 928/06&893-95/06

8 to 9

opinion are not only contradictory but unsafe and the Court cannot be expected
to prefer one version over the other. From the record it appears that the
deceased’s father is a businessman of some means. His son too is an adult. At
that time he was 24 years. Therefore, the attempt at improving the case at each
stage, in my opinion injects suspicion as to their veracity. Without any further
comment it could be said that they do amount to bringing in two versions,
which can be considered by the Court. In such an event the Court would be
within its rights in concluding that the version supporting the discharge of the
petitioner is to be preferred.
15.

For the above reasons the petitions have to succeed; they are

accordingly allowed. The charges framed against the petitioner-accused are
hereby set aside.
