SANJIV KHANNA, J:

1. Dr. Samarendra Mohan Mukherjee, the appellant who appears

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 2

in person, has filed this Appeal against the judgment dated 3

rd

January, 2006 passed in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 23/1988. The
appellant has prayed for enhancement of compensation
awarded to him in para 12 of the impugned judgment. Other
observations and findings of the learned Single Judge have not
been challenged and questioned by the appellant. No cross
appeal has been filed by the respondent.
2. On

2

nd

February,

1987,

applications

were

invited

for

appointment to the post of Registrar, Indian School of Mines,
Dhanbad (hereinafter referred to as ISM, for short). The said
post

was

in

the

pay

scale

of

Rs.1500-2500/-.

The

advertisement specifically stated that the said pay scale was
under revision.
3. The appellant was interviewed and placed at serial no.2. One
Mr. S. Srikant was placed at serial no.1. The appellant who
appears in person has drawn our attention to documents placed
on record to show that Mr. S. Srikant was not eligible and did

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 3

not meet the eligibility criteria for appointment to the said post
but he was wrongly and malafidely placed at serial no.1. He
also submitted that Mr. S. Srikant had made a wrong statement
about his educational qualifications etc.

The appellant

submitted that right from the beginning, the appellant was being
discriminated due to sinister motives and prejudice against him.
4. ISM thereafter rejected the candidature of Mr. S. Srikant and
issued offer of appointment to the post of Registrar vide letter
dated 4

th

August, 1987

to the appellant. The letter of

appointment stated that the pay scale offered of Rs.1500 â€“
2500/- was pre-revised. The appellant was asked to submit
copy of the letter of appointment duly signed, in token of
acceptance of the offer within ten days, failing which, the offer
of appointment would stand cancelled.
th

5. The appellant accepted the said offer on 10 August, 1987 by
making necessary endorsement on the letter of appointment
th

and also by sending letter dated 10 August, 1987.

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 4

6. It was the case of the respondent, that ISM vide telegram dated
th

8 August, 1987 had informed the appellant that the offer of
appointment dated 4

th

August, 1987 stood withdrawn for the

time being. Subsequently, by another telegram, the appellant
was intimated that position with regard to appointment to the
said post would be intimated in due course. However, on 1

st

December, 1987, the appellant was informed that the
Chairman/Executive Board had ordered cancellation of the
existing panel for appointment to the post of Registrar and the
said post would be re-advertised with revised pay scale.
7. Aggrieved, the appellant filed Writ Petition (Civil) No. 23/1988 in
th

this Court, which was admitted on 16 August, 1988. The said
writ petition

was disposed of after nearly 18 years

impugned judgment dated 3

rd

vide

January, 2006. Learned Single

Judge examined the contention of the parties in detail and
came to the conclusion that the offer of appointment dated 4
th

th

August, 1987 was accepted by the appellant on 10 August,

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 5
th

1987 before the telegram dated 8 August, 1987 was received
by him. It was held that the respondent had failed to produce
any document to establish that the said telegram was received
th

before acceptance dated 10 August, 1987 was despatched by
the appellant. Learned Single Judge also held that ISM had
acted arbitrarily in withdrawing the offer of appointment without
any justifiable ground and cause. Pay revision was always in
contemplation as was apparent from the advertisement dated
nd

2 February, 1987 inviting applications for the post of Registrar
wherein it was mentioned that the pay scale of Rs.1500-2500/was under revision. The fact that the pay scale was under
revision was also mentioned in the offer of appointment dated
4

th

August, 1987. Thus mere pay revision was not a valid

ground and justification for withdrawing the offer of appointment
and denying appointment to the appellant, as revision of pay
scale was on the anvil even when the post was advertised.
Learned Single Judge has given a specific finding that the

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 6

appellant was wrongly and due to malice in law denied
appointment as Registrar in ISM.
8. ISM has accepted the judgment passed by the learned Single
Judge and has not filed any appeal against the said judgment.
The appeal was admitted vide Order dated 8

th

May, 2006.

Thereafter, no cross objections have been filed.
9. The appellant had submitted that the learned Single Judge has
erred in restricting the relief to payment of difference of pay
scale of Education Officer, University Grants Commission
where the appellant was working in 1987 and the pay scale
admissible to Registrar, ISM for the period between 1

st

st

September, 1987 and 1 September, 1988 with 6% interest for
st

the period w.e.f. 1 January, 2000 till the date of payment of the
amount.

He submitted that the said finding has been

erroneously made on the ground that the appellant was to be
on probation for a period of two years. It was submitted that in
terms of the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge, the

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 7

appellant would be entitled to about Rs.14,244/- or there about
being the difference between the pay scale of the Education
Officer, University Grants Commission and Registrar, ISM for a
st

st

period of one year from 1 September, 1987 to 31 August,
1988 and Rs. 5128/- towards interest @ 6% per annum for six
years.
10.The appellant has filed some charts/calculations by which he
claims that he has lost about Rs. 9,91,501/-

on account of

difference in salary between the two posts. In view of the
findings of the learned Single Judge, he claims that entire
difference in salary including difference in pension, should be
paid because respondent-ISM had wrongly failed to appoint
him to the post of Registrar.
11. After filing of the writ petition in 1988, the Court by Order dated
7

th

April, 1988 had restrained the respondent-ISM from reth

advertising the post of Registrar. On 16 August, 1988 by a
detailed Order, a Division Bench of this Court disposed of the

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 8

application-C.M.No.44/1988, prima facie holding that the stand
of the respondent-ISM in withdrawing the offer of appointment
on the ground of revision of pay scale in the post of Registrar,
was not justified. It was observed that in spite of repeated
questioning, the respondent-ISM was not able to show what
th

transpired between 4 August, 1987 when offer of appointment
th

was issued to the appellant and then on 8 August, 1987 when
the said letter was directed to be kept under abeyance. The
Court also noticed that the post advertised was in the pay scale
of Rs.1500-2500/- but it was clearly stipulated that the said pay
scale was under revision. Therefore, mere revision of the pay
scale was not justifiable reason and a ground to re-advertise
the post after having followed the selection procedure and
selecting the appellant.
12.The said Order was vacated ex-parte and without notice to the
th

appellant vide Order dated 18 May, 1994 but the said Order
st

was immediately stayed vide Order dated 1 June, 1994. By

LPA NO. 437/2006
Order dated 17

Page No. 9
th

April, 1995 passed in C.M. No.4966/1994,

learned Single Judge in the interest of justice and keeping in
view the balance of convenience, allowed the respondent-ISM
to re-advertise the post of Registrar and specifically observed
that in case the appellant was to succeed in the writ petition,
the Court had ample powers to give him necessary relief.
13.Keeping all these aspects in mind and in view of the peculiar
facts of the case, we have to decide what relief should be
granted to the appellant. As noticed by the learned Single
th

Judge, the appellant superannuated on 30 June, 2000 from
University Grants Commission and his claim for difference in
pay scales, therefore, necessarily is for the period from 1987
till he superannuated i.e. in case he had been appointed as
th

Registrar, ISM in terms of appointment letter dated 4 August,
1987. We have also to keep in mind the findings of the learned
rd

Single Judge in the judgment dated 3 January, 2006 that the
appellant was arbitrarily denied appointment and the facts

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 10
th

stated above, including the order dated 17 April, 1995 vacating
stay passed in CM No. 4966/1994 holding that in case the
appellant succeeds he shall be granted necessary relief.
14.In the present Appeal, notice was also issued to University
Grants Commission with whom the appellant was working
before his superannuation. This notice was issued to find out
the pay scale and emoluments that had been paid to the
th

appellant from 1987 till his superannuation on 30 June, 2000.
It appears that the appellant was also promoted during this
period in the University Grants Commission, first as Deputy
Secretary and thereafter as Joint Secretary. However, we
cannot be oblivious to the fact that in case the appellant was
appointed as Registrar, ISM he may have progressed further.
At the same time, this Court is not awarding damages in favour
of the appellant and against the respondent-ISM. Law of
damages also requires evidence, calculation by applying the
principle of mitigation of damages, etc. Equities had to be

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 11

balanced. Keeping in mind the above circumstances and the
factual matrix, payment of Rs.19372/- as directed in terms of
the Order passed by the learned Single Judge is rather low.
The appointment letter dated 4

th

August, 1987 stated that

appointment could be terminated by one month's notice or one
month's salary in lieu thereof by either side during the period of
probation or in case of temporary appointment. Appointment
offered to the appellant was permanent appointment, which
would have entailed probation period in terms of service rules.
This ground by itself however cannot justify payment of
difference in salary restricted to a period of one year. The
appellant had filed the writ petition in 1988 and succeeded after
a long drawn battle vide judgment dated 3

rd

January, 2006.

Supreme Court has also repeatedly observed that costs
imposed on the losing party should be effective and
corelateable to the expenditure that the party which has
succeeded may have reasonably incurred. Moreover, this Court

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 12
th

by interim Order dated 17 April, 1995 had itself observed that
in case the appellant was to ultimately succeed in the writ
petition, the Court had ample power to give necessary relief to
the appellant in the interest of justice. We may in this regard
also refer to a recent decision of the Supreme Court in
Bhagabati Das (Sarkar) versus Calcutta University and
others reported in (2007) 7 SCALE 781 wherein a candidate
was wrongly denied appointment to the post of Lecturer which
was challenged in a writ petition. The writ petition was decided
after a considerable time in favour of the candidate. Division
Bench also upheld the decision of the Single Judge and
directed that the candidate should be given the benefit of the
pay scale of Lecturer. The Supreme Court, on appeal filed by
the candidate, held that in view of the findings recorded by the
Writ Court, the candidate was entitled to both back wages as
well as retirement benefits which were required to be recalculated. The respondents were also directed to pay costs

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 13

which was quantified at Rs.1 lac.
15.In view of above, we feel that the appellant should be paid a
lumpsum amount of Rs. 2 lac by the respondent-ISM towards
cost of litigation as well as to secure ends of justice as
admittedly the appellant was wrongly denied appointment as
Registrar, ISM. This will be also in accord with the Order dated
th

17 April, 1995 passed by the learned Single Judge that in the
interest of justice the appellant would be compensated and
granted necessary relief in case he was to succeed in the writ
petition. Restricting relief to the difference in pay scales for a
period of one year would be unfair and unjust to the appellant.
Even if it is presumed that the appellant would have been on
probation for a period of two years, it does not necessarily
follow that he would not have been confirmed and appointed
regularly after the expiry of the probation period. The impugned
order passed by the learned Single Judge is accordingly
modified

and

respondent-ISM

is directed

to

pay

LPA NO. 437/2006

Page No. 14

compensation of Rs. 2 lacs to the appellant. The aforesaid
amount will be paid to the appellant within a period of 2 months,
failing which the respondent shall be liable to interest @ 10%
per annum from the date of this order.
