respondent that the shop was his only source of livelihood and
the sale of the shop would make him jobless. It is thus agreed
that if on any future date, the respondent wants to sell the
shop, the plaintiff would have the first right to purchase the
shop and such an arrangement would continue for a period of
five years. In case of eventuality aforesaid, the price payable
by the petitioner would be as specified in the agreement to
sell dated 18.11.2005 with an escalation of 10 per cent per
annum on the agreed amount being calculated on a compound
basis annually.
(2)The petitioner is present in court as also the respondent and his
wife and the agreement has been arrived at out of the free consent
of the parties who have affirmed to the same in the Court. The
parties and the counsels have signed the order sheet in token of
acceptance of what is recorded in the Order.
(3)The petition stands disposed of leaving the parties to bear their
own costs.
