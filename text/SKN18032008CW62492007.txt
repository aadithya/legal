SANJIV KHANNA, J.:

1.

Common questions of law and similar facts are involved in the

present writ petitions. With consent of the parties, Writ Petition (Civil)
No. 6249/2007 titled Jai Singh and Others versus Union of India

W.P. (C) Nos. 6249, 6254, 6264, 7170, 7491,
7521, 7564, 7374, 7381, 7382 & 7959/2007

Page No. 3

and Others is treated as a lead case. This common judgment will
accordingly dispose of Writ Petition (Civil) No. 6249/2007 titled Jai
Singh and Others versus Union of India and Others and other
cases. On 28th April, 1972, notification under Section 4 of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1898 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) was issued
for acquisition of large tracks of land in village Nangal Dewat for
public purpose viz. extension of Palam Airport. This was followed by
a declaration under Section 6 of the Act on 22nd August, 1972 and
thereafter Land Acquisition Collector announced Award No. 16/198687. Compensation was paid to persons entitled to the same in
accordance with the Act and the said question is not subject matter of
the present writ petitions.
2.

In 1982, nearly 366 residents of village Nangal Dewat filed Writ

Petition No. 481/1982 titled Daryao Singh and Others versus
Union of India and Others challenging the acquisition proceedings
in respect of village Nangal Dewat. The writ petition was disposed of
on 2nd August, 2001 with the learned Single Judge recording that the
petitioners therein had given up their challenge to acquisition and had
restricted their arguments at the time of hearing to their prayer for
rehabilitation/residence at an alternative place. The Court recorded
statement of International Airport Authority that land had been
acquired for rehabilitation and a scheme for allotment of land for
residential purposes had been formulated. The order further records
that all persons whose land had been acquired and whose name

W.P. (C) Nos. 6249, 6254, 6264, 7170, 7491,
7521, 7564, 7374, 7381, 7382 & 7959/2007

Page No. 4

appeared in the award would be allotted residential plots in terms of
the scheme. The Court thereafter dismissed the writ petition after
recording that the respondents had agreed to allot alternative
residential plots under a scheme, to all persons whose land had been
acquired. A reading of the said order dated 2nd August, 2001 makes
it clear that alternative land for residence was to be allotted under a
scheme but only to those persons whose land were subject matter of
acquisition and were covered by the award. The said order did not
record any concession for persons who were not owners of land but
were awarded compensation for super-structure, trees etc. It is well
settled that in India owner of land need not be owner of a superstructure constructed on the land and vice versa.
3. Subsequently, a review application was filed but the same was
dismissed by an order dated 18th May, 2005. While dismissing the
said application, it was noticed that the petitioners therein do not
have any enforceable right for allotment of an alternative plot in law
and can only claim the same under a scheme, as formulated.
4.

Another Review Application No. 9312/2001 was filed by Harijan

and Backward Jan Kalyan Samiti. It was stated in the application
that Gaon Sabha land allotted in the name of four communities viz.
Makbuja Jullahan, Makbuja Chamaran, Makbuja Kumharan and
Makbuja Ahle was in possession and occupation of individual
persons and the said individuals

were entitled to allotment of

W.P. (C) Nos. 6249, 6254, 6264, 7170, 7491,
7521, 7564, 7374, 7381, 7382 & 7959/2007

Page No. 5

individual alternative residential plots. The review application was
dismissed by a speaking order on 16th December, 2004, with the
learned Single Judge observing as under:“Learned counsel for Harijan and Backward Jan

Kalyan Samiti points out that names of those
persons forming part of the Samiti have not
been included in the list. The Nodal Officer
present in Court has explained that reason for
the same is that the allotment was made by
Gaon Sabha in respect of certain individual
persons who have been included in the list
while in certain other cases allotment of land
was made to the Community and not to
individual persons. It has, thus, not been
possible to identify the individual persons since
the names do not figure in the record. There is
no dispute about the extent of the land which
was allotted by Gaon Sabha to the community
as per the records.
I am, thus, of the considered view that in terms
of the total land allotted, such community would
also be entitled to allotment of plots as a group.
How they divide the same between themselves
is their business.”

5.

Thus, the prayer of the applicant Samiti therein that the persons

who were in occupation of the community land should be allotted
separate or individual alternative plots was rejected. It was held that
in case of community land, allotment would be made to the
community and not to individuals and the community may divide the
allotted land amongst the individuals.
6.

It appears that the scheme after being formulated faced

difficulties in implementation and several applications were filed in

W.P. (C) Nos. 6249, 6254, 6264, 7170, 7491,
7521, 7564, 7374, 7381, 7382 & 7959/2007

Page No. 6

W.P. (C) No. 481/1982 for directions. These applications were
disposed of by a detailed order dated 18th May, 2005, with the Court
giving several directions to the Nodal Officer who had been
appointed for verifying cases for allotment of alternative plots. The
Court once again noticed the contention of some of the applicants
that they were entitled to individual or separate alternative plots on
the ground that they were in occupation of community land. Noticing
the contention, the learned Single Judge of this Court in his order
dated 18th May, 2005 observed as under:“

The Nodal Officer presented a list of
eligible persons numbering 316 copies of
which were given to the parties. Harijan and
Backward Jan Kalyan Samiti made a
grievance on 16th December, 2004 in court
that the names of the persons forming part of
the Samiti have not been included in the list.
The Nodal Officer clarified that since Gaon
Sabha allotted land to the community, the
alternate land has to be allotted to the
community as a group and not to individuals
wherever allotment was made to individuals
by Gaon Sabha, they would be considered
for alternate allotment. What remained to be
determined was the entitlement of persons to
plot and size thereof.”

7.

Thus, the contention that persons in occupation of community

land or who had built structures on community land were entitled to
separate individual alternative residential plots, was rejected by this
Court. It was held that the community land belonging to Gaon Sabha
was allotted to the four communities and their case was distinct and

W.P. (C) Nos. 6249, 6254, 6264, 7170, 7491,
7521, 7564, 7374, 7381, 7382 & 7959/2007

Page No. 7

separate from cases of persons, who were in recorded possession of
land in the revenue records in their individual capacity and right.
8.

It has been clarified in the affidavit filed by Land Acquisition

Collector (South-West) that land belonging to Gaon Sabha was
allotted to the four communities in the consolidation proceedings in
the years 1953-54. In revenue records entries were made in the
name of the four communities.

The revenue records did not

recognize any individual right in the community land. As per revenue
records, the land was reserved for common utility purpose (Shamlat
Deh). Noticing the above facts, the Nodal Officer by his order dated
9th November, 2006 dismissed the claims made by the petitioners for
being allotted alternative residential plots in their individual names
holding that the matter was fully covered by the orders passed by this
Court on 16th December, 2004 and 18th May, 2005. However, the
Nodal Officer noticed that some of the applicants had produced old
record which contained a list of 122 persons prepared in the year
1958 indicating that these persons were allotted independent plots in
their individual names measuring between 100-150 square yards.
However, the said allocation/division was not was incorporated in the
revenue records, Khatauni records, etc. The Nodal Officer held that
it was beyond his jurisdiction to go into all these aspects as the issue
was already concluded by the orders passed by this Court on 16 th
December, 2004 and 18th May, 2005, rejecting the claims of the
applicants for allotment of individual plots.

W.P. (C) Nos. 6249, 6254, 6264, 7170, 7491,
7521, 7564, 7374, 7381, 7382 & 7959/2007

9.

Page No. 8

This led to second round of litigation with some persons

including Harijan and Backward Jan Kalyan Samiti filing Civil Writ
Nos. 17778/2006 and other writ petitions.
10.

As per the scheme formulated and approved by this Court,

maximum size of an alternative plot cannot be more than 650 square
metres. In terms of the said scheme, each community would have
been entitled to allotment of a residential plot of land measuring 650
square metres that had to be divided amongst different persons.
With a view to grant further relief to backward communities, a
meeting was held in the Chamber of Joint Secretary (Civil Aviation)
on 14th March, 2007 to look into the issue of eligibility for alternative
plots to

persons belonging to backward classes, who were in

occupation of community land. The question of eligibility came up for
consideration. The Committee noticed that a list of 122 persons was
prepared in the year 1958 but the said list was not a part of revenue
records. The Committee recommended that this list of 122 persons
would be the outer limit for examining eligibility for allotment of
alternative plots. The Committee further recommended that in order
to examine entitlement, a fresh survey of the community area should
be conducted by a joint team of revenue officials, LAC officials and
AAI officials to ascertain the individuals and the actual area in their
possession. The report given by the Committee was accepted by the
Ministry of Civil Aviation specifically clarifying that this list of 122
persons prepared in the year 1958 would be the outer limit. On 14th

W.P. (C) Nos. 6249, 6254, 6264, 7170, 7491,
7521, 7564, 7374, 7381, 7382 & 7959/2007

Page No. 9

June, 2007 Ministry of Civil Aviation constituted another committee of
a Deputy Director, DDA, Assistant General Manager, Airport
Authority of India and SDM (South West). The said Committee
thereafter examined each and every claim. A team of officials
consisting

of

Tehsildar,

Kanoongo,

Patwari

along

with

representatives of the Airport Authority of India and DDA visited the
said village from 29th June, 2005 to 4th July, 2007 and verified the
claim of each and every person, who had claimed any right on the
basis of his occupation of community land. The committee also
measured the land found to be in possession of an individual at the
time of verification.
11. Alternative land has been allotted to 63 persons who fulfill the
two-fold criteria. Firstly, that his name or name of his forefathers was
mentioned in the list of 122 persons prepared in 1958 and secondly,
that they were found to be in possession of community land at the
time of survey between 29th June, 2007 to 4th July, 2007.
11A. Contention of the petitioners herein is that this dual criteria
adopted by the respondents is illegal. It is stated that the criteria
adopted is arbitrary and discriminatory and, therefore, offends Article
14 of the Constitution of India as the criteria adopted in other cases
was the 1972 survey list. In other cases actual possession in 2007
was not the relevant eligibility criteria. My attention in this regard is
also drawn to order dated 31st May, 2007 passed in Writ Petition Civil

W.P. (C) Nos. 6249, 6254, 6264, 7170, 7491,
7521, 7564, 7374, 7381, 7382 & 7959/2007

No. 17778/2006 titled Harijan and Backward Jan Kalyan Samiti
and Others versus Union of India and Others and other cases,
wherein it has been recorded as under:“8.

Today, in the course of his submissions,
Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned senior counsel for the
AAI on instructions form(sic) Shri Sanjeev
Jindal, Under Secretary, Ministry of Civil
Aviation, makes the following statement:

The report of the Committee
constituted by the Joint Secretary,
Civil Aviation to look into the issue
of allotment of alternative plots in
respect of the land recorded in the
name of Communities in Village
Nangal Dewat has been accepted
by the Ministry. The residents of
land recorded in the names of
Communities would be considered
for allotment of individual plots and
such eligibility would be considered
on the basis of the list of 122
persons that was prepared in the
course of 1958 Consolidation
Proceedings and this list of 122
persons would be the outer limit for
examining
the
eligibility
of
alternative plots.
The eligibility would be considered
on the basis of the same criteria
which has been evolved for
considering the eligibility of other
persons in the rehabilitation
scheme.

9.
After making the above statement Mr.
Sanjay Jain states that the Govt. having agreed
with the suggestion made in the report of the
Committee, the Order dt. 16.12.2004 passed by

W.P. (C) Nos. 6249, 6254, 6264, 7170, 7491,
7521, 7564, 7374, 7381, 7382 & 7959/2007

Page No. 11

Justice Kaul will not come in the way of
individual plots being allotted in favour of the
eligible persons from among the list referred to
hereinabove.”

12.

I have examined the above contentions of the petitioners. I

may note here that in the writ petition it is stated that the petitioners
are entitled to individual plots or plots of a bigger size by including the
area, as per 1972 survey. In the year 1972, the Land Acquisition
Collector’s office had conducted survey of the village abadi or the lal
dora area and the extended abadi. There were no revenue records
in respect of the lal dora area but survey was required as the lal dora
land had been acquired. Survey was necessary to record details of
persons in occupation of land and structures constructed thereon for
payment of compensation. In lal dora area possession itself is
treated as equivalent to ownership. As far as extended abadi area
was concerned, in land revenue records or jamabandi Gaon Sabha
was recorded as the owner-bhumidar of the land, which was declared
to be Shamlat Deh land that had been allotted to the four
communities. The survey report of 1972 in respect of the extended
abadi only recorded details of structure, trees and whether any hand
pump or other improvements had been made in the extended abadi
area. No compensation for land was paid to persons in occupation of
community land in the extended abadi. The land already belonged to
and was owned by Gaon Sabha. Compensation was paid for the

W.P. (C) Nos. 6249, 6254, 6264, 7170, 7491,
7521, 7564, 7374, 7381, 7382 & 7959/2007

structures, trees and other improvements made on the land by
persons in occupation of community land in the extended abadi. On
the request of the Court, the respondent after examining the survey
report of 1972 has filed a chart in the case of 46 petitioners. The said
chart is as under:““

of the 1958 list of 122 persons, if the 1972 survey is made the basis
for allotment. In this regard, it is highlighted that on the basis of
2007survey, 63 persons from the 1958 list of 122 persons, have been
found to be eligible. It is also clear from the 1972 survey that in most
cases no construction or structure existed on the community land in
the extended village abadi. Only in few cases compensation was
awarded for built up structure. In most cases, trees, hand pumps, etc,
existed on the community land.
14.

Under the Land Acquisition Act, compensation is payable to

owners of the land or the super-structure. There is no enforceable
right under the said Act on the basis of which owner of a superstructure can make a claim for allotment of an alternate plot. An
enforceable right may arise under a scheme, which may be framed
by Government for rehabilitation. A person cannot claim a legal right
for allotment of an alternative residential accommodation on the basis
of the said Act, de hors a scheme. I may also note here that the
present case does not pertain to acquisition of agricultural land.
Supreme Court in Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited and Another
versus Sangh Dass and Another reported in AIR 2005 Supreme
Court 891 and Narmada Bachao Andolan versus Union of India
and Others reported in AIR 2005 Supreme Court 2994 has held that
rehabilitation schemes can furnish enforceable legal rights.

1958 survey list has been taken as the basis or the outer limit

for making allotments. The other condition imposed is that the said
person or his legal representative should be in possession of land in
2007. Thus, an additional eligibility criterion of actual possession in
2007 has been imposed. This eligibility condition is justified and fair
as allotment of alternative land is being made in the year 2007 and,
therefore, the survey list of 1958 cannot be the sole basis.
Occupants of the community land in 1958 may have shifted or
moved to another area. In these circumstances, the twin conditions
imposed by the respondents cannot be termed as arbitrary. In fact,
the respondents were justified in imposing the condition that the
persons mentioned in the 1958 survey list or his legal representative
should be in actual physical possession in 2007.
16. The petitioners relied upon the statement made by the learned
counsel for the respondent-AAI as recorded in the Order dated 31st
May, 2007 that the eligibility criteria for persons mentioned in the
1958 list, would be on the basis of the criterion as was involved in
other cases. The petitioners are reading too much in the said
statement, for if the same eligibility criterion had to be applied, then
the only requirement was to examine the 1972 survey list. This could
have been recorded and directions issued. The eligibility criterion
was still under consideration and being examined. It cannot be said
that the respondents had given up their right to frame eligibility criteria
or the said statement prevents them from fixing eligibility criteria. It is

not for the Court to frame the criteria and no directions were given by
the Court in the Order dated 31st May, 2007. It cannot be said that in
view of what is recorded in the Order dated 31st May, 2007, the
respondents are bound to follow the survey list of 1972.
17.

The persons in occupation of community land and individual

owners of land constitute two separate and distinct classes. In the
case of community land, Gaon Sabha was the owner and the land
was allotted to the community. The land was recorded as Shamlat
Deh in revenue records. Names of individuals were not recorded in
the revenue records. No individual could have claimed any right on
the said land. It was for benefit of all members of the community and
not for individual benefit. Member of the community may and could
shift, vacate and move from one place to another. Community was at
liberty to allow any person occupy and use the land. The 1958 list did
not result in entries in revenue records or confer individual rights. It
is too late today for the petitioners to allege that there is no difference
between the petitioners, who were in occupation of community land
and others. The distinction was accepted by this Court as is clear
from the orders dated 16th December, 2004 and 18th May, 2005.
Therefore, the petitioners cannot insist that the 1972 survey list
should be made the basis for allotment of alternative plots and the
respondents could not have taken the 2007 survey, as the basis for
allotment.

W.P. (C) Nos. 6249, 6254, 6264, 7170, 7491,

What should be the terms and conditions of allotment are policy

matters. This Court cannot frame guidelines or policy. It is the role
of the Executive to frame guidelines or policy for allotment of
alternative plots. Courts have limited role and can strike down a
policy or guidelines if they offend Article 14 of the Constitution of
India. For this, petitioners have to establish and prove that the
guidelines/policy is arbitrary, discriminatory or irrational on applying
the test of Wednesbury’s principle of unreasonableness. In view of
the above discussion, petitioners have not succeeded in establishing
any violation.
19.

I do not find any merit in the present writ petitions and the same

are accordingly dismissed. No costs.
