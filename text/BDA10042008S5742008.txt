1.

The plaintiff placed a purchase order on the defendant No.1

for supply of High Carbon Ferro Chrome. The payment was to be made
by the plaintiff through a letter of credit.

It is stated by the learned

counsel for the plaintiff that the plaintiff placed an order for 300 Metric
Tonnes of High Carbon Ferro Chrome upon the defendant No.1. It is
further submitted on the basis of the averments contained in the plaint
IA 3867/2008 in CS(OS) 574/2008

Page No.1 of 13

that the defendant No.1 has only supplied 195 Metric Tonnes out of the
order of 300 Metric Tonnes. It is also submitted by the learned counsel
for the plaintiff that the original rate agreed upon by the parties was Rs
60,000/- per Metric Tonne. Subsequently the rate has been increased to
Rs 63,000/- per Metric Tonne on account of increase in the chrome
content in the said goods. The purchase order, according to the learned
counsel for the plaintiff, was placed on 03.01.2008 and the same was
confirmed by the defendant No.1 on the same day. The purchase order
that was referred to by the learned counsel for the plaintiff is the one that
has been placed at page 7 of the plaintiff's documents and it refers to a
quantity of 300 Metric Tonnes. The learned counsel then submitted that
a letter of credit was opened at the instance of the plaintiff by the
defendant No.2 (the issuing bank) on 08.01.2008 for a sum of Rs 76 lacs.
This was, however, amended on 09.01.2008 for a sum of Rs 1.59 crores.
The increase in the value of the letter of credit was due to the increase in
the price of the goods as also the increase in the quantity of goods. The
earlier LC was in respect of 100 Metric Tonnes at the rate of Rs 60,000/per Metric Tonne.

The amended LC was in respect of 200 Metric

Tonnes at the rate of Rs 63,000/- per Metric Tonne. Thereafter, supplies
were made by the defendant No.1 to the plaintiff on 10th and 12th of

IA 3867/2008 in CS(OS) 574/2008

Page No.2 of 13

January, 2008. The total extent of the supplies that were made was of
195 Metric Tonnes.

2.

On 12.01.2008 a bill of exchange was drawn on the basis of

the said supply of 195 Metric Tonnes and on the basis of the goods
having a chrome content of 65%. The bill of exchange was for the
amount of Rs 1,58,88,330/-. It is the case of the plaintiff that the goods
that were received by the plaintiff from the defendant No.1 were
despatched to third parties by the plaintiff. It is also contended that those
goods when received by the third parties disclosed that they did not have
the requisite chrome content of 65%.

It is further alleged that the

defendant No.1 did not supply the full quantity as agreed, that is, 300
Metric Tonnes as a result of which the plaintiff was constrained to
purchase 100 Metric Tonnes from other sources at a much higher rate of
Rs 76,000/- per Metric Tonne. The learned counsel for the plaintiff drew
my attention to a copy of the letter dated 18.01.2008 received from one
of the third parties to whom the plaintiff supplied the goods, which
indicates that there was variation in the chrome content. On the same
day, that is, on 18.01.2008 the plaintiff apparently sent a letter to the
defendant No.1 requiring it to depute a chemist to carry out a joint

IA 3867/2008 in CS(OS) 574/2008

Page No.3 of 13

inspection at the buyer's plant so that the matter with regard to the
chrome content could be sorted out. He submitted that despite such a
letter, the defendant No.1 did not respond and no chemist was deputed.
As a consequence of the shortfall in the quality of the goods, the third
party to whom the plaintiff had supplied the goods, raised various debit
notes totalling Rs 10,28,240/-.

3.

Mr Sandeep Sethi, the learned senior counsel appearing on

behalf of the plaintiff, submitted that the documents presented to the
bank for the purposes of encashment of the letter of credit did not
conform to the terms of the letter of credit and, therefore, the plaintiff
was entitled to the injunction restraining the defendant No.2 from paying
under the letter of credit. The learned counsel submitted that the analysis
done by the plaintiff's purchaser clearly indicated that the chrome content
was far less than what had been agreed upon between the parties and
what had supposedly been despatched by the defendant No.1.

The

learned counsel referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case
of U. P. Cooperative Federation Ltd. v. Singh Consultants and
Engineers (P) Ltd.: (1988) 1 SCC 174. In particular, he referred to
paragraph 34 wherein the Supreme Court observed that the opening of a

IA 3867/2008 in CS(OS) 574/2008

Page No.4 of 13

confirmed letter of credit constituted a bargain between the banker and
the seller of the goods which imposed on the banker an absolute
obligation to pay. The banker was not bound or entitled to honour the
bills of exchange drawn by the seller unless they and such accompanying
documents, as might be required thereunder, were in exact compliance
with the terms of the credit. It was contended on the strength of these
observations that the bill of exchange drawn by the defendant No.1 in the
present case as well as the documents accompanying the same were not
in exact compliance of the terms of the credit and, therefore, the plaintiff
was entitled to the injunction that it was claiming.

4.

Mr Bhardwaj, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf

of the defendant No.1, submitted that letters of credit, like bank
guarantees, cannot be injuncted unless and until fraud is pleaded and a
clear case of egregious fraud is established. He submitted that in the
present case, admittedly, no fraud has been pleaded. On the contrary, he
submitted that the negotiations between the parties started on
03.01.2008. At that point of time the quantity agreed upon by the parties
was 300 Metric Tonnes. The packing was to be done in 50 kg double
gunny bags and without any marking and the price was, at that point of

IA 3867/2008 in CS(OS) 574/2008

Page No.5 of 13

time, settled at Rs 60,000/- per Metric Tonne on the basis of 60% chrome
content pro rata.

He also submitted that the condition at that point of

time was that the price was ex plant. He submitted, with reference to the
above, that the stipulation that the packing should be without any
marking has a significance. The fact that the plaintiff has accepted
delivery of such unmarked goods would, therefore,

not allow the

plaintiff to later contend that the objections raised by the third party
purchasers were in respect of the very goods which were supplied by the
defendant No.1. It was at the instance of the plaintiff that the goods were
unmarked. Had the goods been marked, as was normally the case, then
the same could be easily identified and the chrome content in those
goods could also be ascertained.

5.

Apart from this, the learned counsel submitted that there was

suppression of facts on the part of the plaintiff. He submitted that the
plaintiff had not disclosed that consequent upon the initial agreement for
supply of 300 Metric Tonnes of High Carbon Ferro Chrome, the entire
contract was novated inasmuch as the quantity had been reduced to 200
Metric Tonnes and the price had also been altered from Rs 60,000/- per
Metric Tonne to Rs 63,000/- per Metric Tonne. He submitted that this is

IA 3867/2008 in CS(OS) 574/2008

Page No.6 of 13

clear from the letter dated 10.01.2008 (which wrongly mentions the year
as 2007) at page 11 of the defendants' documents which speaks of the
amendment from 300 to 200 Metric Tonnes. The amended purchase
order is at page 14 of the defendants' documents and that also mentions
200 Metric Tonnes instead of the earlier figure of 300 Metric Tonnes.
The learned counsel then referred to paragraph 13 of the plaint to show
that the amendment in the contract between the parties, bringing down
the quantity from 300 to 200 Metric Tonnes, has not at all been
mentioned. On the contrary, the plaint proceeds on the basis that the
contract between the parties remained at 300 Metric Tonnes. He further
submitted that the supplies that were made were of goods having a
chrome content of 65% and certificates to that effect had been issued by
the defendant No.1. A sample certificate dated 10.01.2008 is at page 32
of the plaintiff's documents. Such certificates have also been submitted
to the negotiating bank for the purposes of obtaining payment under the
letter of credit. Mr Bhardwaj then referred to the document at page 22
of the plaintiff's documents which is a letter dated 11.01.2008 issued by
the plaintiff to the defendant No.2. The letter clearly stated that the
plaintiff accepts all discrepancies in documents for payment under the
letter of credit in question and that the plaintiff undertakes and

IA 3867/2008 in CS(OS) 574/2008

Page No.7 of 13

indemnifies the bank for all losses and consequences. There is also a
direction to the bank to do the needful and release the payment against
the said letter of credit. It is the case of the plaintiff that this letter,
though addressed to the bank, was never sent to the bank but was handed
over to the defendant No.1. On the other hand, the learned counsel for
the defendant No.1 submits that the letter was sent to the bank and a copy
only was handed over to the defendant No.1. He also submitted that the
copy which was handed over to the defendant No.1 bore the stamp of the
bank and a copy of such letter has been filed at page 12 of the
defendants' documents. He submitted that the stamp was fraudulently
obtained by the plaintiff inasmuch as the bank has refuted having
received this letter from the plaintiff. Furthermore, Mr Bhardwaj also
pointed out the contents of paragraph 10 of the plaint which deal with
this letter. The said paragraph clearly indicates that the letter dated
11.01.2008 was issued by the plaintiff and that the plaintiff had written
to the defendant No. 2 whereby an undertaking had been given by the
plaintiff that it would be responsible for the discrepancies in the
documents. It was the plaintiff's case in the said paragraph that it was
only on the basis of having written the said letter that the defendant No.1
agreed to despatch the goods.

6.

After the supplies were completed, the attitude of the plaintiff

altered completely and by a letter dated 19.01.2008 written to the
defendant No.2 the plaintiff requested the bank not to honour the letter of
credit on account of various discrepancies.

However, those

discrepancies did not mention the variation in the chrome content which
is now sought to be made a ground for seeking injunction. The learned
counsel for the plaintiff states that at that point of time the question of
chrome content had not arisen inasmuch as the third party purchasers of
the plaintiff had written to the plaintiff later. In response, Mr Bhardwaj
submits that paragraph 14 of the plaint itself records that the plaintiff
came to know of the alleged shortcomings in the quality and description
of the material on 18.01.2008 whereas the letter noting the alleged
discrepancies was issued on 19.01.2008.

Yet, despite the plaintiff's

alleged knowledge of the shortcomings in the quality, there was no
mention of the deficient chrome content in the letter of 19.01.2008
wherein other alleged discrepancies in the documents were pointed out.
The learned counsel concluded his arguments by submitting that since no
case of fraud has been pleaded, there can be no question of any
injunction being granted in favour of the plaintiff and against either the

IA 3867/2008 in CS(OS) 574/2008

Page No.9 of 13

defendant No.1 or the defendant No.2 so as to prevent payment under an
unconditional and confirmed letter of credit. The learned counsel for the
defendant No.1 referred to various decisions of the Supreme Court,
which are as under:(1)

Ors: (1981) 2 SCC 766;

Having considered the arguments advanced by the learned

counsel for the parties as well as the various decisions relied upon by
them, it is apparent that a letter of credit just as a bank guarantee, is not
concerned with the underlying contract.

The contract between the

plaintiff and the defendant No.1 is independent of the contract evidenced
by the letter of credit. The letter of credit constitutes a bargain between
the banker and the seller of goods which imposes on the baker an
absolute obligation to pay provided the documents are not discrepant. If
the buyer has any grievance against the seller then the buyer has all
opportunities to sue for damages etc. The disputes in the underlying
contract cannot be made a ground for seeking an injunction of payment
under a letter of credit.

It is well settled that the bank cannot be

prevented by a party at whose instance the letter of credit was issued,
from honouring the guaranteed credit unless and until the said party is
able to establish fraud at the instance of the seller / beneficiary. The
fraud must not only be suspected fraud but established fraud and that too
of an egregious nature.

As noted in Federal Bank Ltd. (supra),

irrevocable letters of credit are “the life blood of international
commerce” and, if I may add, domestic commerce.

8.

In the present case the plaintiff has raised a dispute with

regard to the variation in the chrome content in the said goods. It is the
case of the plaintiff that the chrome content in the goods is not what the
defendant No.1 purports it to be and, in fact, the chrome content of the
goods is much lower than what the defendant No.1 had represented. This
is a dispute with regard to the quality of goods which the plaintiff has
received from the defendant No.1. It is, on the other hand, contended on
the part of the defendant No.1 that the chrome content was 65% as would
be evidenced by the certificates issued by them and which would form
part of the documents accompanying the bill of exchange. The dispute
between the plaintiff and the defendant No.1 with regard to the quality of
goods is one concerning the underlying contract and is not the concern of
the defendant No.2. The defendant No.2 is only concerned with the
contract evidenced by the letter of credit which is an absolute obligation
to pay, provided the documents are not discrepant. It is for the bank to
analyse the documents and to make the payment on the basis of the
documents. Therefore, for this reason alone, the plaintiff would not be
entitled to the injunction it seeks.

Apart from this, the plaintiff has admitted writing the letter

dated 11.01.2008 where it has unequivocally accepted all the
discrepancies in the documents and even requested the bank to pay
taking upon itself all losses and consequences and indemnifying the
bank. In view of the fact that the plaintiff has admitted writing such a
letter, I do not see how the plaintiff could have approached this Court for
an injunction against the bank from paying under the letter of credit. It is
also noteworthy that the plaintiff has not disclosed the full nature of the
transactions between the parties and in particular the fact that the
contract was subsequently amended for a lesser quantity of 200 Metric
Tonnes.

10.

All these circumstances lead me to the conclusion that the

plaintiff is not entitled to any injunction. Consequently, the order dated
31.03.2008 is vacated. This application is dismissed.
