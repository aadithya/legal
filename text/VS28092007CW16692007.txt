VIPIN SANGHI, J
The Petitioner's husband was working as Driver in Delhi
Fire Service. On 24.4.1998, a fire broke out in a factory in Okhla. The

Petitioner's husband was on duty at that site and while rendering his
services he died. In terms of OM No.45/55/97-P&P W(C) dated 11 th
September

1998,

the

Petitioner

demanded

ex-gratia

lumpsum

compensation of Rs.5 lakhs. Since this was denied by the Respondent,
the

Petitioner

preferred

Central

Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (the Tribunal). The
Tribunal

rejected

the

contention

of

the

Respondents

that

the

Petitioner's husband did not die while rendering his services and that
he died on account of a heart attack. Consequently, the Tribunal
allowed the OA filed by the Petitioner and diverted payment of the exgratia amount to the petitioner. Thereafter, the Petitioner filed MA
No.492/2006 & 493/2006 to claim interest on the amount of Rs.5 lakhs
released to her on 14.5.2004. The Tribunal dismissed the said MA vide
order dated 24.8.2006, which is now impugned before us. The Tribunal
held that since no interest had been granted and the order earlier
passed by the Tribunal was silent in this regard, the implication was
that the Tribunal has refused to grant any interest.
The only grievance raised before us by the Petitioner in this
petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is that she should
have been awarded interest by the Tribunal while allowing her OA.
We have heard counsel for the parties. As rightly held by
the Tribunal the Petitioner was entitled to ex-gratia payment in terms
of the aforesaid OM immediately on the demise of her husband on
24.4.1998. However, the same was denied by the Respondents, and
their reason for denying the said claim have rightly been rejected by
the Tribunal. This resulted in delay in payment of aforesaid amount of
Rs.5 lakhs to the Petitioner by over 6 years. For no fault of the
Petitioner who is a widow, she was not only driven to filing the
W.P. (C) No. 1669/2007

aforesaid OA to claim her legitimate dues but had to wait for over six
long years before receiving the amount due to her. Interest is nothing
but compensation for delayed payment of the dues, inter-alia, to off set
the erosion in the value of Rupee on account of inflation. There is also
the cost of lost opportunities.
In our view, therefore, the Tribunal ought to have awarded
interest on the amount of compensation due to the Petitioner since the
delay was entirely attributable to the Respondents. Consequently, we
allow the petition and award simple interest on the amount of Rs.5
lakhs from 14.5.1998 to 14.5.2004 i.e. For a period of six years @ 12%
per annum. The Respondents are directed to make the payments of
interest within four weeks.
With the aforesaid directions, the Writ Petition stands
disposed of.
