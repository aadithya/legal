KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
*
The appellant, New India Assurance Company Ltd.,
insurer

of the offending vehicle has preferred an appeal

challenging the impugned order dated 01.03.2006 passed by the

MAC. APP. No. 446/2006

Page 1 of 10

learned MACT. The impugned award has arisen out of the claim
petition filed by respondent Nos.1 to 4 against the appellant as
well as against respondent No.5 claiming compensation for the
death of Shri Alok Kumar. The brief facts which are necessary
for deciding the present appeal inter alia are that respondent
Nos.1 to 4 are the legal heirs of deceased Shri Alok Kumar who
had died on 30.8.2001 while driving his Santro Car which was
hit by the offending Tata Sumo driven by respondent No.5 rashly
and negligently. As a result of the said accident, the deceased
Alok Kumar received serious injuries due to which he ultimately
died. The Tribunal after taking into consideration the facts of the
case as well as evidence lead by the parties had passed an
award in the sum of Rs.77,18,000/-along with interest at the rate
of 7.5% per annum payable from the date of the institution of
the petition till the date of realisation. The said order passed by
the Tribunal is now under challenge in the present appeal.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at
considerable length. Counsel appearing for the respondent has
taken a preliminary objection to the very maintainability of the
MAC. APP. No. 446/2006

Page 2 of 10

present appeal on the ground that the appellant cannot assail
the findings of the Tribunal on the quantum of compensation as
determined by the Tribunal.

Counsel contends that the

appellant had not taken over the defence of the owner and
driver as envisaged under Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act
and, therefore, is debarred from challenging the impugned
award so as to assail the findings of the Tribunal on the quantum
of compensation.

Counsel for the respondent has placed

reliance on the following judgments of the Apex Court:1. (2002) 7 SCC 456, National Insurance Co. Vs. Nicollata
Rohtagi
2. (2003) 3 SCC 524, Sadhana Ladh Vs. National Insurance Co.
3. (2006) 3 SCC 242, Bijoy Kumar Dagar Vs. Bidya Dhar Dutta
4. (2006) 2 SCC 641, National Insurance Co. Vs. Mastan
5. (2001) 2 SCC 9, Kaushnuma Begum Vs. New India Assurance
6. AIR 1980 SC 1354, NKU Bros. Vs. M. Karumai

The contention of counsel for the respondent is that
right to file an appeal is a statutory right and the insurer can
assail the findings of the Tribunal under Section 149(2) of the
Motor Vehicles Act. Counsel further contends that it is only in a
case where there is collusion between the claimants and the
insured, the insurer can assail the findings of the Tribunal on the
grounds of quantum as well as negligence subject however to
the condition that the insurer had taken permission of the Court
to take over the defence of the owner or driver as the case may
be as envisaged under Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act. No
such permission was granted to the appellant under Section 170
of the Motor Vehicles Act by the Tribunal and, therefore, in the
MAC. APP. No. 446/2006

Page 4 of 10

absence of the same, the appellant being the insurer of the
offending vehicle cannot maintain the present appeal on
grounds other than those available to it under Section 149(2) of
the Motor Vehicles Act.
On

the

other

hand,

counsel

for

the

appellant

vehemently refutes this position and contends that the insurer
cannot be rendered remedlyless especially in a case where the
Tribunal has awarded an excessive amount of compensation in
favour of the claimants ignoring all basic principles of law for the
award of compensation. Counsel further contends that there is a
deemed permission in favour of the appellant as the appellant
did move an application before the Tribunal under Section 170 of
the Motor Vehicles Act but the Court did not pass any order
thereto and, therefore, it cannot be assumed that permission
under Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act was not granted by
the Tribunal. Counsel for the appellant has also placed reliance
on the judgment of the Supreme Court reported in 2007 (9)
Scale 216, New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs. Smt.
Shanti Pathak & Ors. to contend that the Apex Court had
MAC. APP. No. 446/2006

Page 5 of 10

interfered to lower down the compensation amount even in a
case where the insurer had not taken any permission from the
Court under Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Counsel for
the appellant also contends that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
already referred the said issue of lack of competence of the
insurer to assail the findings of the Tribunal on the ground of
quantum of compensation and negligence to a larger Bench and,
therefore, this Court may await the decision of the Supreme
Court in this regard.
After having given my thoughtful and conscious
consideration to the issue involved in the present case, I am of
the view that the issue is no more res integra as in catena of
judgments cited by the respondent, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has authoritatively held that in the absence of permission given
by the Court as envisaged under Section 170 of the Motor
Vehicles Act, the insurer has no right to file an appeal to
challenge the quantum of compensation or finding of the
Tribunal as regards the negligence or contributory negligence of
offending vehicles is concerned. It would be appropriate to refer
MAC. APP. No. 446/2006

Page 6 of 10

Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act as under:“170. Impleading insurer in certain casesWhere in the course of any inquiry the Claims
Tribunal is satisfied that (a) there is collusion between the person
making the claim and the person against
whom the claim is made, or
(b) the person against whom the claim is
made has failed to contest the claim,
It may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, direct
that the insurer who may be liable in respect of such
claim, shall be impleaded as a party to the
proceeding and the insurer so impleaded shall
thereupon have, without prejudice to the provisions
contained in sub-section (2) of section 149, the right
to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds that
are available to the person against whom the claim
has been made.“

It is an admitted case between the parties that no
such permission under Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act was
obtained by the appellant which clearly meant that the
circumstances as envisaged under Section 170 of the Motor
Vehicles Act were not in existence for the Court to grant such
permission. In the judgment of the Supreme Court reported in
(1998) 3 SCC 140, Shankarayya Vs. United India Insurance

MAC. APP. No. 446/2006

Page 7 of 10

Co. Ltd., the Supreme Court has held that the insurance
company when impleaded as a party by the Court can be
permitted to contest the proceedings on merits only if the
conditions mentioned in Section 170 are found to be satisfied
and for that purpose the insurance company has to obtain an
order in writing from the Tribunal and such an order should be a
reasoned order of the Tribunal. In such circumstances unless the
said procedure is followed, the appellant insurer cannot have a
wider defence on merits than what is available to it by way of a
statutory defence. Ralevant part of Para 4 of the said judgment
in this regard is referred as under:“4. It clearly shows that the Insurance
Company when impleaded as a party by the
Court can be permitted to contest the
proceedings on merits only if the conditions
precedent mentioned in the section are found
to be satisfied and for that purpose the
Insurance Company has to obtain order in
writing from the Tribunal and which should be
a reasoned order by the Tribunal. Unless that
procedure
is
followed,
the
Insurance
Company cannot have a wider defence on
merits than what is available to it by way of
statutory defence. “

MAC. APP. No. 446/2006

In view of the said legal position, I cannot appreciate
the argument of counsel for the appellant that there is a deemed
permission in favour of the appellant.

Once the application

under Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act was preferred by the
appellant before the Tribunal for taking over the defence of an
owner or driver, the Tribunal is required to pass specific order
and that too a reasoned order as per the observations of the
Supreme Court referred above and, therefore, the argument of
counsel for the appellant cannot be appreciated that filing of an
application under Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act by the
appellant in this regard was a sufficient compliance of a said
statutory requirement.
In the light of the above discussion, I do not find any
merit in the submission of counsel for the appellant.

The

judgment cited by the counsel in Shanti Pathak's case (supra)
has not dealt with the said legal proposition and, therefore, the
same is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the
present case.
