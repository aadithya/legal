1.

FIR No.497/07 dated 25.5.2007
under Section 498-A/406 IPC
PS Rohini.
Deepak Kumar, husband of the complainant Reena and

Shobha Rani, mother-in-law of Reena seek pre-arrest bail.
2.

As per the FIR Reena and Deepak were married on

26.1.2004 and that immediately after the marriage, the in-laws
were not happy with the dowry articles gifted to Reena by her
parents. There was a
vehicle.

demand

of

Rs.40,000/- and

a motor

That Reena's parents gave Rs.40,000/- but could not

finance the car.

That Reena was physically assaulted and

confined to a room without food. That on 31.7.2005 Reena had to

leave her matrimonial home leaving behind everything with her
in-laws.

That her jewellery and other items were not being

returned.
3.

As per the petitioners, Reena left the matrimonial

house due to temperamental differences and while so doing she
took along with her all wearing apparels and her jewellery. It is
further stated by the petitioners that the husband had sought
restitution of conjugal rights by filing an application under Section
9 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955.
4.

It is stated by the petitioners that the learned

Additional District Judge at Meerut before whom application under
Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 filed by Deepak was
listed had referred the parties for mediation and on 2.12.2006
Reena had appeared before the mediator.

That mediation

proceedings were being held when the FIR in question was got
registered surreptitiously. Thus, it is urged that the intention of
the complainant is no more other than to harass her in-laws.
5.

It was further pointed out by learned counsel for the

petitioners that the falsity of the allegations in the FIR can be felt
on the face of the FIR which implicates the brother-in-law and
sister-in-law of first petitioner who did not even reside in the same
house.
6.

I note that no issue has been born to the parties.

7.

The rival versions of the parties would obviously

require evidence. The evidence would be the oral testimonies of
the parties. For collecting this evidence, police does not have any
role to play. Thus, no custodial interrogation would be required.
8.

Pertaining to the dowry articles, it would be relevant to

note that on 29.6.2007 various dowry articles which were left in
her matrimonial house by the complainant when she withdrew
from the consortium were handed over to the complainant as per
memo dated 29.6.2007.

Further,

counsel wants a clarification: that this amount would be adjusted
from any amount which may become payable pursuant to any
judicial order passed.
12.

Under the circumstances I dispose of the petition

directing that on petitioners cooperating with the investigating
officer and subject to petitioner No.1 paying to the complainant
Rs.3,000/- per month by the 10th day of each calender month,
payment being tendered by means of a cheque commencing from
the current month of October 2007, in the event the petitioners
are being arrested by the investigating officer, the petitioners
would be released on bail by the investigating officer on their
furnishing a personal bond in sum of Rs.10,000/- each with one
surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
investigating officer in the afore-noted FIR.
13.

Needless to state, Rs.3,000/- which would be paid by

the first petitioner to the complainant pursuant to the present
order would be adjusted and would be subject

to

any

orders

which may be obtained by the complainant from any Court
pertaining to maintenance.
