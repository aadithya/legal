KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:

Yes

By way of this appeal, the appellants have assailed the findings of
FAO No. 416/2002

page 1 of 9

the Tribunal mainly on the ground that the Tribunal has wrongly
deducted

1/3rd towards personal expenses of the deceased although

the deceased who was aged 36 years had at the time of accident left
behind his widow and four minor children i.e., two daughters and two
sons. Counsel for the appellants contends that future prospects of the
deceased

even as per the minimum wages were not taken into

consideration.
multiplier

The counsel for the appellants contends that correct

as per the Second Schedule

years between the age group of 35

was not applied which is 16

to 40 years.

Counsel for the

appellants contends that the deceased was of 36 years and therefore
multiplier of 16 as laid down in the Second Schedule should have been
applied by the Tribunal. The appellants are also aggrieved with the
grant of less amount of compensation towards consortium which as per
the appellants should

not have been below Rs.50,000/-.

Mr.

O.P.Mannie, counsel appearing for the appellants has contended that a
very meager amount of Rs.76,000/- has been awarded in favour of the
appellants although the deceased was the only bread earner of the
family who died at the young age of only 36 years. Counsel further
contends that the deceased was supporting a large family comprising of

FAO No. 416/2002

page 2 of 9

wife with four minor children and therefore he must be spending more
amount towards their maintenance and education and not on himself.
Counsel for the appellant contended that the Tribunal has wrongly
deducted 1/3rd of the income towards his personal expenses.
Counsel for the appellant also contends that under Section 163-A
of the Motor Vehicles Act, the special provision dealing with the grant
of compensation has not been dealt with by the Tribunal and on the
basis of structured formula a minimum compensation payable for a
victim of the accident up to the age of 15 years even though he may be
a non-earning person would alone come out at Rs.1,50,000/-. Counsel
for the appellants has drawn my attention to the Second Schedule of
the Motor Vehicles Act, wherein under Clause '6' notional income for a
non-earning person has been specified at Rs.15,000/-, multiplier of 15
has been laid down for a person up to 15 years and 1/3rd of the income
is deducted towards the personal expenses and accordingly, therefore,
the total amount of compensation for a person up to the age of 15 years
would come to

at Rs.1,50,000/- by applying the multiplier of 15.

Placing reliance on the said Schedule, counsel for the appellants
contends that insufficient amount towards compensation has been

FAO No. 416/2002

page 3 of 9

awarded in favour of the appellants. Counsel also contends that a
meager amount of Rs.15,000/- has been awarded towards non
pecuniary damages. The contention of the counsel for the appellants is
that the Supreme Court in catena of cases has granted minimum
compensation of Rs.50,000/- towards consortium.

Mr. Mannie,

counsel for the appellants also contends that the appellants have been
illegally deprived of the interest on the award amount w.e.f. 15.10.87 till
23.11.95 on the ground that there was delay on the part of the appellants
in prosecuting their compensation case.
Per contra, Mr. Tyagi, counsel for the respondent contends that
the matter pertains to an accident which had occurred in the year 1986
and therefore, the criteria as laid down in Section 163-A cannot be
taken into consideration for determining the compensation in favour of
the appellants. Counsel for the respondent further contends that

in

such cases the Supreme Court has applied the multiplier of 13 years.
Mr. Tyagi has placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Managing Director, Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation
Ltd. Vs. I.I.Bindu and Ors. 2006 ACJ 423. The contention of the
counsel for the respondent is that in the said case the deceased was

FAO No. 416/2002

page 4 of 9

employed as a UDC in Civil Supplies Corporation and died at the age of
34 years. In that case the Supreme Court applied the multiplier of 13
years instead of 17 years as awarded by the Tribunal and even future
prospects

were not taken into consideration in the said judgment.

Counsel for the respondent also contends that as far as denial of interest
from 15.10.87 till 23.11.95 is concerned, no illegality can be found with
the findings of the Tribunals as such interest

was not granted on

account of the fact that the appellants had not impleaded the insurer
till 23.11.95.
I have heard the counsel for the parties at great length.
It is an admitted case between the parties that the deceased was
taken in the category of unskilled labourer and the minimum wages as
applicable on that date under the Minimum Wages Act were taken into
consideration i.e.,

Rs.414/- as applicable on the date of the accident

i.e., 29.7.86. It is also not in dispute that the deceased had left behind
his widow and four minor children. It is also not
deceased

disputed that the

at the time of his death was only 36 years of age.

Tribunal has

taken into consideration

The

the multiplier of 15 years

although the same is 16 years as per the Second Schedule, but in a

FAO No. 416/2002

page 5 of 9

number of judgments, the Supreme Court has taken the view that the
multiplier as laid down in the Second Schedule cannot be accepted as
a ready reckoner, and therefore, in a number of cases the Supreme
Court has not taken into consideration the multiplier as laid down in the
Second Schedule. It is no doubt that in the judgment relied upon by
the counsel for the respondent the multiplier of 13 years was taken into
consideration in the case where the death of a young man of 34 years
had occurred. In that case the deceased had left behind his widow, two
children and a mother. In the present case the accident had occurred in
the year 1986 when the Second Schedule was not on the Statute of
Motor Vehicles Act and even the law in this regard has taken a shape at
a later stage as regards the application of multiplier and for considering
the various other factors.
While distinguishing the case of (1994) 2 SCC 176: 1994 SCC (Cri)
335, G.M., Kerala SRTC v. Susamma Thomas, in U.P. State Road
Transport Corpn. v. Trilok Chandra, (1996) 4 SCC 362 the
Hon’ble Apex Court has held that the Second Schedule cannot be
blindly followed. The relevant portion of the said judgment is
reproduced below:

FAO No. 416/2002

page 6 of 9

“17. The situation has now undergone a
change with the enactment of the Motor Vehicles Act,
1988, as amended by Amendment Act 54 of 1994.
The most important change introduced by the
amendment insofar as it relates to determination of
compensation is the insertion of Sections 163-A and
163-B in Chapter XI entitled “Insurance of Motor
Vehicles against Third Party Risks”. Section 165-A
begins with a non obstante clause and provides for
payment of compensation, as indicated in the Second
Schedule, to the legal representatives of the
deceased or injured, as the case may be. Now if we
turn to the Second Schedule, we find a table fixing
the mode of calculation of compensation for third
party accident injury claims arising out of fatal
accidents. The first column gives the age group of the
victims of accident, the second column indicates the
multiplier and the subsequent horizontal figures
indicate the quantum of compensation in thousand
payable to the heirs of the deceased victim.
According to this table the multiplier varies from 5 to
18 depending on the age group to which the victim
belonged. Thus, under this Schedule the maximum
multiplier can be up to 18 and not 16 as was held in
Susamma Thomas case .
18……
To put it briefly, the table abounds in such mistakes.
Neither the tribunals nor the courts can go by the
ready reckoner. It can only be used as a guide.”

In the present case the deceased was survived by his four minor
children as well as widow, therefore, I do not find any infirmity in the
order of the Tribunal so far as the multiplier of 15 is concerned.
The Tribunal had taken into consideration the income of the
FAO No. 416/2002

page 7 of 9

deceased at Rs.500/- after taking into consideration the income of the
unskilled labourer at Rs.414/- as specified in Minimum Wages Act at
the relevant period and after granting some amount towards future
prospects the same was enhanced from Rs.414/- to Rs.500/- and after
deducting 1/3rd income towards personal expenses, multiplicand of
Rs.340/- was taken as the income of the deceased.
I do not find any infirmity in the order of the Tribunal so far as
the same is concerned with the applicability of the Minimum Wages
Act, as the appellants failed to produce any evidence to support

the

income of Rs. 5,000/-. However, I do not find any justification for
granting a very meager enhancement in the said income from Rs.414/to Rs.500/- as per the Minimum Wages Act. The deceased would have
earned at least a sum of Rs.2579/- after a period of 15 years which
period was taken into consideration by the Tribunal towards the total
period of dependence of the family. Considering this aspect, I feel that
mean of Rs.414/- and Rs.2579/- can be taken into consideration so as
to arrive at the correct income of the deceased including his future
prospects and the same would be fair and just compensation to be
awarded in favour of the appellants. As regards the deduction of 1/3

FAO No. 416/2002

page 8 of 9

towards personal expenses

is concerned, since the deceased

was

survived by four minor children and widow, I am of the view that ends
of justice can be met by deducting 1/4th of the income towards his
personal expenses instead of 1/3rd.

I also find that a very meager

amount of Rs.15,000/- has been awarded towards

non-pecuniary

damages, therefore, the same is also directed to be enhanced to
Rs.40,000/-. As regards the rate of interest, I do not find any infirmity
in the order of the Tribunal.
The matter is remanded back to the Tribunal for carrying out
recalculation of the compensation amount and modification of

the

award in the light of the above directions.
The parties are directed to appear before the Tribunal on
5.11.2007.
