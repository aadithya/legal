Mr. Amarnath Mehta owned an immovable property

bearing plot No. 2646, Block-F, Palam Vihar, Gurgaon and he
bequeathed the said plot in his will dated 21.11.1995 in favour
of his grand son being the petitioner herein.
The notice of this petition was sent to all the respondents.
The notice of the petition was also sent to the concerned
Revenue Authorities calling for the valuation report in respect
of the estate of the deceased. A citation of the petition was got
published in the 'Statesman' on 14.06.2005. None of the six
sons of the deceased testator has filed any objection to the
grant of probate of the will propounded by the petitioner in this
petition.
The petitioner has filed his evidence by way of affidavits.
Two affidavits have been filed in evidence and they are of the
petitioner himself who has sworn as AW-1 and the other
affidavit is of the attesting witness of the will Mr. Parag Mehta
who has sworn as AW-2.
I have heard the arguments of Mr. Shekhar, learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner and have also
gone through the contents of the entire petition. The death

certificate of the deceased testator is Ex. AW-1/3 and the will
dated 21.11.1995 propounded by the petitioner is Ex. AW-1/1.
Mr. Parag Mehta who is the attesting witness of the will in
question has testified in his affidavit that the Will Ex. AW-1/1
was executed by the deceased testator Mr. Amarnath Mehta in
his presence and also in presence of the other attesting witness
of the Will Mr. S.K. Mehta. Mr. Parag Mehta has also testified in
his affidavit that the deceased testator was possessed of sound
disposing mind at the time he had executed his Will in
question. To the same effect is the testimony of the petitioner
on record. Since none of the children of the deceased testator
has come forward to contest the present petition, there is no
reason for this Court to doubt the testimony of the witnesses on
record. In the opinion of this Court, the petitioner has proved
that the Will dated 21.11.1995 of his grand father propounded
by him in this petition is the last and genuine Will of the
deceased testator. Accordingly, the petitioner is held entitled to
grant of letter of administration with a copy of Will Ex. AW-1/1
annexed thereto which would entitle him to administer the
estate left by the deceased as per law. Since the petitioner is

the grand son and the sole beneficiary of the Will of the
deceased, he is exempted from filing the surety bonds.
In view of the above and having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case, it is directed that a letter of
administration with a copy of Will Ex. AW-1/1 annexed thereto
be issued in favour of the petitioner on his furnishing requisite
court fee and an administration bond for due administration of
the estate of the deceased as per his wishes contained in the
Will Ex. AW-1/1. The original will of the deceased be kept in the
safe custody.
This petition stands disposed of.
