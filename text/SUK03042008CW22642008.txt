1.

The petitioner's case is that consequent upon a summons

issued to the petitioner under Section 14-B of the Employees
Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 on
9.3.2006, the impugned order dated 14.2.2008 has come to be
passed whereby the petitioner has been directed to pay a sum
of Rs.15,36,791/- towards damages under Section 14-B and
interest under Section 7-Q of the said Act, in relation to nonpayment of contribution regarding certain workers found to
have been working with the petitioner by the officers of the

department who visited the premises of the petitioner on
24.9.2004, 27.09.2004 and 28.09.2004. Consequent upon said
visits, an inspection note dated 28.9.2004 was handed over to
the petitioner stating that an amount of Rs.9,38,372/- was due
from the petitioner. By that note, the petitioner was also advised
to deposit these dues. It appears that consequent upon this
communication, the petitioner deposited the said amount of
Rs.9,38,372/- the very next day, i.e., on 29.9.2004 in cash in the
State Bank of India, Parliament Street, New Delhi. On 30.9.2004,
whilst informing the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner of
this fact through a letter, the petitioner also pointed out that the
amounts demanded by the aforesaid inspection note dated
28.9.2004 did not belong to their employees. In addition, the
petitioner has also stated as follows :“The workers deputed by the said agencies
have never been our employees and no
'Master-Servant' relationship ever existed
between their workers and ourselves.
However, to avoid all problems and
controversies and without prejudice to our
rights and contentions and without
admission of any liability or default on the
Contract Agencies, in the PF...........”
It is, therefore, obvious that the damages in question had
been deposited by the petitioner without prejudice to their
rights and contentions and without admission of any liability for
default on its part and with a view to avoiding all problems and
controversies in future. A specific stand was also taken to the
effect that the amounts demanded by the inspection note dated
28.9.2004 do not belong to the petitioner's employees.

Counsel for the petitioner contends that such a deposit

amounts to a deposit under protest and it was incumbent upon
the respondents to hold the requisite inquiry under Section 7-A
of the Employees Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions
Act, 1952 before imposing any liability on the petitioner.
3.

On the last date of hearing, Mr. Chawla appeared for

respondents No.1 and 2 and sought an opportunity to file a
short affidavit in response to the show cause notice and also to
take instructions in the matter. The fact that the requisite
enquiry under Section 7-A of the Employees Provident Fund &
Miscellaneous Provisions Act was never held is not disputed.
4.

Under the circumstances, the impugned order dated

14.2.2008 is quashed with a direction to the respondent to
reconsider the matter afresh by holding the necessary enquiry
Under Section 7-A of Employees Provident Fund & Miscellaneous
Provisions Act, 1952 and to decide liability of the petitioner, if
any, in accordance with law, preferably within two months from
today.
5.

Writ Petition is disposed of.

CM No.4357/2008
6.

In view of the fact that the writ petition itself has been

disposed of, this application is rendered infructuous and is
disposed of as such.
