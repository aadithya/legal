1.

The petitioner, a prematurely retired employee of respondent

No.1 has sought the benefit granted to the employees under the exgratia scheme of 2001 and ex-gratia scheme, 2003 also known as
“Agrani Samman” and for quashing of letters dated 29th June, 2005,
4th May, 2005 and 10th June, 2005 and clarificatory circular dated
26th March, 2002 clarifying that benefit of ex-gratia is not to be given
in cases of premature retirement even if all the requisite eligibility

conditions are otherwise fulfilled by the pre 15th October, 1959
employee.

2.

Brief relevant facts for adjudication of this petition under Article

226 of the Constitution of India are that petitioner joined the services
of respondent No.1 as Junior Surveyor on 25th September, 1957 and
was subsequently promoted from time to time.

3.

Earlier respondent No.1 was a Directorate under the Ministry of

NRSR and later on it functioned under the Ministry of Steel and Mines
and Fuel. Respondent No.1 became a statutory body under ONGC Act
43 of 1959 and it functioned as a statutory body till 1993 when it was
transformed into a public limited company functioning under the
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and owned by Government of
India. In the circumstances it was contended that ONGC since its
inception has been and continues to be an instrumentality and
agency of Central Government and as such as “State” within the
meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. According to the
petitioner before transfer to ONGC, the petitioner was holding a
pensionary post under the Government of India.

The petitioner was promoted from time to time and became

Director.

Petitioner

became

medically

unfit

with

no

opportunity of gainfully employed in the alternative situation. The
petitioner, therefore, was given premature retirement in recognition of
his good services in the post. The terms and conditions of premature
retirement were communicated to the petitioner by notice reference
No.NZR/EBG/(P&A)/8(29)(Part File)/88/9224 dated 4th August, 1998
which are as under:“1. He will be entitled to a lump-sum one time benefit at
70% of the salary which he would be getting immediately
preceding the date of his retirement. Salary for the
purpose will be pay + Dearness Allowance, the terms pay
being inclusive of pay, personal pay, or any other
emoluments which may be specially classified as pay by
the Commission, to any benefit of payments under work
man Compensation Act, will be reduced by the amount of
pay/payable from premature retirement benefit.
2. He will be entitled to all benefit that he would have
otherwise enjoyed at the time of superannuation and in
accordance with the rules and regulations regulating
payments thereof.
3.
Benefit
entitled
to
him
under
statutory
provision/acts/laws on the date of pre-mature retirement
shall not be abridged save adjustment stated in Para (1)
above.
4. He will not be eligible for re-employment in the
Commission.”
5.

Since

the

petitioner

would

have

attained

the

age

of

superannuation with effect from 31st July, 1997, therefore, he was

WP(C) 14189 of 2005

Page 3 of 17

extended the benefit of premature retirement with effect from the
afternoon of 3rd November, 1988 till 31st July, 1997.

6.

According to the petitioner, respondent No.1 formulated ex-

gratia scheme 2001 for pre 15th October, 1959 employees. The said
scheme was applicable to those employees who had joined ONGC
prior to 15th October, 1959 and who had superannuated from the
service of ONGC after rendering service of minimum 20 years. Under
the scheme an amount of Rs.1,000/- per month from 1st November,
1997 together with dearness allowance at the rate admissible by
ONGC from time to time was payable as ex-gratia.

7.

Petitioner contended that he is an ex-employee who had joined

ONGC prior to 15th October, 1959 and he rendered a continuous
minimum service of 20 years without break on or before his
superannuation

(premature

retirement)

and

he

was

not

dismissed/removed/terminated or had not resigned from the service
of ONGC, therefore, he is entitled for ex-gratia payment admissible at
the rate of Rs.1000/- per month together with dearness allowance
with effect from 1st November, 1997.

The scheme for grant of ex-gratia to pre 15th October, 1959

employees was stipulated in the notice reference No.103(92)/00-EP
dated 20th November, 2001. As certain queries/issues had been raised
by different offices/work centers regarding grant of ex-gratia to pre
15th October, 1959 employees/spouses of pre 15th October, 1959
employees, therefore, a clarificatory notice was issued bearing
No.103(92)/00-EP dated 26th March, 2002. The said clarificatory
circular/notice also dealt with the cases of those employees who had
taken

premature

retirement

but

who

fulfilled

other

requisite

conditions for grant of ex-gratia scheme. The relevant Clause 2.12 of
the clarificatory order is as under:S.No.

ISSUE
Whether
a
pre
15.10.1959 employee
who has separated
from the service of
ONGC on account of
pre-mature retirement
but
fulfills
the
requisite conditions of
ex-gratia scheme is
eligible to the benefit
of ex-gratia.

The benefit of exgratia cannot be given
in
pre-mature
retirement cases even
if all the requisite
eligibility conditions of
ex-gratia
are
otherwise fulfilled by
the pre 15.10.1959
employee.

The respondent No.1 thereafter revised the scheme of ex-gratia

for pre 15th October, 1959 employees and another scheme for post
14th

October,

1959

employees

was

issued

by

a

circular

Page 5 of 17

No.103(92)/02-EP dated 7th January, 2003. Under the said scheme
the petitioner claimed that he was entitled for an ex-gratia amount of
Rs.3000/- plus dearness allowance admissible from time to time as
he was E0-E3 level of employee. Under the revised scheme which is
also known as “Agrani Samman”, those employees who had joined
ONGC,

prior

to

15th

October,

and

superannuated/voluntarily retired from the service of ONGC or died
after rendering a minimum of 10 years service before such a
separation were eligible. It was also stipulated that eligible exemployee would continue to get “Agrani Samman” so long as such an
employee will be alive after 1st January, 2003. Clause 3.9 of the said
Agrani Samman scheme, however, categorically and specifically
stipulated that all those ex-employees who separated from the service
of ONGC on account of premature retirement shall not be eligible for
ex-gratia under this scheme. The relevant Clause 3.9 of “Agrani
Samman” Scheme dated 7th January, 2003 is as under:“3.9. All those ex-employees who separated from the
service of ONGC on account of premature retirement shall
not be eligible for ex-gratia under this scheme.”

10.

The petitioner's plea is that since he is eligible under both the

schemes

representations.

payment

he

various

After making representations dated 10th March,

Page 6 of 17

2005 and 16th May, 2005 he received a letter dated 10th June, 2005
intimating him that his request for grant of ex-gratia payment under
the scheme has been rejected. Petitioner also received another letter
dated 29th June, 2005 along with a letter dated 4th May, 2005
reiterating the rejection of grant of ex-gratia payment under the
schemes to the petitioner.

11.

On rejection of petitioner's representation for grant of ex-gratia

payment under the schemes, the present petition was filed on 30th
August, 2005 contending that keeping in view the financial deplorable
conditions of pre 15th October, 1959 employees all the contributions
made by them during the formative years of respondent No.1 the exgratia schemes of 2001 and 2003 were promulgated to provide
monetary relief to those pre 15th October, 1959 employees who had
retired prior to PRBS was formulated. The petitioner also relied on the
fact that on the representation of many employees who had not been
granted ex-gratia under the schemes, respondent No.1 by letter dated
12th April, 2004 had constituted one man commission of Sh.
T.N.Sheshan to examine the issue of grant of option for Government
pensionary benefits to pre 15th October, 1959 employees in totality.
The one man commission was also requested later on to consider the
cases of those employees who joined post 15th October, 1959 while it

WP(C) 14189 of 2005

Page 7 of 17

was statutory body and who were not entitled to Central Government
pension, whether can also be considered and to give recommendation
given in respect thereof. One man commission gave his report and
recommendations that ex-gratia scheme be extended to post 15th
October, 1959 employees who retired prior to 1st June, 1990 or 1st
April, 1991.

12.

The respondents have contested the petition contending inter-

alia that the scheme “Agrani Samman” ex-gratia benefit scheme had
been introduced to provide for and in the beneficial interest of the
employees by providing them with monetary relief with the stipulation
that the employees who have rendered minimum 10 years service in
ONGC and subject to their fulfilling other requisite eligibility
conditions of the scheme and for those who had joined the service
prior to 15th October, 1959. The learned counsel for the respondent
emphasized that the scheme was purely on compassionate ground
and not due to any right or entitlement and it was entirely in the
nature of ex-gratia. Regarding the case of the petitioner, it was
contended that his case was considered with the cases of other
employees who had been prematurely retired and it was held and
decided that the scheme for grant of ex-gratia was not applicable to
those employees who were prematurely retired on medical grounds. It

WP(C) 14189 of 2005

Page 8 of 17

was so decided because on their premature retirement they had been
granted one time lump sum benefit of paying a percentage of their
salary for the notional left over service up to their normal age of
superannuation. Reliance for this was placed on letter dated 26th
March, 2002 categorically stipulating that the benefit of ex-gratia
cannot be given to the employees who had been prematurely retired
on medical grounds even if all other requisite eligibility conditions of
ex-gratia scheme were fulfilled by such persons who were employed
prior to 15th October, 1959.

13.

The

learned

counsel

for

the

respondents,

Mr.Oberoi

categorically contended that premature retirement where 70% of the
total amount payable for the left over service is paid in lump sum is
different from the cases of the employees who had retired or who had
taken voluntary retirement. The reliance was also placed on the
recommendation of one man Committee appointed by the respondents
who suggested that those ex-employees who had rendered 10 to 20
years of service may also be paid ex-gratia on pro-rata basis but those
employees who had rendered less than 10 years of service in ONGC
would not be eligible for grant of ex-gratia. It was pleaded that the one
man Committee did not recommend the cases of those employees who
had prematurely retired on medical grounds for grant of ex-gratia.

WP(C) 14189 of 2005

14.

The learned counsel for the respondents, Mr.Oberoi also relied

on Chairman, UP Jal Nigam & Anr Vs. Jaswant Singh & Anr, JT
2006(10) SC 500; Ceat Ltd Vs. Anand Abasaheb Hawaldar & Ors,
2006(2) Scale 352 and Union Bank of India Vs. Venkatesh Gopal
Mahishi & Anr, JT 2007(2) SCC 359 to contend that the petitioner
had been prematurely retired on medical grounds and he was paid a
lump sum amount of 70% of his salary for the remaining period of his
employment and such employees after taking such premature
retirement were not entitled to avail other schemes which were to
grant ex-gratia to other employees who had done long years of service.

15.

This is not disputed that the petitioner has not challenged the

schemes which is apparent from the prayers made by the petitioner in
the writ petition seeking a declaration that he is entitled to the benefit
of ex-gratia under the ex-gratia scheme, 2001 and “Agrani Samman”
Ex-gratia Scheme, 2003. The petitioner has rather challenged the
letters dated 29th June, 2005, 4th May, 2005 and 10th June, 2006 on
the premise that he is also entitled for ex-gratia amount under the
schemes which has been denied to him illegally. The petitioner has
also challenged the clarificatory circular dated 26th March, 2002
whereby it was categorically held in Clause 2.12 that the benefit of ex-

WP(C) 14189 of 2005

Page 10 of 17

gratia cannot be given in premature retirement cases even if all the
requisite eligibility conditions of ex-gratia are otherwise fulfilled by the
pre 15th October, 1959 employees.

16.

This is not disputed that the petitioner was retired prematurely

on 3rd November, 1988 on account of his permanent disability. While
permanently retiring the petitioner he had been granted 70% of his
total emoluments had he continued in the service till the age of
superannuation on 31st July, 1997. 70% of the salary which was given
to the petitioner at the time of premature retirement also included
dearness allowances and all such pays which were specially classified
as pay by the Commission. It was categorically stipulated at the time
of his premature retirement that he would be entitled to all the
benefits that he would have otherwise been eligible at the time of
superannuation in accordance with the rules and regulations thereof.

17.

This is not disputed by the petitioner that the premature

retirement is not the same as voluntary retirement or the retirement.
An employee who is prematurely retired is given a percentage of his
pay till the date of his superannuation which is not the case in case of
an employee who seeks voluntary retirement or an employee who
retires after reaching the age of superannuation. In the circumstances

WP(C) 14189 of 2005

Page 11 of 17

if the benefits of ex-gratia schemes of 2001 and 2003 have not been
granted to those employees who have prematurely retired on medical
grounds, it cannot be inferred that there is discrimination with them
as they are a class in itself who are granted a lump sum amount
without doing any work for the remaining period of their service as
they are not in position to work on account of their medical disability.

18.

The case of the petitioner is not that the prematurely retired

employees cannot be distinguished but that prematurely retired
employees are also included in the ex-gratia schemes. Regarding the
scheme of the respondent for grant of ex-gratia to pre 15 th October,
1959 employees dated 20th November, 2001 a clarification dated 26th
March, 2002 was issued which in clause 2.12 categorically stipulated
that after consideration it has been decided that the benefit of exgratia cannot be given to prematurely retired cases even if all other
requisites and eligibility conditions are otherwise fulfilled by pre 15th
October, 1959 employees.

19.

The scheme of 7th January, 2003, ‘Agrani Samman’ categorically

stipulated in the scheme itself in para 3.9 that all those ex-employees
who separated from the service of ONGC on account of premature
retirement shall not be eligible for ex-gratia under the scheme. When

WP(C) 14189 of 2005

Page 12 of 17

the petitioner was prematurely retired on 3rd November, 1988 granting
him 70% of his pay for the period 3rd November, 1988 up to 31st July,
1997, the date on which he had superannuated which included
dearness allowance and any emoluments classified as pay and if the
petitioner was not satisfied with the amount given to him while
prematurely retiring him, as his allegation is that permanent
disability was sustained by him arising out of and during the course
of his employment, he should have challenged the same. The
petitioner opted to avail the benefit of getting the 70% pay for almost
about eight years in lump sum and have enjoyed the benefit of the
lump sum money which was granted to him, later on if the ex-gratia
schemes have been formulated to grant ex-gratia to other employees
excluding the employees who had been prematurely retired on
medical grounds, the class of such prematurely retired employees can
not insist that they ought to have been also granted ex-gratia
payments under different schemes.

20.

In Chairman, U.P Jal Nigam (Supra) the Supreme Court had

held that those employees who acquiesced in accepting the retirement
and did not challenge the same in time, the Court should be slow in
granting relief to such employees. It was also held that while granting
the relief to such employees the prejudice which may be caused to

WP(C) 14189 of 2005

Page 13 of 17

other parties is also to be considered. In this case some of the
employees of the U.P Jal Nigam had challenged their superannuation
on attaining the age of 58 years contending that they are to be allowed
to continue up to the age of 60 years. In one of the case the Supreme
Court had allowed the employees to continue up to 60 years and on
the basis of such decision, the employees who had retired long back
also filed writ petitions seeking advantage of the said decision. The
Apex Court had held that those employees who had not challenged
their retirement will not be entitled for the relief in the light of
subsequent decision of the Supreme Court and the benefit was
confined only to those persons who had filed their writ petitions
before their retirement or had obtained interim orders before their
retirement. The petitioner in the present case has been prematurely
retired in 1988 under a scheme and 70% of his pay for the remaining
period of his service without taking any type of work from him was
given to him. If the petitioner was aggrieved by it on the ground that
the alleged medical disability on account of which he

had been

prematurely retired was on account of his work with the respondent
and he his entitled for more than what had been given to him, he
should have challenged the same. After accepting the said scheme, he
cannot be allowed to contend that he is entitled for ex-gratia
payments under other schemes meant for other types of employees.

WP(C) 14189 of 2005

21.

In Ceat Ltd (Supra), the company had promulgated a voluntary

retirement scheme for its employees which was accepted by some of
the

employees.

Thereafter

the

company

entered

into

another

agreement with the employees union containing other voluntary
retirement scheme which was accepted by different employees.
Subsequent scheme offered a different package. One of the benefits
which was given to the employees

who had accepted voluntary

retirement Scheme II, was payment of a sum of Rs.90,000/- ex-gratia
which was not extended to the employees who had accepted VRS I.
This led to the litigation by the employees who had accepted first
voluntary retirement scheme alleging discrimination and favoritism
and that the company had committed unfair labor practices. The Apex
Court

had

held

that

in

such

circumstances

there

was

no

discrimination, favoritism or partiality as those who are covered under
voluntary retirement scheme II stood on a different footing from those
who accepted voluntary retirement scheme I and, therefore, the
grievance of those who had accepted voluntary retirement scheme I is
not tenable. In the present case the petitioner had availed the scheme
of premature retirement whereby he was prematurely retired on
medical grounds and a substantial lump sum amount, 70% of the pay
with dearness allowance till the date of his superannuation was paid

WP(C) 14189 of 2005

Page 15 of 17

to him without any work being taken from him. The petitioner cannot
equate himself in the facts and circumstances with those employees
who have worked till the age of their superannuation or those
employees who had taken voluntary retirement as they were not
granted any ex-gratia till the age of their superannuation.

22.

The Learned counsel for the respondents have also challenged

the right of the petitioner to claim any benefit under the schemes of
2001 and 2003 on account of delay. Perusal of the counter affidavit
shows that no such ground has been taken on behalf of the
respondents. The representations of the petitioner claiming ex-gratia
amounts under the schemes of 2001 and 2003 was declined by
communications dated 4.5.2005; 16.6.2005 and 29.6.2005. The writ
petition was filed by the petitioner on 30th August, 2005. In the
circumstances there is no such delay on the part of the petitioner
which would disentitle him for the relief on the ground of delay, had
he entitled for the relief. This has already been held that the petitioner
is not entitled for any ex-gratia payment under the schemes of 2001
and 2003.

WP(C) 14189 of 2005

Page 16 of 17

23.

In the totality of the facts and circumstance, the petitioner is

not entitled for any of the relief claimed in the writ petition. The writ
petition is therefore, dismissed. Parties are however, left to bear their
own costs.
