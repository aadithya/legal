V.B.Gupta, J.
Present appeal has been filed under Section 260A of
the Income Tax Act, 1961( for short as „Act‟) against the

ITA No.184/2007

Page 1 of 8

order dated 1st May, 2007 passed by Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal, Delhi Bench „G‟ (for short as „Tribunal‟) in ITA
Nos.3649 & 3317/Del/05 relevant for the assessment year
2001-02.
2.

The brief facts leading to dispute are that the

Assessee is a Charitable Trust registered under Section
12A(1) of the Act.

It is running a hospital called Jaipur

Golden Hospital at 2-Institutional Area, Rohini, New Delhi.
It filed its income tax return for the assessment year 200001 declaring „Nil‟ income.

In the course of assessment

proceedings, it was noticed by the Assessing Officer that
Assessee had received donations from 61 consulting
doctors who had opted to give donations of Rs.10,000/each under the terms and conditions.

According to the

terms and conditions, the Assessee was entitled to deduct
20% of the consulting charges and the balance amount to
be paid to the consulting doctors. It further provided that
if the consulting doctors paid donations of Rs. 10,000/- then
they would be entitled to 85% of the consulting charges
instead of 80%.

3.

The Assessing Officer was of the view that donations

received were not as per provisions of Sections 11 & 12 of
the Act and are forced contribution as per agreement
executed between doctors and the Hospital authorities.
Therefore,

he

treated

the

impugned

donations

of

Rs.6,10,000/- as “Income from Other Sources”, applying
the provisions of Section 56 to 59 of the Act.
4.

Aggrieved with the order of the Assessing Officer, the

Assessee filed appeal before Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals) [for short as CIT(A)] who confirmed the order
passed by the Assessing Officer, holding that the donations
were not voluntary but are under a contractual scheme
formulated by the Assessee and, therefore, the said cannot
be treated as income derived from property held under
trust. Accordingly, he denied benefit of Section 11 of the
Act to the Assessee and dismissed the appeal.
5.

Thereafter the Assessee filed an appeal before the

Tribunal and vide impugned order, the Tribunal deleted the
addition of Rs.6,10,000/- made by the Assessing Officer
being contribution received by the Assessee from the

ITA No.184/2007

Page 3 of 8

doctors towards corpus of the fund holding that the said
amount could not be treated as income of the Assessee. It
was optional for the consulting doctors to contribute
donation of Rs. 10,000/- and the said donations were not
forced donations.
6.

Thus, the question arises as to whether on the facts

and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was
correct in law in holding that the donation of Rs.6,10,000/received by the Assessee from doctors towards corpus
holding are voluntary in nature in view of the provisions
laid down in Sections 11 & 12 of the Act.
7.

It is contended by the learned counsel for the

Revenue that donations were not given by the doctors out
of their own free will but were given under a contract. The
mere fact that out of 141 doctors, 61 doctors had opted for
such scheme, did not convert the forced contribution into
voluntary contribution so as to claim exemption under
Section 11 of the Act.
8.

Section 2(24)(iia) of the Act states that any voluntary

donation received by a trust, whether the donation is

ITA No.184/2007

Page 4 of 8

towards corpus or generally, is income of the trust.

But

Section 2(24) (iia) of the Act has to be read with Section 12
of the Act. Section 12 deals with the income of trusts and
institutions from voluntary contributions, and Section 12(1)
reads as follows:“12. Income of trusts or institutions
from contributions.
(1)

9.

Any voluntary contributions received by
a trust created wholly for charitable or
religious purposes or by a institution
established wholly for such purposes
(not being contributions made with a
specific direction that they shall form
part of the corpus of the trust or
institution) shall for the purposes of
Section 11 be deemed to be income
derived from property held under trust
wholly for charitable or religious
purposes and the provisions of that
Section and Section 13 shall apply
accordingly.”

In CIT vs. Sthanakvasi Vardhman Vanik Jain

Sangh, (2003) 260 ITR 366(Guj.), the issue before the
Gujarat High Court was that whether donation received by
the assessee-trust of Rs.1,85,064/- which was not utilized
for the object of the trust, was income of the trust?

ITA No.184/2007

Page 5 of 8

10. It was held by the Gujarat High court that:“On the plain reading of section 12, it is
obvious that any voluntary contribution which
is made with a specific direction that they
shall form part of the corpus of the trust or
institution would not be deemed to be income
derived from the property held under trust
wholly for charitable or religious purposes.
Thus, the donation of Rs.1,85,064/- which was
received by the Assessee-trust with a specific
direction for construction of wadi formed part
of the corpus of the trust and was not income
of the trust.”
11.

Further, Section 11 of the Act also is worded in the

same way as expression within the parenthesis of Section
12. Section 11 of the Act deals with income derived from
property held for charitable or religious purposes.

It

provides, inter alia, that if the income is applied wholly to
charitable/religious purposes in India, it is to be excluded
from the total income of the recipient.
13.

The concept of „voluntary contribution‟ has been

explained by N.D.Ojha C.J. speaking for the Division Bench
(as his Lordship then was), in the case of CIT vs. Madhya

Pradesh Anaj Tilhan Vyapari Mahasangh (1988) 171
ITR 677 as:

ITA No.184/2007

Page 6 of 8

“The contributions, in order to be voluntary,
had to be made willingly and without
compulsion and the money was to be gifted or
given gratuitously without consideration…..”
14.

In the view of the above discussion, it is clear from

the facts of the case that the donations received were
voluntary contributions. For this purpose, relevant clause
6 reads as under:“20% collection charges will be deducted
before issuing the cheque. If you offer to
collect donation of Rs. 10,000/- per year
collection charges will be levied at the rate
of 15%.”
15.

From the perusal of the above clause, it is clear that it

was optional for the consulting doctors to contribute
donations which are also apparent from the fact that only
61 doctors opted for such arrangement out of 141 doctors
working for the Assessee.

The above mentioned clause

neither binds nor forces the doctors.

It only gives the

option to give or arrange donations in case he wants less
deduction from the professional fee payable to him.
Considering this condition it can be said that the donations
by the doctors have been given of its own volition and
without any force. In this view, the action of the Assessing

ITA No.184/2007

Page 7 of 8

Officer in holding that donations received were forced
donations was not justified.
16.

Further, the Tribunal also gone through the receipts

issued by the Assessee trust which shows that contribution
by doctors was towards corpus of the fund and, therefore,
could not be treated as income of the Assessee.
17.

In view of the above discussion, it is clear that in the

present case, the voluntary contributions did not constitute
income in the hands of the recipient trust. The Assessee
had received voluntarily contribution towards corpus of the
fund and consequently the sum of Rs.6,10,000/- could not
be treated as income of the Assessee. Thus, no fault can be
found with the order passed by the Tribunal and no
substantial question of law arises at all.
18.

Hence, the appeal filed by the Revenue is, hereby

dismissed.
