1.

These are three criminal appeals arising out of
judgment of conviction dated 11th October, 2004
under Section 364-A/120-B IPC and order dated 13th
October, 2004 inflicting sentence of imprisonment for
life and a fine of Rs.1500/- on respective appellants
and in default of payment of fine to undergo RI for six
months.

2.

The factual content of prosecution case reveals
that on 17th April, 2001 at about 8 pm Dipanshu, a
five year old child, went missing. Jitender, father and
Smt. Sharda, mother of the child searched for him at
different places in the vicinity but in vain. Jitender,
on failing to

trace his child went to Police Post

Crl. Appeal No.942/2004

Page 2 of 29

Fountain to inform the police about the incident.
Later he also

made a phone call to PCR in this

regard. A police officer from PCR visited the house of
Jitender.

On an information from PCR regarding

incident a DD entry No.53 was made at PS Kotwali.
A copy of such DD report was sent to SI Rajender
Singh of Police Post Fountain for necessary action.
SI Rajender Singh, accompanied by other police staff,
reached the house of the complainant but could not
come across with the family members of the missing
child. He waited for return of the complainant and
on his return to his house, his statement
recorded by SI Rajender Singh, which was

later in the course of day, at about 2.30 pm/3.00 pm,

On behalf of appellant Dinesh Kumar it was

child and of

argued that even if

factum of

kidnapping of child is held proved, in the given
situation, it would be a case covered under Section
365 IPC only.
7.

Learned counsel for appellants

Ram Kumar

and Naurangi pointed out with reference to the
statement of Dipanshu, PW-3 that even though
according to

prosecution case they were

party to

criminal conspiracy in kidnapping him for ransom
and were stated to have been present guarding him
at the place of his captivity, he did not identify either
of

them in the course of his statement before the

Crl. Appeal No.942/2004

Page 7 of 29

court

and thus inspite of

the fact that

they had

refused to participate in test identification parade, in
the absence of their identification before the court by
the kidnapped

child,

it was unreasonable

to find

that they had actually played any role in kidnapping
and keeping the child in captivity for ransom.
8.

The learned counsel for appellant Bharat
Singh questioned the recovery of the clothes of
kidnapped child from his house pursuant to the
disclosure made by

him,

in the face of glaring

contradictions in the statements of witnesses of such
recovery. It was

contended that the appellant was

picked up from his house and falsely implicated in
this case on account of

complainant's animosity

towards co-appellant Dinesh Kumar as he happened
to be his (Dinesh Kumar) friend. It was disputed on
his behalf that he had ever pointed out

the STD

booth at Debai as claimed or that he had made any
ransom call on phone to the complainant from that
booth.
9.

Referring to inconsistencies in the statements
Crl. Appeal No.942/2004

Page 8 of 29

of prosecution witnesses in whose presence

the

kidnapped child was claimed to have been recovered
from village Paseri,

it was contended by learned

counsel for appellant Kharak Singh that the child was
never recovered

from his custody and that he was

falsely implicated in the case by lifting him from his
house in another village near village Paseri.
10.

Ms.

Fizani

Page 9 of 29

and

concerned

officials

apart,

the

fate

of

prosecution case to a great extent depends on the
statements of Jitender, PW-2, father of the kidnapped
child and Gopal Singh, PW-5 as they are the ones
who remained

associated with investigation of the

case right from the stage of registration of FIR until
recovery of kidnapped child.
13.

The fact that the child had gone missing

around 8.00 pm on 17th June, 2001 is evident in view
of a FIR

Ext. PW-10/A based on a statement Ext.

PW-2/A of Jitender, PW-2, father of the child, being
registered at 9.15 am on 18th June, 2001. Appellant
Dinesh Kumar, according to Jitender PW-2 was
apprehended and brought to his house by Jasvinder,
his younger brother and one Ravinder, son of his
uncle Vir Singh at about 2.30/3.00 pm on 18th June,
2001 who was later handed over to the police. Prior to
appellant Dinesh Kumar being apprehended a ransom
call for Rs.2 lacs

had already been received by

Jitender PW-2 on his phone.

According to Jitender

PW-2, appellant Dinesh Kumar had disclosed to him
Crl. Appeal No.942/2004

Page 10 of 29

that such ransom call was made by him only. It was
contended by learned counsel for appellant Dinesh
Kumar that the ransom call

according to

the

prosecution case was made from a STD booth at
Debai in District Bulandshahar far away from Delhi.
He argued that if appellant Dinesh Kumar was the
one who would have made that ransom call, it could
not have been possible for him to have reached Delhi
by 2.30 or 3.00 pm when he was claimed to have
been apprehended and brought to the house of
Jitender, PW-2.

Jitender, PW-2 does not

claim to

have identified the voice of the caller who had made
the ransom call on his phone. He named appellant
Dinesh Kumar as the one making that call solely on
the basis of a so called disclosure in that regard being
made to him by none else

than appellant Dinesh

Kumar himself. The statement of Jitender, PW-2 in
this regard

however being

based on alleged

disclosure by Dinesh Kumar, appellant, this part of
his statement cannot be used against this appellant
to find that it was he who
Crl. Appeal No.942/2004

had actually made the
Page 11 of 29

ransom call.

The learned counsel for the appellant

Dinesh Kumar made reference to the statement of SI
Rajinder, PW-7 where he claims to have had effected
the arrest of this appellant at about 4.00 am on 18 th
June, 2001 and recorded his disclosure statement at
about 4.05 am.

It is however

discovered that the

time of arrest of appellant Dinesh Kumar as recorded
in his statement suffers from inadvertent clerical
mistake which is evident from the fact that in terms of
his arrest memo Ext. PW-2/K,

his actual time of

arrest is 4.00 pm on 18th June, 2001 and not 4.00
am. There would thus appear no discrepancy in the
statement of Jitender, PW-2 regarding apprehension
of appellant

Dinesh Kumar around 2.30/3.00 pm

and his arrest by the police later at 4.00 pm.
14.

Ext. PW-2/B is the disclosure statement made

by appellant Dinesh Kumar before the police in the
presence of Jitender, PW-2 and Gopal Singh, PW-5. In
his statement under Section
Dinesh Kumar disowned

313 Cr.P.C. appellant

having made any such

disclosure statement. To lend support to his plea in
Crl. Appeal No.942/2004

Page 12 of 29

this regard a reference was made to the statements of
Jitender, PW-2 and Gopal Singh, PW-5 who, though
signed

the

disclosure

statement

Ext. P-2/B

as

witnesses thereto, categorically affirmed that the
disclosure as contained therein was actually not made
in their immediate presence.

May be that what

Jitender, PW-2 and Gopal Singh, PW-5 stated

in

regard to the disclosure statement by appellant
Dinesh Kumar is true to the extent

that the same

was actually not made in their immediate presence
but at the same time, from their statements it is
evident that

they were

very much present at the

police station where the appellant Dinesh Kumar was
being interrogated to ascertain whereabouts of the
kidnapped child and further that he did disclose to
the police the place where the kidnapped child could
be found. Noticeably, before arrest and interrogation
of appellant Dinesh Kumar, the parents as also the
police were clueless in regard to place of captivity of
the child and it was only on appellant Dinesh Kumar
making a disclosure in that respect
Crl. Appeal No.942/2004

that a raiding

Page 13 of 29

party comprising police officials, Jitender, PW-2 and
Gopal Singh, PW-5 set out on the evening

of

18 th

June, 2001 initially for village Kaser Khurd in
Bulandshahar where

co-appellants Bharat Singh @

Deputy, Ram Kumar and Naurangi were arrested and
thereafter reached village Paseri where the kidnapped
child was found in the custody of co-appellant Kharak
Singh.

The entire operation

leading to eventual

recovery of the kidnapped child in such a short time
could not have been possible

without a definite

information regarding place of captivity of the child
being made available to the father of the child and the
police. There could be no better person other than
the one who was himself involved in kidnapping the
child and keeping him in captivity for ransom to
supply the

information in this regard to the police.

Thus, inspite of the fact that the disclosure statement
Ext. PW-2/B is not proved to have been made in the
immediate presence of Jitender, PW-2 and Gopal
Singh, PW-5, there appears no reason to entertain
any doubt about

the disclosure statement as such

Crl. Appeal No.942/2004

Page 14 of 29

being made by the appellant, Dinesh Kumar.

A

finding in this respect is fortified also from the fact

17.

Appellant Bharat Singh, @ Deputy, upon his

apprehension made a disclosure statement Ext. PW2/G leading to recovery of clothes of the kidnapped

that the

clothes were recovered

from behind the

main gate on the ground floor of

the house of

appellant Bharat Singh @ Deputy. At the time of his
recovery

the

clothes which

did not belong to him.

Recovery of

child's clothes from the premises of appellant Bharat
Singh @ Deputy at his pointing out clearly indicates
that his clothes, which he was wearing at the time of
kidnapping, were changed before he was left

with

appellant Kharak singh in village Paseri.
18.

Dipanshu PW-3, the kidnapped child,

knew

appellants Dinesh Kumar and Bharat Singh @ Deputy
before the date of incident. He was, therefore, able to
name them.

He however,

did not know appellants

Ram Kumar, Naurangi and Kharak Singh before the

Page 17 of 29

day of kidnapping and came across with them only
after appellant Dinesh Kumar had taken him along
and handed him over to them

before returning to

Delhi. Dipanshu, PW-3, in his statement before the
court told that apart from appellant Kharak Singh,
appellants Ram Kumar and Naurangi were also
noticed present while he was held in captivity. He
stated that appellant Ram Kumar had even slapped
him once. It was argued on behalf of appellants Ram
Kumar and Naurangi that Dipanshu, PW-3 did not
identify either of them while making
before the court.

his statement

In this context it is significant to

take note of relevant part of statement of Dipanshu,
PW-3 which reads thus :
“.....in the house accused (Ram Kumar)
had also met me. He had given me
beatings also. In the garden apart from
accused Dinesh Kumar and accused (Ram
Kumar) accused (Naurangi) had also met
me.....”
It appears that the names of appellants Ram
Kumar and Naurangi Lal were

witness particularly

pointing towards them

as

mentioning of their names in bracket could not have
been possible without their being singled out by him
in the course of his statement.

It seems that

the

learned trial court unwittingly omitted to record its
observation that both these appellants namely, Ram
Kumar and Naurangi Lal, were specifically identified
before it by the witness. Ram Kumar and Naurangi
Lal thus cannot be allowed to take undue advantage
of said omission on the part of learned trial court.
19.

Another

argument advanced on behalf of

appellant Ram Kumar was that Dipanshu, PW-3, in
his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. had named
only Dinesh Kumar and Bharat Singh @ Deputy and
that his being named by the witness before the court
was only an improvement prompted by tutoring.

A

look at the statement of Dipanshu, PW-3 would show
that he as a matter of fact nowhere mentioned the
name of this appellant as, had it been so there could

His attention was

however not invited to his statement under Section
164 Cr.P.C. to bring out
argued on behalf of

the contradiction. It was

appellant Ram Kumar that in

regard to said omission the witness was not required
to be confronted with his previous statement under
Section 164 Cr.P.C. and that the same could still be
used to point out contradiction between his
statement and

the one made before the court.

that
To

support the contention, reference was made to a
decision of the Supreme Court in Laxman & Ors. Vs.
State of Maharashtra (1974) 2 SCR 505. This
a case in which

applicability of

Section 145

of

reference to a previous statement under Section 162

Notably a statement under

Section 164 Cr.P.C.

is not in the nature of

substantive evidence and it can be used only to
corroborate the statement of a witness or

In view of failure to

the witness with his statement under

Section 164 Cr.P.C. such statement cannot be used to
supplement the argument that the witness has
contradicted himself by omitting to mention
the

said

about

appellant in his statement under Section

164 Cr.P.C. It is noticed that the statement of the
witness under Section 164 Cr.P.C. vide Ext. PW 9/B
is a very cryptic one.

At the time of making such

statement Dipanshu PW-3 was only five year old. It
was difficult for a child of that age to have recounted
all necessary details concerning his kidnapping and
captivity.

Eliciting

requisite information by putting

simple and short questions to him could have been a
better way of recording his statement instead

of

letting him make the same on his own. Left to him,
he made

a sort of statement which a child of that

age could have. In any case, since the witness was not
confronted with his
Crl. Appeal No.942/2004

statement under Section 164
Page 21 of 29

Cr.P.C. to afford him an opportunity of explaining
omission in making mention of presence of
Kumar, appellant that statement

now cannot be

allowed to be made use of to point out contradiction
in his statement before the court.
20.

Dipanshu PW-3 was, according to prosecution

case recovered from the custody of the appellant
Kharak Singh vide memo Ext. PW-2/H. Appellant
Bharat Singh, @ Deputy had led the raiding party to
village Paseri and pointed out the place where
appellant Kharak Singh was sleeping on a cot in the
open with the kidnapped child. Apart from Jitender
Singh PW-2, the recovery of child was effected in the
presence of Netra Pal, PW-4 and one Pramod Kumar
who happened to be residents of

the same village.

Netra Pal, PW-4 while deposing before the court did
not support the prosecution case that the child was
recovered in his presence. He, of course, admitted his
having signed at point B on recovery memo Ext. PW2/H but added that his such signature was obtained
at his residence only where the police had come with

The fact that

indicates that he was

recovered

from that

very

village. The statement of Jitender Singh PW-2, Gopal
Singh PW-5, SI Sunder Singh PW-13 and SI Sanjay
Sharma PW-14 clearly proved that

the child

was

Certain

statements of the aforesaid

witnesses of recovery of child regarding exact place

sleeping

with the child were brought out with reference to
their

respective

statements,

on

behalf

of

the

appellants to contend that no such recovery of child
was actually

made from appellant Kharak Singh.

Contradictions in regard to the location of house of
Pratap Singh,

nature and details of construction in

that house were also pointed out on behalf of

the

appellants to question the credibility of the witnesses
of recovery of child. Noticeably, the raiding party had
reached village Paseri during night. It was dark and

situation it was difficult

In such a

for the witnesses, who

happened to visit village Paseri for the first time, to
have been able to observe the location of the house
as also the nature and details of construction of that
house.

The prosecution did not examine Pramod

Kumar as he was stated to have been won over by
the appellants. The apprehension of the prosecution
in this regard could not be held unfounded keeping
in view that even the other witness namely Netra Pal,
PW-4 resiled from his statement under Section 161
Cr. P.C. to the police when he omitted to depose that
the child was recovered from appellant Kharak Singh
in his presence.

As already pointed out

Netra Pal

PW-4 has in any case corroborated the statements of
Jitender Singh PW-3, Gopal Singh PW-5, SI Sunder
Singh PW-13 and SI Sanjay Sharma PW-14 with
respect to the presence of the child at village Paseri.
SI Sunder Singh PW-13 was not cross examined on
behalf of appellants Bharat Singh, Ram Kumar and
Naurangi Lal as far as recovery of child from appellant
Crl. Appeal No.942/2004

Page 24 of 29

Kharak Singh was concerned. It is notable that it was
appellant Bharat Singh who had led the raiding party
to the place of recovery of child. Given the nature of
contradictions

as pointed out

on behalf of the

appellants, the

approach of learned

trial court

in

ignoring the same while finding that Dipanshu PW-3
was recovered

from the possession of appellant

Kharak Singh cannot be faulted.
21.

Jitender Singh PW-2 categorically stated that

he had received a ransom call on his phone at about
12.30/1.00 pm on 18th June, 2001 and had told the
police about the same.

SI Rajender Singh,

corroborated his statement in this regard.

PW-7
Though

Jitender Singh PW-2 could not identify the person
making the ransom call, the fact that the child was
kept in captivity by the appellants after being
kidnapped clearly indicates that the ransom call
would have been made by one of the appellants. The
evidence on record proves that a call was made from
STD booth at

Debai on the phone of the Jitender

Singh PW-2 on 18th June, 2001. The STD booth at

Since appellants Kharak Singh,

Lal and Ram Kumar were not

known to

Dipanshu PW-3 before the date of kidnapping,

the

prosecution applied for their test identification parade
to fix their identity but they refused on the plea that
their photographs were already there with the police.
In their respective statements under Section 313
Cr.P.C. the said appellants however took a different
stand to the effect that they had been shown to the
witnesses at the police station as also outside the
court. It appears that since the said appellants knew
that the child would be able to identify them in the

Page 26 of 29

event of their taking part in test identification parade
they found it advisable to decline their participation
in TIP by pleading that they had been shown to the
witnesses. Refusal on their part to participate in TIP
without any

acceptable

justification thus leads to

adverse inference.
23.

An alternative argument was raised on behalf

of appellant Dinesh Kumar that since no bodily injury
was caused to the kidnapped child and also as there
is no evidence of any ransom demand being made for
his release, he could not have been convicted for an
offence punishable under Section 364-A IPC and that
at best

it is a case which would fall under Section

365 IPC only. As far as question of ransom demand
is concerned, in view of a finding that

ransom

demand was in fact made to the father of the
kidnapped child by appellant Bharat Singh, any
argument

to the contrary would not hold good.

Jitender PW-2 testified that

while making ransom

demand the caller had threatened him not to inform
the police about the same, else the result would be

Page 27 of 29

bad. Such threat was obviously to be understood in
relation to the

well being of the child, even though

the caller did not spell out the precise nature of threat
to the child in clear terms. The threat as extended on
phone was good enough to disturb the mental
equilibrium

of child's parents and make them

anxious about his life. As deposed by Dipanshu PW-3
he was even beaten by appellant Ram Kumar while
being in their captivity. For a child of such tender
age even a slap was sufficient to scare him and make
him apprehensive of further bodily injury being
caused.

There is thus no substance in the plea that

the offence committed was one under Section 365 IPC
only and not under Section 364-A IPC.
24.

The evidence on record

appellants

proves that

all the

were party to a criminal conspiracy

playing different roles in kidnapping

the child and

keeping him in captivity for ransom.
25.

We in the ultimate analysis find no reason to

take a view different from the
learned

trial court.

Crl. Appeal No.942/2004

We,

one recorded by the

therefore, uphold

the

under Section 364 A read with Section 120 B IPC and
as a consequence dismiss the appeals.
