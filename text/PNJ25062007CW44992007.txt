1.

Petitioners, 5 in number, pray that orders dated

23.5.2007 and 30.5.2007 passed by the Registrar, Trade Unions
be quashed and further directions be issued to him to prepare a
fresh voters' list and thereafter conduct elections for the posts of
office bearers in the central council of respondent No.1 trade
union. First 3 petitioners are the ex office bearers of respondent

claimed by the petitioners that the applicable bye-laws of
respondent No.1 envisage a 3 tier system i.e. central council,
divisional council and branch council to manage the affairs of
respondent No.1 and its divisions and that elections to the posts
of office bearers has to be as per the constitution, rules and byelaws of respondent No.1. It is stated that respondent No.1 has
118 branch councils.

It is stated that delegates of the branch

councils participate in the election process of the central council.
Thus, a proper and valid conduct of elections at the branch level
is a sine qua non for constituting a valid voters list to elect office
bearers of the central council. It is stated that vide order dated
23.5.2007, the Registrar, Trade Unions has mechanically adopted
the voters' list prepared by Justice Devinder Gupta (Retd.), a
former Chief Justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which is
stated to in violation of the bye-laws of respondent No.1.

It is

stated that a learned Single Judge of this Court had adversely
commented upon the said voters' list.

It is stated that the

consequential order dated 30.5.2007 notifying 25.6.2007 as the
date of poll has therefore to be quashed.
2.

Brief

backdrop

facts,

relevant

to

be

noted,

for

adjudicating the issue are that elections to elect the office bearers
of the central council of respondent No.1 are required to be held
every 3 years. The last election was held on 4-5.7.2002. Thus,
the term of the office bearers ended on 4-5.7.2005.

Fresh

elections could not be held due to inter se dispute and resultant
WP(C) No.4499/07

Page 2 of8

litigation between the 2 groups.
3.

Proceedings were initiated in this Court and the High

Court of Judicature at the Allahabad. These proceedings related
to the issue of finalization of the list of eligible voters to elect the
office bearers of the central council.
4.

Vide batch of writ petitions, lead matter being WP(C)

No.10251-55/2005, a list of central council members i.e. persons
eligible to vote as circulated on 24.5.2005 was challenged.

By

consent of parties, Justice Devinder Gupta (Retd.) a former Chief
Justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court was appointed to
conduct the elections after finalizing the voters' list.
5.

Pursuant to the consent order passed, Justice Devinder

Gupta (Retd.) finalized a list of voters and submitted a report to
the Court. The list as finalized was challenged. Vide order dated
27.3.2006, the batch of writ petitions were disposed of noting that
the petitioners had withdrawn their consent and that a dispute
pertaining to the affairs of the Union could not form the subject
matter of a writ proceedings.

It was held that the appropriate

forum where the disputes could be adjudicated would be a Civil
Court. In para 19 of the order dated 27.3.2006 it was noted that a
number of serious, not frivolous, objections have been raised
against the list.
6.

From an order passed by the High Court of Judicature

at Allahabad proceedings reached the Supreme Court.

Civil

Appeal No.3953/2006 was decided by the Supreme Court on
WP(C) No.4499/07

Page 3 of8

6.9.2006.

The said order relates to the issue as to who would

conduct the elections to the office bearers of the central council of
respondent No.1. Noting that elections were overdue, vide order
dated 6.9.2006, Supreme Court appointed the Registrar, Trade
Unions as the administrator of respondent No.1 and empowered
him to conduct elections to the central council of respondent
No.1. It was directed by the Supreme Court that any dispute or
difference in regard to the voters' list shall also be determined by
the Registrar, Trade Unions.
7.

Order dated 27.3.2006 passed by the learned Single

Judge of this Court deciding WP(C) No.10251-55/2005 and
connected writ petitions was challenged before a Division Bench
of this Court. The said appeal being LPA No.596-600/2006 was
disposed of by the Division Bench vide order dated 24.4.2007,
holding that in view of the directions issued by the Supreme Court
nothing remained for adjudication in the matter.
8.

Acting as administrator of respondent No.1, Registrar,

Trade Unions took over custody of the relevant record and
possession of the head office of respondent No.1. He proceeded
to finalize the voters' list.

Whereas one group prayed that the

voters' list prepared by Justice Devinder Gupta (Retd.) be adopted
the other group opposed the prayer and requested Registrar,
Trade Unions to prepare a fresh list.
9.

The Registrar, Trade Unions considered the objections

and opined that Justice Devinder Gupta (Retd.) had dealt with the
WP(C) No.4499/07

Page 4 of8

objections which were pressed by the other group with prayer
that a fresh voters' list be prepared. He held that since Justice
Devinder Gupta (Retd.) had already dealt with the matter and he
was of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served to de
novo examine the objections, vide order dated 23.5.2007
Registrar, Trade Unions adopted the same list.

Thereafter, he

issued a notification on 1.6.2007 notifying the schedule for the
ensuing elections.

In between, he issued the order dated

30.5.2007 notifying that the poll would be held on 25.6.2007.
10.

Writ petitions were filed in the Allahabad High Court

raising a challenge to the order dated 23.5.2007.

On 7.6.2007

following order was passed:“Sri Govind Saran, Advocate accepted notice on behalf
of respondent Nos.1 and 3 and Sri Ashok Kumar Singh,
Advocate accepts notice for respondent No.2. The
petitioner is permitted to serve notice to the respondent
No.4. Steps be taken within a period of one week.
List thereafter.

11.

In the meantime, liberty is given to the petitioner to file
an objection against the order passed by the
Administrator dated 23.5.2007. If such objection is filed
the same shall be decided by a speaking and reasoned
order within a period of one week from the date of filing
of the objection. It is provided that election as notified
may be held but the final result may not be declared.”
The instant writ petition was filed on 5.6.2007, a date

after the notification dated 1.6.2007 was issued by the Registrar,
Trade Unions.
12.

In my considered opinion, the instant writ petition has

to be dismissed on various counts.

WP(C) No.4499/07

13.

Firstly, as opined by the Division Bench of this Court

vide order dated 24.4.2007 in LPA No.596-600/2006 the conduct
of elections was vested in the Registrar, Trade Unions by the
Supreme Court vide order dated 6.9.2006 with a clear caveat that
in case of any dispute it would be open to the parties to approach
the concerned High Court for requisite directions. The concerned
High Court was held to be the High Court of Judicature at
Allahabad. The Division Bench has categorically held as under:-

14.

“The order of the Supreme Court is clear and explicit
which state that if there be any necessity it shall be
open to the parties to approach the concerned High
Court for requisite directions. When it is stated that “it
shall be open to the parties to approach the concerned
High Court” it necessarily speaks of the High Court
which had rendered the decision against which the SLP
was filed. If any clarification is necessary in respect of
the order of the Supreme Court it would be necessary
for the applicant to move an appropriate application
before the competent court. We are of the considered
opinion that this Court cannot pass an order or
clarification as sought for by the applicant.”
Secondly, recourse has already taken by some persons

who are aggrieved by the order dated 23.5.2007. They have filed
a petition before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. As
noted herein above, the Allahabad High Court is already seized of
the issue. Thus, the concerned High Court i.e. the High Court of
Judicature at Allahabad having taken cognizance of the issue
pertaining to the finalization of the voters' list, the principle of
comity requires this Court to adopt a hands off approach.
15.

Thirdly, it is not a case where Registrar, Trade Unions

has mechanically adopted the list of eligible voters prepared by

WP(C) No.4499/07

Page 6 of8

Justice Devinder Gupta (Retd.).

The Registrar, Trade Unions

adopted the said list as a draft list and after hearing objections to
the same has proceeded to pass a detailed order dated 23.5.2007
giving reasons as to why he has adopted the said list. Thus, the
case projected in the petition that the Registrar, Trade Unions
could not have adopted the list prepared by the Justice Devinder
Gupta (Retd.) as if the same was a finalized list is without any
substratum.
16.

I may note that the Registrar, Trade Unions has

incorrectly recorded that the list prepared by Justice Devinder
Gupta (Retd.) has been accorded a judicial sanction.

This

observation is incorrect inasmuch as far from according a
sanction to the list, a learned Single Judge of this Court had noted
that there were serious objections raised to the list.

But, said

incorrect recording of a fact does not vitiate the order dated
23.5.2007

inasmuch

as

the

Registrar,

Trade

Unions

has

independently scrutinized the list and has dealt with the
objections filed thereto. The election process having commenced
post finalization of the voters' list by issuance of the notification
dated 1.6.2007 notifying the schedule for conduct of elections,
law leans against interference in the election process requiring all
electoral disputes to be adjudicated at the post election stage.
17.

Lastly, as held by the learned Single Judge of this Court

in his order dated 27.3.2006 writ remedy is not available where
substratum of a dispute relates to the affairs of a Registrar, Trade
WP(C) No.4499/07

Page 7 of8

Unions. It has been opined that appropriate remedy is by way of
suit.

More so, for the reason, nature of dispute pertaining to

finalization of the voters' list, in the instant case, requires
adjudication of disputed questions of fact.
18.

The writ petition is dismissed.

19.

No costs.
