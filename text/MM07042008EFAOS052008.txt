1.

The Appellant has filed the present application for an ex parte ad

interim order and the accompanying Appeal against the impugned judgment
th

and order dated 4 January, 2008 passed by the learned Single Judge of this
CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 1 of 23

Hon'ble Court in Execution Petition No. 321/2003.

By the impugned

judgment, the learned Single Judge had dismissed the objections filed by the
Appellant to the execution of the judgment and decree, which were to the
effect that the judgment and decree dated 28th March, 2003 in CS(OS) No.
749/1994 had been obtained by playing fraud on the Hon'ble Court by the
Respondent nos.1 to 4.
2.

The case of the appellant is as follows: -

(a)

The respondent no.1 filed a Suit bearing No. 749/1994 in this Court

seeking specific performance of the Agreement to Sell dated 30th April,
1993 in respect of Property No. S-23, Panchsheel Park, New Delhi
(hereinafter referred to as 'the suit property'). The Appellants were not made
a party to these proceedings and the suit was contested by Respondent no.2
by filing its written statement stating that the Agreement to Sell dated 30th
April, 1993 was entered into by the respondent no.2 as the power of attorney
holder of K.D. Somaia who had expired thereafter. Subsequently, an order

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 2 of 23

and decree dated 28th March, 2003 came to be passed by a learned Single
Judge of this Hon'ble Court recording the settlement between the parties as
follows:“Statement of the plaintiff as also of defendant
No.6, Managing Director of defendant No.5 have
been recorded. Application Ex.C-1 is signed by the
plaintiff and its counsel. It is also supported by
affidavit of the plaintiff. The application is also
signed by defendants no.6 & 7 which is duly
supported by an affidavit of defendant no.6. Mr.
Arun Kathpalia on behalf of defendant No.2 to 4
has stated that the said defendants claim no interest
in the property and have no objection to the suit
being decreed in terms of Exh. C-1. Defendant
No.1 is proceeded ex-parte vide order dated
1.5.1998. The suit is, accordingly, decreed in terms
of Exhibit C-1. Exhibit C-1 shall form part of the
decree. Parties will abide by terms as set out in
Ex.C-1. The undertaking given by defendant No.6
on behalf of defendant No.5 to vacate and hand
over possession of the entire first floor to the
plaintiff within a month from today is accepted.
The said defendant shall also deliver the remaining
documents of title. Parties are left to bear their
own costs. It is made clear that the mere factum of
the decree being passed in terms of Ex.C-1 shall
not tantamount to waiver or discharge from
payment of any stamp duty or statutory levy.”

(b)

The decree dated 28th March, 2003 was put into execution by the

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 3 of 23

respondent no.1 by way of Ex.P.No. 321/2003 for being put into possession
of the first floor and by execution of the documents of title in his favour.
The appellant filed objections to the execution petition claiming to be in
possession of the first floor of the suit property. By way of the impugned
judgment dated 4th January, 2008, the objections of the appellant were
dismissed and the appellant was directed to hand over the possession to the
respondent no.1 within 30 days from 4th January, 2008.
3.

The learned Single Judge on 16th May, 2007 framed the following

issues:“1.
Whether the obstructionists acquired any
right or interest in the suit property? If so, the date
thereof? Onus on the obstructionsts.
2.
Whether the decree in question was
obtained in collusion between the parties to the suit
and suffers from any fraud in turn affecting the
rights of obstructionists?
Onus on the
obstructionists.
3.
Relief.”

4.

The issues were answered in negative against the appellant in the

following terms:CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 4 of 23

“31. I am thus unable to accept the plea of the
learned counsel for the obstructionist that the
testimony of the decree holder has to be looked at
with any greater degree of scrutiny than for the said
purpose. It is not for the decree holder to answer
queries in respect of transactions alleged between
judgement debtors 5 to 7 and the obstructionist.
The decree holder would have no knowledge of
such transactions. It is the obstructionist who was
claiming right to occupy the property and for that
had to establish that some interest had been acquired
in the suit property.
32.
The obstructionist other than claiming
possession of the original documents has not been
able to substantiate any of its pleas and thus has
miserably failed to discharge the onus.
The
transaction thus pleaded by the obstructionist is
vague. No exact amount has been stated in the
testimony of the witness. The amount is stated to be
at the relevant stage varying between Rs.2.00 to
3.00 crore. There is no document evidencing such
dues owned from M/s. Durga Builders to the
obstructionist. .........
.........................
36.
The obstructionist has really not been able to
establish the date from which they came into
possession because there is no writing and evidence
for the same. The Local Commissioner who went to
visit the premises during the pendency of the suit
found no such possession. No doubt the visit of the
Local Commissioner is stated to be not for verifying
possession but on his visit the status of possession
has been put in the report. There were no boards or
any other material to show such user by the

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 5 of 23

obstructionist.
It is the own case of the
obstructionist that after the initial use, the room was
used only as a storage space. The bills for
electricity, water, telephone, etc. have also not been
produced to establish any user or occupation of the
same at the relevant period of time. The only
defence of the obstructionist is that it is M/s. Durga
Builders, which was paying the same pre-2000.
This plea is difficult to accept.
37.
The only conclusion which, thus, has to be
arrived at is that though the obstructionist did come
into possession, the same was only at some
subsequent stage after the injunction order
restraining the handing over of possession was
passed. It is apparent that the obstructionist derived
their claim from judgement debtors 5 to 7, they have
to go with judgement debtors 5 to 7. The present
proceeding is not for settlement of inter se claims
between judgement debtors 5 to 7 and the
obstructionist................
........ 41.
I am afraid the aforesaid plea cannot
be accepted. It is not necessary that the parties must
keep on fighting endlessly and go in trial. The suit
was contested for a period of nine years which itself
belies that there was any immediate development.
The litigation fatigue had set in and the parties
compromised. There is thus no collusion or fraud
established by the obstructionist of which the onus
had been put on it.
.....42.
In view of the findings arrived at on
the aforesaid issues being against the obstructionist,
the obstructionist is held not entitled to the

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 6 of 23

continued possession of the first floor of the
property and must forthwith hand over possession to
the decree holder within a period of thirty(30) days
from the date of the judgment failing which
warrants of possession would be liable to be issued.
Since the decree holder is the owner of the property,
the original documents of transaction filed by the
obstructionist in Court are liable to be handed over
to the decree holder on certified copies of the same
being placed on record.
The objections are
accordingly dismissed with costs of Rs.15,000.00
against the obstructionists.”

5.

The learned Senior counsel for the appellant Mr. Arun Jaitley

submitted that the suit property bearing No.23, Panchsheel Park, New Delhi
had been purchased by the respondent no.2 from the amounts due and
outstanding to the Appellant in the course of their contractual relationship.
All the original documents in relation to the property were deposited with
the appellant soon after its purchase by the respondent no.2 in 1993. By a
letter dated 28th January, 1993, the parties had agreed on a sharing
arrangement and in pursuance thereof, the appellant was put in possession of
the first floor and the common areas of the suit property. The appellant has
continued in peaceful, uninterrupted and unhindered possession of these
CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 7 of 23

areas since 1993 as demonstrated by the Report of the Local Commissioner.
The respondent no.2, to further secure the interest of the appellant had also
obtained a Will and General Power of Attorney from late K.D. Somaia, the
original recorded owner of the property, contemporaneously i.e. in 1993 in
favour of the Managing Director of the appellant. The entirety of these facts
clearly proves the interest of the appellant.
He further submitted that the respondent no.1 acting in collusion with
the respondents no. 2 to 4 filed a suit being CS(OS) No. 749/1994 seeking
specific performance of the Agreement to Sell dated 30th April, 1993 entered
into with the respondent no.2 for the sale of the suit property. The appellant
was not impleaded in these proceedings and a collusive decree dated
28.3.2003 was obtained by concealing material facts and evidence from this
Hon'ble Court.

This decree was a clear evidence of the conspiracy of the

respondents no.1 to 4 to avoid and side step the legal rights of the appellant
interalia by playing a fraud on this Court.

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 8 of 23

6.

The learned counsel for the respondent no.1, Mr. Rajiv Endlaw,

submitted that the appellant is merely an obstructionist to a decree. Even
though it was the submission of the respondent no.1 that the objection of the
appellant did not even merit any trial but the respondent no.1 did not
challenge the order putting the said objections to trial in view of the same
having been made time bound. The appellant however, in spite of the
opportunity of trial having been granted to it has failed to make out any case
whatsoever. The appellant has neither pleaded nor proved any independent
title to the first floor of the house and in fact, it is the case of the appellant
that it came into possession of the said first floor through the judgment
debtor-respondent no.2. Having been into possession through the judgment
debtor-respondent no.2, the appellant derives his rights, if any, only through
the judgment debtor-respondent no.2, and cannot have rights higher than the
respondent no.2.
He further contended that the appellant is enjoying the use and

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 9 of 23

occupation of the first floor of the house no. S-23, Panchsheel Park, New
Delhi. The appellant is enjoying the said premises without paying anything
and therefore the appellant for this reason only is interested in prolonging
these proceedings. The objections of the appellant remained pending for
more than three years due to the dilatory tactics adopted by the appellant.
Even after the learned Single Judge by the order dated May 16, 2007 framed
issues and directed time bound trial, the appellant did everything possible to
delay the trial.

The appellant sought adjournments before the Local

Commissioner appointed to record evidence. The appellant moved as many
as three applications for filing additional documents and examining
additional witnesses. The appellant even preferred an appeal being no.
EFA(OS) No. 26/2007. The learned counsel for the respondent emphasized
on the delaying tactics of the appellant and the intent of the appellant to
prolong his free stay in the premises.
7.

We are not inclined to go into the merits of the appeal at this stage of

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 10 of 23

the proceedings and the same is subject to the final outcome of the appeal.
We are, however, of the view that prima facie the learned Single Judge had
rightly observed that the appellant is merely an obstructionist to the decree.
The appellant had neither pleaded nor proved any independent title to the
first floor of the suit property and in fact it is the case of the appellant itself
that he came into possession of the said first floor of the suit property
through the judgment debtor-respondent no.2.

Prima facie, the appellant

would be liable to go out of the premises in execution of the decree against
the judgment debtor respondent no.2 and the rights, if any, of the appellant
can only be claimed against the judgment debtor i.e. respondent no.2 only.
7.

Prima facie, it is also pertinent to note that the appellant had come into

possession of the suit property either during the pendency of the suit or
thereafter when interim orders were operating against the judgment debtors
5 to 7. The original injunction order was passed on 18th April, 1994
restraining taking over of possession by judgment debtors 6 and 7, but since

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 11 of 23

the judgment debtors 5 to 7 claimed to be in possession, the said injunction
order was modified on 20th May, 1998 to the extent that the said judgment
debtors were not to part with possession or alienate the property without the
leave of the court. On 25th May, 1994, the local Commissioner appointed by
the court gave his report to the effect that respondent no.2 was in possession
of the entire house. The doctrine of lis pendens is applicable in the present
case and in the subsequent circumstances, the claim of the appellant is
subject to the ultimate decision of the pending EFA(OS) No. 5/2008.
9.

In our view the respondent no.2 after contesting the suit for specific

performance of the Agreement to Sell for 9 years entered into a compromise
to sell the suit property to respondent no.1 on receipt of the balance
consideration of Rs.1.80 crores and to execute the Sale Deed and put
respondent no.1 into possession of the house. The respondent no.1 paid the
balance consideration of Rs.1.80 crores in accordance with the terms of the
compromise in March 2003 and the decree was passed on 28th March, 2003

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 12 of 23

in terms of Exhibit C-1 as mentioned herein above. Thus, it is to be noticed
that the legal proceedings in this matter has been pending for the last 18
years and the respondent no.1 has been deprived of the possession of the
house for which he had paid Rs.60 lacs as far back as on 30th April, 1993 and
the balance of Rs.1.80 crores in accordance with the terms of the
compromise decree in March 2003. Pursuant to the order dated 5th February,
2008 the respondent no.1 made the valuation of the letting value of the
premises in question to be not less than Rs.1,25,000/- with effect from 2003
and not less than Rs.1,70,000/- with effect from 2005 and not less than
Rs.2,20,000/- with effect from 2006. Since the appellant is admittedly in
physical possession since at least March 2003, we do not think that at this
interim stage during the pendency of this appeal, it is necessary to disturb
the appellant's possession and accept the respondent's suggestion that the
property be handed over to them upon payment of the current rate of
Rs.2,20,000/- per month.

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 13 of 23

10.

In view of the above discussion, this application for stay of the

impugned order dated 4th January, 2008 passed by the learned Single Judge
cannot be granted without ensuring that use and occupation charges pursuant
to the decree dated 28th March, 2003 are secured and the pendency of this
appeal does not prejudice the parties. However, we are not deciding the
issue of the legality of the possession of the appellant at this stage as it is
subject to the final outcome of the appeal on merits.
11.

This Court passed the following order on 5th February, 2008: “Caveat Appl. No. 8/2008
Since the learned counsel for the respondent has
put in appearance, the caveat has been rendered
infructuous and accordingly stands disposed of.

th

of the damages from 28 March, 2003 upto date and file a
valuation of the market rent of the premises.
The execution of the Sale Deed may go on in the
meanwhile, but the status quo with respect to the
possession shall be maintained by the parties till the next
date of hearing.”

12.

Pursuant to the order dated 5th February, 2008, the respondent no.1

computed the market rent for the damages from 28th March, 2003 upto date
and filed the valuation of the current market rent of the premises in
occupation of the appellant with effect from 2003 and calculated the market
rent of the disputed premises to be not less than Rs.1,25,000/- per month and
with effect from 2005 not less than Rs.1,70,000/- per month and with effect
from 2006 not less than Rs.2,20,000/- per month.

The appellant did not file

any valuation in spite of the order of this Court. The learned counsel for the
respondent no.1 had even agreed to give a deposit for the compensation to
the appellant at the rate at which the valuation was computed by him,
provided the possession of the property was given to him during the
pendency of the appeal in this Court. We have, however, not accepted the

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 15 of 23

plea of the respondent to the effect that the possession of the property may
pass to the respondents.
13.

In view of the long pendency of litigation and in pursuance of the

order dated 5th February, 2008 of this Court wherein liberty was granted to
the parties to compute the market rent of the damages from 28th March, 2003
upto date and file a valuation of the market rent of the premises, we deem it
necessary to ourselves compute the occupation charges payable by the
appellant for the continued possession of the first floor of the suit property
during the pendency of the present appeal.

The position of law is settled by

the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Atma Ram
Properties (P) Ltd. vs. Federal Motors (P) Ltd. (2005) 1 Supreme Court
Case 705, where while construing Order 41 Rule 5 of Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908, it was held as under: “8. It is well settled that mere preferring of an appeal does
not operate as stay on the decree or order appealed against
nor on the proceedings in the court below. A prayer for the
grant of stay of proceedings or on the execution of decree
or order appealed against has to be specifically made to the
CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 16 of 23

appellate Court and the appellate Court has discretion to
grant an order of stay or to refuse the same. The only
guiding factor, indicated in the Rule 5 aforesaid, is the
existence of sufficient cause in favour of the appellant on
the availability of which the appellate Court would be
inclined to pass an order of stay. Experience shows that the
principal consideration which prevails with the appellate
Court is that in spite of the appeal having been entertained
for hearing by the appellate Court, the appellant may not
be deprived of the fruits of his success in the event of the
appeal being allowed. This consideration is pitted and
weighed against the other paramount consideration: why
should a party having succeeded from the Court below be
deprived of the fruits of the decree or order in his hands
merely because the defeated party has chosen to invoke the
jurisdiction of a superior forum. Still the question which
the Court dealing with a prayer for the grant of stay asks to
itself is: Why the status quo prevailing on the date of the
decree and/or the date of making of the application for stay
be not allowed to continue by granting stay, and not the
question why the stay should be granted.
9. Dispossession, during the pendency of an appeal of a
party in possession, is generally considered to be
'substantial loss' to the party applying for stay of execution
within the meaning of Clause (a) of Sub-rule (3) of Rule 5
of Order 41 of the Code. Clause (c) of the same provision
mandates security for the due performance of the decree or
order as may ultimately be passed being furnished by the
applicant for stay as a condition precedent to the grant of
order of stay. However, this is not the only condition which
the appellate Court can impose. The power to grant stay is
discretionary and flows from the jurisdiction conferred on
an appellate Court which is equitable in nature. To secure
an order of stay merely by preferring an appeal is not the
statutory right conferred on the appellant. So also, an
CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 17 of 23

appellate Court is not ordained to grant an order of stay
merely because an appeal has been preferred and an
application for an order of stay has been made. Therefore,
an applicant for order of stay must do equity for seeking
equity: Depending on the facts and circumstances of a
given case an appellate Court, while passing an order of
stay, may put the parties on such terms the enforcement
whereof would satisfy the demand for justice of the party
found successful at the end of the appeal. In South
Eastern Coalfields Ltd. v. State of M.P. and Ors., this
Court while dealing with interim orders granted in favour
of any party to litigation for the purpose of extending
protection to it, effective during the pendency of the
proceedings, has held that such interim orders, passed at an
interim stage, stand reversed in the event of the final
decision going against the party successful in securing
interim orders in its favour; and the successful party at the
end would be justified in demanding compensation and
being placed in the same situation in which it would have
been if the interim order would not have been passed
against it. The successful party can demand (a) the delivery
to it of benefit earned by the opposite party under the
interim order of the High Court, or (b) compensation for
what it has lost, and to grant such relief is the inherent
jurisdiction of the Court. In our opinion, while granting an
order of stay under Order 41 Rule 5 of the CPC, the
appellate court does have jurisdiction to put the party
seeking stay order on such terms as would reasonably
compensate the party successful at the end of the appeal in
so far as those proceedings are concerned. Thus, for
example, though a decree for payment of money is not
ordinarily stayed by the appellate Court, yet, if it exercises
its jurisdiction to grant stay in an exceptional case it may
direct the appellant to make payment of the decretal
amount with interest as a condition precedent to the grant

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 18 of 23

of stay, though the decree under appeal does not make
provision for payment of interest by the judgment-debtor to
the decree-holder. Robust commonsense, common
knowledge of human affairs and events gained by judicial
experience and judicially noticeable facts, over and above
the material available on record - all these provide useful
inputs as relevant facts for exercise of discretion while
passing an order and formulating the terms to put the
parties on. After all, in the words of Chief Justice
Chandrachud, speaking for the Constitution Bench in Olga
Tellis and Ors. v. Bombay Municipal Corporation and
Ors. - "commonsense which is a cluster of life's
experiences, is often more dependable than the rival facts
presented by warring litigants"......................
19. To sum up, our conclusions are:(1) while passing an order of stay under Rule 5 of Order
41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the appellate
Court does have jurisdiction to put the applicant on such
reasonable terms as would in its opinion reasonably
compensate the decree-holder for loss occasioned by delay
in execution of decree by the grant of stay order, in the
event of the appeal being dismissed and in so far as those
proceedings are concerned. Such terms, needless to say,
shall be reasonable;
(2) in case of premises governed by the provisions of the
Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, in view of the definition of
tenant contained in Clause (I) of Section 2 of the Act, the
tenancy does not stand terminated merely by its
termination under the general law; it terminates with the
passing of the decree for eviction. With effect from that
date, the tenant is liable to pay mesne profits or
compensation for use and occupation of the premises at
the same rate at which the landlord would have been able
CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 19 of 23

to let out the premises and earn rent if the tenant would
have vacated the premises. The landlord is not bound by
the contractual rate of rent effective for the period
preceding the date of the decree;
(3) the doctrine of merger does not have the effect of
postponing the date of termination of tenancy merely
because the decree of eviction stands merged in the decree
passed by the superior forum at a latter date.”
(emphasis supplied)

14.

Order 41 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, reads as

follows:
“Stay by Appellate Court – (1) An appeal shall
not operate as a stay of proceedings under a decree
or order appealed from except so far as the
Appellate Court may order, nor shall execution of a
decree be stayed by reason only of an sufficient
cause order stay of execution of such decree.
[explanation – An order by the Appellate
Court for the stay of execution of the decree
shall be effective from the date of the
communication of such order to the Court of
first instance, but an affidavit sworn by the
appellant, based on his personal knowledge,
stating that an order for the stay of execution
of the decree has been made by the Appellate
Court shall, pending the receipt from the
Appellate Court of the order for the stay of
execution or any order to the contrary, be
acted upon by the Court of first instance.]”

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 20 of 23

In light of the aforementioned position of law and as directed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Atma Ram Properties (supra) it is
amply clear that the Appellate court is not bound to grant an order of stay
merely because an appeal has been preferred and an application for an order
of stay has been made. An applicant who comes to the court for seeking a
stay order must do equity for seeking equity. While granting an order of
stay under Order 41 Rule 5 of the CPC the appellate court does have the
jurisdiction to put the parties seeking the stay order on such terms, as would
in its opinion reasonably compensate the decree holder, for the loss
occasioned by the delay in the execution of the decree by the grant of stay
order. The learned Single Judge in his judgment dated 16th May 2007 had
categorically held that the appellant is not entitled to the continued
possession of first floor of the suit property and must hand over possession
to the decree holder within a period of 30 days as the decree holder is the

CM No. 1773/2008 in EFA(OS) No. 5/2008

Page No. 21 of 23

owner of the property.

In the facts and circumstances of the present case,

this Court before passing an order of stay deems it necessary to put the
applicant on such reasonable terms as would, in our opinion, reasonably
compensate the decree holder for the loss occasioned by delay in the
execution of the decree by grant of the stay order, in the subsequent event of
the appeal being dismissed, as the case of the decree holder respondent no.1
herein stands on a higher pedestal than a successful litigant in a Suit for
eviction as the Appellant is in fact an objector/obstructionist in the
proceedings for execution of the decree.
15.

While admitting the appeal we direct that the appellant is, therefore,
