1. Union of India has preferred this petition under Article 226
of

the

Constitution

challenging

the

judgment

dated

20.4.2005 rendered by the Central Administrative Tribunal,
New Delhi, in OA No. 1217/2000.

By the said judgment,

the tribunal has directed that name of the respondent be
included in the Live Causal Labour Register and he be also

WP (C) No. 21387/2005

considered for re-engagement and other consequential
benefits at par with juniors.

In order to appreciate the

controversy, it would be necessary to take note of the basic
facts.

The respondent had worked as casual labour with

the Northern Railway at different locations and in different
spells as under:

i. From 3.5.1976 to 30.5.1976 under PWI Northern
Railway Jagadhari Workshop.
ii. From

16.9.1980

to

25.9.1980

under

PWI

Northern Railway, Ambala.
iii. From

1.12.1982

to

14.2.1983

under

PW1,

Northern Railway, Saharanpur.

2. It is clear that on the first two occasions the respondent
had worked for 27 days and 10 days respectively whereas
his spell on the third occasion was about 2½ months. After
1983, the respondent was never engaged.

Twelve years

thereafter, he filed OA No. 103/1995 before the Central
Administrative Tribunal praying for direction for entering
his name in the Live Casual Labour Register. This OA was
disposed of on 18.11.1996 directing the petitioners to
examine the fact whether he was qualified to be included in
the LCLR and inform the position. This OA was disposed of
WP (C) No. 21387/2005

Page 2 of 9

by common order passed along with other two OAs.

On

11.2.1998, Northern Railway, Ambala Division, got a notice
published

in

the

“Daily

News

Paper”

inviting

the

applications from all the persons who had worked as causal
labour under Ambala Division for being re-engaged for
Group D post. Several persons applied but respondent was
not one of those who ever responded and therefore, he lost
that opportunity for re-engagement.

3. Be that as it may, the case of the respondent was
considered having regard to the directions of the Tribunal
and order dated 11.2.1999 was passed stating that his
name could not be registered since he had worked before
1.1.1981 and did not file the required representation for
his name being entered in the LCLR up to 31.3.1987. We
may note at this stage that in so far as third spell of the
respondent from 1.12.1982 to 14.2.1983 is concerned, the
case of the petitioners as per their record is that the
respondent did not work during that period and he had
worked only on the first two occasions for 27 days and 10
days respectively.

4. After receiving this rejection order, the respondent filed
another OA No. 1217/2000 challenging the validity of order

dated 6.7.1999.
application

on

The petitioners herein contested this
various

grounds

which

included

the

contention that the OA was barred by limitation as cause of
action arose in the year 1987 when the name of the
respondent was not entered in the LCLR. The petitioners
also contended that on 30.4.1997 the name of the
respondent was wrongly included by Divisional Engineer-I,
Northern Railway without the required approval of the
competent authority and simply in compliance of order of
the Tribunal passed in OA No. 103/95.

This OA was

dismissed by the Tribunal on 14.2.2001 relying upon the
Full Bench of Tribunal dated 10.5.2000 titled as “Mahabir
Singh & Others v. Union of India & Others” and holding
that right of getting the name entered in the LCLR is not a
continuing cause of action and as the respondent did not
approach the Tribunal within the time limit, the said
application was barred by limitation.

The respondent

challenged that order by filing writ petition No. 5868/2001
before this Court. Order of the Tribunal was set aside vide
judgment dated 25.2.2005 by this Court and matter was
sent for fresh adjudication. After the remand of the case,
the Tribunal opined that the limitation was not an
impediment

Tribunal, thus, considered the matter on merits and held
that the impugned order dated 6.7.1999 was not in
accordance with law in view of the judgment of the
Tribunal in “Mithal Lal v. Union of India & Ors.” - OA1220/88(T)

decided

on

14.3.1989

holding

that

the

instructions issued by Railways on 28.8.1997 would apply
even to those casual workers who were disengaged before
1.1.1981 as well. It was, thus, held that since juniors to the
respondent were included in LCLR, the name of the
respondent should also be included, he be considered for
re-engagement and for other consequential benefits.

In

this writ petition, the Union of India has challenged the
aforesaid judgment primarily taking two grounds namely:

i. The Tribunal was wrong in holding that question
of limitation would not be an impediment as the
High Court had not decided the issue of limitation
in its order dated 25.2.2005.
ii. Even on merits, the respondent had no claim.

5. We are of the opinion that this petition deserves to be
allowed on both counts.

We have perused the order dated

25.2.2005 passed by this Court in writ petition No.
5868/2001. Reading of the said order would indicate that
WP (C) No. 21387/2005

Page 5 of 9

there was a challenge to the Tribunal's earlier order
dismissing the OA on the grounds of limitation. However,
what was argued by the respondent was that the question
of limitation was decided without taking into consideration
letter dated 21.10.1998 of the Divisional Railway Manager,
Amabala

Cantt.

Addressed

Northern Railway.

to the General

Manager,

The said order was reproduced and

after reproduction of the said letter, the High Court
proceeded to observe as under:
“Therefore, it is contended
before us that the impugned order
suffers from non-application of mind
and deserves to be set aside.
Without saying anything on the
merits, we set aside the impugned
order and remand the case back to
the Tribunal to decide the case on
merits.”
6. It is clear from the above that this High Court simply took
into consideration the argument of the respondent's
counsel to the effect that while deciding the question of
limitation the letter dated 21.10.1998 was not taken into
consideration

and

therefore

order

suffers

from

non-

application of mind. On this ground and without deciding
the question of limitation itself, the High Court set aside
the earlier order of the Tribunal and remanded the case
back to the Tribunal “to decide the case on merits”.

WP (C) No. 21387/2005

Page 6 of 9

However, the word “merit” in the context would clearly
show that merit relating to the contention about the
limitation as advanced by the petitioner herein and
rebutted by the respondent herein. The High Court itself
did not at all decide that question and therefore, it cannot
be said that the Tribunal was not to decide the issue of
limitation but only the claim of the petitioner in OA on
merits. Therefore, in the impugned judgment Tribunal has
wrongly concluded that in view of the aforesaid order, the
issue of limitation would not be an impediment. In fact the
intention behind the order dated 25.2.2005 is clear namely
to decide the question of limitation on merits i.e. after
taking into consideration letter dated 21.10.1998 on which
reliance was placed by the counsel for the respondent
herein.

7. In these circumstances, normally the course of action
should have been to set aside the order and remand the
case back to the Tribunal.

However, we feel that no

purpose would be served as even on merits the respondent
has no case in view of legal position which has emerged in
recent years.

8. The respondent herein worked on casual basis only on two
WP (C) No. 21387/2005

Page 7 of 9

occasions for 27 days and 10 days.

It happened in the

years 1976 and 1980 respectively. In so far the claim of the
respondent that he worked from 1.12.1982 to 14.2.1983,
there is a dispute about that. Even if it is presumed that
the respondent is correct in his averment that from 1976 to
1983 i.e. over a period of seven years the petitioner worked
for about 3½ months in all. The respondent cannot claim
inclusion of his name in LCLR and further consequential
benefits having regard to the judgment of Constitution
Bench of Apex Court in the Secretary, State of Karnataka v.

Uma Devi, 2006 (4) SCALE 197.

9. We may point out that though Tribunal was influenced by
the fact that some of the juniors were included in LCLR,
neither any particulars are furnished by the respondent
giving the basis of his inclusion nor is there any discussion
about it in the impugned judgment.

On the contrary

petitioners have pointed out that on 11.2.1998 notice was
published in “Daily News Paper” inviting applications from
all such persons who had worked as casual labour and
those persons who applied their cases were considered and
among those who were found suitable were re-engaged.

10.Respondent missed the bus by not applying pursuant to
WP (C) No. 21387/2005

Page 8 of 9

the said public notice.

In case some of the persons who

were allegedly junior to the respondent were re-engaged in
the aforesaid circumstances, respondent cannot claim any
right on that basis. It is also not understood as to in what
manner the respondent who hardly worked at the best for
3½ months can claim the so-called seniority.

We,

therefore, allow this writ petition, set aside the impugned
judgment of the Tribunal and dismiss the OA filed by the
respondent before the Tribunal.
