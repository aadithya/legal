PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

The petitioners are aggrieved by an order passed by

the learned Civil Judge on 19.10.1995 permitting the plaintiffs
to withdraw the suit.
2.

Grievance of the petitioner who was impleaded as

defendant No.1 in the suit is that along with the suit which was
allowed to be withdrawn, the claim of the petitioner pertaining
to pressing his counter claim was rejected by the learned
Judge.
3.

Relevant facts need to be noted.

impleaded

as defendant.

4 persons were

Petitioner was impleaded

as

defendant No.1. A decree of permanent injunction was prayed
for.

Basis of the claim was that plaintiffs stated that their

father was a tenant in respect of the suit property under
defendants No.3 and 4 and that defendants No.1 and 2 were
threatening to dispossess them from the suit property.
5.

Defendant No.1 and 2 claimed a right in the

property based on inheritance as heirs of late Mohd.Azim.
6.

After obtaining an ex-parte injunction, plaintiffs

transferred

the

property

to

third

parties

and

stopped

appearing.

Defendants No.1 and 2 filed an application under

Order 6 Rule 17 CPC on 6.2.1994 praying that leave be granted
to them to amend the written statement and raise a counter
claim.

Amended written statement with counter claim was

filed. Decree of permanent injunction was prayed against the
plaintiff.

Requisite court fee was affixed on the proposed

amended written statement.
7.

I have perused the Trial Court record.

Proposed

amended written statement is at pages 229-243.

8.

On 28.5.1994 the learned Civil Judge recorded an

order which reads as under:“At the outset, I may mention that on 1.2.1994,
the plaintiff No.2 has made a statement in the
Court (for himself and on behalf of plaintiffs No.1
and 3 that he had sold the property in question
to someone in December 1993. .....................
An application under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC filed
by the defendants No.1 and 2 is also pending.
The plaintiffs were duly served with notice of the
same through son of Mohd. Fazil (plaintiff No.3).
............

9.

The suit was filed on 28.12.1992. After obtaining
ex-parte stay dated 28.12.1992 from the Court of
learned Additional District Judge, Delhi the
plaintiffs disposed of the suit property
somewhere in December 1993. It is quite queer
that after selling the property, the plaintiffs are
not caring to appear in the Court. ................”
Plaintiffs filed an application under Order 23 Rule 1

CPC which was allowed vide order dated 19.10.1995 holding
that the plaintiffs always have a right to withdraw their suit and
that the counter claim does not bear any Court fee.
10.

In the backdrop of facts afore-noted, suffice would it

be to state that neither party can steal a march over the other
by filing a suit, obtaining an ex-parte injunction and thereafter
selling the property and having obtained an unfair advantage
claiming that it does not want to litigate.
page 3 of 5

11.

Of course, a plaintiff is the dominus litus and can

choose his defendants and also whether he would like to
litigate, but where a counter claim is pending or a claim to urge
a counter claim is pending,

the Court has to independently

consider whether counter claim can continue. It is settled law
that a counter claim is akin to a plaint. It has to be registered
as a plaint.

Thus, while permitting the plaintiffs to withdraw

the suit learned Trial Judge could not have thrown to the
dustbin the claim of defendant No.1 to urge a counter claim.
12.

To that extent impugned order has to be set aside.

13.

The petition accordingly stands disposed of setting

aside the impugned order dated 9.10.1995 to the extent it has
dismissed the application filed by defendant No.1 and 2 under
Order 6 Rule 17 CPC praying that defendant No.1 and 2 should
be permitted to urge a counter claim.
14.
Judge.

Proceedings are revived before the learned Trial
Learned Trial Judge would decide the application for

amendment filed by defendant No.1 and 2 urging to raise a
counter claim. If the application is allowed the counter claim of
defendant No.1 would be registered as a suit.
15.

Needless to state, if the application is dismissed

necessary consequences shall flow.

16.

In either eventuality, further remedies as available

in law would be open to the parties.
17.

LCR be returned.

18.

No costs.
