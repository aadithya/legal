PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
The above captioned 3 petitions raise similar

questions of law and fact and hence are being decided by a
common order.
2.

CM(M) No.1384/2005 and CM(M) No.1412/2005 lay

challenge to identically worded orders, both dated 22.12.2004,
passed in two suits filed by the respondents.
3.

CM(M) No.2362/2005 lays a challenge to a similar

order but dated 4.5.2005.
4.

It is not in dispute that DDA was a defendant in all

the 3 suits and was proceeded against ex-parte on 30.7.1998
in suits which are the subject matter of CM(M) No.1384/2005
and CM(M) No.1412/2005. In the suit which is forming subject
matter of CM(M) No.2362/2005, DDA was proceeded against
ex-parte on 10.1.1996.
5.

In all the 3 suits, applications under Order 9 Rule 7

CPC were filed.

Averments in the applications are identical

save and except reference to the date when DDA was
proceeded against ex-parte.
6.

All applications were accompanied by applications

under Section 5 of the Limitation Act praying that delay in
seeking recall of the order directing that DDA would be

CM(M) No.1384/06

page 2 of 7

proceeded against ex-parte be recalled. The applicants have
suffered a dismissal.
7.

It was stated in the applications that a large number

of suits pertaining to village Kishan Garh were filed and were
assigned to different counsel.

It was stated that the instant

suit also related to village Kishan Garh. It was stated that land
in village Kishan Garh which was gaon sabha land, on
urbanization of the village, stood vested in the Central
Government and was placed at disposal of DDA for purposes of
Planned Development of Delhi. It was stated that noting that
development schemes were hampered due to court injunctions
meeting was held on 18.12.2002 and 19.12.2002 where
decision was taken that all matters should be entrusted to one
counsel. It was stated that thereafter files were requisitioned
from the counsel to whom suits were assigned and thereupon
inspections were carried out on 5.3.2003. It dawned on DDA
that in the instant 3 suits DDA had been proceeded against exparte.
8.

In a nut shell, sufficiency of cause entitling DDA to

have the delay condoned was negligence by the counsel to
whom suits were assigned in not informing DDA of the orders
passed in the suit.

Sufficiency of cause for non appearance

when DDA was directed to be proceeded against ex-parte was
CM(M) No.1384/06

page 3 of 7

explained with reference to negligence by the counsel.
9.

The applications have suffered a dismissal vide

impugned orders dated 22.12.2004 and 4.5.2005. The learned
Trial Judge has noted that it has become a tendency to shift
burden on the shoulders of the earlier counsel. Conduct of the
DDA has been commented upon adversely with reference to
lack of duty by officers of DDA in not maintaining contact with
the counsel and ascertaining the stage of the suit.
10.

As conventionally applied, pertaining to sufficiency

of a cause, approach of the learned Trial Judge appears to be
prima facie justified.

But, a deeper look reveals a hidden

infirmity in the approach of the learned Trial Judge.
11.

Where

the

litigating

party

is

a

State

or

its

instrumentality, nature of the dispute and resultant impact of
non suiting the State or its instrumentality has additionally to
be kept in mind.
12.

Public interest has also to be kept in mind.

13.

If large track of a land is placed at the disposal of a

developing agency which is in instrumentality of the State, if
small chunks of land are permitted to be lost due to
technicalities of law, the loss is not restricted to said lands but
extends to the entire development scheme which is under a
cloud.

Ultimately, public suffers as it is the ultimate

CM(M) No.1384/06

page 4 of 7

beneficiary of the scheme.
14.

Indeed, courts have been conscious of the fact that

sufficiency of a cause has to be liberally construed and
parameters thereof cannot be straight jacketed.
15.

No

doubt

law

assists

those

who

are

vigilant

(Vigilantibus non Dormeintibus Jura Subveninunt) and not
those who sleep over their nights but at the same time it
cannot be forgotten that to err is human is a practical notion of
human behaviour.
16.

It does happen, where large volume of litigation has

to be defended by a party, that miscommunication or lack of
communications result in a few cases left unattended.
17.

In the instant case the larger public interest

compels this court to condone the default of non appearance
when orders were passed in the 3 suits on 30.7.1998 and
10.1.1996 proceeding ex-parte against DDA.
18.

However, adequate costs have to be ensured to be

paid to the plaintiff of the suits for the inconvenience caused
on account of the fact that applications under Order 9 Rule 7
were filed after nearly 5 years of the default.
19.

I

thus

dispose

of

the

petitions

quashing

the

impugned order dated 22.12.2004 which is subject matter of
challenge in CM(M) No.1384/2005 & CM(M) No.1412/2005.
CM(M) No.1384/06

page 5 of 7

But, the same would be subject to payment of costs in sum of
Rs.15,000/- each to the plaintiffs of the two suits.
20.

On cost being paid within 8 weeks from today,

tender being by means of cheque in name of the respective
plaintiffs and posted to the plaintiffs at the address notified in
the memo of parties in the instant petitions, impugned orders
in said two petitions would be treated as having been set
aside. Applications filed by DDA under Order 9 Rule 7 seeking
recall of the order dated 22.12.2004 passed in the respective
suits would be allowed.

DDA would be permitted to join

proceedings at the stage they were when order(s) dated
30.7.1998 was passed in the two suits.
21.

As regards CM(M) No.2362/2005, same stands

disposed of directing that directions issued in para 19 and 20
above would apply to the suit filed by Ved Prakash. In that, on
necessary costs being paid to Ved Prakash impugned order
dated 4.5.2005 which is subject matter of said petition would
be set aside.

DDA's application under Order 9 Rule 7 CPC

would be allowed. Order dated 10.1.1996 directing DDA to be
proceeded against ex-parte would be treated as having been
set aside. DDA would be permitted to join proceedings at the
stage suit was as of 10.1.1996.
