1.

This is an application by the respondent under Section 17 B of

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 claiming arrears of back wages from the
date of award and wages month by month during the pendency of the
writ petition on the ground that the respondent no.1/applicant is
unemployed.

2.

The respondent No.1 had raised an industrial dispute against

the petitioner and respondent No.2, M/s.Archana Cinema Shopping
WPC No.1983/2006

Page 1 of 8

Centre Association, Greater Kailash.

The respondent

No.1 had

contended that he was appointed by the petitioner by an appointment
letter dated 7th July, 1986 and his services were later transferred
under an agreement to respondent No.2 which association was
headed by Shri Basant Kumar Binani, President of the association.

3.

In the claim petition, the respondent No.1 categorically asserted

that his services were terminated by the President of respondent No.2
on 28th October, 1998 without any notice and without payment of his
dues.

4.

The claim of the respondent No.1 was contested by petitioner

also, however, it was held that the respondent No.1 is liable to be
reinstated with full back wages by award dated 19th November, 2004.
The award was passed against the petitioner also as the petitioner
had been proceeded ex parte.

5.

This is no more res integra that Section 17 B is a benevolent

provision and passing orders directing payment of wages last drawn is
generally the rule whereas refusing to grant relief under Section 17 B
is an exception. An order under Section 17 B is declined in rare cases
of jurisdictional error where there is no relationship of employer and
employee between the parties.

Along with the

application, the appointment letter of the respondent No.1 has been
produced along with the minutes of the meeting dated 23rd December,
1986 between the petitioner and Archna Cinema Shopping Centre
Association, respondent No.2.

7.

Perusal of the record reveals that the alleged minutes between

the petitioner and respondent No.2 dated 23rd December, 1986 were
not produced before the Labour Court.

8.

The minutes of the meeting produced by the respondent No.1

itself negate his allegation that the petitioner is the proprietor of
respondent No.2.

The petitioner is a private limited company and

respondent No.2 is an Association. The fact that there was meeting
between the petitioner and respondent No.2 demonstrates that the
two are independent entities and the allegation that the petitioner is
the proprietor of respondent No.2 cannot be inferred in the facts and
circumstances.

9.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn my attention to

the statement of respondent No.1 before the Labour Court. The
respondent No.1 in his deposition filed on affidavit dated 24th April,
2001 categorically deposed that though he was appointed by the
WPC No.1983/2006

Page 3 of 8

petitioner on 7th July, 1986, however, his services were transferred
under an agreement to respondent No.2. It is also admitted by the
respondent No.1 that his services were terminated by respondent
No.2.

It has also been deposed by the respondent No.1 that after

transfer of management to respondent No.2, he was serving as a
Maintenance Officer with respondent No.2 with effect from 9th
January, 1987.

10.

The cross-examination of the respondent No.1 before the

Labour Court is quite revealing where he has admitted that the
respondent No.2 was sharing employer’s contribution after 1987 in
the provident fund account. He has also admitted categorically that
respondent No.2 is an Association and its members are the
shopkeepers of Archana Shopping Complex. It was also deposed that
respondent No.2 has his own President, Secretary, Executive Body
and Management. The respondent No.1/applicant also categorically
contended that petitioner is a company which is a private limited
company and he had ceased to be an employee of petitioner after 9th
January, 1987. The cross-examination of the respondent No.1 before
the Labour court is as under:“STATEMENT OF SHRI BALDEVA SINGH SON OF
KARTAR SINGH AGED 54 YEARS R/O B-I/23 A, VISHNU
GARDEN NEW DELHI-18.

By Shri A.K. Singla for Management.

It is wrong to say that I have concealed the quantum of
my salary from the Court by not mentioning the same in
any of my document. It is so mentioned in my Affidavit at
Para No.10 Ex WW 1/A. It is correct that I have placed
photocopies & no original document is on the record. I
have brought the original documents but since I have not
been asked to show the originals, I have not shown. Vide
Ex WW1/3 I mean the termination/retrenchment letter. I
have not brought the original of the same. It is not with
me. It is wrong to say that Ex WW 1/3 is not a
termination/retrenchment letter. This termination letter
was issued by the President of Respondent No.2. I have
no other letter like permanent placement letter separately
except my appointment letter Ex WW1/1. I was getting
the salary in cash. The salary in cash was paid to me by
the president of Respondent No.2 after 1987. It is correct
that in my PF Account, it was Respondent No.2 who was
sharing employer’s contribution after 1987. Respondent
No.2 is an Association and its members are the
shopkeepers of Archna Cinema Shopping Complex.
Respondent No.2 has his own President, Secretary,
Executive Body and management.
I know that
respondent No.1 is a company, which is a private limited
company. It is correct that after 9/1/1987 I ceased to be
an employee of management 1 and I became the employee
of management 2.”

11.

From the deposition of the respondent No.1, it is apparent and

clear that he himself has admitted that the petitioner is a private
limited company and respondent No.2 is an Association which are
distinct and different. In view of the categorical admission on the part
of respondent No.1, the allegation now made by respondent No.1 in
WPC No.1983/2006

Page 5 of 8

the application that the petitioner is the proprietor of respondent No.2
is not correct nor such inference can be drawn from any of the
documents produced by respondent No.1 before this Court.

The

respondent No.1 has also categorically admitted that even the
contribution for his provident fund is made by respondent No.2.

12.

The inevitable inference, in the facts and circumstances, is that

there is no prima facie relationship of employer and employee between
the petitioner and respondent No.1. In the circumstances, it is a rare
case where this court will not have any jurisdiction to pass an order
under Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 against the
petitioner as even according to the admissions made by the
respondent No.1, the employer is respondent No.2 and not the
petitioner.

13.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has also relied on 2001 (90)

FLR 67, Employer, The Management of Central Mine Planning and
Design Institute Limited vs. Union of India holding that refusing to
grant relief under Section 17 B is an exception. Merely because on
account of Section 17 B of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the High
Court has unfettered power and jurisdiction to pass an order under
Section 17 B, in case if prima facie it is established that there is no
relationship of employer and employee between the parties, the power
of the High Court to dismiss the application also cannot be taken
WPC No.1983/2006

Page 6 of 8

away. Section 17 B also does not impose such a liability on the High
court that under Article 226 of the Constitution of India such an order
has to be passed even if prima facie and even according to the
admissions made by the employees, it can be inferred that there is no
relationship of employer and employee.

14.

This cannot be disputed that in extreme cases where it is

demonstrated that the award passed is either without jurisdiction or
is otherwise a nullity, the court can decline to make an order in terms
of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The case of the
respondent No.1 is such in which he himself has admitted that
respondent No.2 is the employer. Respondent No.1 even categorically
admitted that the petitioner is a private limited company whereas
respondent No.2 is an Association. The allegation now made in the
application that petitioner is the proprietor of respondent No.2 is
without any basis as neither any document has been produced to
demonstrate this nor any such inference can be drawn from the
evidence led by the respondent No.1 before the Labour Court. In the
circumstances, there are no ground to pass an order under Section 17
B of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 in favour of respondent No.1 and
against the petitioner directing the petitioner to pay the last drawn
wages or the minimum wages whichever is higher or to continue to
pay the wages during the pendency of the present writ petition. The
application of the respondent No.1 under Section 17B of Industrial
WPC No.1983/2006

Disputes Act, 1947 is, therefore, without any merit and is liable to be
dismissed.
The application is, therefore, dismissed.
