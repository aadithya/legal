1.

The petitioner had sought for reliefs under Section 9 of the

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 by the present proceedings.
The following reliefs were claimed:-

“(a) pass ex-parte ad interim order injuncting
the respondent Nos.1,2,3 from operating,
conducting and withdrawing any amounts
from all the bank accounts standing in the
name of the Respondent No.1;
(b) pass ex-parte ad interim order injuncting
O.M.P. 185/2002

1 of 11

the Respondent No.1,2,3 from transferring,
disposing or creating any encumbrances,
liens, charges, third party interest or
otherwise
dealing
with
its
moveable,
immoveable and intellectual properties and
assets of the Respondent No.1 in their
possession or control,
(c)
pass an ex-parte ad interim order
injuncting Respondent Nos.2, 3 and 6 from
parting with, dealing with, disposing off,
transferring, encumbering or otherwise
alienating
any
of
the
funds
received/transferred
to
them
from
Respondent No.1 Company and/or from any
moveable or immovable assets acquired by
the Respondent Nos. 2, 3 and 6 with these
funds;
(d) pass an ex-parte ad interim order
directing Respondent Nos.2,3 and 6 to take
all such steps as are necessary to forthwith
recall and/or replenish all such funds/assets
and properties of Respondent No.1 as may
have been transferred from the Respondent
No.1 either to Respondent No.6 or to any
other Associate Company or to any of them
individually through the medium of such
Associate Companies or Affiliates;
(e) pass an ex-parte ad interim order
restraining Respondent Nos. 1,2 and 3 from
selling, licensing, alienating, parting or
otherwise dealing with any intellectual
property or technology relating to internet
access and convergence communications
developed by or belonging to or claimed to be
held by the Respondent No.1 Company or in
the control of Respondent Nos. 2 and 3;
(f)
pass an ex-parte ad interim order to
freeze all bank accounts of Respondent Nos.
2,3 and 6, their affiliates, persons connected
to them, their agents etc. to which monies
O.M.P. 185/2002

2 of 11

from Respondent No.1's accounts have been
transferred in violation of the Agreement and
Articles of Association of Respondent No.1
and further injunct all such persons from
dealing with any moveable or immovable
assets acquired by them from such monies of
the Respondent No.1 in their possession and
control; and
(g) pass such other or further orders as may
appear to the Hon'ble Court to be just and
convenient in the facts and circumstances of
the case to restore the Respondent No.1's
monies and assets that have or may in the
interim be siphoned out of the Respondent
No.1.
2.

This Court had, by its order dated 31.5.2002, restrained

the respondents through injunction in terms of prayers (a), (b) and (c).
After the above date, the proceedings continued to remain pending on
3.7.2002, since a submission was made on behalf of the respondent
No.6 that it was not a party to the arbitration agreement or
proceedings, and no orders could be made, the petitioner did not
press for continuation of the previous order dated 31.5.2002. Subject
to that, the interim order made on 31.5.2002 has subsisted.
3.

In the meanwhile, the parties went into arbitration, in

respect of the disputes raised.

By the award dated 3.9.2007, the

arbitral tribunal rendered findings in favour of the present petitioner.
The operative portion of the award reads as follows:-

“51. Operative Part of the Award:
In view of the above, the Arbitral
O.M.P. 185/2002

3 of 11

Tribunal makes the following Award:(a) The Respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 do pay
jointly and severally to the Claimant a sum of
Rs.46,000,018.40 (Rupees Forty Six Millions
and Eighteen and Paise Forty only) i.e. Intel
Capital Corporation along with interest at the
rate of 18% per annum from 23rd March 2001
onwards, interest on principal sum, pendente
lite, as well as further interest on
above-referred principal sum from the date of
the Award at the same rate till payment' plus
Rs.25,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Lac)
towards "costs awarded" to the Claimants;
(b) That in view of the Award for restitution of
status quo ante i.e. the award for return of
amounts with interest and costs in terms of
clause (a) hereof, Intel Capital Corporation
shall return 751880 equity shares of
Respondent No.1 held by it bearing Distinctive
Nos. 2344571 to 3096450 vide Share
Certificate No.68 dated 28th March 2001 to
Respondent No.1 within two weeks after
receipt
of the above-referred amounts as
directed in clause(a) hereof;
(c) Intel Capital Corporation shall deposit the
Share Certificates in respect of the said
shares in the Hon'ble Court if so directed;
(d) The Claimants shall retain the said Share
Certificates as and by way of security till the
Award is satisfied as directed;
(e) The Respondents Nos.1,2 and 3 are hereby
restrained from alienating, encumbering or
otherwise dealing with or creating any third
party rights in respect of the shares referred
to in Clause 2 of the Award until the amounts
awarded are first paid by Respondents Nos. 1,
2 and 3 to the Claimants as condition
precedent.
The Arbitral Tribunal hereby
clarifies that this provision is made in the
Award so as to secure the monetary claim of
O.M.P. 185/2002

4 of 11

the Claimants as awarded;
(f)
The Respondents Nos.1, 2 and 3 shall
not dispose of or encumber or otherwise deal
with any of its assets or create third party
rights therein until the awarded amount is
first paid to the Claimants herein;
(g) Messrs. Dua Associates shall be at liberty
to forward copy of this Award to the Registrar
of Companies having jurisdiction over the
Respondent No.1 and shall furnish necessary
information to all the statutory authorities in
respect of the Award made by the Arbitral
Tribunal herein.
We authorize M/s. Dua
Associates, Advocates for the Investors to
forward copy of this Award to the authorities
concerned;
(h) The Arbitral Tribunal is not issuing any
direction
to
Respondent
No.1
and/or
Respondent No.2 to purchase the shares of
Respondent No.1 held by the Claimants, that
is, Intel Capital Corporation, in terms of the
put option exercised by the Claimants under
Clause 32.2 of the Agreement by its purchase
notice on payment of Rs.59,992,505.20
(Rupees Fifty Nine Million Nine Hundred
Ninety Two Thousand Five Hundred and Five
Paise Twenty) or otherwise.
The Arbitral
Tribunal is of the view that an award directing
payment of the amounts mentioned in the
earlier clauses is adequate and sufficient for
rendering substantial justice and it is not
necessary for the Arbitral Tribunal to consider
claim of the Claimants for buy back of the
shares or for direction to Respondent No.1
and/or Respondent No.2 to repurchase the
said shares. Since the Claimants are seeking
restitution of amounts already paid to
Respondent No.1 with interest and costs and
also as compensation for breach of warranty
and we have accepted the said claims, we do
not consider it appropriate to award any claim
O.M.P. 185/2002

5 of 11

under this head although the breaches of
obligations set out in the Statement of Claim
are duly proved."
4.

Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the

respondent has challenged the award under Section 34 of the Act by
filing OMP No.35/2008, which is pending consideration on the file of
this Court.

He submitted that in view of the clear and categorical

findings in favour of the petitioner, it would be in the interest of
justice that the interim order made on 31.5.2002 is continued and
directed to bind the parties till the disposal of the said proceedings
under Section 34 of the Act.
5.

Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand,

submitted that the interim order is wider than the actual award. He
placed reliance on paragraphs 51(e) and 51(f) of the award to contend
that the respondents have been directed not to dispose of, nor to
encumber, or otherwise deal with any of its assets or create third
party rights until the awarded amount is first paid to the Claimants,
i.e. the present petitioners.

In the circumstances, the other reliefs

such as the ones described in clause 9 of the relief clause in the
petition, enjoining the respondents from withdrawing amounts from
the Bank Accounts, should not be granted.
6.

This Court has considered the submissions.

The Court

was, in the very first instance, persuaded from the materials on record
O.M.P. 185/2002

6 of 11

to grant an ex-parte ad-interim relief in terms of clause (a), (b) and (c)
of the petition. That interim order has continued and subsisted for
almost six years. The Arbitrators, after considering the materials on
record, rendered elaborate findings in a detailed award and found all
the issues in favour of the petitioner. It also appears from the award
that the respondents did not contest the proceedings by filing any
substantive pleadings.
7.

Section 9 of the Arbitration Act is cast in its wide terms. It

enables the party before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time
after the making of the arbitral award (but before it is enforced in
accordance with Section 36 of the Act) to approach the Court for
interim measures.

In this case, undeniably the interim order has

subsisted and continues to bind the parties even after the adjudication
on the merits took place. The award has rendered findings in favour
of the petitioner and against the defendant. Parliament has enabled
post-award interim measures (before enforceability of such awards) to
cater to contingencies where the decisions of arbitrators are not
rendered meaningless, by arming Courts with power under Section 9
(See Bhatia International vs. Bulk Trading S.A., 2002 (4) SCC
105). No doubt, exercise of such power should be based on application
of sound principles.

In the circumstances of this case, interests of

justice clearly lie in continuing the said interim order.

8.

Accordingly, the order dated 31.5.2002, as amended, is

confirmed and shall bind the parties till the disposal of the
proceedings challenging the award under Section 34 of the Act.

IA 11151/2002 (u/S.9 of Arb.Act & O.39 R.2A CPC)
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
IA 11151/2002 is an application under Order 39 Rule 2A
CPC seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against respondent
No.2 for violation of Court's order dated 31.5.2002. By the said order,
the Court had injuncted the respondents from inter alia, disposing of
the assets of the first respondent - Company or, in any manner,
operating the account of the said defendant No.1.
The

averments

in

this

application

disclose

that

withdrawals were made from Saving Bank Accounts No.8110 and
8112, opened by respondent No.2.

It was urged by the learned

counsel for the petitioner that having regard to the terms of the order
dated 31.5.2002, the respondents, who were duly served on 6.6.2002,
were bound to honour it and not withdraw amounts lying in their

O.M.P. 185/2002

8 of 11

accounts but belonging to their Company. It was also contended that
the findings of the arbtiral tribunal in this regard have been in favour
of the petitioner as the amounts, said to have been misappropriated or
siphoned by respondents No.2 and 3 from respondent No.1 were
traced and these included such amounts. The order dated 31.5.2002
had restrained the respondents in terms of prayers made in the
petition. The same reads as follows:-

“(a) pass ex-parte ad interim order injuncting
the respondent Nos.1,2,3 from operating,
conducting and withdrawing any amounts
from all the bank accounts standing in the
name of the Respondent No.1;
(b) pass ex-parte ad interim order injuncting
the Respondent No.1,2,3 from transferring,
disposing or creating any encumbrances,
liens, charges, third party interest or
otherwise
dealing
with
its
moveable,
immoveable and intellectual properties and
assets of the Respondent No.1 in their
possession or control,
(c)
pass an ex-parte ad interim order
injuncting Respondent Nos.2, 3 and 6 from
parting with, dealing with, disposing off,
transferring, encumbering or otherwise
alienating
any
of
the
funds
received/transferred
to
them
from
Respondent No.1 Company and/or from any
moveable or immovable assets acquired by
the Respondent Nos. 2, 3 and 6 with these
funds;
(d) pass an ex-parte ad interim order
directing Respondent Nos.2,3 and 6 to take
all such steps as are necessary to forthwith
recall and/or replenish all such funds/assets
O.M.P. 185/2002

9 of 11

and properties of Respondent No.1 as may
have been transferred from the Respondent
No.1 either to Respondent No.6 or to any
other Associate Company or to any of them
individually through the medium of such
Associate Companies or Affiliates;
(e) pass an ex-parte ad interim order
restraining Respondent Nos. 1,2 and 3 from
selling, licensing, alienating, parting or
otherwise dealing with any intellectual
property or technology relating to internet
access and convergence communications
developed by or belonging to or claimed to be
held by the Respondent No.1 Company or in
the control of Respondent Nos. 2 and 3;
(f)
pass an ex-parte ad interim order to
freeze all bank accounts of Respondent Nos.
2,3 and 6, their affiliates, persons connected
to them, their agents etc. to which monies
from Respondent No.1's accounts have been
transferred in violation of the Agreement and
Articles of Association of Respondent No.1
and further injunct all such persons from
dealing with any moveable or immovable
assets acquired by them from such monies of
the Respondent No.1 in their possession and
control; and
(g) pass such other or further orders as may
appear to the Hon'ble Court to be just and
convenient in the facts and circumstances of
the case to restore the Respondent No.1's
monies and assets that have or may in the
interim be siphoned out of the Respondent
No.1.
It is clear from the above that the respondents No.1, 2 and
3 were restrained from operating, conducting and withdrawing
amounts from any Bank account standing in the name of the

O.M.P. 185/2002

10 of 11

respondent No.1.

However, in this case, the amounts were

withdrawn, from the Saving Bank Accounts of respondent No.2. The
reliance placed by counsel for respondents, on the order of Court
dated 21.5.2003 is of no avail. The Court had directed evidence to be
led; however, the essential fact about withdrawal of sums of money
from the personal savings account of the respondent went unnoticed.
In the circumstances, this Court is of the view that no grounds to
proceed under Order 39 Rule 2A CPC has been made out.

Notice

discharged.
IA 11151/2002 is accordingly dismissed.
