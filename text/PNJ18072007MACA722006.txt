PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

The instant appeal is an illustration of what is being

currently reported in the press.

The menace on the public

roads in Delhi by private buses.
2.

Not a day passes when a person or two and

sometimes up to five are not run over each day by private
buses.

Page 1 of 13

3.

When a public interest litigation was filed in this

court and was listed before the Division Bench IV on 9.7.2007,
the very next day action was taken by the police and the State
Transport Authorities. A public scandal was revealed. 9 out of
10 buses on the roads of Delhi were not only without a valid
licence or a permit, even 60% were being plied by parties who
were not the registered owners of the buses. 60% of the buses
were found without the mandatory third party risk insurance
cover.
4.

Pen profile of the facts of the present case are that

on 11.12.1989, Jaspal, a young boy aged 11 years was in the
process of alighting from bus No. DEP 515 when suddenly the
driver accelerated the bus. Jaspal fell down and the rear left
wheel of the bus ran over his lower limbs.

Ex.PW-3/1, the

discharge summary from the hospital reveals that the young
boy remained hospitalized from 11.12.1989 till 5.1.1990.
5.
further

On 17.12.1990 he had to be re-hospitalized for
operation

and

was

discharged

on

25.12.1990.

Permanent damage was caused to the left femur and the left
tibia. He had to under go physiotherapy till the year 1993. He
suffered 70% permanent disability of the lower limb.

Total

compensation awarded to the young boy is Rs.70,000/- for pain

Page 2 of 13

and suffering. Rs.25,000/- towards medical expenses including
physiotherapy

and

conveyance

charges.

Rs.1

lac

for

permanent disability. The total sum awarded is Rs.1,95,000/-.
6.

Appellant, Bharat Bhushan was stated to be the

owner of the bus. Rambir was the driver of the bus.
7.

In the claim petition filed by Jaspal through his

father, Rambir was impleaded as respondent no.1. Appellant
was impleaded as respondent no.2. Both respondents in the
claim petition being served and absenting themselves when
claim petition was listed were proceeded against ex-parte.
After recording ex-parte evidence, learned Tribunal, noting the
injuries and the permanent disability of the injured passed and
awarded as aforenoted.
8.

The award was pronounced on 21.1.2003.

9.

Appellant nor the driver supplied any insurance

particulars to the police which had seized the bus after the
accident. The injured had no information about the insurance
particulars. Hence, no insurance company was impleaded as a
respondent in the claim petition.
10.

When award was sought to be executed against the

appellant he filed an application under Order 9 Rule 13 stated
as under:-

Page 3 of 13

“Respectively Showeth :1.
That the above titled executed petition seeking
execution of decree dated 21.1.2003 passed by
Hon'ble Ms. R.Kiran Nath the then Judge MACT. The
said decree was passed upon the claim filed by the
decree holder.
2.
The present applicant was never served with any
summons at any point of time nor he ever participated
in the said claim proceedings. Neither he knew about
the claim proceedings at any point of time. The
applicant has come to know about the passing of the
impugned decree recently only on 23.11.2005, when in
absence of applicant the court notice server came at
the house of the applicant. Applicant came back only
on 30.11.2005. Immediately thereafter the applicant
engaged a lawyer who after inspection of the court file
only on 7.12.2005 came to know about the passing of
the impugned decree against the applicant and one
Rambir.
3.
That the applicant have very good prima facie
case in his favour and there is every likelihood of
succeeding in the case and further now the applicant
has came to know that the calim is an out come of past
animosity and the applicant has nothing to do with the
alleged incident neither he is the owner nor in
possession of the vehicle in question at any point of
time. Hence in case the applicant will not be allowed
to participate in the proceedings and further the
decree is not set aside the applicant will suffer
irreparable loss and injury which will not be
compensated in any manner.
Prayer:It is therefore accordingly prayed that this
Hon'ble Court be pleased to set aside the ex-parte
decree dated 21.1.2003 and allow the applicant to
defend the claim in the interest of justice.”
11.

Vide order dated 28.1.2006 the application under
Page 4 of 13

Order 9 Rule 13 was dismissed.
12.

The appeal accordingly lays a challenge to not only

the ex-parte award dated 21.1.2003 but even the order dated
28.1.2006.
13.

Since the appeal is on law and facts and as I am

required to re-evaluate the evidence, I am, at the moment, not
noting reasons recorded by the learned Judge MACT while
dismissing application filed by the appellant under Order 9 Rule
13 CPC.
14.

At the hearing held on 12.7.2007, while reserving for

judgment, following order was passed:“Present: Mr.Hem C. Vashisht for appellant.
Ms.Neelam Gupta for R-1.
Ms.Iram Majid for Ms.Zubeida
Begum for GNCT of Delhi.
MAC. APP. No.72/2006
1.
It is inter alia urged that the
appellant was not served with the summons
in the claim petition and was wrongly
proceeded against ex-parte.
That order
dismissing the application filed under Order 9
Rule 13 CPC is contrary to law. That the
appellant was not the owner of the offending
vehicle. That there is no legal evidence to
sustain the finding that the appellant was the
owner of the offending vehicle. That the
supurdaginama was not proved in accordance
with law.
2.
However, I may note that learned
counsel for the appellant does not dispute
Page 5 of 13

that the appellant got the offending vehicle
released on superdari after executing the
requisite bond before the police authorities.

15.

3.
Arguments heard.
Reserved for
judgment.”
As noted in the order dated 12.7.2007,

contentions were urged.

5

The first two contentions, namely

whether learned Trial Judge was justified in proceeding exparte against the appellant and whether order dated 28.1.2006
is legal and valid need to be decided together inasmuch as
they emerge from the same set of facts.
16.

Trial Court record shows that the claim petition was

listed for the first time on 10.7.1990. Notice was issued to both
respondents i.e. appellant and the driver of the bus returnable
for 13.11.1990. Service had to be effected by ordinary process
as also by Regd. A.D.Post.
17.

A.D.Card at page 115 of the record of the Trial Court

reveals that the registered envelope containing the court notice
was duly received by the addressee at J-87, Kalka Ji, New Delhi,
the admitted residence of the appellant.

Likewise, the

A.D.Card at page 117 evidenced that Rambir, the driver of the
bus received the registered envelope containing the summons
at his address i.e. 154, Tilak Khandi Giri Nagar, Kalka Ji, New
Delhi.

Page 6 of 13

18.

Notice taken by the process server, available at

page 123 of the Trial Court record, bears the signatures of
Bharat Bhushan i.e. the appellant evidencing receipt of the
notice by appellant on 28.7.1990.
19.

Likewise, pertaining to the driver Rambir, process

server served him at his residence on 28.7.1990. The copy of
the notice acknowledging receipt by Rambir is at page 121 of
the record of the Trial Court.
20.

Order dated 13.11.1990 records personal presence

of respondent no.1. It records memo of appearance filed on
behalf of respondent no.2 and respondent no.3. The memo of
appearance has been filed by one Suman Bagga, Advocate and
is at page 109 of the record of the learned Trial Court.
21.

Unfortunately, the learned Judge MACT did not

realize that there was no respondent no.3 in the claim petition.
No insurance company was impleaded as a respondent.
22.

Be that as it may, order dated 13.11.1990 records

that time was granted to the respondents for filing a written
statement.
23.

Rambir engaged one D.K.Ahuja as his counsel who

filed a Vakalatnama which is at page 113 of the record of the
learned Trial Judge.

Page 7 of 13

24.

No written statement was filed. For unexplainable

reasons matter was repeatedly adjourned.

On 24.5.1993,

learned Judge MACT, probably realizing that something was
amiss, directed fresh service of the notice of the claim petition
upon

the

appellant

i.e.

respondent

no.2

returnable

for

7.10.1993.
25.

Notice issued for 7.10.1993 was not received back.

Fresh notice was issued returnable for 10.3.1994.

Even that

was not received back. Fresh notice was issued returnable for
12.10.1994.

Even that was not received back.

was issued returnable for 24.3.1995.
received back.

Fresh notice

Even that was not

Fresh notice was issued returnable for

2.8.1995. Fortunately, for said date, appellant i.e. respondent
no.2 was served by Regd. A.D.Post evidenced by the A.D.Card
at page 133 of the record of the learned Trial Judge.

The

A.D.Card

duly

shows that

the registered

envelope

was

delivered at J-87, Kalka Ji, New Delhi.
26.

Since none appeared for the appellant, vide order

dated 2.8.1995, recording service, matter was renotified for
4.1.1996 on which date there being no appearance on behalf of
the appellant, he was proceeded against ex-parte.
27.

Prima facie, no fault or any illegality can be alleged

Page 8 of 13

against the order dated 4.1.1996 proceeding ex-parte against
the appellant.
28.

I have noted hereinabove in para 10 the averments

made by the appellant in the application under Order 9 Rule 13
filed by him.
29.

Not a word has been spoken about or with respect to

the two A.D.Cards evidencing that the appellant was served
firstly for 13.11.1990 and for the second time for the date
2.8.1995.
30.

I concur with the view taken by the learned Tribunal

that the appellant not having explained or even offered an
explanation with respect to the two A.D.Cards, no case was
made out to recall the ex-parte decree for the reason appellant
failed to disclose a sufficient cause for non appearance when
the claim petition was listed after appellant was served.
31.

I may additionally note that the appellant has not

stated even a word about the service recorded by the process
server on the appellant on 28.7.1990. In this connection, I may
further note that a visual comparison of the signatures of he
appellant, which are his admitted signatures in the appeal,
corresponding with the signatures on the office copy of the
notice at page 123 of the record of the learned Trial Judge.

Page 9 of 13

32.

Thus, the first two contentions urged by the

appellant are rejected.
33.

The 3rd, 4th and 5th contention urged by learned

counsel for the appellant and as noted in para 1 of my order
dated 12.7.2007 could be disposed of together inasmuch as
they require appreciation of the same set of facts.
34.

But, at the outset, I may note that as recorded in

para 2 of my order dated 12.7.2007, counsel for the appellant
accepted that the appellant had got released on superdari the
offending bus after executing the requisite bond before the
police authorities.
35.

Case sought to be urged before me was that the

offending bus was actually owned by Mr. V.P.Mehta and that
the permit for operating the bus was in the name of V.P.Mehta.
36.

Record of the learned Tribunal shows that at page

85 of the record, photocopy of the superdarinama obtained
from the police was filed.
37.

The same records that the appellant, stating himself

to be the owner of the bus, got the same released with an
undertaking that he would produce the bus as and when
required.
38.

Learned counsel for the appellant did not dispute

Page 10 of 13

that the appellant moved an application with the local police
stated therein that he was the owner of the bus and that the
same may be released to him on superdari.
39.

Contention of learned counsel for the appellant that

the appellant should be permitted to prove that not he but
V.P.Mehta was the owner of the bus has to be repelled for the
reason estopple comes in the way of the appellant.
40.

Having represented to the police that he was the

owner of the bus and having got the same released on
superdari, appellant cannot be permitted to urge to the
contrary.
41.

Learned counsel for the appellant made a feeble

attempt to urge that by bribing the police, it is possible to
manage everything in Delhi. Counsel sought to urge that the
appellant may have acted improperly when he got the bus
released on superdari but that does not dis-entitle the
appellant to prove the truth.
42.

If appellant bribed the police and managed to take

delivery of the bus on superdari, he did by not only
representing that he owned the bus but by even bribing public
officers.

His conduct does not entitle him to get rid of the

consequences of the taint.

Page 11 of 13

43.

It is settled law that a trial before a claims tribunal

constituted under the MV Act 1988 is not akin to a civil suit. In
fact, the Tribunal has to hold an inquiry to determine the issues
raised on the pleadings of the parties.
44.

Standard of proof at a trial before the Tribunal is

much lower than the standard of proof envisaged even at a
civil trial.
45.

Photocopy

of

the

certified

copy

of

the

superdarinama filed by the claimant before the Tribunal is good
and sufficient evidence.
46.

I need not expand on the issue for the reason,

appellant

admitted

before

me

that

he

had

moved

an

application before the police authorities stating therein that he
was the owner of the bus and had got the same released on
superdari.
47.

Injured or claimants of deceased persons have no

means to find out as to who is the owner of the offending motor
vehicle other than the police authorities. Thus, where a person
informs the police that he is the owner of the vehicle, he invites
a claim against him by the injured or the claimants of the
deceased. The consequences of the misrepresentation made
by this person cannot be avoided by the person concerned.

Page 12 of 13

48.

Thus, looked at from any angle, appellant is the

creator of the situation and cannot shy away from the
consequences thereof.
49.

I was inclined to otherwise dismiss the petition on a

short count namely non compliance of Section 173 of the MV
Act 1988.
50.

The said provision enjoins upon the challenger of an

award to deposit Rs.25,000/- when appeal is filed against the
award. Appellant tendered, in the name of the Registrar of this
court, a cheque in sum of Rs.25,000/- dated 7.2.2006.

The

same was returned by the State Bank of Patiala i.e. banker on
which the cheque was issued with the remarks 'insufficient
funds'.
51.

The appellant has not bothered to replace the

cheque with a cash deposit.

No application has been filed

seeking extension of time or permission to do the needful.
52.

I find no merits in the appeal.

53.

The appeal is dismissed with cost of Rs.10,000/-.

54.

LCR be returned.
