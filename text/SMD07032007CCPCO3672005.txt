When the premises in question were not vacated by 31.3.2005,

the Petitioners filed the present contempt petition on 3.5.2005.
Notice was directed to issue on 5.5.2005.

4.

At the hearing on 2.2.2007, this Court was informed by the

Respondents that they had handed over the keys of the property to
the Court of Smt. Neena Krishna Bansal, the learned ADJ in an
execution case. The Court then directed the Respondents to explain
why the possession was not handed over to the Petitioner.

Court and not hand over the possession to the Petitioner herein.

The Respondents have with their affidavit enclosed the records

of the proceedings before the executing court, and in particular the

7.

It is seen from the above proceedings that on 31.1.2007 the

executing court recorded the statement of petitioner here to the effect
that he had “no objection to the handing over

of the keys by the

judgment debtors (respondents) in the Court till the disposal of the
objections by Shri Ramesh Chand Bhatia.”

Despite the aforesaid

proceedings having taken place before the executing court on
31.1.2007, this fact was not brought to the notice of this Court on
2.2.2007 by the counsel for the Petitioner.

8.

The Court fails to appreciate how the Petitioner could, after

filing the present contempt petition, filed a separate execution
application before the Trial Court and not bring that fact to the notice
of this Court. More importantly, the Petitioner never disclosed to this
Court the various proceedings

that were taking place in the said

execution proceedings. Those facts were brought on record only when
the Respondents herein filed a reply affidavit pursuant to this Court's
order dated 2.2.2007.

9.

Mr. Chawla, the learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that

merely because the order or decree is executable, that would not take
away this Court's jurisdiction under the Contempt of Courts Act,
1971 (`Act') as long as the Court were satisfied that there was a
violation of the order of this Court.

He places reliance on the

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rama Narang v. Ramesh
CONT.CAS(C) 367/2005

5 of 9

Narang 2006 IV AD (SC) 248. He also relies on the decisions in
Pearey Lal & Sons Pvt. Ltd. v. Dabur India Ltd. 2005 (81) DRJ 20
and Sarladevi v. Bharatkumar 1988 CRL. L.J. 558.

Mr. Chawla

points out that apart from the question of handing over possession,
the Petitioner has not paid any damages since 1.4.2005 till the date of
deposit of keys in the Trial Court. He also states that Respondents
have not withdrawn the intervention application filed by them in the
proceedings to which the Petitioner and Shri Ramesh Chand Bhatia
are parties.

10.

In reply, Mr. Shali, the learned counsel for the Respondents

points out that the Petitioner has suppressed the fact of filing of the
execution

and

Petitioner

that

having

opted

pursue

for

execution

simultaneously

the

contempt proceedings as well. He relies on the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Babu Ram Gupta v. Sudhir Bhasin AIR
1979 SC 1528, and the decisions in Northern Aromatics Ltd. v.

Shahzeb Khan 2006 (90) DRJ 23, Hindustan Motors Ltd. v.
Amritpal Singh Nayar 100(2002) DLT 278, D.S. Marketing Pvt.
Ltd. v. Syrus Marketing 128(2006) DLT 60, Alora Trading Co.
Ltd. v. Sanjay Ghai 98(2002) DLT 139 to contend that the inference
of wilful default in complying with an undertaking should not be
lightly inferred, and that the contempt power must be sparingly
exercised. He submits that contempt petition is not a substitute for
execution proceedings. Mr. Shali further refers to the fact that the
terms of compromise did not contemplate payment of damages
beyond 31.3.2005. As regards the withdrawal of the intervention
application, he refers to an application dated 23.3.2005 filed by the
Respondents seeking to withdraw their intervention application.

CONT.CAS(C) 367/2005

While he does not deny that no orders have been passed thereon, he
submits that as far as the Respondents are concerned, they have
complied

with

their

obligation

under

the

memorandum

of

understanding.

11.

While the law as laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Rama Narang v. Ramesh Narang is fairly well settled, the same
decision reiterates that the exercise of the power of contempt is a
matter

of

court's

discretion

having

regard

to

the

facts

and

circumstances of a case. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rama

Narang (supra) referred to the earlier decision in Babu Ram Gupta
(supra) where the Court had drawn, in the context of Section 2 (b) of
the Act, a distinction between a compromise arrived at between the
parties or a consent order passed by the Court at the instance of the
parties, and a clear and categorical undertaking given by any of the
parties.

12.

The decisions cited by counsel for the petitioner turn on their

own facts, and cannot straightway be applied to the instant case.
Here, after filing the present contempt petition, the Petitioner has
opted to file execution proceedings, and has not disclosed that fact to
this Court. He has participated in the execution proceedings and
further agreed to abide by the orders passed in those execution
proceedings. The statement made by the Petitioner before the
executing court on 31.1.2007 agreeing that the keys will remain
deposited with the executing court till the disposal by it of the
objections filed by Shri Ramesh Chand Bhatia, cannot be brushed
aside lightly since that is also a statement made by the Petitioner
before a court. It is, therefore, not open to the Petitioner to insist

CONT.CAS(C) 367/2005

7 of 9

that this Court should punish the Respondents for contempt of court
for not giving possession of the premises in question to the Petitioner
in terms of the memorandum of understanding which led to the order
dated 15.10.2004 passed by this Court in RFA No. 203/2004. As has
been held in the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the
respondents, the power to punish for contempt, cannot be exercised
lightly and must be sparingly used in the facts and circumstances of a
particular case.

The Respondents have not been avoiding the

execution proceedings, and they have in fact participated in those
proceedings and agreed to part with possession by depositing the
keys in the court. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the
Respondents have wilfully disobeyed the orders of this Court.

13.

As regards the condition concerning withdrawal of intervention

application, the Respondents are right in contending that by filing the
application on 23.3.2005 in the Court of the learned ADJ where the
suit between Shri Ramesh Chand Bhatia and the Petitioner is pending,
they have discharged that obligation.

As regards the payment of

damages beyond 31.3.2005, there is no clause in the memorandum of
understanding that requires the payment of such damages.

It is,

however, always open to the Petitioner to seek to recover such
damages, if so permissible, in accordance with law.

14.

For all of the above reasons, this Court is of the considered view

that no case for interference by way of contempt proceedings is made
out by the Petitioner. Accordingly the contempt petition is dismissed
with no orders as to costs. It is made clear that this order will not
come in the way of the Petitioner proceeding with the execution
proceedings pending before the Trial Court.
