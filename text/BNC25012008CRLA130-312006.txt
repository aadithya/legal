Mohd. Ikrar, father of

missing child eventually reported the matter to the
police.

Initially a DD No.40 B (Ext. PW 9/A) was

recorded on 15th September, 2001. On the following
day i.e. 16th September, 2001

on child remaining

untraced, a FIR under Section 363 IPC vide Ex. PW
3/A was registered at PS Gokalpuri, Delhi. Initially,
on 15th September, 2001 a blank call was received at
the house of the child on telephone No.2263029.
Later, it was followed by a ransom call for Rs.5 lacs
which was subsequently brought down to Rs.3 lacs
on father of child pleading his inability to satisfy the
ransom demand of Rs.5 lacs. The factum of receiving
ransom calls on his telephone was brought by the

The
under

Mohd. Ikrar was, in

terms of the ransom call received on 17th September,
2001, asked to reach on 18th September, 2001 at an
appointed place in Gajrola, U.P. at a given time with
ransom money for payment thereof in return of
release of the kidnapped child.

Mohd. Ikrar,

accompanied by a raiding party, comprising

police

officials, acted accordingly. Nobody, however turned
up from the side of kidnapper/s. A similar ransom
call was received by Mohd. Ikrar on his telephone on
19th September, 2001 morning with instructions to
reach a different place in Gajrola at the given time,
for delivery of ransom money which

he complied

with in the same manner as on previous occasion
but again there was no positive development. Yet
again on 20th September, 2001 pursuant to another
phone call, Mohd. Ikrar and the police party reached
the appointed place at the given time where a person

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

Page 3 of 18

was to get in touch with Mohd. Ikrar to take him to
the kidnapper/s for payment of ransom

money

before release of his child from captivity. A person
did approach Mohd. Ikrar but somehow seeing that
person, he (Ikrar) got frightened and started crying
which attracted the attention of the police officials,
and they emerged from hiding in the fields.

On

noticing the presence of the police officials in the
nearby fields the person who was to take Mohd. Ikrar
to the kidnapper/s took to heels and disappeared in
sugarcane fields.

The police officials

resorted to

combing operation with a view to apprehend that
person and in the process they heard the cries of a
child which led them to a garden where they came
across

with the kidnapped child.

The child was

thus recovered.
3.

On questioning

the child regarding

his

kidnapper/s Izhar disclosed the name of appellant
Rafiq as the one who had taken him along and
handed over to his co-appellant Hasmukh @ Hasmat

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

Page 4 of 18

who in turn took him away to a village in Gajrola
where he was kept in a house. The police on the
basis of

lead provided by the child located the

particular house in the village which happened to be
that of one Tehsin, who, on a joint trial with the
appellants, stands

acquitted by the learned trial

court. On 21st September, 2001 on a visit with the
police to the house of

appellant Rafiq, the child

noticed a photograph of appellant Hasmukh @
Hasmat lying there and he was able to identify him in
that photograph as the one who had taken over his
custody from co-appellant Rafiq after his kidnapping.
Both the

appellants as well as

Tehsin and one

Akhtar were eventually arrested.
4.

Conviction of the appellants on the charge of
kidnapping for ransom is primarily based on the
statement of Mohd. Izhar the kidnapped child
supported by the testimony of his father

PW-4

and

including

the

Investigating Officer who were members of the

Page 5 of 18

raiding party at the time of recovery of the child from
a garden. Learned counsel for the appellants argued
that the conviction of the appellants is solely based
on the statement of the kidnapped child and that
there being no corroboration to his statement the
impugned

conviction

and

sentence

cannot

be

sustained and are liable to be set aside. In support
of his plea in this regard he referred to a decision of
the Supreme Court

in Bhagwan Singh & Ors. vs.

State of M.P.; 2003 Crl. L.J. 1262. It was further
contended that in the absence of any evidence
regarding threat to the life or body of the kidnapped
child, in the event of ransom money being not paid,
Section 364 A IPC could not be held attracted and
the learned trial court was thus not justified in
recording the finding of conviction in relation to the
appellants under Section 364 A IPC and sentencing
him therefor.

It was further argued that appellant

Hasmukh @ Hasmat owed an amount of Rs.7,000/to Mohd. Ikrar, father of the kidnapped child, which

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

Page 6 of 18

he could not repay and that it was on that account
that

he

was,

alongwith

his

brother

co-

appellant, falsely implicated in the present case.
5.

Ms. Fizani Hussain, learned Addl. P.P. on the
other hand contended that as far as involvement of
the appellants in kidnapping of Mohd. Izhar is
concerned only kidnapped child, could have been in
a position to testify in that regard and
corroboration in that respect could be

no

expected

unless there was someone who could claim to have

child being

with them.

She at the

same time sought to contend that there is sufficient
evidence to prove that Mohd. Izhar was kidnapped
by appellant Rafiq and that the child was recovered
by the police from a garden and he had immediately,
on being asked in that regard, disclosed the name of
appellant Rafiq, who had taken him away before
handing

him

over

to

Hasmukh @ Hasmat.

his

brother

co-appellant

Countering the plea of false

implication, learned Addl. P.P. argued that

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

where

Page 7 of 18

appellant Hasmukh @ Hasmat owed an amount of
Rs.7,000/- to the father of the child and failed to
repay the same a false implication in the case would
rather

foreclose the prospect of the amount being

realized.
6.

We have heard Mr. Ashwini Bhardwaj, Adv.
for the appellants as also Ms. Fizani Hussain,
learned Addl. P.P. for State.

7.

From the evidence on record it is clearly
proved that on 14th September, 2001 at about 7.30
pm Mohd. Izhar, a six and half year old child went
out of his house but did not return. The factum of
his disappearance came to the notice of the father of
the kidnapped, child around 8.30 pm. All concerned
kept on searching for

the missing child and on

failing

to trace him, Mohd. Ikrar lodged a missing

report

with the police which was recorded as DD

father of the child expressing suspicion of his child
being kidnapped, a FIR vide Ext. PW 3/A under
Section 363 IPC was registered.

Various ransom

calls as testified by Mohd. Ikrar, PW-4 for release of
the child were received by him on his phone between
16th of September, 2001 and 20th September, 2001
which he kept on bringing to the notice of the police.
According to prosecution these ransom calls were
made by one Tehsin from a STD booth at Gajrola.
Ikramuddin, the booth owner examined as PW-1
though confirmed that certain calls were made from
his telephone booth on the phone No.011-2263029,
which happened to be land line phone number of
Mohd. Ikrar,

he did not support the prosecution

case that these calls were made by said Tehsin, his
neighbour.

Ext. PW 1/A produced by Ikramuddin,

PW-1 carries the details of calls made from his booth
to Mohd. Ikrar's phone number. Thus even though it
is proved that some phone calls were made to Mohd.

the prosecution fails to

the identity of the person making those

calls.
8.

Recovery of the child from a garden on 20th
September, 2001 during combing operation is also
established in view of

statements of Mohd. Ikrar,

PW-4 and police officials constituting the raiding
party, in addition to

the statement of kidnapped

child himself. From the date of his kidnapping on
the evening of 14th September, 2001 and before his
recovery from the garden, the place or places where
the kidnapped child was

held captive is/are not

ascertainable for lack of evidence in that regard.

As

far as appellant Rafiq is concerned, he being related
to the father of the child and having stayed at his
house for sometime in the past he was well known to
the child prior to the date of his kidnapping. The
statements of Mohd. Ikrar, PW-4 and Investigating
Officer to the

effect that

immediately after his

recovery from the garden the child had clearly named

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

Page 10 of 18

appellant Rafiq as the one who had taken him away,
leave no scope for any doubt in regard to his
involvement in kidnapping the child, Mohd. Izhar.
As far as co-appellant Hasmukh @ Hasmat is
concerned the child had known him by the name of
Sardar and it was on 21st September, 2001 when the
police went to his house in search of co-appellant
Rafiq and the

child had an occasion to look at

Hasmukh's photograph lying in his house that he
was able to identify him to be the same person who
was being named by him as Sardar.
9.

After

his kidnapping by appellant Rafiq,

states Izhar, he was handed over to his co-appellant
Hasmukh, who had taken him along and kept in
captivity until his recovery by the police

from the

garden. Even on the day of his recovery, apart from
appellant Rafiq, his co-appellant Hasmukh was also
present in the garden with the child and both of
them had run away on noticing

the presence of

police there. The child thus continued to be kept in

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

Page 11 of 18

confinement from the date of his kidnapping upto
20th September, 2001 when he
recovered from the garden.

was eventually

The child stayed in

captivity for a sufficient time to be able to correctly
identify appellant Hasmukh, which he did before the
court in the course of making of his statement. The
identity of both the appellants and their involvement
in kidnapping of the child thus stand clearly proved
beyond doubt.

No doubt the

testimony of child

witness needs to be evaluated carefully before
accepting the same and it is not prudent to act upon
his

sole

testimony

without

other

corroborative

evidence, in the case of kidnapping where there is
no witness to such kidnapping no corroborative
evidence regarding identity of the kidnappers is to
be insisted upon if the statement of the kidnapped
child is otherwise creditworthy and he is found to be
in a position to clearly identify his kidnappers
without mistake.

Leaving

apart child's statement

related to period of his being held in captivity the fact

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

Page 12 of 18

that he was kidnapped on the evening of 14th
September, 2001 and went missing thereafter until
his recovery from the garden on 20th September,
2001 and that he had immediately named appellant
Rafiq in the presence of police officials and his father
as the one who had kidnapped him, stand proved
from the testimony

of other witnesses including

father of the child. Nature of statement made by the
child before the court gives no impression of his
statement suffering from

the vice

of tutoring.

Bhagwan Singh's case (supra) cited by

learned

counsel for the appellants was one involving

a

different set of facts where the statement of the
child witness per se lacked conviction and required
corroboration

for

conviction against the accused.

for

recording

The learned trial

court keeping in mind the law laid down by Supreme
Court in Ratansinh Dalsukhai Nayak Vs. State of
Gujrat; 2003 IX AD (SC) 113, on examining the
statement of Izhar accepted the

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

same as truthful

Page 13 of 18

account of the incident. In the said case relied upon
by the learned trial court it was ruled :
“......The evidence of a child witness is
not required to be rejected per se, but
the court as a rule of prudence
considers
such evidence with close
scrutiny and only on being convinced
about the quality thereof and reliability
can record conviction, based thereon.”
Thus insistence for corroborative evidence to
a child's testimony is not an invariable rule to be
applied

in all eventualities irrespective of facts and

circumstances of a given case. On close scrutiny of
the statement of the child, Izhar PW-2 in regard to
identity of the appellants, there is no reason

not to

accept the same as a basis to convict them for his
kidnapping.

Defence

plea

that as the appellant

Hasmukh was unable to repay the amount he owed
to the

father of the child he alongwith his co-

appellant Rafiq was got falsely implicated in the case
has no basis to find acceptability.
10.

Another submission made on behalf of the

appellant was that no threat to cause death or hurt

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

Page 14 of 18

to the kidnapped child had been extended nor the
appellants by their conduct gave rise to a reasonable
apprehension that the kidnapped child could be put
to death or hurt, to make Mohd. Ikrar to pay ransom,
conviction and sentencing of the appellants under
Section 364 A IPC cannot be sustained.

An

argument in this respect was advanced before the
learned trial court also but the same

was held

unacceptable. In this context it may be noticed that
though there is evidence of ransom calls being
received by the father of the kidnapped child on his
phone, the identity of the person making
ransom calls could not be proved.
mere

such

That apart, a

demand of ransom amount for release of a

kidnapped

person,

is

not

sufficient

to

attract

application of Section 364 A IPC unless it is also
proved that the kidnapped person was threatened
with death or hurt or that the conduct of the
kidnappers was such which could raise a reasonable
apprehension that he could be put to death or hurt if

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

Page 15 of 18

the

ransom amount was not paid.

In the present

case the child did not state that the appellants had
at any point of time threatened to cause his death or
hurt. Even the father of the child at no place in his
statement testifies that the person making ransom
calls had on any occasion threatened to kill the
kidnapped child or cause hurt to him.

The

appellants at no stage by their conduct gave rise to
a reasonable apprehension to the father or any
member of his family that in the event of ransom
amount being not paid, the kidnapped child would
be put to death or hurt. The learned trial court in
the impugned judgment while finding that the
appellants from their conduct gave rise to reasonable
apprehension that the kidnapped child would be put
to death or hurt, did not spell out their particular
conduct

which

could

have

given

rise

to

the

reasonable apprehension as aforesaid. There being
total absence of evidence in regard to any threat to
cause death or hurt to the kidnapped child and also

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

Page 16 of 18

for lack of evidence in regard to the appellants
conducting themselves in a way that could give rise
to a reasonable apprehension that the child would be

death

or

simplicitor could not have brought the offence within
the ambit of Section 364 A IPC.
11.

Learned counsel for the

appellants pleaded

that even if the appellants are held guilty for
kidnapping

of the child they are liable to be

convicted and punished under Section 363 IPC only.
12.

It

is to be

noticed

that according to

prosecution case the kidnapping of the child was for
ransom.
covered

Now since the case is found to be not
under Section 364 A IPC and Section 365

IPC has no application as the kidnapping was not
committed with an intent to secretly and wrongfully
confine the child, the case would fall under Section
363 IPC only. Interestingly, the learned trial court
convicted

and sentenced

the appellants

under

Section 364 A IPC as also under Section 363 IPC.

Crl. Appeal No.130-31/2006

Page 17 of 18

Simultaneous conviction under both the provisions
was unwarranted. Anyway now, since the conviction
and sentence under Section 364 A IPC is found
unsustainable and is thus liable to be set aside,
maintaining the conviction under Section 363 IPC,
each appellant is sentenced to 7 years RI and a fine
of Rs.5,000/- in default

of payment

of fine SI for

one year. The conviction and sentence under Section
364 A IPC shall stand set aside.
13.

The appeal is

accordingly allowed partly to

the aforesaid extent.
