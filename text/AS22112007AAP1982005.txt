ARUNA SURESH, J.
1. Petitioner has filed the present petition under Section 11
(6) & 11(8)(B) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
(hereinafter referred to as 'Act') for appointment of an
arbitrator by the Court. Petitioner was awarded work by
the respondent Union of India, Ministry of Railways, vide

AA No. 198/2005

letter/contract dated 97/TK-II/MPW/1 dated 29.1.1997 for
supply of Sal Wood Sleepers. A dispute arose inter se the
parties regarding the payment claimed by the petitioner for
supply of wooden sleepers.

Petitioner, therefore, sent a

legal notice dated 11.7.2005 to the respondent invoking
Clause

2900(a)

of

the

Indian

Railways

Standard

(hereinafter referred to as 'IRS') condition of contract to
appoint an independent person as a sole arbitrator
unconnected with the respondent preferably or retired
Judge of any Hon'ble High Court or the Supreme Court to
resolve the dispute and differences. The said legal notice
was duly received by the respondent on or before
14.7.2005. However, the respondent failed to appoint the
arbitrator within thirty days from the date of receipt of the
notice. Hence the present petition.

2. Respondent in its reply denied the existence of any
arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties
and it is pleaded that clause 2900 (a) of the IRS condition
of contract is not a part of the contract dated 29.1.1997. It
is further alleged in the reply that as per the said clause in
case any dispute arises in the contract a Gazetted Railway
Officer only should be appointed by the competent
authority as sole arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute and in

AA No. 198/2005

Page 2 of 17

case of contract entered into by Zonal Railway, General
Manager of the concerned Zonal Railway appoints the sole
arbitrator and in case of Board's contract, Railway Board
(concerned Member) appoints the sole arbitrator and
therefore, on the demand of the petitioner for appointment
of an arbitrator unconnected with the Govt. of India or
preferably a retired Judge which is contrary to the
provisions of clause 2900(a) of IRS conditions of contract,
no arbitrator of the petitioner could have been appointed
by the respondent.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that IRS
conditions of contract is a part of the contract letter dated
29.1.1997 and the petitioner was asked to furnish surety in
the shape of bank guarantee in terms of clause 0501 of the
IRS conditions of contract in the meeting held on 6.5.1997
in the Chamber of the Chief Engineer and Deputy Chief
Engineer

which

was

representative as well.

by

the

petitioner's

Therefore, IRS conditions of

contract which contained clause 2900(a) i.e. arbitration
agreement is enforceable by the petitioner as the parties
had entered into contract for work in terms of IRS
conditions of contract. It is, therefore, submitted that since
the respondent has failed to appoint an arbitrator after

rightly
of

the

Arbitration and Conciliation Act seeking appointment of an
arbitrator by the Court.

4. Learned counsel for the respondent has refuted these
submissions and has alleged that there is no arbitration
agreement inter se the parties. The terms contained in the
IRS conditions of contract are not applicable to the
contract which was executed between the parties vide
letter dated 29.1.1997.

Therefore, since there is no

arbitration agreement, petition is liable to be dismissed.

5. To appreciate the submissions of the parties, it is necessary
to look into the terms and conditions of the contract letter
dated 29.1.1997 and also minutes of the meeting dated
6.5.1997.

6. Letter dated 27.1.1997 is written by the respondent to the
petitioner vide which respondent indicated its intention to
place an order on the petitioner for supply of Sal Wood

any, will have to be borne by you.
(23) You are also required to
submit monthly progress report to
the Railways on the proforma laid
down by the Ministry of Railways
(Railway Board).”
7. Perusal of this contract letter makes it very clear that
parties never agreed to invoke clause 2900(a) namely
arbitration clause of IRS conditions of contract in case
dispute arose between them in terms of or connected with
the contract letter.

8. After the contract was concluded between the parties, a coordination meeting was held on 6.5.1997 which was in the
chamber of Chief Engineer (West), Calcutta. This meeting
was attended by Mr. A.M. Gokhle, Deputy Manager of the
petitioner. Clause 15 of the minutes of meeting is relevant
for the purposes of the present petition and it reads as
follows:

“As per Indian Railway
standard condition of contract and
as in practice the supplier has to
deposit with FA & CRO SL/S.E.
Rly/GRC Rs. One lakh in cash or
approved banker's guarantee bond
as a security.”

9. Thus, it is clear that respondent invoked its general
AA No. 198/2005

Page 9 of 17

practice

when

it

asked

the

petitioner

to

furnish

security/bank guarantee for a sum of Rs. 1 lac. Even if the
argument of the petitioner is accepted that it was asked to
furnish the bank guarantee/security in terms of clause
0501 of the IRS conditions of contract even then it cannot
be accepted that because it was asked to furnish bank
guarantee or security in terms of that clause the entire
terms and conditions of IRS conditions of contract became
part of the contract letter dated 29.1.1997.

This only

indicates that parties agreed to invoke clause 2900(a)
pertaining to the security furnished by the petitioner.
There is no reference of clause 2900(a) of IRS conditions of
contract either in the contract letter or in the minutes of
the meeting dated 6.5.1997. Therefore, submissions of the
learned counsel for the petitioner that by virtue of the said
decision in the meeting asking it to furnish the bank
guarantee attracts all the clauses of the IRS conditions of
contract including the arbitration clause 2900(a) are
without any merits and are not acceptable.

10.Bank guarantee therefore was asked to be furnished by
the petitioner as per IRS conditions of contract and as per
practice. Clause 15 of the minutes of the meeting does not
make IRS conditions of contract in particular clause 2900

AA No. 198/2005

Page 10 of 17

(a) automatically operative and binding inter se the parties
unless there is a specific contract to the effect that parties
shall be bound by particular terms or clauses contained in
the said IRS conditions of contract. Clause 0501 of the IRS
conditions of the contract is severable from the other terms
and conditions contained therein.

Undisputedly, the

parties are not bound by other clauses of the IRS
conditions of contract.

11.Arbitration agreement has been defined in Section 7,
Chapter II of the Act, 1996. It reads as follows:

“7. Arbitration Agreement.-(1) In this Part, “arbitration
agreement” means an agreement
by the parties to submit to
arbitration all or certain disputes
which have arisen or which may
arise between them in respect of a
defined legal relationship, whether
contractual or not.
(2) An arbitration agreement
may be in the form of an
arbitration clause in a contract or
in the form of a separate
agreement.
(3) An arbitration agreement
shall be in writing.
(4) An arbitration agreement
is in writing if it is contained in-(a) a document signed by the
parties;
(b) an exchange of letters,
telex, telgrams or other means of
telecommunication which provide
a record of the agreement; or
AA No. 198/2005

Page 11 of 17

(c)
an
exchange
of
statements of claim and defence in
which the existence of the
agreement is alleged by one party
and not denied by the other.
(5) The reference in a
contract to a document containing
an arbitration clause constitutes
an arbitration agreement if the
contract is in writing and the
reference is such as to make that
arbitration clause part of the
contract.”
12.Thus, to invoke the provisions of Arbitration Act, there has
to be a valid subsisting agreement between the parties
within the meaning of Section 7 of the Act.

Arbitration

agreement is an agreement whereby parties agree to
submit to arbitration their disputes which have arisen or
are subsisting or which may arise between them in respect
of a legal relationship whether contractual or not.
arbitration agreement has to be in writing.

This

It can form

part of a contract or there can be a separate arbitration
agreement.

A document can be considered as an

arbitration agreement if it is signed by both the parties or
if there is an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other
means of telecommunication which provided record of the
agreement. An exchange of claim and defence where one
party alleges existence of an arbitration agreement and the
other party does not deny it also forms an arbitration
agreement.

If there is an reference in a contract to a

AA No. 198/2005

Page 12 of 17

document containing an arbitration clause will constitute
an arbitration agreement in case the contract is in writing
and the reference of such a nature has to make that
arbitration clause part of the contract.

13.In the present case there is no reference of clause 2900(a)
of the IRS conditions of contract in the letter of contract
dated 29.1.1997. Therefore, it cannot be said that there is
an arbitration agreement inter se the parties for referring
the dispute to the sole arbitrator which may arise in the
contract or to the execution of the terms and conditions of
the contract.

14.Since the existence of the arbitration agreement inter se
the parties is not established on the record petitioner is not
entitled to invoke the provisions of Section 11(6) and (8)
(B) of the Act.

15.Vide letter dated 11.7.2005, petitioner called upon the
respondent to appoint an arbitrator invoking clause 2900
(a) of the IRS conditions of contract and asked for
appointment of an arbitrator who should be an independent
person unconnected with the Govt. of India or preferably
should be a retired Judge of any Hon'ble High Court or

AA No. 198/2005

Page 13 of 17

Supreme Court of India. Even if it is deemed that there is
an arbitration agreement in the form of clause 2900(a) of
the IRS conditions of contract in existence between the
parties,

its proper enforcement by way of legal notice

dated 11.7.2005 is disputed. Under clause 2900(a) of IRS
conditions of contract in the event of any question, dispute
or difference arising under these conditions or any special
conditions of contract or in connection with the IRS
conditions of contract, the same shall be referred to the
sole arbitration of a Gazetted Railway Officer appointed to
be the arbitrator, by the General Manager in the case of
contracts

entered

into

by

the

Zonal

Railways

and

Production Units by any Member of organisation in respect
of contracts entered into by the other organisation under
the Ministry of Railways.

16.Petitioner did not invoke this clause in its strict terms.
Rather it called upon the respondent to appoint an
arbitrator

who

should

be

an

independent

person

unconnected with the Govt. of India preferably or a retired
Judge of any High Court or of the Supreme Court of India.
This claim of the petitioner is beyond the scope of the
arbitration

agreement

contained in

clause

2900

(a).

Therefore, the respondent has rightly refuted and denied

AA No. 198/2005

Page 14 of 17

the claim of the petitioner for appointment of an arbitrator
in terms of clause 2900 (a).

17.In para (6) of the reply respondent has avered that since
the petitioner had given its consent for appointment of an
arbitrator in terms of clause 2900(a) of IRS conditions of
contract as such only Gazetted Railway Officer is qualified
for the appointment and not one who is unconnected with
the Government of India as requested in the notice.

In

para 7 (L) of the reply the respondent did agree to consider
appointment of a sole arbitrator as per provisions of clause
2900(a) of IRS conditions of contract if the petitioner
enters into an agreement to abide by the provisions of the
said clause without any additional condition.

Thus, even

the notice dated 11.7.2005 served upon the respondent on
or about 14.7.2005 cannot be treated as a valid notice
calling upon the respondent to invoke clause 2900(a) and
appoint sole arbitrator because the petitioner put its own
terms and conditions regarding the person who should be
appointed as the sole arbitrator in utter disregard to the
terms contained in the said clause.

18.Learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to Shin

Satellite Public Co. Ltd. v. Jain Studios Ltd. - (2006) 2

AA No. 198/2005

Page 15 of 17

SCC 628.

In the said case a question arose as to the

validity of the agreement and the Court applied the
doctrine of severability and held that part of the arbitration
clause was invalid and the objectionable part regarding the
benevorous of the award and not to be challenged in any
court of law was ordered to be deleted and the part of the
agreement for reference of the disputes to arbitrator was
accepted as valid and was made enforceable.

Therefore,

this judgment is of no help to the petitioner.

19.Punj Lloyed Ltd. v. Petronet MHB Ltd. - (2006) 2

SCC 638 referred to by the learned counsel for the
petitioner is again of no consequence to the facts and
circumstances of this case as in this case that there was
never any arbitration agreement executed inter se the
parties.

20.Reliance is also placed on Dattar Switchgears Ltd. v.

Tata Finance Ltd. & Anr. - 2000(8) SCC 151.

This

judgment

and

is

also

not

applicable

to

the

facts

circumstances of this case as it was held that as the
petitioner had the right to invoke the provisions of Section
11(6) in case the respondent after receipt of the notice did
not appoint an arbitrator but if an arbitrator was appointed

AA No. 198/2005

Page 16 of 17

by the respondent before filing of this petition the said
appointment is valid.
different in nature.

The facts before this Court are
Here the existence of arbitration

agreement itself is disputed.

21.Similarly, Union of India & Anr v. M.P.Gupta - 2004

(10) SCC 504, Gurdeep Singh v. NDMC – 2007 (137)
DLT and HBHL-VKS (JV) v. Union of India & Ors. 2007 (1) ALR 252 (Delhi) have no bearing on the facts
and circumstances of this case as in all these cases the
existence of arbitration agreement was admitted.

22.To conclude, there is no valid and legal subsisting
arbitration agreement inter se the parties and therefore,
present petition is not maintainable.

23.Hence as observed above, I find no merits in the present
petition. Same is accordingly dismissed.
