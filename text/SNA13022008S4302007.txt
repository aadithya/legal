Briefly stated the facts of the case are as follow:The plaintiff and the defendant are real sister and brother. The

dispute between them is to the succession to property bearing
No.80, Paschimi Marg, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi which admittedly
belonged to late Shri T. Sivashanker, being the step father of the
parties to this suit.

Late Shri T. Sivashanker was a retired Civil

Servant (ICS) and held important positions both pre and post
retirement prior to his death on 17.07.1996.

Smt. Shanti T.

Sivashanker was the mother of the parties to this suit. She after
death of her first husband had married Sh. T. Sivashanker but there
was no child born to them from the said marriage.

Late T.

Sivashanker made three Wills during his lifetime on 05.09.1981,
15.02.1989 and on 04.10.1993.

The testator Shri T. Sivashanker

rescinded his earlier two Wills dated 05.09.1981 and 15.02.1989
while executing the third Will on 04.10.1993. The later Will dated
04.10.1993 duly got registered with the office of Sub Registrar,
Delhi. By this Will, he bequeathed all his movable and immovable
assets including the property bearing No.80, Paschimi Marg, Vasant
Vihar, New Delhi in favour of his widow Smt. Shanti T. Sivashanker.
He also provided for a contingency in his later Will of 04-10-93 that
in

Page Number 2 of 7

simultaneously then all his estate should devolve to

Sudhir

Sivashanker, son of Smt. Shanti T. Sivashanker from her first
husband.
3

Smt. Shanti Sivashanker also executed a Will simultaneously

on the same day her husband T. Sivashanker had executed his later
Will dated 04.10.1993 and she by her said Will bequeathed all her
movable and immovable assets which she may own at the time of
her demise in favour of her husband late Shri T. Sivashanker. The
testatrix Smt. Shanti Sivashanker also made a provision in her said
Will of 04.10.1993 that in case she and her husband T. Sivashanker
die simultaneously or about the same time then her entire estate
should devolve upon her son Sudhir Sivashanker (defendant). Smt.
Shanti Sivashanker also provided in her Will dated 04.10.1993
independently that her entire movable and immovable estates
should go to her son being the defendant herein in case the events
as mentioned in paras II and III of her said Will do not occur.

Smt.

Shanti Sivashanker expired on 29.02.2000. It shall be significant to
mention here that the parties to the present suit were litigating
against each other regarding their alleged right in the property
bearing No.80, Paschimi Marg, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi even during
the life time of late Smt. Shanti Sivashanker.

CS(OS) No. 430/2007

The plaintiff herein

Page Number 3 of 7

being the daughter of Smt. Shanti Sivashanker from her first
husband had filed two civil suits, one for permanent injunction and
the second for declaration and other related reliefs being suit
No.431/1998 and suit No.345/1999 during the life time of her
mother late Smt. Shanti Sivashanker. In the first suit filed by her for
permanent injunction, she had prayed for an injunction order
against the defendant to restrain him from alienating the suit
property in favour of any third party, relying upon the Will dated
15.02.1989 of late T. Sivashanker. The said first suit was dismissed
by the court of Shri R.K. Sharma, Civil Judge, Delhi vide detailed
judgment dated 06.03.2000 running into 25 pages. Paras 20 and 21
of the said judgment dated 06.03.2000 are extracted below :
“20 It is the case of the plaintiff that the testator
Sh. T. Sivashanker has expired on 17.07.1996 and that
defendant No. 2 has survived the testator. Thus, according
to the Will the suit premises vest solely and absolutely in
defendant No. 2. The plaintiff has no right in the suit
premises as per the will dated 15.02.1989 executed by Sh.
T. Sivashanker.
21
Since the only basis for claiming a right in the
suit premises put forth by the plaintiff in the present suit is
the Will and since I have already held that as per the Will,
there is no vested interest created in the plaintiff as per
the Will dated 15.02.1989 executed by Sh. T. Sivashanker,
relied upon by the plaintiff herself, the plaintiff has no
locus-standi to file the present suit and the suit as framed
is not maintainable.”

It was held by the Civil Judge in the aforementioned first suit

CS(OS) No. 430/2007

Page Number 4 of 7

that the plaintiff had no locus standi to file the suit for permanent
injunction against her brother being the defendant herein on the
basis of will dated 15.02.1989 of late Sh. T. Sivashanker. While the
first suit filed by the plaintiff against the defendant for permanent
injunction was pending, the plaintiff filed another suit being suit No.
345/1999 and in the said suit she prayed for a declaration that Will
dated 04.10.1993 of late Sh. T. Sivashanker be declared null and
void. In the second suit, the plaintiff also made a prayer for
declaration of her right that she was entitled to have a share in the
suit property on the basis of intestate succession. This second suit
filed by the plaintiff stood also dismissed vide judgment and order
dated 30.10.2007 passed by Sh. Sidharth Mathur, Civil Judge, Delhi.
The learned Civil Judge while dismissing the second suit has noted
the conduct of the plaintiff that she was interested only in delaying
the proceedings pending in that suit.
5

In both the abovementioned suits filed by the plaintiff during

the lifetime of her mother late Smt. Shanti Sivashanker, her mother
had filed her Written Statement in which she made a categorical
statement that the suit property bearing No. 80, Pashchimi Marg,
Vasant Vihar, New Delhi belongs to her son Sudhir Sivashanker and
her daughter being the plaintiff herein has nothing to do with the

CS(OS) No. 430/2007

Page Number 5 of 7

said property. The judgments passed in the above two suits are
stated to have acquired finality inter-parties because the plaintiff
against whom the said judgments were passed has not preferred
any appeal against these judgments, though limitation for filing of
the appeal has expired long ago.
6

From the above discussion and on a plain reading of Will dated

04.10.1993 executed both by husband and wife namely late Sh. T.
Sivashanker and late Smt. Shanti Sivashanker, it clearly emerges
that the plaintiff has no locus standi to file the present suit seeking
partition and a share in the suit property bearing No. 80, Pashchimi
Marg, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi as the said property devolve
exclusively to the defendant Sudhir Sivashanker. By no means it can
be said that the said property has to devolve between the plaintiff
and the defendant by inte-state succession as its succession has to
be by testamentary succession in terms of the Will dated
04.10.1993 left by late Smt. Shanti Sivashanker.
7

For the foregoing reason, the application for amendment of the

plaint filed by the plaintiff fails and is hereby dismissed. The
application filed by the defendant for dismissal of the suit under
Order 7 Rule 11 CPC succeeds and is therefore allowed. This suit is
accordingly dismissed for want of cause of action against the

CS(OS) No. 430/2007

Page Number 6 of 7

defendant. There shall be no orders as to costs.
8

The interim orders passed by this Court in the present suit

stand vacated.
