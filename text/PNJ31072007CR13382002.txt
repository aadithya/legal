PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
The dispute is between the father-in-law on one side

and on the other side his unfortunate daughter-in-law and her
father, mother and brother.

Petitioner Raj Singh is the

plaintiff. He filed a suit invoking remedy under Section 6 of the
Specific Relief Act seeking restoration of possession of property

CRP No.1338/02

Pg.No.1 of 7

bearing No.234, Village Rithala, Delhi.
2.
defendant

He impleaded his daughter-in-law Smt.Usha as a
and

her

mother,

brother

and

father

as

co-

defendants, alleging that on 19.11.1993 his daughter-in-law
aided and abetted by her father, brother and mother took
forcible possession of the suit property.
3.

Whereas

father,

brother

and

mother

of

the

daughter-in-law disclaimed any concern with the suit property,
the daughter-in-law asserted that she and her children were in
lawful possession of the suit property; that after she got
married to the son of the plaintiff on 22.11.1989 she started
residing in the matrimonial house at Ashok Vihar where even
plaintiff was residing. That she was tricked to shift to the suit
property as plaintiff i.e. her father-in-law and her mother-in-law
wanted their son and his family to shift to the suit property.
That when

along with her husband and children she shifted to

the suit property, her husband left her and returned to his
parents. She stated that the suit property was in the village
and she was tricked to move from a house in the urban area to
a dilapidated house in the village.

She stated that the suit

property was ancestral in the hands of the plaintiff and that, if
not she, her children i.e. her sons had a right by birth to jointly
CRP No.1338/02

Pg.No.2 of 7

possess and occupy the suit property. She further stated that
on 21.11.1993 the local panchayat intervened at the asking of
the plaintiff and took a decision that she along with her
children would be entitled to live in the suit property.
4.

On the pleadings of the parties, following issues

were framed:“1. Whether the suit is correctly valued for the
purpose of Court Fees and jurisdiction? OPD
2.
Whether the defendant No.4 is living in the
disputed house within her own rights? OPD
3.
Whether the plaintiff has got no locus standi to
file the present suit in view of decision of the
Panchayat on 21.11.1993? OPD
4.
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of
possession?

Relief.”
Vide impugned judgment dated 11.9.2002, learned

Trial Judge has returned a finding as under:“From the aforesaid facts coming out of the cross
examination of PW-1/plaintiff it is clear that the
property in dispute is ancestral property of the plaintiff
and the son of the plaintiff namely Shri Pawan Kumar –
who is the husband of defendant No.4 hence children
of said Shri Pawan Kumar also have right in the
property as co-owners. It is admitted fact that the
plaintiff was also not residing in the property in dispute
on the date of alleged forcible dispossession i.e.
19.11.1993. Taking into consideration the aforesaid
facts, even if it is assumed that prior to 19.11.1993 the
defendant was not residing in the property in dispute –
a suggestion which has been put to the DWs in their
CRP No.1338/02

Pg.No.3 of 7

6.

cross examination is correct, it is clear that the plaintiff
and the husband of the defendant No.4 – both were in
constructive possession of the suit property as its coowners.”
As a consequence, suit filed by the plaintiff has been

dismissed.
7.

At the outset I may note that a suit under Section 6

of the Specific Relief Act, being not a title suit, question of title
cannot be adjudicated in such a suit. Issue has to be decided
with reference to the fact of being in physical possession or
otherwise.
8.

I need not elaborate on the legal nuances of a suit

under Section 6 for the reason in my decision dated 17.4.2007
disposing of CRP No.193/2005, Deep Chand vs. Kulanand
Lakhera & Ors. I had exhaustively dealt with the law relating to
a suit based on a possessory title vis-a-vis a suit for possession
based on title. I adopt the discussion in said decision.
9.

It had been noted by me that the legal concept of

possession is not restricted to the common sense concept of
possession, viz., physical control. That possession in fact is not
a simple notion. The question, whether in fact a person is in
possession of a thing depend on various factors such as the
nature of the thing itself and the attitudes and activities of
other persons.
CRP No.1338/02

Pg.No.4 of 7

10.

Law recognizes possession as a substantive right or

an interest. Lawful possession is the state of being a possessor
in the eyes of law.
11.

Since possession is recognized as a right by itself,

law recognizes that a wrong doer who is deprived of his
possession can recover the same simply on the ground of his
possession provided the wrong doer can show juridical
possession.
12.

Unfortunately,

the

learned

Trial

Judge

has

proceeded to adjudicate the suit as if the subject matter of the
suit was the enforcement of a right, in co-parcenery properties,
to be in joint possession thereof.
13.

The issue before the learned Trial Judge was a

simple issue. It was, whether plaintiff was in possession of the
suit property and was he dispossessed on 19.11.1993.

The

issue had to be decided with reference to the fact of physical
possession and no more.
14.

Surely, family disputes pertaining to a right claimed

by a person to occupy joint family property cannot be resolved
by force and law does not recognize the wrong doer protecting
his unlawful possession based on his right to occupy the same.
15.

No person can be a judge in his own cause.

CRP No.1338/02

Pg.No.5 of 7

16.

If a person is physically excluded from a joint

property, he or she must regain possession thereof by due
process of law.
17.

Since the learned Trial Judge has not considered the

evidence in relation to the claim of respondent No.4 that she
and her children were already in possession of the property on
19.11.1993 as they were tricked to move into the suit property
vis-a-vis the claim of the plaintiff that his daughter-in-law
trespassed into the property on 19.11.1993 and in said act was
aided and abetted by her father, brother and mother, I am
inclined to remit the suit for fresh adjudication by the learned
Trial Judge.
18.

Petition stands disposed of quashing the impugned

judgment and decree dated 11.9.2002.
19.

Matter is remanded for fresh adjudication to decide

as per evidence.
20.

Learned Trial Judge would seek guidance from not

only the present decision but judgment and decree dated
17.4.2007 passed by this Court deciding CRP No.193/2005
Deep Chand vs. Kulanand Lakhera & Ors.

21.

Trial Court record, if received, be returned.
