respondent No. 3 as the arbitrator.

It appointed

After appointment

when the matter was listed for preliminary hearing,
arbitrator passed an interim order under Section 17 of the
Act. Aggrieved by the said order, the present appeal has
been preferred.

2. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also
gone through the documents placed on record. Agreement
dated 27.12.2002 contained an arbitration clause which
reads as follows:
“Any dispute or difference
whatsoever between the parties
arising out of or in connection with
the present facility and for any
other transaction/s between the
parties
shall
be
settled
by
Arbitration of a sole arbitrator
appointed by Chairman of Morgan
Securities and Credits Private
Limited, who would also have right
to appoint alternate Arbitrator in

Page 2 of 11

place of the aforesaid Arbitrator, in
case of his, death or being
incapable or refusal to act or in the
event of termination of his
mandate for any reason.
The
arbitration proceedings shall be
held at New Delhi. The power of
the Chairman to appoint a Sole
Arbitrator shall not be challenged
by any party. Further, the parties
agree that the arbitrator so
appointed may be an employee
and/or professional retainer and/or
a person who has a relation or
interest in the company.
The
parties agree not to ask for any
adjournment except under extraordinary reasons.”
3. Similarly,

the

agreement

dated

11.6.2003

contained

arbitration clause which is as follows:
“Any dispute or difference
whatsoever arising between the
parties out of or in relation to the
construction,
meaning,
scope,
operation
or
effect
of
any
transaction/s or the validity or the
breach thereof arising out of or in
connection
with
the
present
agreement and for any other
transaction/s between the parties
shall be settled by Arbitration of a
sole
Arbitrator
appointed
by
Chairman
of
the
Morgan

who would also have right to
appoint alternate Arbitrator in
place of the aforesaid Arbitrator,
in case of his death or being
incapable or refusal to act or in
the event of termination of his
mandate for any reason.
The
arbitration proceedings shall be
held at New Delhi. The power of
the Chairman to appoint a Sole
OMP No. 485/2007

Page 3 of 11

Arbitrator shall not be challenged
by either party.
Further, the
parties agree that the Arbitrator
so appointed may be an employee
and/or professional retainer and/or
a person who has a relation or
interest in the company.
Both
parties agree not to ask for any
adjournment except under extraordinary reasons.
The award
given by the arbitrator shall be
final and binding upon the
parties.”
4. When dispute arose between the parties, respondent No. 1
invoked arbitration clause and sent a letter dated 6.6.2007
calling upon the appellant to pay the amount as claimed
within seven days and if the payment was not made in time,
they would initiate legal action including invocation of
arbitration clause. Vide letter dated 28.6.2007, respondent
No. 1 invoked arbitration clause. Accordingly respondent
No. 3 was appointed as an arbitrator vide letter dated
2.7.2007 issued by the Chairman of respondent No. 1.

5. On her appointment, the arbitrator sent a letter dated
3.7.2007 to the appellant as well as respondents No. 1 & 2,
directing the parties to be present in person or through
their authorized representatives/counsel for preliminary
hearing on 12.7.2007 at 3.00 PM at B-57, Defence Colony,
New Delhi. This letter was duly replied by the appellant on

OMP No. 485/2007

Page 4 of 11

6.7.2007 seeking adjournment of the preliminary hearing
as the appellant was in the process of appointing a counsel
to represent it before the arbitrator.

However, the

arbitrator proceeded with the preliminary hearing on
12.7.2007.

6. In the preliminary hearing, the arbitrator passed the
following order:
“Present:

Mr. Joy Basu, Advocate
along with Mr. V.P.
Gupta authorized
representative of
the
Claimant.
Mr. Sanjeev Kumar,
Company Secretary for
both
the
respondents.
Let
the
Claimant
file
Statement of Claim within two
weeks,
with
copy
to
the
respondent, who may file the reply
to the Statement of Claim within
two weeks thereafter.
Both
parties should file their documents
along with their pleadings.
Matter be listed for framing
of issues on 21.08.2007 at 5.30
PM.
Mr. Basu says that there is a
negative
covenant
between
parties. As per clause 6 of the said
covenant
respondents
cannot
directly or indirectly sell, dispose
or
encumber
any
of
its
undertaking or business nor any of
its investment in shares etc. Mr.
Basu says respondent should be
restrained
from
transferring,
OMP No. 485/2007

Page 5 of 11

disposing or encumbering any of
its undertaking, business or any
property which it owns.
Mr. Sanjeev Kumar for the
Respondent says that so far as
Respondent No. 2, BPL Display
Devices Ltd. is concerned matter
is already before the BIFR.
However,
he
submitted
that
Respondent No. 1 is not before the
BIFR.
In view of clause 6 of the
negative covenant, respondent is
restrained
from
selling
or
disposing off, encumbering any of
its
business
or
properties,
investment in shares etc. till the
next date of hearing.
The fee of the Arbitrator is
fixed at Rs. 15,000/- per sitting to
be shared in equal proportion by
the parties. At the initial stage
parties shall pay an advance fee of
three hearings. They will also pay
lumpsum Misc. expenses of Rs.
6000/- to be shared in equal
proportion.
Fee and Misc.
Expenses be paid before the next
date of hearing.”
7. Appellant has challenged this order on the grounds that the
arbitrator conducted the proceedings dated 12.7.2007 and
passed interim order without any application and without
any claim petition being filed and without giving sufficient
notice to the opposite parties.

The arbitrator could not

have passed an interim order only on the basis of an oral
application and prayer without claim petition being there
and appellant had no opportunity to verify the correctness

OMP No. 485/2007

Page 6 of 11

and validity of the claim. Appellant has also challenged the
appointment of arbitrator and her jurisdiction to enter into
reference amongst other objections. But these objections
are not relevant for the purposes of consideration of the
present appeal.

8. To appreciate the submissions of the parties it becomes
necessary for me to reproduce Section 17 of the Act.
Section 17 of the Act reads as follows:
“17.
Interim
measures
ordered by arbitral tribunal.--(1)
Unless otherwise agreed by the
parties, the arbitral tribunal may,
at the request of a party, order a
party to take any interim measure
of protection as the arbitral
tribunal may consider necessary in
respect of the subject-matter of
the dispute.
(2) The arbitral tribunal may
require
a
party
to
provide
appropriate security in connection
with a measure ordered under subsection (1).”
9. Interpretation of Section 17 of the Act makes it clear that
arbitrator has the power to pass an interim measure of
protection as he may consider necessary in respect of
subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator can exercise
powers under Section 17 on the request of a party.

OMP No. 485/2007

Page 7 of 11

10.Under Section 17 of the Act, the arbitrator has limited
power and he cannot issue any direction which would go
beyond

the

reference

or

the

arbitration

agreement.

Interim order must relate to the protection of the subject
matter of dispute and the order can be addressed only to a
party to the arbitration and not to any other party.

This

section does not confer any power on the arbitral tribunal
to enforce its order nor it provides for judicial enforcement
of any such interim order passed by it.

Arbitral tribunal

cannot be considered as a court of law and its orders are
not treated as judicial orders, though award passed by the
arbitrator is enforceable in law.

The jurisdiction of the

arbitrator, therefore, is confined to the clauses contained in
the agreement inter se the parties only.

11.In

MD,

Army

Welfare

Housing

Organisation

v.

Sumangal Services (P) Ltd. - (2004) 9 SCC 619 , it was
observed:
“An Arbitral Tribunal is not a
court of law. Its orders are not
judicial orders. Its functions are
not judicial functions. It cannot
exercise its power ex debito
justitiae. The jurisdiction of the
arbitrator being confined to the
four corners of the agreement, he
can only pass such an order which
may
be
subject-matter
of
reference.”
OMP No. 485/2007

Page 8 of 11

12.It was further observed:
“A bare perusal of the
aforementioned provisions would
clearly show that even under
Section 17 of the 1996 Act the
power of the arbitrator is a limited
one. He cannot issue any direction
which would go beyond the
reference
or
the
arbitration
agreement.
Furthermore, an
award of the arbitrator under the
1996 Act is not required to be
made a rule of court; the same is
enforceable on its own force. Even
under Section 17 of the 1996 Act,
an interim order must relate to the
protection of the subject-matter of
dispute and the order may be
addressed only to a party to the
arbitration.
It
cannot
be
addressed to other parties. Even
under Section 17 of the 1996 Act,
no power is conferred upon the
Arbitral Tribunal to enforce its
order nor does it provide for
judicial enforcement thereof. The
said interim order of the learned
arbitrator, therefore, being coram
non judice was wholly without
jurisdiction and, thus, was a
nullity.”
13.In National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) v.

China Coal Construction Group Corpn. - AIR 2006
Delhi 134, the learned Single Judge of this Court followed
the observations made in MD, Army Welfare Housing

Organisation v. Sumangal Services (P) Ltd. (supra).

OMP No. 485/2007

Page 9 of 11

14.In the present case, the arbitrator passed the interim
order dated 12.7.2007 in a preliminary hearing and no
claim or counter claim or reply had been filed and the
arbitrator was not even aware of the nature of the parties'
claims. This resulted into placing the parties in a situation
which was beyond the subject of reference.

The appellant

was also not given any opportunity to contest the interim
protection sought by the respondent No. 1 by way of oral
submissions. Therefore, this order is without jurisdiction.
Present petition was filed on 20.8.2007 i.e. after about one
month of passing of interim order dated 12.7.2007.

As

pleaded by the appellant, respondent No. 1 had not filed
any claims before the arbitrator till the filing of the appeal.

15.Respondent has placed on record a copy of the claim and
the affidavit allegedly filed before the arbitrator.

It is

pertinent to point out that no date is mentioned either in
the statement of claim or in the affidavit of Mr. P.K. Gupta,
authorized signatory of the claimant. Therefore, it is not
known as to when and if at all the statement of claim was
filed by the respondent No. 1 before the arbitrator.
Interim order was passed by the arbitrator in view of
clause 6 of the agreement dated 27.12.2002. There is no
such covenant in the agreement dated 11.6.2003.
OMP No. 485/2007

16.In view of my discussion as above, appeal is allowed.
Interim order dated 12.7.2007 passed by the arbitrator is
hereby set aside.
