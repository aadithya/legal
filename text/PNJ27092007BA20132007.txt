1.

FIR No.227/2007
U/S.363/366/376 IPC
P.S. Badarpur
Petitioner Rita is in judicial custody since 21.3.2007.

She is 22 years of age and has a minor son aged 3 years. The
child is under treatment for a medical ailment.
2.

Case of the prosecution against the petitioner is that

the prosecutrix Kumari P., a minor, was enticed by the petitioner
and her husband and made to join company

of co-accused,

Raghudas, who committed rape on Kumari P.
petitioner is as per statement of Kumari P.

Role of the

recorded under

Section 164 Cr.P.C. who stated that on 7.3.2007 she had gone to

Gautam Puri where she was undergoing

a course in stitching.

That Rita came to the class and told the supervisor that Kumari
P's mother was unwell. That she i.e. Kumari P. left the stitching
class in company of Rita who took her to the house of Raghudas
where Rita's husband was present.

That Raghudas threatened

her and performed the ritual of a marriage.

Thereafter, he

committed rape on her.
3.

It is relevant to note that father of Kumari P. had

lodged a report with the police that his daughter Kumari P. was
missing. The report was lodged on 11.3.2007.

He had named

Raghudas as a suspect.
4.

Thereafter, on 20.3.2007 afore-noted FIR restricted to

offence under Section 363/366 was registered because father of
Kumari P. informed the police that he suspected that his daughter
was kidnapped in order to marry her with Raghudas.
5.

It appears that Raghudas learnt about the registration

of the afore-noted FIR on 20.3.2007 for the reason, on 21.3.2007,
he and Kumar P. went to the courts at Patiala House to meet a
lawyer and prepare some papers evidencing that the two had got
married. Raghudas was apprehended alongwith Kumari P. from
the precincts of Patiala House Courts.

Kumari P. was recovered.

Raghuraj was taken into custody. Thereafter, Kumari P. made a
statement not only to the police but even under Section 164
Cr.P.C. as afore-noted.

6.

It is apparent that the prosecutrix remained with

Raghuraj from 10.3.2007 till 21.3.2007.
with

Raghudas

in

Patiala

House

She was moving around

Courts

when

the

police

apprehended the two.
7.

The age of Raghuraj is 20 years.

The age of the

prosecutrix is around 16 years. The age of the petitioner is 22
years. The age of the husband of the petitioner is 24 years.
8.

Petitioner and her husband being friends of Raghudas

is a probability. They reside in the same colony. The two having
extended a helping hand to Raghudas and Kumari P. to elope
cannot be ruled out.
9.

Evidence

points

to

probable

consent

of

the

prosecutrix, Kumari P.
10.

Of course, as vehemently urged by the learned counsel

for the State, consent of Kumari P. is irrelevant as she is a minor.
11.

May be true, but viz-a-viz the petitioner, what is

relevant is that possibility of the petitioner facilitating two love
birds in the union and acting bonafide is a possibility which
cannot be ruled out.
12.

Noting

the young age of the petitioner and the fact

that she has a minor child aged approx. 3 years to be looked
after and the fact that even her husband being a co-accused is in
judicial custody, I am of the opinion that case is made out to
release the petitioner on bail pending trial.

13.

Petition stands disposed of directing the learned Trial

Judge to release the petitioner on bail in the afore-noted FIR on
her furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.15,000/- with one
surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned Trial
Judge.
14.

Copy of the order be given dasti.
