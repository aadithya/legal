Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Act against the
present petitioner and others including M/s Earthtech

is engaged in the business of marketing of agricultural
products and Nafed financial activities is the consonance of

Memorandum of Understanding

In this

dated 16th

October, 2003 was executed between the complainant
society

and

the

accused

company

represented

by

Sh.Avdesh Kumar Singh. By virtue of this Memorandum of
Understanding, respondent No.1 was provided with foreign
and inland letter of credit facilities for importing various
agricultural and non-agricultural commodities on their
account.

In addition, respondent No.1 also associated

Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 3 of

28

Merchanting Trade Transaction with the accused company
to facilitate the import of commodities from one country
and its subsequent sale to other country without touching
Indian territory/ports on account of the accused No.1 as
per guidelines issued by RBI. The accused company kept
on promising to pay the outstanding amount from time to
time without any intention to pay.

During the course of

transaction, the accused company under went financial
liabilities of Rs.202.60 crores vis-a-vis Inland, Foreign LCs
and Rs.235.15 crores vis a vis Merchanting Trade towards
the respondent No.1 society.
5.

Towards the discharge of above mentioned financial

liabilities, the accused company provided the respondent
No.1 with post dates cheques worth Rs.180 crores of
different values payable on different dates. Out of these
cheques, one cheque for Rs.5 crores was deposited by
respondent No.1 with its bankers for encashment but the

Respondent No.1 informed the accused

regarding the dishonour of the cheque and asked them to

pay the amount.

However, the accused did not pay any

heed to the request of the respondent No.1.

Thereafter

legal notice was sent and despite that accused failed to
make the payment against the said cheque.
6.

It is further alleged in the complaint that accused

No.2 to 4 at the time of the commission of the offence were
in charge of and were responsible to the company for the
conduct of the business of the company and, therefore, the
accused No.2 to 4 as well as accused No.1(company) are
liable for offence committed by accused No.1 under
Section 138 of the Act. The present petitioner, is accused
No.3 in this case. With these allegations, respondent No.1
has filed these complaint cases against petitioner and other
accused persons.

the

Magistrate

summoned the accused persons to face trial under Section
138 of the Act.
8.

It has

been contended by learned counsel for the

petitioner that a bare reading of the complaint goes on to
show that there are no allegations whatsoever against the

Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 5 of

28

petitioner alleging that he was “incharge of” and/or “was
responsible”, for the “conduct of the business of the
company”, in accordance with the settled law. Further, a
perusal of the complaint emphatically establishes, that no
allegation exits, whatsoever against the petitioner, that
would define or implicate the petitioner in any manner, by
way of an offence under Sections 138 and 141 of the Act.
The petitioner is not the signatory of the dishonoured
cheques, nor he is the Chairman or Managing Director of
the company.

The petitioner admittedly was neither

“incharge” nor “responsible”, either directly or indirectly in
the day-to-day affairs of the company. The petitioner has
been arrayed as an accused only being a “Director”, and
for no other reasons/purpose.
offence either pleaded

In the absence of any

or made out in accordance with

Section 138 of the Act, no process/summons could be
issued against the petitioner.

It is clear from the record

that the learned Magistrate did not apply his mind to the
material allegations in the complaint as required under the
Code of Criminal Procedure. No offence whatsoever, has

Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 6 of

28

either been made out or alleged in the criminal complaint,
warranting the issuance of the summons/process and as
such the present complaint is an abuse of process of law.
9.

Learned counsel for the petitioner in support of his

contentions has cited

various decisions of this Court as

well as Apex Court contending that since no offence is
made out against the present petitioner, the complaint is
an abuse of the process of law and is liable to be quashed.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has cited following
judgments:-

1.S.M.S.Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. Neeta Bhalla (2005) 8
SCC 89
2.N.K.Wahi vs. Shekhar Singh & Ors (2007) DLT 783 (SC)

Present petitions have been filed under Section 482

Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 7 of

28

Cr.P.C. which reads as under:“482. Saving of inherent power of High Court –
Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or
affect the inherent powers of the High Court to make
such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any
order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the
process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends
of justice.”
11.

This provision of law envisages three circumstances

under which the inherent jurisdiction may be exercised,
namely i)to give effect to an order under the code,
ii)to prevent abuse of the process of court, and
iii)to otherwise secure the ends of justice.
Further to seek interference under this Section,
three conditions are to be fulfilled, namely i) the injustice which comes to light should be of a
grave and not of a trivial character;
ii) it should be pulpable and clear and not doubtful;
and
iii) there exists no other provision of law by which the
party aggrieved could have sought relief.
12.

Keeping in view these principles in mind, it is to be

Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 8 of

28

seen as to whether the present petitions under Section 482
CrPC are maintainable or not.
13.

In N.K. Wahi vs. Shekhar Singh & Ors.(Supra), it

has been laid down that as per Section 141 of the Act, only
such person is held liable if at the time when the offence
was committed, he was in charge and responsible to the
company for conduct of the business of the company.
Held:“In certain contingencies referred to under
Section 138 of the Act on the cheques being
dishonoured a new offence as such had been
created.
But to take care of the offences
purported to have been committed provisions of
Sub-section (1) to Section 141 of the Act come
into play. It reads as under:
“141. Offence by companies – (1) If the
person committing an offence under
Section 138 is a company, every
person who, at the time the offence
was committed, was in charge of, and
was responsible to, the company for
the conduct of the business of the
company, as well as the company,
shall be deemed to be guilty of the
offence and shall be liable to be
proceeded against and punished
accordingly:
Provided that nothing contained in this
sub-section shall render any person
liable to punishment if he proves that
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 9 of

28

the offence was committed without his
knowledge, or that he had exercised
all due dilignece to prevent the
commission of such offence.”
14.

This provision clearly shows that so far as the

companies are concerned if any offence is committed by it
then every person who is a Director or employee of the
company is not liable.

Only such person would be held

liable if at the time when offence is committed he was incharge and was responsible to the company for the conduct
of the business of the company as well as the company.
Merely being a Director of the company in the absence of
above factors will not make him liable.
15.

To launch a prosecution, therefore, against the

alleged Directors there must be a specific allegation in the
complaint as to the part played by them in the transaction.
There should be clear and unambiguous allegation as to
how the Directors are in charge and responsible for the
conduct of the business of the company. The description
should be clear.

It is true that precise words from the

provisions of the Act need not be reproduced and the Court

Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 10 of

28

can always come to a conclusion in facts of each case. But
still in the absence of any averment or specific evidence
the net result would be that complaint would not be
entertanable.
16.

Section 138 of the Act reads as under:
“138.
Dishonour
of
cheque
for
insufficiency, etc., of funds in the
accounts - Where any cheque drawn by a
person on an account maintained by him
with a banker for payment of any amount
of money to another persons from out of
that account for the discharge, in whole
or in part, of any debt or other liability, is
returned by the bank unpaid, either
because of the amount of money standing
to the credit of that account is
insufficient to honour the cheque or that
it exceeds the amount arranged to be
paid
from
that
account
by
an
arrangement made with that bank, such
person shall be deemed to have
committed an offence and shall, without
prejudice to any other provisions of this
Act, be punished with imprisonment for a
term which may be extended to two
years, or with fine which may extend to
twice the amount of the cheque, or with
both.”
In order to bring application of Section
138 the complaint must show:
(1) That cheque was issued;
(2) The same was presented;
(3) It was dishonoured on

Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 11 of

28

presentation;
(4) A notice in terms of the
provisions was served on the person
sought to be made liable;
(5) Despite service of notice, neither
any payment was made nor other
obligations,
if any, were complied
with within fifteen
days from the date
of receipt of the
notice.
Section 141 of the Act in terms
postulates constructive liability of the
Directors of the company, or other
persons responsible for its conduct or the
business of the company.”
17.

The averments made against the present petitioner in

the complaint read as under:“That the accused No.2 to 4 at the time of
commission of offence were in charge of, and
were responsible to the company for the
conduct of the business of the company and
therefore, the accused No.2 to 4 as well as
accused No.1 (company) and liable for the
offence committed by the accused No.1 under
Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument act.”
18.

So the complainant has made specific allegations in

the complaint that the present petitioner at the time of the
commission

of

offence

was

incharge

of,

and

was

responsible to the company for the conduct of the business
of the company and, therefore, was liable for the offence

Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 12 of

28

committed by the company under the Act.
19.

Before

filing

the

present

petitions,

admittedly

respondent No.1 has given a legal notice. This notice has
been dully received on behalf of the petitioner and the copy
of the same has been placed on record. In its reply, it has
been admitted by the petitioner that he is the whole time
Director of M/s Earthtech Enterprises Ltd., the accused
company, in this case.

In para 4 of this reply, the

petitioner has admitted his liability but according to him
the cheque in question was only a collateral security. The
relevant portion of the reply to the legal notice sent by the
petitioner reads as under:“That it is stated that during course of business
transactions between our client company and
your client, certain material were procured by
our client company under High Sea Sale from
your client, from time to time, for which due
payments had been made on a regular basis.
However recently, vide letter dated 19.5.2006,
our client company offered to your client to
transfer all available materials, at cost price, in
adjustment of good and subsisting debtors.
However, your client specifically refused to
accept such arrangement for reasons best
known to your client. Vide stated letter dated
19.5.2006 our client duly put your client to
notice and stated that under the subject cheque
on presentation since the cheque in question
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 13 of

28

was only a collateral security, which could not
be involved in view of the fact that the primary
security, in goods/debtors, had been refused by
our client. In spite of being put to notice not to
deposit the subject cheque is violation of
accepted norm of business and commence, your
client wrongly chose to deposit the subject
cheque entirely to pressurize our client
company to wrongly submit to its nefarious
designs and intents.”
20.

So, according to this reply sent by the petitioner,

execution of the cheques in question has nowhere been
disputed and as per the reply of the petitioner, the cheques
in question were issued being a collateral security.

This

question as to whether the cheques in question were only a
collateral security or not, is a matter of evidence to be
decided later on during the course of the trial. Moreover,
petitioner has no where taken up this plea in his reply that
he was neither incharge of or responsible to the company
for the conduct of the business of accused company.
21.

So, in view of the averments made in the complaint

and in view of the reply sent by the petitioner in response
to the legal notice, it is to be seen in this case as to
whether, prima facie, an offence under Section 138 of the
Act is made out in this case or not.
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

22.

In SMS Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Neeta Bhalla & Anr.

(2005) 8 SCC 89, it was, inter alia, held as follows:“To sum up, there is almost unanimous
judicial
opinion
that
necessary
averments ought to be contained in a
complaint before a person can be
subjected to criminal process. A
liability under Section 141 of the Act is
sought to be fastened vicariously on a
person connected with a company, the
principal accused being the company
itself. It is a departure from the rule in
criminal law against vicarious liability.
A clear case should be spelled out in
the complaint against the person
sought to be made liable. Section 141
of the Act contains the requirements
for making a person liable under the
said provision. That the respondent
falls within the parameters of Section
141 has to be spelled out. A complaint
has to be examined by the Magistrate
in the first instance on the basis of
averments contained therein. If the
Magistrate is satisfied that there are
averments which bring the case within
Section 141, he would issue the
process. We have seen that merely
being described as a director in a
company is not sufficient to satisfy the
requirement of Section 141. Even a
non-director can be liable under
Section 141 of the Act. The averments
in the complaint would also serve the
purpose that the person sought to be
made liable would know what is the
case which is alleged against him. This
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 15 of

28

will enable him to meet the case at the
trial.”
23.

In view of the above discussion, our answers to the

questions posed in the reference are as under:
“(a) It is necessary to specifically
aver in a complaint under Section
141 that at the time the offence was
committed, the person accused was
in charge of, and responsible for the
conduct of business of the company.
This averment is an essential
requirement of Section 141 and has
to be made in a complaint. Without
this averment being made in a
complaint, the requirements of
Section 141 cannot be said to be
satisfied.
(b) The answer to the question posed
in sub-para (b) has to be in the
negative. Merely being a director of
a company is not sufficient to make
the person liable under Section 141
of the Act. A director in a company
cannot be deemed to be in charge of
and responsible to the company for
the conduct of its business. The
requirement of Section 141 is that
the person sought to be made liable
should be in charge of and
responsible for the conduct of the
business of the company at the
relevant time. This has to be averred
as a fact as there is no deemed
liability of a director in such cases.

Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 16 of

28

(c) The answer to Question (c) has to
be in the affirmative. The question
notes that the managing director or
joint managing director would be
admittedly in charge of the company
and responsible to the company for
the conduct of its business. When
that is so, holders of such positions
in a company become liable under
Section 141 of the Act. By virtue of
the office they hold as managing
director or joint managing director,
these persons are in charge of and
responsible for the conduct of
business of the company. Therefore,
they get covered under Section 141.
So far as the signatory of a cheque
which is dishonoured is concerned,
he is clearly responsible for the
incriminating act and will be covered
under sub-section (2) of Section
141."
24.

The

matter

was

again

considered

in

Sabitha

Ramamurthy and Anr. vs. R.B.S. Channabasavaradhys
and Anr. 2006 (9) SCALE 212 and Saroj Kumar
Poddar vs. Sate (NCT of Delhi) and Anr., JT 2007 (2)
SC 233. It was, inter alia, held as follows:
“.......... Section 141 raised a legal
fiction.
By reason of the said
provision, a person although is not
personally liable for commission of
such an offence would be vicariously
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 17 of

28

liable therefore.
Such vicarious
liability can be inferred so far as a
company registered or incorporated
under the Companies Act, 1956 is
concerned only if the requisite
statements, which are required to be
averred in the complaint petition, are
made so as to make the accused
therein vicariously liable for the
offence committed by the company.
Before a person can be made
vicariously liable, strict compliance of
the statutory requirements would be
insisted.......”
25.

So, according to these judgments, there has to be an

averment

that

the

accused

was

“in

charge

of”

or

“responsible to the company for conduct of the business of
the company”.
26.

As already stated above, these averments have been

made by the complainant in the cases in hand and the Apex
Court had the occasion to deal with the provisions of
Section 138 and 141 of the Act very recently in N.
Rangachari vs. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited AIR
2007 SC 1682.
27.

In this case, the decision of S.M.S. Pharmaceutical

(Supra) has also been referred to. The Apex Court held:
“By the fall in moral standards, even these
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 18 of

28

negotiable
instruments
like
cheques
issued, started losing their creditability by
not being honoured on presentment. It
was found that an action in the civil court
for collection of the proceeds of a
negotiable instrument like a cheque
tarried, thus defeating the very purpose of
recognizing a negotiable instrument as a
speedy vehicle of commerce. It was in that
context that Chapter VII was inserted in
the Negotiable Instruments Act by the
Banking, Public Financial Institutions and
Negotiable
Instruments
Laws
(Amendment) Act, 1988 (Act 66 of 1988)
with effect from 1.4.1989. The said Act
inserted Sections 138 and 142 in the
Negotiable Instruments Act. The objects
and reasons for inserting the Chapter was:
"to enhance the acceptability of
cheques in settlement of liabilities by
making the drawer liable for
penalties in case of bouncing of
cheques due to insufficiency of funds
in the accounts or for the reason that
it exceeds the arrangements made by
the
drawer,
with
adequate
safeguards to prevent harassment of
honest drawers"
While Section 138 made a person
criminally liable on dishonour of a cheque
for
insufficiency
of
funds
or
the
circumstances referred to in the Section
and on the conditions mentioned therein.
Section 141 laid down a special provision
in respect of issuance of cheques by
companies and commission of offences by
companies under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act. Therein, it
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 19 of

28

was provided that if the person committing
an offence under Section 138 of the Act
was a company, every person who at the
time the offence was committed, was in
charge of and was responsible to the
company for the conduct of the business of
the company as well as the company, shall
be deemed to be guilty of the offence and
shall be liable to be proceeded against and
punished accordingly.
The scope of
Section 141 has been authoritatively
discussed in the decision in S.M.S.
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra) binding on us
and there is no scope for redefining it in
this case.
Suffice it to say, that a
prosecution could be launched not only
against the company on behalf of which
the cheque issued has been dishonoured,
but it could also be initiated against every
person who at the time the offence was
committed, was in charge of and was
responsible for the conduct of the business
of the company.
In fact, Section 141
deems such persons to be guilty of such
offence, liable to be proceeded against and
punished for the offence, leaving it to the
person concerned, to prove that the
offence was committed by the company
without his knowledge or that he has
exercised due diligence to prevent the
commission of the offence. Sub-section (2)
of Section 141 also roped in Directors,
Managers, Secretaries or other officers of
the company, if it was proved that the
offence was committed with their consent
or connivance.
A Company, though a legal entity,
cannot act by itself but can only act
through its directors. Normally, the Board
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 20 of

28

of Directors act for and on behalf of the
company. This is clear from Section 291 of
the Companies Act which provides that
subject to the provisions of that Act, the
Board of Directors of a Company shall be
entitled to exercise all such powers and to
do all such acts and things as the Company
is authorized to exercise and do. Palmer
described the position thus:"A company
can only act by agents, and usually the
persons by whom it acts and by whom the
business of the company is carried on or
superintended are termed directors........."
It is further stated in Palmer that:
"Directors are, in the eye of the law,
agents of the company for which they
act, and the general principles of the
law of principal and agent regulate in
most respects the relationship of the
company and its directors."
The above two passages were quoted with
approval in R.K. Dalmia & ors. Vs. The
Delhi Administration [(1963) 1 S.C.R. 253
at page 300]. In Guide to the Companies
Act by A. Ramaiya (Sixteenth Edition) this
position is summed up thus:
"All the powers of management of the
affairs of the company are vested in
the Board of Directors. The Board
thus becomes the working organ of
the company.
In their domain of
power, there can be no interference,
not even by shareholders.
The
directors as a board are exclusively
empowered to manage and are
exclusively
responsible
for that
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 21 of

28

management."
Therefore, a person in the commercial
world having a transaction with a company
is entitled to presume that the directors of
the company are in charge of the affairs of
the company. If any restrictions on their
powers are placed by the memorandum or
articles of the company, it is for the
directors to establish it at the trial. It is in
that context that Section 141 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act provides that
when the offender is a company, every
person, who at the time when the offence
was committed was in charge of and was
responsible to the company for the
conduct of the business of the company,
shall also be deemed to be guilty of the
offence along with the company.
It
appears to us that an allegation in the
complaint that the named accused are
directors of the company itself would
usher in the element of their acting for and
on behalf of the company and of their
being in charge of the company. In Gower
and Davies' Principles of Modern Company
Law (Seventh Edition), the theory behind
the idea of identification is traced as
follows:
"It is possible to find in the cases
varying formulations of the underlying principle, and the most recent
definitions suggest that the courts are
prepared today to give the rule of
attribution based on identification a
somewhat broader scope.
In the
original formulation in the Lennard's
Carrying Company case Lord Haldane
based identification on a person "who
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 22 of

28

is really the directing mind and will of
the corporation, the very ego and
centre of the personality of the
corporation". Recently, however, such
an approach has been castigated by
the Privy Council through Lord
Hoffmann in the Meridian Global case
as a misleading "general metaphysic
of companies". The true question in
each case was who as a matter of
construction of the statute in question,
or presumably other rule of law, is to
be regarded as the controller of the
company for the purpose of the
identification rule."
But as has already been noticed, the
decision in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
(supra) binding on us, has postulated that
a director in a company cannot be deemed
to be in charge of and responsible to the
company for the conduct of his business in
the context of Section 141 of the Act.
Bound as we are by that decision, no
further discussion on this aspect appears
to be warranted.
A person normally having business or
commercial dealings with a company,
would
satisfy
himself
about
its
creditworthiness and reliability by looking
at its promoters and Board of Directors
and the nature and extent of its business
and its Memorandum or Articles of
Association. Other than that, he may not
be aware of the arrangements within the
company in regard to its management,
daily routine, etc.
Therefore, when a
cheque issued to him by the company is
dishonoured, he is expected only to be
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 23 of

28

aware generally of who are in charge of
the affairs of the company.
It is not
reasonable to expect him to know whether
the person who signed the cheque was
instructed to do so or whether he has been
deprived of his authority to do so when he
actually signed the cheque. Those are
matters peculiarly within the knowledge of
the company and those in charge of it. So,
all that a payee of a cheque that is
dishonoured can be expected to allege is
that the persons named in the complaint
are in charge of its affairs. The Directors
are prima facie in that position.
In fact, in an earlier decision in
Monaben Ketanbhai Shah & Anr. Vs. State
of Gujarat & Ors. [(2004) 7 S.C.C. 15], two
learned judges of this Court noticed that:
"The laudable object of preventing
bouncing of cheques and sustaining
the
credibility
of
commercial
transactions resulting in enactment of
Sections 138 and 141 has to be borne
in mind."
In the light of the ratio in S.M.S.
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra) what is to be
looked into is whether in the complaint, in
addition to asserting that the appellant
and another are the directors of the
company, it is further alleged that they are
in charge of and responsible to the
company for the conduct of the business of
the company.
We find that such an
allegation is clearly made in the complaint
which we have quoted above. Learned
Senior Counsel for the appellant argued
that in Saroj Kumar Poddar case (supra),
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 24 of

28

this Court had found the complaint
unsustainable only for the reason that
there was no specific averment that at the
time of issuance of the cheque that was
dishonoured, the persons named in the
complaint were in charge of the affairs of
the company. With great respect, we see
no warrant for assuming such a position in
the context of the binding ratio in S.M.S.
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra) and in view
of the position of the Directors in a
company as explained above.
In Rajesh Bajaj Vs. State of NCT of
Delhi & Ors. [A.I.R. 1999 S.C. 1216], two
learned judges of this Court stated:
"For quashing an FIR (a step which is
permitted only in extremely rare cases)
the information in the complaint must
be so bereft of even the basic facts
which are absolutely necessary for
making out the offence."
In M/s Bilakchand Gyanchand Co. Vs. A
Chinnaswami [A.I.R. 1999 S.C. 2182], this
Court held that a complaint under Section
138 of the Act was not liable to be quashed
on the ground that the notice as
contemplated by Section 138 of the Act
was addressed to the Director of the
Company at its office address and not to
the Company itself.
The view was
reiterated in Rajneesh Aggarwal Vs. Amit
J. Bhalla [A.I.R. 2001 S.C. 518]. These
decisions indicate that too technical an
approach on the sufficiency of notice and
the contents of the complaint is not
warranted in the context of the purpose
sought to be achieved by the introduction
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 25 of

28

of Sections 138 and 141 of the Act.
In the case on hand, reading the
complaint as a whole, it is clear that the
allegations in the complaint are that at the
time at which the two dishonoured
cheques were issued by the company, the
appellant and another were the Directors
of the company and were in charge of the
affairs of the company. It is not proper to
split hairs in reading the complaint so as
to come to a conclusion that the
allegations as a whole are not sufficient to
show that at the relevant point of time the
appellant and the other are not alleged to
be persons in charge of the affairs of the
company. Obviously, the complaint refers
to the point of time when the two cheques
were issued, their presentment, dishonour
and failure to pay in spite of notice of
dishonour.
We have no hesitation in
overruling the argument in that behalf by
the learned Senior Counsel for the
appellant.
We think that, in the circumstances,
the High Court has rightly come to the
conclusion that it is not a fit case for
exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482
of the Code of Criminal procedure for
quashing the complaint.
In fact, an
advertence to Sections 138 and 141 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act shows that on
the other elements of an offence under
Section 138 being satisfied, the burden is
on the Board of Directors or the Officers in
charge of the affairs of the company to
show that they are not liable to be
convicted. Any restriction on their power
or existence of any special circumstance
Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 26 of

28

that makes them not liable is something
that is peculiarly within their knowledge
and it is for them to establish at the trial
such a restriction or to show that at the
relevant time they were not in charge of
the affairs of the company. Reading the
complaint as a whole, we are satisfied that
it is a case where the contentions sought
to be raised by the appellant can only be
dealt with after the conclusion of the trial.”
28.

So, the question whether a person is a Director

incharge of the affairs of the company at the relevant time,
can only be judged during the course of trial and the
complaint cannot be quashed under Section 482 CrPC.
29.

As already stated above, in the present case, specific

averments have been made against the petitioner that
petitioner was incharge of, and/or was responsible for the
company for the conduct of the business of the company
and admittedly as per petitioner's own reply he was whole
time Director of the accused company.
30.

So, in view of the decision of the Apex Court in

N.Rangachari (supra) when specific averments have been
made against the petitioner and since it can be adjudged
only during the course of trial whether the present

Crl.M.C.No.3012/2007

Page 27 of

28

petitioner was in charge of or responsible to the affairs of
the company or not, the present petitions are wholly misconceived and are not maintainable.
31. Under these circumstance, in view of the discussion
held above, the present petitions are not maintainable and
the same are, hereby, dismissed.
