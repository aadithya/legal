SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.
1. The present matter is concerned with a claim of infringement
of the patent of the plaintiff in respect of “a device for
detection of antibodies to Hepatitis C Virus (for short, HCV) in
human serum and plasma”. The early detection of HCV is
stated to be critical as there is no vaccine for the same.
2. The plaintiff is stated to be a Private Limited Company
engaged in the manufacture and sale of diagnostic kits and is

IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 1 of 52

also stated to be a holder of various patents, designs and
trademarks in respect of its products. The plaintiff's application
(I.A. No. 11883 of 2006) under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2 and
Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code (hereinafter referred to
as the 'said Code')

is for the issuance of a temporary

injunction restraining the defendants from infringing the
plaintiff's Patent No. 194638 dated 22nd September, 2006 in a
suit for permanent injunction, rendition of accounts and
damages.
3. The plaintiff further claims to be a pioneer company enjoying
a major market share and a constant innovator in technological
breakthroughs in the field of diagnostic devices in India. It is
stated that the plaintiff had established an in-house Research
and Development Department in 1987 which is duly registered
and approved by the Department of Scientific & Industrial
Research, Ministry of Science & Technology, Government of
India.
4. It is averred that the plaintiff developed a diagnostic device
namely HCV TRI-DOT in the field of rapid visual test for the
qualitative detection of antibodies to Hepatitis C virus in
human serum or plasma. Such device is stated to ensure
specificity and sensitivity in carrying out the tests making them
viable for detection of HCV infection in laboratories, clinics,
blood banks etc. It is claimed that the said device is a “fourth
generation” device which is stated to detect the antibodies if
present for 10-15 days. It was pointed out that the first
generation devices could detect the antibodies if present for a
period of more than three months, and the second generation
devices in case of antibodies present for more than two
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 2 of 52

months. In case of the third generation devices, this time
period was reduced to one month.
5. The plaintiff company through its patent agents is stated to
have applied for grant of patent in respect of the said product
on 14-06-2000 with complete specifications comprising of
various claims. The description of such invention has been
given in claim 1 & 2 which is as under:
“Claim No.1
A device for the detection of antibodies of
Hepatitis C Virus in human serum and plasma
comprising base, an absorbent pad made of
cellulosic material having a thickness of 2.4 to 2.7

base,
an
immunofilteration membrane on the said pad
made up of cellulosic material having a pore size
of 0.8-1.5 micron and diameter of 12 mm having
three coatings of homogenous mixture of different
HCV recombinant antigens as herein described
chemically linked and physically mixed along with
the dispensing agent as herein described spotted
on the said immunofilteration membrane, a top
cover fitted tightly and removably attached to
said base having a central hole conforming to the
circumference
of
said
immunofilteration
membrane provided with two test dots (T1 & T2)
and one built in quality control dot (C) within the
circumference
of
said
immunofilteration
membrane to render 100% sensitivity and 98.9%
specificity of the sample under test.
Claim No.2

6. Such application post acceptance was notified in the Gazette
on 20-11-2004 to which a pre-grant opposition was filed by
defendant no. 2 on 21-03-2005. Such opposition was heard and
dismissed vide order dated 23-08-2006 and finally the said
patent was granted in favour of the plaintiff on 22-09-2006 as
mentioned aforesaid. An appeal against the same being FAO
292-293/2006 was filed by defendant no. 2 wherein an exparte order was passed on 19.10.2006 directing that the order
of the Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs be not given
effect to until further orders. In the meantime, the Certificate
of Registration of the said patent was duly obtained by the
plaintiff on 15-10-2006.
7. The plaintiff also claims to be the forerunner in the market as
regards the “rapid visual test for qualitative detection of
antibodies to Hepatitis C Virus in human serum or plasma” and
in support of its claim has set out its sales in para 6 of the
plaint.
8. It is also the submission of the plaintiff that the patent in
respect of the said device has been granted in South Africa,
Sudan and the UAE and in other jurisdictions, the same has
entered the national phase and is pending and the fact of the
patent being granted in other jurisdictions would reinforce the
patentability and novelty of the said product.
9. It is the case of the plaintiff that on or about 11-10-2006, the
plaintiff purchased the product of defendant no. 2 from
defendant no. 1 `being a proprietorship firm in the business of
sale and purchase of various pharmaceutical and diagnostic
products including the products so manufactured by defendant
no. 2 and found that the product of defendant no. 2 was based

Page No. 4 of 52

and covered by the claims and invention provided in the
complete specification of the plaintiff’s said patent no. 194638.
10.

It is submitted that all components of the plaintiff’s test

device HCV TRI-DOT form an integral part of defendant no. 2’s
product Signal HCV and for the purposes of elucidating the
same, a comparative table is given in para 9 of the plaint
which has been reproduced hereunder :

Claim 4 is directed to claim a

device is completely covered
under this claim.

It is thus the case of the plaintiff that the base,

membrane, antigens used and the control dots and test dots in
the product of defendant no. 2 are the same as those in the
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 6 of 52

plaintiff’s product. It is also submitted that the fact that the
buffer solution, Protein A Conjugate and/or the plaintiff’s
device can be used interchangeably with those of defendant
no. 2’s buffer solution, Protein A Conjugate and/or the device
establishes infringement of the plaintiff’s patent.
12.

The plaintiff avers that the infringement of its patent by

the defendants is causing immense loss and irreparable
damage to the plaintiff’s rights. It is further averred that
defendant no. 2 had knowledge of the plaintiff’s patent and
that the use of the plaintiff’s invention by defendant no. 2 was
intentional and willful.

The defendants are also stated to be

quoting low prices as compared to the plaintiff.

Thus, the

present suit has been filed with the application therein for an
interim injunction against the defendants.
13.

Defendant no. 2 has contested the present suit filing a

written statement and a counter-claim being CC 2196/2006 on
25.11.2006 for the revocation of the plaintiff’s patent no
194638 under Section 64 of the Patents Act, 1970 (hereinafter
referred to as the ‘said Act’).
14.

The submission made by defendant no. 2 is that it has

been manufacturing and marketing its Hepatitis C Virus
Detection Kit since December 2000. It is claimed that the said
Kits are being manufactured by Defendant no. 2 in accordance
with specifications from Accudx, USA which are in the public
domain and that the manufacturing license had been obtained
by defendant no 2 prior to the plaintiff’s application for the
grant of patent filed on 14.06.2000. It is stated that defendant
no. 2 had obtained the ‘first test and analytical license” to
manufacture the HCV kit on 25.07.1997 and thereafter the
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 7 of 52

second license on 24.02.1999, and the third test license on
27.06.2000.
15.

The invalidity of plaintiff’s patent no. 194638 is alleged

on the grounds of prior publication, prior public knowledge and
use in India, obviousness, not being an invention nor a
patentable invention and lastly on the ground that the
invention has not been sufficiently explained by the plaintiff.
16.

Defendant no. 2 has submitted that the investigation

conducted by the Controller under section 13 of the said Act is
not conclusive on the question of anticipation which principle
has been enunciated in sub section (4) of Section 13 of the
said Act. It is the case of defendant no. 2 that the patent of
the plaintiff is liable to be revoked on the ground of prior
publication established by US Patent nos. 5006464, 5541059
and 5160701. It is contended that the said US patents as also
US patent nos.5008080, 4920046, 5763159 and 5721095 and
international patent no. W096/13590 make the patent claimed
by the plaintiff obvious. It is submitted that each of the
features of the patent specification, namely, the testing device,
buffer

solution

and

the

protein

A

conjugate

function

independently of each other in a known way and thus the
plaintiff’s claims do not constitute an invention under Section
3(f) of the said Act.
17.

It is also the case of defendant no. 2 that as a prior

appeal against the order of the patent controller dated
23.08.2006 is pending and the said order is not to be given
effect to in terms of the order dated 19.10.2006 of this Court,
any act done pursuance to the order dated 23.08.2006 cannot
be given effect to. It is alleged that the plaintiff has
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 8 of 52

approached the court with unclean hands as the fact of the
appeal being filed and the ex parte order therein were not
disclosed by the plaintiff although the appeal had been filed
prior to the present suit. Defendant no. 2 has thus prayed for
the revocation of the patent of the plaintiff.
18.

Insofar as defendant no. 1 is concerned, none entered

appearance on behalf of defendant no. 1 despite service and
the said defendant was proceeded ex parte vide order dated
08.11.2006.
19.

I have heard learned counsels for the parties.

Mention of Plaintiff’s Product in the WHO Report
20.

Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted that

the device of the plaintiff is the only one mentioned in the
report of the WHO dated July 2001.
21.

It was averred by defendant no 2 as regards the WHO

report relied on by the plaintiff that the plaintiff has
misrepresented that the WHO has approved and certified its
product as it does not approve or certify.

Defendant no.2 also

alleges that the plaintiff is wrongly claiming that its product
had the best sensitivity and specificity. It was submitted that
the WHO document of July 2001 has a product by the name of
Serodia HCV which has a better sensitivity and specificity being
100 and 99.5 per cent respectively. The said report contains a
disclaimer that “the mention of specific companies and of
certain manufacturers products does not imply that they are
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of
a similar nature that are not mentioned”.
22.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff however contended

that while defendant no. 2 has averred that other companies
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 9 of 52

were manufacturing products similar to that of the plaintiff
which find mention in the WHO Report, a perusal of the list
would show that there are a number of differences in the
various kits mentioned which is evident from a perusal of the
testing parameters mentioned.

The said report notes that

RIBA HCV 3.0 and InnoLIA HCV are “Strip Immunoblot” tests.
Genedia HCV Rapid, which is an immunofiltration test has a
specificity and sensitivity of 98.4 and 98.5 respectively which
is different from the product of the plaintiff (4th generation)
which has a sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 98.9
respectively. The said report also mentions the 3rd generation
product of the plaintiff HCV Microlisa as having a sensitivity
and specificity of 100 and 97.4 respectively. It was submitted
that the Serodia Test is a ELISA Rapid test in which a
“microlitre

particle

agglutination

assay

is

used

for

the

qualitative detection of the anti-HCV” and the time taken to
obtain results in the said test is 2 hours and 45 minutes.
23.

Learned

counsel

averred

that

the

kit

being

manufactured by defendant no. 2 is not approved by the WHO
and in this behalf referred to the draft report submitted by the
WHO. The said report notes that the final sensitivity and
specificity of the said product is 100 and 98.9 per cent
respectively which is identical to that of the plaintiff's product.
It is also stated that the Phase I evaluation meets the WHO
criteria to proceed to the Phase II level and the same will be
published in the official WHO report of the commercially
available assays to detect the anti-bodies to HCV in human
serum/plasma.

IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 10 of 52

24.

The

plaintiff

placed

reliance

on

a

letter

dated

17.05.2002 on behalf of the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research, Ministry of Science and Technology
addressed to defendant no. 2 to contend that the said
defendant did not have a research and development facility
until as late as 2002. The said letter conveys the accordance of
recognition to the said defendants R&D facility till 31.03.2004.
25.

A perusal of the WHO report of July 2001 shows that the

said report does contain a disclaimer that the WHO is not
recommending or endorsing any of the products mentioned
therein in preference to other products of a similar nature.
However, the report shows that the products mentioned
therein including the plaintiffs HCV Tri-Dot (4th Generation)
have been evaluated and the specificity and sensitivity of the
plaintiff's 4th generation product has been noted to be 98.9 and
100 as claimed by the plaintiff.
26.

The other products mentioned in the WHO report, being

RIBA HCV 3.0 and InnoLIA HCV are “Strip Immunoblot” tests,
Genedia, which is an immunofiltration test has a lower
specificity and sensitivity than that of HCV Tri-dot (4th
Generation). The Serodia HCV test is stated to be a microlitre
particle agglutination assay for the qualitative detection of
Anti-HCV and not an immunofiltration test as is the case with
the plaintiff's product.
27.

The draft report of the WHO in respect of the product of

defendant no. 2 shows that the WHO is in the process of
evaluating the product of the said defendant.
28.

I am of the view that the fact of the plaintiff's 4th

generation product being mentioned in the WHO Report in
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 11 of 52

which the product has been evaluated and its sensitivity and
specificity noted is certainly one of the factors to be taken into
account by this Court.
Habitual infringement
29.

It was contended by learned counsel for the plaintiff

that defendant no. 2 is a habitual infringer and has been
copying the products of the plaintiff and is continuing to do so.
It was stated that defendant no. 2 has filed an opposition in
respect of almost all of the products of the plaintiff namely
HCV Tri-dot (4th Generation), HCV Tri-dot (3rd Generation),
Protein A Conjugate and Buffer Solution. Patent has been
granted in respect of HCV Tri-dot (4th Generation) and HCV Tridot (3rd Generation) and the decision on the objections are
pending as regards the Protein A Conjugate and Buffer
Solution.
30.

Insofar as the claim of the plaintiff that defendant no. 2

is a habitual infringer is concerned, the plaintiff and defendant
no.2 being competitors, such objections are being filed.

It

cannot be said from this material alone that defendant no. 2
has been habitually infringing the patents of the plaintiff.
Suppression of Facts
31.

Learned counsel for defendant no. 2 has taken the plea

that the plaintiff has in its plaint and argument suppressed
certain facts including the appeal filed against the order of the
controller granting patent to the plaintiff and the order dated
19.10.2006 granting stay against the operation of the order of
the Assistant Controller. It is also alleged that the plaintiff has
made no mention of the fact that it was approached by one Mr.
Albert Chu about 8-10 years ago to license the technology
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 12 of 52

related to the invention of the plaintiff or the prior products
being manufactured and sold by EY Laboratories since 1996 as
also their patents being US Patent nos. 5006464 an 5541059.
The fact of the abandonment of the plaintiff’s patent claim in
the US is also alleged to have been suppressed. It was averred
that the plaintiff has been manufacturing and selling a similar
bi-dot product prior to its patent application. Documents
regarding any research done by the plaintiff in the context of
the patented product have not been shown. It is averred that
the PCT search report stating that the application of the
plaintiff is obvious has also been suppressed.
32.

Insofar as the appeal filed against the order dated

23.08.2006 of the Assistant Controller of patents is concerned,
it was submitted by the plaintiff that the appeal was served
upon the plaintiff only on 06.11.2006 while the present suit
was filed on 28.01.2006 and thus the appeal or stay granted
therein was not mentioned. Learned counsel further submitted
that the learned single judge hearing the appeal was not
informed of the grant of patent and registration of the same.
The plaintiff submitted that the order of the Assistant
Controller of patents dismissing the pre-grant opposition of
defendant no. 2 is one under Section 25 (1) of the said Act and
Section 117 A (2) of the said Act provides for appeals to be
filed before the appellate board only against orders under
Section 25 (4) of the said Act which are with regard to
maintaining, amending or revoking a patent i.e., at the post
grant stage. It is also stated that defendant no. 2 has filed a
fresh application on 20.11.2006 seeking stay of the patent
granted in favour of the plaintiff and on 21.11.2006, the
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 13 of 52

learned single judge directed the filing of a reply to the said
application and clarified that the suit may proceed in the
meantime.
33.

In respect of the abandonment of the patent application

in the United States, learned counsel pointed out that the
same has in fact been mentioned during the opening
arguments. It was also submitted that the US patent was filed
for the kit as a whole and not merely the device as in India and
the same was abandoned as it was found not to be
economically viable.
34.

Learned counsel submitted that the aspect of a bi-dot

product being manufactured by the plaintiff was not argued
during the oral submissions. It was also averred that Bi-Dot
relates to a third generation device with a much lower
sensitivity and specificity and is beyond the scope of the
present litigation.
35.

A plea has also been raised that the research and

development documents are confidential in nature and the
final manufacturing licence granted to the plaintiff has been
placed on record.
36.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted in respect of

the PCT report that the said report notes that as far as PCT
Article 33(2) is concerned, Claims 1-13 of the plaintiff meet the
criteria set out therein as the prior art does not anticipate the
diagnostic kit as claimed. The said claims are also stated to
meet the criteria in Article 33 (4) of the PCT as the claimed the
diagnostic kit can be used to detect antibodies to Hepatitis C in
human serum and plasma. It was also submitted that the PCT

IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 14 of 52

application

claiming

priority

was

directed

towards

the

complete kit as per the claims originally filed.
37.

Insofar as the concealment of fact of the appeal filed

against the order dated 23.08.2006 of the Patent Controller is
concerned, it has been pointed out by learned counsel for the
plaintiff that the summons in the same were served on the
plaintiff only on 6.11.2006 while the present suit was filed on
28.01.2006 and thus the same has not been stated in the
plaint.

This aspect however finds mention in the written

statement to the counter claim. The fact thus could not have
been mentioned in the appeal. While it is the plea of the
plaintiff that appeals under Section 117 A of the said Act can
be filed only against orders under Section 25 (4) of the said
Act, it may be noticed that prior to the amendment of the said
Act vide the Patents Amendment Act, 2005, to the provisions
inter alia of Section 117 A (2), which came into force from
2.04.2007, appeal could be brought against any order of the
Controller under section 25. Be that as it may, these aspects
are to be considered by the Appellate Court. The order dated
21.11.2006 of the Appellate Court had clarified that the
proceedings in the present suit may continue.
38.

It was mentioned in the oral submissions in respect of

the American Patent Application of the plaintiff that the same
had been abandoned.
39.

As regards the bi-dot product of the plaintiff, a perusal

of the literature placed on record shows that the same is
stated to be a a third generation product. The antigens stated
to be used are highly purified recombinant antigens for Core,
NS3, NS4 and NS5. the results are stated to be obtained within
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 15 of 52

5 minutes. While the bi-dot product is stated to utilise a unique
combination of the said antigens, the proportions have not
been specified. The specificity and sensitivity of the product
are stated to be 1020/1022 EIA negative sera and 312/312
positive sera respectively.

Further, the product is stated to be

a third generation product which as transpired during the oral
submissions detect antibodies if present for more than one
month while the fourth generation product detects antibodies if
present for 15 days. Thus, the fourth generation devices are an
improvement over third generation devices as far as this
aspect is concerned.
40.

Insofar as the aspect of the documents showing

research conducted by the plaintiff are concerned, i am of the
view that sufficient material has been placed on record by the
parties for a prima facie consideration of the case. These
aspects may thus be considered during the trial.
41.

A

perusal

of

the

PCT

International

Preliminary

Examination Report shows that it also notes that the said
claims 1-13 of the plaintiff’s application lack inventive step
under PCT Article 33(3). It is observed in the said report that
claims 1-13 lack an inventive step under PCT Article 33 (3) as
being obvious over US patent Nos. 4,962,023, 5,008,080, and
5,958,790 each of which disclose a kit comprising a multi-layer
test device that includes one or more test areas that can be
coated with one or more antigens for the assay of antibodies in
a sample and each discloses a colloidal gold label for the
visualization of antigen antibody complexes as well as Protein
A for the capture of IgG. The said report objects to certain
individual claims on grounds of lack of clarity as the claims are

indefinite.

The International Search Report states that the

claimed invention cannot be considered to involve an inventive
step when the document is combined with one or more
documents of particular relevance, such combination being
obvious to a person skilled in the art.

It may be useful to

reproduce the relevant provisions of PCT Article 33 which are
as under:
“Article 33
1. The objective of the international preliminary
examination is to formulate a preliminary and
non-binding opinion on the questions whether
the claimed invention appears to be novel, to
involve an inventive step (to be non-obvious),
and to be industrially applicable.
2. For the purposes of the international preliminary
examination, a claimed invention shall be
considered novel if it is not anticipated by the
prior art as defined in the Regulations.
3. For the purposes of the international preliminary
examination, a claimed invention shall be
considered to involve an inventive step if, having
regard to the prior art as defined in the
Regulations, it is not, at the prescribed relevant
date, obvious to a person skilled in the art.
4. For the purposes of the international preliminary
examination, a claimed invention shall be
considered industrially applicable if, according to
its nature, it can be made or used (in the
technological sense) in any kind of industry.
"Industry" shall be understood in its broadest
sense, as in the Paris Convention for the
Protection of Industrial Property….”

42.

The PCT preliminary examination report indicates that

claims 1-13 of the plaintiff lack an inventive step but are novel
and can be considered industrially applicable. It may however
be noticed that the said report is in respect of the diagnostic
kit of the plaintiff. Furthermore, Article 33 (1) of the PCT states
that “the objective of the international preliminary examination
is to formulate a preliminary and non binding opinion on the
aspects

of

The

International Search Report (7th Nov. 2002) is again with regard
to the “Diagnostic Kit for Invitro detection of Hepatitis C”. The
said International Preliminary Examination Report thus cannot
be said to have much bearing in considering the validity of the
patent.
Presumption of Validity
43.

Defendant no. 2 argued that the mere grant or sealing

of a patent or decision rendered by the Controller on an
opposition filed does not imply the validity of the patent. In this
behalf, learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of the
Apex Court in Bishwanath Prasad Radhey Shyam v. Hindustan
Metal Industries PTC (Suppl.) (1) 731 (SC) wherein it was
observed that the grant and sealing of the patent or the
decision of the Controller on the opposition application does
not guarantee the validity of the patent and the same can be
challenged before the High Court on various grounds in
infringement proceedings. This position is expressly provided
by Section 13 (4) of the said Act.

Again in Standipack Private

Ltd. & Ors v. Oswal Trading Co. Ltd & Ors 1999 PTC (19) 479
(Del), learned single judge (as he then was) noted that the
Delhi High Court has held in an infringement act relating to a
patent, the plaintiff has to make a prima facie case about the
existence of a monopoly right and its infringement by the
defendant.

The court must look at the whole case of the

patentee and the strength of the defence under Sections 107
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 18 of 52

and 64 of the said Act.

It has also been observed that no

presumption of validity attaches to a patent granted by the
Controller under the Act notwithstanding examination and
investigation made under sections 12 and 13.
44.

It was averred by learned counsel for the plaintiff

however that as the pre-grant opposition filed by defendant no.
2 had been dismissed by a technical body, at least at the
interlocutory stage there cannot be presumption against the
validity of the patent and the presumption of validity could be
dislodged only at the stage of trial. It was submitted that the
entire process of opposition and the final decision on the same
would have a significant bearing on the validity of the patent
as the patent of the plaintiff would have been rigorously
examined by the patent office as specified in the said Act and
the process of grant of patent being a long and tedious one, it
would be evidence of the fact of a prima facie finding of an
expert body that the invention is a valid one. The grounds of
examination include ‘anticipation’. Learned counsel referred to
the provisions of the said act to point out the procedure
followed for scrutiny and examination. It was also submitted
that section 13 (4) of the said Act is only a statutory
indemnification.
45.

Learned counsel referred to the provisions of Sections

11-13 of the said Act to highlight the process of scrutiny of
patent

application

and

section

14

Further

Rule 55 of the Patents Rules, 2003 provides the procedure with

Controller that the

invention has been anticipated in the

manner provided by the said act,

shows

to

the

satisfaction of the Controller that the priority date of the claim
of the complete specification is not later than the date on
which the relevant document was published or the applicant
amends his complete specification to the satisfaction of the
controller. A reference was also made to the

grounds of

revocation under Section 64 available and the provisions of
Section 107 of the said Act which provides that every ground
on which a patent may be revoked under under section 64
shall be available as a defence in a suit for infringement.
46.

Learned counsel also submitted that while a pre-grant

opposition under the said Act can be filed by any person, a
post grant opposition can be filed only by a “person interested”
which includes a “person engaged in, or in promoting, research
in the same field as that to which the invention relates”
[Section 2(q)].
47.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff placed reliance on the

judgment in M/s National Research Development Corporation
of India, New Delhi v. M/s The Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co
Ltd and Others AIR 1980 Delhi 132 wherein a learned single
judge of this Court observed that if the patent is sufficiently
old and has been worked, the court would for the purpose of
temporary injunction, presume the patent to be a valid one
and if the patent is more than six years old, and there has
been actual user, it would be safe for the court to proceed
upon this presumption. It was thus submitted that as the
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 20 of 52

patent in the present case is six years old, the validity of the
same must be presumed.

The said judgments have been

considered in the judgment of a division bench of this court in
Telemechanique & Controls (I) Ltd. v. Schneider Electric
Industries SA 94 (2001) DLT 865 (DB).
48.

A perusal of the provisions of sections 11-12 of the said

Act shows that where a request for examination is made by an
applicant or person interested, the examiner is to make a
report in respect of whether the application, specification and
other documents meet the requirements of the said Act and
rules, whether there is a lawful ground of objection to the grant
of patent under the Act, the result of the investigations on the
ground of anticipation and other matters that may be
prescribed. Further Section 13 requires the examiner to make
an

investigation

into

whether

the

invention

claimed

is

anticipated by publication before the date of filing of the
applicant's complete specification in any specification filed in
pursuance of an application for a patent made in India or
whether the invention is claimed in the claim of any other
complete specification published on or after the date of filing of
the applicant's complete specification being a specification
filed in pursuance of an application for a patent made in India
and dated before or claiming a priority date earlier than that
date. The examiner is also required to make an investigation
as to whether the invention has been anticipated in any
publication in India or elsewhere in any other document.
Section 13(4) however provides that such examinations or
investigations are not to be deemed to warrant the validity of
any patent. Rule 55 of the Patents Rules, 2003 requires the
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 21 of 52

examiner to consider the statement and evidence filed by the
applicant and in case a hearing is requested, to consider the
representation and submissions made and thereafter give a
decision as to whether the patent is to be granted, refused or
the complete specification be amended.
49.

It is well settled as held in the decisions in Bishwanath

Prasad Radhey Shyam and Standipack Private Ltd. cases
(supra) that the grant of a patent alone does not give rise to a
presumption of validity of the patent notwithstanding the
examination

and

inspection

carried

out

by

the

Patent

Controller and the validity of the patent can be challenged in
infringement proceedings on the same grounds on which
revocation can be claimed under Section 64 of the said Act.
Section 13 (4) of the said Act provides inter alia,

that the

examination and investigation conducted shall not be deemed
in anyway to warrant the validity of the patent. The decision
on the opposition application also does not imply the validity of
the patent.
50.

The decision in M/s National Research Development

Corporation of India case (supra) is to the effect that where a
patent has been in existence for sufficiently long and has been
worked, for the purposes of temporary injunction at least the
court can presume the same to be valid.
51.

Although the examiner looks into various aspects and

makes a rigorous examination of the patent application and
opposition thereto, in view of the decisions in

Bishwanath

Prasad Radhey Shyam and Standipack Private Ltd cases
(supra), the order of the patent controller granting the patent
and the decision on the opposition cannot of itself give rise to a
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 22 of 52

presumption of validity of the patent notwithstanding the
investigation and examination made and the same can be
challenged. Insofar as the decision in M/s National Research
Development Corporation of India case (supra) is concerned
while the actual user and duration of the patent may be one of
the factors that may be taken into account, I am of the view
that that factor alone cannot give rise to a presumption of
validity of the patent . This Court would thus have to look into
the merits of the case of the plaintiff as also the defence put
forth by the defendant.
Prior knowledge and use of technology by Defendant no. 2
52.

It is the case of defendant no. 2 that it has been

manufacturing

the

impugned

product

according

to

specifications provided by AccuDx USA. It was submitted that
the said defendant had entered into a technology transfer
agreement on 31.07.1997 with AccuDx in respect of the device
comprising a base, absorbent pad made of nitrocellulose
material, an immunofiltration membrane and a top cover
having a central hole.

The reagents in the kit are stated to

include Buffer solution, Colloidal solution, Protein A Conjugate
and Anti-Human IgG and the agreement is stated to deal with
both ‘flow through’ and ‘Elisa’ Device.
53.

Insofar as the aspect that only three antigens are

mentioned in the technology transfer agreement is concerned,
it is the submission of defendant no. 2 that the technology with
AccuDx pertaining to antigens was not advanced and the
defendant learned from and purchased the antigens from one
Devaron, Inc, USA. Learned counsel referred to an email sent
to defendant no. 2 regarding shipments sent to the said
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 23 of 52

defendant. One of the products mentioned is “DEV 21-25 (Cat#
301-21-25-2)” which includes HCV Core, NS3, NS4 and NS5.
54.

Learned counsel submitted that while the plaintiff has

taken the stand that it is the combination and ratio of the
antigens which is the subject matter of the patent, the
proportion of antigens has not been mentioned in the patent
document. Learned counsel alleged that the plaintiff has been
changing its stance as regards the antigens used in the
patented product. While initially it was argued by the plaintiff
that the antigens used are new, the stand was changed later
that the antigens are not disputed but the combination,
proportion and ratio is the subject matter of the patent.
55.

The submission of the plaintiff that the documents do

not relate to the product in question has also been disputed by
defendant no. 2 and it was averred that the brochures and
materials attached to the licences and applications explain the
technology being used by defendant no. 2 which is the same
as is being used in the impugned product.

In this behalf,

reference was made to the applications stated to be filed by
defendant no. 2 for the grant of the licences. The first
application dated 26.04.1997 is with respect to the “SIGNAL
Flow Through anti-HCV Test Kit for in-vitro detection of
antibodies in the Hepatitis C virus”. The said kit is stated to
consist of a “plastic cassette containing a membrane spotted
separately with synthetic & recombinant HCV peptide and AntiHuman Immunoglobin”; and a wash buffer, signal reagent,
negative control. The annexures to the application also detail
the procedure of manufacturing the said components and the
specificity and sensitivity of the product is estimated to be 100
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 24 of 52

per cent. However, there is no mention of the specific antigens
used. Another application dated 17.07.1997 with regard to the
said product for the grant of permission for manufacture of the
said product for examination, test or analysis. The draft labels
stated to be attached to the application include the label for
the SIGNAL HCV Flow- Through Anti-HCV Spot/ Immunodot Test
Kit”. In respect of this application, a letter dated 25.07.1997
was

sent

on

behalf

of

the

Food

and

Drugs

Control

Administration granting the licence up to 24.07.1998. A third
application is stated to have been sent on 17.02.1999 for the
manufacture of products including the “Signal Flow through
Anti-HCV Spot Immunodot Test Kit” for examination, test or
analysis.

Licence in respect of this application was granted

vide a letter dated 24.02.1999. A request for evaluation of the
“Signal HCV Flow Through Anti-HCV spot immunodot test kit” is
stated

to

have

been

made

vide

an

application

dated

06.03.2000. On 27.06.2000 again licence was granted to
Defendant no. 2 in respect of another application filed by the
said defendant on 12.06.2000 for a licence for examination,
test or analysis.
56.

It is stated that defendant no. 2 was able to obtain the

commercial licence and commenced manufacture of the said
product in December 2000.

In support of this submission,

reference was made to invoices. An invoice dated 18.12.2000
mentions “Signal Flow Through HCV”.
57.

It is averred that as the specification filed by the

plaintiff on 14.06.2000 was incomplete and the complete
specifications were filed only on 14.06.2001, defendant no. 2
could not have copied the patented product as the same was
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 25 of 52

being exported by them since 2000. Defendant no. 2 claims to
have obtained knowledge of the product only after it was
published in 2004 after which an opposition was filed. Learned
counsel averred that while the plaintiff has claimed that it
commenced the sales of its product in June or July 2000, no
documents have been filed in support of the claim. Also, no
documents have been filed showing any research conducted
towards developing the said product.
58.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff however, referred to

the patent specification to contend that the ratio of the
antigens used had been set out therein which is as under:

59.

“The said antigens can be mixed taking
Core: 40- 60 nannogram
NS3: 100-150 nannogram
NS4: 150-200 nannogram
NS5: 150-200 nannogram”
Insofar as the contention of defendant no 2 that it is

manufacturing its product based on technology obtained from
AccuDx is concerned, it is the submission of the plaintiff that
the device of AccuDx uses only two antigens being NS3 and
Core while the plaintiff’s device employs 4 antigens. It was also
alleged by the plaintiff that the argument was an afterthought
and the technology transfer agreement had not been placed
on record at the first instance and was placed on record only
with the replication to the written statement to the counter
claim. Moreover the said agreement relates to ELISA tests and
the manner in which dots appear in defendant no. 2’s device is
different from the device of AccuDx. The clause in the said
technology transfer agreement on its “Scope” mentions the
“production protocol of HCV Elisa Tests”. It was submitted

IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 26 of 52

without prejudice that the defendant can follow the technology
of AccuDx which is different from the product of the plaintiff.
60.

In response to defendant no. 2’s argument that it had

imported the mixture of antigens from Devaron, it was
submitted by the plaintiff that it is the combination, proportion
and ratio of the said antigens which is the subject matter of the
said patent.
61.

In respect of the application for manufacturing licence of

defendant no. 2 is concerned, it was averred by the plaintiff
that the application filed in 1997 was a general application for
a device and the product being manufactured by the said
defendant now is completely different from the product in
respect of which the application was filed.
62.

documents for its other devices. The device in respect of which
the plaintiff has a grievance is the HCV Signal Rapid Device
and not the other types of devices namely the HCV Comb Test
and the HCV Elisa Test also available for the diagnosis of the
Hepatitis C Virus. It is thus alleged that the documents
submitted by defendant no.2 reveals that the applications and
approvals for different products have been intermingled.
63.

Learned counsel urged that the said defendant had not

pleaded any knowledge of technology of the product in the
present case at any time in the entire opposition proceedings
before the patent office. The plaintiff avers that the plea that
defendant no. 2 has been manufacturing the impugned device
since 1997 was not taken before the patent controller in the
said proceedings. It was also submitted that there has no
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 27 of 52

whisper in the pre-grant opposition to either the technology of
AccuDx being used or to the applications dated 26.02.1997 or
17.07.1997 and the same appear to be an afterthought.
64.

The plaintiff has also alleged that there are a number of

discrepancies in the documents filed.

A table of the alleged

discrepancies has been filed by the plaintiff which is as under:

A reference was made to the inspection report (National

Institute of Biologicals, March 1999) in respect of the products
of defendant no. 2 which includes the “Signal HCV Flow
Through Anti HCV Spot Immunodot test kit” to contend that the
product is a spot test on a strip. The said report mentions that
“the spot test strip for HIV, HbSAg and HCV has been designed
in a way that the spots appearing on the strip after the test are
not permanently fixed and may fade away or disappear after
some time”. Learned counsel also referred to the final
manufacturing and marketing approval (11-12-2000) granted

IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 28 of 52

to defendant no. 2 to submit that the same was also subject to
conditions.
66.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that no device

would take a period of three years for the requisite approvals.
It was also averred that the fact that the draft report of the
defendant followed the defendant’s kit only in 2000 after one
of the senior employees of the plaintiff involved in the
manufacture of the said product had joined defendant no. 2 in
May 2001 shows that the said defendant did not possess the
technology in 1997. Further, the application for manufacturing
permission was first made on 30.11.2000 but the licence was
not filed on record and the manufacturing permission was filed
only after an objection was taken in the written statement to
the counter claim. It was also submitted that the sales figures
filed by defendant no. 2 are since December 2000.
67.

Learned

counsel

for

the

plaintiff

alleged

that

the

literature attached with the final application filed before the
Drug Controller appears to be an afterthought and the same
does not bear signatures as in all the other annexures attached
to the application filed before the patent controller.
68.

A reading of the technology transfer agreement dated

31.07.1997 shows that as per the scope of the agreement set
out therein, AccuDx is stated to have information regarding
“critical areas related to the manufacturing of immunofiltration
based diagnostic kits”. The example with regard to Hepatitis C
diagnostic Kits provided includes the device, single solution
blocking/wash buffer, formulation of colloidal gold conjugate
diluent, antigen mixture, large scale production and production
protocol of HCV Elisa tests. The description of final product
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 29 of 52

(HCV Spot Assay) states that it is “an immunofiltration assay
with over 99.5 % sensitivity and specificity” and having a
filtration device with recombiant NS3, NS4 and Core proteins of
HCV, procedure control spot containing anti-human IgG, FC
fragment, wash buffer, colloidal gold protein A conjugates etc.
The brochure of Hep C Spot Hepatitis C (HCV) Rapid Test
(which has been developed by AccuDx) states in the “principle
of the assay” that the recombinant proteins corresponding to
NS3 and Core of Hepatitis C are bound to the membranes of
the filtration device. The said agreement thus mentions only
three antigens being Core, NS3 and NS4 and the said Hep C
Spot Device appears to utilize only two antigens (NS3 and
Core) unlike the device of the plaintiff on which a mixture of
four antigens are used. Moreover, a perusal of the notice of
opposition of defendant no.

2 to the plaintiff's patent

application shows that the agreement with AccuDx has not
been mentioned therein.
69.

Although the reagent stated to be imported by defendant

no.2 from Devaron, Inc.. Dev 21-25 (Cat# 301-21-25-2)
contains all four antigens i.e., Core, NS3, NS4 and NS5, the
combination in which the said antigens have been mixed has
not been specified.

The particular proportion in which the

antigens have mixed is specified in the patent specification of
the plaintiff and appears to be one of the salient features of
the plaintiffs invention.
70.

A comparison of the applications dated 26.04.1997,

17.07.1997 and 30.11.2000 that there are certain distinctions.
In the items contained in kit. While the applications dated
26.04.1997 and 17.07.1997 the include positive control and
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 30 of 52

negative control in the kits, the Kit in the application dated
30.11.2000 does not contain the said two reagents. The initial
applications do not mention the antigens used while the
application dated 30.11.2000 mentions the combination of
Core, NS3, NS4 and NS5 antigens. The product with respect to
which applications have been filed by defendant no. 2 thus
appears to have undergone certain changes from the date of
the initial application on 24.04.1997. Another aspect to be
taken note of is that the inspection report of the National
Institute of Biologicals with regard to the device of defendant
no.2 mentions the “spot test strip” which indicates that the
device has also undergone certain changes. The device thus
currently being manufactured by defendant no. 2 cannot be
said to be the same as the one in respect of which licences
were sought in 1997. The device of the defendant as well as
the antigens used and the use of colloidal gold protein A as
well as the items included in the kit of the said defendant has
undergone changes since the initial applications for licences
were filed. The agreement with AccuDx also does not refer to
the combination of antigens now being used by the said
defendant. Defendant no 2 cannot thus plead that they have
been manufacturing a similar device since the year 1997 and
that they had knowledge of the technology prior to the patent
application of the plaintiff.
Prior Publication and Obviousness
71. Learned counsel for defendant no. 2 submitted that prior
publications being US patent Nos. 5,006,464 and 5,541,059
establish that the product in respect of which the plaintiff has
obtained a patent was known in the art.
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 31 of 52

72. US patent no 5,006,464 is in respect of “Directed Flow
Diagnostic Device and Method”. It is stated to be “an improved
method for analyte assay in liquid samples, wherein a porous
membrane with an immobilized receptor which Is capable of
directly or indirectly binding to the analyte is separated from a
body of absorbent material capable of absorbing the liquid
sample by a septum capable of substantially separating the
porous membrane from the absorbent body while substantially
directing the flow of the liquid sample from the porous
membrane

to

the

absorbent

body”.

Learned

counsel

contended that the device of the plaintiff contains the same
physical elements except the ‘septum’ and nothing has been
mentioned in the plaintiff’s specification as to the effect of non
use of the septum. It is stated that the device mentioned in the
patent can be used for a number of diseases including
Hepatitis A and B. It was however submitted that Hepatitis C
had not been mentioned as the same had not been discovered
at the time of the patent.
73. In this regard, it was submitted by the plaintiff that the
device of the plaintiff is of a different construction and function
and is not anticipated by US Patent No. 5,006,464. The said
patent is in relation to a device that can be used to make a
diagnostic kit for the treatment of various diseases listed in the
patent specification of the said patent and does not relate to
any specific disease. The said device employs a directed flow
and uses a separating septum with a hole to direct the flow of
the liquid while the plaintiff’s device employs a rapid flow
through system. In this behalf, a reference was also made to
the letter of Mr. Albert Chu (18.04.2007), the owner of the said
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 32 of 52

patent. It is stated in the said letter that there are many
companies using the lateral flow techniques in India but “the
direct flow from J Mitra still dominates the whole India market”.
It was thus contended that the non use of the septum in the
plaintiff’s device makes it different from the said US patent and
the manner of flow of the liquid is different. A reference was
also made to the decision of the learned Assistant Patent
Controller on the pre-grant opposition of defendant no. 2
wherein it was observed with regard to US Patent no. 5006464
that
“As can be understood from the claims of USA
specification 5006464, it is a device for analyte
assay in liquid samples comprising a porous
membrane with an immobilized receptor capable of
binding the analyte and separated from a body of
absorbent material capable of separating the porous
membrane from the absorbent body while directing
the flow of the liquid sample from the porous
membrane to the absorbent body.

74.

The device of the impugned patent application has
altogether different construction and function to
perform. Therefore, I disagree with the contention of
the Opponent that US Patent No. 5006464
anticipates the impugned application.”
Learned counsel for defendant no. 2 submitted that US

Patent 5,54,1059 which is in respect of an “Immunoassay
Device Having an Internal Control of Protein A and methods of
using the same” mentions the use of the control dot in an
immunoassay device with the help of colloidal gold, Protein A
Conjugate and Anti-Human IgG; the use of one or more test
dots on which antigens are coated and the use of known
antigens for the detection of various diseases. The said patent
mentions the Hepatitis C Virus.
75.

In respect of US Patent no. 5,54,1059, the plaintiff

contended that the said device also used a septum and the

IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 33 of 52

ratio in which antigens were used in the said device was not
disclosed. The said device again is a general one which can be
used to manufacture test devices for various diseases. It was
also contended that the manner of flow as well as the manner
in which dots appear in the said device are different from that
of the plaintiff’s product.

A reference was made to the

description of drawings in the patent document to contend that
the manner of coating and bars employed in the said US patent
make the device different. The description is as under:
“BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
FIG.1 shows the members surface of an
immunoassay device having a circular control
substance area and a circular antigen area.
FIG.2 shows the membrane surface of an
immunoassay device having a bar-shaped
control substance area and two separate
antigen areas on either side of the control
substance area.
FIG.3 shows the membrane surface of an
immunoassay device having a circular rim of
control substance and an antigen area within
the circular rim.
FIG.4 shows the membrane surface of an
immunoassay device having a dotted circular

vertical bars of a first and second antigen.
FIG.6 shows the membrane surface of an
Immunoassay device having a horizontal bar of
control substance and a vertical bar of antigen.

76.

FIG.7 shows the membrane surface of an
immunoassay device having a central capture
antibody area, an upper antigen area, and a
lower control substance area. “
In respect of US patent No. 5541059, the Patent

Controller in the opposition proceedings observed that the
same

“relates

to

an

analytical

IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

device

for

use

in

an

Page No. 34 of 52

immunoassay for the detection of a first analyte antibody in a
liquid sample comprising a permeable membrane. This device
is in no way define the construction of the impugned
invention”.
77.

The specification of US Patent No. 5006464 shows that

the same is a device and method for analyte assay in liquid
samples

wherein a septum separates a porous membrane

with an immobilized receptor which is capable of directly or
indirectly binding to the analyte from a body of absorbent
material capable of absorbing into a liquid sample. The
“disclosure of the invention” notes that the septum is typically
in the form of a sheet having one or more selected ports
capable of substantially separating the porous membrane from
the absorbent body while directing the flow of the liquid
sample from the membrane to the absorbent body. The
septum thus appears to have the effect of directing the flow of
the sample. The plaintiff's device does not contain a septum
and the manner of flow therein is not a directed flow. The letter
of Mr. Albert Chu mentions that the “direct flow from J Mitra”
still dominates the market. However, the specific product has
not been mentioned.

However,

from

a reading of the

specifications, it prima facie appears that there are differences
in the manner of flow adopted in the two devices. The impact
of such difference in manner of flow is not clear and would
have to be examined during the course of the trial.
78.

Insofar as US Patent 5,541,059 is concerned, a perusal of

the claims show that the said patent is in respect of a device
and methods employing non antibody control substances. The
device comprises a solid phase with a permeable membrane
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 35 of 52

having a lower surface and upper surface. The antigens and
non antibody control substances are coated on different areas
on the surface. There is thus no mixture of antigens used as is
used in the plaintiffs device. The construction of the device
also appears to be different from that of the plaintiff's device.
79.

Thus, it cannot be said at least prima facie that the

plaintiff's device is anticipated by US patent nos. 5006464 and
5541059.
Similar Products being manufactured by Third Parties
80.

It was averred by Defendant no. 2 that a product namely

HCV Scan similar to the product of the plaintiff and the
impugned product of the defendant is manufactured by one EY
laboratories, the CEO of which is one Mr. Albert Chu who is the
owner of US Patent nos. 5,006,464 and 5,541,059. Another
product HCV Spot is being manufactured by the said EY
Industries through one Gene Lab. The products are stated to
have been in the market since 1996 and 1995 respectively.
81.

The HCV Scan is stated to be “a rapid, simple, qualitative

test for the detection of antibodies to Hepatitis C Virus, in
human serum or plasma” and is intended to be used only as an
initial screening test.
82.

Learned counsel also placed reliance on a letter dated

7.04.2007 written by Mr. Albert Chu to defendant no. 2 stating
that he had met the head manager of the plaintiff 8-10 years
ago and asked him to licence the patent of EY Laboratories but
was ignored. It is also stated that HCV Spot was introduced into
India by Gene lab and the product was copied by the plaintiff.
In the said letter it is claimed that EY laboratories is the first
company to have developed the rapid test using gold colloidal
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 36 of 52

in mid 1980. The lateral flow and reversible flow device are
also stated to have been developed by defendant no. 2.
Learned counsel submitted that Mr. Albert Chu had also
alleged that the plaintiff had infringed his patents.
83.

Learned counsel also referred to the brochure for Murex

anti-HCV (Version III) which is stated to be a rapid enzyme
immunoassay for the detection of antibodies to Hepatitis C
Virus in human serum or plasma. The said test is stated to
utilize

antigens

from

the

putative

core

(C,structural),

Protease/helicase (NS3, non structural), NS4 (non structural)
and replicase (NS5) regions of the virus to provide a sensitive
diagnostic test. The components of the said test include
antigen coated wells (one plate or five plates each made up of
12 strips of eight wells coated with purified HCV antigens),
sample diluent, Negative Control, Anti-HCV Positive Control,
Conjugate Diluent (buffer containing inorganic sales and
protein with 0.05 % Bronidox) and Conjugate (freeze dried
horseradish peroxidase labeled mouse monoclonal antibody to
human IgG in a protein base) .
84.

Another document pertains to UBI-HCV, EIA which is

again stated to be “an immunoassay which employs synthetic
peptides for the detection of antibodies to HCV in human
serum or plasma”. It is stated that the UBI HCV EIA employs an
immunoabsorbent,

which

consists

of

synthetic

peptides

corresponding to highly antigenic segments or core NS3, NS4
and NS5 regions of the hepatitis C virus, bound to the wells of
the microplate. The reagent components include specimen
diluent, anti-HCV non-reactive control, Anti HCV Weakly
Reactive

Control,

Microplates, Wash Buffer Concentrates, Conjugate Diluent,
OPD (O-Phenylenediamine-2HCl), OPD Diluent, Stop Solution,
and Dilution microplates.
85.

A reference was also made to a brochure of “Hepatitis C

Virus Encoded Antigen Ortho ELISA Test System with Enhanced
Sample Added Verification”. In the said test three recombinant
Hepatitis C virus encoded antigens are stated to be used
namely c22-3, c20G and NS5.
86.

Another document relied upon is of Innogenetics NV

which is with regard to INNOTEST HCV AbIV. The objective of
INNOGENETICS is stated to be to design a 4th generation assay
with increased sensitivity for Core, NS3 and NS4 antibodies
using HCV antigens with improved reactivity, and antigens
derived from the most prevalent HCV genotypes. In the said
test the antigens are stated to be derived from the Core (2
different epitope clusters), NS3, NS4A, NS4B, as well as NS 5A
regions.
87.

Learned counsel for defendant no. 2 thus submitted that

the features of the plaintiff’s patent being a base, an absorbent
pad of Cellulosic material, an immunofiltration membrane
having coatings of homogenous mixture of different HCV
Recombiant antigens, a top cover fitted to the base having a
central hole and two test dots and a control dot are clearly
understood from the US patent nos. 5,006,464 and 5,541,059
and HCV Scan and HCV Spot which are products of EY
Laboratories.
88.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff, submitted in respect of

the products HCV Scan and HCV Spot that the said products

IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 38 of 52

use a different type of flow through mechanism from that of
the plaintiffs product.
89.

The contention of the plaintiff in respect of the “Murex

Anti-HCV” Test that the same is an ELISA test and is an
immunoabsorbent linked assay while the plaintiff's test is not
an enzyme linked immunoassay. Learned counsel submitted
that the UBI HCV is also an enzyme linked immunoabsorbent
assay.

As regards the “Hepatitis C virus encoded antigen

(Ortho Elisa)”, it was contended that the same is also an Elisa
test and is also an enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay. In
the Elisa test the substrate and conjugate are to be used to
give the desired results and the test takes two hours to be
completed.
90.

In respect of the Innogentics test, learned counsel

submitted that the same was in respect of an ELISA test and
not a flow through test which is the case in the present patent.
91.

The brochure in respect of HCV SCAN shows that it

comprises HCV Scan device, non reactive control, strong
reactive control, weak reactive control gold conjugate, diluent,
blocking buffers, wash buffers and stop solution. The brochure
does not mention the antigens used in the product.
92.

A reading of the brochure of Murex anti-HCV (Version III)

test shows that it is an enzyme linked immunoassay and in the
said test, the diluted sample is incubated in microwells coated
with highly purified antigens containing sequences from
putative Core, NS3, NS4 and NS5 regions of HCV.

The

structure of the device appears to be different from that of the
plaintiffs device and the process involves three periods of
incubation which is not required in the plaintiff's test. The
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 39 of 52

reagents used include a positive control and negative control
besides the antigen coated wells, sample diluent, conjugate
diluent and conjugate.

A stop solution is also used. The

plaintiffs device is not an enzyme linked test and does not
require incubation. The positive control, and negative control
are not used in the plaintiffs device.
93.

As regards the UBI-HCV test, the same is again an

enzyme linked immuno assay unlike the plaintiffs device. The
said test employs the anti-HCV non-reactive control, Anti HCV
Weakly Reactive Control, Anti HCV Strongly reactive Control,
Microplates, Wash Buffer Concentrates, Conjugate Diluent,
OPD (O-Phenylenediamine-2HCl), OPD Diluent, Stop Solution,
and Dilution microplates. Also, the said test is an ELISA Test.
The process includes incubation for 30 minutes and thereafter
again for 15 minutes each at two stages. The microplates, Anti
HCV Weakly Reactive Control, Anti HCV Strongly reactive
Control, stop solution etc are not part of the plaintiff's device.
The Plaintiff's test is a rapid test.
94.

The “Hepatitis C Virus Encoded Antigen Ortho ELISA Test

System with Enhanced Sample Added Verification” relied on by
defendant no. 2 is an ELISA test as the name itself indicates
and uses

c22-3, c20G and NS5 antigens and thus the said

product cannot be said to anticipate the plaintiff's product
which is a rapid flow through test using Core, NS3, NS4, and
NS5 antigens.
95.

The INNOTEST HCV AbIV which is a 4 th generation test is

an ELISA test and not a rapid test as is the case with the
plaintiff's device.

IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 40 of 52

96.

Thus, the product of the plaintiff is different from the

products being manufactured by third parties referred to being
Murex Anti-HCV, the UBI-HCV test, INNOTEST HCV AbIV and
Hepatitis C Virus Encoded Antigen Ortho ELISA Test which
contain different components from that of the plaintiffs product
and are Elisa tests and cannot be said to be anticipated by the
said products.
Mosaicing
97.

The plaintiff has averred that the attempt by defendant

no. 2 by citing a number of citations constitutes mosaicing. In
this behalf a reference was made to Terrell on Patents
(sixteenth Ed., 2006) wherein it has been observed with regard
to mosaicing that
“The mosaicing of individual documents or prior uses is
not permissible, unless it can be shown that the skilled
person, confronted with a particular citation, would turn
to some other citation to supplement the information
from the first. Whether he would do so is a question of
fact. Lord Reid said in Technograph v. Mills and Rockley
[1972] R.P.C 346 at page 355:

98.

‘When dealing with obviousness, unlike
novelty, it is permissible to make a
‘mosaic’ out of the relevant documents,
but it must be a mosaic which can be put
together by an contention unimaginative
man with no inventive capacity’.”
Learned counsel for the plaintiff also placed reliance on

the order dated 23.08.2006 of the patent controller wherein it
has been observed that “the contention of the Opponents to
prove the ground of obviousness by way of mosaic of citations
in absence of detailed discussion is not acceptable as none of
the documents is relevant to the said invention”.
99.

In the decision of this court in Billcare Ltd. v. Amartara

Pvt. Ltd 2007 (34) PTC 419 (Del), it was observed in respect of
mosaicing that it would not a be a defence of the defendant to

IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 41 of 52

show that the various integers were already known separately
and the combination thereof cannot be patented as it would
amount to mosaicing which is not permissible for determining
the validity of the patent.
100.

It was submitted by learned counsel for defendant no. 2,

on the other hand, that the

documents on which the said

defendant has relied do not amount to mosaicing and if a
person skilled in the art were to read the US patents, he would
be able to come out with the device in respect of which patent
has been obtained by the plaintiff. Learned counsel contended
that by a reading of US patent no 5541059, any skilled person
would be able to learn about a device comprising a base,
absorbent pad, an immunofiltration membrane and top cover
with a hole having a multiple coating on the membrane; use of
a control dot with the help of colloidal gold, Protein A
Conjugate and anti human IgG; coating of antigens on the test
dots, and on further inquiries, about HCV SCAN and HCV Spot
and thus come up with the device. It was also submitted that
mosiacing can be a defence for prior publication but not for
obviousness.
101.

Insofar as the aspect of mosaicing is concerned, the legal

position as set out in the judgment in Billcare Ltd. case (supra),
it would not be a defence to show that the various components
in

the

patented

product

are

known

separately.

The

combination of such components may be patentable.
102.
rely

Thus, it would be not be permissible for the defendant to
on

different

documents

disclosing

different

components/features of the product to plead that the product of
the patent is known. None of the documents relied on by
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 42 of 52

defendant no. 2 in the present matter really anticipate all the
components of the plaintiff's product.

Prior Working of the Device by the plaintiff
103.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that while

defendant no. 2 has alleged that the plaintiff has worked the
said device prior to the filing of the patent application based on
the WHO report of January 2001, the WHO Report does not
show that the said product was being manufactured prior to
June 2000. The plaintiff claims that the said report relates to
third generation Tri-Dot and it is stated that newer versions of
the product would be covered in a subsequent report.
104.

Learned counsel further submitted that section 30 of the

said Act specifically exempts manufacturing and submission to
government authorities from testing and evaluation from
anticipation. The said provision is as under:
“30. Anticipation by previous communication
to Government.

105.

An invention claimed in a complete specification
shall not be deemed to have been anticipated by
reason only of the communication of the invention
to the Government or to any person authorised by
the Government to investigate the invention or its
merits, or of anything done, in consequence of
such a communication, for the purpose of the
investigation.”
The market approval for the commercial sale of the said

product after testing in respect of the product of the plaintiff
was given on 24.07.2000. The date of expiry of the batch
evaluated of the said product in the WHO Report is stated to
be Nov. 2001 and the Shelf life is mentioned as 12 months.
106.

Insofar as the prior working of the device by the plaintiff

is concerned, it may be noticed that while the report referred
to by learned counsel for defendant no. 2 of January 2001

IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 43 of 52

mentions HCV Tri-dot as one of the products tested, the
subsequent report of July 2001 mentions 4th Generation HCV
Tri-dot as one of the products evaluated. The cumulative list of
commercially available assays in the said report mentions both
the HCV Tri-dot and 4th Generation HCV Tridot assays. Nothing
has been placed on record to show that the two tests are
similar or that there is no distinction between the same. The
WHO report (January 2001) however, does not mention
whether the 'HCV Tri-dot' is a third generation product.
107.

Section 30 of the said Act exempts the communication of

the invention either to the government or a person authorised
by the Government for the investigation of the invention or its
merits from challenge on the ground of anticipation.
108.

The batch of HCV Tri-dot 4th Generation evaluated by the

WHO evaluated was manufactured in November 2000 which is
after the date of the patent application. There is no other
material on record which shows that the 4th Generation HCV
Tri-dot was being manufactured by the plaintiff prior to the
date of the patent application. Thus, it cannot be said from the
material on record that the plaintiff has worked the impugned
product prior to the date of the application.
Explanation of Product insufficient
109.

It is also claimed that the plaintiff has not sufficiently

explained its invention and a number of essential features of
the invention including inter alia, the proportion of the mixture
of antigens; the use of the protein A colloidal gold conjugate;
HCV peptides and anti-human IgG and the antigens used to
produce the T1 and T2 dots and the advantage of using two
dots; whether the claims are directed to a single assay or to a
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 44 of 52

plurality of tests; whether the test and control dots are part of
the immunofiltration membrane or the top of the device and
whether the membrane may be completely coated with
antigens has not been explained in the main claim/other claims
of the patent specification. It is averred that claim 2 of the
plaintiff’s claim does not relate to the features of the device
and that as the indicated buffers are composed of compounds
commonly used in buffer formulations, and the making of
buffers is routinely optimized for its intended use in the art,
claim 2 “identifying the embodiments of the claimed device” is
obvious and lacks inventive step.

Defendant no. 2 has

asserted that the claims of the plaintiff are inconsistent as
while in one instance it has been stated that the entire filter is
to be coated with the antigen mixture, another instance states
that only two dots are coated with the said mixture. Defendant
no. 2 thus contends that the claims of the plaintiff’s
specification are ‘drawn’ to any device that would meet the
structural limitations of claim 1 and renders 100 per cent
sensitivity and 98.9 per cent specificity. It is claimed that the
plaintiff has provided a general set of antigens that may be
used in the claimed device but has not provided any
demonstration as to the specificity or sensitivity of the set of
antigens. Also, the effect of applying a number of coatings to
the immunofiltration material has not been indicated in the
claims.
110.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the

patent specification of the plaintiff’s product clearly mentions
the prior art and also explains the invention in the said
product. It has been mentioned therein that the extant kits do
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 45 of 52

not provide the desired specificity and sensitivity and the
importance of precise and accurate diagnosis has been
highlighted. It is noted that the fourth generation assays were
introduced to achieve 98.9. per cent results for specificity and
100 per cent results for sensitivity. The specification states
that in order to achieve 100 per cent reliable results and
overcome the drawback of false results, the fourth generation
tests utilized a greater range of antigens from the subtype
level of HCV Core antigens, HCV NS3 antigens, HCV NS4
antigens and HCV NS3 antigens regions of HCV genome. The
exact composition of the dispensing agent and specific
composition of the buffer solution has been stated in the
specification and the specific quantities of colloidal gold and
Protein A have been spelt out. The plaintiff thus claimed that
the patent specifications sets out the minutest details for the
manufacture of the said product and the same can be
manufactured without much effort.
111.

A reference was also made to the observations of the

Assistant Patent Controller in the order dated 23.08.2006
wherein it was observed that the opponents had nowhere
stated that they were unable to understand the invention and
a person having knowledge of the cited document which was in
public domain cannot make such allegations. The ground of
insufficient and fair description was rejected in the said order.
112.

A perusal of the complete specification of the plaintiff's

patent shows that the same mentions the limitations of the
assays of the first, second and third generations and the need
for a fourth generation test. The implication of the appearance
of dots at the control dot and the two test dots has been
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 46 of 52

indicated. The specification also mentions the composition of
the dispensing media, the buffer solution and the proportion of
the antigens. The composition of the mixture of antigens has
also been set out in the specification as noted herein-above. In
respect of the anti human IgG, it has been stated in the
specification that the same is coated on the membrane for the
appearance of the dot at the quality in built control dot. It is
stated that the protein A conjugate is added which binds the Fc
portion of the HCV antibodies to give distinct colour near the
test region. Again the HCV peptides and recombinant HCV
antigens is poured over for the indication of the dots. The
specification prima facie appears to have sufficiently explained
the various components of the device and the impact of the
said components/features.
Gillette Defence/ Fletcher Moulton Defence
113.

Learned Counsel for Defendant no. 2 placed reliance on

the Gillette Defence to submit that even if the product of
defendant no. 2 falls within the four corners of the plaintiff’s
patent, it would not amount to infringement as the impugned
product is based on prior US Patents. Reliance was placed on
the judgment of R.C. Lahoti J (as he then was) in Shri Ravi Raj
Gupta v. M/s Acme Glass Mosaic Industries 56 (1994) DLT 673.
In this case, a reference was made to the Terrell on Patents
(1982 Edn, pp.170-171) wherein the Gillette defence is
summed up as under:
“6.41 ‘Infringement not Novel’ (Gillette Defence)
Since no relief could be obtained in respect of an
invalid patent, if the defendant could prove that
the act complained of was merely what was
disclosed in a publication which could be relied
on against the validity of the patent, without any
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 47 of 52

substantial or patentable variation having been
made, he had a good defence…”

114.

In Gillette Safety Razor Co. v. Anglo American Trading Co.

Ltd, Vol. 30., Reports of Patent, Design and Trademark Cases
p. 465, Lord Moulton observed as under:

115.

“I am, therefore, of opinion that in this
case the Defendants' right to succeed can
be established without an examination of
the terms of the Specification of the
Plaintiffs' Letters Patent. I am aware that
such a mode of deciding a Patent case is
unusual, but from the point of view of the
public it is important that this method of
viewing their rights should not be
overlooked. In practical life it is often the
only safeguard to the manufacturer. It is
impossible for an ordinary member of the
public to keep watch on all the numerous
Patents which are taken out and to
ascertain the validity and scope of their
claims. But he is entitled to feel secure if
he knows that that which he is doing
differs from that which has been done of
old only in non-patentable variations,
such as the substitution of mechanical
equivalents or changes of material shape
or size. The defence that “the alleged
infringement was not novel at the date of
the plaintiff's Letters Patent” is a good
defence in law, and it would sometimes
obviate the great length and expense of
Patent cases if the defendant could and
would put forth his case in this form, and
thus spare himself the trouble of
demonstrating on which horn of the wellknown dilemma the plaintiff had impaled
himself, invalidity or non-infringement.”
A perusal of the decision in the cases of Ravi Raj Gupta

and Gillette Safety Razor Co. cases (supra) shows that where it
is shown that the act complained of is what was disclosed in a
prior publication, which can be relied on against the validity of
the patent, and no patentable or substantial alteration has
been made in respect thereof, there is a good defence. As far
as

the

documents

relied

on

by

defendant

no.

are

concerned,the same do not prima facie indicate that the
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 48 of 52

product of the plaintiff is obvious or was anticipated. A perusal
of the features of the impugned product of defendant no. 2
however shows that almost all the components of the said
product save for minor differences in the number of dots and
number of drops of samples and reagents added are identical
with the plaintiffs product. They do not appear to be based on
the US Patents or the products of third parties relied on by the
plaintiff.
Defendant no. 2’s Product Different
116.

Defendant no. 2 submitted that its product is different

from that of the plaintiff and in order point out the differences
between the two products had relied on a chart filed by it. The
said chart inter alia mentions the following dissimilarities:

The concentration of reagents utilized for carrying out the assay
is different in its own means. The adIn the decision of this court
in Billcare Ltd. v. Amertara Pvt. Ltd 2007 (34) PTC 419 (Del), it
was observed
It was submitted by learned counsel for defendant no. 2, on the
other hand, that the documents on which the said defendant
has relied do not amount to mosaicing and if a person skilled in
the art were to read the US patents, he would be able to come
out with the device in respect of which patent has been
obtained by the plaintiff. Learned counsel contended that by a
reading of US patent no 5541059, any skilled person would be
able to learn about a device comprising a base, absorbent pad,
an immunofiltration membrane and top cover with a hole
having a multiple coating on the membrane; use of a control
dot with the help of colloidal gold, Protein A dition of reagents is
standardized as per the above shown protocol and is unique to
get the outcome from the clinical specimen. Any change or
deviation in the quantity of these reagents shall give erroneous
and ambiguous result.

of

positive Appearance of either of the
two test dots or both the test
dots along with the the control
dot means reactive or positive
result.

Appearance of single test dot
along with the control dot
means reactive or positive
result.

The plaintiff however, contended that the only difference

between the products of the plaintiff and defendant no. 2 the
presence of two test dots in the product of the plaintiff and
only one test dot in the product of defendant no. 2 and the
differences in the number of drops (of the buffer, sample and
the colloidal gold conjugate) to be added set out in the chart
submitted by defendant no. 2 cannot be said to be a
differentiating factor in the two products. It was submitted that
the presence of two dots only increases the capability to
capture the antibody.
118.

Insofar as this aspect is concerned, the chart submitted

by defendant no.2 points out the differences in the number of
test dots (one in the device of defendant no. 2 as opposed to
two dots in the device of the plaintiff), the number of coatings
of

the

antigen

mixture

(three

coatings

of

different

homogeneous antigen mixture in on the test dots in the device
of the plaintiff and one homogenous mixture with 'unique'
combination of antigens coated in the device of defendant no.

2) and the number of drops of the sample, wash buffer and
colloidal gold added at various stages of the said test. There is
no sufficient explanation forthcoming as to the effect of the
differences in the number of drops of the wash buffer, sample
and colloidal gold added during the various stages of the test
nor as to the effect of the number of coatings and nature of
mixture used or as to how these differences make the two
devices or the process different. The components used in the
two devices being the the base, membrane, control dots and
test dot/s, buffer solution, Protein A Conjugate, the antigens
used etc are similar.

The specificity and sensitivity of the

devices of the plaintiff and defendant no. 2 as per the WHO
reports are also identical. Thus, a finding cannot be reached
on the submissions made at this stage

that the product of

defendant no. 2 is distinct from that of the plaintiff.
Conclusion
119.

In view of the aforesaid, I am of the view that the plaintiff

has made out a prima facie case. The documents placed on
record by defendant no. 2 with respect to US Patent
nos.5,006,464 and 5,541,059 and the products of third parties
do not anticipate the product of the plaintiff. There are
differences in the products in respect of various features such
as structure, antigens used, time period required for the test
and some of the tests being Elisa test as opposed to the rapid
test of the plaintiff as noticed herein above. The claim of
defendant no.2 that it was manufacturing the same product in
pursuance to an agreement entered into with AccuDx can also
not be accepted as the product mentioned in that agreement
employs different antigens. The material on record does not
IA No. 11883/2006 IN CS (OS) No. 2020/2006

Page No. 51 of 52

show prima facie that any fourth generation product has been
worked by the plaintiff prior to its patent application. The use
of patent being limited, irretrievable prejudice will be caused to
the plaintiff if interim orders are not granted. The balance of
convenience lies in favour of the plaintiff as the plaintiff's
patent cannot be permitted to be infringed.
120.

Thus, the application of the plaintiff under Order 39 Rules

1 & 2 of the said Code is allowed and the defendants, their
promoters, directors, servants, agents, dealers, distributors
are retrained from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale or
in any other manner dealing with the impugned product
SIGNAL HCV or any other product violative of the plaintiff's
patent no. 194638. Parties are left to bear their own costs.
121.

Needless to say, any observations made herein will not

affect the final adjudication of the case.
