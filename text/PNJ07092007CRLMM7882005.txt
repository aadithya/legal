1.

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
At the outset, I may note that petitioner No.4 has died.

Thus, qua petitioner No.4 the complaint has abated.
2.

Notwithstanding

various

contentions

urged

in

the

memorandum of the petition filed by the petitioners invoking
Section 482 Cr.P.C. praying that complaint lodged under Section 22
(A) of the Minimum Wages Act 1948 by Babu Lal, the Labour
Inspector be quashed, at the hearing today, learned counsel for the
petitioner has pressed the petition on 2 counts.
3.

It is firstly alleged that a perusal of the complaint does

not establish as to what is the case against which accused.
4.

Second contention urged is that the complaint makes

gibberish reading, i.e. is unintelligible. A printed proforma has been

used to fill up names, dates etc. Exact nature of the complaint is
not spelt out for the reason certain paragraphs have been '√'
probably indicating that complaint relates to said alleged defaults.
5.

To appreciate the submissions made by learned

counsel for the petitioners, it may be noted that in the complaint,
accused are described as under :'I.

Dr. Bharat Ram, Chairman

II

Smt. Panna Bharat Ram, President

III

Sh. Vinay Bharat Ram, Trusty

IV

Sh.R.S.Kanwar, Manager Admn.

M/s. Indian National Theatre Trust,
4 Safdar Hashmi Marg
New Delhi
6.

Shri Ram Centre for Performing Arts.'
It may be noted that whereas serial No.(I) to (IV) has

been assigned to the first 4 names set out as accused in the
complaint, no serial number has been assigned against the juristic
entities described as accused.
7.

Question arises, whether first 4 accused were made

liable for the stated default of juristic entity No.(I) or juristic entity
No.(2)?
8.

The complaint does not disclose so.

9.

The complaint does not disclose whether Indian National

Theatre Trust is the defaulting party or Shri Ram Centre for
Performing Arts is the defaulting party.
10.

Para 3 of the complaint reads as under :“3. That the above named accused employer for the
defined under section 2(e) of the minimum

11.

wages Act 1948 for the work National Theater &
Performing Arts All shops & Other Estt.'
I fail to understand as what is intended to be conveyed

by para 3 of the complaint.
12.

In para 5 of the complaint it is recorded as under :-

13.

“5. That the above named accused person is
responsible for the conduct of its business at time
of commission of offences.”
Which accused person is responsible for the conduct of

which business has not been brought out in the complaint.
14.

I note that para 3, para 4 and para 6 of the complaint

has blank spaces some of which have been filled up in hand.
15.

The complaint shows that a proforma complaint has

been prepared by the department with blank spaces used to fill up
in hand what complainant intends to convey.
16.

As noted here-in-above, this method of filing complaints

has resulted in unintelligible averments emanating from the
complaint.
17.

In its decision dated 13.11.2006 in Crl. A. NO.1169/2006

Gobind T. Sahani Vs. Dty. Commissioner (South)& Ors. Supreme
Court deprecated filing of such kinds of complaints by observing as
under :“ It furthermore appears that the complaint petitions
are being filed on prescribed proforma and merely the
blanks are being filled up or unnecessary
averments are being scored out. While the State
indisputably can bring the fact of commission of offence
provided for in the penal statutes to the notice of the
Magistrate, it is expected that having regard to the
provisions contained in Section 200 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure that public servants are not
required to affirm any affidavit in support of the
complaint petition, it is expected that the complaint
petition would be filed upon due application of mind

and cognizance would also be taken by the learned
Judge similarly.

18.

Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this
case, we are of the opinion that the cognizance taken
in the complaint petition did not disclose commission of
any offence, in that view of the matter, the order taking
cognizance of the offence is quashed. The impugned
judgment is set aside and the application is allowed.”
Taking guidance from the afore-noted observations of

the

Supreme Court, I dispose of petition quashing the complaint

No.MW/431/3 as also the summoning order dated 17.6.2003.
19.

No costs.
