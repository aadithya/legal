counsel, these petitions were heard for final disposal.
2.

On 02.09.1977, the Directorate of Estates, Government of India issued a

licence in favour of one Shri Gurbachan Singh, father of the present petitioners
and Respondent Nos. 2 and 3. The licence enabled Shri Gurbachan Singh to carry
on business activities in shop No. 166, Sarojini Nagar Market. The licensee, on
02.09.87 executed a Will bequeathing all his rights in respect of the premises, to
his wife, during her life time, and after her, the said five sons. It is claimed by the
present petitioners that the licensee Shri Gurbachan Singh entered into a
partnership on 01.04.92 with them and passed away in 1996. The petitioners
claim that subsequently on 08.06.96, they entered into a fresh partnership in the
name and style of “M/s Sawhney Leather Emporium” with their mother.
3.

The petitioners claim that on 21.08.96, Respondent Nos. 2 and 3

relinquished their shares to the property. They also claim that on 04.11.96, Smt.
Prakash Kaur executed a gift deed transferring all her rights to the licenced
property.
4.

On 04.06.98, the petitioners' request for mutation of property in their

favour, (made on 15.05.97) was acceded to; the Land and Development Officer
recorded their names in the register.

They also claim to have made some

improvements in the property.
5.

On 03.09.02, the first respondent issued a show cause notice to the

following effect:

New Delhi-23.
Sub: Property Shop No. 166, Sarojini Nagar Market, New
Delhi.
Sir,
It has been brought to the notice of this office by S/Sh.
Gurcharan Singh and Ranjit Singh sons of late Sh. Gurbachan
Singh that the mutation of the property carried out in your name
vide this office letter dated 04.06.97 has been obtained by you on
the basis of forged and fake signatures and fabricated documents.
A copy of their complaint dated 01.07.02 is herewith enclosed.
In view of the above position, you are hereby called
upon to show cause within 15 days of the date of issue of this letter,
as to why the mutation of the property Shop No. 166, Sarojini
Nagar Market, carried out in your favour vide letter No, L&
DO/PS-IV/Shop No. 166/SN. Mkt./543 dated 04.06.97 should not
be withdrawn and cancelled. In case no reply is received within
the stipulated period, the cancellation of mutation will be
processed further without any reference to you.
Yours faithfully,
(A. Bhattacharyya)
Dy. Land & Development Officer”
6.

The petitioners replied and resisted the proposed action. They relied upon

the registered gift deed executed on 04.11.96 in their favour as also the other
documents. They claimed that since the mutation had been made long back, no
action towards its cancellation should be taken, by the L & DO. The petitioners
were also assessed to property tax pursuant to the mutation.
7.

The present petition is directed against an order dated 09.07.04 issued by

the office of the L & DO. The order reads as follows:

Jaswant Singh Sawhney and Kuldeep Singh Sawhney,

Sir,
I am directed to refer to this office letter of even number
dated 03.09.2002 wherein you were called upon to show cause as
to why the mutation of the property Shop No. 166, Sarojini Nagar
Market, New Delhi carried out in you favour should not be
withdrawn and to say that the reply furnished by you vide you
letter dated 09.09.2002 and the records available in this office
have been examined in consultation with the forensic experts and
it is established that the affidavits in the name of S/Sh. Ranjit
Singh and Gurcharan Singh furnished to this office along with the
substitution application dated 08.07.1996 of Smt. Prakash Kaur
and also along with you letter dated Nil (received in this office on
14th May, 1997) in connection with the mutation application dated
21.08.1996 were not genuine and therefore the substitution of the
property Shop No. 166, Sarojini Nagar Market in the name of Smt.
Prakash Kaur vide this office letter dated 21.08.1996 and the
mutation of the property in your names vide this office letter dated

grievance in this regard, you may approach the competent Court
of law.
Yours faithfully,

Sd/Public Relation Officer
For & on behalf of President of India”
Learned counsel contends that the findings of the L & DO without

affording any opportunity to the petitioners that the affidavits of respondent Nos.
2 and 3 (furnished to it) were fabricated and that the application of Smt. Prakash
Kaur was also not genuine cannot be sustained. It is claimed that the petitioners
had answered the show cause notice within the time granted on 09.09.02. In
these circumstances the respondents could not have unilaterally concluded that
the documents were forged and proceeded to cancel the mutation.
9.

The counsel for the respondents submitted that the order was issued after

considering all the circumstances, in view of the report of the FSL received by the
W.P.(C) 21407-409/2005 & W.P.(C) 12255-57/2004

4 of 6

L & DO, which indicated that the documents were not genuine. It was submitted
that the affidavits of respondent Nos. 2 and 3 and the claims were suspect; after
the allegations were confirmed it was thought appropriate to cancel the mutation.
Counsel also contended that the petitioner himself never sought a hearing. In
these circumstances, there was no question of affording any further opportunity.
10.

The factual matrix would show that the respondent L&DO issued a notice

on 03.09.2002 alleging that the documents, upon which the mutation in the
petitioners' favour were premised, were forged and not genuine. The petitioners
resisted the notice and gave their objections. However, the respondents did not
put the materials collected in their enquiry, to the petitioner.

One of the

fundamental rules of fair procedure is that no party, likely to face serious
consequences by an order of an administrative body or agency, should be
confronted with an adverse order without the basis of such order being disclosed
to him, in the absence of some rudimentary opportunity. Although, in this case
the show cause notice was issued on 3.9.2002, the respondent did not choose to
put to the petitioners the adverse materials which they ultimately sought to rely
upon, namely, the report of the FSL and the statements or other materials
gathered from respondent Nos. 2 and 3. The cancellation of mutation, had grave
and serious consequences; all the more in the facts of this case, as it was based on
allegations of forgery and fabrication. In these circumstances, I am of the opinion
that the impugned order is not sustainable.
11.

The position of the respondents appears to be that the second and third

respondents had not consented to the transfer or mutation and the that the gift
W.P.(C) 21407-409/2005 & W.P.(C) 12255-57/2004

5 of 6

did was not genuine.

In these circumstances, I am of the opinion that the

appropriate course at this stage would be to relegate the parties, to the status quo
ante as on the date of the impugned order. The L&DO should proceed with an
enquiry and disclose the relevant report which it seeks to rely upon fairly to the
petitioner. It is open to the petitioners to file such documents or produce such
materials as they would seek to rely upon.
12.

The respondents shall accordingly furnish a copy of the FSL report and

other documents on the basis of which it formed its opinion for issuing the
impugned order to the petitioners within 10 days from today. The petitioners
shall file the relevant materials/affidavits/documents in reply two weeks
thereafter. They shall be afforded opportunity along with respondent Nos. 2 and
3 thereafter on a specific date to be fixed by the L&DO. At the end of the
proceedings, the L&DO shall issue a speaking order and communicate the same
to the parties. The entire proceedings shall be concluded within three months
from today.
13.

All rights and contentions of the parties are hereby reserved. The petitions

are disposed off in the above terms. No costs.
Order Dasti to parties.
