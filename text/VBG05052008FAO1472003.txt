V.B.Gupta, J.
The present appeal has been filed by New India
Assurance Company under Section 173 of Motor Vehicle
Act, 1988 (for short as ‘Act’) against the judgment dated
31st January, 1997 passed by Sh. Rakesh Kapoor, Judge,
MACT, Delhi, vide which the learned Tribunal has passed
an award for a sum of Rs.38,400/- along with 12% p.a.
interest against the appellant Insurance Company.

2.

Along with the present appeal, the appellant has also

filed an application under Section 5 of Limitation Act, 1963
for condonation of delay in filing this appeal.
3.

Reply to the application of condonation of delay has

been filed on behalf of respondent No.7, the alleged owner
of the offending vehicle.
4.

There has been a delay of 5 years, 9 months and 10

days in filing the present appeal and as such application for
condonation of delay is taken at the first instance.
5.

In this application, it has been stated that the claim

file of the present matter was misplaced in the Insurance
Company record and when the appellant received the
summons from this Court in FAO No.184/1997, the
appellant deputed a person to trace the file, but the same
could not be traced.
6.

On 18th November, 2002, Sh. S.L. Gupta, Adv. for the

Insurance Company had applied for the certified copy of
FAO No.147/2003 & CM No.336/2003

Page 3 of 7

the judgment and the same was delivered only on 7 th
January, 2003.

Thereafter, the claim was processed and

the competent authority came to the conclusion that in the
present case, the Insurance Company was not at risk as the
cheque of the premium was dishonoured and policy of
insurance was cancelled.

After receiving a copy of the

judgment on 7th January, 2003, necessary steps were taken
for filing the appeal. Thus, the delay in filing the present
appeal is not intentional and it is on account of the
Insurance Company procedure involved in for filing the
FAO.
7.

It is further stated that unlike the private litigant, the

matter relating to the Government are required to be
considered at various levels and then only the decision is
taken to file the FAO and the process of referring a
particular file from one department to another is time
consuming process and thus leads to delay.

So, it is

therefore, prayed that delay may be condoned considering
FAO No.147/2003 & CM No.336/2003

Page 4 of 7

the public interest involved and because of the genuine
difficulties which

are peculiar in the functioning of

Government and circumstances beyond the control of the
appellant.
8.

In reply to the application filed by respondent No.7, it

is stated that the period of limitation prescribed for filing
the appeal is ninety days under the Act and that period
expired on 1st May, 1997 and the present appeal was filed
on 17th February, 2003. There is a delay of 2117 days and
there is no explanation for delay in filing the appeal. The
appeal being hopelessly time barred should be dismissed.
9.

Admittedly, there is a delay of 5 years, 9 months and

10 days in filing of the present appeal.
10.

The ground taken for non filing of the present appeal

in time is that, the claim file in the present matter was
misplaced in the Insurance Company record. It is nowhere
stated in the application as to when and on which date the

FAO No.147/2003 & CM No.336/2003

Page 5 of 7

claim file in the present matter was misplaced and on
which date and under what circumstances the same was
traced out. Furthermore, it is nowhere mentioned in the
application as to who was the person who has misplaced
the file and in what manner the file was traced out. The
present application is absolutely vague.
11.

It is well-settled that each day’s delay has to be

explained for getting the delay condoned. Here, there is a
delay of 2117 days and there is no explanation for each
day’s delay. Moreover, seeking condonation of delay is not
a matter of right. The litigant who comes to the court after
the prescribed period of limitation is bound to satisfy the
court that he has sufficient cause for delay.

Sufficient

cause for condoning the delay is an essentially a question
of fact.
12.

The present application is absolutely vague and the

appellant has given no circumstances to show that delay of

FAO No.147/2003 & CM No.336/2003

Page 6 of 7

2117 days was not due to any latches on the part of the
appellant. The provisions of limitation Act do not extend
any immunity relaxing period of limitation in favour of
State Government or Government bodies.

The State

Government and other Government bodies also stand on
the same footing like the ordinary litigant.
13.

So, from the material available on record, I do not

find any sufficient ground for condoning the delay of 2117
days

in

filing

the

appeal

and

the

application

for

condonation of delay is not maintainable and is hopelessly
time barred.
14.

Thus, the application for condonation of delay is

dismissed and the appeal filed by the appellant also stands
dismissed, being barred by limitation.
15.

No orders as to costs.
