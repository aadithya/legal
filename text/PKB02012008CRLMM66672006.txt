JUDGMENT
P.K.BHASIN, J:
The petitioners, by way of this petition under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 are praying for quashing of the FIR no. 95/2006 for the
offence under Section 308/34 of Indian Penal Code (‘I.P.C.’ in short) registered at

Police Station Kanjhawala on 13.07.2006.

2.

Briefly stated, facts of the case are that on 13.07.2006 at about 1.45 p.m.

petitioners no. 1-3 gave beatings to one Narender, petitioner no.4 herein, and in
respect of that incident FIR under Section 308/34 I.P.C. was registered on the
basis of the statement of the injured Narender who named Braham Prakash,
petitioner no. 1, and his two sons, petitioners no. 2 & 3 herein, as the assailants.

3.

During the pendency of the investigation, both the parties who are related to

each other, with the intervention of the respectable persons of their village
resolved their disputes and arrived at an amicable settlement and in view of the
compromise this joint petition was filed by the accused and the injuredcomplainant for quashing of the above-referred FIR. Copy of the compromise deed
signed by both the parties has also been placed on record.

4.

Notice of the petition was given to the State. Learned APP for the State

opposed quashing of the FIR on the ground that offence under Section 308 I.P.C. is
of grave nature and the same is not compoundable under Section 320 Cr.P.C. and
so FIR should not be quashed. In reply to this objection learned senior counsel for
the petitioners had submitted that this Court has been quashing cases even in

respect of offence under Section 307 I.P.C. where the parties had reported
settlement.

5.

It is now well settled that even in respect of those offences which are not

compoundable FIRs/criminal proceedings can be quashed if the Court while
dealing with a petition under section 482 Cr.P.C. feels that it would secure the ends
of justice and continuation of the investigation/criminal trial would amount to
abuse of the process of law. Reference in this regard can be made to one judgment
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in “B.S.Joshi & Ors. Vs. State of Haryana & Anr.”, AIR
2003 SC 1386 where it has been so held. Further, in a recent case decided by this
Court reported as “Basara & Ors. v. State & Anr.” Crl. M.C. No. 6621-24/2006 and
in an earlier judgment also of this Court in “Gurcharan Singh v. The State & Anr.”,
1998 Cri.l.J. 3780, the proceedings pending in the Court even for the offence
punishable under Section 307 I.P.C. were quashed in view of the compromise
between the parties. So, since both the parties in the present case are related to
each other and are neighbours also and they have settled their disputes for
bringing about peace and harmony in their families no fruitful purpose would be
served if the investigation against the accused persons goes on and the relief of
quashing of the FIR in these circumstances cannot be refused just because Section
308 I.P.C. is involved in the case.

6.

In view of the foregoing and considering the fact that this Court itself in its

earlier decisions, as noted above, has been allowing petitions for quashing of the
FIRs on the basis of the settlement between the parties even in cases where
allegations of serious nature inviting punishment upto imprisonment for life were
levelled against the accused, I am inclined to allow this petition. Consequently FIR
no. 95/2006 registered at Police Station Khanjhawala on 13-07-2006 is hereby
quashed.
