ORDER
01.04.2008
The respondents Mrs.Krishna Kanta Jain and M/s Mahindra Ugine Steel

Co. Ltd. had earlier filed a WP(C) No.1525/1992, which was disposed of vide
order dated 08.11.1993 holding as under:“Since the point involved in the writ petition is very short,
we proceed to dispose of the same.
This petition concerns levy of property tax by the
respondent-NDMC under the provisions of Punjab Municipal
Act as extended to Delhi. The assessment years involved
are 1989-90, 1990-91 and 1991-92. Mr. Rao say that for the
assessment
years
1989-90
and
1990-91
the
respondent/NDMC had re-heard the matter and the decision
is awaited. In this view of the matter, we do not propose to
pass any order in respect of two assessment years, i.e.
1989-90 and 1990-91.
Answer to show cause notice has been filed by the
NDMC and which this it has filed an order levying the
property tax assessing the rateable value of the property on
the basis of comparable rent in the locality. The premises
are self occupied and the act of the NDMC is against the law
laid down in Delhi Paints and Chemicals Vs. NDMC and Anr.
1993 (2) Delhi Lawyer 18 and Government Servants Co-

operativer House Building Society Ltd. Vs. Union of India
and Ors. 1993 III AD(Dr ) 629. In this view of the matter,
the assessment orders for the year 1991-92 are set aside
and the matter is remanded back to NDMC to fix the rateable
value in accordance with law. There will be no order as to
costs. Rule is made absolute.”

2.

Division Bench of High Court while disposing of the said writ petition

has specifically recorded in the said order that the premise is self-occupied. The
respondent/NDMC has accepted the said order and the said findings and
observations made in the said order have attained finality.
3.

In spite of the above order, the remand assessment order dated

18.2.1997 has proceeded on the basis that the property in question is not
mutated in the name of M/s Mahindra Ugine Steel Co. Ltd. and, therefore, the
said property cannot be treated as self-occupied, as legal title of the property and
occupancy should both vest in the same person. The said finding recorded in the
assessment order dated 18.2.1997 is contrary to the directions and findings
given by Delhi High Court in order dated 08.11.1993 passed in WP (C)
No.1525/1992. Besides the said finding, it is also contrary to law. Mutation is not
ownership. It is only evidence of ownership. The property is self-occupied when
it is in occupation of the owner.

4.

The term „owner„ has been defined in The New Delhi Municipal

Council Act, 1994 in Section 2(32).

The said definition is an inclusive

definition and specifically includes a person who is entitled to rent out a
property and receive rent. The Section, nowhere stipulates that an owner of a
property, must also have mutation in his name.

The said Section reads as

under :“(37) “owner” includes a person who for the time being is
receiving or is entitled to receive, the rent of any land or

building whether on his own account or on account of
himself and others or as an agent, trustee, guardian or
receiver for any other person or who should so receive the
rent or be entitled to receive it if the land or building or part
thereof were let to a tenant and also includes—
(a) The custodian of evacuee property in respect of evacuee
property vested in him under the Administration of
Evacuee Property Act, 1950 (31 of 1950); and
(b) The estate officer to the Government of India, the
Secretary of the Delhi Development Authority, constituted
under the Delhi Development Act, 1957 (61 of 1957), the
General Manager of a railway and the head of a
Government department, in respect of properties under
their respective control;”

5.

Reference in this regard can be made to decision of this Court in

case of H.P.S. Chawala Vs. Municipal Corporation of Delhi (2006) 1 AD
(Delhi) 581, wherein, learned Single Judge has held that mutation is only for
purpose of recording the name of person liable to pay tax and the said
mutation is not proof of title. Reference can also be made to the judgment of
the Supreme Court in the case of Suman Verma v. Union of India,(2004) 12

SCC 58, at page 63 :
1. In our considered opinion, however, the learned

counsel for Respondent 6 is right in submitting that
Respondent 6 had become owner of agricultural
land in October 1996. The relevant date for
consideration was 12-11-1996 and before that date
she possessed such property. Rekha Chaturvedi1 in
our view, supports Respondent 6 rather than the
appellant. When Respondent 6 became the owner
of the property in October 1996 before the last date
of submission of application, she could be said to be

possessing agricultural land and, hence, she was
eligible. In our opinion, owning of agricultural
property and getting the name entered in revenue
record are two different and distinct things. Mutation
entry does not confer right or title to the property.
Though the law is very well settled, in our opinion,
CAT was right in relying upon the decision of this
Court in Sawarni v. Inder Kaur wherein this Court
held that mutation entry neither creates nor
extinguishes title or ownership.
6.

In these circumstances, I do not find any merit in the present writ

petition impugning order dated 05.4.2004 passed by the Additional District Judge
allowing the appeal and setting aside of order dated 18.2.1997.
The writ petition is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
