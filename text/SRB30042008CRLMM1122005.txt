Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat (Open Court)
1.

The petitioner claims to be aggrieved by criminal proceedings initiated on a

complaint filed by Registrar of Companies for alleged contravention of Section 255 of the

CRL.M.C. 112/2005, CRL.M.C. 115/2005

1 of 5

Companies Act for which allegedly Section 629A enacts offence punishable with fine.
The principal allegations of the complainant Registrar in CRL.M.C. 115/2005 were
that the petitioner company did not follow the mandatory procedure of indicating, which
of its 1/3rd Directors were to retire on rotation. In CRL.M.C. 112/2005 the allegation
likewise is that the petitioner was guilty of contravening Section 268 in so far as it relates
to appointment of Managing Director.
2.

The ground urged is that Section 629-A does not prescribe an offence. Counsel

relied upon the judgment of the Calcutta High Court reported as Registrar of Companies
vs. Bharat Produce Co. Ltd., 1980 Comp. Cas. 106. It was urged that the complaint was
not maintainable since it was filed far beyond the time prescribed. Learned counsel urged
that the time prescribed in such a case would be within six months being in terms of
Section 468(2) (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (hereafter “Code”). It was urged that
the relevant years, according to allegations of the Registrar of Companies, when the
offences are said to have occurred, were 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99. The complaint
was filed on 18th October, 2001 i.e. beyond the six months limitation period. Lastly, it
was urged that the trial court proceeded mindlessly and issued a blanket order on the basis
of a cyclostyled format without considering the materials. Learned counsel submits that
there was no material in support of the complaint by way of an inspection report etc. as
averred by the Registrar, on the record of the Court.
3.

Learned counsel for the respondent opposed these proceedings for quashing and

urged that the to offences, namely, Sections 255 and 268 were continuing offence and,
therefore, the court did not commit any error in law in issuing process. It was urged that
CRL.M.C. 112/2005, CRL.M.C. 115/2005

inspection of the books of account and the affairs of the company for the purpose was
carried out between 10th August, 2000 and 25th August, 200 intermittently and the
complaint was premised on the inspection report which revealed contravention of the
various provisions. It was argued that the Registrar had issued show cause notice on 28 th
May, 2001 and thereafter proceeded to file the complaint.
4.

The judgment in Bharat Produce Co. Ltd.(Supra) of the Calcutta High Court

considered the previous judgments of other High Courts as well as of that Court,
particularly, in Raghunath Swaroop Mathur vs. Har Swaroop Mathur, 1968 Crl.L.J. 670
by the Allahabad High Court and a judgment of Court of Appeal as well. It formed the
opinion that Section 269 as it then stood was declaratory in nature and that having regard
to the phraseology applied in Section 628-A, contravention or violation of Section 269
did not amount an offence. The petitioner has sought parity of reasoning with that
decision to say that alleged violation of Section 268 does not amount to a punishable
offence and they at best indicate an irregularity for which penalty can be imposed. At the
relevant time, the penalty, was Rs. 500/-.
5.

Though the judgment of the Calcutta High Court deals with Section 629-A, in my

opinion, the reasoning cannot be universally applied because the fact situations of the
contravention alleged have to be seen on a case by case basis. Section 269-A is a
residuary provision, in the sense that it creates an offence for contravention of statutory
obligations, wherever no specific offence is enacted. The Court was in that case called
upon to decide contravention of the pre-amended Section 269. However, that provision
has undergone a complete overhaul after the amending Act of 1988.

6.

As far as the issue of limitation is concerned, the facts show that the alleged that

the alleged contravention/offences took place in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99. The
complaints also disclosed that copies of the Annual Reports were available as of August,
1998. The only reason for approaching the court in October 2001 was that inspection
took place in August 2000 and a report was made available thereafter.
7.

The phraseology of Section 255, 256 and 268 are indicative of the legislative

intention that contravention of these provisions constitute separate offences having regard
to the circumstances. The company admittedly filed its annual returns; they were
available as in August 1998 with the Registrar. The complaint pertains to years prior to
that. Therefore, the year-wise position, as existing in the Annual Report were well known
to the Registrar. Such being the case, the Registrar was within his rights to approach the
Court with complaints having regard to the mandate of Section 468(2) Cr.P.C. within the
time, i.e. six months, as he was possessed of all information. The explanation about a
report being supplied later, leading to discovery of facts, wears thin, because the offences
relating to directors and managing directors do not need “discovery” - they are technical
violations which can be gathered upon immediate publication of, or filing of balance
sheet or annual report by the company. The law of limitation is precisely meant to shut
out stale claims, and its operation cannot be suspended to await “discovery” of known
facts by the person or body empowered to take action.
8.

The complaints no-where indicate that copies of the inspection report were filed in

Court; there is no disclosure even about the date of those reports. Further, the impugned
order issuing process shows that the trial court mechanically and in a cyclostyled format

4 of 5

summoned the petitioner. These clearly bitray a casual approach by the Court.
9.

In view of the above and having conclusions, I am of the opinion that the petitions

are entitled to succeed. They are accordingly allowed. Criminal Complaints 680/2001
and 678/2001 pending before the ACMM, Tis Hazari, are hereby quashed.
