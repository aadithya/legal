dated 14th May, 2004 passed in I.D No.47/97 published on 12th June,
1994 by the CGIT cum Labour Court-II, New Delhi.

The operation of the award was stayed by order dated 11th July,

and balance of convenience, the order dated 11th July, 2005 is made
absolute and the operation of award dated 14th May, 2004 is stayed
during the pendency of the present writ petition and the application is
disposed of.

CM No.171/2007

1.

This is an application by the respondent/applicant under Section

17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking payment of full wages
at Rs.5539/- with effect from 14th May, 2004, the date of award
directing reinstatement of the petitioner along with 10% back wages
and continuity of service.

2.

The applicant/petitioner contended that he has not been in

employment since the termination of his services nor he has been
engaged in any other establishment. The applicant has also sought
direction to the management to pay the minimum wages.

3.

The

application

is

supported

by

the

affidavit

of

the

workman/applicant deposing categorically that he has not been able to
get any employment after termination of his services although he has
been continuously trying for the same at every possible place. The
applicant has also deposed that he is not engaged in any other
W.P(C) No.1244/2005

Page 2 of 8

establishment or company/firm and he is not able to secure any
employment.

4.

The application is contested by the petitioner contending that the

respondent applicant was engaged on contractual basis as casual labor
for specific period from 1st October, 1984 to 1st October, 1985 and it
cannot be believed that for last 20 years he is not working anywhere.
The non-applicant/petitioner has also challenged the relief sought by
the applicant under Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act on the
ground that the demand notice was served by the respondent 10 years
after the term of the applicant was over and in the circumstances it
cannot be believed that he was aggrieved by abandonment of job by him
which was purely on contractual basis. The non-applicant has also
opposed the application on the ground that the work on which the
applicant was engaged was purely a contractual engagement on a
project and the project workers cannot claim regularization.

5.

The practice of disposal of the petition as well as the application

under Section 17B of the Act contemporaneously was deprecated by the
Apex Court and the High Court was directed to first expeditiously
dispose of the application under Section 17B by the Supreme Court by
its decision reported at VII (2000) SLT 70=JT 2000 (8) SC 501,
Workmen Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Hindustan
W.P(C) No.1244/2005

Page 3 of 8

Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. & Ors. While considering an application
under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Court cannot go
into the merits of the case in the writ petition. It was so held in 86
(2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.
Therefore, the pleas of the petitioner that the respondent was not
entitled for regularization on account of having employed on a project
and notice of demand was given by the respondent almost ten years
after expiry of his term of project, cannot be considered for the purposes
of deciding the application under Section 17 B of the Act. This is not
disputed that there was relationship of employer and employee between
the petitioner and respondent.

6.

Perusal of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

reveals that it comes into operation when an Award directing
reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further proceedings by the
employer. The preliminary consideration for making available such a
relief under Section 17B to a workman is to be found in the benevolent
purpose of the enactment, its spirit, intendment and object underlying,
which is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship which
would be caused to a workman due to delay in the implementation of an
award directing reinstatement of his services on account of the
challenge made to it by the employer. Section 17B recognizes a
workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body and soul
W.P(C) No.1244/2005

Page 4 of 8

together when a challenge has been made to an Award directing his
reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no inherent right of
assailing an order or an award by an industrial adjudicator by way of
an appeal. The payment which is required to be made by the employer
to the workman has been held to be akin to a subsistence allowance
which is neither refundable nor recoverable from a workman even if the
Award in his favor is set aside by the High Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106
(para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex Court was of the
view that the object under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the hardship that is caused to
the workman due to the delay in implementation of the Award.

7.

Moreover granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing

orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule;
refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the relief
could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional
error where there is no relationship of employer and employee between
the parties.

8.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 entitled Town Municipal, Athani v.
P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman has
a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot
W.P(C) No.1244/2005

Page 5 of 8

be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act for
enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was concerned with
the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the Court would have a
bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well. From the
authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court, the right of a
workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified under the
Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the
constitutional mandate. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean
all the wages that have fallen due at least from the date of the Award.

9.

Thus if the requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes

Act, 1947 are satisfied then no order can be passed denying the
workman the benefit of statutory provisions of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The statute requires satisfaction of the
following four conditions:
(i) an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed
in proceedings in a High Court or the Supreme Court;

(ii) during the pendency of such proceedings, employer is
required to pay full wages to the workman;

W.P(C) No.1244/2005

Page 6 of 8

(iii) the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full wages
last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance
admissible to him under any Rule;

(iv) such wages would be admissible only if the workman
had not been employed in any establishment during such
period and an affidavit had been filed to such effect

10.

Perusal of the record of the writ petition reveals that all the

conditions for passing the order under Section 17B are fulfilled. The
learned counsel for the petitioner is also unable to show any ground
which will disentitle the respondent for an order under Section 17 B of
the Act. For the foregoing reasons the application is allowed. The
petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or minimum wages
whichever is higher from 14th May, 2007 the date of the award. Arrears
of last drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher be paid
within eight weeks. The petitioner/non-applicant shall continue to pay
the last drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher by the
15th of every English Calendar month during the pendency of the writ
petition. The respondent is also directed to give an undertaking to this
Court that in case the writ petition is allowed the difference in
minimum wages and last drawn wages shall be repaid/refunded to the
petitioner/non-applicant within such time as may be permitted by this

W.P(C) No.1244/2005

Court. The undertaking by the respondent/applicant be filed within
four weeks.
With these directions the application is disposed of.
