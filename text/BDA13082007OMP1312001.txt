The petitioner has filed the present objections under Section 34 of

the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in respect of the award dated
9.1.2001. The learned Arbitrator had found that the petitioner/claimant was
entitled to the following amount:“AMOUNT DUE TO THE CLAIMANT.
(i) Rs. 1,84,059.24
(ii) Rs. 26,831.00
(iii)Rs 11,76,182.00
(iv)Rs 10,000.00
Rs 13,97,072.24

Omp 131/2001

Balance payment of the first contract.

Amount of Bank guarantee.

Page No.1 of 12

In respect of the counter claims submitted by the respondent, the learned
arbitrator found the following amount due to the respondent.
“AMOUNT DUE TO THE RESPONDENT.
(i) Rs. 6,08,471/-

Amount paid to the claimant on second
contract.
(ii) Rs 3,76,845/Cost of dismantling the defective work. “
As a result of which, the net award made by the learned Arbitrator was that the
claimant would be entitled to recover a sum of Rs 13,97,072-Rs 9,85,316 = Rs
4,11,756/-. The respondent has accepted the award and has also made the
payment of the said sum of Rs 4,11,756/- along with interest thereon as
indicated as well as the future interest thereon as indicated in the award.
Insofar as the respondent is concerned, the entire award stands satisfied. The
petitioner/claimant, however, has challenged the award on two main grounds.
The first ground taken by the petitioner/claimant is that no interest has been
allowed to the petitioner although, the principal amounts have been found due
to the petitioner. The second ground taken is that the respondent has been
granted a claim which had not even been prayed for by the respondent in his
counter claim.

The National Building Construction Corporation Limited (NBCC)

was required to construct a 200 bed hospital at Maldives by the Government of
India. In 1986 a tender was floated for the same. The petitioner responded to
the same and its offer was accepted by the NBCC (respondent herein) on

Omp 131/2001

Page No.2 of 12

26.9.1989. The acceptance of the petitioner's offer was conveyed on 26.9.1989
in respect of the work of false ceiling, venetian blinds and insulation and water
proofing on the roof of the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital at Male, Republic
of Maldives. The condition of the contract was that at the time of placing of
the detailed order, the petitioner would have to furnish a performance bank
guarantee at the rate of 10% of the contract value

till the end of the

maintenance period.

3.

Under this parent contract two work orders were issued to the

petitioner by the respondent. The first work order was issued on 16.3.1992 for
fixing of false ceiling, venetian blinds and insulation materials at the said
hospital project.

This work order in itself comprises of two parts, one

pertaining to supply and the other pertaining to erection. The total value of the
first work order was Rs 1,17,61,822 (after rebate). The second work order was
placed by the petitioner under, the same parent contract, on 29.8.1992 for the
work of water proofing on the roof of the hospital with kini foam. The value of
this contract was Rs 7,95,387 (after rebate). Disputes had arisen between the
parties as a result of which the bank guarantee, which had been extended by the
petitioner in favour of the respondent, came to be invoked by the respondent by
a letter dated 27.1.1995. The invocation of the bank guarantee was challenged
before the Delhi High Court and ultimately before the Supreme Court. The
Supreme Court permitted the encashment of the bank guarantee and directed
Omp 131/2001

Page No.3 of 12

that the amount of the bank guarantee be paid by the petitioner to the
respondent. However, the Supreme Court further directed the disputes of the
parties to be referred to arbitration in the following terms:“ All claims betweens the parties relating to or arising out of the
contract dated 26.9.1989 read with work order dated 16.3.1992
and 29.8.1992 shall be referred to the arbitration of Mr Justice
P.K. Bahri, retired Judge of Delhi High Court, as agreed between
the parties. The venue of the arbitration shall be at New Delhi.”
The learned arbitrator considered all the arguments advanced by the counsel for
the parties and came to the conclusions noted above.

4.

To crystallize the issues involved in the present petition, it would

be necessary to refer to the claims submitted by the parties. The petitioner had
submitted its claims in respect of the first work order dated 16.3.1992 as under:

In respect of the aforesaid claims, the learned arbitrator awarded claims under
S. Nos. 1,3 and 7. The issue involve in the present petition relates essentially to
the claims under S. Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8.

Insofar as the claim at S. No. 2 is

concerned, no reason has been given by the learned arbitrator for not awarding
interest on the amount of Rs 1,84,059.24 although the principal amount has
been found to be due to the petitioner. In respect of the principal amount, the
learned arbitrator held that admittedly, the contract was completed as per
specifications provided in the contract, and no blame could be put on the
claimant if lengths of blinds were somewhat inoperable, as alleged in the letter
dated 20.9.1996 (R-11).
Omp 131/2001

Accordingly, the learned arbitrator came to the
Page No.5 of 12

conclusion that no amount was liable to be adjusted for rectifying any alleged
defective work. The learned arbitrator also came to the conclusion that no
defect was pointed out or occurred during the defect liability period and,
therefore, no liability could be affixed on the claimant.

Accordingly, the

learned arbitrator held that a sum of Rs 1,84,059.24 was payable to the claimant
by the respondent under the work order dated 16.3.1992. However, he did not
award any interest in respect of this amount. In my view, the arbitrator ought to
have granted interest once he found that the principal amount was due to the
petitioner and that the respondent could not adjust the said amount for
rectifying any alleged defective work. Consequently, the period for which the
interest would be due would be from 1.4.1994 till date at the rate of 9% per
annum (viz. the rate which the learned Arbitrator had fixed for future interest
on the awarded amount).

5.

In respect of S. No. 4, that is, the amount of interest which has

been claimed on the sum of Rs 11,76,182.20, representing the value of the
encashed bank guarantee, the said sum was paid by the petitioner to the
respondent on 17.3.1998 during the proceedings before the Supreme Court.
The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that since this amount has also
been found due and payable by the respondent to the petitioner in terms of the
award, interest also should have been allowed on that amount. In response to

Omp 131/2001

Page No.6 of 12

this, the learned counsel for the respondent referred to paragraph 31 of the
award which reads as under:“31. The claimant has raised claims for having interest at the rate
of 21% per annum for periods it was not paid its dues and
also has claimed expenses incurred for extending the Bank
guarantee. The Bank guarantee was required to be extended
as the respondent had genuine case for recovering the
amount already paid to the claimant for defective work of
the second contract. Mere fact that the Bank guarantee was
given in reference to the first contract does not mean that
the respondent could not have justifiably required extension
of the same and later invocation of the same to recover the
amount due to it in respect of defective work of the second
contract. Thus I hold that the claimant is not entitled to
recover any interest on any amount withheld or recover any
expenses incurred for keeping the Bank guarantee alive.”
The learned counsel for the respondent also submitted that there is no question
of paying any interest on this amount of Rs 11.76 lakhs inasmuch as the bank
guarantee was to have been kept alive till 30.01.2000. Considering the second
point first, I find that the submission of the respondent is untenable. This is so
because the bank guarantee was invoked in 1998 itself and, therefore, the
question of keeping it alive would not survive. Insofar as the first point is
concerned, I find that the learned arbitrator has misdirected himself in
observing that although the bank guarantee had been given with reference to
the first contract, it did not mean that the respondent could have required its
extension and later invocation in order to recover the amount due in respect of
the defective work under the second contract. First of all, the question of the
bank guarantee no longer survives after the same has been permitted to be
Omp 131/2001

Page No.7 of 12

encashed by the Supreme Court. It is well settled that a bank guarantee is a
separate contract. The arbitrator was not adjudicating upon the question of
invocation of the bank guarantee but was adjudicating upon

the disputes

between the parties in respect of the underlying contract. The arbitrator has
found that the respondent was not entitled to retain the sum of Rs 11.76 lakhs.
It awarded the amount in favour of the petitioner. Once he did so, reference to
the bank guarantee was not proper.

Furthermore, having found that the

petitioner was entitled to the suit amount clearly meant that the respondent had
retained the said amount when it was not entitled to do so. Accordingly, in my
view, interest on the said amount of Rs 11,76,182/- also ought to have been
awarded to the petitioner from the date of payment i.e. 17.3.1998 till the date of
the award (9.1.2001). The rate of interest would be 9% per annum.

6.

The learned counsel for the petitioner has given up the claim at S.

No. 5 as also the claim at S. No. 6. Insofar as the interest claimed on the
security deposit under Sr No. 8, I find that the petitioner would be entitled to
the same. However, only at the rate of 9% per annum. The duration would be
from 1.2.1995 till the date of the award i.e., 9.1.2001. The claim at S. No. 9
was not seriously agitated and, therefore, this need not be examined any further.

7.

The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that no interest

was granted to the respondent either in respect of the counter claim, and,
Omp 131/2001

Page No.8 of 12

therefore, no interest should be granted to the petitioner because otherwise, that
would alter the balance of adjustment made by the learned arbitrator. However,
I do not find any merit in this argument because there is no such discussion in
the award that the competing interest amounts have been balanced by the
arbitrator insofar as the petitioner's and the respondent's claims are concerned.
In any event, the respondent has not filed any objections to the award on this
ground.

8.

With regard to the claim under the purchase order dated 29.8.1992

the claims to the extent of Rs 3,80,396.76 had been preferred by the
petitioner/claimant and counter claims, as per counter claim No.4 to the extent
of Rs 23,17,690.10 was made by the respondent. The details of the counter

The learned arbitrator only allowed the claims of earnest money

deposited of Rs 10,000/- to the petitioner under this work order. However,
insofar as the respondent is concerned, the learned arbitrator held that the work
executed by the petitioner under the second work order was defective. He
observed that the rain water obviously leaked through the kini foam on the
very first onslaught of rains after completion of the work.

The learned

arbitrator also found that there was no evidence found on record which could
prove that the cement concrete attributable to the Respondent could lead to
such leakage. Accordingly, the learned arbitrator held that the respondent was
entitled to recover a sum of Rs 3,76,845/- incurred for dismantling the defective
work. The learned arbitrator also held that the respondent was entitled to
recover the amount paid to the claimant for such defective work carried out by
the claimant. The amount already paid by the respondent to the claimant was to
the extent of Rs 6,08,471/-. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted
that though in the counter claim the said sum of Rs 6,08,471/- is not mentioned
at all, yet the learned arbitrator has awarded this to the respondent.

The

learned counsel also submitted that the learned arbitrator found that the work
of water-proofing carried out subsequently at the behest of the respondent by
another contractor was not similar to the work awarded to the claimant.

10.

The learned counsel for the respondent, however, submitted that the

counter-claim No. 4 was to the extent of approximately Rs 23,00,000/- and only
Omp 131/2001

Page No.11 of 12

a sum of Rs 3,76,845/- and the amount already paid of Rs 6,08,471/- was
allowed. It is not as if the respondent had not made the claim of the sum of Rs
6,08,471/-. He submitted that the counter-claim No 4 included the sum of Rs
3,76,845/- as well as other items, the total of which was to the extent of
approximately Rs 23 lacs. The learned arbitrator has not awarded the amount
claimed because he found some dissimilarity in the work but has awarded the
amount which has already been paid by the respondent to the petitioner on
account of the fact that the work was defective. Therefore, according to the
learned counsel for the respondent the award in respect of this work order
cannot be faulted.

I am in agreement with the submissions made by the

respondent in this regard. Consequently, the award in respect of the second
work order dated 29.8.1992 cannot be interfered with.

11.

With the modifications in respect of the claims qua the first work

order dated 16.3.1992 indicated above, this petition is disposed of. The amount
which is now payable by the respondent to the petitioner shall be paid within
six weeks. In case the amount is not paid within six weeks, then the interest
shall be payable thereon at the rate of 12% per annum.
