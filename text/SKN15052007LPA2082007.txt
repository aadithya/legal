SANJIV KHANNA, J:

1. M/s. Goyal M.G. Gases Pvt. Ltd has filed the present appeal under
Section 10 of Delhi High Court Act against the Order dated 19

th

LPA No.208-2007

Page 2

October, 2006 passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing it's
application under Sections 11 and 12 of the Contempt of Courts
Act, 1971 read with Article 215 of the Constitution of India praying
for initiation of contempt proceedings against the respondents. The
appellant had made 20 different parties as respondents to the said
application. M/s. Air Liquide Deutchland GMbH was respondent
no.1.
2. The appellant had entered into a share, purchase and cooperation
Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the Agreement, for short)
dated 12

th

May, 1995 with the respondent no.1. Under the said

agreement, the Goyal Group of companies was to hold 51% shares
in the appellant company with the respondent no.1 having 49%
shareholding. The said Agreement also had a non-competition
clause which provided that the respondent no.1 will give written
information to the appellant about every business transaction it
plans to take in India with regard to industrial gases and related
business, with the first right of refusal to the appellant by giving two
month's notice in writing. The agreement also provided that the

LPA No.208-2007

Page 3

respondent no.1 will give due consideration to the interest of the
appellant-company.
3. M/s. Air Liquide S.A.-respondent no.2 herein is the holding
company of the respondent no.1. Similarly, Air Liquide India
Holdings Pvt. Ltd-respondent no.3 and Air Liquide Internationalrespondent no.4 are wholly owned subsidiaries of the respondent
no.2.
4. The petitioner-appellant herein filed an application under Section 9
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 being OMP No.
361/2004 in this Court claiming that there was breach of the noncompetition clause by the respondents 1-3 herein. Vide Order dated
st

31 January, 2005, the learned Single Judge noticed that there was
earlier litigation between Goyal Group and the respondent no.1
rd

which resulted in an Order dated 23 October, 1998 being passed
in FAO(OS) No. 251/1998.

It was accordingly directed that the

respondent no.1 cannot enter into competition with the appellant.
Similar direction was issued that the respondent no.2 shall also not
compete with the appellant.

However, no injunction order was

LPA No.208-2007

Page 4

passed against the respondent no.3, inter alia, holding that the said
company was already in the same business and in competition with
the appellant and cannot be deprived and forced to discontinue it's
on-going business activities. However, to protect the interest of the
appellant it was directed that the Directors nominated by the
respondent no.1 had liberty to attend board meetings of the
appellant-company but shall not participate in those meetings in
which any matter relating to filing of tenders by the appellant
company is discussed or approved. This was to ensure secrecy of
the tenders being filled up and submitted by the appellant, as the
respondent No.3 was/is a competitor of the appellant. Learned
Single Judge also clarified that the interim order was to remain in
force till the disputes are adjudicated by the Arbitrator. It is,
therefore, apparent that no injunction order was passed against the
respondent no.3. The Respondent no.3 was therefore at liberty to
compete with the appellant and do business in India.
5. In the contempt petition which was filed before the learned Single
Judge, the appellant had alleged that the respondent no. 4, a 100%

LPA No.208-2007

Page 5

subsidiary of the respondent no.2 like the respondent no.3, had
given guarantee to Steel Authority of India Limited (hereinafter
referred to as SAIL, for short) in respect of a contract entered into
between the respondent no.3 and SAIL for supply of oxygen and
nitrogen at Bhilai, India.

The guarantee was in the nature of

financial and technical guarantee. It was pleaded that the
respondent no. 4 being a subsidiary of the respondent no.2 is
merely an agent of the respondent no.2 and both of them, once
doctrine of lifting of the corporate veil is applied, are one single
entity and therefore there is violation and willful disobedience of the
Order dated 31

st

January, 2005. Respondent nos.5-20 in the

present Appeal were also made parties as the respondent no.5 was
the Chairman of the respondent no.1 and the respondent nos. 6-16
were Members of the Executive Committee of the respondent no.2
and the respondent nos. 17-20 were Directors of the respondent
no.3. It was also alleged that the respondent no.7 was in-charge of
and responsible for the affairs of the respondent no.4 and he had
th

signed the letter of guarantee dated 7 October, 2005 on behalf of

LPA No.208-2007

Page 6

the respondent no.4.
6. Learned counsel for the appellant, during the course of his
arguments, had submitted that he was not pressing and alleging
st

willful violation or disobedience of the Order dated 31 January,
2005. It is apparent and clear that by the said Order the learned
Single Judge had refused to grant any injunction or restrain the
respondent no.3 from doing business in India as the said Company
was already in competition with the appellant and could not be
deprived from it's right to do business and carry on it's activities.
Admittedly, the respondent nos.3 and 4 are 100% subsidiaries of
the respondent no.2. Inspite of this position, no injunction order was
passed against the respondent No.3. It is therefore, obvious that
no contempt proceedings could have been initiated against the
respondent no. 4 for giving financial and technical guarantee to
SAIL, in respect of the contract entered into between the
respondent no.3 and SAIL for the simple reason that there was no
st

injunction and restraint order in the Order dated 31 January, 2005
against the respondent no. 3. Violation or contempt of the Order

LPA No.208-2007

Page 7

st

dated 31 January, 2005 is possible only if an injunction or restraint
order had been passed against the respondent no.3. We may
mention here that the learned Single Judge has referred to these
aspects in the impugned Order. It has been rightly held that the
Court dealing with contempt proceedings cannot travel beyond the
substantive order of which contempt is alleged and the rightness or
wrongness of the substantive order cannot be made the subject
matter of contempt proceedings. (Refer, Prithawi Nath Ram
versus State of Jharkhand reported in AIR 2004 SC 4277, K.G.
Derasari and another versus Union of India and others reported
in (2001) 10 SCC 496). It is also equally well settled that contempt
jurisdiction is to be used sparingly and only in cases of willful
disobedience when there is a case beyond reasonable doubt.
Contempt power is to be exercised to uphold the dignity of the
Court in larger interest of the society and for proper administration
of justice delivery system. Learned Single Judge in this regard has
referred to the judgments of the Supreme Court in the case of Shri
Baradakanta Mishra versus the Registrar of Orissa High Court

LPA No.208-2007

Page 8

and another reported in (1974) 1 SCC 374, Anil Ratan Sarkar
and others versus Hirak Ghosh and others reported in (2002) 4
SCC 21, Indian Airports Employees' Union versus Ranjan
Chatterjee and another reported in (1999) 2 SCC 537, Attorney
General versus Newspaper Publishing Plc and others reported
in (1997) III All.E.R. 159 and Shri B.K. Kar versus The Hon'ble
the Chief Justice and his companion Justices of the Orissa
High Court and another reported in AIR 1961 SC 1367.
7. In some cases, Courts have pierced the corporate veil in contempt
proceedings (See, Delhi Development Authority versus Skipper
Construction Company Pvt. Ltd. reported in 57 (1995) DLT 737
SC). However, the said doctrine should not be applied in the
present case as no injunction/restraint order was passed against
st

the respondent no.3 in the Order dated 31 January, 2005. Once
the respondent no.3 was permitted and allowed by this Court to
submit tenders and continue doing business in India, no contempt
proceedings can be initiated because the respondent no. 4 has
stood as a guarantor in a tender submitted by the respondent no.3.

LPA No.208-2007

Page 9

The short question before the learned Single Judge was whether
st

there was any willful disobedience of the Order dated 31 January,
2005 by the respondents 3 and 4 and not whether the Order dated
st

31 January, 2005 requires any modification or change. This Court
sitting in Appeal is not required to consider and go into the question
whether restrain order should have been passed against the
respondent no.3 also and the Order dated 31

st

January, 2005

refusing to grant any injunction against the respondent no.3
requires modification.
8. It may be relevant to state here that the validity of the Order dated
st

31 January, 2005 is not the subject matter of the present Appeal.
The present Appeal is specifically directed against the Order dated
19

th

October, 2006 as is clear from the heading to the present

appeal. However, in the prayer clause the appellant as an
alternative has made a prayer for declaring that the injunction order
st

dated 31 January, 2005 against the respondent no.2 is binding on
all it's subsidiaries and that all the respondents should give an
st

undertaking for honouring the injunction order dated 31 January,

LPA No.208-2007

Page 10

2005. After rejection of the present appeal under Sections 11 and
12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, we do not think that any direction
for modification of the Order dated 31

st

January, 2005 and for

extending it's scope can be passed. As stated earlier, Order dated
st

31 January, 2005 is not the subject matter of the present Appeal.
The said Order refusing to grant injunction against the respondent
no.3 has become final and binding between the parties as it was
not questioned in an appeal. By filing an appeal against the Order
th

dated 19 October, 2006 on a contempt application for violation of
st

Order dated 31 January, 2005, the appellant herein cannot expand
the scope and jurisdiction of this Court and question and challenge
st

the Order dated 31 January, 2005 itself. Appeal against the Order
dated 31

st

January, 2005 is barred by limitation. The appellant

cannot get over the period of limitation by this ingenious method.
Moreover, as already stated above, it is well settled that in
contempt proceedings Courts cannot go beyond the Order which is
made the basis for invoking the contempt jurisdiction.

The

appellant in this circuitous manner cannot be permitted and allowed

LPA No.208-2007

Page 11

to challenge the Order dated 31

st

January, 2005, in an appeal

arising out of an order passed in contempt proceedings for alleged
st

violation of order dated 31 January, 2005. The Order on which the
contempt proceedings were based cannot be challenged in an
appeal filed against the order dismissing the contempt application.
The only issue which arises for consideration by this appellate court
is whether the respondent No.3 and 4 have violated order dated
st

31 January, 2005. On this Learned Counsel for the appellant has
admitted that the said respondents have not disobeyed the order
st

dated 31 January, 2005 as no injunction order was passed against
the respondent No.3. Infact, injunction against respondent No.3
was specifically refused.
9. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is selfcontradictory and mutually destructive. On the one hand, it is
st

alleged that the Order dated 31 January, 2005 has been violated
and at the same time in the alternative it is submitted that the Order
st

dated 31 January, 2005 may be set aside to the extent that no
injunction/restrain order was passed against the respondent no.3.
As an appellate Court, under Section 10 of the Delhi High Court
Act, we are concerned with the legality of the impugned Order

LPA No.208-2007

Page 12

th

st

dated 19 October, 2006 and not with the Order dated 31 January,
2006.
10.It may also be relevant to state here that the Order dated 19

th

October, 2006 was also made subject matter of Special Leave
Petition No.20166/2006 before the Supreme Court presumably on
the ground that

the Order dismissing the contempt application

under Sections 11 and 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 is
not appealable in an intra-court appeal as held by the Supreme
Court in case of

Midnapore Peoples' Coop. Bank Ltd. v.

Chunilal Nanda, reported in (2006) 5 SCC 399. Similar contentions
as raised in the present Appeal were also raised before the
th

Supreme Court in the SLP which was dismissed on 13 December,
2006.

Now the same Order dated 19

th

October, 2006 is again

sought to be challenged before this Court.
11.In view of the above, we do not find any merit in the present Appeal
and the same is liable to be dismissed.
