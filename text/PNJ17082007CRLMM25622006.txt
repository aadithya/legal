Complainant, a division of Panchagni Energies

himself as proprietor of M/s EEM Gee International and stated
that he was a garment fabricator having a factory at C-163,
Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-I, New Delhi. It was further stated
that since the complainant had an export order for jogging
suits, the job work for stitching the jogging suits was entrusted
to G.Bhattacharya. Terms of the agreement were reduced into
writing as per agreement dated 14.6.2004.

It was further

stated in the complaint that in terms of the agreement dated
14.6.2004, fabric was procured from Vallabh Yarns Pvt.Ltd.,
Ludhiana. That it was directly delivered to the accused.

That

part payment of the fabric to Vallabh Yarns Pvt.Ltd., Ludhiana
was made by the complainant and as per the agreement dated
14.6.2004 part payment had to be made by the accused. It

Petitioner seeks quashing of the complaint inter

page 5 of 8

alia alleging that by a subsequent agreement dated 10.7.2004
it was agreed that the accused

would

fabricate only 2520

jogging suits and not 7320.
9.

He states that he received

only 2520 jogging suits.

fabric to manufacture

It is stated that the accused

manufactured 2520 jogging suits but the complainant never
came to lift the material and hence the accused had no option
but to deal with the goods manufactured as he desired.
10.

Seeking quashing of the complaint, it is stated that

the petitioner

received 4007.73 kg. of fabric from Vallabh

Yarns Pvt.Ltd. It is stated in the petition that 3330 kg. fabric
was used to fabricate 2520 jogging suits. It is stated that out
of 4007.73 kg. fabric received from Vallabh Yarns Pvt.Ltd.,
some fabric was diverted to M/s Context Exports at the asking
of the complainant.
11.

Complainant

denies

having

entered

into

any

subsequent agreement much less agreement dated 10.7.2004
to reduce the number of jogging suits to be manufactured by
the accused from 7320 to 2520 sets.
12.

It was urged by the learned counsel for the

petitioner that the petitioner had paid Rs.3 lacs to M/s Vallabh
Yarns Pvt.Ltd.
Crl.M.C.2562/04

page 6 of 8

13.

On the afore-noted facts, following features stand

out :a)

Agreement dated 14.6.2004 is not in dispute.

b)

The alleged agreement dated 10.7.2004 is
disputed by the

complainant.

Thus evidence is

required.
c)

Petitioner admits receiving 4007.73 kg. fabric
from M/s Vallabh Yarns Pvt.Ltd. but states that
1240.10 kg. was diverted to M/s Context Exports at
the asking of the complainant.

d)

If what is stated by the accused is correct,
accused has consumed 2763.63 kg. of fabric.

e)

The

accused

has

to

account

for

said

consumption.
f)

Whether the complainant refused to lift 2520
jogging suits which fabricated

or not requires

evidence to be led.
14.

Prima facie, there being an entrustment of fabric to

the accused, the accused has to account for the same.
Assuming that the accused has paid Rs.3 lacs to M/s Vallabh
Yarns Pvt.Ltd., accused could not have appropriated the entire
yarn.

At best, accused was entitled to recover Rs.3 lacs plus

Crl.M.C.2562/04

page 7 of 8

the fabrication cost.
15.

As a fabricator, and being entrusted with the fabric,

the accused was under a fiduciary relationship with the
complainant.
16.

I refrain from discussing the various letters which

were exchanged between the parties for the reason, any
discussion thereon may prejudice the trial.
17.

Sufficer would it be to note that at this stage, what

is required to be considered is, whether the complaint makes
out a case for taking

cognizance

thereof and proceeding

against the accused.
18.

On the broad contours of the controversy noted

herein above, it cannot be said that the complaint does not
make out a case to proceed and take cognizance of offence
under Section 409/420 IPC.
19.

The petition is dismissed.
