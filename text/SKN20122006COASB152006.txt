SANJIV KHANNA, J :

1. M/s Shonkh Technologies Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the appellant)

in the present appeal under Section 10F of the Companies Act, 1956
(hereinafter referred to as Act) has impugned order dated 20.4.2006
passed by the Company Law Board in CP No.37/2003. By the
impugned order, learned Company Law Board has allowed the petition
under Section 237 (b) of the Act seeking investigation into the affairs of
the appellant.
2. In the grounds of appeal as originally filed, no question of law was

framed. Subsequently, an application for amendment was filed to
incorporate specific questions of law. This application was allowed vide
order dated 06.10.2006 and it was directed that the questions of law
mentioned in the application will be treated as part of the main appeal.
As many as 18 questions of law have been framed by the appellant.
3. The appellant had submitted that the impugned order was perverse,

based on no findings/evidence and the conditions prerequisite to direct

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.3

investigation under Section 237 (b) of the Act are not satisfied in the
present case. Reliance was placed upon the two judgments of the
Supreme Court in M/s Barium Chemicals and Another versus Company
Law Board and others (AIR 1967 SC 295) and Rohtas Industries Ltd.
versus S.D. Aggarwal and Ors. (AIR 1969 SC 707).
4. Learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for Union of India in his

brief argument submitted that an appeal under Section 10F of the Act is
maintainable only on question of law and the findings and decision
given by the Company Law Board were findings of fact. No question of
law arises.
5. On the basis of submissions made, the following question of law is

framed for being answered
Whether order dated 20.4.2006 passed by Company Law Board is
perverse and whether conditions of section 237(b) of the
Companies Act,1956 are satisfied in the present case?
6. The appellant was incorporated on 04.9.1998 as a Public Limited

company. Certificate of commencement of business was obtained on
08.9.1998. The main objects of the appellant are to do business in the
fields of electronics, electrical, technical, mechanical developing,
marketing software system, solutions, designing etc.
7. By an agreement dated 15.7.2000, the appellant sold the entire

business undertaking to another company M/s Shree Jee Yatayat

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.4

(India) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as SYIL). Business undertaking of
the appellant was valued at Rs.1,10,25,64,745/- in the business
purchase agreement dated 15.7.2000 between the appellant and SYIL.
This business purchase agreement also specifically records that as
SYIL had agreed to purchase the undertaking “net of all liabilities” and
the past arrears of taxes, charges, levies, outstanding dues and claims,
free of all encumbrances. (see Annexure G to the appeal fled before this
Court).
8. No amount was paid to the appellant for transfer of the entire business

undertaking. SYIL did not pay any consideration for purchase of the
business undertaking. On the other hand, the shareholders of the
appellant were allotted 1,52,73,093/- of shares of Rs.10/- each in SYIL,
as value received for transfer of the undertaking by the appellant. This
allotment to the shareholders of the appellant in SYIL was made at a
premium of Rs.60/- per share. In other words, the appellant transferred
it's entire business undertaking minus all past liabilities to SYIL of value
of Rs.1,10,25,64,754/-, with the shareholders of the appellant acquiring
the shares of face value of Rs.15,27,30,930/- in SYIL (see Annexure-G
of the appeal avernments made in para IX of the application filed before
the Company Law Board and para 2 of the impugned order).
9. Thus, SYIL acquired a business undertaking which was valued at more

than Rs.110 crores by allotting 1,52,73,093/- shares of Rs.10/- each to
the shareholders of the appellant or for about Rupees 15.27 crores
(approximately). The shareholders of the appellant, paid premium of
Rs.60/- per share of SYIL. Even if we take this premium of Rs.60/- per
share into consideration, there was shortfall of Rs. 3,28,37,141/- (Rs
110,25,64,745-value of the undertaking minus Rs. 106,97,27,604.05 –
alleged value of the shares received).

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.5

10. Allotment of shares did not result in any monetary outflow or payment

by SYIL. Paid up capital of SYIL increased.
11. The appellant was a private limited company but shares of SYIL were

listed. In the report given by the Securities and Exchange Board of India
(hereinafter referred to as SEBI) and as mentioned in para 2(a) of the
order dated 20.04.2006, shares of SYIL were not traded between 13th
May, 1999 to 9th August, 2000. On 13th May, 1999, they were last traded
for Rs.2.15 per share. Prior to the said date in 1999, the shares were
traded in the range of Rs.2/- to Rs.7/-. Therefore, on the date when
business purchase agreement dated 15th July, 2000 was entered into,
the last traded price of the share of SYIL of face value of Rs.10/- each
was for Rs.2.15 i.e. the share was traded at discount of Rs.7.85 per
share. Market value of each share of face value of Rs.10/- on 15th July,
2000 was only Rs.2.15/-. Shockingly, the shares of SYIL were alloted to
the shareholders of the appellant at the premium of Rs.60/- per share,
when actually the allotment should have been at a discount.
12. Securities and Exchange Board of India in it's report has also pointed

out that preferential allotment to the shareholders of the appellant at the
premium of Rs.60/- per share for each share of face value of Rs.10/-,
was taken as the basis by the Bombay Stock Exchange to fix the base
price for the shares of SYIL, after acquisition of the business
undertaking of the appellant.
13. The report of the SEBI also shows that the scrip price of the SYIL

jumped thereafter from Rs.75.55 on 9th August, 2000 to Rs.463.30 on
28th September, 2000.The trade was however on very low volumes. It
attracted circuit filter level of 8% on each day i.e. rose by 8% from the
previous closing on each trading day during the period 9th August, 2000
to 28th September, 2000. The price increased from Rs.75/- to Rs.463/-

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.6

in this short period of time. Thereafter, there was increase in volumes
but the price started falling and reached Rs.210/- on 3rd November,
2000. Subsequently, the price moved between Rs.220/- to Rs.330/-.
The relevant portion of the report of the SEBI is as under:“As indicated in the earlier report, the period of
investigation was divided into 2 stages based on
price/volume movements. Stage 1 covered the period
August 9, 2000 to September 28, 2000 (Sett. Nos. 2027) when the price moved up very sharply (almost at
circuit filter level i.e. at 8% higher than the closing
price of the previous day). The price increased from
Rs.70/- to Rs.445/- in a very short period of time. This
price increase was on low volumes. Stage 2 covered
the period September, 29, 2000 to March 2, 2001
when the fell from high of around Rs./440/- to Rs.
265/-. This stage was characterised by sharp increase
in volumes.
The shares of the company were not traded between
13th May, 1999 to 9th August, 2000. The last trade was
at Rs.2.15 on 13th May, 1999. Prior to this date the
scrip was trading in the range of Rs.2/- to Rs.7/-. For
the new shares of the company (which were allotted
on a preferential allotment basis to the shareholders of
the unlisted company as consideration for purchase of
the business undertaking), the BSE had fixed base
price of Rs.70/-. This was derived from the price at
which shares were allotted to shareholders or
erstwhile Shonkh Technology Ltd.
The price of scrip went up from Rs.75.55 on August 9,
2000 to Rs.463.30 on September, 28, 2000 on very
low volumes. After September 29, 2000 and upto
December 8, 2000, there was an increase in volumes
but the price started falling and reached Rs.210/- on
3rd November, 2000. Thereafter, the prices were
moving in a narrow range of Rs.220/- to Rs.350/accompanied with large volumes. The price volume
data is as shown in Annexure A.”

15. It is, therefore, clear that prior to “acquisition of the business

undertaking of the appellant”, SYIL though a listed company was closely
held and almost the entire shareholding was held by the said seven
shareholders. These shareholders of SYIL substantially gained by
acquiring the business undertaking of the Appellant valued at Rs.110
crores by allotting shares of SYIL having market value of Rs.2.15/- at a
premium of Rs.60/- per share of face value of Rs.10/-. I may mention
here that as per the balance sheet of SYIL for the period ending 31st
March, 2000, the said company had brought forward losses of
Rs.28,80,000/-.
16. It may be relevant to state here that in the due diligence report given by

Amar Chand & Mangaldas & A. Shroff & Co. dated 10th October, 2000
in the case of SYIL, it has been recorded as under:“SYIL does not presently have any employees and

therefore does not have any registered code number
under the Provident Fund or the Employees State
Insurance legislations. The same may be required
pursuant to the business transfer whereby the
employees of STL will be transferred to SYIL.

SYIL did not apply for registration as an NBFC even
when it was carrying out NBFC activities. It has not
applied for any exemption either.”

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.9

17. As per 'due diligence report' given by Amarchand Mangaldas Suresh S.

Shroff and Co., Sales Tax Registration of SYIL had been cancelled.
SYIL did not also have any certificate under the Shop and
Establishment Act. The said company had not maintained complete and
accurate corporate register in accordance with the relevant provisions
pertaining to disclosure of interest of directors. Further SYIL had been
carrying on activities as a non-banking financial company though it was
not registered as a non-banking financial company with the Reserve
Bank of India. These violations were serious.
18. It was repeatedly argued before me on behalf of the appellant that the

avernments in the petition and the finding given by the Company Law
Board that the appellant had suffered loss of Rs.104.77 Crores due to
transfer of business to SYIL is unsubstantiated. It is not the figure but
whether there was loss suffered that is material and relevant. It was
argued that Company Law Board has failed to appreciate and
understand that full value of the undertaking was paid by SYIL by
allotment of shares to the shareholders of the appellant. It was
submitted that it was not necessary for SYIL to pay sale consideration to
the appellant and allotment of shares to the shareholders of the
appellant was for valuable consideration. This argument over looks the
facts and figures stated above. In paragraph VIII of the petition under

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.10

Section 237(b) it was alleged that the appellant had incurred loss of
Rs.104.77 crores due to transfer of business to SYIL. The question is
not whether shares were allotted to appellant or the shareholders of the
appellant, but what was the corresponding market value of the shares
allotted in lieu of transfer of undertaking by the appellant to SYIL.
Admittedly, as per agreement for purchase dated 15th July, 1999, the
total value of the undertaking was Rs.110.25 crores and for transfer of
the said undertaking shares of face value of Rs.10/- each were allotted
in SYIL at a premium of Rs.60/- per share but the market value of these
shares as per last quoted price was Rs.2.15.
19. The above facts are startling by themselves and justify investigation

under Section 237 (b) of the Act into the affairs of the appellant. The
above facts are virtually un-rebutted and un-challenged. These facts are
not new but are duly mentioned and recorded by the Ld. Company Law
Board in its order while referring to the submissions of the parties and
its findings. I have only collated them. I have gone into the factual
aspects as the appellant has questioned the findings of the tribunal on
the ground that the same are perverse and completely contrary to
evidence on record. In view of the evidence and material discussed
above, this portion of the question has to be answered against the
appellant.

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

20. The

Page no.11

second aspect of the question framed above relates to

interpretation of section 237(b) of the Act and whether on the findings
the provision has been rightly invoked.
21. Section 237(b) of the Act reads as under:-

(b) may do so in its opinion or in the opinion of the
Board there are circumstances suggesting-

i.

ii.

iii.

that the business of the company is being
conducted with intent to defraud its creditors,
members or any other persons, or otherwise for
a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or in a
manner oppressive of any of its members, or
that the company was formed for any fraudulent
or unlawful purpose;
that persons concerned in the formation of the
company or the management of its affairs have
in connection therewith been guilty of fraud,
misfeasance or other misconduct towards the
company or towards any of its members; or
that the members of the company have not
been given all the information with respect to its
affairs which they might reasonably expect,
including information relating to the calculation
of the commission payable to a managing or
other director, or the manager, of the company.

22. Section 237(b) of the Act can be invoked and is without

prejudice to the powers of the Central Government under
Section 235 of the Act. The said Section has three different

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.12

clauses. Conditions mentioned in any of the three clauses
should be satisfied for directing investigation under section
237(b) of the Act. The first clause requires satisfaction of
the Company Law Board that the business of the company
is being conducted with the intent to defraud its creditors,
shareholders or any other person. It also comes into
operation when business of the company is being
conducted for fraudulent or unlawful purpose or when a
company is formed for the said purpose or when business is
being conducted in a manner oppressive to its members.
Secondly, the provision can be invoked when a person
concerned with the formation or management of the affairs
of the company is guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other
misconduct towards the company or its members. The
words “other misconduct” widens the scope of the said
provision. Thus conduct, which is not strictly fraud and
misfeasance

but

conduct

which

is

dis-honourable,

unprincipled and shameful is also covered by the said subclause. The third clause applies when all information in
respect of the affairs of the company is not given to it's
members.

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.13

23. For Section 237 (b) of the Act to be invoked there should be

“circumstances suggesting” that the conditions mentioned in
the three sub-clauses are satisfied. A final, definitive
opinion, therefore, is not required at the stage of passing of
an order under Section 237(b). The reason is apparent
because investigation is still to be conducted. The provision
is essentially of an exploratory character. What is to be
decided at this stage is whether exploration/investigation is
required and should be ordered. The words “circumstances
suggesting” cannot be interpreted to mean conclusive proof.
Otherwise, the provision will be rendered nugatory and
completely toothless. Investigation is not required if facts
are already established. At the same time, the legislature
has been careful to use the words “defraud”, “fraudulent”,
“unlawful purposes”, “misfeasance”,” other misconduct”
“lack of information”, etc. “Circumstances suggesting” must
necessarily indicate fraud, misfeasance or like conduct or
activities on the part of the company. The provision cannot
be lightly invoked on mere suspicion. Supreme Court in the
case of Rohtas Industries versus S.T. Aggarwal and others
reported in (1969) 1 SCC 325 has held that the words

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.14

“circumstances

suggesting”

require

inference

of

enumerated kind which should be demonstrable. It is not
sufficient to merely assert that circumstances exist without
specifying

the

material

and

evidence.

The

words

“circumstances suggesting” do not support the construction
that even existence of circumstances is a matter of
subjective opinion. Referring to Shelat, J.'s opinion in the
case of Barium Chemicals Ltd. and another versus
Company Law Board reported in AIR 1967 SC 295,
distinction was drawn between subjective process and
formation of opinion and existence of circumstances on
which the opinion is founded. The said judgment also
explains the scope of judicial review in cases where
discretionary administrative orders are under challenge.
(Section 237(b) of the Act, after amendment, however
requires a quasi judicial order to be passed by the Company
Law Board and investigation can be ordered by the said
Board, if the conditions specified in the three sub-clauses
are satisfied.) In the said case, the Supreme Court came to
the conclusion that the opinion formed was wholly irrational
as there was no evidence with regard to the market price of

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.15

the shares of Albion Plywoods Ltd. on or about 6th May,
1960 though allegation had been made and accepted by the
Central Government that the shares were sold for
inadequate consideration on 6th May, 1960.This was the
foundation of the administrative order passed by the Central
Government. It was held that without material and evidence,
Central Government had presumed fraud in the sale of the
shares. Suspicion by itself, in these circumstances, it was
held was not justification to precipitate action. However, the
Supreme Court also noticed that in Barium Chemicals
(supra), there was difference of opinion between A.K.
Sarkar, C.J. and Madholkar, J. on the one side and
Hidayatullah, J. and Shelat J. on the other side. In Barium
Chemicals (supra), the Supreme Court, while dealing with
the question whether the said provision falls foul of the
fundamental right to carry on business under Article 19(1)
(g) of the Constitution of India, held that investigation when
ordered was bound to cause inconvenience and affect
credit worthiness of a company but the provision was
reasonable. It was held that the aforesaid provision cannot
be regarded as an unreasonable restriction on right of a

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.16

party to carry on business. Reference in this regard was
made to the judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of
Raja Narayanlal Bansilal versus Maneck Phitoz Mistry
(1961) 1 SCR 417 wherein it has been held as under:“30. ...A company is a creature of the statute. There

can be no doubt that one of the objects of the
Companies Act is to throw open to all citizens the
privilege of carrying on business with limited liability.
Inevitably the business of the company has to be
carried on through human agency, and that sometimes
gives rise to irregularities and malpractices in the
management of the affairs of the company. If persons
in charge of the management of companies abuse their
position and make personal profit at the cost of the
creditors, contributories and others interested in the
company, that raises a problem which is very much
different from the problem of ordinary misappropriation
or breach of trust. The interest of the company is the
interest of several persons who constitute the
company, and thus persons in management of the
affairs of such companies can be classed by
themselves as distinct from other individual citizens. A
citizen can and may protect his own interest, but where
the financial interest of a large number of citizens is left
in charge of persons who manage the affairs of the
companies it would be legitimate to treat such
companies and their managers as a class by
themselves and to provide for necessary safeguards
and checks against a possible abuse of power vesting
in the managers. If the relevant provisions of the Act
dealing with enquiries and investigations of the affairs
of the companies are considered from this point of view
there would be no difficulty in holding that Article 14 is
not violated either by Section 239 or Section 240 of the
new Act.”

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.17

24.The above observations made almost half a century ago
are perhaps more relevant today. With opening up of the
economy and deregulation, we have had cases where by
employing ingenuous methods and tactics some dishonest
persons have managed to intrude and evade safeguards in
force. Common man is today making huge investments in
the stock market and shares. His interest is paramount.
Reasonable invasion, once grounds for investigation exit,
into right to carry on business, to protect interest of common
man is justified. There is no incongruous friction between
the two. Success of liberalisation depends upon the
regulatory and supervisory machinists weeding out the
unscrupulous and the corrupt and not to protect them. What
is required is not a fragile but a robust supervisory
framework, which is just and fair.
25.The main pillar of free market economic system, is
integrity and full, correct, true and open information. Without
integrity and reliable information, free market economic
system can lead to frauds, mismanagement and ultimately
collapse. Integrity and information can be achieved through

Scams

and

manipulations of share prices, and insider trading, on atleast two occasions has caused losses with general public
and institutions taking the brunt. The complexion of
economic fraud has changed dramatically. It has become
complex and much more difficult to unravel and uncover.
Investigation to un-cover frauds once grounds exits are
required. In this climate, courts have to tread carefully and
strike a fine balance between free market system and
enforcement- a natural corollary to liberalization.
26.Other contentions raised by the appellant with reference
to section 237(b) of the Act and the impugned order
directing investigation may now be noticed. It was submitted
by the appellant that separate proceedings were initiated
under different enactments, the object and purpose being to

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.19

investigate into the affairs of the appellant. Reference was
made to the report given by SEBI, investigation done by CBI
and proceedings under Section 209A of the Act and it was
submitted that investigation under 237(b) should not be
permitted as there was duplicacy of proceedings and
therefore harassment. This argument has to be rejected.
Each authority has been conferred specific power under
respective statutes. They examine and investigate with
reference to the purpose and object of the enactment. The
angle and facet of investigation under each enactment is
separate. It cannot be said that the power of investigation
under Section 237(b) of the Act is similar to the powers
conferred on SEBI or CBI. In fact the argument raised is to
some extent self-defeating. It accepts that material and
evidence exists. Reference in this regard may be made to
the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of London
United Investments Plc reported in 1991 All ER 849 wherein
it has been held as under:“The power of Secretary of State to appoint inspectors
to investigate the affairs of a company and to report is
an important regulatory mechanism for ensuring probity
in the management of company's affairs. That of

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.20

course is in the public interest. Since the Secretary of
State's powers under section 432 (2) are exercisable
where there are circumstances suggesting fraud, it is
likely that in many cases where inspectors are
appointed an investigation by the police or the Serious
Fraud Office could also be appropriate. But the code
under the 1985 Act is a separate code even though it
may overlap the field of criminal investigation.”

27.Merely filing of a complaint by SEBI for violation of the
provisions of Securities Exchange Board of India does not
in any manner curtail or bar investigation under Section
237(b) of the Act. Once the provisions of the said Section
are satisfied, the fact that the SEBI has filed prosecution, is
not a bar. The scope and ambit of SEBI's findings and filing
of prosecution under the Securities Exchange Board of
India Act are relevant but distinct in several aspects.
Consequences that follow are different. A different offence,
under a separate enactment cannot be condoned because
proceedings have been initiated for violation of another
enactment.
28.Another contention raised was that investigation has
already been done and completed and therefore an order
permitting investigation under section 237(b) of the Act

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.21

serves no purpose. This argument also has to be rejected.
Some more facts and allegations made in the application
may be looked into. The appellant had spent Rs.6.37 crores
in the years 1999 and Rs.6.44 crores in the year 2000
towards consultation fee. Similarly, as per the balance sheet
for the period ending 31st December, 1999 more than
Rs.7.26 crores was allegedly spent on research and
development activities. In the reply filed by the appellant
before the Company Law Board, expenditure of more than
Rs.7.26 crores, it was stated was normal and ordinary
general business expenditure. It was further stated that the
appellant company was dealing with software technology
and developing software and, therefore, consultancy fee
was required to be paid. The reply is devoid of material
particulars and relevant details with regard to nature and
type of software developed, price of software, the parties to
whom software was sold etc. It is interesting in this regard
to refer to some of the vouchers and bills, which have been
enclosed by the appellant in support of the contention that it
was genuinely developing and or selling software. Two
invoices were raised allegedly by the appellant against Jai

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.22

Prakash Industries Limited dated 17th November, 1999 and
4th

December,

1999

for

Rs.5,15,50,000/-

and

Rs.5,35,00,000/-. The bills do not specifically state the type
of software purchased and thereafter sold to Jai Prakash
Industries Limited. It refers to some agreement dated 16th
June, 1999 but the said agreement was/is not placed on
record.
29.Similarly, there were alleged transactions between the
appellant and Padmini Technologies Limited, a company
managed and controlled by Mr. Vivek Nagpal who was also
a director in the appellant company. It was alleged in the
application that the appellant had advanced Rs.9.35 crores
to Padmini Technologies Limited. This was disputed and
denied by the appellant in the reply. It was stated that the
company had entered into transaction with Padmini
Technologies Limited for sale and purchase of computer
software. Annexure A filed to the reply shows that as on 1st
April, 2000 Rs.5,85,24,000/- was due and payable by

30.The nature and type of software, quantity supplied etc.
are missing. It may be relevant to state here that there are
allegations against Padmini Technologies Ltd. also, that it
was manipulating and involved in the share market scam
along with Ketan Parekh Group. It may be relevant to state
here that Padmini Technologies Limited was also a

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.25

shareholder to the extent of 77,0 6,000 shares (or 17.72 %
in value terms) in the appellant company.
31.Allegation was also made in the petition that Padmini
Technologies Limited had incurred a huge loss on the sale
of the shares of the appellant company. The appellant had
denied this and relied upon Annexure F to the reply filed
before the Company Law Board. Perusal of Annexure F
shows that 27,06,000 shares held by Padmini Technologies
Limited in the appellant were transferred to M/s Ankur
Cultivators (P) Limited for consideration of Re.1/- only.
These

shares

had

been

purchased

by

Padmini

Technologies Limited for Rs.38,17,80,000/-. The shares
allotted to Padmini Technologies Limited in SYIL, in the
reply filed by the appellant before the Company Law Board,
were described as bonus shares. The reply affidavit on
behalf of the appellant has been filed by none other than
Mr. Vivek Nagpal, who was also a controlling Director in
Padmini Technologies Limited. It was further claimed that
on sale of shares of SYIL, Padmini Technologies Limited
had made net profit of Rs.25,88,728/- . The alleged profit is

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.26

calculated by taking sale price of SYIL between Rs.142.50
per share to Rs.19.79 per share. However, no details of the
dates on which the alleged sales were made, to whom sales
were made and whether the sale amount has been
released, was mentioned and stated.
32.It was also alleged in the petition that the appellant had
advanced Rs.7 crores to Adani Export Limited which in turn
had advanced money to Ketan Parekh Group. The amount
mentioned in the petition was not denied by the appellant
but it was stated that the transaction was for supply and
development of software but what was the nature and type
of software, whether there was any agreement etc., were
not furnished.
33.As on 31st March, 2000 the shareholding pattern of the

34.The authorized share capital of the appellant is Rs.20 crores. The
issued share capital as on 15.7.2000 was Rs.15.27 crores. As per the
application filed under Section 237 (b), the appellant company was
controlled by companies and the person belonging to Ketan Parekh
Group. The details of these companies and individuals are in the
application filed by the UOI before the Company Law Board including
Annexure-I.
35.Classic Credit Limited, Panther Fincap and Management Services
Limited and Panther Investrade Limited as per the allegations made by

of

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.28

Union of India, belong to Ketan Parekh Group of companies. These
companies were also selling clients of Broker -Credit Suisse First
Boston India Securities Private Limited. The said broker along with
some other brokers as per the SEBI report had created artificial market
in certain scripts and assisted, abetted and indulged in market
manipulations in entities connected with Ketan Parekh Group.
36.Learned counsel for the respondent during the course of arguments
had relied upon the closure report submitted by Central Bureau of
Investigation in case No. RC 7(E)/2003 in the case of the appellant and
some other individuals. This FIR was registered on the basis of
complaint made by Unit Trust of India Growth Fund. As per the closure
report, allegation made by Unit Trust of India Growth Fund was that it
was cheated. It was alleged that UTI Growth Fund had applied for
allotment of shares in the appellant company through private placement
by paying premium of Rs.120/- per share. It was alleged that the Equity
Research Cell a Department of Unit Trust of India had not
recommended subscription by private placement and as per the
estimate, the moderate rate of each shares of the appellant was Rs.30/to Rs.36/- per share. It was further alleged that till September, 1999, the
appellant company had not launched any products of it's own but

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.29

substantial amount of more than Rs.16 Crores had been disbursed and
paid. Central Bureau of Investigation, however, recommended closure
as it was found that Unit Trust of India had been able to sell shares of
SYIL for consideration of Rs.24.30 crores and, therefore, had not
suffered loss. Thus, Central Bureau of Investigation felt that case for
cheating under Section 420 IPC and 409 IPC read with Section 120B
IPC was not made out. The report of the Central Bureau of Investigation
dealt with a very limited aspect and was not at all concerned with the
market manipulation, money laundering, conduct of the business and
affairs of the appellant etc. The report by the Central Bureau of
Investigation focussed itself only on the question whether the Unit Trust
of India Growth Fund was able to recover the investment made. Once it
was found that the investment had been recovered, Central Bureau of
Investigation recommended closure of the case. The said report does
not, support the case of the respondent and is not relevant for the
issues and questions involved in the present case.
37.I may refer here to the agreement dated 11th August, 1999, which
was entered into between Unit Trust of India (Fund manager for the
India Growth Fund Unit Scheme) and the appellant. Unit Trust of India
had agreed to invest Rs.14.95 crores in the appellant by applying for

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.30

allotment of 11,50,000 equity shares of face value of Rs.10/- on private
placement basis for a premium of Rs.120/-. Unit Trust of India had also
agreed to provide financial assistance for part financing for setting up of
two divisions i.e. Software Development Division and Convergence
Technology Division at total cost of Rs.57.32 crores. The said
agreement specifically provides that unless Unit Trust of India agreed,
the appellant would not undertake or permit any merger, consolidation,
re-organistion, scheme of arrangement or compromise with its creditors,
shareholders or effect any scheme of amalgamation or reconstruction. It
was stipulated that the appellant shall not issue any equity or preference
shares and change its capital structure, create any charge on assets or
give guarantees without it's approval. Shares of the appellant were also
required to be pledged by the promoters of the appellant.
38.A company is a separate and distinct entity in law. It is an artificial
person. Shareholders are entitled to dividend but are not owners of the
property owned by and belonging to the company. The shareholders
cannot also claim right in consideration received by the company on
sale of it's property. This has to be understood in light of the agreement
between Unit Trust of India Growth Fund and the appellant company.
SYIL was not a party to the said agreement. Therefore, transaction

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.31

between the appellant and SYIL to allot shares to the shareholders of
the appellant and not allot any shares to the appellant on transfer of the
business undertaking, appears to be unusual. As a result of the transfer
of the undertaking minus all the liabilities, the appellant was merely
reduced to a shell company with the understanding that application will
be filed to get it's name struck from the office of Registrar of Companies.
By allotting shares to the shareholders of the appellant in SYIL, the
appellant got over the terms agreed upon with Unit Trust of India not to
issue any equity or preference shares, change the capital structure etc.,
without its approval. At the same time, SYIL had the advantage of
claiming that a Government of India institution viz. Unit Trust of India
had made investment in SYIL.
39.Learned counsel for the respondent in order to justify the
transactions for transfer of undertaking also relied upon documentary
due diligence report of Amar Chand & Mangaldas & A. Shroff & Co. in
the case of the appellant and SYIL. Interestingly, both the reports are
dated 10th October, 2000 whereas the agreement to purchase the
business undertaking had been entered on 15th July, 2000. The report
specifically states that it is merely a report on requisite legal
compliances with reference to questionnaire submitted by the said

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.32

companies. It is full of privileges and conditions. One of them being that
it should not be disclosed to any third party or used by any third party
without prior consent. These reports in no way support the contentions
of the appellant. It also appears that the said solicitors were not
informed that the transaction for transfer of business undertaking had
already been completed as it is mentioned in the report relating to the
appellant, that the said report is required for the purpose of transfer of
the entire business undertaking as a going concern. If there is any
earlier report it has not been brought on record.
40.There is a difference between transfer of an undertaking on payment
of sale consideration and scheme of amalgamation/merger, which are
sanctioned by a Court under Sections 391-394 of the Act. Before a
scheme is sanctioned under Sections 391-394 of the Act, Regional
Director/Central Government is required to examine and scrutinise the
scheme. The Courts also have power to reject the scheme. This is not
so when there is a private transaction or sale between two companies.
No scrutiny or approval of the Court is required.
41. Accordingly, the question of law as formulated above is answered in
favour of the respondent and against the appellant. The present Appeal
is dismissed. The appellant will also pay costs which are assessed at

CO.APPEAL (SB) 15/2006

Page no.33

Rs.10,000/-. The costs will be deposited with the Official Liquidator
within three weeks and will form part of the common pool fund.
