T.S.THAKUR, J. (ORAL)
CM No.3733/2006
There is a delay of 120 days in the filing of this

FAO(OS) 116/2006

Page 1 of 8

appeal. The appellant has moved the present application
for

condonation of the same.

The respondent has not

chosen to file any objections to the application although it
was argued on his behalf by the learned counsel that the
averments made in the application do not make out a case
for condonation.

We do not think so.

A reading of the

application which is accompanied by an affidavit shows
that although the order passed by the learned Single Judge
was pronounced on 12th September, 2005, a copy of the
same was received in the office of the appellant only on
29th September, 2005.

The matter thereafter appears to

have been placed before the Arbitration Board of the
appellant authority who discussed the issue and resolved
on 30th December, 2005 to file an appeal against the award
of the arbitrator insofar as the same related to claims No.8
& 9. The present appeal filed thereafter on 7th February,
2006 was however delayed by 120 days. This delay, it is
evident, is primarily on account of the time taken by the
appellant in processing the papers for taking a decision in
the matter and for completing the necessary formalities for

FAO(OS) 116/2006

Page 2 of 8

presentation of the appeal.

In the circumstances,

therefore, we are inclined to condone the delay but subject
to cost of Rs.5,000/- to be deposited with Delhi High Court
Advocates Welfare Fund.

The application is accordingly

allowed and delay condoned subject to the above condition.
CM No.3733/2006 is disposed of.

Admit.

The appeal has been heard for final disposal with

consent.
3.

The parties entered into a contract for construction of

120 LIG and 204MIG Flats in Block-A, Pocket N, Shalimar
Bagh, New Delhi.

The agreement executed between the

parties envisaged adjudication of disputes by a sole
arbitrator.

Disputes having arisen between the parties,

the

were

same

referred

to

the

sole

arbitration

of

Sh.K.D.Bali who made an award dated 3.8.1989. Aggrieved
by the award of a sum of Rs.10,00,000 under claims No.8
and 9 and interest @ 12% per annum awarded on the
amount held payable to the claimant, the appellant filed
objections which were heard and eventually disposed of by
FAO(OS) 116/2006

Page 3 of 8

a Single bench of this Court in terms of his order dated 12th
September, 2005. The objections raised by the appellant
related primarily to the award of Rs.10 Lacs towards
damages for the prolongation of the work period for
reasons attributable entirely to the appellant and on
account

of

infructuous

expenditure

incurred

by

the

claimant on the maintenance of establishment tools and
plant over the extended period. Relying upon a decision of
a

Division

Bench

of

this

Court

in

DDA v. Bhagat

Construction Co. Pvt. Ltd. 2004 (3) Arbitration Law
Reporter 481, the learned Single Judge held that since the
arbitrator had relied upon the available material including
the Hindrance Register maintained by the

respondent

during the progress of the work and recorded a finding
that the respondent, appellant herein, had committed
several breaches of the contract between the parties, there
was no room for interference with the award. The court
also held that the arbitrator was not required to disclose
the

mathematical

calculation

underlying

the

amount

awarded by him so long as the award made by him

FAO(OS) 116/2006

Page 4 of 8

demonstrated application of mind.

Having said so, the

court set aside the award made by the arbitrator insofar as
the sum of Rs.50,000/- awarded towards infructuous
expenditure was concerned keeping in view the finding
recorded by the arbitrator that the claimant had not
produced any evidence in support of that claim. The award
was with that modification made a rule of the court with
the direction that the claimant would be entitled to interest
@ 9% per annum on the principal amount of the award
from the date of the decree till realisation excluding
interest @ 12% per annum awarded by the arbitrator for
the pre-decreetal amount. The present appeal assails the
correctness of the said award.
4.

We have heard learned counsel for the parties at

considerable length and perused the record.

As rightly

pointed out by the learned Single Judge, a court dealing
with objections under Section 30/33 of the Arbitration Act,
1940 does not sit in appeal over the award made by the
arbitrator. So long as the arbitrator has applied his mind,
noticed the contentions urged on both the sides and looked

FAO(OS) 116/2006

Page 5 of 8

into the material assembled by them in support of their
respective versions, the court would respect the view taken
by the arbitrator unless there is some patent illegality,
perversity or irrationality in the same.

The court may also

interfere in cases where the award made by the arbitrator
goes beyond the terms of the reference made to him.
There is no such illegality, perversity or lack of jurisdiction
in the present case. The arbitrator has applied his mind to
the contentions of both the parties and

appreciated the

material available on record in relation to the said versions
and recorded a clear finding of fact that there was delay in
the completion

of

the work on account of reasons

attributable to the appellant.

The arbitrator has also held

that if the price index was to be made the basis for the
award of compensation for the extended period of contract,
the amount due to the claimant would work out to
Rs.31,95,700/-.

Keeping in view, however, the fact that a

part of the delay that had occurred in the completion of the
contract

was

also

attributable

to

the

claimant,

the

arbitrator has reduced the said amount and awarded only a

FAO(OS) 116/2006

Page 6 of 8

sum of Rs.10 lacs in favour of the claimant. It is true that
the arbitrator has not disclosed the basis on which the said
amount has been determined by him but having regard to
the settled legal position that it is not necessary for the
arbitrator to disclose the working of his mind while
determining the amount actually

awarded by him, the

absence of any such calculation in the award would not
render the same illegal.

The arbitrator, it is common

ground, was an expert engineer member of the DDA.

His

experience in matters relevant to the controversy between
the parties would therefore have a bearing on the
determination of the issues arising before him.

Inasmuch

as the arbitrator awarded a lumpsum amount under claim
No.8, he did not commit any illegality or perversity of the
kind that could justify interference from this Court.

There

is no merit in this appeal which fails and is hereby
dismissed but without any orders as to costs.
