IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.1

leave to incorporate a prayer for mesne profits with effect from the date of
filing of the suit.
2.

The plaintiffs filed the present suit on the 18th February, 2002. The

suit was permitted to be amended on an earlier occasion. The plaintiffs
consequently have made the following prayers in the plaint as it stands:“1. The suit of the plaintiffs be decreed and a decree of
possession be passed in favour of the plaintiffs against the
defendants in respect of the property in suit viz property
bearing K-2068, Chittranjan Park, New Delhi measuring
160 sq. yards. as shown in red in the plan of the Property
in suit attached with the plaint.

4.

Pass a declaratory decree declaring the alleged agreement
to sell date 4.9.2000 executed by Sh. R.N. Ghosh
defendant No.1 in favour of Shri Bharat Vidhu Pandey,
defendant no.2 as sham bogus and fictitious and not
binding on the plaintiffs and the same deserves to be set
aside.
Pass a declaratory decree that the judgment and decree
passed by Sh. Kanwaljeet Arora, Civil Judge, Delhi on
12.1.2000 in suit No.706 of 2000 titled as Vikesh Majithia
Versu R.N. Ghose & others is collusive, sham and
obtained by playing a fraud on the court and is a nullity in
the eyes of law. it is not bidning on the plaintiffs and be
set aside.
Pass a declaratory decree that judgmnet and decree passed
by Ms. Savita Rao, Civil Judge, Delhi on 30.7.2001 in
Suit No.415/2000 titled as Jitender Sharma Versus R.N.
Ghosh and others be set aside as the same is obtained by
misrepresentation and fraud played on the court and the
same be declared as nullity and not binding on the

IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.2

plaintiffs and be set aside.

3.

4-A. That decree of damages amounting to Rs.5,00,000/(Rupees five lacs) be passed in favour of the plaintiffs and
against the defendants jointly and severally.”
The suit of the plaintiffs is based on the plea that the defendant no.1

had entered into an agreement to sell in respect of Plot No.K-2068 situated
at Chitranjan Park, New Delhi in favour of Shri Jai Narayan Aggarwal, the
predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiffs. The said Shri Aggarwal was even
put in possession of the property.

However, the defendant no.1 was

interfering with the rights and possession of the said Shri Aggarwal in the
property.

He even attempted to take illegal possession for which a

complaint was lodged resulting in a decision dated 17th February, 1979 in
case No.79A/8/77 by the S.D.M. The defendant no.1 even filed a suit for
recovery of possession against the said Shri Aggarwal which Suit
No.388/1979 was dismissed on the 20th September, 1988.

The appeal

against this decision was dismissed by the Additional District Judge in
default of appearance on 14th July, 1997 resulting in the judgment and
decree dated 20th September, 1988 attaining finality.
4.

According to the plaintiffs, after the death of Shri Jai Narayan

Aggarwal on 3rd February, 1988, the plaintiffs had contended that the

IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.3

defendant no.1 illegally and surreptitiously removed the original agreement
to sell in favour of Shri Aggarwal from the record of the trial court and
thereafter tried to create third party rights and interests in favour of
defendant no.2 in the suit property. Collusive litigation was also undertaken
wherein defendant no.3 was set up as a tenant and it was sought to be
established that the possession of the property be transferred to defendant
no.2 through its attorney defendant no.4.

In these circumstances,

the

present suit has been filed by the plaintiffs seeking a declaration that the
judgment and decree collusively secured by the defendants are illegal,
fradulent and collusive. The plaintiffs have contended that they were also
illegally dispossessed on the 29th October, 2001.
5.

The plaintiffs in the application contend that after the filing of the

present suit for possession and damage, they were advised to file a suit
which was registered ultimately as Suit No.453/2003 on the 18th February,
2002 praying for recovery of Rs.3,47,500/- against the present defendants.
This amount was claimed on the ground that the plaintiffs are entitled to
mesne profits/damages at the rate of Rs. 5,000/- per month from 13th
January, 2001 to 28th October, 2001 and at the rate of Rs.25,000/- per
month w.e.f. 29th October, 2001. The plaintiffs prayed for further damages
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.4

at the rate of Rs.25,000/- p.m. w.e.f. 29th October, 2002.
6.

In these proceedings, the defendants took an objection that the

subsequent suit of the plaintiffs seeking mesne profits were barred under
Order 2 Rule 2 of the Code Procedure Code. The learned Trial Court was of
the view that the cause of action in the two suits filed by the plaintiffs finds
its roots in the alleged dispossession of the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs
could have sought the relief that has been sought in the subsequent suit in
the present suit. Therefore, the court was of the view that the subsequent
suit was barred under the provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 CPC and as such
dismissed the same by a judgment passed on 5th October, 2004.
7.

The plaintiffs have contended that it was on account of the dismissal

of the suit by the judgment dated 5th October, 2004 that the present
application has been necessitated in the present suit whereby the plaintiffs
are seeking only to incorporate a plea and prayer that the defendants were
also liable to pay damages/mesne profits at the rate of Rs.25,000/- per
month from the date of filing of the present suit till the suit is decreed and
possession handed over as para 30B and a prayer clause seeking the same
relief as prayer 4B.
8.

Mr. Keshav Dayal, learned senior counsel appearing for the plaintiffs

IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.5

has placed reliance on the pronouncement of the Apex Court reported in
AIR 1978 SC 484 M/s. Ganesh Trading Co. Vs. Moji Ram; 1960 SC 622
Nanduri

Yogananda

Lakshminarasimhachari

&

Others

Vs. Sri

Agastheswaraswamivaru and AIR 1992 SC 1604 : (1992) 1 SCC 647
Jagdish Singh Vs. Natthu Singh, to contend that the amendment does not
make out any new case and deserves to be granted.
9.

Appearing for the defendant no.1, Mr. B.L. Wali, learned counsel

vehemently opposed the grant of the application on the ground that the
plaintiffs have failed to act with due diligence and that they were aware of
the relief to which he was entitled when he filed the present suit. It is
contended that the application for amendment is not bona fide and is a mala
fide application.

It is also submitted that the Trial Court has made

observations to this effect in its judgment dated 5th October, 2004.
10.

Ms. Shalini Kapoor, learned counsel appearing for the defendant no.2

has additionally asserted that apart from the above objections on which the
defendant no.2 joined hands with defendant no.1, the relief sought by the
plaintiffs in the application is barred by limitation and cannot be permitted
to be incorporated in the plaint by way of amendment. In support of this
submission, learned counsel places reliance on the pronouncement of the
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.6

Supreme Court in AIR 1996 SC 642 Muni Lal Vs. The Oriental Fire &
General Insurance Company Ltd. & Another.
11.

So far as the defendant no.5 is concerned, Mr. Vinod Tyagi, learned

counsel representing it, has submitted that the relief sought cannot be
granted in any case against the defendant no.5 and the application qua it is
liable to be dismissed.
12.

Having heard learned counsel for the parties, it is necessary to

observe that the principles governing consideration of an application
seeking amendment of pleadings are so well settled that they need no
elaboration. Unless the proposed amendment takes away valuable rights of
the other side, it has been repeatedly held that amendment should normally
be permitted. The Apex Court has permitted amendment of the pleadings
even at the stage of appeals before it. In this behalf, reference can be held
This court in 1974 RLR 491 Kartar Singh Vs. Sir Sobha Singh & Sons.
permitted even amendments of the pleadings to incorporate a cause of
action which had become time barred for special reasons. The merits of the
proposed amendment cannot be considered while consideration of the
application seeking to amend the pleadings to incorporate the pleas.
However, an amendment seeking to incorporate pleas which are barred by
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.7

law or which takes away vested rights of the other side is not permissible.
Admissions made in pleadings can also not be taken away by amendment of
the pleadings seeking deletions. However, law permits amendment of the
pleadings to explain a statement of fact or the circumstances in which an
admission was made in the pleadings which already stands filed before the
court.
13.

In AIR 1983 SC 462 entitled Panchdeo Narain Srivastava Vs. Jyoti

Sahay, the Apex Court has held that even amendment of a plaint by the
plaintiffs seeking admission of facts or explaining it away is permissible.
This would undoubtedly depend on the facts and circumstances of the case.
14.

In the instant case, the plaintiffs are not seeking to incorporate any

new facts, it is seeking to incoporate a plea for the claim of mesne profits
based on its condition that the defendnats are in unauthorised and illegal
possession of his property which facts have already led before the court.
Therefore, on the factual matrix which is before the court, an additional
prayer has been sought in the prayer closed. In this behalf, the Apex Court
in AIR 1960 SC 622 Nanduri Yogananda Lakshminarasimhachari &
Others Vs. Sri Agastheswaraswamivaru has held thus:“In this appeal counsel for the appellant has raised three
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.8

15.

points: (1) that the suit was not maintainable; (2) that the
amendment should not have been allowed and (3) the
grant was a personal grant to the appellants burdened with
the provision for service and it was not a specific
endowment. As far as the first question is concerned it
has not been shown as to how the suit was not
maintainable. The question of amendment, in our opinion,
was rightly decided by the High Court. As held by that
court all the necessary allegations had been made in the
plaint and the requisite pleas had been raised by the
appellants; an issue was framed on the question and the
parties were fully cognizant of the points in controversy
and the necessary evidence was led by the parties. In this
view of the matter, the High Court was right in allowing
the amendment by the addition of a prayer in the prayer
clause.”
Procedural law is intended to facilitate and not to obstruct the course

of substantive justice. Provisions relating to pleadings in civil cases are
meant to give to each side intimation of the case of the other so that it may
be met, to enable courts to determine what is really at issue between parties,
and to prevent deviations from the course which litigation on particular
causes of action must take. In AIR 1978 SC 484 M/s Ganesh Trading Co.
Vs. Moji Ram in this behalf the court held thus:“4. It is clear from the foregoing summary of the main
rules of pleadings that provisions for the amendment of
pleadings, subject to such terms as to costs and giving of
all parties concerned necessary opportunities to meet
exact situations resulting from amendments, are intended
for promoting the ends of justice and not for defeating
them. Even if a party or its counsel is inefficient in
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.9

setting out its case initially the shortcomings can certainly
be removed generally by appropriate steps taken by a
party
which must
no doubt pay costs for the
inconvenience or expense caused to the other side from
its omissions. The error is not incapable of being
rectified so long as remedial steps do not unjustifiably
injure rights accrued.
5.
It is true that, if a plaintiff seeks to alter the cause
of action itself and to introduce indirectly, through an
amendment of his pleadings, and entirely new or
inconsistent cause of action, amounting virtually to the
substitution of a new plaint or a new cause of action in
place of what was originally there, the Court will refuse
to permit it if it amounts to depriving the party against
which a suit is pending of any right which may have
accrued in its favour due to lapse of time. But, mere
failure to set out even an essential fact does not, by itself,
constitute a new cause of action. A cause of action is
constituted by the whole bundle of essential facts which
the plaintiff must prove before he can succeed in his suit.
It must be antecedent to the institution of the suit. It any
essential fact is lacking from averments in the plaint the
cause of action will be defective. In that case, an attempt
to supply the omission has been and could sometime be
viewed as equivalent to an introduction of a new cause of
action which, cured of its shortcomings, has really
become a good cause of action. This however, is not the
only possible interpretation to be put on every defective
state of pleadings. Defective pleadings are generally
curable it the cause of action sought to be brought out
was not ab initio completely absent. Even very defective
pleadings may be permitted to be cured, so as to
constitute a cause of action where there was none,
provided necessary conditions, such as payment of either
any additional court fees, which may be payable, or, of
costs of the other side are complied with. It is only it
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.10

16.

lapse of time has barred the remedy on a newly
constituted cause of action that the Courts should,
ordinarily, refuse prayers for amendment of pleadings.”
In AIR 1992 SC 1604 entitled Jagdish Singh Vs. Natthu Singh, the

Apex Court permitted amendment of the plaint and the relief of
compensation in lieu of or in addition to specific performance where the
plaintiff had not abandoned his relief of specific performance, at any stage
of proceedings.
17.

This judgment does not really apply to the facts of this case in as

much as the court placed reliance on the provisions of Section 21 of the
Specific Relief Act which expressly empowers the court to grant
amendment of the pleadings at any stage of the proceedings and permitted
amendment of the plaint seeking alternative relief. The ratio therein is
clearly distinguishable and does not apply to the facts of the case.
18.

However, the principles governing adjudication in an application

praying for amendment of the pleadings were laid down in AIR 1975 SC
1409 entitled Pasupuleti Venkateswarlu Vs. The Motor & General
Traders. The Apex Court was dealing with the basis of the cause of action
and the character of the right and held that it was basic to the processual
jurisprudence that the right to relief must be judged to exist as on the date a

IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.11

suitor institutes the legal proceedings. It was held that the principle in that
procedure is the hand maid and not the mistress of the judicial process. If a
fact arose after the lis has come to court and has a fundamental impact on
the right to relief or the manner of moulding it, is brought diligently to the
notice of the tribunal, it cannot blink at it or be blind to the events which
stultify or renders inept the decretal remedy. The Apex Court held that
equity justifies binding the rules of procedure, where no specific provision
of fairplay is violated with a view to promote substantial justice, subject, of
course, to the absence of other disentitling factors or just circumstances. It
was further held that in order to render substantial justice without causing
injustice to the other party or violating fair play, the court would be entitled
to grant proper relief even at the stage of appellate forum.
The principles laid were reiterated in AIR 1979 SC 551 entitled
Ishwardar Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh & Others.
19.

Ms. Shalini Kapoor, learned counsel for the defendant has placed

reliance of the pronouncement of the Apex Court in AIR 1996 SC 642
entitled Muni Lal Vs. The Oriental Fire & General Insurance Company
Ltd. & Another to urge that in the present case, the relief of mesne profit
was available to the plaintiffs even when he filed the suit but was still not
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.12

made. It is urged that such relief became barred by limitation and therefore
could not be incorporated by amendment. In Muni Lal (Supra), the Apex
Court noticed that the relief proposed to be incorporated by amendment
became barred by limitation during the pendency of the proceedings in the
appellate court and as such, the court was of the view that the plaintiff could
not be permitted to amend the plaint by way of the application which was
filed in the Appellate Court.
20.

It is well settled that the principles laid down by the Apex Court have

to be applied in the facts and circumstances of the individual case. There is
no contest that the present suit was filed seeking relief for possession and
damages.

Mesne profits would accrue for every date of continued

unauthorized occupation of the premises. Therefore, so far as limitation is
concerned, fresh cause of action would arise with every date on which the
unauthorized occupation continued. In AIR 1966 Andhra Pradesh 325
entitled Abburi Rangamma Vs. Chitrapu Venupurnachandra Rao &
Ors, it was held by the court that cause of action for recovery of immovable
property is distinct from that of mesne profit. Therefore, Order 2 Rule 2
CPC would have no applicability to the suit seeking recovery of the mesne
profits which has been filed subsequent to the filing of the suit seeking
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.13

recovery of the immovable property.
21.

Reference can usefully and appropriately be made to the

pronouncement of the Apex Court in 1980 (1) RCJ 167 Kewal Singh Vs.
Smt. Lajwanti. It was held by the Supreme Court that Order 2 Rule 2 of the
CPC applies to cases where the plaintiff omits to sue a portion of the cause
of action on which the suit is based either by relinquishing the cause of
action or by omitting a part of it.

The provision has, therefore, no

application to cases where the plaintiff bases his suit on separate and
distinct causes of action and chooses to relinquish one or the other of them.
In such cases, it is always open to the plaintiff to file a fresh suit on the
basis of a distinct cause of action which he may have relinquished.
22.

In AIR 1982 Delhi 487 entitled Citibank N.A. Vs. Juggilal Kamlapat

Jute Mills Co. Ltd., the court had occasion to consider an objection taken
by the defendant that the subsequent suit of the bank was barred under the
provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In this case,
the bank first filed a suit against the principal debtor on the basis of the
equitable mortgage executed by him in which the surety was not impleaded
as a party. A subsequent suit was filed by the bank based on the guarantee
deed executed by the surety/guarantor in which both principal debtor and
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.14

guarantor were impleaded. It was contended by the defendant that the
second suit was barred by virtue of the provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 of the
CPC. It was held by this court that the fact that the consideration for the
equitable mortgage and the guarantee deed was the same is of no
consequence. The cause of action for filing the two suits was different and
hence the bar under Order 2 Rule 2 of the CPC was not attracted so far as
the maintainability of the subsequent suit was concerned.

To same fact is

the order passed by this court which was dated 31st May, 1990 by M.L.
Verma, J in

Suit No.945/1990 Union Bank of India Vs. M/s Logic

Systems.
23.

In facts similar to the present case, this court held that the application

for amendment deserved to be granted.

In 29 (1986) DLT (SN) 10

Surender Kumar Gupta & Others Vs. H.L. Sehgal, the respondent entered
into a contract with the petitioner to supply 100 monkey cages and also
supplied machines for the manufacture of the cages. Dispute arose which
was settled that cages would be supplied at the rate of Rs.295/- each and 11
cages were also supplied. The work was not completed nor the machines
returned. The respondent claimed Rs.13,000/-as damages. By a separate
suit, he claimed return of the machinery and damages. This second suit was
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.15

dismissed as barred by Order 2 Rule 2 CPC. Thereafter, the respondent
sought amendment in the original suit to claim a decree for the return of
machines and damages. It was held that all the facts constituting the cause
of action for the additional claim, sought to be introduced by way of
amendment, already existed in the plaint as originally filed.

However

negligent or careless fist the omission may have been, and however, late the
proposed amendment, it is allowed provided no injustice is done to the other
side.

However, amendment will be refused, if it takes away the right

accrued by the lapse of time or if a new cause of action which has become
barred is sought to be set up. The court held that the amendment of the
plaint seeking to incorporate the additional prayer deserved to be permitted.
In this pronouncement, it was observed that in peculiar and special
circumstances, an amendment is allowed even where it has the effect of
defeating the right of the defendant to plead limitation.
24.

In the light of the principles laid down in the afore-stated binding

judicial precedents, it is evident that the plaintiffs were not precluded from
seeking the relief of mesne profits in a subsequent suit. In the instant case,
the plaintiffs filed a suit being Suit No.453/2003 seeking the relief of mesne
profits at the rate of Rs.5,000/- per month from 13th January, 2001 to 28th
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.16

October, 2001 and at the rate of Rs.25,000/- per month w.e.f. 29 th October,
2001. On an objection taken by the defendant that the suit was barred under
the provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 in as much as the relief of mesne profit was
available when the plaintiffs filed the present suit bearing Suit
No.459/2002, the Trial Court dismissed the subsequent suit of the plaintiffs.
Undoubtedly, the plaintiffs opted not to assail the pronouncement and for
reasons of expediency have after the dismissal of their suit, filed the present
application dated 11th July, 2005, seeking a decree for damages/mesne profit
for the sum of Rs.25,000/- per month from the date of filing the suit, i.e.,
18th February, 2002 till the possession is handed over to the plaintiffs. By
the proposed amendment, it is evident that the plaintiffs have consciously
not prayed for the relief of damages w.e.f. 13th January, 2001 on which date
the plaintiffs have claimed that they were illegally dispossessed. No mesne
profits have been claimed till the 18th February, 2002 when the present suit
was filed.
25.

It is noteworthy that the claim of damages of the plaintiffs w.e.f. 18 th

February, 2002 was not barred by limitation when Suit No.453/2003 was
filed.
It is an admitted position that on 11th July, 2005 when the plaintiffs
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.17

filed IA No.6394/2005, the plaintiffs could have sought the relief of mesne
profits for a period three years prior to this date. No objection on the
ground of limitation could be then taken. The objection of limitation is
available to the defendants, therefore, only in respect of mesne profits for
the period from 18th February, 2002 till 10th July, 2002. So far as the
proposed prayer for mesne profit is concerned, the objection as to the relief
being barred by limitation is not available therefore to the defendants so far
as the relief is sought for the period after 11th July, 2002.
Therefore, in any case, the relief of mesne profits could be claimed
w.e.f. 11th July, 2002.
26.

In the instant case, the plaintiffs have placed reliance and has

submitted that it was compelled to file the present application seeking
amendment of the plaint on account of the judgment dated 6 th October, 2004
passed by the Trial Court in Suit No.453/2003 dismissing the suit of the
plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs were, therefore, required to have filed the

application expeditiously after the dismissal of the suit. The application
under consideration was filed only on or about the 11th July, 2005. I,
therefore, find substance in the objection of the defendant that the plaintiffs
cannot be permitted to incorporate the relief of mesne profits for the period
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.18

which has become barred by limitation.
27.

So far as an objection to an amendment to incorporate a claim which

has become time barred by limitation is concerned, in AIR 1981 Delhi 338
entitled Jawahar Lal Motumal Mamtani Vs. Bhagchand Motumal
Mamtani, this court permitted an amendment of the pleadings from the date
of the application in the given facts and circumstances of the case.
28.

I find that the proposed amendments are based on facts which are

already pleaded by the plaintiffs. There is no amendment sought so far as
the factual narration is concerned. No new case is made out, only an
additional prayer is sought based on same facts which have already been
placed before this court. Upon a consideration of the entire matter, this
court is of the view that no prejudice would result to the other side if the
amendment to the extent noticed hereinabove, is permitted. Law permits an
amendment being permitted from a particular date depending on
circumstances.
29.

Accordingly, it is directed that the plaintiffs would be entitled to

incorporate the proposed amendment as contained in para 20B and prayer
4B restricting the prayer of mesne profits for the period from 11th July,
2002, that is, from three years prior to the date of filing of the present
IA No.6394/2005 in CS (OS) No.459/2002

Page No.19

application.
The application is allowed to the above extent, subject to payment of
Rs.16,000/- as costs to be paid within a period of two weeks from today.
The costs shall be equally apportioned between the counsels for the
defendant nos.1, 2, 5 & National Legal Aid Fund (NALSA).
In view of the prayer of the plaintiffs being granted only partially, the
proposed amended plaint placed on record cannot be taken on record. The
plaintiffs are directed to place the amended plaint on record within a period
of two weeks from today.
