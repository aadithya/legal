ITA No.65/2006

Page 1 of 6

of since common question of law is involved.
2.

Both these appeals arise out of decision dated 20th

May, 2005 passed by Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
(hereinafter referred as Tribunal) for the assessment year
1997-98 in ITA No.1499/Del/2001 and for the assessment
year 1999-2000 in ITA No.1500/Del/2001.
3.

The Revenue has raised following questions of law in

ITA No.37/2006.
(a)Whether ITAT was correct in law in
holding that the income from the project
known as “Malibu Town” is assessable in
the hands of Malibu Estate (joint venture)
as an AOP on substantive basis and not in
the hands of Malibu Estate Pvt. Ltd.?

4.

(b)Whether ITAT was correct in law in
directing to give credit of TDS to the
Assessee though the certificates were
issued in the name of Malibu Estate
Pvt.Ltd. and the income from the project
was assessable in the hands of Malibu
Estate Pvt. Ltd.?“
Vide order dated 2nd August, 2006, this Court held

that insofar as question (a) is concerned, it is not a
substantial question of law and in this regard reliance was
placed on a decision rendered on 2nd August, 2006 by this
Court in ITA No.301/2004.
5.

Regarding question (b), it was listed for hearing.

ITA No.65/2006

The brief facts of both these cases are that five

companies were incorporated on 28th April, 1992 known as
Malibu Group of Companies. These companies wanted to
develop a township in Gurgaon. However, as per Haryana
Urban Area Act the area for which license can be granted
to a developer or builder is 100 acres and under the Land
Ceiling

Act

in

Haryana,

the

individual holding is 28 acres.

maximum

permissible

Therefore, these five

companies entered into an agreement for pooling their
lands for this purpose and to develop the same. For this
purpose Malibu Estate Pvt. Ltd. (MEPL in short) was
authorised to take

all necessary actions for development

for obtaining license from the authorities concerned etc.
Two returns were filed by the group, one in the status of
MEPL and the other in the name of MEJV in the status of
AOP.
7.

A search was conducted at the business premises of

Malibu Group of Companies on 15th September, 1995. In
pursuance to search, block assessment was made in the
case of MEPL on 30th September, 1996.

However, no

proceedings under Section 158BC or 158BD of the Act
ITA No.65/2006

Page 3 of 6

were initiated against the present Assessee, considering
the joint venture to be non-est.

The assessment was

completed by the Assessing Officer in assessment year
1996-97 on protective basis at Rs.1,01,03,080/- after
making additions.

Similarly, in the present year also the

Assessing Officer completed the assessment on protective
basis at Rs.1,63,18,318/-.
8.

Assessee filed an appeal before the Commissioner of

Income Tax (Appeals) against the assessment order and the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeal) relying on his own
order in the case of MEPL held that the income of real
estate development project known as Malibu Town was to
be included in the total income of the Assessee on
substantive basis and not on a protective basis as had been
done by the Assessing Officer.

He further directed the

Assessing Officer to allow credit for Tax deducted at Source
from interest on fixed deposits as per certificates filed.
9.

Against this order, the Revenue filed an appeal before

the Tribunal who relied on its earlier order in the case of
same Assessee for the assessment year 1996-97 and
thereby confirmed the order passed by the Commissioner
ITA No.65/2006

Page 4 of 6

of Income Tax (Appeal).
10.

Aggrieved against the impugned order passed by the

Tribunal, the Revenue has filed the present appeals.
11.

It has been argued by learned counsel for the

Revenue that the Tribunal wrongly allowed credit for the
TDS deducted from interest on fixed deposits in the case of
Assessee despite the fact that the same were issued in the
name of MEPL and income was assessable in the hands of
MEPL.
12.

The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) in its

order dated 31st January, 2001 held:“ vide appellate order of even date passed in
the case of M/s Malibu Estate Pvt. Ltd. for
the assessment year 1997-98 in Appeal
No.79/2000-901 that the real estate project
known as Malibu Towne and the income
thereof belongs to the assessee M/s Malibu
Estate Joint Venture, AOP. Since the fixed
deposits in question pertain to the Malibu
Towne project and thus belong to the
assessee M/s Malibu Estate Joint Venture,
AOP, and the interest on the said fixed
deposits has been credited in its books,
credit for the TDS deducted from the said
interest should be allowed to the assessee”
13.

The Assessee has claimed credit for TDS in the hands

of Malibu Estate Joint Ventures though the relevant TDS

ITA No.65/2006

Page 5 of 6

certificates were issued in the name MEPL.

Since the

income of the project has been held to be assessable in the
hands of the Assessee i.e. Malibu Estate Joint Venture and
it is a settled position that credit for TDS is to be given in
the case of the Assessee and that too in the year in which
the corresponding income is taxed.
14.

It may be pointed out that similar relief was allowed

by Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) in the Assessee's
case for the assessment year 1996-97 and the Revenue did
not prefer any appeal.
15.

Under these circumstances, we have no hesitation in

answering the question (b) in the affirmative, that is, in
favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue.
16.

As such both the appeals filed by Revenue are hereby

dismissed.
