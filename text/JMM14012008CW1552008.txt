1.
The petitioner, who was recruited as a Short Service Medical
Officer in Army Medical Corps (AMC) is seeking extension of her
tenure by another four years on the strength of the decision taken
by the Ministry of Defence and communicated to the Chief of
Army Staff vide letter dated 2nd November, 2007.

As per this

communication, in partial modification of the provisions contained
in Army Instructions 75/78, Army Instructions 15/79 and Army
Instructions 17/96, the total period of service of certain officers is
extended from 10 to 14 years. List includes AMC from Civil as
well. As per the amended provision the person is to be appointed
initially for a period of five years and extension for another period
of five years can be given thereafter on the completion of five
years and second extension of four years can also be granted.
Before we consider this prayer of the petitioner as to whether the
petitioner is entitled to the benefit of the aforesaid amended
provision or not, it would be appropriate to scan through the
service carrier of the petitioner as a 'Short Service Commissioned
Officer'.
2.

The petitioner was initially commissioned as Short Service

Commissioned Officer in AMC on 17th August, 1983. After serving
WP(C) No.155/2008

Page 2 of 8

for ten years and twenty eight days, she was released on 14th
September, 1993.

She was again allowed to join in the same

capacity with effect from 4th September, 1997 vide letter dated
17th January, 2003.

This tenure was extended by another five

years which is coming to an end on 17th January, 2008.

The

petitioner was served with release order dated 21st August, 2007
as per which she would be released on 17th January, 2008. In the
meantime, the aforesaid amendment in the instructions has been
brought into force vide policy instructions dated 2nd November,
2007.
3.

The respondents do not dispute that after the aforesaid

amendment in the policy instructions, the officer who is
commissioned as Short Service Commissioned Officer can now be
given extension after ten years of service, for another four years.
However, in the case of the petitioner it is denied on the ground
that the petitioner has served for more than twenty years,
namely, ten years and twenty eight days from 17th August, 1983
to 14th September, 1993 and she has again completed ten years
of service after joining in the same position second time and
therefore, she cannot be given the benefit. The respondents have
produced the records as per which the case of the petitioner
WP(C) No.155/2008

Page 3 of 8

along with certain other officers was taken up for extension of
tenure of Short Service Commissioned Officers and in terms of
revised instructions dated 2nd November, 2007. This exercise was
done on 13th December, 2007 and as per the minutes recorded
various officers have been given the extension, however, two
officers, namely, the petitioner and one Shri Ashok Kumar Jha
were not given the extension on the ground that it was there
second tenure and they have already put in total service of
twenty years under two spells.
4.

The Army Instructions Nos. 75-81 dated 4th November, 1978

deal with the terms and conditions of service for officers granted
short service grades in the AMC. Para 4 stipulates the length of
such a Commission and further extensions.

The same read as

under:
“LENGTH OF COMMISSION AND FURTHER
EXTENSION
4.
Commissions will be granted for a period
of 5 years in the first instance and will be
extended for such periods as the DGA-FMS may
decide subject to the conditions that the total
SSC service of the officer does not exceed 10
years or beyond the age of 55 years.
On being granted a commission, the
officer will be subject to the Army Act, 1950 (XLVI
of 1950) under Section 2(1)(a) thereof.”

As per the aforesaid provision, the commission is to be

granted for a period of five years in the first instance which can
be extended for such further periods as may be decided by the
competent authority. It is however subject to the condition that
total service cannot exceed ten years or beyond the age of 52
years. As per this provision, therefore, the total service has to be
ten years. The amendment contained in communication dated 2nd
November, 2007 is to be read in that context as the aforesaid

For our benefit we reproduce the relevant

portion of communication dated 2nd November, 2007:“Subject : Extension of tenure of Short Service
Commissioned Officers of the Armed Forces
Medical Services(AFMS) from 10 years to 14
years.
Sir,
In partial modification of the provision
contained in AI 75/78, AI 15/79 and AI 17/96 as
amended, I am directed to convey the sanction of
the President for extension of total tenure of
Short Service Commission(SSC) in respect of
AMC, AD Corps and MNS from 10 years to 14
years in the following manner :-

It is clear from the aforesaid quoted portion that the

sanction of the President for extension of total tenure of Short
Service Commissioned Officer is obtained which is now made as
'total period of service' as fourteen years.

The intention is

manifest, namely, entire period of Short Service Commissioned
Officer which was earlier ten years is now extended to fourteen
years. It is thus clear that those who have already rendered
fourteen years of service and above would not be entitled to the
benefit of this amendment. The case of the petitioner would fall
in this category as she has already rendered more than twenty
years of service as Short Service Commissioned Officer.

Learned counsel for the petitioner had submitted that in

case this was the position as per the Army Instructions, she was
not even entitled to be appointed second time in the year 1997.
He further submitted that though her initial period of appointment
was five years, even in the year 2003 she was given extension for
a further period of five years. From the records produced by the
learned counsel for the respondent, it is borne out that this
practice of appointing the Short Service Commissioned Officers
for more than ten years, namely, given a break and then
appointing again was objected to by the Audit as well as by the
CDA and the notings show that the concerned departments were
advised not to adopt this practice which was in violation of the
aforesaid Army Instructions. Therefore, if the petitioner herein or
any other such officers were given the second tenure as Short
Service Commissioned Officer in violation of the said rules, that
would not mean that such an illegality is to be perpetuated and
the petitioner should now be given extension for other four years.
We do not, therefore, find merit in this petition and the same is
accordingly dismissed.
8.

As this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

since as per the respondent's own showing the petitioner has

rendered more than twenty years of service she would be entitled
to pension. It would be open to the petitioner to raise this issue
with the appropriate authorities.
