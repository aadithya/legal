The present appeal was preferred by the insurance company
i.e. appellant herein challenging the impugned judgment on the
ground that the appellant has the limited liability under Section

FAO 241/2000

Pages 1 of 7

95(2) of the unamended Motor Vehicles Act prior to 1st July, 1989.
The accident in the present case had occurred on 20th
March, 1989 and on the relevant date the old Motor Vehicles Act
i.e. Motor Vehicles Act of 1939 was in force. The appellant is liable
to pay only a sum of Rs. 50,000/- towards the compensation of
respondents No. 1 and 2. Respondent No. 5 is the driver of the
offending vehicle and respondent No. 6 is the owner of the
offending vehicle. Respondents No. 3 and 4 were directed to be
deleted vide order dated 12.11.1999 by the order of the Tribunal
itself and, therefore, they have been wrongly impleaded in the
present

appeal.

Mr.

Pramod

Gupta

counsel

appearing

for

respondents No. 6 admits the said legal position. He, however,
submits that respondent No. 6 have been burdened with the
heavy compensation amount. He, therefore, submits that this
Court may grant some concession on the rate of interest, which is
otherwise quite exorbitant. The Tribunal has awarded 12%
interest on the Award amount from the date of the filing of the
petition till its realization. In part satisfaction of the said award
amount the appellant insurance company had deposited an
amount of Rs. 1,92,546/- on 30th March, 2001 and Rs. 2,82,050/on 24th September, 2005. The said amount of Rs. 1,92,546/- was

released in favour of the claimants/respondent Nos. 1 and 2, while
subsequent amount of Rs. 2,82,050/- is lying deposited in the
fixed deposit with the Tribunal. Besides the above amount the
appellant had also deposited Rs. 25,000/- towards no fault liability
compensation, which was also withdrawn by the claimants.
Perusal of the record of this appeal shows that this appeal was
dismissed in default vide order dated 7th October, 2004 and the
same was restored only vide orders dated 14th November, 2005
i.e. almost after a lapse of about more than a year. In the
meantime, the appellant had to deposit the said amount of Rs.
2,82,050/- pursuant to the execution of the decree by the
claimants.
The compensation case before the Tribunal was filed on
22.4.1989, which resulted into passing of an Award by the
Tribunal on 1st February, 2000 i.e. after a long gap of about 11
years. The present appeal by the insurance company was
preferred in May, 2001 and this has also taken more than 6 years
in finally disposing of the appeal. In the meanwhile the appeal
also remained dismissed for non-prosecution on account of the
lapse of the appellant. Since the total time consumed for finally
disposing of the matter is about more than 17 years, therefore, I
FAO 241/2000

feel that respondent No.6 cannot be burdened with the rate of
interest of 12% as awarded by the Tribunal on the compensation
amount at least from the date of filing of the appeal till date.
In the above circumstances, the rate of interest of 12% on
the principal amount is reduced from 12% to 6%, which shall be
payable by respondent No. 6 from the date of the filing of the
appeal till its final payment. As per the calculation made by
respondent No. 6, respondent No. 6 has a liability to pay a sum of
Rs. 2,59,600/- to the claimants/respondents No. 1 and 2 and a
sum of Rs. 1,32,500/- to the appellant insurance company and
thus, in all, the total liability of respondent No.6 would be Rs.
3,92,100/-. Basis of this calculation is that respondent No. 6 has
calculated 12% interest on Rs. 1,57,000/- after deducting the
liability of the insurance company to the tune of Rs. 50,000/- from
the award amount of Rs. 2,07,240/- and interest has been
calculated from 1989 to 2000 i.e. till the date of the passing of the
Award. Interest @ 6% has been calculated on the last principal
balance amount of Rs. 1,57,000/- firstly with effect from 2000 to
2001 for one year, which comes to Rs. 9420/- and then from 2001
to 2005 on a sum of Rs. 78,500/- because of the 50% awarded
amount received by the respondents. This interest for a period of

about 4 years comes out

to Rs. 18,440/- and in this manner the

total liability of respondent No. 6 comes to Rs.3,92,100/-. These
calculations have been shown to the counsel appearing for the
appellant as well as to the counsel appearing for respondents No.
1 and 2. Although agreeing with the calculation as carried out by
respondent No. 6 the appellant submits that the insurance
company is entitled to the interest amount of Rs. 1,32,500/- w.e.f.

unnecessarily suffer on account of reduction of the interest rate
for no fault of their. Counsel further says that interest @ 6%
should be calculated on the over due amount of Rs. 78,500/- till its
final payment. Counsel for the appellant also states that the
appellant would be entitled to get release of the FDR of Rs.
2,82,050/- with up to date interest accrued thereon.
After having heard learned counsel for the parties, I feel that
the interest of justice will be met if the interest rate from 12%
from the date of the filing of the present appeal is reduced to 6%
on the remaining principal sum and as per the calculation made
by respondent No. 6 the total liability of respondent No. 6 would
come to Rs. 3,92,100/-. Long delay in the disposal of the appeal

Pages 5 of 7

and the main case has taken place and almost 17 years have
been consumed in reaching at this stage for finally disposing of
the matter. Even the appeal remained dismissed for a period of
one year. For this enormous delay, all the parties must share
equal burden and, therefore, the claims raised by the appellant
towards the grant of interest on the said amount of Rs. 1,32,500/is rejected and similarly the plea of the counsel for the
respondents claiming interest of @ 12% from the date of the filing
of the appeal till its realization as well as the claim of 6% interest
from 2005 till its realization is also rejected. I feel that after
balancing the equities amongst these parties the amount of FDR,
which was deposited by the appellant i.e. sum of Rs. 2,82,050/needs to be released in favour of the appellant along with the
entire interest accrued thereon. Besides the said sum a sum of Rs.
1,32,500/- shall be paid by respondent No. 6 to the appellant
insurance company within a period of four weeks and a sum of Rs.
2,59,600/- shall be paid by respondent No. 6 to respondents No. 1
and 2 within a period of four weeks. Let the amount of Rs.
2,59,600/- be paid in equal half share in favour of respondents
Nos. 1 and 2. On the failure of respondent No. 6 to pay the said
amount within a period of four weeks, respondent No. 6 shall be
FAO 241/2000

Pages 6 of 7

liable to pay the said amount with interest @ 18% per annum
from the date expiring after a period of four weeks. Counsel for
respondents No. 1 and 2 have agreed to accept the said amount
so as to put the litigation at rest. Similarly it is hoped that the
insurance company shall also give finality to the present lis.
With these directions, the appeal stands disposed of.
Dasti.
