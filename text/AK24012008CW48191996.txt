This is an application filed by the respondent no.1/workman

under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking
direction to the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs. 52,462/- towards wages
due to the applicant from 26th January, 1996 to July, 1997 which are
computed on monthly rate of wages due to the applicant in the pay
scale of Rs.750-940 and also to pay a sum of Rs.2600/- per month
from August, 1997 onwards per month.

The respondent/applicant contended that he is entitled for last

drawn wages from the date of the award till the decision of the writ
petition on the ground that the award dated 16th January, 1996
directing reinstatement of the workman has been challenged by the
petitioner/employer, the operation of which award was stayed by an
order dated 7th January, 1997.

3.

Reply to the application of the respondent under section 17B of

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 has not been filed on behalf of
petitioner/non-applicant.

In

the

facts

and

circumstances

the

averments made in the application are deemed to be admitted as the
same have not been refuted by the petitioner/non applicant.

4.

The

learned

counsel

for

the

petitioner,

however,

orally

submitted that the applicant/workman is not entitled to any relief
under

section

17B

of

the

Industrial

Disputes

Act

as

the

applicant/workman has since expired.

5.

Perusal of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

reveals that it comes into operation when an Award directing
reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further proceedings by the
employer.

The preliminary consideration for making available such a relief

under Section 17B to a workman is to be found in the benevolent
purpose

of

the

enactment

the

spirit,

intendment

and

object

underlying which is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the
hardship which would be caused to a workman due to delay in the
implementation of an award directing reinstatement of his services on
account of the challenge made to it by the employer. Section 17B
recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body
and soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award
directing his reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment which is required to be
made by the employer to the workman has been held to be akin to a
subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor recoverable
from a workman even if the Award in his favor is set aside by the High
Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T.
Patel the Apex Court was of the view that the object under Section
17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain
extent, the hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay
in implementation of the Award.

Moreover granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and

passing orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the
rule; refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the
relief could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of
jurisdictional error where there is no relationship of employer and
employee between the parties.

8.

Thus if the requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes

Act, 1947 are satisfied then in exercise of powers under Article 226 of
the Constitution, no order can be passed denying the workman the
benefit of statutory provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947. In the present case the workman expired on 16th
December, 2001 and the application along with the affidavit was filed
by him on 27th August, 1997 prior to his death and since then no
reply has been filed by the petitioner till date. Thus at this stage after
a lapse of more than a decade when the applicant has expired the
petitioner/non applicant cannot be allowed to take the plea that the
relief under section 17B of the Act cannot be granted because of the
demise of the applicant. The legal heirs of the applicant/workman
have already been impleaded as parties by order dated 22nd November,
2005. This is also apparent that the workman remain unemployed
after his termination till he expired on 16th December, 2001.

9.

In the facts and circumstances,

the application of the

workman/applicant under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 is allowed and the petitioner is directed to pay the arrears of last
drawn wages or the minimum wages whichever is higher from the
date of award dated 16th January, 1996 till 16th December, 2001 when
the respondent No.1/workman is alleged to have expired, within eight
weeks to the legal heirs of deceased workman who have been
substituted in the petition in his place. An undertaking be also filed
by the legal heirs of the deceased workman that in case the writ
petition is allowed, they will refund/return the difference of last
drawn wages and minimum wages which were payable to the
deceased workman within such time as will be permitted by this
Court.
With these directions, the application is disposed of.

W.P.(C) No.4819/1996
Rule has already been issued in the matter.
List in the category of “Regular Matters” at its turn.
