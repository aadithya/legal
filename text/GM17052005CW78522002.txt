are stated to be local residents of the area who claim to have the
same object. The writ petition has been filed praying for the
following relief :-

2.

“i)
to issue a writ n the nature of
Mandamus
thereby
directing
the
respondents No. 1 and 2 not to disturb and

The petitioners have alleged that land measuring 8

bighas in khasra no. 142 and 6 bighas in khasra nos. 140 and 141
situated at village Inderprastha in the revenue and wakf record is
wakf property. According to the petitioners, the members of the
petitioner no. 1 and the petitioners are peacefully residing in the
area measuring about 2 bighas of khasra no. 142 of the village
Inderprastha.

The material averments with regard to the

ownership of the land and the occupation of the same as stated in
the writ petition are as hereunder :-

W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 2 of 16

“5.
That the land in question is the
Wakf property. The area in question is eight
bighas in Khasra No. 142 and 6 Bigha in
Khasra No. 140 and 141 situated at Village
Indesrprasth in the revenue and Wakf
record. The photo copies of the revenue
record and Wakf Gazettes with its
translation with site plan are being filed
herewith and marked as Annexure
'B'(Colly)
6.
xxxxxx
7.
That it is pertinent to mention
here that Mata Sundari Gurdwara is existing
at the East side of the property in question.
The Gurdwara Management has illegally
encroached upon a big chunk of Wakf
property. It is further necessary to say that
the members of the petitioner No. 1 and the
petitioners are residing peacefully in the
areas measuring about 2 Bigha of Khasra
No. 142 Village Inder Prastha, without any
disturbance or interference.
8.
It is further submitted that the
respondent No. 1 several years back illegally
constructed the Flats over about 6 Bighas
land of Khasra No. 140 and 141 village Inder
Prastha, most of those now have been
demolished, only few flats in dilapidated
condition are existing. The respondent No. 1
has also removed major part of its malba
through its contractors from the site and
more than half of this Wakf land is vacant.
9.
It is pertinent to mention here that
the respondent No.1 without having any
ownership documents is going to sell out and
part with the possession to some private
persons, area measuring about 6 Bigha in
Khasra No. 140 and 141 and also bent upon
to interfere and disturb into the peaceful
enjoyment of the petitioners, without
following due process of law. The officers of
W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 3 of 16

3.

respondent No. 1 and 2 are coming
frequently to the site in question and trying
to encroach upon the Wakf property, thereby
attempting to violate the order of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India vide
Anneure-A.”
The petitioners submit that there is an order on

directing the respondents to maintain status quo and rule has been
issued in Civil Writ petition No. 4496/1996 on 24th September,
2002. It is further submitted that the respondents are attempting
to sell out and part with possession of wakf property having no
documents of ownership. Reliance has been placed on an order
passed by the Supreme Court of India on the 10th April, 1990.
4.

The respondent no. 1 has appeared in answer to the

notice to show cause and has filed a detailed counter affidavit
stating that vide notification no. 775 dated 21st December, 1911,
Union of India had acquired large tracts of lands leaving out 13
bighas for the public purpose of development of the new capital
of India at Delhi.

According to this notification, the land

measuring 886 acres forming part of the village Indrapat was
included in this large scale acquisition of land.

Copy of this

notification as well has the plan which indicated the boundaries of
the proposed new capital of India at Delhi bounded by the
Imperial pillars indicated in brown colour as well as showing the
W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 4 of 16

13 unacquired sites left out of acquisition which are indicated in
blue colour have been placed on record.
5.

According to the respondent no. 1, vide a notification no.

166/1969 dated 10th December, 1969, the Secretary of the Delhi
Wakf Board suo moto declared certain properties as belonging to
the Delhi Wakf Board. It is contended that vide a letter dated 9th
February, 1971, addressed to the Secretary, Delhi Wakf Board, the
Land and Development Officer gave notice that the notification be
cancelled failing which the Government of India would initiate
legal proceedings for declaring the same as null and void and that
these properties belonged to the Union of India.
Since no response was received from the Delhi Wakf
Board, the Government of India filed various suits against the
Board with regard to these properties which were the subject
matter of the suo moto notification.
However, a representation was made by the Delhi Wakf
Board to the Government.
On this representation, the suits were not proceeded
with any further and the Government constituted the Burney
Committee to go into this issue.
Ultimately, the Government of India had decided that 61
W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 5 of 16

properties which actually belonged to the Land and Development
Office and 62 properties which were under the jurisdiction of the
Delhi Development Authority would stand allotted to the Delhi
Wakf Board.
6.

According to the respondent no. 1, the property which

has been made the subject matter of the present writ petition did
not even form part of the 123 properties which were decided to be
allotted to the Delhi Wakf Board.
Based on the foregoing pleas, the respondent no. 1 has
contended that the petitioners have no right, title or interest in the
land which is the subject matter of the writ petition.
7.

Respondent no. 1 has further submitted that this

decision of the Government of India to allot these 123 properties to
the Delhi Wakf Board was challenged in this court in Civil Writ
Petition No. 1512/1984 entitled Vishwa Hindu Parishad vs Union
of India wherein the court had directed that status quo regarding
the properties will be maintained and possession should be
retained by the Government.

There was a further order of

restraint to the effect that if lease deeds have not been executed,
the same should not be executed. It has been submitted that this
order is in operation and the writ petition is still pending in court.
W.P.(C) 7852/2002

8.

The respondent no. 1 has claimed ownership over the

land on account of acquisition having been commenced under
notification no. 775 dated 21st December, 1911 and the same having
been completed in accordance with law. The Government of India
is stated to have been constructed a government colony of double
storey quarters on 313 acres on this land in the year 1984-1955 at
the then cost of Rs.5,62,711/- which were known as the Mata
Sundari Road and Minto Road quarters.
9.

The respondent no. 1 has also questioned the locus

standi of the petitioner to file and maintain the writ petition. It
has been contended that the petitioners are encroachers on
government land who are interfering in the execution of the public
work undertaken by the government.
10.

It is further submitted that the property which has been

made the subject matter of the present writ petition is actually plot
no.9 situated at Kotla Road which had been allotted as back as on
20th June, 2002 to the Government of Uttaranchal for the
construction of the office of the Resident Commissioner and allied
facilities. It is submitted that this was the site of the Mata Sundari
Road and Minto Road quarters which were double storey quarters
and were in the process of being demolished/re-developed.
W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 7 of 16

It has further been stated that the plot allotted to the
Government of Uttaranchal does not fall under khasra no. 140, 141
and 142 Village but falls under khasra no. 139 as disclosed by the
survey.
Copy of a demarcation report by a Tehsildar with
Patwari Kanungo from DDA(Revenue Department) has been
placed on record with the plan of area.
11.

The Delhi Wakf Board has also filed a counter affidavit

in the writ petition and has alleged that a graveyard existed since
time immemorial on the khasra no. 142 measuring about 8 bighas
situated at Mata Sundari Lane and was so notified in the
notification dated 25th September, 1975 at serial no. 78 on page 37
of the notification issued by the Delhi Wakf Board.

It is further

submitted that an application for demarcation of this property as
Wakf property has been moved before the appropriate authority.
12.

I have heard the parties at length and have been taken

through the available record. The entire case of the petitioner
rests on the plea that in the notification issued on the 25th
September, 1975, a graveyard has been shown in 8 bighas of
khasra no. 142 of the Mata Sundari Land.
13.

From perusal of the writ petition in the paragraphs

W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 8 of 16

detailed hereinabove and also the oral submissions made before
me, the petitioners have contended that they are residing on the
land which is the subject matter of the writ petition. There is no
existence of any graveyard whatsoever pleaded in the writ petition
or in the oral submissions made before me except in the
notification of 25th September, 1975.
14.

On the contrary it is an admitted position in the writ

petition that the Government of India had made several quarters
on the land which is the subject matter of the writ petition.
This averment of the writ petitioners is supported by the
deposition on behalf of respondent no. 1 and the record placed
before me to show that several quarters were constructed as back
as in the year 1945-1955.

Therefore, so far as this court is

concerned, the land which is the subject matter of consideration in
the writ petition relates to the land whereupon quarters were
constructed and not to a graveyard.
15.

It is to be noticed that the Government of India had

commenced acquisitions under the provisions of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 pursuant to a notification no. 775 dated 21st
November, 1911. It is not disputed that acquisition of the land
which was the subject matter of this notification was lawfully
W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 9 of 16

completed.

Perusal of the notification no. 775 dated 21st

December, 1911 shows that land admeasuring 886 acres in village
Indrapat was acquired pursuant to this notification. Perusal of the
site plan which is stated to set out the boundaries of the land
shows that 13 pieces of land were not acquired by virtue of this
notification. So far as the Mata Sundari Area is concerned, only
the site of a gurudwara has been shown as unacquired. The only
graveyard shown in this unacquired site on this plan is the
graveyard which existed in Lady Harding area. Therefore,
acquisition having been effected under the provisions of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1911 and acquisition is stated to have been
completed pursuant to such notification.
16.

So far as the notification issued by the Delhi Wakf Board

dated 25th April, 1975 is concerned, the issuance thereof is not
disputed by the respondent no.1. However the legality and validity
thereof is disputed by the respondent no. 1. The respondent no. 1
has also submitted that pursuant to the recommendations of the
Burney Committee, 123 pieces of land were decided to be handed
over to the Delhi Wakf Board of land some of which were owned
by the Land and Development Office and offered by the Delhi
Development Authority. It is noteworthy that the respondent no.
W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 10 of 16

3 has not disclosed the proceedings of the Burney Committee of
the Government before this court. The land appears to have been
acquired pursuant to the notification 1911. The issue as to whether
a subsequent notification under the another enactment could have
been legally issued by the respondent no. 3 does not require to be
answered in these proceedings as it has been stated that the same
is the subject matter of other proceedings and also for the findings
on the other aspects of the present matter.
17.

The petitioner has placed reliance on the order dated

10th April, 1990 to contend that tombs and graveyards cannot be
acquired at all. It is to be noticed that the matter before the Apex
Court had arisen on account of issuance of the notification under
Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1984. It was noticed in the
order dated 10th April, 1990 that the notification itself had
specifically excluded tombs and graveyards from acquisition.
In the instant case, no such terms in any notification
have been pointed out.
18.

In any case, I have noticed hereinabove the averments in

the writ petition and the oral submissions to the effect that
Government quarters stood constructed on the land. No tombs or
graveyards have been pointed out on the land.
W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 11 of 16

No record has been produced with regard to the actual
existence of a graveyard on land which is the subject matter of the
writ petition.
19.

So far as the application of the respondent no. 3 is

concerned for demarcation of the properties, the same would be
dealt with by the concerned authorities as per law.
20.

The petitioners have also placed reliance on an order

dated 24th September, 2002 passed in Writ Petition Civil No.
4493/1996. Perusal of the same shows that it is only an interim
order which was also passed because the respondent no. 3 in that
writ petition did not place the requisite information which was
sought by the court on record and in the absence of any reply of
the respondent no. 3, the court had no other option in the matter.
Status quo with regard to possession, nature and title of the
property which was the subject matter of consideration was
directed. There is no information available on the record of this
case with regard to the issues which were urged on behalf of the
petitioner in writ petition(C) no. 4493/1993 which were the
subject matter of consideration and adjudication by the court. No
judicial pronouncement of any issues after consideration of the
matter on merits has been placed on record.
W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 12 of 16

21.

So far as the stand of Delhi Wakf Board is concerned,

apart from contending that it had issued a notification dated 25th
September, 1975 no other material with regard to the location or
identity of the properties is forthcoming. Furthermore, material
facts which ought to have been placed before the court have not
been placed on record in support of the contentions. There is no
rebuttal to the plea of the respondent no. 1 to the effect that the
land had been acquired pursuant to a proceedings under the
provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1994.
22.

Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners has

vehemently contended that Sh. Jagmohan, the then Deputy
Housing Commissioner of the Delhi Administration had addressed
a letter dated 25th May, 1963 setting out the then Government
policy with regard to areas under graveyards. Perusal of the letter
shows that this letter was written with regard to some area under a
graveyard which was stated to have existed in Village Sheikh Sarai
which had been merged in the Malviya Nagar colony. The letter
drew a clear distinction between land which was actually under
graveyard and such land which was put to other uses.
23.

The letter was written in the context of a specific

property. In any case it cannot effect actions taken in 1911 and
W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 13 of 16

also does not relate to the area in question. The petitioners cannot
place any reliance on this communication which has been quoted
and cited out of context. The correspondence of which this letter is
but a part has not been placed before me.
24.

The respondent no. 1 has placed on record the plan

indicting the location of the land and the report of the kanungo of
the DDA. It has been pointed out that institutional plot nos. 1 to 6
on the Kotla Road are located on the 8 bighas of land forming part
of khasra no. 142. It has further been pointed out that institutional
plot no. 7 on the Kotla Road is located on one biswas of land in the
khasra no. 141 and that 7 biswas out of khasra no. 140 fall in the
right of way that is the Kotla Road.
25.

The respondents have submitted that the land on which

the staff quarters earlier stood and on 20th June, 2002 stands
allotted to the State of Uttaranchal is actually plot no. 9 of the
institutional plots and falls in khasra no. 139 of the Village
Indrapat, New Delhi and not in Khasra nos. 140, 141 and 142.
The writ petition is therefore wholly misconceived.
26.

The survey conducted by the respondent no. 1 was never

objected to nor has any rejoinder been filed to the material factual
averments made on behalf of the respondent no.1.
W.P.(C) 7852/2002

page 14 of 16

The respondent no. 1 has also taken strong objection to
the locus standi of the petitioner to bring and maintain the present
petition.
On the other hand, according to the petitioners, any
person or mutawalli has a right to bring and file the writ petition
under Section 3 of the Delhi Wakf Board Act.
27.

It is to be noticed that the petitioner has not claimed any

right of ownership over any of the land which is the subject matter
of the writ petition but has filed the writ petition on the plea of
mere occupancy.
28.

It is settled law that a jurisdiction of a court of law can

be invoked by person only having a legal and vested right, title and
interest in the subject matter of the land.

Admittedly the

petitioners have no legal or vested right, title or interest in the
land.
In my view, therefore, the petitioners also have no locus
standi to bring and maintain this writ petition.
29.

For all the foregoing reasons, I find no merit in the writ

petition which is hereby dismissed.
There shall be no order as to costs.
