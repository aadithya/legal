Though the matter pertains to the promotion of the
petitioner to the post of Inspector (Executive) in Delhi Police w.e.f. 1992
and 1994 respectively, the Department thereof is dependent upon the
show cause notice issued to the petitioner on earlier occasion as a result

W.P.(C) Nos.7786/05 & 12431/05

Page 1

of which he was inflicted with the punishment of Censure. It is the nature
of those proceedings and the background under which the said penalty of
censure was awarded which is material and, therefore, we shall have to
consider that aspect of the matter at the first instance. The petitioner was
served with show cause notice proposing therein the award of
punishment of Censure. We may mention at the outset that show cause
notice was for minor penalty proceedings and, therefore, no regular
departmental enquiry was conducted.

In the show cause notice the

allegation leveled against the petitioner was that during surprise checking
organized by DCP (Traffic) on 28.3.90 at 4.30PM in the Punjabi Bagh Traffic
Circle, it was found that radar checking was being conducted by
T.I./Punjabi Bagh Circle along with 4 Z.O’s. at Pitampura on Outer Ring
Road. The petitioner challaned one Truck Driver in which he seized his
Driving Licence. Later he accepted Rs.200/- from him as compounding fee
and returned the Driving Licence. The petitioner had also given him
receipt of the said amount of Rs.200/-. However, the amount was not
endorsed/entered on the copy of the Challan Book which is retained in the
Department.

W.P.(C) Nos.7786/05 & 12431/05

Page 2

The reply of the petitioner to the said show cause notice was
that after the petitioner had challaned the said truck driver and seized his
driving licence, the truck driver returned back after 20-25 minutes and
showed his willingness to pay the challan fee. In these circumstances,
truck driver was challaned for Rs.200/- and after taking this money his
driving licence was returned. The Truck Driver was given the official
receipt for this purpose. The explanation given by the petitioner for not
entering the same in the copy was that he was busy in completing the half
made challan of another person and had asked the driver to wait for some
time. Since the driver was in hurry he accepted Rs.200/- from him and
issued the receipt with the intention to fill up the copy later on with the
cashier. He had deposited the said amount of Rs.200/- with the Punjabi
Bagh Circle in the evening. It appears that the Authorities thought that
the petitioner, in the aforesaid circumstances, could not be charged for
serious charge of corruption and because of this reason it was decided
not to hold any regular departmental enquiry for major penalty
proceedings but to give him a show cause notice and whereby proposing
punishment for Censure. Of course, the charge, therefore, was that the
amount of Rs.200/- was not entered in the copy which was to be retained
W.P.(C) Nos.7786/05 & 12431/05

by the Department. On this charge explanation of the petitioner was not
found satisfactory and punishment of Censure was inflicted upon the
petitioner vide Orders dated 1.10.1990. The petitioner submitted his
appeal thereagainst which was also dismissed by the Appellate Authority
vide Order dated 1.4.1991. The concluding para of this order would be
relevant for our purposes and, therefore, we reproduce the same:
“I heard the petitioner and also gone through the
record. It is a fact that the petitioner did not make
endorsement immediately on the copy of the
receipt/challan when he endorsed the original
receipt/challan. This is the reason why he has been
censured. There was no difficulty for him to endorse the
copy also. Appeal is rejected. Let the appellant be
informed accordingly.”
This also reflects the mind of the Authority, namely, the main
reason for imposing the punishment was that the petitioner did not make
endorsement immediately on the copy of the challan when he endorsed
the original receipt/challan. When the punishment of Censure is given, as
per the extant instruction, such an employee is not to be considered for
promotion only for a period of six months and after the expiry of six
months the case of such an employee is to be considered for promotion
without having any regard to the punishment imposed. However, when

W.P.(C) Nos.7786/05 & 12431/05

Page 4

the case of the petitioner was considered by the DPC in the year 1992 as
well as 1994 for promotion to the post of Inspector (Executive), it was
rejected on account of the said punishment of Censure.

In these

circumstances the petitioner filed OA.No.1031/93 and OA.No.610/96
challenging his non-promotion. The OA No.1031/93 was disposed of by
the Tribunal vide its Order dated 16.3.1999 with the direction to the
respondent to consider the case of the petitioner for bringing his name on
promotion list `F’ (Executive) w.e.f. 26.8.92, with all consequential
benefits, within a period of one month from the date of receipt of a copy
of the said order. The other OA was also allowed vide orders dated
24.1.2000 on the same terms.
The respondents challenged these orders by filing petitions in
this Court.

These writ petitions were disposed of permitting the

respondents to file review petition. Thereafter, Review Petitions were
filed in which orders were reviewed by the Tribunal and ultimately the
OAs were heard afresh. OA.1031/93 was dismissed on 3.11.2003 and
other OA.610/96 was dismissed on 1.2.2001. Challenging these orders,
these petitions are filed by the petitioner.

On going through the impugned orders filed in both these
petitions it is clear that the Tribunal has taken the view that though there
was a penalty of Censure imposed upon the petitioner but it was “on a
charge of receiving bribe of Rs.200/-“. This is perceived as a serious
charge of corruption by the Tribunal on the basis of which Tribunal held
that DPC was entitled to take into consideration such a serious charge and
deny him the promotion.
Having regard to our discussion above, we are of the opinion
that the Tribunal has committed material irregularity and illegality in
appreciating the nature of charge. The petitioner was never charged for
receiving bribe of Rs.200/- which is clear from the language of show cause
notice, orders passed by the Disciplinary Authority as well as orders
passed by the Appellate Authority which are mentioned above. We have
already pointed out above that had there been a charge of bribe, the
Disciplinary Authority would not have initiated minor penalty proceedings
of Censure but would have conducted regular departmental enquiry
against the petitioner after serving proper charge-sheet. The charge of
not entering the compounding fee on the copy simultaneously with
issuing the challan to the truck driver is totally different from the
W.P.(C) Nos.7786/05 & 12431/05

Page 6

allegation that he took a bribe of Rs.200/- from the truck driver. This is a
fine and settled distinction which has to be borne in mind and in fact the
Authorities were also conscious of the same. In these circumstances, the
Tribunal without any material on record could not have treated the charge
against the petitioner as that of receiving bribe.
We thus hold that the order of the learned Tribunal cannot stand
judicial scrutiny. We accordingly set aside order dated 1.2.2001 passed in
OA.No.610/96 as well as order dated 3.11.2003 passed in OA.No.1031/93.
In these circumstances, we direct the respondents to convene Review DPC
for the years 1992 and 1994 keeping in view the orders passed by the
Disciplinary Authority and Appellate Authority imposing the punishment
of Censure only as explained by us in this order. The necessary exercise of
conducting Review DPC shall be taken within four months from today.
There shall be no orders as to costs.
