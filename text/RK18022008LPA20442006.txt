DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ. (ORAL)

1.

By the impugned judgment and order, the learned Single

Judge quashed the selection list prepared by the Selection
Committee incorporating in the said list the names of Dr. Muttayya
Koganuramath and Mr. D.R. Jotwani for the post of librarian. Being
aggrieved by the said order, the present appeal is filed by the
University contending, inter alia, that the aforesaid selection was
LPA 2044/2006

proper and that it is necessary for the University to obtain
revalidation of the decision of the Executive Council for all future
acts.
2.

On

going

through

the

records,

we

find

that

the

recommendation of the Selection Committee was quashed on the
ground that the Selection Committee was not validly constituted.
During the pendency of the present appeal, Dr. Muttayya
Koganuramath has already submitted his resignation and left the
University whereas Mr. D.R. Jotwani is also no longer with the
University and is not interested to be appointed as a librarian and, in
fact, was never appointed as such. It is, therefore, pointed out that
practically nothing survives in this appeal so far the said respondents
are concerned.

But the larger issue as to whether or not a

revalidation is necessary survives for consideration.
3.

On going through the records, we also find that since the

selection of the two persons has since been rendered infructuous
with the passage of time and change in the circumstances and
situation, therefore, this appeal has become infructuous.

We

accordingly dispose of the LPA 2044/2006 and CM No.14503/2006
as infructuous. So far the findings recorded by the learned Single
Judge are concerned, the same were passed in the light of the
subject matter. We do not express any opinion on the said opinion
in any manner at this stage and leave the same open for
consideration, as and when such issue is again raised in any other
appropriate case. In any case, so far the appointment of librarian is
LPA 2044/2006

Page 2 of 3

concerned, the University has to proceed in accordance with law
for appointment of a regular librarian in the University.

We give

liberty to the University to proceed in the matter for appointment of
the librarian in accordance with law and if any party at that stage
has any grievance, the remedy in accordance with law shall be
available.
