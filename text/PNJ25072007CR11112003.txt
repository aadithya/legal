Vide

CRP

No.1111/2003

petitioner/husband

has

challenged the order dated 6.8.2003 passed by the learned
Matrimonial Judge deciding respondent's application under
Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, granting monthly
maintenance of Rs.11 lacs to the wife with effect from the date
of her application i.e. 21.10.2002 till date of the order dated
6.8.2003.

I note that the period for which maintenance has

been awarded is 9 months and 16 days. Litigation expenses in
sum of Rs.1 lac have been awarded in addition.
2.
challenged

Vide CRP No.1114/2003 petitioner (husband) has
the

order

dated

21.7.2003

dismissing

his

application under Order 9 Rule 7 CPC.
3.

Vide CM(M) No.16/2005 petitioner (husband) has

challenged the order dated 6.8.2003 passed by the learned
Matrimonial Judge allowing application filed by the wife under
Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.
4.

It is stated in CM(M) No.16/2005 that revision

petition against the order dated 6.8.2003 granting interim
maintenance to the wife cannot be challenged by way of a civil
revision petition in view of a decision of the Supreme Court

reported as Shiv Shakti Coop. Housing Society, Nagpur v
Swaraj Developers & Ors, AIR 2003 SC 2434. Therefore remedy
is being invoked under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
5.

Thus, at the outset I dismiss CRP No.1111/2003 as

withdrawn.
6.

For the sequence of events and various orders

passed by the learned Matrimonial Judge, and as noted here-inunder, a fairly comical situation has come into existence.
7.

The parties got married on 24.3.2002. The marriage

broke down in less than 5 months. Petitioner, a resident of the
United States of America filed a divorce petition in the United
States of America.

Admittedly, he has obtained an ex-parte

decree of divorce from a Court having matrimonial jurisdiction
in the United States of America.
8.

The respondent was served with the notice of motion

taken out by the petitioner before the Matrimonial Judge in the
United States of America.

She opposed grant of divorce by

challenging the jurisdiction of the Courts in United States of
America.

But after filing the reply she absented.

Thus, it

resulted in the grant of an ex-parte decree for divorce in favour
of the petitioner.
9.

In India, respondent sought annulment of the

marriage by seeking a decree for divorce.

The petition was

filed within less than 1 year of the marriage. Remedy under
Section 12(1)(c) read with Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act
was invoked.
10.

As per the mandate of Section 14 of the Hindu

Marriage Act respondent sought waiver of the statutorily
prescribed period i.e. 1 year with effect from the date of the
marriage within which period except after obtaining from the
court after showing special circumstances petition seeking
annulment of the marriage could not be filed.
11.

A strange thing happened before the learned

Matrimonial Judge on 3.10.2002 when the petition seeking
divorce accompanied by the application under Section 14 of the
Hindu Marriage Act was filed.
12.

2 orders of even date were passed.

13.

Vide first order dated 3.10.2002 notice was issued in

the petition seeking annulment of the marriage by way of
decree for divorce. The notice was returnable for 2.12.2002.
14.

A second order of even date was passed. It records

as under:“I have heard the learned counsel for the
petitioner on the application under Section 14
of the Hindu Marriage Act. No valid and legal
ground is made out by the petitioner for
moving this application before the expiry of
one year.
Accordingly, the application is
dismissed.”

15.

It could be argued that having dismissed the

application filed by the respondent invoking Section 14 of the
Hindu Marriage Act, learned Matrimonial Judge was obliged to
dismiss the petition seeking divorce and therefore proceedings
conducted by the learned Trial Judge thereafter are without any
authority of law.
16.

Per contra, it could be argued that it was a curable

defect and proceedings are irregular and not illegal.
17.

Be that as it may, since notice was issued in the

main petition, learned Judge awaited return of the notice for the
next date i.e. 2.12.2002. In the meanwhile, on 8.11.2002 the
learned Judge took cognizance of an application filed by the
respondent under Section 151 CPC praying that the petitioner
be served through the employer.
18.

On 8.11.2002 learned Judge allowed respondent's

application filed under Section 151 CPC and directed service
upon the petitioner returnable for 2.12.2002 at the address of
the employer. Learned Judge was on leave on 2.12.2002. The
Court Reader adjourned the matter for 16.12.2002. On which
date, once again the learned Judge was on leave.

Reader

renotified the matter for 17.12.2002. On said date, fresh notice
was issued returnable for 27.1.2003.

Service not being

effected, fresh notice was issued returnable for 18.3.2003. On

said, petitioner was served at the address of the employer.
None appeared for him. He was proceeded against ex-parte.
Matter was renotified for 23.4.2003 for ex-parte evidence. On
said date, ex-parte evidence was led.
advanced immediately thereafter.

Arguments were

Matter was adjourned for

1.5.2003 for orders.
19.

On 1.5.2003 counsel appeared for the petitioner

before judgment could be pronounced and requested for
adjournment

stating

that

petitioner

intends

to

file

an

application under Order 9 Rule 7 CPC seeking recall of the order
dated 18.3.2003.
20.

On same date, necessary application under Order 9

Rule 7 CPC was filed. Another order of even date was passed
issuing notice of the said application to the respondent.
21.

In the interregnum, as noted above, on 21.10.2002,

the respondent filed an application under Section 24 of the
Hindu Marriage Act, notice whereof was issued to the
respondent.
22.

Learned Judge vide order dated 21.7.2007 dismissed

petitioner's application under Order 9 Rule 7 CPC.

Vide a

separate order of even date, petition for divorce filed by the
respondent was allowed.
23.

The learned Judge consigned the file to the record

room without realizing that respondent's application under
Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act was pending.
24.

On an oral mention by the respondent to the learned

Judge, he took up respondent's application under Section 24 of
the Hindu Marriage Act on 6.8.2003 and disposed of the same
granting to her monthly maintenance in sum of Rs.11 lacs.
25.

The learned Judge also took cognizance of an

application filed by the respondent under Section 152 CPC
praying

that

the

order

dated

3.10.2002

dismissing

her

application under Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act be
corrected.

The learned Judge passed the following order on

6.8.2003:-

26.

“By this order, I shall dispose of application u/s
152 read with Section 151 CPC filed by the
petitioner for decision of the application under
Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act filed by
them along with the petition.
The said
application was dismissed on 3.10.2002, but in
this case proceedings kept going on and
petitioner was granted ex-parte decree for
divorce on the ground of cruelty and decree have
already been passed and petitioner has taken
the copy of decree. Accordingly, order dated
3.10.2002 is recalled and application under
Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act is allowed.”
Surprisingly enough, petitioner has not challenged

the aforesaid order dated 6.8.2003.
27.

Fortunately for the petitioner he was rightly advised

by the counsel to seek setting aside of the ex-parte decree for

divorce by filing an application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC for
the reason when application under Order 9 Rule 7 CPC was filed
by the petitioner, as noted above, arguments had concluded in
the petition filed by the respondent and matter was renotified
for judgment. Thus, on the date when application under Order
9 Rule 7 CPC was filed it could not be said that the Court had
adjourned the hearing of the suit ex-parte.
28.

I note the decision of the Supreme Court reported as

AIR 1964 SC 993 Arjun Singh v Mohindra Kumar & Ors wherein
it was held that where arguments have been concluded and
suit stands adjourned for decision, only remedy is to await the
decision and file an application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC.
29.

For

record,

I

may

note

that

the

petitioner's

application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC was dismissed. I may
further note that the petitioner has filed an appeal registered as
FAO No.301/2004 challenging the ex-parte decree dated
21.7.2003 and the order dated 25.8.2004 dismissing his
application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC.
30.
decree,

Thus, issues pertaining to the legality of the ex-parte
the

order

dated

6.8.2003

allowing

respondent's

application under Section 152 CPC and recalling order dated
3.10.2002 and granting permission under Section 14 of the
Hindu Marriage Act to present the petition within 1 year of the

date of marriage would be adjudicated in said appeal.
31.

The question, whether the entire proceedings were

vitiated or not and whether order dated 6.8.2003 could be
passed rectifying the order dated 3.10.2002 and what is the
effect of the learned Judge not recording, even in the order
dated 6.8.2003, that a case of exceptional hardship or
exceptional deprivity has been made out entitling respondent
to have the statutory cooling period of 1 year waived would be
adjudicated in the said appeal.
32.

Thus,

CRP

No.1114/2003

is

disposed

of

as

infructuous but clarifying that issue as noted herein above
would be decided in FAO No.301/2004 and all permissible pleas
would be available to the petitioner to question the ex-parte
decree for divorce as also the legality of the order dismissing
his application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC.
33.

Pertaining to the challenge laid to the order dated

6.8.2003 granting monthly maintenance of Rs.11 lacs to the
respondent suffice would it be to note that the learned Judge
became functus officio when he granted the decree of divorce
on 21.7.2003.

That apart, learned Judge failed to appreciate

that petitioner had already filed an application under Order 9
Rule 7 CPC pointing out that he was not served in the petition
for divorce. Learned Judge failed to appreciate that he ought to

have at least ensured that the petitioner receives a copy of the
application filed by the respondent under Section 24 of the
Hindu Marriage Act. He ought to have granted an opportunity
to the petitioner to file reply thereto. Surprisingly enough, on
an oral mention, after he had consigned the file to the record
room on 21.7.2003 learned Judge resummoned the file from the
record room and passed the order dated 6.8.2003 allowing
respondent's application under Section 24 of the Hindu
Marriage Act.
34.

On the short ground of denial of principles of natural

justice, petitioner is entitled to have the order dated 6.8.2003
granting monthly maintenance to the wife to be set aside.
35.

Ordered accordingly.

36.

There is another reason why the order has to be set

aside.
37.

Learned Judge has treated the income of the

husband in the United States of America as the measure to
grant monthly maintenance to the wife who is in India.
38.

As held by the Supreme Court in the decision

reported as 2002 (6) SCC 281 United India Insurance Vs.
Patricia Jean Mahajan, when compensation has to be paid in
India to the claimants of a deceased working abroad, standard
of living in India, cost of living in India and other related factors

have to be considered and in light of the said facts considering
income of the husband in a foreign country further taking note
of the fact as to what is the cost of living in the said foreign
country, loss of dependence has to be worked out.
39.

Similar principles would apply to grant of monthly

maintenance to a wife stationed in India but husband being
abroad and earning in foreign currency.
40.

Unfortunately, no proceedings are pending before

the Matrimonial Judge.

Thus, no useful purpose would be

served in remanding the matter to the learned Matrimonial
Judge for fresh adjudication on respondent's application under
Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, more so when he became
functus officio on 21.7.2003 when decree for divorce was
granted.
41.

I draw the curtains by recording that it would be

open for the respondent to move an appropriate application in
FAO No.301/2004 pending in this Court wherein the husband
has challenged the ex-parte decree of divorce as also the order
dated 25.8.2004 dismissing his application under Order 9 Rule
13 CPC.

Respondent would be permitted to pray before the

learned Appellate Judge to take a decision on her right to seek
interim maintenance pursuant to the application filed by her
under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.

42.

Subject to the clarificatory rights of the respondent

herein above noted, CM(M) No.16/2005 stands disposed of
quashing

the

order

dated

6.8.2003

awarding

monthly

maintenance of Rs.11,00,000/- to the respondent as also
granting her litigation expenses in sum of Rs.1,00,000/-.
43.

No costs.
