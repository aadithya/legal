under Sections 420/406/120B/34 IPC was registered against the

defend was granted to the petitioners subject to their depositing
a sum of Rs.5,50,000/- in the court.

On

15.1.2007

anticipatory

bail

granted

to

the

petitioners automatically got cancelled due to the breach of the

17.

On

17.1.2007

non-bailable

warrants

were issued

against the petitioners.
18.

Thereafter proceedings under Sections 82 and 83 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 were initiated against the
petitioners.
19.

On

16.3.2007

petitioner

No.4

was

arrested

and

remanded to judicial custody till 19.3.2007.
20.

On 19.3.2007 petitioners No.1 to 3 surrendered before

the court of learned Metropolitan Magistrate.

Bail applications

moved by all the petitioners were dismissed.

Petitioners were

remanded to judicial custody till 21.3.2007.
21.

On 21.3.2007 a compromise deed was executed

between respondent No.1 and petitioners No.1 and 2. Under the
compromise deed the petitioners were to pay Rs.36,00,000/- to
respondent No.1 on or before 20.6.2007.

As a security,

petitioners handed over physical possession of property bearing
No.20/2799, Beadon Pura, Karol Bagh, New Delhi as also title
deeds of the said property to respondent No.1. One of the term
of the compromise was that if the petitioners failed to make
required payment on or before 20.6.2007, respondent No.1 shall
Cont.Cas(C) No.567/07

page 4 of 8

be entitled to sell the aforesaid property and appropriate the
amount recovered as sale proceeds.
22.

Noting the compromise entered into between the

parties, vide order dated 23.3.2007, the learned Metropolitan
Magistrate granted interim bail to the petitioners.
23.

Afore-noted facts are admitted facts. From here on

starts the respective version of the parties.
24.

While respondent no.1 alleges that on 17.6.2007 he

met petitioner No.1 who expressed his inability to honour the
compromise dated 21.3.2007 and directed him to sell the
property to one Mr. Bhawani Shankar. That pursuant to the
direction of petitioner No.1, Bhawani Shankar paid a sum of
Rs.2,51,000/- as earnest money to respondent No.1.

Thus,

respondent No.1 asserts a right to sell the property No.20/2799,
Beadon Pura Karol Bagh, New Delhi.
25.

Per contra, petitioners deny that petitioner no.1 met

the respondent no.1 on 17.06.2007 and directed him to sell the
property. In fact, it is pleaded that petitioners made every
endeavor to honour the compromise dated 21.03.2007 but
instead of accepting payment in sum of Rs.36,00,000/- from the
petitioners, respondent No.1 chose to flout the compromise dated
21.03.2007 by accepting the earnest money from Mr. Bhawani
Shanker. Case of the petitioners is that under the compromise
Cont.Cas(C) No.567/07

page 5 of 8

dated 21.3.2007 they could pay Rs.36,00,000/- on or before
20.6.2007 and redeem the property.
26.

Petitioners contend that their intention of honouring

the compromise dated 21.03.2007 is evident from the fact that
on 22.6.2007 they filed an application before the learned
Metropolitan Magistrate praying that respondent No.1 be directed
to accept the payment of Rs.36,00,000/- and return the title deed
and keys of the property.

That on subsequent dates i.e.

29.06.07, 03.07.07, 18.07.07 and 20.08.07 respondent no.1
refused to accept the payment of Rs.36,00,000/- from the
petitioners.
27.

On the other hand, respondent no.1 contends that the

fact that petitioners had at no point of time any intention to
honour the compromise dated 21.03.2007 is evident from the
order dated 1.10.2007 wherein after noting that the parties have
not compromised the matter the learned Metropolitan Magistrate
had cancelled the interim bail granted to the petitioners and had
remanded them to judicial custody for a period of 15 days.
28.

Respondent no.1 further contended that immediately

thereafter the petitioners filed the present contempt petition.
That

vide

order

dated

3.10.2007

this

court

directed the

petitioners to deposit a sum of Rs.36,00,000/- with this court.
Noting the order dated 3.10.2007 of this court vide order dated
Cont.Cas(C) No.567/07

page 6 of 8

5.10.2007 learned Metropolitan Magistrate granted interim bail to
the petitioners. That it is crystal clear that the petitioners have
filed the present contempt petition with a view to avoid the
consequences of the order dated 1.10.2007 passed by the
learned Metropolitan Magistrate.
29.

To put it pithly, petitioners alleged contempt by

respondent No.1 in disobeying the compromise effected in Court
proceedings.
30.

At the outset I note that respondents No.2 to 4 are

police officers and I see no reason why they have been
impleaded as contemnors 2 to 4.

Indeed, said police officers

were not party to any settlement and they being in contempt
does not arise.
31.

It is settled law that contempt proceedings cannot be

resorted to as a weapon of offence and a contempt is a matter
between the Court and the contemnor.
32.

Thus, bona fides of the relator/petitioner assumes

significance.
33.

It is trite that unless a compromise results in an

undertaking to the Court and is accepted by the Court breach
thereof would not be actionable under contempt jurisdiction for
the reason a compromise inter se the parties, if breached, gives
rise to a cause of action to enforce the compromise by way of a
Cont.Cas(C) No.567/07

page 7 of 8

civil proceedings.
34.

In the instant case the conduct of the petitioners has

been blameworthy for the reason the petitioners were always in
default at virtually at every stage of the various compromises or
conditional orders granted in their favour.

Relatable to the

compromise effected on 21.3.2007, as is evident from the
respective pleadings of the parties a serious question of disputed
fact requiring evidence to be led has to be adjudicated before the
guilty party can be held accountable.
35.
they say.

The past conduct of the petitioners taints whatever
Evidence would have to be recorded whether

respondent No.1 obtained the go ahead of petitioner No.1 to
enter into an agreement to sell with Bhawani Shankar.
36.

In my opinion the dispute as projected cannot be

resolved in contempt jurisdiction as the same requires a
substantive adjudication at a regular trial.
37.

The notice of contempt is accordingly discharged.

38.

The contempt petition is dismissed.

39.

No costs.
