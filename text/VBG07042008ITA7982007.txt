V.B.Gupta, J.
The Revenue has filed this appeal under Section
260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short as „Act‟)
against the order dated 8th November, 2006 passed by
the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (for short as
„Tribunal‟), Delhi Bench „G‟ in ITA No.707/Del/2004
relevant for the assessment year 1990-91 vide which
the appeal filed by the Revenue was dismissed.
2.

The facts entailing the present appeal are that the

assessee is engaged in the business of manufacture
and marketing of springs and springs leaves required
for the automobile industry. Return of income for the
year under consideration was filed by the assessee on
30.12.90 declaring net loss at Rs. 4,40,36,000/-. Return
was processed under section 143(1) of the Act.
Subsequently, notice under section 143(2) of the Act

ITA No.798/2007

Page 2 of 12

was issued.

The loss under the normal provisions of

the Act was computed at Rs. 4,27,63,353/- inter alia by
making several additions/disallowances as enumerated
in the order of assessment dated 19.03.93.
3.

The Assessee has incurred Rs.19,48,125/- as

expenditure on account of customer introduction
charges which were debited as “Deferred Revenue
Expenses” in the balance sheet. The expenditure was
written off over a period of five years starting from the
assessment

year

1990-91

and

accordingly,

the

assessee claimed reduction of Rs. 3,89,625/- in the
return. The claim was allowed by the assessing Officer.
4.

Being unsatisfied from the assessment framed,

Assessee

Company

filed

appeal

before

the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) (for short as
„CIT [A]‟). In the appeal before CIT (A), by way of

ITA No.798/2007

Page 3 of 12

additional

ground,

Assessee

claimed

the

entire

deferred revenue expenses of Rs. 19,48,125/- in the
assessment year in appeal.

The CIT (A) allowed the

appeal.
5.

The Revenue preferred further appeal before

Tribunal. The Tribunal, in terms of its order dated
14.05.03 restored the matter to the file of Assessing
Officer

to

consider

and

decide

the

issue

after

examining the details.
6.

Thereafter, the Assessing Officer took up the

issue pursuant to the directions of the Tribunal and
passed an order under section 254 read with section
143(3) of the Act on 31.01.03 and he disallowed the
claim of Rs. 15,58,5000/- (i.e. Rs.19,48,125/- minus Rs.
3,89,625) with the following observations:

ITA No.798/2007

Page 4 of 12

“Since the claim for the deferred
revenue
expenditure
of
Rs.
15,58,500/- was not claimed by the
assessee in its return of income for
the assessment year 1990-91, the
same is not allowed.”

7.

Being aggrieved from the above assessment, the

Assessee preferred an appeal before CIT (A). Appeal of
the Assessee was allowed by inter alia holding that the
Assessing Officer erred in disallowing the expenditure
on the sole ground that no claim for deduction of the
amount was made in the return of income.
8.

Aggrieved thereby, the Revenue filed appeal

before Tribunal. The appeal of the Revenue was
dismissed and the order of the CIT (A) was confirmed
by the Tribunal.
9.

Aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal, the

Revenue filed the present appeal before this Court.
ITA No.798/2007

10. Thus, the principal question that arises for
determination in this appeal is “Whether the Tribunal
was right in law in allowing relief of Rs. 15,58,500/- in
the assessment year under consideration when no such
claim was made by the assessee in the return of
income?”
11. It is contended by the learned counsel for the
Revenue that Tribunal has erred both in law and on
facts in granting relief of Rs.15,58,500/- to the
Assessee on account of expenditure claimed by the
Assessee as „Deferred Revenue Expenditure‟ in the
Audited Balance Sheet. As per the relevant statutory
provisions no such claim can be allowed which has not
been claimed in return of income. Further, particulars
for the purpose of assessment have to be submitted
before the completion of assessment proceedings and
if the information is supplied subsequent to the
ITA No.798/2007

Page 6 of 12

completion of the assessment, it would mean that the
Assessment order will have to be reopened and the Act
does not contemplate such reopening of assessment.
Furthermore, in the absence of any direction given by
the Tribunal in the first round of proceedings to allow
the entire claim, the Tribunal failed to appreciate that
out of the entire Deferred Revenue Expenses an
amount of Rs.3,89,625/- has already been allowed by
the Assessing Officer and the remaining expenditure
was treated by the Assessing Officer in consonance
with the proper manner laid down under the law.
12. As clear from the above said facts, there is no
dispute that customer introduction charges did not
represent revenue expenditure. The principal ground
taken by the Revenue in this appeal is that if no claim
for deduction of the amount was made in the return of
income then deduction would not be allowed.
ITA No.798/2007

13. Section 254 of the Act says that the Appellate
Tribunal may, after giving both the parties to the
appeal an opportunity of being heard, pass such orders
thereon as it thinks fit.
14. Reference may be made to National Thermal

Power Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax
[1998] 229 ITR 383 (SC), where the Supreme Court
observed that:“The power of the Tribunal in
dealing with appeals is thus
expressed in the widest possible
terms.
The
purpose
of
the
assessment proceedings before the
taxing authorities is to assess
correctly the tax liability of an
assessee in accordance with law.
We do not see any reason to
restrict the power of the Tribunal
under Section 254 only to decide
the grounds which arise from the
order of the Commissioner of
Income-tax (Appeals). Both the
assessees
as
well
as
the
Department have a right to file an
appeal/cross-objections before the
ITA No.798/2007

Page 8 of 12

Tribunal. We fail to see why the
Tribunal should be prevented from
considering questions of law
arising in assessment proceedings
although not raised earlier.”

15. Refrence may also be made to Gedore Tools Pvt.

Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax (1999) 238
ITR 268, wherein the Apex Court decision in National
Thermal Power Co. Ltd. (supra) has been followed.
16. In the case of Jute Corporation of India Ltd. v.

Commissioner of Income Tax (1991) 187 ITR 688,
while dealing with the powers of the Appellate
Assistant Commissioner, the Supreme Court observed
that:“An appellate authority has all the
powers
which
the
original
authority may have in deciding the
question before it subject to the
restrictions or limitations, if any,
prescribed
by
the
statutory
provisions. In the absence of any
ITA No.798/2007

Page 9 of 12

statutory provision, the appellate
authority is vested with all the
plenary
powers
which
the
subordinate authority may have in
the matter. There is no good
reason to justify curtailment of the
power of the Appellate Assistant
Commissioner in entertaining an
additional ground raised by the
assessee in seeking modification of
the order of assessment passed by
the Income-tax Officer. This Court
further observed that there may be
several factors justifying the
raising of a new plea in an appeal
and each case has to be
considered on its own facts. The
Appellate Assistant Commissioner
must be satisfied that the ground
raised was bona fide and that the
same could not have been raised
earlier for good reasons. The
Appellate Assistant Commissioner
should exercise his discretion in
permitting or not permitting the
assessee to raise an additional
ground in accordance with law and
reason. The same observations
would apply to appeals before the
Tribunal also.”
17. In Goetze (India) Limited v. Commissioner of

Income Tax (2006) 284 ITR 323 (SC) wherein
ITA No.798/2007

Page 10 of 12

deduction claimed by way of a letter before Assessing
Officer, was disallowed on the ground that there was
no provision under the Act to make amendment in the
return without filing a revised return. Appeal to the
Supreme Court, as the decision was upheld by the
Tribunal and the High Court, was dismissed making
clear that the decision was limited to the power of
assessing authority to entertain claim for deduction
otherwise than by revised return, and did not impinge
on the power of Tribunal.
18. Further, revenue expenditure which is incurred
wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business
must be allowed in its entirety in the year in which it is
incurred. It cannot be spread over a number of years
even if the assessee has written it off in his books over
a period of years. [ Reliance can be placed on Madras

(SC)]
19. In view of the above discussion, it is very clear
that there is no prohibition on the powers of the
Tribunal to entertain an additional ground which
according to the Tribunal arises in the matter and for
the just decision of the case. Therefore, there is no
infirmity in the order of the Tribunal.
20. Accordingly, the appeal of the Revenue is hereby
dismissed.
