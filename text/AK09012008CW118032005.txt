1.

This is an application by the respondent under Section 17B of

the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking direction to the petitioner to
pay

the

last

drawn

wages

or

minimum

wages

to

the

applicant/respondent during the pendency of the writ petition.

2.

The respondent/applicant contended, inter-alia, that he was a

W.P(C) No.11803/2005

conductor in the petitioner corporation and that his services were
illegally terminated by order dated 4th August, 1994. The application
under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act seeking approval
to the order terminating his services was, however, declined by the
Tribunal by order dated 28th July, 2003 entitling respondent for
reinstatement in the service with all the consequential benefits. It is
contended that later on the Tribunal decided the industrial dispute by
order dated 8th March, 2004 holding that the services of the
respondent have been terminated illegally which order has been
challenged by the petitioner in the present petition.

3.

The respondent has contended that he has been out of job for

last many years, without specifying since when he has been out of
job. It is also contended that he is suffering grave financial difficulties
due to his unemployment and he has not been able to find any job.

4.

The application is contested by the petitioner/non-applicant on

the ground that the Tribunal has not decided rightly in declining
approval to order of removal of the petitioner. The petitioner has also
denied that the respondent was not permitted to join the duties by the
petitioner. The petitioner also denied that the respondent is facing
financial difficulties and is unable to find any job. It is rather
contended that huge amounts have been received by the respondent

W.P(C) No.11803/2005

Page 2 of 11

and consequently he is not facing any financial difficulties. However,
no particulars as to how much amount has been paid to the
respondent and whether he has been gainfully employed anywhere
has not been given by the petitioner.

5.

The learned counsel for the petitioner was asked to allow

respondent to join, however, on instruction he states that he cannot
be allowed to join duties.

6.

It is no more res integra that the provisions of Section 17 B of

the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 comes into operation when an
Award directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further
proceedings. The statute requires satisfaction of the following four
conditions:
(i)

(ii)
(iii)

(iv)

7.

an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in proceedings in a High Court or the
Supreme Court;
during the pendency of such proceedings, employer
is required to pay full wages to the workman;
the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any
maintenance allowance admissible to him under
any Rule;
such wages would be admissible only if the
workman had not been employed in any
establishment during such period and an affidavit
had been filed to such effect

While considering an application under this provision it is

W.P(C) No.11803/2005

Page 3 of 11

necessary to bear in mind that the spirit, intendment and object
underlying the statutory provision of Section 17B is to mitigate and
relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship resulting to a workman due
to delay in the implementation of an award directing reinstatement of
his services on account of the challenge made to it by the employer.
The preliminary consideration for making available such a relief to a
workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment.
It recognizes a workman’s right to a bare minimum to keep body and
soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award directing
his reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no inherent right
of assailing an order or an award by an industrial adjudicator by way
of an appeal. The payment which is required to be made by the
employer to the workman has been held to be akin to a subsistence
allowance which is neither refundable nor recoverable from a
workman even if the Award in favor of the workman is set aside by the
High Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar
T. Patel the Apex Court was of the view that the object under Section
17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain
extent, the hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay
in implementation of the Award.

8.

While considering an application under Section 17B of the

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 the Court cannot go into the merits of

W.P(C) No.11803/2005

Page 4 of 11

the case in the writ petition. It was so held in 86 (2000) DLT
510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.

9.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 titled Town Municipal, Athani v.
P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman
has a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and
cannot be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum
Wages Act for enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was
concerned with the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the
Court would have a bearing on the issues raised before this Court as
well. From a conspectus of the authoritative pronouncements of the
Apex Court, the right of a workman to an amount equivalent to the
wages notified under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact,
recognition of the constitutional mandate and nothing more. It is
undoubtedly, the bare minimum which is required by the workman to
subsist and is nothing more. Full wages last drawn can therefore only
mean all the wages that have fallen due at least from the date of the
Award.

10.

This also cannot be disputed that granting relief under Section

17B of the Act and passing orders directing payment of wages last

W.P(C) No.11803/2005

Page 5 of 11

drawn, is generally the rule; refusing to grant relief under Section 17B
is an exception, as it could be passed only in the rarest of the rare
cases of jurisdictional error where there is no relationship between the
parties.

11.

A single Judge of this Court had culled the principles laid down

in various judicial pronouncement for grant of interim relief under
Section 17 B of the Act in 134 (2006) DLT 49, Food Craft Instt. Vs
Rameshwar Sharma & anr. As under:

(i)
An application under Section 17B can be made only
in proceedings wherein an industrial award directing
reinstatement of the workman has been assailed.
(ii)
This Court has no jurisdiction not to direct
compliance with the provisions of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act if all the other conditions
precedent for passing an order in terms of the Section
17B of the Act are satisfied [Re : (1999) 9 SCC 229
entitled Choudhary Sharai v. Executive Engineer,
Panchayati Raj Department & Anr.].
(iii) As the interim relief is being granted in exercise of
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
the High Court can grant better benefits which may be
more just and equitable on the facts of the case than the
relief contemplated by Section 17B. Therefore, dehors the
powers of the Court under Section 17B, the Court can
pass an order directing payment of an amount higher
than the last drawn wages to the workman [Re : (1999) 2
SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kirtikumar T. Patel].
(iv)

Such higher amount has to be considered necessary

W.P(C) No.11803/2005

Page 6 of 11

in the interest of justice and the workman must plead
and make out a case that such an order is necessary in
the facts of the case.
(v)
The Court can enforce the spirit, intendment and
purpose of legislation that the workman who is to get the
wages from the date of the award till the challenge to the
award is finally decided as per the statement of the
objections
and
reasons
of
the
Industrial
Disputes(Amendment) Act, 1982 by which Section 17B
was inserted in the Act [Re : JT 2001 (Suppl.1) SC 229,
Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam (para 12)].
(vi)
An application under Section 17B should be
disposed of expeditiously and before disposal of the writ
petition [Re : 2000 (9) SCC 534 entitled Workman v.
Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd.].
(vii) Interim relief can be granted with effect from the
date of the Award [Re : JT 2001 Supplementary (1) SC
entitled Regional Authority, Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam;
2004 (3) AD (DELHI) 337 entitled Indra Perfumery
Company v. Sudarshab Oberoi v. Presiding Officer].
(viii) Transient employment and self-employment would
not be a bar to relief under Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act [Re : 2000 (1) LLJ 1012 entitled Taj Services
Limited v. Industrial Tribunal; 1984 (4) SCC 635 entitled
Rajinder Kumar Kundra v. Delhi Administration; 109
(2004) DLT 1 entitled M/s. Birdhi Chand Naunag Ram
Jain v. P.O., Labour Court No. IV & Others].
(ix) The Court while considering an application under
Section 17B of the ID Act cannot go into the merits of the
case, the Court can only consider whether the
requirements mentioned in Section 17B have been
satisfied or not and, if it is so, then the Court has no
option but to direct the employer to pass an order in
terms of the statute. It would be immaterial as to whether
the petitioner had a very good case on merits [Re : 2000
W.P(C) No.11803/2005

Page 7 of 11

(5) AD Delhi 413 entitled Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander].
(x) A reasonable standard for arriving at the conclusion
of the quantum of a fair amount towards subsistence
allowance payable to a workman would be the minimum
wages notified by the statutory authorities under the
provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 in respect of
an employee who may be performing the same or similar
functions in scheduled employments. [Re: Rajinder
Kumar Kundra v. Delhi Administration, (1984) 4 SCC
635; Sanjit Roy v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1983 SC 328;
decision dated 3rd January, 2003 in Writ Petition (Civil)
Nos. 3654 & 3675/1999 entitled Delhi Council for Child
Welfare v. Union of India; DTC v. The P.O., Labour Court
No. 1, Delhi & Ors., 2002 II AD (Delhi) 112 (para 12, 13)]
(xi) Interim orders directing payment to a workman can
be made even on the application of the management
seeking stay of the operation and effect of the industrial
Award and order. Such interim orders of stay sought by
the employer can be granted unconditionally or made
conditional subject to payment or deposits of the entire or
portion of the awarded amount together with a direction
to the petitioner employer to make payment of the wages
at an appropriate rate to the workman. Such an order
would be based on considerations of interests of justice
when balancing equities.
(xii)
For the same reason, I find that there is no
prohibition in law to a direction by the Court to make an
order directing payment of the wages with effect from the
date of the Award. On the contrary, it has been so held in
several judgments that this would be the proper course
[Re : Regional Authority, Dena Bank & Anr. v.
Ghanshyam, reported at JT 2001 (Suppl. 1) SC 229 and
Indra Perfumery Co. Thr. Sudershab Oberoi v. Presiding
Officer & Ors., 2004 III AD (Delhi) 337].
(xiii) While passing an interlocutory direction for payment
of wages, the Court may also secure the interests of the
W.P(C) No.11803/2005

Page 8 of 11

employer by making orders regarding refund or recovery
of the amount which is in excess of the last drawn wages
in the event of the industrial award being set aside so as
to do justice to the employer.
(xiv) A repayment to the employer could be secured by
directing a workman to given an undertaking or offer
security to the satisfaction of the Registrar (General) of
the Court or any other authority [Re : para 12, 2002 (61)
DRJ 521 (DB), Hindustan Carbide Pvt. Ltd. v. Govt. of
NCT of Delhi & Ors.(supra)]
(xv) In exercise of powers under Article 226 and Article
136 of the Constitution, if the requisites of Section 17B of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are satisfied, no order
can be passed denying the workman the benefit granted
under the statutory provisions of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 [Re: 1999 (2) SCC 106,
Dena Bank v. Kirtikumar T. Patel (para 23)].
(xvi) Gainful employment of the workman; unreasonable
and unexplained delay in making the application by the
workman after the filing of the petition challenging the
award/order; offer by the employer to give employment to
the workman would be a relevant factors and
consideration for the date from which the wages are to be
permitted.
(xvii)It will be in the interest of justice to ensure if the
facts of the case so justify, that payment of the amount
over and above the amount which could be directed to be
paid under Section 17B to a workman, is ordered to be
paid only on satisfaction of terms and conditions as
would enable the employer to recover the same [para 13
of Regional Manager, Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam].
(xviii)The same principles would apply to any interim
order in respect of a pendent lite payment in favour of the
workman.

12.

In the present case the applicant fulfills all the criteria for

availing the benefit under section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act
as apart from bald allegations nothing has been shown by the
petitioners which will deny the respondent the benefit of section 17B
of the Act. However, the respondent/applicant has not specified the
date from which he has been out of job. The learned counsel for the
petitioner, in the circumstances, states that since the plea of the
respondent that he has been out of job is not specific about the year
from which he has been out of job, therefore the back wages at the
rate of last drawn wages or minimum wages be granted to the
respondent from the date of application which is 8th August, 2005.

13.

Considering the facts and circumstances, it is inevitable to infer

that the respondent is entitled for wages from the date of application
and to direct the petitioner to pay the last drawn wages or the
minimum wages whichever is higher from 8th August, 2005, the date
of application. The arrears of the wages if not already paid be paid
within four weeks. The petitioner shall continue to pay to the
respondent the last drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is
higher by 7th of every month. The respondent shall also file an
affidavit undertaking that in case the petitioner succeeds in the writ
petition and it is held that the respondent is not entitled for minimum
wages, then the difference in the last drawn wages and the minimum
W.P(C) No.11803/2005

Page 10 of 11

wages shall be refunded by the respondent within the time granted by
this Court. The undertaking to this effect be filed by the respondent
within two weeks.
With these directions the application is disposed of.
