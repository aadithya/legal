1. By

way

of

this

application,

petitioner

has

sought

condonation of delay in filing the objection petition
registered as OMP No. 235/2004. The grounds of delay in
filing the objection petition to the award are:

There is

delay of approximately one month and 12 days in filing
the objection petition which was filed on 5.7.2004.

2. It is averred in the application that under the proviso to
Section 34(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act
(hereinafter referred to as Act), the Court can condone the
delay of 30 days over and above the 90 days which in the
present case fell on 23.6.2004 during summer vacation and
the petition was filed on the reopening of the High Court of
OMP No. 235/2004

Page 2 of 20

Delhi on 5.7.2004. In view of the provisions contained in
Section 34(3) read with Section 4 of the Limitation Act and
since petition was filed on the opening day of the High
Court, petitioner is entitled to condonation of delay in filing
the objection petition. Hence this application.

3. Respondent contested the present application contending
inter alia that this application is not maintainable as there
is delay of one month and 12 days in filing the objections to
the award and delay of more than one month can be
condoned as per proviso to section 34(3) of the Act if
sufficient cause is shown for delay in filing the objections to
the arbitral award beyond the period of 90 days.

It is

alleged that Section 5 of the Limitation Act does not apply
to the proceedings under the Act and the petitioner cannot
take any benefit of the Section 4 of the Limitation Act even
if it is applicable but, the petitioner failed to file objections
on the opening day of the Court after summer vacation i.e.
3.7.2004.

Therefore,

application

does

not

disclose

sufficient cause for delay in filing the objection petition and
is liable to be dismissed.

4. Learned counsel for the petitioner/applicant has submitted
that it was due to administrative exigencies and the time

OMP No. 235/2004

Page 3 of 20

taken by various departments in taking decision to file
objections to the arbitral award that there was delay in
filing the objection petition under Section 34 of the Act.
These administrative exigencies are sufficient cause for
condonation of delay in filing the petition.

Therefore,

petitioner is entitled to condonation of delay on the analogy
of Section 5 of the Limitation Act.

She has referred to

following judgments to support her submissions:

1. State of Rajasthan v. Shri Umrao Singh – 1994(5)
SLR 638.
2. State of Haryana v. Chandra Mani and Ors. (1996) 3 SCC 132.
3. Collector, Land Acquisition, Anantnag and
another v. Mst. Katiji and others – AIR 1987 SC
1353.
4. G. Ramegowda, Major etc. v. The Special Land
Acquisition Officer, Bangalore – AIR 1988 SC
897.
5. Union of India v. R.P. Builders – 57 (195) DLT
337 (DB).
6. Union of India v. Shiv Darshan Singh (Sh.) & Ors.
- 1999 IV AD (Delhi) 226.
7. Kutch District Panchayat v. Premji V. Dudiya –
MANU/GJ/0239/2000.
8. State of West Bengal, represented by The
Secretary, Department of Finance, Government
of West Bengal v. West Bengal Judicial Service
Association and Ors.
9. State of Gujrat v. Heirs of Decd. Praga Dungar.
5. It is further submitted that under Section 5 of the
Limitation

Act

where

administrative

exigencies

are

common in the government departments, delay on account
of

exigencies

OMP No. 235/2004

is

considered

as

sufficient

cause

for

Page 4 of 20

condonation of delay. She has prayed that in the present
case also administrative exigencies responsible for delay in
filing the objection petition be considered as sufficient
cause and delay in filing the objection petition be
condoned.

6. Learned counsel for the respondent has refuted these
submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner and
has alleged that Section 5 of the Limitation Act has no
application to the present proceedings and therefore,
petitioner is not entitled to take any benefit under the said
provision of law.

7. State of Rajasthan (supra) is a case in which the special
appeal to the Division Bench against the judgment of the
Single Judge was delayed by 112 days. Since the delay was
found to have been caused on account of administrative
exigencies, it was found that it was sufficient ground for
condonation of delay in filing the appeal.

8. In State of Haryana (supra) also there was delay in filing
the

Page 5 of 20

having regard to impersonal bureaucratic set-up involving
red-tapism, delay was considered as sufficient cause and
was condoned.

9. In Collector, Land Acquisition, Anantnag and another

(supra) since there was delay in filing the appeal, it was
observed that Court should adopt liberal approach while
applying the test of sufficient cause fairly to all litigants.
The government department was considered to be entitled
to condonation of delay because of administrative delays.

10.In G. Ramegowda, Major etc. (supra) also the cause of
delay alleged to be inaction on the part of the government
counsel was found to be sufficient cause to condone the
delay.

11. In Union of India v. R.P. Builders (supra) while
observing that when sufficient cause pleaded was merely
based upon the delay in the movement of the file and
obtaining the legal opinion or sanction for filing the
objections to the award and in filing the appeal was
considered to be sufficient cause for condonation of delay.

12. In Union of India v. Shiv Darshan Singh (Sh.) & Ors.

(supra) there was a slow movement of file at various levels
OMP No. 235/2004

Page 6 of 20

and no benefit was caused out of delay to the appellant
Union of India.

Delay of 167 days was condoned under

Section 5 of the Limitation Act.

13.In Kutch District Panchayat (supra) the Court was
pleased to condone the delay in filing the appeal due to
procedural delay by bureaucrats treating it as sufficient
cause within Section 5.

14.In State of West Bengal as well the delay in filing the
appeal before the Division Bench because of handing of the
file by the Government was treated as sufficient cause and
the delay in filing the appeal was condoned.

15.In State of Gujrat (supra) delay in filing the appeal was
condoned under Section 5 of the Limitation Act as
compliance of government procedure of filing appeal took
long time and delay being procedural cause was condoned.

16.None of these judgments have any application to the facts
and circumstances of this case.

All the above said cases

relate to the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act
which are applicable to civil suits and appeal and has no
application to any of the provisions contained in the Act.
Sub Section 3 of Section 34 of the Act prescribes the
OMP No. 235/2004

Page 7 of 20

limitation for filing an objection petition against an arbitral
award in a Court. It reads as under:
“Section 34 (3)- An application for
setting aside may not be made after
three months have elapsed from the date
on which the party making that
application had received the arbitral
award or, if a request had been made
under section 33, from the date on which
that request had been disposed of by the
arbitral tribunal:
Provided that if the court is satisfied that
the applicant was prevented by sufficient
cause from making the application
within the said period of three months it
may entertain the application within a
further period of thirty days, but not
thereafter.”

17. Bare reading of the said provision makes it clear that
Court has power to entertain an application under Section
34 of the Act beyond the period of three months if it is
satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient
cause from making the application within the said period of
three months. There is a clear embargo on the extension of
time in entertaining the application beyond the period of
thirty days which is obvious from the words “but not
thereafter”. These provisions are mandatory in nature and
in no manner can be ignored. They have to be strictly
observed by the Court while considering the prayer for
condonation of delay in filing the objection petition beyond
the period of three months. In other words, the applicant
OMP No. 235/2004

Page 8 of 20

could take benefit of 30 days extension period beyond
three months in filing the objection petition.

18.Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act reads as follows:

“Section 29 (2): Where any special or
local law prescribes for any suit, appeal
or application a period of limitation
different from the period prescribed by
the Schedule, the provisions of section 3
shall apply as if such period were the
period prescribed by the Schedule and
for the purpose of determining any
period of limitation prescribed for any
suit, appeal or application by any special
or local law, the provisions contained in
sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) shall apply
only in so far as, and to the extent to
which, they are not expressly excluded
by such special or local law.”

19.Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there is
no express provision under the Act, 1996 excluding the
applicability of Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act.
Therefore, when the applicability of those sections is not
excluded, wherever any of the sections 2 to 24 of the
Limitation Act are required to be applied can be applied
without any hesitation.

20.I do not agree with the contentions of the learned counsel
for the petitioner when it comes to application of section 5
of the Limitation Act because sub section 3 of Section 34 of
OMP No. 235/2004

Page 9 of 20

the Act makes it very clear that the Court cannot extend
the period for filing the objection petition beyond thirty
days after expiry of three months as prescribed under the
Act. Under any circumstance sufficient cause is required to
be seen by the Court for extending the period of limitation
by thirty days following expiry of three months period for
accepting the objection petition. Even if the administrative
exigencies as disclosed in the application are considered to
be sufficient cause, petitioner can only seek extension of 30
days time after expiry of three months of the receipt of the
award. The award was received on 23.2.2004. Petitioner
was required to file the objection petition by 23.5.2004.
Petitioner failed to file the objection petition during that
period.

The extended period of thirty days expired on

23.6.2004.

Therefore even if delay of 30 days over and

above three months in filing the objection petition is
condoned, the objection petition is barred by period of
limitation and under no circumstance the Court can extend
this period.

21.The other line of argument taken by the learned counsel
for the petitioner is that by virtue of Section 4 of the
Limitation Act when the prescribed period of limitation in
a suit, appeal or application expires on a day when the

OMP No. 235/2004

Page 10 of 20

Court is closed, the suit appeal or application can be
instituted, preferred or made on the day when the Court
reopens.

According to her, the High Court opened on

5.7.2004 and on the same day the petition under Section
34 of the Act was filed and by application of the said
section petitioner is entitled to condonation of delay, if any,
and the objection petition is to be entertained by the Court.
She has relied upon Durga Enterprises v. Union of

India

(UOI)

and

Ors.

ALD

573

&

MANU/AP/0959/2003 .

22.Learned counsel for the respondent while controverting
the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner has
argued that limitation period contained in Section 34 of the
Act being a special statute, provisions of sections 4 to 24 of
the Limitation Act are not applicable because of the word
used “but not thereafter” in Section 34 of the Act.

The

period of 120 days cannot be extended under any
circumstance by the Court. He has referred to following
judgments:

1. Union of India v. M/s Popular Construction
Company – JT 2001 (8) SC 271.
2. HMP Engineers Ltd. and others v. Ralies
India Ltd. & Others – 2004 (1) RAJ 198.
3. State of H.P. v. Kataria Builders – 2003(2)
ALR 526.
OMP No. 235/2004

Page 11 of 20

4. Assam Urban Water Supply and Sewerage
Board v. Subhash Project and Marketing
Ltd. - AIR 2005 Gauhati 112.
23.Section 29 (2) of the Limitation Act does make the
provisions contained under Sections 4 to 24 of the said Act
applicable so far as they are not expressly excluded by
such special law or local law. Proviso to Sub Section 3 of
Section 34 of the Act as discussed above has put an
embargo on the Court not to extend the period of limitation
for filing an objection petition beyond a period of 30 days
after the expiry of three months; the statutory period for
filing the objection petition, on receipt of award by virtue
of use of the words “but not thereafter”.

Therefore, when

there is express exclusion of the provisions contained in
Sections 4 to 24, Section 29 of the Limitation Act has no
application to the present case.

24.To say that the Court has the power to entertain an
application to set aside an award beyond the extended
period under the proviso would render the phrase 'but not
thereafter' wholly otiose.

In Union of India v M/s.

Popular Construction Company – JT 2001 (8) SC 271
Division Bench of the Supreme Court has discussed
provisions contained in Section 34 of the Act vis-a-vis the
application of section 29(2) of the Limitation Act for
OMP No. 235/2004

Page 12 of 20

condonation of delay in filing the objection petition. While
interpreting section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, it was
observed that it will apply when “(i) there is a special or
local law which prescribes a different period of limitation
for any suit, appeal or application; and (ii) the special or
local law does not expressly exclude those sections.”
While interpreting the language of Section 34 of the 1996
Act, it was observed:

“As far as the language of section
34 of the 1996 Act is concerned, the
crucial words are 'but not thereafter'
used in the proviso to sub-section (3). In
our opinion, this phrase would amount to
an express exclusion within the meaning
of section 29(2) of the Limitation Act,
and would therefore bar the application
of section 5 of that Act. Parliament did
not need to go further. To hold that the
court could entertain an application to
set aside the award beyond the extended
period under the proviso, would render
the phrase 'but not thereafter' wholly
otiose. No principle of interpretation
would justify such a result.”

Pushpa

P.

Mulchandani

&

Ors.

v.

Admiral

Radhakrishin Tahilani (Retd.) & Ors. - 2001(4) RAJ
139 (Bom) it was observed that though 1996 Act contains
no specific words of exclusion, an examination of the
scheme of the Act would suggest that the intention was to
exclude the application of the provisions of sections 4 to 24
OMP No. 235/2004

Page 13 of 20

of the Limitation Act by using words “but not thereafter” at
the end of the proviso to sub-section (3) of Section 34.

26.In Assam Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Board

(supra), the Division Bench of the Gauhati High Court
while following

M/s. Popular Construction Company

(supra) case observed that when proviso to Section 34 of
the Act specifically provided for an additional period of 30
days and also provided for not entertaining an application
for setting aside the award

thereafter, it has to be

understood that there has been an exclusion of the
provisions of Section 4 of the Limitation Act which enables
the filing of the suit on a day when the prescribed period
expires on a holiday.

Therefore, the Court refused to

entertain an objection petition under Section 34 of the Act
when it was filed on the day succeeding the holiday.

27.In State of H.P. (supra) while following M/s. Popular

Construction Company (supra) it was held that the
provisions of sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act would
not apply to an appeal, suit or application where a different
period

is

provided

under

the

Special

Act

and

the

applicability of such sections is expressly or by necessary
implications excluded.

OMP No. 235/2004

It was further observed that

Page 14 of 20

expression “but not thereafter” used in the proviso to sub
section 3 of Section 34 of the Act clearly debars a Court
from entertaining an application under the said provisions
for setting aside the award if not filed within the
prescribed period or within extended period of 30 days.

28.In HMP Engineers Ltd. and others (supra) it was held
that provisions of sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act and
section 14 of the said act are not applicable in respect of
limitation governing petition under Section 34 of the Act
for extending the period of limitation in filing the objection
petition. It was observed:

“The Limitation Act, 1963 does not in
terms prescribe any limitation for an
application to set aside an Award.
Section 34 itself has prescribed the
limitation
in
sub-section
(3),
the
limitation being a period of three months
from the date on which the party making
that application had received the Arbitral
Award, or if a request has been made
under Section 33, from the date on
which such a request has been disposed
of by the Arbitral Tribunal.
Section
34(3) clearly provides that no application
can be made after the expiry of three
months.
Proviso to sub-section (3)
enables the Court to entertain such an
application if satisfied that the applicant
was prevented by sufficient cause from
making the application, but provides that
such an application can be entertained
only within a further period of 30 days
but not thereafter. If the view taken by
OMP No. 235/2004

Page 15 of 20

the learned Judge is to be accepted it
would render the words “but not
thereafter” occurring in the proviso of
Section 34(3) completely nugatory. The
legislature has provided in clear terms
that after the period of 3 months and 30
days, the Court has no power to condone
the delay in the presentation of the
application. In our view the provisions of
Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act,
cannot apply to an application under
Section 34(3) inasmuch as the provision
of Section 34(3) is a complete and self
contained Code, which does not admit
introduction or application of provisions
of law contained in Sections 4 to 24 of
the Limitation Act and there is clear
indication of the intention of the
legislature to exclude the provisions of
Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act.”

29.Thus, there has been a consistent view taken by different
High Courts that proviso to sub section 3 of Section 34 of
the Act by incorporating the words “but not thereafter”
specifically excluded the application of Sections 4 to 24 of
the Limitation Act for the purpose of extension of period of
limitation for entertaining an objection petition under
Section 34 of the Act for setting aside the arbitral award.
This proposition of law cannot be disputed by the learned
counsel for the petitioner.

30.However, to impress upon her arguments that Section 4 of
the Limitation Act is applicable to an application under
Section 34 of the Act, she has referred to Durga
OMP No. 235/2004

Page 16 of 20

Enterprises (supra).

But even this judgment is of no

much help to her. It is pertinent to mention here that in
the said judgment M/s. Popular Construction Company

(supra) has been referred to.

It was observed that the

said judgment makes it clear that period of limitation
cannot be extended by application of Section 5 of the
Limitation Act beyond the period mentioned under sub
section 3 of Section 34 of the Act and that sections 4 to 24
of the Limitation Act were applicable to a special law or a
local law unless they are expressly excluded. However, it
was observed that since there is no express provision
under the Arbitration Act, 1996 excluding the applicability
of Sections 4 to 24 of Limitation Act, the petition could be
filed on the reopening day of the Court after the vacations
by application of Section 4 of the Limitation Act.

With

great respect in view of the settled principle of law as
discussed above, this judgment is not of much significance.

31.Besides

the

language

used

in

the

section

'express

exclusion' can be inferred or followed from the scheme and
object of the special law or local law. Even in a case where
the special law does not exclude the sections 4 to 24 of the
Limitation Act by an express reference, it is open to the
Court to examine whether and to what extent the nature of
OMP No. 235/2004

Page 17 of 20

those provisions or the nature of the subject matter and
scheme

of

the

special

law

exclude

their

operation.

(Hukum Narain Yadav v. Lalit Narain Mishra – 1974

(2) SCC 133 referred to)

The reasons and objects of

prescribing limitation for filing an application under
Section 34 to challenge an award are to minimise the
supervisory

role

of

Courts

in

the

arbitral

process.

Therefore, this limit is unextendable by Court under
Section 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act.

by

G.
&

MANU/TN/0206/1998 as referred to by the learned
counsel for petitioner has no application to the arbitration
proceedings.

33.Even if the arguments of the learned counsel for the
petitioner that Section 4 of the Limitation Act is applicable
to the facts and circumstances of the present case as
extended period of limitation for filing the objection
petition expired during the summer vacation and the
objection petition was filed on the opening day of the High
Court of Delhi is considered, though not accepted by this
Court, it is made clear that even then objection petition is

OMP No. 235/2004

Page 18 of 20

barred by period of limitation.

34.Learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that the
High Court reopened on 3.7.2004 when the objection
petition should have been filed. Therefore, since it was not
filed on 3.7.2004 and it was filed only on 5.7.2004, Section
4 of the Limitation Act ceases to have application under the
facts and circumstances of the present case.

35.By virtue of notification No. 196/Estt/E-1/DHC dated
29.5.2004, arrangements for summer vacations 2004 were
notified. For the purposes of the present application, order
3 sub clause (viii) of this notification is relevant which
reads as follows:

“viii. Suits, Appeals, Applications or
other proceedings which are to be filed
on the re-opening day may also be
instituted/preferred or made in regular
course between 10.00 A.M. and 4.00
P.M. from Monday, the 28th June, 2004 to
Saturday, the 3rd July, 2004 as per
convenience of the parties....”

36.By virtue of this notification, petitioner could have filed
the objection petition on Monday, 28.6.2004, till Saturday,
3.7.2004 without waiting till 5.7.2004.

To say that the

objection petition could be filed only on the reopening of

OMP No. 235/2004

Page 19 of 20

the High Court after vacations on 5.7.2004 is falsified by
this notification.

I have already observed above that

Section 4 of the Limitation Act has no application to a
petition under Act challenging the arbitral award.

37.Consequently, I find no merits in the application.

Hence,

it is accordingly dismissed.

OMP No. 235/2004

38.Since application for condonation of delay is dismissed,
objection petition being barred by period of limitation is
liable to be dismissed. Under these circumstances, I need
not deliberate on the merits of the present petition. Hence
objection petition is accordingly dismissed with no orders
as to cost.
