PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
At the outset, it may be noted that after some

arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner stated that the
petitioner abandons challenge to the orders impugned in the
above captioned petitions but want a clarificatory order passed by
this Court.

Clarificatory order being that the proceedings

conducted before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate would be
preserved and the Court in which the complaint would be re-filed
would proceed from the stage matter had reached in the Court of
the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi.
2.

Learned counsel for the respondent states that since

petitioner is now conceding that the order impugned in the
petitions is a valid order, since learned Metropolitan Magistrate
has held that Courts at Delhi did not have jurisdiction over the
matter and hence returned the complaint, to be filed in the Court
of competent jurisdiction proceedings conducted at Delhi cannot
be preserved.
3.

Pertaining to Crl.M.C.No.2386/2001, relevant facts are

that in the year 1988 the officers of Directorate of Revenue
Intelligence intercepted a goods transport vehicle being truck

In November 2000 an application was filed

questioning the territorial jurisdiction of the Courts at Delhi. Vide

territorial jurisdiction.
13.

Chapter XIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973

deals with jurisdiction of the criminal courts in inquiry and trials.
Section 177 reads as under:-

14.

“177.
Ordinary place of inquiry and trial.–
Every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and
tried by a Court within whose local jurisdiction it was
committed.”
A bare perusal of Section 177 of the Code of Criminal

page 5 of 11

Procedure 1973 makes it clear that ordinarily, every offence has
to be inquired into and tried by a Court within whose local
jurisdiction the offence was committed.
15.

As observed by Blackstone: 'All crime is local, the

jurisdiction over the crime belongs to the country where the crime
is committed'.
16.

As explained by the Supreme Court in the decision

reported as AIR 1961 SC 1589 Purushottam Das Dalmiya vs. State
of West Bengal, AIR 1961 SC 1601 L.N.Mukherjee vs. State of
Madras, AIR 1963 SC 1620 Banwari Lal Jhunjhunwala vs. UOI, the
word used in Section 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973
is 'ordinarily'.

The said use of the word indicates that the

provision is a general one and has to be read subject to the
special provisions contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure
1973. Meaning thereby that the exception implied by the word
'ordinarily' need not be limited to those specifically provided for
by the law, for example Sections 181 to 184 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure 1973.
17.

In Purushottam Das's case (supra) in para 15 it was

observed as under:“15.
It is further significant to notice the
difference in the language of S.177 and S.233.
Section 177 simply says that ordinarily every
offence would be tried by a Court within the local
limits of whose jurisdiction it was committed. It
does not say that it would be tried by such Court
page 6 of 11

except in the cases mentioned in Ss.179 to 185 and
188 or in cases specially provided by any other
provision of law. It leaves the place of trial open.
Its provisions are not peremptory. There is no
reason why the provisions of Ss.233 to 239 may not
also provide exceptions to S.177, if they do permit
the trial of a particular offence along with others in
one Court. On the other hand, S.233, dealing with
the trial of offences, reads:
“For every distinct offence of which any
person is accused there shall be a separate
charge, and every such charge shall be tried
separately, except in the cases mentioned in
Ss.234, 236 and 239.”
The language is very peremptory. There is a clear
direction that there should be a separate charge for
every distinct offence and that any deviation from
such a course would be only in cases mentioned in
Sections 234, 235, 236 and 239.”
18.

Since learned counsel for the petitioner has conceded

to the legality of the orders impugned, which have held that
Courts at Delhi lacked territorial jurisdiction I need not expand on
the issue of territorial jurisdiction in relation to the offences save
and except to note that the legislature has evidenced the
legislative intent not with relation to a language which would oust
the jurisdiction of a Court not having the requisite territorial
jurisdiction but has used a language with reference to the place
where an offence would ordinarily be tried.

This, in my mind

would have a bearing on the question whether proceedings
conducted by a Court having no territorial jurisdiction would be
irregularly conducted proceedings or the proceedings would be a

page 7 of 11

nullity.
19.

In relation to civil law, 3 kinds of jurisdiction are

contemplated.

The same are (a) pecuniary jurisdiction (b)

territorial jurisdiction (c) jurisdiction over the subject matter.
Whereas pecuniary and territorial jurisdiction are not treated as
fundamental jurisdictions and are capable of being waived,
jurisdiction over the subject matter is treated as going to the root
of the competence of a Court and cannot be waived.

Decision

rendered by a Court lacking jurisdiction over the subject matter of
the dispute is a nullity and can be questioned at any stage.
20.

In criminal law, concept of pecuniary jurisdiction does

not exist. Two kinds of jurisdictions are recognized under criminal
law.

The first is territorial jurisdiction and the second is

jurisdiction over the subject matter.
21.

As held in the decision reported as AIR 1957 Punjab 86

State vs. Abdul Hamid, lack of territorial jurisdiction is only an
irregularity, not an illegality to vitiate the proceedings, unless
prejudice is caused. Lack of territorial jurisdiction does not render
the proceedings null and void.
22.

Section 462 of the Code of Criminal Procedure may be

referred to at this stage. It reads as under:“462.
Proceedings in wrong place. – No
finding, sentence or order of any Criminal Court
shall be set aside merely on the ground that the
inquiry, trial or other proceedings in the course of
page 8 of 11

which it was arrived at or passed, took place in a
wrong sessions division, district, sub-division or
other local area, unless it appears that such error
has in fact occasioned a failure of justice.”
23.

Prima facie, proceedings in a Court lacking territorial

jurisdiction would not render the proceedings void unless the
erroneous exercise of jurisdiction has in fact occasioned a failure
of justice.
24.

In the decision reported as JT 2001 (7) SC 55 State of

M.P. vs. Bhooraji & Anr., the Supreme Court considered the scope
and ambit of Section 462 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973.
25.

With reference to the view taken by the High Court

that the trial was vitiated on account of lack of jurisdiction by the
Sessions Court and requiring trial to recommence de-novo,
reversing the decision of the High Court, Supreme Court observed
as under:“13.
It is useful to refer to Section 462 of the
Code which says that even proceedings conducted
in a wrong sessions division are not liable to be set
at naught merely on that ground. However, an
exception is provided in that Section that if the
Court is satisfied that proceedings conducted
erroneously in a wrong sessions division “has in
fact occasion a failure of justice” it is open to the
Higher Court to interfere. While it is provided that
all the instances enumerated in Section 461 would
render the proceedings void, no other proceedings
would get vitiated ipso facto merely on the ground
that the proceedings were erroneous. The court of
appeal or revision has to examine specifically
whether such erroneous steps had in fact
occasioned failure of justice.
Then alone the
page 9 of 11

proceedings can be set aside. Thus the entire
purport of the provisions subsumed in Chapter
XXXV is to save the proceedings linked with such
erroneous steps, unless the error is of such a
nature that it had occasioned failure of justice.”
26.

It is apparent that the legislature was conscious of

possible occurences in criminal courts of cognizance being taken
in a wrong sessions division or a district or within areas.

The

legislature disfavoured the quashing of the proceedings and did
not direct repetition of the whole proceeding afresh.

Unless it

was shown that the error has occasioned a failure of justice the
proceedings were saved.
27.

Learned counsel for the respondent has not been able

to show as to in what manner a failure of justice has ensued as a
result of Courts at Delhi taking cognizance of the complaint and
proceeding ahead with the trial.
28.

I may note at this stage that I have not considered the

issue of acquiescence notwithstanding the fact that the accused
persons chose to participate in the proceedings before the
learned Metropolitan Magistrate at Delhi for 10 years before
questioning the jurisdiction of the Court on ground of territorial
jurisdiction.
