1.
The controversy in this case pivots around the question
whether the promotion of Janak Raj, Naib Subedar, the petitioner
in this case to the rank of PA Subedar took effect from the date of
notional promotion or from the date of actual promotion. The
indisputable facts of this case are these. The petitioner, Naib
Subedar Janak Singh joined the Indian Army on 18th July, 1974.
He was promoted to the rank of Naib Subedar on 1st January,
1991. Thereafter, vide letter dated 3rd September, 1996, he was
promoted to the rank of PA Subedar with effect from 16 th June,
1996. Para No. 3 of the promotion letter reads:3.
Please ensure that the above NCOs at the
time of physical assumption of higher rank meets
all the eligibility criteria (ACRs, Med and Discp)
for promotion laid down in Army Headquarters
letter No. B/33513/AG/FS 2(c) dated 18 Jan 93.”

2.

On 19th August, 1996 the petitioner while going out of the

Living in Barracks to attend games, parade, etc. at Unit location
fell down from the stairs and sustained injuries. He was placed in
Lower Medical Category. The petitioner was admitted in hospital
on 19th August, 1996 and was granted 56 days sick leave with
effect from 29th September, 2006. On expiry of sick leave he was
WP(C) No.233/1999

again admitted in the hospital and was discharged on 6th
December, 1996.

The petitioner was down graded to medical

category CEE (Temporary) for six months with effect from 5th
December, 1996. The petitioner suffered severe head injury with
compound

fracture

phalanx

and

certain

other

injuries.

Subsequently, he was granted 20% medical disability as he had
sustained injuries while on duty. His promotion order was
cancelled on 14.01.1997. Fresh proposal was asked vide letter
dated

23.04.1997.

On

04.05.1997,

signal

was

sent

to

headquarters with a request to withhold posting of Naib Subedar
Janak Singh.

05.05.1997, a letter was received from Command

Hospital, Lucknow for recategory of Naib Subedar Janak Singh.
On 10.05.1997, a letter was received that the petitioner did not
report for recategorisation. On 06.05.1997 a letter was sent by
headquarters that no category medical board in respect of Naib
Subedar Janak Singh had been held in Command Hospital,
Lucknow. On 07.06.1997 relinquishment of paid acting rank was
cancelled consequent to down gradation of the petitioner from
medical category Permanent to CEE Temporary. He was struck
off from strength on 01.08.1998 on completion of tenure as Naib
Subedar. The representation made by the petitioner did not ring
WP(C) No.233/1999

Page 3 of 6

the bell.

Consequently, he filed the instant writ petition for

issuance of writ in the nature of mandamus directing the
respondents to promote the petitioner with effect from 16th June,
1996 and grant consequential benefits from that date.
3.

It is not out of place to mention here that in the original writ

petition filed by the petitioner he had omitted the word “Medical”
occurring in para No.3 above. This Court vide its order dated 29th
November, 2005 came to the conclusion that the petitioner had
not approached the Court with clean hands. Consequently, the
writ petition filed by him was dismissed.

The petitioner filed a

review petition dated 3rd January, 2006, which was accepted by
the order passed by this Court vide order dated 30th March, 2007
and it was ordered that the writ be heard on merits.
4.

The respondent has contested the present writ petition.

5.

We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.

The

logic trotted out by the learned counsel for the petitioner was that
the petitioner stood promoted with effect from 16th June, 1996.
He also pointed out that he had assumed the charge and had
been working in place of his predecessor, who had retired. He,
however, could not produce the evidence to support this
contention.

We are of the view that all his assumptions are wet. The

above-said order dated 3rd September, 1996 is of utmost
importance. It elucidates that the elevation of the petitioner to
the above-said office was subject to certain conditions laid down
in the above-said order itself. It must be borne in mind that the
petitioner was to be promoted to next rank only if he met the
medical criteria at the time of promotion. Assumption of charge
means to undertake an office or duty ceremoniously in prescribed
or customary form. Anybody can see with half an eye that the
order dated 3rd September, 1996 unambiguously lays down that
charge would be given after the completion of the above said
conditions including the medical one.

This factor cannot be

skimmed over and in order to give full effect to the above said
order all the conditions must be fulfilled.

After getting the

medical fitness certificate, he was yet to take formally the
insignia of the above-said office. Since he could not satisfy all the
conditions, therefore, the promotion was rightly not granted in his
favour.
7.

Again, the petitioner was to be put on probation for a period

of three months on assumption of charge. Within the said period
the petitioner could be reverted back to the regimental duty and
WP(C) No.233/1999

Page 5 of 6

until requisite period of probation expired it was not to be
considered as a permanent posting.
8.

It is well settled that the petitioner can claim the benefits of

promotion from the date of his actual promotion and not from the
date of his notional promotion. This view neatly dovetails with
the observations made by the Apex Court in A.K.Soumini

Vs.

State Bank of Travancore and Another, (2003) 7 SCC 238.
9.

The writ petition is without merit and the same is therefore

dismissed. There shall be no orders as to costs.
