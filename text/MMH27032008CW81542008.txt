Briefly stated the material facts for this case, as apparent from the chart

incorporated in the Respondents’ counter affidavit, are that in the year 1988, the
petitioner had filed a petition being OA No.574/1998 before the Central Administrative
Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi. By way of that OA, the petitioner had sought
pay fixation in the selection post of PA to Director General (DG), further promotion to
the post of Personal Secretary (PS) to DG, subsequent promotion to the post of
Regional Director and upgradation of the existing post of PS to DG to the
corresponding post of PS in the CSSS hierarchy. The said petition was dismissed by
the Tribunal on 23rd April, 1999.

3.

Aggrieved by the dismissal of said OA, the petitioner filed a civil

writ petition being WP(C)No.6783/1999 in this Hon’ble Court. This writ petition was
dismissed on 10th March,2000. The petitioner thereafter filed another writ petition
being WP(C)No.4633/2000 before this Hon’ble Court, which was also dismissed on
22nd August, 2000.

4.

Petitioner filed a review application being RA 315/2000 before the

Administrative Tribunal against the order dismissing OA No.574/1998.

The said

review application was also dismissed by the Tribunal on 6th December, 2000.
Against the dismissal of the said RA, the petitioner filed another writ petition in this
Hon’ble Court being WP(C)No.498/2000. The said writ petition was also dismissed
by this Hon’ble Court on 10th January, 2001.

5.

In the year 2001 the petitioner filed another petition before the

Administrative Tribunal being OA 1399/2001 praying for the same reliefs. The said
petition was dismissed as withdrawn on 31st May, 2001. Another OA 1615/2001 filed
by the petitioner was dismissed by the Tribunal on grounds of res judicata on 19th
July, 2001.

6.

A fresh petition being OA 1305/2001 was filed before the Central

Administrative Tribunal. This petition was dismissed on 26th August, 2002 on the
ground that it was barred by principle of res judicata and constructive res judicata. A
review application being RA 255/2002 was also filed against the said order. The
same was also dismissed on 8th November, 2002.

7.

Thereafter,

the

petitioner

filed

another

application

being

MA

No.2923/2002 under Rule 24 of the CAT (Procedure) Rules, 1987 to quash the
earlier orders passed by the Tribunal dated 8 th November, 2002 in RA 255/2002 and
the order dated 26th August, 2002 in the OA No. 1305/2002. On 24th February, 2003
the said application was dismissed by the Tribunal as not maintainable under the
provisions of Rule 24 of the CAT (Procedure) Rules, 1987.

8.

In the year 2003 the petitioner filed another writ petition being

WP(C)No.2531/2003 before this Hon’ble Court. On 16th August, 2007 the said writ

WP(C) 8154 of 2007

page 3 of 7

petition was dismissed as withdrawn. No liberty was either sought or granted by this
Hon’ble Court while dismissing the said writ petition.

9.

In the year 2007, the petitioner filed the present writ petition praying for a

large number of diverse reliefs like payment of Rs.3 crores on account of arrears of
salary and interest, hearing of the present writ petition by a specially constituted
Bench within a definite time frame after placing on record the documents running into
200 pages. In the present writ petition the petitioner has contended that the judgment
and orders of the Tribunal dismissing OA No.574/1998 as well as MA No.2923/2002
are contrary to their own findings, violative of the principles of natural justice, equity
and fair-play. In the writ petition the petitioner has sought upgradation of the post of
PA to DG, DPC for promotion to the post of PS to DG, promotion to the post of
Deputy Regional Director and upgradation of post of PS to DG as PPS to DG.

10.

During arguments the petitioner confined his prayer for higher salary for a

period of ten years i.e. 1970 to 1980. Petitioner referred to an Office Order No.5 of
1983 of ESIC at page 59 by which special pay of Rs.40/-, which was attached to the
post of Personal Assistant to Director General, was made applicable to him w.e.f. 16 th
January,1970 to 31st December, 1972. The petitioner contended that he is entitled to
all the benefits as applicable to the Personal Assistant to the Director General in
ESIC, but for his proceeding on leave and deputation in terms of the letter at page
59. The genesis of his claim is that he had also worked as Personal Assistant
(Language) to the Railway Minister from the period 1970 to 1977. On his return from

WP(C) 8154 of 2007

page 4 of 7

deputation in 1977, he was not posted as PA to Director General, ESIC. The
petitioner further contends that no special pay as per his entitlement was paid. On
the contrary, he was posted as PA to the Medical Superintendent, ESIC Hospital at
Basai Dara Pur, New Delhi. In fact the petitioner alleges that Mr. Somnath, a person
junior to him, had been appointed as PA to Director General. Even, his protests were
not given any heed to.

Petitioner further says that he was eligible for proforma

promotion and he should have been given these benefits under the Rules from 1st
November, 1973. Petitioner also claims that PS to the DG was eligible for promotion
to the post of Assistant Regional Director. Petitioner contends that he be given that
benefit on the basis of a proposed amendment of the regulations.

11.

However, the petitioner during the course of arguments admitted that he

has no claims against the Railways as the Railways have duly paid him the
deputation allowance.

The respondents in their counter have stated that the

petitioner had been promoted to the post of Insurance Inspector/Manager Grade II on
ad hoc basis vide office order No.20/1970 and he was relieved of his duty as PA to
DG with effect from 16th January, 1970. Ironically, it was the petitioner who himself
submitted a representation dated 16th January, 1970 declining the said promotion on
the ground that his health does not permit him to do an outdoor/strenuous job. As
such at the petitioner’s request, his promotion to the post of Insurance
Inspector/Manager Grade II was cancelled.

Thus, the petitioner can have no

grievance on this score. It is also pertinent to mention that the petitioner had in OA
No.574/98 sought to rely on an order allegedly passed by Labour Secretary on 18th

WP(C) 8154 of 2007

page 5 of 7

July, 1994. The existence of such an order was denied by the respondent. In fact
the Tribunal perused the notings and files and satisfied itself that there was nothing
on record to show that any order dated 18th July, 1994 had been passed.

The

Tribunal also satisfied itself that the claims of the petitioner had been examined more
than once by the respondent No.1, who found themselves unable to accept the claim
of the petitioner. Consequently, the petitioner’s reliance on OA No. 5/1983 is
misconceived on facts.

12.

Moreover, from the above narrated facts, it would be apparent that the

petitioner has been re-litigating for a considerable number of years. In our view on
the principle of res judicata and re-litigation the petitioner is even barred from raising
new pleas for the same old relief. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in K.K.Modi Vs.
K.N.Modi and others, reported in (1998) 3 SCC 573 has held that it is an abuse of
the process of the court and contrary to justice and public policy for a party to relitigate the same issue which has already been tried and decided earlier against him.
This re-agitation may or may not be barred as res judicata. But if the same issue is
sought to be re-agitated, it also amounts to an abuse of the process of the court. The
Hon’ble Supreme Court has further held that if a spurious claim is made in a case, it
may also amount to an abuse of process of the court.

In our view, frivolous or

vexatious proceedings amount to an abuse of the process of the court especially
where the proceedings are absolutely groundless-like in the present case.

13.

We also expunge from the record averments/allegations of communal

bias, victimization and favouratism based on caste considerations.

Personal

allegations against the respondents’ counsel, Ms. Jyoti Singh, for being responsible
for the death of petitioner’s wife and other allegations in this regard of the petitioner
are also expunged.

14.

Consequently, we dismiss the present writ petition. Ordinarily, we would

have imposed heavy costs on the petitioner for having indulged in re-litigation but as
the petitioner is a senior citizen and a retired Government employee, who has also
lost his wife, we are imposing costs of only Rs.2,500/- (Rupees two thousand five
hundred).
