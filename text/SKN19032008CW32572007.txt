CORAM :
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJIV KHANNA
1. Whether Reporters of local papers may be
allowed to see the judgment?
2. To be referred to the Reporter or not?

3. Whether the judgment should be reported
in the Digest?
SANJIV KHANNA, J:

1. This common order will disposed of 18 writ petitions. The facts are
almost identical but for the sake of convenience, I have taken WP(C)
No.3257/2007 as the lead case.
2. In 1996, DDA had invited applications for allotment of 3,500 expandable
houses consisting of Category A, one room set and Category B, two
rooms set. The petitioners herein deposited Rs.15,000/- in October,
1996 and were successful. The petitioner, Mr.Madan Lal Nayak, in
WP(C)No.3257/2007, was allotted Category A flat with disposable
cost payable of Rs.3,47,300/-. Subsequently in the draw of lots held
on 21.3.1997, the petitioner was also given a specific flat number.
3. On 1st September, 1998, DDA raised another demand of Rs.4,52,600/in the case of Mr.Madan Lal Nayak.

In other cases also, similar

demands were raised.
4. Mr.Madan Lal Nayak and other petitioners challenged the additional
demand raised by the respondent/DDA in writ petitions. One of the
grievances made by the petitioners in these writ petitions was that
the area in question was not developed and habitable.

Learned

Single Judge of this Court in his judgment dated 27th November,

2003 granted some concession to the petitioners till the date
amenities and services were made available but on the question of
costs, no relief was granted. In the operative portion, learned Single
Judge directed that the petitioners shall pay 50% of the amount due
along with 12% interest from the date of demand cum allotment letter
and the balance 50% of the amount due would not be paid till the
date amenities and services were made available

The second

option given to the petitioners was that they could opt and pay the
entire demanded amount within 45 days without interest on the basis
of current costs.

This judgment dated 27th November, 2003 has

been followed in other cases.
5. Mr.Madan Lal Nayak exercised his option on or about 1st June, 2004
and other petitioners have also exercised their option in terms of
order dated 27.11.2003 but belatedly. DDA has not rejected the offer
or the option exercised by the petitioners on the ground that they had
belatedly made the same. The case of the petitioners along with the
case of one Mr.Praveen Prakash Tamta was examined by DDA
including the Vice Chairman.

It was noted that there were 14

applicants who had belatedly exercised their option after 45 days, i.e.
the time limit stipulated in the judgment dated 27.11.2003.

DDA

decided to accept the option exercised by the petitioners even after

45 days, looking at large number of flats, which were vacant at
Rohini at that time but this was subject to payment of current costs of
flats and no change in the locality was to be permitted. This file
noting was made on 24.3.2005.
6. Case of the 14 applicants who are similarly placed was accordingly
cleared by the Vice Chairman in his decision dated 24.3.2005.
However, only in one case of Mr.Praveen Prakash Tamta, demand
cum allotment letter was issued on 25.5.2005.

In cases of

petitioners, demand cum allotment letters were issued on or after
September, 2006 and the petitioners were charged cost price as
prevailing on the date of issue of the allotment letter. It is submitted
by the petitioners that this delay is entirely attributable to the
respondent/DDA and they should not be burdened with higher cost
because of lapse of DDA.

It appears that DDA noticed that current

cost of the flats in 2005 was lower than the old cost plus interest, if
the same was calculated on the basis of allotment letters issued in
1999. Queries and answers itself took two years and ultimately in
September, 2006, the matter was resolved in favour of the
petitioners. However, by this time, the current cost of the flat itself
had undergo revisions and had gone up several times.

After Vice

Chairman had approved allotment on current cost, the files of the

petitioners should have been processed within the reasonable time.
18 months or more time cannot be regarded in reasonable time
especially when the Officers of DDA were aware that the petitioners
have to pay current costs.

Moreover, the case of Mr.Praveen

Prakash Tamta, was processed along with the cases of the
petitioners but in his case, demand cum allotment letter was issued
on 25th May, 2005. Thus, there is substantial delay between the date
on which the letter of allotments was issued to Mr.Praveen Prakash
Tamta and the letter of allotment issued to the petitioners in
September, 2006 or thereafter. In some cases, demand cum
allotment letters have been issued in 2007 and the petitioners have
been asked to pay current cost as prevalent in 2007.
7. During the course of hearing, it was suggested to the parties that the
current costs as in January, 2006 can be taken as base and in
addition, the petitioners should also pay interest @12% thereon.
Learned counsel for the petitioners and the respondent/DDA were
asked to take instructions. Learned counsel for the petitioners on
instructions have stated that the said suggestion is acceptable.
Learned counsel for DDA on instructions states that the suggestion is
also acceptable to DDA, though this should not be treated as a
precedent in any other case. Learned counsel for DDA was asked to

make relevant calculations. As per calculations made by DDA and
shown in the Court, the total principal amount on the current costs
payable

as

on

January,

2006

works

out

to

Rs.8,96,263/-

(approximately, the amount may change depending upon size etc.).
The disposal cost along with 12% interest with effect from 02.2.2006
till 31.3.2008 works out to Rs.11,29,291/-.

Thus in case, the

petitioners make payment by 31.3.2008, they will be liable to pay
Rs.11,29,291/-. There may be slight variation depending upon the
size of the flat.
8. In view of the above facts and the statements made by learned counsel
for the parties, the following directions are issued:(i) DDA will make calculation and issue demand cum allotment
letters to the petitioners on the basis of calculation sheet
shown in the Court today, within 30 days. The petitioners will

be liable to pay interest @12% till the date when demand cum
allotment letter is issued and payment will be made in terms of
the payment Schedule mentioned in the demand cum
allotment letter.
(ii) DDA will be entitled to verify and examine genuineness of the
case of the petitioners.

The writ petitions are disposed of.
