This is a writ petition filed under Articles 226 and
227 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482
Cr.P.C. for setting aside the impugned order dated 8th
January, 2008 passed by the learned ASJ.
2.

Briefly stated the facts of the case are that

petitioner Nos. 1 and 2 are the parents of petitioner No. 3
Mr. Kunal Kapoor who got married with the complainant
Smt. Hardeep Kaur @ Shilpa on 30th January, 2006. After
about nine months of the marriage, the complainant made
a complaint before the CAW Cell, Delhi against the

WP(Crl.) 134/2008

petitioners and consequently, FIR No. 240/2007 was
registered under Sections 498A/406/34 IPC at PS Punjabi
Bagh.

Thereafter, the petitioners moved an application

for grant of anticipatory bail before the learned ASJ, Delhi.
On 15.05.2007, learned ASJ recorded that both the parties
have settled the matter and the applicants are ready to
pay Rs. 4,00,000/- to the complainant in lieu of dowry
articles, alimony, maintenance and all other compensation
etc. The statements of the parties were also recorded by
learned ASJ wherein it was mentioned that Rs. 1 lac would
be paid on 21.05.2007, Rs. 1.5 lacs would be paid at the
time of divorce by mutual consent and the remaining
amount of Rs. 1.5 lacs would be paid at the time of
quashing of the FIR. On these terms and conditions, the
petitioners were granted anticipatory bail.
3.

It is the admitted case of both the parties that the

petitioners have only paid Rs. 1 lac to the complainant by
way of a bank draft.

The complainant moved an

application for cancellation of bail as the petitioners had
failed to pay the remaining amount of Rs. 3 lacs to the
complainant. The said application was heard and decided
by the learned ASJ on 08.01.2008 and the anticipatory bail
granted to the petitioners was cancelled by learned ASJ
on the ground that the accused persons have not made
any payment nor they have filed the petition for divorce
by mutual consent.

4.

Now the petitioners have moved the present petition

for setting aside the impugned order dated 8.1.2008.
Admittedly, the petitioners have paid a sum of Rs. 1 lac to
the complainant.

It is mentioned in the order dated

15.5.2007 that the petitioners would pay Rs. 1.5 lacs at
the time of divorce by mutual consent and would pay the
balance amount of Rs. 1.5 lacs at the time of quashing of
the FIR. The petitioners have not filed the divorce petition
by mutual consent nor they have moved the petition for
quashing of the FIR.

So the question of payment of

remaining amount does not arise.

Simply because they

have not made the payment of Rs. 3 lacs to the
complainant,

the

anticipatory

bail

granted

to

the

petitioners cannot be cancelled. The order dated 8.1.2008
cancelling the anticipatory bail granted to the petitioners
is incorrect and the learned ASJ could not have passed
such an order.
5.

This Court places reliance on the judgment of the

Supreme Court in the case of Biman Chatterjee Vs.

Sanchita Chatterjee & Anr. (2004) 3 SCC 388, wherein it
was held as under:
“That apart, non-fulfilment of the terms of the
compromise cannot be the basis of granting or
cancelling a bail. The grant of bail under the
Criminal Procedure Code is governed by the
provision of Chapter XXXIII of the Code and
the provision therein does not contemplate
either granting of a bail on the basis of an
assurance of a compromise or cancellation of a
bail for violation of the terms of such
WP(Crl.) 134/2008

3

compromise. What the court has to bear in
mind while granting bail is what is provided
for in Section 437 of the said Code. In our
opinion, having granted the bail under the said
provision of law, it is not open to the trial
Court or the High Court to cancel the same on
a ground alien to the grounds mentioned for
cancellation of bail in the said provision of
law.”

6.

Keeping in view the Supreme Court judgment in

Biman Chatterjee’s case (supra) the writ petition is
allowed and the impugned order dated 8.1.2008 is set
aside.
7.

Writ petition stands disposed of.

8.

No costs.
