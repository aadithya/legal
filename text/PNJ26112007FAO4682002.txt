PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Heard for disposal.

2.

Union of India is aggrieved by the order passed by the

Railway

Claims

Tribunal

directing

Union

of

India

to

pay

Rs.1,40,562/- to the respondent together with interest thereon @
9% per annum.
3.

Claim was lodged by the respondent alleging that on

10.7.1994 it had booked 6 bundles of GRIP bars

(untwisted)

weighing 55.1 Mts for carriage by the railway from the siding at
Tata Nagar to Tuglakabad railway station and in respect thereof
page 1 of 4

railway receipt No.071798 was issued.

It was stated that when

the consignment reached Tuglakabad railway station, before
taking delivery a notice of re-weighment was given to the railway
authority by the respondent.

Railway Authorities refused to re-

weigh the consignment. The respondent went to an independent
agency namely PHD Chambers of Commerce & Industry with a
request that the consignment be re-weighed.

Surveyor was

appointed by PHD Chambers of Commerce & Industry.

He re-

weighed the consignment and detected it to be short by 10.850
MT.

At the trial respondent led evidence of K.P.Kapoor and

C.V.Vishwanathan

who successfully proved that when the

consignment was delivered to the railway authorities weighment
was witnessed by railway staff.

They also proved the notice

served upon the railway authorities being Ex.AW-2/1 asking for
re-weighment when good reached Tuglakabad.

The witnesses

also proved that the railway authorities refused to re-weigh the
consignment. The survey report of the surveyor was proved as
Ex.AW-3/1.
4.

The railway authorities disputed the liability stating

that the RR contained an inscription “said to contain”.

It was

urged that said notation on the RR shows that the weight noted in
the RR was as per discloser by the consignor and that there was
no proof that the consignment weighed 55.1 MT.
page 2 of 4

5.

The Tribunal has held that notation “said to contain”

relates to description
independent

column

of the goods and that there is an
under the caption “remarks” in the RR

wherein following has been noted : “Weighment witnessed by
railway staff”.
6.

Therefrom the Tribunal has opined that the notation

“said to contain” cannot relate to weighment of goods but relates
to the description thereof.
7.

Tribunal has therefore opined that since railway

authorities refused re-weighment of the consignment at point of
delivery the consignor had no option but to seek independent
weighment through a neutral surveyor.

Report Ex.AW-3/1 has

been accepted by the Tribunal as good evidence.
8.

Learned counsel for the appellant refers to a decision

of the Supreme Court reported as 1969 (3) SCC 112 Hari Sao &
Anr. Vs. The State of Bihar.
9.

I have perused the said decision. It hardly helps the

cause of the appellant.

The Supreme Court considered the

erstwhile Section 73 of the Railways Act.

The corresponding

provisions relatable to Section 93 of the Railways Act,1989.
10.

Suffice would it be to state that Supreme Court had

held that for loss or destruction of goods the railway authorities
can be relieved from the obligations only upon proof that they
page 3 of 4

used reasonable foresight and care in the carriage of the goods.
11.

I concur with the view taken by the Tribunal that the

notation “said to contain” in the RR relates to description of goods
and that the noting against the remarks column related to the
weighment being witnessed by the railway staff.
12.

The requirement of disclosing

account of

nature of goods is on

differential tariffs framed by the railway authority

pertaining to different kinds of goods.
13.

As regards the issue of quantity short delivered, suffice

would it be to state that the railway authority did not participate
in the joint measurement nor acceeded to the request of the
consignor to re-weigh the consignment. Thus, the survey report
of the independent surveyor i.e. Ex.AW-3/1 has to be accepted.
14.

I find no merits in the appeal. The appeal is dismissed.

15.

The amount, if any, lying in deposit in this court be

released in favour of the respondent forthwith.
16.

Record of the Tribunal be returned forthwith.
