V.B.Gupta, J.

By way of present writ petition, the petitioners
have

challenged

the

impugned

order

dated

2nd

November, 2007 passed under Section 279 of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short as „Act‟) passed by the
Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi-III, vide
which the petition filed by the present Petitioners for
compounding the offence under Section 271C(1)/277 of
the Act was rejected. It has been prayed in the present
writ

petition

that

this

Court

should

issue

writs/orders/directions in the nature of certiorari
quashing

the

W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

impugned

order

and

also

issue

Page 2 of 18

appropriate writs/orders/directions in the nature of
mandamus

directing

the

Respondent-Chief

Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi-III to pass final
orders for compounding the offence, subject to the
petitioners

depositing

the

composition

fee

of

Rs.3,98,830/- in terms of the Respondent‟s own order
dated 13th February, 2007.
2.

The brief facts leading to dispute are that the

petitioner company (which is a registered private
limited company and which since 1984 has stopped
functioning) filed its Income Tax Return on 16th
August, 1984, claiming a loss of Rs.69,402/-. The said
return was verified by petitioner No.2 in his capacity
as its Director. The return was accompanied by Profit
and Loss Account and Balance-sheet as on 30th June,
1982. In the P & L Account, the accused company
declared a gross income of Rs. 4, 01,775/- and claimed
expenses under various heads totaling Rs. 4, 71,177/-.

W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

Upon scrutiny, it was alleged by the Income Tax

Officer that the petitioner no. 1 had mis-declared a
sum of Rs. 11,00,000/- received as “sub commission”
for sales as “advances” against certain contracts
amounting to Rs. 7,33,334/-. The Income Tax Officer
summoned the petitioners and directed them to
produce

books

of

account,

receipts

and

other

documents. The books of account were produced and
examined by the Income Tax Officer (which he admits
in his cross-examination). Some other documents
demanded by him were also produced, but since on 3rd
January, 1986, the car in which the said documents,
including books of account, were lying was stolen from
the Connaught Place parking lot (the FIR lodged by the
petitioners was shown to the Income Tax Officer and
brought on record), the accused petitioner failed to
produce them again.
4.

Thereupon,

the

Income

Tax

Officer

passed

assessment orders adverse to the petitioner holding
the total income of the petitioner to be Rs. 10, 40,000/W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

Page 4 of 18

and disallowed the expenses claimed by the assesseepetitioner and filed a complaint for the assessment
year 1983-84 under sections 276C (1) & 277 of
Income Tax Act, on 23rd March, 1987 before the Court
of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi, against the
petitioners.
5.

The learned Trial Court vide judgment and order

dated 12rd March, 2003 convicted the petitioners and
sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for 6 months
as well as imposed a fine of Rs. 50,000/- on the
company and Rs. 20,000/- on the petitioners no. 2 & 3
separately. The fines have been paid in theTrial Court.
6.

Aggrieved thereby, the appeal preferred by the

petitioners before Additional District & Sessions Judge.
The appeal was rejected vide judgment and order
dated 23rd April, 2004, and sentence of rigorous
imprisonment for 6 months has been confirmed.
However, the fine of Rs. 50,000/- imposed on the
company has been cancelled.

On 24th April, 2004, petitioners preferred Criminal

Revision Petition challenging above said judgment and
order of the Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi, before
the High Court of Delhi, which is pending for final
disposal.
8.

The petitioners had deposited a sum of Rs.

14,63,028/- along with application for compounding
under section 279(2) of the Act, with the income tax
department on 27th April, 2004, as per the demand
raised

and

had

also

moved

an

application

for

compounding which is pending for disposal.
9.

While considering the above Criminal Revision

Petition, the Court issued the notice and on 28th April,
2004

after

hearing

both

the parties,

the Court

suspended the sentence of imprisonment and granted
bail to the petitioners till the next date of hearing.
Further, the income tax department sought time to
inform Court as to whether the Department was willing
to compound.

10. The department responded vide orders dated 11th
June, 2004 and 7th July, 2004 by directing the
petitioners to liquidate pending demand as a “prerequisite” condition for compounding of offences under
the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short as „Act‟).
11. On 18th November, 2004 the petitioners submitted
a detailed application to the Chief Commissioner of
Income Tax (for short as „CCIT‟) and again requested
to consider the application for compounding filed by
them.

1st

December,

2004

the

Addl.

Director of Income Tax(Pros) communicated the order
of the Central Board of Direct Taxes to the CCIT-III,
Delhi, wherein the Board directed the CCIT-III to
consider

the

compounding

application

of

the

petitioners on merits if the appellate or the revisional
court allows the accused to apply for the same.
14. Subsequent

to

the

above

said

order,

the

department asked the petitioners to seek clarifications
from the Court as to whether the Court was willing to
permit compounding of the offences. The Court vide
order/directions dated 14th February, 2005 issued
clarifications/further directions as:
“In case, it is necessary to make an express
opinion about the position in respect of the
petitioners‟ right to compound the offence,
it is clarified that the pendency of the
criminal revision of this Court will not stand
as a bar for compounding the offence. It is
also clarified that the Income Tax
Department or authorities‟ under the
Income Tax Act will be entirely at liberty to

W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

Page 8 of 18

consider the application for compounding
according to its merit.”

15. Pursuant to the above directions, the petitioners
made representations dated 21rd March, 2005, in
response to which the office of CCIT-III dated 24th
October, 2005, directed the petitioners to pay the
outstanding demand forthwith before the application
for compounding could be considered.
16. Finally, vide two separate orders No. 686 & 687
dated 30th June, 2006 and 07th July, 2006, the office of
the CCIT-III, Delhi directed the petitioners to deposit a
penalty sum of Rs. 11,83,103 (u/s. 273A (4A) of the
Income Tax Act), and interest sum of Rs. 8,00,000/(total sum of Rs. 19,83,103/-).
17. Pursuant

to

these

directions

the

petitioners

deposited the above said amount. Vide application
dated 14th July, 2006 requested the CCIT-III to pass the
order for compounding of the offences u/s. 279(2).

W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

Page 9 of 18

18. Vide letter/order dated 13th February, 2007, the
office

of

the

CCIT-III

issued

to

the

petitioner,

composition fee for compounding the offence was
quantified by the department at Rs. 3,98,830/-, and the
petitioner was directed to convey his willingness to pay
the composition fee. Immediately on 15th February,
2007, the petitioner communicated his “willingness”.
19. A communication dated 2nd November, 2007 was
sent to petitioners stating that since the Central Board
of Direct Taxes has rejected the application for
compounding,

hence

the

CCIT

is

rejecting

the

application of the petitioners for compounding.
20. Aggrieved thereby, the petitioners have filed the
present petition under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India read with section 151 CPC for issuance of
appropriate writs/orders/directions in the nature of
Certiorari quashing the impugned order dated 2nd
November, 2007 and for Mandamus directing the
Income Tax Department to pass final orders for

W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

Page 10 of 18

compounding the offence, subject to the petitioners
depositing the composition fee of Rs. 3, 98, 830/- in
terms of the respondent‟s own order dated 13th
February, 2007.
21. Thus, the question arises for determination in the
present petition is, “Whether the Central Board of
Direct Taxes can issue instructions to control the
discretion of the Commissioner of Income-tax under
Section 279(2) of the Act, to compound the offences?‟
22. It has been contended by the petitioner that the
power to compound an offence is specifically vested in
the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax under Section
279 (2) of the Act, who alone has the discretion to
accept or reject. The Board is only invested with the
authority to issue general directions or instructions or
devise a policy decision with regard to composition of
offences.

CCIT

had

already

determined

the

composition fee at Rs. 3, 98,830/- and thus, the
rejection of the application, at the sole instance of the

W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

Page 11 of 18

Board

without

any

reason,

is

wholly

arbitrary,

unreasonable, unjust. It is further submitted that the
petitioners fulfilled all the necessary pre-requisite
conditions for compounding. The impugned order is hit
by doctrine of estoppel and legitimate expectation,
therefore, the Board as well as the CCIT is clearly
stopped from turning around, in a volte face, and
rejecting the application.
23. It is relevant to note here the relevant provisions
of the law. Section 279(1) of the Act lays down “A
person shall not be proceeded against for an offence
under Sections 275A, 276A, 276B, 276C, 276D, 277,
278 or Section 278A except at the instance of the
Commissioner”.
24. Section 279 (2) of the Act lays down “Any offence
under this Chapter may, either before or after the
institution of proceedings, be compounded by the Chief
Commissioner or a Director General.”

W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

Page 12 of 18

25. The Finance (No.2) Act, 1991, has inserted an
Explanation giving it retrospective operation with
effect from April 1, 1962, which reads as under:
“For the removal of doubts, it is hereby
declared that the power of the Board to
issue orders, instructions or directions
under this Act shall include and shall be
deemed always to have included the power
to issue instructions or directions (including
instructions or directions to obtain the
previous approval of the Board) to other
income-tax authorities for the proper
composition of offences under this section.”

26. As held by this Court in Dr. K.JagaDessan v.
Central Board of Direct Taxes and others (1998)
231 ITR 755 (Delhi):“The background in which the Explanation
above said came to be appended to section
279 is not clear. However, the very language
employed in explanation reveals that the
amendment is clarificatory and declaratory
in nature. Some doubts must have been
expressed if the power of the Board to issue
orders, instructions, or directions under the
Act (obviously referable to section 119 (1) of
the Act), included the power to issue
instructions or directions for the proper
composition of offences under section 279.
The doubts have been removed by declaring
that such power was so included and thereby
W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

Page 13 of 18

setting at rest the doubts, if any. The
Explanation is thus in the nature of a proviso
to Section 279(2) as held in Y.P.Chawla v.
M.P.Tiwari (1992) 195 ITR 607 (SC) and
has also to be read as clarificatory and
declaratory of the scope of the power of the
CBTD emanating from section 119 of the
Act.”

27. As held in M.P. Purusothaman and Ors. v.
Assistant Director of Income Tax (Prosecution)
and Ors., (2001) 252 ITR (Mad.):“ The prosecution once launched is to
continue before the Court in which the
prosecution was initiated and in which the
accused would have all the protection
available to him under the ordinary law of
the land. The provision permitting the
compounding of the offence and thereby
bringing the prosecution to an end is a
provision which vests a discretion in the
authority at a high level, namely, the Chief
Commissioner or the Director-General who
may act only after securing the prior
approval of the Central Board. The
provisions requiring the consideration of
any proposal for compounding at that level
would indicate that it is not the policy of the
law to permit compounding as a matter of
course but that the compounding would be
permitted
only
where
the
Chief
Commissioner or the Director-General and
also the Central Board are of the view that
the facts and circumstances of the case are

W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

permitted”.

Board of Direct Taxes has rejected the application for

Tax

application

of

of
the

petitioners for compounding. Reading section 279 (2)
of the Act along with the Explanation, there is no
manner of doubt that the Commissioner has to exercise
the discretion in conformity with the instructions
issued by the Board from time to time. Therefore, the
contention taken by the petitioners is not acceptable.
29. Further,

Section

119(1)

of

the

Act

which

empowers the Board to issue orders, instructions and
directions for the proper administration of the Act is
reproduced hereunder:
(1) The Board may, from time to time, issue
such orders, instructions and directions to
other income-tax authorities as it may deem
fit for the proper administration of this Act,
and such authorities and all other persons
employed in the execution of this Act shall
W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

Page 15 of 18

observe and follow such orders, instructions
and directions of the Board:
Provided that no such orders, instructions of
directions shall be issued(a) so as to require any income-tax authority
to make a particular assessment or to dispose
of a particular case in a particular manner; or
(b) so as to interfere with the discretion of
the Deputy Commissioner (Appeals) or the
Commissioner (Appeals) in the exercise of his
appellate functions.

30. The Board issued instruction No. 1317 dated
March 11, 1980 under Section 119(1) of the Act
providing guidelines for the exercise of power under
Section 279(2) of the Act. The relevant part of the
instructions is as under:
B. CASES WHICH
COMPOUNDED:

SHOULD

NOT

BE

1. No compounding will be done if the
assessee belongs to a monopoly or large
industrial house or is a director of a company
belonging to or controlled by such house.
2. Cases in which the prospects of a
successful prosecution are good should not
ordinarily be compounded.

W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

Page 16 of 18

3. Compounding will not be done in case of
second and sub-sequent offices.

31. From the perusal of section 119(1) of the Act, it is
clear that the section provides in unmistakable terms,
that

every

officer

and

person

employed

in

the

execution of the Act shall observe and follow the
orders, instructions and directions of the Board.
Circulars issued by the Board are generally binding on
officers and persons employed in the execution of the
Act.
32. From the perusal of Sections 276C & 277 of the
Act, it is clearly evident that the prosecution is
required

to

establish

that

the

accused

willfully

attempted in any manner, to evade any tax penalty or
interest chargeable or imposable under the Act. It is
also culled out from the provisions of Section 277 of
the Act that the prosecution is required to establish
that the accused made a statement in any verification

W.P.(C) No.2848/2008

Page 17 of 18

under the Act, which he either knows or believes to be
false or does not believe to be true.
33. In the present case, the petitioners are the
directors of the company and the prosecution before
Additional Sessions Judge has successfully established
that there was an act of concealment on the part of the
petitioner and had filed its return by concealing facts.
Therefore, it is a clear case of well thought out
strategy of tax evasion.
34. In view of the above discussion, the present
petition is, hereby, dismissed.
