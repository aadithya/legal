BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.

The learned counsel for the respondents in each of these matters

has entered appearance after noting the same in the cause list. She states that
she is ready to argue the matter on the papers already filed.

2.

These eight petitions have been filed under Section 34 of the

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the said
Act) challenging separate awards but all dated 31.10.2006 passed by the
same sole arbitrator Mr R.S. Jindal. The objections taken in respect of the
awards (which are more or less identical) are the same and it is for this
reason that this batch of petitions is being disposed of by this common
order.

3.

These cases have had a chequered history and, therefore, it

would be necessary to set out some facts. Certain disputes had arisen
between the parties.

Notices were issued by the respondents to the

petitioner invoking the arbitration clause (clause 25) and seeking the
appointment of a sole arbitrator in terms thereof. No response was received
by the respondents and consequently the respondents filed petitions under
Section 11 of the said Act for appointment of arbitrators. These petitions
OMP 48/08,50/08,51/08,52/08,54/08,55/08,56/08,57/08

Page No.2 of 14

came up before the learned Civil Judge who disposed of the same by an
order dated 30.07.2003. The learned Single Judge was of the view that the
respondents had accepted payments made by the petitioner after the
issuance of the final bill and, therefore, there remained no arbitratral
dispute. The learned Civil Judge had also considered the arbitration clause
which stipulated that if no claim is made within 90 days of the bill being
ready for payment then the contractor would be deemed to have waived his
claims and would be absolutely barred from raising any such claim and the
petitioner would be discharged and released of all liabilities under the
contract. According to the learned Civil Judge, since the respondent had
not made the claim within the said stipulated period, no dispute survived
and, therefore, there was no question of invoking the arbitration clause.
Consequently, the learned Civil Judge dismissed the petitions filed on
behalf of the respondents for appointment of an arbitrator. Being aggrieved,
the respondents herein filed several writ petitions before this court. Those
writ petitions were disposed of by a common order dated 07.02.2005 passed
in WP(C)6209/2003 and other connected matters. The Division Bench was
of the view that the learned Civil Judge, being a designated authority under
Section 11(6) of the said Act, exercises administrative powers and not
judicial powers.

This statement of law was obviously based on the

understanding as was then current in view of the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of M/s Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd and Another v
M/s Rani Construction P Ltd : AIR 2002 SCC 778.

OMP 48/08,50/08,51/08,52/08,54/08,55/08,56/08,57/08

4.

The Division Bench also concluded that the learned Civil Judge

had assumed jurisdiction which was not vested in him inasmuch as he had
given a decision on merits and had also decided the issue on the question of
limitation. Consequently, the Division Bench set aside the order dated
30.07.2003 passed by the learned Civil Judge and appointed Mr R.S. Jindal,
retired Chief Engineer of DDA as the sole arbitrator to decide the disputes
between the parties. The petitioner herein, being aggrieved of the said
decision of the Division Bench, filed Special Leave Petitions before the
Supreme Court. During the pendency of the said Special Leave Petitions,
the arbitrator proceeded with the arbitration and concluded the same by
making the impugned awards dated 31.10.2006. On 05.01.2007, the Special
Leave Petitions came up for consideration before the Supreme Court
whereupon the Supreme Court granted leave and, in view of the decision
rendered by the Constitution Bench in SBP & Co. v Patel Engineering Ltd
& another : 2005(8) SCC 618, set aside the order of the Division Bench
dated 07.02.2005 and remitted the matter to the High Court for a fresh
decision in the light of the judgment of the Constitution Bench. It would be
relevant to note that when the Supreme Court passed the order dated
05.01.2007, the Supreme Court was apparently not informed of the making
of the awards in the meanwhile.

5.

When the writ petitions were again taken up before the Division

Bench, on remand from the Supreme court, various issues were examined.

OMP 48/08,50/08,51/08,52/08,54/08,55/08,56/08,57/08

Page No.4 of 14

Ultimately, the Division Bench disposed of the writ petitions by a common
judgment and order dated 20.09.2007. The Division Bench, by virtue of its
order dated 20.09.2007, considered the stipulation with regard to the claim
being made within 90 days as contained in the arbitration clause between
the parties. After considering several decisions of the Supreme Court as
well as the provisions of Section 28 of the Contract Act, 1872, the Division
Bench observed as under :
“Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and in
view of Section 28 of the Contract Act, we are of the
considered opinion that it could not be appropriate to hold
that the right of the petitioners to demand arbitration in
respect of claims raised, stands extinguished and the
respondent-Municipal Corporation of Delhi is discharged
and released from all its liabilities as the said claims were
not made within the period of 90 days from the date of
intimation about the final bill. The clause relied upon by
the respondent-MCD is void and hit by Section 28 of the
Contract Act. No other contention or ground was raised to
support the contention that the application under Section 11
of the Act is barred by limitation.”
6.

The net result being that the Division Bench was of the view that

the finding of the learned Civil Judge with regard to the stipulation of 90
days coming in the way of the respondents was not the correct position in
law.

7.

The Division Bench thereafter disposed of the writ petitions by

permitting the petitioner herein to file objections to the awards under
Section 34 of the said Act. It is in these circumstances that the present
petitions have been filed.

8.

The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner

submitted, first of all, that de hors the question of limitation with regard to
the said clause containing the stipulation of 90 days, which issue had been
decided by the Division Bench, the petitioner still had the preliminary
objections that there could not be any reference to arbitration in terms of
clause 25 inasmuch as the procedure prescribed for invoking the said
arbitration had not been followed by the respondents. To appreciate this
submission, it would be necessary to examine clause 25. The same reads as
under :
“Statement of Disputes & Arbitration
Except where otherwise provided in the contract
all questions and disputes relating to the meaning of the
specifications, design, drawings and instructions here-inbefore mentioned and as to the quality of workmanship or
materials as used on the work or as to any other question,
claim, right, matter or thing whatsoever in any way arising
out of or relating to the contract, designs, drawings,
specifications, estimates, instructions, orders or these
conditions or otherwise concerning the works or the
execution or failure to execute the same whether arising
during the progress of the work or after the cancellation,
termination , completion or abandonment thereof shall be
dealt with as mentioned hereinafter :
(i)
if the contractor considers any work
demanded of him to be outside the requirements of
the contract, or disputes any drawings, record or
design given in writing by the Engineer-in-charge on
any matter in connection with or arising out of the
contract of carrying out of the work, to be
unacceptable, he shall promptly within 15 days
requested the superintending Engineer in writing for
written instruction or decision. Thereupon, the
Superintending Engineer shall give his written
instructions or decision within a period of one month
from the receipt of the contractor's letter.
OMP 48/08,50/08,51/08,52/08,54/08,55/08,56/08,57/08

Page No.6 of 14

If the Superintending Engineer fails to give
his instructions or decision in writing within the
aforesaid period or if the contractor is dissatisfied
with the instructions of decision of the
Superintending Engineer, the contractor may, within
15 days of the receipt of Superintending Engineer's
decision, appeal to the Chief Engineer who shall
afford an opportunity to the contractor to be heard, if
the latter so desires, and to offer evidence in support
of his appeal. The Chief Engineer shall give his
decision within 30 days of receipt of contractors
appeal. If the contractor is dissatisfied with the
decision, the contractor shall within a period of 30
days from receipt of the decision, give notice to the
Commissioner MCD for appointment of arbitrator
failing which the said decision shall be final binding
and conclusive and not referable to adjudication by
the arbitrator.
(ii)
Except where the decision has become final
binding and conclusive in terms of Sub para (i) above
disputes or difference shall be referred for
adjudication through arbitration and sole arbitrator
appointed by the Commissioner MCD.
If the
arbitrator so appointed is unable or unwilling to act or
resigns his appointment or vacate his office due to
any reason whatsoever another sole arbitrator shall be
appointed in the manner aforesaid. Such person shall
be entitled to proceed with the reference from the
stage at which it was left by his predecessor.
It is a term of this contract that the party invoking arbitration
shall give a list of disputes with amounts claimed in respect
of each such dispute along with the notice for appointment
of arbitrator and giving reference to the rejection by the
Chief Engineer of the appeal.
It is also a term of this contractor that no person other than a
person appointed by such Commissioner MCD as aforesaid
should act as arbitrator and if for any reason that is no
possible, the matter shall not be referred to arbitration at all.
It is also a term of this contract that if the contractor does
not make any demand for appointment of arbitrator in
respect of any claims in writing as aforesaid within 120 days
of receiving the intimation from the Engineer-in-charge that
OMP 48/08,50/08,51/08,52/08,54/08,55/08,56/08,57/08

Page No.7 of 14

the final bill is ready for payment, the claim of the contractor
shall be deemed to have been waived and absolutely barred
and the MCD shall be discharged and released of all
liabilities under the contract in respect of these claims.”
9.

It is the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that

the Superintending Engineer is required to be requested for written
instructions within 15 days of any dispute arising under the contract.
Thereafter, The Superintending Engineer is required to give his written
instructions or decision within the period of one month from the receipt of
the contractor's letter. The clause speaks of further steps to be taken and an
appeal to the Chief Engineer is also provided for. It is only after following
the said procedure that, if the contractor is dissatisfied with the decision of
the Chief Engineer, a notice can be given to the Commissioner MCD for
appointment of the arbitrator.

10.

The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that since this

procedure was admittedly not followed, therefore, the question of
appointment of an arbitrator and going in for arbitration did not at all arise
and the entire proceeding, including the impugned awards, are liable to be
set aside on this ground alone. This issue was raised before the learned
arbitrator who, inter alia, held :
“Even otherwise also the claims made by the claimant are
outside the preview of the said procedure. As per the said
procedure only those disputes/claims wherein works
demanded of the claimant were outside the requirements of
the contract or which disputed the drawings, records or
decision given in writing by the Engineer-in-charge were
OMP 48/08,50/08,51/08,52/08,54/08,55/08,56/08,57/08

Page No.8 of 14

required to be referred to the Supdg Engineer by the
claimant for decision and were ultimately arbitrable if the
claimant was not satisfied with the decisions of the Supdg
Engineer/Chief Engineer. However, the claims raised by the
claimant
in
the
present
case
pertain
to
compensation/damages on account of the idle establishment,
tools & plants, pre-suit, pendentlite and future interest and
cost of arbitration proceedings which apparently do not fall
in the category of disputes required to be referred to the
Supdg Engineer for decision.”
11.

I agree with the conclusion arrived at by the learned arbitrator.

The procedure for requesting the Superintending Engineer etc is applicable
only when the contractor considers any work demanded of him to be outside
the requirements of the contract or where the contractor disputes any
drawings, record or design given in writing by the Engineer-in-charge on
any matter in connection with or arising out of the contract or carrying out
of the work to be unacceptable. The dispute in the present case does not fall
within these parameters.

Consequently, the same would have to be

construed as a dispute falling within sub para (ii) of clause 25 of the
agreement and the dispute would be straightaway referable for adjudication
through arbitration by a sole arbitrator to be appointed by the Commissioner
MCD. This is exactly what the respondents had sought to be done by
issuing the invocation letters to the petitioner which had gone unresponded.
Left with no alternative, the respondents had approached the court under
Section 11 for appointment of arbitrators. The appointments were made and
ultimately

the awards have been passed.

Therefore, this preliminary

objection raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is not tenable.

OMP 48/08,50/08,51/08,52/08,54/08,55/08,56/08,57/08

Page No.9 of 14

12.

All the impugned awards relate to the grant of interest on

delayed payments after raising of the final bills in terms of the final bills
themselves. In some of the awards, impugned herein, the respondents had
made claims towards idle establishment but all such claims have been
rejected by the learned arbitrator. The learned arbitrator has only awarded
interest on the delayed payments of the final bill amounts as well as interest
on the delayed payments of security deposits. The learned arbitrator had
also awarded costs of Rs 15,000/- in each of the cases in favour of the
respondents and against the petitioner.

13.

Insofar as the findings of the learned Arbitrator qua rejection of

the claims towards idle establishment is concerned, the same are accepted
by both the petitioner and the respondents. The only dispute that is sought
to be raised by the petitioner is with regard to the award on interest and the
costs.

According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the rate of

interest of 12% per annum is exhorbitant and the rate of interest ought to
have been around 6% per annum. The second contention is that the learned
Arbitrator had awarded interest on interest which is not permissible. It is
also contended that the learned arbitrator has awarded interest on the
security deposit amounts when there was no such stipulation in the contract.
Finally, it is contended that the costs of Rs 15,000/- awarded in each of the
matters is exhorbitant.

With regard to the rate of interest, the learned

counsel for the petitioner had contended that the contractors are aware of

OMP 48/08,50/08,51/08,52/08,54/08,55/08,56/08,57/08

Page No.10 of 14

the practice of delayed payments and, therefore, keeping that fact in mind
they quoted their rates in the tender. Consequently, the interest rate of 12%
was exhorbitant keeping in view this reality.

14.

As regards the rate of interest, it must be pointed out that the

respondents had claimed 18% per annum. The learned counsel for the
respondents submitted that that is the rate which is also prescribed under
Section 31(7) of the said Act which would be operative in case there is no
agreement to the contrary. In any event, the learned arbitrator did not grant
18% per annum interest but granted the lower rate of 12% per annum on the
ground that the commercial rate of simple interest as charged

by the

nationalised banks has not been less than 12% per annum. It is on this basis
that the learned arbitrator awarded simple interest @ 12% per annum after
considering it to be a reasonable rate in respect of the present case. Nothing
contrary was pointed out before the learned arbitrator or before this court.
Consequently, I do not see any reason to interfere with this finding and
conclusion of the learned arbitrator.

15.

The next issue is with regard to the question of interest being

charged on interest. As an illustration, the facts in OMP 48/2008 are being
taken. The arbitrator has, in that case, awarded interest as indicated below :
“So the total amount of interest under this claim as
payable by the respondent to the claimant till the date of
this award (31st Oct, 2006) comes to :-

OMP 48/08,50/08,51/08,52/08,54/08,55/08,56/08,57/08

Page No.11 of 14

Interest on Rs 1,15,647/- from 25.03.2000 = Rs 50,556/to 17.11.2003 @ 12% per annum
Interest on Rs 50,556/- from 18.11.03 to = Rs 17,903/31.10.2006 @ 12% per annum
Interest on Rs 18,740/- from 25.8.2000 to = Rs 10,859/24.6.05 @ 12% per annum
Interest on Rs 10868/- from 25.6.05 to = Rs
31.10.2006 @12% per annum
Total

1,758/-

Rs 81076/-

So a total amount of Rs 81,076/- is awarded to the
claimant as interest on delayed payments and as pre-suit
& pendente lite interest upto the date of this award.”
16.

The computation given above shows that interest is being given

on Rs 1,15,647/- being the principal amount due under the final bill. The
interest has been calculated for the period from 25.03.2000 to 17.11.2003.
The date of 25.03.2000 has been taken because it is one month subsequent
to the issuance of the final bill or in other words the date on which the bill
ought to have been paid. The date of 17.11.2003 has been taken because it
is on that date that a sum of Rs 1,15,647/- was paid by the petitioner to the
respondents.

The interest for this duration has been computed on Rs

1,15,647/-. The second calculation is with regard to the interest on the sum
of Rs 50,556/- from 18.11.2003 to 31.10.2006 (i.e. the date of the award).
The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the interest amount of
Rs 17,903/- on the amount of Rs 50,556/- cannot be awarded as that would
amount to granting interest on interest. I am unable to agree with this
contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner. This is so because on

OMP 48/08,50/08,51/08,52/08,54/08,55/08,56/08,57/08

Page No.12 of 14

17.11.2003 an amount of Rs 1,66,203 had become due towards principal
(Rs 1,15,647) and interest (Rs 50,556/-). The payment of Rs 1,15,647/- on
17.11.2003 would first be appropriated towards interest due and the balance
would have to be appropriated from the principal. Since, the interest due
was less than the payment made, a part of the payment made would also be
appropriated against the principal amount due. Therefore, the payment of
Rs 1,15,647/- on 17.11.2003, completely exhausted the interest due as on
that date as also part of the principal which was due. The balance amount of
Rs 50,556/- cannot be regarded as interest but as portion of the principal
which was initially due. Therefore, the petitioner's contention that interest
being charged on this amount of Rs 50,556/- would be interest on interest is
not tenable.

The same reasoning would apply for the computation of

interest of Rs 1,758/- in respect of the security deposit amount.

17.

As aforesaid, the learned counsel for the petitioner had also

raised the issue of interest on the refund of the security deposit. According
to her, there is no provision in the contract for providing any interest on the
said amount.

The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that

security deposits were refundable within the period of six months and no
interest was being charged for that duration of six months. However, as the
security deposit amounts were refunded beyond the period of six months,
therefore, the same were subject to payment of interest. It is clear that there
is no provision for interest being paid on the security deposit amounts.

OMP 48/08,50/08,51/08,52/08,54/08,55/08,56/08,57/08

Page No.13 of 14

However, there is also no provision prohibiting any such payment. When
the contract stipulates that the security deposit is to be refunded within six
months of the completion of work then the petitioner ought to have
refunded the same within the stipulated period. If the petitioner retained the
same beyond the period of six months then the petitioner would in normal
circumstances be liable to pay interest thereon for the retention of the said
amount beyond the period of the contract. I see no infirmity in the award
insofar as the interest being paid on the retention of the security deposits
beyond the period of six months till the date of payment. Consequently,
this contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is also not
acceptable.

18.

As regards costs, there is no material before me to take a view

either way as to whether the costs are exhorbitant or they are not. The
arbitrator has awarded a sum of Rs 15,000/- by way of costs in each of the
cases. I see no reason to interfere with this finding.
As a result of the foregoing discussion, these petitions are
dismissed.
