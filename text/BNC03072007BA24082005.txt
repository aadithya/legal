The petitioner is an accused facing trial
alongwith

his

co-accused

in

a

case

FIR

No.253/2001, under Sections 302/307/34 IPC and
Section 27 Arms Act, PS Parliament Street, relating to

Bail Application No. 2408/2005

murder of Smt.Phoolan Devi, a Member of Parliament
(Lok Sabha) which took place on 25th July, 2001
around 1.30 p.m.
2.

The petitioner, an arms dealer, allegedly sold
an unlicensed .32 bore webley scot revolver

and

cartridges to his co-accused Sher Singh Rana which
were used by his co-accused Dhan Prakash in
commission of murder of Smt. Phoolan Devi.

The

petitioner was arrested on 2nd August, 2001 being a
party to the criminal conspiracy hatched to commit
murder of Smt. Phoolan Devi.
3.

Pleading for bail, learned counsel for the
petitioner argued that according to prosecution, the
petitioner had supplied a revolver and cartridges to
his co-accused Sher Singh Rana in the presence of
one Afaq Ahmed—PW-70, an employee of petitioner at
his gun shop. Learned counsel contended that in his
entire statement before the Trial Court, PW Afaq

Ahmed did not support the prosecution case in regard
to alleged supply of the revolver and cartridges to coaccused

Sher

Singh

Rana

by

the

petitioner.

According to the learned counsel, PW Afaq Ahmed
being the solitary witness, there is none else to
support the prosecution case in regard to alleged
supply of the revolver and cartridges to co-accused
Sher Singh Rana by the petitioner. It was argued that
the petitioner continues in custody ever since the date
of arrest, i.e., 2nd August, 2001 and as out of 172
prosecution witnesses, only 86 PWs have been
examined so far, it is unlikely that the trial would be
concluded in near future.
that since the only

Learned counsel argued

witness Afaq Ahmed—PW, who

could have deposed against the petitioner, has
already been examined, there is no possibility of
petitioner tampering with evidence in case of his
release on bail during the pendency of the trial.

Opposing the bail plea, learned Additional
Public Prosecutor submitted that though Afaq AhmedPW did not depose before the Court in terms of his
statement under Section 161 CrPC and omitted to
state that the petitioner had supplied the revolver and
cartridges to his co-accused Sher Singh Rana in his
presence, missed calls to co-accused Sher Singh
Rana,

after

the

incident,

being

traced

to

the

petitioner's mobile phone, clearly show his nexus with
the said co-accused. On the count of delay in
concluding trial, it was pointed out that since one of
the co-accused Shravan had been absconding

and

could be arrested on 4th July, 2004 and later another
co-accused Sher Singh Rana managed to escape from
jail custody on 17th February, 2004 and could be rearrested on 24th April, 2006 only, pace of the trial was
retarded to a great extent.
5.

A Status Report, regarding progress of trial,

Bail Application No. 2408/2005

Page 4 of 6

was called from the Trial Court which indicates that
out of 172 witnesses, statements of 86 prosecution
witnesses had been recorded by 15th May, 2007. It is
gathered that on a previous occasion while dismissing
the bail applications of co-accused, a direction was
issued to expedite the trial. It appears that inspite of
such direction, the trial has not yet reached half way
mark in terms of number of witnesses still left to be
examined.
6.

No doubt Afaq Ahmed—PW, the sole witness to
alleged supply of revolver and cartridges by the
petitioner to co-accused Sher Singh Rana, is found to
have deviated from his statement under Section 161
CrPC

while

deposing

before

the

Trial

Court,

evidentiary value of his testimony is yet to be
evaluated in conjunction with other evidence, if any,
brought forth by the prosecution which exercise is
better left to the Trial Court. There being accusation

of the petitioner being a party to the alleged criminal
conspiracy,

entire

prosecution

evidence

to

be

produced is to be kept in view to find the extent of
complicity, if any, of the petitioner in the commission
of the crime. The release of the petitioner on bail in
the midst of trial when more than half the number of
prosecution witnesses are yet to be examined would
undoubtedly operate to the detriment of a fair trial.
Hence, the bail plea of the petitioner cannot be
granted.
7.

The

petition

is,

in

the

circumstances,

dismissed. While doing so, it is once again impressed
upon the Trial Court to endeavour in right earnest to
conclude the trial expeditiously without undue loss of
further time.
