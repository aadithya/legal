PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

I would be referring to the respondent as the plaintiff. I

would be referring to the appellant as the defendant.
2.

Alleging that the defendant was a tenant in respect of

the suit premises bearing No.1/9559,

Gali No.2, Pratap Pura,

West Rohtash Nagar, Shahdara and that the defendant was a
tenant under an oral lease at a monthly rent of Rs.1500/- and that
the tenancy was determined, suit was filed for ejectment and
mesne

profits.

Prayer made in the suit was to grant

damages from 7.2.2004 to 6.7.2004 and future mesne profits till
ejectment. Defendant opposed the suit inter alia pleading that
the suit property was governed by the provisions of the Delhi Rent
page 1 of 6

Control Act.

Since admitted rent was less than Rs.3500/-, civil

court had no jurisdiction to entertain the plaint.
3.

On the pleadings of the parties 5 issues were framed

relating to the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain the plaint
and the entitlement of the plaintiff for a decree of ejectment as
also mesne profits.
4.

At the trial, to prove whether the suit property was

governed by the Delhi Rent Control Act, PW-1, Anil Kumar, Halqa
Patwari appeared.

He proved that Shahdara and Village Uldhan

Pur formed separate revenue estates.
5.

It being not in dispute between the parties that the suit

property was on land falling in the erstwhile revenue estate of
Village Uldhan Pur, learned Trial Judge opined that by virtue of
proviso to Sub-Section (2) of Section 1 of the Delhi Rent Control
Act, 1958 there being no notification under the Delhi Rent Control
Act extending the said Act to the revenue estate of Village Uldhan
Pur, civil court had jurisdiction to entertain the plaint.
issue of determination of the lease, plaintiff

On the

proved notice Ex.

PW1/3 and the postal receipt under which notice was posted
being PW1/4 as also acknowledgment card evidencing service of
EX.PW1/3 upon the defendant.

Acknowledgment card was

exhibited as Ex. PW1/8.

Plea of the defendant was that vide order dated Ex.

PW1/11 issued by the DCP, Delhi he was externed for a period of
6 months with effect from 11.11.2003 from the Union of Territory
of Delhi.

That the termination notice Ex. PW1/3 being dated

12.5.2004 he could not have received the same.
7.

In view of the testimony of PW-1 a finding was returned

that the suit was maintainable.

Notwithstanding Ex. PW1/3,

PW1/4 and PW1/8 learned Trial Judge held that there was no valid
determination of the lease.
passed.

Yet in spite thereof decree was

Mesne profits were awarded with effect from May,

2001.
8.

The defendant filed a first appeal registered as Appeal

N.11/2007.

The same has been dismissed

by the learned

Appellate Judge.
9.

It is urged in the second appeal that the area in

question is governed by the Delhi Rent

Control Act, 1958 and

that there is no valid determination of the lease. Lastly it is urged
that mesne profits could not have been awarded

prior to

7.2.2004 for the reason there was no prayer made in the suit for
grant of mesne profits prior to 7.2.2004.
10.

Pertaining to the first contention, suffice would it be to

state that the testimony of PW-1 clearly brings out that Village
Uldhan Pur forms a separate revenue estate and Shahdara forms
a separate revenue estate. The testimony further brings out that
page 3 of 6

the revenue estate of Shahdara included certain villages but
excluded Village Uldhan Pur.

The notification extending Delhi

Rent Control Act to the revenue estate of Village Shahdara,
though not formally brought on record, in any case excludes
Village Uldhan Pur.

There exists no notification extending the

provisions of the Delhi Rent Control Act to Village Uldhan Pur.
Thus, the view taken by the learned Trial Judge and the first
Appellate Judge on the issue of applicability of Delhi Rent Control
Act, 1958 is correct.
11.

On the issue of determination of the lease, as noted

above plaintiff proved the notice of determination being the
notice dated 12.5.2004 as Ex.PW1/3.

Postal receipt under which

the notice was posted was proved as Ex.PW1/4. Acknowledgment
card was proved as Ex. PW1/8. Learned Trial Judge has discussed
the 3 documents in para 14. The discussion reads as under :-

12.

“14. The defendant admitted
that the
acknowledgment due (Ex.PW1/8) bears the
correct address of the shop. There is no
written lease deed between the parties. In
the absence of contract, in view of the
provisions of section 106 of Transfer of
Property Act, 1992, the tenancy of the
defendant shall be deemed to be a lease from
month to month, terminable, on the part of
either lessor or lessee by 15 days notice. In
these circumstances, the plaintiff has not
successful in proving that the lease of the
defendant has been terminated.”
The finding of the learned Trial Judge is not happily

worded.

On the one hand learned Judge has noted that the

page 4 of 6

defendant admitted that the acknowledgment card Ex. PW1/8
bears the correct address of his shop. Yet in spite thereof a
finding has been returned that the plaintiff has not successfully
proved the termination of the lease.
13.

As noted above in spite thereof suit has been decreed.

14.

The learned Appellate Judge has discussed, once again

in para 14 of the decision of the Appellate Court, the impact of the
A.D. card and has returned a finding that the plaintiff succeeded
in establishing that the lease was determined.
15.

The view taken by the Appellate Judge is correct. The

discussion on the subject by the learned Trial Judge is fairly
inchoate.
16.

The plea raised by the appellant that there is no valid

determination of the lease is accordingly without any basis.
17.

The

last

plea

taken

by

the

appellant

needs

consideration for the reason in the plaint claim for mesne profits
was restricted with effect from 7.2.2004.

Court fee was paid

accordingly. In spite thereof, both courts have awarded mesne
profits with effect from May, 2001.
18.

Following substantial question of law is framed :-

(A)

Whether in view of the pleadings in the plaint, the

courts below were justified in awarding mesne profits to the
plaintiff with effect from May, 2001 till 7.2.2004?

19.

Since a short question arises for consideration appeal

is not being formally admitted. It can be disposed of at the After
Notice Miscellaneous stage.
20.

Issue notice to the respondent by ordinary process and

registered AD post returnable for 18.1.2008.
CM No.15934/2007

CM No.15931/2007
