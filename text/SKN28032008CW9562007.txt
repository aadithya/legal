ORDER
28.03.2008

Delhi Administration by letter dated 19th February, 1997 had

recommended allotment of a plot measuring 150 square yards to
Mr.Dharam Singh, the petitioner herein, in lieu of his land acquired way
back in 1986. Pursuant to the recommendation, DDA by their letter dated
28th December, 1999 allotted plot No. 279, Block-B, Bagdolla measuring
100 square metres at Dwarka to the petitioner. He was asked to deposit
the payment at provisional pre-determined rate of Rs.3462/- per square
metre as notified by the Government of India for the year 1990-2000. The
amount was to be paid in installments. It is an admitted case of the parties

that the petitioner paid the said installments in terms of the allotment letter
as per the details given below:(i) Rs.1,21,170/- on 22.02.2000.
(ii) Rs.1,73,100/- on 20.04.2000.
2.

Thereafter, the petitioner received another letter dated 31st May, 2001

asking the petitioner to deposit balance premium of Rs.51,930/- and C.O.P.
charges of Rs.11/-. Petitioner was also asked to file some documents like
undertaking, affidavit, photographs etc. The said amount of Rs.51,941/was deposited on 29th June, 2001 and DDA was informed about the same.
DDA once again by their letter dated 12th December, 2001 asked for some
more documents. In response, the petitioner replied by his letter dated 28th
December, 2001 pointing out that the format of the affidavit and documents
required to be submitted had not been furnished.

Thereafter, these

documents were also submitted by the petitioner. DDA by their letter dated
9th June, 2003 had asked the petitioner to clarify about the name of his
father as mentioned in the ration card and submit photographs on the plain
sheet of paper. These particulars and details were furnished.
3.

DDA by their letter dated 1st August, 2003 asked the petitioner to

report for handing over physical possession of the plot on 13rd August,
2003. The petitioner reported but possession was not handed over to him

as it was found on physical verification that the plot size was 60 square
metres and not 100 square metres. In the report dated 13th August, 2003 it
is mentioned that possession could not be handed over due to physical
verification of plot and as soon as it was checked and verified, possession
would be handed over to the allottee on 5th September, 2003 at 11 a.m.
Possession was not handed over on 5th September, 2003 also. We are now
in 2008 and no plot has been allotted to the petitioner. DDA has retained
money or the entire sale consideration deposited by the petitioner since
2000.
4.

In the counter affidavit it is stated that plot could not be handed over

to the petitioner due to shortage of land available at the site and it was
decided to allot another plot as and when sufficient number of plots are
available as per the policy for alternative allotment.
5.

I may note here that by interim order dated 6th February, 2007 it was

directed that the respondent-DDA will keep vacant one of the plots out of
plot nos. 121-127, Block-B, Pocket-III, Sector 17, Dwarka for allotment to
the petitioner.

It is stated in the counter affidavit that plot bearing Nos.

121-127, Block-B-III, Sector-17, Dwarka are of the size of 125 square
metres and not 100 square metres. It is submitted that these are only

seven plots and not ten plots and as per the policy of DDA, as and when
sufficient plots are available, draw of lots will be held. It is also stated in the
counter affidavit that as per the new policy, draw of lots can be conducted
only if 10 plots are available and also the plots measuring upto 100 square
metres should be situated on road width of upto 9 metres and plots
above 100 square metres should be situated on the road width of upto 13.5
metres. Another statement made in the counter affidavit is that further
allotment is to be made only in developing sectors.
6.

As per the recommendation given by the Delhi Administration, the

petitioner is entitled to allotment of plot measuring 150 square yards, which
is about 125 square metres. Allotment letter was issued to the petitioner
way back in December, 1999. The petitioner had made payment as
demanded by the DDA for the said 100 square metres of plot way back in
the year 2000. Wait cannot be endless. Cost of construction is going up
every year. The petitioner should not be made to wait for eight years after
he has deposited the full amount with the respondent. It was the fault of
DDA as a wrong plot was allotted to the petitioner. The case of the
petitioner cannot be equated with other cases where allotments are yet to
be made. The present case is not one where several applications have to
be considered before allotment is to be made. In the present case, due to

lapse on the part of DDA, the petitioner could not be given possession of
the plot for which he has made full payment. Allotment was already made
to the petitioner. The case of the petitioner, therefore, cannot be clubbed
and treated like

other cases where mere recommendations have been

given by the Delhi Administration, but allotment letters have not been
issued. The present case is one where allotment letter has been issued by
DDA, but due to fault on the part of DDA, possession of the said plot
cannot be handed over to the petitioner.

It will not be just and fair to ask

the petitioner to wait endlessly, even after he had deposited the full
payment as demanded by the DDA way back in the year, 2000. Eight
years have gone by since then. It is also not the case of the respondentDDA that plots are not available.
7.

In these circumstances, it is directed that DDA will allot a plot to the

petitioner measuring 100 square metres or above but within the entitlement
of the petitioner in Dwarka, Phase-I.

If no plot of land is available in

Dwarka Phase-I, he will be allotted a plot in Dwarka Phase-II. In case the
plot to be allotted to the petitioner is more than 100 square metres, the cost
price of the said additional land will be charged in terms of the policy of the
DDA. The petitioner has already paid for 100 square metres of land as per
the fixed rate prevailing in the year 1999-2000. The petitioner will not pay
extra amount for the said 100 square metres. However, no interest will be
paid to the petitioner on the amount deposited. The aforesaid allotment will

be completed within a period of six weeks from today.

The writ petition

is disposed of.
