PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

On 24.10.1996, deceased Rajinder Prasad, aged 28 years died

when the TSR bearing registration No.DL-IL-8661 which was being
driven by him met with an accident.

He was survived by wife, 2

children and mother.
2.

It was pleaded by the dependents of the deceased that

deceased was employed as a driver with respondent No.5, Ashok
Kumar Dureja, (owner of the vehicle) and that he died during the
course of his employment. Thus, they filed a claim petition under
Section 140 read with 166 of the M.V. Act, 1988 claiming a
MAC.APP.No.879/05

Page No.1 of 6

compensation from the owner and insurer of the vehicle.
3.

As it was proved that accident in question was caused due to

the overturning of the vehicle driven by the deceased and no other
vehicle was involved in the accident, learned Tribunal treated claim
petition filed by the dependents as one filed under Section 163A of
the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
4.

Wife of the deceased, Rajwati Devi stepped into the witness

box as PW-3 and deposed that deceased was employed as a driver
earning Rs.3000/- per month at the time of the accident.
5.

Relying upon the testimony of the wife of the deceased,

learned Tribunal has taken income of the deceased at the time of the
accident as Rs.3000/- per month.
6.

Giving benefit of future increase in the income of the deceased,

mean monthly income of the deceased has been taken by the
Tribunal as Rs.4500/- per month. Deducting 1/3rd towards personal
spending of the deceased, average monthly dependence has been
assessed by the Tribunal at Rs.3000/- per month.

Deceased was

aged 28 years at the time of the accident. Thus, as per IInd Schedule,
multiplier of 18 has been adopted by the Tribunal. Thus, total loss of
dependence has been assessed at Rs.6,48,000/-.
7.

Under

the

head

'non-pecuniary

damages',

Tribunal

has

awarded a sum of Rs.15,000/-. Thus, total compensation awarded by

MAC.APP.No.879/05

Page No.2 of 6

the Tribunal is Rs.6,63,000/-.
8.

Aggrieved by the amount of compensation awarded by the

Tribunal to dependents/respondents 1 to 4, insurance company has
filed the present appeal.
9.

Learned counsel for the insurance company had raised 2

contentions in support of his appeal.
10.

The first ground urged by the insurance company is that while

determining monthly income of the deceased at the time of the
accident, learned Tribunal erred in relying upon the testimony of the
wife of the deceased when there was no evidence on record to prove
the income of the deceased.
11.

I agree with the contention advanced by the learned counsel

for the insurance company. In absence of clear and cogent evidence
pertaining to income of the deceased, learned Tribunal should have
determined income of the deceased on the basis of minimum wages
notified under the Minimum Wages Act.

As the deceased was

employed as a driver, I place him in the category of skilled labourers.
Minimum wages for skilled labourers as on 1.2.1996 was Rs.2,101/per month. (rounded off to Rs.2100/- per month). I adopt this figure
as the monthly income of the deceased at the time of the accident.
12.

Learned counsel for the insurance company next submits that

while determining loss of dependence, Tribunal erred in giving

MAC.APP.No.879/05

Page No.3 of 6

benefits of future increase in the income of the deceased. Counsel
further contends that as the Tribunal has treated claim petition as
one filed under Section 163-A, compensation had to be computed
strictly in accordance with IInd Schedule appended to the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988.
13.

I agree with the learned counsel for the appellant inasmuch as

the Tribunal ought to have determined compensation strictly in
accordance with IInd Schedule as it has treated the petition as one
filed under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
14.

However, it is pertinent to note clause 3 of Section 163-A.

Clause 3 of Section 163-A reads as under :-

15.

“(3) The Central Government may, keeping in view the
cost of living by notification in the Official Gazette, from
time to time amend the Second Schedule.”
IInd Schedule was appended to the Motor Vehicles Act in the

year 1994. Unfortunately, Government has not exercised its power
provided under Clause (3). Thus, IInd Schedule remains unamended
since the date of its inception till today.
16.

I note that from year 1994 to today, inflation has gone up by

4% to 6% each year. Keeping in view the rise in inflation and cost of
living and the fact that the Government has not amended IInd
Schedule, I think it appropriate to give benefit of 25% increase in the
income even as per the IInd Schedule. Thus, I take mean monthly
income of the deceased as Rs.2,363/-. (Rs.3000 + Rs.2,625/- (25%
MAC.APP.No.879/05

Page No.4 of 6

increase in income) ÷ 2 = Rs.2,363/-.
17.

Deducting 1/3rd towards personal spending of the deceased,

loss of dependence works out to Rs.1,575/- per month.
18.

IInd Schedule provides for a multiplier of 18 in the case of

deceased aged between 25 to 30 years. As the deceased was aged
28 years at the time of the accident, I apply multiplier of 18. Thus,
total compensation works out to Rs.3,40,200/-. Adding Rs.15,000/as awarded by the Tribunal under the head 'non'pecuniary damages'
total compensation is assessed at Rs.3,55,200/-.
19.

I note that dependents had claimed a compensation of

Rs.3,00,000/- on account of death of deceased in the said road
accident. In this regard, suffice would it be to note the judgment of
the Supreme Court reported as Naggappa Vs. Guru Dayal Singh 2003
ACJ 12. In the para 7 of the report Supreme Court has observed as
under :“Firstly, under the provisions of M.V. Act, there is no
restriction that compensation could be awarded only
upto the amount claimed by the claimants.
In an
appropriate case where from the evidence brought on
record if Tribunal Court considers that claimant is
entitled to get more compensation than claimed, the
Tribunal may pass such award. Only embargo is -------- It
should be 'just' compensation, that is to say, it should be
neither arbitrary, fanciful or unjusticiable from the
evidence.”
20.

Tribunal has awarded pendente lite and future interest @ 9%

per annum.

The award is dated 18.8.2005.

MAC.APP.No.879/05

At that time,
Page No.5 of 6

nationalized Banks were offering interest @ 6% per annum.
Therefore, I modify the award to the extent that pendente lite and
future interest shall carry an interest @ 6% per annum.
21.

Accordingly, appellant insurance company is liable to pay a

compensation of Rs.3,55,200/- together with interest @ 6% p.a. from
date of claim petition till date of realisation.

Award is modified to

that extent.
22.

Appeal is accordingly disposed of.

23.

No costs.
