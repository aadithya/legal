1.

The Netaji Subhash Institute of Technology referred to as the

petitioner in this judgment and Shri Dilkhush Bairwa, referred to as the
respondent herein have filed writ petition (Civil) Nos. 2252/2003 and
2351/2005 respectively assailing the industrial award dated 6th February,
2002. As these petitions raise identical questions of law and fact, they are
being taken up together for disposal. In as much as there is no dispute to
the facts which give rise to the petition, the same are noted hereafter. The
respondent workman was admittedly appointed as a mason by a letter of
appointment dated 25th February, 1991. In the letter of appointment, the
workman was notified that he was appointed to this post in the pay scale of
Rs.975-25-1150-EB-30-1540 with a starting salary of Rs.975/- along with
allowances as were admissible under the applicable rules. The letter of
appointment contained clause 1 wherein it was stated that post was
WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.2

temporary but the respondent was appointed on ad-hoc basis for a period of
six months.

According to the petitioner, as the work for which the

respondent was appointed could not be completed within this period, by an
office order dated 9th October, 1991, the ad hoc tenure of the respondent was
extended for a further period of six months w.e.f. 26th August, 1991 and
thereafter again by an order dated 12th March, 1992 for a period of three
months w.e.f. 26th February, 1992.

In terms of the clear stipulations

contained in this office order, the services of the respondent were
terminated by an order dated 25th May, 1992 with immediate effect.
2.

The respondent made a grievance of the termination of his services

before the conciliation officer. The petitioner has contended that on account
of the intervention of the conciliation officer, the petitioner was persuaded
to make payment of Rs.2,456/- to the workman and the petitioner had sent a
cheque for this amount to the workman which he apparently accepted
without prejudice to his rights and contentions.

Thereafter, as the

conciliation failed, by an order dated 1st June, 1995, the following dispute
was referred for adjudication to the industrial adjudicator:“Whether the services of Shri Dilkhush Bairwa have been
terminated illegally and/or unjustifiably by the
management and if so, to what relief is he entitled and
WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.3

what directions are necessary in this respect?”
3.

In the statement of claim filed by the respondent workman, the

workman had principally contended that he was appointed since 25th
February, 1991 but against a permanent post of mason and that his last
drawn wages were Rs.2,005/-. It was contended that his recruitment was
made against a permanent post and new hands having been recruited against
the same after the termination of the services of the petitioner, rendered the
action of the petitioner illegal and also violative of the terms on which he
has been appointed. It has also been submitted that termination of the
services of the petitioner was in violation of the principles of natural justice
and that the petitioner had not made any payment in full and final settlement
of the claims of the respondent.

On this basis, the workman sought

reinstatement with continuity of service and full back wages.
4.

The claim was contested by the petitioner however on the ground that

the workman was appointed on an ad hoc basis on the terms which have
been noticed hereinafter and the workman was put to notice with regard to
the temporary nature thereof as well as the duration on which he had been
engaged. It was denied that the workman has been appointed against a

WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.4

permanent post. Upon a detailed consideration of the matter, the industrial
adjudicator rendered a finding that the appointment of the workman was for
a specific period which was covered under the statutory provision of Section
2(oo)(bb) of the Act and, therefore, it was held that the respondent has been
appointed purely on ad hoc basis for a fixed period. However, after arriving
at such a finding, the industrial adjudicator has gone into the issue of
requirement of notice and pay while deciding issue no.1 and has held that
the petitioner had violated the provisions of Section 25-F by non-payment in
terms thereof hence rendering the termination of the service of the
respondent as illegal.

In these circumstances, by the award dated 6th

February, 2002, the petitioner has been directed to reinstate the workman
into service with 25% back wages.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length. It is noteworthy
that the industrial adjudicator has also noticed that the workman had failed
to establish that the management had appointed any other person on the post
of mason after termination of the services of the workman and also that
there was no post of mason since the year 1992 till it was created in 1998.
This award has been assailed before this court on the ground that in view of
the findings returned by the industrial adjudicator that the termination of
WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.5

services of the workman was covered under the provisions of Section
2(oo)(bb) of the Act, the petitioner was not required to comply with the
provisions of Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and that the
award cannot be sustained in the light of the authoritative pronouncement of
the Apex Court on the subject.
5.

According to the respondent, in as much as the respondent was

granted substantial relief by the directions in the Award there was no need
for it to assail the findings in the industrial award.

The respondent

workman has challenged the non-grant of full wages by way of the WP (C)
No.2391/2005 without, in any manner, impugning the other findings
returned in the award. It is contended that the respondent was appointed
after a due selection process and consequently, his appointment did not
remain contractual. It is also submitted that in view of the selection process,
it has to be held that the appointment of the workman was against a
permanent post. The workman has challenged the non-grant of full wages
by way of the WP (C) No.2391/2005.
8.

In order to appreciate the effect of the order of termination, it

becomes necessary to examine the necessary statutory provisions in this
behalf.

The same are to be found in Section 2 (oo) of the Industrial

WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.6

Disputes Act, 1947, the relevant extracts whereof reads as under:“2(oo) retrenchment” means the termination by the
employer of the service of a workman for any reason
whatsoever, otherwise that as a punishment inflicted by
way of disciplinary action but does not include:xxx
(b)

retirement of the workman on reaching the age of
superannuation if the contract of employment between
the employer nd the workman concerned contains a
stipulation in that behalf; or”

Certain exceptions have been carried out in the enactment. In the

instant case, a finding of fact has been returned by the Industrial adjudicator
that the appointment of the workman was for a specific period and that the
termination of his service was covered under the exception provided under
Section 2(oo)(bb) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 which has become
final. As a consequence thereof, the question which would require to be
answered is the effect of such a termination and as to whether the provisions
of Section 25-F of the Act would be applicable to the same. This issue has
fallen for consideration before the Supreme Court in a large number of
cases. The Court has also been called upon to consider the termination of
the service of the workman who has been employed for the purpose of work
WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.7

on project tenures specific contracts; muster roll employment; casual labour
and of workmen who are appointed from time to time against regular posts
which actually exist in the establishment.
The Supreme Court had occasion to examine a claim of a casual
employee who was appointed on specific project work, i.e. of laying electric
lines at a par. The court held Such a workman could not claim entitlement
to the same job which come into existence in other places or for other parts
of the same project as for digging holes for installing the electric poles for
the lines. It was further held that the workman could, therefore, neither
claim reinstatement nor regularisation. There was no permanent post to
which they could be reinstated. The judgment of the Apex Court has been
reported at 2004 (8) SCC 246 entitled M.P. Electricity Board Vs. Hariram
in which the Supreme Court.
10.

In this pronouncement, the Supreme Court cited with approval its

earlier decision reported at 1994 (2) SCC 323 entitled M. Venugopal Vs.
Divisional Manager, Life Insurance Corporation of India.
Shri Dilkhush Bairwa, the respondent-workman was appointed as a
mason on a post which did not exist when he was appointed or when his
services were terminated. It has come in the affidavit of the of the petitioner
WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.8

establishment that the post of mason was created only in the year 1998 and
that recruitment rules in respect thereof have still not been framed. The
workman has failed to establish that any appointment has been effected by
the petitioner to any regular post of mason.
11.

In the instant case, the industrial adjudicator has specifically held that

the appointment of the workman was for a specific period as was covered
under sub-clause (b) of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
Therefore, it has rightly been held by the impugned award that such a
termination of service could not be covered under the definition of the
expression “retrenchment” as has been defined under Section 2(oo) of the
Statute.

In this behalf, reference can appropriately be made to the

pronouncement of the apex court reported at (2001) 5 SCC 540 entitled
Harmohinder Singh Vs. Kharga Canteen, Ambala Cantt. In this case it
was held that contracts of service which are for a fixed term, are excluded
from the definition of retrenchment in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. It
was held that where termination takes place on the expiry of the contract
period or in terms of the contract, the principles of natural justice are not
attracted. In this behalf, reliance was placed on the earlier pronouncement
of the Supreme Court in (1998) 6 SCC 538 entitled Uptron India Ltd. Vs.
WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.9

Shammi Bhan.
In a pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (1997) 11 SCC
521 entitled Escorts Ltd. Vs. Presiding Officer and Anr., an argument was
laid that even though a workman had been appointed on temporary basis for
period of two months, it was urged that because the workman had worked
for 240 days, the termination of his services amounted to retrenchment
under Section 2 (oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the same
being in violation of Section 25 F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 was
illegal. The Apex Court held that it was unnecessary to go into the question
whether a workman had worked for 240 days in a year inasmuch
termination of services of the workman did not constitute retrenchment in
view of clause (bb) in Section 2 (oo) of the Act. The termination of the
services of the workman was in accordance with the stipulation contained in
his contract which is to be found in his letter of appointment. Therefore,
even though termination of the services of the workman was before the
expiry of the period of probation, however, since the termination of the
service was in accordance with the terms of the contract, it fell within the
ambit of Section 2 (oo) (bb) of the statute and did not constitute
retrenchment. In this regard, the Supreme Court cited with approval its
WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.10

earlier decision reported at (1994) 2 SCC 323 entitled M.Venugopal Vs.
Divisional Manager, LIC.
Therefore, there can be no manner of doubt that this court is bound by
the authoritative judicial pronouncement of law to the effect that so long as
the termination of service of the workman is in accordance with the terms of
the contract on or expiry of the contract, the same does not amount to
retrenchment within the meaning of the expression as it is excepted under
Section 2 (oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. In these circumstances,
the employer would not be required to comply with the provisions of
Section 25 F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has also placed reliance on the
authoritative and binding pronouncement of the Apex Court in (1996) 1
SCC 595 (para 5) entitled State of Rajasthan Vs. Rameshwar Lal Gahlot, it
was held by the Supreme Court that termination on account of expiry of the
specified period mentioned in the appointment letter would be valid, unless
the same is found to be mala fide or in collarable exercise of power. In its
absence, the employer could terminate the services in terms of letter of
appointment. The court held that such a termination would be covered by
WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.11

Clause bb of Section 2(oo) of the Act and, therefore, Section 25-F would
have no application. In 2002 (5) SCC 646 (para 15) entitled Haryana
State F.C.C.W. Store Ltd. & Another Vs. Ram Niwas & Another Vs. Ram
Nivas & Others, the engagement of the workman was for a specific purpose
and for a particular period and disengagement was effected when the period
of their appointment had expired. It was held that such disengagement was
in terms of the contract of service and, therefore, not “retrenchment” within
the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Act.

In these circumstances, the

workman was held not entitled to any relief. In these circumstances, in the
light of the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the afore-noticed
judgment, Section 25-F would have no application to the facts and
circumstances of the case.
12.

So far as the findings of the industrial adjudicator to the effect that the

termination of the services of the respondent was covered under Section
2(oo)(bb) of the Act are concerned, the same has attained finality. Even
before me, there is no challenge to the same by the workman.
13.

In view of the finding of the industrial adjudicator, there could be no

requirement of service of notice or payment of wages to the workman in
accordance with Section 25-F of the Statute.
WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Learned counsel for the
Page No.12

respondent has urged before me that it would be immaterial as to the terms
on which the respondent was appointed in as much as he has covered a total
period of more than one year in service even though under separate letters
of appointment and therefore it is incumbent upon the petitioner to comply
with the provisions of Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
14.

I find that the pronouncement of the Apex Court in 2000 Lab. I.C.

250 entitled Management of MCD Vs. Prem Chand Gupta & Another is of
no assistance to the case of the respondent in as much as in this case, the
workman had been appointed in a vacant permanent post. There is no
dispute that the workman was engaged to work as a mason. In the instant
case, admittedly, there was no post of mason in existence either when the
respondnet was engaged or when his services were terminated.
15.

Similarly, the principles laid down in 2000 Lab. I.C. 613 entitled

Management of Horticulture, Department of Delhi Administration Vs.
Trilok Chand & Another would have no application in the instant case in as
much as in this case, the court was concerned with the termination of
services of daily rated workman who had been working continuously.
There was nothing on the record of the case to suggest that his appointment
was for a specific tenure under written terms of appointment.
WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.13

16.

For the same reason, the judgment reported at 1999 LAB. I.C. 619

entitled MCD Vs. Praveen Kumar Jain would have no application as it
related to termination of services of a casual worker.
17.

Therefore, the finding of the industrial tribunal to the effect that the

management violated the provisions of Section 25-F of the Act is erroneous
in law in as much as Section 25-F would have no application to the case
where the termination of the services of the workman is covered under the
provisions of Section 2(oo)(bb) of the Statute.
18.

In the light of the afore-noticed discussion, it is also noteworthy that

the industrial adjudicator has found that the post of meson was created only
in July, 1998. The services of the workman came to an end on 25 th March,
1992 and he was relieved on this date itself. Therefore, the petitioner has
stated, that no appointment has been effected as no recruitment rules have
been notified.

For this reason, the provisions of Section 25-H of the

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 would not be applicable to the instant case.
The findings on issue no.1 cannot be reconciled and cannot stand together
with the finding on issue no.2. The findings of the industrial adjudicator on
issue no.1 and the direction to reinstate the workman in the post of mason
and to make payment of wages are therefore not sustainable in law.
WP (C) No.2252/2003 & WP (C) No.2391/2005

Page No.14

This writ petition is, therefore allowed.
The findings of the industrial adjudicator on issue no.1 and the
directions issued to reinstate the respondent/workman with back wages and
to pay interest are contrary to law and are, therefore set aside and quashed.
In view of the afore-stated discussion, no relief of full back wages can
be granted to the workman in WP (C) No.2391/2005.
Writ Petition (C) No.2391/2005 filed by the workman, therefore, is
hereby dismissed.
Learned counsel for the respondent has made a grievance that the
petitioner has not made payment of the wages which were awarded to the
respondent in terms of the order dated 29th March, 2004. Learned counsel
for the petitioner has submitted that a period of four weeks has been granted
and arrangements have been made to make the payment in terms of the
order.
The amount shall be paid by the petitioner to the workman within a
period of four weeks.
It is pointed out by learned counsel for the respondent that the
petitioner has deposited a sum of Rs.70,000/- in terms of the order dated 17th
May, 2004. The Writ Petition (Civil) No.2252/2003 of Netaji Subhash
