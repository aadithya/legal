JUDGMENT
1.

There are seventy (70) Petitioners before us all of

whom prayed for the issuance of a writ of mandamus and
further

appropriate directions

to the Respondents to allow

pensionary benefits to them with all consequential benefits
including the payment of arrears for the period when the
W.P. (C) 5853 of 2007

Page 1 of 10

benefits were withheld and further to allow the Petitioners to
rejoin/be re-inducted to their respective services. It is the latter
prayer which has been substantially pressed before us. The
controversy, however, is no longer res integra in view of the
decision of the Supreme Court in Union of India -vs- Rakesh

Kumar, (2001) 4 SCC 309 and Raj Kumar -vs- Union of India,
(2006) 1 SCC 737.

2.

In Rakesh Kumar the Petitioner had joined the

Border Service Force as
continued to

serve

till

a
he

constable on 15.1.1981 and
submitted

his

resignation

on

11.2.1994, after rendering 12 years and 8 months of service.
His resignation was accepted on 1.3.1994 under Rule 19 of the
Border Security Force Rules, 1969 (hereinafter referred to as
`the BSF Rules'). By Order dated 3.5.1997 Rakesh Kumar was
allowed full pensionary benefits as admissible under the Rules
consequent upon his resignation from the BSF. As the pension
was not released the High Court of Himachal Pradesh was
approached which directed the Competent Authority to quantify
pensionary benefit of Rakesh Kumar as other similarly situated
persons from the date of their retirement.

Their Lordships

noted that the Petitioner(s) in that batch of petitions had served
W.P. (C) 5853 of 2007

Page 2 of 10

for more than 10 years but were not eligible or entitled to get
pensionary benefits and accordingly the High Court's directions
tantamounted to perpetuating illegality. Their Lordships further
observed that payment of pension neither attracted Article 14,
nor estopped the Department from discontinuing payment and
from seeking recovery. Since the Petitioner had not fulfilled the
parameters of “qualifying service” as envisaged under the CCS
(Pension) Rules

it was held that the Respondents who were

permitted to resign from service under Rule 19 of the BSF Rules
before the attainment of age of retirement or before

putting

such number of years of service as may be necessary under the
Rules to gain eligibility for retirement, would not be entitled to
get pension.

It was further enunciated that the Government

cannot amend or substitute statutory rules by administrative
instructions, and only if the Rules are silent on any particular
point could the Government fill up the gaps provided there was
no inconsistency with the extant Rules. All the Petitioners before
us have also not served the minimum period envisaged under
CCS (Pension) Rules as would render them

eligible for

retirement with pensionary benefits.

3.

In Raj Kumar their Lordships noted that the

W.P. (C) 5853 of 2007

Page 3 of 10

GO/circular dated 27.12.1995 notifying that the Government
had

agreed with their views that “a member of the Force is

entitled to get pensionary benefits on resignation under Rule 19
of the said Rules provided he has put in requisite number of
years of service and fulfills all other eligibility conditions”.

The

said Circular was erroneously interpreted to permit any member
of the BSF to resign

with permission of the Competent

Authority even before completing qualifying service. The result
was that in the case of 447 personnel the pension was released
and in the case of 1762 personnel a decision in this regard was
pending.

In those circumstances, on 15.1.1998 rectificatory

all personnel who

with

pensionary benefits not granted to them till then should be
taken back into service.

These disputes had come before their

Lordships who decided the matter in the following terms:
14. We are unable to accept the contention urged on
behalf of the petitioners that the confusion with
regard to the interpretation of Rule 19 of BSF Rules
was cleared only as a result of the judgment in
Rakesh Kumar. Even before Rakesh Kumar was
decided, way back in the year 1998 itself the
authorities seemed to have realised their mistake as
evidenced by the letter dated 15.01.1998 followed by
W.P. (C) 5853 of 2007

Page 4 of 10

the circular dated 17.10.1998. Rakesh Kumar was
decided only in the year 2001, almost 3 years later.
Such of the BSF personnel who had resigned in the
hope of getting pensionary benefits, although not
eligible for pension under the CCS Pension Rules
1972, had been given the opportunity of getting back
into service by virtue of the circular dated 17.10.1998.
Despite the deadline for reporting being extended
from 30.04.1999 to 31.08.1999, about 697 personnel
had failed to avail of the opportunity of returning to
service. There cannot be any equity in favour of those
that failed to avail of the opportunity of rejoining
service. If any of them failed to take advantage of the
offer for re-induction into service, they have only
themselves to thank, in such cases, obviously, there
cannot be any relief granted in the present writ
petitions, contrary to the law declared by Rakesh
Kumar.

17. We find that the cases before us can be divided
into the following categories:
(A) Pre-circular. Personnel who resigned and
were granted pension for special reasons, even prior
to the circular dated 27.12.1995.
(B)

Post-circular.

Personnel

who

resigned

pursuant to the circular dated 27.12.1995. These

categories:
(i)

Personnel

who

in

1996,

were

sanctioned pension and were therefore asked
vide letters dated 31.10.1998 not to report for
re-induction. Their pension has been stopped
pursuant to the judgment in Rakesh Kumar.
These persons can be further divided into two
sub-categories:
(a) those who are in a position to be reinducted into service even now; and
(b) those who cannot be re-inducted into the
service as a result of being age-barred or
due to being medically or physically unfit.
(ii) Those who retired subsequent to 1996, were
not sanctioned pension, and were directed to
report for re-induction in to service or to forfeit
pension benefits by virtue of the circular dated
17.10.1998 and the individual letters.
18. Having considered the peculiar facts arising in
each of these groups, we make the following orders:
1. The personnel falling in category (B)(ii)
i.e. those persons who had retired subsequent to
1996 pursuant to the circular dated 27.10.1995
and had not been sanctioned pension, but who
have been directed to report for re-induction in
service shall necessarily have to forfeit their
pension, if they have not reported for service by
virtue

of

W.P. (C) 5853 of 2007

the

circular

dated

17.10.1998.

If

Page 6 of 10

however, they have reported for service then
there is no question of any relief in their case.
2. In the case of persons falling in category
(B)(i), they shall also be given the option of reinduction into service, and those falling in category
(B)(i)(a) shall be so re-inducted, subject to the
conditions stipulated in circular dated 17.10.1998 and
on condition that they shall refund the GPF and
pension amounts drawn by them till re-induction. The
authorities shall indicate the deadline by which such
persons shall offer themselves for re-induction.
3. In the case of persons who shall fall in
category B(i)(b), i.e. persons who had retired in 1996,
were sanctioned pension but who cannot be reinducted today as they are age-barred or physically or
medically unfit or for any other reason including their
inability to return the amount of GPF, pension drawn
or other dues, there shall be no question of continuing
payment of pension which shall be liable to cease as a
result of the decision in Rakesh Kumar. We are
however of the view that equity demands that in such
cases there shall be no recovery of the pension
amounts already paid to them.
4. In cases which fall under category (A), i.e.
personnel who had resigned prior to the circular
dated 27.12.1995 and had been granted pension for
special reasons and continued to draw it till the
stoppage of pension as a result of the judgment in
W.P. (C) 5853 of 2007

Page 7 of 10

Rakesh Kumar we think that irrespective of the
position in law, equity demands that, as they have
drawn their pension for long periods, they shall not be
asked to refund their drawn pension amounts, nor
shall their pension be stopped now.
19. We have made the aforesaid directions in exercise
of our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution in
order to do complete justice to a section of the
personnel who would otherwise be placed in an
inequitable situation for which the authorities are also
partly to blame. It is open to this Court to mould the
relief by safeguarding the interest of the parties even
while declaring the law. The paramount consideration
in such cases should be to ensure that there is no
injustice caused (see in this connection Deb Narayan
Shyam v. State of W.B., (2005) 2 SCC 286, paras 26
and 29 and State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Prasad
Singh, (2000) 9 SCC 94, para 36. Barring this limited
relief no other relief is due to the petitioners before
us. Subject to the aforesaid limited relief all the
petitions are dismissed.
(emphasis added)
4.

The learned counsel for the Petitioners clarifies that

the Petitioners before us did not avail of the opportunity to be
taken back in service as per letter of the Director General, BSF
dated 15.1.1998. It is contended that the matter had already
become sub judice and in these circumstances the Petitioners
W.P. (C) 5853 of 2007

Page 8 of 10

were of the view that they were entitled to await the outcome
of that litigation.

Since they have been unsuccessful in their

efforts, they must bear the brunt of their obduracy.

The writ petition is without merit and is dismissed

accordingly.
