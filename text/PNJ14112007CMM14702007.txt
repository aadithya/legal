PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
The petitioners are aggrieved by an order which has

declined delay to be condoned in preferring an application
under Order 9 Rule 13, alternatively to be read as an
application under Order 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
2.

Relevant facts are that the respondent has filed a

suit for ejectment and mesne profits against the petitioners.
Summons in the suit were duly served upon the petitioners and
second petitioner who is the Director of the first petitioner

He prayed for further time to file a written

Time was granted. It was directed that advance

copy of the written statement would be supplied to counsel for
the plaintiff by 16.12.2005 and in court the same would be filed
on 12.1.2006, the next date notified for hearing. On said date

proceedings were conducted against the petitioners.

Ex-parte
Finally,

an ex-parte decree was passed on 20.9.2006.
3.

A composite application under Order 9 Rule 13,

Order 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure cum Section 5 of the
Limitation Act was filed by the petitioners. It was prayed that
delay in preferring the application be condoned. On merits it
was pointed out that reason, being the sufficient cause, for
non-appearance on 12.1.2006 and on subsequent dates was
that petitioner No.2 who attended the hearing on 10.11.2005
casually met one Amit Kukshel, Advocate in Tis Hazari Courts.
The lawyer gave him his visiting card. Fee was not paid to
the

Page 2 of 6
lawyer. The lawyer was requested to take an adjournment for
filing the written statement.

That unfortunately, petitioner

No.2 lost the visiting card of the lawyer and since the lawyer
had a sitting place some where within the precincts of Tis
Hazari Courts Complex second petitioner had no means to
locate the lawyer. As regards the lawyer concerned it was
stated that since no fee was paid to him, probably for said
reason, the lawyer did not appear in court after obtaining time
to file the written statement on 10.11.2005.

It was further

stated that on 29.11.2006 petitioner No.2 came into contact
with one Ramesh Kumar an Advocate in Tis Hazari.

He

appraised the lawyer of an institution of a suit against the
petitioners.

With great difficulty the lawyer concerned, after

making personal efforts, learnt about the ex-parte judgment
and decree dated 20.9.2006.

It is stated that thereafter the

application in question was drafted and filed.
4.

I note that the affidavit in support of the application

has been deposed to before the learned Oath Commissioner on
2.12.2006.
5.

The learned Trial Judge found that the cause shown

did not constitute a sufficient cause entitling the petitioners to
have the delay condoned in preferring composite application

Page 3 of 6
under Order 9 Rule 13 read with Order 47 of the Code of Civil
Procedure.
6.

I may note the averments made by the petitioners in

para 11 of the their application. The same reads as under :“11. On 29.11.2006 the defendant no.2 came
in contact with Sh. Ramesh Kumar, Advocate
through a common friend apprised him all the
above facts. Except the name of the case and
the name of this Hon'ble Court, the defendant
no.2 did not have any other clue available with
him. The said Advocate made efforts and
came to know about the passing of the said
ex-parte
judgment
and
decree
dated
20.09.2006 and has accordingly apprised the
defendant no.2 about the same. The time
thereafter has been taken by the said
Advocate in preparing this application.”
7.

To say the least, the averments are lacking in

material particulars. A sweeping and all embracing statement
has been made that Ramesh Kumar made efforts and learnt
about the passing of the ex-parte judgment and decree dated
20.9.2006. What those efforts were? None have been stated.
In this connection, it is relevant to note that case projected by
the petitioners is that second petitioner had handed over all
papers to the earlier counsel and for said reason was
handicapped in trying to even locate the suit which was filed
against the petitioners by the respondent.

Under the

circumstances only method available with Ramesh Kumar

to

Page 4 of 6
locate the ex-parte judgment and decree would be to carry out
a search of virtually all suits filed in Tis Hazari about 3 months
prior to 5.10.2005 for the reason only information available
with the petitioners was (being served with summons in a suit
to cause appearance to be entered on 5.10.2005), the suit in
question had to be a suit filed prior to 5.10.2005.
8.

As noted here-in-above, affidavit in support of the

application has been deposed to on 2.12.2006.

It is difficult to

believe that within a short span of less than 3 days the counsel
managed to locate the suit file.
9.

Be that as it may, question which arises for

consideration is: whether the petitioners were diligent and were
bona fide prosecuting their defence.
10.

If the version of the petitioners is to be accepted,

petitioners have to explain as to why they did not try and
contact the plaintiff of the suit. Surely, second petitioner could
not be oblivious of the fact that the plaintiff was none else
other than the landlady who claimed to have let out the suit
premises to the petitioners.

She could have been contacted

and request made that particulars about the suit should be
made available to the petitioners.
11.

For the facts noted here-in-above I

find

that

no
Page 5 of 6
sufficient cause exists entitling petitioners to have the delay
condoned. The view taken by the learned Trial Judge is legal
and valid.
12.

The petition is dismissed.
