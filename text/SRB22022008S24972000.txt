company under the Companies Act, 1961, having its registered office at 222-223,
“Ashirwad’, D-1, Green Park, New Delhi – 110 016. The Plaintiff avers that the
Defendant company and its officers issued advertisements from time to time from
February, 1999, in newspapers and other Dailies including the various Journals,
Magazines etc and also printed pamphlets inviting and enticing the public at large to
invest in their “Fixed Deposit” scheme for a lucrative and handsome returns on the
money invested with the company.

That defendants company’s Chairman & Managing Director, Directors, Secretary

and Principal Officers Directors in the brochure advertised about the various schemes and

scheme. It is averred that the defendant secured, from the plaintiff, fixed deposits
aggregating Rs. 20,00,000/- (Rupees twenty lakhs only), through receipt numbers.

defendants company Shri Rajeev Khandelwal and Ghanshyam Gupta signed cheques

amount held by the defendants company. Further to acceptance of the Fixed Deposit the
Defendant Company issued various Cheques for discharge of debt and liability towards
the interest accrued up-to various dates on the those fixed deposits. The cheques were
returned unpaid from the defendant company’s bankers.
5.

It is averred that all officers including the Chairman, Managing Director,

Directors, Secretary of the defendants company at the time of issue of cheques had
assured and undertaken to the plaintiff that the said cheques issued pursuant to discharge

The plaintiff further avers that when the cheques were presented, the collecting

bank returned them, unpaid. It is alleged that the plaintiff caused legal notice, dated 26 th
July 2000 to be issued to the defendant, demanding payment of the amount for Rs.
21,15,068.50 but the defendant did not make the payment. The plaintiff has, in the
circumstances sought the decree in this summary suit; it is alleged that the sums are due
on a written contract, for a liquidated amount; the plaint is also based on negotiable
instruments, i.e the cheques which were returned dishonoured by the plaintiff’s bank
upon advise by the bank on which they were drawn.

The defendant entered appearance and filed an application, IA No. 8123/2002,

claiming that the suit could not be proceeded as it was declared “sick” under the Sick
Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (SICA). This court, by order dated
24-9-2003 adjourned the present suit, sine die. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an
application before the Board for Industrial Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and secured
permission from that Board, through its order dated 5-3-2004 to proceed against the
defendant for recovery of the fixed deposit amounts, which are subject of the present suit.
The proceedings were accordingly revived, after the plaintiff filed an application IA
2264/2004, which was allowed on 13-1-2005.
8.

The defendant sought leave to defend this suit, by filing IA 8103/2005; it took

various pleas. In the grounds, it has again adverted to the pendancy of proceedings before
BIFR and its being a sick company. In addition, the defendant avers that an application
being CP No. 324/2002, under Section 391 of the Companies Act, 1956 for compromise
and arrangement of the company, is pending before the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
It further relies upon an order made on 17-10-2002 whereby suits filed by unsecured
creditors against it ( i.e the present defendant) were adjourned to 9-1-2003. It is averred
that the plaintiff falls within the description “unsecured creditors” whose suits have been
stayed and that the order of the said High Court is still in force. The defendant's

CS(OS) 2497/2000

5 of

13

application also avers that the petition is fixed for 22-9-2005. It is lastly averred that the
jurisdiction for the cause of action asserted in the present case lies exclusively with the
Company Law Board, by virtue of Section 58-A of the Companies Act.
9.

The plaintiff, in its reply to the application for leave to defend, avers that the

defendant applicant has not adverted to any order after 17-10-2002 in the company
proceedings before the Punjab and Haryana High Court. It is also averred that the
defendant has not disclosed what happened on the next date of hearing, i.e 9-1-2003, or
produced any material concerning the proceedings under Section 391 of the Companies
Act.
10.

While giving leave to defend the suit the Court has to observe the following

principles:

(a) If the Court is of opinion that the case raises a triable issue then leave to defend
should ordinarily be granted unconditionally - The question whether the defense
raises a triable issue or not has to be ascertained by Court from the pleadings
before it and the affidavits of parties;

(b) If the Court is satisfied that the facts disclosed by the defendant do not indicate
that he has a substantial defense to raise or that the defense intended to put by the

CS(OS) 2497/2000

6 of

13

defendant is frivolous or vexatious it may refuse leave to defend altogether;

(c) In cases where the Court entertains a genuine doubt on the question as to
whether the defence is genuine or sham or whether it raises a triable issue or not,
the Court may impose conditions in granting leave to defend.

(Ref. Defiance Knitting Industries Pvt. Ltd. Vs Jay Arts 2006(4) Civil Court Cases
259 (S.C.) and UBS AG Vs State Bank of Patiala 2006(3) Apex Court Judgments
324 (S.C.)).
11.

The defendant, in the application for leave to defend, has not indicated any

substantial defense which could be called a “triable issue”, in the opinion of this court. It
has merely averred that the present proceedings are stayed by the order of the Punjab and
Haryana High Court in some petition, under Section 391 of the Companies Act. Reliance
is placed upon an order dated 17th October, 2002, for the purpose. That order itself
indicates that it was to be in force till 9-1-2003. Moreover, the defendant does not appear
to have disclosed about this when it had sought stay of the present suit on the ground of
pendancy of proceedings under SICA. Another aspect is that the application for leave to
defend was filed on 30th September, 2005; yet the defendant does not disclose what
transpired on the previous date of hearing in the pending proceedings for

CS(OS) 2497/2000

compromise/ arrangement.
12.

As far as the question of bar of jurisdiction, the second question raised in the

leave to defend application, is concerned, Section 58-A of the Companies Act reads as
follows:
“58A. Deposits not to be invited without issuing an advertisement.

(b)
No deposit referred to in clause (a) shall be

(10)

Reserve Bank of India, specify in this behalf.
The Central Government may, if it considers it necessary for
avoiding any hardship or for any other just and sufficient reason
by order issued either prospectively or retrospectively from a date
not earlier than the commencement of the Companies
(Amendment) Act, 1974 (41 of 1974), grant extension of time to a
company or class of companies to comply with, or exempt any
company or class of companies from, all or any of the provisions
of this section either generally or for any specified period subject
to such conditions as may be specified in the order:
Provided that no order under this sub-section shall be
issued in relation to a class of companies except after consultation
with the Reserve Bank of India.]
Where a company has failed to repay any deposit or part thereof
in accordance with the terms and conditions of such deposit, the
Company Law Board may, if it is satisfied, either on its own
motion or on the application of the depositor, that it is necessary
so to do to safeguard the interests of the company, the depositors
or in the public interest, direct, by order, the company to make
repayment of such deposit or part thereof forthwith or within such
time and subject to such conditions as may be specified in the
order:
Provided that the Company Law Board may, before
making any order under this sub-section, give a reasonable
opportunity of being heard to the company and the other persons
interested in the matter.
Whoever fails to comply with any order made by the Company
Law Board under sub-section (9) shall be punishable with
imprisonment which may extend to three years and shall also be
liable to a fine of not less than rupees fifty for every day during
which such noncompliance continues.”

Apart from baldly averring that the civil courts’ jurisdiction in regard to claims

CS(OS) 2497/2000

11 of 13

for return of amounts deposits with companies are barred, the applicant defendant has not
sought to substantiate it in any manner. A textual reading of the provision in Section 58A nowhere bars jurisdiction of this court; such a construction also does not arise out of
necessary implication. The position may have altered due to enactment of the Companies
(Second Amendment) Act, 2002 and introduction of Section 10-GB. Yet, the Tribunal
which has to adjudicate such claims has not been constituted. More importantly, that
provision envisages adjudication of such future claims; the amendment does not bar
adjudication of pending suits, seeking recovery of the amounts deposited, in terms of
Section 58-A. Therefore, this objection, or defense has no merit.
14.

The plaintiff has produced certified copies of the 18 cheques, described in the

previous part of the judgment. It had filed a criminal complaint, alleging commission of
offences under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act due to dishonour of the
said instruments. The certified copies of the return memos concerned are also filed along
with the plaint. The plaintiff avers, in its application filed in 2001, that the originals of
those documents were with the trail court; it has therefore sought leave to file and rely
upon the certified copies of the said documents. It has however, not produced certified
copies of the fixed deposit receipts for the amounts said to be deposited by it; instead, it
has relied upon photocopies to say that the defendant took the amounts in fixed deposit

CS(OS) 2497/2000

12 of 13

and agreed to pay 14% interest.
15.

In view of the above discussion, the court is of opinion that the grounds raised by

the defendant in the application seeking leave to defend do not raise any triable issue. On
the other hand, the plaint and documents produced in its support establish that the
plaintiff has a justified claim to the extent of Rs. 21,15,068.50. However, its claim for
interest is not supported by any valid written agreement, as the original fixed deposit
receipts or certified copies of the said documents are not on the record. However, the
plaintiff would be entitled to pendente lite and future interest @ 10% per annum. For
these reasons,

IA 8103/2005 is liable to be dismissed. The plaintiff is entitled to

summary judgment for the amount of Rs. 21,15,068.50 (Rupees twenty one lakhs, fifteen
thousand and sixty eight, paise fifty only) pendente lite and future interest @ 10% per
annum, and costs.
16.

The suit is decreed with costs, in the above terms; let a decree be drawn.
