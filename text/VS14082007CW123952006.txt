The Petitioner Union of India and others have preferred this

Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to
challenge the order dated 17th June 2002 passed by the Central
W.P(C)No.12395-99.06

Page 1 of 14

Administrative Tribunal (The Tribunal) in O.A. No.2711/2004 whereby
the Tribunal set aside the order dated 17.6.2002 passed by the
Appellate Authority, and further directed the Appellate Authority to
consider the Respondent's appeal by passing a detailed speaking order
within two months. The Appellate Authority had dismissed the
Respondent's appeal preferred against the order of penalty of
dismissal passed by the Disciplinary Authority on 19.10.1995. Further
consequential directions were also issued by the Tribunal while partly
allowing the original application filed by the Respondent.
4.

The facts in brief are that the Respondent was posted as

Junior Engineer in the Office of the Executive Engineer, PWD, ELECT,
DL-DV.9 in the Government of NCT of Delhi. On 17th August 1995, the
Petitioner issued a memorandum to the Respondent proposing to hold
an inquiry under Rule 14 of the C.C.S. (CCA) Rules 1965. The following
articles of charge were framed against the Respondent:
“ARTICLE I
That the said Sh. Narender Kumar, JE is in the
habit of absenting himself from Govt. duty. He
joined this office on his transfer from Executive
Engineer PWD Elect., Divn. 9, Delhi Govt. Delhi
on 27.7.2004 A.N. He attended this office only
for 110 days as per details given below.
1. 27.07.94 to 21.08.94 i.e. 26 days.
2. 06.09.94 to 20.11.94 i.e. 76 days.
3. 03.12.94 to 10.12.94 i.e. 08 days.
Last attended on 10.12.1994.
Since 11.12.1994 he has been absenting
himself without any intimation. His leave
W.P(C)No.12395-99.06

Page 2 of 14

application w.e.f. 12.12.94 to 09.01.95 on
medical ground was received in this office on
12.01.95. His habit of absenting himself without
intimating the office amounts to willful absence
and has thus violated Rule 3(1) (ii) & (iii) of the
C.C.S. (Conduct Rules) 1964.
ARTICLE II
That during the aforesaid period the said Sh.
Narendra Kumar, JE(E) has been written many
letters given in the Annexure-III to resume duty
but he failed to comply with.
ARTICLE III
That Sh. Narender Kumar, JE intimated this
office vide his letter Nil. dt. 19.04.95 that he
had been unable to join due to family
circumstances and would resume duty on
25.04.1995 but he did not turn up till date.
ARTICLE IV
That the said Shri Narendra Kumar, JE(E) has
been given final notice through Newspaper
published in 'The Hindustan Times' on 21.07.95
and 'Nav Bharat Times' on 0.08.95 and copy
sent by Registered/A.D. Post to resume duty
within seven days of publication of this notice
but he failed to comply.”
5.

The petitioner submits that despite the issuance of the said

memorandum the Respondent did not care to even respond to the said
charge sheet. In these circumstances, it is stated, that the Disciplinary
Authority namely S.E. (E) resorted to Rule 19(ii) of the C.C.S. (CCA)
Rules 1965, thereby dispensing with the holding of an inquiry.
6.

A Show Cause Notice bearing No. 7(127)(DCEC/1/E-1/600)

dated 28.9.1995 was issued to the Petitioner to show cause as to why

W.P(C)No.12395-99.06

Page 3 of 14

the penalty of dismissal from service may not be imposed upon him.
The Show Cause Notice was also published in the National daily, the
Hindustan Times on 4.10.1995. The Respondent however failed to
respond even to the said Show Cause Notice. Consequently, the
Disciplinary Authority passed an order of penalty imposing the penalty
of dismissal upon the Respondent on 19.10.1995 with immediate
effect and further directed that the period of his absence from duty
with effect from 11.12.1992 be treated as 'dias-non' for all purposes.
7.

The Respondent, after a gap of nearly six years, preferred

a Departmental Appeal against the order of his dismissal on 15.10.01.
The Appellate Authority i.e. Chief Engineer (Elect)-I CPWD refused to
entertain the appeal on the ground that the same was barred by
limitation, and it did not disclose sufficient cause for not preferring the
appeal in time. This order was passed by the Appellate Authority on
17th January 2002.
8.

Aggrieved

by

the

aforesaid order, the Respondent

preferred the aforesaid Original Application bearing No.2711/2004
before the Tribunal.
9.

Before the Tribunal, the primary ground taken by the

Respondent to impugn the orders of the Disciplinary Authority, as well
as the Appellate Order was that there was non compliance of Rule
19(ii) of the C.C.S. (CCA) Rules 1965, inasmuch as, no reasons had
been recorded in writing by the Disciplinary Authority as to why it was

W.P(C)No.12395-99.06

Page 4 of 14

not reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry in the manner provided in
the Rules, and that there was nothing to show that the Disciplinary
Authority had applied its mind to the circumstances of the case to
conclude that the holding of the formal inquiry under Rule 14 is not
reasonably practicable and the same should be dispensed with.
10.

On the other hand, the Petitioner at the threshold raised

the objection that the order of the Disciplinary Authority had merged in
the order of the Appellate Authority and that the Appellate Authority
had rejected the appeal on the ground of limitation. The Petitioner also
denied having received any application for revision, as was claimed to
have been submitted by the Respondent.
11.

The Tribunal recognised the position that the Respondent's

appeal was beyond the period of limitation. The Tribunal also did not
accept the Respondent's submission that he had preferred a revision
petition. However, the Tribunal, despite the aforesaid finding with
regard to the bar of limitation in preferring of the Departmental
Appeal, proceeded to consider the Respondent's submission based on
Rule 19(ii) of the C.C.S. (CCA) Rules 1965 and passed the impugned
order setting aside the appellate order dated 17.6.2002 on the ground
that no reasons have been recorded by the Disciplinary Authority in his
order to justify his conclusion that it was not reasonably practicable to
hold an inquiry in the manner provided in the Rules.
12.

Having heard learned counsel for the parties and given our

W.P(C)No.12395-99.06

Page 5 of 14

due consideration to the matter, we are of the view that the Tribunal
has erred in interfering with the appellate order dated 17.6.2002
whereby the Departmental Appeal of the Respondent was rejected on
the ground of limitation.
13.

In paragraph 4 of the impugned order, the Tribunal

recorded the submissions of the Petitioner herein which are based on
the record, and with which there is no serious dispute. Since the same
is of relevance, we set out relevant portion of para 4 of the impugned

order which reads as follows:
“4. On the other hand, learned counsel for
respondents stated that applicant joined Elect.
Division-II on 27.7.94. Vide registered letter
dated 27.1.95 EE(E)-ED-II asked the applicant
why he had not intimated to the office about his
illness and why he had not obtained the
treatment from Government Hospital and had
remained absent from office without obtaining
leave. Then, letters dated 6.3.1995, 7.3.1995,
4.4.95, 28.4.95 and 22.5.95 were sent to the
applicant informing him of his unauthorized
absence and asking him to report for duty. By a
letter dated 19.4.95, applicant had informed
that he would join his duty on 25.4.95 but he
did not do so. Finally press notices were
published on 19.7.95 both in Hindi and English,
asking the applicant to report for duty within a
week's time of the notices. Copies of these
letters were sent by registered AD to the two
known
addresses
of
the
applicant.
Acknowledged receipts whereof are in the file.
When neither any response was received from
the applicant nor did he report for duty, the said
charge sheet was issued against him at both
the known addresses. The acknowledgment of
the receipt of the charge sheet was also there
in record.”

Despite

being

served

with

the

charge

sheet,

the

Respondent neither gave a written reply, nor sought a personal
hearing in the matter. In the aforesaid factual background, the
Disciplinary Authority issued a Show Cause Notice dated 28.9.1995
requiring the Respondent to show cause as to why the penalty of
dismissal of service may not be imposed upon him. Even this Show
Cause Notice was published in the National daily, Hindustan Times on
4th

October

1995.

Consequently,

the

Disciplinary

Authority

19.10.1995 passed the following order:
“CENTRAL PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT

continuous unauthorized absence from date

justice will be met with, if the penalty of
dismissal from services of Central Public Works
Department is imposed upon him. He was
accordingly issued a Show Cause Notice
No.7(127)(DCEC/1/E-1/600 dated 28.9.95 as to
why the penalty of dismissal from service may
not be imposed upon him. The Show Cause

15.

Having itself noticed the admitted position that the appeal

preferred by the Respondent was beyond limitation, the Tribunal ought
W.P(C)No.12395-99.06

Page 8 of 14

not to have interfered with the same by going into the merits of the
case. The Tribunal was examining the correctness of the Appellate
Order, which only raised the point of limitation. The only question that
arose for the consideration of the Tribunal was whether the Appellate
Authority was justified in not entertaining the respondents appeal on
account of the bar of limitation, and whether there was disclosure of
sufficient cause by the respondent to justify the highly belated filing of
the appeal. Only if the Tribunal had found that the Appellate Order
was laconic on this aspect of the matter, could it have set it aside and
remanded the matter back for reconsideration by the Appellate
Authority.
16.

It appears that no serious attempt was made by the

Respondent either to urge that the Departmental Appeal was preferred
within the period of limitation, or that he had disclosed sufficient cause
for the delay in preferring of the Departmental Appeal to be condoned.
The Tribunal without even dealing with the aforesaid aspect of
limitation, and without upsetting the Appellate Order on that score,
straightaway proceeded to consider the other submission of the
Respondent founded upon Rule 19(ii) of the C.C.S. (CCA) Rules 1965,
which was, in our view, not permissible.
17.

In LIC v. Jyotish Chandra Biswas, (2000) 6 SCC 562, the

Respondent was proceeded against departmentally and dismissed
from service on 28.1.1969. He challenged the same by filing a writ

W.P(C)No.12395-99.06

Page 9 of 14

petition on 25.3.1975. The learned Single Judge dismissed the petition
on merits and also on the ground of unreasonable delay and laches in
approaching the court.

However, the Division Bench allowed the

appeal on the ground that the Respondents/employees right of appeal
had been taken away due to the fact that the penalty order had been
passed by the Appellate Authority instead of the Disciplinary Authority.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court overruled the decision of the Division
Bench by observing that the writ petition had been filed, challenging
the order of termination, almost after a period of six years for which
there was no explanation. The Respondent sought for his reemployment after almost five years of his dismissal. This only
indicates that he had accepted the order of termination of his services,
if not expressly, impliedly.
18.

We may notice that the aforesaid was a case, where the

delay and laches pertained to the filing of a writ petition under Article
226 of Constitution of India, for which there is no prescribed period of
limitation. As opposed to that situation, in the present case, there is a
prescribed/statutory period of limitation contained in Rule 25 of the
CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965. The said Rule prescribe a period of limitation
of 45 days for filing an appeal from the date on which a copy of the
order appealed against is delivered to the appellant. The said Rule
reads as follows:
“25. Period of limitation of appeals

W.P(C)No.12395-99.06

Page 10 of 14

No appeal preferred under this part shall be
entertained unless such appeal is preferred
within a period of forty-five days from the date
on which a copyof the order appealed against is
delivered to the appellant:
Provided that the Appellate Authority may
entertain the appeal after the expiry of the said
period, if it is satisfied that the appellant had
sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal in
time.”
19.

We note that Rule 25 begins with the words “No appeal

preferred under this part shall be enteretained unless such appeal is
preferred within a period of forty five days...”.
20.

The clause is worded negatively and therefore calls for a

strict interpretation.

Consequently, the ratio of Jyoti Chandra

Biswas (Supra) applies with even greater force to the facts of the
present case.
21.
before

We have also examined the averments made in the O.A.
the

Tribunal,

and

the

counter

affidavit

filed

in

those

proceedings to satisfy ourselves if the respondent had disclosed any
explanation for the inordinate delay in preferring his appeal before the
Appellate Authority. It appears that the respondent had claimed that
he reported in his office to join duties after 22nd May, 1995 after he
was threatened with disciplinary action, but he was turned away on
the ground that he had been suspended from service. However, no
suspension order was filed by the respondent. In this O.A., he further
claimed that he did not learn of any developments in the enquiry

W.P(C)No.12395-99.06

Page 11 of 14

proceedings, though he says in his statutory appeal dated 15.10.2001
that he came to know that charge sheet in the matter was framed
under Rule 14 of the CCS (CCA) Rules 1965 and inquiry was ordered
to be held against him.

However, he does not say how and when he

learnt of the inquiry proceedings.

He states that he, vide his letter

dated 3.8.1999, he demanded all the documents related to the case,
i.e., the charge sheet enquiry report and final order passed by the
competent authority to enable him to make an appeal to the Appellate
Authority. He says that a copy of the charge sheet and termination
order was made available, but he misplaced the same. He states that
he sent reminders on 4.2.2000 and 7.6.2000 which were not replied.
He

claims

that

then

he

personally

visited

the

office

of

the

Superintendent Engineer (E), Delhi Central Elect. Circle No.-1, CPWD,
New Delhi. He states that he could lay his hands on a photocopy of
the order of penalty dated 19.10.1995 on 30.3.2001 after making
concerted efforts and thereafter the appeal was filed.
22.

The petitioner herein refuted the aforesaid averments in

their counter affidavit before the Tribunal.

It was denied that the

respondent was placed under suspension. The petitioner also denied
having received any communications dated 4.2.2000 or 7.6.2000 from
the respondent.

The petitioner also stated that the penalty order

dated 19.10.1995 was not only published in the news paper, but even
sent by Regd. A.D. Post.

W.P(C)No.12395-99.06

The petitioner also denies any personal

Page 12 of 14

contact by the respondent.
23.

It appears the the respondent, to explain his continued

absence concocted a plea of having been suspended. If he had been
suspended, there would have been an order to that effect.

The

communications the respondent claims to have sent after his dismissal
are also without any proof of delivery.

The petitioners denied on

solemn affirmation, having received them. We are inclined to believe
the petitioners' statement on oath since no malafides have been
alleged or made out, and there was no reason for the petitioner to
have suppressed the receipt of the communications allegedly sent by
the respondent, had the same been sent in fact.
24.

Even according to the respondent's version he had got a

copy of the penalty order in 1998. Yet he did not prefer an appeal at
that stage.

The statements made by the respondent to explain the

inordinate delay in filing the departmental appeal are most vague and
devoid of particulars and unconvincing.
25.

To us, it appears that the Respondent had accepted his

dismissal from service in October 1995 and, much later, after six years
decided to challenge the same by preferring a statutory appeal, which
was not permissible in the facts of this case.
26.

In view of the aforesaid, the approach of the Tribunal in

brushing aside the ground on which the Respondent's Departmental
Appeal was not entertained was erroneous.

W.P(C)No.12395-99.06

Page 13 of 14

27.

For the reasons aforesaid, we quash and set aside the

impugned order passed by the Tribunal in O.A. No.2711/2004 dated
16.1.2006 and resultantly dismiss the O.A. bearing No.2711/2004 filed
by the Respondent in the Tribunal.
No costs.
