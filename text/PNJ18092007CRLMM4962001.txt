PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (ORAL)
1.
Petitioner is impleaded as an accused in a complaint filed by
the Directorate of Revenue Enforcement under Section 56 of
FERA read with Regulation 9 (1)(f) and Regulation 8(1) of the
Foreign Exchange Regulations, 1973.
2.

Petitioner seeks quashing of the prosecution on the sole

ground of inordinate delay.

It may be noted that except for 3

witnesses of the prosecution even pre-charge evidence has not
been completed by the prosecution. Thus, charge has yet to be
framed.
3.

It may additionally be noted that as per the petitioner the

main actor, Shri B.B.Kuttappa, impleaded as accused No.7, has

since died.
4.

Before noting certain decisions on the issue as to when can

a prosecution be quashed on ground of inordinate delay, relevant
facts may be noted.
5.

The

complaint

aforenoted

was

filed

Cognizance thereof was taken on same day.

on

21.2.1986.

Accused were

summoned for 23.4.1986. Thereafter, on various dates different
persons impleaded as accused were served.

Service was

completed by 29.7.1987. For unexplainable reasons matter was
adjourned from time to time till the year 1991 was reached.
6.

Order dated 10.12.1991 gives a clue as to why the

prosecution took no steps to lead pre-charge evidence.

Order

dated 10.12.1991 records the prayer of the accused to be
supplied with documents and the response of the public
prosecutor that since record was voluminous, accused can inspect
the same in the office of the complainant.
7.

Accused promptly carried out the necessary inspection

evidenced by the fact that in no order subsequent to 10.12.1991
has it been recorded that the accused desired further inspection.
8.

After 10.12.1991 matter was listed on 18.5.1992 and

6.8.1992.

The matter was simply adjourned on said dates.

14.12.1992 was notified for pre-charge evidence. No witness of
the prosecution was present. Matter was adjourned to 15.4.1993.
On said date, once again no witness of the prosecution was

present.

Matter was adjourned to 1.11.1993.

Once again, no

witness of the prosecution being present matter was adjourned to
8.4.1994.
9.

On 8.4.1994 hearing could not be held as lawyers had

suspended work. Matter was adjourned to 19.8.1994.
10.

On said date accused No.7, B.B.Kuttappa did not appear.

Learned Judge issued bailable warrants to secure his presence.
On next date notified, i.e. 27.8.1994 it was reported that
B.B.Kuttappa had died. The Public Prosecutor wanted to verify the
correctness of the report submitted by the concerned SHO to the
effect that B.B.Kuttappa had died.
11.

Orders passed post 27.8.1994 till 6.10.1998 show that the

prosecution got the matter adjourned stating that they were yet
to verify whether report pertaining to B.B.Kuttappa was correct or
not.
12.

On 6.10.1998, a newspaper cutting dated 18.6.1994 of

Hindustan Times was filed by co-accused persons to evidence
that B.B.Kuttappa had died. In spite thereof, the prosecution took
time to verify whether B.B.Kuttappa had died or not.
13.

Further time to verify the death of Kuttappa was taken by

the prosecution on 11.1.1999, 17.2.1999 and 26.7.1999.

14.

On 30.11.1999, learned Metropolitan Magistrate noted that

the prosecution had still not got verified whether B.B.Kuttappa

had died or not.
learned

However, in view of the newspaper cutting,

Metropolitan

Magistrate

treated

as

correct

the

information that B.B.Kuttappa had died. Matter was adjourned to
19.5.2000 for prosecution evidence.
15.

Once again started the story of adjournments save and

except on 27.2.2001 when PW-1, Arun Sharma,
Director (Enforcement) was examined.

Assistant

Thereafter, PW-2 was

examined on 6.10.2006.
16.

From a perusal of the orders passed by the learned M.M. it is

apparent that a totally unprepared and ungeared prosecution was
just not interested in pursuing the complaint with any sense of
purpose or diligence.
17.

Evidenced by the fact that nearly 5 years were consumed to

verify whether B.B.Kuttappa had died or not is proof of the
lackadaisical approach of the prosecution.
18.

What is painful for this court is to note the stand of the

prosecution in its reply filed to the aforenoted petition. In para 6
it has been pleaded as under :“6. It is most respectfully submitted that if there is
any delay in the matter the same is not attributable to
the respondent only. Even otherwise court of Ld.
ACMM, New Delhi is overburdened. Lengthy crossexamination are done. More then five thousand cases
are pending before the Ld.ACMM, New Delhi and it is
generally impossible for any presiding officer of the
Court of ACMM, New Delhi to expeditiously dispose of
these cases in view of the lengthy cross-examinations
done by the defence lawyers on behalf of the accused
persons. Hence the delay, if any, is on account of the
fact that the judicial system as such is unable to take

19.

that much of load as much has been burdened upon it,
consequently, neither the respondents nor the Courts
are to be blamed for any delay.”
According to the prosecution delay takes place because the

courts of Metropolitan Magistrates in Delhi are over burdened.
That the judicial system is unable to take so much load.
20.

Who is responsible for the burden?

21.

Judicial pronouncements reported in various judicial reports

are replete with decisions wherein complaints have been quashed
on technical grounds.

Further, huge volume of case law exists

where complaints have been quashed on the ground that
notwithstanding accused persons being absolved in departmental
adjudicatory proceedings criminal prosecutions are still being
pursued and that no useful purpose would be served in continuing
with the criminal prosecution based on same set of facts.
22.

The Directorate of Enforcement has to take a blame for the

reason,

without

any

application

of

mind,

all

and

sundry

complaints are being filed.
23.

As in the instant case, evidenced by the order dated

10.12.1991, even documents are not filed along with the
complaints and the accused persons are left to inspect the record
of the Directorate of Enforcement. In the pre-charge evidence,
this mirrors in the departmental witnesses either not being
present or seeking adjournments on the ground that relevant
record, being voluminous, was either not brought or was not
traceable.

24.

I hope and expect that the Directorate of Enforcement

would set its house in order.

The department would be fully

geared before filing a complaint.
25.

In the instant case, a complaint filed in the year 1986 is still

languishing at pre-charge stage in the year 2007. 21 years have
gone by.
26.

Speedy trial has been read into Article 21 of the Constitution

of India as an essential part of the fundamental right to life and
liberty guaranteed under the Constitution of India.
27.

Indeed, right to a speedy trial is a part of fair, just and

reasonable procedure implicit in Article 21 of the Constitution of
India.
28.

Rather than quoting from various judicial pronouncements,

where on account of delay prosecution has been quashed, I
propose to index the same as under :S.No Name of Case Law

From the facts noted above it is apparent that the accused

persons have not contributed to the delay. But I would be failing
if I do not note the decision of the Supreme Court reported as AIR
1981 SC 641 State of Bihar Vs. Uma Shanker where the Supreme
Court quashed a belated prosecution even when accused
themselves were responsible in a large measure for the slow pace
of the case.
30.

The petition is allowed. I quash the proceedings pending

against the petitioner pertaining to the complaint filed by the
respondent, copy whereof has been annexed as Annexure-A to
the petition.
31.

Needless to state, the bail bond and the surety bond filed by

the petitioner stand discharged.
32.

LCR be returned.

33.

No costs.
