JUDGMENT

1.

This writ petition filed on 5.10.1996 seeks direction to the

Municipal Corporation of Delhi ('MCD') to grant, sanction and
energise a load of

21.26KW in the name of the petitioner in their

premises on the ground floor 17, Local Shopping Centre, Pushp Vihar,
New Delhi. By an order dated 2.8.2006, the MCD was permitted to be
substituted by B.S.E.S. Rajdhani Power Ltd.

2.

The facts leading to the filing of the writ petition are that the

land over which the property bearing No. 17, Local Shopping Centre,
Pushp

Vihar,

New

Delhi

(hereafter

‘the

said

property’)

was

constructed was originally sold by the Delhi Development Authority
('DDA') to M/s. Capricorn Industries Ltd., Respondent No.2, for the

W.P.(C) 3867/1996

page1 of 11

purposes of construction of shops and offices. The DDA sanctioned
the plan for construction of the building by Respondent No.2.

It

granted on 6.8.1987 an occupancy certificate in respect of the said
building certifying that the construction was in accordance with law.
A temporary electricity connection was granted by the MCD.

3.

The ground floor of the building was sold by way of three

agreements dated 1.3.1988 to the petitioner, Mrs. Anu Chopra and
Baby Sakshi Chopra respectively. By further agreements dated
29.3.1993. the petitioner purchased the rights, title and interest from
Mrs. Anu Chopra and Baby Sakshi Chopra and consequently became
the owner in possession in respect of the entire ground floor of the
said property measuring 1607 square feet.

4.

For the grant of a temporary connection and a permanent

connection for the ground floor portion purchased by it, the petitioner
paid to Respondent No.2 certain sums of money.

Simultaneously,

same time around October 1991 the petitioner also made an
application to the Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking ('DESU')
(whose successor in interest is B.S.E.S. Rajdhani Power Ltd.) for grant
of a permanent electricity connection in its name. It is stated that the
Respondent No.2 did not take steps to provide copies of the electricity
bills that had been raised by DESU on Respondent No.2, which were
required by the DESU for granting permanent connection to the
petitioner.

The petitioner states that it commenced use of the

property on 29.11.1991.

Since it had no permanent connection of

electricity or even a temporary connection, it began using generators
to meet its requirements.

5.

On 1.9.1992 a raid was conducted on plot Nos. 16 and 17 Local

Shopping Centre, Pushp Vihar, New Delhi, both of which were
constructed by Respondent No.2 herein. The circumstances under
which the raid was conducted is explained in the counter affidavit
dated 26.2.1997 filed by DESU in these proceedings. Para 2 of the
said affidavit reads as under:

“That, when the building was under construction, the
party, respondent No.2, had a running consumption bill
of Rs.2,82,108.05 paisa. Besides the above, a raid was
conducted on 1.9.1992 by the Vigilance Team at plot
Nos. 16 & 17, Local Shopping Centre, Madangir, New
Delhi. It was found that the two meters installed at the
premises were burnt and the consumer was consuming
electricity

directly from the mains.

As such, the

consumer was liable to pay the actual consumption
charges i.e. Rs.2,82,108.05 paisa as well charges on
account of theft of electricity. As against the consumption
charges, respondent No.2 made a request to the Director
(EDP) that he be allowed to make payment in

two

installments,

the

which

request

was

granted

but

respondent No.2 made the payment of Rs.1,42,000.00 on
3.5.1993 out of Rs. 2,82,108.05 paisa of the consumption
bill. Another theft bill for a sum of Rs. 16,74,106.92 upto
the due date and a sum of Rs. 17,09,768.87 paisa after
the due date was to be paid by the respondent No.2..”

6.

The petitioner has annexed to the writ petition a copy of the

inspection report dated 1.9.1992. The said report states that when the
inspection team visited both premises on 1.9.1992, it found that total
connected load was 54.28 KW. The material portion of the said report
reads as under:

“4.

In the premises two meters were found installed

and both of them were burnt.
W.P.(C) 3867/1996

5.

One of the two meters, M No.4E 8805461 was

totally burnt and glass was found missing. Two 1/2 seals
were missing and the monogram of one existing 1/ 2 seal
was not clear. The service cable, which was feeding to
this meter found disconnected from the feeder pillar as
well as from meter terminal.

6.

Other Meter No. 4C-958206 was also found burnt

and smoky.

Reading was not visible. The seals of this

meter were of MDI monogram. When this meter got
issued by the inspector needs immediate confirmation as
dial no., year of sealing the meter is not clearly visible.
The case regarding the seals will be decided.

7.

The inspection report also refers to the fact that a photographer

was arranged to take photographs of the site. In the report, the joint
team recommended

“disconnecting the supply as well as removal

service line for handing over to the police immediately.” As
recommended by the inspection team an FIR came to be lodged for
theft of electricity, which resulted in a criminal case being registered
against the Petitioner herein. This criminal case ultimately ended in
the acquittal of the petitioner.

W.P.(C) 3867/1996

8.

The DESU in its said counter affidavit further explained that

unless the outstanding amount of both the actual consumption
charges as well as the theft bill were paid “by the individual seeking
connections in the building, fresh connection cannot be granted.” It
was also stated in the said counter affidavit as under:
“Merely because respondent No.2 is giving a no objection
in favour of the petitioner does not give him a right to get
a permanent connection as the respondent No.2, who
was the owner of the building and from whom the
building has allegedly been purchased by the petitioner,
has to clear the dues of DESU and until and unless DESU
dues are cleared, no permanent connection can be
allowed.”

9.

Mr. Arvind Nigam, learned counsel for the petitioner submits

that petitioner has maintained throughout that it has nothing to do
with the theft of electricity, which even as per the inspection report,
related entirely to plot No. 16 Local Shopping Centre and not Plot No.
17 in which the petitioner is occupying the ground floor. In particular
it is pointed out that the inspection report talks of 2 meters. Meter
No. 4E 8805461 pertained to plot No. 17 and in respect of this meter
the service cable was found disconnected “from the feeder pillar as
well as from the meter terminal.” As regards the other Meter No. 4C958206 pertaining to plot No. 16, while the service line was found
disconnected from the meter terminal, “one phase of this cable was
directly connected to consumer wiring along with neutral wire and the
same phase wire and neutral wire were also connected with the
feeder pillar connection.” It is submitted that the so called theft of
electricity pertains only to the consumers in plot No.16. It is urged
that the statement in the said report which reads: “hence the
consumers were using the supply without metering after directly

W.P.(C) 3867/1996

page5 of 11

connecting with cable connection directly from DESU system.......”,
can only refer to those consumers occupying plot No.16. The
submission is that since the petitioner was not in plot No.16 at all, the
alleged theft of electricity cannot be attributed to it. Counsel for the
petitioner further points out that the photographs in question also do
not indicate that there were any cable leads going from the meter at
plot No. 16 into the premises at plot No. 17. He further submits that
petitioner is accordingly not liable to pay the theft bill and such
payment cannot be made a precondition for grant of a permanent
electricity connection to the petitioner.

10.

On behalf of Respondent No.1 B.S.E.S. Rajdhani Power Ltd., Mr.

Jayant Nath, Senior Advocate first submits that the petitioner’s case
that it commenced occupying the premises in question only on
26.11.1991, is not substantiated by any independent material. He
submits that it is inconceivable that having purchased the said
property in 1988 itself, the petitioner did not occupy it till 1991. He
casts doubts on whether the petitioner was using any generator as
stated by it since again there was nothing to substantiate this
statement as well. As regards the inspection report of 1.9.1992 and
the photographs taken at that point in time, Mr. Nath does not dispute
that there is no specific mention in the said report of the theft by the
petitioner. He also does not dispute that the photographs do not show
that the wires from the meter in Plot No. 16 were connected to any of
the installed equipments in the premises of the petitioner in plot No.
17.

However, he refers to Annexure R-2 to an additional affidavit

dated 27.5.1997 filed by DESU, which is a typed copy of the “record
of inspection” prepared on the same date i.e. 1.9.992. This contains
the signatures of the inspection team.

W.P.(C) 3867/1996

It indicates that there were

at

Nos.

16-17

Local

Shopping

Centre:

M/s.R.K.Associates, Gulcon Tech Services, M/s.Sanvik (the petitioner
herein), and in the basement, M/s. House of

Furniture.

Mr. Nath

submits that this record of inspection clearly names the petitioner, as
indulging in theft of electricity and therefore the petitioner is liable to
pay the theft bill. Mr. Nath submits that although the petitioner may
have been acquitted by the criminal court that cannot determine
whether in fact the petitioner indulged in theft since the standard of
proof for the purpose of determining theft of electricity for the
purposes of billing cannot be as high as that of a criminal case; it
should proceed on preponderance of probabilities. He finally submits
that the petitioner has not specifically challenged the theft bill and
therefore the correctness of the theft bill ought not to be examined by
the Court.

11.

The principal issue in the present case is whether the petitioner

is liable for theft of electricity and consequently, is the B.S.E.S.
Rajdhani Power Ltd. justified in not granting a permanent connection
to the petitioner on that score. The record of inspection, a typed copy
of which is produced as Annexure R-2, does not actually state that the
petitioner’s equipments were connected to the meter at plot No. 16.
That vital piece of information is neither in the inspection report dated
1.9.1992, the portions of which have been extracted hereinabove, nor
in the typed copy of the record of inspection. Admittedly, the
photographs taken at the time of inspection also do not bear this out.
Therefore, even if one were to accept the typed copy to be a true copy
of the original [which must have been hand written but is unable to be
produced by Respondent No. 1], the record of inspection does not
establish that the equipment in the premises of the petitioner at Plot

W.P.(C) 3867/1996

page7 of 11

No. 17 were connected to the meter at Plot No. 16. In fact the record
of inspection probabilises the fact that the petitioner was probably
running these equipments on its premises by using generators.

12.

The petitioner in its rejoinder to DESU’s additional affidavit

dated 27.5.1997 has pointed out that Respondent No.2, the previous
owner, has in his affidavit disclosed the list of occupants of Plot Nos.
16 and 17. The petitioner was the only person who did not occupy
premises in both Plot Nos. 16 & 17 whereas all others occupied
premises in both the plots. As regards the criminal case, the judgment
dated 2.8.2003 passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate in Case No.
496/2 arising out of FIR No. 442/1992 (State v. Vijay Chopra)
indicates that after examining the evidence it came to the following
conclusion:
“It has also come on record that entrance of building No.
16 and 17 were separate.

Therefore, there is no

evidence that the supply of electricity, which was being
used in the entire building was going in the portions
belonging to Sanvik Engineering Pvt. Ltd or House of
Furnishing. There is no evidence on record that
members of the team had checked the fact that
whether

supply

was

particularly

going

to

the

portion of House of Furnishing and M/s. Sanvik
Engineering Pvt. Ltd. on the date of raid. Even if it
is accepted that PW-1 Y.L. Madan had gone on dated
2.9.1992 for removal of case property and had checked
the fact that as to whether supply was going to the entire
building or not and had found that the supply was going
to the entire building, it cannot be said that supply was
being used by Sanvik Engineering Pvt. Ltd. and House of
Furnishing because there is no evidence on record
that these offices were running along with their
businesses activities on the said date.

Therefore, I

am of the considered opinion that prosecution has failed
W.P.(C) 3867/1996

page8 of 11

to prove the fact that use of the energy as found by the
members of the team on dated 1.9.1992 was being used
by Sanvik Engineering Pvt. Ltd and House of Furnishing
either on dated 1.9.1992 or 2.9.1992 because there is no
such evidence on record.”(emphasis supplied)

13.

As regards the submission that the petitioner’s case of non-use

of the premises till November, 1991 was unbelievable, it must be
noticed that it is not the case of Respondent No.1 that any bill raised
on the premises at Plot No. 17 during this period remained unpaid.
Therefore, it is difficult to appreciate how this issue is relevant for
determining whether the petitioner indulged in theft of electricity
from the meter at plot No. 16.

It is for the Respondent No.1 to

positively prove this fact, which it clearly has failed to do.

14.

The other submission of Mr. Nath that the theft bill has not itself

been challenged by the petitioner has only to be stated to be rejected.
It is not denied that non payment of the theft bill was the only reason
for

the

petitioner

not

being

granted

a

permanent

electricity

connection. Therefore, the petitioner is within its rights, and within
the scope of present writ petition, to challenge this ground of
rejection

of

the

petitioner's

request

for

permanent

electricity

connection.

15.

On a consideration of the above facts and circumstances, and

the evidence placed on record, the only probable conclusion that can
be drawn is that Respondent No.1 has failed to show, even on a
preponderance of probabilities, that the petitioner indulged in any
theft of electricity from either the meter installed at plot No.16 or at
Plot No. 17. In that view of the matter the petitioner cannot be made
liable for the theft bill.
W.P.(C) 3867/1996

page9 of 11

16.

The theft bill of Rs 16.74 lakhs was, pursuant to what transpired

in the course of these proceedings on 13.5.1997 and 26.5.1997,
bifurcated and a sum of Rs. 7,60,597.84 shown due from the
petitioner. In the absence of any proof of theft of electricity by the
petitioner, the said theft bill in the sum of Rs.7,60,597.84 against the
petitioner is hereby quashed.

17.

Lastly, the question of the consequential relief that is required

to be granted to petitioner. During the pendency of this petition by an
Order dated 2.8.2006, the electricity connection to the petitioner was
directed to be reenergised. The Court is informed that this order has
been complied with.

Therefore as on today, the petitioner has an

electricity connection at its premises. It is also stated that as regards
actual consumption charges pertaining to plot No. 17, Respondent
No.2 had already paid to DESU a sum of Rs. 1,42,000/- pursuant to an
Order of this Court. The petitioner was directed to deposit a sum of
Rs. 1,35,000/- towards this balance in regards the bill of actual
consumption, which it has.

18.

While Mr. Nigam submits that even this amount of Rs. 1.35 lakh

is refundable to petitioner, Mr. Jayant Nath places reliance upon the
judgment of this Court in Madhu Garg v. NDPL 2006 (IV) AD 667,
Del to contend that the succeeding owner of the premises would in
any way be liable for the electricity dues ratable to the premises, even
if it is on account of misuser of electricity by the preceding owner.
This Court finds the stand of
correct.

the respondent on this count to be

It is accordingly held that the petitioner would not be

entitled to seek a refund of Rs. 1,35,000/- on account of the above

W.P.(C) 3867/1996

page10 of 11

settled position in law.

19.

Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed with the following

directions:
(a)

The Respondent will treat the electricity connection given to the

petitioner already as a permanent electricity connection and raise
bills on that basis.

The petitioner will continue paying the current

charges without default.
(b)

The petitioner is not liable for any theft of electricity as alleged

by Respondent No. 1 on the basis of the inspection report of 1.9.1992.
Consequently the theft bill in the sum of Rs.7,60,597.84 raised against
the petitioner is hereby quashed.
(c)

The sum of Rs.1.35 lakhs already paid

by the petitioner to

Respondent No.1 will be taken as a full discharge in any previous
liability in relation to the petitioner’s premises at Plot No. 17, Local
Shopping Centre, Pushp Vihar as evidenced by the bill of actual
consumption in the sum of Rs.2,82,108.25 as on 1.9.1992. No further
amount will be demanded from the petitioner on this ground.
(d)

The Respondent will pay to the petitioner within four weeks

from today, the costs of this petition which is fixed at Rs.10,000/-.

20.

The writ petition is allowed with the above directions.
