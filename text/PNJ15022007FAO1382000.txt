1.

The 2 captioned appeals arise out of the same accident

involving a bus No.DEP-4480 in which the deceased was
travelling as a passenger.
2.

Deceased, Shri Jai Kishan, who was travelling as a

passenger in the bus No.DEP-4480 died when the bus met with
a road accident on 1.12.1988.
3.

Dependants of the deceased filed a claim petition before

the MACT seeking compensation on account of death of the
deceased in the said road accident.
4.

Defence raised by the insurance company was that the

policy issued in respect of bus was a statutory policy and as per
Section 95(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 as deceased was a
passenger in the bus at the time of the accident, its liability
under the policy was limited to the extent of Rs.15,000/- only .
5.

After considering the evidence on record pertaining to the

accident and holding that the accident in question was caused
due to rash and negligent driving by the driver of the bus no.
DEP-4480, learned Tribunal awarded a compensation of Rs.
4,89,600/- to the dependents of the deceased. Defence of the
insurance company that the policy in question was a statutory
policy and that its liability under the policy was limited to the
FAO 138/00

Page No. 2 of 14

extent of Rs.15,000/- was rejected by the learned Tribunal. The
liability of the insurance company under the policy was held to
be unlimited.
6.

FAO No.138/2000 is an appeal under Section 173, Motor

Vehicles Act, 1988 filed by the insurance company challenging
the award dated 29.1.2000 insofar it determines that the
liability of the insurance company under the policy is unlimited.
7.

Learned Counsel for the appellant/insurance company

submitted that the Tribunal has erred in not restricting the
liability of the insurance company to Rs.15,000/- only.
8.

Learned counsel for the appellant relied upon testimony of

Bhajan Singh, Asstt. Manager, Oriental Insurance Co., R3W1 in
support of his contention that the liability of the insurance
company is limited to the extent of Rs.15,000/-.
9.

Bhajan Singh, R3W1 produced a photocopy of a cover note

(Mark A), policy of insurance (Mark C) and receipt of premium
(Mark B) and deposed that the said copies were true copies of
the original cover note, receipt and policy respectively issued in
respect of bus no. DEP-4480. He also produced a certificate (Ex.
R3W1/1) and deposed that said certificate certifies that
photocopies of policy and cover note produced by him are true
FAO 138/00

Page No. 3 of 14

copies of the original cover note and policy issued by the
insurance company in respect of offending bus. He further
deposed that the said cover note (Mark A) produced by him
shows that the insurance company had charged a premium of
Rs. 612/- for 51 passengers i.e. Rs.12/- per passenger. The said
witness also produced a copy of the Indian Motor Tariff (Ex.
R3W1/2) and deposed that the Tariff shows that premium of
Rs.12/- is required to be charged by the Insurance Company to
cover the statutory liability of Rs.15,000/- per passenger.
10.

Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the

Tribunal failed to appreciate the testimony of the Bhajan Singh,
R3W1 which according to the learned counsel clearly proved
that the policy issued by the insurance company was a statutory
policy. He further contended that in absence of any evidence to
show that an extra premium was charged by the insurance
company to cover risk to a larger extent, the learned Tribunal
erred in holding that the liability of the insurance company is
unlimited.
11.

The question is whether Bhajan Singh, R3W1 successfully

proved that the cover note (Mark A) and policy (Mark C)

FAO 138/00

Page No. 4 of 14

produced by him are the true copies of the original cover note
and policy issued by the insurance company.
12.

While dealing with the issue of the liability of the insurance

company, learned Tribunal has considered the testimony of
Bhajan Singh, R3W1. The reasoning given by the Tribunal in
holding that the liability of insurance company is unlimited is as
under:

13.

'Similarly in the present case, the Insurance Co. has
produced only the photocopies of the cover note and
insurance policy and they have neither produced the
original nor the carbon copy of the office copy which
was skept by them but stated that they have been
destroyed. Further they did not produce any order
regarding the destruction of documents by any officer
of the Insurance Co. Therefore, the evidence of the
respondent No.3 and 7 regarding their limited liability
could not be proved by them. Therefore, this issue is
decided against the respondent No.3 and 7 and in
favour of the petitioners.'
I have perused the testimony of Bhajan Singh, R3W1.

14.

Bhajan Singh, R3W1 admitted in cross-examination that

said cover note (Mark A) and policy (Mark C) were not prepared
by him but were prepared by one Sh. D.K. Gupta, Development
Officer who is still working in the insurance company. He further
stated that he had no personal knowledge regarding the original
cover note and policy issued by the insurance company.

FAO 138/00

Page No. 5 of 14

15.

I fail to understand as to why Mr D.K. Gupta who had

prepared the original cover note and policy was not produced by
the insurance company.
16.

Bhajan Singh, R3W1 on basis of Indian Motor Tariff (Ex.

R3W1/2) had deposed that a premium of Rs.12/- is required to
be charged by the Insurance Company to cover the statutory
liability of Rs.15,000/- per passenger. But later in crossexamination, he stated that at the time of the issuance of the
policy in question, premium payable for issuing the Act only
policy was Rs.200/-. He thus contradicted his earlier statement.
17.

Cover note (Mark A) produced by Bhajan Singh, R3W1

shows that a premium of Rs. 512/- was charged by the insurance
company for 51 passengers i.e. Rs. 12/- per passenger. While
policy (Mark C) and receipt of premium (Mark B) produced by
the same witness shows that a premium of Rs. 951/- was
charged by the insurance company.
18.

Certificate (Ex. RW1/1) produced by Bhajan Singh, R3W1

cannot be relied upon for the reason that said certificate was
prepared on 12.2.96 i.e. much after the accident in question
which took place on 1.12.1988.

FAO 138/00

Page No. 6 of 14

19.

As regards insurance companyâ€™s failure to produce original

policy and other records pertaining to issue of insurance cover in
respect of offending bus, Bhajan Singh, R3W1 deposed that the
original records were destroyed. The cover note (Mark A) and
the policy (Mark C) produced by R3W1 show that policy in
respect of offending bus was issued on 25.8.1988. Accident in
question took place on 1.12.1988. Trial Court record shows that
the notice was issued to the insurance company on 10.4.89 and
it was served before 29.5.89. No satisfactory explanation has
been furnished by the appellant as to why the original policy and
other records were destroyed within a year of issue of insurance
cover.
20.

I also note that no notice was served by the insurance

company calling upon the owner of the offending bus to produce
the original policy.
21.

The above circumstances compel me to draw an adverse

inference against the insurance company. I am in perfect
agreement with the finding of the learned Tribunal that
appellant insurance company failed to prove that it's liability
under the policy was limited to an extent of Rs.15,000/- only.

22.

In the decision reported as Shyamlal & Ors. V New India

Assurance Co. Ltd., 1979 ACJ 208 (MP), National Insurance Co
Ltd v Narendra Kumar & Ors., 1981 ACJ 93 (All), Oriental Fire
and General Insurance Co. Ltd. v Mrs. Leelavati R. Adyanthaya &
Ors., 1976 DLT 163 it was opined that if the insurance company
fails to prove insurance policy it must be held liable for the full
amount irrespective of the Section 95(2) of the Motor Vehicles
Act, 1939.
23.

In the present case, as the appellant insurance company

has failed to prove the insurance policy, I concur with the
decision of the learned Tribunal and hold that the liability of the
insurance company is unlimited.
24.

I therefore dismiss FAO 138/2000.

25.

Vide FAO No.154/2000 claimants of the deceased seek

enhancement of the compensation.
26.

Deceased was employed as a Surveillance Worker in

Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The last drawn salary of the
deceased was Rs.1752/- per month. Considering that colleagues
of the deceased were getting Rs.3144/- per month in the year
1994, Tribunal has taken monthly income of the deceased as
Rs.3500/- per month.
FAO 138/00

Deducting 1/3rd towards personal
Page No. 8 of 14

expenses of the deceased, loss of dependence worked out to the
family is Rs.2400/- per month.

Multiplier of 17 has been

applied noting that the deceased was 34 years of age at the
time of the accident.

Thus, total loss of dependency to the

family assessed by the Tribunal is Rs.4,89,600/-. (2400 x 12 x
17)
27.

The only ground raised by the counsel for the claimants is

that while determining loss of dependency the Tribunal erred in
ignoring the prospects of future increase in the income of the
deceased.
28.

During the pendency of the claim petition, claimants had

filed letter dated 14.5.1998 issued by Dty. Zonal Health Officer,
Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the employer of the deceased.
The aforenoted letter shows the salary structure of the deceased
and that the salary of the deceased at the time of his retirement
would have been Rs.7013/- per month.
29.

Learned counsel for the claimants contended that ample

evidence was produced before the Tribunal to show the salary
which the deceased would have drawn from time to time but it
was not taken into consideration by the Tribunal while
calculating compensation which is contrary to the judgment of
FAO 138/00

Page No. 9 of 14

the Supreme Court in the decision reported as

AIR 1996 SC

1274 Sarla Dixit & Anr. Vs. Balwant Yadav & Ors.
30.

The general principle for determining the compensation is

that the pecuniary loss to the heirs of the deceased can be
ascertained by balancing on the one hand the loss to the
claimants of the future pecuniary benefit and on the other any
pecuniary advantage which from whatever source comes to
them by reason of the death. In other words, balance of loss
and gain to a dependent by the death must be ascertained.
31.

One of the 2 methods adopted to determine compensation

in fatal accident actions is the multiplier method mentioned in
Davies Vs. Powell Duffregn Associated Colliers Ltd. 1942 AC 601.
32.

If the multiplier adopted by the courts is fair, the

compensation awarded by way of multiplier method takes care
of future prospects.

In the instant case Ex.PW5/1, certificate

issued by the employer of the deceased shows that the income
of the deceased in the month of November,1988 was Rs.1752/-.
As the date of accident is 1.12.1988, I take monthly income of
the deceased as Rs.1752/-. Considering that the family of the
deceased consists of wife, 3 children and parents, I deduct 1/5th
on account of personal expenses of the deceased. Thus, loss of
FAO 138/00

Page No. 10 of 14

dependency is assessed at Rs.1402/- per month. I increase the
same by 10% each year. I note that the deceased was aged 34
years at the time of the accident and had 26 years of service
left.

I take interest on the capital at 12% p.a. from 1988-96,

10% p.a. for the period 1996-03 and thereafter at 8% for the
period 2003-14. Annual interest is shown in column 6. Annual
loss of dependency in column 5 and excess/shortfall of interest
over annual dependency in column 7. The statement comes to

34.

As per claimants, loss of dependency at the end of 26

years comes to Rs.7,013/-.
FAO 138/00

Whereas, loss of dependency
Page No. 12 of 14

assumed by me as per the chart is Rs.15,196/- per month in the
26th year.

The table clearly shows that the compensation

awarded by way of multiplier method has taken into account
future prospects.
35.

Even otherwise, learned counsel for the claimants is wrong

in contending that the Tribunal ignored the prospects of the
future increase in the income of the deceased. The last drawn
salary of the deceased was Rs.1752/- per month. Yet taking into
consideration that colleagues of the deceased were getting
Rs.3144/- in the month of October, 1994 learned Tribunal has
taken income of deceased as Rs.3500/- per month for the
purposes of calculation of loss of dependency.
36.

I find no merit in the contention of the learned counsel for

the claimants that the Tribunal had erred in ignoring the future
prospects.

The table clearly shows that the compensation

awarded by the Tribunal for loss of dependency is just, fair and
reasonable.
37.

FAO No.138/2000 and FAO No.154/2000 are accordingly

dismissed.
