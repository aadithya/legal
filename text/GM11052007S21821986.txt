GITA MITTAL, J
1.

This application has been filed by the defendant no. 2

seeking modification of the order dated 8th September, 1987
passed by this court. 2.

The plaintiff no. 2 is stated to be the

IA No. 10519/03 in CS(OS) No. 2182/1996

page 1 of 9

estranged wife of defendant no. 2 while the plaintiff no. 1 is his
son.
The suit was filed against the defendant no. 1 and defendant
no. 3
who are the parents of defendant no. 2, 4 and 6 on the ground that
they had constituted a Hindu undivided family which owned three
properties namely B-4/52 and B-5/10, Safdarjung Enclave, New
Delhi and property bearing no. 109, Golf Links, New Delhi.
Alongwith the suit the plaintiff had filed an application for interim
injunction being IA No. 5813/1986. On this application, by an
order passed on 23rd October, 1986, an ex-parte injunction
restraining the defendants from disposing of any of the assets of
the HUF which were mentioned in Schedule A to the plaint which
included the three aforenoticed properties was passed.

This

application was disposed of by a judgment passed on 25th
September, 1987 the operative portion where of reads thus :"In suit for partition, it is to be seen that prima
facie, there exist HUF and the properties which are
sought to be partitioned, vest in HUF. If the
properties are not preserved and tomorrow plaintiffs
IA No. 10519/03 in CS(OS) No. 2182/1996

3.

succeed, then, it will be very difficult to partition the
properties. As the defendants have placed the
photostat copy of the Gift Deed with regard to plot
No. 109, Golf Links, New Delhi and also have
produced the photostat copy of the written
instrument of partition dated March 25, 1970, I am
of the view that absolute restraint order may not be
justified with respect to these properties. But
however, some conditions have to be imposed to
safeguard the interest of the parties.
I accordingly, direct that, till the decision of the
suit, if defendant nos. 3, 4 and 6 want to sell, alienate
or otherwise encumber their respective properties,
they will do so with the permission of this court.
Regarding property no. B-4/52, admittedly, this
property stands in the name of defendant nos. 2 and
5. Defendant nos. 2 and 5 are hereby restrained not
to sell, alienate or dispose of or otherwise transfer or
encumber whole or any part of the property bearing
no. B-4/52, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi, till the
disposal of the suit. Defendants shall maintain
regular accounts with regard to the collections of
rents from the tenants in respect of the aforesaid
properties and two copies of statement of accounts
shall be filed every two months in court.
IA 5813/1986 is accordingly disposed of."
It is pointed out that the defendants had assailed the order

dated 25th September, 1987 before the Division Bench by way of
FAO(OS) No. 130/1987 which was disposed of by an order passed
on 20th February , 1989 whereby the Division Bench had vacated
the order of injunction completely so far as the property bearing
IA No. 10519/03 in CS(OS) No. 2182/1996

page 3 of 9

no. B-5/10, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi is concerned.
4.

There is no dispute that the defendant nos. 1 and 3 have

expired during the pendency of the present case. This application
has been filed by the defendant no. 2 submitting that by the order
passed on 25th September, 1987, the court had expressed a view
that so far as the property no. 109, Golf Links, New Delhi is
concerned, Rai Bahadur Chunni Lal who was father of defendant
no. 3 had gifted this property by a registered gift deed dated 8th
March, 1957 to his daughter Smt. Sushila Devi Khanna, defendant
no. 3.

Based on this gift, the Land and Development Office

executed a registered perpetual lease deed dated 15th December,
2002 in favour of Smt. Sushila Devi Khanna. The defendant no. 3
Smt. Sushila Devi Khanna prior to her demise, executed a
registered Will dated 18th May, 1990 whereby she has bequeathed
the property no. 109, Golf Links in different shares upon the
defendant nos. 2, 4 and 6. By virtue of this last Will and testament
of deceased defendant no. 3, the defendant no. 2 is claiming
ownership of the second floor of this property. As per the bequest
IA No. 10519/03 in CS(OS) No. 2182/1996

page 4 of 9

in this Will, the first floor has fallen to the share of Mrs. Rama Nair
(daughter of Smt. Sushila Devi Khanna) and the ground floor to
Mr. P.N. Khanna.
5.

The application has been filed by the defendant no. 2 urging

that he is unemployed and not having any independent regular
and reliable source of income other than some rental being
received from the property bearing no. B-4/52, Safdarjung
Enclave, New Delhi. Inasmuch as the defendant no. 2 is unable to
maintain the property at Golf Links and Safdarjung Enclave and
out of his meagre income, he has also to meet statutory liabilities
including income tax, house tax. Consequently, the applicant has
prayed that he may be permitted to dispose of his share of the
property no. 109, Golf Links, New Delhi.
6.

The defendant no. 2 in this application has submitted that he

has offered his share of the property to his brothers and sister who
have declined to purchase the same and consequently the
defendant no. 2 is left with no option but to sell it to a third party,
if permitted by this court.
IA No. 10519/03 in CS(OS) No. 2182/1996

page 5 of 9

7.

The defendant nos. 4 to 6 do not have any objections to the

grant of the present application and have not opposed the same.
The application has been opposed vehemently by Ms. Malavika
Rajkotia, learned counsel for the plaintiffs who has submitted that
in case the suit is decreed, valuable rights of the plaintiffs would be
impaired if the defendant no. 2 is permitted to sell this property at
this stage.
8.

I find that on 25th September, 1987, this court had passed

an order protecting the rights of the plaintiff to the extent that in
case the defendant nos. 3, 4 and 6 want to sell this property, they
shall do so with the permission of the court.
9.

The suit has been filed on the premise that the three

properties are HUF properties. Even if this contention is upheld,
then the property no. 109, Golf Links would require to be divided
into five shares. This property is stated to be a built up property
constructed on land admeasuring about 360 sq. yards.
10.

As against this, the plaintiffs could then at best seek an

entitlement to a one-third share in the share which falls to the
IA No. 10519/03 in CS(OS) No. 2182/1996

page 6 of 9

share of defendant no. 2.
11.

So far as the other property bearing no. B-4/52, Safdarjung

Enclave is concerned, the same is in the names of defendant nos. 2
and 5 and constructed on a plot of 500 sq. yards. So far as the
defendants are concerned, it is an admitted position that
defendant no. 2 has 50% share in this property.

In case the

contention of the plaintiffs is accepted, then in such eventuality,
again the property would require to be divided amongst the five
members of the HUF and the plaintiffs would be entitled only to
shares under the part of the property which comes to the share of
defendant no. 2.
12.

There is no prayer before this court for sale of the property

bearing no. B-4/52, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi which shall
continue to be held under the names of the defendant nos. 2 and 5
and be bound by the order of injunction passed on 8th of
September, 1987.
13.

By this application, defendant no. 2 has made a prayer only

for sale of the second floor of the property which according to him
IA No. 10519/03 in CS(OS) No. 2182/1996

page 7 of 9

has been bequeathed upon him under the Will dated 18th May,
1990 executed by his mother Smt. Sushila Devi Khanna before this
court. There is no prayer by any of the other defendants for sale of
any other portion and consequently the ground and the first floor
would continue to be bound by the orders dated 25th September,
1987 passed by this court.

Inasmuch as the defendants have

supported the present application, the rights of the plaintiffs, in
my view, would therefore stand adequately protected so far as this
property is concerned even if the prayer made in this application is
granted. The bequests made in the Will dated 18th May, 1990 of
the deceased defendant no. 3 have to abide by final adjudication in
the present suit. In the event of a decree ultimately passed in
favour of the plaintiffs, their rights and entitlement, if any, in 109,
Golf Links, New Delhi can be compensasted out of the other
property.
14.

Mr. Sushil Salwan, learned counsel for the defendnats has

pointed out that the Division Bench vacated the order of injunction
so far as the property no. B-5/10, Safdarjung Enclave is concerned,
IA No. 10519/03 in CS(OS) No. 2182/1996

page 8 of 9

even though the plaintiff had raised pleas which were identical to
the pleas raised by the plaintiffs so far as the property no. 109,
Golf Links is concerned and for this reason as well, the plaintiffs
cannot claim any right, title or interest in the Golf Links property.
Be that as it may, this issue would be appropriately
adjudicated at the time of final hearing in the suit.
For the reasons aforesaid, this application is allowed. The
plaintiff is permitted to dispose of the second floor of the property
bearing no. 109, Golf Links, New Delhi by a transaction of sale or
transfer with proportionate undivided rights in the land on which
it is constructed.
It is made clear that the order dated 25th September, 1987
shall continue to bind the parties so far as the ground floor and
first floor of this property no. 109, Golf Links, New Delhi and the
property no. B-4/52, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi is concerned.
