1.

The respondent Ved Prakash Sangwan was working as

Havaldar in the Indian Army and was dismissed vide order dated
16.5.1994. He was denied pensionary benefits vide order dated
18.10.1996. Aggrieved by this situation he filed writ petition No.
556/1997 before this Court. The learned Single Judge vide order
dated 4.5.2000 allowed the writ and directed the appellants to
grant pensionary benefits to the respondent till 30.6.2000. In this
Letters Patent Appeal (LPA) the appellants have called into
question the order passed by the learned Single Judge.
2.

The facts germane to the present appeal are these. During

leave the respondent had to face a criminal case. The accused
was convicted for offences under Section 302 read with Section
149 of Indian Penal Code. All the accused were convicted and
sentenced to undergo life imprisonment and to pay a fine of
Rs.500/- each under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC. They
were further sentenced to undergo RI(rigorous imprisonment) for
three months under Section 323 read with Section 149 IPC. On
the basis of this conviction the petitioner was dismissed from
service by the competent authority vide order dated 30.7.1991 in
accordance with Rule 17 of Army Rules 1954 read with Section
20(3) of Army Act, 1950. He also received a similar order dated

LPA No.457/2000

Page 2 of 12

18.8.1991. During the appeal, High Court reduced the sentences
of all the accused.

Barring the main accused, the remaining

accused including the respondent were convicted under Section
323 of IPC. The sentence already undergone by the respondent
was considered to be sufficient and he was released on the
sentence already undergone by him. The Apex Court vide order
dated 14.11.1994 gave the benefit of probation to the respondent
under Section 360 Cr.PC but maintained the conviction of the
respondent under Section 323 IPC.

On 16.5.1994 a discharge

certificate was issued by the Record Officer, OIC Records.

On

2.6.1994 the Brigadier Commander informed the father of the
respondent that respondent is not entitled to pension or other
pensionary benefits in view of the circumstances detailed above.
On 7.8.1994 the respondent made a representation to the
Ministry of Defence. On 23.8.1994 the respondent made another
representation to the OIC Records, Raj RIF Records Officer, Delhi
Cantt., requesting that an order of dismissal may kindly be
substituted by an order of discharge and an order of discharge
may be passed so that he may draw pension and other benefits.
His

representation/appeal

was

rejected

on

18.10.1996.

Consequently the respondent filed the writ petition No. 556/1997

LPA No.457/2000

Page 3 of 12

before this court on 8.1.1997 with the prayers that order of his
dismissal dated 16.5.1994 be set aside, respondent be reinstated
into service with all consequential benefits or in the alternative
he should be paid pensionary benefits with interest on arrears of
pension.
3.

We have heard the counsel for the parties.

The learned

counsel for the respondent while defending the judgment of the
Single Judge made few submissions.

The main plank of his

arguments was that the Hon‟ble Supreme Court had given the
benefit of probation in favour of the respondent and as such he is
not to suffer from any disqualification, if any, attaching to a
conviction of an offence under such law by virtue of Section 12 of
Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 and would not affect his service
or pension or his pensionary benefits.

The respondent had a

good record throughout during his service. His father also served
the nation and had a good record. The respondent was convicted
under Section 323 IPC simplicitor.

This is a technical kind of

offence. The respondent at this stage, does not want to rejoin
the service.

His only grievance is that he should be granted

pensionary benefits. He also highlighted the fact that the order
dated 30.7.1991 passed by Brigade Commander 170 Infantry

LPA No.457/2000

Page 4 of 12

Brigade dismissing the respondent with retrospective effect from
16.7.2000, is based on the judgment passed by the Additional
Sessions Judge. The appellants did not try to wait for the decision
to be given by the High Court and the Apex Court. It was alleged
that the above said dismissal order was passed without the
application of mind.

It was, however, explained that order of

dismissal was passed under Section 20(3) of the Army Act but
without serving

the mandatory

notice under Rule 17 on

16.5.1994 as well. In order to embolden his case he has cited
few authorities. In Shankar Dass Vs. Union of India and another,
(1985) 2 SCC 358, it was held :
“The order of dismissal from service consequent upon
a conviction is not a “disqualification” within the
meaning of Section 12. The word „disqualification‟ is
used in Section 12 in the sense in which certain
statutes provide that persons who are convicted for
certain offences shall incur certain disqualifications
(e.g. Chapters III and IV of the Representation of the
People Act, 1951)”
4.

In another case reported in Rajbir Vs. State of Haryana, AIR

1985 SC 1278, it was held :
“4. From the judgment of the High Court it appears
that though the sentence imposed for the offence u/s.
323 of the Code was six months, the appellant and the
co-accused had already suffered over one year‟s
imprisonment. Ordinarily, in a situation as here, there
would be no need to interfere. Learned counsel for
the appellant has, however, pressed the appeal as the

LPA No.457/2000

Page 5 of 12

appellant is in Government service and if the
conviction and sentence are maintained, he would lose
his service. Both the parties to the assault were close
relations.
There is no material on the record to
indicate that the appellant had any previous
conviction. In the absence of such evidence, we treat
the appellant as a first offender. He is entitled to be
admitted to the benefits of probation under Section 3
of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, taking into
consideration the circumstances of the case, the
nature of the offence and the character of the
appellant. While maintaining his conviction we direct
that he shall be released on probation of good conduct
under Section 4 of the Act.
The Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Bhiwani, before whom the appellant is
directed to appear within four weeks from today shall
release him after due admonition. We do not consider
it necessary to direct him to enter into a bond in the
facts of the case.
5.
We are of the view that in the peculiar facts of
the case, the conviction should not affect his
service.”
(Emphasis added)
5.

We are of the considered view that these authorities are not

applicable to the facts of the present case. In Rajbir Vs. State
of Haryana (supra) the Hon‟ble Supreme Court directed that the
conviction of the accused would not affect his service.

These

directions were given under Article 142 of the Constitution of
India. This power vests only with the Hon‟ble Supreme Court. It
must be borne in mind that the above said authority does not lay
down any principle. The above said particular order was passed
due to peculiar facts of that case. Consequently, each case has

LPA No.457/2000

to be decided on its own facts and merits. The authorities to be
cited below make it crystal clear that benefit of probation merely
protects

6.

In Union of India and others Vs. Bakshi Ram, (1990) 2

SCC 426 was pleased to hold :
“11. Section 12 of the Act does not preclude the
department from taking action for misconduct leading
to the offence or to his conviction thereon as per law.
The section was not intended to exonerate the person
from departmental punishment.
The question of
reinstatement into service from which he was
removed in view of his conviction does not therefore,
arise. That seems obvious from the terminology of
Section 12. On this aspect, the High Courts speaks
with one voice.
The Madras High Court in R.
Kumaraswami Aiyar v. Commissioner, Municipal
Council, Tiruvannamalai, (1957) 58 Cri LJ 255 and
Embaru, P. v. Chairman, Madras Port Trust, (1963) 1
LLJ 49 (Mad) the Andhra Pradesh High Court in A.
Satyanarayana Murthy v. Zonal Manager, LIC, AIR
1959 AP 371, the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Prem
Kumar v. Union of India, (1971) 2 LLJ 346, the Punjab
and Haryana High Court in Om Parkash v. Director
Postal Services (Posts and Telegraphs Deptt.) Punjab
Circle, Ambala, (1971) 1 SLR 648 (P&H), the Delhi High
Court in Director of Postal Services v. Daya Nand,
1972 SLR 325 have expressed the same view. This
view of the High Courts in the aforesaid cases
has been approved by this Court in Divisional
Personnel Officer, Southern Railway Vs. T.R.
Challappan case, (1976) 3 SCC 190.
12.

13. Section 12 is thus clear and it only directs that
the offender “shall not suffer disqualification, if any,
attaching to a conviction of an offence under such
law”. Such law in the context is other law providing
for disqualification on account of conviction.
For
instance, if a law provides for disqualification of a
person for being appointed in any office or for seeking
election to any authority or body in view of his
conviction, that disqualification by virtue of Section 12
stands removed. That in effect is the scope and effect
of Section 12 of the Act. But that is not the same
thing to state that the person who has been dismissed
from service in view of his conviction is entitled to
reinstatement upon getting the benefit of probation of
good conduct. Apparently, such a view has no support
by the terms of Section 12 and the order of the High
Court cannot, therefore, be sustained.”
8.

In another authority reported in Additional D.I.G. of

Police, Hyderabad Vs. P.R.K. Mohan, (1997) 11 SCC 571, it
was held :
“4. It is settled law that Section 12 of the Probation
of Offenders Act, 1958 does not preclude the
department from taking action for misconduct leading
to the offence or to his conviction thereon as per law.
The section was not intended to exonerate the person
from departmental punishment. It was clarified; the
section only directed that the offender shall not suffer
disqualification, if any, attaching to a conviction of an
offence under such law. Such law in the context is
other law providing for disqualification on account of
conviction. This Court, therefore, held that merely
because a sentence of imprisonment has been
substituted by an order passed under Section 12 of
the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, the effect of the
conviction is not obliterated altogether and it would be
open to the authorities to take departmental
proceedings on the basis thereof [see Union of India v.

LPA No.457/2000

Page 8 of 12

Bakshi Ram(supra)]. Therefore, the observation of the
appellate court on the interpretation of Section 12 is
not correct.”

Man

Our own High Court in case reference Ex Sub-Inspector,
Singh

Vs.

Union

of

India

and

another,

WP(C)No.377/1993 decided on 19.10.2006 while relying upon the
observations made by the Apex Court was pleased to hold :
“Under the Army Rule 16(1) (a) r/w Army Act Section
71(r) which is para materia to Section 48(g) of the
present Act, the Supreme Court rejected such a
contention in the case of Union of India and Ors. vs
Subedar Ram Narain being Civil Appeal No. 3609/96
decided on 15.9.98 where the Court held as
under:“For a person to be eligible to the grant of
pension or gratuity it is imperative that he should not
have been dismissed from service. The dismissal
under the provisions of the Army Act is, therefore, a
disqualification for getting pension or gratuity.
It was also submitted by Sh. Malhotra that
Regulation 113(a) was discriminatory and, further,
pension which is earned becomes the property of the
person concerned and the same cannot be taken
away. But no such contention was
raised before the High Court. In any case we see no
merit in the said contention. Firstly junior
commissioned officers and commissioned officers
belong to different classes. They are not similarly
situated. Moreover pension is granted by the rules and
regulations which can and do provide for the
circumstances which would make a person ineligible
to receive the same.
Dismissal makes a junior
commissioned officer dis-entitled to receive pension or
gratuity. Regulation 113(a) is not in any way invalid.

LPA No.457/2000

Page 9 of 12

For the aforesaid reasons we come to the
conclusion that unlike Regulation 16(a) which applies
to the commissioned officers, in the case of noncommissioned officers other ranks and noncombatants(enrolled) the dismissal of such a person
under the Army Act would ipso facto render him
ineligible for pension or gratuity. The President,
however, has a right in the case of a person
dismissed under the provisions of the Army Act but in
exceptional circumstances and at his discretion to
grant service pension at a rate not exceeding that for
which the individual concerned would have otherwise
qualified had he been discharged on the same day.”
10.

There can be no conflictions on the point that the Apex

Court in its order dated 11.4.1994 maintained the sentence of the
accused / respondent. The conviction of the accused stands. For
our benefit the above said order is reproduced as follows :
“The appellant has been convicted for the
offence under Section 323 IPC and has been
sentenced for the period of imprisonment already
undergone. The learned counsel for the appellant has
pointed out that the appellant was employed as
Havaldar in the Army and had served in the Army for
more than 15 years and as a result of the sentence of
imprisonment which has been imposed on his he has
lost his job. The learned counsel submits that if
instead of being sentenced to imprisonment the
benefit of the provisions of Section 360 Cr.PC is
granted to the Appellant he would be able to
approach the authorities for consideration of his
case.
We have considered the facts and circumstances
of the case and having regard to the nature of the
offence for which the appellant has been convicted we
consider it a fit case in which the benefit of Section
360 Cr.PC should have been given to the appellant.

LPA No.457/2000

Page 10 of 12

The appeal is, therefore, allowed. The conviction of
the appellant under Section 323 IPC is
maintained but the sentence of imprisonment
will stand substituted by an order for release on
probation under Section 360 Cr.PC on his furnishing a
personal bond with one surety to the satisfaction of
the Additional Sessions Judge, Bhiwani to keep the
peace and be of good behavior for a period of one
year.”
11.

This must be borne in mind that the Hon‟ble Supreme Court

did not itself make any comments “for the consideration of his
case” and left it open for the department to decide his
departmental case. It appears that the Hon‟ble Supreme Court
did not think it proper to utilize its power under Article 142 of
Constitution of India in favour of the respondent.
12.

The learned Single Judge vide its order dated 4.5.2000 had

set aside the order dated 18.10.1996 denying the pensionary
benefits to the respondent. The learned Single Judge had further
directed that the appellants would grant pensionary benefits to
the respondent in view of his past service and orders to that
effect would be issued by the appellants on or before the
30.6.2000.

The above said discussion takes the edge off the

criticism of appellants‟ impugned order. The judgment given by
the learned Single Judge is not legally sustainable. We accept the
appeal herein and reverse the order passed by the learned Single

LPA No.457/2000

Page 11 of 12

Judge.

The respondent has received pension by virtue of the

order passed by the learned Single Judge. Whatever the money
the respondent has received till now shall not be recovered.
However, from now onwards no pension or other pensionary
benefits be paid to the respondent. There shall no orders as to
costs.
