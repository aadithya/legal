ANIL KUMAR, J.(Oral)

1.

This is a petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and

Conciliation Act, 1996 for appointment of a sole arbitrator in terms of
arbitration agreement between the parties as the disputes have arisen
between the parties.

2.

The petitioner is a company incorporated under the provisions

of the Companies Act, 1956 and is engaged in the business of
imparting computer education, maintenance and supply of computer
hardware, development of computer software etc. The petition has

been filed by

Mr.Chandrababu, General Manager of the petitioner

company, who has been authorized by a resolution dated 24th July,
2007 passed by the Board of Directors, to institute this petition.

3.
(NIT)

The contention of the petitioner is that a Notice Inviting Tender
bearing

respondent

No.F.DE-45/21/CEP-V/2004

for

computer

education

was

project,

issued

“CEP-V”,

by

the

in

267

Government/ Government aided schools in the NCT of Delhi and the
petitioner was selected as a successful bidder and a letter of
acceptance dated 30th January, 2006 was issued to the petitioner
along with a draft agreement for execution. However, as the draft
agreement was at variance with the terms and conditions of the NIT
therefore, a clarification was sought by the petitioner by its letter
dated 31st January, 2006. Thereafter an agreement dated 20th
February,

2006

was

entered

between

the

parties

formally

incorporating the scope of project and the various terms and
conditions governing the parties. The agreement was valid till 27th
March, 2010 and that the project implementation was to be completed
within 30 days from the date of the signing of the agreement.
According to the petitioner there was a delay in the implementation of
the project on account of inactions attributable to the respondents.
The petitioner has detailed the reasons for non-implementation of the
project in para 13 of the petition.

Despite

hindrances

the

petitioner

went

ahead

with

the

implementation of the project and in a meeting held on 14th
September, 2006 the petitioner representing the problems faced in
implementing the project sought for release of 15% of the initial
payments in terms of the contract between the parties, however, the
same was not released by the respondents. Thereafter several
correspondences were sent by the petitioner to the respondent
highlighting the issues relating to the project however the same have
remained unresolved and unaddressed.

5.

Thereafter a total bill of Rs 10.05 crores was raised by the

petitioner uptill March 2007, against which an amount of Rs 3.5
crores was only been received between 27th October, 2006 to 18th May,
2007. The petitioner stated that the respondents are contemplating to
levy penalty on delay in the implementation of the project for which
the respondent is solely responsible. The petitioner pleaded that they
were always willing, ready and prepared to act, in furtherance of the
agreement and had also taken irretrievable steps by mobilizing
resources to complete the project and that the respondents are in
breach of their obligation under the agreement. According to the
petitioner it has pecuniary claim inter-alia for outstanding payments,
unwarranted penalties and damages. Consequently disputes have

AA No.418/2007

Page 3 of 9

arisen between the parties. According to the petitioner clause 16 of
the agreement dated 20th February 2006 entered into between the
petitioner and the respondents contained the Arbitration agreement.
Clause 16 of the agreement containing the arbitration agreement is as
under:“16: Any dispute/difference arising out of or relating to
this agreement including the interpretations of the terms
and conditions will be resolved through joint discussion.
However, if the dispute is not resolved through joint
discussion then the matter will be referred to the
arbitrator appointed by the Lieutenant Governor Delhi.
Further, competent court of Delhi alone shall have
jurisdiction over the same.”

6.

Thereafter, the petitioner sought amicable resolution of the

dispute through joint discussion which were held on 21 st December,
2006 and 17th July, 2007 but to no avail. In the facts and
circumstances,

the

petitioner

was

constrained

to

invoke

the

arbitration clause and issued simultaneously a letter and notice dated
8th August 2007 and 13th August 2007 respectively and demanded
appointment of an arbitrator in terms of arbitration agreement to
adjudicate the disputes between the parties. The petitioner in notice
dated 13th August, 2007 had also suggested names of the proposed
arbitrator(s). No reply to the notice was given by the respondents nor
was any arbitrator appointed despite service of notice on 14th August
2007 and also the suggestions given by the petitioner were not acted

AA No.418/2007

Page 4 of 9

upon by the respondents.

7.

Consequently, the petitioner has filed the present petition. The

learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on 131(2006) Delhi Law
Times 575, Bharat Battery Manufacturing Company Pvt Ltd Vs. Union
of India to contend that since the notice invoking the arbitration
agreement between the parties was duly served on the respondents on
14th August, 2007 and as no arbitrator has been appointed by the
respondents within 30 days of the receipt of notice and even till the
filing of the present petition, the right of the respondent to appoint an
arbitrator stands forfeited and therefore an arbitrator be appointed by
this Court.

8.
Ms.

The petition is contested by the respondent and an affidavit of
Ankita

Mishra,

Additional

Director

of

Education(Admn),

Directorate of the Education, Government of NCT of Delhi, computer
education project cell, has been filed. The respondent has objected to
the appointment of the arbitrator by this Court on the ground that
pursuant to the receipt of notice dated 13th August 2007 Ms.Janak
Juneja (retd.), IAS officer, has already been appointed as an arbitrator
on 5th October 2007 by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi.

9.

The existence of arbitration agreement has not been disputed by

AA No.418/2007

Page 5 of 9

the parties. The notice invoking the arbitration agreement was issued
on 13th August 2007. The respondents were required to appoint an
arbitrator within 30 days of the receipt of notice or till the filing of the
petition. The respondent ought to have appointed an arbitrator within
thirty days of notice seeking appointment of arbitrator or before filing
of the present petition and since the arbitrator was not appointed
before filing of the present petition, the right of the respondent stood
forfeited and therefore, after filing of the petition the respondent could
not appoint an arbitrator.

10.

The present petition under section 11 of the Arbitration and

Conciliation Act was filed by the petitioner on 17th September 2007
whereas the arbitrator has been appointed by the respondent only on
5th October, 2007 which in the facts and circumstances of the case
cannot be said to be a validly appointed arbitrator as the respondent
had already forfeited his right.

11.

The Apex Court in Datar Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance Ltd.

& Anr., IV (2000) CLT 191 (SC)=VII (2000) SLT 543=JT 2000 (Suppl.
2) SC 226 had held that if the vacancy of an arbitrator is not filled till
a party approaches the Court and files a petition for appointment by
the designated authority of the Chief Justice of that Court under
Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the right to

AA No.418/2007

Page 6 of 9

supply vacancy by the opposite party is extinguished. This ratio of
Datar Switchgear Ltd.(supra) was approved by the Supreme Court in
Punj Lloyed Ltd. Vs Petronet MHB Ltd., (2006) 2 SCC 628 and it was
reiterated that once period of notice had lapsed and the petitioner had
moved under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996, the party having right to appoint arbitrator under arbitral
agreement loses the right to do so.

12.

A learned Single Judge in Haryana Telecom Ltd. v. Union of

India & Anr., 112 (2004) DLT 339=2004 (3) RAJ 147, had held that if
the respondent fails to appoint an Arbitrator within the stipulated
time of 30 days of the notice, and even after filing of the petition
under Section 11 of the Act, it is for the Court to appoint an
Arbitrator. A Division Bench of this Court in Delkon (India) Pvt. Ltd.
v. G.M., Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., 120 (2005) DLT 542 (DB),
relying on Datar Switchgears Ltd Vs Tata Finance Ltd has held in
para 4 as under:
“4. We have given our careful consideration to the
arguments advanced by learned Counsel for both the
parties. In view of the law laid down in the case of Datar
Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance Ltd. & Anr., IV (2000)
CLT 191 (SC)=VII (2000) SLT 543=JT 2000 (Suppl. 2) SC
226 it is no more res integra that the vacancy can be
supplied by a party pursuant to the arbitration agreement
even after thirty days of the receipt of the notice. However,
once a party approaches the Court and files a petition for
appointment by the designated authority of the Chief
Justice of that Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, the right to supply vacancy by the
AA No.418/2007

Page 7 of 9

opposite party is extinguished. If that right stood
extinguished on filing of the petition under Section 11(6)
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, in September
1998 the appointment of an Arbitrator on 3rd May, 1999
could not be made, therefore in our view, the order
passed by the learned Single Judge on 7th May, 1999
suffers from patent illegality. Therefore, the submission of
the respondent that the petitioner had appeared before
the Arbitrator and the application of the petitioner raising
preliminary objections is pending adjudication which
inter alia challenges the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to
decide the dispute is of no consequence as from the order
reproduced above it was pursuant to the directions
passed by the learned Single Judge that the parties were
directed to appear before the Arbitrator. The petitioner
had no other option but to appear before the Arbitrator
and after appearing before the Arbitrator the petitioner
has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator,
rather has at first opportunity taken the objection that
the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to proceed with the
matter.
13.

In Union of India v. M/s. R.R. Industries, 120 (2005) DLT 572

(DB) also it was held that once a party does not supply the vacancy or
fails to supply the vacancy before filing of a petition under Section
11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, such a party forfeits the
right to supply the vacancy in terms of the arbitration clause and
what remains is only the arbitration clause, i.e. the dispute has to be
resolved under the mechanism of alternative dispute redressal
scheme but no right survives to the respondent to supply the named
Arbitrator in the arbitration clause. Thus the arbitrator was to be and
could be appointed by the respondent before filing of the petition and
not after the filing of the petition.

AA No.418/2007

14.

In totality of facts and circumstances, it is inevitable to infer

that there is arbitration agreement between the parties which is
reproduced hereinabove. The respondent failed to appoint an
arbitrator within four weeks of notice given by the petitioner for
appointment of an arbitrator. Even before filing of the petition the
arbitrator had not been appointed. Thus the right of the respondents
to appoint the arbitrator stood forfeited and the respondent could not
appoint

an

arbitrator

thereafter.

Consequently

the

arbitrator

appointed by the respondent cannot act as an arbitrator as he could
not be appointed as an arbitrator by the respondent and it is for this
Court to appoint an arbitrator.

15.

Considering the facts and circumstances, I appoint Mr. Justice

Jaspal Singh (Retd.) 59, Hemkunt Colony, Near Nehru Place, Delhi
(Mob:9811070188, Res.: 26418081) as an Arbitrator to adjudicate all
the disputes between the parties. The learned Arbitrator shall decide
his fees and the procedure for adjudication of disputes between the
parties. The parties shall appear before the Learned arbitrator on 14th
January, 2008 at 4.30 PM. A copy of this order be sent to the learned
arbitrator forthwith. The parties are also directed to give a copy of this
order to the arbitrator. Copy of this order be given dasti to the parties.
