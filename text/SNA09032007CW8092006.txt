As per respondents, the petitioner was awarded penalty of

In substance, the

contention of the respondents is that as the termination
order

was

passed

against

the

petitioner

by

the

Disciplinary Authority at Assam and the Appellate Order
was

passed

by

the

Appellate

Authority

at

Jammu,

therefore, this court has no jurisdiction to entertain
the

present

petition.

The

respondents

have

further

raised a preliminary objection on the maintainability of
the present petition on the ground that the petitioner
has rushed to this court without exhausting the statutory
remedy of revision provided in Rule 29 of the CRPF Rules,
1955.

On merits, the stand of the respondents is that

the petitioner had deserted the Camp where he was posted
w.e.f. 23.8.2004 thrice and three warrants of arrest were
issued against him.

It is stated that

this

kind

of

behaviour/attitude from the members of the Force is not
desired and tolerated in the disciplined Force.
6.

We have gone through the impugned order dated

12.11.2005 passed by the Appellate Authority at Jammu and
we find that the Appellate Authority has given cogent
writ petition(C) no.809/06

Page 7 of 10

reasons in its order for confirming the punishment of
'Removal from Service' awarded to the petitioner by the
Disciplinary Authority.

It is borne out from the record

that the petitioner had deserted the Camp where he was
posted on three occasions and for that reason warrants of
arrest

had

to

be

issued

for

apprehending

him.

The

contention of the petitioner is that on all the three
occasions he deserted the Camp, it was on account of his
illness.

The petitioner has not placed any material on

that

he

had

informed

the

concerned

Authorities about his intention to leave the Camp for the
purpose of his treatment on any of the three occasions he
deserted the Camp as mentioned in the impugned order of
the Appellate Authority.

We further do not find any

infirmity in the procedure adopted by the Enquiry Officer
for holding an enquiry against the petitioner for his
unauthorised absence.

He was given adequate opportunity

to put up his defence before the Enquiry Officer but
despite that he opted to remain absent from the enquiry

contention

of

the

petitioner

is

that

the

respondents

should have sent the communication regarding the enquiry
at his Delhi address instead of sending the same to his
home town because the petitioner at the relevant time was
residing with his relative at Delhi.

The petitioner has

not shown that the respondents were aware about the Delhi
address of the petitioner and, therefore, the respondents
were justified in sending the communication pertaining to
the petitioner regarding his unauthorised absence at the
address
