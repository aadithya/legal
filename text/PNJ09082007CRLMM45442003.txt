PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
Petitioner has been arrayed as an accused in a

complaint lodged under Section 18(a)(i) and Section 18(c) read
with Sections 27(c)(d)(e)(ii) of the Drugs and Cosmetics 1940.
Pertaining to the petitioner who has been arrayed as accused
No.2, necessary allegations in the complaint are to be found in
para 4 of the complaint which reads as under:“4.
That Kesho Ram Gupta (Accused
No.2) and G.C.Sharma (Accused No.3) were the
Managing
Director
and
Executive
Director
respectively of accused No.1 on or before March 96

2.

and were responsible to the company for the
Page 1 of 3
conduct of its day to day business at the time of
manufacturing of the drug in question during
March 96.”
Needless to state other averments relate to the merits

of the controversy viz the allegation that certain drugs which were
seized, on testing, failed to qualify as per standards of quality
prescribed under the Act.
3.

Learned

Magistrate

petitioner on 11.11.2002.

framed

charges

against

the

Petitioner challenges the charge

framed by way of a revision petition alleging that he was not incharge of or in control of the affairs of the company.
4.

The criminal revision petition No.310/2003 came to be

dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge vide order
dated 12.9.2003.
5.

Learned Trial Judge and learned ASJ have noted various

authorities relating to liability of managing director and what
should be the necessary averments in respect of an accused
person who is arrayed as an accused being a director or a
managing director of a company.
6.

Suffice would it be to note that in the decision reported

as 2005 (8) SCC 89 SMS Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. Neeta Bhalla &
Anr. as followed and explained in a subsequent decision reported

as N.Rangachari vs. BSNL AIR 2007 SC 1682 it was held that it
would be a sufficient averment in the complaint, to make
Page 2 of 3
it actionable, that a particular accused was a managing director of
a company and was responsible for the conduct of its day-to-day
business and affairs.
7.

It may be noted that in SMS Pharmaceutical's case

(supra), the Supreme Court pithly drew a distinction between a
person who was a director and a person who was a managing
director. In para 9 it was observed that managing directors, as
the designation of their office suggests, are in-charge of a
company and are responsible for the conduct of the business of
the company.

It was observed that such persons have to

establish their defence at the trial i.e. that the offence was
committed without their knowledge or that they exercised all due
diligence to prevent the commission of the offence.
8.

No case is made out to interfere with the order framing

the charge or the order dismissing the criminal revision petition.
9.

I may clarify that I have not dealt with the issue of

maintainability of the instant petition which invokes Section 482
of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the reasons the facts are
writ large as regards the merits of the controversy.

10.

Dismissed.
