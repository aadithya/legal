CORAM :*THE HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE A.K.SIKRI
THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIPIN SANGHI
1.Whether Reporters of Local papers may be allowed to see
the Judgment?
2.To be referred to the Reporter or not?
3.Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?

A.K. SIKRI, J.
:
1. Not only the question of law, which arises for determination
in these cases, is common, the said question arises out of
same set of facts in each case.

That was precisely the

reason for hearing these petitions together which we
propose to dispose of by this common judgment. For the
sake of convenience, facts in WP(C) No.283-86/2005 are
taken note of, which was otherwise also treated as the lead
case.
2. Before proceeding to mention the facts in the said writ
petition, we may point out that all these cases relate to the
teachers, who are working in different schools managed
and run by the Govt. of NCT of Delhi. These teachers were
given the initial appointment as Trained Graduate Teachers
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 3 of 19

(TGTs) and were promoted as Post Graduate Teachers
(PGTs) on officiating basis in early 1980s and in any case,
before 1.1.1986.

They continued to work as PGTs on

officiating basis till their retirement, which occurred much
after 1.1.1986.
with

effect

Pay scales of the teachers were revised
from

1.1.1986

after

accepting

recommendations of 4th Central Pay Commission.

the
Three

scales were introduced for TGTs, namely, Entry Scale,
Senior Scale and Selection Scale. Senior Scale was to be
given after completion of 12 years of service as TGT and
selection grade after 24 years of service as TGT.

As on

1.1.1986, since these teachers were working as PGTs only
on officiating basis holding lien over the substantive post of
TGT, they were given the Senior Scale and/or Selection
Scale in the post of TGT on completion of 12 years/24 years
of service.

Much after their retirement, orders dated

17.11.1986 were passed regularising their services as PGT,
though retrospectively with effect from a date anterior to
1.1.1986. This gave rise to a dispute regarding entitlement
of selection grade of these teachers as TGTs. According to
the Government, since such teachers, who were given ad
hoc promotion as PGTs, were regularised as PGT before
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 4 of 19

1.1.1986, they ceased to hold the post of TGT and,
therefore, were not entitled to the benefit of Selection
Scale as on 1.1.1986 as TGT, which post they were not
holding as on that date.

These teachers, on the other

hand, contended that such a regularisation took place
much after their retirement in the year 1986 and otherwise
as on 1.1.1986, they were working on officiating basis as
PGT with lien over the post of TGT, they were entitled to
the selection grade scale as TGT with the acceptance of
the

recommendation

of

the

4th

Pay

Commission.

Contention of these teachers has found favour with the
Tribunal in all cases, except in three cases and the
Tribunal, allowing those OAs, has directed the Government
to fix the pay accordingly.

In three cases, however,

different view is taken and the OAs are dismissed. In those
three cases petitioners are the said teachers and in other
cases, Government has filed the writ petitions. In fact, the
two cases, which were decided earlier, were Sukh Darshan
Lal Vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi and Ors. wherein the OA was
dismissed and Inderjeet Singh and Ors. Vs. Govt. of NCT of
Delhi and Ors., wherein the OA was allowed. When the OA
filed by Sh.Ram Sevak Pal and other connected OAs came
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 5 of 19

up for hearing before the Division Bench, it observed a
dissonance between the two orders passed in the aforesaid
two cases and referred the related issue to the Full Bench.
The Full Bench answered the said reference vide its
judgment dated 13.7.2004 holding that a teacher, who had
not been confirmed in the promoted post of PGT/VicePrincipal, was entitled to selection grade of lower post.
These OAs and other OAs were thereafter allowed by the
Division Benches of the Tribunal on the basis of opinion
expressed by the Full Bench.
3. Since we have enumerated above the exact nature of
dispute, which is the subject-matter of these petitions, we
now

take

note

of

the

relevant

facts.

For

better

understanding of the dispute, we take up the relevant
dates of appointment and promotion etc. of Sh.Ram Sevak
Pal, who is the respondent in WP(C) No.19795-97/2004.
10.3.1960 -

Date of appointment as TGT

1.3.1966

-

Date of promotion as TGT

5.9.1971

-

Given selection grade as TGT

13.9.1983 -

Promoted as PTG on officiating basis

30.11.1991 -

Retired while working as PGT on officiating
basis

17.6.1996 -

orders of regularisation of Sh.Ram Sevak Pal
as PGT issued giving regularisation with effect

WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 6 of 19

from 16.1.1984.
12.8.1987 -

Govt. of India issued instructions regarding
grant of three pay scales for teachers of all
categories, viz., Entry Scale, Senior Scale and
Selection Scale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Category of School Teachers
Revised Pay Scales
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------a) Primary School Teachers
Rs.1200-2040
Senior Scale (After 12 Years)

Rs.1400-2600

Selection Scale (After 12 years in
Senior Scale and attainment of qualifications
laid down for TGTs)

Rs.1640-2900

b) Trained Graduate Teachers/Headmasters
Rs.1400-2600
of Primary School.
Senior Scale (After 12 years)
Rs.1640-2900
Selection Scale (After 12 Years in Senior
Scale and attainment of qualifications
laid down for PGTs)
c) Post Graduate Teachers/Headmasters
of Middle School.
Senior Scale (After 12 years)

Rs.2000-3500

Rs.1640-2900
Rs.2000-3500

Selection Scale
(After 12 years in senior scale)

Rs.2200-4000

d) Vice-Principal/Headmasters of
Secondary School

Rs.2000-3500

Senior Scale (After 12 years)

Rs.2200-4000

4. As by the time the aforesaid notification regarding revision
of pay scales of school teachers with effect from 1.1.1986
was issued, Sh. Ram Sevak Pal was holding the post of PGT
only on officiating basis and that of TGT on substantive
basis, the promotion to the post of PGT on officiating basis
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 7 of 19

was not to be considered while applying the revision in the
pay scales. In so far as TGT is concerned, he was given the
selection grade on 5.9.1971.

Therefore, corresponding

selection grade of Rs.2,000-3,500/- on revision was to be
given to him. This was denied vide impugned order dated
9.7.2002 on the ground that vide orders dated 17.6.1996
he had been promoted to the post of PGT with effect from
16.1.1984 on regular basis and, therefore, as on 1.1.1986
he was not working as TGT but stood promoted as PGT,
though this event took place much after his retirement. It
will also be necessary to take note of the facts of the case
of Sh. Jodha Ram, another applicant who had filed the OA
which matter was referred to the Full Bench of the Tribunal
along with the case of Sh. Ram Sevak Pal.

This would

enable us to understand the judgment of the Full Bench
better.

The dates of appointment and promotions in

respect Sh.Jodha Ram are as follows:8.9.1955

-

Date of appointment as TGT

18.7.1962 -

Date of promotion as PGT

1.3.1975

-

Granted selection grade of PGT

9.1.1986

-

Promoted as Vice-Principal on ad hoc basis.

31.12.1990 -

Retired while working as ad hoc Principal.

5. Since as on 1.1.1986 he was holding the substantive post

WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 8 of 19

of PGT, he demanded the selection scale of Rs.2,000-4,000
on completion of 12 years of service from 1.3.1975, i.e.
1.3.1987.

He had earlier filed OA in which direction was

given to consider his claim and pass speaking order.
However, the petitioner refused to grant him the said scale
vide orders dated 10.8.2001, 5.6.2000 and 14.1.2002.
6. The Full Bench, to which the matter was referred, in its
detailed judgment dated 13.7.2004 considered the impact
of giving regular promotion from back date, albeit after the
retirement of these persons. It noted that this was done as
a consequence of the judgment of the Supreme Court in
the case of K.C. Lakhanpal & Ors. Vs. Delhi Administration
& Ors., (1994) Supp. 2 SCR 637 keeping in view the
following directions passed in the said judgment on
16.8.1994 by the Supreme Court:“(4) Those incumbents who have since
retired or have died after retirement are
found entitled to any benefit by our decision
the same shall be considered by the
respondent Nos.1 to 4 and the benefits, if
any, be worked out and paid to their
nominees or legal representatives as the
case may be.”
7. The Full Bench noted the aforesaid directions were given
with a view to extend benefit to the retired employees by
passing the order of regular promotion in the case of
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 9 of 19

respondents

herein

from

retrospective

date.

The

petitioners herein were taking away the said benefit which
could not be the intention behind the orders of the
Supreme Court. The Full Bench examined the orders giving
them regular promotion.

It opined that the regular

promotion does not mean that they were confirmed in the
post of PGT/Vice- Principal, inasmuch as, the words
“regular” or “regularisation” do not connote permanence
and cannot be construed so as to convey the idea of the
nature of tenure of appointments as held by the Supreme
Court in the case of B.N. Nagarajan and Ors. Vs. State of
Karnataka and Ors., (1979) 4 SCC 507. On that basis, the
Full Bench of the Tribunal observed as under:“15. If a person is promoted on ad hoc
basis as PGT or Vice Principal, it does not
automatically mean that he has been
confirmed or holds a lien on that post.
Before issue of DOPT O.M. dated 28.3.1988
relating
to
simplified
confirmation
procedure effective from 1.4.1988, the
confirmation was linked with availability of
permanent posts. The factual position is
that the applicants have not been confirmed
as PGTs or Vice Principals as the case may
be. The claim of selection grade in the
cadre of TGT/PGT arises much before the
issue of simplified procedure of DOP&T O.M.
dated 28.3.1988 is only prospective in
nature.
It cannot be applied to deny
benefits which were available to the
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 10 of 19

applicants prior to issue of this O.M.
Therefore, the decision of the committee as
per minutes dated 6.6.1997 was in order.
16. In the case of Triveni Shankar Saxena
Vs. State of UP & Ors. (1992 SC (l&s) 440),
the question for consideration was whether
termination of the applicant from the post
of Consolidator was justified or not. It was
also for consideration whether he should
have been repatriated to the post of
Lekhpal from where he was selected as
Consolidator. It was held that the appellant
in that case could not be repatriated to the
post of Lekhpal as he did not hold the post
in substantive capacity on permanent basis.
He held the post of Lekhpal on temporary
basis
as
was
apparent
from
the
appointment letter.
17. In the case of Nirmal Chandra
Bhattacharjee and Ors. Vs. Union of India
and Ors. (1992 SCC (L&S) 236), it has been
held an employee cannot be made to suffer
on account of intervening events.
18. In the case of Pritam Singh Vs. Union
of India & Ors. (Chandigarh Bench of this
Tribunal) in O.A. No.369 CH of 1987 dated
20.3.1989 it is held that the applicant
holding lien in PCS promoted to IAS on
probation could not be deprived of the
benefits of PCS benefits by retrospective
confirmation order. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Ali M.K. & Ors. Vs. State
of Kerala and Ors. (SLJ 2003(2) 44) have
observed that unless the person concerned
is confirmed in new service, he has a lien in
former service.
The Hon'ble Delhi High
Court as per their decision dated 20.9.1973
in the case of Nand Kishore Vs. Lt. Governor
of Delhi and Ors. (CMP No. 994 of 1972),
while deciding similar matters of teachers
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 11 of 19

held that order of confirmation issued
despite protest of the petitioners even
before issuance of the said order smack of
legal malafide. It has also been observed
that confirmation can be made with
retrospective effect as such order of
confirmation is normally for the benefit of
the official concerned.”
8. Thus, the Tribunal answered the reference by concluding
that a teacher, who had not been confirmed in the
promoted post of Principal/Vice-Principal was entitled to
selection grade of lower post and mere regular promotion
with retrospective date would not dis-entitle such persons
from benefits of substantive post of Teacher/Principal/VicePrincipal held by them. Based on the said answer to the
reference, the Division Benches of the Tribunal have
passed separate orders in all these cases granting the
respondents/teachers the benefit of selection grade etc.
9. Ms. Avinsh Ahlawat, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners, submitted that clarification was given by the
Government vide O.M. dated 5.5.2000 to the effect that as
per the instructions dated 12.8.1987, senior scale was to
be granted after 12 years of service and period of 12 years
was

necessary

consideration

for

being

eligible

for

consideration for grant of the said scale and these
respondents had not completed 12 years of service as
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 12 of 19

TGT/PGT etc. as the case may be, and they stood promoted
to the next higher post, may be on ad hoc basis and,
therefore, were not eligible for grant of selection scale. She
also submitted that orders dated 10.8.2001 were passed to
the same effect when the matter of Sh. Jodha Ram was
considered after the directions dated 25.5.2001 of the
Tribunal in the first OA filed by him. She also relied upon
another judgment of the Division Bench of the Tribunal
dated

18.5.2002

passed

in

CP

No.221/2000

in

OA

No.2386/1999 entitled Gajraj Singh and Others Vs. Govt. of
NCT of Delhi whereby the contempt proceedings were
dropped.

She reiterated that since these persons had

already been promoted to the higher scale retrospectively
before they could complete 12 years of service, they were
not entitled to the selection grade as per orders dated
12.8.1987.
10.Learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand,
submitted that the Full Bench of the Tribunal had
considered the matter in right perspective which needed no
interference. They also referred to O.M. dated 28.3.1988,
which was taken note of by the Full Bench as well wherein
it was decided that all those persons, who were promoted
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 13 of 19

on a higher post before completing 12 years of service but
not confirmed, were entitled to selection scale in the lower
post which they were still holding on substantive basis.
Therefore, submission was that it was because of the
reason that even when there was promotion on regular
basis of a particular person, he would continue to hold lien
on the lower post till he is confirmed on the higher post and
in support he referred to the following judgments:a)B.N. Nagarajan & Ors. Vs. State of Karnataka & Ors.
(1979( 4 SCC 507.
b)Triveni Shankar Saxena Vs. State of U.P. & Ors.
1992 Suppl. (1) SCC 524.
c) Pritam Singh, IAS Vs. Union of India & Ors. 1990 (2)
SLJ 58 (CAT, Chandigarh).
d)Lt. Governor of Delhi & Ors. Vs. Nand Kishore 1974
(2) SLR 892.
11.It was also submitted that judgments of CAT were
implemented and higher scale given to as many as 357
persons vide orders dated 28.10.1998 and the petitioners
have deprived the respondents only. Reference was also
made to Fundamental Rule 26, which was relevant for the
purpose of pay fixation on revision.
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 14 of 19

12.On consideration of the respective submissions of the
parties, we are of the view that the conclusion arrived at by
the Full Bench of the learned Tribunal on the basis of which
orders are passed by the Division Benches of the Tribunal
granting benefit to these respondents is legal and in
conformity with the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court.

The Tribunal is right in commenting upon the

circumstances in which directions were given by the
Supreme Court in K.C. Lakhanpal's case (supra) the
purpose of which was to give benefits to other similarly
situated persons and not to take away from them the
benefits which these teachers were otherwise entitled to.
13.That apart, the distinction drawn by the learned Tribunal
between promotion on regular basis and confirmation is
valid and is to be kept in mind. Not only such a distinction
is drawn by the Apex Court in various judgments, as noted
by the Full Bench in the portion extracted above, this is the
view which was taken by the petitioners themselves in their
own O.M. dated 29.10.1998, which was issued on the basis
of minutes dated 6.6.1997. Minutes of the meeting dated
6.6.1997 are placed on record.
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

These are of a meeting
Pg 15 of 19

which was convened by the Principal Secretary (Education)
and all other concerned officers were also present. In these
minutes, it was specifically recorded that prior to 1.4.1988
every government servant had a lien on his lower post till
he was confirmed on the higher post and, therefore,
Teachers/Vice-Principals officiating on higher post were
entitled to selection scale in their substantive post.

The

decision taken was as under:“It was, therefore, decided that prior to
1.4.88, all those PGTs who were promoted
as Vice-Principal before their completing 12
years in the Old Selection grade even
promoted on regular basis but not
confirmed on that post and were officiating
as Vice-Principals were entitled to the
Selection Scale of their substantive post i.e.
P.G.T.”
14.Thus, it was decided to give selection grade even to those
promoted on regular basis but not confirmed on that post.
It was also decided that such PGTs, who were working as
Vice-Principals, were also entitled for selection grade of
PGT.

On the basis of this decision Order No.1 dated

29.10.1998, which was issued “with the prior approval of
the Competent Authority”, inter alia, provided:i)
That they have completed 12 Years of
service in Selection Grade/Senior Scale of
Rs.2000-3500 and are/were working as
Vice-Principals on the dated of grant of
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 16 of 19

Selection Scale. The service of 12 years is
to be counted on the lines as service is
counted for the grant of an increment. The
service
rendered
on
foreign
assignment/deputation and EOL & dies non
shall not qualify for the same and subject to
no compliance of the terms and conditions
of foreign assignment is pending.”
15.Along with this order, list of 357 persons is given who are
given the pay scale in the substantive post they were
holding though this order clearly mentions that in case of
any discrepancy, the matter be referred to E-II Branch of
Directorate of Education, no such discrepancy is pointed
out till date and this includes many persons who are
similarly situated as the respondents herein.

Even when

the counsel for the petitioner was specifically confronted
with the aforesaid, she had no answer to it. Learned
counsel for the respondents also produced communication
dated 9.3.1988 addressed by the Ministry of Human
Resource

Development

(Education

Department),

Government of India to the Directorate of Education of the
petitioner on the subject of “Revision of Pay Scales for
School Teacher” wherein it is clarified that those who are
already in the pre-revised selection grade would be placed
in the senior scale and as they were already screened for
suitability, no further screening would be required.
WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

Pg 17 of 19

It

further mentioned that “Accordingly, it is clarified that for
the purpose of counting service in the newly created senior
grade, the entire period of service rendered in the erstwhile
selection grade may be taken into account.” Our attention
was also drawn to Circular dated 28.3.1988 to the Director
of Education, Delhi, wherein clarifications to certain points
raised were answered. Clarification to question No.8 would
be relevant for our purposes, which reads as under:(8) The teachers availing
Selection grade since 5.9.71
onward have now been
placed in senior scale as per
clarification at Sr. No. 2 of
letter dated 3.11.87. Their
eligibility for Selection grade
in the revised order dated
12.8.87 will be determined
from
the
date,
such
teachers are getting benefit
of Selection grade or 12
years will be counted from
1.1.86. In case a teacher
has been awarded Selection
Grade from 1.1.1986 and
promoted in higher post on
officiating basis, whether he
will be entitled for Senior
scale of the post in which
he/she is promoted taking
into consideration his/her
length of service in the
lower grade.

It may be stated that vide
Point No.2 of clarification
given in our letter No. F.5180/86-UT. I dated 3.11.87, it
has been clarified that those
who are already in the prerevised selection scale will be
placed in the senior scale. It
was further stated that since
they were screened for
suitability for the earlier
selection grade, no further
screening would be required.
Accordingly, it is clarified that
for the purpose of counting
service in the newly created
senior grade, the entire
period of service rendered in
the erstwhile selection grade
may be taken into account.

16.For all these reasons we are of the opinion that orders
passed

by

the

Tribunal

WP(C) Nos.283-86/05 & connected matters

directing

benefit

of

senior

Pg 18 of 19

scale/selection scale given to the respondents herein do
not

call

for

any

interference.

Since

all

these

respondents/Teachers had retired from service long ago
and they have been deprived of the relevant pay scales for
quite some time, the petitioners are directed to complete
the exercise of granting the higher pay scale and give the
arrears so calculated to all these respondents within three
months from today.
17. With these directions, the writ petitions preferred by the

petitioners/Govt. of NCT of Delhi, viz. WP(C) No.28386/2005,

WP(C)

No.4257/2003,

WP(C)

No.4328/2003,

WP(C) No.19795-97/2004, WP(C) No.14088-93/2005 being
devoid of merit are hereby dismissed and the writ petitions
filed by the teachers, viz. WP(C) No.5672/2002, WP(C)
No.3649/2003 and WP(C) No.5865/2003 are allowed.
