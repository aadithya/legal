1.

The Petitioner was appointed in the year 1970 as a Hindi

Typist by the respondents. He has since been confirmed in the said
post. The said post of Hindi Typist was an isolated one, and not
encadred in the Central Secretariat Clerical Services (CSCS), which is
governed by the Central Secretariat Clerical Services Rules (CSCS
Rules). Consequently, even after 28 years of service, the Petitioner was
not given even a single promotion, except upon the up gradation of the

post of Hindi Typist to UDC level. This too was done after the Central
Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (The Tribunal)
intervened vide its order dated 7.12.1995 in O.A. No. 644/1991 at the
behest of the Petitioner. However, there was no change in the duties
and the responsibilities of the Petitioner. In the meantime, other
similarly placed employees who did not belong to any particular cader,
and consequently did not have promotional avenues had represented
for their encaderment in the CSCS and the same was granted.
However, the Petitioner was left out. Even the 5th Central Pay
Commission recommended that the post of Hindi Typist be included in
the cader of CSCS vide para 77.46 of its report.
2.

The Petitioner filed O.A. No. 1254/1996 wherein the

Tribunal directed the respondents to consider the claim of the
Petitioner for encaderment. However, the Respondent, even in the face
of the recommendations of the 5th Central Pay Commission, declined to
grant the said relief, vide their order dated 11.2.1998. The Petitioner
thereupon filed O.A. No. 1941/1998 which was decided by the Tribunal
on 22nd May 2001. The Tribunal substantially allowed the O.A. filed by
the Petitioner, except that while issuing its operative directions, it
made an observation that the Petitioner would be permitted to reckon
his seniority only from the date of his final absorption. The relevant
extract of the order dated 22nd May 2001 in O.A. No. 1941/1998 is
reproduced herein below:

“6. We have carefully considered the matter.
The applicant has been functioning as a Hindi
Typist for the last 28 years without any
promotion. In spite of working as Hindi
Stenographer and Sr. Hindi Translator for some
time he has been reverted to his substantive
post as Hindi Typist. Hence his request for
better treatment by the Government by way of
access to promotional avenues. FCPC, who have
examined his case and recommended the
encadrement of his post in CSCS. So as to
alleviate the difficulties but the same has been
negatived by the respondents on the spacious
arguments that CSCS Rules do not provide for
it, while 24A, permitting relaxation could very
well have been utilized for the above. It cannot
be the intention of the Government that a
person who joins service should not get any
promotion at all in the entire career and should
retire from the very post in which he joined
service. Still the respondents have done nothing
to improve the situation. Their reluctance is all
the more clear when it is found that they have
express their willingness to encadre the post
but without the incumbent. This cannot be
permitted. It is also interesting to note that the
respondents who totally defend and justify the
encadrement in CSCS of ad hoc LDCs/UDCs in
the office of the Registrar of Newspapers are
against the adoption of the same measure in
the case of the applicant though he is also
similarly circumstanced, more so when the
encadrement of just one post with the
incumbent would not prejudice anybody's
interest. respondents have not taken any
concrete steps to give effect to Tribunal's order
except to state that on consideration of the
issue they are not able to do anything. This is a
case where the Tribunal has to enter and do
justice to the applicant and we proceed to do
so.
7. In view of the above, the application
succeeds and is accordingly allowed. The
impugned order dated 11.2.1998 is quashed
and set aside and the respondents are directed
to take action at the earliest and in any event

within two months from the date of the receipt
of this order to encadre the post of Hindi Typist
in CSCS, taking recourse to Rule 24A of the
CSCS Rules, providing for relaxation. The
applicant will have to be absorbed as UDC
in the above cadre but he will be
permitted to reckon his seniority only
from the date of his final absorption. He
would also be entitled for protection of his pay
and allowances being drawn by him.”
(Emphasis supplied)
The Petitioner is aggrieved by the direction whereby his

seniority upon absorption into the CSCS Cadre as UDC has been
directed to be fixed only from the date of absorption, thereby nullifying
his past service for purposes of seniority altogether.
4.

The petitioner has therefore sought a writ of certiorari to

quash the concluding portion of the judgment passed by the Central
Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (the Tribunal) in
O.A. No. 1941/1998, decided on 22.5.2001. The Petitioner has also
sought a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents that his entire
service since 1.8.1970 should be accounted for after the encaderment
of the post held by him of Hindi Typist under the CSCS Rules.
5.

Though the Petitioner has been encadered in the CSCS vide

order dated 23/24th of July 2001 on the post of UDC, on account of the

aforesaid highlighted observations of the Tribunal his service of
nearly 31 years was ignored by the respondent. The Petitioner
therefore represented to the respondents against the same and this
representation was rejected vide order dated 2.8.2002. The Petitioner
thereafter filed O.A. No. 12/2003, which was disposed of by the
W.P. (C) No. 15928/2004

Page 4 of 8

Tribunal on 3.1.2003. The Tribunal held that unless the observations
of the Tribunal in O.A. No. 1941/1998, to the effect that the Petitioner
will be permitted to reckon his seniority only to the date of his final
absorption is deleted, no relief could be granted to the Petitioner.
Accordingly the O.A. was disposed of directing the Petitioner to file an
appropriate application for modification/deletion of the aforesaid
observation of the Tribunal in the order dated 22.5.2001 passed in
O.A. No. 1941/1998.
6.

The Petitioner thereafter filed R.A. No.142/2003 in MA

No.1033/2003 in O.A. No. 1941/1998 which has been dismissed by the

Tribunal vide order dated 2nd December 2003. The Tribunal held that
there was no error apparent on the face of the record and did not go
into the issue whether the aforesaid direction was sustainable or not.
This order passed in R.A.No. 142/2003 dated 2nd December 2003 is also
impugned before us.
7.

The short question that arises for our consideration,

therefore, is whether the Tribunal in the first instance was justified in
directing that the Petitioner while being absorbed as UDC in the cader
of CSCS would be permitted to reckon his seniority only from the date
of his final absorption.
8.

Having given our thoughtful consideration to the matter,

we are of the view that the claim of the Petitioner is entirely justified.
9.

The Petitioner has admittedly rendered service as Hindi

W.P. (C) No. 15928/2004

Page 5 of 8

Typist since 1.8.1970. He was absorbed in the CSCS only with effect
from 27.7.2001. The effect of reckoning his seniority in the CSCS w.e.f.
27.7.2001, in the grade of UDC is that his nearly 31 years of service
has been wiped out and he would be ranked junior to all other UDCs in
the cadre of CSCS appointed before the date of his absorption i.e.
21.7.2001.
10.

The Petitioner has drawn our attention to the order passed

by the Tribunal in O.A. No. 2013/1998 dated 3rd February 2001 in the
case of O.P. Verma vs. UOI and others. The Petitioner, in that case
was an Electronic Typewriter Operator. Like the Petitioner he also
sought encaderment of the isolated post held by him in the CSCS. The
said OA was allowed by the Tribunal. However, no such limitation
regarding the fixation of his seniority was imposed upon that
Petitioner. Even the writ petition filed by the UOI being W.P. (C) No.
2943/2001 against the said order by the Tribunal was rejected by this
Court on 8.3.2002. The UOI had challenged the order of the Tribunal in
the case of OP Verma by taking the stand that the Government of India
was agreeable for encadrement of vacant posts in CSCS cadre, but was
not agreeable to encader the occupied posts of Electronic Typewriter
Operator into CSCS on regular basis. This stand of UOI was expressly
rejected by this court in its aforesaid judgment. Operative part of the
order of this Court reads as follows:
“We do not find any infirmity in the aforesaid
order passed by the Tribunal. There is no logic
W.P. (C) No. 15928/2004

Page 6 of 8

in the stand of the petitioners that while they
are willing to encadre the occupied post of ETO.
The stand is absolutely arbitrary, unfair and
unreasonable. The Respondent has served
in the capacity of ETO for a period of 23
years. His 23 years service cannot be lost
just because the petitioners are not filling
to encadre the occupied post of ETO while
they have no objection to encadrement of
the vacant posts of ETOs.
We do not find any merit in the writ
petition. Accordingly, the writ petition
fails and is hereby dismissed.”
(emphasis supplied)
11.

The Petitioner also argues that in the case of OP Verma Shri

Verma had to initiate CP No.12/2004 wherein the respondents UOI
once again resisted the implementation of the order of the Tribunal on
the ground that the grant of seniority to Shri Verma from the date of
his initial appointment as ETO would upset the seniority of UDCs in the
CSCS. However, this submission was rejected by the Tribunal.
Thereafter, vide order dated 28th June 2004, Shri OP Verma was
granted the seniority as UDC with effect from 1.12.1975 which was the
date of his appointment as ETO.
12.

The Petitioner has also placed reliance on the decision of

the Supreme Court in UOI and Others vs. Shri Pratap Narain, JT
1992 (3) SC 423 and, in our view, rightly so. The Supreme Court in this
case has held that the benefit of continuous officiation towards
seniority is not confined to the period spent against a cader post, but
includes the period spent against an excadre post.

In view of the aforesaid, we allow this petition and quash

the order of the Tribunal passed in R.A. No.142/2003 dated 2.12.2003,
since the order of the Tribunal has been passed in ignorance of the
aforesaid decisions of this court and the Apex Court. We also quash the
direction of the Tribunal in its order dated 22.5.2001 in O.A. No.
1941/1998 to the extent that it directed that the Petitioner would be
permitted to reckon his seniority only from the date of his final
absorption as UDC in the CSCS cadre. We direct the Respondents to
count the seniority of the Petitioner in the Central Secretariat Clerical
Services Cadre since 1.8.1970 in the rank of LDC, and from 17.12.1995
in the rank of UDC. With these directions, this Writ Petition is disposed
off.
Parties are left to bear their respective costs.
