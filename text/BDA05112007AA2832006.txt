This petition is under Section 11 (6) of the Arbitration and

Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the said Act') for
appointment of the sole arbitrator for adjudication of the disputes
between the petitioner and the respondent as set out in paragraph 7 of
the petition. The learned counsel for the respondent submits that there
are no arbitrable disputes between the parties and, therefore, there is no
question of appointment of an arbitrator and/ or invocation of the
ARB. P 283/06
Page No.1 of 11

provisions of Section 11(6) of the said Act.

He submitted that a

meeting was held between the petitioner and the respondents on
10.04.2003 to enable the parties to reconcile the accounts between them
and to review all the bills submitted by the petitioner to the respondents
for all the orders placed by the respondents on the petitioner in respect
of the respondents' projects at Rajrappa, Gidi and Madhuband. The
minutes of the meeting, which have been placed as Annexure C to the
petition, indicate that after discussion it was mutually agreed that the
respondents will pay to the petitioner an amount of Rs 56 lacs towards
various works executed by the petitioner against all of the respondents'
orders for civil, mechanical, piping and related jobs till date for the said
projects. It was also agreed between the parties that the said amount of
Rs 56 lacs is by way of full and final settlement against all of the balance
invoices raised by the petitioner on the respondents till that date. The
minutes also indicated that the amount of Rs 56 lacs was to be paid in
three instalments. The first instalment of Rs 20 lacs was to be paid by
the end of April, 2003, the second instalment of Rs 20 lacs by the end of
May, 2003 and the last instalment of Rs 16 lacs by the end of June,
2003.

2.

The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that

although the matter had been finally settled, an amount of Rs 7 lacs
remained to be paid.

A notice was issued by the petitioner to the

respondents on 27.09.2004 wherein the payment of Rs 49 lacs is
admitted.

Pursuant to this, a further meeting took place between the

petitioner and the respondents on 12.10.2004. This meeting was held
with reference to the earlier meeting on 10.04.2003 and the petitioner's
request for immediate payment of the balance amount of Rs 7 lacs as
well as in respect of the amounts payable by the respondents to the
petitioner concerning other works which included civil works for coal
sheds carried out by the petitioner for the respondents at the said sites.
The minutes of the meeting of 12.10.2004 have been placed as Annexure
F to the petition and they reveal that after discussion it had been
mutually agreed that the respondents would release the balance amount
of Rs 7 lacs and also a further sum of Rs 18,41,953/- in respect of the
civil works for the coal sheds. It was agreed that the sum of Rs 7 lacs
towards the balance amount in respect of the meeting dated 10.04.2003,
would be released by a cheque No. 914357 dated 16.10.2004. The other
amount of Rs 18,41,953/- payable in respect of the civil works for coal
sheds was agreed to be released by the respondents by three separate
ARB. P 283/06
Page No.3 of 11

cheques for Rs 6,00,000/-, Rs 5,41,953/- and Rs 7,00,000/- by cheques
dated 15.11.2004, 15.12.2004 and 15.01.2005 respectively. It was also
noted in the minutes of the said meeting that the said arrangement was
by way of full and final settlement of all invoices raised by the petitioner
on the respondents till date against all purchases/ work orders placed by
the respondent on the petitioner. It was also agreed that the petitioner
would not raise any other claim on the respondents for any other dues
and that the minutes of 12.10.2004 superseded all letters / claims etc.
raised by either party on the other. Significantly, the petitioner had also
agreed to withdraw the legal notice dated 27.09.2004 and that the same
be treated as null and void. Consequent to the said arrangement arrived
at in the said minutes of 12.10.2004, the entire payment has been made
and received by the petitioner on the dates indicated above.

3.

In this background, the learned counsel for the respondents

submitted that the entire disputes stood resolved by the said minutes of
12.10.2004 which have also been agreed upon by the parties and,
therefore, there does not exist any arbitrable dispute for which
appointment of an arbitrator is necessary. The learned counsel for the
respondents placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in the
ARB. P 283/06
Page No.4 of 11

case of Nithani Steels Ltd. v. Associated Constructions: 1995 Supp (3)
SCC 324.

4.

The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that while it

is true that meetings took place between the parties on 10.04.2003 and
12.10.2004, the minutes of the meeting of 12.10.2004 were prepared by
the respondents and the petitioner was made to sign the same under
coercion and under duress. Therefore, it was submitted by the learned
counsel for the petitioner that the same cannot be acted upon and
consequently there are disputes pending between the petitioner and the
respondents. He submitted that by virtue of the notice dated 27.09.2004,
a demand of approximately Rs 96 lacs was made on the respondents and
this in itself would indicate that the settlement for an amount of Rs 56
lacs could only have been obtained under duress and coercion.

In

respect of the balance claim of Rs 19.64 lacs mentioned in the letter
dated 27.09.2004, the respondent had agreed to a sum of Rs 18,41,953/-.
The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the original
agreement arrived at in the meeting of 10.04.2003 was not adhered to by
the respondent inasmuch as amount of Rs 7 lacs was admittedly due and
payable even beyond the schedule prescribed under the said minutes.
ARB. P 283/06
Page No.5 of 11

According to the learned counsel for the petitioner this clearly indicates
that there are disputes which still exist between the petitioner and the
respondent and for this reason the appointment of an arbitrator would be
necessary. He placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of Shree Ram Mills Ltd. v. Utility Premises (P) Ltd. : 2007 (1)
Arb. LR 517 (SC).

5.

After having heard the arguments advanced by the counsel

for the parties, I may straightaway say that I am in agreement with the
submissions made by the counsel for the respondent that as of now there
are no arbitral disputes pending between the parties. They had fully and
finally settled their disputes by virtue of the meeting of 12.10.2004, the
substance of which is recorded in the form of the minutes which have
been referred to above. The decision in the case of Nathani Steels Ltd.
(supra) would be squarely applicable to the present case.

In that

decision the parties had fully and finally settled amongst themselves and
the settlement was also reduced to writing. The said settlement had also
been signed by the parties. The only issue raised there was that a
calculation mistake had crept in with regard to the amount in question
which had been mentioned in the settlement agreement and it was for
ARB. P 283/06
Page No.6 of 11

this purpose that the arbitration agreement was sought to be invoked.
The Supreme Court after considering its earlier decisions in the cases of
P. K. Ramaiah and Co. v. Chairman & Managing Director, National
Thermal Poer Corpn.: 1994 (3) SCC 126 and State of Maharashtra v.
Nav Bharat Builders: 1994 Supp (3) SCC 83 came to the conclusion
that after there was a full and final settlement amongst the parties, there
was no scope for raising an issue with regard to there being any
arbitrable disputes surviving the said settlement. The Supreme Court,
referring to the facts of the case before it, observed that once the parties
had arrived at a settlement in respect of any dispute or difference arising
under a contract and that dispute or difference is amicably settled by way
of a final settlement by and between the parties, then, unless that
settlement is set aside in proper proceedings, it cannot lie in the mouth
of one of the parties to the settlement to spurn it on the ground that it
was a mistake and proceed to invoke the Arbitration clause.

The

Supreme Court observed that if this is permitted the sanctity of a
contract, the settlement also being a contract, would be wholly lost and it
would be open to one party to take the benefit under the settlement and
then to question the same on the ground of mistake without having the
settlement set aside. The Supreme Court finally observed:ARB. P 283/06
Page No.7 of 11

“In the circumstances, we think that in the instant case
since the dispute or difference was finally settled and
payments were made as per the settlement, it was not
open to the respondent unilaterally to treat the settlement
as non est and proceed to invoke the Arbitration clause.
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the High Court was
wrong in the view that it took.”
6.

The decision in Shree Ram Mills Ltd. (supra) cited on behalf

of the petitioner would not be of any assistance to the petitioner. In that
decision, the earlier decision in Nathani Steels Ltd. (supra) was noticed
and the facts in Shree Ram Mills Ltd. (supra) were distinguished from
the facts obtaining in Nathani Steels Ltd. (supra).

This would be

apparent from the following observation:“Though the observations at the first blush appear to be
in favour of the appellants, on the closer look they are
not so. This was a case where in a contract the parties
had amicably settled their disputes and the parties also
did not dispute that the they have arrived at such a
settlement. It is under those circumstances that the
observations were made. However, we do not think that
the facts in the present case suggest that there was a full
and final settlement in between the parties in respect of
the issue regarding 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI and that a MoU
was signed wherein the respondent and Bhupendra
Capital and Finance Limited who was the party to the
third agreement, acknowledged that they were left with
rights limited to 86,725 sq.ft. of FSI. It must be seen that
there is no reference whatsoever to any consideration as
regards the 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI, much less to the figure
of Rs. 1.20 crores in this MoU. As to what would be the
effect of this MoU on the rights of the respondent herein
would not be for us to go into but it is certain that the
ARB. P 283/06
Page No.8 of 11

issue had not been settled completely. In Nathani's case
(supra) the issue was admittedly settled and that was not
disputed by the parties thereto. Here the parties and more
particularly the respondents are seriously disputing that
the issue regarding 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI was finally
settled in between the parties. It would be only for the
Arbitral Tribunal to decide the effect of the respondent
having signed the MoU. We have pointed out earlier that
this MoU cannot be said to be in the nature of a contract.
In Nathani's case the settlement was viewed as a
contract and it was, therefore, reiterated that if the parties
are allowed to wriggle out of their obligation from the
contract, no sanctity would be left to the settlement
which are in the nature of a contract. It is for this reason
that, in our opinion, the decision in Nathani's case is not
applicable to the present facts. We also reiterate at this
juncture that the cloud on 2500 sq. mtrs. of land which is
inexplicably connected with the FSI of 1,20,000 sq. ft.
created by the undertaking given before the Delhi High
Court still remains looming large and remained so even
on the date of the MoU. It is for this reason also that we
are of the clear opinion that there was no final settlement
of the issue regarding 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI even by the
MoU dated 19.1.2005. If that was so, it is clear that there
was live issue in between the parties and the parties were
at loggerheads on that issue.”
The facts of the present case are that the parties had entered into a
settlement on 10.04.2003. It was agreed that the respondents would pay
a sum of Rs 56 lacs to the petitioner in the full and final settlement
thereof.

The petitioner has not contended that this settlement was

obtained under duress or coercion. As such the amount of Rs 56 lacs
payable under the contract in question stood crystallized. The issue
ARB. P 283/06
Page No.9 of 11

remaining was whether the balance sum of Rs 7 lacs was payable or not.
That issue was settled by the second meeting of 12.10.2004 where the
respondent agreed to pay the same by a cheque dated 16.10.2004 itself.
The said amount also stood paid.

Therefore, in my view, it cannot be

contended by the petitioner that the settlement of 12.10.2004 qua the
contract in question was obtained under duress or coercion. Apart from
this it must also be noted that the meeting did take place on 12.10.2004
and that the minutes were signed on that date itself by the parties. Had
there been any coercion or duress, it was incumbent upon the petitioner
to have taken objection to it at the earliest opportunity. The petitioner
only raised an objection for the first time on 30.03.2005 by way of a
protest letter which was also duly replied to by the respondents on
21.04.2005. It is noteworthy that the protest that was raised by the
petitioner was after approximately 2-1/2 months of having received the
entire payment under the agreement / settlement arrived at between the
parties on 12.10.2004.

The last of the payments under the said

agreement was to have been made on 15.01.2005 and which was
admittedly made on that date. Therefore, apart from the fact that the
petitioner cannot raise a dispute without having the memorandum set
aside in an appropriate proceeding, it is more than clear that the action
ARB. P 283/06
Page No.10 of 11

on the part of the petitioner is a mere afterthought.

7.

Consequently, I hold that there is no arbitrable dispute

pending between the parties as a result of which this petition has to fail.
It is dismissed. No order as to costs.
