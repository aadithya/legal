application under Sections 14 and 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1940
seeking directions to the Arbitrator (respondent no.2) to file the award
dated 28.5.1999 with the arbitration proceedings in this case and to
make the award Rule of the Court.
2.

In response to notice of this petition being sent to the

Arbitrator, the Arbitrator (respondent no.2) filed the award in original
alongwith the arbitration proceedings before this Court in the present
suit. Notice of filing of the award was sent to the respondent being the
Contractor. The respondent filed objections against the said award and
those objections filed by the respondent were registered as IA No.

1022/2001.
3.

By this judgment I would like to decide the objections (IA

No. 1022/2001) filed by the respondent against the arbitral award
dated 28.5.1999 made and published by the sole Arbitrator Ms.Shail
Goel.
4.

Briefly stated the facts of the case are that the petitioner

had awarded a contract to the respondent for supply of 278 numbers
of extinguishers, fire foam 50 liter capacity vide contract awarded on
15.10.1990. In terms of Clause 16 of the said contract, the respondent
was required to furnish the advance sample of extinguisher, fire foam
50 liter capacity to the petitioner within six weeks from the date of the
contract. The time period prescribed in the contract for furnishing the
advance sample by the respondent was extended from time to time.
The respondent is alleged to had furnished the advance sample for
approval to the petitioner on 20.12.1991 but the said sample was
rejected. Later on, vide communication dated 29.1.1992 addressed by
the petitioner to the respondent, the condition for furnishing the
advance sample was waived and the delivery period for supply of
stocks i.e of extinguisher fire foam 50 liter capacity was re-scheduled
and the respondent was given time for supply of stocks upto 30.7.1992
subject to levy of liquidated damages and certain other conditions. The
conditions imposed for rescheduling delivery period was allegedly not
acceptable to the respondent and, therefore, the stock in question was

CS(OS) No. 1596A/2005

Page 2 of 5

not supplied by the respondent to the petitioner. The contract in
question was cancelled by the petitioner on 12.10.1992 and the said
cancellation resulted into disputes and differences between the parties
under the contract. The parties while entering into the contract in
question had agreed for referring their dispute under the contract for
arbitration to a sole Arbitrator to be appointed by the DGS&D in terms
of Clause 24 of the general conditions of contract between the parties.
5.

Since the disputes and differences arose between the

parties under the contract, the said disputes were arbitrated by
Ms.Shail Goel appointed as sole Arbitrator by DGS&D in terms of
Clause 24 of the contract. The petitioner had made a claim of
Rs.5,19,454.20 p with interest at 12% p.a against the respondent
before the Arbitrator and this claim was on account of alleged loss
suffered by the petitioner for non-supply of stocks by the respondent.
The respondent had also filed a claim to the tune of more than Rs.5
lacs before the learned Arbitrator.
6.

The learned Arbitrator vide impugned award has allowed

the claim of the petitioner in full i.e to the tune of Rs.5,19,454.20 p
with interest at 12% p.a from the date of award till the date of
realisation whereas the claim of the respondent has been rejected in
toto.
7.

In terms of arbitration agreement between the parties, the

parties had agreed that if the value of the claim in a reference before
CS(OS) No. 1596A/2005

Page 3 of 5

the Arbitrator exceeds Rs.1 lac, the Arbitrator was required to give a
reasoned award. A perusal of the impugned award would reveal that
the learned Arbitrator has not given any reason for allowing the claim
of the petitioner and rejecting the claim of the respondent. The
impugned award is thus contrary to the express terms of the contract
between the parties.
8.

Mr. Khorana, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

respondent has contended that this Court has already set aside an
identical award given by the same Arbitrator in case titled Union of
India

vs.

Shankar

Vijay

Timber

Industries

reported

as

2003(67)DRJ454. This factual contention urged on behalf of the
respondent is not disputed by the counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner. Under the circumstances, I am of the view that in order to
maintain parity and even otherwise since the impugned award is
contrary to the express terms of the arbitration agreement between
the parties, the said award is liable to be set aside and the matter is
remitted back for reconsideration before the learned Arbitrator.
9.

In view of the above and having regard to the facts and

circumstances of the case, the objections are allowed. The impugned
award is set aside. The case is remitted back for rehearing and for
passing of a reasoned award before the learned Arbitrator. The Court
has been informed that Ms. Shail Goel who has passed and published
the impugned award has since retired and, therefore, the petitioner

through DGS&D is hereby directed to get this case re-decided from
another Arbitrator in terms of Clause 24 of the contract between the
parties. The petitioner shall send a notice of appointment of another
Arbitrator to the respondent within a period of six weeks from today.
10.

In view of the above, the present petition stands disposed

of.
