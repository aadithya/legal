V.B. GUPTA, J.
Present appeal has been filed under Section 260A of
the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short 'Act') against the order
ITA No.820/2006

Page 1 of 8

dated 23rd December, 2005 passed by the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal (in short 'Tribunal').
2.

Brief facts are that a search under Section 132(1) of

the Act was conducted on 7th August, 1997 at the business
premises of the Assessee

firm and also the residential

premises of its partners. The Assessee firm is engaged in
the business of sale and purchase of timber/plywood.
Consequent to the search, a notice under Section 158BC of
the Act dated 28th April, 1992 was issued by the Assessing
Officer requiring the Assessee to file its return of income
for the block period 1st April, 1987 to 7th August, 1997. In
response thereto,

the Assessee filed its return showing

undisclosed income of Rs. 4,74,119/-.
of

During the course

assessment proceedings, it was noticed that for the

above mentioned period the Assessee had shown purchases
of Rs.11,77,666/- and sale of Rs.20,45,039/-. The value of
closing stock as on 7th August, 1997 was shown at
Rs.4,10,600/-. The Assessing Officer, however, noted that
on the date of search, the search party had prepared an
inventory of stock, which was valued at Rs.7,41,797/-.

The

Assessee was asked to explain the difference in the closing
ITA No.820/2006

Page 2 of 8

stock to which he replied that the valuation carried out by
the search party has not been made correctly since,

the

search party did not measure the stock physically with
regard to each and every item of stock lying at the business
premises of the Assessee.

Instead, a rough method of

valuing the closing stock stacked in blocks was adopted.
After the conclusion of the search on 7th August, 1997, the
Assessee had physically measured and inventorised each
and every item of stock, which worked out to Rs.4,10,576/and the said amount was considered for the purpose of the
filing of the return. The Assessee also submitted that there
were

certain

calculation

errors

made

while

making

calculation in the inventory sheets complied by the search
party.
3.

The Assessing Officer rejected the plea of the

Assessee that the inventory prepared by the search party
was not correct, since the inventory was prepared by the
Departmental Officer with the aid and assistance of the
Assessee's partner Sh.Samir Chawla and its perusal reveals
that it contains description of each and every piece of wood
available at the premises of the Assessee. The Assessing
ITA No.820/2006

Page 3 of 8

Officer further observed that the Assessee has not been
maintaining any stock register for any of the financial years
comprised with the block period and the closing stock was
being worked out by the Assessee only as a balancing
figure. However, Assessing Officer found force in the plea
of the Assessee that certain errors had crept in the
inventory prepared by the search party.
4.

The Assessee being aggrieved with the order of

Assessing Officer filed an appeal before Commissioner
Income Tax (A) who decided the matter in favour of the
Assessee. Thereafter, Revenue filed an appeal before the
Tribunal and the Tribunal set aside the order of the
Assessing Officer and restored the addition of Rs.3,11,267/made by the Assessing Officer. On the second ground the
appeal filed by the Revenue was dismissed.
5.

The present appeal has been filed challenging the

decision

of

the

Tribunal

restoring

the

addition

of

Rs.3,11,267/- made by the Assessing Officer.
6.

It has been contended by the learned counsel for the

Appellant that the Tribunal did not appreciate that the
timber is measured in terms of length x breadth x width.
ITA No.820/2006

Page 4 of 8

From Annexure P-1, it is evident that the breadth and width
was taken as “4 to 5 ft”, whereas, in reality, breadth and
width of any log/piece of timber can never be more than
“12 to 15 inches”. Further the Tribunal failed to appreciate
that the Appellant on the basis of parallel books of account
had filed trading and profit & loss accounts, wherein each
and every purchase and sale was duly recorded.
7.

The dispute in question pertains to adoption of closing

stock as on 7th August, 1997.

Since the search was

conducted on this date, therefore, the block period for the
purpose of assessment ends on 7th August, 1997. During
the

course

of

search,

inventory

was

prepared

and

according to it the stock was computed at Rs.7,41,797/-.
The Assessee was not found to be maintaining any stock
register and this fact has been admitted by Sh.Samir
Chawla, partner of the Assessee firm whose statement was
recorded on the date of search.

Sh.Samir Chawla in his

statement states that he has no idea as to how much stock
in quantity and in value is lying in the premises. Further,
in reply to question “How do you value the stock?”, he
stated, “I do not have any idea.” So the Assessee was not
ITA No.820/2006

Page 5 of 8

maintaining any stock register at the time of the search and
this aspect has been dealt with the Assessing Officer in his
order. The relevant portion of the order of the Assessing
Officer read as under:-

8.

“ It is an admitted position that the
Assessee has not been maintaining any
stock register and that for any of the
financial years and that the closing
stock has been worked out only as a
balancing figure by the Assessee in this
very reply dated 23rd August, 1999.”
It was only in the return of income filed in response to

notice under Section 158BC on 12th July, 1999, the
Assessee adopted the stock as on 7th August, 1997 at
Rs.4,10,600/-. The inventory in this case was prepared on
7th August, 1997 whereas, Assessee waited to file its
return of income on 12th July, 1999, wherein the stock was
differently depicted.

There is nothing on record to show

as to what prevented the Assessee from immediately filing
the stock position after the search, if the inventory
prepared on 7th August, 1997 was wrong. Therefore, this
plea of the Assessee that the stock and inventory prepared
by the search party was wrong taken after more than two
years, cannot be accepted and as such we have no reason

ITA No.820/2006

Page 6 of 8

to disagree with the findings given by the Tribunal.
9.

With the regard to the submissions made by the

learned counsel for the Assessee that valuation done by the
Department was not made correctly as actual physical
measurements were not done at the time of the search, it
may be pointed out that the inventory was prepared at the
time of the search by the officials with the aid and
assistance of Asseessee's partner Sh.Samir Chawla and in
the inventory, description of each and every piece of teak
and other pieces have been recorded in “feet and inches”
and thereafter the quantity was written in “Cft” as and
where applicable and after multiplying with the rate,
correct valuation was arrived at.

As already held above,

the Assessee has not been maintaining any register and the
closing stock has been worked out by the Assessee only as
a balancing figure, so under these circumstances the
inventory prepared by Assessee after the date of search has
no meaning.
10.

Accordingly, we hold that there is no infirmity in the

order passed by the Tribunal. Thus, the order of Tribunal
does not give rise to a question of law, much less a
ITA No.820/2006

Page 7 of 8

substantial question of law, to fall within the limited
purview of Section 260-A of the Income Tax Act, which is
confined to entertaining only such appeal against the order
which involves a substantial question of law.
11.

Accordingly, the present appeal is, hereby, dismissed.
