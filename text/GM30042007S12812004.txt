This order disposes of IA NO. 5540/2005 filed by the

defendant under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure
seeking rejection of the plaint in this suit for specific performance
and permanent injunctiion filed by the plaintiff.
2.

It is trite that for consideration of an application seeking

rejection of a plaint on the grounds mentioned under Order 7 Rule
11 Code of Civil Procedure, the court is precluded from
examination of anything other than the plaint and the documents
CS(OS) No. 1281/2004

filed by the plaintiff.
3.

The plaintiff has brought the suit on the averments that on

27th March, 2004, the plaintiff entered into an agreement to
purchase the defendant's property bearing no. 5/78, Subhash
Nagar, New Delhi-110027 admeasuring 100 sq. yards for a total
sale consideration of Rs.23,15,000/- . The plaintiff has urged that
it paid a sum of Rs.1,65,000/- in cash to the defendant as earnest
money which was acknowledged in the agreement to sell and
purchase executed by the defendant. Inasmuch as the defendant
avoided execution of the necessary documents and getting the suit
property transferred in her name from the concerned authorities,
which was the Land and Development Office, Nirman Bhawan,
New Delhi and also failed to obtain the requisite permission for
transfer of the suit within the stipulated period of 120 days, the
plaintiff repeatedly approached the defendant to do the needful.
The plaintiff was required to make payment of the balance amount
of Rs.21,50,000/- within 120 days which came to an end on 25th
July, 2007.

The defendant was required to discharge the

obligation imposed on her within the same period.
4.

As the defendant kept giving false assurances yet did not

discharge her obligations in terms of the agreement to sell dated
CS(OS) No. 1281/2004

page 2 of 9

27th March, 2004. Instead of doing the needful, the defendant sent
a notice through a telegram to the plaintiff on 18th July, 2004,
notifying the plaintiff that in case payment was not made on 19th
July, 2004, the earnest money would stand forfeited.
5.

The plaintiff was thus constrained to get served a legal notice

dated 22nd July, 2004 within the stipulated period, by registered
AD post as well as UPC to the defendant clearly notifying the
defendant that the plaintiff was to make the balance sale
consideration of RS.21,50,000/- and called upon the defendant to
come forward and accept the same as also to do all the necessary
acts under the agreement.
In the reply dated 28th July, 2004 sent by the defendant after
the expiry of the 120 days, the defendant notified the plaintiff that
the property has been transferred in her name and called upon the
plaintiff to pay the balance sale consideration. The plaintiff was
constrained to file the suit for the reason that though he
approached the defendant with the balance sale consideration,
however she failed to produce the requisite documents issued by
the Land and Development Office in her favour and also failed to
show any documents which would have evidenced up to date
deposit of the house tax, water and electricity charges as well as
CS(OS) No. 1281/2004

page 3 of 9

damages complaining the plaintiff to seek the relief of injunction
and specific performance of the agreement dated 27th March,
2004. The plaintiff has urged that he has all along been ready and
willing to complete his part of the agreement.
6.

It is noteworthy that in this matter, admission and denial of

the documents filed by the parties has been recorded on 15 th
December, 2006.

The defendant has admitted the signatures on the documents
dated 27th March, 2004. The defendant has also admitted the
telegram dated 18th July, 2004 which has been marked Exhibit P-3
and reply to the legal notice dated 28th July, 2004 issued on behalf
of the defendant has been admitted and marked Exhibit P-2.
7.

This application has been filed by the defendant urging that

the signature of the defendant is placed in the space for the
signatures of the purchaser in the documents dated 27th March,
2004 and that consequently the plaintiff has no cause of action to
maintain the present suit meritting rejection of the plaint under
Order 7 Rule 11(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure. In support of
this contention, Mr. R.K. Jain, learned counsel for the defendant
has relied on a pronouncement of this court reported at 135,
CS(OS) No. 1281/2004

page 4 of 9

2006 DLT 56 Randhir Singh Chandok v. Vipin Bansal
and has also urged that the agreement cum receipt is inadmissible
for want of proper stamp and registration under Section 17(a) of
the Registration Act, 1908.
8.

In 2006 (86) DRJ 374 Ajit Singh Vs. Ramesh Vohra

& Anr., the court held that for the purposes of consideration of
the issues as to whether the plaint discloses any cause of action or
not, all the pleadings in the plaint have to be treated as correct and
the defence has not to be looked into. The court emphasised the
principle that the plaint had to be read meaningfully.

Rejection of a plaint is undoubtedly a serious matter in as
much as it would terminate the proceedings before the court and
consequently have serious repercussions on the rights of the
parties. The same cannot be had recourse to lightly and requires a
serious construction of the plaint and the documents relied upon
by the plaintiff.
9.

For this reason, the courts have emphasised that the

pleadings have to be meaningfully read. In this behalf, it would be
instructive to advert to the pronouncement reported in AIR 1984
Punjab & Haryana 126 Harnam Singh Vs. Surjit Singh.
CS(OS) No. 1281/2004

In 88 (2000) DLT 769 Inspiration Clothes & U Vs.

Colby International Limited, it was held thus:“10. .... No doubt that where the plaint is based on
a document, the Court will be entitled to consider
the said document also and ascertain if a cause of
action is disclosed in the plaint, but validity of the
document cannot be considered at this stage. To
enable a Court to reject a plaint on the ground that
it does not disclose a cause of action, it should look
at the plaint and documents accompanying the
plaint only and nothing else. The Court, however,
cannot look at the defence of the defendant or the
documents relied upon by the defendant. See D.
Ramchandran Vs. R.V Janakiraman & Ors. (1999)
3 SCC 267=II (1999) SLT 484=II (1999) CLT 109
(SC). Learned Single Judge fell in error in placing
reliance upon the material supplied by the
defendant, which alone is sufficient to set aside the
impugned order. Learned Single Judge instead of
proceeding to reject the plaint dismissed the suit,
which approach is also erroneous. The effect of
dismissal of suit is altogether different and distinct
from the effect of rejection of the plaint. In case
plaint is rejected under Order 7 Rule 11, CPC, filing
of a fresh plaint in respect of the same cause of
action is specifically, permitted under Rule 13 of
Order 7, CPC. Altogether different consequence
follows in the event of dismissal of suit, which has
the effect of precluding the plaintiff to file a fresh
suit on the same cause of action. Rejection of plaint
takes away the very basis of the suit rendering as if
there was no suit at all or that no suit was
instituted.
Order of dismissal of suit while
recognising the existence of a suit indicates its
termination. While deciding the application under
Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC, learned Single Judge
ought not and could not have dismissed the suit.
Even in the decision of the Supreme Court in T.
Anvandandam's case (supra), relied upon by
CS(OS) No. 1281/2004

11.

learned counsel for the appellant, it was held that if
on a meaningful – not formal – reading of the
plaint it is manifestly vexatious and meritless, in
the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, the
Trial Court should exercise his power under Order
7 Rule 11, CPC taking care to see that the ground
mentioned therein is fulfilled. In order to fulfil
that ground bare allegation made in the plaint and
the documents filed therewith were required to be
looked into which in the instant case clearly
disclosed at least a cause of action against the
defendant that defendant was liable for damages
for its acts of omission and commission. It would
be an altogether different situation that the
plaintiff might not ultimately succeed in obtaining
a decree against the defendant or that Court might
come to the conclusion that suit would not be
maintainable against the defendant and that
plaintiff had a cause of action only against
defendant's principal and its parent unit in Hong
Kong, but such aspect could not have been gone
into at this stage. Three paragraphs of the plaint
quoted above in our view do clearly disclose cause
of action for the plaintiff to claim damages.”
So far as admissibility of the documents is concerned, the

same would therefore be considered at an appropriate stage.
However it becomes necessary to examine the plea of the
defendant that there is no agreement to sell entered into by her.
12.

So far as consideration at the present stage for the purposes

of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC is concerned, this court is required to
consider the plaint and the documents of the plaintiff. There is no
dispute that the documents dated 27th March, 2004 contains the
signature of the defendant and the document has been accepted
CS(OS) No. 1281/2004

page 7 of 9

as Exhibit P-1. The defendant has called upon the plaintiff to pay
the balance sale consideration and to come forward for the
registration of documents by its telegraphic notice dated 18th July,
2004 and the reply to the legal notice dated 28th July, 2004 which
have been exhibited as Exhibit P-2 and P-3 on record.

The

plaintiff has stated in her plaint that the plaintiff has paid earnest
money and he has been ready and willing to perform his part of
contract so far as the agreement to sell is concerned, I find that the
defendant in all documents prior to her written statement has
accepted the existence of the agreement to sell.
13.

In the case reported at 135 (2006) DLT 56 Randhir

Chandok v. Vipin Bansal, the plaintiff has not signed the
documents and it was held that it was lacking in mutuality and
therefore held to be an unenforceable agreement to sell. It was for
this reason also held that the document was not an agreement to
sell but at best would be a memorandum of tentative
understanding between the parties and it was in this background
that the court came to a conclusion that the suit for specific
performance was not maintainable.
14.

In the instant case, there is no dispute that the documents

dated 27th March, 2004 bears the signatures of the defendant.
CS(OS) No. 1281/2004

page 8 of 9

There is also no dispute that the defendant has received the
earnest money mentioned in the document. The defendant has
herself called upon the plaintiff to come forward to complete the
transaction of sale by her telegram (Exhibit P-2) and reply to the
notice (Exhibit P-3). The judgment of this court in Randhir Singh
Chandok's case has thus no application to the facts of this case.
15.

In this view of the matter, this application is wholly

misconceived.
16.

I find that this application was filed in the year 2005 and

adjudication in the present case has been delayed eversince. The
defendant/applicant is therefore liable to pay costs.
In these circumstances, the application is dismissed subject
to payment of Rs.15,000/- as costs.
