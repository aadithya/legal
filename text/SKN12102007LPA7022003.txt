SANJIV KHANNA, J. :
C.M. NO. 1699/2003 :
1.

This is an application for condonation of delay of 216 days in

filing of this intra court appeal against the judgment dated 17

th

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 2

December, 2002 passed by the learned Single Judge in the Writ
Petition (Civil) No. 2300/1997. This application was allowed vide
th

Order dated 9 November, 2005. The Supreme Court allowed the
appeal filed by the respondent-Mr. R.S. Jindal by its order dated 3

rd

November, 2003 with the direction that this application would be
heard afresh along with the present Letters Patent Appeal filed by the
appellant-Delhi Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as
DDA, for short).
2.

The Respondent has relied upon several judgments. We do not

propose to separately refer to these judgments as the principles of
Law are well settled. Delay in filing of an appeal has to be
satisfactorily or reasonably explained. However, it is not each days
delay that is to be put under scanner nor is it a fault finding exercise
by the Courts. Unless it is a case of gross negligence, Courts are
liberal in condoning delays where proper explanation and cause for
the delay has been set out. Courts dispense justice and therefore
unless there are reasons to hold that the delay was deliberately
occasioned for gaining an advantage and benefit, a meritorious

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 3

matter should not be dismissed on the ground of limitation. At the
same-time we are gradually but certainly moving in the direction of
stricter compliance with provisions prescribing time limits and
limitation. Normally, no distinction is made between an application for
condonation of delay filed by a private party and the Government or
public authorities. Government and public authorities should comply
with the limitations periods prescribed by law just as it's subjects, if
not lead by setting an example. However, Courts are conscious that
exerting standard should not be applied in all circumstances and care
has to taken about disabilities and the ground reality. The Supreme
Court in the case of State of Haryana versus Chandramani and
others reported in (1996) 3 SCC 132 has accepted the fact that on
account of impersonal machinery, file pushing and inherent
bureaucratic methodology imbued in Government and public
authorities, decision making process is slow and considerable time is
taken, thereby causing delay, sometimes intentionally and sometimes
otherwise. In these circumstances the Supreme Court has held that
the expression “sufficient cause” should be viewed from a pragmatic

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 4

and justice oriented approach. Similar observations have been made
in the State of Nagaland Versus Lipok Ao reported in (2005) 3
SCC 752 and it has been opined that the term “sufficient cause”,
should, therefore, be considered with pragmatism in a justice
oriented approach rather than technical detection of sufficient cause
for every day's delay.
3.

DDA has explained the delay, inter alia, stating that after the
th

judgment dated 17 December, 2002 was passed, the same was
made subject matter of

rectification/modification of certain

typographical errors on an application filed by the respondent. The
application was disposed of on 28

th

February, 2003 with certain

th

corrections in the judgment dated 17 December, 2002. It is further
explained that due to mistake/error in the office of counsel of the
th

DDA, certified copy of the Order dated 28 February, 2003 was not
applied for. When the default came to notice of the counsel for DDA
th

after verification of records, on 30 May, 2003 certified copy of the
th

th

Order dated 28 February, 2003 was applied for and received on 9

June, 2003. The certified copy was sent to the office of DDA by the

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 5
th

counsel along with his written opinion/notes on 9 July, 2003. It is
further stated in the application that the matter had to be examined
by Chief Vigilance Officer in DDA whose views/notes were received
th

on 11 August, 2003 and thereafter it was decided that an intra court
th

appeal should be filed. By order dated 14 August, 2003, the file was
entrusted to the counsel for drafting of an appeal. Correspondence
were exchanged between the counsel and DDA and upon receiving
the relevant papers, the counsel drafted the grounds of appeal and
st

the appeal was filed on 1 September, 2003. It may be stated here
that DDA has also filed an affidavit of the counsel who was handling
the matter before the learned Single Judge. Counsel has admitted
that the contents of the application for condonation of delay are
correct. Thus admitting default of his office in applying for the certified
copy.
4.

DDA is a statutory authority and has to naturally rely upon

their counsels who conduct cases for supply of certified copies and
legal opinion before deciding whether or not to file an appeal. In the
present case, as stated above the counsel for DDA has admitted that

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 6

there was default and mistake by his office in sending the certified
th

copy of the Order dated 28 February, 2003 to DDA. The counsel
has also filed his affidavit admitting mistake of his office. We do not
think that DDA should be made to suffer because of this mistake
made by its counsel. Parties do rely upon their counsel for certified
copies. In these circumstances, we feel that DDA should not be
penalised and punished for the default made by the office of their
counsel. In our system where Government and private citizens rely
heavily upon counsel, mistakes made by office of the counsel can
result in delay. We are satisfied that in the present case DDA cannot
be blamed for the delay till certified copy of the Order dated 28

th

February, 2003 was served and received in its office in July, 2003.
DDA has been able to show sufficient cause for this period.
5.

Even thereafter delay stands explained as the file had to be

examined by the Chief Vigilance Officer, DDA and steps had to be
taken to file an appeal by drafting grounds and also preparing paper
book. In these circumstances, we allow the application and codone
the delay in filing the Appeal.

rd

In terms of the order dated 3 November, 2003 passed by

the Supreme Court and with the consent of the parties we had heard
the learned counsel for the parties on merits. It was made clear that
in case we allow the application for condonation of delay, we shall
also deliver and pronounce judgment on the present Appeals on
merits.
Background facts
2.

The Respondent- Mr. R.S. Jindal was an employee of the

appellant- DDA. On 23

rd

December,1985, the appellant passed an

order for compulsorily retirement of the respondent.
168/1986,

WP(C) NO.

filed by the respondent challenging the order of

compulsory retirement was allowed by a Division Bench of this Court
th

vide Judgment dated 15 December, 1986, inter alia, holding that
there was no justification as the service record of the respondent did
not contain any entry to prove that he was a person of doubtful
integrity. Direction was given that the respondent would be treated in

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 8

service with continuity of service and consequential benefits.
3.

DDA filed a Special Leave Petition before the Supreme

Court, which was admitted. On the interim application, the Supreme
th

Court in its Order dated 25 March, 1987, directed as under:“There will be a stay on the condition that the
respondent is paid is full salary and
allowances pending disposal of appeal.”
4.

The effect of the aforesaid direction was that the operation
th

of the judgment dated 15 December, 1986 quashing the Order of
rd

compulsory retirement dated 23 December, 1985 was stayed but
the respondent was to be paid full salary and allowances as if he was
in service during the pendency of the appeal before the Supreme
Court.
5.

On the representations of the respondent

and without

prejudice to the rights and contentions of the appellant-DDA in the
st

appeal pending before the Supreme Court by order dated 21 June,
1989, the respondent was posted and worked with DDA till he
st

superannuated on 31 December,1993. It is an admitted case that
the respondent has been paid full salary and allowances for the

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

period after 23

rd

Page 9

December, 1985 till he superannuated on 31

st

December,1993.
6.

The appeal was disposed of by the Supreme Court by Order
th

dated 8 September, 1994. The Order dated 8

th

September, 1994

passed by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 793/1987 is the
crux and the corner stone of the dispute between the parties. For the
sake of convenience the Order is reproduced below:“After
addressing
the
arguments
for
considerable time, Shri Salve, the learned
senior counsel for the respondent seeks
permission of the Court to withdrew the civil
Writ Petition No. 168/86 in the light of the
decision laid by this Court in Balkunthunath
Das & Anr. Vs. Chief District Medical Officer,
Baripada & Anr. (1992 (2) SCC 299) with
liberty to approach the DDA to pass an
appropriate order on his entitlement to the
pension and requests to protect the salary he
had received during the period he worked after
reinstatement pursuant to the Judgment of the
Delhi High Court till he retired on attaining the
age of superannuation. We find that the
permission sought for and request made are
reasonable. Accordingly, the judgment of the
High Court of Delhi, dated December 15, 1986
is set aside. The respondent is permitted to
withdraw the writ petition and it is accordingly
dismissed
as
withdrawn.
Since,
the

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 10

respondent was reinstated pursuant to the
order of the Division Bench and he continued
in service till he attained the age of
superannuation by performing the duties of his
office during that period, we direct that the
salary paid to him during that period shall not
be recovered. However, while it would be open
to the respondent to make an application to
the authorities for fixing his pension, it would
be open to the authorities to fix such pension
according to rules.
The
appeal
is
disposed
of
accordingly. No costs.”
7.

After disposal of the Appeal by the Supreme Court, DDA
th

passed an Order dated 29 August, 1995 fixing provisional pension
on the basis of service rendered by the respondent in DDA.

A

dispute about the pension component payable by the MCD was
raised but stands settled and the same is not a subject matter before
us.
th

8.

By another letter dated 15 December, 1995, DDA informed

the respondent that the Chairman/Lt. Governor of Delhi had been
pleased to order that the service rendered by the respondent, w.e.f.
23

rd

December, 1985

st

to 31 December, 1993 would be treated

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 11

and regularised as re-employment period. But the re-employment
period would not be counted for computing pension or other
th

retirement benefits. The establishment order dated 15 December,
1995 reads as under:“ESTABLISHMENT ORDER NO.4102
DATED 15.12.1995
The Chairman, Delhi Development
Authority/Lt. Governor of Delhi has been pleased
to order that service rendered by Shri Ranjit
Singh Jindal, Chief Engineer (Civil) retired w.e.f.
23.12.85 to 31.12.93 be treated and regularized
as a re-employment period. The period of reemployment will not be counted for computing
pension or any other retirement benefits.
(V.K. JAIN)
O.S.D. (PERSONNEL)
No.F.9(30)75/PB-I
9.

dated 15.12.85 (sic)”

Relying upon this re-employment order,

disciplinary

proceedings were initiated against the respondent on the basis of
Rule 9 of the CCS (Pension) Rules which, inter alia, provides that
departmental proceedings can be initiated within four years of
retirement or re-employment.

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Legal Proceedings
10.

The respondent filed a contempt application being Civil

Contempt Application No. 574/1996 before the Supreme Court but
the same was dismissed in limine. In the said Contempt Application
th

the respondent challenged Order dated 15 December, 1995.
11.

th

The Establishment order dated 15 December,1995 and the

resultant departmental proceedings were challenged in the WP(C)
No.2300/1997. The respondent also made a prayer that the entire
period of his service upto the actual date of retirement i.e. upto 31

st

December, 1993 should be counted for the purpose of computing
and paying his pension or in the alternative the respondent should be
rd

treated as retired w.e.f. 23 December, 1985 and he should be paid
pension from the said date along with interest. It was submitted that
the respondent was entitled to computation of pension w.e.f. 23

nd

December, 1985 and the said computed pension should be paid
along with interest w.e.f. the said date.
12.

DDA defended its action in passing the Order dated 15

th

December, 1995 for re-employment and its decision to initiate

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 13

departmental proceedings in terms of Rule 9 of CCS (Pension)
Rules. During the pendency of the said writ petition, vide order dated
16

th

December, 1997, DDA paid amount of Rs.4,03,699/- to the
rd

respondent on account of arrears of pension, w.e.f. 23 December,
th

1985 to 30 November, 1997.
th

Directions in the Impugned Judgement dated 17 December,
2002
13.
Accepting the contentions of the respondent, Ld. Single
th

Judge has quashed Establishment Order dated 15 December, 1995
by the impugned judgment and has directed that Rs.2,35,234/- with
9% interest

towards retirement benefits should be paid to
rd

respondent for the period 23 December,1985 till superannuation of
st

the appellant on 31 December,1993. The above figure comprises of
Dearness Relief on Pension of Rs.57,410/-, Retirement Gratuity of
Rs. 47,375/-, Computation of Pension of Rs.1,00,129/- and leave
encashment of Rs.30,320/-.
Contentions of Parties.
14.

Learned counsel for the appellant-DDA had submitted that

he has instructions not to question and challenge the impugned

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 14

judgment of the learned Single Judge to the extent charge-sheet
issued against the respondent and Establishment order dated 15

th

December, 1995 stands quashed. We need not therefore examine
this aspect. The only question and ground raised before us is with
regard to the other direction passed by the learned Single Judge
directing

payment of the above retirement benefits along with

interest @ 9% per annum.
15.

Ld. Counsel for the appellant had submitted that the
rd

respondent has been paid salary for the period 23 December,1985
st

till 31 December,1993 and he cannot be paid pension for the same
period. He had urged that directions given would amount to dual
payment of both full pension and salary for the period mentioned
above. Since salary stands paid, the direction to make the aforesaid
payments cannot be sustained.
16.

Ld. Counsel for the respondent had drawn our attention to
th

the order dated 8 September, 1994 passed by the Supreme Court
and submitted that as the order of compulsory retirement has been
upheld, therefore, the entire period between 1985 to 1993 should be

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 15

treated as a period when the respondent was working on commercial
employment with the appellant

and accordingly both pension and

salary for this period was payable. He drew our attention to several
Rules and urged that both pension and salary should be paid. He
also stated that the appellant had themselves paid Rs.4,03,699/towards salary for the period in question and pension of the same
period, except for the amounts directed to be paid by the learned
single judge.
Findings and Decision
17.

A plain reading of the Order dated 8

th

September, 1994

passed by the Supreme Court reveals that the respondent had
agreed to withdraw Writ Petition (Civil) No. 168/1986 challenging his
rd

order of compulsory retirement dated 23 December, 1985 and the
th

judgment of the High Court dated 15 December,1986 in favour of
the respondent was quashed and set aside. In terms thereof the
respondent is entitled to be paid pension and other retirement
rd

benefits and not salary after 23 December, 1985.

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

18.

Page 16
th

After the judgment dated 15 December, 1986, the Order

compulsorily retiring the respondent stood quashed, he was deemed
rd

to be in service as if he had never retired on 23 December, 1985.
The Supreme Court by an interim order dated 25

th

March, 1987

granted stay but subject to the condition that full salary and
allowances would be paid to the respondent during the pendency of
the appeal. The result was that instead of pensionary and retirement
benefits pursuant to order of compulsory retirement, the respondent
continued to get full pay and allowances.
19.

Under normal circumstances, the respondent was required

to refund the entire salary and allowances paid to him after 23

rd

st

December, 1985 till 31 December, 1993 in terms of the judgment of
th

this Court dated 15 December, 1986, which stood reversed and
was set aside. Under the Doctrine of Restitution, the entire amount
paid had to be refunded and paid back. The doctrine of restitution is
recognised under Section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908,
but the said Section is not fountain head or source of restitution,
rather it is a statutory recognition of the pre-existing rule of justice,

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 17

equity and fair play. Courts have inherent right of restitution to do
complete justice between the parties and place them in the same
position which they would have occupied but for any order or
judgment or part thereof which is modified or reversed. Further, when
an interim order gets merged into a final order, any benefit taken
under the interim order on reversal or modification by the final order,
can be directed to be refunded. Benefit taken under a wrong order
cannot be perpetuated by keeping it alive and respecting it. Injustice
done is undone and unfair gain made by a party causing loss to the
other side is set right. (See, observations of the Supreme Court in
South-eastern Coalfields Ltd versus State of M.P. and others
reported in (2003) 8 SCC 648 and Gurdit Singh versus Nirmal
Singh reported in (2000) 8 SCC 551).
20.

The Supreme Court was conscious of the fact that in view

of the interim order, the respondent had been paid full salary and
allowances pending disposal of the appeal vide order dated 8

th

rd

September, 1994, i.e. for the entire period between 23 December,
st

1985 till his superannuation on 31 December,1993. The Supreme

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 18

Court did not direct refund of this amount by the respondent to the
appellant-DDA. The reason was that the respondent, after passing of
the judgment dated 15

th

December, 1986 by this Court and the

th

interim order dated 25 March, 1987 by the Supreme Court, was
“reinstated”

and DDA continued to avail of his services till the

superannuation of the respondent. As a result, the respondent was
paid full salary and allowances. Therefore the salary paid was
protected and no order for restitution was passed.
21.

DDA has explained “reinstatement” of the respondent in its
th

additional affidavit dated 30 August, 2004.

We

have

also

examined the records and files of DDA in this regard. The respondent
had made various representations for being assigned official duties
after judgment dated 15

th

December, 1986 and the interim order

th

dated 25 March, 1987 was passed by the Supreme Court. Opinion
of a former Chief Justice of India was enclosed with the requests
pleading that the respondent may be posted and allowed work during
the pendency of the appeal without prejudice to the rights and
contentions of the appellant-DDA before the Supreme Court. The

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 19

stand taken by the respondent was that as he was being paid full
salary and allowances, it would be in the interest of the public
authority that

public funds were utilised to the best advantage and

therefore services of the respondent should be utilised. It was opined
that there was no prohibition in utilising the services of the
respondent during the pendency of the appeal inspite of the stay
Order granted by the Supreme Court. It was stated that no harm and
loss would be caused to the appellant-DDA by taking work from the
respondent. In terms of the representations made by the respondent,
st

office order dated 21 June, 1989 assigning work to the respondent
was passed with the following condition :“The assignment will not prejudice the rights
and contentions of the Delhi Development
Authroity in the appeal pending in the Hon'ble
Supreme Court.”

22.

We feel that the respondent cannot claim on the basis of the
st

order dated 21 June, 1989 that he was commercially employed by
the DDA or is entitled to be paid both salary and pension for the
period from 23

rd

st

December,1985 till 31 December,1993. It would

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 20

result in the respondent abrogating his undertaking and statement
that no loss or harm would be caused to DDA. The respondent
should not be permitted to reprobate contrary to his representations.
All along the respondent had agreed and accepted that his posting
and allotment of work by the appellant-DDA would be without
prejudice to the rights and contentions of the appellant-DDA. Letter
st

dated 21 June, 1989 specifically states that the work assigned to the
respondent was without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the
DDA. The appellant acted on the repeated requests of the
respondent. The respondent cannot claim that he was re-employed
or was commercially employed by the DDA after retirement and
therefore entitled to both pension and salary. No such request was
made and accepted by the appellant. The respondent is estopped
from taking up any such plea to the prejudice of DDA and thereby
cause loss to the DDA. In case of re-employment or commercial
employment,

considered decision on proper appreciation in that

regard had to be taken by DDA and an order had to be passed.
There is nothing on record to suggest that a conscious decision to re-

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

employ or commercially employ the respondent as

Page 21

a retired

employee was ever contemplated or taken. DDA, on the other hand,
has taken up the garden path that since it was paying full salary and
allowances, therefore it would be appropriate that work was assigned
and taken from the respondent as otherwise loss was being caused
to the public exchequer and public funds. DDA gave in to the request
of the respondent on the specific undertaking and the statements
made. The respondent now cannot turn around and claim that he
was re-employed or commercially employed by DDA, when he had
not made any such request, no such request was considered and no
re-employment or commercial employment order was passed.
23.

Estoppel is normally a rule of evidence but can have the

effect of creating substantive rights as against the person who is
estopped. It can be used as a rule of creating or defeating rights and
read as part of the substantive Rule of Law. Estoppel is also
effectively used to prevent circuitry of action and fraud. We can
appropriately refer here to the decision of the Supreme Court in B.L.
Sreedhar and others versus K.M. Munireddy (dead) & others

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 22

reported in (2003) 2 SCC 355 wherein it has been held that estoppel
is a part of substantive law and a rule of equity. Principle of
acquiescence and waiver which are sub-headings of estoppel were
also examined in detail and it was observed:“If a man either by words or by conduct has
intimated that he consents to an act which has
been done and that he will not offer any
opposition to it, although it could not have been
lawfully done without his consent, and he thereby
induces others to do that which they otherwise
might have abstained from, he cannot question
the legality of the act he had sanctioned to the
prejudice of those who have so given faith to his
words or to the fair inference to be drawn from his
conduct.”
24.

Similar view has also been taken in the case of Bank of

India and others versus O.P. Swarnakar and others reported in
(2003) 2 SCC 722 holding that a person cannot approbate and
reprobate at the same time and once a person has made a choice
between two courses of conduct available to him he cannot resile.
The subsequent conduct cannot be inconsistent with the earlier
conduct.

Once

a

person

has

accepted

benefits

from

a

transaction/contract/instrument, etc. which he could have avoided or

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 23

contested, he is estopped from questioning, challenging and denying
validity and binding effect of the said contract/act. A person cannot
be permitted to resile from what he has stated and on the basis of
which the other side had acted.
25.

The respondent himself requested that he should be

assigned some work without prejudice to the rights and contentions
of the appellant-DDA in the appeal before the Supreme Court. The
respondent, therefore, was not entitled to be paid full salary and
allowances for this period. However, the Supreme Court conscious of
the fact that the respondent had worked till he attained the age of
superannuation directed that the salary paid to the respondent shall
not be recovered. This Order was probably passed by the Supreme
Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India as any direction
for refund of full salary and allowances would have caused difficulty
and hardship to the respondent.
26.

th

The Supreme Court in its Order dated 8 September, 1994

did not pass an order of restitution and did not direct that any amount
should be refunded/restituted. However, this cannot imply and mean

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 24

that the respondent is to be paid both salary and allowances for this
period as well as pensionary benefits. The directions of the Supreme
rd

Court were clear that for this period, i.e. after 23 December, 1985 till
st

31 December, 1993, the respondent can retain pay and allowances
paid to him, though otherwise for this period he was entitled to only
pensionary benefits. This certainly does not mean that the
respondent should be paid both salary and allowances as well as
pensionary benefits or dual benefit, inspite of having lost the writ.
The respondent cannot take advantage of his own request to
withdraw the Writ Petition (Civil) No. 168/86 pursuant to which
th

judgment dated 15 December, 1986 was set aside and the order of
compulsory retirement was upheld.
27.

The maxim, actus curiae neminem gravabit (act of the

court cannot cause any prejudice and loss to the party) is also
applicable to the facts of the present case. The said doctrine is
applicable not only to acts of the courts which are erroneous but also
applicable to all such acts of the court which the court would not
have directed after it had been apprised of the correct facts and the

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 25

law. The respondent was paid full salary and allowances as per judgment
th

th

dated 15 December, 1986 and the interim order dated 25 March,
th

1987. Later on as recorded in the Order dated 8 September, 1994
the respondent withdrew Writ Petition No.168/1986 and accepted the
compulsory retirement order dated 23

rd

December, 1985. DDA
th

cannot be prejudiced by the judgment dated 15 December, 1986
th

and the interim order dated 25 March, 1987.
28.

Ld. Counsel for the respondent referred to Pension Rules

and CCS (Computation of Pension) Rules, 1981. We do not think any
of the said Rules and the provisions relating to re-employment of
pensioners or commercial employment are applicable in the facts and
circumstances of the present case. In our opinion, the order dated
st

21 June,1989 posting the respondent cannot be regarded as an
order of re-employment or commercial employment of the respondent
after his retirement. Therefore, the relevant provisions of the Pension
Rules and CCS (Computation of Pension) Rules, 1981 relied upon by
the respondent do not apply to the facts of the present case and
neither can the present case be regarded as commercial employment

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 26

of the respondent by the appellant-DDA after his retirement.
29.

We may, however, note one disturbing feature. DDA has

infact paid Rs.4,03,699/- to the respondent towards arrears of
rd

th

pension for the period after 23 December, 1985 to 30 November,
1997. This payment was made in spite of the fact that the respondent
had already been paid salary for this period. We fail to understand
how and why this payment was made. Even if the respondent was
treated as re-employed vide order dated 15

th

December, 1995,

fixation of salary ought to be done in terms of Rule 4 of the Central
Civil Services (Fixation of Pay and Re-employed Pensioners) Order,
1995. The relevant portions of the said Rule are quoted below :-

“4. Fixation
pensioners.-

of

pay

of

re-employed

(a) Re-employed pensioners shall be allowed
to draw pay only in the prescribed scales of
pay for the posts in which they are reemployed. No protection of the scales of pay of
the posts held by them prior to retirement shall
be given.
(b)
(i) In all cases where the pension is
fully ignored, the initial pay on re-employment

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 27

shall be fixed at the minimum of the scale of
pay of the re-employed post.
(ii)
In cases where the entire pension
is not ignored for pay fixation, the initial pay on
re-employment shall be fixed at the same
stage as the last pay drawn before retirement.
If there is no such stage in the re-employed
post, the pay shall be fixed at the stage below
that pay. If the maximum of the pay scale in
which a pensioner is re-employed is less than
the last pay drawn by him before retirement,
his initial pay shall be fixed at the maximum of
the scale of pay of the re-employed post.
Similarly, if the minimum of the scale of pay in
which a pensioner is re-employed is more than
the last pay drawn by him before retirement his
initial pay shall be fixed at the minimum of the
scale of pay of the re-employed post. However,
in all these cases, the non-ignorable part of the
pension shall be reduced from the pay so fixed.
(emphasis supplied)
NOTE .- In fixing the initial pay of re-employed
pensioners, the pension equivalent of gratuity
may not be deducted from the pay so fixed.
(c)
The re-employed pensioner will in
addition to pay as fixed under para.(b) above,
shall be permitted to draw separately any
pension sanctioned to him and to retain any
other form of retirement benefits.
(d)

In the case of persons retiring before

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 28

attaining the age of 55 years and who are reemployed,
pension
(including
pension
equivalent of gratuity and other forms of
retirement benefits) shall be ignored for initial
pay fixation to the following extent:(i)
in the case of ex-servicemen who
held posts below commissioned officer rank in
the Defence Forces and in the case of civilians
who held posts below Group 'A' posts at the
time of their retirement, the entire pension and
pension equivalent of retirement benefits shall
be ignored.
(ii)
in the case of service officers
belonging to the Defence Forces and civilian
pensioners who held Group 'A' posts at the
time of their retirement, the first Rs.500 of the
pension and pension equivalent of retirement
benefits shall be ignored.”
30.

Rule 4(a) states that no protection of scale of pay prior to

retirement shall be available to a re-employed pensioner. Rule 4(d)
stipulates that in case of persons retiring before attaining the age of
55 years, as in the present case, on re-employment, pension to the
extent stipulated therein will be ignored for initial pay fixation. Under
Sub-Clause (ii) to Rule 4(d), which is applicable to Civil servants
holding Group A posts, first Rs.500/- of pension and pension

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 29

equivalent to retirement benefits is to be ignored but rest of the
pension has to be taken into consideration and deducted while fixing
pay on re-employment. In such cases, where entire pension is not
ignored, under Rule 4(b)(ii) the pay scale on re-employment of the
respondent was required to be fixed at the same stage as the last
drawn pay before retirement but non ignorable part of pension had to
be reduced from the pay so fixed. The said clause is applicable.
Therefore, the entire pension or pensionary benefits could not have
been ignored in the case of respondent in terms of Rules 4(d)(ii) and
Rule 4(b)(ii), which mandate that in all such cases like that of the
respondent, the non-ignorable part of pension i.e. except for
Rs.500/-, shall be reduced from the pay so fixed. Thus the pay fixed
on re-employment is to be reduced by the non-ignorable part of the
pension. The respondent, therefore, would not have got pension and
salary at the same time for this period, except the first Rs.500/- of the
pension and the pensionary benefits. It is unfortunate that DDA
ignored the aforesaid Rules while making the payment of
Rs.4,03,699/.

It is clear to us that in case services of the respondent
rd

st

during the period 23 December, 1985 till 31 December, 1993 are
treated as re-employment period, the respondent would be entitled to
receive salary for this period minus the pension payable to him, with
first Rs.500/- of the pension/retirement benefits not being reduced
from the computation and accordingly, under the Rules, the
respondent will not be entitled to dearness relief on pension,
retirement gratuity, leave encashment and computation of pension
for this period. This is also clear from the Rules i.e. Pension Rule 50
and 55A(i), CCS Commutation of Pension Rules and CCS Leave
Rules.
32.

Learned Single Judge by the impugned judgment relying

upon the Order passed by the Supreme Court has quashed and set
aside the letter/establishment order dated 15

th

December, 1995

rd

st

treating the period between 23 December, 1985 till 31 December,
1993 as re-employment period. The said period, therefore, cannot be
treated as re-employment period and accordingly the said Rules
th

cannot be made applicable. Once order dated 15 December, 1995

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 31

is quashed as was prayed for and decided by the Ld. Single judge,
the respondent cannot claim that he was re-employed by the DDA.
33.

The case of the respondent, on the other hand, is that the

appellant-DDA did not re-employ him and he was taken on
commercial employment by the DDA as a Consultant on contract
rd

basis. It is stated that this period from 23 December, 1985 to 31

st

December, 1993 should be treated as commercial employment on
contract basis between the respondent and the DDA. In this regard,
the appellant has relied upon Rule 10 of the CCS (Pension) Rules
which deals with commercial employment. Under Sub-rule 8, the
term “commercial employment” has been defined as under:-

(8) In this rule, (a)
the expression “commercial
employment” means(i)
an employment in any capacity
including that of an agent, under a company,
co-operative society, firm or individual engaged
in trading, commercial, industrial, financial or
professional business and includes also a
directorship of such company and partnership
of such firm, but does not include employment

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 32

under a body corporate, wholly or substantially
owned or controlled by the Central Government
or a State Government.”
34.

A cursory glance in the said Rule would indicate that the

term “commercial employment” means employment in a private
sector company, cooperative society, firm or an individual, or selfemployment in some cases but does not include employment under
a corporate body wholly owned or substantially owned or controlled
by the Central Government or the State Government. DDA is wholly
controlled by the Central Government. The respondent cannot claim
that he was in commercial employment on contract basis with the
appellant. Rule 10 of the CCS (Pension) Rules was incorporated to
prevent pensioners from taking up jobs within two years from the
date of their retirement in private sector. The said Rules and the
provisions have no application whatsoever to the present case.
35.

In view of the above, we allow the present Appeal and set
th

aside the judgment dated 17 December, 2002. It is held that for the
rd

st

period 23 December, 1985 till 31 December, 1993, the respondent
will not be entitled to any pension/retirement benefits as during this

LPA Nos. 702-03/2003

Page 33

period he has been paid full pay and allowances. For the period
st

w.e.f. 1 January, 1994, the respondent will be entitled to pension
and retirement benefits. It is apparent that DDA has already paid the
th

said amount in terms of the order dated 8 September, 1994 passed
by the Supreme Court and as per time fixed in the Order dated 4

th

August, 1995. The Appeal is accordingly allowed but in the facts and
circumstances of the case there will be no order as to costs.
36.

All pending applications are also disposed of.
