JUDGMENT
MANMOHAN, J:

1.

The petitioners have filed the present writ petition under Article 226 of the

Constitution of India praying for issuance of a writ of certiorari and/or any other appropriate

WP(C) 1568 of 2007

page 1 of 7

writ, order or direction for quashing the judgment and order dated 17th August, 2006 passed
by the Central Administrative Tribunal (for short “the Tribunal”) in O.A. No. 2709/2005.

2.

The Tribunal in its judgment has held that there was delay in initiating the process of

holding Departmental Promotion Committee (for short “DPC”); which delay was solely
attributable to the Petitioners herein for which Respondent No.1 cannot be made to suffer.
The Tribunal has further directed the Petitioners herein to re-examine the claim of
Respondent No.1 in the light of O.M. No. 22011/9/98 (for short “the said OM”) issued by
the Department of Personnel and Training and its observations for ante dating the promotion
of Respondent No.1 on notional basis in the post of JS&LA of ILS from the date the process,
as envisaged and instructions as per the model calendar, should have been completed.

3.

The learned ASG, Mr. Gopal Subramanium, appearing for the Petitioners contended

that the said OM did not apply as the Respondent No.1 was promoted against an
unanticipated vacancy for the year 2004-2005. He further contended that the said OM
placed a duty on the Petitioners to convene DPC in advance so as to utilize the prepared
panel as and when the vacancies arise during the course of the vacancy year. Learned ASG
also submitted that the Hon’ble Supreme court’s judgment in Union of India vs. N.R.
Banerjee and others, reported in (1997) 9 SCC 287 relied upon by the Tribunal, clearly
stipulated that filling up of posts in advance are only for clear or anticipated vacancies
arising in the year.

4.

Mr. Sarup Singh, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Respondent No.1, while

placing strong reliance on the said OM, urged that the process for filling up of anticipated

WP(C) 1568 of 2007

page 2 of 7

vacancies (specially on Mr. B.L. Nishad’s impending superannuation)

should have

commenced in July, 2003 for the recruitment year 2004-2005. He further contended that had
this procedure been scrupulously adhered to, Respondent No.1 would not have suffered.
According to him, compliance with Rules and promotions coming in routine in the Legal
Affairs Department has resulted in Respondent No.1 and others suffering on this account for
the future promotional posts of Additional Secretary. Mr. Sarup Singh also referred to and
relied upon counter affidavit filed by UPSC to show that his interpretation of the said OM
was in consonance with the UPSC’s interpretation.

5.

As the dispute primarily revolves upon interpretation of the said OM, we consider it

appropriate to reproduce hereinbelow the relevant portion of the same :

“3.1 Keeping the aforesaid objective in view, it has been considered
imperative to provide for a time-schedule for convening DPCs not
only in time but in sufficient advance so as to utilize the prepared
panel as and when the vacancies arise during the course of the
vacancy year. For practical reasons, it is also considered desirable to
have separate time-schedules for cases requiring approval of the
Appointments Committee of the Cabinet and cases which do not
require such approval. Accordingly, in order to complete all required
action, including the approval of the Competent Authority well in
time (before the commencement of the panel or vacancy year), the
administrative action for convening DPCs, in the cases requiring
approval of the ACC (ACC cases), could, as such, be initiated at least
eight and a half months before the commencement of the vacancy
year and, similarly, DPCs in such cases could be held at least four
months before the commencement of the vacancy year. This means
that there would be a clear period of the first three and half months of
the year immediately preceding the vacancy/panel year available for
completion of the ACRs etc, followed by another four and a half
months’ time for holding of DPCs. The next one month could be
devoted to the post-DPC follow-up administrative action by the
Administrative Ministry/Department. The final three months’ period
prior to the commencement of the vacancy year could be left for
approval of the Competent Authority (ACC).

WP(C) 1568 of 2007

6.

According to us, the said OM obliges the Petitioners to prepare an advance panel of

officers only for anticipated or notified vacancies. The Petitioners cannot be asked to
convene a DPC and prepare in advance a panel of officers for vacancies which are not likely
to arise.

7.

Consequently, the issues that now arise for consideration are – firstly as to whether

the Respondent No.1 has been appointed against an unanticipated or anticipated vacancy
and secondly even if the said OM were to apply, is the Petitioners’ conduct of such a nature
as to warrant a finding and/or direction as the Tribunal has given in its impugned judgment.

8.

For finding an answer to these issues, we would have to examine the facts of the

present case. Briefly stated the material facts of the present case are that the Ministry of
Law and Justice has two Departments, namely, Department of Legal Affairs and Department
of Legislative Affairs. On 16th April, 1996, the Respondent No.1 joined as Deputy Legal
Adviser in Grade-III of Indian Legal Service in the Department of Legal Affairs on DR
basis. On 11th December, 1998, the Respondent No.1 was promoted as Additional Legal
Adviser in Grade-IV of the Indian Legal Service in the Department of Legal Affairs. On 5th
July, 2001, the Respondent No.1 joined as Joint Secretary and Legislative Counsel in the
Legislative Department on deputation basis for a period of three years.

9.

On 6th September, 2004, the Respondent No.1 joined back his regular cadre post of

Additional Legal Adviser in the Department of Legal Affairs on repatriation from the
deputation post of Joint Secretary and Legislative Counsel in the Legislative Department
consequent on expiry of his deputation term there on 4th July, 2004 and after availing earned
WP(C) 1568 of 2007

page 4 of 7

leave from 5th July, 2004 to 3rd September, 2004. On 16th August, 2004, one unanticipated
vacancy occurred in the grade of Joint Secretary and Legal Adviser (JS & LA) consequent
on the unexpected appointment of Shri A. Sinha, JS&LA as Principal Adviser (Legal) in
TRAI on deputation basis. Approval of the Minister of Law and Justice was sought to fill up
two vacancies in the grade of JS&LA. These two vacancies included one unanticipated
vacancy which fell vacant with effect from 16th August, 2004 and the one anticipated
vacancy which was due to become available with effect from 1st February, 2005 consequent
on the superannuation of Shri B.L. Nishad, JS&LA.

10.

On 25th November, 2004, on the directions of Ministry of Finance, an order was

issued for abolition of one post of JS&LA with effect from 1st January, 2005 which was
encadered in Ministry of Commerce. Shri YPC Dangay who was a regular JS&LA in the
Department of Legal Affairs was incumbent to the said encadered post of JS&LA in the
Ministry of Commerce. Consequently, on 7th December, 2004, approval of the Minister of
Law & Justice was again obtained to fill up one anticipated vacancy of JS&LA which was
expected to arise on 1st February, 2005 consequent on the superannuation of Shri B.L.
Nishad, JS&LA. On 13th January, 2005 the said proposal for filling up one post of JS&LA
was sent to UPSC.

11.

However, on 28th February, 2005, one unanticipated vacancy occurred consequent

on the appointment of Shri R.N. Poddar, then JS&LA, as Member of the Appellate Tribunal
of Foreign Exchange. Consequently, the proposal sent earlier on 13th January, 2005 was
revised and on 31st March, 2005 a fresh proposal for filling up four vacancies was sent to
UPSC which included one anticipated vacancy vide Shri B.L. Nishad, already reported to
UPSC, one unanticipated vacancy of Shri R.N. Poddar on 28th February, 2005 and two
WP(C) 1568 of 2007

page 5 of 7

anticipated

vacancies pertaining to the vacancy years 2005-2006 which were due to arise

with effect from 1st December, 2005 consequent upon the superannuation of Shri M.L.
Ganvir and Shri A.P. Aggarwal, both JS&LAs.

12.

On 31st May, 2005, the Respondent No.2 herein, namely, UPSC, asked for deficient

Confidential Records (CRs) of some of the officers who were in the zone of consideration.
The CRs of all the officers were finally complete by 3rd October, 2005 and the same were
sent to UPSC on 4th October, 2005.

13.

On 30th November, 2005, the Respondent No.1 herein preferred an OA being O.A.

No. 2709/2005 praying the Tribunal to direct the Petitioners herein to conduct DPC without
any delay and consider Respondent No.1 for promotion to the post of JS&LA. While the
said OA was pending, the UPSC convened the DPC and the recommendations of the said
DPC were received by the Petitioners on 19th December, 2005. The Minister of Law and
Justice accepted the recommendations of the UPSC on 21st December, 2005. Within a
week’s time, the proposal for accepting recommendations of the UPSC were sent to ACC
which granted its approval on 2nd March, 2006. On 3rd March, 2006, four officers viz Shri
B.S. Meena, joined as JS&LA against the anticipated vacancy of 2004-2005, Respondent
No.1 joined as JS&LA against the unanticipated vacancy of 2004-2005; Shri M.A. Khan
Yusufi and Shri S.S. Chahar both joined JS&LA against the anticipated vacancies of 20052006.

14.

Thus, from the above narrated facts it would be apparent that Respondent No.1 has

been granted promotion against an unanticipated vacancy of

WP(C) 1568 of 2007

Mr.

R.N. Poddar.

page 6 of 7

Consequently, no prior action could have been initiated by the Petitioners for filling up of
this unanticipated vacancy. Delay, if any, in filling up the vacancy of Mr. B.L. Nishad could
be of no assistance to the Respondent No.1. Moreover, we are of the view that there is no
wanton infraction of the said OM by the Petitioners to afford any relief to Respondent No.1.
Therefore, we set aside the findings of the Tribunal that the Petitioners delayed the initiation
of the process of Respondent No.1’s DPC.

15.

Before we part, we may also refer to the judgment of N.R. Banerjee (supra) on which

both the Tribunal and the Respondent No.1’s counsel had placed strong reliance. According
to us, a reading of the said judgment in its entirety, it is apparent that the Hon’ble Supreme
Court has also held that the preparation of a panel in advance has only to be to the extent of
notified, anticipated or certain vacancies.

Since Respondent No.1 has been granted

promotion against an unanticipated vacancy on 20th April, 2005, the Tribunal’s reliance on
the above referred Supreme Court’s judgment is misconceived on facts and untenable in law.
Consequently, the impugned judgment and order dated 17th August, 2006 passed by the
Tribunal in O.A. No. 27089/2005 are hereby quashed and set aside. The writ petition is
allowed. Parties are left to bear their own costs.
