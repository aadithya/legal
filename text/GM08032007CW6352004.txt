GITA MITTAL, J (Oral)
This application has been filed by the respondent praying for
condonation of delay in filing CM No.415/2006. It is pointed out
that pursuant to the judgment dated 16th August, 2005 passed by
this court, the petitioner was required to be medically examined
for the purposes of implementation of the orders of this court.
Upon the medical examination being conducted, it was opined by
the medical experts of the DTC that the petitioner was not fit to
discharge his duties with the Corporation and consequently CM
No.415/200 was necessitated.

Having regard to the facts and
Page No.1

circumstances brought on record by the DTC, I am of the view that
this application deserves to be allowed.
Consequently, delay in filing CM No.415/2006 is hereby
condoned.
CM No.415/2006
1.
This application has been filed by the DTC praying for
modification/clarification of the order dated 16th August, 2005
passed by this court. By the order dated 16th August, 2005,
placing reliance on the pronouncements of the Apex Court in
2002 1 AD 269 entitled Jaipur Zila Sahkari Bhumi Vikas
Bank Limited Vs. R.G. Verma & Ors. and 2001 LLR 539
entitled M.D. Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation
Vs. Neethivilangan, the writ petition filed by the petitioner was
allowed and the DTC was directed to reinstate the petitioner in
service with all consequential benefits.
2.

The services of the petitioner had been terminated by the

DTC on 31st October, 1991. Inasmuch as an industrial dispute was
pending between the parties on that date, the DTC had filed an
application under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 seeking approval of its action by the industrial adjudication.
This petition was rejected by the industrial adjudicator by an order

CM 417/2006 in WP(C) No.635/2004

Page No.2

dated 9th May, 1996.
3.

As the petitioner was not taken back into service despite this

order, the writ petitioner filed the writ petition seeking
reinstatement

into

service.

Placing

reliance

on

the

pronouncements of the Apex Court in Jaipur Zila Sahkari
Bhumi Vikas Bank Limited (Supra) and M.D. Tamil
Nadu State Transport Corporation (Supra), by the order
dated 16th August, 2005, the writ petition was allowed and the
DTC was directed to re-instate the petitioner into service with all
consequential benefits treating him as if he was continued in his
service from the date of his illegal removal till the date of his
reinstatement.
4.

The DTC has submitted that inasmuch as the petitioner was

over 55 years of age at the time of passing of the order dated 16th
August, 2005, in order to reinstate him in service, he was required
to undergo a medical check up to ascertain as to whether he
suffered from any disability as per the Regulation 99 of 1963. The
petitioner was consequently medially examined by the medical
board of the DTC which had given a report dated 5th December,
2005 pointing out that the petitioner suffered from two
disqualifications, one on account of imputation of a finger in his
CM 417/2006 in WP(C) No.635/2004

Page No.3

right hand and second on account of problems in his vision.
This application has been filed by the DTC urging that in
view of the report given by its medical experts, it was not possible
to reinstate the petitioner into service.

Consequently, a

modification in the order passed by this court on 16th August, 2005
is prayed.
5.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has vehemently contested

this application placing reliance on certain reports given by the
other hospitals including the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and
the All India Institute of Medial Sciences to urge that the
petitioner does not suffer from any disability which would
disqualify him from continuing in service.
6.

I have given my considered thought to the rival contentions.

There is no dispute that the Regulations of the DTC required the
petitioner, who was a driver, to be medically examined by the
medical board of the DTC. Undoubtedly, this medical board would
consist of experts who would be best placed to give an appropriate
opinion with regard to a medical disability which may be suffered
by a candidate seeking to render service with the DTC. It is this
medical board which would be the expert for giving the opinion
bearing in view the requirements of the service which an employee
CM 417/2006 in WP(C) No.635/2004

Page No.4

of the DTC is required to render and the special needs which the
service may demand.

Undoubtedly, the opinion given by the

medical board would bind this court over and above the medical
opinion given by any other experts who may be otherwise
competent to opine on fitness of a person.
7.

In this view of the matter, in my view, the opinion given by

the medical board of the DTC would bind this court. Such medical
board having held that the petitioner was not fit to be taken back
into service with the DTC, the order dated 16th August, 2005 would
require to be modified.
9.

There is yet another circumstance which would guide this

court in passing this order today. I had called for the record of the
DTC relating to the medical examination of the petitioner at the
time he joined his service inasmuch as neither party was in a
position to give a date on which the petitioner suffered the
amputation. The DTC has produced copies of the medical reports
of the petitioner of the years 1971 and 1975. These records do not
reflect that the petitioner had suffered an amputation of any part
of his body at the time when he had undergone these medical
examinations. Both these medical records show that there was no
problem with the vision of the petitioner as well.

For all these reasons, this application has to be allowed to
the extent it seeks modification of the directions made on 16th
August, 2005 directing reinstatement of the petitioner.
Inasmuch as the petitioner has been medically examined and
was found unfit for reinstatement, it has to be directed that the
petitioner may not be reinstated into service.

However, by the

order dated 9th May, 1996 DTC's application under Section
33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 was dismissed. DTC
failed to effectuate the reinstatement of the petitioner in service.
The petitioner would not have superannuated even till date if he
had been taken back into service. It is only on 5th December, 2005
that he has been declared medically unfit to perform duties.
Therefore, it has to be held that the petitioner shall be entitled to
all financial and consequential benefits as if the order of
termination had not intervened and the petitioner had rendered
continuous service with the DTC till 5th December, 2005.
Therefore, it is made clear that the petitioner shall be
entitled to all financial benefits in terms of the order dated 16th
August, 2005 passed by this court till 5th December, 2005. The
DTC shall not be required to reinstate the petitioner into service.
The arrears payable to the petitioner shall be computed
CM 417/2006 in WP(C) No.635/2004

Page No.6

within three weeks from today and shall be paid to the petitioner
within six weeks.
This application is allowed in the above terms.
Copy of this order be given dasti to counsel for the parties.
