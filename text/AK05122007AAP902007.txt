ANIL KUMAR, J.(Oral)
1.

This is a petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act, 1996 for the appointment of an arbitrator in terms of
arbitration agreement between the parties as disputes have arisen
between them.

2.

The notice of the petition was issued to the respondent,

however, nobody has appeared on behalf of the respondent nor any
reply has been filed consequently the respondent is proceeded exparte.

The petitioner is a company incorporated under the Companies

Act, 1956 and is engaged in the business of civil construction works
and providing equipments for execution of civil work on hire basis.
The present petition has been filed by Mr. Rajesh Bagga, Director of
the petitioner company, who has been authorized by a company
resolution dated 1st March, 2007 to institute the petition.

4.

The respondent is also a company incorporated under the

Companies Act, 1956 and is engaged in the business of civil works.
The petitioner contended that an agreement dated 15th December,
2004 was entered into by the petitioner and the respondent for the
carrying

out

civil

work

of

excavation

in

respect

of

KolDam

Hydroelectric Power Project, Package 1 in Himachal Pradesh which
work order was given by the respondent to the petitioner and that
scope of work entrusted on the petitioner was contained in clause 6 of
the work order/award dated 15th December, 2004.

Thereafter

disputes in respect to payment of dues to the petitioner arose and a
request was made by the petitioner to the respondent to settle the
dues by its letter dated 6th May, 2005, however the same was not
replied and the dues of the petitioner were not cleared.

5.

In the facts and circumstances, the petitioner was constrained

AA No.90/2007

Page 2 of 6

to invoke the arbitration clause contained in clause 13 of the work
order dated 15th December, 2004 and issued a notice dated 25th
January, 2007 to the respondent demanding appointment of an
arbitrator in terms of arbitration clause to adjudicate the disputes
between the parties. The respondent in their reply dated 7th February,
2007, instead of appointing an arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes,
raised a counter claim of Rs.12,62,712/- allegedly claiming it to be
due and recoverable from the petitioner. The petitioner has also
detailed a claim of Rs.21,81,458.88/- in para 14 of the petition which
is due to the petitioner from the respondent under different heads
including cost, expenses and damages.

6.

Consequently disputes have arisen between the parties. There is

an arbitration agreement between the parties for adjudication of the
disputes by an arbitrator in terms of clause 13 of the work order
dated 15th December, 2004. Clause 13 of the work order containing
the arbitration agreement is as under:“13. Any dispute with regard to performance, shall be
mutually settled by an authorized Director of both the
parties, within four weeks. Unsettled disputes will be
settled at per Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 and its amendments. The disputes will be the
subject to the jurisdiction of the Delhi courts.”

7.

The petitioner has, therefore, filed the present petition. Despite

AA No.90/2007

Page 3 of 6

service of the notice, no one has appeared on behalf of respondent nor
has any reply been filed and in any case the respondents have failed
to appoint an the arbitrator within 30 days from the receipt of the
legal notice dated 25th January, 2007 invoking the arbitration
agreement and even before filing the present petition. In the
circumstances, the plea of the petitioner that there is an arbitration
agreement in terms of clause 13 cannot be refuted. Therefore, it will
be just and appropriate to appoint an arbitrator to adjudicate
disputes between the parties.

8.

A learned Single Judge in Haryana Telecom Ltd. v. Union of

India & Anr., 112 (2004) DLT 339=2004 (3) RAJ 147, had held that if
the respondent fails to appoint an Arbitrator within the stipulated
time of 30 days of the notice, and before filing of the petition under
Section 11 of the Act, it is for the Court to appoint an Arbitrator. A
Division Bench of this Court in Delkon (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. G.M.,
Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., 120 (2005) DLT 542 (DB), relying on
Datar Switchgears Ltd Vs Tata Finance Ltd has held in para 4 is as
under:
“4. We have given our careful consideration to the
arguments advanced by learned Counsel for both the
parties. In view of the law laid down in the case of Datar
Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance Ltd. & Anr., IV (2000)
CLT 191 (SC)=VII (2000) SLT 543=JT 2000 (Suppl. 2) SC
226 it is no more res integra that the vacancy can be
supplied by a party pursuant to the arbitration agreement
even after thirty days of the receipt of the notice. However,
AA No.90/2007

Page 4 of 6

once a party approaches the Court and files a petition for
appointment by the designated authority of the Chief
Justice of that Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, the right to supply vacancy by the
opposite party is extinguished. If that right stood
extinguished on filing of the petition under Section 11(6)
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, in September
1998 the appointment of an Arbitrator on 3rd May, 1999
could not be made, therefore in our view, the order
passed by the learned Single Judge on 7th May, 1999
suffers from patent illegality. Therefore, the submission of
the respondent that the petitioner had appeared before
the Arbitrator and the application of the petitioner raising
preliminary objections is pending adjudication which
inter alia challenges the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to
decide the dispute is of no consequence as from the order
reproduced above it was pursuant to the directions
passed by the learned Single Judge that the parties were
directed to appear before the Arbitrator. The petitioner
had no other option but to appear before the Arbitrator
and after appearing before the Arbitrator the petitioner
has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator,
rather has at first opportunity taken the objection that
the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to proceed with the
matter.

9.

In Union of India v. M/s. R.R. Industries, 120 (2005) DLT 572

(DB) also it was held that once a party does not supply the vacancy or
fails to supply the vacancy before filing of a petition under Section
11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, such a party forfeits the
right to supply the vacancy in terms of the arbitration clause and
what remains is only the arbitration clause, i.e. the dispute has to be
resolved under the mechanism of alternative dispute redressal
scheme but no right survives to the respondent to supply the named
Arbitrator, if any, in the arbitration clause. Thus the arbitrator was to

Page 5 of 6

be appointed before the filing of the petition and since no arbitrator
has been appointed by the respondent consequently, the respondent
has lost its right to appoint the arbitrator in terms of clause 13 of the
arbitration agreement.

10.

the

facts

and

circumstances,

I

appoint

Sh.B.L.Garg (Retd.) Additional District Judge, Delhi, r/o.A/9, Ganpati
Apartments, 6 Alipur Road, Civil Lines, Delhi (Mobile No.9810827815)

a maximum of Rs.1 lakh payable by the petitioner in the first
instance. The parties shall appear before the learned arbitrator on

learned arbitrator forthwith. The parties shall also produce a copy of
this order before the arbitrator on the said date. Copies of this order
