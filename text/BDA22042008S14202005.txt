1.

The plaintiff had instituted the present suit for permanent

injunction, infringement of trademark, damages etc. against the defendants.
The plaintiff claims to be engaged in the field of printed matter, paper
articles, newspapers, periodicals, comic magazines, cartoon strips, story
books, films etc.

The plaintiff claims to be the proprietor of the Archie

Comic Publications as well as the 'ARCHIE' Trademark and its variations
which, inter alia, include ARCHIE'S, LITTLE ARCHIE, THE ARCHIES,
IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.1 of 16

ARCHIE COMICS etc.

The plaintiff has alleged that the trademark

'ARCHIE' was adopted by it in 1942. It also forms part of the plaintiff's
trade name. It is contended that by virtue of the long, continuous, open and
extensive use by the plaintiff, the 'ARCHIE' trademarks have become
intertwined with the identity of the plaintiff and as a result, consumers all
over the world, including those in India, associate the 'ARCHIE' trademarks
with the plaintiff and nobody else.

2.

It is also alleged in paragraph 4 of the plaint that in 1966 Archie

Comics were imported into India. There is also a reference to an invoice
issued by the plaintiff to Variety Book Depot in New Delhi on 08.05.1979
with regard to the plaintiff's publications. The plaintiff had applied for
registration of the 'ARCHIE and Heads' composite trademark/ label bearing
the application No. 518483 on 17.10.1989 in Class 16 and the plaintiff has
alleged that it has been extensively using the mark in India since 1979. It is
alleged that the 'ARCHIES', 'PURPLE ARCHIE', ARCHIES trademark and
device are being used by the defendants and the same are identical and/ or
deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trademarks 'ARCHIE' and 'ARCHIE
and HEAD'. It is alleged that the defendants in spite of the knowledge of
the said trademark and/ or activities of the plaintiff, decided to use the said
mark without authorization or consent of the plaintiff.

The plaintiff

allegedly came to know about the defendants for the first time in June 2004
when they came across the advertisement for the 'ARCHIES and device',

IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.2 of 16

'PURPLE ARCHIE' and 'ARCHIES' trademarks bearing application Nos.
597802, 846978, 1062578 and 1222947, all in Class 25. The defendants
are allegedly involved in the business of manufacturing and selling kids
wear under the 'ARCHIES/ PURPLE ARCHIES' and 'ARCHIES'
trademarks. It is consequently alleged on the part of the plaintiff that the
defendants are infringing the propriety rights of the plaintiff in the said
trademarks. The defendants are also alleged to have passed of their goods
and business as those of the goods and business of the plaintiff.

3.

The suit has been filed in this Court claiming that it has

jurisdiction to entertain the same on the basis of the averments made in
paragraph 32 of the plaint. Since the applications under consideration
relate to the question of jurisdiction, it would be pertinent to set out the
entire paragraph 32 of the plaint:“32.
That this Hon'ble Court has the jurisdiction to
entertain, try and determine the present suit as a part of
the cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction
of this Hon'ble Court. The Defendant's mark has been
advertised in the Trade Marks Journal which was
circulated in Delhi, within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble
Court. Therefore, this Hon'ble Court has the jurisdiction
to entertain, try and decide the present suit under Section
134 (2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 as the plaintiff is
carrying on its business in Delhi at least since 1979.”
4.

The defendants filed the application (IA 238/2006) for return of

the plaint. Though the application was styled as one under Order 7 Rule 11
of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the 'CPC'),

IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.3 of 16

since the prayer is for return of the plaint for filing before a proper and
competent court, the same is being treated as one under Order 7 Rule 10
CPC. It is the case of the defendants that a plain reading of the plaint
makes it obvious that plaintiff is carrying on its business outside India, that
is, in New York, U.S.A. and that the plaintiff has no place of business in
India nor has the plaintiff any exclusive distributor of its products within
the jurisdiction of this Court.

It has also been contended that the

defendants reside and carry on business and work for gain outside the
jurisdiction of this Court. The defendants do not have a branch office at
Delhi nor do they have any distributor at Delhi nor are the goods of the
defendants bearing the trademark 'ARCHIES' available within the
jurisdiction of this Court. It is contended that, in any event, the plaintiff
has not so pleaded. On behalf of the defendants it was contended that the
jurisdiction of this Court has primarily been invoked by the plaintiff on the
ground that the defendants' mark 'ARCHIES' in respect of ready-made
garments had been advertised in the Trademarks Journal which is circulated
in Delhi. It was also alleged that the plaintiff was carrying on its business
in Delhi, though the plaintiff has failed to disclose in the plaint the address
of its branch office or the name and address of any of its exclusive
distributors within the territory of Delhi. It was contended that on account
of non-disclosure of particulars in the plaint which are necessary for
invoking the territorial jurisdiction of this Court and more particularly in
view of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Dhodha House v.

IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.4 of 16

S. K. Maingi: (2006) 9 SCC 41, the plaint does not disclose as to how this
Court has territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the present suit and
consequently the defendants have prayed that the plaint be returned to the
plaintiff for filing before a proper and competent court.

5.

The plaintiff, faced with this situation, subsequently moved an

application being IA 5271/2006 under Order 6 Rule 17 read with Section
151 CPC seeking amendment of the plaint and in particular of paragraph 32
thereof by incorporating additional facts. The proposed paragraph 32 reads
as under:“32.
That this Hon'ble Court has the jurisdiction to
entertain, try and determine the present suit as a part of
cause of action arose within the territory of this Hon'ble
Court. The plaintiff is also carrying on its business at least
since 1979 and the plaintiff has its sole distributor i.e.
Variety Book Depot, Connaught Circus, New Delhi who is
exclusively selling Archie Comics on behalf of the plaintiff
within the territory of this Hon'ble Court and who has also
been importing books from the plaintiff in a substantial
way. The defendants had been selling their products to
their distributor within the territory of this Hon'ble Court.
The defendants are also advertising their products bearing
the trademark Archies in the newspapers which are printed
and have circulation within the territory of this Hon'ble
Court. The defendants have also been operating their
website, namely, www.purplearchies.com which can be
accessed from anywhere in India including Delhi. In view
of the above this Hon'ble Court has got the jurisdiction to
entertain and try the suit.”
It was contended that the case was at the initial stage and no prejudice
would be caused to the defendants if the said amendment was allowed
inasmuch as the defendants themselves had taken the objection in the
written statement as well as in IA No. 238/2006 regarding territorial
IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.5 of 16

jurisdiction. It was stated in the application that it is in these circumstances
that it had become necessary to move the application for amendment of the
plaint.

6.

It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the amendment

application ought to be considered first and then the defendants' application
for return of the plaint be considered. Several decisions were cited by the
learned senior counsel Mr Rajiv Nayar in support of the contention that
Order 6 Rule 17 is not controlled by and is not subservient to Order 7 Rule
11. The decisions were:(1)

Wasudhir Foundation v. C. Lal & Sons & Ors:
45 (1991) DLT 556;

(2)

Mrs. Kundan Lal & Ors. v. Smt. Prkash Wati: 19
(1981) DLT 314;

(3)

Hari Bhagwan Sharma & Ors. v. Badri Bhagat
Jhandewalan Temple Society & Ors: 27 (1985)
DLT 68; and

(4)

M/s Suraj Bhan Anil Kumar & Anr. v. Molu
Ram Kapoor Chand: 82 (1999) DLT 277.

But, the real issue which arises in this case is whether a Court which does
not have jurisdiction on the basis of the averments made in the plaint as
originally filed, can even entertain an application for amendment of the
plaint which if allowed would bring the case within the jurisdiction of such
Court? The issue of whether Order 6 Rule 17 is subservient or not to the
provisions of Order 7 Rule 11 also does not arise in the present case
because though IA No. 238/2006 is styled as an application under Order 7
IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.6 of 16

Rule 11 (albeit wrongly) it is, in point of fact, an application under Order 7
Rule 10 for the return of the plaint for presentation before the competent
Court. Therefore, the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the
plaintiff would not have much relevance in the context of the issues which
are required to be resolved in the present case.

7.

Mr Neeraj Kishan Kaul, the learned senior counsel appearing on

behalf of the defendants, had contended that before any application under
Order 6 Rule 17 could be considered by this Court, it had to rule with
regard to its jurisdiction. The ruling would have to be on the basis of the
averments made in the plaint as originally filed and if the Court came to the
conclusion that it had jurisdiction then and only then could the Court
consider the application filed by the plaintiff for amendment of the plaint.

8.

Considering the arguments advanced by the counsel for the

parties, the key question that needs to be resolved is whether this Court has
jurisdiction to entertain the suit on the basis of the averments made in the
plaint as originally filed? If the answer is in the affirmative, that is, if it is
held that this Court has jurisdiction then, obviously, the defendants'
application (IA No. 238/2006) for return of the plaint would have to be
rejected and the plaintiff's application (IA No. 5271/2006) for amending the
paragraph 32 of the plaint would have to be allowed inasmuch as the
amendments would be merely in the form of additional pleas regarding

IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.7 of 16

jurisdiction and since the suit is at the initial stage no prejudice would be
caused to the defendants. On the other hand, if the answer to the question
is in the negative, that is, this Court does not have jurisdiction, then the
application (IA 5271/2006) under Order 6 Rule 17 would not be
maintainable and the defendants' application (IA No. 238/2006) for return
of the plaint would have to be allowed.

In Hans Raj Kalra v. Kishan

Kalra: AIR 1977 NOC 267 (Delhi) it was noted that a Court having no
jurisdiction over the suit, inherent or pecuniary, is not competent to allow
amendment of the plaint, even if the amendment sought brings the suit
within the court's jurisdiction. In Anil Goel v. Sardari Lal: 75 (1998) DLT
641 a learned Single Judge of this Court, following an earlier decision in
the case of Lok Kalyan Samiti v.Jagdish Prakash Saini & Ors: 1995 (33)
DRJ 290 held:“.............that if a court does not have jurisdiction to try the
suit, no amendment can be allowed to bring the suit within
the jurisdiction of the court.
The court having no
jurisdiction in the matter cannot pass orders so as to assume
jurisdiction and the plaint in such a case has to be returned
for presentation in proper court”
The Division Bench decision of the Patna High Court in the case of Rudra
Nath v.Sheo Shankar: AIR 1983 Patna 53 is to the same effect.

After

referring to several decisions of other High Courts, the Division Bench
observed as under:“The granting of an amendment postulates an authority of
the Court to entertain the suit. But where there is inherent
lack of jurisdiction in the Court to entertain the suit itself, it
cannot make any order for amendment of the plaint to bring
the suit within its jurisdiction. In such a case the Court
IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.8 of 16

would be exercising its jurisdiction which is not vested in it
and, therefore, passing of any order would amount to
usurping a jurisdiction not vested in it. In such a case the
Court is bound to return the plaint to be represented to the
proper court in which the suit ought to have been instituted.
After the plaint is returned for presentation to the proper
Court, the plaintiff can amend the plaint and represent it to
the same Court.”
These decisions unmistakably lead to the conclusion that if this Court does
not have jurisdiction to entertain the suit on the basis of the averments
made in the plaint as originally filed, then the plaintiff's application under
Order 6 Rule 17 would not be maintainable and cannot be entertained. The
result would be that the defendants' application under Order 7 Rule 10
would have to be allowed and the plaint would have to be directed to be
returned to the plaintiff for filing before the competent Court.

9.

This discussion, therefore, clearly indicates that the question of

jurisdiction has to be determined on the basis of the averments made in the
plaint as originally filed. It must also be kept in mind that at the stage of
consideration of the return of the plaint under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC what
has to be looked into is the plaint and the averments made therein though
the plaint must be read in a meaningful manner to find the real intention
behind the suit. This is what has been held in Begum Sabiha Sultan v.
Nawab Mohd. Mansur Ali Khan : (2007) 4 SCC 343. A reading of
paragraph 32 of the plaint, which has been set out above, indicates that the
plaintiff has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court on two grounds:-

IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.9 of 16

(I)

That part of the cause of action arose within the
territorial jurisdiction of this Court on account of the
fact that the defendants' mark has been advertised in
the Trademarks Journal which was circulated in Delhi;
and

(II)

This Court has jurisdiction to entertain the present suit
in view of the provisions of Section 134 (2) of the
Trademarks Act, 1999 as the plaintiff is carrying on
business in Delhi at least since 1979.

As regards the first aspect with respect to the advertisement in the
Trademarks Journal, the Supreme Court decision in Dhodha House (supra)
has settled the issue in the following words:“.............. a suit may lie wherein infringement of trademark
and copyright takes place. But a cause of action for filing
the suit would not arise within the jurisdiction of the court
only because an advertisement has been issued in the
Trademarks Journal or any other journal, notifying the
factum of filing of such an application.”
In Pfizer Products Inc. v. Rajesh Chopra & Ors: 2006 (32) PTC 301
(Del.), I had occasion to consider the decision in Dhodha House (supra)
and it was concluded that the ratio in Dhodha House (supra) is that an
advertisement by itself in a Trademarks Journal would not confer
jurisdiction upon a court within whose territorial limits the advertisement is

IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.10 of 16

published or is seen. This being the legal position, the mere allegation that
the defendants' mark had been advertised in the Trademarks Journal which
was circulated in Delhi would not constitute a part of the cause of action.
Consequently, the plea of this Court having territorial jurisdiction, which
has been founded on this allegation, is untenable.

10.

It was sought to be contended on behalf of the plaintiff that

when the plaint was filed, the decision of the Supreme Court in Dhodha
House (supra) had not been rendered. And, at that point of time, the legal
position was that a suit could be filed in a Court within whose territorial
limits an application for registration of the trademark had been filed and/ or
advertised. In Sudhir G. Angur v. M. Sanjeev (2006 ) 1 SCC 141 ( a case
cited on behalf of the plaintiff on another point), the Supreme Court
observed with approval that in Shiv Bhagwan Moti Ram Saraoji v.
Onkarmal Ishar Dass: AIR 1952 Bombay 365 it has been held that no
party has a vested right to a particular proceeding or to a particular forum
and that all procedural laws are retrospective unless the legislature
expressly states to the contrary. The Supreme Court held that it is the law
on the date of trial of the suit which is to be applied. It agreed with the
observations in Shiv Bhagwan Moti Ram Saraoji (supra) that the
procedural laws in force must be applied at the date when the suit or
proceeding comes for trial or disposal and that a Court is bound to take
notice of the change in the law and is bound to administer the law as it is

IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.11 of 16

when the suit comes up for hearing. It was also noted that if a Court has
jurisdiction to try the suit, when it comes up for disposal, it then cannot
refuse to assume jurisdiction by reason of the fact that it had no jurisdiction
to entertain it on the date when it was instituted. This latter observation
was relied upon by the learned counsel for the plaintiff for the purposes of
claiming jurisdiction under Section 134 (2) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 on
the ground that subsequently the plaintiff’s application for registration had
been allowed and registration had been granted. I shall deal with that later.
For the present, it is clear that the law as it stands today would have to be
taken into account to determine the question of jurisdiction. Therefore, the
plea that when the suit was filed, the decision in the case of Dhodha House
(supra) had not been rendered by the Supreme Court and, therefore, the
question of jurisdiction ought to be considered de hors the Supreme Court
decision in Dhodha House (supra), is untenable.

11.

On the question of jurisdiction based on the argument that the

plaintiff was carrying on business in Delhi at least since 1979, it was
contended by the defendants that the admitted position is that the plaintiff
does not have any office in Delhi and the only allegation which is
discernible from a reading of the entire plaint and in particular paragraphs 4
and 32 thereof is that the plaintiff’s books were available in India through
its distributor ‘Variety Book Depot’at Delhi.

In this context it was

submitted on behalf of the defendants that there is a difference between an

IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.12 of 16

agent carrying on business for and on behalf of principal and a distributor
who does business not as an agent but on a principal to principal basis. It
was contended that the Variety Book Depot was alleged to be a distributor
and that the documents filed along with the plaint show that Variety Book
Depot was neither an agent of the plaintiff nor did the plaintiff have any
control over the way the business was conducted by it.

Reliance was

placed, once again, on the Supreme Court decision in Dhodha House
(supra) for explaining the expression ‘carries on business’. The Supreme
Court was of the view that for the purposes of carrying on business, the
presence of the businessmen at a particular place is not necessary inasmuch
as his business may be carried on at that place through an agent or a
manager or through a servant. The owner of the business may not even visit
that place. The Supreme Court noted that the phrase ‘carries on business’ at
a certain place would, therefore, mean having an interest in a business at
that place, a voice in what is done, a share in the gain or loss and some
control over the same. It was observed that the expression is much wider
than what the expression in normal parlance connotes. But it is necessary
that the following three conditions should be satisfied:(1)

The agent must be a special agent who attends
exclusively to the business of the principal and carries it
on in the name of the principal and not a general agent
who does business for any one that pays him;

(2)

The person acting as agent must be an agent in the strict
sense of the term; and

IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.13 of 16

(3)

To constitute ‘carrying on business’ at a certain place,
the essential part of the business must take place in that
place.

One of the illustrations given in respect of condition (1) above by the
Supreme Court would be quite apposite. The illustration reads as under:‘So a firm in England, carrying on business in the name of
A.B. & Co., which employs upon the usual terms a Bombay
firm carrying on business in the name of C.D & Co., to act as
the English firm’s commission agents in Bombay, does not
‘carry on business’ in Bombay so as to render itself liable to
be sued in Bombay.’
12.

The plaintiff has alleged that it has been carrying on business in

Delhi at least since 1979. The further allegation is that its business has been
conducted in Delhi through its sole distributor ‘Variety Book Depot’. It has
not been pleaded that ‘Variety Book Depot’attends exclusively to the
business of the plaintiff. Moreover, the business of ‘Variety Book Depot’is
not done in the name of the plaintiff.

Therefore, ‘Variety Book

Depot’cannot be regarded as an agent of the plaintiff for the purposes of
considering the expression ‘carries on business’ appearing in Section 134
(2) of the said Act. It is, therefore, clear that on the basis of the averments
made in the plaint itself the plaintiff has been unable to show that it is
carrying on business in Delhi. Consequently, the provisions of Section 134
(2) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 cannot be invoked by the plaintiff.

IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.14 of 16

13.

This conclusion is inevitable without this Court going into the

question of whether the plaintiff could at all have invoked Section 134 (2)
of the Trademarks Act, 1999 in view of the fact that on the date on which
the suit was filed, the plaintiff did not have any registered trademark in
India. It had been contended by the learned counsel for the defendants that
in view of the provisions of Section 27 of the Trademarks Act, 1999, no suit
for infringement could have been filed by the plaintiff in respect of an
unregistered trademark inasmuch as the plaintiff’s application for
registration was pending on that date. It was, however, contended by the
learned counsel for the plaintiff that subsequently registration had been
granted and this Court would have to consider the plaint as if the plaintiff’s
trademark had been registered in view of the provisions of Section 23 (1) of
the Trademarks Act, 1999 which stipulates that a trademark, when
registered, shall be registered as of the date of the making of the application.
Without going into this question and assuming that the plaintiff is suing on
the basis of a registered trademark, the provisions of Section 134 (2) of the
Trademarks Act, 1999 cannot be invoked because, as observed earlier, the
plaintiff cannot be said to be carrying on business in Delhi.

14.

The result of this discussion is that, considering the averments

made in the plaint as originally filed, this Court does not have territorial
jurisdiction to entertain the present suit. The effect of such a conclusion, as
noted earlier, is that the plaintiff’s application under Order 6 Rule 17 cannot

IA.Nos238/06&5271/2006 in CS(OS) 1420/2005

Page No.15 of 16

be heard by this Court and the same would not be maintainable before this
Court inasmuch as this Court does not have jurisdiction in the matter. As a
result, the plaint is liable to be returned to the plaintiff for the purposes of
filing before the competent court.

15.

IA 5271/2006 (under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC) is dismissed as not

maintainable. IA 238/2006 filed on behalf of the defendants for return of
the plaint is allowed.
