JUDGMENT
The prayers in this writ petition are that the Show Cause

Notice dated 8.4.2000 be declared as illegal and non est, not
being in compliance with Rule 13 (3)(I)(iii)(b) of the Army Rules,
1954 (for short Army Rules); and the Order dated 24.4.2000
WP(C)6790/2002

Page 1 of 8

whereby the petitioner was discharged and Struck off Strength
from the Army be quashed inter alia since it had not been given
effect to with due exercise of mind; and consequently that the
petitioner should be reinstated into service.

2.

This is thus the second round of litigation initiated by the

petitioner. The grievance in the first petition against his
discharge from the Army was

by way

of Writ Petition

No.1353/1994 which was allowed by Orders dated 15.2.1999.
The gravamen of the Order was that the Respondents had
violated Rule 13(3)(iii) of the Army Rules for the reason that the
Discharge Order was mandatorily to be signed by the General
Officer Commanding-in-Chief.

K. Ramamoorthy, J. had opined

that - “In the case of JCOs concerned of other classes of
discharge category, the officers mentioned in column 3(b) alone
can pass the order.

Before passing the order the officer

concerned has to give notice to the candidate. These two things
are absent in this case.

Therefore, the order of discharge is

liable to be quashed”. As a consequence of the decision in the
first litigation, the petitioner has received all backwages
amounting

to

Rs.4,59,449/-

for

the

period

upto

his

reinstatement.

Thereafter, the petitioner has been discharged by Orders

dated 24.4.2000 which states that his “discharge has been
sanctioned by the Army Cdr Eastern Command on 24 Apr 2000
as

intimated

by

CEEC

vide

their

letter

No.

HF-

131367/1/MON/Engrs/E1C(I) dated 24 Apr 2000 and struck off
Strength from the Army with effect from 24 Apr 2000
(Afternoon)”.

The

challenge

to this Order

is

two-fold.

Mr. Bareja, learned counsel for the petitioner, firstly stresses on
the fact that the Show Cause Notice issued to the petitioner in
terms of the letter dated 8.4.2000 has been signed by Brig(Pers
& Adm). It is his contention that the Show Cause Notice must
compulsorily have been authored and signed by the person
competent to dismiss/discharge the petitioner, i.e., General
Officer

Commanding-in-Chief,

if

not

below

the

rank

of

Lieutenant General. In this regard reliance has been placed on
the Union of India -vs- Harish Chandra Goswami, (1999) 4 SCC
575 and, in particular, to paragraph 8 thereof. We are of the
view that this decision is of no avail or applicability to the facts
of the present case.

Their Lordships were called upon to

construe Army Rule 37(3) which specifically states that the
convening of a General or District Court-martial must be
effected by a particular officer. We are not dealing with that
WP(C)6790/2002

Page 3 of 8

provision in the present case. So far as the particular Rule,
which we are concerned with, it stipulates that if the discharge
is not at the request of the petitioner/JCO, the General Officer
Commanding-in-Chief,

(the

competent

authority),

before

sanctioning the Discharge shall, if the circumstances of the case
permit, give the JCO concerned an opportunity to show cause
against the order of Discharge. In the case in hand we are not
called upon to decide whether an officer of the rank of Brigadier
was competent to issue a Show Cause Notice which would
eventually culminate in an order of Discharge. This is for the
simple reason that the Show Cause Notice dated 8.4.2000
specifically mentions that it has been signed for General Officer
Commanding-in-Chief. Therefore, even if a very narrow and
pedantic construction to Rule 13 (3)(iii) is to be carried out, the
Show Cause Notice must be held to have been issued by the
General Officer Commanding-in-Chief himself. There may not be
any infirmity in doing so, provided the competent officer had
directed the issuance of the Show Cause Notice and had also
given the response thereto due consideration.

4.

The second question is that in the previous round of

litigation there had been no mention of an ACR for the year
WP(C)6790/2002

Page 4 of 8

1992-93. The contention of Mr. Bareja is that the petitioner was
fully

entitled

in

law

to

receive

further

extension(s).

Furthermore, since the petitioner has already “served” for the
maximum contractual period of ten years, the petitioner was
eligible for regularisation into the Army. We have repeatedly
called upon the learned counsel for the petitioner to show us
any Rule or Regulation which creates a right in favour of the
petitioner, who joined the services of the Indian Army on a
contract basis, to claim regularisation. So far as the Rules are
concerned they prescribe a maximum period of ten years for
contractual service. The previous Order of Discharge was
predicated on various factors, including the ACR ratings of the
petitioner as well as observations and noting in the Pen Picture
of his excessive drinking and association with prostitutes. So far
as that material is concerned the learned Single Judge, who
allowed the previous writ petition, did not go into the merits or
demerits of the assessment. The writ petition was allowed on
the simple score of the Discharge Order not having been taken
by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief.

5.

It has been correctly pointed out by Mr. Ashwani

Bhardwaj, learned counsel for the Respondent, that there was
WP(C)6790/2002

Page 5 of 8

sufficient

material

on

the

record

for

not

extending

the

contractual services of the petitioner. Learned counsel for the
petitioner has drawn our attention to Annexure P-4 dated
29.12.1969 which speaks of absorption of direct entry JCOs
regular engagement. So far as these Orders are concerned they
clearly stipulate that selection of direct entry JCOs would be on
the

basis

of

the

Commanding/Chief

Recommendations
Engineer,

of

the

Commanding

Officer

and

the

performance of such JCOs as recorded in their ACRs. The
Officer concerned has not recommended even the extension of
the petitioner's contractual engagement, what to speak of his
regular

absorption.

Similarly,

the

letter

of

the

Army

Headquarters dated 4.5.1992 clearly envisages that there must
be a Recommendation in favour of the petitioner for grant of
extension as well as regular Junior Commission. The contention
of Mr. Bhardwaj is that the petitioner was not found suitable
even

for

extension

of

his

contractual

engagement,

and,

therefore, for him to harbour hopes of being regularised into the
Army was far too fanciful, if not hallucinatory. We have perused
the gradings of the petitioner for the year 1991, 1992 and 1993
and find no unreasonableness or perversity in the conclusion of
the Respondent as to the unsuitability of the petitioner for
WP(C)6790/2002

Page 6 of 8

retention in the Army. Mr. Bareja has also contended that the
officer concerned, who is of the rank of Lieutenant General, was
merely carrying out orders of the Army Headquarters. It is his
contention that contrary to the expectations of the Act and the
Rules there was no exercise of mind by this officer. We find no
reason to hold that the discretion which is vested with the
Respondent to extend the contractual engagement of the
petitioner and to regularise him, has been exercised arbitrarily
or without merit.

6.

We may briefly also mention the argument by Mr. Bareja

that in the previous litigation no mention had been made of ACR
for the year 1992-1993. It has not been denied that for this
period the petitioner had been Discharged on 29.7.1993 and if
the Respondents find it unnecessary to make a mention of this
ACR in the previous proceedings, no adverse inference would be
justified.

7.

The petitioner does not possess any right to demand

extension of contractual service. He has certainly no right to
claim regularisation into the Army, given his dismal service
record. In the exercise of our extraordinary powers under
WP(C)6790/2002

Page 7 of 8

Article 226 of the Constitution of India we would be always slow
to pass orders directing reinstatement of any personnel into a
disciplined armed force. In the present case we find no reason
whatsoever to pass any such orders.

8.

In these circumstances the writ petition is devoid of merit

and is dismissed.
