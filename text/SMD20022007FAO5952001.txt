1.

This appeal is directed against the judgment dated

31.10.2001 of the learned Additional District Judge, Delhi in
H.M.A. No 21/2001/92 whereby the Trial Court had dismissed
the appellant's petition seeking dissolution of marriage under
Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act ('Act') on the ground of
cruelty.

2.

The appellant sought to base the petition on three or four

instances.

It is first urged that the respondent had started

misbehaving with the petitioner after few months of the
marriage. It was alleged by the appellant that the respondent

had developed illicit relationship with somebody. Thirdly it was
alleged that the respondent had told the appellant and his
relatives that the child born to the parties on 28.8.1990 from
somebody else. Fourthly, it was alleged that the respondent had
not allowed the appellant to come near and perform the marital
relations.

Lastly, it is alleged that the respondent gave some

poisonous substance in the tea to the petitioner. There was also
an allegation that the respondent had started removing her
belongings from the residence of the petitioner.

3.

The appellant has examined himself, his brother-in-law

and his employer as his witnesses. The respondent has
examined herself and her family friends as her witnesses.

4.

The Trial Court framed the following issues:
(i)

Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner
with cruelty as alleged? OPP.

(ii)

Whether the petitioner is taking the benefit of his
wrongs as alleged in written statement? OPR

the evidence as to why the respondent

had removed any such articles from the
residence of the petitioner.

6.

As regards the evidence on the other issues, the Trial

Court held that there was no material on record to show that
the petitioner is tried to take benefit of his own wrongs. On the
third issue, the Trial Court again held that the respondent had
failed to prove that the parties lived together as husband and
wife even after filing of the present petition. Nevertheless, in
view of the findings on Issue No.1, the petition was dismissed.

7.

Learned counsel for the appellant refers to the evidence of

PW-1 before the Trial Court on Issue No.1. The relevant portion
of the said evidence reads as under:
“Respondent started misbehaving after
few months of their marriage. She is
employed in CDR in Medical Centre.
She developed illicit relations with some
body. And she told me that the child is
not from him and it is from somebody.
The respondent told the above said
thing in the presence of my relations.
She/respondent did not allow the
petitioner to come near her and was not
to allow her to perform the marital
relations. She did not allow for the last
about one year from the date of the
petition.
Thereafter, she gave some
poisonous substance in tea.
After
taking the tea I started g which saved
my life.
She started removing the
articles of the house to the relations and
friends. I am living separately for six
months prior to the filing of the petition.
I told this thing to her brother but she
did not accede to his request and she
thrown me out of the house. I have not
been living together or cohabiting with
her since of the filing of the petition.
After the filing of the petition she filed a
FAO No 595/2001

page no 4 of 5

complaint in dowry cell against myself,
my sister and my brother-in-law. She
also made a complaint in the office of
my brother-in-law. I can identify the
signatures of respondent. I have seen
her writing and signing.”
8.

A perusal of the said evidence show that ............... on the

pleading on record in that, even in the examination-in-chief, the
petitioner is unable to specify the name of the person with
whom the respondent alleged to have illicit relationship or give
any particular details of any instance of cruelty treatment of the
appellant by the respondent. The evidence of the appellant even
by way of examination-in-chief inspires a little confidence in the
case by the appellant having made out against the respondent.
This Court is unable to give any contradictory conclusion in that
arrived by the Trial Court in the matter and no infirmity can be
found in the findings of the Trial Court that the pleadings as
well as depositions of PW-1 is wholly vague in relation to the
instances upon which the petition of the appellant is based.

9.

For the above reasons, there is no merit at all and it is

dismissed with costs of Rs.5,000/- which will be paid by the
appellant to the respondent within a period of four weeks.
