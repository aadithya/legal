By an order dated 18th April, 1996 in Suit No.359A of 1989 a

petition filed by Smt. Bimla Rani Kohli, Shri H.C. Kohli and Shri Anil
Kohli against the Delhi Development Authority and the Union of India, this
court appointed Late Hon’ble Mr. Justice D.R. Khanna, retired Judge of this
court, as an arbitrator. The learned arbitrator made and published an award
dated 17th May, 1997 and filed the same in this court. The award has been
registered in this court as Suit No.1244/1997.
3.

Notice of the filing of the award was served on both parties. The

Delhi Development Authority has filed objections under Sections 30 & 33
of the Arbitration Act, 1940 which have been registered as IA
No.8659/1997. These were filed on 3rd September, 1997.
Shri H.C. Kohli has filed objections dated 15th September, 1997
which have been registered by this court as IA No.9232/1997.
4.

IA No.10253/2003 is dated 8th October, 2003 and was filed by Shri

Harish Chand Kohli praying for a direction to the respondents to comply
with the orders dated 5th April, 2002 and 19th May, 2003 passed in the
present case.
IA No.9118/2005 has been filed again by Shri Harish Chand Kohli on
CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.2

the 15th November, 2005 under Sections 15 & 17 of the Arbitration Act,
1940, praying for a part of the award to be made a rule of the court.
5.

Before adverting to the facts of the instant case, it would be

appropriate to bear in mind the parameters laid down by this court with
regard to the permissible scope of judicial review of arbitral awards. These
parameters are well settled and have been laid down in a catena of
judgments.

Some of the judicial pronouncements which would have a

bearing on the case and are topical for the purposes of consideration of the
facts of the instant case have laid down as notice in AIR 1987 Delhi 134
College of Vocational Studies v. S.S. Jaitely; AIR 1982 Delhi 425 Delhi
Development Authority v. Uppal Engineering Construction Co. New
Delhi ; 2005 (6) SCC 678 Rajendra Construction Co. v. Maharashtra
Housing Area Development Authority, the courts have laid down that there
are limits for judicial reviewability and the courts exercise limited
jurisdiction in the proceedings for setting aside an award under section 30 of
the Arbitration Act, 1940. The courts do not exercise appellate jurisdiction
over the verdict of an arbitrator and as such cannot go into the merits of the
case nor the courts can reappraise and re-examine the evidence led before
the arbitrator. The courts cannot go into the insufficiency of the evidence
CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.3

led before the arbitrator. Even when the arbitrator is required to give
reasons, it is not for the Courts to see the reasonableness of the reasons
given by the arbitrator or sufficiency of the reasons.
6.

The present matter has to be examined in the light of these parameters

which are binding upon this court.
7.

To the extent necessary for the purposes of adjudication of the issues

raised in the present case, the essential facts are briefly noticed hereinafter.
The objectors Smt. Bimla Rani Kohli, Sh. Harish Chand Kohli and Sh. Anil
Kumar Kohli purchased shop no.3 in LSC Munirka, Phase-II, Wing C in
the public auction from the Delhi Development Authority on 9th September,
1986 for a consideration of Rs.3,15,000/- for the purposes of running a
halwai shop. Possession of the shop was taken over on 31 st July, 1987. A
day prior to the date of taking possession, the petitioners noticed the
following defects in the shop:(i)

Rolling shutter damaged.

(ii)

Inner shutters were not fitted.

(iii)

Rain water pipes were chocked.

(iv)

Roof was profusely leaking and the boundary wall was
broken.

CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.4

8.

The Delhi Development Authority has contended that the position has

been accepted by the arbitrator that when these persons were given
possession on 31st July, 1987, these defects were removed. No such defects
were noticed in the possession letter which was executed by the petitioners.
9.

The petitioners failed to commence business even though all other

shopkeepers in the local shopping complex commenced their business in
accordance with the terms of the lease which required the persons to
commence business within a period of three months of taking over of the
possession. The D.D.A. had issued a public notice to this effect also in the
year 1988. For this reason, the DDA issued a show cause notice to the
petitioners on 3rd January, 1989 under Clause 4(3) of the terms of the lease
which was binding on them and requiring them to explain as to why action
be not taken for non-operation of the shops. The petitioners objected to the
notice alleging that the DDA was responsible for the unhygienic conditions
at the site and for not having set up a surrounding infrastructure resulting in
ruination of the prospects of healthy running of the halwai shop.
According to the petitioners, there was no approach road to the shop, water
supply was not proper and the shopping complex, which was to be built
CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.5

under the lay out scheme of the area, had not come up.
10.

The petitioners also requested the Lt. Governor of Delhi to appoint an

arbitrator. As he failed to do so, they moved the above noted petition under
Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. This court while appointing the
learned arbitrator by the order dated 18th April, 1996 had referred the
following disputes for adjudication.
“1.

Whether the defects in the Shop in question noted at the
time of the joint inspection by the officers of the defendant
No.1 and the plaintiffs on 30.7.1987 are rectified by the
defendant no.1?

2.

Whether the defendant No.1 must provide the
infrastructure like the passage no.1 to shop. Keeping
clean and hygienic surroundings of the building in which
the shop is situated?

3.

Whether the plaintiffs could not run the Halwai shop on
account of any inaction on the part of the defendant no.1?

4.

Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to claim and get Rs.8
lakhs by way of damages from the defendant no.1?

5.

Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to get damages from the
date of suit till the date of award? If yes, to what amount
the plaintiffs are entitled?

6.

Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to claim and get interest
on the amount if any found due to them?

7.

Whether the defendant no.1 is justified in invoking Clause

CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.6

4(iii) of the terms and conditions of the contract between
the parties?
8.

11.

What order regarding the cost of arbitration including the
fees of the Arbitrator and who is liable to pay the same?”

By the Award dated 17th of May, 1997, the learned arbitrator has

answered all the disputes against the petitioners. This award has been
assailed by the petitioner before this court by way of IA No.9232/1997 on
the ground that the learned arbitrator had failed to consider the contentions
of the petitioners and had not complied with the principles of natural justice.
12.

So far as the objections of the DDA in IA No.8659/1997 are

concerned, it has been contended that some of the observations of the
learned arbitrator are beyond the terms of agreement between the parties and
consequently the award suffers from errors apparent on the face of the
record requiring those findings to be set aside and quashed.
13.

I have heard Mr. Harish Chand Kohli, the petitioner no.2 who

represented all the petitioners before this court and Ms. Geeta Mehrotra,
learned counsel for the respondent-DDA. I have been taken through the
records of the case in respect of the respective contentions.
14.

I find that the learned arbitrator not only considered the respective

CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.7

statements of the case and the pleadings but also dealt with the evidence led
by both parties. Apart from the record which was placed by the parties
before the learned arbitrator, even a detailed spot inspection was conducted
by the learned arbitrator on the 19th December, 1996 wherein observations
as existed on the spot have been recorded.
15.

The petitioners have objected that the learned arbitrator has rejected

their claims which were raised in the form of dispute no.1 and that they
were entitled to the amount of damages of Rs.8,35,374/- as was claimed. I
find that the learned arbitrator has dealt with the case at length and recorded
reasons for rejecting the claims. It was pointed out that the petitioners did
not object, in any manner and did not point out any defects as existing in the
shop when they took its possession on 31st July, 1987. No evidence at all
was placed before the learned arbitrator in support of claim set up by the
petitioners. The learned arbitrator relied upon the facts as revealed in the
inspection as noted on the 19th December, 1996 and no defects were found
to be existing.

Even in the submissions made before this court, the

petitioners could not point out any material or evidence which was on the
record and was overlooked by the arbitrator.

CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.8

In this view of the matter, I find no force in the objections of the
petitioners so far as the dispute no.1 is concerned.
16.

So far as the award relating to dispute nos.2 & 3 is concerned, the

DDA has also objected to the findings of the learned arbitrator.

It is

submitted that having given positive findings in favour of the DDA to the
effect that there was no such inaction on the part of the DDA whereby it was
rendered impossible to running the shops, consequently it was not open to
the learned arbitrator to return any other findings. Consequently the finding
relating to the path going to the shop requiring paving and removal of
debris, was wholly beyond the terms of reference and the specific agreement
between the parties.
17.

On the other hand, the petitioners have contended that non-

availability of properly paved path and debris existing in the area, show that
the DDA was at fault for inaction and was responsible for the inability of
the petitioners to run shops.
18.

It would be noteworthy to notice the objections which have been

urged on behalf of the petitioners. The petitioners have raised a claim and
entitlement to a 90 meters road to their shop. The petitioners have sought a
private path to the shops which were located in a local shopping complex
CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.9

which include not only the petitioners’ shop but also other shops in the
market. The learned arbitrator has considered the lay out plan of the area at
great length and in painstaking detail. It has been noticed that there was
also a provision for a commercial complex which was under construction by
a private party in respect of a plot in the area. Behind this plot as well there
is a large parking area. In fact, the learned arbitrator has noticed that when
the shopping complex came up, the value of the shop in dispute as also any
business run therein would tremendously increase. So far as access to the
shops was concerned, two approaches to the shops have been pointed out,
one from the road between the DDA complex and the Munirka village while
the other was from the side from which the learned arbitrator has
approached the shops.
For this reason, the learned arbitrator has held that it could not be said
that there were no approach passages to the market concerned.
19.

So far as the path to the shop was concerned, the learned arbitrator

noticed that it was on account of the manner in which the same was used by
local people that debris had been thrown and paving was required.
However, certainly, the petitioners cannot claim an absolute and exclusive
road to their shop. The contract between the parties also does not provide
CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.10

for a 90 meters road as has been claimed by the petitioners. Therefore, no
such right lay in favour of the petitioners under the terms of the contract.
20.

In any case, while the present matter was pending before this court,

with the intent of putting an end to the controversy, it appears that on the 5th
April, 2005, this court recorded an order that irrespective of the nature of
the proceedings, it would be appropriate and expedient if the ViceChairman of the DDA has a look at the grievance of the petitioners and if
possible, tries to redress the same, uninfluenced by the award dated 17th
May, 1997. This direction was repeated in the order passed on 19 th May,
2003 by this court. The counsel for the DDA was advised to take up the
matter with the Vice-Chairman in terms of the earlier order without
effecting in any manner the merits of the case.
21.

It appears that pursuant to these directions, the matter was examined

by the DDA and an affidavit dated 15th November, 2003 sworn by Shri
Surajit Roy, Director (CL) of the DDA has been filed in this court wherein
the DDA has stated thus:“2.

THAT so far as sanitation is concerned, although it is
the responsibility of the Municipal Corporation of

CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.11

Delhi, yet the Delhi Development Authority has seen
to it that proper sanitary conditions are maintained in
the Shopping Centre in question. It has been decided
that a proper and constant contact will be maintained
with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to keep the
area in satisfactory sanitary conditions.
3.

4.

22.

THAT so far as the boundary wall in question is
concerned, it is stated that the boundary wall has infact
been constructed in accordance with the Lay Out Plan
of the area in question. Infact the boundary wall was
required not only for safety and security reasons, but
also to separate it from the Plot of land immediately
adjacent to it, which has already been allotted. A copy
of the Lay Out Plan of the area in question showing the
Shopping Complex, the Boundary Wall, and the
Contiguous Plot of land already is being annexed
herewith as Annexure “A”.
THAT there is no scope or even a provision for carving
out a passage from the plot of land in question in as
much as the plot of land, as already stated, stands
allotted and has to be used as the allottee has his leased
property and as a whole.”

It appears that irrespective of the requirement in the contract and the

present proceedings, the DDA is discharging its public law obligations so
far as the shopping complex is concerned. It would be noteworthy that the
learned arbitrator has noted that all other shops in the market were being
used except that of the petitioners. No complaint has been raised by any
other person and certainly no individual can be permitted to demand

CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.12

individual changes and modifications.
23.

The learned arbitrator has noticed that the DDA has provided a public

toilet and also water taps have been found in all other shops. The DDA has
pointed out that obtaining an individual connection is the responsibility of
the individual which is to be obtained from the water authority. In this
behalf, the DDA had informed the MCD as back as on 6th April, 1998 that
all sewerages and storm water lines had been laid.
24.

From the perusal of the objections and the claim which was raised

before the arbitrator, it is apparent that the petitioners have raised demands
and claims in respect of matters which are wholly beyond the purview of the
terms of the auction and the specific terms of the allotment of the shop. The
same is clearly impermissible in law. I see no reason to consequently vary
the findings of the learned arbitrator on the dispute nos.2 & 3 in the light of
the well settled principles of law noticed above.
25.

So far as the objections of the D.D.A. relating to the observations of

the learned arbitrator with regard to maintenance of hygienic conditions or
paving of path which is beyond the shop are concerned, in this behalf, I may
usefully advert to the affidavit filed by Shri Surajit Roy, Director (CL) of
the DDA dated 15th November, 2003, noticed above. Inasmuch as the DDA
CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.13

has stated that it is discharging its public law obligations, nothing further is
required to be said in respect of these objections.
26.

The learned arbitrator has given a detailed discussion while

considering the dispute nos.2 & 3 which covers its findings on dispute
nos.4, 5, 6 & 7. It is noteworthy that the show cause notice was issued by
the DDA to the petitioner on 3rd January, 1989 through this court. The
petitioners sought reference of the matter to arbitration by way of Suit
No.359A of 1989. Ever since, the matter has remained pending either
before this court or before the learned arbitrator. The award was rendered
as back as on 17th May, 1997 which is more than almost nine and a half
years ago. No complaint could be substantiated by the petitioners with
regard to the shop which the DDA has leased out and consequently, the
petitioners are bound by the terms of the allotment. The petitioners were
required to commence business in the shop within a period of three months
from the date of taking possession.
While making the award on 17th May, 1997, the learned arbitrator was
of the view that the petitioners may be finally given another three months’
time for starting the business. As noticed above, a period of nine and a half
years have passed since then. Looked at from any angle, no further relief is
CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.14

required to be given to the petitioners in the present proceedings.
27.

In view of the affidavit dated 15th November, 2003 which has been

filed by Shri Surajit Roy, Director (CL), no further orders are required to be
passed on IA No.10253/2003 which is hereby dismissed.
28.

I have discussed at length the claim of the petitioners with regard to a

passage to the shop and the other demands of the petitioners which are de
hors the provisions of the contract between the parties. For this reason, in
case the petitioners are aggrieved by any inaction of the DDA with regard to
the maintenance of the area around their shop, the present proceedings
would not be the appropriate remedy. Certainly, the petitioner cannot claim
relief in respect thereof by filing application as IA No.9118/2005 in the
present proceedings, the scope whereof is extremely limited as noticed
above.
Accordingly, IA No.9118/2005 is dismissed.
29.

In view of the aforegoing discussions, I find no merit in the

objections filed by the petitioners by way of IA No.9232/1997 which is
hereby dismissed.
30.

So far as the objections of the DDA as have been laid in IA

No.8659/1997, the same do not survive for adjudication in the light of the
CS (OS) No.1244A/1997

Page No.15

affidavit dated 15th November, 2003 and are disposed of as such.
31.

So far as CS (OS) No.1244A/1997 is concerned, the objections to the

award have been dismissed for the reasons noticed hereinabove.
32.

Accordingly, the award dated 17th May, 1997 is made rule of the

court. A decree in terms thereof be drawn up by the Registry in accordance
with law.
There shall be no orders as to costs.
