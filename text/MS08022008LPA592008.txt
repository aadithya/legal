1.

This appeal is directed against the order dated 30 th November,

2007 dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant.

The writ

petition was filed by the appellant impugning the award dated 11th
October, 2006 passed by the Presiding Officer, Industrial Tribunal No.1,

LPA No.59/2008

Karkardooma Courts in ID case No.40/2006.
2.

The appellant was appointed as a Data Entry Operator on ad

hoc basis by the respondent under order dated 26th March, 2001. The
counsel for the appellant has drawn our attention to the said
appointment order.

He states that although the appellant was

appointed on ad hoc basis, he continued to work till 2004 and on one
fine morning he was told that his services stand terminated without
issuing any written orders.
3.

Since according to the appellant the aforesaid action of the

respondent amounted to unjustified and illegal termination, therefore,
he sought for a reference, which was accepted by the appropriate
Government and on the basis of his request, the following issue was
referred to the Industrial Tribunal:

“Whether services of Sh. P.K. Sharma, s/o Sh.
C.B. Sharma, have been terminated by the
management illegally and/or unjustifiably, and if
so, to what sum of money as monetary relief
along with consequential benefits in terms of
existing laws/government notifications and to
what other relief is he entitled and what
directions are necessary in this respect?”
“Whether Sh. P.K. Sharma, s/o Sh. C.B. Sharma,

LPA No.59/2008

page 2 of 7

is entitled to be regularized in the service of the
post of Data Entry Operator from the initial date
of his appointment i.e. from 27.03.2001 with all
consequential benefits. If so, what directions are
necessary in this respect ?”
4.

The Tribunal on receipt of the aforesaid reference received

evidence adduced by the parties and on appreciation thereof and upon
hearing the counsel appearing for the parties passed an award on 11 th
October, 2006 holding that the case of the appellant squarely falls
within the parameters of the provisions of Section 2(oo)(bb) of the
Industrial Disputes Act and, therefore, the disengagement of the
appellant would not be termed illegal retrenchment.

It was also

recorded in the award passed by the Industrial Adjudicator that the
appellant was appointed in the capacity of Data Entry Operator on ad
hoc basis. It was also held that since there were no Recruitment Rules,
therefore, the respondent was not under any obligation to regularise
the services of the appellant.
5.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid findings recorded by the

Industrial Adjudicator, the aforesaid writ petition was filed, which was
considered in depth by the learned Single Judge and the same was
dismissed by the impugned judgment and order, which is under
challenge in this appeal, on which we have heard learned counsel
appearing for the appellant as also the counsel appearing for the
LPA No.59/2008

page 3 of 7

respondent.
6.

The order of appointment dated 26th March, 2001 clearly

indicates that the appellant was engaged to work against the post of
Data Entry Operator on ad hoc basis. Records were placed before the
learned Single Judge by the respondent to show that the services of the
appellant were availed by the respondent during the period 1994 –
2002 for the project, namely, “India Population Project-VIII”. There is
an office order dated 14th May, 2007, which reiterates the said position
and it contains the names of all the persons, who were so engaged.
One of the names is that of the appellant. Besides the appellant, the
other persons whose names also appear, were recruited as Data Entry
Operators by the respondent on contractual basis for completion of the
said project, which is said to have been funded by the World Bank. The
learned Single Judge has extracted the contents of the said office
order, which appears at page 52 of the writ petition, to the following
effect:
“MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF DELHI

7.

The aforesaid document placed on record clearly indicates that

not only the appellant was appointed on ad hoc basis, but the said
appointment was only for a specific project.

In this connection the

provisions of Section 2(oo)(bb) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are
relevant wherein it is stated that the disengagement from services of a
person as mentioned in the said provision amounts to termination of
services.
8.

Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, it is clearly

established that the alleged termination of the appellant was also
outside the purview of the term “retrenchment”.

The aforesaid

conclusion was also arrived at by the learned Single Judge after
referring to the various decisions of the Supreme Court, namely, State
of Himachal Pradesh v. Suresh Kumar Verma reported as JT 1996
(2)

SC

455

and

Madhyamik

Shiksha

Parishad,

Uttar

Pradesh v. Anil Kumar Mishra & Others reported as AIR 1994 SC

LPA No.59/2008

page 6 of 7

1638, besides Secretary, State of Karnataka and Others v. Uma
Devi and Others, reported as 2006 (4) SCC 1. In para 54 of the said
decision, it is held thus:
“54. It is also clarified that those decisions which
run counter to the principle settled in this
decision, or in which directions running counter to
what we have held herein, will stand denuded of
their status as precedents.”
9.

In that view of the matter and looking at the nature of

appointment of the appellant, we are of the considered opinion that
the provisions of Section 25(F) of the Industrial Disputes Act are not
applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case as
disengagement of the appellant was a case which is fully covered by
the provisions of clause (bb) to Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes
Act. We find no merit in this appeal, which is dismissed.
