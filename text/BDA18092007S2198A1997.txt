1.

I have heard the learned counsel for the parties. The objections have

been filed on behalf of the DDA in respect of the Award dated 23.09.1997.
Although the learned counsel for the DDA went through the entire Award claim
by claim trying to point out deficiencies and / or errors, the main focus has been
on the findings in respect of claim No.7 and the question of interest.
Arguments were also advanced at length in respect of claim No. 18. The main
contention of the learned counsel for the respondents was that the learned
Arbitrator had not given reasons and has ignored the submissions made on their
behalf. At the outset I may observe that this is not the impression that I got

Page No. 1 of 4

when the Award was read. I found that the learned Arbitrator has discussed the
arguments of both sides under each claim and given his findings based upon
reasons. So, this general objection on the part of the respondents is untenable.

2.

However, insofar as the discussion under the head “claim No.7” is

concerned, I find that there are various errors in the Award. The relevant
clauses have not been referred to appropriately and the discussion on this aspect
appears to be muddled.

The issue involved under claim No.7 is whether the

claimant is entitled to an extra amount in respect of work done for putting in
place ornamental grills rather than plain grills which was the subject matter of
the agreement between the parties. Clause 3.11 of the Specifications and
Conditions was pressed into service by the learned counsel for the DDA to
show that no distinction is to be made between plain and ornamental grills for
payment. However, the learned counsel for claimant submitted that this clause
relates only to the rates of steel and not to the labour involved in the fabrication
of the grills. It is clear that ornamental grills require more labour than plain
grills. It has been recorded by the learned arbitrator that the claimant had put in
place ornamental grills and, therefore, he went ahead and awarded an amount of
Rs 2,04,378/- as against the claim of Rs 2,50,000/-. I find that the discussion
under claim No. 7 in the Award is not at all clear. In fact, there is no discussion
as to under which clause the claimant would be entitled to extra payment.
There may be some logic in what the learned counsel for the claimant submits

but that has to be borne out by the agreement between the parties. Therefore,
insofar as that claim (i.e, claim No.7) is concerned, I feel that the matter needs
to be reconsidered. For this purpose the matter be placed for arbitration afresh
on this issue alone before the Superintending Engineer (Arbitration) of the
DDA.

3.

Insofar as the question of interest is concerned, the learned arbitrator has

awarded interest at the rate of 15% per annum, which in my view is on the
excessive side. This is taking into consideration the fact that the interest rates
have dropped and declined from what they used to be in early 90's to what they
are at present. At one stage the interest rates had fallen to as low as 6% per
annum. Therefore, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, I think
that the appropriate rate of interest would be 10% per annum. The interest for
the future shall also be at the rate of 10% per annum from the date of the
decree.

4.

As regards claim No. 18, I find no infirmity with the Award. The entire

issue has been discussed in detail and the learned Arbitrator has arrived at the
conclusion after giving his reasons.

5.

Thus, with the modification with regard to interest and the claim No. 7,

the Award is made a Rule of the Court.

accordingly. Insofar as the claim No.7 is concerned, that shall go to the
arbitrator, as indicated above, for adjudication afresh. The parties may appear
before the said arbitrator on 31.10.2007 at 4 pm.
This application and suit stand disposed of.
