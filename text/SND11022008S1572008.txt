JUDGMENT:

1.

The plaintiff had entered into a collaboration agreement

dated 31st March, 2000 with defendant no. 1.

Under this collaboration

agreement, defendant no. 1 was to demolish the existing structure of plot
no. 27-A, Friends Colony, New Delhi and was to make flats on the plot.
The plaintiff was to receive 14,500 square feet of the constructed area
including basement over the plot of 470 square yard and remaining 6,000
square feet of constructed area was to go to defendant no. 1 and entire
construction was to be done by defendant no. 1 at his own costs and
expenses. Over and above that, the defendant no. 1 was also to pay to
the plaintiff a sum of Rs.30 lacs in 3 installments, one installment of Rs. 10
lacs in advance at the time of entering into MoU, second installment of 10
lacs at the time of sanctioning of building plans by MCD and handing over
possession of the building to the defendants no. 1 & 2 and third
installment of Rs. 10 lacs on completion of the construction of the
building. As per MoU, the building was to be constructed and completed
by 30th June, 2001 and in case the builder failed to construct the building

by that date and hand over the owner's share, the builder was to pay
compensation of Rs.30,000/- per month to the owner/plaintiff.
2.

Thereafter, a supplementary agreement was entered into

between the parties on 2nd May, 2001, whereby the last date for
completion of construction was revised to 30th June, 2002 and other
clauses remained the same. It was further provided that “if builder fails
to construct the house by 30th June, 2002 then this MoU/agreement shall
come to an end automatically and the builder shall be left with no right or
interest in the agreement and the owner shall have right to complete the
construction on his own. Any material or plant of the builder lying at site
shall become the property of the owner.

The owner shall also not be

liable to refund the amounts already paid by the builder to the owner.”
3.

Plaintiff has filed this suit alleging that builder though bound

by the terms and conditions of the agreement, did not comply with these
terms and conditions and failed to pay the final installment of Rs.10 lacs
and failed to complete construction of building by 30th June, 2002 and the
builder handed over the possession of the plaintiff's share only on 2nd
October, 2003.

The builder also did not pay the compensation @

Rs.30,000/- per month. The builder failed to construct for the plaintiff a
room in the basement floor of the plaintiff's share as required under
Clause 5(A)(3a) of the agreement and builder failed to construct for the
plaintiff, 5 out of 8 number of servant quarters as required under the
agreement.
4.

The plaintiff had also executed a General Power of Attorney

(GPA) in favour of defendant no. 2 giving him right to sell the flats falling
in his share.

This GPA is a registered document.

It is stated by the

plaintiff that since defendant nos. 1 and 2 failed to carry out their
obligations and duties, the defendant no. 2 was not entitled to sell his
share of the flats to any third party. The GPA was to come into force only
after the builder had completed his obligations.

Since builder had not

completed his obligations, GPA was ineffective and no sale could be made

under this GPA. Since defendant no. 2 had already effected sale of the
property taking benefit of the GPA and executed sale deed dated
21.5.2004 in favour of the defendant nos. 4 and 5, the sale deed so
executed should be declared null and void. It is alleged that plaintiff came
to know about the execution of sale deed on 2nd January, 2007 when
affidavit in evidence was filed by the defendant in another case pending
before this Court between the parties. Plaintiff has filed this suit seeking
declaration that GPA executed by plaintiff in favour of defendants no. 1 &
2 on 24.2.2000 was null and void and the sale deed executed by
defendant no. 2 in favour of defendants no. 4 & 5 using GPA, in respect of
first floor was null and void. He also sought injunction against using GPA
by defendant no. 2.
5.

A perusal of the suit would show that the plaintiff has claimed

that cause of action arose in favour of the plaintiff when the terms and
conditions of the collaboration agreement were not fulfilled by the
defendant. The plaintiff in the suit has also claimed alternative relief of a
sum of Rs.35,57,000/- on account of breach of different terms and
conditions of the collaboration agreement. The collaboration agreement
exhausted itself on 30th June, 2002. As per clause reproduced above in
para 2, the plaintiff was entitled to take possession of the entire building
by ousting defendants, get the construction completed and do rest of the
work himself. The plaintiff, if wanted to file a suit on the ground of breach
of agreement, could have filed within 3 years of 30th June, 2002 which was
the last day upto which the agreement was to remain valid. If the terms
and conditions had not been complied with, the agreement gave a right to
the plaintiff to treat it as null and void and proceed as if he was the
absolute owner of the entire property. Plaintiff knew it very well that he
had executed a GPA in favour of the defendant no. 2. If the defendant
had violated the agreement as is claimed by the plaintiff, plaintiff had a
right to cancel the GPA and get the cancellation deed registered with the
Sub Registrar. The plaintiff did not cancel the GPA and did not take any

action against the defendant for breach of any of the terms and
conditions, as alleged in the suit, after 30th June, 2002 till the filing of the
suit, which has been filed after 7 & ½ years. The period of limitation for
filing such a suit is three years. The suit is hopelessly time barred and
liable to be dismissed.
6.

The plea of the plaintiff that cause of action arose when he

learnt about sale of the property is baseless. The cause of action for the
suit itself arose when the various breaches of terms and conditions of MoU
were done by the defendant no.1. I, therefore, find that the suit is time
barred and is not maintainable and is hereby dismissed.
