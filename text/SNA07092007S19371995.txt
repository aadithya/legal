Page 1 of 26

Companies Act, 1956 and was at the relevant time engaged in the

The

defendant

No.

1

is

an

overseas

company

incorporated under the Laws of America. Defendants No. 2 & 3
are stated to be the subsidiaries of defendant No. 1 company. The
defendant No. 1 company had entered into an agreement with the
State of Karnataka in or around 1992 for construction of Almati
Dam in the State of Karnataka and had also undertaken the work
of development of three small hydro power projects in Karnataka.
After negotiations, the defendant No. 1 had engaged the services of
the plaintiff company for monitoring the development and
construction work of Almati Dam and also to prepare the prefeasibility reports in relation to three small hydro power projects
at a retainership of 2,250 US Dollars per month excluding the
actual expenses to be incurred by the plaintiff on journey from
time to time. The terms and conditions of contract between the

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 2 of 26

parties are contained in the letter of defendant No. 1 dated
14.11.1992 to which schedule of payment was also annexed. The
petitioner was paid Rs.

50,000/- by defendant No. 1 as advance

towards expenses while entering into the consultancy agreement
on 14.11.1992. In terms of letter of appointment dated 14.11.1992,
the appointment of the plaintiff company as 'observer/consultant'
for defendant No. 1 was to be effective from 01.09.1992. Mr. Harry
Davitian and Mr. R.J. Redmore were the President and the Vice
President respectively of defendant No. 1 company at the time of
appointment of the plaintiff as its 'observer'. The case of the
plaintiff is that defendant No. 1 company has not paid any
retainership fee despite various letters/reminders sent to it and
the only payment made by defendant No. 1 company was on
account of actual expenses. The plaintiff company is stated to had
sent its bills to defendant No. 1 from time to time on account of
retainership fee at rates mentioned in the schedule of payment
annexed with the appointment letter dated 14.11.1992. The
plaintiff at last had sent a legal notice dated 07.12.1994 calling
upon defendant No. 1 to pay the arrears of its retainership fee for

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 3 of 26

the period starting from 01.09.1992 amounting to 76,545 US
Dollars. The defendant No. 1 gave reply to this legal notice which

is

dated 06.01.1995. In

admitted

its

liability

its
to

reply
pay

the

the

defendant No. 1

retainership fee and

regretted the delay caused in making the payment to the plaintiff
company. The defendant No. 1 vide its aforementioned reply
informed the plaintiff that it would sort out the matter relating to
payment shortly. The plaintiff gave rejoinder dated 05.02.1995 to
the above reply of defendant No. 1 and made its stand clear to
defendant No. 1. As the amount of retainership fee claimed by the

plaintiff from defendant No. 1 was not paid, the plaintiff has filed
the present suit for recovery against the defendants.
4

The defendants have filed their separate written

statements in the case. Defendants No. 2 and 3 who are alleged
to be the subsidiaries of defendant No. 1 company have denied
their liability to pay the suit amount inter alia on the ground that
there was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and
defendants No. 2 & 3 and on merits they have contended that they

are otherwise not liable to pay any amount to the plaintiff
CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 4 of 26

company because they did not avail any consultancy services from
the plaintiff at any point of time.
5

The defendant No. 1 in its written statement has taken a

two fold defence to the claim of the plaintiff in the present suit.
The first defence of defendant No. 1 is that the terms and
conditions of appointment contained in the appointment letter
dated 14.11.1992 are not binding upon defendant No. 1 company
because Mr. R.J. Redmore who had issued the said appointment
letter was not competent to appoint the plaintiff company as a
'consultant/observer' of defendant No. 1 for its Almati Dam project
in the state of Karnataka. The contention of defendant No. 1 is
that Mr. R.J. Redmore had not got the terms and conditions of
appointment of the plaintiff company approved from the Board of
Directors of defendant No. 1 company. The second defence of
defendant No. 1 to the claim of the plaintiff is that the plaintiff

company did not work in terms of agreement between the parties
and according to defendant No. 1, the plaintiff company at best is
entitled to claim retainership fee only for a period of 7 months
starting from 01.09.1992. The defendant No. 1 has further

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 5 of 26

contended that the plaintiff company did not do any work in
relation to any of the hydro power projects of defendant No. 1 after
February/March, 1993. However, defendant No. 1 has expressed its
willingness to pay a reasonable amount to the plaintiff company
for the period the said company had worked for it.
6

From the pleadings of the parties following issues were

framed by this Court on 23.11.1998:1. Whether there is privity of contract between the
plaintiff and defendants No. 2 & 3. If not, to what
effect?
2. Whether there was a valid agreement between the
plaintiff and the defendants for consultancy to be
provided by the plaintiff to the defendants?
3. Whether the said consultancy agreement was entered
upon by an authorised representative of defendant
No. 1?
4. Whether the plaintiff has rendered service to
defendant No. 1 in terms of the agreement between
the parties. If so, to what effect?
5. To what amount, if any, is the plaintiff entitled and
from which of the defendants?
6. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to interest. If so, at
what rate and for what period?

In evidence the plaintiff company has examined two

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 6 of 26

witnesses and they are PW-1

Cdr. H.S. Gujral, Managing

Director of the plaintiff company and PW-2 K. Venkateshwara
Rao, an official from Karnataka Power Corporation. Defendant
No. 1 has examined its Vice-President Mr. Byran Somervell
Patrick Marra as DW-1. Defendants No. 2 and 3 have not
produced any evidence.
8

I have heard the arguments of Mr. Ashim Vachher,

learned Advocate who appeared for the plaintiff and Mr. Rakesh
Aggarwal, learned Advocate who appeared for defendant No. 1. I
have also perused the entire case file with utmost care. My
findings on the above issues are as follows:ISSUE NO. 1
9

This issue was not pressed by Mr. Vachher appearing

on behalf of the plaintiff. He very fairly conceded during
arguments that there was no privity of contract between the
plaintiff and defendants No. 2 & 3 and therefore he gave up his
claim against these defendants. Hence this issue is decided
against the plaintiff.
ISSUE NO. 2

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

10

In June, 1992 defendant No. 1 had taken a project for

construction of Almati Dam in the state of Karnataka. Defendant
No. 1 is a company incorporated under the American Laws. The
case of the plaintiff company is that defendant No. 1 had
appointed the plaintiff for monitoring the developments of the
Almati Dam project and also for its various hydro power projects
to be set up by it in the State of Karnataka. In July and August,
1992, the plaintiff company is stated to had rendered assistance
and consultancy to defendant No. 1 in connection with setting up
of its hydro power projects in the state of Karnataka. On
28.08.1992, the President of defendant No. 1 company wrote to
the plaintiff company appreciating its services and had proposed
to engage the plaintiff company as its' consultant'. The letter
dated 28.08.1992 written by defendant No. 1 to the plaintiff
company is Ex. P-1. In response to letter dated 28.08.1992 (Ex. P1), the plaintiff company communicated its acceptance to
defendant No. 1 vide its letter dated 04.09.1992 (the date wrongly
mentioned in the letter as 04.08.1992) agreeing to work as a
'consultant' for defendant No. 1 on payment of consultancy fee @

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 8 of 26

US $ 3,000 per month. The letter dated 04.09.1992 written by the
plaintiff company to defendant No. 1 is Ex. PW1/1. Thereafter,
defendant No. 1 company vide its letter dated 14.11.1992 formally
appointed the plaintiff company as its 'observer' for the Almati
Dam construction at a retainership fee mentioned in the schedule
of payment annexed with the said letter. This letter dated
14.11.1992 written by defendant No. 1 to plaintiff company by
which

the

plaintiff

company

was

formally

appointed

as

'consultant' for defendant No. 1 for its Almati Dam project is Ex.
P-2. The schedule of payment is Ex. P-3. The defendant No. 1
admitted the receipt but denied the contents of above referred
documents at the time of admission/denial of documents. The
plaintiff's witness No. 1 Cdr. H.S. Gujral has very categorically
deposed in his testimony that the plaintiff company was
appointed as a 'consultant' by defendant No. 1 for its hydro power
projects in the state of Karnataka and he has tendered all
abovementioned documents Ex.P-1, Ex. P-2, Ex. P-3 and Ex. PW1/1 in his evidence. There is no rebuttal to the contents of these
documents in the cross-examination of this witness. Since

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 9 of 26

defendant No. 1 has admitted the receipt/dispatch of documents
Ex.P-1, Ex. P-2, Ex. P-3 and Ex. PW-1/1 and he has not produced
any evidence to the contrary to disprove the contents of the said
documents, these documents are deemed to have been proved by
the plaintiff. It was held by the Supreme Court in Food

that

when

letters

forming

part

of

chain

of

correspondence and official record tendered in evidence without
objection from opposite party and when receipt of the said letters
is not disputed by other party, such documents have to be taken
as proved and their contents can be read in evidence. A bare
perusal of the above referred documents Ex.P-1, Ex. PW-1/1, Ex.
P-2 and

Ex. P-3 would prove that the plaintiff and defendant

No. 1 had entered into a valid agreement

for providing

consultancy services by the plaintiff to defendant No. 1 in relation
to construction of its Almati Dam Project and other small hydro
power projects in the state of Karnataka. Accordingly this issue is
decided in favour of the plaintiff and against defendant No. 1.

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 10 of 26

ISSUE NO. 3
11

It is not disputed on behalf of defendant No. 1 that Mr.

R.J. Redmore who had issued the letter dated 14.11.1992 ( Ex. P2) appointing the plaintiff company as an 'observer' for defendant
No. 1 in relation to its project for construction of Almati Dam in
the State of Karnataka was its Vice-President at the relevant
time. PW-1 has deposed that he was not aware if the service of
Mr. R.J. Redmore were terminated by defendant No. 1 in March,
1993. As per testimony of Cdr. H.S. Gujral, Mr Redmore
continued to deal with the plaintiff company on behalf of
defendant No. 1 even in 1994.
12

The defendants' witness No. 1 Mr. Byran Somervell

Patrick Marra has deposed in his chief that Mr. Redmore was the
Vice President of defendant No. 1 company in 1992. He has said
that he has found a letter written by Mr. Redmore to Cdr. H.S.
Gurjal in regard to his appointment as 'consultant' for defendant
No. 1 in September, 1992. According to DW-1 Mr Redmore had
no authority to issue the letter dated 14.11.1992 by which the
plaintiff was appointed as observer for projects of defendant No. 1.

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 11 of 26

He has deposed that Mr. Redmore ceased to be the Vice President
of TAPCO in late 1992 or early 1993 but he did not give the exact
date when Mr. Redmore left the defendant No. 1 company.
13

From the above testimony of the parties, it is evident

that Mr. R.J. Redmore was the Vice-President of defendant No. 1
company at the time the plaintiff company was appointed as
'consultant' for defendant No. 1 for its Almati Dam Project in the
state of Karnataka. As per testimony of PW-1 Cdr. H.S. Gurjal,
Mr. Redmore had been dealing with the plaintiff company even in
1994 and there is no evidence to the contrary either in the crossexamination of PW-1 or in the testimony of DW-1. Defendant No.
1 has not produced any evidence to show that Mr. R.J. Redmore
was not authorised to engage the services of plaintiff company in
relation to its Almati Dam Project in the state of Karnataka.
When it is admitted by defendant No. 1 company that Mr. R.J.
Redmore was its Vice-President at the relevant time then I failto
understand how it can be said that he did not have the necessary
authority

to

appoint

the

plaintiff

company

as

a

'consultant/observer' for defendant No. 1 for its Almati Dam

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 12 of 26

Project. Even if what defendant No. 1 has said is believed to be
correct that Mr. Redmore had no authority to appoint the plaintiff
company as its 'consultant/observer', still this contention holds no
water because an outsider like the plaintiff would not know that
Mr. R.J. Redmore did not have the formal approval from the
Board of Directors of defendant No. 1 company to appoint the
plaintiff company as 'observer/consultant' for defendant No. 1.
Once the plaintiff has proved that it was validly appointed by
defendant No. 1 as its 'consultant' for Almati Dam Project then
onus shifted on defendant No. 1 to disprove the same by leading
such evidence as may be available with it. No such evidence has
been produced by defendant No. 1 to show that Mr. R.J. Redmore
did not possess the necessary authority to appoint the plaintiff
company as a 'consultant' for defendant No. 1 for its Almati Dam
Project. I therefore hold that consultancy agreement dated
14.11.1992 was entered upon by an authorised representative of
defendant No. 1. This issue is accordingly decided in favour of the
plaintiff and against defendant No. 1.

The

plaintiff

company

was

appointed

as

'consultant/observer' for defendant No. 1 company for its Almati
Dam Project in the state of Karnataka vide letter dated
14.11.1992 (Ex. P-2). As per terms of the said consultancy
agreement, the responsibilities of plaintiff company as mentioned
the above referred letter were as follows:“Your responsibilities will include detailed
monitoring of the construction of the dam, attendance
at project review meetings and the preparation of
reports for TAPCO on the status of the Dam.

15

You will report the status of the dam
construction, the progress made, the quality of work
undertaken, anticipated completion date and any
scheduled changes or other matters which impact the
projected dam completion date of March 1995. You
will be responsible to report to the project review
meetings which will be held in Bangalore on a regular
basis. As an independent consultant, your view should
be unbiased and should be reported in a clear and
concise format to all the project team members as well
as TAPCO.”
PW-1 Cdr. H.S. Gujral has deposed in his chief that

consequent upon the appointment of the plaintiff as 'observer'
for defendant No. 1 in relation to its Almati Dam Project in the
state of Karnataka, the plaintiff company started its work of
reviewing

the construction of the Almati Dam. They used to

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 14 of 26

attend the project review meetings with the Government of
Karnataka on the basis of a letter of authorisation issued by
defendant No. 1. The plaintiff company also gave reports
regarding the construction of Dam to defendant No. 1 and it had
also submitted appreciation reports for three small hydro power
projects and pre-feasibility report in respect of one of them. PW-1
has further deposed in his testimony that the plaintiff company
had worked for defendant No. 1 till the beginning of 1995 and till
that time PW-1 had attended many meetings

with the

Government Officials along with the defendants. In crossexamination PW-1 has testified that he had visited the Almati
Dam site in January/ February, 1993 and had not visited the site
of the dam after January/February, 1993 because the defendants
had instructed him not to make too many visits at the site so as to
minimize the expenses. He however had been attending meetings
in Delhi and Bangalore along with the officials of the defendant
No. 1. He further denied the suggestion that after March, 1993
PW-1 did not render any services to the defendants.
16

PW-2 K. Venkatashwara Rao is an official from

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 15 of 26

Karnataka Power Corporation. PW-2 Rao has proved the letter
dated 21.02.1994 addressed by Karnataka Power Corporation to
PW-1 Cdr. H.S. Gujral. The letter dated 21.02.1994 written by
Karnataka Power Corporation to PW-1 Gujral was in relation to a
meeting held in Bangalore on 10.01.1994 which was also attended
by the representative of defendant No. 1. The said letter dated
21.02.1994 proved by PW-2 is Ex. PW-2/A. PW-2 Mr. Rao has also
proved the minutes of the meeting annexed with the letter Ex.
PW-2/A and the photocopy of the minutes of the meeting running
into 6 pages proved by PW-2 is Ex. PW-2/B. There is nothing in
the cross-examination of this witness to have a doubt on his
credence. PW-2 is an official witness and there is no reason to
doubt his testimony. This witness has proved that PW-1 Cdr. H.S.
Gujral, Managing Director of the plaintiff company had attended
a meeting in Bangalore on 10.01.1994 in relation to hydro power
project as 'observer' of defendant No. 1. PW-2, however, did not
know whether Mr. K.M. Shetty representative of defendant No. 1
was also present in the said meeting.
17

Besides the above oral testimony of the parties on

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 16 of 26

record, the plaintiff has also produced correspondence that was
exchanged between the parties from time to time on the subject
and the said correspondence tendered in the testimony of PW-1 is
in the form of reminders Ex. PW-1/2 to Ex. PW-1/5. The receipt of
these reminder letters, sent by the plaintiff company to defendant
No. 1, has been admitted by defendant No. 1 during trial of this
case. Defendant No. 1 has not produced any evidence to contradict
the contents of the said documents and hence the documents Ex.
PW-1/2 to Ex. PW-1/5 are taken as proved documents. Admittedly
defendant No. 1 did not give any reply to any of the above
referred letters and silence on behalf of defendant No. 1 clearly
shows that defendant No. 1 had impliedly admitted that the
plaintiff company had rendered services to defendant No. 1 in
terms of the agreement between the parties. Accordingly this
issue is decided in favour of the plaintiff and against defendant
No. 1.
ISSUE NO. 5
18

The plaintiff company has successfully proved that it

was appointed as a 'consultant/observer' by defendant No. 1 for its

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 17 of 26

Almati Dam Project in the state of Karnataka. The terms and
conditions on which his appointment was made are contained in
letter dated 14.11.1992 (Ex-P-2). The appointment of the plaintiff
company was to take effect from 01.09.1992. The consultancy
charges payable to the plaintiff company for the services rendered
by it to defendant No. 1 from time to time were mentioned in the
schedule of payment (Ex.P-3) annexed with the letter of
appointment dated 14.11.1992. A reference to the schedule of
payment (Ex. P-3) would show that defendant No. 1 company had
agreed to pay monthly retainership fee to the plaintiff company @
2,250 US Dollars besides reimbursement of actual expenses to be
incurred on travel and lodging etc. There is no dispute between
the parties that defendant No. 1 company has not paid any
retainership fee to the plaintiff company ever since the date of
availing its services till the time the plaintiff company had
worked for defendant No. 1 company. Defendant No. 1 company
had reimbursed only actual expenses incurred by the plaintiff
company from time to time.
19

The question that now arise for consideration is that

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 18 of 26

till what time the plaintiff company had worked for defendant No.
1 in order to decide his entitlement to claim retainership fee from
defendant No. 1. The plaintiff has claimed arrears of retainership
fee from defendant No. 1 from September, 1992 to July, 1995.
Defendant No. 1 in its written statement has taken a stand that
the plaintiff company at best is entitled to claim retainership fee
only for the period till February/March, 1993. PW-1 Cdr. H.S.
Gujral has deposed in his testimony before the Court that the
plaintiff company had worked for defendant No. 1 company till
the beginning of 1995. He has not specified the exact period up to
which the plaintiff company had worked for defendant No. 1. In
order to get the date up to which the plaintiff company may be
held entitled to recover retainership fee from defendant No. 1, one
may have to look only on the correspondence that exchanged
between the parties during the currency of the contract. The
plaintiff company had sent various reminders to defendant No. 1
company from time to time and these reminders are Ex. PW-1/2
to Ex. PW-1/5. A perusal of Ex. PW-1/5, receipt of which was
admitted on behalf of defendant No. 1,

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

would show that the

Page 19 of 26

plaintiff company had claimed retainership fee from defendant
No. 1 company @ 2,250 US Dollars for the period up to
31.10.1994. Defendant No. 1 company did not refute the claim of
the plaintiff company contained in the said letter Ex. PW-1/5.
Since the retainership fee claimed by the plaintiff company vide
its letter Ex.PW-1/5 dated 05.11.1994 was not paid by defendant
No. 1 company, the plaintiff company sent a legal notice dated
07.12.1994 (Ex. PW-1/6) to defendant No. 1 company in which it
included claim for retainership fee for two more months i.e. for
November & December, 1994 and made a total claim of 76,545 US
Dollars towards its retainership fee from defendant No. 1 till the
date of sending of the said notice. In the said legal notice Ex. PW1/6, the plaintiff had also detailed out the various works it had
done for defendant No. 1 from time to time. Defendant No. 1 for
the first time broke its silence and send a reply dated 06.01.1995
to the aforementioned legal notice. The said reply of defendant
No. 1 is Ex. P-4 which reads as under:January 6, 1995

that it had worked for defendant No. 1 till at least up to
December, 1994. It is generally believed that a man can lie but
not the circumstances. From the oral and documentary evidence
produced by the parties on record, this Court is convinced that the
plaintiff company had worked for defendant No. 1 company as its
'observer/consultant' at least up to December, 1994 and therefore
the plaintiff company is held entitled to recover retainership fee @
2,250 US Dollars per month from defendant No. 1 company for a
total period of 28 months starting from 01.09.1992 till 31.12.1994.
The entitlement of the plaintiff on account of retainership fee
calculated @ 2,250 US Dollars for a period of 28 months comes to
63,000 US Dollars equivalent to Rs. 19,65,600/- applying the
conversion rate of Rs. 31.20 paise per US $ at the time of
institution of suit filed in the year 1995. This issue is accordingly
decided in favour of the plaintiff and against defendant No. 1.
ISSUE NO. 6
22

The plaintiff has claimed interest on the arrears of

CS (OS)No. 1937/1995

Page 24 of 26

retainership fee @ 2% per month agreed to be paid by defendant
No. 1 at the time of entering into the consultancy agreement vide
letter Ex. P-2 dated 14.11.1992. The interest claimed @ 2% per
month appears to be on higher side and considering the facts and
circumstances of the case, this Court is of the view that the
interest of justice shall be adequately met by awarding the
interest on the arrears of retainership fee @ 12% per annum
simple instead of 2 % per month claimed in the suit. This issue is
also decided accordingly in favour of the plaintiff and against
defendant No. 1.
RELIEF
23

In view of my findings on the above issues, a decree of

Rs. 19,65,600/- with proportionate costs and interest @ 12% per
annum to be worked for the period from 01.01.1995 onwards till
realisation is hereby passed in favour of the plaintiff and against
defendant No. 1. The suit of the plaintiff against defendants No. 2
& 3 is dismissed as not pressed. Decree sheet be prepared
accordingly.
