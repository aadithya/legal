The petitioner was employed with the respondent and he was

served a chargesheet on account of availing 54 days leave without pay
during the period 1st January, 1985 to 31st July, 1985 which
according to the respondent reflected lack of interest in the
Corporation work and in the performance of his duty. Pursuant to the
chargesheet issued to the workman an enquiry was conducted and he
was terminated with effect from 30th October, 1987. An appeal filed by
the petitioner was also dismissed. Thereafter the petitioner raised the
industrial dispute regarding his termination of service and an award
dated 11th September, 2002 reinstating the workman was passed.

3.

Against the award dated 11th September, 2002 a writ petition

being W.P(C) No.5703/2003 was filed where the award dated 11th
September, 2002 was set aside and the matter was remanded back to
the Labour Court for fresh adjudication.

4.

By the award dated 20th December, 2006 the following reference

has been decided again.
“Whether the removal from services of Shri Ram Pal is
illegal and/or unjustified and if so, to what relief is he
entitled and what directions are necessary in this
respect?”

The Labor Court has held by award dated 20th December, 2006

that the petitioner is entitled for reinstatement, however, in the
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case it is further held that it
will not be judicious and prudent to award the workman full back
wages and, therefore, following the golden rule the petitioner has been
awarded 50% of the back wages.

6.

The petitioner has challenging the award of 50% of the back

wages only and not the full back wages on the ground that his
services were terminated in an illegal and unlawful manner and on the
ground that the petitioner remained unemployed and could not find
any other alternative job inspite of his best efforts.

7.

The Labour Court has considered the ratio of G.T.Lad Vs.

Chemicals Fibres of India Ltd, 1979 (38) 95 SC= (1979) 1 SCC 590.
The Labour Court has considered the probability that the petitioner is
a technical person and in order to sustain himself he must have been
doing in all probabilities odd jobs. The fact that the petitioner
remained absent for 29 days was also considered by the Labour Court
in awarding only 50% of the back wages.

A division bench of this Court in 2006 IV AD (DELHI) 739 (DB);

Lords Homeopathic Laboratories Private Ltd. Vs Ms. Lissi Unnikunju
& ors had held that the discretion exercised by the Labor Court in
awarding compensation should not ordinarily be interfered with. The
Court had held as under:
21. We are of the opinion that the learned Single Judge
in writ jurisdiction should not have interfered with the
discretion of the Labour Court on the facts of the case.

9.

The inference of the Labour Court in awarding 50% of the back

wages is based on the cogent reason and the law laid down by the
Apex Court. The Labor Court being the final court of facts, therefore,
the superior Courts do not normally interfere with the findings of
facts. In Allahabad Jal Sansthan v. Daya Shankar Rai,(2005) 5 SCC
124, at page 127 :
“6. A law in absolute terms cannot be laid down as to in
which cases, and under what circumstances, full back
wages can be granted or denied. The Labour Court and/or
Industrial Tribunal before which industrial dispute has
been raised, would be entitled to grant the relief having
regard to the facts and circumstances of each case. For
the said purpose, several factors are required to be taken
into consideration.

In the same case the Supreme Court had also held that an
industry cannot be compelled to pay the workman for a period during
which he apparently contributed little or nothing at all and the period

which was spent unproductively. The Supreme Court had held as
under:
16. We have referred to certain decisions of this Court to
highlight that earlier in the event of an order of dismissal
being set aside, reinstatement with full back wages was
the usual result. But now with the passage of time, it has
come to be realised that industry is being compelled to
pay the workman for a period during which he apparently
contributed little or nothing at all, for a period that was
spent unproductively, while the workman is being
compelled to go back to a situation which prevailed many
years ago when he was dismissed. It is necessary for us to
develop a pragmatic approach to problems dogging
industrial relations. However, no just solution can be
offered but the golden mean may be arrived at.”
In P.G.I. of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh v. Raj
Kumar (2001) 2 SCC 54 this Court found fault with the High Court in
setting aside the award of the Labour Court which restricted the back
wages to 60% and directing payment of full back wages. It was
observed thus: (SCC p. 57, para 9)
“9. The Labour Court being the final court of facts came to
a conclusion that payment of 60% wages would comply
with the requirement of law. The finding of perversity or
being erroneous or not in accordance with law shall have
to be recorded with reasons in order to assail the finding
of the Tribunal or the Labour Court. It is not for the High
Court to go into the factual aspects of the matter and
there is an existing limitation on the High Court to that
effect.”

Factors which would be considered by the court while awarding

back wages would include the time involved in the litigation and
causes of the delay; the status of the management as a public body
meant for public benefit; possibility of the worker being gainfully
implied; nature of the alleged misconduct; ensuing financial burden;
delay in raising an industrial dispute; duration of the employment and
the nature of the employment. Labor Court has granted 50% of back
wages after considering these factors. No manifest error has been
pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioner except that the
termination of the petitioner was illegal. There is no perversity in the
award dated 20th December, 2006 awarding only 50% of the back
wages and this Court will not be justified in interfering with the same
in the present facts and circumstances of the case.

11.

In the circumstances there are no grounds to interfere under

Article 226 of the Constitution of India and the writ petition is,
therefore, dismissed.
