Agreement to Sale dated 15th February, 2005 with deceased
Ombir

Singh

in

respect

of

residential

plot

No.AG-36,

Shalimar Bagh, Delhi, measuring 263.25 sq. mtrs. which
deceased

Ombir

Singh

had

purchased

from

Delhi

Development Authority vide Perpetual Lease Deed dated 24th
July, 1997 which was duly registered with the Sub-RegistrarVI, Delhi. Petitioners were handed over physical possession
of the said property by deceased Ombir Singh after receiving
total sale consideration of Rs.30,00,000/- and the impugned
Agreement to Sell dated 15th February, 2005 was executed
inter se the parties.

4.

Certain disputes arose inter se the petitioners and

the seller Ombir Singh now being represented by his legal
heirs/respondents regarding enforcement of the Agreement
to Sell. Ombir Singh died on 26th May, 2006.

5.

The Agreement to Sell contained an arbitration

clause i.e. Clause 14 which reads as follows:-

“14. That in case any dispute
arises between parties hereto, or their
agents,
representatives,
nominees,
assigns as regard the meaning and
effect of this agreement or clauses or
any other matter not specifically
mentioned herein above, the same shall
be referred to Arbitration, as provided
Arb. P. No.27/2007

under the Indian Arbitration Act, then in
force”.
6.

Since the dispute arose inter se the parties, petitioners

served notice dated 19th October, 2006 upon the respondents,
namely, legal heirs of deceased Ombir Singh invoking clause
14 of the Agreement to Sell dated 15th February, 2005 and
called upon them to submit to Arbitration the disputes which
have arisen between the parties.

7.

However, in this notice, petitioners appointed

Shri Debashish Moitra, Advocate having office at E-529,
Greater Kailash-II, New Delhi-110048 as the sole arbitrator in
the matter and requested respondents to agree to the
appointment of the said arbitrator within the statutory period
of 30 days.

This notice was duly delivered to all the

respondents as per the registered AD cards filed on the
record.

Respondents have failed to invoke the arbitration

clause even after receipt of the notice as requested and
appoint an arbitrator or agree to the appointment of Shri
Debashish Moitra, Advocate as named by the petitioners.

8.

The arbitration agreement is silent as to how an

arbitrator has to be appointed. It means that arbitrator has
to be appointed with the consensus of both the parties.

There is a subsisting dispute referable to

arbitration within the meaning of arbitration agreement. The
court has to be satisfied of the existence of the conditions for
the exercise of its power that arbitrator so appointed should
be qualified arbitrator who would put to an end the disputes
between the parties. The appointment of an arbitrator by the
court in terms of section 11 (6) of the Act is based on the
power so vested in the court from the statute which itself
prescribe the conditions which stands exist to exercise that
power and such a power is exercised by the court in its
judicial authority.

10.

The prayer of the petitioners in the petition is that

the court may appoint an arbitrator in terms of Agreement
dated 15th February, 2005 to adjudicate upon the disputes
between the petitioners and the respondents No.1 to 6.
Petitioners have not insisted upon the appointment of Shri
Debashish Moitra, Advocate as the arbitrator in the present
petition.

Therefore, I hereby appoint Ms.Sunita Harish,

Advocate, Chamber No.243, Lawyers Chamber, Delhi High
Court, New Delhi as the sole arbitrator in this case. Fee of
the arbitrator is fixed at Rs.20,000/- per hearing to be paid by
the petitioners. However, arbitrator shall be entitled to claim

Copy of the order be given DASTI as well.
