GITA MITTAL, J.
1.

By this judgment I propose to dispose of CS(OS) No.

2716A/1993 and I.A. No. 7365/1995. There is no dispute to the
dates and events in this matter. The parties are at variance only on
the construction to be put thereon.
2.

It appears that M/s. Modi Distillery was awarded a contract

for supply of country liquor to the Delhi Administration for the

CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 1 of 29

year 1986-87 under licences issued to it in Form L-9 and CLW-1. It
was also a licensee for the preceding year 1985-86. The petitioner
has pointed out that such licences were awarded pursuant to
exercise of the statutory powers under the Delhi Excise Act and the
rules and regulations framed thereunder. The general and special
condition for the supply stipulated that the statutory rules and
regulations would govern the supplies made by the licensees.
3.

There is no dispute that the power to vary the supply of the

liquor was statutorily vested in the Lt. Governor and the
Commissioner (Excise) under the provisions of the Delhi Excise
Act.

The licence was awarded to the petitioner on the 10 th

December, 1986 which inter alia contained the following
stipulations:“1. The agreement shall commence on 1st
May, 1986 and shall be for a period of 11
months i.e. upto 31st March, 1987.
xxx xxx
17. The Licensee shall keep a minimum stock
of 15 truck loads country liquor at a time at the
bonded warehouse. Initially, the Licensee shall
build up the stock within 15 days of the grant of
the licence.”

The instant case is concerned with the rates for the supply of

CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 2 of 29

certain quantities of liquor by the petitioner in April and May
1987. So far as the rates are concerned, the licence contains the
following stipulations with regard to the rates at which the
petitioner would be paid:“3. That the Lt. Governor, Delhi has accepted
the tendered rates for the wholesale supply of
country liquor, to the country liquor vends for
the year 1986-87 (upto 31st March, 1987) at the
uniform rate of Rs.69/- per quarts per dozen
and Rs.42.30 for pints per dozen on the usual
terms and conditions and subject to further
conditions that a provision as contained in
Section 64-A of sale of Goods Act, 1930 may be
made which is reproduced below:In contracts of sale, amount of increased
or decreased taxes to be added or deducted (1)
unless a different intention appears from the
terms of the contract in the event of any tax of
the nature described in sub-section (2) being
imposed, increased, decreased or remitted in
respect of any goods after the making of any
contract for the sale or purchase of such goods
without stipulations to the payment of tax where
tax was not chargeable at the time of the making
of the contract, or for the sale or purchase of
such goods tax-paid where tax was chargeable at
the time;
(a) if such imposition or increase so
takes effect that the tax or increased tax, as the
case may be, or any part of such tax is paid or is
payable, the seller may add so much to the
contract price as will be equivalent to the
amount paid or payable in respect of such tax or
increase of tax and he shall be entitled to be paid
and to sue for and recover such additions, and
(b) if such decrease or remission so
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 3 of 29

takes effect that the decreased tax only, or no
tax, as the case may be, is paid or is payable, the
buyer may deduct so much from the contract
price as will be equivalent to the decrease of tax,
or remitted tax, and he shall not be liable to pay,
or be sued for, or in respect of such deduction.
(2) The provisions of sub-section (1)
apply to the following taxes namely ;
(a) any duty or customs or excise on
goods.
(b) any tax on the sale or purchase of
goods.”
4.

As per the agreement between the parties, the petitioner was

required to make available quantities of liquor from its distillery
that is Modi Nagar to the bonded warehouse under a bond as
provided under Section 6 of the Punjab Excise Act, 1914. The issue
of country liquor from the bonded warehouse was regulated and
controlled by the Government from time to time. The agreement
contained specific provisions whereby the Government reserved
the right to reduce or cancel the licences of the liquor of licensees
as the petitioner. So far as the lapsing of any allotment of liquor
was concerned, the licence agreement provided thus:“PROVIDED further that if any allotment of
alcohol made in favour of any licencee lapses due
to the reasons within the control of such licences,
he will be liable to pay the damages to the extent
of loss of the excise revenue which would
otherwise have been realised if such quantity
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 4 of 29

5.

would have been imported into Delhi.”
It is an admitted position that the liquor could enter Delhi

only under specific permits issued by the respondents.

The

licensee was required to operate a bonded warehouse in
accordance with Delhi Country Liquor Bonded Warehouse Rules
at his own expenses. The licensee was also required to abide by
the Punjab Excise Act, 1914 and the Delhi Liquor Licence Rules,
1976 which were in vogue at the relevant time.
6.

So far as the redressal of disputes was concerned, the

agreement between the parties contained the following arbitration
clause:“33. All disputes and differences arising out of or
in any way touching or concerning this amount
(except those the decision where is otherwise
hereinafter provided for) shall be referred to the
sole arbitration of any person nominated by the
Lt. Governor of the Union Territory of Delhi or in
case his designation is changed or his office is
abolished, to the sole arbitration of any person
nominated by the officer who, for the time being
is entrusted, whether or not in addition to other
functions, with the functions of the Lt. Governor
of the Union territory or Delhi by whatever
designation such officer may be called. It will be
no objection to any such appointment that the
arbitrator so appointed is a Government servant,
that he had to deal with the matter to which this
indenture relates and that in course of his duties
as such government servant he had expressed
views on all or any of the matter is dispute or
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 5 of 29

7.

difference.
The award of the arbitrator so
appointed shall be final and binding on the
parties.”
The petitioner has submitted that the contract rates for

liquor for the year 1985-86 were Rs. 60/- per dozen quarts and Rs.
38/- per dozen pints as compared to the rates being Rs. 83.49/per dozen quarts and Rs. 49.54/- per dozen pints for the year
1986-87.
8.

The original supply rates, as per the agreement, were Rs.

69/- per dozen quarts and Rs. 42.30/- per dozen pints which were
enhanced to Rs. 83.49/- and Rs. 49.54/- per dozen respectively in
consequence of increase in the export duty by the Exporting U.P.
State Government. As the new contracts for the supply of country
liquor for the year 1987-88 could not be finalised in time, the
Excise Authorities were apprehensive that it would not be possible
to get the supply of country liquor from new licensees (CLW-1 and
L-9) for a considerable time beyond 31st March, 1987. It has been
pointed out that shortage in liquor supply leads to a spurt of
spurious, illicit and the problem of boot-legging which results in
dangerous consequences in terms of loss of life etc.

The

authorities treat maintenance of liquor supplies as imperative.
For this reason, before the expiry of such licence with it, the
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 6 of 29

petitioner was approached by the respondents and asked to
continue the supply from the bonded warehouse even in April and
May, 1987 to maintain the supply line.
9.

In

this

behalf,

the

petitioner

has

pointed

out

its

communication dated 23rd March, 1987 whereby it had agreed to
supply fifteen trucks of country liquor upto 31st March, 1987 to the
Delhi State on the 'same terms and conditions'.

This

communication was placed before the arbitrator as Annexure 'E' to
the statement of claims filed by the petitioner. Pursuant to this
communication

of

the

petitioner,

communications

were

addressed by the Commissioner of Excise, Delhi on the 23rd
March, 1987 to the Excise Commissioner, Allahabad, U.P.
requesting it to release 81000 bulk litres of country liquor from
the distillery of the petitioner upto 31st March, 1987. Based on this
communication,

the

petitioner

requested

the

Excise

Commissioner, Allahabad, U.P. to issue the necessary release
order for such quantity of liquor from the distillery of the
petitioner in U.P. for transportation from U.P. to Delhi.

Release

order was also issued by the respondent to the petitioner.
10.

Admittedly, the respondent issued 15 import permits

CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 7 of 29

numbering 1868 to 1882 dated 24th March, 1987 valid upto 31st
March, 1987 for 5400 bulk litres (600 dozen quarts) to the
petitioner on the basis of which it imported to its warehouse, 15
consignments of country liquor from 27th March, 1987 to 31st
March, 1987.
It is this stock which was so issued from the bonded
warehouse of the petitioner to the retail vends of the respondents
as per their demand between the period 1st April, 1987 to 8th May,
1987 against the indents placed by the respondent through its
excise staff posted at the warehouse on the petitioner.

The

petitioner has contended that it had indented the liquor pursuant
to its letter dated 23rd March, 1987 prior to the expiry of the licence
on the same terms and conditions.
11.

The dispute arose between the parties when the petitioner

raised bills for its supply of this liquor at the contract rates of
1986-87 in terms of the licence dated 10th December, 1986 and
also tendered consolidated periodical bills to the Excise
Department, that is the respondent, for payment. Such bills were
duly certified by the respondent's representatives, namely
Inspector of Excise who had been posted in the warehouse. The

CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 8 of 29

petitioner claimed a sum of Rs. 16,67,752.28/- for payment from
the respondent on account of the liquor which had been supplied
between the period from 3rd April, 1987 to 8th May, 1987.
However, instead of making payment at the rates prevalent for the
period 1986-87, the respondents effected payments at the rates
which were in vogue for the year 1985-86. As a result, a sum of
Rs. 3,05,816.28/- remained outstanding from the respondent in
respect of the supplies made by the petitioner. The petitioner
consequently raised a dispute and sought reference thereof for
arbitration in terms of the clause 33 of the agreement.
12.

As no action was taken, the petitioner was constrained to file

the petition under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940.
During the pendency of the petition which was filed before
this court, the Lt. Governor of Delhi issued an order dated 4 th
January, 1990 which was in the following terms:“M/s Modi Distillary(A Unit of Modi
Industries Limited), Modi Nagar, District
Gaziabad, U.P. Were granted licences in form
L-9 and C.L.W-1 for the wholesale supply of
country liquor to retail sale government run
country liquor - cum - bear vends in the Union
Territory of Delhi for the year 1986-87. The
licencing period was extended beyond 31-3-87
on the excise policy for the year 1987-88 was
not formulated before the close of the licencing
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 9 of 29

period. The licensee agreed to supply country
liquor on the rates approved for the year 198687. Such rates were paid to the licensee till the
extended period i.e. 30-4-1987 but for the left
over stock as on 30-4-1987, the ex-licensee was
paid the rates approved for the year 1987-88
which were less than the rates approved for the
year 1986-87. the licensee contends that for
the supplies made from 1-5-1987 to 8-5-1987,
he should be the same rates as approved for the
year 1986-87.
As per clause 33 of the agreement, all
disputes and differences arising out of or in any
way touching or concerning the agreement
(except those the decision whereas otherwise
herein provided for) shall be referred to the
sole arbitration of any person nominated by the
Lt. Governor.
The Hon'ble Lt. Governor, Delhi is
pleased to appoint Mrs. B. Prasad, Director,
Technical Education, Delhi as an arbitrator in
the said case. The dispute is being referred to
Mrs. B. Prasad for arbitration. She is requested
to initiate arbitration proceedings and
announce the award.
General Manager (Excise) shall represent
Excise Department before the 'Arbitrator'.”
13.

Initially, Smt. B. Prasad, who was appointed as arbitrator

could not complete the proceedings before the expiry of her term.
Thereafter, Mr. A.K. Mathur who was appointed as an arbitrator,
was posted abroad and could not complete the proceedings.
Finally, by an order dated 22nd June, 1993, the Lt. Governor of
Delhi appointed Shri Madan Jha as an arbitrator.
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 10 of 29

These two

orders appointing the arbitrators were in identical terms as the
order dated 4th January, 1990.
14.

After a detailed consideration of the matter, the pleadings

and the record, the arbitrator made and published an award dated
18th October, 1993 holding that the petitioner had made the
supplies in terms of the licence which was granted to it and further
supplies which were made between the period 1st April, 1987 to 8th
May, 1987. The petitioner was held entitled to the rates for the
year 1986-87. Consequently, the arbitrator awarded a sum of Rs.
3,05,816.28/- with interest at the rate of 18% per annum.
15.

The petitioner filed a petition under Sections 14 and 17 of the

Arbitration Act, 1940 seeking a direction to the arbitrator to file
his award in this court. As a result of the direction issued by this
court, the award was filed by the arbitrator in this court. This
petition has been registered as Suit No. 2716A/1993.
The respondents filed objections to the award on 15th
February, 1995 under Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act,
1940 which were registered as I.A. No. 7365/1995.
16.

On the 21st March, 1996, the following issues were framed in

the matter:-

CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 11 of 29

“21.3.1996
Present: Mr. N.K. Khetrapal for plaintiff
Mr. Sanjay Poddar for defendant
S. 2716A/1993 & I.A. No. 7365/1995
....The following issues are framed:1. Is the suit maintainable in view of noncompliance of provisions of Section 52 of
the Government of National Capital
Territory of Delhi Act, 1991?
OPP
2. Are the objections filed by the respondent
against the award within time? OPD
3. Whether the award is liable to be set aside
in view of the objections filed by the
respondent?
OPD
4. Relief.”
17.

It is noteworthy that the notice of the filing of the award was

served on the respondent nos. 1 to 3 on 17th May, 1994.

No

objections were filed by the respondents within the statutory
period of thirty days.

On the 24th September, 2001, the

respondents contended that while the limitation of 30 days would
apply in relation to objections under Section 30 of the Arbitration
Act, however, the objections under Section 33 of the Arbitration
Act cannot be contended to be not maintainable on the ground of
the same being barred by limitation. Reliance was placed on the
pronouncement reported in AIR 1968 Del 21 Prem Sagar
Chawla s/o Tara Chand Vs. M/s Security & Finance (P)

CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 12 of 29

Ltd. & Anr.
18.

Accordingly, on the 24th September, 2001, the objections of

the respondent under Section 30 of the Arbitration Act were
dismissed as barred by time

However, the objections under

Section 33 of the Arbitration Act survive for consideration.
It would be useful to consider the provisions of Section 33 of
the Arbitration Act, 1940 which reads thus :“33. Arbitration agreement or award to be
contested by application – Any party to an
arbitration agreement or any person claiming
under him desiring to challenge the existence or
validity of an arbitration agreement or an award
or to have the effect of either determined shall
apply to the Court and the Court shall decide the
question on affidavits.”
19.

The objections of the respondents which survive for

consideration relate to the objection as to the existence of the
arbitration agreement.

In this behalf, the respondents have

contended that the licence granted to the petitioner by the
competent authority came to an end on 31st March, 1987. The
arbitration clause was contained in such licence deed dated 10th
December, 1986 which could not therefore be contended to subsist
after that. The supplies relate to the period between 1st April, 1987
and 31st May, 1987. The respondents have contended that there
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 13 of 29

was no arbitration agreement between the parties after 31st March,
1987 in relation to such supplies beyond the licence period.
20.

It has further been contended that extension of the licence

could have been done only by the Lt. Governor of Delhi who is the
competent authority under the provisions of Delhi Liquor Licence
Rules, 1976 and there was no document granting extension of the
licence after expiry of the original licence period. On these pleas,
it is urged that there being no arbitration agreement, the reference
of the dispute to the arbitration was void ab initio and
consequently, the award made by the learned arbitrator was also
invalid and cannot be enforced.
21.

I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and

also perused the available record. From the consideration of the
same, the following undisputed facts emerge:(i). The petitioner was validly appointed a licensee and a licence
deed dated 10th December, 1986 was executed in this behalf.
(ii). During the currency of the licence, the petitioner was asked to
provide an increased supply of liquor in respect of which the
Excise Commissioner of Delhi addressed a communication to the
Excise Commissioner, Allahabad, U.P. to enhance the quantity
that is 81000 bulk litres of country liquor from the distillery of the
petitioner upto 31st March, 1987.
(iii). The respondents issued import permits to the petitioner in
respect of this enhanced supply during the currency of the licence
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 14 of 29

and the petitioner imported this indented liquor into the bonded
warehouse in Delhi pursuant to such import licence prior to the
expiry of the licence period.
(iv). The petitioner addressed a communication dated 23rd
March, 1987 to the Excise Commissioner, Delhi which agreed to
enhance supply of liquor to the Delhi State on the same terms and
conditions as were subsisting on that date.
(v). The terms and conditions on which the liquor was being
indented and imported into Delhi by the petitioner were those as
were stipulated in the licence deed dated 10th December, 1986.
This deed also provides that the rates of 1986-87 would apply to
such supplies.

22.

As noticed above, the Lt. Governor of Delhi issued orders

appointing the arbitrator. These orders which were passed by the
competent authority were communicated under the signatures of
the Commissioner cum Special Secretary (Excise), the Lt.
Governor has noticed that the petitioner M/s Modi Distillery were
granted licence for the wholesale supply of country liquor to retail
government run country liquor cum beer vends in Delhi for the
year 1986-87. The orders record that the licensing period was
extended beyond the 31st March, 1987 as the excise policy for the
year 1987-88 was not formulated before the close of the licensing
period.
The order also records that disputes and differences arising
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 15 of 29

out of or in any way touching or concerning the agreement as per
clause 33 shall be referred to the sole arbitration of any person
nominated by the Lt. Governor.
23.

These facts were again repeated in the order which was

issued on behalf of the Lt. Governor in 1991 when Shri A.K.
Mathur was appointed as the sole arbitrator. Similarly, the order
passed by the Lt. Governor of Delhi on 26th May, 1993 also records
the fact that the licence of the petitioner was extended. The Lt.
Governor has also effected appointment of Shri Madan Jha as the
sole arbitrator under clause 33 of the agreement.
According to the respondents as per the Delhi Excise Rules,
it is only the Lt. Governor of Delhi who is the competent authority
who can extend the term of licence or requiring additional
supplies to be made.
Consequently, objection would have been taken to the
maintainability of the claims of the petitioner when there was
application of mind before passing of the above orders, if the
contention of the respondent was correct. This was not so.
24.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has pointed out from the

record of the arbitration that on receipt of the order dated 19th

CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 16 of 29

May, 1993 of the Lt. Governor, Shri Madan Jha, the sole arbitrator
had addressed a communication dated 24th May, 1993 seeking
clarifications from the Excise Commissioner.

It has been

contended that the order of the Lt. Governor appointing Shri
Madan Jha as arbitrator was signed by the Lt. Governor on the 12th
April, 1993 after application of mind to the matter.

The

appointment of Shri Madan Jha as a sole arbitrator was confirmed
by another communication dated 22nd June, 1993.
25.

The respondents had also filed an application dated 5th

August, 1993 whereby only two issues were proposed on behalf of
the respondents which were to the following effect:“i) Whether the licence of the claimant was
extended for the year 1987-88.
ii)
Whether any wholesale supply permit was
issued to the claimant after 31-3-1987.”
26.

From the perusal of the above, it is apparent that the

supplies were made by the petitioner with the implicit consent of
the Commissioner, Excise Delhi and the Lt. Governor.

All

concerned authorities had treated the import of the additional
liquor which was effected before 31st March, 1987 to be on the
same terms and conditions as were invoked under the licence

CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 17 of 29

dated 10th December, 1986. The supplies made by the petitioner
are relatable to the same contract. The imports were made on the
same terms under similar import licences and release order and
secured in the bonded warehouse in respect of the supplies which
were effected by the petitioner prior thereto.
27.

The parties treated the disputes as if they were referable to

arbitration under clause 33 of the licence deed. The order of Lt.
Governor was issued after application of mind. Each time the
orders of appointment were issued on 4-1-90, the second date
being illegible and on 22-6-93, the competent authority had
clearly noted that the licence was extended. The placing of the
order for this liquor in terms of the licence deed thus stood ratified
by the competent authority. This is amply borne out from the fact
that no objection as to the existence of the arbitration agreement
was taken by the respondent either in the reply to the petitioner
under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 or in the reply to the
claims raised by the petitioner before the arbitrator.
28.

The petitioner has effected all imports prior to the expiry of

the licence on import permits issued by the respondents in
pursuance of the communication dated 23rd March, 1987. The

CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 18 of 29

Excise Commissioner had addressed a communication to the
authorities in U.P. to permit release of the liquor of the petitioner
and its import to Delhi.
29.

In the light of the above, the respondent is bound by its

conduct in raising no objection when the petitioner addressed the
communication dated 23rd March, 1987 and in fact having acted
pursuant thereto. The import permits and release orders have
been issued thereafter by the respondents to the petitioner who
has been permitted to import and indent liquor into Delhi.
30.

There is yet another circumstance pointed out by Ms.

Bagchi, learned counsel for the petitioner which completely belies
the position taken by the respondent.
So far as fixation of price is concerned, the respondent has in
its rejoinder in para 10 has stated thus:“10. That the contents of para 10 of
reply on merits are wrong and denied and the
contents of para 10 of the objections are
reiterated.
It is reiterated that the
respondents
did
not
extend
the
licence/agreement of the petitioner. It is
reiterated that after 31-3-1987, the petitioner
kept on supplying on its own the country
made liquor to various outlets of the
respondents with a view to dispose of its left
over stock. It is denied that the findings of the
arbitrator do not suffer from any infirmity or
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 19 of 29

that the same are final or binding upon the
parties. The respondents had demonstrated
in its objections that the findings of the
arbitrator are wrong and suffer from
infirmities, apparent on the face of the record.
The plea regarding the present objections
being time barred is misconceived and has
been replied to in para 1 of the reply to the
preliminary objections. It is denied that the
present objections have not been made out
within the scope of the permissible areas
under the Arbitration Act, 1940.”

Thus, according to the respondent, the petitioner was
disposing of its 'left-over stock'. The same statement is reproduced
elsewhere in the objections.
31.

So far as the left-over stocks are concerned, the terms and

conditions of the licence, clearly provided the manner in which the
left-over stocks is to be disposed of. In this behalf, my attention
has been drawn by Ms. Bagchi, learned counsel for the petitioner
to the general and specific conditions which govern the contract.
So far as the terms and conditions for the grant of form L-9 and
CLW-1 licence for the year 1986-87 are concerned, the same
provided thus:“11(i) Licences in form L-9 shall be granted only
to the working distilleries.
(ii) Licences in form L-9 and CLW-1 for the
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 20 of 29

said period shall be subject to general and
special conditions prescribed in rules 33, 34
and 35 of the Delhi Liquor Licence Rules, 1976
and the Delhi Country Liquor Bonded
Warehouses Rules and licences shall abide by
the provisions of the said Act and rules and
orders made thereunder any law in force in
Delhi relating to liquor. (Some of the relevant
provisions of the rules are attached at Annexure
-III for the information of intending tenderers).
These terms and conditions, unless repugnant
to the express provisions of the said Act and
rules made thereunder, shall be in addition to
the said Act and rules and any other law in
force in Delhi relating to liquor.”
The general and specific conditions which have been
prescribed in the rules made under the Punjab Excise Act, 1914 as
were in force at the relevant time provided condition 33 which
reads thus:“(33) If any person who had held a licence under
these rules, have in his possession on the expiry
or determination of from any other cause of his
licence any intoxicants, he shall take action for its
disposal in the following manner :(a) He shall submit forthwith to the Collector
the list such intoxicants indicating therein the
sale price of each brand. The Collector may allow
him not exceeding 15 days for the disposal of such
stocks to the existing licensees :Provided that if duty has not been paid on
such stocks and the purchaser does not hold a
licence permitting him to possess them in bond,
the duty on such stocks at the rates in force on the
date of sale shall be recovered from the purchaser
before he takes possession of them.

(b) In case the licensee is unable to dispose of
such stocks, in part or in full, within the
stipulated time, he shall immediately surrender
the same to the Collector alongwith a list
mentioning the quantity and brand of the
undisposed stock. He shall also intimate to the
Collector the price at which each brands, so
surrendered, shall be sold. It shall be open to the
licensee to reduce subsequently the sale price
earlier intimated by him. If no sale price is
intimated to the Collector at the time of the
surrendering the stocks, it is lawful for the
Collector to dispose of such stocks to the existing
licensees by auction:
Provided that if duty has not been paid on
such stocks and the purchaser does not held a
licence permitting him to possess them in bond,
the duty on such stocks at the rates in force on the
date of sale shall be recovered from the purchaser
before he takes possession of them.
(c) The Collector shall arrange to dispose of the
surrendered stocks at the price intimated by the
outgoing licensee.
Whenever such price is
reduced by the outgoing licensee, the Collector
shall dispose of the remaining stocks at such
reduced prices, as may be intimated to him by the
former licensee from time to time. In case the
stocks remain unsold for a period of 2 months
from the date of the determination of the licence,
it shall be lawful for the Collector to destroy these
stocks after obtaining the approval of the
Commissioner of Excise. No compensation will
be payable for such destruction to the outgoing
licensee. No refund of duty shall also be allowed
on stocks of liquor which ultimately remain
unsold and are destroyed;
Provided that if duty has not been paid on
such stocks, the Collector shall not order their
destruction but may require in writing any person
holding a licence to acquire the stocks, or any part
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 22 of 29

of them, by purchase from the former licensee
within six weeks of service of the requisition after
payment of duty at the rates in force on the date
of the requisition, at such price as may have been
indicated by the former licensee or such price as
the Commissioner may fix after hearing the
parties.
(d) Where the surrendered stocks are disposed
of by the Collector in the manner aforesaid, he
shall refund to the outgoing licensee the sale price
of these stocks after deducting the expenditure
incurred on arranging the disposal of such stocks.
(e) In case the outgoing licensee is unable to
dispose of the stocks within the period allowed by
the Collector as stated above and also fails to
surrender the same to the Collector after the
expiry of the aforesaid period,t he possession
thereof shall be illegal and unauthorised. Such
stocks shall be immediately seized and
prosecution will be launched for such
unauthorised possession.
(f) If any person who has held a licence under
these rules has in his possession any intoxicant
on which duty has not been paid and such person
holds a licence permitting the possession of such
stocks but not permitting him to hold them in
bond he shall be liable to pay duty on such stocks
from the date of commencement of his current
licence at the rates in force on that date;
Provided that the licensee shall not be liable
to pay interest on any penalty for delayed
payment on such duty for a period of one month
from the date of commencement.”

In the instant case, the petitioner had stocks of liquor

imported into Delhi prior to 31st March, 1987. The respondents
called for the supply of liquor from the bonded warehouse of the

CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 23 of 29

petitioner between the period 1st April, 1987 till 31st May, 1987 as
noticed above. Even if the liquor was treated as left-over stocks in
terms of the above condition by the respondents, it could be so
done only under the licence. On the own showing of the
respondents they have treated the supply as being under the
licence. The petitioner was entitled to the price thereof at the rates
of 1986-87 in terms of such a condition for the purposes of the
same.
33.

From the foregoing, it is apparent that the respondents have

accepted not only the fact that supplies have been effected on
terms and conditions as were laid down in the licence given to the
petitioner which would govern the supplies which were indented
and imported prior to the expiry of the licence. The competent
authority has repeatedly accepted the position that the licence was
extended and the appointment of the arbitrator was effected.
The respondents have thus also accepted the validity and
bindingness of the arbitration agreement and pursuant thereto,
the respondents are thus clearly estopped from now asserting to
the contrary.
34.

In the light of the foregoing, I have no hesitation in holding

CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 24 of 29

that the supplies which were imported by the petitioner pursuant
to specific orders of the competent authorities during the currency
of the licence would be governed by the terms and conditions
thereof.

The import licence was issued at the instance of the

Commissioner, Excise who addressed a communication to this
effect to the concerned authority in U.P. as noticed hereinabove as
well.

The validity of the extension has been accepted by the

competent authority who is the Lt. Governor of Delhi wherein he
appointed the arbitrator and effected change in respect of such
appointment twice over. The respondent is estopped from raising
such objections for the first time before this court by way of the
present objections.
35.

So far as the scope of Section 33 is concerned, the Apex

Court had again to consider the same on several occasions in the
pronouncement reported at AIR 1974 SC 303 entitled M/s
R.N. Ganekar & Co. v. M/s Hindustan Wires Limited, the
court held thus:“11. Section 33 of the Arbitration Act is as follows
:“Any party to an arbitration
agreement or any person claiming under
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 25 of 29

him desiring to challenge the existence or
validity of an arbitration agreement or an
award or to have the effect of either
determined shall apply to the court and the
court shall decide the question on
affidavits.”
It is clear from the provision that the court
had jurisdiction under this Section (i) when it is
desired to challenge the existence of an arbitration
agreement; (ii) when it is desired to challenge the
validity of that agreement and (iii) when it is
desired to have the effect of the arbitration
agreement determined. In all these cases, it is the
arbitration agreement only which is the subject
matter for consideration before the court. Indeed,
if an arbitration agreement forms one of the
clauses in a contract and that contract is for some
reason invalid in law or non-existent in law, it
would automatically follow the arbitration
agreement was also invalid or non-existent in the
eye of the law. But, when it is not the case that the
arbitration agreement has become non-existent or
invalid for that reason, the court under Section 33
is merely concerned with the three questions
relating to the arbitration agreement only. As
pointed out by this court in Shiva Jute Baling
Limited v. Hindley and Co. Ltd. (1960) 1 SCR 567
at p. 576 :“ An arbitration agreement may
come into existence in one of the two
ways; it may either arise out of an
agreement which contains nothing else
besides the arbitration agreement, or it
may arise out of a term contained in a
contract which deals with various other
matters relating to the contract, which
is the present case. Where one is
dealing with an arbitration agreement
of the second kind, Section 33 is
concerned only with the term relating
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 26 of 29

to arbitration in the contract and not
with the other terms of the contract
which do not arise for consideration on
an application under that section.””
36.

Looked at from any angle, the challenge to the award on the

ground that there is no arbitration agreement would therefore be
not sustainable. I.A. No. 7365/1995 is consequently dismissed.
37.

It is however to be noted that the award was made and

pronounced on 18th October, 1993. The arbitrator awarded a sum
of Rs. 3,05,816.28/- with interest at the rate of 18 per cent per
annum with effect from 1st June, 1987 till the date of realization.
By the order dated 24th September, 2001, the objections of
the respondents under Section 30 of the Arbitration Act, 1940
stand dismissed. The jurisdiction of this court is restricted to
objections under Section 33 and nothing more.
38.

The respondents have filed the objections to the award on

15th February, 1995 and the matter has remained pending for
adjudication ever since.
After bestowing my best consideration to the matter, I am of
the view that the award of interest at the rate of 18% during the
period the matter has remained pending in this court would be too
excessive. This order is passed in view of the fact that the
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993

Page 27 of 29

objections filed by the respondents were hopelessly barred by
limitation and to the extent of the objections under Section 30 of
the Arbitration Act, 1940, the same were dismissed by the court on
24th September, 2001. Accordingly, looking into the peculiar facts
and circumstances of this case, while maintaining the award of
interest at the rate of 18% per annum with effect from 1st June,
1987 till the date of passing of the award on 18th December, 1993, I
reduce the rate of interest from 18% to 10% with effect from 18th
December, 1993.

For the period thereafter till the date of

realization of the amount, the petitioner would be entitled to
interest at the rate of 10% per annum.
Accordingly, the award dated 18th December, 1993 is
directed to be made rule of the court subject to the direction that
the petitioner would be entitled to interest at the awarded rate
with effect from 1st June, 1987 till 18th December, 1993. For the
period thereafter till realization, the petitioner will be entitled to
interest at the rate of 10%.
CS (OS) No. 2716A/1993 shall stand disposed of in these
terms.
