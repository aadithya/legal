PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

FIR No.832/2006 dated 30.5.2006
U/S 147/148/149/307/427 IPC
& U/S 25/27/54/59 of Arms Act
Petitioner is in custody since 30.5.2006.

2.

Spoils of money pertaining to distribution of cable

signals appears to be the genesis of a fight.
3.

On 30.5.2006 a fight took place between two groups.

Group one was that of the petitioner. The other group may be
referred to as Rathi group.
4.

2 persons from Rathi group were injured. 4
Page 1 of 3

persons suffered injuries from the group of the petitioner.

The

injured of the Rathi group are Ajay and Surender.
5.

Role alleged against the petitioner is that of inciting the

fight and using a firearm by taking a shot at the opposite group.
6.

Persons injured in the Rathi group are Ajay and

Surender.
7.

Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the so

called pistol wounds are a make-believe story.

Counsel states

that for unexplainable reasons whereas Ajay was taken to a petty
local hospital called Brahm Shakti Hospital, the other stated
injured Surender was taken to a recognized hospital in the area
namely Jaipur Golden Hospital.

Counsel urges that Ajay was

discharged on the same day by Brahm Shakti Hospital and was
ostensibly taken to Jaipur Golden Hospital but no record
pertaining to his treatment at said hospital has been made a part
of the record of the challan filed.
8.

Counsel urges that the cartage ostensibly recovered

from the spot has not even been sent for forensic examination
and no report of forensic expert has been relied upon along with
the challan.

9.

It is not in dispute that a cross FIR No.833/2006 has

been registered againt the Rathi group. It is not in dispute that all
accused persons in both FIR's save and except the petitioner have
been admitted to bail.
10.

Noting the broad contours of the controversy and

subsequent

events

pertaining

to

the

investigation,

notwithstanding a greater role assigned to the petitioner, case is
made out to admit the petitioner to bail.
11.

Petition accordingly stands directing that on the

petitioner furnishing a personal bond in sum of Rs.20,000/- with
one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned
Trial Judge, petitioner would be admitted to bail in the above
captioned FIR.
12.

Needless to state, petitioner would not contact any

person of the rival group and would not threaten or intimidate any
witness.
13.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned counsel

for the petitioner.
