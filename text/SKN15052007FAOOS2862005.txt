SANJIV KHANNA, J:

1.

The present appeals by Mr. Tejpal Singh Bhatia, Mrs. Harinder

FAO(OS) 286-288/2005

Page 2

Kaur Bhatia and Malsh Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. is directed against the
th

Order dated 12 September, 2005 dismissing the application filed by
the appellants under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the Code, for short) along
with an application under Order XXXIX, Rule 2A of the Code.
2.

The appellants herein have filed the Suit seeking permanent

injunction restraining the respondent-DDA, Union of India and the Lt.
Governor, Delhi their agents and servants from interfering with peaceful
possession of agricultural land measuring in total 19 bighas and 19
biswas situated in revenue estate of Mehrauli, New Delhi. The details of
the land has been mentioned in the plaint.
3.

Learned counsel for the appellants had submitted that the

respondents are wrongly claiming that the land, subject matter of the
Suit stands acquired by the Government of India, Government of
National Capital Territory of Delhi and vests with the respondent-Delhi
Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as DDA, for short).
4.

In this regard, learned counsel for the appellants had drawn

our attention to the Notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition

FAO(OS) 286-288/2005

Page 3

Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, for short) dated 24

th

October, 1961 by which large track of land measuring 16,000 acres
was acquired for planned development of Delhi. It was stated that in the
said Notification full particulars and details of khasra numbers, etc had
not been given. It was further argued before us that Writ Petition (Civil)
th

No. 702/1969 was dismissed as withdrawn on 14 August, 1969 and
therefore there was no decision on merits. Regarding the second
petition no. W.P.(C) No.1805/1985 it was submitted that the same was
dismissed on the ground of laches and delay and therefore the
dismissal of the said writ petition could not have been a ground to reject
the application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 of the Code. It was
argued that issues have been framed and therefore status quo should
have been directed to be maintained.
5.

Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand,

submitted that this is a third round of litigation in which similar issues
and contentions have been raised regarding identity of the land covered
by Notification under Sections 4 and 6 of the Act. She had submitted
that in the earlier proceedings all these issues had already been raised

FAO(OS) 286-288/2005

Page 4

and the impugned Order passed was justified. Reliance was placed
upon the decision in the case of Bahadur Singh versus Union of
India and others reported in 122 (2005) DLT 586 (DB).
6

th

On 24 October, 1961 about 16,000 acres of land marked as

Block nos. 1-24 was acquired by a Notification under Section 4 of the
Act. For the purpose of identification, a map was enclosed with the
Notification and the description of the area was also given in Annexure
2.
7.

Thereafter, the said Notification under Section 6 of the Act was

issued in 1969.

It is an admitted position that the acquisition

proceedings were made subject matter of challenge by M/s.Bhai
Traders and Financiers Pvt. Ltd. who had filed Writ Petition (Civil) No.
702/1969. Similar writ petitions were also filed by several persons
against the said acquisition proceedings. The writ petition M/s. Bhai
Traders and Financiers Pvt. Ltd. was not pressed and dismissed on 25

th

September, 1980. It may be mentioned here that in other writ petitions
the validity of the acquisition proceedings was upheld.
8.

Subsequently, M/s. Bhai Traders and Financiers Pvt. Ltd. sold

FAO(OS) 286-288/2005

Page 5

the land subject matter of the Writ Petition No. 702/1969 to M/s. Montari
Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. which in turn sold “the land” to the appellantsplaintiff on or about October, 1955. M/s.Montari Enterprises Pvt. Ltd in
1985 filed another Writ Petition (Civil) No. 1805/1985 challenging the
acquisition proceedings. In this Writ Petition, specific question and
issue about the identity of the land belonging to M/s. Montari
Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. was raised and it was stated that the said land
was not covered by the acquisition proceedings under the Notification
issued under Section 4 of the Act. Challenge was also made to the
Notification issued under Section 6 of the Act and the Award dated 9

th

December, 1983 by which the land belonging to M/s. Montari
Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. was acquired.
9.

The said Writ Petition was dismissed by a detailed speaking

order dated 30

th

October, 2003 passed by a Division Bench of this

Court. In para 2 of the said judgment, the Court recorded the contention
of the petitioner therein, namely, M/s. Montary Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. that
the Notification under Section 4 did not cover the land, the subject
matter of the writ petition and only referred to an imaginary line and did

FAO(OS) 286-288/2005

Page 6

not specifically refer to khasra/survey numbers. Reference was also
made to Order dated 13

th

November, 1997 passed by the Division

Bench for demarcation of the land belonging to the petitioner therein. It
was also argued that withdrawal of Writ Petition (Civil) No. 702/1969 on
th

25 September, 1980 cannot come in the way of the petitioner therein
as the land was not covered by the acquisition proceedings. This
contention was rejected by the Division Bench. The Division Bench
referred to the principles underlying Order XXIII, Rule 1 of the Code. It
was held that as the petitioner-M/s.Bhai Traders and Financiers Pvt.
Ltd. had withdrawn the writ petition, it was not open for M/s. Montary
Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. to raise pleas which had already been abandoned
after lapse of several years. In this regard, the Division Bench referred
to judgment of the Supreme Court in Sarguja Transport Services
versus State Transport Appellate Tribunal, Gwalior and others
reported in AIR 1987 SC 88. Reference was also made to State of
Rajasthan versus D.R. Laxmi reported in 1996 (6) SCC 445 wherein it
has been held that law of limitation and laches bars a person from
questioning and challenging the validity of an order. Courts invalidate

FAO(OS) 286-288/2005

Page 7

an order only if the right remedy is sought by the right person in the
right proceedings and circumstances. A person who has waived his
rights does not deserve a discretionary remedy. By this , the Courts do
not make a void order valid but prohibit a person from taking recourse
to legal remedies. Reference was also made to State of Haryana
versus Dewan Singh reported in 1996 (7) SCC 394 and Municipal
Council, Ahmednagar versus Shah Hyder Beig reported in 2000 (2)
SCC 48 for the principle that equitable doctrine, namely, 'delay defeats
equity' should be given fullest application to proceedings initiated under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Decision in the case of
Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay versus Industrial
Development Investment Company Pvt. Ltd. reported in 1996 (11)
SCC 501 was quoted. A.K. Sikri, J. in his separate but concurrent
judgment noted that the dispute raised in the writ petition related to
demarcation of the land and the contention of the petitioner therein that
the land was purchased by the said petitioner from M/s. Bhai Traders
and Financiers Pvt. Ltd. was not covered by the Notification under
Sections 4 and 6 of the Act and the Award. However, the contention

FAO(OS) 286-288/2005

Page 8

was rejected. A.K. Sikri, J. has specifically held that this contention
cannot be permitted and allowed to be raised in the writ petition as it
was barred in view of the principles contained in Order XXIII, Rule 1 of
the Code. It was also held that there was no occasion or cause for M/s.
Montari Enterprises Pvt. Ltd to challenge the Notification and the
acquisition proceedings in case the land belonging to M/s. Bhai Traders
and Financiers Pvt. Ltd. was not subject matter of acquisition. In the
said judgment it was further opined that in case M/s. Bhai Traders and
Financiers Pvt. Ltd. wanted to challenge and question the Notification
and boundaries covered by the Notification under Section 4 of the Act
including the plea that the land in question was not the subject matter of
Notification under Section 4 of the Act, it was open for them to raise all
such pleas in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 702/1969. It was accordingly
held that no such pleas could now be raised by Montari Enterprises Pvt.
Ltd. and principle of estoppel as held by the Supreme Court in Sarguja
Transport (supra) was applicable.
10.

It may be noted here that the learned counsel for the

appellants had admitted before us that the appellants had purchased

FAO(OS) 286-288/2005

Page 9

the land in question from M/s.Montari Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. on 26

th

th

October, 1995 i.e. before the decision dated 30 October, 2003 in Writ
Petition (Civil) No 1805/1985. The appellants, therefore, are bound by
the decision given in the said case being subsequent purchasers before
the date of the judgment. In any case, the appellants cannot claim a
better right than M/s. Montari Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., the person who had
sold them the land in question. The appellants herein are bound by the
judgment dated 30

th

October, 2003 in WP(C) No. 1805/1985. (see

provisions of Order XXII, Rule 10 of the Code and Dhurandhar Prasad
Singh versus Jai Prakash University reported in (2001) 6 SCC 534).
As far as the appellants' are concerned, prima facie the civil suit will be
barred and not maintainable on account of general principles of res
judicata as a result of dismissal of the Writ Petition (C) NO. 1805/1985
filed by Montari Enterprises Private Limited.
11.

The appellants have virtually raised the same issues as were

raised by M/s. Montari Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. in Writ Petition (Civil) No.
1805/1985. The said questions and issues after consideration did not
find approval and the said writ petition was dismissed vide judgment

FAO(OS) 286-288/2005

Page 10

th

dated 30 October, 2003. In these circumstances, we do not think the
appellants have been able to make out a prima facie case and/or
balance of convenience is in their favour. Granting temporary injunction
is always a discretionary order which has to be passed keeping in view
existing of a prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable
harm. These three aspects have to be kept in mind. The appellants
have not been able to establish a prima facie case, show balance of
convenience and equity is in their favour or irreparable harm shall be
caused to them. On the other hand, the facts show a deliberate and
concerted effort to stall and prolong acquisition proceedings. Award in
th

the present case was passed on 9 December, 1983.

In view of the

fact that the appellants claim their right through M/s. Montari
Enterprises Pvt. Ltd and M/s. Bhai Traders and Financiers Pvt. Ltd. who
had earlier filed writ petitions but had failed or had withdrawn the same,
granting temporary injunction in a civil Suit is not justified.
12.

It is well settled that the principles of res judicata as well as

constructive res judicata equally apply to an order/judgment passed in a
writ petition, which is later on made the subject matter of a civil suit.

FAO(OS) 286-288/2005

Page 11

Explanation 4 to Section 11 of the Code is clear. Reference in this
regard can be safely made to the judgment of the Supreme Court in
the case of Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers' Association
versus State of Maharashtra reported in (1990) 2 SCC 715
it

has been

wherein

held that judgment disposing of a writ petition on

merits will bind the parties until it is set aside in appeal and the parties
cannot be permitted to circumvent and get over the judgment by
approaching the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of
India. Once a subject matter has been decided and a judgment is
delivered by a Court of competent jurisdiction, the said adjudication is
conclusive and final not only as to the actual matter determined but also
every other matter which the parties might or ought to have litigated or
which was incidentally or essentially connected to the subject matter of
litigation. Reference in this regard can also be made to Dr. Das Rao
Deshmukh versus Kamal Kishore reported in AIR 1996 SC 391. The
principle of res judicata and constructive res judicata equally apply as
the issue and subject matter raised in the present appeals already
stand decided and adjudicated in Writ Petition no. 1805/1985 titled M/s.

FAO(OS) 286-288/2005

Montari Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. versus Land Acquisition Collector and
th

another decided on 30 October, 2003.
13.

We may also mention here that the consolidation scheme

prepared in 1976 cannot furnish a fresh cause of action and negate the
effect of withdrawal of Writ Petition (Civil) No. 702/1969. The said Writ
Petition was withdrawn after consolidation scheme have been notified
th

in 1979 i.e. on 25 September, 1980. Moreover, Writ Petition (Civil) No.
1805/1985 was filed after the consolidation scheme. We may also state
here that the learned counsel for the respondent-DDA has pointed out
that the consolidation scheme was in respect of the area which was not
notified and therefore did not include the land which is subject matter
of the acquisition proceedings.
14.

In view of the above, we find no merit in the present Appeal

and the same is dismissed with costs of Rs.10,000/- which shall be
payable to the respondent-DDA.
