Crl.M.C.1092/2008 and Crl.M.A.4087/2008
1. A complaint under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure,

1973

dated

30.08.2005

under

Sections

415/416/419/420/463/464/466/468/469/471/506/120B/34 of
IPC was filed by Smt. Chander Mukhi, respondent no.2
herein, arraying 29 persons as accused.

The complainant

claims to be an illiterate villager, a senior citizen and a

Crl.M.C.1092/2008 and Crl.M.A.4087-88/2008

Page 1 of 12

resident of Village Saboli, Distrct: Sonepat, Haryana, but
was residing with her husband and other family members
at 11-A, Savitri Nagar, New Delhi -110017. The complainant
claimed

that

she

had

purchased

land

measuring

approximately 554 square yards which was part of Khasra
no.73, situated with the revenue estate of village Neb Sarai,
Tehsil Mehrauli, New Delhi on 26.08.1988 from Sh. Jaipal
Singh

on

Power

of

Attorney

basis

where

the

usual

documents of Agreement to Sell, GPA, Affidavit, Cash
Receipts

and

Will

were

executed

in

favour

of

the

complainant and subsequently peaceful vacant possession
was also handed over to the complainant.

Sh.Jaipal Singh

had represented to the complainant that he had purchased
the land measuring 4340 square yards from Sh.Harnand,
one

of

the

consideration

bhoomidars,
and

the

on

land

03.07.1987
which

was

for

valuable

sold

to

the

complainant was a part of the said land which was free from
all disputes and encumbrances.

Sh. Jaipal Singh further

revealed to the petitioner that he along with three other
persons had purchased land measuring 21,700 square yards
out of the total five acres of land owned by five bhoomidars
who were sons of Sh. Prabhati on 03.07.1988 in pursuance
to similar documents of sell on Power of Attorney basis.
One of the said five bhoomidars is

Ram Karan.

After

purchasing the said land, the four purchasers including Sh.
Jaipal Singh sold the said land to 46 different persons by
once again executing similar documents in the name

Crl.M.C.1092/2008 and Crl.M.A.4087-88/2008

of

Page 2 of 12

these 46 persons and subsequently the names of the said
46 persons were duly recorded in the revenue records of
Tehsil Mehrauli as bona fide persons in possession of their
respective plots in the year 1988-89 itself.

The aforesaid

plot holders and the complainant erected boundary walls
around their respective plots and the 46 purchasers formed
a Cooperative Society under the name and style of
Harivansh

Vihar

Plot

Holders

Association

for

proper

development of the plots.
2. In the month of July, 1994, the original bhoomidars including
Sh.Harnand accompanied by gunda elements are alleged to
have gone to the said five acres of land and started
demolishing the boundary walls, dwellings etc.

with the

intention of grabbing the land which they had already sold
long back.

FIR No. 213/1994 was thus registered with PS

Mehrauli, New Delhi.

Another FIR No.31/2000 dated

21.06.1999 under Sections 323/341/34 of IPC was also
registered at PS Mehrauli.

The said Ram Karan has been

impleaded as accused No.15 in the complaint while his sons
Sukhbir Singh, the petitioner in the present case, Vikram
and Rajinder Singh have been impleaded as accused Nos.16
to 18. Complainant claims that the original bhoomidars on
the strength and influence of accused No.18 Sh. Rajinder
Singh, who is a police officer in the police station Neb Sarai,
intended to grab the land of five acres as they had become
greedy on account of increase in the market value of the
land.

In para 8 of the complaint, it is alleged that the

Crl.M.C.1092/2008 and Crl.M.A.4087-88/2008

Page 3 of 12

complainant had come to know

that the said original

bhoomidars along with their legal heirs i.e. accused Nos.5 to
21 and accused nos.1 to 3 had connived and conspired with
Sh. Raghuvinder Singh, accused no.4, under the instructions
and guidance of the mastermind Sh. Rajinder Singh,
accused no.18, to achieve their ulterior motives and entered
into an agreement/memorandum of understanding dated
19.10.2004 with the said Sh. Raghuvinder Singh,

for the

sale of the said five acres of land for Rs.7 crore out of which
Rs.1.25 core had already been paid to accused Nos.1 to 3
and accused Nos.5 to 21.

Sh. Rajinder Singh was said to

have stood witness in the earlier sale transaction of the
aforesaid land by the original bhoomidars in favour of one
Sh.Ahmed Sultan Chawla which was later cancelled by the
original bhoomidars again on the strength of the same
Sh.Rajinder Singh. Sh. Ahmed Sultan Chawla had also filed
a civil suit against the original bhoomidars impleading the
successors as owners numbering about 50 persons but the
suit was subsequently compromised. The allegation is that
Sh.Raghuvinder Singh is a notorious land grabber against
whom a number of FIRs have been registered.

the land from the respective sellers.

and

These facts set

out in the complaint have been extracted to appreciate the
conspectus of the dispute.
3. The learned MM passed an order dated 16.12.2005 under
Section 156(3) of the said Code directing the SHO to
investigate the case and to register the FIR.
No.24/2006 was thus registered.

FIR

There are allegations that

the IO has been able to verify that the signatures of
Harnand could not be verified due to insufficiency of
admitted signatures which in turn could have authenticated
the execution of the documents executed by Sh.Harnand in
favour of Sh.Jaipal Singh, who in turn sold the land to
respondent no.2. It is alleged by the petitioner that one Sh.
Chaman Lal, Advocate had attested the documents of
transaction to different purchasers and he had in fact
denied the same.
4. There are two other material facts disclosed in the present
petition.
5. Firstly that Sh. Ram Karan, father of the petitioner and
Sh.Vikram, brother of the petitioner, being accused no.15
and 17 had filed a criminal Crl.Misc.Case 1918/2006 for
quashing of the FIR 24/2006 as also for quashing of the

Crl.M.C.1092/2008 and Crl.M.A.4087-88/2008

Page 5 of 12

Crl.Complaint 224/2005 filed by M/s Supreme Infrastructure
(India) Pvt. Ltd.

The said petition was dismissed on

21.02.2008 by a coordinate bench of this Court.

The

learned single Judge found that on a perusal of the
complaint and the FIR, it could not be said there was no
prima face case made out for proceeding against the
accused for offences mentioned therein.

The documents

were still being examined and the investigation was in
progress.
6. Secondly, a petition was lodged by Sh. Rajinder Singh,
brother of the petitioner, as Crl Misc.Case 927/2008, which
was

dismissed

as

withdrawn

before

this

Court

on

20.03.2008.
7. The present petition has been filed once again by the
petitioner herein seeking quashing of the complaint case
and FIR 24/2006.
8. Learned counsel for the petitioner at the inception of the
hearing was asked as to how different co-accused who are
identically situated can keep on filing different petitions to
somehow obtain the same relief by seeking quashing of the
same complaint and the same FIR registered in pursuance
to the order of the learned MM. Learned counsel could not
dispute that the accused were really in the same boat
except to the extent that Sh.Ram Karan was the father who
was recorded as a bhoomidar while the other three accused
including the petitioners were his sons.

The allegations

against the petitioner herein and Sh.Vikram are identical

Crl.M.C.1092/2008 and Crl.M.A.4087-88/2008

Page 6 of 12

though some greater role is assigned to the other brother
Sh.Rajinder Singh. It was thus put to the learned counsel
that the first petition was an endeavour by Sh.Ram Karan
and Sh.Vikram, identically situated to the petitioner and his
brother, thereafter an endeavour was made by Sh.Rajinder
Singh, his brother, and now this is a third attempt by the
petitioner even though there are categorical findings by a
coordinate bench of this court vide order dated 21.02.2008
that there was sufficient material at least to proceed with
the investigation. This is apart from the fact that normally
there must be very strong reasons to shut out the
investigation itself and it could only happen if on a bare
reading of the complaint, nothing could be made out against
the accused.
9. Learned

counsel

for

the

petitioner

proceeded

in

his

endeavour and sought to rely upon the judgment of the
Apex Court in Indian Oil Corporation v. NEPC India Ltd & Ors;
V (2006) SLT 475 and more specifically para 9 which is reproduced hereunder:
9.The principles relating to exercise of jurisdiction under Section
482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash complaints and
criminal proceedings have been stated and reiterated by this Court
in several decisions. To mention a few—Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia
v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre1, State of Haryana v. Bhajan
Lal2, Rupan Deol Bajaj v. Kanwar Pal Singh Gill3, Central Bureau of
Investigation v. Duncans Agro Industries Ltd.4, State of Bihar v.
Rajendra Agrawalla5, Rajesh Bajaj v. State NCT of Delhi6, Medchl
Chemicals & Pharma (P) Ltd. v. Biological E. Ltd.7, Hridaya Ranjan
Prasad Verma v. State of Bihar8, M. Krishnan v. Vijay Singh9 and
Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v. Mohd. Sharaful Haque10. The
principles, relevant to our purpose are:
(i)A complaint can be quashed where the allegations made in the
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in
their entirety, do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out
the case alleged against the accused.

Crl.M.C.1092/2008 and Crl.M.A.4087-88/2008

Page 7 of 12

For this purpose, the complaint has to be examined as a whole,
but without examining the merits of the allegations. Neither a
detailed inquiry nor a meticulous analysis of the material nor an
assessment of the reliability or genuineness of the allegations in the
complaint, is warranted while examining prayer for quashing of a
complaint.
(ii) A complaint may also be quashed where it is a clear abuse of the
process of the court, as when the criminal proceeding is found to
have been initiated with mala fides/malice for wreaking vengeance
or to cause harm, or where the allegations are absurd and
inherently improbable.
(iii) The power to quash shall not, however, be used to stifle or
scuttle a legitimate prosecution. The power should be used sparingly
and with abundant caution.
(iv) The complaint is not required to verbatim reproduce the legal
ingredients of the offence alleged. If the necessary factual
foundation is laid in the complaint, merely on the ground that a few
ingredients have not been stated in detail, the proceedings should
not be quashed. Quashing of the complaint is warranted only where
the complaint is so bereft of even the basic facts which are
absolutely necessary for making out the offence.
(v) A given set of facts may make out: (a) purely a civil wrong; or
(b) purely a criminal offence; or (c) a civil wrong as also a criminal
offence. A commercial transaction or a contractual dispute, apart
from furnishing a cause of action for seeking remedy in civil law,
may also involve a criminal offence. As the nature and scope of a
civil proceeding are different from a criminal proceeding, the mere
fact that the complaint relates to a commercial transaction or
breach of contract, for which a civil remedy is available or has been
availed, is not by itself a ground to quash the criminal proceedings.
The test is whether the allegations in the complaint disclose a
criminal offence or not.

10.

Learned counsel thus contended that the case of the

petitioner fell within (i) above inasmuch as the allegations
made in the complaint, even if they are taken on their face
value and accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie
constitute an offence to make out a case against the
accused.
11.

Learned counsel also referred to the judgment in State

of West Bengal and Ors v. Swapan Kumar Guha & Ors; AIR
1982 SC 949 to advance the proposition that while
exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution
Crl.M.C.1092/2008 and Crl.M.A.4087-88/2008

Page 8 of 12

of India, the High Court was justified in quashing the
investigation where the FIR did not disclose commission of a
cognizable offence.

The reference was also made to the

judgment of a learned single Judge of this Court in Vijay
Khanna v. Jumbo Electronics Co.Ltd and Anr; Recent
Criminal Reports 1985 (1) 20 where the test for exercising
jurisdiction under Section 482 of the said Code while
quashing the criminal proceedings was held to be that the
allegations in the complaint without adding or subtracting
anything would show that no offence was made out.
12.

A reference was also made to the Full Bench Judgment

in Vinod Kumar Sethi and Ors v. State of Punjab and Anr;
AIR 1982 Punjab and Haryana 372 to advance the
proposition that there was no blanket bar against quashing
of FIR and the consequent investigation though the power is
not to be exercised indiscriminately and the requisite precondition for the exercise of the power must be satisfied.
13.

On hearing learned counsel for the petitioner, I find

that there cannot be any dispute about legal proposition
sought to be advanced by learned counsel for the petitioner.
However, the legal precedents apply only to given facts of a
case and are law on those facts. The only question to be
examined is as to whether on a bare reading of the
complaint a situation exists where nothing can be held
against the petitioner assuming that what is stated is
correct.
category.

The present case certainly does not fall in that
A reading of the complaint shows that there is

Crl.M.C.1092/2008 and Crl.M.A.4087-88/2008

Page 9 of 12

categorical allegation of collusion of the petitioner, his two
brothers and his father to grab the bhoomidari land of which
the father was one of the bhoomidars and the petitioner and
his two brothers would have interest as heirs to the
bhoomidars. The question of authenticity of the documents
and their execution is being investigated and the IO has
stated

that

as

per

his

investigation,

the

advocate

Mr.Chaman Lal had in fact sought to backtrack from having
attested the documents under inducement or threat by the
accused persons since on investigation it was found that the
Register produced by him of the concerned time period was
not authentic and further investigation did go to show that
the documents were apparently executed.

Thus, the

investigation process is on and to quash the complaint and
the FIR would be to scuttle and throttle the investigation at
its inception which is not permissible.
14.

There is another important aspect of the matter

arising from the fact that accused no. 15 to 18 are closely
related. Accused no.15 is the father and accused no.16 to
18 are the sons of accused no.15.

Petitioner is accused

no.16. These accused are thus sailing in more or less the
same boat and the petitioner and accused no.17 are
identically situated.

The endeavour is to throttle the

investigation by filing different petitions seeking the same
relief. Thus one petition was filed by accused no.15 and 17
while another was filed by accused no.18.

The first was

dismissed by a speaking order by a coordinate bench of this

Crl.M.C.1092/2008 and Crl.M.A.4087-88/2008

Page 10 of 12

Court while the second one was dismissed as withdrawn by
this Court.

This is the third endeavour in that direction and

it appears to be a concerted effort to take chances before
different benches to somehow achieve the reliefs.

It is

noticed that such endevours of litigants have increased in
the recent past and in my considered view, the same
deserves to be dealt with a strong hand. This is not only
because the same would amount to element of bench
hunting and abuse of process of court but also because such
repeated petitions of identical nature only seek to burden
the courts with unnecessary litigation when these courts are
already over burdened.

As an illustration, hearing in the

present matter went on for about half an hour at the
insistence of the learned counsel for the petitioner.
15.

The most disturbing fact came to light on closer

scrutiny of the records of the present petition.

The whole

case was argued by the petitioner on the basis that
Mr.Sukhbir Singh was the sole petitioner in the present
case.

However, the records show that while the petition

was originally so filed, there is a note on the said memo of
parties stating that the same may be deleted as a new
memo of parties has been filed adding the name of
petitioner no.2. The petitioner no.2 is Mr.Vikram, brother of
Sh.Sukhbir Singh.

This, Mr.Vikram, had earlier filed a

petition seeking quashing of the same FIR which was
dismissed by

a speaking order dated 21.02.2008 in

Crl.M.C.1918-36/2006.

The name of Sh.Vikram has thus

Crl.M.C.1092/2008 and Crl.M.A.4087-88/2008

Page 11 of 12

been surreptitiously sought to be added in the present
petition as petitioner no.2 despite the fact that on the same
cause and for the same relief, his earlier petition has
already been dismissed. To say the least, this is a
deplorable conduct and would not have come to light but for
closer scrutiny of the record by this Court.
16.

The petition and the application are thus devoid of any

merit, abuse of process of court and are accordingly
dismissed with costs of Rs.7,500/- to be deposited with Delhi
High Court Legal Services Committee within fifteen days
from today.
