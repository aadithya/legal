order dated 17th August, 2007 passed by the Income

Appellate

Tribunal

Bench

„F‟

in

ITA

No.3032/D/2004 relevant for the assessment year
2001-02, vide which the appeal filed by the Assessee
was dismissed.
2.

The brief facts of this case are that the Assessee

company during the assessment year in question has
entered into an agreement with Moet‟s Kababs by
virtue of which, it transferred 85% of its daily
restaurant and bar sales to Moet‟s Kababs in lieu of
materials and labour supplied by it.

No written

agreement to this effect has been executed between
the parties.

The Assessee‟s stand was that it was

prudent business arrangement.
3.

The Assessing Officer in his assessment order has

observed that the Assessee did not run the business of
bar and restaurant during the year; that it had made

ITA No.141/2008

Page 2 of 9

no purchases of raw material and had not deployed any
man power to run the bar and the restaurant; that it
was Moet‟s who did everything; that even the bar
licence fee had not been paid by the Assessee, without
which the bar could not be legally run; that the sale
bills showed the names of Moet‟s restaurant and
Moet‟s Kababs, which proved that the bar and the
restaurant were being run by M/s Moet‟s, in the
Assessee‟s

premises;

that

there

was

no

written

agreement to prove that the Assessee had only hired a
caterer to improve its business prospects; that the
Assessee had no control on the business at all, there
being no mechanism to prevent Moet‟s from arbitrarily
withdrawing from the said arrangement; that no
prudent business man would shoulder such a huge
business risk; that the Assessee was assured of 15%
share of the total sales, which was in the nature of
rental receipt, for allowing Moet‟s to use its premises;
ITA No.141/2008

Page 3 of 9

that Section 38(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for
short as „Act‟) was applicable and, therefore, the
Assessee‟s claim of depreciation had to be restricted
and the Assessing Officer, thus, allowed only 18% of
the depreciation claimed by the Assessee.
4.

Aggrieved with the order passed by the Assessing

Officer,

the

Assessee

filed

an

appeal

before

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) {for short as
CIT(A)}.

The CIT(A) allowed the appeal filed by the

Assessee.
5.

Thereafter Revenue challenged the order of

CIT(A) before the Tribunal and the Tribunal vide its
impugned order accepted the appeal filed by the
Revenue holding that Assessing Officer rightly invoked
the provisions of Section 38(2) of the Act, since the
Assessee did not use its fixed assets exclusively for its
own business purposes.
ITA No.141/2008

Dissatisfied with the order
Page 4 of 9

passed by the Tribunal, the Assessee has filed the
present appeal.
6.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

Petitioner that the order passed by the Tribunal is
wrong in law since the assets are owned by the
Assessee and have been utilized for the purpose of
business.

M/s Moet‟s Kababs acted as a caterer for

supplying and servicing all the food without bringing
any assets including furniture fixture and the assets of
the Assessee had been used in carrying out the
business activity of operating bar and restaurant etc.
It

is

further

contended

that

all

the

licences,

registrations were obtained by the Assessee and the
claim of depreciation has been disallowed even on bar
sale despite finding of fact that undisputedly the bar
was being run by the Assessee. Lastly, it is contended
that the entire turnover including turnover from bar

ITA No.141/2008

Page 5 of 9

and restaurant has been assessed in the hands of
Assessee under Haryana General Sales Tax Act, which
is not disputed by the Revenue.
7.

Section 32(1) and 38(2) of the Act are relevant for

the purposes of resolving controversy in the present
case and the relevant provisions of these Sections read
as under:“32.Depreciation:(1) in respect of depreciation of(i) buildings, machinery, plant or furniture,
being tangible assets;
(ii) xxx

xxx

xxx

xxx

xxx

Owned, wholly or partly, by the Assessee
and used for the purposes of therefore,
business or profession, the following
deductions shall be allowed(i)xxx

(iii) in the case of any block of assets, such
percentage on the written down value
thereof as may be prescribed.”
“38 Building etc. partly used for
business, etc., or not exclusively so
used.
ITA No.141/2008

Page 6 of 9

(2)Where any building, machinery, plant or
furniture is not exclusively used for the
purposes of the business or profession, the
deductions under sub-clause (ii) of clause
(a) and clause (c) of section 30, clauses (i)
and (ii) of section 31 and clause (ii) of subsection (1) of section 32 shall be restricted
to a fair proportionate part thereof which
the Assessing Officer may determine, having
regard to the user of such building,
machinery, plant or furniture for the
purposes of the business or profession.”

8.

Section 32(1) of the Act thus provides that where

the asset is owned wholly or partly, by the Assessee
and used for the purposes of Assessee‟s business,
deduction in respect of depreciation, thereof shall be
allowed, as provided under Section 32(1)(ii).
9.

Whereas, Section 38(2) of the Act expressly

provides that deduction under Section 32(1)(ii) shall be
restricted, where the asset is not exclusively used for
the

Assessee‟s

business

purposes,

to

a

fair

proportionate part thereof, as laid down in Section

ITA No.141/2008

Page 7 of 9

38(2) of the Act.
10. It is the case of the Assessee that Moet‟s was
taking away 85% of the total receipts from the bar as
well as from the restaurant of the Assessee. Thus, it is
clear that the fixed assets of the Assessee were not
being utilized by him exclusively for its business
purposes, thereby attracting the provisions of Section
38(2) of the Act. This contention of the Assessee that it
was only using the brand name of Moet‟s and Moet‟s
was only catering at the Assessee‟s premises in lieu of
85%

of

the

gross

receipts

from

the

Assessee,

contradicts the Assessee‟s claim that its fixed assets
were not being shared by M/s Moet‟s. The Assessing
Officer in his assessment order has observed that the
Assessee has not been able to prove any control over
the business and there was no mechanism for Assessee
to prevent Moet‟s from arbitrarily withdrawing from

ITA No.141/2008

Page 8 of 9

the alleged arrangement.
11. As Moet‟s was carrying away 85% of the gross
receipts of the Assessee, that clearly shows that the
Assessee did not use its fixed assets exclusively for its
own business purposes.

Thus, no fault can be found

with the order passed by the Tribunal since it is a
finding of fact given by the Assessing Officer, there is
no

infirmity

in

the

arises

Thus
for

no
our

consideration.
12. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
