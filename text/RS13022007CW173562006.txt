REKHA SHARMA, J.
The short question which arises for consideration in this
writ petition is whether the petitioners/workmen, namely, Ram
Bhawan, Mam Chand and Nanehey Lal who joined the N.D.M.C. in 1984
as daily wage beldars and were later regularised as beldars with effect
from 1st April, 1997 are entitled to be regularised with effect from the
date of their initial appointment and further whether they are entitled
to be paid wages as were being paid to the regular beldars on the
principle of 'equal pay for equal work'.
It is not disputed that the petitioners were appointed as

WP(C) Nos. 17356-58/06

Page 1 of 7

beldars on daily-wage-basis and they continued to work in that
capacity for 6-7 years till they raised an industrial dispute in the year
1990 seeking their regularisation as beldars from the date of their
initial appointment. The dispute was referred to the Industrial Tribunal
– II, Karkardooma Courts, Delhi.

The reference made was to the

following effect:
“Whether the workmen mentioned in the
Annexure 'A' are entitled to be regularised
from their initial date of appointment and if so,
to what relief are they entitled and what
directions are necessary in this respect?”
It is also not disputed that the petitioners were regularised
as beldars with effect from 1.4.1997 pursuant to a policy decision
taken by the respondent. However, since the said policy did not meet
the aspirations of the petitioners who wanted their regularisation with
effect from their initial appointment, they persisted with the reference
pending before the Industrial Tribunal. The reference, in so far as the
case of petitioners is concerned was answered in the negative by the
Industrial Tribunal vide its award dated 21.7.2006.

The relevant

paragraphs of the award which deal with the case of the petitioners are
paragraphs 24 & 25. This is how they read:“24. The case of the Beldars & Sweepers can
be taken as the first category. They had been
regularised in accordance with the policies of
the management with effect from 01.04.97.
They are claiming regularisation from the date
of their initial appointment.

WP(C) Nos. 17356-58/06

They are also

Page 2 of 7

claiming equal pay for equal work from the
date of their initial appointment. It is now
settled law that persons appointed on ad hoc
basis or without following the due process of
selection cannot claim the regularisation as a
matter of right. It has been so held that in the
case of Secretary, State of Karnataka and
Others Vs. Umadevi and Others, page 197 in
Appeal No. 3595-3612 of 1999.

The Beldars

therefore, have no right for regularisation from
the date of their initial appointment because
their initial appointment was not against any
permanent post or against a regular vacancy.
They

have

been

regularised

by

the

management in accordance with the scheme
prepared

under

the

policy

contained

in

Ex.MW1/W1. There is no scope for any further
relief being granted to Beldars and Sweepers
with respect to the date of regularisation.
25.

The claim for equal pay for equal work is

not covered by the terms of reference and
therefore, cannot be granted.”
It is these findings of the Industrial Tribunal which have
been assailed in this writ petition.
It will be seen from the paragraphs quoted above that the
Industrial Tribunal has based its finding on the fact that the initial
appointments of the petitioners were not against any permanent post
or against a regular vacancy. This fact is not in dispute. As a matter of
fact, the petitioners themselves have stated in the writ petition that

WP(C) Nos. 17356-58/06

Page 3 of 7

when they joined service, they were kept on regular muster rolls.
Of course, they have also stated that the respondents omitted to
create necessary posts in the Composed Plant where they were
suppose to work but this averment even if it is assumed to be correct
is of no assistance to them because it does not alter the fact that when
they were taken on muster rolls, there were no regular posts of
beldars.
The Apex Court in the case of Secretary, State of
Karnatka & Others vs. Uma Devi & Others reported as 2006 (4)
SCC 1 on the basis of which the Tribunal has denied regularisation to
the petitioners has held as under:“45.

While

directing

that

appointments,

temporary or casual, be regularised or made
permanent, the courts are swayed by the fact
that the person concerned has worked for
some

time

and

in

some

cases

for

a

considerable length of time. It is not as if the
person who accepts an engagement either
temporary or casual in nature, is not aware of
the nature of his employment. He accepts the
employment with open eyes.

It may be true

that he is not in a position to bargain-not at
arm's

length-since

he

might

have

been

searching for some employment so as to eke
out his livelihood and accepts whatever he
gets. But on that ground alone, it would not be
appropriate

to

jettison

the

constitutional

scheme of appointment and to take the view
that a person who has temporarily or casually
WP(C) Nos. 17356-58/06

Page 4 of 7

got

employed

should

be

directed

to

be

continued permanently. By doing so, it will be
creating another mode of public appointment
which is not permissible. If the court were to
void a contractual employment of this nature
on the ground that the parties were not having
equal bargaining power, that too would not
enable the court to grant any relief to that
employee. A total embargo on such casual or
temporary employment is not possible, given
the

exigencies

of

administration

and

if

imposed, would only mean that some people
who at least get employment temporarily,
contractually or casually, would not be getting
even that employment when securing of such
employment brings at least some succour to
them.

After all, innumerable citizens of our

vast country are in search of employment and
one is not compelled to accept a casual or
temporary employment if one is not compelled
to accept a casual or temporary employment if
one is not inclined to go in for such an
employment. It is in that context that one has
to proceed on the basis that the employment
was accepted fully knowing the nature of it and
the consequences flowing from it.

In other

words, even while accepting the employment,
the person concerned knows the nature of his
employment.

It is not an appointment to a

post in the real sense of the term. The claim
acquired by him in the post in which he is
temporarily employed or the interest in that
post cannot be considered to be of such a
WP(C) Nos. 17356-58/06

Page 5 of 7

magnitude as to enable the giving up of the
procedure

established,

for

making

regular

appointments to available posts in the services
of the State. The argument that since one has
been working for some time in the post, it will
not be just to discontinue him, even though he
was aware of the nature of the employment
when he first took it up, is not (sic) one that
would enable the jettisoning of the procedure
established by law for public employment and
would

have

to

fail

when

tested

on

the

touchstone of constitutionality and equality of
opportunity enshrined in Article 14 if the
Constitution.
The above quoted paragraphs clearly lay down that if an
employee

was

initially

appointed

on

an

engagement

which

is

temporary or casual in nature, he cannot seek permanence on the
same merely because he had continued to work as such for a
considerable long period. The appointment of the petitioners as daily
wage

beldars

was

de-hors

the

Recruitment

Rules

and

those

appointments were not against any vacancy or a post. Therefore, the
petitioners have no right to be regularised with effect from the date of
their initial appointment.
It was sought to be contended by learned counsel for the
petitioner that, if not from the date of initial appointment of the
petitioners, they were at least entitled to be regularised after the
expiry of six years from the date of their initial appointment in terms of

WP(C) Nos. 17356-58/06

Page 6 of 7

the policy of the Government under which they were regularised with
effect from 1.4.1997.

The policy to which reference has been made

was intended to regularise all those beldars, who at the time it was
brought into effect, had put in six years of service without break as
daily wagers.

It was intended to apply prospectively and was not

aimed to effect regularisation retrospectively by reckoning six years
from the date of initial appointment of the employees. The submission,
therefore, has no merit.
It was also contended that the petitioners were entitled to
same wages as were being paid to a regular beldar since the date of
their initial appointment till they were regularised on the basis of
principle of 'equal pay for equal work'. The Tribunal declined to go into
this question and to my mind rightly. It has held that it was beyond the
scope of its reference. The terms of reference have been reproduced
above. They did not include the question whether the petitioners were
entitled to wages as were being paid to regular employees on the
principle of equal pay for equal work.
For the foregoing reasons, I find no merit in this writ
petition. The same is dismissed leaving the parties to bear their own
costs.
