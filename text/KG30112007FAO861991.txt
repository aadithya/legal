KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
*

By way of this appeal, the appellants seek to
challenge

FAO No.86/91

the

impugned

award

for

claiming

page 1 of 6

enhancement in the compensation amount.
The brief facts of the case are as under:
The deceased Sh.Satbir Singh was going on
31.8.83 in a tempo No. DEL 6029

with his friend

Sh.Promod Kumar and when the tempo reached near
Wazirabad bridge over Jamuna,

a DTC bus bearing

registration No. DHP 3655 plying on route no. 212
driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and
at a fast speed

hit the tempo resulting into

serious

injury on the person of Sh.Satbir. He was admitted in
Hindu Rao Hospital at about 11.00 P.M. but due to the
excess loss of blood he died in the accident.
Counsel for the appellants

contends that the

Tribunal has wrongly assessed the income of the
deceased at Rs.25/- to Rs.30/- per day although
categorically it was stated and proved that the income
of the deceased was between Rs.40/- to Rs.60 per day.
Counsel for the appellants further contends
FAO No.86/91

page 2 of 6

that no compensation has been awarded in favour of
the appellant for funeral expenses and for loss of love
and affection of the deceased child.
I have heard the counsel for the appellant.
Nobody has chosen to appear for respondent/DTC.
Although, on the last date Mr.J.S. Bhasin, Advocate
sought time to prepare the matter and address the
argument.
The deceased, a young boy of 19 years has
died and it has been proved on record that he was
earning a sum of Rs. 40/- to 60/- for doing cycle repair
work. Once in the evidence the factum of the income
was proved to be between Rs. 4O/- to 60 per day then
the same income as proved by the appellant should
have been taken into consideration by the Tribunal and
not the income on the basis of any rough assessment.
The income of the deceased is thus accepted at Rs.40/per day and calculating the same for a month it would
FAO No.86/91

page 3 of 6

come to Rs. 1200/- per month and after deducting 1/3rd
of the income towards the personal expenses

of the

deceased the net income meant for the dependents
would come to Rs. 800/- per month. The deceased was
19 years of age and his parents were between 46 to 50
years, therefore, the appropriate multiplier as per the
Second Schedule would be 13 on the basis of the age of
the claimants. In this regard the Hon'ble Apex Court in
New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Kalpana, (2007) 3
SCC 538 has observed as under:“7. The multiplier method involves the
ascertainment of the loss of dependency or the
multiplicand
having
regard
to
the
circumstances of the case and capitalising the
multiplicand by an appropriate multiplier. The
choice of the multiplier is determined by the
age of the deceased (or that of the claimants
whichever is higher) and by the calculation as
to what capital sum, if invested at a rate of
interest appropriate to a stable economy,
would yield the multiplicand by way of annual
interest. In ascertaining this, regard should
also be had to the fact that ultimately the
capital sum should also be consumed-up over
the period for which the dependency is
expected to last.”
FAO No.86/91

The total loss of financial dependents thus
would

come

to

Rs.1,24,800/-.

The

amount

Rs.60,000/- as granted to the appellants

of

towards

financial dependancy is thus enhanced to Rs.1,24,800/-.
No amount towards funeral expenses has been granted
by the Tribunal, therefore, an amount of Rs.5000/towards funeral expenses would be adequate if the
same is granted in favour of the appellants. No amount
towards loss of love and affection has been granted by
the Tribunal.

An amount of Rs. 25,000/- is granted

towards loss of love and affection also. The respondent
DTC shall now be liable to pay the differential amount
of Rs.94,800/- along with up-to-date interest @7% from
the date of filing of the petition till realisation.
With these directions, writ petition stands
disposed of.
