1. The present case is one of road-rage and as per the F.I.R.
Registered (being F.I.R. No. 432 of 2007 dated 11.11.2007), the
petitioner is alleged to have inflicted blows on the brother of
the complainant with a baseball bat apart from inflicting similar
blows on the car of the complainant.
2. The present application for anticipatory bail was filed after a
Bail Application No. 2895 of 2007

Page No.1 of 3

similar request was declined by the Sessions Court in terms of
the Order dated 01.12.2007. It may be noticed that a second
application for anticipatory bail was dismissed on 19.12.2007
on the ground that such a second anticipatory bail application
would not be maintainable before the same Court, as there
were no fresh circumstances which had come to light in the
meantime.

3. In the present bail application, notice was issued on 28.12.2007
recording detailed reasons as to why interim bail has been
granted on certain terms and conditions. It was also recorded
that the petitioner had, in fact, filed the first complaint. The
interim bail was granted on the following conditions :“1. The petitioner shall join the investigation as and
when required.
2. The key of the accidental car involved in the
accident shall be produced by the petitioner within
three days at the concerned police station.
3. The

petitioner

anywhere

near

is

the

directed

not

complainant

or

to

be

the

seen
family

members of the complainant within a distance of 200
meters.
4. The complainant shall not make any calls or
contact otherwise the complainant or any family
member of the complainant.”

4. The petitioner is, thus, enjoying the protection of interim bail on

the terms and conditions as aforesaid.

5. Learned APP appearing for the State was asked as to whether
the petitioner had joined the investigation. The answer to the
same was given in the affirmative. On a specific query being
posed, it was stated that the charge-sheet was ready and no
further custodial interrogation was necessary.

6. Since no custodial interrogation of the petitioner is required,
the petitioner is granted bail on the same terms and conditions
as aforesaid and the petition is accordingly disposed of.
