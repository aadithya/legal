1.
Present appeal arises out of orders dated 3rd
April, 2002 and 23rd August, 2002 thereby dismissing
appellant's application for amendment and its claim
F.A.O. No.243/2003

application respectively.
2.

The appellant booked a tank wagon No.CR44518 containing 22900 litres of LDO (Light Diesel
Oil) under Railway Receipt No.670280 and Invoice
No.16 dated 24th June, 1994 from ACP Siding,
Simaria (Barauni) to Shakurbasti, Delhi.

Refinery

Coordinator, Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Barauni
Oil Refinery

was consigner while the appellant

Corporation happened to be the consignee. The said
tank wagon arrived at destination station without top
and bottom seals. A shortage of 17940 litres of LDO
came to notice on a joint dip measurement being
taken at IOC Siding by the railway staff and IOC
representative.

A notice dated 5th September, 1994

under Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 was
served on the respondent by the appellant making a
compensation claim for Rs.1,12,534/- @ Rs.6272 per
kilo litre on account of short delivery, as aforesaid.
F.A.O. No.243/2003

Page 2 of 9

The notice so served was acknowledged by the
respondent on 13th September, 1994. In the notice it
was stated that the consignment/tank wagon was
booked from Panki instead of ACP Siding, Simaria
(Barauni). Even in the claim petition the forwarding
station was mentioned as Panki instead of ACP
Siding, Simaria (Barauni).
3.

The respondent contested the appellant's claim
inter alia on the plea that no tank wagon, as stated in
the claim application, had been booked Ex. Panki to
Shakurbasti,

Delhi

and

therefore

application was not maintainable.

the

claim

The respondent

also questioned the validity of the statutory notice
served on it by the appellant.
4.

The appellant later realized

the mistake

committed in mentioning the name of the forwarding
station correctly and sought to rectify the same by
seeking an amendment to its claim application. The
F.A.O. No.243/2003

Page 3 of 9

amendment application was however,

dismissed by

the Claims Tribunal holding that the same,
allowed, would change

the cause of action.

Tribunal relied upon a decision of this Court

if
The
in

Thandi Ram Jai Narain Vs. Union of India & Anr.; 75
(1998) DLT 376 in this regard.

Later, by an order

dated 23rd August, 2002 deciding

Issue No.1 on

maintainability of the claim application, the Tribunal
held that the petition was liable to be rejected as there
was variance in proof and pleading which was fatal
to the claim preferred by the appellant.
5.

I have heard arguments from either side.

6.

Learned counsel for the appellant contended
that

it was under mistake that the name of the

forwarding station was incorrectly mentioned in the
notice and that the same very mistake was carried
through in the

claim application as well. It was

pleaded that being an inadvertent clerical mistake,
F.A.O. No.243/2003

Page 4 of 9

the same ought to have been allowed to be corrected
by way of amendment. It was contended that while
serving notice on the respondent, a copy of railway
receipt

correctly

mentioning

the

name

of

the

forwarding station was enclosed and thus inspite of
the name of forwarding station being wrongly stated
in the notice, the respondent was in a position to find
correct name of the forwarding station to make out
that the compensation was being claimed in respect
of consignment which had been booked from ACP
Siding, Simaria (Barauni) and not from Panki railway
station.

The learned counsel for the appellant with

the help of two decisions of the Supreme Court in Raj
Narain Vs. Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi & Anr.; (1972)
3 SCC 850 and B.K.N. Pillai Vs. P. Pillai & Anr.; JT
1999 (10) SC 61 pleaded that the Claims Tribunal
should have taken a liberal approach in allowing the
amendment and that the same ought not to have
F.A.O. No.243/2003

Page 5 of 9

been disallowed on technicalities.

In B.K.N. Pillai

(supra) no doubt the Supreme Court
amendments in the pleadings

held that

all

should be allowed

which are necessary for determination of the real
controversies in the suit, at the same time

an

exception was made by providing that where the
proposed amendment would alter or substitute a new
cause of action on the basis of which the original lis
was raised, the same was liable to be disallowed.
7.

The decision of this court in Thandi Ram
(supra) which was relied upon by the Claims Tribunal
to disallow the amendment was a case where
claimant had mentioned

the

the date of booking of

consignment incorrectly in the notice as also in the
claim

petition

and

the

mistake

in

the

claim

application was sought to be remedied by seeking an
amendment which was however not granted and on a
petition being filed challenging the order disallowing
F.A.O. No.243/2003

Page 6 of 9

the amendment, the same was dismissed

as

the

mistake was reckoned as a vital defect. It was held
that

service of statutory notice being a condition

precedent

the

maintainable

claim

petition

could

not

be

in the absence of a proper notice.

Service of notice was held to be part of cause of action
and where

the cause of action was alleged to have

had arisen on a different date and the claim
application was sought to be amended for a cause of
action arising on a different date, in the absence of
notice it was held that there was no cause of action.
In the present case instead of

date of booking

of

consignment it is the name of the station wherefrom
the

consignment

was

booked

that

incorrectly mentioned in the notice

had

been

as also in the

claim petition. Enclosing railway receipt carrying the
name of the forwarding station from where the
consignment had actually been
F.A.O. No.243/2003

booked

Page 7 of 9

could not

have made up

for factual

error committed in

mentioning the name of forwarding station in the
notice correctly. The copy of railway receipt attached
to the notice was intended to be supportive

of the

facts stated in the notice and in the event of variance
on material particulars,

the notice would be a

defective one and could not be taken to satisfy the
condition of being a proper notice.

The proposed

amendment sought by the appellant to correct the
name of forwarding station in its claim application,
even if allowed, could not have saved it from rejection
for want of a proper notice. Thus, no fault can be
found with the order dated 3rd April, 2002 disallowing
the amendment.

Since

according to the appellant

itself the consignment in question had not been
booked from Panki and the evidence produced by it
rather showed that the same had in fact been booked
from Barauni railway station, the Tribunal rightly
F.A.O. No.243/2003

Page 8 of 9

held that there was variance in proof and pleading
which was fatal to the claim of the appellant. The
rejection

of

the

claim

petition

was,

in

the

circumstances, the obvious result which warrants no
interference. The appeal is thus, dismissed.
