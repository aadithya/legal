PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Petitioner Daya Rani Sharma seeks anticipatory bail

in the eventuality of her being arrested in FIR No.1141/2006
P.S. Dabri attracting Sections 419/420/468/471/120-B IPC.
2.

The complainant, Ishwar Singh Solanki, is stated to

be a retired Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP).
3.

Inter alia, it is stated in the complaint that late Tek

Bail Appln. No.414/2007

Pg.No.1 of 5

Chand, father of the complainant sold a parcel of land
comprised in part of Khasra No.303/304 Village Nasirpur to
Ms.Daya Rani Sharma daughter of C.P. Sharma vide a sale
deed executed in the year 1972. That Ms.Daya Rani Sharma
died in the year 1974.

That the petitioner whose real name

was Raj Rani started impersonating herself as Daya Rani
Sharma and interpolated the sale deed executed by father of
the complainant in the year 1972 in favour of Daya Rani
Sharma by inserting that not 1 but 2 plots were sold. It was
further stated in the complaint that reference to plot No.6 in
the sale deed was a result of manipulation.
4.

On the basis of the complaint FIR in question under

Section 419, 420, 468, 471 and 120-B IPC was registered.
5.

Apprehending arrest, petitioner seeks anticipatory

bail inter alia alleging that she is Daya Rani Sharma daughter
of late Shri C.P.Sharma and that vide sale deed dated 3.5.1972
she purchased 400 sq.yds. of land constituting 2 plots bearing
No.6 and 103 each measuring 200 sq.yds. from late Shri Tek
Chand. That she constructed a house on plot No.103. Plot No.6
was vacant.

In the year 1989 one Shri S.Chakravorty

encroached upon 35 sq.yds. of land comprised in plot No.6.

Bail Appln. No.414/2007

Pg.No.2 of 5

She filed a suit for possession registered as Suit No.462/1989.
The same was decreed on 7.10.1993. That complainant tried
to encroach upon the plot.

That a civil litigation in respect

thereof is pending.
6.

It is stated in the petition that the complainant being

a retired ACP, local police is helping the complainant.
7.

It is further stated in the petition that petitioner's

elder sister Dayawanti was married to Rajender Kumar and she
died on 2.7.1974.

It is stated by the petitioner that the

complainant is unnecessarily trying to project as if Dayawanti
was named Daya Rani Sharma.
8.

Having

considered

the

rival

submissions,

the

following facts stand out:(a)

Petitioner litigated with S.Chakravorty in the

year 1989 in her own name and obtained a decree
against S.Chakravorty pertaining to 35 sq.yds. of
land comprised in plot No.6.
(b)

Petitioner and the complainant are involved in

civil litigation in respect of plot No.6.
(c)

One

Dayawanti

died

on

2.7.1974.

Her

particulars are recorded as Dayawanti Sharma w/o

Bail Appln. No.414/2007

Pg.No.3 of 5

B.K.Sharma.
(d)

According to the petitioner, Dayawanti was her

elder sister and was married to B.K.Sharma.
(e)

Vide sale deed dated 3.5.1972 registered on

10.5.1972 as document No.9400, additional book
No.1, volume No.1744, pages 119 to 123, two plots
each admeasuring 200 sq.yds. comprised in part of
land constituting khasra No.303 and 304 Village
Nasirpur have been sold to the petitioner.

Seller

being late Tek Chand, father of the complainant.
9.

Prima facie, dispute between the complainant and

the petitioner is a civil dispute.

Whether by and under the

disputed sale deed one plot was sold or two were sold can
easily be determined with reference to the original sale deed
and the registration particulars thereof available in the office of
the Sub-Registrar where the sale deed has been registered.
10.

I see no reason why petitioner should be subjected

to custodial interrogation.
11.

I accordingly dispose of the petition directing that

the petitioner would join the investigation as and when
required by the investigating officer and in the event of her

Bail Appln. No.414/2007

Pg.No.4 of 5

being arrested, the investigating officer shall release her on
bail on petitioner furnishing a personal bond in sum of
Rs.10,000/- with one surety in the like amount in FIR
No.1141/2006 PS Dabri under Sections 419/420/468/471/120-B
IPC.
12.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned

counsel for the petitioner.
