JUDGMENT
P.K. BHASIN, J:

This petition is preferred by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 seeking quashing of the order dated 20.05.2006 passed
by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate in the criminal complaint filed by her

husband, respondent herein, whereby she was summoned as an accused for the
commission of offence punishable under Section 315 I.P.C.
2.

Briefly stated, facts of the case are that the marriage between the petitioner

and the respondent was solemnized on 30.11.2002 and since the very beginning
of their marriage, the petitioner was allegedly subjected to cruelty for not having
brought sufficient dowry. It is averred in the petition that the petitioner conceived in
the mid of February, 2003 but because of not having brought enough money the
petitioner was severely beaten up by the respondent on 02.06.2003 which
ultimately led to the mis-carriage of the three month old pregnancy of the
petitioner. All this forced the petitioner to lodge a complaint with CAW cell which
finally led to registration of FIR no. 264/2003 on 06.12.2003 against the
respondent and his family members under Sections 498A/406/34 I.P.C.
3.

Thereafter the respondent-husband filed a criminal complaint before the

learned Metropolitan Magistrate and, as noticed already, the learned Magistrate
summoned the petitioner as accused vide the impugned order. Aggrieved by the
said order the present petition was filed.
4.

During the pendency of the criminal proceedings between the parties they

sorted out their disputes and arrived at an amicable settlement. Compromise Deed
dated 11.12.2006 has been placed on record. Then a petition for divorce by
mutual consent was filed. After having recorded the joint statement of both the
parties the learned Additional District Judge vide his judgment dated 07.04.2007

in H.M.A. Case No. 459/07 dissolved the marriage between the petitioner and the
respondent herein.
5.

As had been agreed between the parties the petitioner herein appeared

before this Court in Crl. M.C. No. 700/2007 and supported the prayer of the
respondent herein for quashing of the FIR no. 264/2003 which was registered at
the instance of the petitioner against him and his family members for the offences
under Sections 498A/406/34 I.P.C. and the FIR was quashed by this Court vide
order dated 18.09.2007 in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties.
Certified copy of the order has also been placed on record. Then in the present
case also both parties made a joint request for quashing of the criminal complaint
filed by the respondent herein pending trial in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate.
6.

The complainant in the present case having himself now stated before this

Court that because of his having amicably resolved the disputes with his wife he is
no more interested in her prosecution it would secure the ends of justice, if the
complaint case pending in the Court against the petitioner is quashed as no useful
purpose would be served by continuing the trial arising out of matrimonial disputes
which now stands resolved amicably.
7.

This petition is accordingly allowed and consequently the complaint case no.

19614/11/5/4 pending in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi, is hereby
quashed.
