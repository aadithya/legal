BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.

This is an application filed on behalf of the respondent for rejection

of the petition filed by the petitioner under Section 34 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as “the said Act”) on the ground
that this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the said petition. It has
been contended by the respondent that, first of all, the arbitrator was appointed
by an order dated 7.1.2004 passed by the Additional District Judge on a petition
under Section 11 of the said Act. Therefore, in accordance with Section 42 of
the said Act, the objections, if any, under Section 34 of the Act, would lie

Page No.1 of 8

before the Court of the Additional District Judge, Delhi who appointed the sole
arbitrator. Secondly, it was contended on behalf of the respondent that the total
claims preferred before the sole arbitrator came to Rs 19.55 lakhs. Thus, this
Court would not have jurisdiction inasmuch as, had a suit been filed of the
same value, then the suit would have had to be filed before the District Court
and not before this Court. This submission has been made in view of the
provisions of Section 2 (1) (e) read with Section 34 of the said Act. The
learned counsel for the petitioner opposed this application and advanced
arguments to the contrary in respect of both the points urged on behalf of the
respondent.

2.

Insofar as the first point taken by the learned counsel for the

respondent is concerned, it is pertinent to note that when an order is passed
under Section 11 (6) of the said Act for the appointment of an arbitrator, the
Chief Justice or his designate does not function as a Court. This has been
clearly stated by the Supreme Court in the case of Rodemadan India Ltd v.
International Trade Expo Centre Ltd: (2006) 11 SCC 651. The Supreme
Court was of the view that neither the Chief Justice nor his designate under
Section 11 (6), is a “court” as contemplated under section 2 (1) (e) the said
Act. It was also held that the bar of jurisdiction under Section 42* is only
* 42. Jurisdiction. - Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Part or in any other law for
the time being in force, where with respect to an arbitration agreement any application under tis Part
has been made in a court, that court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and
all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made
in that court and in no other court.

intended to apply to a “court” as defined in Section 2 (1) (e). It is, therefore,
clear that an order passed under section 11 (6) of the said Act by the Chief
Justice or his designate would not fall within the purview of Section 42 thereof.
Accordingly, the order dated 7.1.2004 passed by the learned Additional District
Judge functioning as a designate of the Chief Justice under Section 11 (6) of the
said Act and appointing the learned arbitrator cannot be regarded as an order
passed by a Court. Therefore, Section 42 would not have any applicability in
respect of this order. Consequently, the first point urged on behalf of the
respondent has no merit.

3.

As regards the second point taken on behalf of the respondent, it

would be relevant to note the definition of “court” as it appears in Section 2 (1)
(e) of the said Act. The same reads as under:“2 (1) xxxx xxxx

xxxx

xxxx

(e) “Court” means the principal Civil Court of original
jurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in
exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having
jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subjectmatter of the arbitration if the same had been the subjectmatter of a suit, but does not include any civil court of a
grade inferior to such principal Civil Court, or any Court of
Small Causes;
xxxx
4.

xxxx

xxxx

xxxx”

A plain reading of the aforesaid definition makes it clear that the

word “court” has reference to the principal civil court of original jurisdiction

IA 10136/07 IN OMP 360/2006

Page No.3 of 8

which would have had jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject
matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject matter of a suit. It
means that had there been no arbitration clause, the court, where the suit, for
the same cause of action, could have been filed, would be the court which has
been referred to under Section 2 (1) (e) of the said Act. This definition of
court, as it appears in Section 2 (1) (e) has to be read into Section 34 of the said
Act which permits the filing of an application for setting aside the arbitral
award before a “court”. Therefore, reading Section 2 (1) (e) along with Section
34 of the said Act, an application for setting aside an arbitral award can only be
filed in a court which would have had jurisdiction to entertain a suit had there
been no arbitration agreement between the parties.

5.

The claim that has been filed by the respondent before the arbitrator

was under seven heads. The details of the claims as made by the claimant
before the arbitrator are set out hereunder:“Details of Claims

2.

The claimants claim on account of
Rs 8,50,000/extra expenditure incurred due to
increase in prices of material labour
and transportation as the contract
period prolonged by about 13 months

3.

The claimants claim on account of
Rs 2,60,000/extra expenditure incurred on salaries
and other establishments of
supervisory staff etc. as the contract
period prolonged by about 13 months

4.

The claimants claim on account of
extra expenditure incurred for idle
machinery, T&P etc. as the contract
period prolonged by about 13
months.

5.

The claimants claim on account of
Rs 2,50,000/wrong deductions and recoveries
made for various items by the
department and Sale Tax deducted at
later stage of the contract.

6.

The claimants claim pre-suit and
future interest @ Rs 24% per annum

7

The claimants claim towards the cost Rs
of arbitration proceedings.
50,000/TOTAL

Rs 1,45,000/-

Rs19,55,000/
-

The total of the claims comes to Rs 19,55,000/-. Since item No. 7 pertains to
the cost of arbitration proceedings, it was to be excluded for the purposes of
construing the valuation of the subject matter had the same been filed as a suit.
Subtracting Rs 50,000/- from Rs 19,55,000/- we are left with a claim of Rs
19,05,000/-. According to the learned counsel for the respondent, since this is
less than Rs 20,00,000/-, the suit would have had to be filed before the District

IA 10136/07 IN OMP 360/2006

Page No.5 of 8

Judge and not before this Court. Therefore, it would be the District Court
which would have jurisdiction to entertain an application under Section 34 and
not this Court. In response, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that
the sum of Rs 19,05,000/- has reference only of claims Nos. 1 to 5. It does not
have any reference to item No.6 which has been left blank by the
respondent/claimant in its claims made to the learned arbitrator. Item No. 6
pertains to the claim of pre-suit and future interest @ 24% per annum.
Obviously, interest is being claimed in respect of the amounts given in items 1
to 5. The respondent/claimant is claiming the said sums as having become due
and payable to it by the petitioner from January 2000. The claim before the
arbitrator was ultimately made on July 2004. Therefore, a period of four and a
half years had elapsed before the claim, according to the respondent, had
crystallized and the claim was preferred. Consequently, the pre-suit period
would be this period of four and a half years commencing from January, 2000
and ending July, 2004. An amount of interest at the rate of 24% per annum has
been claimed for this period. The interest that is claimed would, therefore, be
claimed in respect of the principal amount of the claims which has been stated
above to be Rs 19,05,000/-. Surely, if this interest element for the pre-suit
period is added to the claim, then the total claim would be far in excess of Rs
20,00,000/-.

6.

As per the Suits Valuation Act, 1887, and in particular, Section 8

thereof, the present claim, had it been a suit, would be valued in the same
manner as its valued for the purposes of computing Court fees. Under Section
7 of the Court Fees Act, 1870, the claim, had it been a suit, would be a suit for
money and would have to be valued according to the amount claimed. Since
the respondent has made a claim in respect of items 1 to 5 referred to above as
also item No.6 which includes a claim for pre-suit interest, the valuation of
items 1 to 5 as well as of interest for the pre-suit period would have to be taken
into account for arriving at the value of the suit for computing court fees. As
already pointed out, the value for the purpose of jurisdiction is to be the same as
that for the purposes of court fee. Taking that into account and including the
valuation for the pre-suit interest element, the suit, if it had been filed
(assessing that there was no arbitration agreement), would have been valued in
excess of Rs 20,00,000/- both for the purposes of computing court fees and for
jurisdiction. Therefore, such a suit could have been filed only before the High
Court and not before the District Court as the pecuniary jurisdiction of the
District Court was limited to suits upto Rs 20,00,000/-. That being the position,
reading the provisions of Section 2 (1) (e) read with Section 34 of the said Act,
the inescapable conclusion is that this Court would have jurisdiction to
entertain the present petition under Section 34.

Both the grounds taken by the respondent in support of this
application are untenable. This application is dismissed.
