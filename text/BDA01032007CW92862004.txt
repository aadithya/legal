application is allowed. The writ petition is restored to its original number and

WP(C) No.9286/2004
1.

The petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 28.04.2004 whereby,

in pursuance of Rule 92 (H) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Election of
Councillors) Rules, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as 'the said Rules'), the State
Election Commissioner declared the petitioner to be disqualified for being
chosen and for being a member of Municipal Corporation of Delhi for a period
of six years from the date of the said order. The petitioner contested the Delhi
Municipal Corporation elections in the year 2002 which was held on
24.03.2002 from Ward No.45 (Khyala) as a candidate from the Bhartiya Janata
Party (BJP). The results of the election were declared on 27.03.2002. The
petitioner was unsuccessful. However, the petitioner, in terms of Rule 92 (A)
of the said Rules, was required to keep a separate and correct account of all the
expenditure in connection with the election, incurred or authorised by him or by
his election agents between the dates on which he was nominated and the date
of declaration of the result. Furthermore, by virtue of Rule 92 (B) of the said
rules, such candidates were required to submit the account of election expenses
within 10 days of the declaration of the result. The candidates for the election
held on 24.03.2002 were, therefore, required to lodge the above mentioned

WP(C)9286/04

Page No.2 of 5

statement of accounts with the concerned Returning Officer by 08.04.2002
(07.04.2002 being a Sunday).

2.

This was not done by the petitioner and the statement of election

expenses was only submitted on 17.05.2002 in the Office of the State Election
Commission, whereas he was required to submit the same to the concerned
Returning Officer.

Rule 92 (H) of the said rules also prescribes the

disqualification of a candidate who fails to lodge his statement of election
expenses within the time prescribed under Rule 92 (B). The said Rule 92 (B)
reads as under:“92 (B).
Lodging of accounts with the Returning
Officer:—Every contesting candidate at an election of a
ward shall, within ten days from the date of election of the
returned candidate, lodge with the Returning Officer an
account of his election expenses which shall be a true copy
of the account kept by him or by his election agent.”
3.

It appears that an opportunity of hearing was granted by the

Commission to the petitioner before the impugned order was passed and the
petitioner had indicated that his father had suffered a paralytic attack on
28.03.2002, i.e., immediately after the declaration of the result and, therefore,
he could not file his statement of election accounts within time. Unfortunately,
this explanation was not accepted by the State Election Commissioner. This is
perhaps due to the fact that although the petitioner mentioned that his father
suffered a paralytic attack, he did not produce any document in support thereof.
WP(C)9286/04

Page No.3 of 5

To support his contention that he was prevented by good reason for his failure
to submit the account within time, the petitioner has filed by way of AnnexureE (collectively) various reports, prescriptions as well as results of the tests done
by hospitals in an attempt to indicate that the petitioner's father did, in fact,
suffer a paralytic attack on 28.03.2002 and was under treatment in the hospitals
concerned during that period and, therefore, the petitioner was unable to present
the statement of accounts within the 10 days prescribed. Since these documents
were not produced before the concerned State Election Commissioner, the
impugned order by itself cannot be faulted. However, after hearing the counsel
for the parties, I find that there is a provision in the said rules, namely, Rule 92
(I) which enables the Election Commission to remove or reduce the period of
this disqualification. Rule 92 (I) permits the Election Commission, for reasons
to be recorded, to remove any disqualification under Part-V-A (Election
Expenses) as well as it enables the Election Commission to reduce the period of
any disqualification.

4.

Therefore, while not interfering with the impugned order, the

petitioner is given the liberty to approach the concerned Election Commission
under Rule 92 (I) for a consideration of either removal of the disqualification or
reduction in the period of disqualification.

The petitioner shall move the

application within three days and the same shall be dealt with by the Election

WP(C)9286/04

Commissioner within 10 days provided that all the material that is available
with the petitioner is produced before the Election Commission.
The writ petition stands disposed of.
Dasti to both the parties.
