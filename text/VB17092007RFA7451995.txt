CORAM:
HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE T.S.THAKUR
HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE VEENA BIRBAL
Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see
the judgment?
To be referred to the Reporter or not?
Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?

T.S.THAKUR, J. (ORAL)
A large extent of land admeasuring seven thousand bighas
or so situated in village Rithala was notified for acquisition in
terms of four different notifications. The first notification dated
13.2.1981 notified the lands for acquisition for the construction
of a supplementary drain. The second notification dated

RFA 745/1995 & connec. matters

page 4 of 9

20.2.1981 related to the construction of a water sewage
treatment plant.

The third notification dated 13.3.1981

indicated remodelling of Nangloi drain as the public purpose for
which

the

acquisition

was

proposed,

while

the

fourth

notification dated 31.12.1981 was issued for acquiring the lands
mentioned therein for planned development of Delhi.
2.

Four different awards were, in consequence of the above

notifications,

made

by

the

Land

Acquisition

Collector

determining the amount of compensation with which the land
owners were dissatisfied who demanded references to the civil
court for determination of the true market value of the land
payable to them. These References were partly allowed by the
Reference Court, aggrieved whereof the land owners preferred
appeals which were disposed of by a Division Bench of this
Court in terms of a common judgment in Jas Rath vs. Union of

India 95 (2002) DLT 605 (DB).

The compensation payable to

the land owners was by the said order enhanced to Rs.20,000/per bigha in respect of lands notified in the first notification,
Rs.10,800/- in respect of lands covered under the second and
third notification and a sum of Rs.21,000/- per bigha in respect
of lands acquired in terms of the fourth notification.
3.

The land owners as also the State Government were

RFA 745/1995 & connec. matters

page 5 of 9

dissatisfied with the said order of enhancement made by this
Court, against which they preferred appeals before the Apex
Court who by a common order dated 7th September, 2005 set
aside the orders passed by this Court and remanded the matter
back for a fresh hearing and disposal in accordance with law. It
is not in dispute that after the said order of remand the entire
batch of cases relating to village Rithala was heard and
disposed of by a common order dated 27th April, 2006, Jas Rath

v. Union of India 130 (2006) DLT 700. The said order enhanced
the compensation payable to the land owners for the lands
acquired

in

the

first,

second

and

third

notifications

to

Rs.25,000/- per bigha with proportionate statutory benefits.

In

respect of land covered by the fourth notification dated
31.12.1981, the Court fixed a sum of Rs.27,000/- per bigha as
the compensation payable to the land owners.

The operative

portion of the order passed by this Court reads as under:
“The determination of the market value of
the acquired land, thus, can appropriately be
calculated on the above basis. Under
Ex.PW1/1, the land was sold @Rs.19,000/per bigha on 4-11/4/80 while the land in the
same village was sold @Rs.35,000/- per bigha
on 8th April, 1991. On average, the
compensation payable to the claimants would
come to Rs.27,000/- per bigha for the
notification issued on 31st December, 1981.
The claimants, whose land was acquired
under
notifications
dated
13.2.1981,
RFA 745/1995 & connec. matters

page 6 of 9

4.

20.2.1981 and 13.3.1981 obviously cannot
get the same compensation as the value of
the land has shown increasing trends as per
the documents placed by the parties on
record, particularly Exh.A-2, A-10 and A-11
as well as Exh. X. Thus, these claimants are
entitled to Rs.25,000/- per bigha. If we take
the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
case of K. Posayya (supra) as the base for
grant to the claimants an increase on annual
basis for the intervening period i.e. 1961 to
1981, they would be entitled to higher
compensation than what has been awarded
by us in this judgment. However, in the face
of the sale deeds on record, we do not wish
to compute and grant compensation to the
claimants @12% compounding increase on
the valuation fixed by the Supreme Court at
Rs.7,000/- in the case of Laik Ram (Dead) by
Lrs. and Ors. etc.etc. Vs. Union of India (CA
No 7168-7171/2002 and other connected
matters decided on 8th December, 2005), as
awarding compensation by giving an annual
increase on percentage is not a universal
principle, which can be applied irrespective
of the facts and circumstances of the case.
On the contrary, the courts have cautioned
more than often that this is not a very safe
principle which should be applied by the
Courts. Further, that this principle can
appropriately be invoked only and preferably
when there is hardly any evidence before the
Court
to
determine
such
issue
of
compensation on merits or otherwise.
Reference in this regard can be made to the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
Mehtab Singh and others etc. v. State of
Haryana, AIR 1995 SC 667.”
When the present appeals came up before us today for

hearing, learned counsel for the parties agreed that the issues
that arise for determination in these appeals stand concluded by

RFA 745/1995 & connec. matters

page 7 of 9

the judgment of this Court in

Jasrath's case (supra).

They

submitted that even when the land owners have assailed the
correctness of the said order before the Apex Court in appeals
filed by them and sought a further enhancement, insofar as this
Court is concerned the matter stands concluded by the order
passed in Jasrath's

case.

They submitted that these appeals

could all be disposed of on the analogy of the decision in
Jasrath's case enhancing the compensation awarded by the
Reference Court to Rs.25,000/- per bigha in the case of lands
covered by the first three notifications and Rs.27,000/- per
bigha in respect of land covered by the fourth notification with
proportionate statutory benefits.
5.

In the circumstances thereof and keeping in view the

submissions made at the Bar as also the decision of the Division
Bench of this Court in Jasrath's case (supra) which relates to
lands situated in the same village and covered by the awards
made in relation to the same notifications, we allow these
appeals and direct that on the analogy of the orders passed by
this Court in Jasrath's case and for the reasons stated therein,
the amount of compensation payable to the land owners shall
stand enhanced to Rs.25,000/- per bigha in the case of lands
covered

by

notifications

RFA 745/1995 & connec. matters

dated

13.2.1981,

20.2.1981

page 8 of 9

and

30.3.1981 with all proportionate statutory benefits. We further
direct that in the case of lands covered by the fourth notification
dated 31.12.1981, the amount of compensation shall stand
enhanced to Rs.27,000/- per bigha with all proportionate
statutory benefits.

Needless to say that the appellants shall be

entitled to interest on the additional amount in terms of Section
23(1A) of the Act and the solatium in terms of decision of the
Supreme Court in Sunder v. Union of India 2001 (93) DLT 569.
The appellants shall also be entitled to proportionate costs.
