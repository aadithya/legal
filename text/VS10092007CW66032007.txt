1.

The Petitioner impugns the order dated 30th May 2007

passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New
Delhi, in O.A. No. 2581/2006 whereby his aforesaid O.A. has been
dismissed by the Tribunal.
2.

The Petitioner was awarded a major penalty of reduction in

the basic pay from Rs.4600 to Rs.4000 in the pay scale of Rs.40006000 for a period of 5 years with cumulative effect vide order dated
30th May 2001. His departmental appeal was also rejected on
21.8.2001. The inquiry was conducted against the Petitioner on

grounds of corruption while discharging his duties as a Senior Booking
Clerk after he was caught in a trap case.
3.

On 13th May 2002, the Petitioner was transferred from Delhi

Division to Firozpur Division alongwith his post.

This was an inter

divisional transfer. He challenged his transfer by filing O.A. No.
1464/2002 which was disposed of at the admission stage on 30th May
2002 permitting the Petitioner to make a representation against his
transfer before the Competent Authority within a week. The same was
directed to be considered and disposed of by a detailed and speaking
order within two weeks, after receipt of the representation. The
Tribunal directed status quo to be maintained by the Respondent in
respect of the Petitioner's transfer. The Petitioner was also given
liberty to again approach the Tribunal in case he was still aggrieved by
the order that may be passed by the Competent Authority on his
representation.
4.

The Petitioner represented against his transfer on 4th June

2002 on the ground that no reasons for his inter divisional transfer had
been indicated and that such a transfer could not be effected in
respect of the post of Senior Booking Clerk held by him since the post
had not been declared surplus nor had it been surrendered. The
Respondents passed an order of 8th July 2002 keeping the Petitioner's
transfer order dated 13.5.2002 in abeyance till finalisation of his
representation. The representation of the Petitioner was thereafter
rejected on 5th November 2002 whereupon he preferred O.A. No.
W.P. (C) No. 6603/2007

Page 2 of 13

3061/2002. This OA was dismissed by the Tribunal on 30th May 2003 by
a detailed order and the interim order granted in favour of the
Petitioner on 28th November 2002 was vacated.

All this while the

Petitioner had confirmed to be posted in Delhi on account of the stay
orders

aforesaid passed by the Tribunal and the abeyance order

passed by the Respondent.
5.

The Respondent a issued periodic transfer order dated 17th

May, 2005 in respect of the Petitioner to Badli Station where he joined.
On 21st February 2006, the Respondent issued the order whereby the
Respondent stated that on account of the dismissal of the Petitioner's
O.A. No.3061/2002, whereby he had challenged his transfer to Firozpur
Division, he may be spared and directed to report to DRM, Firozpur
Division alongwith the post for further posting orders.
6.

The Petitioner preferred yet another O.A. No. 538/2006

impugning the aforesaid transfer order, which was disposed of on 3 rd
May 2006 directing that the Petitioner shall file his representation
within a week and the same shall be considered within two weeks in
the light of the observations of the Tribunal by a reasoned and
speaking order. Once again the Tribunal directed that the transfer
orders shall not be given effect to till disposal of the representation.
7.

The Petitioner represented once again on 9th May 2006

contending that the transfer orders dated 21.2.2006 were stigmatic
and punitive. He also stated that other similarly situated employees
who had vigilance cases against them, had not been subjected to inter
W.P. (C) No. 6603/2007

divisional

transfer.

However,

the

Respondent

rejected

the

representation of the Petitioner vide order dated 4.6/7.2006.
8.

The Petitioner once again challenged the transfer order

dated 21.2.2006, alongwith the rejection of aforesaid representation
on 4.6/7.2006 before the Tribunal by filing the O.A., wherein the
impugned order has been passed, on the ground that he had already
been subjected to a periodic transfer on periodical basis to Badli from
Delhi in the same Division and therefore, there could not be an inter
divisional transfer to Firozpur once again. When the aforesaid O.A.
Came up for hearing on 11th April 2006, the Tribunal refused to grant
any interim stay in respect of the transfer orders.
9.

Before the Tribunal the Petitioner sought to make out a

case of discrimination by citing various examples.
10.

He also contended that the punishment period of 5 years

under the order dated 30.5.2001 had already lapsed and therefore, his
transfer is liable to be quashed in the light of the judgment of the
Tribunal in the case of Rajender Singh vs. Union of India, O.A. No.
1340/2006 decided on 18.10.2006 and upheld by this Court in WP(C)
No.3522/2007. He also relied on another decision of the Tribunal in
Manoj V. Kumare vs. Union of India, 2002 (1) AISLJ (CAT) Mumbai 138,
which held that the transfer pending in inquiry is stigmatic. He also
submitted that the Respondents have not established as to what where
the exigencies of services on account of which he was being subjected
to inter divisional transfer. He relied on a circular dated 30 th October
W.P. (C) No. 6603/2007

Page 4 of 13

1998, which envisages that an order subjecting a Railway Employee to
inter divisional transfer, which is normally not possible, should be
passed after complying with the principles of natural justice.
11.

On the other hand, the Respondents contended that they

had no knowledge of the fact that O.A. No. 3061/2002 filed by the
Petitioner against his inter divisional transfer to Firozpur had been
dismissed and the stay against his transfer vacated and, therefore, he
was given a periodical transfer to Badli on 17th May 2005. However,
when the Respondent came to know about the dismissal of O.A.
No.3061/2002, which had been dismissed on 30th May 2003, they
issued the notice dated 21.2.2006, to spare the Petitioner and directed
him to report to DRM, Firozpur Division alongwith his post for further
posting.
12.

The Respondent relied upon Rule 226 of the Indian

Railways Establishment Code (IREC) Vol. I, read with Railway Board
Letter No. E(NG)L-98/TR/11 dated 2.11.1998, according to which a
Railway servant who has been serving in a

mass contact area, and

who has been subjected to penalty on corruption charges, should be
sent on inter divisional transfer in public interest as a matter of policy.
It was also contended that transfer of an employee is an incidence of
service and the same can be interfered within judicial review only if it
is mala fide, in violation of the Rules, or passed by an Incompetent
Authority. It is not for the courts or the Tribunal to sit as an Appellate
Authority over the matter of transfer and interfere with the smooth

functioning of the administration. The Respondent also contended that
the present OA was hit by res-judicata, inasmuch, as issues raised in
the present OA had been dealt with in O.A. No.3061/2002 which had
been dismissed against the Petitioner. He also contended that the
validity of the Rule 226 of the IREC Vol.I and Railway Board circular
dated 30.10.1998 and 2.11.2998 had already been upheld by this
court in W.P. (C) No. 3942/2006 and W.P. (C) No. 14596-97/2004.
13.

The Tribunal rejected the OA filed by the Petitioner since

the transfer is not only an incident but a condition of Government
service. The power to make appointment includes the power to make
appointment by transfer.

any

such

administrative decisions except in a few exceptional cases, such as
incompetency of the authority effecting transfer, mala fides or breach
of Statutory Rules. The Tribunal noted that in the present case, the
original order of transfer was issued on 13.5.2002 i.e. within one year
of the confirmation of the order of penalty by the Appellate Authority
on 21.8.2001.

However the said transfer was the interdicted by the

orders of the Tribunal repeatedly. Consequently, the present OA was
held not to be a case where the inter divisional transfer was being
effected after a long laps of time from the time the penalty was
inflicted upon the Petitioner. The Tribunal noted the fact that the
periodic transfer to Badli was effected in good faith and without being
aware of the fact that the O.A. No.3061/2002 had been dismissed by
W.P. (C) No. 6603/2007

Page 6 of 13

the Tribunal on 30th May 2003.
14.

Having considered the matter we are of the view that the

impugned order passed by the Tribunal dismissing the Petitioner's O.A.
No.2581/2006 is unimpeachable and does not call for interference in
the exercise of our powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India of judicial review. The O.A. No.3061/2002 filed by the Petitioner
challenging his inter divisional transfer was disposed of on 30th May
2003 with the following observations:

“10. Contentions put forth by the applicant is
that as Rule 226 of IREC envisaged transfer on
administrative exigency and no exigency of
service shown, the administrative instructions in
the form of Board's letter dated 2.11.1998
cannot override or being inconsistent with the
statutory rules cannot be countenanced. What
has been laid down in Rule 226 of IREC is an
empowerment to the General Manager to effect
inter-divisional
transfer
in
administrative
exigency. As no broad guide-lines have been
laid down by way of Railway Board's circular
dated 2.11.1998 which has been made
applicable to staff in mass contact areas on
being detected to be indulging in malpractices,
transfer is to be resorted. This has a rational
object sought to be achieved behind it, as the
corrupt staff should not be kept at a particular
place to perpetuate their ill motives. In so far as
malpractices are concerned, the same are
defined in the case of Smt. Santosh Meena
Vs. Union of India and another (OA
1587/2002) decided on 24.1.2003 as to whether
the inter-divisional transfer include the bad
conduct, which is a matter of dishonesty by a
conduct with a view to have illegal gains. As the
applicant was admittedly in mass contact area
working
as
Senior
Booking
Clerk,
the
malpractices with the allegation of corrupt
W.P. (C) No. 6603/2007

Page 7 of 13

practices has been amply proved for being
awarded the major punishment and the same
was confirmed in appeal. There is no doubt that
his transfer is well covered under the Board
decision of the Railway Board laid down under
circular dated 2.11.1998. The Division Bench in
V.K. Gupta's case (supra) while discussing the
import of instructions dated 2.11.1998, have
made the following observations:
“15. But
while
reading
the
instructions of the department that
have been issued from time to time
and reproduced above, it is obvious
that the circulars of 13.4.1967 and
30.10.1998 do not provide that
inter-divisional transfer would be
conducted against persons who
have repeatedly figured in vigilance
cases but where penalty had been
imposed to say that the circular of
2.11.1998 flows from the same
meeting and must have the same
effect would not be correct. On
basis of the said circular, an
exception has been drawn. Ticket
Checking Staff detected to be
indulging in malpractices had been
taken to be an exception and it was
provided that in terms of the
existing instructions, such staff is
required to be invariably sent on
inter-divisional/inter-railway transfer
as a matter of policy. The
expression “invariably sent on interdivisional/inter-railway transfer” is
the
colour and strength of this
circular. The words, “in terms of the
existing instructions” seem to be
redundant. Otherwise, there was no
occasion for providing for invariable
transfers on inter-divisional/interrailway basis. The said circular
necessarily has to be read so as to
find out the true meaning of the
same. It is obvious that what was
W.P. (C) No. 6603/2007

Page 8 of 13

provided was that so far as Ticket
Checking Staff detected to be
indulging
in
malpractices
is
concerned,
they
could
be
transferred on inter-divisional/interrailway basis. This becomes clear
from paragraph 3 of the said circular
which provides that existing policy
of
inter-divisional/inter-railway
transfer of ticket checking staff
detected
to
be
indulging
in
malpractices shall continue and
other staff in mass contact areas
detected
to
be
indulging
in
malpractices
should
also
be
transferred on inter-divisional basis.
Therefore for such type of staff
working with the Railways, it is not
necessary that in terms of the
instructions of 30.10.1998, penalties
must have been imposed before
conducting the transfers. The view
to the contrary, therefore, so taken
shall be said to be correct.
11. As regards the issue of instructions being
inconsistent,
it
is
settled
by
various
pronouncements of the Apex Court. The
administrative instructions supplementing the
rules are valid as well as enforceable as per
Rule 226 of IREC does not lay down or define
administrative exigency. Board's letter dated
2.11.1998 which supplement the rule cannot be
declared inconsistent as held by the Apex Court
in Union of India Vs. H.R. Patankar 1984
Supp. SCC 359. I do not find any inconsistency
in the Railway Board's letter with that of
statutory rules.
12. Transfer is also an incidence of service
and cannot be termed as penalty. There is no
requirement of issuance of show-cause notice
before the transfer is effected which is in the
interest of the administration.
13.
W.P. (C) No. 6603/2007

The Board's letter has been issued laying
Page 9 of 13

down the policy guide-lines of which vires is
upheld by the decision of the Division Bench,
which is binding on me. The contention put forth
on issue of inconsistency of the instructions with
statutory rules has already been dealt with by
the Division Bench cannot be countenanced exfacie. The instructions are in accordance with
rules.
14. In the result, for the foregoing reasons, as
the transfer is in accordance with the rules, in a
judicial review it does not lie within the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal to sit as an appellate
authority over it and stall the wheel of
administration being
run
smoothly.
The
aforesaid observation gain support from the
decision of the Apex Court in the case of State
Bank of India Vs. Anjan Sanyal, 2001 (5)
SCC 508. OA is accordingly dismissed. Interim
order granted on 28.11.2002 is vacated.”
15.

Consequently, the applicability of Rule 226 of the IREC and

the relevant Board Circular to the Petitioner's case stands conclusively
established since the Petitioner accepted the order passed in O.A.
No.3061/2002 and did not impugn the same any further.

16.

It was the Respondent's case before the Tribunal that the

said order of dismissal dated 30th May 2003 in O.A. No.3061/2002 did
not come to their notice and consequently, the Petitioner continued to
be retained in Delhi despite the vacation of the interim stay on his inter
divisional transfer.

The ground of discrimination taken by the

Petitioner does not impress us since it is not stated that the case of
Smt. Indira was a case of inter divisional transfer, consequent upon
imposition of penalty on corruption charge in mass contact area. The
W.P. (C) No. 6603/2007

Page 10 of 13

case of Shri Deepak Kumar vs. Union of India and others, O.A. No.
786/2002 also relied upon by the Petitioner,

was a case of inter

divisional transfer during the pendency of departmental proceedings,
and not after the conclusion of departmental proceedings and
imposition of penalty, as is the case of the Petitioner. The inter
divisional transfer in case of Petitioner cannot be said to be stigmatic
since it is the penalty order against the Petitioner which is stigmatic,
and the inter divisional transfer of the Petitioner is only a consequence
thereof, as permitted by law. Consequently, we accept the position
that the Respondent remained unaware of the passing of the order
dated 30th May, 2003 whereby OA No.3061/2002 was dismissed and
the stay on the inter divisional transfer of the Petitioner vacated.
Unaware of the fact of the dismissal of the aforesaid OA, periodic
transfer from Delhi to Badli was given to the Petitioner.

17.

We agree with the findings of the Tribunal that the inter

divisional transfer of the Petitioner was in compliance of the Rules. The
reliance placed by the Petitioner on the decision of this court in W.P.
(C) No. 3522/2007 in Union of India and others vs. Shri Rajinder
Singh decided on May 11, 2007 is of no avail, since the facts in that
case were materially different from those of the present case. In
Rajinder Singh (Supra) the penalty was awarded to the employee on 7th
November 2003. Even though he was transferred in public interest on
19th February 2004, he was not relieved. Thereafter he was given a
W.P. (C) No. 6603/2007

Page 11 of 13

periodic transfer on 17.5.2005. It was only on 11.11.2005, i.e. after
over two years of order of penalty that his inter divisional transfer was
effected. It was on account of the belated inter divisional transfer,
effected more than two years after the imposition of penalty, and also
on account of the fact that the Tribunal while quashing the inter
divisional transfer observed that he may be given a post where he
does not have any mass or public contact, that this, court dismissed
the writ petition filed by the Union of India. It is not the Petitioner's
case that he brought the order of dismissal of O.A. No.3061/2002 to
the notice of the Respondent at an earlier stage, or that there was any
other material available on record to show that the Competent
Authority was in fact aware of passing of the order dated 30 th May
2003 soon after it was passed and that the authority consciously
decided to continue with the services of the Petitioner in Delhi even
after being aware of the order passed in O.A. No.3061/2002 dated
30.5.2003.

18.

In our view, the Petitioner cannot be permitted to take

advantage of the fact that his inter divisional

transfer order passed

was back on 13th May, 2002 could not be given effect to due to the
repeated stays

obtained by him by filing one Original Application

application after another, and the fact that the Respondent remained
in the dark about the dismissal of OA No.3061/2002 on 30thy May,
2003.

The inter divisional transfer in such cases has a purpose to

W.P. (C) No. 6603/2007

serve, as noted herein above, and though it should have been given
effect to earlier, the same did not
facts noted herein above.
19.

happen due to the sequence of

In our view, its better late than never.

In view of our aforesaid discussion, we dismiss this

writ petition since the order of the Tribunal does not call for any
interference. We leave the parties to bear their own costs.
