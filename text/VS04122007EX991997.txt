VIPIN SANGHI, J.
:
1.

By this order I propose to dispose of E.A. No.297/1994 in

Execution petition No.99 of 1997.
2.

Brief factual matrix of the case is that the Decree

Holder in the Execution Petition 99/1997 had filed a summary suit
under Order XXXVII CPC for recovery of Rs.32,06,164 along with
E.A.297/04 in EX.P. NO. 99 OF 1997

Page 1 of 9

pendente lite and future interest against the Judgment Debtor
company. The suit was decreed vide judgment and order dated
22.5.1996. The said order was challenged up to the Supreme Court
wherein the SLP preferred by the Judgment Debtor came to be
dismissed on 24th January 1997. The above execution petition was
filed on 5.5.1997 for recovery of the said decretal amount of
Rs.32,06,164/- along with interest @ 24% both pendente lite and
future. Pursuant thereto warrants of attachments were issued in
respect of the property and assets as disclosed by the decree holder.
However, the money could not be recovered and the Judgment Debtor
gave assurance on various dates to the court that the decretal
amount would be deposited in the court. E.A. No.273 of 1997 was
filed on 30.8.1997 under Order 21 Rule 41 in which one Shri Darshan
Kumar and one Shri Rajiv Kumar were also arrayed as Judgment
Debtors since they were the Directors of the Judgment Debtor
company. On 10.8.1998 during his examination before the Court, the
said Shri Rajiv Kumar deposed that he owned movable property worth
Rs.5 lakhs and had a deposit of only Rs.6,000 in the Punjab & Sind
Bank Branch of Kailash Colony, New Delhi. It was also deposed that
he neither had his own house nor any share in any immovable
property. He further deposed that his father owned a plot in Uttam
Nagar.
3.

In the meanwhile, various part payments were made

E.A.297/04 in EX.P. NO. 99 OF 1997

Page 2 of 9

from time to time in partial satisfaction of the decree. On 12.11.2003,
Mr. Rajiv Kumar appeared before the court and had requested for
final opportunity for making the payment. Time was again sought on
24.11.2004 pleading financial constraint.

EA No.297 of 2004 was

preferred by the Decree Holder praying for the arrest and detention
of Shri Darshan Kumar and Shri Rajiv Kumar, Directors of the
Judgment Debtor Company who were arrayed as Judgment Debtors 2
and 3 in the applicationf, in civil prison in exercise of the Court's
powers in execution of a decree under section 55 read with Order 21
Rule 37 and section 151 of CPC. Since none appeared on 23.4.2007
on

behalf

of

the

Judgment

Debtor

Company

when

the

said

application was listed, the Court ordered issuance of warrants of
arrest against the said Directors of the Judgment Debtor company.
Thereafter EA Nos.307-308/2007 were preferred by the said directors
praying for cancellation and stay of the said warrants of arrest. Same
were allowed subject to payment of costs. However, I find that due to
a typographical error there applications continue to be shown in
subsequent orders as well.

Thereafter, arguments were advanced

and orders reserved in EA No.297/2004.
4.

The main contention of the Petitioner is that the

Judgment Debtor company is being managed by the respondent No.
2 and 3 being the Managing Director and/or Director of the said
company. The said company is de-facto owned and controlled by
E.A.297/04 in EX.P. NO. 99 OF 1997

Page 3 of 9

these Directors who belong to the same family and the company is
functioning

more like a

partnership firm. When the warrants of

attachments were issued against the Judgment Debtor company, the
Judgment Debtor – 2 and 3 obstructed the said warrants of
attachments. They also made statements before the court giving
assurance of payment and undertaking the payment of the decretal
amount. The funds of the company have been siphoned off by these
Judgment Debtors

and they are now falsely claiming that the

company is sans any funds. Therefore, these Judgment Debtors being
the real owners, who have siphoned of the funds of the company are
liable to be proceeded against in accordance with law by lifting the
corporate veil.
5.

Judgment Debtors have in their reply stated that they

have the intention of honouring the decree and have taken all
possible steps to pay the principal amount and Rs.10,50,000/- have
been paid to the Decree Holder uptil now. It is submitted that

respondent No. 3 Rajiv Kumar has been taking a petty job at a
meager salary of Rs.7,000 - 8,000/-

per month and is without any

means to pay the decretal amount. Therefore, the question of willful
refusal to honour the decree does not arise. It is argued that it would
be against the mandate of Section 51 read with Order 21 Rule 37 CPC
to arrest and detain him and his arrest and detention would be
violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It is also contended
E.A.297/04 in EX.P. NO. 99 OF 1997

Page 4 of 9

that the application itself is an abuse and of process of law,
inasmuch as, the respondent No.2 and 3 were not parties in the suit
as filed and neither any relief was claimed against them in the said
suit, nor has the court while pronouncing its judgment and preparing
a decree granted any relief against the said respondents personally.
Therefore, the application, inasmuch as, it labels the respondents as
Judgment Debtors/respondents is misconceived and no relief can be
granted against them. Reliance has been placed upon M/s. Maruti
Limited Chandigarh vs. Pan India Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, reported
as AIR 1993 P&H 215. Judgment Debtor and the respondents have no
intention to avoid the payment of the decretal amount. In that view of
the matter, the application is liable to be rejected.
6.

Under Section 51 CPC before the court can order a

Judgment Debtor to be detained in prison, the court has to be
satisfied
“(a)

that the Judgment Debtor, with the object
or effect of obstructing or delaying
the execution of the decree, (i)

is likely to abscond or leave the local
limits of the jurisdiction of the court, or

(ii)

has, after the institution of the suit in
which the decree was passed,
dishonestly transferred, concealed, or
removed any part of his property, or
committed any other act of bad faith
in relation to his property, or

E.A.297/04 in EX.P. NO. 99 OF 1997

Page 5 of 9

(b)

(c)

7.

that the judgment debtor has, or has had
since the date of the decree, the means to pay
the amount of the decree or some substantial
part thereof and refuses or neglects or has
refused or neglected to pay the same, or
that the decree is for a sum for which the
Judgment Debtor was bound in a fiduciary
capacity to account.”

Order 21 Rule 11A requires the Decree Holder to state,

in his application under Section 51 read with Order 21 Rule 37 CPC ,
the grounds on which arrest of the Judgment Debtor is being sought.
In the present case, the grounds stated in the application of the
Decree Holder are that the said respondents are liable to satisfy the
decree; that they have the means to do so and they are avoiding to
satisfy the decree. It is further stated that they are liable to be
arrested for not complying to the undertaking given to the court. The
Decree Holder has sought to rely on various financial statements of
the Judgment Debtor company to make out a case of siphoning of the
funds by its Directors with a view to dishonestly remove the assets
and commit acts in bad faith in relation to the property of the
company with a view to defeat the impending decree in favour of the
Decree Holder during the pendency of the suit. No doubt, the
statement of affairs of the Judgment Debtor company shows that not
only prior to filing of the suit, but even thereafter its debts kept on
mounting. That by itself is not enough to reach to the conclusion that
there was a dishonest transfer or removal of the assets and funds of
E.A.297/04 in EX.P. NO. 99 OF 1997

Page 6 of 9

the company, or that the Directors of the company acted in bad faith
in relation to the property of the company. In business, an enterprise
may suffer losses, and it cannot be assumed that the losses are a
result of deliberate siphoning or defalcation of funds and assets of the
company by its Directors and Managers. The stand of the Directors of
the Judgment Debtor company is that it suffered business losses over
the years and slipped into the red. It is worth noting that the
shareholders of the company, in fact, infused funds into the company
by raising the share application money of the company from 1.4.2000
onwards. It rose from 1,58,000/- to Rs.5,58,000 on 31.1.2001 and to
Rs.7,20,000/- as on 31.3.2003.
8.

In my view, the Decree Holder has not disclosed

sufficient material on record to enable me to give a finding that the
Judgment Debtor company and its Directors, who are defendant No. 2
and 3 in the aforesaid application, have acted with the object of
obstructing or delaying in execution of the decree. Though averments
have been made that the said respondents have started another
business in the name of M/s. Infonet India Pvt. Ltd;

that they are

maintaining high standard of living and that they own properties in
Uttam Nagar, New Delhi. The decree holder has failed to establish on
record that the business of M/s. Infonet India Pvt. Ltd was started by
siphoning off the funds from the Judgment Debtor company. The
contention that the breach of undertakings given to the Court also

E.A.297/04 in EX.P. NO. 99 OF 1997

Page 7 of 9

tantamounts to contempt of Court and, therefore, the said individuals
be detained in prison can be dealt with in a duly instituted contempt
petition.

The decree holder may, if it is so advised, prefer such a

petition. However, the breach of an undertaking to the Court cannot
be a ground to involve Section 51 CP.C. Consequently, in my view the
present application is liable to be dismissed and I do so accordingly.
9.

In my view, the reliance placed by the Judgment Debtor/

Respondent on M/s. Maruti Limited, Chandigarh (supra) would not be
relevant, in case the Respondents Directors of the Judgment Debtor
company have, in fact, siphoned off the funds of the Judgment Debtor
company for the purpose of delaying or obstructing the execution of
the decree in question as there cannot be hard and fast rule that in no
case the Directors of Judgment Debtor company can be held to be
liable under Section 51 C.P.C for the non compliance of the decree
against the company.
10.

However, the dismissal of the application will not

preclude the Decree Holder from filing further applications for similar
relief with better particulars. Considering the fact that the Decree
Holder has disclosed that the Directors of the Judgment Debtor
company have started a new business in the name of M/s. Infonet
India Pvt. Ltd.

I direct the Judgment Debtor company and its

directors, namely Shri Darshan Kumar and Shri Rajiv Kumar to file
affidavit disclosing the following :
E.A.297/04 in EX.P. NO. 99 OF 1997

Page 8 of 9

i)

The date of incorporation of M/s. Infonet India Pvt.

Ltd and the name of the promoter shareholders and the
initial Directors of the said company.
ii)

The

names

of

the

present

shareholders

and

Directors of M/s. Infonet India Pvt. Ltd.
iii)

The annual accounts and balance sheets and

income tax returns of M/s. Infonet India Pvt. Ltd filed from inception
till date.
11.

With the aforesaid directions, the present application

is dismissed.
