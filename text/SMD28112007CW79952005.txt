1.

The Petitioner has a warehouse in Faridabad, Haryana. On 1st March,

2001 certain garments imported by M/s. Kushang Apparels were warehoused
in the petitioner‟s warehouse.

Despite the warehouse period, in terms of

Section 61 of the Customs Act, 1962 („the Act‟), expiring on 28th February,
2002 the customs authorities did not initiate action under Section 72 of the Act
requiring the owner to pay the customs duty failing which the goods could be
sold to recover the customs duty. Meanwhile, the petitioner, acting under
Section 63(2) of the Act, sought to put the goods to sale by way of auction.
After four failed attempts at getting the minimum value price fixed by the
WP(C) 7995/2005

Page 1 of 12

customs authorities, the goods were finally sold by auction with the consent of
the customs authorities on 31st August, 2004. The amount recovered by way of
auction was Rs.41,44,555/-. According to the petitioner, he spent an amount of
Rs.2,05,329/- on the auction and this was deducted by him from the sum
recovered in the auction.

2.

On the basis that M/s. Kushang Apparels had imported CTV kits valued

at Rs.1,23,63,259/- (CIF) and filed 6 inward bills of entry on 9th February,
2001, the customs authorities determined the customs duty payable at
Rs.67,17,916/-.

The said goods were warehoused after execution of the

necessary bonds on 1st March, 2001. The goods were not however cleared by
M/s. Kushang Apparels within the warehousing period and nor was any
extension sought. The customs department issued notices to M/s. Kushang
Apparels on 16th April, 2004 under Section 72 (1) of the Act calling upon it to
pay the customs duty. A reminder was sent on 25th May, 2004.

3.

Meanwhile, the petitioner wrote to the customs department seeking

permission for clearance of the goods that had to be delivered to M/s. Reliable
Overseas who had successfully bid for the goods put to auction by the
petitioner in terms of Section 63 (2) of the Act.

However, the customs

authorities insisted that, under Section 150 of the Act, the entire auction
proceeds had to be first adjusted towards the customs duty. Accordingly, on
27th October, 2004 the customs authorities wrote to the petitioner asking him to
first deposit the appropriate customs duty and then approach the Assistant
Commissioner, ICD, Faridabad for a no objection certificate for giving delivery
of the goods to M/s. Reliable Overseas.
WP(C) 7995/2005

4.

The petitioner replied on 3rd November, 2004 contending that

appropriate duty worked out to Rs.16,64,073/- as per tariff rules and M/s.
Reliable Overseas should be permitted to take delivery of the goods on
payment of this amount.

This was contested by the customs department.

Meanwhile, the warehousing charges kept mounting. The charges as on 10th
September, 2004 were Rs.13,84,434/-. In a letter dated 29th December, 2004 to
the customs authorities the petitioner pointed out that the auction sale for
recovery of the warehousing charges had taken place with the approval of the
customs authorities and that the outstanding charges were adjusted against the
auction proceeds. In a further letter dated 28th January, 2005 the Petitioner
contended that it was ready to pay the entire customs duty as calculated and
furnish a bank guarantee for the remaining amount.

5.

The Assistant Commissioner, ICD, Faridabad wrote to the petitioner on

2nd/4th February, 2005 affirming that the petitioner‟s proposal to release the
goods to the successful bidder M/s. Reliable Overseas provisionally on
furnishing a bank guarantee had been accepted by the department. The
petitioner was asked to deposit an amount of Rs.11,92,080/- towards duty after
deducting Rs.2,05,329/- towards expenses. For the balance amount of
Rs.27,47,146/-, the petitioner was asked to furnish a bank guarantee so that the
auctioned goods could be cleared by M/s. Reliable Overseas.

6.

By its letter dated 7th February, 2005 to the customs department, the

petitioner informed that they were paying Rs.11,92,080/- towards the customs
duty and that they were also furnishing a bank guarantee of Rs.27,47,146/- to
WP(C) 7995/2005

Page 3 of 12

facilitate the clearance of the goods. Thereafter the CBEC by the impugned
letter dated 17th February, 2005 rejected the Petitioner‟s contention in its letter
dated 29th December, 2004 in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Kesoram Rayon v. Collector of Customs (1996) ELT 464 (SC). This is the
first impugned letter.

7.

The Petitioner wrote to the Commissioner of Customs on 18 th February,

2005 informing her that the cargo had been delivered to M/s. Reliable Overseas
and that the Petitioner was awaiting the final decision in the matter. The
Petitioner wrote a reminder to the customs department on 24 th February, 2005
requesting that the customs department should pass a speaking order to enable
the Petitioner to avail the remedy by way of an appeal.

The customs

department by its letter dated 4th March, 2005 reiterated that the auction sale
held by the Petitioner pursuant to Section 63 of the Act was not acceptable.
Accordingly, the Petitioner was once again asked to deposit the remaining
amount of Rs.27,47,146/-. It was further pointed out that if the amount was not
so deposited forthwith the bank guarantee furnished would be encashed
without any further notice. A further reminder was sent by the Department to
the Petitioner on 16th March, 2005.

8.

On 19th April, 2005 the Additional Commissioner (CCU) informed the

petitioner that its representation made on 18th March, 2005 could not be
entertained since the Chief Commissioner was of the view that the matter stood
settled with the Board‟s clarification of 17th February, 2005 and the
Commissioner was required to recover the outstanding arrears of customs duty
in accordance with the law. This is the second impugned letter.
WP(C) 7995/2005

Page 4 of 12

9.

On 29th April, 2005 the customs authorities enforced the bank guarantee

given by the petitioner and encashed the sum of Rs.27,47,146/-.

10.

It is at this stage that the petitioner filed the present writ petition in this

Court seeking inter alia a direction to quash the letter dated 17 th February, 2005
of Central Board of Excise & Customs („CBEC‟) and the letter dated 19th
April, 2005 of the Chief Commissioner, Central Excise. A writ of mandamus
was also sought for directing the respondent to return to the petitioner a sum of
Rs.11,92,080/- together with interest thereon. The petitioner also sought a
direction to the respondent to revoke the bank guarantee for Rs.27,47,146/-.

11.

The stand taken by the respondents in the short counter affidavit is that

the respondents had never demanded customs duty from the petitioner but had
only required the petitioner to deposit the balance amount of the auction sale
proceeds. It is contended that since the customs duty to be recovered from the
importer was more than the sale proceeds, the customs department was entitled
to treat the sale proceeds towards customs duty only. It is disputed that the
goods were auctioned in terms of Section 63 of the Act. A reference is made to
Section 150 of the Act which indicates the manner in which the sale proceeds
have to be appropriated.

12.

The first question to be examined is whether the petitioner was entitled

to invoke the powers under Section 63 (2) of the Act to recover the
warehousing charges or whether the customs authorities were justified, in
terms of Section 72 of the Act, in demanding the entire customs duty and
WP(C) 7995/2005

Page 5 of 12

appropriating the entire sale proceeds in the auction sale towards customs duty
payable.

13.

The sequence of events narrated above shows that it was the petitioner

who had been pursuing the matter of non-payment of customs duty to the
department or warehousing charges to it by the importer M/s. Kushang
Apparels. It is also not disputed that the petitioner initiated proceedings to
have the goods sold by way of auction under Section 63 (2) of the Act in order
to first appropriate the warehousing charges from the sale proceeds. Section 63
reads as under:
“Section 63
Payment of rent and warehouse charges:
(1) The owner of any warehoused goods shall pay to
the warehouse-keeper rent and warehouse charges at
the rates fixed under any law for the time being in
force or where no rates are so fixed, at such rates as
may be fixed by the Commissioner of Customs.
(2) If any rent or warehouse charges are not paid
within ten days from the date when they became due,
the warehouse keeper may, after notice to the owner
of the warehoused goods and with the permission of
the proper officer cause to be sold (any transfer of the
warehoused goods notwithstanding) such sufficient
portion of the goods as the warehouse-keeper may
select.”

14.

It appears that between March 2002 to December 2003 three auctions

and one tender sale were attempted but the bid amount was less than the
minimum price fixed by the customs authorities. Therefore, the sale by way of
auction could not take place. It was in the second round in the sale held in
August 2004 in which M/s. Reliable Overseas was the highest bidder at
Rs.41,44,555/-.
WP(C) 7995/2005

15.

The relevant provisions of the Act indicate that clearing of the

warehoused goods for home consumption has to be done by the importer of
such warehoused goods in terms of Section 68 thereof. Section 68 reads as
under:

“Section 68
Clearance of
consumption-

warehoused

goods

for

home

The importer of any warehoused goods may
clear them for home consumption, if –
(a) A bill of entry for home consumption in respect of
such goods has been presented in the prescribed
form;
(b) the import duty leviable on such goods and all
penalties, rent, interest and other charges payable in
respect of such goods have been paid; and
(c) an order for clearance of such goods for home
consumption has been made by the proper officer.
Provided that the owner of any warehoused goods
may, at any time before an order for clearance of
goods home consumption has been made in respect
of such goods, relinquish his title to the goods upon
payment of rent, interest, other charges and penalties
that may be payable in respect of the goods and upon
such relinquishment, he shall not be liable to pay
duty thereon.
Provided further that the owner of any such
warehoused goods shall not be allowed to relinquish
has title to such goods regarding which an offence
appears to have been committed under this Act or any
other law for the time being in force.”

The other relevant provision is Section 72 which reads as under:
“Section 72
Goods improperly removed from warehouse, etc.
WP(C) 7995/2005

Page 7 of 12

(1) In any of the following cases, that is to say, (a) where any warehoused goods are
removed from a warehouse in contravention of
Section 71;
(b) where any warehoused goods have not been
removed from a warehouse at the expiration of
the period during which such goods are
permitted under Section 61 to remain in a
warehouse;
(c) where any warehoused goods have been
taken under Section 64 as samples without
payment of duty;
(d) where any goods in respect of which a bond
has been executed under Section 49 and which
have not been cleared for home consumption
or exportation are not duly accounted for to the
satisfaction of the proper officer,
the proper officer may demand, and the owner of such
goods shall forthwith pay, the full amount of duly
chargeable on account of such goods together with all
penalties, rent, interest and other charges payable in
respect of such goods.
(2)
If an owner fails to pay any amount demanded
under sub-section (1), the proper officer may, without
prejudice to any other remedy, cause to be detained
and sold, after notice to the owner (any transfer of the
goods notwithstanding) such sufficient portion of his
goods, if any, in the warehouse, as the said officer
may select.”

Section 72 comes into play when goods are sought to be improperly removed
from the warehouse. In the event of such improper removal the owner of the
goods can be asked to forthwith pay, the full amount of duty chargeable on
account of such goods together with all penalties, rent, interest and other
charges payable in respect of such goods.

16.

It appears that on the facts of the present case the occasion to invoke

WP(C) 7995/2005

Page 8 of 12

Section 72 (1)(d) would arise only if the goods in respect of which a bond has
been executed has not been cleared for home consumption. In such event, the
owner of the goods can be asked to pay the entire duty. This obviously does
not apply to the warehouse-keeper like the petitioner and no demand of
payment for customs duty can be made against the petitioner.

17.

Learned counsel for the Revenue has sought to justify the demand raised

against the Petitioner in the impugned letters by referring to Section 150 of the
Act which reads as under:
“Section 150
Procedure for sale of goods and application of sale
proceeds:-

(1) Where any goods not being confiscated goods are
to be sold under any provision of this Act, they shall,
after notice to the owner thereof, be sold by public
auction or by tender or with the consent of the owner
in any other manner.
(2) The proceeds of any such sale shall be applied –
(a)

firstly to the payment of the expenses of the
sale,

(b)

next to the payment of the freight and other
charges, if any, payable in respect of the goods
sold, to the carrier, if notice of such charges
has been given to the person having custody of
the goods,

(c)

next to the payment of the duty, if any, on the
goods sold,
next to the payment of the charges in respect of
the goods sold due to the person having the
custody of the goods,

(d)

(e)

WP(C) 7995/2005

next to the payment of any amount due from
the owner of the goods to the Central
Government under the provisions of this Act or
any other law relating to customs, and the
balance, if any, shall be paid to the owner of
Page 9 of 12

the goods.”

18.

The reference to Section 150 concerning the application of sale proceeds

in an auction cannot really help the Revenue in the instant case. Section 63 is a
specific provision concerning warehousing charges. It may be recalled that the
auction took place for the purposes of recovering the warehousing duties and
not for the purpose of recovering the customs duty in terms of Section 72 of the
Act.

It is also not possible to read Section 150 (2)(b) as permitting

appropriation of the sale proceeds towards the outstanding customs duty after
meeting the expenses of the sale. The words “and other charges, if any,
payable in respect of the sale goods to the carrier, if the notice of such charges
has been given to the person having custody of the goods” makes it clear that
this does not pertain to customs duty. Section 150 (2)(d) of the Act which talks
of “payment of the charges in respect of the goods sold due to the person
having custody of the goods” is referable to payment of warehousing charges
and it takes precedence over recovery of customs duty which is relatable to
Section 150 (2) (e) of the Act. Viewed from this angle, the right of the
petitioner here to recover the warehousing charges from the sale proceeds
appears superior to the right of the Revenue to recover customs duty.

19.

The reliance placed by learned counsel for the Revenue on the judgment

of the Supreme Court in Kesoram Rayon is misplaced.

There was no

discussion in the said judgment about the recovery of the warehousing charges.
The issue involved the liability of the importer in terms of Section 72 of the
Act. It was held by the Supreme Court as under: (para 13 pg 471)
“13. Goods which are not removed from a warehouse
within the permissible period are treated as goods
improperly removed from the warehouse. Such
WP(C) 7995/2005

Page 10 of 12

improper removal takes place when the goods remain
in the warehouse beyond the permitted period or its
permitted extension. The importer of the goods may
be called upon to pay customs duty on them and,
necessarily, it would be payable at the rate applicable
on the date of their deemed removal from the
warehouse, that is, the date on which the permitted
period or its permitted extension came to an end.”

The above passage does not support the proposition, as suggested by the
Revenue, that the warehouse-keeper “can be asked to first appropriate the
auction proceeds only towards the customs duty”.

20.

We therefore hold that the Petitioner was justified in recovering the

warehousing charges due to it from the auction sale proceeds in terms of
Section 63 (2) of the Act. The balance amount deposited with the Government
Treasury can be adjusted by the customs department towards part payment of
customs duty as computed by it.

21.

There does not appear to be any legal justification for the Respondent

encashing the bank guarantee in the sum of Rs.27,47,146/-. The Petitioner
cannot be saddled with the liability to pay the customs duty which is
recoverable from the importer M/s. Kushang Apparels particularly when it is
not the case of the Respondents that the Petitioner and M/s. Kushang Apparels
have any commonality of business interests or are related entities.

22.

For the above reasons, this Court holds that the demands raised against

the Petitioner in the impugned letters dated 17th February, 2005 issued by the
Respondent No.2 and dated 19th April, 2005 issued by the Respondent No.3 are
without the authority of law and quashes them accordingly. Consequently, the
WP(C) 7995/2005

Page 11 of 12

following directions are issued:
(i)

The Respondents will refund to the petitioner a sum of
Rs.27,47,146/- together interest @ 12% per annum till the date of
payment. The sum

will be paid to the Petitioner within four

weeks from today and in any event not later than 15th January,
2008.
(ii)

Any delay in making the payment beyond the above stipulated
period, will result in the respondents, apart from being liable for
contempt of court, paying to the petitioner penal interest @ 18%
per annum for the period of delay;

(iii)

The Respondents will pay to the Petitioner costs of Rs.5,000/within a period of four weeks from today and in any event not
later than 15th January, 2008.

23.

The writ petition is accordingly allowed with the aforesaid directions.

The pending applications also stand disposed of.
24.

List for compliance on 17th January, 2008.
