CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJIV KHANNA
ORDER

1. In 1979 the petitioner applied and got himself registered under NPRS,
1979.
2. In 1990 the petitioner was allotted a flat in Rohini on hire-purchase
basis. The petitioner did not accept the said allotment and deposited
cancellation charges on 8.2.1991.
3. The respondent/DDA accepted the cancellation charges and vide their
letter dated 21.10.1991 informed the petitioner that his registration
continues to be alive but he would be allotted a flat at the tail end.
4. It is admitted case of the parties that in March, 2004 tail end priority
cases were put in draw of lot and flats were allotted to all persons
similarly situated as the petitioner. It is also the admitted case of the

respondent/DDA that by mistake the petitioner’s name was not included
in the draw of lots in March, 2004, therefore, no allotment could be
made to him.
5. The petitioner on coming to know about the default made by DDA made
number of representations from 2004 onwards requesting DDA to allot
him an MIG flat. Some of these representations dated 22.9.2004,
4.4.2005, 5.5.2005, 31.5.2005 and 8.7.2005 have been placed on
record. Respondent/DDA does not dispute the said representations
also.
6. After notice was issued on this writ petition respondent/DDA issued
demand cum allotment letter dated 5.9.2006 thereby allotting a flat to
the petitioner at Rohini, but the petitioner has been asked to pay costs
of Rs.17,17,126/-.
7. The petitioner has filed an additional affidavit impugning the said cost.
No reply/counter affidavit to the writ petition or the additional affidavit
has been filed till date. Notice in the writ petition was issued on 1st June,
2006 and the additional affidavit was filed on 12.2.2007. I may mention
here that in the Order dated 27.2.2007, the court had specifically
recorded the contention of the petitioner that allotment should have
been made to him at the cost prevalent in 2004, when tail end priority of
the petitioner had matured and the counsel for the respondent was

asked to get instructions and file affidavit within two weeks. As already
stated above no affidavit has been filed by DDA.
8. It is clear from the above facts that DDA has been negligent and
wrongly failed to include the petitioner’s name in the draw of lots which
was held in March, 2004. The petitioner is not to be blamed for the said
failure.

In fact, the petitioner had brought to the notice of the

respondent/DDA lapse on their part by writing letters in 2004 and 2005.
In these circumstances, I do not think the petitioner should be asked to
pay cost as was prevalent on the date of issue of allotment letter on
5.9.2006. Additional cost cannot be levied on the petitioner for
negligence and lapse on the part of DDA. The mistake was made by
DDA and therefore additional burden should also fall on DDA and
cannot be passed on to the petitioner who has been waiting for
allotment of a flat from 1979 onwards. There is also no explanation as to
why immediate steps were not taken by DDA after the petitioner had
written letters in 2004-2005. The registrant/petitioner cannot be saddled
with higher liability. Similar view has been taken by this court in Civil
Writ no.4859/2000 decided on 29 August, 2002 in case titled “Mohinder
Malik Vs. DDA”. In the said judgment reliance was placed upon the
Division Bench decision in the case of “J S Rao (Prof.) Vs. DDA and

Ors.” reported in 2001 (1) AD Delhi 235 wherein it was observed as
under :
“10. In that view of the matter we are of the considered
opinion that the mistake for not entering of name of the
petitioner in the draw of lots held for allotment of a flat at
Vasant Kunj was because the Delhi Development Authority
inadvertently did not include his name in the draw of lots.
Therefore, for the mistake of the respondent the petitioner
cannot be deprived of his right of allotment of a flat and
cannot be saddled with higher liability. As SFS flat of similar
nature has been kept reserved for the petitioner pursuant to
interim orders passed by this court. It is brought on record
that the project for which the applications were invited on
1989 and 1990 were completed in the year 1992. The
petitioner filed his applications for allotment of flat in 1989
and 1990 and the said project as against which he filed his
applications came to be completed in the year 1992 and
therefore, the petitioner is liable to pay the price of the flat
prevailing in the year 1992.”

9. Reliance can also be made to two other decisions of this court in
“Subhash Chander Sethi Vs. DDA” being C.W.no.11654/2006, which
was decided on 20th March, 2007 and “Jay Prakash Vs. DDA” being
C.W.no.20250/2005.
10.

In view of the above findings, it is directed that the petitioner will

be charged cost price as prevalent on 31st July, 2004 along with interest
@ 10% p.a. till 30th April, 2008. Demand cum allotment letter on this
basis will be issued within six weeks from today. Possession of the flat
will be given to the petitioner within four weeks after payment is made.

The writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
