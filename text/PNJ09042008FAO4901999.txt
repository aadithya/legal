PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

Heard learned counsel for the parties. The matter in

issue is short.
2.

Consignment booked by the appellant was delivered

in a damaged condition.

The finding that the railway

authorities are responsible for what happened has attained
finality. I may only note that the consignment was perishable
food items and the wagon was delivered after 50 days of
dispatch.

In the interregnum the consignment was infested

with insects.

3.

On 16.6.1994 the railway authorities issued an

assessment certificate assessing 10% loss to 98 bags and 15%
loss to 70 bags. The appellant got the goods inspected and
analysed from two independent merchants, namely, M/s Lahori
Mal Sons and M/s Premier Cereals Ltd. The former assessed
the damage between 60% to 65%.

The latter assessed the

damaged between 62% to 67%.
4.

The two reports were duly proved as Ex.AW-2/10

and Ex.AW-2/11.
5.

The impugned order has noted the fact of appellant

producing the two valuation reports but while concluding the
issue has not even discussed, much less referred, to the two
reports.
6.

I find no reasons in the impugned order as to why

recompense has been ordered treating 10% loss in respect of
98 bags and 15% loss in respect of 70 bags.
7.

Para 1846 of the Railway Commercial Manual

provides as under :“Should there by any difference between the
consignee and Railway Official granting open
delivery
or
assessing
damages,
two
independent and respectable persons should be
called in and their opinions or point or the points
under the dispute should be obtained in
writing. The recorded opinion should be
forwarded to claim office alongwith other
papers.”

8.

Under the circumstances, there is no option but to

set aside the impugned order dated 29.6.1999 and remit the
matter for fresh consideration and determination by the
Railway Claims Tribunal. Needless to state, the Railway Claims
Tribunal would deal with the reports Ex.AW-2/10 and AW-2/11.
A reasoned order would be passed discussing the evidence on
record pertaining to percentage loss/damage. The assessment
certificate dated 16.6.1994 issued by the railway authorities
would be discussed viz-a-viz Ex.AW-2/10 and AW-2/11.
9.

Parties are directed to appear before the Railway

Claims Tribunal on 19.5.2008. On a formal application being
filed, relevant record would be traced and the claim petition
would be re-decided in accordance with law.
10.

No costs.

11.

Copy of the order be supplied dasti to learned

counsel for the parties.
