PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

FIR No.614/07 dated 27.8.2007
under Section 498-A/406/34 IPC
PS Mehrauli.
Petitioner of Bail Application No.2049/2007 is the

sister of the husband of the complainant. She is married and lives

with her husband in village Mohammedpur.
2.

Petitioners of Bail Application No.2050/2007 are the

father-in-law and mother-in-law respectively of the complainant.
3.

All petitioners seek pre-arrest bail.

4.

Complainant Mamta was married to Kuldeep Kumar on

13.2.2005. She alleged in the complaint to the police that her inlaws use to harass her for dowry.

Not only did she name her

husband, her father-in-law and her mother-in-law but even
implicated the elder brother of her husband and also the younger
brother of her husband as also one Raju the person named by her
as the mediator i.e. who arranged the marriage. Wife of the elder
brother of the husband of the complainant was also implicated.
5.

The FIR contains the usual story of harassment.

6.

It would be relevant to note that on 20.1.2007, two

other FIRs being FIR No.30/07 and FIR No.31/07 PS Kapashera
were registered.
7.

FIR No.30/07 is under Section 323/341/308/34 IPC. It

has been lodged by Bhupender Kumar the brother of the
complainant.

FIR No.31/07 has been lodged by Sumesh,

petitioner of Bail Application No.2049/2007.

The FIR has been

lodged under Section 342/354/34 IPC.
8.

Whereas Bhupender Kumar has alleged that he had

gone to the house of the in-laws of his sister to sort out her
matrimonial problem, Sumesh has alleged that Bhupender and his

father Rajender Kumar came to the house when she was alone.
Finding her alone in the house they attempted to molest her
stating that they would do such act on her person. That she will
not be able to face the world.
9.

It is urged by learned counsel for the petitioners that

the instant FIR i.e. FIR No.614/07 has been lodged just to
pressurize Sumesh and all members of the family of the in-laws.
10.

On being questioned, the complainant states that the

family of her in-laws did not trouble Laxmi, wife of Pradeep, the
elder brother of her husband.
11.

Pradeep and Laxmi are present in Court.

questioned,

they

state

that

the

complainant

On being

was

having

temperamental differences with her husband.
12.

The complainant refutes this and asserts that all

members of the family of the in-laws were harassing her.
13.

It would be relevant to note that Pradeep and his wife

are residing separately.
14.

The allegations in the FIR are general and directed

against all members of the family of the in-laws.
15.

Prima facie, I find it difficult to understand as to how

the married elder brother of the husband of the complainant and
his wife who are staying separately would benefit from the dowry
which the complainant might bring along with her.

Similarly,

what benefit would the married daughter of the family get if the

daughter-in-law brings any extra dowry.
16.

Even Raju the mediator has been implicated.

17.

Surprisingly, in the complaint, complainant has ended

by requesting the police to take action against one Rajinder who
is stated to be a neighbour of her in-laws.
18.

How would Rajinder gain by harassing complainant

remains a mystery?
19.

As is documented in various judicial pronouncements,

the FIR in question is another in the line where all the members of
the family of the in-laws have been implicated. Even a neighbour
and the person who acted as a mediator when matrimonial bond
was finalized between the parties have been implicated.
20.

Truth will emerge at the trial.

This would need

evidence to be recorded.
21.

I

do

not

find

any

circumstances

warranting

a

custodial interrogation of the petitioners.
22.

The petitions are accordingly disposed of directing that

in the event of the petitioners being arrested by the investigating
officer, the petitioners would be released on bail by the
investigating officer on their furnishing a personal bond in sum of
Rs.10,000/- each with one surety each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the investigating officer in the afore-noted FIR.

23.

Needless to state, petitioners shall cooperate with the

investigating officer in the investigations in the afore-noted FIR.
24.

Copy of the order be supplied dasti to learned counsel

for the petitioners.
