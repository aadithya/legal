1.

This writ petition challenges the cancellation of

the allotment of a plot allotted to the petitioner by
the Delhi Development Authority. The petitioner, it
appears, has been awaiting allotment of a plot since
1981 when he was registered under the Rohini
Residential Scheme, 1981.

The petitioner has

submitted that he was pursuing the matter diligently
WP (C) No.11364/2006

Page No.1

and even made an enquiry from the DDA on 21st
November, 1994. Copy of the communication shows
that the DDA had been requested to intimate the
position with regard to the allotment of plot against
the deposit.

In this communication, the petitioner

had also intimated his new address.
The DDA responded to the petitioner at this new
address by the letter dated 22nd August, 1995.
2.

It appears however that when the petitioner was

successful in drawing a plot, the DDA sent a demandcum-allotment letter no.F/38(1165)/2003/RHN dated
5th-12th September, 2003 to the old address given by
the petitioner in his original application form given in
the year 1981. The petitioner has submitted that he
did not receive any such communication and had no
knowledge of having drawn a plot. Consequently he
had no notice that he was required to effectuate any
payment in terms thereof.
3.

Information was received by the petitioner with

regard to his having drawn a plot only when the
respondent sent a notice to him to show cause dated
7th May, 2004. The writ petitioner has stated that this

WP (C) No.11364/2006

Page No.2

notice was also sent to the old address and was
received by one of the employees of that firm who
handed it over to the DDA.

The petitioner has

immediately responded to this notice by the letter
dated 22nd May, 2004 informing the DDA that he had
never received the demand-cum-allotment letter or
the

instalment

letter.

The

petitioner

in

this

communication made a specific request to the DDA to
inform him as to how the petitioner should proceed in
the matter and also communicated both his old as
well as new address.
On this communication, no response has been
received by the petitioner.
4.

I find that there is no dispute that this letter has

been received by the DDA.

The only response

received by the petitioner thereafter is
November,

2004

informing

the

dated 25th

petitioner

that

allotment of the petitioner has been cancelled due to
non-payment

of

the

premium

of

the

plot.

Interestingly, this communication has been placed
only when the counter affidavit was filed by the DDA.
Despite the petitioner clearly indicating his new

WP (C) No.11364/2006

Page No.3

address in the letter dated 22nd

May, 2004, this

communication has also been sent to the old address
of the petitioner. The petitioner submits that he had
no knowledge of this communication or the order
passed by the DDA and for this reason the same has
not been mentioned in the writ petition.
5.

The petitioner has filed an additional affidavit

dated 16th September, 2006 referring to the records
of the DDA and pointing out that the allotment in
favour of the petitioner was not cancelled inasmuch
as the concerned Commissioner had raised a query as
to whether the DDA had evidence of the receipt of the
demand-cum-allotment letter.

Without considering

this query or even cancelling the allotment of the
petitioner, the DDA proceeded to include the plot
allotted to the petitioner in a draw of lots dated 26th
July, 2004 and allotted the same to a third party.
There is no denial to these assertions of the
petitioner.
6.

It is noteworthy that on the date when the

petitioner's plot had been put in the draw of lots, the
concerned officer in the DDA itself had raised a query

WP (C) No.11364/2006

Page No.4

as to whether there was really a record of the receipt
of the service of the demand-cum-allotment letter
upon the petitioner.

It is evident that the petitioner

could be called a defaulter in making payment only if
the demand-cum-allotment letter had actually been
served upon him.

In

the absence of any such

material, certainly, the petitioner could not be labelled
as a defaulter and the allotment cancelled on this
basis.
7.

The DDA had communicated with the petitioner

as back as on 22nd August, 1995 at his new address.
Therefrom it is apparent that the DDA was fully aware
of the new and correct address of the petitioner.
Despite knowledge of this fact, the demand-cumallotment letters dated 5/12th December, 2003 and
the notice to show cause had admittedly been sent to
the old address of the petitioner.
The petitioner in clear terms had informed the
DDA on 21st November, 1994 about the new address.
8.

The petitioner has also requested the DDA for

clear guidelines and information as to the manner in
which he should proceed when he has not received

WP (C) No.11364/2006

Page No.5

the demand-cum-allotment letter. As noticed above,
a query has also been raised in the record of the DDA
with regard to the service of the demand-cumallotment

letter.

This

query,

according

to

the

petitioner, has not been replied till date.
9.

The DDA being statutory authority, is expected to

act fairly.

Their actions must disclose probity and

application

of

mind.

Undoubtedly,

without

cancellation of the plot of the petitioner, more so
when the reply of the petitioner to the notice to show
cause was pending consideration, the plot allotted to
the petitioner could not have been put into a draw of
lot on 26th July, 2004.
10. Mr.

Gaurav

Sarin,

learned

counsel

for

the

respondent/DDA, has submitted that upon default in
payment as per the terms of the demand-cumallotment letter, there was automatic cancellation of
the plot of the petitioner and no formal order in this
behalf is required to be passed.

In the facts of the

instant case, such submission is recorded only to be
rejected. There is nothing on record to show that the
demand-cum-allotment letter was ever served on the

WP (C) No.11364/2006

Page No.6

petitioner. Admittedly, the same has been sent to a
wrong address.
11. The DDA has also sent a notice to show cause to
the petitioner as to why the plot be not cancelled.
Consequently by its own action, has shown that it has
not considered the instant case as a case of automatic
cancellation.

Such notice having been served on the

petitioner, the respondent was bound to await reply
thereto, consider the same and pass an order of
cancellation.
12. In this view of the matter, certainly the actions of
the DDA are not guided by the prescribed procedure
and are in violation of the rights of the petitioner and
principles of natural justice.
13.

Mr. Sumit Bansal, learned counsel for the

petitioner, has drawn my attention to the policy of the
DDA dated 25th February, 2004.

As per this policy, it

has been prescribed that in case of default in making
payment of the demanded instalments, power is
vested on an officer of the rank of Director who can
consider the request and condone delay upto 180
days; for delays upto 270 days, power is vested on the

WP (C) No.11364/2006

Page No.7

Principal Commissioner while delay upto 360 days is
condonable by the Vice-Chairman.
14. Delay beyond this period is required to be
considered by the Lt. Governor who, in an appropriate
case, can condone the delay in making payment.
15. As

per

demand-cum-allotment

dated

5th

September, 2003, the DDA had required the petitioner
to deposit inclusive of the first instalment of the net
amount of Rs.1,17,263/- by the 11th of November,
2003. The second instalment which is equivalent to
50% of the premium of Rs.1,80,760/- was required to
be deposited by the 10th January, 2004.

Assuming

that the petitioner had received the demand-cumallotment letter, then, as on 7th May, 2004 when the
notice to show cause was issued to the petitioner, the
petitioner had defaulted in making payment of these
two instalments by approximately 180 days. Thus, as
per

the

policy,

the

case

of

the

petitioner

for

condonation of delay would require to be considered
by the director.
16. In all fairness upon receipt of the petitioner's
communication dated 22nd May, 2004, the DDA ought

WP (C) No.11364/2006

Page No.8

to have sent a copy of the demand-cum-allotment
letter dated 5th September, 2003 to the petitioner and
have also informed the petitioner with regard to the
prevalent policy for condonation
thing was done.

of delay.

No such

On the contrary, without considering

the petitioner's representation and without passing
any order, the petitioner's plot has been included in
draw of lot held on 26th July, 2004 and allotted to a
third party.
17. The conduct of the respondent has to be seen in
the manner in which it has acted in the matter. In the
instant case, as back as in 1975, the respondents had
treated

the

letter

of

the

petitioner

dated

21st

February, 1994 as intimation of the change of the
address when it communicated with the petitioner on
22nd August, 1995 at this new address.
18. In this background, this writ petition deserves to
be allowed.

Inasmuch the plot no.485, Pocket-C-V,

Sector 28, Rohini, Delhi which was allotted to the
petitioner vide demand-cum-allotment letter dated
5th September, 2003 has been allotted to a third
party, as a consequences of the writ petition being

WP (C) No.11364/2006

Page No.9

allowed today, it is held that the petitioner would be
entitled to an allotment of a similar plot in the same
area as per the cost which was prevalent at the time
of allotment on 5th September, 2003. Accordingly, a
mandamus is issued to the DDA to consider

the

petitioner for allotment of a plot in the Rohini
Residential Scheme in the same sector where he was
allotted the plot in terms of the letter dated 5th
September, 2003. The demand which shall be raised
on the petitioner shall be on terms and rates
prevalent on that date.

Inasmuch as the petitioner

has not made payment of any amount pursuant to the
allotment made earlier, the petitioner will be liable to
pay interest in terms of the policy of the DDA for
condonation of delay in making payment.
19. In case the DDA finds that there is no plot
available in the same sector or area, the petitioner
shall be considered for allotment in an area which
bears close proximity to the area where the petitioner
was allotted a plot by the letter dated 5th September,
2003.
20.

The name of the petitioner shall be put in the

WP (C) No.11364/2006

Page No.10

next mini draw for this purpose which shall be held
not later than eight weeks from today. The demandcum-allotment letter shall be communicated to the
petitioner within a period of ten weeks from today.
21. The petitioner shall be entitled to costs of the
present

proceedings

which

are

quantified

at

Rs.10,000/-.
The costs shall be paid within a period of four
weeks from today.
