PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

The instant appeal challenges two orders passed by

the learned Trial Judge. The two orders are dated 3.8.2007 and
7.12.2007.

Vide

first

order

dated

3.8.2007,

plaintiff's

application under Order 9 Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure
has been dismissed. Order dated 14.5.2007 dismissing the

FAO No.48/08

page 1 of 12

suit filed by the appellant in default of appearance was
sustained.
2.

Reasons stated in the application under Order 9

Rule 9 CPC for non appearance on 14.5.2007 was that the
counsel for the plaintiff had gone to attend the marriage of his
near relative and on said account could not appear in court.
3.

Learned Trial Judge noted that the application was

supported with the affidavit of the clerk of the counsel. It has
further been observed by the learned Trial Judge that even
counsel of the plaintiff has failed to tell as to whose relation he
has gone in the marriage on 14.5.2007.
4.

The second order impugned i.e. the order dated

7.12.2007 has disposed of a second application filed under
Order 9 Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
5.

Reason given for dismissing the second application

is that no second application lies for restoration of a suit
dismissed in default when an earlier application has been
disposed of.
6.

It appears that the second application under Order 9

Rule 9 CPC was filed to cure the defect in the earlier
application under Order 9 Rule 9 CPC which was dismissed vide
order dated 3.8.2007.
7.

Before adverting to the grounds of appeal and the

FAO No.48/08

page 2 of 12

merits of the controversy, certain relevant backdrop facts need
to be noted.
8.

I would be referring to the respondents as Janas. I

would be referring to the appellant as S.N.Sapra, i.e. by his
name.
9.

Janas and S.N.Sapra are at loggers head with each

other since the year 1994.

They have been litigating with

respect to the second floor of property bearing Municipal No.M38, Chitranjan Park, New Delhi.
10.

The said property was owned by P.K.Jana and his

wife Usha Jana. On her death her half share was inherited by
her two childern Sandeep and Saurabh.
11.

Janas filed a suit for ejectment alleging that

S.N.Sapra was a tenant under them in respect of the second
floor of property bearing No. M-38, Chitranjan Park, New Delhi.
They alleged that the tenancy stood determined and hence
they were entitled to possession thereof.
12.

In the said suit, S.N.Sapra filed a counter claim. He

relied upon a memorandum dated 5.1.1994 and pleaded that
the same was an agreement to sell.

He pleaded possessary

rights under the memorandum dated 5.1.1994. He stated that
the total sale consideration agreed upon between him and
Janas was Rs.3 lacs. He stated that he paid Rs.30,000/- when
FAO No.48/08

page 3 of 12

the memorandum was executed. He pleaded that from time to
time he made further payments.

Prayer made was that a

decree be passed as under:“I.
That the counter claim be accepted, the
decree/order be passed in favour of the defendants
directing the plaintiffs to execute the transfer
deeds in respect of the flat No.M-38, Chittranjan
Park, New Delhi.
II.
A decree for permanent injunction be passed
in favour of the defendants restraining the
plaintiffs from alienating, transferring, disposing off
creating any third party interest and also from
interfering with the supply of water and electricity
in the said flat.
III.

Cost of counter claim be allowed.

Any other and further relief which this Hon'ble
Court may deem fit and proper in the
circumstances of the case including the dismissal
of plaint may also be granted.”
13.

Having

defended

the

suit

by

filing

a

written

statement and also laying a counter claim for a decree of
specific performance being passed in his favour directing
plaintiffs to execute transfer documents in respect of the
property, S.N.Sapra failed to defend the suit and prosecute his
counter claim.

The result was that the counter claim was

dismissed in default and Janas were granted an ex-parte
decree for possession on 4.9.2004.
14.

Being relevant it may be noted that the suit for

possession being suit No.237/1995 was filed by the Janas on
FAO No.48/08

page 4 of 12

6.6.1995 and counter claim was filed on 18.11.1997.
15.

S.N.Sapra filed an application under Order 9 Rule 13

CPC for setting aside of the ex-parte decree dated 4.9.2004.
He pleaded that the suit was premised on the claim that he
was a tenant but the facts were otherwise. He relied upon the
memorandum dated 5.1.1994 to plead that he was a bona fide
purchaser of the second floor.
16.

Suffice would it be to record that the scope of Order

9 Rule 13 CPC being restricted to the sufficiency of the cause
shown for non appearance when suit was decreed ex-parte,
learned Trial Judge did not go into any other issue save and
except the sufficiency of the cause shown for non appearance
when ex-parte decree was passed.

Finding none, vide order

dated 20.5.2005 application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC filed by
S.N.Sapra was dismissed.
17.

S.N.Sapra fought the battle challenging the order

dated 20.5.2005 right up to the Supreme Court.

His first

appeal failed in this court. Petition for special leave to appeal
suffered a dismissal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
18.

The ex-parte decree became a subject matter of

repeated challenges by S.N.Sapra from time to time as and
when Janas obtained warrants for possession of the property.
19.

Instant suit which suffered a dismissal in default was

FAO No.48/08

page 5 of 12

filed in the year 2004. Prayer made in the suit is as under:“I) To pass a decree of declaration in favour of
the plaintiff and against the defendants whereby
declaring that the plaintiff alone is entitled to get
the regular sale deed executed from the
defendants No.1 and 2 under the terms and
conditions of Memorandum of Understanding
dated 1-5-94 of second floor flat forming part of
property No.M-38, Chitranjan Park, New Delhi
morefully shown and described in the site plan
annexed with the plaint and the defendants No.3
and 4 have no right, title or claim over the said
flat against the plaintiff to meet the ends of
justice.
II.
To pass a decree of Permanent Injunction in
favour of the plaintiff and against the
defendantss 1 to 4 whereby be pleased to
restrain the defendants 1 to 4 their attorneys,
agents etc. from selling, transferring or
alienating the suit property morefully shown and
described in the site plan the second floor
forming part of property No.M-38, Chitranjan
Park, New Delhi to any other person to meet the
ends of justice.
III. To pass a decree of Specific Performance in
favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants
No.1 and 2 whereby be pleased to direct the
defendants No.1 and 2 to accept the balance
sale consideration of Rs.1,76,400.00 (Rupees
One Lakh seventy six thousands and four
hundred) from the plaintiff being balance sale
consideration of second floor flat, morefully
shown and described in Site plan forming part of
property No.M-38, Chitranjan Park, New Delhi
and sing and execute the regular sale deed of
suit property at the expenses of plaintiff in
favour of plaintiff and get the same registered in
the office of Sub-Registrar concerned AND/OR IN
THE ALTERNATIVE:
On failure of the defendants No. 1 and 2 to
accept the balance consideration amount from
FAO No.48/08

page 6 of 12

plaintiff, direct the plaintiff to deposit the same
in the court and payable to defendants 1 and 2
and the Hon'ble Court execute regular sale deed
of suit property in favour of the plaintiff to meet
the ends of justice.
IV. Costs of suit be also awarded in favour of
the plaintiff to meet the ends of justice.
V.
Any other and further orders/directions
which this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and
proper into the circumstances of the case be
also passed in favour of the plaintiff to meet the
ends of justice.”
20.

In the said suit S.N.Sapra pleaded a claim under the

memorandum dated 5.1.1994 i.e. the memorandum on which
the counter claim was predicated. He further stated that out of
the agreed sale consideration in sum of Rs.3 lacs he had paid
Rs.1,23,600 and that he was ready and willing to pay the
balance sale consideration of Rs.1,76,400/-. Relevant would it
be to note that in the suit in question S.N.Sapra has not
mentioned that he had already filed a counter claim when
Janas sue for his ejectment and that the said counter claim was
dismissed in default.
21.

As noted hereinabove, suit filed by S.N.Sapra was

not prosecuted by him resulting in same being dismissed in
default on 14.5.2007.
22.

In the execution proceedings set into motion by

Janas when decree of ejectment was put into execution,
objections were filed by S.N.Sapra alleging that the decree was
FAO No.48/08

page 7 of 12

a nullity, in that, it was predicated on his status being a tenant
whereas he was in possession under the MOU dated 5.1.1994.
Vide order dated 27.5.2005 the said objections were dismissed.
The order was not challenged. It attained finality.
23.

S.N.Sapra resorted to a third action. He filed a civil

suit on the original side of this court registered as CS(OS)
No.2202/2006.

In the said suit he challenged the decree of

ejectment dated 4.9.2004.

The said suit was dismissed as

withdrawn on 28.11.2006.
24.

S.N.Sapra went back to the executing court and filed

another objection to the execution of the decree which
objection was dismissed vide order dated 2.12.2006. The order
was challenged by and under C.R.No. 360/2006. The same was
dismissed by this court vide order dated 14.1.2008.

Further

challenge failed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court when
petition for special leave to appeal seeking to challenge the
order dated 14.1.2008 disposing of C.R.No. 360/2006 was
dismissed as withdrawn.
25.

Dismissing C.R.P.No.360/2006 it was observed by

this court that S.N.Sapra was prima facie resorting to
multifarious litigation and that prima facie his right to litigate
on the basis of the MOU dated 5.1.2004 stood foreclosed when
his counter claim was dismissed. Needless to state, restoration
FAO No.48/08

page 8 of 12

of the counter claim was never prayed for. Exemplary costs in
sum of Rs.25,000/- was imposed upon S.N.Sapra.
26.

Order 9 Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads

as under:“9. Decree against plaintiff by default
bars fresh suit – (1) Where a suit is wholly or
partly dismissed under rule 8, the plaintiff shall
be precluded from brining a fresh suit in
respect of the same cause of action. But he
may apply for an order to set the dismissal
aside, and if he satisfies the Court that there
was sufficient cause for his non-appearance
when the suit was called on for hearing, the
Court shall make an order setting aside the
dismissal upon such terms as to cost or
otherwise as it thinks fit, and shall appoint a
day for proceeding with the suit.
(2) No order shall be made under this rule
unless notice of the application has been
served on the opposite party.”
27.

Prima facie, where a suit has been dismissed under

Rule 8 of Order 9 the plaintiff is precluded from bringing a fresh
suit in respect of the same cause of action. Right is to seek
restoration of the suit.
28.

It is true that a dismissal of a suit under Order 9

Rule 9 CPC does not operate as res judicata for the reasons
principles enunciated under Section 11 of the Code of Civil
Procedure are entirely different, but Order 9 Rule 9 CPC, it
cannot be forgotten, is based on public policy, being that, on
the same cause a defendant should not be sued for a second
FAO No.48/08

page 9 of 12

time.
29.

Independent of the reasons given by the learned

Trial Judge while dismissing both applications, prima facie the
very suit filed by S.N.Sapra seeking a decree for specific would
not lie for the reason for the same relief and on the same
cause of action counter claim was predicated by S.N.Sapra
when Janas sued for his ejectment.
30.

Additionally, a suit for specific performance has to

be filed within 3 years from the date when cause of action
accrues.
31.

Obviously, a cause of action to seek specific

performance of the MOU dated 5.1.1994 had accrued to
S.N.Sapra prior to 18.11.1997 for the reason on said date he
filed a counter claim in the suit for ejectment filed by the Janas.
In

the

counter

claim

he

sought

a

decree

for

specific

performance. Prima facie, the instant suit would obviously be
barred by limitation for the reason, admittedly cause of action
to seek specific performance of the MOU dated 5.1.1994 had
accrued, if not later, at least on 18.11.1997.
32.

It is obviously a case where S.N.Sapra is using

virtually every provision in law to frustrate a decree for
ejectment obtained by the Janas. Needless to state the decree
has attained finality. Even objections to the decree have been
FAO No.48/08

page 10 of 12

dismissed. The same have also attained finality.
33.

In my opinion, the frivolous nature of the litigation

itself disentitles S.N.Sapra to any indulgence from a court of
law which must, in my opinion, possesses inherent powers to
nip a frivolous litigation at the bud if the litigation is opined to
be an abuse of the process of the court.
34.

Be that as it may, I concur with the view taken by

the learned Trial Judge when order dated 3.8.2007 was passed
that no sufficient cause has been shown for non appearance
when the suit was dismissed in default on 14.5.2007.
35.

I may take on record that the counsel concerned

had filed an affidavit in support of the application under Order
9 Rule 9 CPC. But, it would be relevant to note that neither in
the application nor in the affidavit has the counsel disclosed as
to whose marriage he had gone to attend. The venue of the
marriage,

the time of the marriage,

none have been

disclosed.
36.

In

the

backdrop

of

the

multifarious

litigation

resorted to by S.N.Sapra, particulars of the stated marriage
which the counsel had attended assume significance for the
reason, as noted hereinabove, S.N.Sapra is using every trick
up his sleeve to frustrate a legal and valid decree obtained by
the Janas.

37.

Pertaining

to

second

order

which

has

been

challenged in the instant appeal, being the order dated
7.12.2007, suffice would it be to state that law does not permit
successive applications to be filed under Order 9 Rule 9 CPC.
38.

I find no merits in the appeal.

39.

The appeal is dismissed with costs in sum of

Rs.25,000/-.
