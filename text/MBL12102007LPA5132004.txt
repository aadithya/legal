Our attention has been drawn to the Recruitment Regulations

for the Post of L.D.C (English) in Delhi Development Authority
published in the Gazette of India dated 8th December, 2003 where the
description of the post has been shown as LDC-cum-Typist (English /
Hindi). The method of recruitment requires that 75% posts are to be
filled up by direct recruitment (50% LDC-cum-English Typists & 25%
LDC-cum-Hindi Typist). 25% posts are to be filled up by promotion
from regular Group `D‚Äù employees (15% by simple test and 10% by
seniority-cum-fitness).
3.

In the impugned judgment and order, the learned Single

Judge had directed the Delhi Development Authority to conduct a
typing test for the appellants and such of them who clear the typing test,
should be inducted as LDC. The typing test was directed to be held
within 12 weeks.
4.

It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellants that there

is no requirement of any typing test and he has drawn our attention to
some circulars issued by the Delhi Development Authority, which have
been annexed with the original writ petition.

We are of the opinion that the post being that of a LCD-cum-

typist, there is no doubt that the appellants in order to qualify would
have to undergo a typing test. Even under the instructions issued by the
Government of India dated 29th September, 1992 and 14th September,
1995, relied upon by learned counsel for the appellants, exemption may
be granted from passing the typing test provided that at least two
genuine attempts are made for passing the typing test.

Thus, it is

essential for the appellants to at least undertake the typing test. The
Recruitment Regulation mention a `simple test' but that has not been
defined. Learned counsel for the Delhi Development Authority has
informed us that the Delhi Development Authority is willing to conduct
a typing test and would try to make it as simple as possible.
6.

Although we are a little unhappy to note that the order passed

by the learned Single Judge has not yet been implemented by the Delhi
Development Authority, we do not wish to comment any further on this.
We, however, reiterate the directions that the Delhi Development
Authority should conduct a simple typing test within 12 weeks from
today and such of the appellants, who clear the typing test, would, of
course, be appointed as LDC-cum-typist as per the extant Rules.
