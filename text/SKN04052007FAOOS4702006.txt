1. The present appeals by Shri Harbans Lal Khullar and Smt. Kiran
st

Khullar are directed against the Order dated 1 May, 2006 passed
by the learned Single Judge whereby the defence of the appellants
was struck off due to non-compliance of the Order dated 4

th

October, 2005.
2. The appellants herein are the defendants 1-2 in CS(OS) No.
1633/2005 which has been filed by Ms. Dolly Kapoor.
3. The said Suit has been filed for partition, rendition of account and
injunction in respect of the estate left behind by one Smt. Arsha
th

Verma, who expired on 24 June, 2000. The appellants and the
respondent in the present appeals claim legal title/right in her estate
or in dealing with the same.
4. By Order dated 19
statement

was

th

April, 2005 passed in I.A. No.1452/2005, a

made

by

learned

counsel

for

the

appellants/defendants 1-2 that the said defendants were ready and
willing to place on record the photocopies of passbooks of joint
accounts of the deceased

with the said defendants/appellants,

from which position with regard to the deposits and withdrawals

FAO(OS) Nos.470-471/2006

Page 3

would become clear.

It was further stated that the appellants-

defendants 1-2 had not made any withdrawals from the joint
accounts

except

one

withdrawal

of

about

approximately

Rs.25,000/-.
5. We have examined the records and find that on 2

nd

August, 2005

the appellants-defendants 1-2 had furnished details of 21 bank
accounts/FDRs along with a list. Photocopy of the FDRs and bank
statements were enclosed.
th

6. On 27 September, 2005 statement was made by learned counsel
for the appellants-defendants 1-2 that in compliance with the order,
statements of accounts had been filed. This was however disputed
by the plaintiff-respondent who had appeared in person and stated
that complete details of accounts had not been filed. Liberty was
granted to the parties to file an application.
7. Thereafter, IA.No.7944/2005 was filed. Learned counsel for the
appellants-defendants 1-2 appeared on 4

th

October, 2005 and

made a statement that he would file an affidavit giving complete
details and statements of accounts of the deceased. On the basis

FAO(OS) Nos.470-471/2006

Page 4

of this statement, the application was disposed of. However, the
th

affidavit came to be filed only on 17 March, 2006. In this affidavit,
the appellant-defendant no.2 stated that she had already placed on
record list of FDRs, bank accounts held in joint name along with the
deceased and no other information regarding any account of her
sister was available with her. Along with this affidavit, the appellantdefendant no.2 had also enclosed copy of return filed by the
deceased with details for the Assessment Year 2000-2001.
st

8. Learned Single Judge by the impugned Order dated 1 May, 2006
has held that the affidavit filed was not in terms of the statement
th

made on 4 October, 2005 and struck of the defence of defendants
1-2/appellants herein. Thereafter, certain other directions for
partition of the properties were also issued.
th

9. The affidavit filed by the appellant-defendant no.2 on 17 March,
2006 should have been a detailed affidavit setting out complete
details and particulars of all the bank accounts, FDRs, etc. Even if
the appellant-defendant no.2 had already furnished details and
photocopies of the said FDRs and bank accounts, the same should

FAO(OS) Nos.470-471/2006

Page 5

have been duly incorporated in the affidavit on oath. Affidavit by the
appellant-defendant no.2 was required so that she could be bound
nd

by the details furnished by her in form of a list on 2 August, 2005.
However, one cannot lose sight of the fact that the appellantdefendant no.2 has stated in the affidavit that the details of
FDR/bank accounts had already been placed on record on 2

nd

August, 2005 and the deponent, i.e. appellant-defendant no.2 did
not have any other information regarding the accounts of her
deceased sister available with her. Thus, no further details of any
other accounts, FDRs were furnished.
10.We also find that the appellant-defendant no.2 had not furnished or
given the details in the affidavit, of any withdrawals made by her
after 2000.
11.The Suit as such is at initial stage and photocopies of FDRs and
bank accounts as well as affidavit was filed by the appellant. In
order to do complete justice, we grant the appellants-defendant
no.2's and one further opportunity to file a detailed affidavit on oath
clearly stating:

FAO(OS) Nos.470-471/2006

Page 6

(i) Full details of the joint accounts and FDRs
held by the deceased, Smt. Arsha Verma
either individually or jointly with the said
defendants along with the bank balance at the
time of her death;
(ii)

Details of all withdrawals from the said

bank accounts and FDRs from the year 2000
onwards;
(iii) Details of rent received along with the
bank account

in which

rent has been

deposited from the date of death of Smt.
Arsha Verma. Details of other income from
the investments made by late Arsha Verma
along with bank account in which the said
income has been deposited.
(iv) Appellants-defendant nos.1&2 will also
clearly

state

knowledge

or

whether

they

information

of

have
any

any
other

movable assets left behind by Smt. Arsha
Verma, which may be in their possession or in
possession of third parties.

12.

The aforesaid affidavit will be filed within three weeks from the

FAO(OS) Nos.470-471/2006

Page 7

date of this Order. The appellant-defendant nos.1 and 2 will also be
liable to pay costs for having delayed the proceedings. Keeping in
view the value of the assets and the delay caused, costs are
assessed at Rs.25,000/- to be paid by the appellants to the
respondent-plaintiff through counsel within three weeks. With the
aforesaid directions, and subject to compliance within the stipulated
period, the appeals are disposed off. On compliance being made
within the time period, the impugned order striking off the defence
of the appellant-defendants shall be set aside.
th

13.Suit is already listed before the learned Single Judge on 10 July,
2007.
