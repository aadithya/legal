1.

Workman Kashi Ram Sharma was admittedly an

employee of the appellant working as a clerk since 1970. His last
drawn wages were Rs.3400/- per month. On 12.2.1995 he left for
his office.

His daily journey would begin by foot from his

residence to the bus stop. He would board a bus from the bus
stop near his house and disembark at a bus stop near his office
wherefrom, on foot, he would reach his office.

On the day in

question while proceeding to the bus stop near his house,
accompanying by his father-in-law he felt uneasy. He complained
page 1 of 4

of chest pain. Unfortunately, before medical aid could be given
he died.
2.

His

dependants

sought

compensation

under

the

Workmen Compensation Act and predicated the claim by placing
reliance upon a decision of the Supreme Court reported as AIR
1964 SC 193 G.M., B.E.S.T. Undertaking Vs. Agnes.
3.
employee

Denying liability, the management stated that the
suffered

a

heart

attack

not

during

course

of

employment. The management relied upon the decision of the
Supreme Court reported as (1996) 6 SCC 1 Regional Director,
E.S.I. Corporation & Anr. Vs. Francis De Costa And Another.
4.

The claimants predicated an additional claim, being

that, due to stress caused on the person of the injured due to
extreme work conditions and excess work being taken from the
deceased the heart attack was an occupational disease as per
Section 2(8) of the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948.
5.

Vide

impugned

order

dated

6.2.2003

the

Commissioner, Workmen Compensation has not decided on the
second issue namely, whether the cardiac arrest cold be treated
as an occupational disease.

Evidence pertaining to the work

condition of the workman has not been discussed.
6.

Placing

reliance

upon

the

decision

in

Agnes

case(supra) Tribunal has held that since the deceased was on the
way to his office he would be deemed to be at his workplace.

Learned counsel for the respondent concedes that in

Francis De Costa's case decision in Agnes case was noted and
distinguished in para 16 of the report.
8.

Para 15 and 16 of the decision in Francis De Costa case

read as under :“15. Strong reliance was placed by Shri Chacko on a
decision of this Court in G.M., B.E.S.T. Undertaking v.
Agnes. In this case, one bus driver of the appellantCorporation after finishing the day's work left for home
in a bus belonging to the employer's undertaking
which met with an accident as a result of which he
died. His widow claimed compensation under the
Workmen's Compensation Act and the question was
whether the accident had arisen out of and in the
course of employment. It was held by Subba Rao and
Mudholkar, JJ (Raghubar Dayal, J. dissenting) that the
bus driver was given facility by the management to
travel in any bus belonging tot he undertaking. It was
given because efficiency of the service demanded it.
Therefore, the right of the bus driver to travel in the
bus was to discharge his duty punctually and
efficiently. This was a condition of service and there
was an obligation to travel in the said buses as a part
of his duty. It was held that in the case of a factory,
the premises of an employer was a limited one but in
the case of a City Transport Service, the entire fleet of
buses forming the service would be 'premises'. This
decision in our view, does not come to the assistance
of the employee's case. An employee
of
a
Transport
Undertaking was travelling in a vehicle
provided by the employer. Having regard to the
purpose for which he was travelling and also having
regard to the obligation on the part of the employee to
travel in the said buses as a part of his duty, the Court
came to the conclusion that this journey was in the
course of his employment because the entire fleet of
buses formed the premises within which he worked.
16. But in the case before us, the facts are entirely
different. The employee was not obliged to travel in
any particular way under the terms of employment nor
can it be said that he was travelling in a transport
page 3 of 4

provided by the employer.”
9.

It is not a case where the deceased employee was

traveling in a vehicle provided by the employer. Thus, view taken
by the Commissioner, Workman Compensation is contrary to law.
10.

The appeal has to be allowed. But, matter has to be

remanded to the Commissioner Workman Compensation to
consider the evidence on record and take a decision whether the
death of the employee could be termed as a death occasioned by
an occupational disease arising out of the employment.
11.

The appeal is allowed.

12.

Order dated 6.2.2003 is set aside. Matter is remanded

to

the

Commissioner,

Workman

Compensation

for

fresh

adjudication in light of the observations in the present order.
13.

Parties

shall

appear

before

the

Commissioner,

Workmen Compensation on 17.12.2007.
14.

No costs.
