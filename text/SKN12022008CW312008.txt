ORDER
% 12.02.2008

1. The petitioner has impugned Order dated 1

st

August, 2007 passed by

the Nodal Officer rejecting the claim of the petitioner for allotment of
alternative plot.
2. The Gaon Sabha land in village Nangal Dewat was allotted to four

communities, namely, Makbuja Jullahan, Makbuja Chamaran, Makbuja
Kumharan and Makbuja Ahle. The land was not allotted to individuals.
3. The land allotted to the said four communities was acquired for public

purpose, namely, expansion of airport. Compensation for acquisition of
land stands paid.
4. The acquisition was challenged by some of the land owners/bhumidars

in W.P. (C) No. 481/1982 titled Daryao Singh versus Union of India and
others. The said Writ Petition was disposed of on 2nd August, 2001 with
the petitioners therein giving up their challenge to the acquisition
proceedings with the respondents agreeing to allot plots under a
scheme to be formulated by them.
5. Persons who were in occupation of community land filed the review

application, R.A. No. 9312/2001 claiming that they should be also
allotted individual lands. The said Review Application was disposed of
by Order dated 16th December, 2004 holding, inter alia, that the land will
be allotted to the said communities who may then allot land to
individuals. Request for individual allotments of lands was rejected. A

similar Order was also passed on 18th May, 2005 holding that since
Gaon Sabha land was allotted to the said communities, the alternative
land has also to be allotted to the said communities and not to
individuals.
6. Notwithstanding dismissal and disposal of the said Review Application,

Harijan and Bakward Jankalyan filed Writ Petition (Civil) No.
17778/2006. Some other writ petitions were also filed thereafter. During
the pendency of Writ Petition (Civil) No.17778/2006, it appears that a
meeting was held in the Chamber of the Joint Secretary (Civil Aviation)
on 14th March, 2007 to look into the issue of eligibility and alternative
plots to persons who are in possession of land recorded/allotted in the
name of the said communities. The Committee made recommendations
that residents occupying lands recorded in the name of the said
communities may be considered for allotment of individual plots. On
examination of records it was found that as per the 1958 survey, about
122 persons were recorded as occupants of land which were allotted to
the communities. This list of 122 persons was, as per the report of the
Committee, to be considered as the outer limit for determining the
eligibility

for

allotment

of

alternative

plots.

The

Committee

recommended fresh survey of the community land to find out whether
the said 122 persons or their legal heirs were in actual possession.

7. The Court was apprised of the recommendations of the aforesaid

Committee. This fact is recorded in the Order dated 31st May, 2005
passed in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 17778/2006 titled Harijan & Bakward
Kalyan Samiti versus Union of India and others.
8. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the respondent had

agreed to allot alternative plots to 122 persons mentioned in the 1958
survey list and a statement to this effect was made in the Court and has
been recorded in the Order dated 31st May, 2007 passed in Writ Petition
(Civil) No. 17778/2006 titled Harijan & Bakward Kalyan Samiti versus
Union of India and others and other cases. I do not agree. On 31st May,
2007, the respondents had made a statement before the Court that the
1958 survey list would form the foundation and basis for examining the
question of eligibility. This list of 122 persons was the outer limit and
thereafter the question of eligibility for allotment was to be examined. It
was not stated that the said 122 persons, as per the 1958 survey list
would be allotted alternative plots. This becomes apparent from the
Order dated 27th July, 2006 passed in Writ Petition (Civil) No.
17778/2006 titled Harijan & Bakward Kalyan Samiti versus Union of
India and others and other writ petitions. The Court has recorded the
statement of the counsel for the respondents that the actual figure in
1958 survey list was 121 and not 122 as name of one person had

occurred twice in the list and out of the said list only 63 persons were
found to be eligible and others did not meet the eligibility requirement for
allotment. It was also stated before the Court that the persons who were
not found to be eligible would be informed of the reasons.
9. Pursuant to the recommendations made in the meeting held on 14

th

March, 2007, Ministry of Civil Aviation constituted a Committee on the
question of determining the eligibility criteria and allotment of alternative
plots to persons who were found to be in occupation of community land.
Thereafter, a team headed by Tehsildar, Naib Tehsildar, Kanungo,
Patwari,

representatives

of

Land

&

Building

Department,

representatives of Airport Authority of India and DDA was constituted.
The said team visited Village Nangal Dewat from 29th June, 2007 to 4th
July, 2007 to verify claim of each person and measure the land found to
be in possession of the claimants. The Committee decided that persons
mentioned in the list of 121 persons, who were found to be in actual
possession shall be allotted alternative land. The 1958 survey list was
taken as the basis and another condition was imposed that the said
persons or their legal heirs should be in possession of the land in 2007.
Thus an additional eligibility criteria of actual possession in 2007 was
imposed. It cannot be said that the said condition is contrary to any
directions given in the Order dated 31st May, 2007 or is unreasonable.

In fact no direction was given in the order dated 31st May, 2007 passed
in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 17778/2006 titled Harijan & Bakward Kalyan
Samiti versus Union of India and others and other cases. This eligibility
condition imposed is also justified and fair as allotment of alternative
land is being made in the year 2007 and therefore the survey list of
1958 cannot be the sole basis for allotment. The occupants of
community land, in 1958, may have shifted out and moved to another
area. Therefore, the conditions imposed for allotment of alternative land
are : firstly, the name of the person must be included in the survey list of
1958 and secondly, the persons mentioned in 1958 survey list or their
legal heirs should be in actual physical possession in 2007.
10. In view of the above, I do not find any merit in the writ petition and the

same is dismissed.
