Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat
1.

This present Petition, under Section 482, Cr. P.C.

impugns the order dated

16.11.2004 of the learned Learned Addl. Sessions Judge (hereafter "the revisional
Court").
2.

The brief facts necessary to decide this petition are that the Petitioner is a retired

Gazetted officer, and allotee of Flat No.25 in Vasant Co-operative Group housing society
Ltd. (hereafter called “the Society”). The Respondent too is an allotee occupant of a flat
in the same society. He was Vice President of the society till 23.10.1994. It is alleged
that he threatened to implicate the Petitioner and other members in false cases.

3.

The Respondent on 31.10.1997 registered an FIR No. 948/97 under Sections

336/427 IPC of P.S. Trilokpuri alleging that when he went for a walk at 11 pm with his
daughter, some persons threw bricks at him, one of which fell on his car. He alleged
that the same night, someone broke the wind screen of his car. He claimed that Kishori
Lal and Parikshit Sahney to be the prime suspects; they had raised their voice in the
General Body meeting against him. Thereafter, the complaint along with few other
residents submitted a representation to SHO P.S. Trilokpuri on 08.11.1997 stating that the
alleged incident dated 31.10.1997 was false and concocted.

The Respondent was

allegedly annoyed with the Petitioner and threatened to ruin him and his family. He
included the Petitioner's name as one of the prime suspects in the FIR to tarnish his
image.
4.

It is alleged by the Petitioner that the Respondent published circulars besides

writing objectionable letters, against him and circulated them in the society.

The

Petitioner and the chairman of Federation of Group of Housing societies started bus
services from the society. The Respondent represented to Sh. Shanker Bhan, chairman of
Group Housing Society complex, Mayur Vihar, leveling serious allegations against the
Petitioner that he was involved in large scale embezzlement and misappropriation of
funds of the Society. The Respondent had sent the communication on the letter head of
All India Public Welfare Society, claiming himself to be Legal Adviser, whereas he had
ceased to be one.

5.

The Respondent further sent a letter on 21.10.2000 to Sh. Omesh Sehgal, the then

CRL.M.C. 650/2005

2 of 10

Chief Secretary, Government of Delhi alleging that the Petitioner was involved in large
scale irregularities, unauthorized construction and misappropriation of society funds to
the tune of Rupees One Crore. The Respondent made defamatory allegations against the
Petitioner. The Petitioner further alleged that in the 2nd week of January 2001, the
accused again published a defamatory letter and circulated it amongst the residents of the
Society. The letter had contained allegations of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation
of society’s funds and outraging modesty of Smt. Sundari Gopal Krishnan, and the
petitioner's arrest under Section 509 IPC. Few other letters too were also published in
Metro East Shopping convenience, a local newsletter. This lowered the reputation of the
complainant and he sent a legal notice dated 17.1.2001, calling upon the Respondent to
withdraw false derogatory imputations.

6.

The Petitioner alleged that the respondent complained to Commissioner of Police,

DCP(E), ACP Kalyanpuri and SHO Mayur Vihar, making false allegations. On receiving
the complaint two police men visited the Petitioner and made enquiries. The complaint
notice was served on the Petitioner on 4.2.2001. He was asked to appear in the Police
Station on 5.2.2001. The Respondent, on 4.2.2001 made remarks against the Petitioner
and few others stating that he embezzled a huge amount of society funds, outraged
modesty of a woman and was involved in other anti-social activities.

7.

The Petitioner alleged that the Respondent was aware that he could not embezzle

any amount since he was not member of Managing Committee incharge of the affairs of
CRL.M.C. 650/2005

3 of 10

society during that period, yet he made false and frivolous allegations. The Petitioner
submitted that the Respondent committed an offence under Section 499

IPC and

therefore a complaint against him was lodged.
8.

The trial Court initially issued process upon the complaint, but later, after the

respondent sought for recall of that order, discharged the Respondent by an order dated
20.12.2003. The extracts of the order dated 20.12.2003 are as follows:
“In my considered view no primafacie offence as alleged has been made out
against the Respondent. All the imputations as allegedly made by the
Respondent are covered under various exceptions of section 499 IPC and does
not constitute any defamation as sought to the made out by the Petitioner. The
evidence available on record might have been sufficient for making out the case
of summoning order, under section 204 Crl.P.C. but at the stage of framing of
notices and disposal of application of recalling of summoning order, the
sufficiency of material is not sufficient. It is a settled legal proposition that at
the stage of framing notice and charge, the appreciation of evidence has to be
comparatively stricter and should make out prima facie case. In the light of the
aforesaid discussion in my considered view, no primafacie case u/s. 499 IPC is
made out against the Respondent. Hence, Respondent is discharged”.
9.

The Petitioner preferred a revision against the impugned order dated 20.12.2003.

The revisional court rejected the petition. The extracts of the order dated 16.11.2004 are
as follows:
“I find from record no infirmity in law or illegality in the impugned order dated
20.12.2003 of the Ld. Trial Court passed at the stage of framing of notice as well
as on the application for recalling of summoning order moved by the Respondent
in the subject complaint of the revisionist against the Respondent for alleged
offence punishable u/s. 500 IPC, discharging the respondent/accused of the said
offence. The revision petition is accordingly dismissed”

10.

It was submitted that there were sufficient materials on record to enable the trial

court to frame charge/notice for the offences punishable under Section 500 IPC, having

CRL.M.C. 650/2005

4 of 10

regard to the averments made in the complaint. It was contended that the courts below
committed error in concluding that the letters dated 24.11.99, 21.10.2000, the leaflet
circulated in second week of January, 2002, the so-called complaint dated 24.1.2001 do
contain scurrilous and defamatory statements targeting the petitioner and lowering him in
the esteem of others. Counsel contended that the two serious allegations about the
petitioner being party to embezzlement and misappropriation of funds as well as the
about his assault upon a lady, with a view to outrage her modesty, ex facie disclosed
defamation and that the courts below fell into error in ignoring this. It was further
contended that the courts should have not considered the merits at this stage and proceed
to frame the charge.
11.

Learned counsel contended that the revisional court committed error in not seeing

that the trial court could not have recalled the order issuing process in view of the
judgment of the Supreme Court reported as Adalat Prasad Vs. Rooplal Jindal and others,
(2004) 7 SCC 338 and Subramanium Seturaman Vs. State of Maharashtra &

Anr.,

2004(13) SCC 324. It was further contended that the discussion by the courts leading to
discharge of the accused respondent, was also not justified, in view of the judgment in
State of Orissa Vs. Devendra Nath Padhy, 2005(1) SCC 568.
12.

Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that both the courts had considered

the matter extensively before concluding that criminal proceedings against the
respondent/complainant had to be dropped. It was contended by learned counsel that the
jurisdiction under Section 482 should be exercised sparingly and in rare circumstances if
the court is convinced that refusal to intervene would inevitably lead to miscarriage of
CRL.M.C. 650/2005

5 of 10

justice. Learned counsel contended that the facts of this case point to the contrary; if this
court reverses the orders of the courts below, the respondent would be put to extreme
prejudice and hardship and made to face an unjustified proceeding.

13.

It was contended that the respondent/complainant was for some time an office

bearer of the society; he was vice President, till October, 1994. During his tenure, for a
brief while, when the respondent was elected as Vice Chairman in June, 1994, (and
resigned due to disgust in October, 1994) he noticed that the managing committee of the
society persistently failed to get the accounts audited and retrieve missing documents,
which were pointed out in the Special Audit Report that led to appointment of an
Administrator for getting the audit done. Despite appointment of 5 administrators after
16.3.1998, accounts were left unaudited.

Counsel contended that the letter written to

Omesh Sehgal could not be treated as defamatory. Firstly, the letter was not proved and
that it merely mentions that the petitioner and others were adopting delaying tactics and
evading internal audit. As far as the so-called leaflet was concerned the petitioner had no
role in it -even no attempt was made to connect him with it. It was also submitted that
what is stated as a complaint dated 24.1.2001 is a copy of the notice under Section 160
Cr. P.C. issued by the P.S. Mayur Vihar. That under no circumstances can be said to
contain defamatory imputations.

The slander dated 4.12.2001, allegedly recording

misappropriation and allegation of the complainant

outraging modesty of the

complainant was again unproved. It was contended that in fact the complainant/petitioner
had been implicated in a criminal case and was issued with summons/notice by the
CRL.M.C. 650/2005

6 of 10

criminal court which was later set aside on revision, on 1.3.2001, on the ground of
limitation.
14.

Counsel contended that each of the facts alleged were such that even if taken

together, could not be considered defamatory, since they were all allegations of public
interest. Admittedly Special Judge has seen the complaint against the petitioner, which
implicated several persons; a first information report No.6/2002 P.S. Mayur Vihar under
Section 420/468/120/34 IPC was registered against 11 persons including the
complainant/respondent for alleged embezzlement and misappropriation of funds. The
same was under investigation. For all these reasons the trial court and later the revisional
court correctly concluded that the petitioner that the case against the petitioner's could not
be allowed to proceed.
15.

Counsel lastly contended that the reasoning about legal infirmity with the order of

the courts below in setting aside the summoning order cannot be the only ground for
setting them aside as doing so would itself result in miscarriage of justice She placed
reliance upon the judgment of this court in B.P.Saha Vs. Dr. Vineet Suri, 134 (2006) DLT
616 to say that the putting the clock back in all cases where the courts dropped
proceedings by applying the rule in K.M,.Mathew Vs. State of Kerala, 1992(1) SCC 217
was not justified. It was submitted that the facts of this case do not warrant exercise of
discretionary powers to quash or interfere with the proceedings or orders of the courts
below.
16.

The factual narrative would show that according to the complaint there were four

alleged incidents which led to offences by the respondent accused. All these by and large
CRL.M.C. 650/2005

7 of 10

pertain to the petitioners' functioning as an office bearer of the society – the respondent
was admittedly Vice President though for a few months in 1994. It is also a mater of
record that Administrators were pointed to go into the functioning of the society and
adverse audit report against the society as well as office bearers was finalized, indicting
their role. Action was recommended. On the strength of these apparently a separate first
information report was lodged. These facts were not refuted. A copy of the FIR has been
filed and is a part of the record. The petitioner in his rejoinder has filed a copy of a final
report dated 16.7.2004 recommending that the offences of cheating, fraud, forgery were
not made out. As far as the allegation of assault on a lady resident, launching of criminal
proceedings and orders are concerned undeniably the petitioner was arrayed as accused ;
its is again matter of record that the criminal court issued process against him. That order
was however later set aside by the revisional court on the ground of bar of limitation.
17.

The courts below made the order dropping the charges against the

respondent/accused at a time when the judicial thinking was that the criminal courts – in
appropriate cases, having regard to the circumstances, could recall orders issuing
summons/dropping the proceedings. In this case the respondent had been summoned to
appear on 29.4.2002. His application for recall was made immediately upon receipt of the
summons, and before that date i.e. 27.4.2002.

The trial court made its order on

20.12.2003, recalling the summoning order and dismissing the complaint.
K.M.Mathew's case (supra), it was

In

held by the court that it was, open to the accused,

upon receipt of the summons, to plead before the Magistrate, (who has to try an offcence
only when allegation existed about commission of the offences) that the process issued
CRL.M.C. 650/2005

8 of 10

ought not to have been issued and that if the Magistrate was satisfied with such argument,
he could drop the proceedings. This view of the law held the field for more than a decade
i.e. 12 years. It was eventually overruled by the judgment in Adalat Prasad (supra) on
25.8.2004.
18.

The facts of this case show that the trial court recalled the summoning order and

dropped the criminal proceedings much before the ruling in Adalat Prasad's case
(supra); it did so on 20.12.2003. In the judgments of this court noticed above i.e.
B.P.Saha's case (supra) as well as Joginder Kumar Vs. Shamsher Singh Malik & Anr.,
(2007 (1) JCC 8), (Criminal RP No.437/2000, decided on 29.11.2006) it was held that
this court has the power under Section 482 to set aside the orders of the Magistrate which
may be vitiated, in respect of accused, against whom there was no material. The court in
Joginder Kumar's case (supra) held that Section 482 is wide; it saves the inherent powers
of the court to exercise and intercede if the justice of the case so warrants. In both the
judgments, the Court held that lack of jurisdiction alone need not be the criteria for
adjudging whether an order resulting summons made by the Magistrate, is illegal. The
Court should see whether the justice of the case so warrants such an order.
19.

In view of the above discussion while there can be no two opinions about the

applicability of the law after Adalat Prasad's case (supra) and the limited scope of
proceeding before the Magistrate in summons cases, yet, unless the exercise of power by
trial court through orders made before Adalat Prasad's case (supra) decision was
rendered, occasioned or resulted in failure of justice, the court would desist from
exercising its inherent powers. The facts of this case show that the barring one letter,
CRL.M.C. 650/2005

9 of 10

there is serious dispute about the authorship of letters said to have been issued by the
respondent, he disputed the pamphlet relied upon. At the relevant time when certain
issues were raised by him, an audit report did exist and a criminal case was pending
against the petitioner. On an over view of these attendant circumstances I am satisfied
that the irregularity if any by the revisional court in not interfering with the trial court's is
dismissing the complaint, has not resulted in failure of justice.
20.

For the above reasons, the petition has to fail; it is accordingly dismissed. In the

circumstances of the case the parties are left to bear their own costs.
