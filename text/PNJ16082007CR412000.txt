1.

This revision petition challenges the orders

dated 27.3.99 and 7.8.99 passed by the learned Civil
Judge, Delhi.
2.

Petitioner was defendant no.2, respondent no.1

was plaintiff, respondent no.2 was defendant no.1 in the
original suit. Respondents nos. 3 to 9 are the legal heirs of
defendant no.3 in the original suit. I shall be referring to
the parties as plaintiff and defendant respectively.
3.

Vide impugned order dated 27.3.99, suit filed by

C.R.P. No. 41/2000

Page 1 of 9

the plaintiff under Section 6, Specific Relief Act, 1877 was
decreed and plaintiff was held entitled to the possession
of suit property and the printing press lying therein. Vide
order dated 7.8.99, noting that in the plaint relief prayed
for was limited to the extent of possession of suit
property, earlier order dated 27.3.99 was modified and
plaintiff was held entitled to the possession of only suit
property.
4.

Relevant facts necessary to be noted are that

plaintiff, Abdul Naim, filed a suit for possession under
Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, alleging forcible
dispossession from the suit property by defendants Nos. 1
to 3. The subject-matter of the suit was property bearing
No.2741, Mohalla Nariyan (behind G.B. Road), Delhi.
5.

property. Partnership firm was a tenant in the suit
property and was paying rent @ Rs.30/- per month to the
landlord, Hamid-ul-Islam, defendant no.1.
c)

On 2.2.70, partnership between plaintiff and

defendant no.2 dissolved A settlement was arrived at.
Ex.PW7/1 to Ex.PW7/3 records the said settlement and
bears the signatures of both plaintiff and defendant no.2.
Plaintiff took over all the rights and liabilities of the
partnership firm which included the tenancy rights.
d)

After the said dissolution, plaintiff continued

running the printing press under the name and style of
'M/s Jayco Printers' as proprietor thereof;
e)

Defendant no.2 in connivance with defendant

no.1 and 3 on 25.5.1973 wrongfully dispossessed the
plaintiff from the suit property.
6.

Per contra, defendants no. 1 to 3 denied the

averments made in the plaint. In essence, case set up by
the defendants no. 1 to 3 is as follows:
a)

Defendant no.2 was the tenant in the suit

property and was paying rent @ Rs.8/- per month to the
defendant no.1.
b)

Defendant no.2 was running the printing press

C.R.P. No. 41/2000

Page 3 of 9

from the suit property under the name and style of 'M/s
Jayco Printers' It was a sole proprietorship concern with
defendant no.2 as its proprietor.
c)

Plaintiff had no concern whatsoever with the

suit property, printing press or 'M/s Jayco Printers'.
7.

A perusal of the decision of the trial judge as

also record of the trial court show that evidence was
adduced by the parties in support of their respective case.

9.

Learned Judge has further noted that oral

evidence adduced by the plaintiff also corroborates the
version of the plaintiff.
10.

Defendants examined 8 witnesses who deposed

that there was no oral tenancy between the plaintiff and
the defendant no.1. That there was no partnership
between plaintiff and defendant no.2. That defendant no.2
was the sole proprietor of 'M/s Jayco Printers'.
11.

No documentary evidence was produced by the

C.R.P. No. 41/2000

Page 6 of 9

defendants.
12.

Insofar as evidence led by the defendants is

concerned, suffice would it be to note following two
discrepancies noted by the learned Trial Judge:i)

It was the case of the defendants that plaintiff

had no concern whatsoever with 'M/s Printing Press'.
However, Mohd Sharif in his testimony as DW-5 stated
that he had seen the plaintiff working in the press. (His
testimony is at page 71 of the trial court record).
ii)

Plaintiff had averred that on 2.2.70 i.e. at the

time of dissolution of partnership between him and
defendant no.2, a settlement was arrived which was
recorded in Ex.PW7/1 to Ex.PW7/3 (Pg 159-163). It was
further averred that Ex.PW7/1 to Ex.PW7/3 bears the
signatures of both plaintiff and defendant no.2. In his
testimony as DW-8, defendant no.2 has admitted that said
exhibits were prepared by his munshi and that it bears his
signatures. (Testimony of DW-8 is at page 76 of the trial
court record).
13.

Additionally, I note that defendants had not

produced any documentary evidence such as bills, cash
memo etc to show that defendant no.2 was carrying the
C.R.P. No. 41/2000

Page 7 of 9

business of printing press under the name and style of
'M/s Jayco Printers”. Non-production of any documentary
evidence requires an adverse inference to be drawn
against the defendants.
14.

Noting the rival contentions as also evidence

adduced by both the parties, particularly, documentary
evidence produced by the plaintiff and the fact that
Section 6, Specific Relief Act,1877 provides a remedy of
restoring possession on proof that the plaintiff had
possession and he has been wrongfully dispossessed,
learned Trial Judge decreed the suit of the plaintiff. It has
been held that plaintiff has successfully established that
he was the tenant in the suit property and that he was
forcibly dispossessed from the suit property by the
defendants no 1 to 3.
15.

Aggrieved by the decision of the learned Trial

Court, defendant no.2 has filed the instant revision
petition.
16.

Learned counsel for the petitioner/defendant

no.2 contended that the learned Trial Court has not
correctly appreciated evidence led by the defendants.
That the learned Trial Court has erred in placing reliance
C.R.P. No. 41/2000

Page 8 of 9

upon documents such as cash memo, bills etc produced
by the plaintiff for the reason said documents were false,
fabricated and prepared at the instance of the plaintiff.
17.

Scope of challenge in a revision petition is

limited. Petitioner cannot call upon this court to reappreciate the evidence. (See the decisions of the
Supreme Court in Ram Dass v Davinder, (2004) 3 SCC 684
and Kempaiah Vs. Chikkaboramma, (1998) 6 SCC 667.
18.

Having gone through lengthy discussion of

evidence, documentary and oral, as contained in the
judgment of the trial court, I am satisfied that no fault can
be found with the manner in which the evidence has been
appreciated by the learned Trial Court.
19.

C.R.P. No. 41/2000 is accordingly dismissed.

20.

No costs.
