These are three petitions all arising out of dispute
between the parties under a contract awarded by the
respondent to the petitioner for construction of its main R & D
Building at Chattarpur, Mehrauli Mandi Gaon Road, New Delhi.
One of these three petitions is under Section 11 and the
OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 1 of 23

second is under Section 9 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,
1996. The third petition is an execution petition which seeks to
execute the arbitral award dated 19.2.2003 in favour of the
petitioner that became final consequent upon dismissal of the
objections of the respondents against the said award vide
judgment dated 18.5.2005 passed by this Court in OMP No.
228/2003. The arbitral award dated 19.2.2003 which is sought
to be executed is in the sum of Rs.1,32,27,137/- with interest
at 9% p.a in favour of the petitioner.
The brief facts of the case giving rise to these three
petitions are as follows.
The respondent had awarded a contract to the
petitioner for construction of its main R & D Building at
Chattarpur, Mehrauli Mandi Gaon Road, New Delhi. The
contract was awarded on 18.2.1999. In terms of the contract,
the work was to be completed by the petitioner within 30
months i.e by 18.8.2001. The work under the contract was
actually completed by the petitioner on 31.3.2005. The
contract between the parties provided for extension of time

OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 2 of 23

and the relevant clauses in the contract relating to extension of
time are Clauses 44.1 to 44.3 and the same are extracted
below:
“44.1 Extension of Time for Completion
The work shall throughout the stipulated
period
of the Contract be proceeded with
due diligence. If the works be delayed by:i)

force majure or

ii)

abnormally bad weather, or

iii)

serious loss or damage by fire, or

iv) civil commotion, local commotion of
workmen, strike or lockout, affecting any of
the trades employed on the Work, or
v)
delay on the part of other contractors or
tradesmen engaged by the C-DOT in
executing work not forming part of the
Contract, or
vi) non-availability of stores, which are the
responsibility of the C-DOT to supply, if any,
or
vii) non-availability or break down of tools
and plant to be supplied or supplied by the CDOT, if any, or
viii) any other cause which, in the absolute
discretion of the C-DOT is beyond the

causing
delay,
the
Contractor
shall
immediately give notice thereof in writing to
OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 3 of 23

the Engineer, but shall nevertheless use
constantly his best endeavours to prevent or
make good the delay and shall do all that may
be reasonably required to the satisfaction of
the Engineer to proceed with the Work.
44.2 Request for Extension of Time
Request for extension of time, to be eligible
for consideration, shall be made by the
Contractor in writing within fourteen days of
the happening of the event causing delay on
the prescribed form to the Engineer under
intimation to C-DOT. The Contractor may also,
if practicable, indicate in such a request the
period for which extension is desired.
44.3 Grant of Extension of Time
In any such case the C-DOT may give a fair
and reasonable extension of time for
completion of the Work. Such extension shall
be communicated to the Contractor by the
Engineer in writing within 3 months of the
date of receipt of such request. Non
application by the Contractor for extension of
time shall not be a bar for giving a fair and
reasonable extension by the C-DOT and this
shall be binding on the Contractor.”
The contract also provides for compensation for
delay in execution of the contract and the relevant clause in
this regard is Clause 47.1 and the same is extracted below:
“47.1

Compensation For Delay

If the Contractor fails to maintain required
progress in terms of the Contract or to
complete the Work and fails to clear the Site
OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 4 of 23

on or before the stipulated or extended date of
completion, he shall, without prejudice to any
other right or remedy of the C-DOT on account
of such breach be liable to pay agreed
compensation of an amount equal to 1/2%
(Half percent) of the Contract Sum/Price or
such smaller amount as the C-DOT may
decide, for every week the progress remain
below the agreed progress schedule or that
the Work/phase remains incomplete. The
decision of the C-DOT in writing shall be final
and binding on the Contractor.
Provided always that the total amount of
compensation for delay to be paid under this
clause shall not exceed 10% (Ten Percent) of
the Contract Sum of the Work or of the
Contract Sum/Price of the item or group of
items of work, as shown in the letter of
acceptance, for which a separate period of
completion is originally given.
The amount of compensation may be adjusted
or set off against any sum payable to the
Contractor under this or any other contract
with the C-DOT.”
The contract between the parties further provides for
arbitration in the event any dispute or difference may arise
between them under the said contract. The relevant clause in
this regard is Clause 67.1 and the same is extracted herein
below:“67.1

Disputes

and

Page Number 5 of 23

Except where otherwise provided in the
Contract all questions and disputes relating to
the meaning of the specifications, design,
drawings and instructions herein before
mentioned and as to the quality of workmanship
or materials used on the Work or as to any other
question, claim, right, matter or thing
whatsoever in any way arising out of or relating
to
the
Contract,
designs,

specifications, estimates, instructions, orders or
these conditions or otherwise concerning the
Work or the execution or failure to execute the
same whether arising during the progress of the
Work or after the cancellation, termination,
completion or abandonment thereof shall be
dealt with as mentioned hereinafter:i)
If the Contractor considers that he is
entitled to any extra payment or compensation
in respect of the works over and above the
amounts admitted as payable by the C-DOT or
in case the Contractor wants to dispute the
validity of any deduction or recoveries made or
proposed to be made from the Contract, the
Contractor shall forthwith give notice in writing
of his claim, in this behalf to the Engineer within
30 days from the date of disallowance thereto
for which the Contractor claims such additional
payment or compensation or disputes the
validity of any deduction or recovery. The said
notice shall give full particulars of the claim,
grounds on which it is based and detailed
calculations of the amount claimed and the
Contractor shall not be entitled to raise any
claim nor shall the C-DOT be in any way liable in
respect of any claim by the Contractor unless
notice of such claim shall have been given by
the Contractor to the Engineer in the manner
within the time as aforesaid. The Contractor

Page Number 6 of 23

shall be deemed to have waived and
extinguished all his rights in respect of any
claims not notified to the Engineer in writing in
the manner and within the time aforesaid.
ii)
The Engineer shall give his decision in
writing on the claims notified by the Contractor
within 30 days of the receipt of the notice
thereof. If the Contractor is not satisfied with
the decision of the Engineer, the Contractor
may within 15 days of the receipt of the
decision of the Engineer submit his claims to the
ED C-DOT for conciliation along with all details
and copies of correspondence exchanged
between him and the Engineer. The ED C-DOT
shall appoint the Conciliator.
Iii) If
the
conciliation
proceedings
are
terminated without a settlement of the disputes,
the Contractor shall, within a period of 30 days
of termination thereof shall give a notice in the
form prescribed by the C-DOT, to the ED C-DOT
for appointment of an Arbitrator to adjudicate
the notified claims, failing which the claims of
the Contractor shall be deemed to have been
considered absolutely barred and waived.
iv) Except where the decisions have become
final, binding and conclusive in terms of the
Contract, all disputes or differences arising out
of the notified claims of the Contractor as
aforesaid and all claims of the C-DOT shall be
referred for adjudication through the arbitration
by the Sole Arbitrator appointed by the ED CDOT. If the Arbitrator so appointed is unable or
unwilling to act or resigns his appointment or
vacates his office due to any reason
whatsoever, another Sole Arbitrator shall be
appointed in the manner aforesaid by the ED CDOT. Such person be entitled to proceed with
OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 7 of 23

the reference from the stage at which it was left
by his predecessor.
It is a term of the Contract that the party
invoking arbitration shall give a list of the
disputes with amounts claimed in respect of
each dispute along with the notice for
appointment of arbitrator.
It is also a term of the Contract that no person
other than a person appointed by the ED C-DOT
as aforesaid should act as an Arbitrator and if
for any reason that is not possible, the matter
shall not be referred to arbitration at all.
It is also a term of the Contract that the
Arbitrator shall adjudicate on only such disputes
as are referred to him by the ED C-DOT and give
separate award against each dispute and claim
referred to him. The Arbitrator shall give
reasons for the award.
It is also a term of the Contract that if any fees
are payable to the Arbitrator, these shall be paid
equally by both the parties.
The Conciliation and Arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the provision of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 or any
statutory modifications re-enactment thereof
and the rules made there under and for the time
being in force shall apply to the arbitration
proceeding under this clause.”
Since the petitioner could not complete the work
within the stipulated time period of 30 months, the petitioner
applied for extension of time from time to time. The time was
extended by the respondent upto 31.12.2003 without levy of
OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 8 of 23

any damages or compensation for delay in execution of the
work on the part of the contractor. However, the decision on
the request of the petitioner for further extension of time
beyond 31.12.2003 was kept pending by the respondent till the
time the petitioner would complete the work under the
contract.
Certain disputes had arisen between the parties
under the contract even before the work was actually
completed by the petitioner on 31.3.2005. The petitioner had
made certain claims which were referred for arbitration in
terms of Clause 67.1 referred above. The Arbitrator appointed
by the respondent gave an award of Rs.1,32,27,137/- with
interest at 9% p.a in favour of the petitioner (Contractor) on
19.2.2003. Aggrieved by the said award, the respondent filed
objections under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Act, 1996. Those objections were dismissed by this Court vide
its judgment dated 18.5.2005 passed in OMP No. 228/2003 and
thereby the interim award in favour of the petitioner being the
Contractor had acquired finality.

OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 9 of 23

Subsequent to the above referred interim award in
favour of the petitioner acquired finality, the petitioner in the
meanwhile, had completed the work under the contract on
31.3.2005. Thereafter, the respondent vide its decision taken
on 2.8.2005 decided to extend the time for completion of work
without levy of any damages till 20.7.2003 and thereafter up to
31.03.2005 subject to levy of compensation of 10% of the total
contract value for delay on the part of the petitioner in
execution of the work. On this decision being taken by the
respondent, a communication dated 23.8.2005 (Annexure P-7
at Page 247 of the paper book) was sent by the respondent to
the petitioner informing it that the respondent has decided to
levy liquidated damages of Rs.3,67,89,063/- at 10% of the
contract value in terms of Clause 47.1 of the contract. Vide
said communication the petitioner was further informed that
the respondent had decided to adjust the amount of interim
award in favour of the petitioner amounting to Rs.1,53,10,807/alongwith an amount of Rs.42 lacs allowed to it on account of
escalation for the period upto 20.7.2003 as per Clause 70.1 of
GCC. The petitioner was accordingly called upon to pay the
OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 10 of 23

balance amount of Rs.1,72,78,256/- to the respondent by
2.9.2005 failing which the petitioner was informed that the said
amount shall be recovered through encashment of bank
guarantees furnished by the petitioner.
It was at this stage when the petitioner received the
impugned

communication

dated

23.8.2005

from

the

respondent, the petitioner filed the petition under Section 9 of
the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 being OMP No.
309/2005 for an injunction against the respondents that they
should be restrained from encashing its bank guarantees as
threatened vide their letter dated 23.8.2005. Before petition
under Section 9 was filed, the petitioner had already filed an
execution petition being Ex.P.No. 126/2005 for execution of the
interim award dated 19.2.2003 in its favour. Later on, the
petitioner also filed a third petition in April, 2007 under Section
11 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking
appointment of an Arbitrator for reference of the dispute
pertaining to the levy of liquidated damages for delay in
execution

of

OMP No.309/2005

the

work

levied

by

the

respondent

as

Page Number 11 of 23

communicated to the petitioner vide communication dated
23.8.2005.
All the above petitions are taken up for hearing on
board together because focal point that arise for consideration
in all of them is whether the claim of the respondent to levy
liquidated damages as communicated vide communication
dated 23.8.2005 is final and binding on the petitioner and if so,
whether it falls under the category of 'Excepted Matters' and is,
therefore, no longer arbitrable. In case it is found that the levy
of liquidated damages by the respondent falls under the
category of 'Excepted Matters' and is thereby final and binding
on

the

petitioner

(Contractor),

then

in

that

event

the

respondent will be entitled to adjust the said amount by way of
adjustment against the amount it is liable to pay to the
petitioner in terms of interim award dated 19.2.2003. However,
if it is found that the demand of the respondent for alleged
liquidated damages does not fall in the category of 'Excepted
Matters' then in that event the petitioner would be entitled for
execution of the interim award dated 19.2.2003 and the

OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 12 of 23

petitioner would further be entitled to an injunction order
against the respondent restraining it from encashing the bank
guarantees till the claim of the respondent for liquidated
damages is decided by the Arbitrator under the contract.
Mr.Seth, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
respondent has vehemently argued that the decision of the
respondent to levy liquidated damages against the petitioner is
final and binding on the petitioner in terms of Clause 47.1 of
the contract referred above. He has relied upon several
judgments of the Supreme Court in Food Corporation of
India vs. Surendra, Devendra & Mahendra reported in
(2003) 4 SCC 80; G.M.Northern Railways vs. Sarvesh
Chopra reported in AIR 2002 SC 1272 Union of India vs.

Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. vs. SAW Pipes Ltd.,

2004(3) Arb.LR 379 (Madras) & Daewoo Motors India
Ltd. vs. Union of India & Ors. Reported in (2003) 4 SCC
690. On the strength of these judgments Mr.Seth has argued
that it would be a futile exercise to refer the matter relating to
levy of liquidated damages for arbitration because the decision
of the respondent thereon falls under the 'Excepted Matters'
and is, therefore, final and binding on the Contractor being the
petitioner herein. I do not consider it necessary to discuss all
these judgments separately because there is no dispute about
the legal proposition laid down therein that in case any claim
OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 14 of 23

falls under the category of 'Excepted Matters' then the same
cannot be referred for arbitration.
The question whether the claim of the respondent for
liquidated damages falls under the category of 'Excepted
Matters' or not is a question of fact and can best be decided
only by reference to the terms of the agreement between the
parties. In case upon interpretation of various clauses of the
contract it is found that the matter relating to liquidated
damages does not fall under the category of 'Excepted Matters'
then the above referred judgments relied upon by Mr.Seth
would be of no consequence.
Now, I proceed to examine the terms of the contract
between the parties to ascertain whether the liquidated
damages levied by the respondent vide its communication
dated 23.8.2005 fall under the category of 'Excepted Matters'
or not. Clause 44.3 of the contract between the parties is an
enabling clause conferring a discretion upon the respondent to
grant a fair and reasonable extension of time for completion of
the work. According to clause 44.3 the respondent could have

OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 15 of 23

extended the time either suo moto or on a request for such
extension made by the Contractor. In case the request for
extension of time was made by the Contractor (petitioner),
then

it

was

obligatory

upon

the

respondent

to

have

communicated its decision to the petitioner within three
months of the date of receipt of such request. Admittedly, the
time was extended by the respondent upto 31.12.2003 and the
request of the petitioner for further extension of time was kept
in abeyance till the time the petitioner would complete the
project work.
Clause 67.1 of the contract between the parties
provides for a scheme for settlement of dispute through
arbitration. A perusal of Clause 67.1 referred above would
show that it contains an inbuilt mechanism for resolution of
dispute that may arise between the parties under the contract.
As per the said clause, the Contractor in the first instance was
required to send a notice of his claim to the engineer of the
respondent and in case he was not satisfied with the decision
of the engineer then he could have made a representation to

OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 16 of 23

the ED C-DOT within 30 days of the decision of the engineer. In
case the Contractor was still not satisfied with the decision of
the engineer, he could have submitted his claim for conciliation
to the ED C-DOT and in that event the ED C-DOT was required
to appoint a Conciliator. It is provided in Clause 67.1 (iii) that if
the

conciliation

proceedings

were

to

terminate

without

settlement of the dispute, the Contractor could give a notice in
the form

prescribed within a period of 30 days of the

termination thereof to the ED C-DOT for appointment of an
Arbitrator to adjudicate the notified claims. Sub Clause (iv) of
Clause 67.1 provides that all disputes and differences arising
out of the notified claim of the Contractor and all claims of CDOT except those matters on which the decision of the
respondent was to be final, binding and conclusive were to be
referred for adjudication by a Sole Arbitrator to be appointed
by the ED C-DOT.
Whether the decision of the respondent to levy liquidated
damages has become final or not has not been dealt with by
Clause 67.1(iv) of the agreement. Mr. Seth has relied upon

OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 17 of 23

Clause 47.1 to urge that the respondent was well within its
right to levy compensation for delay on the part of the
petitioner in completing the project on formula agreed upon
between the parties as is mentioned in the said clause. I do not
find any substance in this argument advanced by Mr.Seth
appearing on behalf of the respondent. A plain reading of
Clause 47.1 of the contract (at Page 95 of the paper book)
would show that the right of the respondent to claim
compensation for delay in execution of the project work could
arise only on failure of the petitioner to complete the work and
clear the site on or before the stipulated or extended time
period. In this case the respondent had not taken any decision
on the request of the petitioner for extension of time till the
project work was completed on 31.3.2005. The respondent, on
the other hand, had issued a provisional completion certificate
to the petitioner on 24.5.2005 (Annexure P-4 at Page 201 of
the paper book) and in column 10 thereof has assessed the
performance of the Contractor as 'Good'

and in Column 9

which deals with liquidated damages (if any), it is mentioned
that extension of time case was under process. This document
OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 18 of 23

of the respondent by itself would imply an admission on the
part of the respondent that the request of the petitioner for
extension of time was not finalised on the date the project
work was completed by the petitioner on 31.3.2005.
After the petitioner had filed its execution petition
and a petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Act, 1996 (both of which were filed in 2005), a joint meeting
had taken place between the representatives of both the
parties on 7.7.2006 and in that meeting it was mutually agreed
upon between the parties that the C-DOT shall release
outstanding payments to the petitioner after the petitioner
would submit unconditional bank guarantees for a total sum of
Rs.3.67 crores to C-DOT. On the date this joint meeting was
held between the representatives of the parties on 7.7.2006,
the Bank Guarantees worth Rs. 3 crores furnished by the
petitioner were already lying with the respondent and,
therefore, it was agreed upon between the parties that the
petitioner would furnish guarantees only for the balance
amount of Rs.67 lacs. It was further agreed upon between the

OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 19 of 23

parties on that date that the bank guarantees would be
encashed by the respondent as per legal status of the matter
i.e in accordance with the orders of this Court in this regard.
The respondent had further assured the petitioner in its
meeting held on 7.7.2006 that the required confirmation
pertaining to extension of time for the period from 1.1.2004 to
31.3.2005 would be sent to the petitioner shortly. The minutes
of the meeting that took place between the representatives of
the parties on 7.7.2006 are at Page 22 of the case being
Arbitration Application No. 112/2007.
The respondent sent its reply regarding minutes of
the meeting that was held on 7.7.2006 to the petitioner vide its
letter dated 25.8.2006 which is not disputed by the learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent. A perusal of
the said letter of the respondent dated 25.8.2006 would show
that the respondent even on 25.8.2006 had informed the
petitioner that the details of extension of time could be
finalised only after the work was completed. All this clearly
shows that the respondent had not taken any decision on the

OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 20 of 23

request of the petitioner regarding extension of time till the
project work was completed on 31.3.2005. Had the respondent
taken a decision on the request of the petitioner for extension
of time one way or the other, then it would have enabled the
petitioner to exhaust its remedy as provided to him in Clause
67.1 of the contract referred above. Now, the respondent
cannot turn around and say that they have taken a decision to
extend the time beyond 20.7.2003 upto 31.3.2005 subject to
levy of liquidated damages. In the considered opinion of this
Court the claim of the respondent for liquidated damages does
not fall within the category of 'Excepted Matters' as provided in
Clause 67.1 (iv) of the contract. The learned counsel for the
respondent could not tell, when asked, whether there is any
clause in the contract which entitles the respondent to levy
damages as a condition for extension of time after the
completion of the project work. The thrust of the argument of
Mr.Seth appearing on behalf of the respondent is that the
delay in completion of the project beyond 20.7.2003 for which
damages have been levied is wholly attributable to the
petitioner being the Contractor. The petitioner has denied the
OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 21 of 23

same. This gives rise to a dispute between the parties as to
whether the respondent is entitled to the damages for alleged
delay or not. This dispute obviously has to be decided by some
authority, whether by the Court or by the Arbitrator. In this
case, the parties had mutually agreed to refer their disputes
that may arise between them under the contract for decision of
the Sole Arbitrator to be appointed by the respondent.
The petitioner has made certain claims against the
respondent which the respondent has already referred to the
Arbitrator vide its communication dated 8.11.2007 which has
been placed on record. Since the claim of the petitioner has
already been referred by the respondent for arbitration, it
would be appropriate in case the respondent may also prefer
its claim for liquidated damages before the same Arbitrator
before whom the claims of the petitioner are pending for
adjudication. Since the claim of the respondent for liquidated
damages is yet to be adjudicated by the Arbitrator, it would be
expedient and in the interest of justice to direct the petitioner
to keep the bank guarantees alive till the decision by the

OMP No.309/2005

Page Number 22 of 23

Arbitrator on the said claim of the respondent. Accordingly, the
petitioner is hereby directed to keep the bank guarantees alive
till the decision of dispute with regard to the claim of the
respondent for liquidated damages is adjudicated by the
Arbitrator. The respondent is directed not to encash the said
bank guarantees without prior permission of the Court or till
the decision of the Arbitrator, whichever is earlier. In the
meanwhile, the respondent is directed to make payment of the
amount in terms of the interim award dated 19.2.2003 to the
petitioner within a period of four weeks from today.
In view of the above, all these petitions stand
disposed of leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
