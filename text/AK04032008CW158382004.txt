The respondent/applicant contended that the petitioner has

challenged the award dated 23rd, August, 2003 passed by the
Industrial Tribunal-I in I.D.No.109/2001 in the present writ petition
under which the petitioner was directed to pay remaining back wages
to the respondent. Another writ petition No.2372/2001was filed and
the application of 17B under Industrial Disputes Act,1947 was
allowed by the order dated 8th January,2003, and the petitioner was
directed to pay the wages to the respondent but the payment of said
wages was below the Minimum Wages and the respondent/applicant

therefore,

contended that he is entitled to revised last drawn wages @ Rs.7,500/per month. The respondent also submitted that in W.P.C.2372/2001
the order dated 7th August, 2000 of the Industrial Tribunal was setaside and the matter was remanded back for fresh adjudication. The
respondent/applicant stated that the payment was stopped to him
w.e.f. June‟2007. The respondent stated that he has been unemployed
and has not been working in any establishment anywhere, and his
whole family is totally depend upon him. He asserted that due to his
unemployment it is very difficult for him to support himself and his
family members which consist of his disabled wife, old mother, three
young daughters and two minor sons. The respondent prayed to allow
this application otherwise the respondent/applicant shall suffer

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

irreparable loss and injury.

An affidavit has also been filed by the

respondent/ Sh. Krishna Pal, R/o Village & Post Dhanora Silver
Nagar, District Bhagpat, U.P., presently at Delhi to this effect.

3.

A reply has been filed on behalf of petitioner/non applicant that

the application of the respondent/applicant is not maintainable as he
has not shown that any efforts were made by him to secure a job. The
petitioner contended that the respondent cannot be allowed to take
advantage of his own lethargy. The petitioner/non-applicant denied
the plea of the respondent that he is jobless from the date of his
termination. It was admitted by the petitioner/management that the
payment was stopped w.e.f. June 2007.

The petitioner argued that

the respondent was paid wages under section 17B in W.P.(C)
2372/2001 till May 2007 as per the court order dated 8th January,
2003. On 24th May 2007 the writ petition 2372/2001 was allowed
and the order dated 7th August 2000 passed by the Industrial
Tribunal was set aside and the case was remanded back to Tribunal
for fresh adjudication. The petitioner/non-applicant pleaded that the
application filed by the petitioner/Corporation under section 33(2) (b)
is

still

pending

before

the

Industrial

Tribunal

and

the

respondent/applicant is not entitled for relief under section 17B till
the disposal of the case. The petitioner/non-applicant submitted that
the application be dismissed as the applicant is not unemployed as it

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

Page 3 of 14

is very difficult for the respondent to survive with his family members
for such a long period without any job.

4.

Provisions of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

comes into operation when an Award directing reinstatement of a
workman is assailed in further proceedings. The statute requires
satisfaction of the following four conditions:
(i)

(ii)

during the pendency of such proceedings, employer
is required to pay full wages to the workman;

(iii)

the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any
maintenance allowance admissible to him under
any Rule;

(iv)

5.

an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in proceedings in a High Court or the
Supreme Court;

such wages would be admissible only if the
workman had not been employed in any
establishment during such period and an affidavit
had been filed to such effect

While considering an application under this provision it is

necessary to bear in mind that the spirit, intendment and object
underlying the statutory provision of Section 17B is to mitigate and
relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship resulting to a workman due
to delay in the implementation of an award directing reinstatement of

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

Page 4 of 14

his services on account of the challenge laid to it by the employer. The
preliminary consideration for making available such a relief to a
workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment. It
recognizes a workman‟s right to the bare minimum to keep body and
soul together when a challenge has been laid to an Award directing his
reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no inherent right of
assailing an order or an award by an industrial adjudicator by way of
an appeal. The payment which is required to be made by the employer
to the workman has been held to be akin to a subsistence allowance
which is neither refundable nor recoverable from a workman even if
the Award in his favor is set aside by the High Court. In 1999 (2) SCC
106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex Court was
of the view that the object under Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the hardship
that is caused to the workman due to the delay in implementation of
the Award. While consideration of the payment which is required to be
made by the employer to the workman in this behalf, the Apex Court
observed as follows:
“21. As indicated earlier Section 17B has been enacted by
Parliament with a view to give relief to a workman who
has been ordered to be reinstated under the Award of a
Labour Court or the Industrial Tribunal during the
pendency of proceedings in which the said award is under
challenge before the High Court or the Supreme Court.
The object underlying the provision is to relieve to a
certain extent the hardship that is caused to the workman

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

Page 5 of 14

due to delay in the implementation of the award. The
payment which is required to be made by the employer to
the workman is in the nature of subsistence allowance
which would not be refundable or recoverable from the
workman even if the award is set aside by the High Court
or this Court. Since the payment is of such a character,
Parliament thought it proper to limit it to the extent of the
wages which were drawn by the workman when he was in
service and when his services were terminated and
therefore used the words „full wages last drawn‟. To read
these words to mean wages which would have been drawn
by the workman if he had continued in service if the order
terminating his services had not passed since it has been
set aside by the award of the Labour Court or the
Industrial Tribunal, would result in so enlarging the
benefit as to comprehend the relief that has been granted
under the award that is under challenge. Since the
amount is not refundable or recoverable in the event of
the award being set aside, it would result in the employer
being required to give effect to the award during the
pendency of the proceedings challenging the award before
the High Court or the Supreme Court without his being
able to recover he said amount in the event of the award
being set aside. We are unable to construe the provisions
contained in Section 17B to cast such a burden on the
employer. In our opinion, therefore, the words „full wages
last drawn‟ must be given their plain and material
meaning and they cannot be given the extended meaning
as given by the Karnataka High Court in Visveswaraya
Iron & Steel Ltd. or the Bombay High Court in Corona
Sahu Co. Ltd.
22. xxxx
23. As regards the powers of the High Court and the
Supreme Court under Articles 226 and 136 of the
Constitution, it may be stated that Section 17B, by
conferring a right on the workman to be paid the amount
of full wages last drawn by him during the pendency of

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

Page 6 of 14

the proceedings involving challenge to the award of the
Labour Court, Industrial Tribunal or National Tribunal in
the High Court or the Supreme Court which amount is
not refundable or recoverable in the event of the award
being set aside, does not in any way preclude the High
Court or the Supreme Court to pas an order directing
payment of a higher amount to the workman if such
higher amount is considered necessary in the interest of
justice. Such a direction would be dehors the provisions
contained in Section 17B and while giving the direction,
the Court may also give directions regarding refund or
recovery of the excess amount in the event of the award
being set aside. But we are unable to agree with the view
of the Bombay High Court in Elpro International Ltd. that
in exercise of the power under Articles 226 and 136
granted under Section 17B. The conferment of such a
right under Section 17B cannot be regarded as a
restriction on the powers of the High Court or the
Supreme Court under Articles 226 and 136 of the
Constitution.”

The

petition

has

contended

in

his

reply

to

the

respondent/applicant that it is not possible for the respondent to have
survived without a job since his termination. However, the contention
of the workman/applicant is that he is not gainfully employed in any
establishment. “Gainful employment in an establishment‟ has been
held by the Apex Court as not a self employment. In Rajinder Kumar
Kundra v. Delhi Administration, (1984) 4 SCC 635 while considering
the question relating to award of back wages, the Supreme Court had
held:

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

Page 7 of 14

“It was next contended on behalf of the appellant that
reinstatement with full back wages be awarded to him.
Mr. P.K. Jain, learned Counsel for the employer countered
urging that there is evidence to show that the appellant
was gainfully employed since the termination of service
and therefore he was not entitled to back wages. In
support of this submission Mr. Jain pointed out that the
appellant in his cross-examination has admitted that
during his forced absence from employment since the date
of termination of his service, he was maintaining his
family by helping his father-in-law Tara Chand who owns
a coal depot, and that he and the members of his family
lived with his father-in-law and that he had no alternative
source of maintenance. If this is gainful employment, the
employer can contend that the dismissed employee in
order to keep his body and soul together had taken to
begging and that would as well be a gainful employment.
The gross perversity with which the employer had
approached this case has left us stunned. If the employer
after an utterly unsustainable termination order of service
wants to deny back wages on the ground that the
appellant and the members of his family were staying with
the father-in-law of the appellant as there was no
alternative source of maintenance and during this period
appellant was helping his father-in-law of the appellant as
there was no alternative source of maintenance and
during this period appellant was helping his father-in-law
Tara Chand who had a coal depot, it cannot be said that
the appellant was gainfully employed. This cannot be said
to be gainful employment so as to reject the claim for back
wages. There is no evidence on the record to show that
the appellant was gainfully employed during the period of
his absence from service. Therefore, the appellant would
be entitled to full back wages and all consequential
benefits.”

7.

Since the section itself mentions „employment in establishment‟

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

Page 8 of 14

self employment quite apparently is not in contemplation. Workman
can be denied the benefits under Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act only when it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court
that the workman has been employed and has been receiving
adequate remuneration during the period of pendency of the writ
petition. It is thus well settled that transient employment by the
workman does not affect his entitlement to receive wages pending
decision; that is to say that, the benefit of Section 17B of the Act
cannot be denied merely because the workman is engaged in some
activity or in some vocation to eke out his livelihood. Such relief can
be denied only if it is proved that the workman is gainfully employed
in some establishment and is receiving adequate and regular
remuneration which is not the case with the applicant.

8.

While considering an application under Section 17B of the

Industrial Disputes Act, the Court cannot go into the merits of the
case in the writ petitioner. It was so held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000
(5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.

9.

A single judge of this Court had culled the principles laid down

in various judicial pronouncement for grant of interim relief under
Section 17 B of the Act in 134 (2006) DLT 49, Food Craft Instt. Vs
Rameshwar Sharma & anr which are as under:

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

Page 9 of 14

(i)
An application under Section 17B can be made only
in proceedings wherein an industrial award directing
reinstatement of the workman has been assailed.
(ii)
This Court has no jurisdiction not to direct
compliance with the provisions of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act if all the other conditions
precedent for passing an order in terms of the Section
17B of the Act are satisfied [Re : (1999) 9 SCC 229
entitled Choudhary Sharai v. Executive Engineer,
Panchayati Raj Department & Anr.].
(iii)
As the interim relief is being granted in exercise of
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
the High Court can grant better benefits which may be
more just and equitable on the facts of the case than the
relief contemplated by Section 17B. Therefore, dehors the
powers of the Court under Section 17B, the Court can
pass an order directing payment of an amount higher
than the last drawn wages to the workman [Re : (1999) 2
SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kirtikumar T. Patel].
(iv) Such higher amount has to be considered necessary
in the interest of justice and the workman must plead and
make out a case that such an order is necessary in the
facts of the case.
(v)
The Court can enforce the spirit, intendment and
purpose of legislation that the workman who is to get the
wages from the date of the award till the challenge to the
award is finally decided as per the statement of the
objections and reasons of the Industrial Disputes
(Amendment) Act, 1982 by which Section 17B was
inserted in the Act [Re : JT 2001 (Suppl.1) SC 229, Dena
Bank v. Ghanshyam (para 12)].
(vi)
An application under Section 17B should be
disposed of expeditiously and before disposal of the writ

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

Page 10 of 14

petition [Re : 2000 (9) SCC 534 entitled Workman v.
Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd.].
(vii) Interim relief can be granted with effect from the
date of the Award [Re : JT 2001 Supplementary (1) SC
entitled Regional Authority, Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam;
2004 (3) AD (DELHI) 337 entitled Indra Perfumery
Company v. Sudarshab Oberoi v. Presiding Officer].
(viii) Transient employment and self-employment would
not be a bar to relief under Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act [Re : 2000 (1) LLJ 1012 entitled Taj Services
Limited v. Industrial Tribunal; 1984 (4) SCC 635 entitled
Rajinder Kumar Kundra v. Delhi Administration; 109
(2004) DLT 1 entitled M/s. Birdhi Chand Naunag Ram
Jain v. P.O., Labour Court No. IV & Others].
(ix) The Court while considering an application under
Section 17B of the ID Act cannot go into the merits of the
case, the Court can only consider whether the
requirements mentioned in Section 17B have been
satisfied or not and, if it is so, then the Court has no
option but to direct the employer to pass an order in
terms of the statute. It would be immaterial as to whether
the petitioner had a very good case on merits [Re : 2000
(5) AD Delhi 413 entitled Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander].
(x) A reasonable standard for arriving at the conclusion
of the quantum of a fair amount towards subsistence
allowance payable to a workman would be the minimum
wages notified by the statutory authorities under the
provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 in respect of
an employee who may be performing the same or similar
functions in scheduled employments. [Re: Rajinder Kumar
Kundra v. Delhi Administration, (1984) 4 SCC 635; Sanjit
Roy v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1983 SC 328; decision
dated 3rd January, 2003 in Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 3654
& 3675/1999 entitled Delhi Council for Child Welfare v.
Union of India; DTC v. The P.O., Labour Court No. 1,

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

Page 11 of 14

Delhi & Ors., 2002 II AD (Delhi) 112 (para 12, 13)]
(xi) Interim orders directing payment to a workman can
be made even on the application of the management
seeking stay of the operation and effect of the industrial
Award and order. Such interim orders of stay sought by
the employer can be granted unconditionally or made
conditional subject to payment or deposits of the entire or
portion of the awarded amount together with a direction
to the petitioner employer to make payment of the wages
at an appropriate rate to the workman. Such an order
would be based on considerations of interests of justice
when balancing equities.
(xii)
For the same reason, I find that there is no
prohibition in law to a direction by the Court to make an
order directing payment of the wages with effect from the
date of the Award. On the contrary, it has been so held in
several judgments that this would be the proper course
[Re : Regional Authority, Dena Bank & Anr. v.
Ghanshyam, reported at JT 2001 (Suppl. 1) SC 229 and
Indra Perfumery Co. Thr. Sudershab Oberoi v. Presiding
Officer & Ors., 2004 III AD (Delhi) 337].
(xiii) While passing an interlocutory direction for payment
of wages, the Court may also secure the interests of the
employer by making orders regarding refund or recovery
of the amount which is in excess of the last drawn wages
in the event of the industrial award being set aside so as
to do justice to the employer.
(xiv) A repayment to the employer could be secured by
directing a workman to given an undertaking or offer
security to the satisfaction of the Registrar (General) of
the Court or any other authority [Re : para 12, 2002 (61)
DRJ 521 (DB), Hindustan Carbide Pvt. Ltd. v. Govt. of
NCT of Delhi & Ors.(supra)]
(xv) In exercise of powers under Article 226 and Article

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

Page 12 of 14

136 of the Constitution, if the requisites of Section 17B of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are satisfied, no order
can be passed denying the workman the benefit granted
under the statutory provisions of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 [Re: 1999 (2) SCC 106,
Dena Bank v. Kirtikumar T. Patel (para 23)].
(xvi) Gainful employment of the workman; unreasonable
and unexplained delay in making the application by the
workman after the filing of the petition challenging the
award/order; offer by the employer to give employment to
the workman would be a relevant factors and
consideration for the date from which the wages are to be
permitted.
(xvii)It will be in the interest of justice to ensure if the
facts of the case so justify, that payment of the amount
over and above the amount which could be directed to be
paid under Section 17B to a workman, is ordered to be
paid only on satisfaction of terms and conditions as would
enable the employer to recover the same [para 13 of
Regional Manager, Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam].
(xviii)The same principles would apply to any interim
order in respect of a pendentelite payment in favour of the
workman.

10.

In the present case the applicant has contended that he is not

employed in any establishment since the date of termination of his
services. Regarding the plea of the applicant that he is not gainfully
employed since the date of termination of his services, the denial by
the petitioner is without any particulars.

The petitioner/non

applicant has also not disclosed any material facts to show that the
applicant is gainfully employed and he is not entitled for last drawn

CM 14614/2007 in WP(C) 15838/2004

Page 13 of 14

back wages from the date of the award. Thus, the applicant fulfills the
criteria for availing the benefit under section 17B of the Act.

11.

For the foregoing reasons, the application is allowed. The

petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or minimum wages
whichever is higher from the date of the award, i.e., 23rd August,
2003. Learned counsel for the respondent/applicant states that the
minimum wages have been paid till May 2007.

Arrears from June

2007 be paid within four weeks. The petitioner shall continue to pay
minimum wages by 15th of every English calendar month during the
pendency of the present writ petition. The respondent is also directed
to file an undertaking that in case the writ petition is allowed, the
respondent shall refund/repay the difference of last drawn wages and
minimum wages within the time as shall be permitted by this Court.
The undertaking be filed by the respondent/applicant within four
weeks.
