V.B.Gupta, J.
The present appeal has been filed by the appellant
against the impugned judgment dated 18.09.07 passed by
Sh. A.S. Jayachandra, Judge, Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal

(for

short

as

“Tribunal”),

KKD,

Delhi

for

enhancement of the compensation amount.
2.

Brief facts leading to dispute are that on 20.11.05, the

Appellant and his elder brother Kamal kishore were
travelling

on

motor-cycle

from

Delhi

to

Sector-55,

Faridabad and when at about 12.55 p.m. reached Canara
bank, Town no.1, Faridabad, then a truck bearing no. HRMAC App No.218/2008

Page 2 of 9

38G-3162, driven by Respondent no.1 came from behind at
a very high speed driven rashly and negligently and hit
against the motorcycle of the deceased. Appellant received
serious grievous injuries all over his body and his elder
brother died on the spot.
3.

The Tribunal vide impugned judgment, awarded

compensation of Rs.4,08,484/- along with interest @ 7.5%
per annum towards the injuries sustained by the appellant.
4.

Aggrieved by the amount of compensation, the

present appeal has been filed by the appellant, seeking
enhancement of the compensation.
5.

It has been contended by Learned Counsel for the

appellant that the Tribunal erred in computing the income
of the appellant on the basis of Minimum Wages @
Rs.3,500/- per month whereas the deceased was actually
earning Rs.7,000/- p.m. The Tribunal has failed to consider
the future increase in the income of the Appellant due to
inflation and price rise. Further, the Tribunal has not
taken into consideration matrimonial prospects of the
MAC App No.218/2008

Page 3 of 9

appellant. No compensation for pain & suffering suffered
by the family members was awarded. The Tribunal erred
in paying the interest @ 7.5% only on the awarded
amount. It ought to have awarded the interest @ 18% p.a.
on the award amount from the date of the petition till
realization.
6.

Ld. Counsel also cited Ram Avtar v. Davinder Singh

& Ors., I (2008) ACC 70, Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v.
Vijay Kumar Mittal & Ors., 2007 (3) T.A.C. 397 (Del.)
and Managing Director, North East Karnataka Road

Trans. Corpn. v. T.Prabhakar and others, 2003 ACJ
1420 in support of its contentions.
7.

In the light of aforenoted facts and contentions, this

Court has to determine the „fairness‟ of the compensation
awarded by the Tribunal.
8.

Although the appellant has placed salary certificate

showing his income as Rs.7,000/- per month but the Ld.
Tribunal has not believed the said certificate as the
appellant himself stated in his statement that he was
MAC App No.218/2008

Page 4 of 9

drawing Rs.5,000/- per month in private service. Thus,
there are contradictions in the appellant‟s own case with
regard to his monthly income. The primary and best
evidence in this case to prove about the salary of Appellant
was his employer who could have thrown light on this
controversy as to what actual salary he was paying to the
appellant. For reasons best known to him, the appellant
has chosen not to produce the primary and best evidence
and as such inference has to be drawn against the
Appellant on this issue. Hence, in the absence of any
reliable evidence, the Tribunal had taken the help of
Minimum Wages Act to assess the monthly income of the
appellant which has been rightly done in this case.
Therefore in the absence of any documentary evidence, I
do not find any infirmity in the finding of the Tribunal on
this issue.
9.

The next question which arises for consideration is as

to whether the Ld. Tribunal is right in assessing functional
disability suffered by the Appellant as 30%?
MAC App No.218/2008

Page 5 of 9

10.

It was well established before the Tribunal that the

appellant had suffered fractures although he stated that
he had three fractures. Further, the Tribunal has observed
that in the cross examination by the insurance company it
was found that no rod is inserted into the legs of the
appellant. Further, the Appellant was admitted in Escort
Hospital, Faridabad only for one day. The Certificate
showed that the appellant suffered disability only to the
extent of 53% in his lower limb and the same was silent
with regard to the effects on all over body. The medical
expert was also not examined. Therefore, in the absence of
any evidence, the effect of disability affecting the whole
body was rightly taken as 30% by the Tribunal.
11.

It is now well settled that while estimating future loss

of income, the Court has to take into account future
prospects of the injured. No future prospects can be
considered in the present case as no evidence to this effect
was led by the appellant. Therefore, in the absence of any
proof with regard to the same, in view of Bijoy Kumar
MAC App No.218/2008

Page 6 of 9

Duggar v. Bidagar Dutta AIR 2006 SC 1255, the
contention regarding the future prospects is rejected.
12.

As

regards

to

the

contention

of

marriage

prospects, this point was not raised before the Tribunal
and for the first time, appellant is taking this plea
before this Court. Therefore, the same is not permitted
at this stage. Thus, the decision of Oriental Insurance

Co. Ltd. (supra) cited by learned Counsel for the
appellant is not applicable on the facts of the present
case.
13.

Further, the judgment of Ram Avtar (supra) cited

by Ld. Counsel for the appellant is not applicable to the
facts of present case. In that case, this Court enhanced
the compensation from one lac rupees to two lac
rupees as appellant suffered 66% disability. Further,
medical bills were placed and proved on record by the
appellant. In the present case, the bills are not
supported by prescriptions, and even then Ld. Tribunal
has granted actual expenses for medical.
MAC App No.218/2008

14.

In Managing Director, North East Karnataka

Road Trans. Corpn. (supra), the High Court of
Karnataka observed that
“In my considered view, non-examination of
the doctor is not fatal to the case of
claimants. It is permissible under law to
produce the wound certificates by the
claimants issued by the medical officer.”
15. In the present case, the Ld. Tribunal has already
assessed the disability of the whole body as 30% and has
granted
suffering;

compensation
Rs.71,884/-

of

Rs.60,000/-

for

actual

for

medical

pain

and

expenses;

Rs.15,000/- for special diet and conveyance ; Rs.21,000/for loss of earnings during the period of treatment for six
months even in the absence of any evidence; Rs.2,01,600/for loss of earnings owing to disability; Rs.30,000/- for loss
of amenities in the life, in the absence of evidence and
Rs.9,000/- for expenses on attendant for three months
even there is no evidence to this effect @ Rs.3,000/- per
month, totaling Rs.4,08,484/-.

MAC App No.218/2008

16.

As regards the award of interest @ 7.5% per

annum by the Tribunal, in a plethora of cases the Apex
Court and various High Courts have held that the rate
of

interest

would

depend

upon

the

facts

and

circumstances of each case. Award of interest would
normally depend upon the bank rate prevailing at the
relevant time. Therefore, this court is not inclined to
interfere on the said rate of interest.
17.

The compensation awarded by the learned tribunal is

just and fair. Accordingly, no infirmity can be found with
the order of learned Tribunal.
18.

The present appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
