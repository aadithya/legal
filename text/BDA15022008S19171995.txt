BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
IA. No.10706/2007 (U/O 6 Rule 17 read with Section 151 CPC)
1.

This application has been filed by the plaintiff seeking

amendments to the plaint.

The fact of the matter is that the trial had

commenced in this case sometime in 1998. The learned counsel for the
defendants has raised an objection to this application being allowed on the
ground that the proviso to Order 6 Rule 17 would come into play and such
an amendment cannot be allowed after the trial has commenced. The said

IA.No.10706.07 in CS(OS) 1917/1995

Page No.1 of 4

proviso stipulates that no application for amendment shall be allowed after
the trial has commenced, unless the court comes to the conclusion that in
spite of due diligence, the party could not have raised the matter before the
commencement of the trial.

2.

In response to this, the plaintiff who appears in person, submitted

that the proviso would not apply inasmuch as the amendment was brought
about in the year 2002 when the trial had already commenced. His second
submission is that even if the proviso applies, the court has power to allow
the amendment to do substantial justice between the parties.

3.

Having considered the arguments advanced by the counsel for

the parties on both sides, I am of the view that this application cannot be
allowed. The reasons are that the amendment was brought about in 2002
and would apply to all pending suits as well as future suits. In the suits
where the trial had already commenced, the amendments could only be
allowed if the court came to the conclusion that in spite of due diligence, the
parties seeking the amendment could not have raised the matter before the
commencement of the trial. In the present case, the application itself states
that the plaintiff, being under a bona fide impression and due to
inadvertence, missed to incorporate the details of the change in the salary
package of the relevant levels of employees of the defendant No.1. This is
stated in paragraph 6 of the application. It is further stated in paragraph 7
IA.No.10706.07 in CS(OS) 1917/1995

Page No.2 of 4

that the plaintiff has been able to collect from reliable sources the salary
structure of the relevant different levels [L-13 to L-16] of the employees of
the defendant No.1 which promotion prospects the plaintiff allegedly had
during the period 1992 to 2004. It is stated that the details that the plaintiff
intends to incorporate includes the estimated annual package payable and
levels in the period referred to above as well as the gross income of the
plaintiff for the corresponding period. It has not been indicated in the
application as to when this information came to the knowledge of the
plaintiff and as to whether he did not have this information at the time of the
commencement of the trial and as such could not have raised the matter
before the commencement of the trial. On the other hand, as indicated
above, the plaintiff has admitted his inadvertence in missing to incorporate
the details of the change in the salary package as already mentioned above.

4.

After the amendment to Order 6 Rule 17, an amendment can only

be allowed, after the trial has commenced, if the court comes to the
conclusion that in spite of due diligence, the parties could not have raised
the matter before the commencement of the trial. Nothing has been placed
on record to indicate that the plaintiff could not have raised these matters
before the commencement of the trial or that the plaintiff had exercised its
due diligence but in spite such due diligence it did not have the material
available before the commencement of the trial.
