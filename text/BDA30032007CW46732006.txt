BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.

The petitioner, by way of this petition, is challenging the order

dated 04.04.2006 whereby the petitioner's application for mutation and
conversion from lease hold to free hold in respect of the premises situated at
plot No.2, Block No. 159, known as 3, Bhagwan Dass Road, New Delhi was
rejected by the Deputy Land and Development Officer. The petitioner also
seeks the cancellation of the demand raised on 07.01.1997 in respect of
unearned increase to the tune of Rs.17,33,66,420/- as being contrary to the

WP(C)4673/2006

No.1 of 11

terms of the perpetual lease which, admittedly, is a government grant within the
meaning of the Government Grants Act,1895.

2.

Coming straightaway to the impugned order / letter dated 4.4.2006,

the same reads as under:
“ Sub : Premises situated on Plot No.2 Block No. 159 known
as 3 Bhagwan Dass Road, New Delhi.
Sir,
I am directed to refer to your conversion
application No.11322 dated 15.1.2000 for conversion of
aforesaid property from lease hold into freehold and to say
that your request for mutation was examined and it was found
that unearned increase to the tune of Rs.17,33,66,426/- in
addition to interest and other charges was recoverable.
Accordingly the demand was raised on 7.1.97. The amount
demanded has not been paid so far. Therefore your
application for mutation has been closed. Further, since you
are not the title holder of the property and in view of the
outstanding Govt. dues, your conversion application cannot
be considered. Your case for conversion is, therefore,
rejected as per clause 18.4 and 18.8 of conversion brochure. :
The conversion amount deposited by you is being
refunded separately.”
3.

The first submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner

is that the mutation of the property in favour of the petitioner ought to have
been granted and that the respondent could not have imposed the condition of
requiring the payment of unearned increase inasmuch as there was no such
provision in the perpetual lease which governs the relationship between the
parties. The second submission was that since the mutation ought to have been
WP(C)4673/2006

No.2 of 11

granted and the petitioner had paid the full conversion charges, the respondent
ought to have carried out the conversion from leasehold to freehold. The
learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on a decision of this court in
the case of Jor Bagh Association v Union of India : 112 (2004) DLT 690 to
contend that the perpetual lease was a government grant and that the
relationship between the parties would be entirely governed by the same
irrespective of any statutory provisions or instructions issued by the government
from time to time.

4

On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

respondent submitted that the unearned increase was being demanded from the
petitioner because of an office order dated 14.9.1949 issued by the Government
of India which provided that for leases in New Delhi Urban Area, unearned
increase ought to be charged at the time of transfer and it ought to be recovered
to the extent of 50% thereof in most cases and in the special cases relating to
land originally sold at concessional rates to Ruling Princes and Chiefs and to
others in the so called `Dewan's and Raises' area, the rate of unearned increase
should be at least 75%. He submits that the decision in the case of Jor Bagh
(supra) would not be applicable to the present case because in that decision
itself, the question of unearned increase was not gone into as would be evident
from paragraph 4 thereof. He further submitted that the present case would be
covered by a decision of a Division Bench in the case of Ansal & Saigal
WP(C)4673/2006

No.3 of 11

Properties (P) Ltd & Ors v L & D.O. & Ors : 74(1998) DLT 152 wherein,
according to him, the Division Bench had permitted the insertion of such a
condition in a supplementary lease deed to be executed after observing that it
was now the norm to introduce a clause for unearned increase in leases made by
the Government. The learned counsel for the respondent also submitted that
clause 11 of the lease required the lessee to take permission in writing prior to
the transfer of the lease hold rights. He also referred to clause 12 of the
perpetual lease deed to contend that, on the breach of any condition prescribed
under the lease, it was open to the lessor to re-enter the premises and to
determine the lease. In this context, he submitted that the transfer in question
was done without a written approval of the Central Government and, therefore,
the respondents were entitled to re-enter the premises and determine the lease.
However, instead of doing so they gave an option by a demand letter issued in
1997 to the petitioner to continue with the lease on payment of unearned
increase, ground rent, penalty and other charges. He submits that, it is in this
context, that the demand for unearned increase based on the office order
14.09.1949 was issued because the letter of 1997 ought to be construed as a
grant of fresh lease in favour of the petitioner.

5.

Before I discuss the rival contentions, it would be appropriate to set

out the facts.

The property in question was leased out originally to Lala

Sukhbir Sinha by virtue of a perpetual lease deed executed on 14.12.1920.
WP(C)4673/2006

No.4 of 11

Since clauses 11 and 12 of the lease deed are relevant, the same are set out
hereinbelow :
“11. The Lessee shall before every assignment or transfer of the
said premises hereby demised or any part thereof obtain
from the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, or such officer or body
as the Governor General in Council may authorise on this
behalf approval in writing of the said assignment or transfer
and all such assignees and transferees and the heirs of the
Lessee shall be bound by all the covenants and conditions
herein contained and be answerable in all respects therefor.
12.

6.

If any part of the said yearly rent hereby reserved or any part
thereof shall at any time be in arrear and unpaid for one
calendar month next after any of the said days whereon the
same shall have become due, whether the same shall have
been demanded or not / or if there shall have been in the
opinion of the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, or such officer or
body as the Governor General in Council may authorise on
this behalf whose decision shall be final, any breach by the
Lessee or by any person claiming through or under him of
any of the covenants or conditions therein before contained
and on his part to be observed or performed then and in such
case it shall be lawful for the Lessor or any person or
persons duly authorised by him notwithstanding the waiver
of any previous cause or right of re-entry upon any part of
the premises hereby demised or of the buildings thereon in
the name of the whole to re-enter and thereupon this demise
and everything herein contained shall cease and determine
and the Lessee shall not be entitled to any compensation
whatsoever.”

On 02.11.1928 Lala Sukhbir Sinha passed away and his property

devolved upon Shri A Sarup, Shri J. Sarup and Shri R. Sarup by virtue of a
Registered Partition Deed dated 02.11.1928. The property was subsequently
transferred by the Sarups to Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd in 1934 and

WP(C)4673/2006

No.5 of 11

subsequently in 1938 to Lala Murlidhar. There is no dispute with regard to
these transfers. On 14.09.1949, the said Government Office Order was issued.
Clause 1 thereof reads as under :
“1.

7.

Lease in respect of future allotment of Lands in the New
Delhi Urban Area, should provide for Government
claiming a portion of the unearned increase (i.e. the
difference between the original purchase price and current
market value) in the value of land, at the time of transfer
(whether such transfer is of an entire site or only of a part
thereof), the amount to be recovered being 50% of the
unearned increase. In the case of Land originally sold at
concessional rates to Ruling Princes and Chiefs, and to
other in the so called `Dewan's and Raises' Area, the
amount to be recovered will, however, be at least 75% of
the unearned increase.”
On 13.12.1949, Lala Murlidhar also passed away and the property

in question devolved upon his two sons Lala Shridhar and Lala Bansidhar. On
10.04.1956 they executed a registered deed in favour of Madan Mohan Lal Shri
Ram & Co. Pvt Ltd. Some time in 1961, the property was mutated in the name
of this company. On 21.01.1966 the name of the company was changed and the
consequential mutation was carried out by the L & DO in favour of Madan
Mohan Lal Shri Ram & Co. Pvt Ltd. Thus, it is clear that till 1966, there was
no dispute in respect of any of the transfers.

8.

On 09.01.1985 an Agreement to Sell was executed between Madan

Mohan Lal Shri Ram & Co. Pvt Ltd and the petitioner (Aditya Estates Pvt Ltd.).
On 25.05.1993 a Sale deed was executed and registered, pursuant to the said
WP(C)4673/2006

No.6 of 11

agreement. It must be pointed out that the sale deed was executed in favour of
the petitioner consequent to prolonged litigation which ultimately had the seal
of the court. It must also be pointed out that the competent authority under the
Income Tax Act, 1961 had also given its no objection by an order under Section
269(7) of the said Act on 10.03.1989. A Scheme of Arrangement under Section
391(1) and under Section 393 of the Companies Act, 1956 was under
contemplation of this court in CP 65/1991.

The Scheme of Arrangement

contemplated the transfer of the property from Madan Mohan Lal Shri Ram &
Co. Pvt Ltd to the present petitioner. The Central Government had consciously
given its no objection to the said Scheme of Arrangement on 14.8.1991 and by
an order dated 27.5.1992 passed in CP 65/1991, this court directed the said
Madan Mohan Lal Shri Ram & Co. Pvt Ltd to execute and register the
conveyance deed in favour of the vendee (the petitioner herein) after complying
with all the legal requirements. Again, by the same order dated 27.5.1992, the
court directed issuance of further notice to the Central Government and the
Official Liquidator and for a citation to be published in the newspaper.
Subsequently, on 02.11.1992, this court sanctioned the Scheme of Arrangement
and further directed that Madan Mohan Lal Shri Ram & Co Pvt Ltd shall
execute the formal conveyance deed in favour of the petitioner in respect of the
property in question.

WP(C)4673/2006

No.7 of 11

9.

It is consequent upon these proceedings that the sale deed dated

25.05.1993 came to be executed in favour of the petitioner. Thereafter, on
18.07.1996 the petitioner made an application for mutation of property in its
favour.

The application was made to the Land and Development Office.

Instead of mutating the property in favour of the petitioner, the respondent
(Land and Development Office) issued a demand letter dated 07.01.1997
indicating that the lessor would be pleased to consider the request for mutation
of the premises in question in favour of the petitioner if certain terms and
conditions mentioned therein were complied with in full and in advance. The
terms and conditions included the payment of unearned increase, ground rent,
penalty for sale without permission, misuse charges under various heads,
damages for unauthorised construction etc.

In this petition we are only

concerned with the question of unearned increase inasmuch as the petitioner
has no grievance with regard to the other terms and conditions. In fact, the
learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the ground rent, penalty, misuse
charges have all been paid. The only issue is with regard to the question of the
demand raised by the Land and Development Office with respect to unearned
increase amounting to Rs.17,33,66,426.00. Thereafter, the petitioner had been
requesting for mutation excluding the unearned increase condition.

On

15.01.2000 the petitioner applied to the Land and Development Office for
conversion of the property to freehold. All these proceedings culminated in the
said order dated 04.04.2006. By virtue of the order dated 04.04.2006 which has
WP(C)4673/2006

No.8 of 11

been extracted earlier in this judgment, it is clear that the application for
mutation was rejected on the ground that the unearned increase was not paid
and secondly the application for conversion was rejected on the ground that the
applicant was not the recorded lessee. Clauses 18.4 and 18.8 of the conversion
Brochure have been mentioned in the order dated 04.04.2006 and they read as
under:
“18.4. When the application is signed by a person who is not
eligible to apply for conversion.
18.8. When the charges payable under different heads
mentioned in the application form are not fully paid.”
It would also be relevant to note that, by another letter dated 04.04.2006, the
entire conversion charges of Rs.7,77,559.44 were returned to the petitioner.

10.

Essentially, the question which arises for consideration in the

present petition is :Whether, in the facts and circumstances narrated above, the
respondents can insist upon charging unearned increase from the petitioner as a
condition for granting mutation and for conversion of the plot in question from
freehold to leasehold ?

11.

As regards the question of charging unearned increase, it is more

than clear on an examination of the decision in Jor Bagh Association (supra)

WP(C)4673/2006

No.9 of 11

that such leases are government grants and they have to be construed in terms
of their own tenor notwithstanding any law to the contrary.

The learned

counsel for the respondents submitted that the Jor Bagh Association case did
not pertain to unearned increase but to damages and, therefore, the said decision
would not cover the present case.

I am unable to agree with this contention of

the learned counsel for the respondents.

The ratio of the decision in the Jor

Bagh Association (supra) is that such leases, which are government grants,
should provide for instances such as charging of damages, unearned increase
etc.

If they are not found to be part of the lease, then the lessors cannot be

charged such amounts as being condition of the lease.

Faced with this

position, the learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the petitioners
have committed breaches and the charging of unearned increase is merely a
condition for condoning the breach. In response to this Mr Rajiv Nayar, the
learned senior counsel, submitted, and in my opinion rightly so, that so far as
the question of transferring without permission is concerned, in the impugned
bill of demand itself the penalty for sale without permission at the rate of
Rs.3,000/- per annum from 25.05.1993 to 23.07.1996 amounting to Rs.9,477/has already been imposed. There is no difficulty insofar as the question of
making of payment towards this penalty is concerned. The petitioner is ready
and willing to pay the same. The only difficulty is with regard to item No.1 in
the said demand letter of 07.01.1997, which relates to unearned increase, which
is different from the penalty for sale without permission.
WP(C)4673/2006

No.10 of 11

12.

Insofar as the question of unearned increase is concerned, I am

clear in my mind, that the decision in the Jor Bagh Association (supra) would
apply and since there is no provision imposing such a charge, the same cannot
be collected from the petitioner. The aspect of the 1949 office order can also
be dealt with quite easily inasmuch as that applied to prospective leases and did
not apply to leases already granted. In this view of the matter, I find that the
respondents cannot insist upon charging unearned increase from the petitioner
as a condition for granting mutation. Accordingly, the impugned demand in
respect of unearned increase is set aside. As such, the two communications
dated 04.04.2006 stand set aside. The respondents are directed to process the
application for mutation and thereafter to process the application for conversion
from lease hold to free-hold.
No costs.
