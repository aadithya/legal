It appears that on 15th/16th October, 1971 the Income Tax

Authorities [particularly the Director of Inspection (Investigation)]
conducted a search and seizure operation in the residential as well as
business premises of the partnership firm and one of its partners,
namely, Shri Puran Mal.

The search and seizure operation was

conducted in Delhi, Hathras and Bombay. As a result of the operation,
114 silver bars lying deposited with the Laxmi Commercial Bank in
Delhi and Punjab National Bank in Delhi were seized by the
Respondents along with books of accounts and other documents.

3.

It was submitted by learned counsel for the Petitioners that

the silver bars belonged to Puran Mal (individual) and not to the
partnership firm. We need not go into this controversy since Puran Mal
(Individual) is not before us.

4.

Be that as it may, assessment proceedings were held and by

an assessment order dated 20th January, 1978 the income of the
partnership firm was assessed at Rs.4,58,808/-. This was revised at the
instance of the partnership firm and eventually the tax liability of the

WP (C) 5108/1993

Page 3 of 11

partnership firm was assessed at Rs.2,067/- by an assessment order
dated 31st May, 1979.

5.

Under these circumstances, the silver bars which were

seized (and perhaps retained due to the tax liability) being the subject
matter of an order under Section 132(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961
(for short the Act) were required to be released to the partnership firm.
Over a period of time, from 10th September, 1974 onwards till 25th
August, 1984, the silver bars were released to the partnership firm.

6.

For the first time on 8th October, 1990, the partnership firm

made a representation to the Commissioner of Income Tax at Bombay
(and not at Delhi) asking for payment of interest on the seized assets. It
may be noted in this regard that even though the search and seizure
proceedings were conducted at the instance of the Income Tax
Department in Delhi and the silver bars were seized in Delhi, the
partnership firm made a representation to the Income Tax Department at
Bombay. Learned counsel for the Petitioners was unable to explain this
except to say that because the partnership firm was being assessed at

WP (C) 5108/1993

Page 4 of 11

Bombay, a request was made to the Income Tax Department in Bombay
for payment of interest.

7.

Be that as it may, by a letter dated 28th February, 1992, the

partnership firm was informed that no interest could be paid on the
seized assets since they are not cash and, therefore, the provisions of
Section 132B of the Act would not be applicable.

8.

It is under these circumstances that the Petitioners have

filed the present writ petition wherein they have prayed for payment of
interest to the extent of Rs.16.3 crores or in any case a sum of Rs.7.43
crores as interest under Section 132B(4) of the Act on the seized assets.

9.

We are inclined to dismiss the writ petition for several

reasons.

10.

In the first place, the tax liability of the partnership firm

was assessed at Rs.2,067/- as far back as on 31st May, 1979 making it
quite clear to the partnership firm that it had become entitled to release

WP (C) 5108/1993

Page 5 of 11

of the silver bars. In spite of this, the partnership firm took no steps to
demand any interest or any compensation from the Respondents till as
late as on 8th October, 1990. There is no explanation forthcoming for
this delay of almost 11 years and under these circumstances, we do not
think that the Petitioners were really serious in making the claim.

11.

Secondly, there is no worthwhile explanation given by the

Petitioners for demanding interest from the Income Tax Authorities in
Bombay rather than in Delhi when the search and seizure operation was
orchestrated from Delhi and the silver bars were seized in Delhi. To say
that because the partnership firm was assessed in Bombay is being a
little non-serious to say the least. What is commonly understood as the
“cause of action” actually accrued in Delhi and there was no valid
justification for the Petitioners to approach the Income Tax Authorities
in Bombay for redressal.

12.

Thirdly, the claim of the Petitioners is essentially for

recovery of money and a writ petition under Article 226 of the
Constitution is hardly an appropriate remedy for this. The Petitioners

WP (C) 5108/1993

Page 6 of 11

can, if at all, file a civil suit for recovery of money where they would
have to justify their demand for such a huge amount of interest. Under
Article 226 of the Constitution we cannot look into these factual issues.
This is quite apart from the fact that a writ petition under Article 226 of
the Constitution is an inappropriate remedy for recovery of money.

13.

Finally, we are of the view that the Respondents are not

entitled to interest under Section 132 of the Act on seizure of assets.
The relevant provision of law is Section 132B (4) and this reads as
follows: -

“(4)(a)
The Central Government shall pay simple
interest at the rate of six per cent per annum on the amount
by which the aggregate amount of money seized under
section 132 or requisitioned under section 132A, as reduced
by the amount of money, if any, released under the first
proviso to clause (i) of sub-section (1), and of the proceeds,
if any, of the assets sold towards the discharge of the
existing liability referred to in clause (i) of sub-section (1),
exceeds the aggregate of the amount required to meet the
liabilities referred to in clause (i) of sub-section (1) of this
section.
(b)
Such interest shall run from the date
immediately following the expiry of the period of one
hundred and twenty days from the date on which the last of
the authorisations for search under section 132 or
requisition under section 132A was executed to the date of
WP (C) 5108/1993

Page 7 of 11

completion of the assessment under section 153A or under
Chapter XIV-B.”

14.

Among the assets that can be seized under Section 132 of

the Act are money, bullion, jewellery or any other valuable article or
thing. Silver bars cannot by any stretch of imagination be described as
money. Section 132B(4)(a) refers to payment of simple interest on the
aggregate amount of money seized under Section 132 of the Act. In
other words, where money is seized by the Respondents, they would be
obliged to pay interest thereon if the conditions of Sections 132B of the
Act are fulfilled but this provision is clearly inapplicable to bullion or
jewellery that is so seized.

15.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner was unable to point out

any decision which would support his point of view and we think that
that is so because the language of Section 132B(4) is quite clear in this
regard.

16.

It may be mentioned that learned counsel for the

Respondents submitted that action under Section 132 of the Act was not

WP (C) 5108/1993

Page 8 of 11

taken against the partnership firm but against Puran Mal (individual) but
we need not enlarge the scope of the controversy before us particularly
since there is no reason at all for the Petitioners to get the relief that they
have prayed for.

17.

Learned counsel for the Petitioners drew our attention to

Dimondstar Exports Ltd. & Ors. v. Director General of Income Tax &
Ors., (2005) 194 CTR 132 (Bombay). In this case, Respondents were
directed to return the gold, diamond, jewellery and ornaments seized
from petitioner No. 3 therein with interest @ 8% per annum on the value
of the jewellery and ornaments.

The cited decision is clearly

distinguishable for the reason that the question before the Bombay High
Court was the legality of the warrant of authorisation issued under
Section 132 of the Act.

The High Court held that the warrant of

authorisation itself was liable to be struck down and it is in this context
that the final order was passed. In so far as the case that we are dealing
with is concerned, there is no challenge to the warrant of authorisation.

18.

Reference was also made to Collector of Central Excise,

WP (C) 5108/1993

Page 9 of 11

Vadodra v. M/s. Dhiren Chemical Industries, 2001 X AD (SC) 333.
We are not at all clear why this judgment has been cited. This case has
reference to payment of excise duty and the interpretation of an
exemption notification and has really no relevance to search and seizure
operation under Section 132 of the Act.

19.

Finally, learned counsel cited Sandvik Asia Ltd. v.

Commissioner of Income Tax-1, Pune & Ors., AIR 2006 SC 1223. In
paragraph 56 of the cited decision, it was held that the court has to take
all relevant factors into consideration while awarding interest. The main
issue in this case, which arose out of a statutory appeal filed under the
Act was whether an assessee would be entitled to compensation by the
Income Tax department for delay in paying to the assessee the amount
admittedly due to it. The assessee was admittedly entitled to a refund of
tax and that was delayed by the department and it was under these
circumstances that the assessee in that case sought payment of interest.
This decision is not at all apposite to the facts of the present case.

20.

As already noted above, the present case is one under

WP (C) 5108/1993

Page 10 of 11

Article 226 of the Constitution and not as a result of statutory and
adjudicatory proceedings under the Income Tax Act, 1961. Moreover,
as mentioned above, the Respondents have disputed their liability and
learned counsel has even gone to the extent of suggesting that the
proceedings under Section 132 of the Act were not even initiated against
the partnership firm but against Puran Mal (individual).

21.

The decision relied upon is clearly inapplicable to the facts

of the present case and, in any event, it does not advance the case of the
Petitioner.

22.

Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion that there

is no substance in this writ petition. It is accordingly dismissed.
