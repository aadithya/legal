1.

By this judgment, I propose to dispose of the present petition

under Section 11 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. The
petitioner has pointed out that the respondent invited tenders by
tender notice no. 211S/1764/TSO/2003 due on 31st October, 2003
for the manufacture and supply of S.G.C.I. Inserts to RDSO
Drawing no. T-381, Alt. VIII issued by the Northern Railways. The
Arb. P. No. 281/2006

page 1 of 9

tender

submitted

by

the

petitioner

was

accepted

by

a

communication dated 26th April, 2004 received by it on 30th April,
2004. The petitioner contends that this acceptance was beyond
validity period of the tender which was for the period of 180 days,
i.e. from the date of its opening.

The petitioner consequently

informed the Northern Railways that they were not obliged to act
on the said acceptance inasmuch as prices of raw material had
increased manifold during the intervening period.
2.

Despite this protest on behalf of the petitioner, the

respondent informed the petitioner by a letter dated 18th June,
2004 that a formal purchase order would follow. The petitioner
again protested by a communication of 1st July, 2004. Still, it is
asserted, that the respondent has high handedly issued an order
no. 50-04-1764-1-50273-36 dated 9th July, 2004 in two sets for
supply of 6,11,000 S.G.C.I. Inserts at the rate of Rs. 36.30 per
piece from the railway administration. These were returned to the
Northern

Railways

by

the

petitioner.

Despite

these

communications, the Northern Railways by a letter dated 4th
August, 2004 informed the petitioner that a valid and legally
Arb. P. No. 281/2006

page 2 of 9

enforceable contract had come into existence with the despatch of
the letter dated 26th April, 2004 and consequently, the petitioner
was bound to manufacture and supply the contracted goods as per
the purchase order of 9th July, 2004. The petitioner informed the
respondent about its inability to honour such purchase order by
communication dated 10th August, 2004.
3.

The present petition has been necessitated inasmuch as

thereafter the respondent purported to cancel the alleged contract
and with the petitioner by a letter dated 14th March, 2005 and
threatened the petitioner that it would be liable to pay the
damages suffered by the railway administration on account of its
refusal to supply the goods. By a subsequent communication of
28th/30th June, 2005, the Northern Railway laid a claim for a sum
of Rs. 38,06,530/- against the petitioner on account of the general
damages. This claim was also disputed by the petitioner by its
letter dated 6th July, 2005. 4.

Apart from this transaction, the

petitioner is stated to be performing two other contracts which are
effecting supplies to the railways pursuant to an order dated 13th
December, 2005 and another dated 17th January, 2006.
Arb. P. No. 281/2006

page 3 of 9

By a

communication dated 17th March, 2006, the petitioner was
informed that out of the amount of the final bill towards the order
dated 13th December, 2005, the railway administration has
deducted the amount of Rs. 27,01,147/- in terms of the letter dated
9th July, 2004.
5.

In these circumstances, the petitioner had by a legal notice

dated 24th April, 2006 called upon the railways to withdraw the
claim raised against the purchase order dated 9th July, 2004 and to
refund the amount of Rs. 27,01,147/- along with interest at the rate
of 18% p.a. thereon.
6.

In these facts and circumstances, the petitioner had also

sought a reference of the dispute between the parties to arbitration
in terms of clause no. 2900(a) of the Indian Railways Standards
Conditions of Contract which would govern dispute between the
parties. The petitioner raised several disputes and assailed the
action of the respondent. After waiting for action on the part of
the respondent, the petitioner filed the present petition on 29th
May, 2006.
7.

The respondents have appeared in answer to the notice and

Arb. P. No. 281/2006

page 4 of 9

have filed a reply. Parties have been heard on their respective
contentions. Perusal of the reply filed by the respondent shows
that there is no material challenged to the existence of the dispute
between the parties so far as the demand of the respondents is
concerned. It is also admitted in the reply that the notice dated
24th April, 2006 was received by the respondent on the 26th May,
2006. The respondents have submitted that by a reply dated 8 th
May, 2006, the petitioner had been informed that the steps were
being taken to appoint the arbitrator as desired by the petitioner.
However, the fact remains that no arbitrator has been appointed
even on the date when the petition was filed or after notice issued
by this court was served on the respondent. In the reply which had
been filed before this court by the respondent, it had been urged
that the respondents have effected appointment of an arbitrator on
the 7th of August, 2006.

The petitioner has assailed the

appointment of the arbitrator by the respondent on the ground
that inasmuch the respondent has failed to appoint the arbitrator
within thirty days of its notice, it had lost the right to appoint an
arbitrator to resolve the dispute.
Arb. P. No. 281/2006

page 5 of 9

In this behalf, reliance is placed on the pronouncement of
the Apex Court reported in (2006) 2 SCC 638 Punj Lloyd Ltd.
Vs. Petronet MHB Ltd. and the pronouncement of this court
reported at 137 (2007) DLT 47 Gurdeep Singh Vs. NDMC.
8.

It is an undisputed fact that the respondent has received the

legal notice invoking the arbitration agreement between the
parties from the petitioner on the 26th April, 2006 and the
respondents failed to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days
thereafter.

Even on 8th May, 2006, the only communication

addressed to the petitioner shows that they are in the process of
appointing an arbitrator. No arbitrator was admittedly appointed
till 29th May, 2006 when the present petition was filed. The law on
the issue as to whether the party on whom the responsibility to
appoint an arbitrator has been cast under the contract would still
have a right after expiry of a period of 30 days from the service of
the notice is no longer res judicata.
9.

In (2006) 2 SCC 638 Punj Lloyd Ltd. Vs. Petronet

MHB Ltd., the Apex Court had placed reliance on its earlier
pronouncement reported at (2000) 8 SCC 151 Datar
Arb. P. No. 281/2006

page 6 of 9

Switchgears Ltd. Vs. Tata Finance Ltd. and held that upon
failure to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days of the demand, the
right to appointment would not get automatically forfeited even
after 30 days, if the opposite party makes an appointment after 30
days of demand, but before the first party had moved the court
under Section 11. This would sufficiently meet the legal
requirements of an appointment under Section 11 (6). However, if
no appointment is made even till such time as the first party
moves the court under Section 11, the opposite party would forfeit
its right to make the appointment.
10.

On these principles, this court in its pronouncement

reported at 137 (2007) DLT 47 Gurdeep Singh Vs. NDMC
held that the respondent would lose its right to appoint an
arbitrator if it had not so appointed till this period. In this view of
the matter, the present petition has to be allowed.
11.

The appointment of the arbitrator by the order dated 7th

August, 2006 cannot bind the parties as the respondent has lost its
right to appoint an arbitrator after the petitioner had filed the
petition on 29th May, 2006 i.e. after the expiry of the period of 30
Arb. P. No. 281/2006

page 7 of 9

days when the notice was served on the respondents.
12.

Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
I hereby appoint Mr. K.C. Lohia, Additional District Judge

(Retd.) (Address: D-2/1, Court Lane, Rajniwas Marg, Delhi110054, Tel. No. 23944779 & 23922615) as a sole arbitrator in the
matter to resolve the dispute between the parties. The parties
shall raise their respective claims and counter claims before the
arbitrator who shall conduct the arbitration as per law. He shall be
paid a fees of Rs. 1 lakh. Such fees of the arbitrator shall be paid in
four equated installments: one at the time of entering upon the
reference; second on completion of the pleadings; third on
completion of evidence; and fourth at the time of conclusion of
arguments in the matter.
The arbitrator shall also be entitled to other incidental
expenses which may be incurred on clerical and stenographic
expenses by him. The fees and the incidental expenses of the
learned arbitrator shall be equally borne by the parties.
This petition is allowed in the above terms.
