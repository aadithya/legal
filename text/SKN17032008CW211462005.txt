1.

Mr. Anand Yadav, Advocate seeks permission to file an affidavit in

the Court.

Permission is granted.

Affidavit is taken on record.

This

affidavit has been filed pursuant to order dated 24th July, 2007 whereby the
petitioner was asked to submit following information:“i.
(Response to) stand taken in the counter
affidavit.
ii.
PAN number of the petitioner.
iii.
Source of funds from which the petitioner
made the deposits with DDA.
iv.
Account maintained by the petitioner, if any,
with South Indian Bank Limited.
v.
Whether the petitioner is an income tax payee
and if yes, returns for last three years.

vi.
Whether in the income tax returns, if file,
petitioner intimated capital expenses incurred for
acquired immovable property.”

2.

These informations were required to be submitted in view of what is

stated in paragraph 2 of order dated 24th July, 2007, which reads as under:“
Accordingly, it is directed that the petitioner
here will in addition to filing a detailed affidavit on
the above aspects also indicate why he himself
needs the flat although admittedly he is today in
Kolkata. Needless to mention that the affidavit will
be signed by the petitioner himself. The affidavit be
filed within ten days.”
3.

The petitioner was allotted plot No. 49, Pocket No. C-III, Sector 28,

Rohini, Phase IV, Delhi by allotment letter dated 1st September, 2003. It is
stated in the writ petition that the petitioner deposited part payment of
Rs.1,17,300/- vide challan dated 4th November, 2003, but he could not
make payment of the balance amount in terms of the allotment letter.
Thereafter, another payment of Rs.2,50,000/- was made on 7th April, 2005.
The aforesaid payment was beyond the time given in the allotment letter.
The respondent-DDA had cancelled the allotment on failure of the
petitioner to make payment within time. The petitioner has filed the present
writ petition for quashing and setting aside the cancellation order and for
direction to respondent-DDA to make allotment of the plot in question or
any other similar plot.

4.

It may be noted here that the writ petition has not been signed and

supported by an affidavit of the petitioner. It is supported by an affidavit of
one Mr. Sanjay Bhasin, an attorney of the petitioner. DDA in the counter
affidavit has pointed out that the petitioner is a resident of Berhampore,
District Murshidabad, West Bengal. It is stated in the counter affidavit that
payments in question were actually made by third parties and not by the
petitioner.
5.

Additional affidavit filed by the petitioner discloses that the payments

made to DDA were not from the bank accounts of the petitioner. On the
other hand, it is stated by the petitioner that he had requested his friends
viz. Mr. Lalit Kumar and his brothers, whose address has not been
disclosed, to deposit the amount demanded by DDA and the bank drafts
were prepared by them. It is further stated that bank drafts of Rs.50,000/or above are not issued by deposit made in cash and, therefore, three
separate demand drafts of Rs.39,100/- were prepared by depositing money
in cash in three separate banks. It may be relevant to state here that DDA
in their counter affidavit has given complete break up of the demand drafts
received and the persons on whose request the demand drafts were issued
as per the issuing bank. The relevant details are given as under:“ It is further submitted that on verification in respect of deposit of
installments in the present case, it has been noticed that the 1st

installment of Rs.1,17,283/ deposited through challan bearing no.
10933903 on 04.11.2003 in the Central Bank of India were by

6.

These details have been admitted by the petitioner in his additional

affidavit. It is also stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that
aforesaid deposits have not been shown as loan received by the petitioner
from the said third parties in his income-tax returns. The petitioner is an
income-tax payee.
7.

The case in question is covered by the decision of this Court in W.P.

(C) No. 18603/2005 titled Nirmal Chugh versus Delhi Development
Authority.
8.

In view of the above, it is apparent that the petitioner has already

entered into a transaction for sale/transfer with a third party for the plot in
question and, therefore, he is not entitled to any relief.
9.

Mr. Anand Yadav, Advocate, however, still submits that the petitioner

has not sold the plot in question. However, learned counsel contradicts
himself in his next statement that the petitioner has every right to sell the
plot. It is lastly submitted that several other allottees have also entered into

similar transactions. In the present case, the petitioner even before getting
possession of his flat has apparently entered into a transaction for sale of
the plot with a third party.

It will not be appropriate for this Court to

exercise and grant discretionary relief to the petitioner. If relief is granted in
such cases, it will encourage third party transfers and property dealers to
enter into speculative agreements. In view of supply constraints, it will
prevent DDA from allotting plots/flats to genuine buyers, who require roof
over their head for their personal use and residence. Article 14 prevents
discrimination but the petitioner cannot claim discrimination on the basis of
illegalities. It may be also noted here that there was delay of about 459
days in making payment of Rs.2,50,000/-, which was payable as per
demand-cum-allotment letter on or before 3rd January, 2004. As per policy
of DDA, delay beyond 360 days cannot be condoned. Delay in the present
case is more than 360 days.

In the present case, I do not think the

petitioner has been able to make out an exceptional case, which will justify
this Court in condoning the delay in payment of 459 days.
The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
