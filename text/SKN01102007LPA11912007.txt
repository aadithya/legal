5620/1998 dismissing their writ petition questioning the order dated
th

10 August, 1998 passed by the Tehsildar and the order dated 10

th

September, 1998 passed by the Financial Commissioner. By the said
order application of the appellants for cancellation of mutation on
th

inheritance in respect of 1/9 share in Khata No. 371 in village Tikri
Kalan, Tehsil Najafgarh in the names of Mr. Sarvashri Raj Singh, Mr.
Vinay Kumar, Mr. Satyawan and Mr. Satpal Singh, all sons of late
Ms. Bharto was rejected. The said mutation in the name of sons of
th

late Ms. Bharto was made by the Tehsildar on 11 August, 1995.
2.

The appellants herein are legal heirs of Mr. Subh Ram and

grandsons of late Mr. Harphool Singh, who expired in 1964. He was
a joint bhumidar in land in Khata No. 371 in village Tikri Kalan, Tehsil
Najafgarh. After Mr. Harphool Singh's death in 1964 the aforesaid
land was mutated in 1966 in the names of his sons, Mr. Subh Ram,
Mr. Jai Karan and daughter-Ms. Bharto, who were described as 1/3

rd

rd

owners of the land with 2/3 share belonging to other joint bhumidars
remaining unchanged. In other words, Mr. Subh Ram, Mr. Jai Karan

LPA No. 1191/2007

th

and Ms. Bharto became 1/9 owners/joint bhumidars of the aforesaid
land after death of Mr. Harphool Singh. The mutation in favour of
Ms.Bharto in 1966 remained unchallenged during her life time and on
her death on 14

th

August, 1986 her rights were transferred and

inherited by her four sons-Mr. Sarvashri Raj Singh, Mr. Vinay Kumar,
Mr. Satyawan and Mr. Satpal Singh. They applied for mutation and
the said application was allowed by the Tehsildar by order dated 11

th

August, 1995.
3.

Mutation in favour of sons of Ms. Bharto was challenged by the

appellants herein in the year 1998, but rejected by the impugned
th

orders dated 10 August, 1998 and 10

th

September, 1998 by the

Tehsildar and the Financial Commissioner, respectively. Learned
counsel for the appellant challenged the impugned orders on the
ground that they are contrary to Section 50 of the Delhi Land
Reforms Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as DLRA, for short) under
which inheritance of agricultural land is by male members and that a
married daughter is excluded. It was also submitted that mutation by

LPA No. 1191/2007

Page 4

itself does not decide question of title or create title and that it is only
an evidence of title. Learned Counsel for the appellant referred to the
following decisions in support of the aforesaid submissions, Ram
Mehar versus Smt. Dakhan reported in 1973 RLR 279(para 21),
Om Prakash & Anr. versus Mansa & Others. reported in 1959 PLJ

The principles of law are well settled and established. The question is
applicability of the said principles in and to the facts of the present
case.
4.

It may be relevant to state here that in 1995 after the death

of Ms. Bharto, steps were taken for mutation in favour of Mr.
Sarvashri Raj Singh, Mr. Vinay Kumar, Mr. Satyawan and Mr. Satpal
Singh who are all sons of Ms. Bharto. Mr. Devender Singh son of
Mr.Subh Ram was present before the Tehsildar and he himself
identified the four sons. He did not raise any debate nor objected to
mutation being granted in favour of the four sons of Ms. Bharto. This
aspect was highlighted by the Tehsildar in his order dated 10

th

August, 1998 and the relevant portion of the earlier order of mutation
th

dated 11 August, 1995 has been reproduced by the learned Single
th

Judge in paragraph 12 of his judgment. By order dated 11 August,
1995 mutation in favour of four sons of Ms. Bharto was made. In
paragraph 13 of the judgment, the precise statement made by

LPA No. 1191/2007

Page 6

Mr.Devender Singh before the Tehsildar in identifying Mr. Satpal
Singh son of Ms. Bharto has been reproduced. Subsequently, after
the death of Mr. Subh Ram, Mr. Devender Singh was impleaded as
one of his legal heirs on an application under Order XXII, Rule 3 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. We, therefore, agree with the
findings of the learned Single Judge that Mr. Subh Ram was fully
th

aware of the mutation order of the Tehsildar dated 11 August, 1995
and the contention of the appellants that they were not aware of the
said order and the said order was passed behind their back, is not
correct. It is apparent from the facts stated above that mutation in
favour of Ms. Bharto in 1966 and thereafter in favour of her sons on
th

11 August, 1995 was done with the knowledge and in fact with the
consent of Mr. Subh Ram. Presence of Mr. Devender Singh s/o Mr.
Subh Ram and his statement is a clear indicator.

Mr. Devender

Singh has not filed any affidavit denying his presence or disputing
that mutation was carried out on 11

th

August, 1995 with his

knowledge, but others viz. Mr. Subh Ram and his brothers were not

LPA No. 1191/2007

Page 7

aware.
5.

Moreover, the facts stated above reveal that Ms. Bharto was

recorded as owner of the joint bhumidari land in 1966 after the death
of her father Mr. Harphool Singh along with Mr. Subh Ram and Mr.
Jai Karan. No objection or challenge to the same was ever made at
any time, from 1966 onwards till she expired in 1986. Thereafter
mutation was carried out in the name of the sons of Ms. Bharto with
the knowledge of the appellants.
5A.

Challenge for the first time was made only by filing of an

application before the Tehsildar in May, 1998. In the said application,
th

challenge was made to the order dated 11 August, 1995 by which
mutation was done in the name of four sons of Ms. Bharto and no
challenge was made to the mutation in the name of Ms. Bharto in
1966. Mutation made in the names of sons of Ms. Bharto, was merely
a logical consequence and the same was necessary only to give
effect to the mutation made in the name of Ms. Bharto in 1966. The
appellants could not have asked for cancellation and setting aside of

LPA No. 1191/2007

Page 8

mutation made in name of Ms. Bharto in 1966 by questioning
mutation made in favour of her sons in the year 1995. It is apparent
from the conduct of the parties that after the death of Mr. Harphool
Singh, Ms. Bharto was recorded as one of his inheritors having equal
right as her two brothers viz. Mr. Subh Ram and Mr. Jai Karan. She
continued to enjoy full rights during her life time. After her death on
th

14 August, 1986, her sons as inheritors continued to enjoy the said
rights with the consent and knowledge of the appellants as is
apparent from the statement made by Mr. Devender Singh before
th

mutation order dated 11 August, 1995 was passed by the Tehsildar.
It is, therefore, clear that there was implied understanding between
the aforesaid parties and the parties agreed and accepted Ms. Bharto
and her legal heirs as joint bhumidars, who had inherited the property
from Mr. Harphool Singh, after his death in 1964 resulting in mutation
entry in 1966, which continued. What the appellants seek and had
sought before the Tehsildar and the Financial Commissioner is to
unsettle the accepted position, which had continued from 1964/1966

LPA No. 1191/2007

onwards till 1998.

Page 9

In view of the said position, Tehsildar and

Financial Commissioner rejected the application of Mr. Subh Ram. It
is also apparent that the said change in stand has taken place
because part of the said bhumidari land, as stated in the impugned
judgment, was acquired in 1997 by Award No. 17/97-98 under the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Admittedly the appellants have already
received their share of compensation for the said acquisition. The
idea appears to be to grab the other part of the compensation which
is going to the legal heirs of Ms. Bharto.
6.

In view of the above, no ground for interference with the

impugned judgment has been made out. The present appeal has no
merit and is dismissed.
