BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.
These four petitions raise common issues and, therefore, they are being
disposed of together. The writ petition No.2828/2006 titled Pradeep Kumar Jain v
Union of India & Ors raises an additional issue wherein the termination of the licence
agreement on the part of the respondents has also been challenged.
2.

All the petitioners, by separate allotment letters, were alloted space for

installation of STD/ISD/PCO booths at different Railway Stations in Delhi.
3.

The allotments of space were made by Northern Railways in all the cases.

Consequent upon the allotment letters which were individually issued to the petitioners
licence agreements were entered into with them. The essential features of the licence
agreements were that they were to be for one year each and that, in case, of breach of
any of the conditions, the Northern Railways had the right to terminate the same during
the tenure of the licence. Even otherwise, if the Northern Railways required the space
for their own purpose, they could terminate and cancel the licence.
4.

These licences were renewed from time to time.

The petitioners are

aggrieved by the letter dated 09.03.2005 which was issued to all the petitioners. The
letter was to the following effect :“Sub :-

Notice for existing PCO/STD/ISD/FAX booth-holder
at Delhi Jn: Railway Station West hall near entrance
allotted without any tender.

wp(c) 2828.06, 7210.05, 7211.05, 7220.05

page no 2 of 7

The validity of your above mentioned existing
PCO/STD/ISD/FAX booth is upto 27.4.2005. Please note that the
validity of your agreement for the above booth will not be
extended beyond 27.4.2005 and this booth will be allotted through
tender w.e.f. 28.4.2005 onward. If you desire, you may also
participate in the tender when called for through press notification.
This is for your information.
For Sr. Divi. Comml, Manager,
New Delhi.
The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that although the said letter required
that the agreement would not be extended beyond 27.4.2005, the Government of India,
Ministry of Railway had decided that physically handicapped persons who were
presently running PCO/STD/ISD booths at railway stations and whose contracts were
expiring and were not due for extension as per the contracts would be allowed to
continue their contracts even after expiry upto 27.4.2007 provided their working was
satisfactory. In support of this contention, the learned counsel for the petitioners drew
my attention to the letter dated 11.3.2005 which was issued by the Railway Board to
the General Manager (Commercial) and All Zonal Railways and was to the following
effect :
“It has been decided that physically handicapped persons who are
presently running STD / ISD / PCO booths at Railway stations and
whose contracts are expiring now or later and which are not due for
extension as per contract may be allowed to continue and their contract
may be extended after expiry upto 27.4.2007 provided their working is
satisfactory.”
The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the same benefit that was given
to the physically handicapped persons ought to be given to the petitioners also

wp(c) 2828.06, 7210.05, 7211.05, 7220.05

page no 3 of 7

inasmuch as the allotments made to the petitioners were also on compassionate
grounds.
5.

The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted that

the Railway Board had taken out two policy circulars. One was dated 22.4.2002 and
the other was dated 20.5.2002. The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that
the policy of 22.4.2002 did not apply to the petitioners who were existing STD / ISD /
PCO booth holders. He submitted that it is the policy of 20.5.2002 which applied to
the existing STD / PCO / ISD booth holder including the petitioners. With reference to
the said policy, he submitted that such booth holders were allowed to operate the
booths in terms thereof upto 27.4.2005 subject to the conditions laid down in the said
circular. It is in this context that the said letter dated 09.03.2005 was issued to all the
existing booth holders including the petitioners indicating that their licences would not
be extended beyond 27.4.2005 and that if they so desire they could participate in the
tenders that were to take place thereafter.
6.

The learned counsel for the respondents also submitted that the grievance

of the petitioners that they should be treated as par with physically handicapped
persons no longer survives as the matter was considered by the Ministry of Railways,
Government of India and by a circular dated 07.06.2005 a decision was taken to extend
the benefit to existing booth holders who were not physically handicapped.
relevant portion of the circular is as under:
“It has been decided that the contracts of STD / ISD/ PCO booth
holder other than physically handicapped person whose total
period of contract as on 27.4.2005 is less 10 years may be
wp(c) 2828.06, 7210.05, 7211.05, 7220.05

page no 4 of 7

The

7.

extended till such period when their total period of contract comes
to 10 years or till 27.4.2007, whichever is earlier.”
Considering the arguments advanced by the counsel for the parties, it is

clear that the policy of 22.4.2002 does not at all apply to the petitioners. Under the
policy of 20.5.2002, the petitioners are not entitled to any further extension beyond
27.4.2005. Initially, the benefit had only been extended to physically handicapped
persons but in view of the circular dated 7.6.2005 that benefit has also been extended to
others including the petitioners. Therefore, the petitioners can have no grievance on
this ground any more. Their contract periods would, in any event, as in the case of
physically handicapped persons, be upto 27.4.2007. In any event, that is the outer
limit and the individual contracts of the petitioners may terminate earlier to that
depending on when ten years period expired. Therefore, I am of the view that nothing
further survives in this petition insofar as the common issues are concerned.
8.

Coming to the additional issue in the case of Pradeep Kumar Jain, the said

petitioner was additionally aggrieved by the fact that the allotment was terminated
without following the policy. The facts of the case are that an allotment letter was
issued to the petitioner on 11.3.1996. Consequently an agreement was entered into.
That agreement had been extended from time to time. On 28.2.2005 a show cause
notice was issued to Mr Pradeep Kumar Jain to show cause as to why the licence be not
cancelled in view of the fact that during a vigilance check it was found that the
petitioner was charging 25% to 30% extra from the customers. On 11.3.2005, the said
Pradeep Kumar Jain sent his reply stating that the STD billing machine had gone out of
order and he had sent it for repair. He also submitted that he did not know that the
wp(c) 2828.06, 7210.05, 7211.05, 7220.05

page no 5 of 7

meter was fast and that he only came to know of the excessive billing when the
vigilance check was carried out. This explanation was not found satisfactory and by a
letter dated 21.3.2005 the said Pradeep Kumar Jain's licence was terminated. The
petitioner's contention is that the termination letter was contrary to the policy.

The

learned counsel for the petitioners referred to the policy of the respondents dated
22.4.2002 and, in particular, to clause 10 thereof. The same reads as under:
“10) The Administrator (i.e. Divisional Railway Manager or General
Manager) will have the right to impose fine/terminate the license
if the licensee is not conforming to the conditions laid down by
the Railways and if there are complaints against him/her for
overcharging, etc. The contract will be terminated after issuing
due notice. The termination of the license may be done on the
basis of the defaults committed by the licensee and at least 3
chances may be afforded by imposing fine. The compounding
of defaults may be empowered to Divisional Railway Manager
with the powers of imposing fine not less than Rs.500 after the
observance of the principles of Natural Justice.”
She submitted that, as per the policy, it is clear that the licence could be terminated for,
inter alia, the complaint with regard to overcharging provided at least three chances
were given to the licence holders by imposing fine. She submitted that contrary to this
policy, at the very first instance, the petitioner's licence has been terminated without
giving any further chances by imposing fine.
9.

The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that this policy of

22.4.2002 is not applicable to the petitioners inasmuch as it would apply to new
allotments. However, insofar as the penalty measures are concerned, I am of the view
that the Government and public authorities should apply the provisions with equal

wp(c) 2828.06, 7210.05, 7211.05, 7220.05

page no 6 of 7

measure to both existing and new allotments.

Accordingly, even though strictly

speaking the policy of 22.4.2002 is not applicable to the petitioner but, principles
analogous to these contained in clause 10 ought to have been applied to the petitioner's
case also. Therefore, if a reasoned view is taken, the only conclusion would be that the
first instance of overcharging ought to have been dealt with by imposition of fine and
not by terminating the licence straightaway. Accordingly I hold that the termination
letter dated 21.3.2005 deserves to be set aside. It is accordingly set aside.
10.

However, in view of the fact that the licence agreement with the petitioner

cannot, in any event, continue beyond the ten years period from the initial allotment
and not, in any event, beyond 27.4.2007, no order of restoration of the said PCO can be
passed in this writ petition. It will, however, be open to the petitioner (Pradeep Kumar
Jain) to claim compensation for the wrongful termination by way of separate
proceedings before an appropriate forum.
These writ petitions stand disposed of.
