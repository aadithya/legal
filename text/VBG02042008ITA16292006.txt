V.B.Gupta, J.
By

way

of

this

common judgment, all the above

three appeals are being disposed of since the common
question of law is involved in all these case.
2.

The short question in these appeals raised by the

Revenue is as to whether the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal (for short as „Tribunal‟) was correct in quashing

ITA No.1629/2006

Page 1 of 10

the assessment framed under Sections 143(3) and 147 of
the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short as „Act‟) ignoring the
provisions of Section 149(1)(a) of the Act.
3.

Brief facts leading to dispute are that the original

assessments for the assessment years 1991-92, 1992-93
and 1993-94 were completed on 28th October, 1993, 26th
November, 1993 and 18th January, 2004 respectively under
Section 143(3) of the Act at an income of Rs. 3,27,170/-, Rs.
7,84,160/- and Rs.6,21,830/- respectively. Subsequently,
the Assessing Officer came to know that ratable value in
respect of properties bearing No.B-6 and B-7, Asaf Ali
Road, New Delhi owned by the Assessee have been
determined at Rs. 10,28,900/- by the Municipal Corporation
of Delhi against Rs. 3,61,000/- declared by the Assessee on
the basis of actual rent received.
Officer

reopened

the

assessment

Thus, the Assessing
for

these

three

assessment years by issuing notice under Section 148 of
the Act on 31st March, 2000.
4.

In response to subsequent notices, the Assessee

replied that since the property is let, hence his case is
covered under Section 23(1)(b) of the Act and, therefore,

ITA No.1629/2006

Page 2 of 10

the annual value should be determined on the basis of the
actual rent received.
5.

The Assessing Officer was not satisfied as according

to him the annual value of the property should be higher of
the ratable value (as determined by the MCD) or the actual
rent received.

For this proposition, he relied on the

judgment of Calcutta High Court in the case of CIT v.

Satya Co.Ltd. (1994) 75 Taxman 193 (Cal) and
completed the assessment by adopting annual value at
Rs.10,28, 900/- as per the ratable value determined by the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi.
6.

Being

aggrieved

by

the

assessment

order,

the

Assessee filed appeals before the Commissioner of Income
Tax (Appeals) [for short as CIT(A)] which were decided in
favour of the Assessee vide order dated 25th March, 2003.
7.

Against thereby, Revenue had filed appeals (ITA Nos.

3750, 3751 & 3752/Del/2003 relevant for the assessment
years 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94 respectively) before
the Tribunal and vide the impugned order dated 29 th July,
2005, the appeals were rejected by the Tribunal.

The

Tribunal had quashed the re-assessment proceedings by

ITA No.1629/2006

Page 3 of 10

holding that the same is barred by limitation. It was held
that the case is covered by the proviso to Section 147 of
the Act and it is not the case where there has been failure
on the part of the Assessee to disclose truly all facts on
records but the Assessing Officer had reopened the
assessment after he came to know that the Assessee had
not disclosed the correct valuation of the property.

The

assessment was reopened on the basis of the subsequent
information received from Municipal Corporation of Delhi,
as such the proviso to Section 147 is not applicable.
8.

Now the Revenue has filed present appeals is before

this Court.
9.

Thus the question arises in the present appeals is

whether the reassessment by the Assessing Officer based
on the subsequent information is valid or not.
10.

It is contended by learned counsel for the Revenue

that in the present case, the Assessee had himself not
disclosed the correct facts including the valuation of the
property in question before the Assessing Officer, hence
the proviso to Section 147(1) of the Act is not applicable in

ITA No.1629/2006

Page 4 of 10

this case, and after amendment w.e.f. 1st April, 1989, the
scope of Section 147 of the Act has been widen.
11.

In this context, it is relevant to refer to the provisions

of Sections 147 and 149 of the Act. Section 147 of the Act
provides for assessment in cases where income has
escaped assessment. It also provides that if the Assessing
Officer has reason to believe that income chargeable to tax
has escaped assessment for the relevant year, then he is
empowered, subject to the provisions of Section 148 to 153
of the Act, to assess or reassess such income and also any
other income chargeable to tax which

has escaped

assessment and which comes to his notice subsequently in
the course of the proceedings under Section 147 of the Act,
or to recompute the loss or the depreciation allowance or
any other allowance, as the case may be, for the relevant
assessment year.
12.

However, where an assessment under Section 143(3)

of the Act or this Section has been made for the relevant
assessment year and the initiation is taking place after the
expiry of four years from the end of the relevant
assessment year, the proviso to Section 147 of the Act

ITA No.1629/2006

Page 5 of 10

would be attracted and no action can be taken under
Section 147 of the Act unless such income has escaped
assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part
of the Assessee to make a return under Section 139 of the
Act or failure to file a return in response to a notice under
Section 142(1) or Section 148 of the Act, or to disclose fully
and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for
that year.
13.

Further, Central Board of Direct Taxes Circular

No.549 dated 31st October, 1989 published in (1990) 182
ITR 29 (Statues) on “Income Escaping Assessment”, subpara (iv) 7.1 of which reads as under:“ A proviso to the new Section provides that an
assessment, which has been completed under
Section 143(3) or Section 147, i.e., a scrutiny
assessment, can be re-opened after the expiry
of four years from the end of the relevant
assessment year only if income has escaped
assessment due to the failure on the part of the
Assessee to file a return of income or to
disclose fully and truly all material facts
necessary for his assessment.”
14.

The language employed in proviso to Section 147 of

the Act shows that the disclosure thereby contemplated is
to be with regard to material facts and, therefore, must

ITA No.1629/2006

Page 6 of 10

necessarily be in respect of such facts which exists at all
material times between the filing of the return and the
order of assessment.

A material fact which is not in

existence right up to the time of assessment cannot
possibly be disclosed. Therefore, a fact which comes into
existence subsequent to the making of the assessment
cannot be a material fact within the purview of Section 147
of the Act.

Further, the duty to disclose material facts

necessarily postulates existence of a thing or material. If a
material is not in existence or if a material is such of which
the Assessee had no knowledge there would be no duty to
disclose such material.
15.

From the narration of facts given above, it is clear

that the returns for all the three assessment years had
been filed by the Assessee and there was no failure to file
returns and further during the course of assessment for
assessment years, all material facts had been disclosed
fully and truly and assessment was completed under
Section 143(3) of the Act after scrutiny. As the Assessee
can be fastened with the duty to disclose such facts or
materials as are in existence at the relevant time and which

ITA No.1629/2006

Page 7 of 10

are known to him, the initiation under Section 147 of the
Act based on the order of Municipal Corporation of Delhi
regarding ratable value was dated 31st March, 1994, which
was not available at the time of original assessment, cannot
be sustained.

Therefore, the action of reassessment was

taken on the basis of subsequent material which was not in
existence at the time of original assessment, was not
justified.
16.

Further, it is only when the case falls under the

proviso to Section 147 of the Act that the question of nondisclosure of materials facts would become relevant.

In

such cases, if the Asssessee has made full disclosure of
material facts, then even if such income has escaped
assessment, no action can be initiated by the Assessing
Officer under Section 147 of the Act. However, where the
said period of four years has not expired, the conduct of
the Assessee regarding disclosure of material facts need
not be the basis for initiating the proceedings and they can
be commenced if the Assessing Officer has reason to
believe

that

the

income

has

escaped

assessment

notwithstanding that there was full disclosure of material

ITA No.1629/2006

Page 8 of 10

facts on record. (See Explanation 1 of Section 147 of the
Act).
17.

Furthermore,

Section

149(1)(a)

of the

Act also

provides that no notice under Section 148 of the Act shall
be issued for the relevant assessment year if four years
have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year
and in case, if four years, but not more than seven years,
have elapsed from the end of the relevant assessment year
unless the income chargeable to tax which has escaped
assessment amounts to or is likely to amount to Rs.50,000/or more for that year and if seven years, but not more than
ten years, have elapsed from the end of the relevant
assessment year unless the income chargeable to tax which
has escaped assessment amounts to or is likely to amount
to Rs. 1 lac or more for that year.
18.

In the present case, the Assessing Officer served the

notice under Section 148 of the Act later than 4 years.
There was no deliberate concealment of the facts by the
Assessee.
the

The assessment was reopened on the basis of

subsequent

information

received

from

Municipal

Corporation of Delhi, as such the proviso to Section 147 of

ITA No.1629/2006

Page 9 of 10

the Act is not applicable and the provisions of Section 149
of the act will be applicable. Thus, in the light of the fact
that the initiation by issuance of impugned notices was
beyond the period of four years and the prerequisite
conditions stipulated by Section 147 of the Act were not
fulfilled, there was no case made out for upholding the
proposed reassessment.

Thus, the action of issuance of

notice by the Assessing Officer is without jurisdiction and
the assessment already completed under Section 143(3) of
the Act cannot be reopened after a period of more than
four years from the end of relevant assessment years.
19.

Thus, we do not find any infirmity with the order

passed by the Tribunal and no substantial question of law
arises in this case.
20.

Accordingly the appeals filed by the Revenue are,

hereby, dismissed.
