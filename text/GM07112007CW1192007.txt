Rule.

2.

Counsel for the respondent waives notice of rule.

It is

submitted that the matter can be disposed of on the basis of
the available record.
The parties have consequently been heard.
3.

The petitioner applied for MIG flat being registration

no.23135 under the New Pattern Registration Scheme, 1979.
In a draw of lot for MIG flats held on 15th October, 1990, the
petitioner was successful in drawing a flat and a demand-cumallotment letter was issued for the period between 6th January,
WP (C) No.119/2007

Page No.1

1991 and 10th January, 1991. On account of financial difficulty,
the petitioner requested the DDA

by the letter dated 10th

August, 1991 to grant him extension of time by one month.
4.

No extension of time was granted.

Instead, a notice to

show cause dated 19/15th October, 1991 was issued to the
petitioner requiring him to comply with the payment demand
failing which the allotment of flat shall be cancelled. Pursuant
to the receipt of such communication, the petitioner made
within the period notified and deposited an amount of
Rs.84,133/-.
5.

The grievance of the petitioner is that despite the payment

in terms of the notice dated 19/15th October, 1991, the
allotment of flat to the petitioner was cancelled under the
automatic cancellation system. The petitioner has protested to
the DDA by the communication dated 5/6th March, 1992, even
expressing willingness to deposit cancellation charges without
attributing any fault for the cancellation.

The petitioner was

constrained to request the DDA for restoration of the flat and
even made an alternative request that another flat be allotted
to him.

Similar requests were made to the Commissioner

(Housing) by the communication dated 22nd June, 1992 and the
Vice-Chairman on 19th June, 1992.
6.

The DDA informed the petitioner on 2nd December, 1992

WP (C) No.119/2007

Page No.2

that in case he deposited the cancellation charges, his
registration would be kept intact and his seniority at the tail end
would be maintained. Inasmuch as the petitioner had deposited
an amount of Rs.84,133/- which was lying deposited with the
DDA as back as on 28th October, 1991, the petitioner requested
the DDA to adjust the cancellation charges of Rs.7,010/- from
this amount.
7.

It is noteworthy that after so adjusting the cancellation

charges, only an amount of Rs.77,123/- was refunded to the
petitioner to the DDA. The respondent had thereby indicated to
the petitioner that he would be considered at the tail end
priority towards allotment of a flat afresh.
It appears that though a draw of lot for the tail end priority
was conducted by the DDA in 2004, the petitioner was,
however, admittedly not considered in such draw for allotment.
Thus aggrieved by the failure to consider his name in the draw
of lots at the tail end priority, the petitioner has filed the
present petition seeking a mandamus to the respondent to
consider him for allotment of an MIG flat and to issue a fresh
demand-cum-allotment letter.
8.

The respondent has disputed the entitlement of the

petitioner on the specious plea that the DDA had issued/served
public notices between the period from 2005 to 2006 lastly on

WP (C) No.119/2007

Page No.3

5th February, 2006 whereby cases of all the registrants including
those at the tail end priority who had not taken any refund or
been alloted any flat, were notified to approach the Deputy
Director (MIG) Housing with the details and copies of their
documents.
According to the DDA, inasmuch as the petitioner did not
approach the DDA, he has lost his right and entitlement for
consideration for allotment of a flat under the concerned
scheme with the DDA.
9.

Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having

perused the record, I find that it is evident that in compliance of
the notice to show cause issued by the DDA as back as on
19/15th October, 1991, the petitioner deposited the amount
within

the

fifteen

days

period

granted

to

him

in

this

communication. The DDA had with it an amount of Rs.84,133/with effect from 28th October, 1991 when the petitioner
deposited the same in compliance of the demand notice. There
was thus no reason or occasion to cancel the allotment of the
flat of the petitioner in the year 1992.

Undoubtedly, though

the petitioner protested to the DDA but he accepted the action
of the DDA in cancelling the flat. It is required to be considered
that the petitioner had registered with the DDA since 1979 and
was waiting for allotment of the flat ever since. Whatever be

WP (C) No.119/2007

Page No.4

the reason, the petitioner agreed to even pay the cancellation
charges of the flat.

The petitioner had admittedly paid the

amount within the time given to him by the DDA on 19/15th
October, 1991 which fact was completely overlooked at the
time of issuance of the cancellation of the flat on 5/6th March,
1992. The matter does not end here. The respondent accepted
the offer of the petitioner and adjusted the amount of Rs.7,010/towards cancellation charges out of the amount of Rs.84,133/deposited by the petitioner when they refunded the amount of
Rs.77,123/- to the petitioner, clearly indicating thereby the
petitioner that he would be treated in the draw of lot for those
placed at the tail end priority.
10. Before this court, the sole reliance of the DDA is on the
public notices which have been issued. It is apparent from the
public notices that the DDA was conscious of the fact that
several persons who were legitimately entitled to consideration
for allotment of the flats on tail end priority or other priorities,
had been overlooked.

Certainly, the petitioner cannot be

faulted for the failure of the DDA to consider the petitioner for
allotment of the flat on a mere premise that they have issued
public notices.
11. So far as the impact of such public notices effecting the
private rights of the persons is concerned, it is required to be

WP (C) No.119/2007

Page No.5

borne in mind that the applicants have been made to wait for
decades for allotment of the flats.

In the instant case, the

petitioner has been waiting since the year 1979. Certainly, the
citizens cannot be expected to be following newspapers of
every single day for over 25 years keeping track of public
notices which may be issued

by

the DDA.

Such a plea on

behalf of the DDA is both unfair and unreasonable.

The

respondent cannot be permitted to so avoid the responsibility
and liability to consider the petitioner for allotment of a flat in
an appropriate draw of lots especially in the facts which have
been noticed hreinabove.
12. My attention has been drawn to an order dated 20th March,
2007 passed in WP (C) No.11654/2006 entitled Subhash
Chander Sethi Vs. Delhi Development Authority, wherein in
similar circumstances, the court had rejected a plea taken by
the DDA placing reliance on its public notices.
13. Another order dated 19th July, 2007 passed in WP (C)
No.10570/2006 entitled Tajinder Kaur Vs. DDA has been placed
before this court wherein the court has rejected the DDA's
contention and reliance on the public notices which were issued
by it to deprive the bona fide registrants who have been waiting
for several decades, for allotment of the flats.
14. Mr.

Kinra,

WP (C) No.119/2007

learned

counsel

for

the

petitioner,

Page No.6

also

places reliance on an order dated 21st July, 2006 in Writ Petition
(C) No.20250/2005 Jay Prakash Vs. DDA passed by this court.
15. From the above, it is apparent that the petitioner was not a
defaulter and yet his flat was cancelled. The petitioner sought
restoration of the flat which does not appear to have been even
considered.

The petitioner had agreed to adjustment of

cancellation charges from his amount lying with the DDA which
the DDA consented to and actually effected.

Certainly, the

petitioner's case is required to be treated as all other tail end
priority cases as per the policy of the DDA. It is an admitted
position that the petitioner has not been considered for such
allotment.
I have therefore no hesitation in holding that the petitioner
is entitled to consideration of allotment of a MIG flat.
16. Accordingly, the DDA shall allot a flat to the petitioner as
expeditiously as possible and in any case, not later than three
months from today.

The specific flat to be allotted to the

petitioner shall be effected by including the name of the
petitioner in the next draw of lot be it regular or a mini draw of
lot of flats, which are located in the same zone as the flat which
was allotted to the petitioner pursuant to the demand-cumallotment letter dated 15th October, 1991. In case such flat is
not available, the petitioner would be considered for allotment

WP (C) No.119/2007

Page No.7

of a flat in an area which is closest to the zone where he was
alloted the flat in 1991.
17. So far as the costing is concerned, inasmuch as the
petitioner was required to be considered for allotment of a flat
in draw of lot held in July, 2004, the demand-cum-allotment
letter shall be issued in respect of the flat allotted to the
petitioner based on the costs of the flat which were prevalent as
on 31st July, 2004. Subject to completion of all formalities, the
petitioner shall be put in possession of the flat expeditiously.
This writ petition and the application are allowed in the
above terms.
The petitioner shall be entitled to costs of Rs.5,000/Dasti.
