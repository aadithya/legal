By way of this appeal, appellants seek to assail the
impugned award dated 27.2.2007.
The brief facts of the case relevant for appreciating
the present appeal is as under:On 25.5.2006, the deceased was crossing the road
near ITO at about 2.40 p.m., when a bus bearing registration
No. DL-1PB-3913 came at a fast speed in a rash and negligent
manner and hit the deceased due to which the deceased
sustained fatal injuries and he died on the spot.
Counsel for the appellant contends that the
Tribunal has not correctly applied the multiplier.

The

contention of counsel for the appellant is that even as per the
Second Schedule, the multiplier to be applied should have
been 13 instead of 14, as the age of the deceased was of 49
years.

Counsel further contends that in a case where the

Court has considered future prospects, the multiplier should
correspondingly be reduced.

Another contention raised by

counsel for the appellant is that the Tribunal has not applied
the criteria laid down in Sarla Dixit & Anr. Vs. Balwant
MAC APP. No. 244/2007

page 2 of 4

Yadav & Ors., 1996 ACJ 581 (SC) and has given the benefit
by doubling the salary of the deceased.

Counsel for the

appellant has calculated the amount of compensation after
applying the criteria laid down in

Sarla Dixit's case and

after applying the multiplier of 13, the same comes to
Rs.12,77,952/.
Counsel for the respondent states that he has no
objection if the said compensation is granted in favour of the
respondents.

He however, states that at least his cross

objections may be accepted to enhance the rate of interest.
I find that the Tribunal has granted lower rate of
interest i.e of 6% p.a.

I increase the rate of interest from 6%

to 7% but the same shall be paid on the said award amount
of Rs.12,77,952/- The appellant has already deposited 40% of
the award amount which has already been released in favour
of the claimants. The appellant shall deposit the remaining
amount after adding the differential amount with the Tribunal
and

the

Tribunal

shall

pass

necessary

directions

for

apportionment of the award amount in favour of the

claimants.
Parties are directed to approach the Tribunal for
apportionment of the award amount.
With these directions the appeal is disposed of.
