VIPIN SANGHI, J
1.

By this order I propose to dispose of Interlocutory

Application No. 5278/2005 moved under Order 9 Rule 13 read with

IA No 5278/05, 5280/05, 8161/05 in CS(OS) No. 1900A/96

section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the
judgment and decree dated the first of March 2005 passed in C.S.
(OS) No. 1900/1996.
2.

The said suit was filed by M/s. S. A. Builders for making

the arbitral award dated 28th of June 1996 a Rule of the court under
the Arbitration Act 1940. The applicant herein had filed their
objections against the said award within the limitation period. While
the matter was ripe for hearing and was being shown on the regular
board, none appeared on behalf of the applicant when the matter was
taken up on 1st March 2005 and the Court decided the matter ex
parte. The objections filed by the applicant came to be dismissed and
the decree was ordered to be drawn up in favour of the plaintiff.
3.

Thereafter, the decree holder preferred an execution

application being EA No. 75/2005. Notice of the filing of the said
execution petition was received by the applicant during the summer
vacations of 2005.
4.

The present application has been filed along with an

application for condonation of delay under section 5 of the Limitation
Act being IA no. 5280/2005 on the ground that the Counsel for the
applicant was not seized of the matter when the decree was passed.
5.

It is averred that after the counsel earlier handling the

matter was elevated to the bench, the matter was being conducted
by the counsel now on record. However, bearing in mind the
IA No 5278/05, 5280/05, 8161/05 in CS(OS) No. 1900A/96
7

Page 2 of

substantial stakes involved in the matter, the matter was returned
along with the case file on 21st of February 2005 by the clerk upon
the counselâ€™s instruction to the applicant department for engaging
some other senior counsel. The department, keeping in mind the fact
that the present counsel had been assisting the earlier counsel and
was well versed with the facts of the case returned the file to the
present counsel with instructions to brief a designated senior. A letter
to this effect dated 21-2-2005 showing subsequent markings and
notings has been filed along with the application. It is further averred
that the file was returned to the present counsel with these
instructions, on 17th of March 2005.
6.

However the matter had already been decided by the

time the file was returned with adequate instructions.

Unaware of

this fact, the office of the counsel for the applicant kept a careful eye
on the cause list from the date the file was returned.

The court

records pertaining to the case were however not inspected by the
counsel. This was due to an unintentional bonafide mistake on part of
the counsel. The applicant was therefore unaware of the fact that the
objections filed by it already stood dismissed and a decree passed in
the aforesaid suit.

It was only when the notice of the filing of the

execution petition was received by the applicant, the applicant
became aware of the passing of the said decree.

The applicant attempted to contact the office of the

counsel who is stated to have been traveling at the relevant time. As
the courts were closed on account of vacations, the counsel tried to
search for the orders on the Internet. However the same were not
available online. Thereafter the instant application has been filed at
the earliest possible opportunity without any delay.
8.

It is also urged that the earlier counsel had considerably

argued the matter though not concluded the same before the court,
no cognizance has been taken of this fact in the order sought to be
set aside.

Since the order levies a huge financial liability on the

department/applicant running into crores, it is prayed in the interests
of justice that the bonafide mistake of the counsel and the applicant
ought not to be permitted to defeat the legitimate objections of the
applicant.
9.

On these averments the judgment dated 1 March 2005 is

sought to be set aside.
10.

Replies to these applications have been filed by the

plaintiff/non-applicant opposing the same. It is contended that the
conduct of the applicant/its counsel is not merely a bonafide mistake
but constitutes gross negligence.

It is also contended that the

objections were not dismissed in default but have been considered on
merits by the Hon'ble Court and therefore no intervention is called for
with the judgment dated 1st March 2005. Sufficient cause has not
IA No 5278/05, 5280/05, 8161/05 in CS(OS) No. 1900A/96

been shown for condonation of delay and as well as for allowing the
application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC.
11.

In my view the objections raised by the non-applicant are

without any substance and liable to be rejected.

It is fallacious to

contend that since the order has been passed on merits, therefore, it
cannot be set aside under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC. Unlike Order 9 Rule 8
read with Order 9 Rule 9 CPC, wherein the suit is dismissed on
account of default and not on merits, Order 9 Rule 6 read with Order
9 Rule 13 CPC contemplate passing of a decree upon consideration of
the allegations made in the plaint.[See Mulla, The Code of Civil
Procedure(abridged), Thirteenth Edition, at 783, 787] An ex parte
decree is therefore a decree passed after consideration of the merits
of the case.
12.

In my view sufficient cause has been disclosed by the

applicant for the condonation of delay as well as for the setting aside
of the judgment/decree dated 1st March 2005.
13.

It is evident that the file of the case has been returned by

the then counsel to the Respondent by the communication dated 21st
February 2005 and when the matter was taken up by the court on the
1st March 2005, there was no advocate on record to represent the
cause of the Respondent/objector. The file was returned back by the
Department to the counsel on 17th March 2005 and in the meantime
on 1st March 2005 the matter came to be decided in the absence of
IA No 5278/05, 5280/05, 8161/05 in CS(OS) No. 1900A/96

the Respondent. Having returned the file the then counsel did not feel
obliged to track the matter in the cause list and it appears that the
Respondent also could not fathem the time within which the matter,
which was at Item No.8 in the final's list, would reach for hearing
before the court.
14.

The award in question is to the tune of Rs.45 lakhs apart

from interest and the prejudice that would be caused to the
Respondent in case the present applications are dismissed would be
substantial, while allowing these applications would only enable the
parties to present their respective arguments before the court in
respect of the challenge to the award.
15.

In the interest of justice, therefore, I allow the aforesaid

applications subject to payment of costs of Rs.5,000/-. The judgment
and order dated 1st March 2005 is set aside and the suit and the
objections to the award are restored to its original number. The
objections to the award be listed for hearing on 11th December, 2007.
