Rule.
With the consent of the parties, the matter is taken up for final hearing.

1.

The petitioner has sought a writ or direction seeking quashing of

the order dated 6th October, 2005 directing recovering of an amount of
Rs.98,000/- from the petitioner and further direction to recover the
amount along with interest at 18% per annum with effect from 4th
September, 2006 and a cost of Rs.11,000/-.

W.P(C) No.4771/2007

The amount of

Page 1 of 8

Rs.98,000/- was sanctioned and advanced by the respondents for the
purchase of medical equipment for the illness of the petitioner’s wife,
however, the sanction was recalled later on after the medical equipment
was purchased, on the ground that the Corporate Office of the MTNL
did not approve the sanction of the amount.

2.

The

petitioner

was

an

employee

of

Department

of

Telecommunication and was absorbed with effect from 1st November,
1998 with the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited.

3.

The petitioner and his family members are stated to be entitled

for medical facilities provided under CGHS prior to his absorption and
even after absorption till the medical facilities from CGHS were
withdrawn by Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited. The wife of the
petitioner suffered from Type-II Respiratory Failure & Chronic Hyprosia
entailing admission on 28th March, 2002 in Batra Hospital & Medical
Research Centre, an empanelled hospital of the MTNL. She was
discharged on 10th April, 2002 and was advised BIPAP for domiciliary
use.

The petitioner, therefore, made a request for the purchase of the

machine and the request of the petitioner was approved for an amount
of Rs.98,000/-. The petitioner purchased the machine from Life Line
Millennium Centre and the cheque was issued in favour of the seller for
Rs.98,000/- bearing No.424678 drawn on State Bank of India and the
machine was delivered to the petitioner on 11th July, 2002.

2003.

The wife of the petitioner, however, expired on 6th December,
The petitioner after purchasing the machine the payment of

which was made directly to the seller, submitted his medical
reimbursement claim. However, by letter dated 6th October, 2005, the
request of the petitioner for reimbursement was declined and it was
held that the case of the petitioner was not approved by the corporate
office and consequently the order for recovery of Rs.98,000/- from the
pay and allowance of the petitioner was passed.

5.

The petitioner appealed against the order dated 6th October,

2005. The petitioner also sought voluntary retirement with effect from
1st June, 2006, however, while giving the amounts due to the petitioner
on his voluntary retirement, an amount of Rs.98,000/- was deducted
from the gratuity amount of the petitioner and he was intimated by
letter dated 4th September, 2006.

6.

The petitioner has impugned the action of the Mahanagar

Telephone Nigam Limited of deducting the amount of Rs.98,000/- from
his pay and allowance on his taking voluntary retirement, the amount
which was sanctioned by the competent authority earlier for purchase
of BIPAP machine which was to be used by the petitioner’s wife for
domiciliary use and thereafter, ordering recovering the same on the
ground that the Corporate office of the respondents did not approve it.
W.P(C) No.4771/2007

Page 3 of 8

The petitioner contended that once the cheque was issued in the name
of the seller of the machine and the petitioner had acted upon the
representations made by the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited, the
amount could not be recovered from his pay and allowance on the
ground that the same has been not accepted by the corporate office and
the respondents are estopped from claiming the amount from the
petitioner.

7.

The respondents opposed the petition and filed a counter affidavit

of Administrative Officer (MR), Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited
dated 20th December, 2007 contending that after the amount of
Rs.98,000/- was sanctioned to the petitioner on 26th June, 2002 for the
purchase of said machine, the matter was sent to the corporate office
(headquarters), MTNL, for the formal approval and as there was no
scheme for providing reimbursement for the purchase of said machines,
the earlier decision of sanctioning the amount was withdrawn and the
petitioner was asked to refund the amount of Rs.98,000/- which was
sanctioned to the petitioner erroneously.

The appeal of the petitioner

was also rejected and the petitioner retired by taking voluntary
retirement on 1st June, 2006 and the amount which was sanctioned
erroneously was recovered from the pay and allowance payable to the
petitioner on his retirement.

In these circumstances, the respondent

sought dismissal of the writ petition.

I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused

the documents filed and relied on by the parties as well as the
judgments relied by the petitioner. The petitioner has relied on order
dated 5th February, 2007 in WP(C) No.1665/2006, Surendra Kumar v.
MTNL & Others, where the employee was sanctioned an amount as
medical advance for the purchase of machine for his treatment and the
cheque was also issued for the sanctioned amount to the seller of the
machine, however, later the request of the petitioner for medical claim
for reimbursement was rejected and the amount was recovered from the
pay of the employee.

A learned single Judge of this Court relying on

AIR 1979 SC 460, Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of
Uttar Pradesh; AIR 1971 SC 1021, Century Spinning & Manufacturing
Co. Ltd. v. the Ulhasnagar Municipal Council and Another and Surya
Narain Yadav and Others v. Bihar State Electricity Board and Others,
(1985) 3 SCC 38, had held that MTNL was not entitled to recover the
amount and had directed the Nigam to refund the amount.

9.

This cannot be disputed that the wife of the petitioner was

advised BIPAP for domiciliary use and a certificate was also issued by a
Senior Consultant of Batra Hospital & Medical Research Centre
pursuant to which the request was made by the petitioner for purchase
of the machine. The request of the petitioner was accepted for purchase
of machine for his wife and was conveyed to him by necessary
endorsement dated 8th May, 2002. Not only the sanction was conveyed
W.P(C) No.4771/2007

Page 5 of 8

for purchase of the machine, the amount was paid directly to the seller
of the machine by the MTNL.

10.

The petitioner has also produce a communication dated 26th

June, 2002 addressed to the Director, CGHS, stipulating that approval
for BIPAP machine for CGHS beneficiary for their domiciliary use could
be granted, subject to fulfilling the conditions of request being approved
by Medical Specialist and such a machine had to be provided once in a
life time of a particular beneficiary.

11.

The MTNL is a public organization and it is expected that it

should have taken adequate steps to provide such medical facilities as
are permitted by the Government. In case there were no guidelines with
MTNL, the sanction ought not have been granted to the petitioner to
purchase the appropriate machine for his wife which was advised by the
Medical Specialist.

After sanctioning the amount for purchase of the

machine, the purchase consideration for which was also paid by the
respondent directly to the seller of the machine, the respondent could
not cancel the sanction on the ground that the corporate office had not
approved the same. It is no more res integra that public bodies are as
much bound as private individual to honor the promises made by them
relying on which a person has altered his position to his prejudice and
detriment. Reliance can be placed on the judgments of the Supreme
Court, AIR 1979 SC 460, Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State
W.P(C) No.4771/2007

12.

Relying on the notification by the Central Government Health

Scheme, a learned single judge of this Court had held in Surender
Kumar (supra) that the respondent should issue formal guidelines, if
not, already existing as expeditiously as possible so that such medical
benefits which are available to the beneficiary of Central Government
Health Scheme are also available to the employee of MTNL. The learned
single Judge had granted three months’ time, however, the learned
counsel for the respondent is unable to show whether such reliefs as
had been directed by this Court, have been extended to the employees
of MTNL or not.

13.

In any case, for the reasons stated hereinabove, the respondents

were not entitled to claim back the amount of Rs.98,000/- which was
sanctioned by them for the purchase of BIPAP machine for domiciliary
use for his wife for which the purchase consideration was paid directly
to the seller and the machine was delivered to the petitioner for the use
of his wife.

14.

The learned counsel for the petitioner has also prayed interest on

the amount of Rs.98,000/- which was deducted from the gratuity
amount of the petitioner on his taking voluntary retirement. He
contends that the petitioner is entitled for the interest @ 12% per
annum.

15.

Consequently, the rule is made absolute and the order dated 6th

October, 2005 issued by respondent No.2 for recovery of Rs.98,000/from the petitioner is set aside and the respondents are directed to
refund the amount of Rs.98,000/- deducted from his gratuity and other
amounts within a period of six weeks.

Considering that the amount

was deducted from the gratuity which was payable to the petitioner, the
respondents are also directed to pay simple interests on the amount
deducted @ 12% per annum from the date the amount was deducted till
the amount is repaid to the petitioner. However, considering the facts
and circumstances, the parties are left to bear their own costs.

Copy of the order be given dasti to the counsel for the parties.
