A.K. SIKRI, J.
1.
The petitioner was appointed as Constable in Central Reserve
Police Force (CRPF).

At the time of making application for

recruitment to the said post, he did not inform the respondents
that there was a criminal case pending against him under
Sections 148/149/323/325/506 IPC.

It is not in dispute that

there was a specific column in the application for giving such an
information about the involvement of the applicant in a criminal
case. The respondents came to know of the pendency of such a
case when verification of the petitioners antecedents was made
by requesting Superintendent of Police, Rohtak (Haryana). The
petitioner was still a temporary employee and, therefore,
invoking the provisions of Rule 5(1) of CCS (Temporary Service)
WP (C) No. 5213/2000

nsk

Rules, 1965 his services were terminated vide order dated
22.1.2000.

The petitioner submitted appeal there against,

which was also dismissed by the DIG, CRPF on 22.2.2000.
Thereafter, revision petition was filed, which met the same fate
as it came to be rejected on 11.4.2000. In these circumstances,
the petitioner has approached this Court by way of the present
petition seeking quashing of the aforesaid termination order
and subsequent affirmation by the higher authorities.

2.

The aforesaid factual matrix is not in dispute.

The nature of

concealment of the pendency of case is reflected in para 3 of the
order dated 11.4.2000 passed in appeal, which can be
reproduced for our benefit :“3.
From the history of the case and parawise
comments on the appeal received from ADIGP GC CRPF
J/Kalan New Delhi, and the DIGP CRPF New Delhi, it has
revealed that the appellant was appointed as Constable
(GD) against the strength of GC (CRPF) New Delhi wef
10/09/98 and he was despatched to RTC-III, Pallipuram
(Kerala) for basic training on 4.10.98. Subsequently, a
complaint was received to the effect that a criminal
case was pending against the appellant in the Court of
CJM Rohtak. Since, the mention about pendency of any
such criminal case was not made by the appellant
against the prescribed column, i.e., column No. 12(b) in
Verification Roll, GC New Delhi, requested SP Rohtak
(Haryana) to verify and forward report on the issue. In
reply, vide letter No. 20902/S dated 27.12.99, SP
Rohtak (Haryana) confirmed that case No. 181 dated
23.8.94 U/s. 148/149/323/325/506, I.P.C. is still
pending in the court of CJM, Rohtak.
Since, the
appellant supressed the aforesaid information while
filling the verification Roll ignoring the warning quoted
in the beginning of verification Roll, he was considered
un-suitable for employment in CRPF. Since he was a
purely temporary Govt. Servant, his services were
terminated by the ADIGP GC New Delhi, without
assigning any reasons under provision of Rule 5(1) of
CCS (TS) Rules 1965 vide O/O No. D.V-1/2000-EC-V
dated 22nd Jan'2000 with one month's pay and
allowances in lieu of notice.”

3.

The question is as to whether the impugned termination order
can be faulted with even when it is an accepted position that the

petitioner had not disclosed the pendency of the said case while
submitting

the

application

and

to

that

extent

he

had

misrepresented and/or concealed the said fact.

4.

This issue came up for consideration before a Division Bench of
this Court, in which one of us (A.K. Sikri, J.) was a member, in
the case of Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Ors. v. Jitender Kumar {WP
(C) No. 8385/2002 decided on 20.12.2007} and taking note of
certain judgments the position in law was summarised in para
11 of the said judgment in the following terms :“11. We may remark here that where the case is
pending at the time of filling up of the form, position
would be different and in case a candidate conceals
such an information or provides wrong information, the
candidature or even the appointment can be cancelled
{See – Sanjay Kumar Bajpai v. Union of India, 1997 II
AD SC 704}. Similarly, where the prosecution, though
resulted in acquittal, was for an offence which
otherwise involves moral turpitude, it may be necessary
to mention particulars of such a case as that may be a
relevant consideration to adjudge the conduct or
character of a candidate to be appointed to a service
even when such a prosecution resulted in acquittal,
inasmuch as, it would provide information about the
antecedents
of
the
candidate
{See
–
Delhi
Administration through its Chief Secretary & Ors. v.
Sushil Kumar, JT 1996 (10) SC 34}. However, where the
offence with which the candidate was charged was petty
offence not involving moral turpitude and it has
resulted in acquittal as well and going by the petty
nature of the offence if such a factor is not material
enough to deny appointment to a candidate, nondisclosure thereof shall not be a ground to terminate
his services.”

5.

In the present case, the petitioner was charged under Sections
148/149/323/325/506 IPC, which would definitely involve moral
turpitude. Bound by the legal dictum, as laid down by the Apex
Court and noted in the aforesaid judgment, we are not in a
position to accept the submission of the learned counsel for the
petitioner insofar as the obligation of the petitioner to disclose
the aforesaid information is concerned.
