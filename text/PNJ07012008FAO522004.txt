which occurred during the course of his employment with the
factory M/s. S.K.Plastics (respondent No.1) (hereinafter referred

at a salary of Rs.2,000/- per month.

FAO.No.52/04

Page 2 of 11

used to pay to the deceased Rs.500/- per month as over time
charges.
G

The

working

conditions

in

the

factory

were

dangerous to human life as there were live electricity wires
present in the factory premises.
H

On

various

occasions

deceased

informed

respondent No.2 about the presence of live electricity wires in
the factory premises and asked him to rectify the said defect.
I

Respondent No.2 did not pay any heed to the

request of the deceased.
J

On 9.5.1995 respondent No.2 directed the deceased

to work over time and asked him to report at the factory
premises after 8:00 PM.
K

On said date deceased died due to electrocution

while working on a machine installed in the factory premises.
L

Deceased was aged 19 years at the time of his

death.
4.

Defence set up by the respondents to the claim

petition filed by the appellants was that:A

Deceased was employed as a chowkidar in the

factory and was not employed as a Mistri as alleged by the
appellants.
B

Deceased neither died due to an accident which

FAO.No.52/04

Page 3 of 11

occurred during the course of his employment with the
respondent No.1 nor the death of the deceased was a result of
the negligence of respondent No.2.
C

Deceased died a natural death.

D

Deceased did not die due to the electrocution while

working on a machine installed in the factory.
E

There was no electricity connection in the factory

since 1993.
F

No manufacturing work was being conducted in the

factory since the year 1994.
5.

As an incidental defence respondents pleaded that

the deceased never complained to the respondent No.2 about
the presence of live electricity wires in the factory premises.
6.

On behalf of the appellants, appellant No.1 Smt.

Shrem Wati (mother of the deceased), one Mr. Ajit Kumar
(maternal uncle of the deceased) and one Mr. Anil Kumar who
was an assistant Ahlmad in a Criminal Court in Delhi were
examined as PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3 respectively.
7.

PW-1 and PW-2 deposed on the lines of the claim

petition.

They also deposed that they visited the factory

premises on various occasions.

That during the time of the

visit they found that manufacturing work was being conducted
in the factory and also saw live electricity wires in the factory.
FAO.No.52/04

Page 4 of 11

8.

Anil Kumar PW-3 brought the record pertaining to a

criminal case registered against the respondent No.2 under
Section 304 A IPC in connection with the death of the
deceased.

He proved site plan Ex. PW-4/B prepared at the

time of the death of the deceased and postmortem report of
the deceased PW-1/A.
9.

Site plan Ex. PW-4/B shows that the death of the

deceased

had

taken

place

in

the

factory

premises.

Postmortem report of the deceased Ex. PW-1/A shows that
deceased died due to electrocution.
10.

On behalf of the respondents, respondent no.2 Mr.

Sudhir Airi and one Mr.Yograj Tyagi were examined as DW-1
and DW-2 respectively.
11.

DW-1

reiterated

the

defence

taken

by

the

respondents in the written statement. He deposed that the
appellants have wrongly alleged that the manufacturing work
was being conducted in the factory premises. That he was
having a godown in the said factory. That he found the dead
body of the deceased outside the factory premises. That the
working hours of the deceased were from 9 AM to 5.30 PM.
12.

It is further relevant to note the following portions of

the cross-examination of DW-1:“I do not have any record regarding the payment of
FAO.No.52/04

Page 5 of 11

wages to the deceased. I maintained records related
to payment of wages but at present I do not have any
record.
xxx xxx xxx
It is incorrect to suggest that when the deceased died
he was under my employment. It is correct that
when deceased died he was under my employment. I
did not give my intimation to any authority about the
death of the deceased including the CWZ. It is
incorrect to suggest that death of the deceased took
place in my premises, but it is correct that he died
due to electric current.”
13.

Mr.Yograj Tyagi DW-2 was the owner of the factory

premises. He deposed that he had let out the factory premises
to respondent no.2. That electricity connection of the factory
premises was disconnected in the year 1993 and that same
was not restored.
14.

In his cross-examination DW-2 deposed as under:“It is correct Sh.Birpal Singh died due to electrocution
in the factory of M/s.S.K.Plastic.”

15.

The

Commissioner

Workmen's

Compensation

dismissed the claim petition filed by the appellant for the
following three reasons:A

The testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2 suffer from

contradictions.
B

The stand of the appellant was that the working

hours of the deceased were from 8 AM to 8 PM. No suggestion
was given by the appellant to DW-1 that he was deposing
FAO.No.52/04

Page 6 of 11

falsely that working hours of the deceased were from 9 AM to
5.30 PM. That thus version of the respondents stands
established that the working hours of the deceased were from
9 AM to 5.30 PM and not from 8 AM to 8 PM as alleged by the
appellants.
C

The testimony of one Mr. Mahinder Singh ASI in the

criminal court during the trial of the case registered against the
respondent no.2 under Section 304-A IPC was noted. He had
deposed that he conducted investigation pertaining to said
case. That when he visited the factory premises on 9.05.95 i.e.
a day after the death of the deceased he found that there was
no electricity in the factory premises. That this establishes the
version of the respondents that the electricity connection of
the factory premises was disconnected in the year 1993.
16.

The only question that needs consideration in the

present case is whether the decision of the trial court of
dismissing the claim petition of the appellants was correct.
17.

A cumulative consideration of pleadings of the

parties and evidence on record reveals following facts:A

Deceased died in the factory premises as evidenced

by the site plan Ex.PW4/B.
B

Deceased died due to electrocution as evidenced by

postmortem report of the deceased Ex.PW1/A.
FAO.No.52/04

Page 7 of 11

C

At the time of his death deceased was working

under the employment of respondent no.2. This fact stands
admitted by the respondent no.2 in his testimony as DW-1.
D

Respondents did not produce any record to show

that the deceased was employed as a Chowkidar and not as a
mistri. It was also pleaded that deceased was not paid salary @
Rs.2,000/- per month as alleged by the appellants but was paid
the wages of that of an unskilled workman. Though it was
deposed by the respondent no.1 in his testimony as SW-1 that
he maintains records relating to payment of wages to its
employees yet he did not produce any record pertaining to the
wages of the deceased. Non-production of record pertaining to
the wages of the deceased leads to an adverse inference to be
drawn against the respondents.
E

Respondent no.2 in his testimony has pleaded that

he was having a godown in the factory premises and was not
running a factory as alleged by the appellants. He further
deposed that besides deceased 2-3 ladies were working in the
said godown. The examination of the said ladies would have
lend credence to the version of the respondent no.2 that he
was having a godown in the factory premises and no
manufacturing activities were being carried out from the said
premises. So-called employees were not examined by the
FAO.No.52/04

Page 8 of 11

respondents. Non-examination of said so-called employees
leads to an adverse inference to be drawn against the
respondents.
F

Defence set up by the respondents as that the

deceased died a natural death. However in his crossexamination respondent no.2 admitted that the deceased died
due to electric shock.
G

DW-2 (a witness on behalf of the respondents) by

deposing that deceased died due to electrocution in the factory
of respondent no.2 belies the version of the respondents that
the deceased died a natural death and death of the deceased
did not occur in the factory of respondent no. 2.
H

As afore-noted respondents has incidentally pleaded

that the deceased never complained to the respondent no.2
about the presence of live electricity wires in the factory
premises.

This shows that the respondents were conscious

that it can be proved that the death of the deceased occurred
due to the electrocution while working on a machine installed
in the factory premises therefore they pleaded that the
deceased never complained about the presence of live
electricity wires.
18.

The facts noted in para 17 above are pointers

indicating that the death of the deceased occurred due to the
FAO.No.52/04

Page 9 of 11

electrocution while working on a machine installed in the
factory premises.
19.

Trial court has merely held that the testimonies of

PW-1 and PW-2 suffer from contradictions. The so-called
contradictions in the testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2 have not
been noted and explained by the trial court.
20.

Ex-facie, there appears to be no contradictions in

the testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2.
21

The fact that no suggestion was given by the

appellants to the respondent no.1 that he is deposing falsely
that the working hours of the deceased were from 9 AM to 5.30
PM is of no relevance in the light of facts noted in para 17
above which indicates that the death of the deceased occurred
due to the electrocution while working on a machine installed
in the factory premises.
22.

Not much importance can be attached to the

testimony of ASI Mahinder Singh that there was no electricity
in the factory premises on 10.05.95 i.e. a day after the death
of the deceased. Theft of electricity is rampant in Delhi. It is
also possible that the respondent no.2 after being aware that
the police officials are coming for inspection disconnected the
electricity. Admittedly, the deceased died due to electrocution
and place of death is the factory. I need not speculate.
FAO.No.52/04

Page 10 of 11

23.

In view of the above discussion and particularly

facts noted in para 17 above I hold that the death of the
deceased occurred due to electrocution while working in the
factory premises i.e. during the course of employment in
respondent no.1 and thus respondent no.2 being owner/sole
proprietor of respondent no.1 is liable to pay compensation to
the appellants. Impugned order is set aside.
24.

Since compensation payable has to be computed I

remand

the

matter

to

the

Commissioner

Workmen's

Compensation who shall determine the compensation in
accordance with the law.
25.

No costs.
