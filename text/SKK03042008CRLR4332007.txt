SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.

1.

The aforesaid two revision petitions arise out of a common
order framing charges against a number of accused
including the petitioners. The order of charge was passed

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

Page 1 of 14

on

13.03.2007

and

the

charges

were

framed

on

16.03.2007.
2.

The brief facts leading to the said framing of charges are
set out hereinafter:

3.

Sh.Virender Verma (A-1) applied for a loan on 16.10.1989
with the New Bank of India, Defence Colony, New Delhi for
his newly constructed firm M/s M.H.Enterprises.

Three

different loan facilities were sought for. The loan facilities
were granted and payment not made and on an enquiry, it
was found that the Bank had been cheated to the tune of
Rs. 54,18,602.50 which resulted in registration of RC
14(A)/94

dated

25.02.1994.

On

completion

of

investigation, the charge sheet was filed.
4.

The charge sheet claims that the then Branch Manager (A4) failed to carry out pre sanction inspection to ensure the
interests

of

the

Bank

and

recommended

the

loan

application of Mr.Virender Verma (A-1) to the Regional
Office on the same date when it was applied for i.e.
16.10.1989.

At the Regional Office, the application was

scrutinized by Smt. Neeta Dhawan, Junior Manager, who
noticed a number of shortcomings in the loan application.
On the note made by Smt.Neeta Dhawan, Mr. Ashok
Kumar, the then Manager (Loan), gave his comments.
The file was then put up with the said two notings to Sh.
D.K.Gupta

(A-5),

who

is

the

petitioner

in

Crl

Rev.P.433/2007. Sh. Gupta made an endorsement ‘raise

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

Page 2 of 14

the queries’ and thus reply was sought from the Branch in
respect of the notings made on 27/28.10.1989.

The

reply to these queries was submitted by Mr.Vijender
Verma (A-1) on 30.10.1989 even though the official letter
from

the

Regional

Office

reached

the

Branch

on

16.11.1989. A pre sanction inspection survey was carried
out by Sh. K.L.Bhasin (A-4) and as per his report dated
02.11.1989 replies were sent to the queries. On receipt of
the letter from Mr.K.L.Bhasin (A-4), in the Regional Office,
Smt.Neeta

Dhawan

again

pointed

that

there

were

shortcomings which were yet to be fulfilled and on the
reverse of the letter, Sh. Ashok Kumar, Manager (loan)
marked the said note to Sh. D.K.Gupta (A-5) for removal of
the shortcomings.

It is alleged that Sh.D .K.Gupta instead

of asking removal of the shortcomings, directed the
sanction note to be put up with stipulation and a superior
Sh.A.R.Lamba endorsed the same and directed the facility
to be released after obtaining the required papers. It may
be noted that the charge sheet also mentions the factum
of the non existence of the firm of Mr.Vijender Verma (A-1)
at the given address including the stated tenanted
premises.
5.

Charge sheet blamed Sh.D.K.Gupta (A-5) for not taking
due care to ensure that the short comings pointed out by
Smt. Neeta Dhawn and Sh. Ashok Kumar were completed
and note was given by him that ‘we may put detailed

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

Page 3 of 14

sanction note with stipulation’ and that he removed the
notings put up by Smt.Neeta Dhawan and Mr. Ashok
Kumar.

This is the sum and substance of the role

assigned to Sh. D.K.Gupta.
6.

Insofar

as

Smt.

Anjali

Verma

(A-7),

petitioner

in

Crl.Rev.P.341/2007 is concerned, she is the wife of
Mr.Vijender Verma (A-1).

It was found that Mr.Vijender

Verma (A-1) had opened an account No.CA 995 in Bharat
Overseas Bank in the name of a non-existent sole
proprietorship concern M/s.A.V.Apparels International of
which Ms.Anjali Verma (A-7), wife of Mr.Vijender Verma,
was the sole proprietor.

Smt.Anjali Verma (A-7) gave a

power of attorney to Mr.Vijender Verma (A-1) to operate
the account and it is stated that no such firm was existing
at the address given in the account opening form. It was
found that cheque bearing no.868066 dated 04.01.1990
for Rs.40609/- bore her signatures on the reverse as
proprietor of M/s.A.V.Apparels International

and the

cheque was endorsed by Ms.Anjali Verma (A-7) in favour
of Mr.Vijender Verma (A-1), who encashed it.

Smt.Anjali

Verma (A-7), wife of Mr.Vijender Verma, sole proprietor of
M/s.A.V.Apparels International, was stated to be a part of
the conspiracy and abetted the offence by drawing and
diverting the cash sanctioned by the bank fraudulently to
Mr.Vijender Verma, accused no.1.

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

Page 4 of 14

7.

Learned Special Judge found prima facie case against
Mr.Vijender

Verma

(A-1),

Mr.K.L.Bhasin

(A-4),

Mr.D.K.Gupta (A-5) and Ms. Anjali Verma (A-7) for offences
punishable under Section 120B r/w Sections 420 and 471
of IPC and Section 13 (2) r/w Section 13(1)(d) of the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.

In view of the fact

that role of the two petitioners is different and only the
factual matrix aforesaid is common, the matters are
hereinafter dealt with separately.
Crl.Rev.P.433/2007 (Mr.D.K.Gupta)
8.

It has been pointed out aforesaid that the only role
assigned to the petitioner was that he did not take due
care to ensure that the shortcomings pointed out by
Smt.Neeta Dhawan and Mr.Ashok Kumar were completed
and that the note was given by him to put up the detailed
sanction report with the superior removing the notes put
up by Smt.Neeta Dhawan and Mr. Ashok Kumar.

In the

order of charge, it has been mentioned that the sanction
order was issued with certain stipulations, but that would
not absolve the petitioner of his misconduct to cause
pecuniary advantage to third person by abusing his
position as a public servant and thus there were grounds
for presuming that the petitioner/accused Mr.D.K.Gupta
was a party to the criminal conspiracy.
9.

The documents filed by the petitioner and the Trial Court
Record have been perused.

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

Page 5 of 14

10.

It is not in dispute that after the shortcomings were
pointed out by Smt.Neeta Dhawan and Mr.Ashok Kumar on
27/28.10.1989, petitioner herein had given the remark
that the queries should be raised. Thus no fault could be
attributed to the petitioner as he himself asked the
queries to be raised in terms of the aspects pointed out by
the said two officers. On the second occasion, when it was
found that there were still some matters which needed to
be attended to as per the note dated 04.11.1989 of the
said two officers, all that the petitioner did vide note dated
06.11.1989 was to direct that the sanction note be put up
with stipulation.

The purport of the said note was clear

that the sanction should be granted subject to compliance
of the stipulation. The stipulations were as under:
i.

Party yet to receive the SSI certificate from the
concerned authority;

ii.

Details of experience;

iii.

Sh.P.D.Mehar, the Proprietor, present assignment
and where did he have his experience in garments;

iv.

Pre-sanction report on the assets of proprietor.

v.

Area of factory land.

vi.

I.T.Returns of proprietor and guarantor for last three
years and assessment orders.

11.

The file was thereafter put up to a superior Sh.A.R.Lamba
who endorsed ‘yes’ with further remarks that facility may
be released after obtaining required papers. The matter

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

Page 6 of 14

was thus dealt with by a superior, who found that the
necessary requirements as initially put up by Smt.Neeta
Dhawan and Mr.Ashok Kumar must be fulfilled and
sanction granted subject to the same.

It cannot be lost

sight of that these officers were all located at the Regional
Office and not at the Branch Office. It is the function of
the officers at the Branch Office to confirm the ground
realities.

Thus aspects like, checking-up the addresses,

verifying other aspects, visit to the site have to be dealt
with by the Branch Office.

The role of the Regional Office

is to process the loan application and see whether it
meets with the norms and requirements of the bank.

The

borrower, as per the papers forwarded from the Branch
Office, had completed the necessary requirements after
the initial enquiries were raised except to the extent
pointed out by Smt.Neeta Dhawan and Mr.Ashok Kumar on
04.11.1989.

The borrower thus was required to give

certain reports and certificates as mentioned aforesaid
and thus naturally when this note was put up to the
petitioner he directed that since all formalities had been
completed other than aforesaid, the sanction note be put
up with stipulations.

He was in any case not the

sanctioning authority. The matter was thereafter put up
to Sh.A.R.Lamba who approved it saying that the facility
may be released after obtaining the required papers.

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

Page 7 of 14

12.

The discussion aforesaid shows that there can hardly be
attributed anything to the petitioner or any impropriety in
his role could be found or any act of his could be said to
have caused wrongful gain to the borrower.

The

averment in the charge sheet that he removed the notes
put up by Smt.Neeta Dhawan and Mr.Ashok Kumar are
also not borne out from the record. This is so in view of
the document letter DEF/LD/5022/03.11.89 which contains
notings

dated

04.11.1989

of

Sh.Ashok

Kumar

and

Smt.Neeta Dhawan, dated 06.11.1989 of the petitioner
and dated 08.11.1989 of Sh.A.K.Lamba.

This also

appears to be the reason that on this aspect there is no
discussion in the order of charge.

The petitioner had not

waived or relaxed the queries put up by his subordinates
and, in fact, had directed that it should be ensured the
shortcomings were completed and the sanction was
subject to the completion of the same which was approved
by his superior officers.

There is thus no allegation

worthwhile against the petitioner.
13.

It is the settled principle of law that at the stage of
framing of charge, the court does not go into detailed
scrutiny of the material on record but has to only sift and
weigh the evidence for purposes of finding out if a prima
facie case is made out.

In case, two views are equally

possible and the evidence gives rise to some suspicion but
not

grave

suspicion,

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

the

accused

is

liable

to

Page 8 of 14

be

discharged.

In this behalf, it would be useful to refer to

the judgment cited by learned counsel for the petitioner in
Dilawar Balu Kurane v. State of Maharashtra; 2002 SCC
(Crl.) 310.

In Seeta Hemchandra Shashittal v. State of

Maharashtra 2001 (I) JCC (SC) 185 it has been held that
where the material was too insufficient against the
accused, the charges should not be framed.

In view of

the limited role of the petitioner, it can hardly be said that
there is any evidence of criminal conspiracy or evidence
under the PC Act.

There was in fact no impropriety in the

actions of the petitioner.

It is in view thereof that the

Supreme Court in Soma Chakravarty v. State through CBI;
(2007) 5 SCC 403

has observed that charges may be

directed to be framed where there exists a strong
suspicion but that is also trite to say that the Court must
come to a prima facie finding that there exists some
material and suspicion alone without anything more
cannot form the basis.

The Trial

Court cannot be a

mouthpiece of prosecution.
14.

A perusal of the charge sheet as well as the order of
charge itself shows that other than alleging the two
aspects of the petitioner not directing fulfillment of the
conditions imposed by his subordinates and alleging that
the petitioner had removed the notes put up by Smt.Neeta
Dhawan and Mr. Ashok Kumar, nothing more has been
said. Out of these two aspects the order of charge does

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

Page 9 of 14

not even mention the last aspect and rightly so as the
discussion on the note aforesaid shows that the same is
not borne out from the record.

The note of the petitioner

himself directed compliance of the conditions imposed by
his subordinate officers and thereafter his note was
endorsed by the superior officer.
15.

I am thus of the considered view that there is no material
whatsoever on record for framing of charges against the
petitioner.

Crl.Rev.P.341/2007 (Smt. Anjali Verma)
16.

The petitioner is the wife of Mr.Virender Verma (A-1).
However that itself cannot be suffice to frame charges as
the sins of the husband cannot be visited on his wife
without any material on record.

The charge against the

petitioner is that account no. CA995 had been opened by
Mr.Vijender Verma (A-1) in the name of his wife petitioner
(A-7) with Bharat Overseas Bank
existent firm.

in respect of a non-

In fact, the firm is a sole proprietorship

concern of the petitioner (A-7) and it was alleged that it
did not exist at the address stated by the petitioner in the
account opening form.

It was further found that a cheque

no.868066 dated 04.01.1990 for Rs.40609/- , which bore
her signatures on the reverse as proprietor of M/s
A.V.Apparels International, was encashed by Mr. Virender
Verma (A-1) as it was endorsed by the petitioner (A-7) in
favour of her husband.

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

The order of charge found that

Page 10 of 14

the account was opened by the petitioner on 15.06.1989
while the application for loan was made by her husband
Mr. Virender Verma (A-1) on 16.10.1989.

Thus it was

found that no inference of any conspiracy between
Mr.Virender Verma (A-1) and the petitioner could be found
on that account.

However, what has weighed with the

Trial Court is that in the statement of two witnesses, it was
found that the firm was not functioning at the stated
address. Simultaneously, it has been observed that more
than one firm pertaining to the same family members
could possibly function from the same address, but the
stage was not for the court to accept the statements of
the witnesses recorded under Section 161 of the said
Code.
17.

It was also found that the number of cheques/pay orders
were issued in favour of M/s A.V.Apparels by M/s
M.H.Enterprises.

The cheques bearing no. 868066 in the

sum of Rs. 40609/- and the cheque bearing no.873234 in
the sum of Rs. 9,141/- were endorsed by the petitioner in
favour of Mr.Vijender Verma (A-1)

and based on that

account an inference has been drawn that the petitioner
was definitely playing some part in diversion of the funds.
It cannot be lost sight of that the petitioner is the wife of
Mr.Vijdender Verma (A-1) and operations were conducted
by Mr.Vijender Verma (A-1).

The only thing that the

petitioner had done is that the cheques in question issued

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

Page 11 of 14

in favour of M/s A.V.Apparels were endorsed in favour of
Mr.Vijdender Verma (A-1) and encashed by Mr.Vijender
Verma (A-1). The statement of account shows that there
are numerous transactions carried out by Mr.Vijender
Verma (A-1) and the link to the petitioner is only that two
cheques made out by the firm of Mr. Vijender Verma (A1) in the name of M/s A.V.Apparels Ltd, proprietorship firm
of accused no.7, were got signed by the petitioner for
endorsement in favour of Mr. Vijender Verma (A-1) who in
turn encashed the cheques.

There was thus fund flow

back to Mr.Vijender Verma (A-1) and there is no question
of any diversion of funds as it is not a case made out that
the petitioner played any role while making the application
for borrowing or her proprietorship firm had a role to play
in the same.
18.

It was the case of the sole proprietorship of M/s
M.H.Enterprises

of

Mr.Vijender

Verma

(A-1)

showing

payment being made to the sole proprietorship of the
petitioner and getting the same cheques endorsed in his
favour for encashment.

This was possible as the cheques

though made out in the name of proprietorship firm of the
petitioner were bearer, it is also relevant to note that the
deposition of the witness no.7 Mr.Hardan Singh relied
upon

by

the

prosecution

shows that,

in

fact,

M/s

A.V.Apparels Ltd was functioning from the premises at
245, Khanpur, New Delhi, but stopped operations from

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

Page 12 of 14

01.10.1989 and had stopped operations from the premises
only 2-3 years back prior to the statement recorded on
07.06.1995. Thus the original address was correct but the
firm had stopped operating from the address after a stage
of time.

The firm was, in fact, practically operated by

Mr.Vijdender Verma (A-1) in pursuance to an attorney in
his favour.

The same principles of law as enunciated

aforesaid, would apply in the present case and mere
suspicion arising out of the factum of the petitioner being
wife of Mr.Vijdener Verma (A-1) would not be sufficient to
charge the petitioner.
19.

It is not a case of grave suspicion against the petitioner or
any prima facie material to form such a grave suspicion. It
is really only the relationship of Mr.Vijender Verma (A-1)
and the petitioner which seems to have persuaded the
Special Court to frame charges against the petitioner.

20.

In my considered view, there is really no material to frame
charges against the petitioner since the two cheques
referred to only show that Mr.Vijender Verma (A-1) made
payments to the sole proprietorship of the petitioner and
instead of getting the amount credited to the account of
the proprietorship concerned, got the cheques endorsed in
his name and encashed the same.

Thus, the fund flow

from the proprietorship concern of Mr. Vijender Verma (A1) to the proprietorship concern of the petitioner did not
take place.

Crl. Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl. Rev.P.341/2007

Page 13 of 14

21.

The impugned order of charge and the charges framed
against the petitioner can also thus not be sustained and
the impugned orders are liable to be quashed.

Conclusion:
22.

The result of the aforesaid is that both the petitions –
Crl.Rev.P.433/2007 and Crl.Rev.P.341/2007 – are allowed
and the order of charge and the charges framed against
the petitioners impugned in these two petitions are
quashed and the petitioners are discharged.

23.

The petitions stand accordingly allowed.

24.

The trial court record be sent back.
