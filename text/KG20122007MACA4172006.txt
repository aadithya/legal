KAILASH GAMBHIR, J.
The present appeal preferred under Section 173 of
The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, arises out of the award dated 2nd
March, 2006 of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, whereby
MAC APP. 417/2006

page 1 of 13

the Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 7,74,000/- along with
interest @ 8% per annum to the appellant from the date of
filing of the petition.
The brief facts of the present case for better
appreciation of the matter are that the deceased Sh. Satyavir,
aged 36 years along with Sh. Ram Karan was going to his house
at Jhajjar from Rama Vihar via Karala Road on a scooter
bearing registration no. HR 4A 7566 on 27/9/2001. At 7:00 pm
on reaching Manjari Karala Road, the said scooter was hit by a
tanker bearing registration no. HR 3B 3788, from behind and
as a result of this both of them received injuries and were taken
to the hospital, where Sh. Satyavir succumbed to his injuries on
3rd October, 2001. On 6th October 2004, the Tribunal allowed
the application filed by the Insurance Company under Section
170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. On 20th November 2004
the claims petition was filed before the Tribunal and award was
passed on 2nd March 2006 by the learned Tribunal.
Respondents i.e. driver and owner were proceeded ex-parte by

MAC APP. 417/2006

page 2 of 13

the learned tribunal on account of non-appearance. For the
purpose of computation of compensation towards loss of
dependency, income of the deceased was taken as that of a
matriculate as

prevalent on the date of the death of the

deceased under the Minimum Wages Act in the absence of any
cogent evidence being brought and duly proved on record
regarding income, which he was earning prior to his death.
The learned tribunal applied multiplier of 17; calculated
dependency at 3/4th and considered future prospects of increase
in the income while calculating the quantum of compensation.
The tribunal awarded a total sum of Rs. 7,74,000 @ 8% p.a.;
out of which Rs. 7,14,000 were awarded towards pecuniary
damages and remaining sum towards non-pecuniary damages.
Aggrieved with the award passed by the learned tribunal, the
appellant insurance company has assailed the award and has
preferred the present appeal under Section 173 of The Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988.
Sh. L. K. Tyagi, Counsel for the appellant has

MAC APP. 417/2006

page 3 of 13

assailed the impugned award on five grounds. Firstly, it was
contended that the tribunal has erroneously considered the
future prospects of the income of the deceased to the extent of
double and has taken his average income at Rs. 4,650 pm when
no cogent evidence on record has been placed in this regard.
Secondly, it has been submitted by the counsel that the tribunal
has taken dependency at 3/4th in place of 2/3rd. Thirdly, the
counsel urged that the multiplier of 17 applied by the tribunal
is on the higher side. Fourthly, the counsel asserted that the
rate of interest allowed by the tribunal is on the higher side and
should have been at 5% per annum in place of 8% per annum.
Finally, the counsel maintained that the Tribunal erred while
awarding Rs. 40,000 on account of general damages, which is
on a higher side as compared to the amount allowed in the
second schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 on account of
general damages, which should have been Rs. 9,500/-.
The counsel for the appellant has relied on the
following judgements of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in support

MAC APP. 417/2006

page 4 of 13

of his contentions:
(1) Bijoy Kumar Dugar vs. Bidya Dhar Dutta & Ors. – (2006)
3 SCC 242;
(2)Managing Director, TNSTC Ltd. Vs. K.I. Bindu & Ors. –
2006 ACJ 423 (SC);
(3)Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Ltd. Vs. S.
Rajapriya & Ors. – II (2005) ACC 476 (SC); and
(4)General Manager, Kerela State Road Transport
Corporation, Trivandrum vs. Susamma Thomas & Ors. –
(1994) 2 SCC 176.
Per contra, Mr. O.P. Mannie, counsel for the
respondents 1 to 5 has refuted all the contentions of the counsel
for the appellant. The counsel has strongly justified the award
dated 2nd March 2006 made by the learned tribunal. Counsel
maintained that the tribunal has correctly taken into
consideration the future prospects of the income of the
deceased. Counsel averred that the deceased was survived by
his widow, his three minor children, aged 10, 12 and 5 yrs
besides his father at the time of the accident and hence, tribunal
has rightly calculated dependency at 3/4th. The counsel has also

MAC APP. 417/2006

page 5 of 13

urged that the multiplier of 17 as applied by the tribunal in the
facts and circumstances of the case is just and fair to meet the
ends of justice. It was also contended by the counsel that the
rate of interest and the general damages allowed by the learned
tribunal are not on the higher side but are just and fair.
The counsel for the respondents no. 1 to 5 has relied on
the following judgements in support of his contentions:
(1) A.P.S.R.T.C. vs. M. Pentaiah Chary
– 2007 VIII AD (SC) 552;
(2)Kanhayalal Kataria & Ors. Vs.
Mukul Chaturvedi & Ors. – 2007

(7) Unreported decision in MAC APP
No. 40/2004 & Cross Objections
/2004 dated 25th January 2007.
I have heard counsel for both the parties and have
perused the record.
The main thrust of the argument of the counsel for
the appellant is that the Tribunal has wrongly taken into
consideration the future

prospects of the income of the

deceased to the extent of double by applying the criteria as
laid down in Sarla Dixit's case.

This argument of the

counsel for the appellant is based on the judgment of the Apex
Court in Bijoy Kumar's case (Supra) in which the Apex
Court has taken a view that unless entitlement to the future
prospects are established by way of some reliable evidence, the
future prospects cannot be taken into consideration. The facts
of the present case shows that no such evidence was placed by
the respondent to claim future prospects and the Tribunal has
allowed the future prospects by stating that one is entitled to
certain gains in terms of money in future

due to the

advancement in career. This proposition as propounded by the
MAC APP. 417/2006

page 7 of 13

Tribunal may not hold good in view of the pronouncement of
the decision of the Apex Court in Bijoy Kumar's case
(Supra). Relevant paras of the said judgment are reproduced
as under:
“The mere assertion of the claimants that
the deceased would have earned more than
Rs 8000 to Rs 10,000 per month in the
span of his lifetime cannot be accepted as
legitimate income unless all the relevant
facts are proved by leading cogent and
reliable
evidence
before
MACT.
The
claimants have to prove that the deceased
was in a trade where he would have earned
more from time to time or that he had
special
merits
or
qualifications
or
opportunities which would have led to an
improvement in his income. There is no
evidence produced on record by the
claimants regarding future prospects of
increase of income in the course of
employment or business or profession, as
the case may be.”

In the light of the aforesaid discussion, I feel that in
the absence of any evidence proving the entitlement of the
respondent to grant of any compensation towards future
prospects, the criteria as laid down in Salra Dixit's case
(Supra) cannot be adhered to.
MAC APP. 417/2006

page 8 of 13

The Tribunal has thus wrongly assessed the income
of the deceased by applying the criteria laid down in Sarla
Dixit's case (Supra).

The income of the deceased in the

present case has been assessed at Rs.3100/-p.m. as per the
Minimum Wages Act.

As the respondents/claimants failed to

prove the claimed income of Rs.4,500/- per month by
producing any cogent evidence on record and once the resort
has been made to the Minimum Wages Act, therefore,

the

increase in the future wages under the Minimum Wages Act
can certainly be taken into consideration.

This Court has

already taken a view that the increase under the Minimum
Wages Act which is based on the price index, inflation rate and
other economic factors cannot be treated at par with the future
income of a victim due to promotions, advancement in career,
grant of increments and special grades etc.

Perusal of the

Minimum Wages Act shows that in the past, within a period of
10 years, the minimum wages almost get more than double; for
instance, the minimum wages for a skilled workman in the year

MAC APP. 417/2006

page 9 of 13

1980 were Rs.320/- and the same got increased to Rs.1043/- in
the year 1990, meaning thereby that there has been an increase
of 225% from the year 1980-1990, therefore, it can be safely
assumed that the income of the deceased would have doubled
in the next 10 years. Applying the said criteria, the income of
the deceased as assessed in the year 2001 would have been
increased to Rs.6200/- and taking the average of the same it
would come to Rs.4650/- per month.
The deceased was survived by his widow and three
minor children besides his father, therefore, there is nothing
wrong if the financial dependency of the dependents were
taken as 3/4th

and 1/4th of the income of the deceased is

deducted towards his personal expenses. Making deductions of
the 1/4th income

towards the personal expenses of the

deceased, the financial dependency of the respondents comes to
Rs.3,100/- per month.
The age of the deceased at the relevant time
was 36 years and as per the structured formula of the Second

MAC APP. 417/2006

page 10 of 13

Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, the appropriate multiplier
applicable is 16.
multiplicand

Applying the

said multiplier

with the

as arrived at above, the total compensation

towards financial dependency would come to Rs.5,95,200/-.
The multiplier of 17 as applied by the Tribunal is not correct as
the Tribunal has not given any reason for deviating from the
multiplier as laid down in the Second Schedule as applicable to
the age of the victim in the present case. In this regard the
Hon'ble Apex Court in Abati Bezbaruah v. Dy. Director
General, Geological Survey of India,(2003) 3 SCC 148 ,
has observed as under:“11. It is now a well-settled principle of law that
the payment of compensation on the basis of structured
formula as provided for under the Second Schedule
should not ordinarily be deviated from. Section 168 of
the Motor Vehicles Act lays down the guidelines for
determination of the amount of compensation in terms
of Section 166 thereof. Deviation from the structured
formula, however, as has been held by this Court, may
be resorted to in exceptional cases. Furthermore, the
amount of compensation should be just and fair in the
facts and circumstances of each case.”

Regarding the plea of the counsel for the appellant
claiming interest @5% per annum in place of 8% per annum as

MAC APP. 417/2006

page 11 of 13

awarded by the Tribunal, I do not find that there is any
justification given by the appellant to interfere in the said
interest rate. Even otherwise counsel for the appellant has not
advanced any reason for such variation in the rate of interest
from 8% to 5%. In Susamma Thomas's case (Supra) the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has awarded 9% interest on the award
amount, therefore, the award of interest of 8% in the present
case cannot be considered to be on the higher side.
I also do not find any justification in the reasoning
given by the counsel for the appellant to interfere with the grant
of compensation amount of Rs.40,000/- towards the damages.
In the light of the above discussion, the appellant
shall be liable to pay sum of Rs.6,55,200/-. Vide order dated
17.5.2006, directions were given for release of 75%

of the

award amount to the respondents without any security and the
remaining 25% of the amount was to be released on furnishing
security. In case the 25% of the amount has still not been
released in favour of the respondents then the balance amount

MAC APP. 417/2006

page 12 of 13

in terms of the above discussion shall be released in favour of
the respondents with upto date interest.

In case the entire

award amount has been received by the respondents then the
remaining amount, if any, shall be paid by the respondents to
the appellant.
With these directions appeal stands disposed of
accordingly.
Parties are left to bear their own costs.
