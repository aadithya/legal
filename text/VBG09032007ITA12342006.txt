ITA No.1234/2006

Page 1 of 7

Nos.1231, 1232, 1234 & 1236/2006 filed by the Revenue
are being disposed of.
2.

All these appeals arise out of the consolidated order

dated 9th December, 2005 passed by the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred as Tribunal)

in

ITA No.6331/Del/1996 for the assessment year 1993-94,
ITA No.5423/Del/1997 for the assessment year 1994-95,
ITA No.5293/Del/2004 for the assessment year 1993-94 and
ITA No.5058/Del/1998 for the assessment year 1995-96.
3.

The brief facts are that the Assessee is engaged in the

manufacturing and sale of tin containers. A search and
seizure operation was carried out on 9/10th March, 1995 in
the business premises of the Assessee. Certain documents
were seized and amongst others there was daily production
reports prepared on a printed proforma titled “daily
production report in the Fabrication Department”. As per
the Assessee, these reports are prepared every day after
every shift and it contained the actual number of containers
manufactured. The Assessee was required to produce the
stock register of its unit-II.

The Assessing Officer found

that the production recorded in the stock register was less
ITA No.1234/2006

Page 2 of 7

than the production shown in the production report for the
months of November, 2002, February, 2003 & March,
2003.

He also found that there was no record showing

defective containers and that the containers produced were
shown more according to the production report, whereas
the number of containers produced recorded in the stock
register was less in the subsequent period.

It was also

observed by the Assessing Officer that the claim of
Assessee was not supported by the facts, since the Assessee
was not able to prove it with evidence that the containers
recorded as on a particular date in the stock register as
compared to production report were compensated for on a
subsequent date; that no record was maintained for goods
recorded and not recorded in the stock register; so it was
unverifiable as to the number of containers manufactured
on a particular day, which were defective and as to whether
they were recorded in the stock register at all.

The

Assessing Officer also observed that the work in progress
was reflected in terms of Metric Tonnes, whereas the
containers produced were reflected in terms of number.
Accordingly, the Assessing Officer made the addition of
ITA No.1234/2006

Page 3 of 7

Rs.1,74,58,165/- on account of under statement production
and sale of tin containers.
4.

The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) deleted

the addition made by the Assessing Officer observing, inter
alia, that such addition was mainly based on alleged
difference in the production of containers, while there was
no such difference.
5.

The

Tribunal

agreed

with

the

finding

of

the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and dismissed the
appeal filed by the Revenue.
6.

It has been argued by the learned counsel for the

Revenue that addition was made on the basis of daily
production report seized during the course of search
containing details of containers actually produced by the
Assessee in the specified period of three months, the
details

of

which

could

not

be

reconciled

with

the

production recorded in the stock register for the period
November, 2002, February-March, 2003.

Further, the

work in progress was indicated in the records in terms of
Metric Tonnes whereas, the production of containers was
reflected in terms of numbers, did not support the
ITA No.1234/2006

Page 4 of 7

explanation tendered by the Assessee.

The Assessee did

not produce the production record for the remaining nine
months despite repeated

requirement conveyed by the

Assessing Officer and as such Assessing Officer rightly
invoked the provisions of Section 145(2) of the Act.
7.

The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) deleted

the aforesaid addition observing, inter alia, that such
addition was mainly based on the alleged differences in the
production of containers, while in fact there was no such
differences.
8.

The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal agreed with the

finding of Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) observing
that:“Before us, the learned DR has not been able
to interpret the categories and detailed
findings of fact recorded by the learned
Commissioner(A). These findings have not
been alleged to be erroneous, much less
perverse. Admittedly, there is no evidence on
record to show that there had been any
unaccounted for sales of Tin Containers by
the assessee.
Rather, the assessee had
provided all the requisite details regarding its
production activity.
Undisputedly, the
production was meticulously routed through
the assessee's daily production register. The
entries therein were definitely co-relatable to
the entries in the stock register, enabling an
ITA No.1234/2006

Page 5 of 7

9.

easy stock tally, if one was so required.
However, the AO did not deem it fit to carry
out the exercise of tallying the stock as per
these entries in the two types of books. He
merely went by the alleged difference, which
was not at all there. Very many details with
regard to opening stock of raw-material,
purchases, issue for fabrication, balance, the
various types of containers manufactured,
along with the respective weights thereof,
were duly furnished by the assessee. This
copious evidence, was wrongly ignored by the
AO, which was duly set right by the learned
Commissioner(A).
The
learned
Commissioner(A), on verifying the factual
position, held, and rightly so, that there was
no difference in the recording of the
production of containers in the stock register
and that the AO did not make out any case of
unrecorded sale of containers by the
assessee.”
Since there are concurrent findings of the facts of the

two authorities to this effect that there is no difference in
the recording of the production of the containers in the
stock register, we do not find any reason to differ with the
finding of facts recorded by these authorities.
10.

The above being the position, no fault can be found

with the view taken by the Tribunal.
11.

Thus, the order of the Tribunal does not give rise to a

question of law, much less a substantial question of law, to
fall within the limited purview of Section 260-A of the Act,

ITA No.1234/2006

Page 6 of 7

which is confined to entertaining only such appeal against
the order which involves a substantial question of law.
12.

Accordingly,

the

present

appeals

are,

hereby,

dismissed.
