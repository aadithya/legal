1.

The petitioner seeks the quashing of a letter dated 8.8.2005

issued by the respondent Delhi Development Authority ('DDA') by
which the petitioner was informed that her request for allotment of a
flat with waiver of interest could be considered only if she gave

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 1 of 16

consent for getting it at old cost plus interest plus restoration charges
or current cost whichever is higher. It also challenges a the demand
letter dated 16.3.2006 calling upon her to pay the old cost plus
interest plus restoration charges in the sum of Rs. 25,50,407, for the
allotment of the flat in question.

Background Facts
2.

The facts leading to the filing of the petition are that the

petitioner was registered with the DDA under its Self Finance Scheme
1982 ('SFS'). Initially the registration was in the name of the
petitioner's brother. In the draw held pursuant to the applications
invited in the month of October-November 1987, the allotment did not
mature. Thereafter in 1990, the DDA offered flats in various localities
including Sarita Vihar.

3.

The petitioner states that due to disturbances in Kashmir, she

was forced to shift to Delhi along with her family members.

On

30.5.1991 she applied to the DDA for transferring the registration in
her name. She was informed on 9.8.1991 that the registration stood
transferred in her name.

4.

Towards the end of December, 1992 the DDA announced a

scheme offering ready built flats in Sarita Vihar.

On 8.1.1993 the

petitioner applied for allotment of a flat under this scheme. A draw of

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 2 of 16

lots was held on 23.3.1993. By a letter dated 26.3.1993/31.3.1993 the
DDA informed the petitioner that she has been allotted a ready built
flat in Sarita Vihar in Pocket E, IIIrd floor under Category II and the
net amount payable by the petitioner was Rs.6,19,960.

5.

Contending that the flat in question was a left out flat from

earlier schemes which was offered to Rs.2.65 lacs and that the DDA
was not justified in demand a sum of Rs.6.40 lacs, the petitioner
challenged this demand by filing Writ Petition (C) No. 2995 of 1993 in
this Court. The prayer in the petition was for a direction that the DDA
was not entitled to charge “anything more than actual costs of
construction, or at least the price in which the flats were allotted to
the allottees in the neighbourhood.”

6.

The said writ petition was disposed of on 20.7.2004, i.e. 11

years after the writ petition was filed. The court noted the submission
of learned counsel for the petitioner that “she has instructions not to
press the writ petition on merits provided directions are issued to the
DDA not to charge interest from the petitioner.” In para 10 of the
judgment the Court observed that “since counsel for the petitioner did
not press the petition on merits, I need not adjudicate on the claim of
the petitioner. The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.” The court
was not inclined to entertain the plea for waiver of interest.
Accordingly, the Court concluded the judgment as under:

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 3 of 16

“Since counsel for the petitioner made a
request that interest be waived, which
request has been declined by me, I clarify
that this would not preclude the competent
authority to sympathetically consider,on the
administrative side, request if any made by
the petitioner to waive interest on charge
interest at a lesser rate.”

7.

On the very date of the above judgment, i.e., 20.7.2004, the

petitioner wrote to the DDA seeking waiver of interest. She sent
reminders on 28.3.2005, 28.5.2005 and 15.6.2005. Thereafter, she
received the first impugned letter dated 8.8.2005 stating that her
request would be considered only she agreed to pay old cost plus
interest plus restoration charges or current cost whichever is higher.
She replied on 18.8.2005 agreeing to this request.

8.

Nevertheless, the petitioner then kept writing to the DDA

reiterating her request for waiver of interest. On 16.3.2006 the
petitioner was issued the second impugned letter acceding to her
request for restoration of flat No. 238, Pocket-E, Sarita Vihar subject
to her making payment of Rs.28,50,407 up to 31.5.2006. The letter
also indicated the increased amounts if payment was made beyond
31.5.2006 and up to 31.8.2006. The letter stated that if the payment
was not made by 31.8.2006, the allotment would stand automatically
cancelled.

9.

Since the above amount included the interest amount, the

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 4 of 16

petitioner protested against the said demand by letters dated
4.4.2006 and 21.7.2006. Thereafter, she filed the present writ
petition. By an order dated 28.8.2006 this Court, while directing the
notice to issue to the DDA, restrained the DDA from cancelling the
allotment subject to the petitioner depositing a sum of Rs.17 lakhs.

10.

The case of the respondent in its counter affidavit is that the

Court had already rejected the petitioner's demand for waiver of
interest by the order dated 20.7.2004.

The demand for amounts

stated in the allotment letter dated 16.3.2006 was justified with
reference to the costing policy of the DDA. Essentially on the original
cost of Rs.6,40 less registration money which worked out the
Rs.6,19,960, the DDA has charged interest for the 13 year’s period
from 1.6.1993 to 31.5.2006. It also included the restoration charges
of Rs.20,000.

Submissions of counsel
11.

The submission of Shri R.K. Saini, learned counsel appearing for

the petitioner is that in declining to exercise its discretion to waive
the interest, the DDA has acted arbitrarily. He states that even if the
petitioner's writ petition had earlier been dismissed and the question
of waiver of interest had been left to the DDA, it did not mean that
the DDA should be permitted to earn disproportionate profit to the
extent of Rs.11.50 lakhs.

WP(C) 12752/2006

He relies upon the judgment dated

page no 5 of 16

19.9.2005 of this Court in Writ Petition (C) No. 12517 of 2005 (S.R.

Yadav v. Delhi Development Authority) to contend that interest @
9% was a reasonable rate to be charged. He refers to the judgment
dated 29.1.2002 passed by the Division Bench in LPA No 144 of 1998
(Inder Jeet Vij v. Delhi Development Authority). He submits that
keeping in mind the cost that the State would fetch in the event of the
cancellation of allotment, and if it was allotted to some other person,
the DDA could charge higher than the current cost. Mr. Saini states
that the noting expressed in the Office Order dated 19.4.2002 to the
effect that “if the cancellation took place because the allottee's fault
and if the flat is in South Delhi area, restoration would be on the basis
of old cost plus interest or current cost, whichever is higher,” ought
not to apply since in the instant case the policy that was applied was
that expressed in the Office Order dated 1.6.2000. Referring to the
notes on file, he points out that in respect of similar case of Smt.
Manorama Batra, interest has been charged @ 8% and keeping in
view of the she was a widow, 50% of the penal interest was waived on
compassionate grounds. Finally, he submits that the petitioner should
not be made to pay interest even for the period when the DDA delayed
taking a final decision in the matter.

12. Ms. Amrit Kaur Oberoi, learned counsel for the respondent DDA
has relied upon the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Bareilly Development Authority v. Ajay Pal Singh JT 1989 (1) SC

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 6 of 16

368, a Full Bench decision of this Court in Sheelawanti v. Delhi

Development

Authority

57

(1995)

DLT

801(FB)

and

Delhi

Development Authority v. Ashok Kumar Behl to contend that in
the matter of pricing of flats, the Court will generally did not interfere
unless the pricing will be arbitrary. In Sheelawanti (supra) it was
observed that “merely because the method of valuation suggested by
the petitioners would be more fairer or logical, the method or the
basis adopted by the DDA cannot be struck down as arbitrary or
whimsical.” She relied on the policy dated 19.4.2002 which states that
where the cancellation takes place because of the allottee's fault and
if the flat is in South Delhi area, restoration will be done on the basis
of “old cost plus interest or current cost which ever is higher.” The
contention of the DDA is that since there is no challenge to the policy
dated 19.4.2002, and since the flat is in South Delhi the restoration
has to be on the old cost plus interest which is higher than the current
cost.

DDA's consideration of the petitioner's case
13.

Thanks to the Right to Information Act, 2005, the petitioner has

been able to obtain and place on record the entire file of the DDA in
relation to her case. This gives the complete sequence of notes on the
file of the DDA which deal with the petitioner's request. An internal
note of 19.11.2004 of the DDA, in the petitioner's file, states that “in
case the payment of demanded amount is made latest by 31.12.2004,

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 7 of 16

the

amount

of

interest

against

delayed

payment

would

be

Rs.12,89,517 (for 139 months). In addition to this, the restoration
charges of Rs.20,000 would become payable and the total amount
would be Rs.19,29,477.”

In the same note, it was noticed that

disposal price of the flat proposed to be allotted to the petitioner was
Rs.15,61,625. In para 6 of the note, it is stated as under:
“If the cost demanded in March 2003 under
HIG scheme is considered, there would be
financial implication of Rs.9.41 lacs. If on the
other hand, the cost plus interest as worked
out in para 5 above is considered, the
financial implication would work out to
Rs.13,09,000”

It is stated thereafter that:
“In view of the above details, waiver of
interest is not feasible and also not in the
interest of Department as the capital
investment of Rs.6.20 lacs is blocked from
March, 1993 and we have been maintaining
the flat for about 12 years and incurring
expenditure on watch and ware of the flat. So
far as the question of charging interest at
reduced rates is concerned,
Management
Wing may submit the case to competent
authority keeping in view the fact that the
delay is entirely attributable to the allottee
who litigated matter.”

14.

Thereafter in a note prepared on 22.12.2004 the current cost

was worked out at Rs.15,75,576, and the old cost plus interest was
worked out as Rs.23,57,872. It was opined that given the prevalent
policy, the latter figure which was higher would have to be charged.
It was nevertheless noticed that since the question of reduction of

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 8 of 16

interest rate would have to be considered by the Competent Authority,
the file should be submitted to the Vice Chairman.

15.

In the next note dated 10.1.2005 by the Dealing Assistant, it was

reiterated that since the flat costing Rs.6.20 lakhs had been blocked
from March 1993, and it had to be maintained for about 12 years by
incurring expenditure on watch and ward, the question of charging
interest at reduced rates would not be feasible.

16.

More notes on file followed through March and April, 2005.

Queries raised resulted in the file travelling back and far. In a noting
dated 30.4.2005 it was observed as under:
“the Flat No. E-238 was not put to the draw
held on 28.1.2005 under Festival Housing
Scheme 2004 because no decision about
cancellation of the flat has been taken by the
competent authority so that the said flat was
not considered for allotment under Festival
Housing 2004.
Now it is under consideration and order
whether:1. To treat the flat cancelled and informed to
the allottee to apply for refund of the
registration money or
2.
Flat be offered at old rate + interest as
the current cost comes to Rs.15,75,600 while
old cost + interest charges comes to
Rs.23,57,872 as per report of Finance Wing at
pages 13-14/N + restoration charges.
Submitted for appropriate orders please.”
It thus appears that the DDA itself was not clear whether the flat
WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 9 of 16

already stood cancelled as per the court's order. A decision was taken
on 3.5.2005 that it should be treated as having been cancelled.

17.

The file notes that acknowledge that on 15.6.2005 the petitioner

did write to the Vice Chairman, DDA stating that she was a Kashmiri
migrant widow and that her husband who was a social worker and
journalist had died on 10.2.2005 due to cancer and that she had no
means of livelihood. Thereafter a query was raised about the
“genuineness” of the petitioner. This was confirmed on 20.9.2005.
Finally, on 2.2.2006, the Vice Chairman placed the file before the Lt.
Governor with the following note:
“LG may kindly see the notes on prepages.
In this case, the matter
remained sub-judice for a period of
more than 11 years and was finally
disposed of on 20.7.2004.
Hon'ble
Court has left it to the Competent
Authority for waiver of interest or to
charge on lesser side. Keeping in view
the fact that the applicant is a migrant
and her husband died on 10.2.2005 due
to cancer, a sympathetic view may be
taken for the allotment of flat to her in
accordance with the policy placed
opposite.
Since the matter remained sub-judice
for more than 11 years and even
thereafter, there is a delay or
approximately 1-1/2 years, therefore,
considering
the
total
delay,
the
restoration may kindly be approved.”

The above noting was simply signed by the Lt. Governor on 7.2.2006,

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 10 of 16

indicating that the proposal of the Vice-Chairman was accepted.

18.

It appears from the above note that the Vice Chairman accepted

the recommendation made by the subordinate officers that the policy
of 19.4.2002 should be followed and interest should not be waived.
Thereafter, more notings followed and the second impugned letter
dated 16.3.2006 was issued charging interest up to 31.5.2006 and the
total cost demanded was Rs.28,50,407.

19.

The matter did not stop there. The notes indicate that the Vice

Chairman was again met by the petitioner on 5.4.2006 and it appears
that the Vice Chairman was still willing to reconsider her case for
waiver of interest. Certain queries appear to have been raised on
19.5.2006 whether there was any earlier case where interest in full or
in part had been waived. The Vice Chairman then asked whether in
the petitioner's case also a similar decision could be taken.
Afterwards, the file was again placed before the Vice Chairman who
on 18.7.2006 took the following decision:
“Keeping in view the peculiar circumstances,
the
restoration
was
sympathetically
considered in this case. However, the issue
of waiver of interest as requested, if
considered, would be a departure from the
present practice and would certainly invite
other similarly persons to come forward. In
these circumstances, the request of the
allottee for the waiver of interest cannot be
acceded to.
She may be informed
accordingly.

(Dinesh Rai)
Vice Chairman
18.7.2006”

Is the decision of the VC arbitrary?
20.

There could be no doubt in the present case, the figure of old

cost plus interest is higher than the current cost of the flat. It is true
that this is a matter of policy of the DDA contained in its letter dated
19.4.2002 that has not been challenged per se. Further, the counsel
for the respondent is right in contending that when this Court was
earlier asked to direct DDA to waive interest, it declined, leaving the
decision entirely to the DDA. The scope of the present petition is
therefore narrower than what is projected by the petitioner. On a
perusal of the notes on file, this Court is nor prepared to hold that the
DDA has acted arbitrarily in declining the prayer of the petitioner for
waiver

of

interest.

The

matter

has

indeed

received

careful

consideration at several levels before the final decision was taken.
The explanation for not extending to the petitioner (who it must be
remembered, filed in her writ petition before this Court) the benefit
extended to Mrs. Manorama Batra cannot be termed as either
unreasonable or arbitrary.

Interest for the Period of Delay
21.

The only aspect that Court is prepared to consider is whether

the DDA took an unconscionably long time in the present matter to

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 12 of 16

come to a definite conclusion that it would not be waiving interest and
then charging interest even for the period of protracted consideration.
It must be recalled that this Court dismissed the writ petition on
20.7.2004 and on the very date, the petitioner wrote to the DDA for
waiver of interest.

The notes on file indicates that the matter

remained sub-judice in Court for more than 11 years during which
time cancellation was stayed. As the note at page 38, indicates that
“in view of the disposal of writ petition on 20.7.2004, the power to
restore the allotment vests in VC, DDA as the delay is not more than
three years from the date of judgment. Hence, restoration could be
allowed waiver of interest or give directions to charge interest at the
reduced rate.” The other factor was that the old cost plus interest up
to 31.12.2004 was worked out by the Finance Wing to the extent of
Rs.23.57 lacs while the current cost at that time was Rs.15.75 lacs.
The rate of interest applied on the old cost was 18% per annum
(simple) upto 31.8.2002 and 15% compound thereafter.

22.

The amount already having worked out on 19.11.2004 itself, the

delay thereafter in finalizing the matter appears to be that of the DDA
entirely. Even applying the policy dated 19.4.2002 of the DDA, which
has not been challenged, the petitioner can justifiably be asked to pay
interest only till 31.12.2004. This should be considered to be the
reasonable time by which the DDA was required to take a decision on
the request of the petitioner. However, the petitioner was completely

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 13 of 16

kept in dark about the decision being taken on her request. The file
kept moving up and down for over two years. There appears to have
been a confusion as to whether the allotment had in fact been
cancelled. At one stage it appears that the matter was considered only
under the policy dated 1.6.2000.

It was felt that the powers were

with the VC, DDA as the competent authority to grant the approval of
waiver of interest. However, a query was suddenly raised about the
petitioner's “genuineness”. Even after it was confirmed, the file kept
travelling from one desk to another, without considering the request
for waiver of interest. The query raised by the Commissioner
(Housing) whether in any other similar case, waiver of interest has
been granted was only on 19.5.2006, two months after the demandcum-allotment letter was issued on 16.3.2006.

Thus, when the file

was placed by the Vice Chairman before the Lt. Governor on 2.2.2006
for approval, the question whether the petitioner could be treated on
par with Smt. Manorama Batra was not even considered. This
happened five months later when the file again reached the Vice
Chairman on 18.7.2006, when he took a decision that the petitioner's
“request cannot be acceded to.”

23.

The notes on file indicate that the earlier orders of this Court

directing the petitioner to move the competent authority to consider
the

question

of

waiver

of

interest

actually

did

not

receive

consideration at the hands of the competent authority till 18.7.2006.

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 14 of 16

The notes on file show that this delay beyond the date of the judgment
till 18.7.2006 was entirely that of the DDA's. When the impugned
demand was raised on the petitioner on 16.3.2006, the issue of waiver
interest had actually not been considered by the Vice Chairman or the
LG.

24.

Even accepting that it is entirely in the discretion of the DDA

whether to waive interest or not, and that matter should be governed
only by the policy dated 19.4.2002, the petitioner cannot be penalized
having to pay interest for the period during which DDA delayed taking
a decision. Thus, even if the Court would not like to substitute its
decision for that of the DDA in not agreeing to waive interest, the
Court is inclined to accept the petitioner's plea that she should not be
made to pay interest for the period of the delay.

Directions
25.

As already noticed, as on 22.12.2004, the old cost plus interest

worked out to Rs. 23,57,872 and the current cost was Rs.15.75 lacs.
Accordingly, a direction is issued to the DDA to charge the petitioner
only

the

cost

plus

interest

worked

out

on

22.12.2004,

i.e.

Rs.23,57,872 lacs as indicated in its worksheet prepared way back on
22.12.2004.

The demand letter dated 16.3.2006 would stand

modified and a fresh demand letter will be issued in the sum of Rs.
23,57,872. It is made clear that the DDA will not charge any interest

WP(C) 12752/2006

page no 15 of 16

whatsoever or any amount towards the cost of flat beyond this
amount.

25.

The petitioner has already paid Rs.17 lakhs pursuant to the

order dated 28.8.2006.

The petitioner will now pay the balance

amount of Rs.6,57,872 to the DDA within a period of four weeks from
today and in any event not later than 27.5.2007. Upon the petitioner
completing the documentation or other formalities, the petitioner will
put in possession within a period of four weeks thereafter.

26.

With these directions, this writ petition and the pending

application stand disposed of.
