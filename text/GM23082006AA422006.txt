1.

By this application under Section 11(6)(a) of the Arbitration

and Conciliation Act, 1996, M/s Usha International Limited has
sought appointment of an arbitrator in order to arbitrate upon its
disputes with the United India Insurance Company Limited. The
undisputed facts are that the respondents floated a fidelity

page 1 of 7

guarantee policy to which the applicant subscribed. The same was
given no. 2001/040100/46/01/00283 and was for the period from
1st April, 2001 to 31st March, 2002 for Rs.1 crore covering 1400
employees.
2.

The applicant was constrained to lodge claim no. 46/01/07

with respect to losses suffered by the applicant due to alleged
fraud, misappropriation and embezzlement of its employee Mr.
Pawan Kumar Srivastava in respect of which intimation was
lodged with the respondent by a letter dated 19th July, 2001. The
applicant set up a claim and entitlement of Rs.5,70,692/- The
respondent however sent a cheque for only Rs.1,21,629/- with its
letter dated 10th June, 2004 to the applicant in respect of the loss
suffered on account of the applicant/ employee. The applicant has
disputed the settlement of the claim lodged by it and on account of
refusal of the respondent to comply with the claim and demand
lodged by the petitioner, has sought reference of the dispute to
arbitration. In this behalf, the applicant has placed copy of its
notice dated 26th October, 2004 whereby it called upon the
respondent to appoint one of the arbitrators as suggested by the
applicant in its notice.

There is no dispute that the policy taken out by the

respondent contained an arbitration clause. This arbitration
agreement between the parties reads thus :“Clause 9. If any difference shall arise as
to the quantum to be paid under this policy,
(liability being otherwise admitted) such
difference shall independently of all other
questions be referred to the decision of an
arbitrator, to be appointed in writing by the
parties in difference, or if they cannot agree upon
a single arbitrator to the decision of two
disinterested persons as arbitrators of whom one
shall be appointed in writing by each of the
parties two calender months after having been
required so to do in writing by the other party in
accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration
Act, 1940, as amended from time to time and for
the time being in force. In case either party shall
refuse or fail to, appoint arbitrator within two
calender months after receipt of notice in writing
required an appointment, the other party shall be
at liberty to appoint sole arbitrator; and in case
of disagreement between the arbitrators the
difference shall be referred to the decision of an
umpire who shall have been appointed by them
in writing before entering on the reference and
who shall sit with the arbitrators and preside at
their meetings.
It is clearly agreed and understood that no
difference or dispute shall be referrable to
arbitration as hereinabove provided, if the
Company has disputed or not accepted liability
under or in respect of this policy.
It is hereby expressly stipulated and
declared that it shall be a condition precedent to
any right of action or suit upon this policy that
the award by such arbitrator, arbitrators or
ARB.P. 42/2006

4.

umpire of the amount of the loss on damage shall
be first obtained.
It is also hereby further expressly agreed
and declared that if the Company shall disclaim
liability to the insured for any claim hereunder
and such claim shall not within 12 calender
months from the date of such disclaimer have
been made abandoned and shall not thereafter
be recoverable hereunder.”
As the respondent failed to appoint a sole arbitrator within

60 days of the receipt of the notice, the applicant sent yet another
notice on 15th December, 2004 requesting the respondent to
appoint an arbitrator in terms of the aforenoticed clause 9 of the
agreement. In a reply dated 15th January, 2005, the respondent
refused to appoint the arbitrator contending that there were no
arbitral disputes.
5.

On these facts, the petitioner/applicant filed the present

petition contending that it was constrained to file the present
petition on 12th August, 2005 seeking a reference of the dispute
between the parties regarding its claim of Rs.5,70,692/In answer to the petition, the only ground of opposition is
that the respondent has paid a sum of rs.1,21,629/- to the
applicant. It is contended by the respondent that the cheque for
this amount was accepted in full and final settlement of its entire
claims by the applicant.

6.

Perusal of the arbitration clause shows that it aludes

specifically as a dispute to a difference arising as to the quantum to
be paid under the policy. The applicant has contended that the
respondent admitted its liability inasmuch as it has effected part
payment of Rs.1,21,629/- The arbitration agreement between the
parties is admitted and accepted.

So far as the accord and

satisfaction of the claim of the applicant is concerned, the
applicant has disputed the settlement of the claim.

The

respondent has also not been able to point out any circumstance
wherefrom a conclusion could have been arrived at that the
acceptance by the applicant of the cheque for Rs.1,21,629/- was in
full and final settlement of the entire claim of the applicant.
7.

In this view of the matter, while there is no dispute that there

is an arbitration agreement between the parties, it has to be held
that there is existing and subsisting dispute between the parties
with regard to the quantum to which the applicant is entitled
under the insurance policy in respect of the claim lodged by the
applicant which question requires to be referred to the decision of
the arbitrator.
8.

The respondent has failed to appoint an arbitrator in terms

ARB.P. 42/2006

page 5 of 7

of the arbitration clause despite notices in this behalf and lapse of
statutorily

as

also

the

contractually

prescribed

period.

Undoubtedly, this court would therefore have the jurisdiction to
appoint an arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996.
Accordingly, I hereby appoint Ms. Nandini Sawhney, B-19,
Parwana Apartments, Mayur Vihar, Phase-I, Delhi 110092 (Mobile
No. 9810034205), Advocate as a sole arbitrator to arbitrate on the
disputes which have arisen between the parties in respect of the
quantum of the claim lodged by the applicant on 9th October,
2002 regarding which the applicant had intimated the respondent
vide its letter dated 19th July, 2001. The arbitrator shall be paid a
fees of Rs.40,000/-

In case the arbitration proceedings are

extended beyond ten hearing, the arbitrator shall be entitled to
fees at the rate of Rs.2,000/- per hearing. The arbitrator shall be
entitled to payment of all clerical expenses as well. The fees and
expenses shall be paid in equal shares by both parties.
The parties shall appear before the arbitrator on 16th
September, 2006 when the petitioner shall file its claims.
This application is allowed in the above terms.
