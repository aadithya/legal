VIKRAMAJIT SEN, J.

This Petition has been filed under Section 11 of the

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred
to as A & C Act) praying for the appointment of an
Arbitrator to adjudicate upon disputes that have arisen
between the parties arising out of an Agreement dated
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 1 of 27

21.6.2000 which contains an Arbitration Clause. It inter alia
contemplates that disputes pertaining to 'any notified claim
of the contract included in its Final Bill' shall be referred to
arbitration by a Sole Arbitrator selected by the Contractor
from a panel of three persons nominated by the General
Manager of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL for
brevity).

Although

the Petition

has been strenuously

contested, in its Reply to the Petition the Respondent/IOCL
has already mentioned the names of three persons for
selection as the Sole Arbitrator.

2.

Mr. Kaura, learned counsel for the IOCL has resisted

the reference to arbitration on the ground that it was
imperative for the Petitioner to have notified its claims in
consonance with Section 9 of the Agreement which is the
Arbitration Clause and since this has not been done, no
arbitrable disputes are in existence. Secondly, it is his
argument that the claims which have now been raised stood
settled by application of the principles of accord and
satisfaction, and hence no disputes remain which require
resolution through arbitration. At the very commencement
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 2 of 27

of the hearing it had been conveyed to Mr. Kaura that a
complete answer to these Objections can be found in

Chunni Lal -vs- RPG Home Finance Pvt. Ltd., 134(2006)
DLT 212 in that a definitive decision ought to be directed
by the Court to be taken by the Arbitrator after detailed
discussion.

3.

In Chunni Lal I had arrived at a prima facie

satisfaction

of

the

existence

of

arbitrable

disputes.

Consequently the parties had been referred to arbitration
leaving it open to the Arbitrator to finally rule on this
aspect of the dispute also. The Respondents have stoutly
resisted this understanding of the law, which in my view
has been enunciated by the Seven Judges Bench of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.B.P. and Co. -vs- Patel

Engineering Ltd., AIR 2006 SC 450 : (2005) 8 SCC 618 :
JT 2005 (9) SC 219 : [2005] 128 Comp Cas 465(SC) : 2005
(3) Arb. LR 285. Their Lordships had recorded these twelve
conclusions, of which the fourth is relevant for the present
purposes:
(i) The power exercised by the Chief Justice of the
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 3 of 27

High Court or the Chief Justice of India under
section 11(6) of the Act is not an administrative
power. It is a judicial power.
(ii) The power under section 11(6) of the Act, in its
entirety, could be delegated, by the Chief Justice of
the High Court only to another judge of that court
and by the Chief Justice of India to another judge of
the Supreme Court.
(iii) In case of designation of a judge of the High
Court or of the Supreme Court, the power that is
exercised by the designated judge would be that of
the Chief Justice as conferred by the statute.
(iv) The Chief Justice or the designated judge will
have the right to decide the preliminary aspects as
indicated in the earlier part of this judgment. These
will be, his own jurisdiction, to entertain the
request,

the

existence

of

a

valid

arbitration

agreement, the existence or otherwise of a live
claim, the existence of the condition for the exercise
of his power and on the qualifications of the
arbitrator or arbitrators. The Chief Justice or the
judge designated would be entitled to seek the
opinion of an institution in the matter of nominating
an arbitrator qualified in terms of section 11(8) of
the Act if the need arises but the order appointing
the arbitrator could only be that of the Chief Justice
or the judge designate. (underlining added)

Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 4 of 27

(v) Designation of a district judge as the authority
under section 11(6) of the Act by the Chief Justice
of the High Court is not warranted in the scheme of
the Act.
(vi) Once the matter reaches the arbitral tribunal or
the sole arbitrator, the High Court would not
interfere with orders passed by the arbitrator or the
arbitral tribunal during the course of the arbitration
proceedings and the parties could approach the
court only in terms of section 37 of the Act or in
terms of section 34 of the Act.
(vii) Since an order passed by the Chief Justice of
the High Court or by the designated judge of that
court is a judicial order, an appeal will lie against
that order only under Article 136 of the Constitution
of India to the Supreme Court.
(viii) There can be no appeal against an order of the
Chief Justice of India or a judge of the Supreme
Court designated by him while entertaining an
application under section 11(6) of the Act.
(ix) In a case where an arbitral tribunal has been
constituted by the parties without having recourse
to section 11(6) of the Act, the arbitral tribunal will
have the jurisdiction to decide all matters as
contemplated by section 16 of the Act.
(x) Since all were guided by the decision of this
court in Konkan Railway corporation Ltd. v. Rani

Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 5 of 27

Construction P. Ltd. [2000] 8 SCC 159 and orders
under section 11(6) of the Act have been made
based on the position adopted in that decision, we
clarify that appointments of arbitrators or arbitral
tribunals thus far made, are to be treated as valid,
all objections being left to be decided under section
16 of the Act. As and from this date, the position as
adopted in this judgment will govern even pending
applications under section 11(6) of the Act.
(xi) Where District Judges had been designated by
the Chief Justice of the High Court under section 11
(6) of the Act, the appointment orders thus far made
by them will be treated as valid; but applications, if
any, pending before them as on this date will stand
transferred, to be dealt with by the Chief of the
concerned High Court or a judge of that court
designated by the Chief Justice.
(xii) The decision in Konkan Railway Corporation
Ltd. v. Rani Construction P. Ltd. [2000] 8 SCC 159
is overruled.

4.

The Judgment does not state that a final conclusion

must mandatorily be arrived at by the Judge seized with a
petition under Section 11; on the contrary it postulates a
prima facie satisfaction. This is obvious from a perusal of
the Judgment wherein it has been opined that it was
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 6 of 27

necessary to “decide the question whether the claim was a
dead one; or a long barred claim that was sought to be
resurrected and whether the parties have concluded the
transaction by recording satisfaction of their mutual rights
and obligations or by receiving the final payment without
objection. It may not be possible at that stage, to decide
whether a live claim made, is one which comes within the
purview of the arbitration clause. It will be appropriate
to leave that question to be decided by the arbitral
tribunal on taking evidence, along with the merits of
the

claims

this

power

on

Since
the

Arbitrator, as per Section 16 of the Act, principles of
statutory interpretation ordinarily would commend the
Court from rendering the provision otiose by returning a
definitive pre-decision on this question.

The seven Judge

Bench in Patel Engineering had been constituted to settle
the question of whether the appointment of an Arbitrator
constitutes a ministerial or administrative or adjudicatory
action.

The answer that was given was that the Chief

Justice or his designate is not bereft of judicial powers and
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 7 of 27

that he can adjudicate upon fundamental issues going to
the very root of the existence of an Arbitration Clause or of
an arbitral dispute; that the decision is the outcome of
judicial exercise. The purpose of Section 16 is to clarify that
disputes which pertain to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator
can conveniently and appropriately be decided by the
Arbitrator himself. Their Lordships resoundingly rejected
the argument that the designate appointed by virtue of
Section 11 cannot decide disputed questions including the
existence or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or
whether

the

claim

was

a

dead

one

sought

to

be

resurrected; or whether the parties have concluded the
transaction by recording satisfaction of their mutual rights
and obligations or by receiving the final payment without
objection. The decision in Rodemadan India Limited vs.

International Trade Expo Centre Limited, 2006(2) Arb.LR
83 (SC) is a binding precedent. Justice B.N. Srikrishna had
referred the parties to arbitration, specifically declining to
record evidence on the bidding of the Objector/Respondent
which would have the effect of converting the designate of
the Chief Justice into a trial Court.
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 8 of 27

5.

In Sanjeev Sharma -vs- Gurdeep Singh, 2006 IV AD

(Delhi) 21 my learned Brother, A.K. Sikri, J. had, on being
prima facie satisfied that the Agreement placed on the
record contained an Arbitration Clause, referred the parties
to the arbitration of a retired Additional District Judge,
Delhi, specifically permitting the Respondent to take all
defences available to it with regard to its binding nature or
validity. By doing so the Court does not render itself
'subservient' to the Arbitrator for the simple and obvious
reason that it has considered it expedient not to return a
definite and unequivocal finding on the said issue. The
Court can certainly and indisputably record a final finding
on such aspects, and in that event the power of the
Arbitrator under Section 16 of the Act to arrive at a
contrary

conclusion

stands

foreclosed.

A

harmonious

statutory construction, in consonance with the views
articulated in Patel Engineering, is that the Judge
exercising jurisdiction under Section 11 must be prima
facie satisfied that an Arbitration Clause exists and that
disputes for arbitral adjudication also exist.

If in the

opinion of the Judge it is imperative to consider the matter
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 9 of 27

threadbare

and

to

return

a

definitive,

binding

and

conclusive decision on any jurisdictional aspect, distinct
from an adjudication of the claims sought to be decided
through arbitration, he may do so.

6.

There can be no gainsaying that there is abundant

wisdom in stipulating that certain claims must be notified
before the Contractor can insist that they be referred to
arbitration. Attention has been drawn to the decision dated
6.7.2006 of my learned Brother, A.K. Sikri, J. in M/s. B.K.

Singh & Co. -vs- Dy. General Manager, IOCL, MathuraJalandhar Pipeline Bijwasan, New Delhi on the necessity of
existence of 'notified claims' as the sine qua non for such
claims to be referred to Arbitrator. He had referred to

Uttam

Singh Duggal & Co.(P)

Ltd. -vs- Indian Oil

Corporation Ltd., ILR (1985) II Delhi 131 in which the
Court had not accepted the contention of the Petitioner that
claims had been duly notified. After discussing all the
precedents on the subject Sikri, J. concluded that the claims
raised before him were not arbitrable and were even timebarred, and that the claims raised in that case were not
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 10 of 27

covered by the Arbitration Agreement. It is palpably clear
that correspondence and documents exchanged by the
adversaries had been looked into by the Court to arrive at
the unequivocal conclusion that no claims had been notified
as contemplated by the Arbitration Clause. However, as I
shall discuss in greater detail below, keeping in view the
correspondence exchanged between the parties before me
it is not possible for me to affirmatively come to such a
conclusion. In Suit No. 2399-A of 1985 titled Associated

Hybilds Pvt. Ltd. -vs- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. decided on
15.10.1987 B.N. Kirpal, J., as the learned Chief Justice of
India then was, was called upon to construe an identical
Arbitration Clause. It was noted that the Petitioner had not
recorded any Notified Claims as contemplated by Clause
6.6.1.0., which postulates claims regarding extra work done
or alleged wrongful deductions made; and that admittedly
the Petitioner had not even submitted a Final Bill as
contemplated by Clause 6.6.3.0. A similar conclusion was
arrived at by another Single Bench in Bansal Construction

Co. -vs- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., 1991(2) ALR 409
where the petition under Sections 8 and 20 of the
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 11 of 27

Arbitration Act, 1940 (1940 Act for short) was dismissed. In

International Building and Furnishing Co. (Cal) Pvt. Ltd.
-vs- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., 1995(1) ALR 548 the
Division Bench was also called upon to apply Section 20 of
the Arbitration Act. It was found that no claims had been
notified and hence the petition was dismissed. In Sarup Lal

Singhla -vs- National Fertilizers Ltd., 72(1998) DLT 23 the
Final Bill had been cleared and a No Claim Certificate had
been issued. However, the Plaintiff thereafter claimed
compensation for extra work done on verbal orders. It was
found that Notified Claims were not in existence and hence
the Arbitration Clause could not be invoked. Mr. Kaura has
also relied on the decision in FAO No.54/2004 decided on
27.4.2005

titled

Blue

Star

Limited

-vs-

Indian

Oil

Corporation Ltd.. This, however, militates against the
inflexible stand adopted by him, namely, that it is essential
and mandatory for the Court to invariably return a final
ruling in contradistinction to a prima facie satisfaction,
upon the existence of Notified Claims before parties can be
referred to arbitration.

The challenge in Blue Star

concerned the interim Award passed by the Arbitrator
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 12 of 27

holding that the claims had not been duly notified in
consonance

with the Arbitration Clause. It is also

necessary to underscore the

that

case, since the procedure that commends

is

to

leave this decision to the Arbitrator.

7.

In P.K. Ramaiah & Co. -vs- Chairman and Managing

Director, NTPC, (1994) 1 Scale 1 : 1994 Supp (3) SCC 126
their Lordships were satisfied that there was no existing
arbitrable dispute for reference to the Arbitrator since,
admittedly, full and final satisfaction was acknowledged
by a receipt in writing and the amount was received
unconditionally. In State of Maharashtra -vs- Nav Bharat

Builders, 1994 Supp (3) SCC 83 it was opined that there
was full and final settlement of the claim since the
contractor had acknowledged the receipt of the amount
unconditionally and

had undertaken

to

withdraw

his

claim in the suit in respect of labour escalation.

In

Damodar Valley Corpn. -vs- K.K. Kar, (1974) 1 SCC 141
although payment had been received, the Respondent had
not

given a receipt in

the nature

of

full

and

final

settlement. Both “Russel on Arbitration” and “Mulla's
Indian Contract and Specific Relief Acts” accept that accord
and satisfaction constitutes a good defence to a claim. If
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 14 of 27

this is so, then a detailed hearing, such as in a suit or
before an Arbitrator, would become necessary.

8.

Where there is doubt as to whether accord and

satisfaction has been arrived at by the parties, the legal
nodus should be referred to arbitration as observed by the
Division Bench of this Court in M/s. Navbharat Dal Mills

-vs- Food Corporation of India, AIR 1993 Delhi 87. In
similar vein the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court
has opined, in Union of India -vs- M/s. Ajit Mehta and

Associates, Pune, AIR 1990 Bombay 45, that even where
there has allegedly been a “full and final settlement of the
claim, the arbitration clause in the contract may subsist
where the party invoking it alleges that in fact there was no
accord and satisfaction for some reasons such as the final
bill was submitted or receipt was given under coercion,
mistake or misrepresentation, without prejudice, under
protest etc.
arbitrable

For then that itself becomes a dispute
under

the

clause”.

Similarly,

in

Jiwani

Engineering Works (P) Ltd. -vs- Union of India, AIR 1981
Calcutta 101 it has been noted that very often a 'No Claim
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 15 of 27

Certificate' is demanded before payment is made, and the
claimant should not be shut out or precluded from pleading
to the contrary. Recently, this very question had arisen in

Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. -vs- M/s. Annapurna Construction,
AIR 2003 SC 3660 and their Lordships were of the view
that acceptance of the Final Bill would not foreclose the
raising of Claims unless it could be shown that the
Respondent had unequivocally stated that he would not
raise any further claims; in the absence of such a
declaration the claimant cannot be held to be estopped or
precluded from raising a claim.

9.

The legal phrase 'accord and satisfaction' is an

elementary concept of contract jurisprudence and in this
country is normally discussed under Section 63 of the
Contract Act. It appears to me that the legal progression
and ramifications of a receipt in full and final settlement is
most often glossed over. It is axiomatic that the precursor
of such receipts is the existence of a contract which has
given cause to colliding claims. Take for instance a detailed
contract

for

Arb. P. 37/2005

construction

of

a

building

wherein

all

Page 16 of 27

specifications are spelt out and the consideration is
specifically stated. It is common experience that as work
progresses, changes may be ordered such as the mosaic
flooring mentioned in the contract is required to be
substituted for high-quality marble. If this novation occurs
after the mosaic flooring has been laid, its cost as well as
removal expenses may become difficult to substantiate in
the absence of contemporaneous evidence. The wisdom of
notifying such claim cannot be over-emphasised. However,
the principal may have changed the requirements much
before any work had been carried out by the contractor,
and therefore it would be prudent from his perspective to
insist that he would not be liable to make payment unless a
claim for laying and removing the mosaic is lodged by the
contractor within a stipulated period. Therefore, insistence
on

notifying

claims

contemporaneously

is

indubitably

salutary from all standpoints.

10.

Let us assume that there is no extra, reduced or

defective work. On the completion of the work, the
contractor would become entitled to payment mentioned in
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 17 of 27

the contract and on its receipt the contract would stand
completed, executed, fulfilled and performed. There would
be no scope for using the phrase 'accord and satisfaction' in
such a situation.

However, there may be rival stances

pertaining to extra or reduced work leading to claims above
or

below

the

stipulated

consideration.

By

mutual

negotiations a compromise or settlement may be arrived
at, thus bringing about 'accord and satisfaction'. It will be
obvious that in the latter case the completeness of the
accord

and

satisfaction

can

be

determined

only

on

appreciation of evidence. With rare exception, the Court
would be ill advised to trespass into and transgress upon
the Arbitrators duties in such circumstances. Statutory
compulsions as well as expediency should prompt the Court
to direct the adversaries towards arbitration. The nebulous
and uncertain nature of such events has recently been
cogitated upon

by their Lordships in Bhagwati Prasad

Pawan Kumar -vs- Union of India, (2006) 5 SCC 311, a
perusal whereof fortifies the wisdom of the Court in not
proceeding beyond a prima facie view only.

It will be

advantageous to reproduce the concise and perspicuous

Judgment

of

the

Supreme

Court

in

Bharat

Heavy

Electricals Limited, Ranipur -vs- M/s. Amar Nath Bhan
Prakash, (1982) 1 SCC 625 which reads thus:It appears from the order of the High Court
impugned in the appeal that the High Court has not
correctly appreciated the position that the question
whether there was discharge of the contract by
accord and satisfaction or not, is a dispute arising
out of the contract and is liable to be referred to

the

Indian

Arbitration Act should have been allowed and the
matters in dispute between the parties including
the question whether or not there was discharge of
the contract by accord and satisfaction should have
been referred to arbitration.

We, therefore, set

aside the finding of the High Court that there was
no accord and satisfaction of the contract and direct
that the matters in dispute between the parties
including the question whether or not there was
discharge of the contract by accord and satisfaction
be

referred

to

the

arbitration

of

Mr.

V.S.

Deshpande, retired Chief Justice of the Delhi High
Court, under the arbitration clause contained in the
contract between the parties.

The arbitrator will

make his award within three months from the date

Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 19 of 27

of entering upon the reference. He will first
determine the question whether there was accord
and satisfaction between the parties and/or whether
the contract was discharged and if the decision on
this issue is in favour of the appellant, the
arbitrator will not proceed further in the matter and
dismiss the claim of the respondent. But, if, on the
other hand, he finds that there was no discharge of
the

contract

by

accord

and

satisfaction

or

otherwise, he will proceed to determine the claim of
the respondent against the appellant on merits.
The fees of the arbitrator will be deposited initially,
by the parties in equal shares and the arbitrator
will ultimately decide as to who should bear the
cost of the arbitration. This order will not be
treated as a precedent in case of any other dispute
between the appellant and any other party. There
will be no order as to costs of the appeal.

11.

It

is

essential

for

the

peaceful

and

cohesive

continuance of society that an effective, efficient and
expeditious dispute resolution system should be available.
Arbitration was conceived as one such machinery, but like
Courts, it has been drawn into the morass of procedural
wrangles leading to excruciating delays in the disposal of
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 20 of 27

disputes.

Arbitration has, therefore, substantially lost its

effectiveness partially because of repeated recourse to the
Courts

which

arbitration

was

intended

to

replace.

Experience has shown that when disputes arise the litigant
seeking redress through Civil Courts system is confronted
with stay applications predicated on the alleged existence
of an arbitration agreement. Had such a litigant first
attempted to initiate arbitration, in all likelihood he would
be confronted with the obstacle that an Arbitration Clause
had not been agreed upon by the parties, or that no
arbitrable disputes are in existence etc., etc. Delays occur
because the Respondent always stands to gain by the
deferment of a decision. Jural endeavour should be,
especially in the changed regime of the A & C Act, to
expeditiously direct parties governed by an Arbitration
Clause to proceed to resolve differences through the aegis
of arbitration.

Sufficient safeguard and remedy has been

provided by the A & C Act against legally incorrect orders
passed by Arbitral Tribunals.

has

been

applied

very recently by their Lordships

in

Ambica Construction -vs- Union of India, 2006(4) Arb. LR
288 (SC) by recognising the commercial reality that unless
a Discharge Certificate is given in advance, payment of
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 22 of 27

Bills is generally delayed, if not declined. It was observed
that although Clause 43(2) has been included in the
General Conditions of Contract, the same was intended to
safeguard

as

against

frivolous

claims

after

final

measurement; such a Clause would not be an absolute bar
to a contractor raising claims which are genuine, even after
the submission of such no claim certificate.

13.

On a perusal of the documents

filed in these

proceedings it is not possible for me to unequivocally hold
either that accord or satisfaction had been reached by the
parties, or that the claims mentioned in these proceedings
had not been “notified” by the Petitioner as postulated by
the Agreement. So far as the facts of the present dispute
are concerned the Respondent has itself filed a copy of the
letter dated 14.8.2002 containing the Petitioner's Final Bill
for

Rs.5,75,38,552/-

together

with

the

claims

for

Rs.3,89,97,935/-. Nine pages have, however, not been
enclosed. It is indeed inexplicable why the Respondent has
withheld these pages even though Mr. Kaura has contended
that

the

Petitioner

Arb. P. 37/2005

ought

to

have

filed

complete

Page 23 of 27

communication. The Petitioner has filed Annexure A-1, a
copy of letter dated 5.8.2004, in which it had inter alia been
recorded that it had “submitted claims along with Final Bill
and inspite of repeated requests neither the claims have
been settled nor Final Bill payment has been made”. It was
in these circumstances that by means of the said letter the
Respondent had been called upon to prepare its panel of
three Arbitrators. Annexure-A to the amended Reply filed
on behalf of the Respondent is the Final Bill, containing
abstract sheets 01 to 11. This communication is stated by
Mr. Taneja, learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner, to
have included nine pages apart from those filed by the
Respondent. According to Mr. Taneja these pages contain
the

Notified Claim,

a position

which

has

not

been

controverted by Mr. Kaura. It is only to be expected that
the party who chooses to file a document must not withhold
portions thereof. If it does so an adverse inference should
be drawn against it. If a complete copy is unavailable, its
discovery from the adversary should be applied for. It is no
defence that the complete copy could have been filed by the
opposing party. It has been emphasised by Mr. Taneja that
Arb. P. 37/2005

Page 24 of 27

a perusal of the documents filed by the Respondent can, at
the highest, lead to the inference that the measurements
submitted in the Measurement Book had been accepted by
the Petitioner. Annexure-C to the amended Reply contains
the money receipt which reads thus - “Received sum of
Rs.8208840/- (eighty two lakhs eight thousands eight
hundred forty only) vide Cheque No.CAO 00/86 072163 dt
25/4/03 against our final R/A Bill”. At this stage of the
proceedings there is no substance in the

contention of Mr.

Taneja that this payment reflects agreement viz-a-viz that
Bill alone since claims allegedly raised in the nine pages not
filed by the Respondent had not been adverted to.
Furthermore,

the

letter

(Respondent's

Consultant),

dated

31.1.2003, is of no legal significance since they have not
been vested or reposed with the power to decide on the
validity of claims raised by the Petitioner.

Otherwise,

preparation of panel of arbitrators would be an unnecessary
and futile exercise. These contested questions of fact
should, therefore, be conveniently and correctly decided
only by the Arbitrator after appreciation of evidence

on record.

On

an appreciation

of the

Respondent's defence in these proceedings there appears
to me to be no justification for them to resist the
appointment of an arbitrator, a path which both parties
has agreed to pursue.

It has led to delay, and

to

needlessly exhausting the time of the Court, which is in
scant supply, especially where the Arbitrator is fully
empowered to return each finding that the Court has
been called to rule upon.

14.

I appoint Hon'ble Mr. Justice S.S. Chadha (Retd.)

as the Sole Arbitrator from the panel constituted by the
Respondent

itself.

He

shall determine

his own Fee.

Nothing stated or discussed above shall preclude the
learned Arbitrator from deciding any issue brought into
contention by either of the parties, including the absence
of 'notified claims' and

opinion the detailed arguments that have been addressed

on behalf of the Respondent were unnecessary in view
of the Judgment in Chunni Lal. Hence, the Respondent
is burdened with costs, quantified at Rs.10,000/-.
