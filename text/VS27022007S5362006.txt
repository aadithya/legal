VIPIN SANGHI, J.
1.

This application under Order 12, Rule 6 CPC has been filed by the

plaintiff to seek a partial decree for ejectment of the defendant from
from the suit premises bearing Flat No.B-103 1st Floor, Statesman

CS (OS) 535.06

House, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi-110 001 having a total super
area of 1460 sq. ft.
2.

The said premises were let out to the defendant by the plaintiff

by an unregistered lease and the tenancy commenced from 13.12.01.
The monthly rent was Rs.1,38,700/- calculated @ Rs.95/- per sq. ft. of
super area for the said flat excluding terrace maintenance charges
which were to be paid separately.
3.

The defendant unilaterally sought to reduce the rent after initial

period of three years from Rs.95/- per sq. ft. to Rs.72.85 per sq. ft.
Even on that basis, the monthly rent/damages came to Rs.1,06,361/per month.
4.

The plaintiff sent a notice under Section 106 of Transfer of

Property Act dated 16-01-06 terminating monthly lease of the
defendant w.e.f. close of the tenancy month expiring on 13-02-2006.
Since the defendant did not vacate the premises in question, the
plaintiff filed the present suit for ejectment, mesne profits, pendente
lite and future interest and for recovery of certain amounts.
5.

In its Written Statement, the defendant has admitted the

relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties. They did not
deny that the initial rent was Rs.1,38,700/- (computed @ Rs.95/- per
sq. ft. of super area), which they unilaterally reduced to Rs.1,06,361/(computed @ Rs.72.85/- per sq. ft. of super area) after the initial period

of three years.

Therefore, according to the defendant, the rent is

Rs.1,06,361/-. The defendant in its Written Statement does not deny
receipt of the legal notice under Section 106 of Transfer of Property
Act.
6.

The plaintiff has also filed suit No.535/06 against the defendant

in respect of a different tenancy premises in the same commercial
building. The material facts of both the cases are identical. The only
difference is in the property number, area and the rate of rent.
However, in both the cases the rents were beyond Rs.3,500/- and,
therefore, the tenancies are not protected under the Delhi Rent Control
Act. Both the tenancies were created by unregistered instruments and
were only monthly tenancies, and both were for office/commercial
purposes. Both the tenancies were, therefore, terminable by service of
a notice under Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act and were in fact
terminated by issuance of separate notices dated 16-01-06.
7.

One set of arguments were advanced in the present suit as well

as in suit No.535/06 by both the counsel. I have dealt with, in detail,
with the submissions and the case laws cited by both the sides while
dealing with plaintiff's identical application under Order 12, Rule 6 CPC
being IA No.8256/06 in CS (OS) No.535/06. I do not, therefore, propose
to pass a detailed order in this case and the order passed in IA
No.8256/06 in CS (OS) No.535/06 may be referred to.

8.

I find that in this case the monthly tenancy of the defendant has

been validly terminated by the legal notice dated 16-01-06.

The

defendant has no right to continue to occupy in the tenanted premises.
9.

In the result, I find that the plaintiff has made out a case for grant

of a partial decree for ejectment in his favour and against the
defendant in respect of the tenanted premises.

I allow the present

application with costs of Rs.10,000/- and pass a decree of ejectment
against the defendant from the tenanted premises being commercial
Flat No.B-103 1st Floor, Statesman House, Barakhamba Road, New
Delhi-110 001 having super area of 1460 sq. ft. The defendant should
place the plaintiff in actual physical, vacant and peaceful possession of
the tenanted premises within one month.
10.

Let the matter be listed for framing of issues, on other relief

prayed for in the suit on 09-07-2007.
