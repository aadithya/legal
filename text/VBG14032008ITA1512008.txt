The short question in the present appeal is as to
ITA No.151/2008

Page 1 of 6

whether the Income Tax appellate Tribunal (for short as
„Tribunal‟) was right in deleting addition of Rs.15 lacs
made under Section 68 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for
short as „Act‟) by the Assessing Officer.
Brief facts of the case are that the Assessee filed
return of income for the assessment year 1999-2000 on
27th December, 1999. The assessment order was passed on
22nd March, 2002 under Section 143(3)/147 of the Act and
it was noticed by the Assessing Officer that the Assessee
had shown an advance of Rs.15 lacs from one Bhai Manjeet
Singh.

The Assessee was asked to furnish the details of

this advance.

charges.

Thereafter the Assessee was asked to file confirmation
from Bhai Manjeet Singh, which he failed to do so and
accordingly the Assessing Officer made this addition of
Rs.15 lacs under Section 68 of the Act.
Aggrieved against the order passed by the Assessing

Officer,

the

Assessee

filed

an

appeal

before

the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [for short as CIT(A)]
and the appeal of the Assessee was allowed.
Against the order of CIT(A), the Revenue filed an
appeal before the Tribunal, that is, ITA No.1527/Del/2003
for the assessment year 1999-2000 and the same was
dismissed by the Tribunal, Delhi Bench „E‟ vide the
impugned order.
It has been contended by learned counsel for the
Revenue that despite several opportunities, the Assessee
had failed to file confirmation from Bhai Manjeet Singh
and, therefore, the Assessing Officer was justified in
making addition under Section 68 of the Act.
Section 68 of the Act reads as under:“68. Cash credits
Where any sum is found credited in the books
of an assessee maintained for any previous
year, and the assessee offers no explanation
about the nature and source thereof or the
explanation offered by him is not, in the opinion
of the Assessing Officer, satisfactory, the sum
ITA No.151/2008

Page 3 of 6

so credited may be charged to income-tax as
the income of the assessee of that previous
year.”
According to this Section, any sum found credited in
the books of the Assessee maintained for a previous year
may be charged to income tax as the income of the
Assessee of that previous year, if –
(i)

The Assessee offers no explanation about the
nature of sources of such sum, or

(ii)

The explanation offered by him is, in the
opinion

of

the

Assessing

Officer,

not

satisfactory.
Here, the CIT(A) has deleted the addition of Rs.15
lacs mainly on the ground that this credit balance of Rs.15
lacs is being reflected in the accounts of the Assessee over
the past four to five years or so and hence this was not a
fresh credit entry of the previous year under consideration
and these credit entries were already made and accounted
for in the assessment years 1995-96 and 1997-98 which

ITA No.151/2008

Page 4 of 6

were introduced in the form of advance against breeding
stallions owned by the Assessee and thus these credit
entries did not relate to the year under consideration for
being considered under Section 68 of the Act.
Since it is a finding of fact recorded by the CIT(A)
that this credit balance appearing in the accounts of the
Assessee, does not pertain to the year under consideration,
under these circumstances, the Assessing Officer was not
justified in making the impugned addition under Section 68
of the Act and as such no fault can be found with the order
of the Tribunal which has endorsed the decision of the
CIT(A).
The above being the position, no fault can be found
with the view taken by the Tribunal.
Thus, the order of the Tribunal does not give rise to a
question of law, must less a substantial question of law, to
fall within the limited purview of Section 260-A of the Act,
which is confined to entertaining only such appeals

ITA No.151/2008

against the order which involves a substantial question of
law.
Accordingly, the present appeal filed by the Revenue
is, hereby, dismissed.
