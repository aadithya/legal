1.

The appellant has filed the present appeal against the

judgment dated

2nd July, 1996 passed by Sh.Rakesh

Kapoor, Judge, MACT, Delhi vide which learned Tribunal
awarded a sum of Rs.1,45,000/- as compensation to the
appellant on account of injuries sustained by him in a road
accident.
2.

On 31st May, 1989 at about 7.45 a.m., appellant was

coming towards F-Block, Krishna Nagar, Delhi

and was

sitting on the pillion seat of two wheeler scooter No.DBZ
4675 which was being driven by his son Rajiv Kumar.
When the scooter reached near house No.7/19, Krishna
Nagar, car No.DIA-4117 came from behind at a very fast
speed and struck against the scooter.

upon and directed to report for further check-up. At the
time of the filing of the appeal, he stated that he had spent
a sum of Rs.10,000/- on his treatment, diet and conveyance
charges etc.

In all, appellant claimed Rs.5 lacs as

compensation.

admitted by the respondent No.3. The defence of the car

Page 3 of 8

adequate, present appeal has been filed by the appellant.

No.2, owner of the car died and his legal representatives
have been brought on record.
7.

On 1st February, 2007, none appeared and as such the

matter was renotified for 6th February, 2007.
8.

On 6th February, 2007 again, none was present on

behalf of the appellant as well as the respondents.
9.

The appellant has challenged the impugned judgment

on the grounds that the compensation awarded by the
Tribunal

is

on

much

lower

side

in

respect

of

treatment/purchases of medicines and special diets etc;
that Tribunal failed to take note of future prospects of the
appellant; that Tribunal wrongly disbelieved the receipts
concerning

payments to the Doctors on account of

bandage etc.; that no compensation has been
towards

granted

future treatment to the appellant and lastly the

Tribunal allowed interest @ 6% only which is on much
lower side.
10.

As

per

averments

made

in

the

claim

petition,

appellant was aged about 50 years at the time of accident
FAO No.28/1997

Page 4 of 8

and was earning Rs.1,500/- per month.
11.

On account of treatment/purchase of medicines,

learned Tribunal

has awarded Rs.15,000/- and

the

grievance of the appellant is that this amount is on the
lower side.
12.

According to appellant, he has spent Rs.60,000/- on

treatment, conveyance and special diet and has proved the
bills Ex.PW-2D/1-46 on record.

The Tribunal in its

judgment has considered the expenses incurred with
regard to the treatment of the appellant.
observed by the learned Tribunal

It has been

that the appellant has

placed several receipts regarding purchase of medicines
amounting to Rs.8,000/- in all and has placed on record
three receipts for Rs.2,250/-, Rs.2,700/- and Rs.2,700/- from
Dr.S.C.Roy of Gandhi Nagar for the treatment of left leg
infection bandage.

Appellant has also produced five

receipts of Rs.1,400/- each from Dr.G.S.Kalia of Gandhi
Nagar for doing bandages of infected left leg. It was also
observed by the learned Tribunal that the appellant neither
examined Dr. S.C.Roy nor Dr.Baldev Singh and the
appellant has been able to procure them for filing in the
FAO No.28/1997

Page 5 of 8

Court. Regarding the receipts issued by Dr.S.C.Roy which
are dated 5th February, 1992, 5th August, 1992 and 6th
February, 1993, these have been signed on 6th February,
1993, 5th August, 1992 and 1st July, 1993 respectively. As
such the learned Tribunal was not inclined to accept that
the appellant had actually spent the above amount of
Rs.14,000/-. However, the learned Tribunal held that since
the appellant remained admitted in hospital for different
periods, the

expenses on account of treatment and

purchase of medicines cannot be said to be less than
Rs.15,000/-.

So, the Tribunal

awarded a sum of Rs.

15,000/- to the appellant on account of treatment/purchase
of medicines.

It was also observed that the treatment of

the appellant during his stay in GTB hospital was free of
charge.
13.

In view of the medical bills produced on record and

keeping in view the nature of injuries suffered by the
appellant, the sum of Rs.15,000/- granted to the appellant
on account of treatment and purchase of medicines is quite
reasonable.
14.

The Tribunal also awarded Rs.15,000/- on account of

FAO No.28/1997

Page 6 of 8

pain and agony and this amount has not been challenged by
the appellant.

Further, the Tribunal awarded Rs.5,000/-

towards special diet and Rs.5,000/- towards conveyance.
These amounts are also quite reasonable.
15.

On account of loss of income, Rs.90,000/- has been

granted, which is in my opinion is quite reasonable since
appellant was getting Rs.1,500/- per month and he has
suffered disability to the extent of 40% and remained on
bed till 1994, i.e., for five years. So the appellant has been
duly compensated for the loss of his income.
16.

With regard to future loss, a sum of Rs.15,000/- has

been awarded by the Tribunal and this amount is

quite

reasonable since the appellant had attained the age of
56/57 years when the Tribunal passed the judgment.
17.

Regarding further treatment as claimed by the

appellant, there is nothing on record to show as to what
treatment

appellant has undergone after passing of the

award. Interest awarded @ 6% per annum from the date of
filing of the petition till realisation, is quite reasonable
keeping in view the rate of inflation.

passed by the learned Tribunal and the present appeal is
hereby dismissed.
