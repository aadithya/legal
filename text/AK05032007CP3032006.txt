1.

This order shall dispose of petition under Section 433(e) read with

Section 434 of the Companies Act, 1956 seeking winding up of
respondent, M/s.Doctor Morepen Limited.

2.

The petitioner contended that he is a well known offset printing

press in New Delhi and did printing work for the respondent during the
Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 1 of 16

year 2002-2003.

For the printing done by the petitioner for the

respondent, bills had been raised by the petitioner on the respondent.
According to the petitioner, the amounts of the bills were payable
immediately.

3.

The petitioner averred that respondent initially issued a cheque of

Rs.1.50 lakh against the total due of Rs.17,29,807/- by cheque
no.090543 dated 18th February, 2003. The said cheque was, however,
dishonored with the remark “referred to drawer”.

When this fact was

brought by the petitioner to the notice of the respondent, the cheque was
again deposited but again it got dishonored with the remarks “referred to
drawer”.

4.

For the amounts payable by respondent to the petitioner, by letter

dated 24th January, 2003, it was confirmed that an amount of
Rs.17,29,807/- is due from respondent to the petitioner and it was
assured that the payment shall be made in installments starting from 3 rd
February, 2003 and finishing on 10th March, 2003.

5.

The petitioner also relied on another letter dated 26th March, 2003

stipulating the tentative payment schedule from mid-April to mid-July
Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 2 of 16

2003.

6.

A demand notice dated 10th May, 2003 was raised demanding a

sum of Rs.15,79,807/-. The last payment was made by the respondent to
the petitioner by DD NO.10648 dated 7th March, 2003.

7.

As the respondent had failed to make the payments to the

petitioner a Company Petition No.12 of 2004 was filed by the petitioner
in the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla on 20 th December,
2004 after giving a notice under Section 434 of the Companies Act, 1956
on 28th July, 2003. The notice is alleged to have been sent to the
registered office of the respondent at Parwano and a copy was sent to the
office of the respondent at Delhi.

8.

In the petition filed before the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at

Shimla, an application under Section 10 of the Companies Act, 1956
read with Rules 3 and 31 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 was filed
by the respondent contending that company petition was filed in
violation of Rules 27 and 28 of Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 and as
the registered office of the respondent company is at Delhi, therefore, the
petition in the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla was not
Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 3 of 16

maintainable.

9.

The application of the respondent being 71 of 2005 in Company

Petition No.12 of 2004 in the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla
was allowed holding that the High Court of Himachal Pradesh does not
have territorial jurisdiction and consequently the petitioner withdrew the
petition with liberty to approach the appropriate court for relief by order
dated 14th July, 2005. The petitioner applied for the certified copy of the
order dated 14th July, 2005, which was ready on 25th July, 2005 and was
delivered to the petitioner on 25th July, 2005.

10.

The petitioner thereafter sent a notice dated 19th August, 2006

under Section 434 of the Companies Act, 1956 and has filed the present
petition seeking winding up of the respondent company and for
determination of its assets in accordance with law.

11.

Along with the petition, the petitioner has filed an application

under Section 14 of the Limitation Act read with Section 19 of the
Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 seeking condonation of delay in re-filing
the winding up petition and has sought exclusion of time between 20th
December, 2004 till 14th July, 2005 when the matter was pending before
Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 4 of 16

the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla and the time from 15th
July, 2005 till 27th July, 2005 on the ground that the certified copy was
delivered to the respondent on 27th July, 2005 though the endorsement on
the certified copy reflects that the certified copy was ready on 25 th July,
2005.

12.

I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner in detail who

has also relied on Ajab Enterprises Versus Jayant Vegoiles and
Chemicals Private Limited AIR 1991 Bombay 35, to contend that as the
petitioner was prosecuting with due diligence another company petition
in the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla, therefore, in
computing the period of limitation, the period spent at the Himachal
Pradesh High Court be considered and the application under Section 14
be allowed and the present company petition filed at Delhi be held to be
within time.

13.

Perusal of the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 reflects that

no limitation is provided for filing the Company Petition under Section
433 or 434 of the Companies Act. However, while considering the
application of the creditor for winding up of a company on the ground
that the company is unable to pay its debt what is to be seen whether the
Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 5 of 16

debt claimed by the creditor is within time or not and if the claim of the
debt by the creditor is not within time whether the Company Court
should initiate the process of winding up of company who has declined
to pay a debt which is not within time.

14.

Since no period of limitation is provided in filing the winding up

petition, therefore, the application of the petitioner seeking condonation
of delay in filing the winding up petition after the winding up petition
filed in the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla was returned as
not maintainable, the present petition can be filed by the petitioner.

15.

On consideration of the averments made in the application,

therefore, it appears that the petitioner is claiming that his claim against
the respondent for recovery of Rs.15,79,807/- is within time as the time
has to be excluded during which the petition for winding up was pending
in the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla which is from 20th
December, 2004 to 14th July, 2005.

16.

The petitioner has also sought exclusion of time from 15 th July,

2005 till 25th July, 2005 when the application for certified copy of the
order dated 14th July, 2005 was applied and when it became ready on 25th
Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 6 of 16

July, 2005 and was delivered to the petitioner on 25th July, 2005.

17.

What is excluded under section 14 is the time during which

another civil proceeding was prosecuted with due diligence relating to
the same matter in issue in good faith in a court which, from defect of
jurisdiction or other cause of similar nature became unable to entertain it.
Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 is as under:
14.Exclusion of time of proceeding bona fide in court
without jurisdiction.(1) In computing the period of limitation for any suit the
time during which the plaintiff has been prosecuting with
due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a court of
first instance or of appeal or revision, against the defendant
shall be excluded, where the proceeding relates to the same
matter in issue and is prosecuted in good faith in a court
which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like
nature, is unable to entertain it.
(2) In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the applicant has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in
a court of first instance or of appeal or revision, against the
same party for the same relief shall be excluded, where such
proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a court which,
from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is
unable to entertain it.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in Rule 2 of Order
XXIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the provisions
of sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to a fresh suit instituted on permission granted by the Court under rule 1 of
that Order, where such permission is granted on the ground

Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 7 of 16

that the first suit must fail by reason of a defect in the jurisdiction of the court or other cause of a like nature.
Explanation,--For the purposes of this section,-(a) in excluding the time during which a former civil proceeding was pending, the day on which that proceeding was
instituted and the day on which it ended shall both be
counted;
(b) a plaintiff or an applicant resisting an appeal shall be
deemed to be prosecuting a proceeding;
(c) misjoinder of parties or of causes of action shall be
deemed to be a cause of a like nature with defect of jurisdiction.

18.

One of the conditions required to be satisfied is that the proceed-

ings taken earlier must be of same relief as claimed in the present proceedings as contemplated under Section 14 (2) of the Act. It has already
been held that there is no limitation in filing an application under section
433 of the Companies Act, 1956 provided under the said Act. What is to
be considered is whether the period of limitation to recover the amount
shall be extended by filing a petition under section 433 of the Companies
Act, 1963.

19.

For application of section 14 (1) it is necessary to show that the

civil proceedings which were taken earlier by the petitioner were relating

Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 8 of 16

to the same matter in issue and the said matter was prosecuted in good
faith in a Court which for the defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a
like nature was unable to entertain it. A company petition for winding up
in which ultimately the petitioner may get the amount due to him or
some amount on pro rata basis does not necessarily mean that the matter
in issue will be the same as in a suit for recovery of amount, had it been
filed. In order to ascertain whether the claim of the petitioner is barred by
time or not, what is to be considered is whether the petitioner can institute the suit for recovery of the amount claimed to be due from the respondent to the petitioner.

20.

In Narayan Ambaji Chavan versus Hari Ganesh Navare, AIR 1930

Bombay 505, the High Court had refused to interfere on the ground that
there was another remedy by way of suit in that matter and, therefore, it
was held that in such a matter the condition necessary under section 14
of the Limitation Act, 1963 were not satisfied. In the present matter it is
apparent that two remedies are available to the petitioner. One was to file
a civil suit for recovery of amount allegedly due to the petitioner and the
other to file a winding up petition. No limitation is provided for winding
up petition under section 433 of the Companies Act, 1956 but filing a
winding up petition will not save the limitation for filing the suit in the
Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 9 of 16

facts and circumstances if the claim of the petitioner for recovery has become barred by time. In the present case for the amounts payable by respondent to the petitioner, by letter dated 24th January, 2003, it was confirmed that an amount of Rs.17,29,807/- is due from respondent to the
petitioner and it was assured that the payment shall be made in installments starting from 3rd February, 2003 and finishing on 10th March,
2003. By another letter dated 26th March, 2003 another tentative payment
schedule from mid-April to mid-July 2003 was given. A cheque of
Rs.1.50 lakh against the total due of Rs.17,29,807/- bearing cheque
no.090543 dated 18th February, 2003 was given. The said cheque was,
however, dishonored with the remark “referred to drawer”.

When this

fact was brought by the petitioner to the notice of the respondent, the
cheque was again deposited but again it got dishonored with the remarks
“referred to drawer”. The last payment was made by the respondent to
the petitioner by DD NO.10648 dated 7th March, 2003. Therefore, in
these circumstances the cause of action lastly arose in favor of the petitioner and against the respondent to recover the amount on 7 th March,
2003 and therefore, the suit for recovery of said amount could be filed by
the petitioner till 6th March, 2006. Till this day the suit for recovery of
the said amount has not been filed by the petitioner. Therefore, the claim
of the petitioner to recover the amount due from the respondent has beCompany Petition 303 of 2006

Page 10 of 16

come barred by time. Therefore the time spent by the petitioner in prosecuting company petition can not be excluded while computing the period
of limitation under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963.

21.

The Supreme Court had held in Yeshwant Deorao v. Walchand

Ramchand, 1950 SCR 852 that there can be no exclusion under section
14 of the Limitation Act of time spent in Insolvency proceedings against
the judgment debtor, in computing the period of limitation for executing
a decree against him, as the proceedings are not for obtaining the same
relief. The Apex Court had held as under:
5. ..........................The relief sought in insolvency is obviously different from the relief sought in the execution application. In the former, an adjudication of the debtor as insolvent is sought as preliminary to the vesting of all his estate
and the administration of it by the Official Receiver or the
Official Assignee, as the case may be, for the benefit of all
the creditors; but in the latter, the money due is sought to be
realized for the benefit of the decree-holder alone, by processes like attachment of property and arrest of person. It
may be that ultimately in the insolvency proceedings the decree-holder may be able to realize his debt wholly or in part,
but this is a mere consequence or result. Not only is the relief of a different nature in the two proceedings but the procedure is also widely divergent.

22.

A fortiori the time spent by the petitioner in winding up petition

which is for different relief than seeking the relief of recovery, will not

Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 11 of 16

save the limitation of the petitioner to recover the amount. Winding up
petition is not for recovery of the amount. An adjudication of the debtor
company as unable to pay its debt is sought as preliminary to the vesting
of all his estate and the administration of it by the Official liquidator or
the Official Assignee, as the case may be, for the benefit of all the creditors; but in the suit for recovery, the money due is sought to be recovered
for the benefit of the creditor alone. It may be that ultimately in the winding up proceedings the petitioner may be able to realize his debt wholly
or in part, but this is a mere consequence or result. Not only is the relief
of a different nature in the two proceedings but the procedure is also
widely divergent. The precedent relied on by the Petitioner AIR 1991
Bombay 35, Ajab Enterprises Vs Jayant Vegoils and Chemicals Pvt. Ltd
rather lays down that the time spent in prosecuting winding up petition
against company can not be excluded in computing the period of limitation for the claim of recovery of amount. Consequently the claim of the
petitioner to recover the amount allegedly due from the respondent was
barred on 4th December, 2006 when the present petition for winding up
was filed and consequently the claim of the petition is barred by time.

23.

It has been held in number of cases that an order under Section

433(e) of the Companies Act is discretionary. There must be a debt due
Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 12 of 16

and the company must be unable to pay the same. A debt under this section must be a determined or a definite sum of money payable immediately or at a future date and that the inability referred to in the expression
unable to pay its debts in Section 433(e) of the Companies Act should be
taken in the commercial sense and that the machinery for winding up
will not be allowed to be utilized merely as a means for realizing debts
due from a company. The Bombay High Court has laid down the following principles in Softsule (P) Ltd., Re, (1997) 47 Company Cases 438:
(Comp Cas pp. 443-44)
Firstly, it is well settled that a winding-up petition is not legitimate means of seeking to enforce payment of a debt
which is bona fide disputed by the company. If the debt is
not disputed on some substantial ground, the court/Tribunal
may decide it on the petition and make the order.
Secondly, if the debt is bona fide disputed, there cannot be
neglect to pay within the meaning of Section 433(1)(a) of
the Companies Act, 1956. If there is no neglect, the deeming provision does not come into play and the winding up
on the ground that the company is unable to pay its debts is
not substantiated.
Thirdly, a debt about the liability to pay which at the time of
the service of the insolvency notice, there is a bona fide dispute, is not due within the meaning of Section 434(1)(a) and
non-payment of the amount of such a bona fide disputed
debt cannot be termed as neglect to pay the same so as to incur the liability under Section 433(e) read with Section
434(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956.
Fourthly, one of the considerations in order to determine
whether the company is able to pay its debts or not is
Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 13 of 16

whether the company is able to meet its liabilities as and
when they accrue due. Whether it is commercially solvent
means that the company should be in a position to meet its
liabilities as and when they arise.

24.

The Madras High Court in Tube Investments of India Ltd. v. Rim

and Accessories (P) Ltd, (1993) 3 Company Law Journal 322, (Comp LJ
at p. 326) has evolved the following principles relating to bona fide disputes:
(i) if there is a dispute as regards the payment of the sum
towards the principal, however small that sum may be, a
petition for winding up is not maintainable and the necessary forum for determination of such a dispute existing between parties is a civil court;
(ii) the existence of a dispute with regard to payment of interest cannot at all be construed as existence of a bona fide
dispute relegating the parties to a civil court and in such an
eventuality, the Company Court itself is competent to decide such a dispute in the winding-up proceedings; and
(iii) if there is no bona fide dispute with regard to the sum
payable towards the principal, it is open to the creditor to
resort to both the remedies of filing a civil suit as well as
filing a petition for winding up of the company.

25

The rules as regards the disposal of winding-up petition based on

disputed claims are thus stated by the Apex Court in Madhusudan Gordhandas & Co. v. Madhu Woollen Industries (P) Ltd., (1971) 3 SCC 632.
The Supreme Court has held that if the debt is bona fide disputed and the

Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 14 of 16

defense is a substantial one, the court will not wind up the company. The
principles on which the court acts are:
(i) that the defence of the company is in good faith and one
of substance;
(ii) the defence is likely to succeed in point of law; and
(iii) the company adduces prima facie proof of the facts on
which the defence depends.

26.

Generally speaking, an admission of debt should be available

and/or the defense that has been adopted should appear to the Court not
to be dishonest and/or a moonshine, for proceedings to continue. If there
is insufficient material in favour of the petitioners, such disputes can be
properly adjudicated in a regular civil suit. It is extremely helpful to
draw upon the analogy of a summary suit under Order XXXVII of the
Code of Civil Procedure. If the Company Court reaches the conclusion
that, had it been exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction it would
have granted unconditional leave to defend, it must dismiss the windingup petition.

27.

The claim of the petitioner for recovery of the amount has become

barred by time. If the petitioner files a suit for recovery of the said
amount, the suit will be dismissed as barred by time. If the claim of the
Company Petition 303 of 2006

Page 15 of 16

petitioner to recover the amount has become barred by time, it will not
be appropriate to initiate the process of winding up of the respondent
company. Under section 433(e) of the Companies Act, 1956 the
machinery for winding up can not be allowed to be utilized merely as a
means for realizing debts due from a company which is also barred by
time. Consequently there are no grounds to initiate the winding up
proceedings against the respondent company. The petition, therefore, is
without merit is liable to be dismissed. The petition therefore, is
dismissed.
