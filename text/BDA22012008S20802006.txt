The plaintiff had extended a loan of Rs 25 lacs to the

defendant No.1 pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding entered
into between the plaintiff and the defendant No.2 on 15.01.2003. The
said amount of Rs 25 lacs was paid to the defendant No.1 on 17.01.2003
by way of a cheque which was encashed by the defendant No.1. The
defendant No.2 had stood guarantee for the repayment of the loan and
had issued several cheques in favour of the plaintiff. Those cheques
were taken as guarantee for the loan. There were four such cheques all
of which were returned unpaid by the bank of the defendant No.2 when
the plaintiff presented them for encashment. As a result of these facts
and circumstances, the plaintiff is claiming an amount of Rs 25 lacs by
way of principal towards the recovery of the said amount. The plaintiff is
also claiming interest at the rate of 24% per annum since 17.01.2003
(i.e., the date on which the cheque was issued for disbursement of the
loan) till the filing of the present suit, amounting to Rs 22,25,000/-.
Thus, the total of Rs 45,25,000/- is claimed by the plaintiff. The learned
counsel for the plaintiff states that it was the usual understanding
between the plaintiff and the defendant that the amount financed by the
plaintiff would be returned by the defendant @ 24% interest.
