the

Central

Administrative

Tribunal,

Principal

Bench, New Delhi (The Tribunal) by filing O.A. No. 1867/2005
which has been dismissed on 1.9.2006. It is this order which
impugned before us by the Petitioner.
2. The contention of the Petitioner before the Tribunal was that he
had preferred an appeal against the order of conviction before
the Allahabad High Court. He has been released on bail and
vide order dated 30.4.2005 the Allahabad High Court had stayed
the execution of the sentence in the criminal case. On this basis
it was contended that once the execution of the sentence has
been stayed and the appeal was pending, no action to remove
him should have been taken till such time as the first appeal is
decided. This submission has not been accepted by the Tribunal
and, in our view rightly so.
3. The Respondents rightly pointed out and this argument was
accepted by the Tribunal that merely because the execution of
the sentence had been stayed and the Petitioner has been
released on bail, the same did not amount to his acquittal. He
was, therefore, guilty inter-alia, of being convicted in a criminal
case. As noticed by the Tribunal, the Supreme Court in Deputy

Madras V. S. Nagoor Meera, 1995 (3) SCC 377 has held that

mere suspension of sentence or release on bail by the appellate
court does not render the second proviso to Article 311(2) of
the Constitution inoperative. Action has to be taken under the
said provision after the conviction without waiting for the
conclusion of the appeal/revision or other remedies that may be
available to the concerned employee. Paragraph 9 of the said
judgment of the Apex Court reads as follows:
“The more appropriate course in all such cases
is to take action under clause (a) of the second
proviso to Article 311(2) once a government
servant is convicted of a criminal charge and
not to wait for the appeal or revision, as the
case may be. If, however, the government
servant-accused is acquitted on appeal or
other proceeding, the order can always be
revised and if the government servant is
reinstated, he will be entitled to all the benefits
to which he would have been entitled to had
he continued in service. The other course
suggested, viz., to wait till the appeal, revision
and other remedies are over, would not be
advisable since it would mean continuing in
service a person who has been convicted of a
serious offence by a criminal court.”
4. In view of the aforesaid, the Tribunal rightly held that there was
no merit in the contention of the Petitioner that he could not be
proceeded with under Article 311(2) of the Constitution till his
appeal against his conviction is decided, nor it can be said
that punishment of removal is excessive, disproportionate
or

5. Accordingly, the present petition is dismissed with no order to
costs.
