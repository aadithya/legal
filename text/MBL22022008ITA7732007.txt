After hearing learned counsel for the parties at length, in

our view the following substantial question of law arises:
“Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was correct in
law in holding that assumption of jurisdiction under Section
158 BD of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was not illegal, even
though the mandatory requirement of recording
“satisfaction” to the effect that undisclosed income belonged
to the appellant was patently lacking on the face of record?”
3.

The filing of paper books is dispensed with.

4.

The Revenue is aggrieved by an order dated 15th February,

2007 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Delhi Bench „A‟ in
I.T. (SS) A. No.26/Del/99 relevant for the block period 1st July, 1987 to
20th March, 1996.
5.

A search was conducted on 20th March, 1996 under Section

132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) at various premises belonging
to M/s Elora Mechanical Products (P) Ltd., the office of the Assessee
and the residence of the Directors of the Assessee.

In the search

conducted in the premises of M/s Elora Mechanical Products (P) Ltd.,
various documents relating to the Assessee were found and were
seized.
6.

During the block assessment proceedings pertaining to M/s

Elora Mechanical Products (P) Ltd., the Assessing Officer found some
incriminating documents relating to the Assessee but since he did not
ITA No.773/2007

Page 2 of 10

have jurisdiction in the matter, the Assessing Officer sent a letter dated
6th March, 1998 to the Assessing Officer having jurisdiction over the
Assessee informing him to issue a notice to the Assessee under Section
142(1) of the Act to file its return and to assume jurisdiction of the case.
7.

Subsequently, it appears that an order was passed under

Section 127 of the Act transferring the jurisdiction over the Assessee to
the Assessing Officer of M/s Elora Mechanical Products (P) Ltd.
8.

Thereafter, a notice was issued to the Assessee on 29th

October, 1998 under Section 158-BD of the Act requiring the Assessee
to file its returns for the relevant block period. The Assessee filed its
returns and during the assessment proceedings it raised the contention
that the Assessing Officer did not record his satisfaction to the effect
that proceedings against the Assessee should be initiated under Section
158-BD of the Act. It was submitted that only information was given
to the effect that a notice should be issued to the Assessee under
Section 142(1) of the Act.
9.

The Assessing Officer rejected the objection raised by the

Assessee but did not specifically deal with the contention urged that
satisfaction ought to have been recorded in respect of initiating
proceedings under Section 158-BD of the Act.

10.

In the assessment order this contention raised by the

Assessee has been specifically noted in the following words:
“During the Block Assessments proceedings of M/s Ellora
Mechanical Product (P) Ltd. the assessing officer found
various incriminating documents related to New Delhi Auto
Finance but the jurisdiction on this case was not with JCIT
Spl. Range-15. The A.O. having jurisdiction on the assessing
company vide this office letter 6.3.98 was informed to issue
notice u/s 142(1) to the assessee company to file return and
assume jurisdiction over the case. This case was transferred
to this Range by the Learned CIT II New Delhi vide order
No. 9/98-99 dated 7.10.98.
………….
Assessee Company though its Director Sh. J.B. Aggarwal
challenged the initiation of proceedings u/s 158 BD vide his
letter dated 12.8.99. The assessee company has stated that it
appears that a search was conducted premises of M/s Ellora
Mechanical Product (P) ltd. and with the result of which the
proceedings have been initiated.
The A.O. having
jurisdiction over the assessee who had been subjected to
search must record a note of satisfaction & reasons thereof.”
11.

Feeling aggrieved by the order passed by the Assessing

Officer, the Assessee preferred an appeal before the Tribunal which
unfortunately did not take notice of the substantive contention urged
by the Assessee. In fact, the Tribunal generalized the submission but
even then did not deal with the contention urged. The Tribunal
discussed the matter as follows:
“With regards to the legal grounds taken regarding
assumption of Jurisdiction under sec. 158.BD, the learned
AR Shri Promod kumar contended that as search was
conducted at the premises of M/s Ellora Mechanical
ITA No.773/2007

Page 4 of 10

Product (P) Ltd. and with the result of which the
proceedings have been initiated. The Assessing Officer
having Jurisdiction over the assessee who had been
subjected to search must record a note of satisfaction and
reasons thereof. In the instant case it was submitted that no
such note has been recorded. It was further submitted that
such proceedings have not only to be initiated but also to be
completed within a period of one year when search was
conducted and in any case within a period of one year from
the date of recording the reason of satisfaction. Thirdly, the
jurisdiction over the assessee‟s case lies with ACIT
Company Circle 26(5).
With regard to the legal issue regarding assumption of
jurisdiction under sec. 158-BD, we do not find any merit in
the contention of the learned AR as the Assessing officer
having Jurisdiction over M/s Ellora Mechanical Product
Pvt. Ltd. has intimated to ACIT 26 (5) regarding to take
action in the matter as the jurisdiction lies with ACIT 2(5)
Since the assesse company has never filed any return
therefore the jurisdiction has been transferred to the present
Special Range 15 by the CIT – II New Delhi under sec 127 of
the Income Tax Act 1961 vide order 7.10.98 therefore, the
present Assessing Officer has rightly issued notice under
sec. 158BD of the Act.”
12.

It is in the above circumstances that the Assessee has

preferred this appeal before us under Section 260A of the Act.
13.

Learned counsel for the Assessee has also drawn our

attention to the notice sent to the Assessee on 26th October, 1998. This
notice reads as follows:
“NOTICE UNDER SECTION 158 BC/D OF INCOME TAX
ACT 1961
PAN/GIR NO.
ITA No.773/2007

BLOCK PERIOD: 1.4.85 to 20.3.1996

By Sh. J.B. Aggarwal.”

14.

Reliance was placed by learned counsel for the Assessee on

Manish Maheshwari v. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, [2007]
289 ITR 341 in support of his contention that the Assessing Officer

ITA No.773/2007

Page 6 of 10

must record his satisfaction that undisclosed income has been
unearthed and also in support of his contention that the notice dated
26th October, 1998 issued was completely vague.
15.

It was contended by learned counsel for the Assessee that

the Supreme Court has held in Manish Maheshwari that there are
certain conditions precedent that need to be satisfied before taking
recourse to a block assessment in terms of Section 158BC and Section
158BD of the Act. In para 11 of the Report the Supreme Court observed
as follows:
“Section 158BD, however, provides for taking recourse to
a block assessment in terms of section 158BC in respect of
any other person, the conditions precedent wherefor are :
(i) satisfaction must be recorded by the Assessing Officer
that any undisclosed income belongs to any person, other
than the person with respect to whom search was made
under section 132 of the Act; (ii) the books of account or
other documents or assets seized or requisitioned had
been handed over to the Assessing Officer having
jurisdiction over such other person; and (iii) the Assessing
Officer has proceeded under section 158BC against such
other person.”
16.

It is quite clear from the above passage that the Assessing

Officer must record his satisfaction about the existence of undisclosed
income before proceeding against a person other than the one
searched. No such satisfaction has been recorded in the present case.
On the contrary, the only thing recorded by the Assessing Officer is
ITA No.773/2007

Page 7 of 10

that information was given that a notice should be issued to the
Assessee under Section 142(1) of the Act. This hardly meets with the
first condition precedent given in Manish Maheshwari.
17.

In so far as the vagueness of the notice is concerned, we find

that in Manish Maheshwari the notice issued the Assessee in that case
was more or less similar to the notice dated 26th October, 1998 issued to
the Assessee in the present case. In the case of Manish Maheshwari the
additional fact mentioned in the notice sent to the Assessee was that a
search was conducted in the month of November, 1995. In so far as the
present case is concerned, the Assessee has not been informed when
the search was conducted.
18.

Dealing with the contention regarding the vagueness of the

notice in Manish Maheshwari the Supreme Court held as follows:
“The only question which arises for our consideration is as
to whether the notice dated February 6, 1996, satisfied the
requirements of section 158BD of the Act. The said notice
does not record any satisfaction on the part of the
Assessing Officer. Documents and other assets recovered
during search had not been handed over to the Assessing
Officer having jurisdiction in the matter.
No proceeding under section 158BC had been initiated.
There is, thus, a patent non-application of mind. A
prescribed form had been utilized. Even the status of the
assessee had not been specified. It had only been
mentioned that the search was conducted in the month of
November 1995.
No other information had been
ITA No.773/2007

Page 8 of 10

furnished. The provisions contained in Chapter XIV-B are
drastic in nature. It has draconian consequences. Such a
proceeding can be initiated, it would bear repetition to
state, only if a raid is conducted. When the provisions are
attracted, legal presumptions are raised against the
assessee. The burden shifts on the assessee. Audited
accounts for a period of ten years may have to be
reopened.”
19.

We are of the opinion that the law laid down by the

Supreme Court is clearly applicable to the facts of the present case
regarding issuing of a proper notice to the Assessee for initiating block
assessment proceedings. The notice dated 26th October, 1998 issued to
the Assessee is as vague (if not more) than the notice issued in Manish
Maheshwari. Such a vague notice, as held by the Supreme Court
shows “a patent non-application of mind.”
20.

It has been pointed out by the Supreme Court that the

consequences arising out of invoking the provisions of Chapter XIV-B
of the Act are drastic and draconian. The accounts of the Assessee
may be re-opened for ten years and not only a legal presumption is
raised against the Assessee but the burden shifts on the Assessee to
show that it did not have any undisclosed income.

Under these

circumstances it is quite clear that the Revenue should not exercise its
powers in a mechanical power but should be circumspect while taking

ITA No.773/2007

Page 9 of 10

action under the provisions of Chapter XIV-B of the Act. That has not
happened in so far as the present case is concerned and, therefore, we
have not hesitation in giving a finding in favour of the Assessee.
21.

Learned counsel for the Revenue was unable to show any

judgment of the Supreme Court which has taken a different view from
that taken in Manish Maheshwari and in fact could not press her case
very far in the face of the clear law laid down by the Supreme Court.
22.

Under the circumstances, we have no option but to answer

the substantial question of law in the negative, in favour of the
Assessee and against the Revenue.
23.

The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
