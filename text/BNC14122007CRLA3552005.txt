The facts

leading to

appellants are that one

prosecution of

Thekkat Siddique, a

permanent resident of Calicut, Kerala, was, in the
year 2001 living in Abu Dhabi, UAE and working
as Managing Director of Seven Stars International

Page 4 of 42

Trading Est. Abu Dhabi. Sometime in the second
fortnight of February 2001 he was contacted by a
person introducing himself as Vijay Rathore, later
identified as Virender Pant.

The said Vijay

Rathore represented to him that he was a NRI
based in Hong Kong

and wanted to meet

him(Thekkat Siddique) on his visit to India to have
some business talks.

Vijay Rathore, in this

connection, spoke to Thekkat Siddique on phone
on a number

of occasions.

He left his phone

number also with Thekkat Siddique.
4.

Thekkat Siddique contemplated a visit to
India commencing from 7th March, 2001 onwards.
He accordingly intimated

said Vijay Rathore

about his intended visit. Both agreed to meet in
Delhi on 11th March, 2001 to discuss about some
business propositions. Thekkat Siddique reached
Mumbai on 7th March, 2001 and left for his native
place on the same day. He returned to Mumbai on
9th March, 2001.

Rathore for confirmation of their agreed meeting
and asked him for a contact phone number. He
was told

by Vijay Rathore that on his reaching

Delhi he(Thekkat Siddique) would be received by
one Amar.

On Thekkat Siddique reaching Delhi

on the morning of 11th March, 2001, he was
received by said Amar, later identified as Rakesh
Saraha. Thekkat Siddique was taken by Rakesh
Saraha from the airport

to the ground floor of

premises No.B-66 South Extension Part-II, New
Delhi in a car where he came across with another
person by the name of Vimal, later identified as
Sanjay Khanna @ Chunky.
Chunky ushered

Sanjay Khanna @

Thekkat Siddique into a room

where three other persons were already present.
Those three persons were later identified as
Santosh Shankar Acharya, Jayesh Doshi and Asif
Sheikh. All the persons in the room, brandishing
fire arms told Thekkat Siddique that he had been
abducted.

A tape was put over

the mouth of

Thekkat Siddique in order to gag him.
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

He was

tied too. Thekkat Siddique was informed that he
had been abducted and would be released
after payment of

ransom amount.

Siddique was made to speak

only

Thekkat

to his brother

Ibrahim Thekkat, who was at the relevant time in
Calicut, Kerala, to inform him about his abduction
and

demand for payment

of ransom for his

release from captivity.
5.

Ground floor of premises No.B-66 South
Extension Part-II, New Delhi belonged to one
Satinder Bhatti, who was away from his house on
11th March, 2001.

He, accompanied by some

female friends, returned to his house on 12 th
March, 2001. On his telling that he required the
house for his personal use, the abductors decided
to shift alongwith

Thekkat Siddique to another

premises. Later in the evening Virender Pant @
Vijay Rathore @ Chotu arrived at the

was

physically assaulted and threatened in order to
build up pressure on him to arrange for

the

ransom money at the earliest. He was kept under
constant threat of being killed in the event of
ransom demand being not met.

The initial

ransom demand to the tune of U.S. $ 2 million
was later reduced to U.S. $ 1 million on Thekkat
Siddique repeatedly pleading for the same. At the
asking of his abductors, Thekkat Siddique spoke
to his people on phone to inform them about his
abduction and being kept in captivity for ransom.
This apart, the abductors, themselves contacted
the family members of Thekkat Siddique requiring
them to yield to their ransom demand of U.S. $ 1
million. They were told that one of the fingers of
Thekkat Siddique had already been chopped off
and if ransom amount as demanded would not be
forthcoming

his body would be cut into pieces.

Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 8 of 42

On repeated requests from the family members of
Thekkat Siddique the ransom demand was further
reduced to U.S. $ 7 lacs and finally to Rs.75 lacs.
The abductors gave a Dubai mobile phone number
of some Abdullah to the family members of
Thekkat Siddique asking them to contact him on
the said mobile phone in the event of ranson
money being arranged for delivery.

For the

identification of the receiver of ranson money at
the appointed place the abductors gave the family
members of Thekkat Siddique the number of a five
Dirham Currency note and asked to check the
currency note of that number

with the receiver

before handing over ransom money to him.
6.

On coming to know of abduction of her
husband, in view of phone calls received by her
in that regard, Mst. Rahmath Siddique made a
complaint through Indian Ambassador in Abu
Dhabi UAE in regard

to abduction of her

husband, which was forwarded to the CBI.

With a view to secure release of

from captivity of his abductors, a joint

team of CBI and Special Cell of Delhi Police, on

operation so launched

was resisted by the

abductors by opening fire on the members of the
joint team. The members of joint team reacted by
return of fire and in exchange of fire that thus
ensued three of the abductors namely Virender

We have heard the learned counsel for the
respective appellants as also Shri R.M.Tiwari,
Advocate, appearing for the CBI.

10.

Assailing the impugned conviction and

sentence, Shri R.K.Naseem, learned counsel for
appellant, Rakesh Saraha, contended that Rakesh
Saraha at the time of alleged abduction of Thekkat
Siddique(PW-1) did not play any role of any sort in
abduction

as

such

and

that

being

in

the

employment of Vijay Rathore(since dead) as a
driver, he was simply doing his duty in obedience
to the command from his employer. Referring to
the statement of Shri Bhupesh Gupta(PW-3) son
of

the

landlord

of

the

premises,

Shri

I.C.Gupta(PW-5), learned counsel contended that
the appellant Rakesh Saraha was never seen by
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 12 of 42

him living in the tenanted premises with his coappellants

Vipin

Chaudhary

and

Kartik

Subramanium.
11.

In

his

statement

under

Section

313

Cr.P.C., appellant Rakesh Saraha did admit that
on 11th March, 2001 Thekkat Siddique(PW-11)
was picked up by him on his arrival at Delhi
Airport. In his entire statement under Section 313
Cr.P.C., at no place he states that on that date
and

thereafter

until

rescue

of

Thekkat

Siddique(PW-11) from captivity at 12/22 Sarvpriya
Vihar, New Delhi, he was serving as a driver only
with Vijay Rathore.

He also omitted to produce

any evidence in support of his defence plea in this
regard. No doubt Shri Bhupesh Gupta(PW-3) did
not make mention of name of Rakesh Saraha as
one of the occupants of the premises in question,
omission on his part in this regard does not really
imply that Rakesh Saraha was actually not
sharing the accommodation in question with his
co-appellants,

Vipin

Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Chaudhary

and

Kartik

Page 13 of 42

Subramanium, during the relevant period. It is to
be

noticed

that

Shri

Bhupesh

Gupta(PW-3)

confined his statement to the point of initial letting
only

of

the

premises

to

co-appellant,

Vipin

Chaudhary. From the statement of I.C.Gupta(PW5), it is gathered that appellant Rakesh Saraha
joined his co-appellants Vipin Chaudhary and
Kartik Subramanium to stay on the second floor of
premises No.12/22 Sarvpriya Vihar, New Delhi
after three/four months of creation of the tenancy.
According to Shri I.C.Gupta(PW-5), Rakesh Saraha
was brought to him by his co-appellant Vipin
Chaudhary after about three/four months of
creation of tenancy to inform him that he(Rakesh
Saraha) would also be staying with him in the
rented accommodation. Lest he(PW-5) raise any
objection against stay of Rakesh Saraha in the
rented

accommodation,

co-appellant

Vipin

Chaudhary introduced him to Shri I.C.Gupta(PW5) as his cousin. Later, not only that Shri
I.C.Gupta(PW-5) found Rakesh Saraha present in
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 14 of 42

the rented accommodation whenever he visited it,
Rakesh Saraha even used to come to him at times
to pay rent to him and also visited him once with a
plea for reduction of enhancement of future rent.
If, during the relevant period Rakesh Saraha was
actually living at some other address nothing
prevented him from disclosing that address in the
course of his examination under Section 313
Cr.P.C. He, however, neither disclosed his actual
residential address, if any, other than premises
No.12/22

Sarvpriya

Vihar,

New

Delhi,

nor

produced any evidence to discredit the statement
of Shri I.C.Gupta(PW-5) to the said effect. In view
of Rakesh Saraha being one of the occupants of
the premises

in question where

Thekkat

Siddique(PW-11) was held captive for ransom,
irrespective of nature and extent of role played by
him, his complicity in commission of the crime is
clearly evident and he was, thus, rightly held by
the learned trial court to be a party to the criminal
conspiracy as also an accomplice in committing
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 15 of 42

abduction

of

Thekkat

Siddique(PW-11)

for

ransom.
12.

Shri Mukesh Sharma, learned counsel for

appellant Vipin Chaudhary, contended that the
appellant could not be held to be a party to the
criminal conspiracy and abduction of

Thekkat

Siddique(PW-11) in view of absence of evidence
proving

meeting of mind with his alleged co-

conspirators. It was pointed out that though the
premises in question was taken on rent on 1st
July, 1999, he had left that premises and shifted
to Mumbai in October, 1999.

On the day of

rescue operation, states the appellant in his
statement

under

Section

313

Cr.P.C.,

he

happened to visit his friend at the premises in
question on his return journey to Mumbai from
Bijnaur, UP - his home town.

It was argued by

learned counsel that the appellant was throughout
unarmed and the fact that he had nothing to do
with the abduction and confinement of Thekkat
Siddique(PW-11) is evident from the fact that he
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 16 of 42

and co-appellant Kartik Subramanium had pulled
him back from the line of firing resoted to at the
time of rescue operation.
13.

Second floor of

12/22 Sarvpriya Vihar,

New Delhi, being taken on rent by the appellant
from Shri I.C.Gupta(PW-5) is proved
doubt.

in

of

Ex.PW-3/C executed between present

appellant and the wife of Shri Bhupesh Gupta(PW3) is in regard to fixtures in the leased premises.
Though the appellant in his statement under
Section 313 Cr.P.C. stated that he had come to
visit his friend at the rented accommodation, he
did not name that friend. From the statements of
Bhupesh Gupta(PW-3) and I.C.Gupta(PW-5), it is
established that during the relevant period, apart
from present appellant, second floor of 12/22
Sarvpriya Vihar, New Delhi, was being used by coappellants

Rakesh

Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Saraha

and

Kartik

Page 17 of 42

Subramanium

for

their

residence.

In

the

circumstances, either of them could be that friend
of this appellant who he claims to have had come
to visit. His plea in this regard would, however,
lacks conviction unless he is able to show from
the evidence on record that he had actually shifted
from the rented accommodation to Mumbai in
October, 1999 and had been staying in Mumbai
only eversince. The appellant omitted to disclose
his Mumbai address, if any.

He also did not

produce any evidence in support of his plea that
he had left the rented accommodation in October,
1999 and had shifted to Mumbai thereafter. No
doubt Thekkat Siddique(PW-11) stated that the
present appellant was noticed present only on the
last one or two days, his statement in this regard
cannot be used to lend support to the defence plea
that he was actually not living there and had come
to that place only to see his friend on his way back
to Mumbai from Bijnaur, UP.

His joining the

abductors at a later stage could neither save him
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 18 of 42

from being held as a party to criminal conspiracy
and confinement of Thekkat Siddique(PW-11) for
ransom after abduction, nor that he was actually
not living there and that he happened to be
present there per chance.

There is sufficient

evidence in the nature of statements of Bhupesh
Gupta(PW-3), Smt.Rashmi Gupta(PW-4), and Shri
I.C.Guta(PW-5) coupled with lease papers Ex.PW3/B and PW-3/C, that the place of captivity of
Thekkat Siddique(PW-11) was under his tenancy
and the same continued to be so during the
relevant period as well. His presence at the spot
though at a later stage leads to conclude, in the
absence of any contrary evidence to the effect that
he had shifted in October, 1999 to Mumbai and
had been living there ever since, that he was very
much a party to the criminal conspiracy. Further,
even if his defence plea of having shifted to
Mumbai in October, 1999 is accepted, that by
itself could not be a reason to find him totally
unconnected with the commission of crimes in
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 19 of 42

question. Even while staying in Mumbai, he could
have still been a party to the criminal conspiracy
and his arrest from the place of captivity of
Thekkat Siddique(PW-11) bears testimony to this
fact.

In a closed premises like the 12/22

Sarvpriya

Vihar,

Siddique(PW-11)

New
was

Delhi
held

where

in

Thekkat

captivity

after

abduction and where there were other persons
keeping guard against any attempt on the part of
abducted person to escape therefrom, it was not
necessary that all the members of the group were
to be moving around inside the house carrying
some kind of arms or the other.

Moreover, it

could also be a matter of non-availability of
weapon for every member of the group. Thus,
simply because the appellant was not carrying any
arm it cannot be concluded that he was not a
party to the criminal conspiracy.

As stated by

Thekkat Siddique(PW-11), he was all the time,
during the course of his captivity, being tortured
and threatened by one member of the group or the
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 20 of 42

other. In such a situation, it is difficult to accept
that this appellant could have remained unaware
of the criminal conspiracy and abduction of
Thekkat Siddique (PW-11) for ransom.
14.

For an offence under Section 120-B IPC,

the prosecution need not necessarily prove that
the present appellant, the co-appellants and
others

expressly

agreed

to

abduct

Thekkat

Siddique(PW-11) and keep him in confinement for
ransom -- such an agreement may be proved by
necessary implication.

In the present case,

action/actions of the co-appellants and those
killed in the course of firing by police during
rescue operation would be relevant under Section
10 of the Evidence Act against the present
appellant in concluding that he was also a party to
the agreement to abduct and keep Thekkat
Siddique(PW-11) in confinement for ransom.(see
Mohd.Hussain Maniar & Another Vs. State of
Maharastra, 1987 Crl.L.J. SC 588 and Kehar
Singh & Others Vs. State(Delhi Admn.) AIR
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 21 of 42

1988 SC 1883).
15.

No doubt, Sh. Thekkat Siddique admitted

that Vipin Chaudhary and Kartik Subramanium
had pulled him back into a room when firing
started, he however denied that it was with a view
to save him as he added that he could not expect
such a conduct on their part. Moreover, even if it
be taken

that

the present appellant or co-

appellant Kartik Subramanium did not want him
(PW-11 Thakket Siddique) to be injured or killed
in firing, that in no way works to wipe out their
complicity in being co-conspirators in abduction
and captivity of the victim for ransom.
16.

On the basis of evidence on record, the

present appellant was, thus, rightly held by the
learned

trial court

guilty of conspiracy

and

abduction of Thekkat Siddique(PW-11) for ransom
and there appears no reason to take a different
view.
17.

Like co-appellant Vipin Chaudhary, on

behalf of appellant Kartik Subramanium also, it
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 22 of 42

was argued that he had no connection of any sort
with second floor of premises No.12/22 Sarvpriya
Vihar, New Delhi where Thekkat Siddique(PW-11)
was kept confined for ransom. In this regard, it
was contended that as per lease agreement

question

were

out

to

co-appellant

Vipin

Referring to the statement of

Shri I.C.Guta(PW-5), where he deposed that he
and/or co-appellant Rakesh Saraha used to come
to pay rent to him, it was pointed out that the
witness did not name the present appellant in this
regard in his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C.
to the police and that his contrary statement
before the court was only an improvement to
falsely implicate the appellant. Shri I.C.Guta(PW5), apart from stating that the appellant and/or
Rakesh Saraha used to come to him to pay rent
and

further

that

both

of

them

had

also

approached him with a request for reduction

of

enhancement of future rent, he has also testified
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 23 of 42

that the present appellant had accompanied coappellant Vipin Chaudhary even at the time when
the premises in question were taken on lease and
Vipin Chaudhary had executed the lease papers
Ex.PW-3/B and Ex.PW-3/C. There is statement of
Shri Bhupesh Gupta(PW-3) also to the effect that
apart from accompanying Vipin Chaudhary at the
time of initial letting

of the premises, this

appellant used to bring the cheques for payment
and that he continued to live in the premises
along with co-appellant Vipin Chaudhary until
March, 2001 when this incident had taken place.
In view of the fact that this appellant was arrested
from the rented accommodation along with Vipin
Chaudhary in the course of rescue operation, in
the absence of any plausible explanation for his
presence there at that time, there appears no
reason

to

disbelieve

the

statements

of

Shri

I.C.Guta(PW-5) and Shri Bhupesh Gupta(PW-3) to
find that this appellant was also one of the
occupants of that part of the house.

securing acceptability to his plea that since he
alongwith co-appellant Vipin Chaudhary saved the
life of Thekkat Siddique by pulling him back from

Mr. K.B. Andley, learned Senior counsel

lastly argued that the appellant appeared on the
scene only after

Thekkat Siddique had been

abducted and put in confinement for ransom.
According to him thus, the offence which can be
held to have been committed by him would be
one covered under Section 365 IPC only and he
could not have been held guilty of an offence
punishable under Section 364 A IPC.

In this

connection he referred to a decision of Supreme
Court in Suman Sood @ Kamaljeet Kaur vs.
State of Rajasthan; (2007) 2 Supreme Court
Cases (Cri) 637

and pleaded for conversion of

sentence of imprisonment and fine under Section 364A IPC to Section 365 IPC against the appellant. It is
however to be noticed that even though this appellant
joined his accomplices at a later stage, in view of the
fact that

he alongwith his co-appellants Vipin

Chaudhary and Rakesh Saraha allowed the premises
meant for their residence to be used to hold Thekkat
Siddique after his abduction as captive for ransom

On behalf of Santosh Shankar Acharya,

Mr. Mukesh Kalia, Advocate

contended that

unlike co-appellants Vipin Chaudhary and Kartik
Subramanium, who were

shown to have been

arrested from the place where Thekkat Siddique
was kept in captivity, he was allegedly arrested on
the next day at Mumbai. Mr. Kalia, argued that
the manner of arrest of the appellant itself raises

to his abduction, the prosecution was required to
fix his identity by seeking a test identification
parade in relation to him. It was argued that the
prosecution has failed to prove on record that it
had applied for

appellant's test identification

parade, in the absence of which the complicity of
the appellant in commission of crimes for which
he was found guilty, cannot be held established
beyond doubt.

Thekkat Siddique, PW-11 to enable that witness

pointed out that he had admittedly visited

Thus it is a case where the

refusal on the part of the appellant to participate
in it. In the circumstances, it is not a case where
the prosecution did not seek to get the identity of

In terms of Thekkat Siddique, PW-11's

testimony the appellant remained present on the
scene right from the date of his abduction upto
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 38 of 42

18th March, 2001 and played a leading role in
subjecting him to torture as also extending threat
to him to make him

satisfy their

ransom

demand. Thekkat Siddique, PW-11 was thus in a
position to have had taken a hard and close look
at the

appellant continuously for a period of

about 7 days and was thus unlikely to commit a
mistake in correctly identifying him before the
court.

It cannot be

lost sight of

that Thekkat

Siddique, PW-11 is a person residing and working
in Dubai, UAE. He appears to have had come to
India to visit

his native place and also to make

use of his trip for business purposes. He, in the
absence of any motive which is not reflected from
record, could

have had no reason

to falsely

implicate the appellant by identifying him before
the court

simply at the behest of officials

concerned of CBI. There would thus appear no
reason

to

discard

his

evidence

regarding

identification of the appellant as one of those who
played a role in his abduction and captivity.

find no reason to

arrive at

a finding

different from one recorded by the trial court in
regard to

appellant's conviction under Section

364A IPC read with Section 120-B IPC.
27.

The appellants were charged under six

different heads and convicted and sentenced
separately under each head. Sections 365, 368,
324 and 506 IPC constitute distinct offences.
However, where a conviction and sentence is
recorded under Section 364-A read with Section
120-B

IPC,

no

simultaneous

conviction

and

sentence under Section 365 and 368 IPC would be
justified. The appellants in the present case thus
while being held guilty under Section 120-B IPC
read with Section 364-A and under Section 364-A
IPC read with Section 120-B IPC could not have
also been convicted under Section 365 and 368
IPC as well.

Further, causing hurt or extending

threat to cause death or hurt to an abducted
person is one of the necessary ingredients of an
offence punishable under Section 364-A IPC and
Crl. Appeal No.355/2005

Page 40 of 42

therefore no separate conviction and sentence for
causing hurt or threatening

to cause death or

hurt to Thekkat Siddique, PW-11 could have been
recorded under Section

506 IPC.

From the

statement of Thekkat Siddique, PW-11 though it
appears that he was physically tortured and hurt
was caused to him in the process by some of the
appellants or their accomplices, no medical report
regarding nature of injuries, if any, on his person
could be brought to our notice by learned counsel
for CBI nor there is any mention of the same in
the impugned judgment. Noticeably, the learned
trial court

did not record any finding in the
