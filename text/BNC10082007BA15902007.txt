1.
The
petitioners,

parents-in-law

of

the

deceased, seek pre-arrest bail in a matter relating to

Bail Application No. 1590/2007

Page 1 of 11

death of a bride taking place within three months of
her marriage.
2.

Smt.Indu, 24,was married to the co-accused
son of the petitioners on 21st of April, 2007. She was
allegedly subjected to ill-treatment and harassment
by the petitioners and their co-accused in connection
with a dowry demand to the tune of Rs.10 lacs, which
the parents of the deceased were unable to satisfy.

3.

On 4th of July, 2007, Smt. Jyoti, complainant
sister-in-law (Bhabhi)

of the deceased

wanted to

speak to the deceased on her mobile but could not
succeed inspite of trying repeatedly. She, therefore,
spoke to her husband, Surender, on his phone telling
that she wanted to speak to the deceased.

Co-

accused Surender however, told her that as he was
away from his house

he would, on reaching

the

house, ask the deceased to talk to her. No phone call
was however, received by her from the deceased or
Bail Application No. 1590/2007

Page 2 of 11

her husband, whereupon she spoke to the petitioner
No.1

when he told her that the deceased would be

calling her back after a short while.

But again there

was no response from the other side. At about 4.00
p.m., the petitioner No.1, on being contacted again on
phone, informed the complainant that the deceased
had bolted the door of her room from inside and was
not opening the same. He asked the complainant to
send her husband to their house, whereupon Anand,
brother of deceased, rushed to the petitioners' house
and on reaching there, he found Indu hanging from
the hook of a ceiling fan in her room. The petitioner
No.1 informed the police regarding incident at about
5.45 p.m.

The police, thereafter, reached the spot.

Later, on learning about the incident the father of the
deceased, accompanied by his elder brother, also
reached the petitioners' house.

The statements of

father, uncle and brother(Anand) of the deceased were
Bail Application No. 1590/2007

Page 3 of 11

recorded by the Executive Magistrate, Punjabi Bagh.
In their statements none of the three made any
allegation of ill-treatment and harassment to the
deceased at the hands of the petitioners or their other
family members, in connection with dowry demands.
They rather stated that the deceased was being kept
well by her husband and in-laws and that they were
in no way responsible for her death.

They further

stated that it was rather the deceased
herself

responsible

for

her

death.

In

who was
view

of

statements of the father, uncle and brother of the
deceased making no allegation of ill-treatment and
harassment to the deceased in connection with any
dowry demand or of any foulplay, no FIR was
immediately registered.

It was only on 7 th of July,

2007, on Smt. Jyoti, the sister-in-law(Bhabhi) of the
deceased making her statement before the same very
Executive

Magistrate,

Bail Application No. 1590/2007

levelling

allegations
Page 4 of 11

of

harassment and ill-treatment to the deceased by the
petitioners and their co-accused for dowry demands
that a case FIR No.561/07 under Sections 498A/304-B/34 IPC was registered at PS Nangloi, Delhi.
4.

The mother and younger brother of
deceased

also

got

their

statements

the

recorded

supporting the statements of deceased's sister-inlaw(Bhabhi). Even the elder brother (Anand), whose
statement had been recorded

by the Executive

Magistrate on 4th of July, 2007, in his supplementary
statement changed his stance and made similar
allegations as contained in the statements of his wife
Smt.Jyoti, mother and brother, Navneet.
5.

Learned counsel for the petitioners, heavily
relying upon the statements of the father, uncle and
elder brother(Anand) of the deceased, recorded by the
Executive Magistrate on 4th of July, 2007, sought to
contend that the statement of Smt.Jyoti, sister-in-

Bail Application No. 1590/2007

Page 5 of 11

law(Bhabhi) of the deceased, on the basis of which the
said

FIR

was

registered,

was

nothing

but

an

afterthought with a view to blackmail the petitioners.
Referring to the statement of Smt.Jyoti, he pointed
out

that

the

marital

relationship

between

the

deceased and her husband, for reasons other than
related to dowry demands, were somewhat strained
inasmuch as both of them had not been sharing bed
and

were

rather

sleeping

separately,

which

accounted for frustration on the part of the deceased
and made her to take the extreme step of committing
suicide.
6.

The learned counsel for the petitioners, in
support of his plea for anticipatory bail to the
petitioners, placed his reliance on a decision of the
Karnataka High Court in “R.L.Jalappa Vs. Delhi Police
Establishment”,

IX-1989 (3) Crimes 113, and a

Punjab & Haryana High Court decision in “State of
Bail Application No. 1590/2007

Page 6 of 11

Punjab Vs. Satnam Singh”, I (1997) DMC 637 (DB).
7.

On behalf of the complainant, it was on the
other hand, argued that the Executive Magistrate had
not recorded the statements of the father, uncle and
elder brother of the deceased correctly as he wanted
to shield the petitioners and their co-accused. It was
pointed

out

complainant
Executive

by

the

learned

that

the

petitioner

Magistrate

concerned

counsel
No.1

for

the

and

the

happen

to

be

business partners and it was on account of such
relationship that the statements of said persons were
not correctly recorded and that they were made to
sign their respective statements without the same
being read over to them.
8.

In this connection, it is noteworthy that
Anand,

elder

brother

of

supplementary statement,

the

deceased,

in

his

told that he did

not

mention in his statement to the Executive Magistrate
Bail Application No. 1590/2007

Page 7 of 11

on 4th of July, 2007 about any dowry demand and illtreatment to the deceased by the petitioners and their
co-accused as he did not want the same to come to
the knowledge of his father since he happens to be a
diabetic and heart patient. Thus, so far as Anand is
concerned, he does not disown his statement as such
made before the Executive Magistrate on 4th of July,
2007.

From his statement as well as of his wife

Smt.Jyoti, complainant, it appears as if the father of
the deceased had no knowledge of the alleged dowry
demand

and

ill-treatment

to

the

deceased

in

connection therewith by the petitioners and their coaccused. If that

be the position the father of the

deceased

not

could

have

made

any

statement

different from what he did before the Executive
Magistrate
allegation of

on 4 th of July, 2007.

As far as

business relationship between the

Executive Magistrate
Bail Application No. 1590/2007

and petitioner No.1 are
Page 8 of 11

concerned, a complaint in that

regard is shown to have been made much after the
registration of the said FIR. It may be noticed that on
7th of July, 2007 on Smt.Jyoti, sister-in-law(Bhabhi) of
the deceased making her statement of accusation
against the petitioners and their co-accused, the same
very Executive Magistrate directed registration of the
FIR in question.
9.

Keeping apart rival contentions, there are
certain aspects of the matter which need to be kept in
view in finding if the petitioners would appear to be
totally unconnected with the death of Smt.Indu. The
post-mortem report on the dead body of Smt.Indu was
conducted on 5th of July, 2007 at 10.30 a.m.

The

cause of death was opined to be combined effect of
spinal shock and asphyxia as a result of pressure
over throat structures produced by ligature and the
Bail Application No. 1590/2007

Page 9 of 11

time since death was stated to be 22 hours.

If the

post-mortem report is to be accepted as correct, the
approximate time of death of Smt.Indu would come
around 12.00 noon on 4th of July, 2007. According to
the FIR, based on the statement of Smt.Jyoti, it was
at about 4.00 p.m. only when the petitioner No.1
informed her that the deceased had kept her room
bolted from inside and was not opening the same.
From the supplementary statement of Anand and his
younger brother Navneet, it comes out that when they
reached the petitioners' house and were taken to the
deceased's

room, they did not find the door of the

room bolted from inside as the same opened on just
being pushed a bit. Prima facie, thus the petitioners
and their co-accused would have come to know of
Smt.Indu being dead by hanging much prior to the
deceased's brothers reaching their house.

However,

in spite of the incident being within their knowledge,
Bail Application No. 1590/2007

Page 10 of 11

the information to the police in that regard was
passed on at 5.45 p.m. only.
10.

The photographs of the scene of crime where

the deceased was found hanging would appear to
show that her both the legs were resting on the floor.
The height of the ceiling from the floor level is stated
to be 7' 4'' only. The investigation being underway, it
is for the investigating agency to find if it is really a
case of suicide only.
11.

Viewing the case in the light of the entire

scenario, as noticed above, no case for pre-arrest bail
is made out. Hench, the petition is dismissed.
12.

Observations, if any, occurring herein reckon

only a prima facie view.
