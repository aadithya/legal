2.

The brief facts necessary to decide this present petition are that M/s R.K.

CRL. REV. P. NO. 942 of 2006

1 of 12

Bhandari (Homepath) Private Limited was maintaining a current account with
Vijaya Bank, R.K. Puram. Later on the name of the said company was changed to
M/s R.K.B. Herbals Private Limited(accused no.5, hereafter "A-5"). The case of
the prosecution is that while opening this account, M/s Vijaya Bank, R.K. Puram,
New Delhi, enquired with Indian Overseas Bank, Daryaganj, Delhi which, by letter
dated 13.03.1982 informed the former that there was no objection if current
account of the said company was opened by them provided no credit facilities were
extended to it. A-5 submitted a loan application to M/s Vijaya Bank, R.K. Puram,
New Delhi on 2.02.1987 for obtaining credit facilities to the tune of Rs 204 lakhs.
It was alleged that the Petitioner was the Branch Manager at the R.K. Puram, New
Delhi Branch of Vijaya Bank at the relevant time.

The loan proposal was

favourably recommended and forwarded by him to the Divisional office in Delhi
on 20.02.1987. However, the proposal was deferred by the then Divisional
Manager, Delhi, on account of the company not obtaining opinion of previous
lender(OPL) i.e. M/s Indian Overseas Bank, Daryaganj, Delhi and also because of
an earlier default by Deepak Bhandari, Director of the company in repayment of
loan facility availed earlier from M/s Vijaya Bank. The prosecution alleged that the
petitioner willfully, dishonestly and fraudulently did not obtain the OPL from M/s
Indian Overseas Bank, Daryaganj, Delhi.
3.

The prosecution further alleged that M/s R.K.B. Herbals Limited again

CRL. REV. P. NO. 942 of 2006

2 of 12

submitted a loan application dt. 24.10.1987 through its Managing Director R.K.
Bhandari(since deceased) seeking cash credit limit of Rs. 50 lakhs and bill
purchase limit of Rs 50 lakhs, thus totaling Rs. 1 crore. In the loan application, the
accused persons willfully and dishonestly concealed material facts of having
obtained working capital facilities from M/s Indian Overseas Bank, Daryaganj,
Delhi. The specific allegations against the petitioner were that he prepared the
advance proposal as well as credit report dated 25.10.1987 in which he wilfully,
fraudulently and dishonestly concealed the fact of M/s R.K.B. Herbals Limited
having obtained credit facilities from M/s Indian Overseas Bank, Daryaganj, Delhi
and sent the report to the Zonal office of M/s Vijaya Bank, recommending sanction
of credit facilities applied for by the accused. The petitioner allegedly knew that
M/s R.K.B. Herbals Limited

had availed credit facilities from M/s Indian

Overseas Bank, Daryaganj, Delhi, since he had processed an earlier loan
application dated 02.02.1987. On 27.10.1987, the Executive Director allowed
working Capital to M/s R.K.B. Herbals Limited, on an ad-hoc basis, to the extent
of Rs 20 lakhs by way of OLCC and to the extent of Rs. 45 lakhs for Demand bill
purchase(DBP Limit) subject to canvassing of deposits of Rs 2 crores.
4.

The prosecution further alleged that the petitioner issued letter dated

20.11.1987 to M/s R.K.B. Herbals Limited intimating ad hoc release of credit
facilities without stipulating any terms and conditions.

CRL. REV. P. NO. 942 of 2006

He released the amounts

3 of 12

on 24.11.1987 and 08.01.1988 to M/s R.K.B. Herbals Ltd. On the basis of a letter
dated 29.04.1988, the Divisional Manager, due to his representations
recommended sanction of limit of M/s R.K.B. Herbals Limited to the AGM. On
09.05.1988 the regular sanction of the limit of Rs 50 lakhs each under OLCC and
DBP was granted to M/s R.K.B. Herbals Limited by the Chairman of M/s Vijaya
Bank.
5.

The loan became overdue; further credit was given, to retrieve the

advances. However, the borrower defaulted. The prosecution alleged, in the
charge sheet that there were over 19 instances between 17.12.1987 to 30.06.1989
when the petitioner allowed withdrawals from the OLCC account for amounts
varying between Rupees four lakhs to Rs. 25 lakhs, that were much beyond the
sanction limit and drawing powers in gross violation of instructions of the bank,
without even informing, or obtaining approval from, higher authorities. While
operating documentary bills purchase account, the petitioner purchased 130
documentary bills for the period from 08.01.1988 to 01.12.1988 to the tune of Rs.
154.80 lakhs, out of which only 62 bills amounting to Rs. 75.04 lakhs were
realized and remaining 68 bills valuing Rs 79.76 lakhs were returned unpaid.
Further, he petitioner furnished incorrect and misleading information to the Delhi
Divisional Office of M/s Vijaya Bank regarding realization of discounted
documentary bills on the basis of which the latter was induced to make favourable

CRL. REV. P. NO. 942 of 2006

4 of 12

recommendations for regular sanction of credit facilities to M/s R.K.B. Herbals
Ltd. Further, despite specific instructions from the Divisional Manager of M/s
Vijaya Bank not to purchase further bills until overdue bills were realized, the
petitioner continued to purchase documentary bills of M/s R.K.B. Herbals Limited.
It was alleged that the petitioner failed to regulate the end-use of funds and caused
undue favour to M/s R.K.B. Herbals Limited by allowing them heavy cash
withdrawals on over 110 occasions from the OLCC account.
6.

The prosecution further stated in the charge sheet, that on one occasion, a

sum of Rs. 2.61 lakhs was released by the petitioner at the instance of M/s R.K.B.
Herbals Limited to M/s All India General Freight Carriers as advance freight by
debiting OLCC account of the firm for re-booking of goods when in fact there was
actual re-booking of goods.
7.

Mr. Sudheer, learned counsel argued the allegation of availing of credit

facility by M/s R.K.B. Herbals Limited with its Directors from Indian Overseas
Bank, Darya Ganj, Delhi, was not a misconduct under Section 13, of the
Prevention of Corruption Act, as it was within the knowledge of the then
Divisional Manager Sh. A.B.S. Shetty, a named accused in the FIR which is
reflected from the statement of the Public Witness. Learned counsel further urged
that petitioner’s role was limited to releasing the loan directed by the higher
authorities, as it was sanctioned by the Executive Director/ Chairman & Managing

CRL. REV. P. NO. 942 of 2006

5 of 12

Director on the recommendations of the Divisional Head.
8.

Counsel further contended that the petitioner had the stock of M/s R.K.B.

Herbals Limited verified, before forwarding the loan proposal. Counsel urged that
the bills of M/s R.K.B. Herbals Ltd. were purchased by other officers and not the
petitioner, which is reflected from the fact that they are signed by other officers as
well. Learned counsel further argued that the loan application dated 20.02.1987 of
the Company was for the Homeopath Division and herbal division for Rs. 2 crores
of which the proposal was deferred by the Bank. The later proposal submitted by
the company on 24.10.1987 was for a completely separate unit to be set up in
Himachal Pradesh, for which no prior credit facility had been availed from any
bank including Indian Overseas Bank.
9.

Learned counsel for the petitioner urged that the FIR leading to the framing

of impugned charges was filed as the Recovery Suit against the Company did not
yield results. He contended that the petitioner was needlessly implicated, to present
a scapegoat. It was also submitted that during the course of the investigation, the
CBI had twice searched and raided the petitioner’s residential premises. On both
occasions, no incriminating evidence were found. The Petitioner had not secured
any unlawful advantage for himself; thus, no offence under Section 5(i)(d) of the
Prevention of Corruption Act,1947 or Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 was made out.

10.

Counsel for the petitioner next urged that the entire transaction is purely of

civil nature and no element of criminality was involved. In the light of the
compromise arrived at between the Bank and the Company before the Debt
Recovery Tribunal wherein the Company has paid a sum of Rs. 1,30,00,000/towards full and final settlement and the Bank issued a “NO DUE
CERTIFICATE” to the company, no useful purpose would be served in framing
charges. Reliance was placed on the decision reported as Naresh Chandra & Anr.
v CBI ( Cr. MC 945/2002 decided on 18-9-2003 by this court) and K. Prabhakar
Hegde v State & Ors. ( Cr. MC. 4486/2003, decided on 27-4-2005, by this court).
It was lastly urged that this court was in WP(C)No.1326/2003, after considering all
the facts and circumstances including the fact that other co-accused/borrowers had
settled with the bank, directed the latter to release retirement benefits and other
payments due to the petitioner, after his superannuation. In these circumstances, it
would not be appropriate to ask him to stand trial.
11.

The materials on record, mentioned in the charge-sheet reveal that
(1)

The proposal and credit report by the petitioner (D-4 and D-5) did

not mention about the previous credit facilities of A-5;
(2)

The petitioner informed on 22.04.88 (D-16) that eleven bills were

purchased from January to March, 1988, but none was returned unpaid,
which was allegedly false and misleading. This led to regular sanction of

CRL. REV. P. NO. 942 of 2006

7 of 12

facilities.
(3)

According to the statement of accused (D-142) the petitioner

permitted overdrawings to accused Nos. 2 to 5 on several occasions.
(4)

The petitioner produced various bills drawn by A-2, as Director of

A-5 of which 34 were received back unpaid, as per the register of bills D139. This resulted in wrongful loss to the Vijaya Bank.
(5)

The petitioner permitted cash withdrawals totalling of over Rs.55

lakhs 110 times.
(6)

57 drawee bills amounting to Rs. 43.45 lakhs, were outstanding due

to the non-retirement of bills by A-5.

These were discounted by the

petitioner.
12.

The arguments made on behalf of the petitioner that he did not conceal any

fact nor did he misrepresent the true facts a fresh proposal was made by M/s RKB
Herbals Pvt. Ltd. and that eventually the loan was sanctioned by the higher
authorities, in my opinion is simplistic. When the original proposal was made,
there was a disclosure that the company was

engaged in manufacture of

homeopathic medicines. However, the proposal did not materialise. The later
proposal was silent as regards the outstandings of the company. The plea that the
herbal unit was different, at this stage, cannot be countenanced, because both the
homeopathic and herbal unit were floated by the same corporate entity. At the

CRL. REV. P. NO. 942 of 2006

8 of 12

relevant time it owed substantial monies to the Indian Overseas Bank besides the
Himachal Pradesh Financial Corporation and Himachal Pradesh State Industries
Development Corporation. That part, the manner in which the facilities were
permitted to be operated and the facts presented to the higher authorities were
such that co-accused A-2 to A-5, could avail of credit facilities which were
subsequently enhanced.
13.

According to the charge sheet the petitioner accepted several lorry receipts,

in these transactions which were not IBA approved transporters. These lorry
receipts were accepted in violation of the terms of sanction; only 5 bills for Rs. 4.1
lakhs (out of a total 38.77 lakhs) were realised. The remaining were returned
unpaid. The allegations against the petitioner further are that he continued to
purchase documentary bills of M/s RKP Herbals Pvt. Ltd. despite specific
instructions to the contrary and that no such purchasers should be made plea
overdue bills were released. The allegation is also the petitioner failed to regulate
the end use of funds to the tune of Rs. 55.93 lakhs.

14.

As regards the order for release of retiral benefit of the petitioner, I am of

the opinion that this aspect is irrelevant.

Like the settlement between the

borrower/accused and the bank, that is extraneous factor as far as the alleged
commission of the offences are concerned. The Supreme Court held that such

CRL. REV. P. NO. 942 of 2006

9 of 12

settlement of civil disputes should not influence the court seized of criminal
proceedings, in the judgment reported as Inspector of Police, CBI Vs. Rajagopal
JT 2002 (2) SC 331.

15.

I have carefully examined the submissions of the parties. The contention

that the petitioner cannot be made scapegoat for the sanction of the loan which
turned sticky in my opinion wears thin. This is because the proposal that was
eventually cleared by the headquarter was premised on recommendations made by
him. In those the actual track record of the borrowers had not been revealed. Even
if the argument that after review of all credit facilities, the headquarter
nevertheless proceeded to sanction higher amounts for the movement they
accepted the conduct of the petitioner in discounting 57 drawee bills for the same
43.45 lakhs during 1989-90 which remained outstanding as a result of nonretirement of the bills, shows his serious involvement. In fact there are materials
to show that right from the inception the petitioner had been, despite instructions
extending facilities. He even wrote letters to the higher authorities confirming that
no bills had been returned unpaid, on account of documentary bills, whereas there
was material to the contrary. The court cannot undertake a meticulous and detailed
scrutiny of the material,or the exercise would run the danger of a pre-trial
examination of the case on merits; an action cautioned against by the Supreme

CRL. REV. P. NO. 942 of 2006

10 of 12

Court in State of MP-vs-S.B. Johari 2000-(106)-CRLJ -0944 -SC, in the following terms:

"In our view the aforesaid exercise of appreciating the materials
produced by the prosecution at the stage of framing of the charge is
wholly unjustified. The entire approach of the High Court appears
to be as if the Court was deciding the case as to whether accused
are guilty or not. It was done without considering the allegations of
conspiracy relating to the charge under S. 120-B. In most of the
cases, it is only from the available circumstantial evidence an
inference of conspiracy is to be drawn. Further, the High Court
failed to consider that medicines are normally sold at a fixed price
and in any set of circumstances, it was for the prosecution to lead."

16.

On an overall conspectus of all the facts I am of the view that the opinion

formed by the special Judge which led to the impugned order and charges being
framed against the petitioner, cannot be characterized as illegal or contrary to the
materials on record.

It cannot be said, at this stage, that the conduct and

involvement of the petitioner would not amount to grave suspicion of his having
committed the offences charged with. At the stage of framing charges the court
has to, on the broad probabilities, drawn from the materials made available to it,
infer whether prima facie grave suspicion exists about the involvement of the
concerned accused. Such evidence sifting exercise should not be meticulous and
detailed. The trial court therefore did not commit any error of law warranting
exercise of jurisdiction.
17.

For the above reasons, this petition has to fail. The petition is accordingly
