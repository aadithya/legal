1.

This petition has been filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration and

Conciliation Act, 1996 challenging the Award dated 10.12.2004.

The

respondent/ claimant has raised the preliminary objection to this petition on the
ground that the same is beyond time prescribed under Section 34(3) of the said
Act.

2.

I have heard the counsel for the parties. The Award was published

on 10.12.2004.

Objections were initially filed before the District Judge on 07.03.2005 and the
same were withdrawn on 02.08.2006 and the present petition was filed on
28.09.2006. Under Section 34(3) of the said Act, an initial period of three
months is prescribed for filing a petition challenging the Award. The clock
starts from the date on which the aggrieved party receives the copy of the
Award. The proviso permits a further extension of the period by 30 days but
not thereafter. Accordingly, a period of 120 days in the maximum is provided
for filing a petition under Section 34 of the said Act. Admittedly, the present
petition, even if the period from 07.03.2005 to 02.08.2006 is excluded in view
of the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, the petition would
be beyond the prescribed maximum period. In view of the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v. Popular Construction
Company: (2001) 8 SCC 470, there is no discretion left with the Court for
extending the period of limitation beyond what is stipulated in the proviso to
Section 34 (3) of the said Act.

3.

Accordingly, this petition is barred by time. The same is dismissed

as such.
