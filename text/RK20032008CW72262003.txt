REVA KHETRAPAL, J.

1.

The aforesaid three writ petitions, which are proposed to be disposed of by

this common judgment, are directed against the non-allotment of flats to the
petitioners by the respondent No.3 Society and seek quashing of order dated
19.09.2003 passed by the respondent No.2, the Joint Registrar of Delhi
Cooperative Societies.
2.

Since almost similar facts with some variations in the amounts paid to the

respondent No.3 Society and the dates thereof have led to the filing of the writ
petitions and the relief prayed for is also similar, it is proposed to set out the facts
as narrated in W.P.(C) No.7226/2003 Smt. Alka Gupta vs. The Registrar,
Cooperative Societies and Anr.
3.

The factual matrix leading to the filing of the aforesaid writ petition is as

follows.
4.

The respondent No.3 is a Cooperative Group Housing Society registered

under the Delhi Cooperative Societies Act, 1972 vide registration No.498 GH.
The petitioner who claims to be a regular and bonafide member of the respondent
No.3 Society was issued a share certificate by the respondent No.3 after receiving
the membership fee and share money in accordance with the rules as a member of
the Society and as per her entitlement, the petitioner is entitled to the allotment of
a three bed room HIG flat in category B. It is an undisputed fact that from
15.01.1989 to 09.09.2000, the petitioner paid various amounts to the respondent
No.3 and that in all she has paid Rs.6 lakhs towards her contribution for the
W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 2 of 17

construction of the flat being claimed by her. The share certificate issued to her,
certain copies of letters including the demand letters sent by the respondent No.3
Society to the petitioner and receipts issued to the petitioner are annexed with the
petition as Annexure-1 and Annexure-2 (collectively). The petitioner had also
applied for a loan from the Life Insurance Corporation Housing Finance Ltd. and
on the request of the petitioner, the respondent No.3 had issued a letter dated
11.05.1998 to the said Life Insurance Corporation Housing Finance Ltd.
confirming that the petitioner was a bonafide member of the Society and as such
entitled to the allotment of a B-Type flat measuring 1096 square feets. In the
aforesaid letter, the respondent No.3 further confirmed that the tentative cost of
the flat was around Rs.4,40,000/- and that the petitioner had already paid
Rs.3,15,000/- by then and further that no other dues of the Society were
outstanding against her. It was also confirmed in the said letter issued by the
respondent No.3 that the petitioner was a bonafide member of the Society and had
been issued a share certificate bearing No.11530 dated 15.01.1989 (Annexure-3 to
the petition).
5.

The further case of the petitioner is that she availed of housing loan of

Rs.90,000/- from the LIC Housing Finance Ltd. in April, 1999 and a tripartite
agreement was entered into for the aforesaid purpose between the petitioner, the
respondent No.3 and the LIC Housing Finance Ltd. Thereafter, in August, 2000,
the petitioner availed of another housing loan of Rs.1,07,000/- for the purpose of

W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 3 of 17

making payment to the respondent No.3, which respondent No.3 utilised for the
construction of the flat. Copies of both the tripartite agreements dated 12.04.1999
and 29th June, 2000 are enclosed with the petition (Annexure-4 collectively).
Significantly, the payment of the said loan amount of Rs.1,07,000/- was made by
the petitioner to the Society on 29th August, 2000, i.e., just ten days before the
draw of lots, which took place on 09.09.2000. On the day of allotment, however,
the petitioner was taken aback to find that though her name was appearing in the
list of names for draw of lots, allotment was denied to her on the pretext that her
name and the names of certain other members were withheld by the Registrar,
Cooperative Societies. The list containing the names of 93 members including
that of the petitioner is enclosed with the petition as Annexure-5.
6.

On the same day, i.e., on 09.09.2000, the petitioner sent a phonogram to

the respondent No.1, the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, subsequently
followed by representations dated 12.09.2000 and 25.09.2000 (Annexures-6, 7
and 8). In response thereto, she received letters from the office of the respondent
No.1 dated 12.12.2000 and 09.03.2001 (Annexures-9 and 10), which were replied
to by her vide letter dated 19.03.2001 (Annexure-11).

The petitioner also

submitted about 24 documents to prove and establish the fact that she had made
payment of Rs.6 lakhs from 1989 till 2000.

Thereafter, the petitioner on

23.10.2000 applied to the respondent No.1 for certain copies of various
documents which were not made available to her by the respondent No.3 Society

W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 4 of 17

vide her applications dated 23.10.2000, 25.09.2000 and 19.03.2001 (Annexure-12
collectively). The respondent No.1 through their Assistant Registrar by letters
dated 10.11.2000, 12.12.2000 (referred to hereinabove) and 15.05.2001 asked the
respondent No.3 to produce the relevant records (Annexure-13). The respondent
No.3 instead of doing so, sent a show cause notice dated 07.02.2001 (Annexure14) to the petitioner, alleging that as per her application dated 20.11.1992, the
membership of one Mrs. Santosh Kumari, sister of the petitioner, was transferred
in the name of the petitioner and since it was noticed that Mrs. Santosh Kumari
was not the petitioner’s sister, the petitioner was not entitled to the membership of
the Society. By her reply dated 19.02.2001, the petitioner categorically stated that
the entire story of Mrs. Santosh Kumari was a pure fabrication and concoction
and that she did not know or identify any person by the name of Mrs. Santosh
Kumari, that hers was a case of original membership and the illegal withholding
of allotment of flat to her amounted to breach of trust on the part of the President
and Secretary of the Society by creating a fake dispute.
7.

Being aggrieved by the issuance of the show cause notice, the petitioner

also filed a Civil Writ Petition bearing No.4381/2000 before this Court
challenging the decision of the respondents denying allotment of flat to her. A
Division Bench of this Court vide order dated 20th December, 2002 observed that
the dispute between the petitioner and the respondent involved disputed questions
of fact and accordingly the appropriate remedy for the petitioner would be to

W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 5 of 17

approach the Registrar, Cooperative Societies for redressal. The writ petition was
disposed of with the said observations.
8.

Pursuant to the order dated 20th December, 2002, the petitioner made a

reference of dispute under Section 60 of the Delhi Cooperative Societies Act
against the respondent No.3 Society as case No.1098/AR/ARB/2002-03/548-49,
which was dismissed by the impugned order dated 19th September, 2003 passed
by the Joint Registrar.

The ground for dismissal was that the petitioner’s

membership of the Society arose by way of transfer from a previous member Smt.
Santosh Kumari and such transfers, not being within first degree blood relations,
were not permissible. Therefore, the membership of the petitioner was void ab
initio and the payments made by her to the Society could not regularize the same.
It was further held that since the claimant had not been enrolled as a member as
per law, her claim was not covered within the scope of Section 60 of the Delhi
Cooperative Societies Act.
9.

Aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the petitioner has preferred the present

petition before this Court praying for quashing of the aforesaid order and seeking
allotment of a three bed room HIG flat in category B in the respondent No.3
Society.
10.

We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and gone

through the allegations and counter allegations made by the parties as also the
documentary evidence in support thereof.

Counsel for the petitioner has

W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 6 of 17

vehemently urged before us that malafide and cooked up allegations have been
made by the Society in order to deprive the petitioner of her entitlement to the flat
in the Society as the petitioner does not know any person by the name of Smt.
Santosh Kumari and even otherwise, the question of transfer of membership does
not arise since on 15.01.1989, the petitioner was issued a share certificate by
virtue of which she became the original member of the Society. It is urged that
fraud has been played upon the petitioner by the respondent No.3 in connivance
with the said Smt. Santosh Kumari by fabricating and bringing on record an
alleged letter dated 20th November, 1992 showing that a request was made by
Smt. Santosh Kumari to the respondent No.3 Society for transfer of her share to
the petitioner herein, her alleged sister. Counsel for the petitioner also brought to
our notice the contents of an additional affidavit filed by the petitioner dated
2nd December, 2003 affirming on oath the following significant facts:
“1.
That as I have already stated in my writ petition that I
have no connection or relationship with ‘Ms. Santosh’ the
alleged transferor of membership of Respondent no.3 in my
name. I have also made it clear that the letter of ‘Ms. Santosh’
is a conspiracy hatched by the officials of Respondent no.3
Society. A copy of the letter dtd.20-11-92 is annexed as
Annexure P-1 to this affidavit.
2.
That after filing the preset petition I have come to know
that the alleged transferor ‘Ms. Santosh Kumari’ (with whom I
have been connected by falsely saying that she and me
represented to the ‘Society’ to be real sisters) is none else but
is the real sister-in-law (i.e. widowed wife of his real brother)
of Sh. Sita Ram Gautam himself, the then Secretary of the
respondent No.3 Society and that both Sita Ram Gautam and
Ms. Santosh Kumari are working in the same department and
W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 7 of 17

that both the same are residing in the same vicinity of the Govt.
allotted flats by the income tax department.
This fact has come to my knowledge on information
which has been verified by me to be true.
3.
That I say and submit that the above relationship makes
the things clear that the officials of Respondent no.3 Society
entered into a deep root conspiracy in order to deprive the
petitioner from allotment of B category flat for which she is
very much entitled.
4.

That I further say and submit that an affidavit sworn on

dtd. 25th July, 2000 by the President of Respondent no.3
Society was filed by the Respondent no.3 Society thereby
mentioning in para no.7 that resolution was passed by the
Respondent no.3 Society for the transfer of membership from
Mrs. Santosh Kumari to Mrs. Alka Gupta the petitioner herein
as 27-11-92. (A copy of the affidavit is annexed hereto and
marked as Annexure P-2 to this affidavit) whereas dtd.27-1192 itself the Respondent Society has issued receipt no.1949
showing the receipt of Rs.30,000/- from the petitioner a copy of
which is already on record on page 76 as Annexure 2 colly.”

11.

Our attention has also been drawn to the contents of para 2 of the counter-

affidavit filed by the respondent No.3 to the present writ petition and para 4 of the
short counter-affidavit filed by the respondent No.3, by counsel for the petitioner,
to urge that the stand taken by the respondent No.3 in the earlier writ petition
bearing No.4387/2001 is entirely contradictory to the stand taken in the present
writ petition. In para 2 of the counter-affidavit, the respondent No.3 categorically
asserts that the share certificate of the petitioner is a forged one. In the earlier writ
petition [W.P.(C) No.4387/2001] in para 4 of the short counter-affidavit, it was
asserted as follows:
“So far, share certificate allegedly issued by the society is

W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 8 of 17

concerned, the same was issued only for the purpose of raising
a loan and is not sufficient to hold that the petitioner was the
original member of the society.”

12.

We pause here to notice that the petitioner was asked by this Court to bring

the original certificate to the Court, whereupon the respondent immediately
admitted before this Court that the said certificate was issued by the Society and
bore his signatures. Thus, it is undisputed that the petitioner was issued a share
certificate as an original member of the Society.
13.

Counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 in their counter-affidavit and

during the course of arguments have adopted a most peculiar stand that it was
incumbent upon the petitioner to produce receipt of admission fee, proof of
membership, proof of payment, share certificate, but the petitioner could not
produce the same. In paragraph 2 of the counter-affidavit, it is stated thus:
“2.
………………………………….It is submitted that the
name of the petitioner was withheld on the ground that
membership of Smt. Santosh Kumari has been transferred to
her although it was not transferred in the first degree blood
relation. The petitioner was sent letter dated 12-12-2000, 193-2001 and 15-5-2001 by the AR(NW) for production of receipt
of admission fee, proof of membership, proof of payment, share
certificate, but the petitioner could not produce the same.
Moreover, the petitioner was given ample opportunity in the
Arbitration case no.109/AR/Arb/2002-03 filed u/s 60 of DCS
act 1972 and her claim was dismissed as she was held not to
be a member of the society enrolled as per law.”

14.

On behalf of the respondent No.3, an equally peculiar stand is adopted,

being that the petitioner is at liberty to prove that she acquired the membership as

W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 9 of 17

per procedure laid down under Rule 30 read with bye-law No.5 of the Society’s
Bye-laws (paras 14 and 16 of the reply to the show cause notice filed by the
respondent No.3). In paragraph 2 of the aforesaid reply as noticed above, the
share certificate filed by the petitioner is stated to be a forged one. During the
course of hearing also, the counsel for the respondent No.3 urged before us that it
was for the petitioner to produce the relevant documentary evidence, that is, the
receipt of admission fee, proof of payment of Rs.20,000/- paid by her as
admission fee, share certificate, etc.
15.

We are baffled by the aforesaid plea taken in the counter-affidavits of the

respondents and the stand taken by the respondents, that it is for the petitioner to
prove that she was a member of the Society, but she has failed to prove the same.
The petitioner having placed the share certificate issued by the Society on record,
it is not understandable as to how else the petitioner is required to prove her
membership.
16.

As noticed above, in the counter-affidavit filed by the respondent No.3 in

W.P.(C) No.4387/2001, the issuance of the share certificate to the petitioner has
been admitted by the respondent No.3 though it is sought to be urged that the
same was issued only for the purpose of raising a loan.

On behalf of the

respondent No.3, it has also been admitted before us that the share certificate filed
by the petitioner is not a forged one as pleaded in the reply to the show cause
notice filed in the present case. Thus, it is an admitted fact that a share certificate

W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 10 of 17

was issued to the petitioner as an original member of the respondent No.3 Society,
being share certificate No.11530 dated 15.01.1989.
17.

It is also an admitted fact that the petitioner has paid the entire cost of a

HIG flat of B category, inasmuch as receipts filed by her showing payment of a
sum of Rs.6 lakhs (approximately) have not been denied by the respondent No.3.
It is also not denied by the respondent No.3 Society that on the confirmation of
petitioner’s membership and the recommendation made by the respondent No.3,
loan was sanctioned in favour of the petitioner by the Life Insurance Corporation
Housing Finance Ltd., in which recommendation also reference was made by the
Society to the share certificate issued to the petitioner and the amount paid by the
petitioner, being a sum of Rs.3,15,000/-. It is also not in dispute that two tripartite
agreements were entered into between the petitioner, the LIC Housing Finance
Ltd. and the respondent No.3 Society on 12th April, 1999 and 29th June, 2000 and
that as a result thereof, loan instalments of Rs.90,000/- in the first instance and
Rs.1,70,000/- were advanced to the petitioner by the LIC Housing Finance Ltd.,
which were paid by the petitioner to the respondent No.3 Society. As noticed
above, the last instalment of Rs.1,70,000/- was paid by the petitioner to the
respondent No.3 Society ten days prior to the date on which draw of lots took
place, i.e., on 09.09.2000. Thus, clearly the respondent Society all along treated
the petitioner as a bonafide original member of the Society.
18.

We are also not inclined to believe the version of the respondent No.3

W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 11 of 17

Society with regard to the letter issued by Smt. Santosh Kumari @ Santosh
Sharma for transfer of her membership to her sister Alka Gupta (the petitioner
herein) for two reasons. The first is that an additional affidavit has been filed by
the petitioner to state that the petitioner is not related to Smt. Santosh Kumari and
as a matter of fact, does not even know the said Smt. Santosh Kumari and on the
other hand the said Smt. Santosh Kumari is the sister-in-law of Shri Sita Ram
Gautam, the then Secretary of the Society. There is no rebuttal to the said
affidavit nor it is denied anywhere in the counter-affidavits filed by the
respondents that Smt. Santosh Sharma is the sister-in-law of the then Secretary of
the Society. The second is that it emerges from the record that in the course of
investigation of case FIR No.822/2004, Police Station Prashant Vihar against the
then President and the then Secretary of the respondent No.3 Society, i.e., Shri
Sita Ram Gautam and Shri Vijay Kamra, when shown the photocopy of the letter
dated 20th November, 1992 Smt. Santosh Kumari denied having written any such
letter to the respondent No.3 Society.
19.

This is apparent from a perusal of the order dated 15th July, 2005 passed by

the learned Additional Sessions Judge, which reads as follows:
“State Vs. S.R. Gautam
State Vs. Vijay Kamra

Counsel for the applicants

Counsel for the complainant

Heard. The case against the applicants is that they had
forged the letter of Santosh Kumari showing that she had
transferred the membership to Alka Gupta. IO had produced
the letter of Santosh Kumari that she had not written any such
letter. Santosh Kumari is the sister-in-law of the applicantS.R. Gautam, President of the Society and even before the
Registrar affidavit submitted on behalf of the Society is that
Alka Gupta is a bonafide member. Prima facie, there is a case
of committal of forgery on the part of the applicants. No
further indulgence can be given. The applications are
dismissed.
Sd/(N.K. Gupta)
ADDL. SESSIONS JUDGE: DELHI”
20.

It also bears mention that except for the photocopy of the aforesaid letter of

Smt. Santosh Kumari, there is no other document on record to suggest that the
petitioner could be a transferee member. Had it been so and had there been any
such transfer by Smt. Santosh Kumari to the petitioner, undoubtedly the Society
would have taken a transfer request application from the petitioner coupled with
her affidavit and other papers requesting the Society to transfer the membership of
her alleged sister Smt. Santosh Kumari in her name.
21.

There is yet another aspect of the matter which deserves to be taken note

of.

On 25th October, 2000, at the time of hearing of the anticipatory bail

application of Shri Vijay Kamra and Shri Sita Ram Gautam in FIR No.822/2004,
Police Station Prashant Vihar in the Court of learned ASJ Ms. Indermeet Kaur

W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Kochar, when the said bail applications were about to be dismissed, the counsel
for the applicants offered to work out a via media by virtue of which possession of
the flats could be handed over to the petitioner and the five other complainants
and upon this, interim protection was granted to the applicants, on the
complainant agreeing to the proposal put forth by the counsel for the applicants.
The said interim protection was thereafter extended upon the applicants
addressing the following letter to the Registrar, Cooperative Societies on 25th
November, 2004:

substantially the same allegations as contained in the present writ petition, which
was dismissed by a learned Single Judge of this Court after recording the
following findings:

W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 15 of 17

“5. It is apparent from these facts that prima facie a fraud
was played upon the complainant's wife by the accused
persons in connivance with Smt. Santosh Kumari who seems to
be a party to entire fraud because of writing a false and forged
letter. It is not a case where no offence is disclosed from the
Complaint. The accused persons prima facie played dubious
role by issuing original share certificate and accepting the
payment as original member. The order of Registrar
Cooperative Societies does not help the accused persons rather
brings to light the role played by the accused persons.
6.
An FIR can be quashed only if a complaint prima facie
does not disclose commission of an offence or it is barred
under some law. The plea taken by the petitioner that the claim
of the complainant about membership would be decided by the
Registrar Cooperative Societies alone and criminal complaint
was barred, is a misconceived argument. The criminal
complaint is not in respect of membership dispute but the
complaint is in respect of fraud played upon the complainant's
wife. Membership issue is not to be decided by the Criminal
Court. I find no force in the petition. The petition is hereby
dismissed.”
23.

In view of the aforesaid, in our considered opinion, it is crystal clear that

the petitioner was an original member of the respondent No.3 Society and was
sought to be deprived of the flat which should rightfully have been allotted to here
as far back as on 09.09.2000. The case has a chequered history, and a long and
protracted battle has been fought by the petitioner from September, 2000 till date
on account of the stand taken by the respondent No.3 Society in respect of the
petitioner's membership and the membership of certain other members, two of
whom are petitioners in the connected writ petitions. We are satisfied that the
petitioners are entitled to the allotment of the HIG Flats in category B as opted by
them. We accordingly set aside the impugned orders dated 19.09.2003 in W.P.(C)

W.P.(C) No.7226/2003, 7224/2003 and 18492/2004

Page 16 of 17

7224/03 and 7226/03. Similarly, the impugned order dated 06.11.2003 passed by
the respondent No.2 and order dated 04.03.2004 passed by the Presiding Officer,
Delhi Cooperative Tribunal in W.P.(C) 18492/04 are also accordingly set aside.
We further direct the respondent No.3 to allot and deliver to the petitioner the
actual physical and vacant possession of a three bed room HIG flats in category B
