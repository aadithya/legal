PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Petitioner seeks quashing of a criminal complaint filed

by the first respondent under Section 138 read with Section 142
of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 and the summoning order
dated 22.3.2003 inter alia alleging that the complaint does not
disclose an actionable cause against the petitioner and that there
was no material before the learned M.M. to summon the
petitioner. 2.

As per the complaint lodged by respondent

No.1 accused name is M/s.Bharat Fabricators through the
petitioner.
3.

It is stated in the complaint that the accused

purchased computer peripherals and to clear payment for the
purchase made issued cheque No.168712 dated 21.9.2002 in
sum of Rs.84,000/- in favour of the complainant.
4.

It is stated in the complaint that when presented for

encashment the bank on whom cheque was drawn returned the
same with the advice 'funds insufficient'.
5.

Petitioner alleges no concern with the cheque or

M/s.Bharat Fabricators.
6.

In the reply filed to the petition, complainant has

changed its version. It is stated in sub-para (d) of para 2 of the
reply filed to the instant petition that the petitioner is the director
of Kanpav Overseas Pvt. Ltd. and that he has acted in connivance
with one Mr.Amar Singh Gupta who has issued the cheque in
question. It is further stated that the petitioner as also Mr.Amar
Singh Gupta jointly took delivery of the goods sold and in respect
whereof the cheque was issued.

It is stated that the bill was

actually raised in the name of Kanpav Overseas Pvt. Ltd.

That

Amar Singh Gupta is the authorized signatory to the bank account
maintained by Kanpav Overseas Pvt. Ltd. That petitioner is the
director of the said company.
7.

If that was the position, in the complaint, principal

accused had to be M/s.Kanpav Overseas Pvt. Ltd.

Requisite

averments have to be made against the petitioner in relation to
his being a director and the person in charge and in control and

responsible to the company for the conduct of its business.
8.

In view of the reply filed by the respondent it is

obvious that the complaint filed by the respondent against
M/s.Bharat Fabricators through the petitioner does not disclose
any cognizable offence.
