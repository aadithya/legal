1.

Appellants, parents and minor unmarried sister of

late Kishan Haldar have filed the appeal challenging the order
dated 27.11.2006 passed by the

Railway Claims Tribunal

dismissing the claim petition filed by them.
2.

Appellants

had

filed

a

claim

petition

seeking

compensation on account of the untimely death of Kishan
Haldar who as a passenger in train No.9263 was undertaking
the journey on 22.9.2004 from Jaipur to Delhi Sarai Rohilla.
FAO 35/07

page 1 of 9

According to the appellants as the train passed Patel Nagar
station Kishan Haldar fell off the train

due to a sudden

jerk/jolt.
3.

It is not in dispute that the deceased was a bonafide

passenger in the train and suffered multiple grevious injuries
which proved fatal. He died on 26.9.2004 at 2.15 AM at DDU
Hospital.
4.

Pertaining to the death of the deceased the Tribunal

has returned a finding as under :“The fact that the deceased died while travelling
on the train is established from the record.
However, one pertinent fact that has been
placed on record is the inquest report, issued by
Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, which states
that “smell of alcohol present in the breath”.
Apparently the deceased had consumed alcohol
before boarding the train or during the train
journey, D.D. No.5-A which is Ex.AW-1/7 has
been placed on record from which the relevant
para states that apparently he was holding the
handle of the door and leaning out of the train as
a result of which his head struck against a pole
near the railway track, leading to his injury and
falling down from the train. Final inquest report
Ex.AW-1/5 also has brought out that he was
holding the handle of the door and leaning out
as a result of which his head struck against the
pole, which was near the railway track. Section
124-A deals with above subject. This appears
to be a case of Section 124 (A)(b) self-inflicted
injury coupled with Section 124-A (d) which
states any act committed by him in a state of
intoxication or insanity.”
5.

FAO 35/07

It is not in dispute that an accidental falling of from

page 2 of 9

a train carrying passengers is an untoward incident and that
under Section 124-A of the Railways Act,1989 compensation
has to be paid as per the applicable rules. In case of death of
the passenger, the dependents are entitled to compensation.
6.

Section 124-A of the Railways Act,1989 reads as

under :“124A.
Compensation
on
account
of
untoward incident.– When in the course of working
in railway an untoward incident occurs, then whether
or not there has been any wrongful act, neglect or
default on the part of the railway administration such
as would entitle a passenger who has been injured or
the dependent of a passenger who has been killed to
maintain an action and recover damages in respect
thereof,
the
railway
administration
shall,
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law,
be liable to pay compensation to such extent as may
be prescribed and to that extent only for loss
occasioned by the death of, or injury to, a passenger
as a result of such untoward incident:
Provided that no compensation shall be payable
under this section by the railway administration if the
passenger dies or suffers injury due to –
(a)

suicide or attempted suicide by him;

(b)

self-inflicted injury;

(c)

his own criminal act;

(d) any act committed by him in a state of
intoxication or insanity;
(e) any natural cause or disease or medical or
surgical treatment unless such treatment becomes
necessary due to injury caused by the said untoward
incident.

FAO 35/07

page 3 of 9

Explanation.– For the purposes of this section,
“passenger” includes –
(i)

a railway servant on duty; and

(ii) a person who has purchased a valid ticket for
travelling by a train carrying passengers, on any date
or a valid platform ticket and becomes a victim of an
untoward incident.”
7.

It is apparent to a reader that under Section 124A,

when in the course of working a railway an untoward incident
occurs, irrespective of default, negligence and wrongful act on
the part of the railway administration such a passenger would
be entitled to compensation. In case of death, the dependents
of the deceased would be entitled to compensation.
liability is 'no fault liability'.

Thus, the

Whatever be the cause of the

accidental falling of a passenger from a train, compensation
has to be paid.

But, the proviso carves out an exception.

If

the passenger suffers injury or dies due to an act falling under
any of the sub-clauses (a) to (e) of the proviso, liability of the
railways to pay is excluded.
act or an act committed

Self inflicted injury, own criminal
in the state on intoxication would

entitle, upon proof of the fact, the railway authorities to deny
compensation.
8.

The Tribunal has noted that the breath of Kishan

Haldar revealed smell of alcohol when he was brought to the
hospital in an injured condition.
FAO 35/07

not

The fact that a person has consumed alcohol would
necessarily

mean

that

the

person

is

intoxicated.

Unfortunately, there is no evidence on record to show the level
of alcohol in the blood of Kishan Haldar. Thus, I do not treat it
to be a case of a person committing an act in a state of
intoxication.
10.

The

Tribunal

has

noted

that

the

evidence

probabilises a case of self-inflicted injury coupled with an act
committed in the state of intoxication. By removing the act of
being committed in the state of intoxication from the finding
returned by the Tribunal, appellants cannot succeed on that
fact alone, for the reason, each act contemplated under
clauses (a) to (e) of the proviso to Section 124A

are

independent of each other.
11.

Thus, it has to be considered whether the deceased

did an act which amounts to a self-inflicted injury.
12.

AW-2, a stated co-passenger, has deposed in his

evidence that the deceased fell of the train when the train
suddenly jolted. If his testimony is to be believed, appellants
must succeed.
13.

But unfortunately for the appellants the nature of

injuries on the person of the deceased belies the ocular
evidence of AW-2.
FAO 35/07

14.

The MLC of the deceased,

Ex.AW-1/10, shows

injuries over the occipital region and hardly any on the rest of
the body.
15.

Let me visualize a man being thrown out of a train

in motion due to a sudden jolt. The fall would make a person
drop vertically down with the first injuries occurring on the
lower part of the body.

Thereafter, due to momentum the

body may tumble over and a person may receive injuries in the
occipital region. But where no injuries are there on the body
except on the occipital region, the cause of injury which gets
probabilises is

the head striking on stationary blunt object

when train is in motion.
16.

The death summary AW-1/11 notes that the patient

had received grievous head injuries. All injuries noted in the
death summary are relatable to

the skull.

injury on any other part of the body.

There is just no

The inquest report

Ex.AW-1/5 also suggests that the head of the deceased when
in motion struck a blunt object, suggestive of the fact that the
head of the deceased was extending outside the train when in
motion.
17.

AW-2, a stated co-passenger appears to be a

planted witness for the reason the MLC of the injured records
his name as unknown. Even the death summary records the
FAO 35/07

page 6 of 9

name as unknown. As noted above, the accident took place on
22.9.2004. The deceased was removed to the hospital in an
injured condition. He died 4 days thereafter on 26.9.2004. No
relation had reached the hospital. The death summary reveals
that the patient was declared dead at 2.15 AM on 22.9.2004
and the body was handed over to mortuary.
18.

In his testimony, AW-2, deposed that he had

purchased 4 tickets for travel from Jaipur to Delhi. One ticked
was for the journey of the deceased, 1 ticket was for self and 2
tickets

were for other

friends who were travelling

by the

train. I may quote from the testimony of AW-2. He stated as
under :“2. That on 22.9.2004 at Jaipur railway station the
deponent purchased four tickets for Delhi i.e. one
for the deceased Shri Kishan Haldar, one for self and
two tickets for other two friends who were travelling
by train No.9263 (Porbandar – Delhi-Sarai Rohilla
Express) from Jaipur to Delhi-Sarai Rohilla railway
station. All the four were travelling in the same
compartment including the deceased.”
19.

AW-2 stated in his testimony that after his friend

fell of the train he tried to stop the train by pulling the alarm
chain but the train did not stop and when the train stopped at
Sarai Rohilla station, he along with his friends went by the
side of tracks to find out the deceased but could not locate
him. That he gave a telephonic message to the parents of the

FAO 35/07

page 7 of 9

deceased. That

when they were searching for the deceased

they met a PCR van, an official whereof informed that a person
involved in the accident had been admitted to DDU Hospital.
That he waited at Delhi Sarai Rohilla station

till the family

members of the deceased met him.
20.

This is simply unbelievable.

If this was true, the

family members would have got information that the deceased
was admitted at DDU Hospital. They would have reached the
hospital. The fact that the deceased lay in an injured condition
at DDU Hospital

for 4 days without anyone reaching the

hospital probablises

that since no information was available

with the family members none reached the hospital. Which, in
turn

means that AW-2 did not inform the parents of the

deceased about the incident.

In turn it probabilises the fact

that AW-2 was a planted witness.
21.

It is settled law that if the court of original

jurisdiction has probabilised the fact with rationale and logic
and has neither missed out a circumstance nor ignored a
relevant finding, the finding of fact recorded by the court of
first instance would not be interfered with in appeal.
22.

I find no merits in the appeal.

23.

The appeal is dismissed.

24.

No costs.
