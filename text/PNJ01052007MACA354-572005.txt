PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

On 20.4.2002, deceased Mam Chand died in a road

accident involving Bus No.DL-1PB-1088. He was survived by his
wife and three sons.
2.

Dependents

filed

a

claim

petition

claiming

a

compensation of Rs. 10 lacs on account of death of deceased in
the said road accident.
3.

After holding driver of offending bus, guilty of rash and

negligent driving, learned Tribunal awarded compensation in
sum of Rs.3,21,840/-

to the dependents.

Break up of the

compensation is as follows:“Loss of dependence:

Rs.2,94,840/- (In the award,
Page 1 of 9

due
typographical error,
this sum has been wrongly
mentioned as
Rs.2,96,840/-).
Funeral expenses :
Rs.2,000/Non pecuniary
damages
:
Rs.25,000/4.

Total

Aggrieved

:

by

to

Rs.3,21,840/-”
the
amount of

compensation,

dependents/appellants have filed the present appeal praying for
enhancement of compensation.
5.

As only enhancement of compensation is prayed for, I

will only be noting facts as are relevant for determination of said
issues.
6.

Wife of the deceased stepped into the witness box as

PW-1 and deposed that her husband was a trained electrician
and was earning Rs.6,000/- per month at the time of the
accident.
7.

Son of the deceased Vinod Kumar in his testimony as

PW-3 also deposed that his father was a trained electrician. He
also placed on record admission card issued to deceased by
Office

of

Electrical

Inspector

for

Competency (Wire Man) Examination

Class

II

Certificate

of

(Ex.PW-3/A), a receipt

dated 15.6.1985 issued by employer of the deceased (Ex.PW3/B) and a bill dated 3.4.1991 issued by deceased to a customer
(Ex.PW-3/C) to show that the deceased was working as an
electrician at the time of the accident.
8.

Relying upon the aforenoted testimony of wife and son

of the deceased, learned Tribunal has held that deceased was

Page 2 of 9

earning his livelihood by working as an electrician.

But, in

absence of any clear and cogent evidence showing the income
of the deceased at the time of the accident, Tribunal has taken
guidance of the minimum wages notified under the Minimum
Wages Act to determine the income of the deceased. Tribunal
has placed deceased in the category of semi-skilled labourer.
Minimum wages of semi-skilled labourers on 1.8.2002 was
Rs.2,845.70/- per month.

Thus, learned Tribunal has taken

Rs.2,845/- as the monthly income of the deceased at the time of
the accident.

Deducting 1/3rd for the personal spending of

the deceased, loss of dependence is determined at Rs.1,890/per month.
9.

Noting that deceased was aged 46 years at the time of

the accident, Tribunal has applied the multiplier of 13.

Thus,

total loss of dependence is determined at Rs.2,94,840/(Rs.1,890 x 12 x 13).

Adding thereto Rs.25,000/-

under the

head 'non pecuniary damages' and Rs.2,000/- for funeral
expenses, total compensation is determined at Rs.3,21,840/-.
10.

Learned counsel for the appellants has challenged the

award on 4 counts. One, Tribunal has incorrectly taken the age
of the deceased at the time of the accident as 46 years. Two,
while determining loss of dependence, Tribunal has incorrectly
determined monthly income of the deceased at the time of the
accident on the basis of minimum wages.

Three, while

determining loss of dependence, Tribunal has ignored the
prospects of future increase in the income of the deceased.

Page 3 of 9

Four, multiplier adopted by the Tribunal is on the lower side.
11.

On the issue of age, I note that the Tribunal has

determined the age of deceased at the time of the accident on
the basis of postmortem report(Ex.P-3). Certificate of insurance
issued by LIC (Mark A) was placed on record by the dependents
which records date of birth of deceased as 25.10.1959. Date of
accident is 20.4.2002. Thus, age of deceased at the time of the
accident was 43 years. In my opinion, learned Tribunal erred in
relying upon postmortem report when there was clear evidence
showing the age of the deceased at the time of the accident.
Thus, I take the age of the deceased as 43 years at the time of
the accident.
12.

On the issue of income of the deceased, learned

counsel for the appellants contended that there was ample
evidence before the Tribunal showing the income of the
deceased at the time of the accident. He further contended that
testimony of wife and son of the deceased as also the
documents produced by the son of the deceased clearly
established that deceased was earning Rs.6,000/- per month at
the time of accident.
13.

I do not agree with the learned counsel for the

appellants. Self serving statements of the wife and son of the
deceased pertaining to income of the deceased has rightly been
rejected by the Tribunal. The aforenoted documents (noted in
para 7 above) produced by the son of the deceased merely
show that the deceased was a trained electrician and do not in

Page 4 of 9

anyway establish the income of the deceased at the time of the
accident.
14.

However,

learned

Tribunal

has

erred

in

placing

deceased in the category of semi-skilled labourer. Documents
produced by the son of the deceased prove beyond doubt that
the deceased was a trained electrician. Thus, Tribunal ought to
have placed deceased in the category of skilled labourer.
Minimum wages of skilled labourers as on 1.8.2002 was
Rs.3,103.70/-. Thus, I take Rs.3,100/- as the monthly income of
the deceased at the time of the accident.
15.

No evidence has been led to show the prospects of

future increase in the income of the deceased.

However, a

perusal of the minimum wages notified under the Minimum
Wages Act show that to neutralize increase in inflation and cost
of living, minimum wages virtually double after every 10 years.
For instance, minimum wages of skilled labourers as on
1.1.1980 was Rs.320/- per month and same rose to Rs.1,083/per month in the year 1990. Meaning thereby, from year 1980
to year 1990, there has been an increase of nearly 238% in the
minimum wages. Similarly, minimum wages of skilled labourers
as on 1.1.190 was Rs.1.083/- per month and same rose to
Rs.2,948/- per month in the year 2000. Meaning thereby, from
year 1990 to year 2000, there has been an increase of nearly
172% in the minimum wages. Thus, it could safely be assumed
that income of the deceased would have doubled in the next 10
years. Therefore, I take mean average income of the deceased

Page 5 of 9

as Rs.4,650/- (Rs.3,100 + 6,200 / 2 = Rs.4,650/-).
16.

Noting that sons of the deceased were aged 25, 23

and 16 years respectively, I consider deduction of 1/3rd for the
personal spending of the deceased as appropriate.

Thus,

average loss of dependence is determined at Rs.3,100/- per
month.
17.

On the issue of multiplier, learned counsel for the

appellants has contended that multiplier of 13 applied by the
Tribunal is on the lower side. He further contended that Second
Schedule provides for a multiplier of 15 in case of deceased
aged between 40 years - 45 years. Thus, Tribunal ought to have
applied multiplier of 15. He relied upon unreported decisions of
the Supreme Court in Savita Sharma & Ors. Vs. Union of
India/Chandigarh

Administration

&

Anr.

(Civil

Appeal

No.6441/2000 decided on 16.1.2007)and M.Lakshmi & Ors.
Vs.E.V.Kumar & Anr. (SLP Civil No.5694/2006 decided on
2.2.2007) in support of his contention that multiplier adopted
should be on the basis of Second Schedule appended to the
Motor Vehicles Act 1988.
18.

In Savita Sharma's case (supra), noting Second

Schedule Supreme Court applied a multiplier of 11 in case of a
deceased aged 53 years. In M.Lakshmi's case (supra), Supreme
Court applied a multiplier of 18 in case of deceased aged 26
years. But, both decisions, by a Bench of 2 Judges, have not
noted earlier decisions on the issue by larger benches.
19.

Second Schedule was appended to the Motor Vehicles

Page 6 of 9

Act 1988 in the year 1994.
20.

Second Schedule was considered by a Three Bench

Judge in the decision reported as UP State Road Transport
Corporation Vs. Trilok Chandra & Ors. (1996) 4 SCC 362. It was
observed para 18 as under:

21.

“We must at once point out that the calculation of
compensation and the amount worked out in the
schedule suffer from several defects. For example,
in item No, 1 for a victim aged 15 years, the
multiplier is shown to be 15 years' and the
multiplicand is shown to be Rs. 3000. The total
should be 3000 x 15 = 45,000 but the same is
worked out at Rs. 60,000. Similarly, in the second
item the multiplier is 16 and the annual income is
Rs. 9000; the total should have been Rs. 1,44,000
but shown to be Rs. 1,71,000. To put it briefly, the
table abounds in such mistakes. Neither the
Tribunals nor the courts can go by the ready
reckoner. It can only be used as a guide.”
The multiplier method involves the ascertainment of

the loss of dependency or the multiplicand having regard to the
circumstances of the case and capitalizing the multiplicand by
an appropriate multiplier. The choice of the multiplier is
determined by the age of the deceased (or that of the
claimants, whichever is higher) and by the calculation as to
what capital sum, if invested at a rate of interest appropriate to
a stable economy, would yield the multiplicand by way of annual
interest. In ascertaining this, regard should also be had to the
fact that ultimately the capital sum should also be consumed-up
over the period for which the dependency is expected to last.
22.

I refer to another set of decisions wherein Supreme

Court has applied multiplier on the basis of age of the deceased,
age of dependents and other attendant circumstances.

2nd

schedule has been deviated from. They are as follows:
“1.
Tamilnadu State Road Transport Corp. Ltd.
Vs. S.Rajapriya & Ors. AIR 2005 SC 2985: Supreme
Court applied a multiplier of 12 in case of deceased
aged 38 years.
2.
The Managing Director, TNSTC Ltd. Vs.
K.I.BIndu & Ors. 2006 ACJ 423: Supreme Court applied
a multiplier of 13 in case of a deceased aged 34
years.
3.
U.P.State Road Transport Co. Vs. Krishna
Bala & Ors. 2006 ACJ. 2114: Supreme Court applied a
multiplier of 13 in case of deceased aged 36 years.
4.
The Municipal Corporation of Greater
Bombay Vs. Sh. Laxman Iyer & Anr. 2004 ACJ 53:
Supreme Court applied a multiplier of 12 noting the
age of the parents who were aged 47 years and 43
years respectively, Deceased was aged 18 years.
5.
New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Kalpana &
Ors. 2007 (2) SCALE 227: Supreme Court applied a
multiplier of 13 in case of a deceased aged 33 years.

23.

6.
The Managing Director, TNSTC Vs. Sripriya
& Ors. Civil Appeal No.1200/2007 decided on
8.3.2007: Supreme Court applied a multiplier of 12 in
case of a deceased aged 37 years.”
In the light of aforenoted decisions and the age of the

deceased, I consider multiplier of 11 as appropriate.
24.

Thus, total loss of dependence comes to Rs.3100 x 12

x 11= Rs.4,09,200/-.
25.

Tribunal has awarded Rs.2,94,840/- under the head

'loss of dependence'.

Thus, compensation under this head is

increased by a further sum of Rs.1,14,360/-.
26.
