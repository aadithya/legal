This is an application under Order 23 Rule 3 read with

Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, for recording the
compromise arrived at between the parties and decreeing the suit in terms
thereof. The plaintiff had filed the suit for specific performance and
permanent injunction against the defendants. The learned counsel for the
plaintiff states that the main dispute was with the defendants 1 and 2 who
are husband and wife. Insofar as defendant No.3 is concerned, he is not
claiming any relief, any further.
2.

During the pendency of the suit the plaintiff and the

defendants 1 and 2 have amicably settled the matter out of Court. A

compromise Deed has also been executed on 11.10.2007 between the
plaintiff and the defendants and under which the defendants have paid a
sum of Rs 4,00,000/- to the plaintiff and the plaintiff has settled all his
claims in respect of the suit property, namely, G-6, Sector 10, Vardhaman
Plaza Dwarka, New Delhi. The agreement to sell dated 7.1.2006 is
deemed to be without any effect any further. The exact terms of the
settlement are recorded in the application as well as in the compromise
deed dated 11.10.2007. This application has been signed by the plaintiff
and the defendant No.1, who also appears on behalf of his wife
(defendant No.2). The application is also supported by affidavits of Shri
Sher Singh Sehrawat the (plaintiff) and Shri Ravi Bhushan Suri (the
defendant No 1). The plaintiff and the defendant No.1 both are present
in Court and they state that the matter has been entirely compromised and
settled as indicated above.

The application is also signed by the

respective counsel for the plaintiff and the defendants 1 and 2. The
compromise/settlement arrived at between the parties is lawful and the
same is taken on record. The suit is decreed in terms of the compromise.
This application is marked as `Ext. C-1' and shall form part of the decree.
3.

The application, suit and all other pending applications are

disposed of.
