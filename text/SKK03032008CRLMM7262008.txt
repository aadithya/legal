Crl. M.A. No.2748/2008
Allowed subject to just exceptions.
Crl. M. C. No. 726/2008
1.

The petitioner claims to be a qualified Direct Sales Associate
of the HDFC Bank Limited, having been so appointed under
a written agreement w.e.f. February, 2004 at Delhi.

The

petitioner carried out the business for about six months.
The proceedings against the petitioner have arisen on
account of

the fact

Crl.M.C.726/08 & Crl.M.A.2747-48/08

that the police

received secret

Page 1/6

information that some persons in the office of M/s Fortune
Credits were making forged documents for customers in
order to facilitate obtaining loans from various banks.

A

decoy customer, Mr.Mahipal Singh, was put up and the
accused were caught red-handed.

The decoy customer

visited the office of the petitioner when he was informed by
the petitioner and his two associates that the needful could
be done and would cost Rs.4,800/-. A sum of Rs.500/- was
given as advance to the petitioner on 27.9.2004 and the
decoy customer was asked to come back again on
30.9.2004. It is on 30.9.2004 that the accused were caught
red-handed at the stage of delivery of documents. An FIR
503/04

dated

30.9.2004

was

registered

u/s

193/420/467/468/471 IPC r/w Section 120-B IPC at P.S. Preet
Vihar and a charge-sheet was subsequently filed u/s
420/468/471/120-B IPC
2.

The trial court framed charges u/s 420/471/473/474 IPC r/w
Section 34 IPC against the petitioner on 24.8.2007.

The

revision petition filed by the petitioner before the learned
Additional Sessions Judge was dismissed on 17.12.2007. It
is these orders which are now sought to be challenged.
3.

At the inception of the hearing itself it was pointed out by
learned counsel for the petitioner that there cannot be an
indefinite number of tiers of judicial scrutiny for litigants.
The stage of framing of charges requires the trial court to

Crl.M.C.726/08 & Crl.M.A.2747-48/08

Page 2/6

sift through the material before it to comes to a conclusion
whether there was a reasonable possibility of the accused
being convicted on the basis of the material on record and
the charges have to be framed accordingly. The trial court,
thus, in the present case applied its mind and framed the
charges under the relevant provisions deemed appropriate
by it.

The second round of scrutiny took place in the

revision proceedings when the learned Additional Sessions
Judge similarly called for records and after hearing learned
counsel for the parties, upheld the said order. The present
proceedings have been filed u/s 482 Cr.P.C., which is the
inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as
may be necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any
Court or to secure the end of justice.

This is an

extraordinary remedy which has to be exercised sparingly
and should not to be resorted to as an appeal or revision as
observed by this Court in Kavita Vs. State & Ors., 2000
Crl.L.J. 315 (Del). In fact, it has been observed in State of
Bihar Vs. Murad Ali Khan & Ors., (1989) Crl.L.J.1005 that the
High Court would not embark upon an enquiry whether the
allegations in the complaint are likely to be established by
the evidence or not. This legal position has to be applied to
the facts of the present case where on the issue of framing
of charges, two courts have already gone through the
process of scrutiny.

Learned counsel for the petitioner, however, insisted that
this Court must once again hear all the matters which were
argued before the trial court as also before the revision
court and, thus, contended at length.

5.

On hearing learned counsel for the petitioner, I find no
infirmity in the impugned orders. It is not in dispute that
M/s Fortune Credits is being run by the petitioner. It is also
not in dispute that there was a decoy customer, Mahipal
Singh, who was sent for obtaining bank statements on I.T.
Returns in his name for obtaining housing loans from HDFC
Bank. The decoy customer, inter alia, met the petitioner,
who assured that he would prepare the bank statements
and I.T. statements of two years in his name and for that he
would charge an amount. An advance was given and the
balance amount was to be paid at the time of collection of
documents on 30.9.2004.

There was, thus, common

intention of the petitioner shared along with the other coaccused and the charges have been rightly framed under
the different provisions. It cannot be said that there is no
element of deception involved in the present case so as not
to constitute the offence of cheating. It is the case where
the documents have been forged and were handed over to
be used as genuine one's.

There is possession of

documents knowing it to be forged and intended to be used
as genuine and, thus, the offences are made out under the

Crl.M.C.726/08 & Crl.M.A.2747-48/08

Page 4/6

relevant provisions of the IPC.
6.

It cannot be lost sight of the fact that the Apex Court in the
recent judgment in Kailash Verma Vs. Punjab State Civil
Supplies Corpn. And Anrs., 2005 (2) SCC 571 has held that
the power u/s 482 Cr.P.C. was to be exercised sparingly and
such power shall not be utilized as a substitute for second
revision.

Ordinarily, when a revision has been barred u/s

397(3) Cr.P.C., the complainant or the accused cannot be
allowed to take recourse to revision before the High Court
u/s 397(1) Cr.P.C. as it is prohibited u/s 397(3) thereof.
However, the High Court can entertain a petition u/s 482
Cr.P.C. when there is serious miscarriage of justice and
abuse of the process of the court or when mandatory
provisions of law are not complied with and when the High
Court feels that the inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised
to correct the mistake committed by the revisional court.
7.

In the present case the charges were framed against the
petitioner by the learned trial court and the revisional court
confirmed that order after elaborately considering the facts
and circumstances of the case.

In my considered view,

there is no ground made out for this Court to exercise its
inherent powers u/s 482 Cr.P.C. as there is no miscarriage of
justice warranting such interference.
8.

In the end, it must also be observed that a recent trend has
been noticed of approaching the High Court at the drop of a

Crl.M.C.726/08 & Crl.M.A.2747-48/08

Page 5/6

hat on different stages of criminal proceedings to somehow
scuttle the trial. The object is to see that the trial does not
proceed by seeking to challenge orders passed at different
stages of criminal trial and each of such challenge is then
carried forward at multi-levels of judicial scrutiny.
present

case

the

accused

were

caught

In the

red-handed

fabricating documents to get a prospective customer to
utilize the same with the bank for obtaining housing loan
and it is in furtherance of this delaying tactics that the
present petition has been filed for a third tier of scrutiny on
the issue of framing of charges.
9.

It is in view thereof that while not finding any merit in the
petition and dismissing the same, I also consider it
necessary to impose costs on the petitioner.

10.

The petition is accordingly dismissed as without merits with
costs of Rs.7,500/-, to be deposited with the Delhi High
Court Legal Services Committee within 15 days from today.
Crl.M.A.2747/2008

The application has become infructuous and is disposed of.
