This order shall dispose of objections filed by Delhi Jal Board to the

award dated 26th March, 1990 and the application of the petitioner under
Sections 14, 17 and 29 of the Arbitration Act read with Section 3 of the
Interest Act for filing of the original award dated 26th March, 1990 and for

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

making it rule of the court.

2.

Brief facts to comprehend the disputes between the parties are that

the petitioner is a partnership firm and Shri V.K. Dewan is a partner.
Petitioner entered into a contract with respondent No.1 for execution of the
work of construction of storm water pump house at Shakti Nagar under-pass,
Delhi and an agreement dated 18th August, 1987 bearing No.5/1987-88 was
executed between the parties.

The work was executed under Executive

Engineer (Dr) C-IX, New Delhi.

In respect of the work executed by the

petitioner, the disputes had arisen and were referred to Shri B. Dayal,
respondent No.2. The Commissioner, MCD, by his letter No. Land Officer
(Water)'S 2032 dated 16th November 1988 had appointed him as an arbitrator
who entered upon reference on 30th November, 1988. The petitioner filed the
claim and respondent filed the counter claim for approximately Rs.20.00 lakh.
After considering the claims, counter claims and the documents of the
parties, the learned arbitrator, respondent No.2, awarded an amount of
Rs.7,71,259.70/- with interest @ 10% per annum from 26th March, 1990 till
decree or payment whichever is earlier.

3.

The respondent No.1, Municipal Corporation of Delhi has filed

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 2 of 22

objections under Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 contending
inter alia that the Arbitrator has mis-conducted himself as the claimant in
letter for arbitration dated 4th October, 1988 claimed a total sum of
Rs.7,94,660.10 whereas the learned arbitrator has awarded a sum of
Rs.8,22,038.13 and, therefore, the arbitrator has acted beyond the scope of
reference. The award was objected to on the ground that the material
documents have been ignored which constitute a misconduct and for this the
objector/respondent No.1 relied on AIR 1977 Delhi 231. Regarding claim
No.2 for Rs.34,731.60, it was contended that it was not in terms of reference
and no such claim was referred by the claimant at any point of time and there
is no dispute with regard to this amount between the parties. Regarding
claim No.4, the respondent No.1/objector contended that it was patently
untenable as the value of the work executed only to the extent of
Rs.12,89,689.34 and escalation should be counted on that amount after
adjusting the amount as per claim No.3, however, the arbitrator has granted
on the entire value of the contract ignoring the value of the work not
executed.

4.

Relying on clause 10 -CC it was contended that it takes care of labour

and material,

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

both on cost index basis and, therefore, the claim No.5

Page 3 of 22

regarding payment of Rs.1,01,226.40 to the claimant on account of increase
in labour wages tantamount to overlapping and giving double benefit to the
contractor and clause 10 – CC on cost index is for material and labor and not
for labor wages. The power of the arbitrator to award interest was also
questioned and it was contended that the counter claims had been rejected
by the Arbitrator illegally without considering the documents in this regard.

5.

This Court had framed following issues on 14th March, 1993
1.

Whether the award is liable to be set aside on the

objections raised in the objection petition?
2.

6.

Relief.

I have heard the learned counsel for the parties in detail and have also

perused the objections filed by the objector, reply filed by the claimant,
rejoinder filed by the objector to the reply to the objection by the claimant,
affidavit of Shri L.N Bhatnagar EE © DR.IX, D.W.S & S.D and the documents
filed with the affidavit, documents dated 24th September, 1993 filed by the
claimant and the award dated 26th March, 1990.

7.

The objection of the objector/Delhi Jal Board is that the Arbitrator has

awarded more than what is claimed by the contractor in the letter dated 4th

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 4 of 22

October, 1988.

According to the Objector, the petitioner/claimant had

claimed a sum of Rs.7,94,660.10 whereas the Arbitrator has awarded a sum
of Rs.8,22,038.13.

8.

Perusal of the claims of the claimant raised before the arbitrator and

adjudicated by the Arbitrator reflects that the claimant had claimed
Rs.4,57,350 being the balance amount. According to the claimant, the lump
sum amount of the contract was for a total value of Rs.18.50 lakh and a
schedule of payment was prescribed in the agreement and against the total
lump sum amount payable to the petitioner/claimant, an amount of
Rs.13,92,650/- was paid though the work was completed. The payment of
the balance amount was contested by the objector on the ground that since
certain recoveries were to be made, therefore, this amount of Rs.4,57,350/was not payable. For the recoveries which were claimed by Delhi Jal Board,
separate claims were filed, which were rejected except an amount of
Rs.55,778.40 out of which Rs.25,778.40 was awarded towards the balance
cost of cement which claim was admitted by the claimant and another amount
of Rs.25,000 was awarded to the objector for the minor works. However,
considering the entire facts and circumstances, the balance amount of
Rs.4,57,350/- was ordered to be paid to the claimant by the Arbitrator.

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

9.

Another claim of the petitioner was for 34,781.60 on account of

additional quantities used by the claimant for the extra work. The learned
Arbitrator has considered the fact that the claimant had submitted design duly
approved and in consonance with the requirement of the agreement.
However, during the execution of the work certain changes were claimed by
the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The Arbitrator has considered the terms
of the agreement and accordingly it has been held that the heavier design
could not be demanded without first finding the defects/faults in the
proposal/design submitted by the claimant. As the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi/Delhi Jal Board failed to produce any defects/faults in the proposal
submitted by the claimant and no record in respect thereof was produced,
therefore, for the additional work got done by the respondent from the
petitioner, it was held that the claimant was entitled for the extra work and
consequently the amount of Rs.34,781.60 was awarded.

10.

The next claim of the petitioner/claimant is for Rs.61,656.30 on

account of escalation for material and labour under clause 10(CC)based on
all India price index for the period 28th August, 1987 and till 28th February,
1988. Considering that base index for both material and labour was 16th

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 6 of 22

October, 1986 and considering that the base index will get shifted to 1st May,
1987, the learned Arbitrator has worked out an amount of Rs.56,057.40 for
the petitioner. The next claim of the petitioner/claimant was for Rs.76,645.40
on account of escalation for the material and labour under clause 10 (CC)
from 1st March, 1988 to 30th September, 1988. Considering the terms of the
contract, sub clause 10(cc), an amount of Rs.72,152.90 was worked out as
payable to the claimant.

11.

The next claim of the petitioner/claimant was for Rs.1,01,226.40 on

account of increase of labour rates from Rs.15.90 to 18.80 per day with effect
from 1st May, 1987.

The learned Arbitrator considered the claim of the

petitioner and held that the payment for extra cost as per notification of Delhi
Administration was automatically agreed to by the respondent/objector and
awarded an amount of Rs.1,01,226.40 on account of direction to the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi to produce the relevant portion of agreement
of Rithala work.

12.

In the next claim no.6 the claimant claimed Rs.78,632/- which was for

the release of security deposit. It was held that the security deposit became
due and was liable for refund one year after the date of completion as per the

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 7 of 22

term of agreement that is on 26th August, 1989 and therefore the claim of
Rs.78,632/- was allowed by the learned Arbitrator. The claimant had claimed
interest on the withheld amount of Rs.3,48,814/- @ 18% per annum,
however, interest of Rs.10,658/- @ 10% per annum was allowed for the
period 9th August, 1988 to 29th September, 1988. In another claim interest @
10% was allowed from 30th august, 1988 to 30th November, 1988 and future
interest also @ 10% was awarded.

The claimant had claimed a cost of

Rs.20,000/- which was dis-allowed and claim No.10 for Rs.1,85,000/- and
claim No.12 for Rs.1,85,000/- were rejected. Regarding claim No.11, it was
held that it is for the Municipal Corporation of Delhi which had to issue the
appropriate certificate.

13.

The objector had claimed an amount of Rs.1,85,000/- pursuant to

communication dated 28th March, 1989. The Arbitrator had entered upon
reference on 30th November, 1988 after the Arbitrator was appointed on 16th
November, 1988 and the letter dated 28th March, 1989 was issued thereafter.
It was also held that the claim was issued without serving any show cause
notice and without giving any due opportunity to the claimant and
consequently the claim was rejected. The claim was rejected on the ground
that there were certain inaccuracies in the contract documents. Another

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 8 of 22

counter claim for Rs.4,93,460.66 was on account of allegedly providing less
enforcement steel and RCC than the quantity stipulated in the contract
agreement. Learned Arbitrator had noticed the original letter duly signed by
the contractor which stipulates that in the event of reduction in the quantities
during the execution, the respondent/objector could have been entitled for
less enforcement steel and the RCC, however, since there was nothing to
show that that less enforcement steel and RCC were used as most of the
items claimed by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi were hidden items and
some of the portions of the record of measurement were not even signed or
verified by the Assistant Engineer and Executive Engineer and, therefore, the
counter claim for the recoveries on account of using less quantities of
enforcement steel and RCC was rejected.

14.

The respondent/Municipal Corporation of Delhi had claimed an amount

of Rs.25,778.40 on account of balance cost of cement which was accepted
by the petitioner claimant and, therefore, a sum of Rs.25,778.40 was
awarded.

The respondent/objector had also submitted a claim for

Rs.66,850/- consisting of 10 subheads amounting to Rs.74,850/- out of which
one item was withdrawn leaving the balance claim for Rs.66,850/- under nine
subheads. This claim of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi was on account

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 9 of 22

of minor works and as the structure made by the petitioner was found to be
sound and without any defects, only an amount of Rs.25,000/- was worked
out in favor of respondent and against the claimant and thus a total amount of
Rs.50,778.40 was awarded to the respondent/ objector.

15.

In the circumstances, the objection of the respondent that the

contractor had claimed an amount of Rs.7,94,660.10 only and the Arbitrator
has awarded a sum of Rs.8,22038.93 is without any substance. It is relevant
to notice that the Arbitrator was appointed by letter dated 16 th November,
1988 and along with the said letter there was no counter claim annexed for
adjudication, however the amount of final bill was claimed. According to the
said letter the Arbitrator was appointed to adjudicate the claims and counter
claims of the parties and since 10 claims were filed totaling for
Rs.12,19,387.70 along with interest and a sum of Rs.8,22,083.13 with future
interest @ 10%

has been awarded to the claimant and an amount of

Rs.50,778.40 has been awarded to the respondent/objector, therefore, a sum
of Rs.7,71,251.43 has been awarded. Therefore, even if by letter dated 4 th
October, 1988, an amount of Rs.7,94,660.10 has been claimed, an amount of
Rs.7,71,251.43 only has been awarded. If the contention of the objector is
that specific claims were not referred than even the counter claim were not

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 10 of 22

referred. This contention of the objector is also not sustainable because this
plea was not raised before the Arbitrator.

16.

This is no more res integra that the Court cannot substitute its own

decision and conclusion in interpretation of a contract which is a matter for an
arbitrator to decide. As appraisement of evidence by arbitrator is never a
matter which the Court questions and considers because the parties have
selected their own forum and the deciding forum must be conceded the
power of the appraisement of the evidence. Reliance for this can be placed
on 1992(2) RAJ 162 (SC) Himachal Pradesh Electricity Board Vs. R.J. Shah
and Co.; AIR 1990 SC 1340, M/s. Hind Builders vs. Union of India; AIR 1989
SC 890, Sudharshan Trading Co. Vs. Government of Kerala and Anr; AIR
1989 SC 1263, Food Corporation of India Vs. Joginder Pal Mohinder Lal and
Anr.; AIR 1971 SC 1646, Union of India Vs. Kalinga Construction Co., AIR
1999 (3) SC 3869, Arosan Enterprises Vs. Union of India.

17.

In AIR 1991 SC 945, S Harcharan Singh Vs Union of India; AIR 1992

SC 2192, Hindustan Construction Co Ltd. Vs State of J & K and (2003) 8
SCC 4, Continental Construction Ltd. Vs State of U.P it was held by the
Apex Court regarding

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

interpretation of the terms of the contract that the

Page 11 of 22

Court can not substitute its own interpretation with that of the arbitrator so
long as the interpretation of the arbitrator is a plausible one. If an
interpretation to a particular clause of agreement is given by the Arbitrator,
such an interpretation although may be erroneous, is final and binding and
Court does not have power to upset the findings. However, if Arbitrator
passes an award by ignoring the stipulation and prohibition contained in the
agreement, then Arbitrator travels beyond his jurisdiction. The objector is
unable to show as to which clause or term of the agreement has been
ignored by the Arbitrator.

18.

There are limits for judicial reviewability and the Courts exercise limited

jurisdiction in the proceeding for setting aside an award under Section 30 of
the Act. The Courts do not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the verdict of
an arbitrator and as such cannot go into the merits of the case nor the court
can re-appraise and re-examine the evidence led before the arbitrator. The
arbitrator has given sufficient and cogent reasons for deciding the claims of
the claimant and for rejecting counter claim nos.1 & 2 of the objector in the
present facts and circumstances. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that
the Arbitrator has exceeded in his jurisdiction. There does not seem to be an
error in his inferences. Even if it is presumed that there is an error in his

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 12 of 22

inference, the same shall be error within his jurisdiction and this Court will not
substitute its decision with the decision of an Arbitrator who has considered
all the material which is also relied on by the objector. Though a ground has
been taken that the Arbitrator has not considered a material document but no
such document has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the objector
Mr. Nayyar.

19.

The other objection raised against the award is that claim No.1 and the

counter claim No.2 are same. The counter claim of the objector has been
rejected by the Arbitrator on the ground that the measurement stated to have
been actually executed at the site had not been verified even by the Assistant
Engineer and Executive Engineer of Delhi Jal Board/objector and because
most of the items were hidden, therefore, the same could not be verified after
they were covered.

Since the measurement on the basis of which the

objection has been raised in respect of counter claim No.2 has been rejected
and as the Arbitrator is the final Arbiter, in these facts and circumstances, the
objection of the objector is not sustainable. It is settled that this Court should
not reverse the findings of facts for the reason that, in the opinion of the
Court, the Arbitrator reached wrong conclusions or failed to appreciate the
facts. In Hindustan Iron Co. v. K. Shashikant & Co., AIR 1987 SC 81 the

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 13 of 22

Apex Court had held that the award of the Arbitrator ought not to be set aside
for the reason that, in the opinion of the Court, the Arbitrator reached wrong
conclusions or failed to appreciate the facts. This well settled proposition of
law was reiterated in the decision of the Apex Court in Coimbatore District
Podu Thozillar Sangam vs. Balasubramania Foundary & Ors., AIR 1987 SC
2045 where it had been opined that it is only an error of law and not a
mistake of fact committed by the arbitrator which can be adjudicated in the
application/objection before the Court. If there is no legal proposition either in
the award or in any document annexed with the award which is erroneous
and the alleged mistakes or alleged errors, are only mistakes of fact and if the
award is made fairly, after giving adequate opportunity to the parties to place
their grievances in the manner provided by the arbitration agreement, the
award is not amenable to corrections of the Court. Similar opinions were
expressed in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. vs. Indian Carbon Ltd., (1988) 3 SCC
36; Jawahar Lal Wadhwa & Anr. vs. Haripada Chakroberty, (1989) 1 SCC 76;
Puri Construction Pvt. Ltd. vs. Union of India, (1989) 1 SCC 411;

Food

Corporation of India vs. Joginderpal Mohinderpal & Anr., AIR 1989 SC 1263
holding that a plausible view taken by the Arbitrator was not open to Court
interference. In Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs. M/s. Jagan Nath Ashok
Kumar & Anr., AIR 1987 SC 2316 the Court held that if the reasons appear

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 14 of 22

per se to be not unreasonable and irrational the Court ought not to reappreciate the evidence. In Hind Builders vs. Union of India, AIR 1990 SC
1340 the Court cautioned that where two views were possible it could not be
predicated that there was an error apparent on the face of the award. In
Bijendra Nath Srivastava vs. Mayank Srivastava & Ors. AIR 1994 SC 2562
the view expressed was that the reasonableness of reasons given by the
arbitrator was not open to challenge and that the proper approach would be
for the Court to support the award. Similarly, in Hindustan Construction Co.
Ltd. vs. Governor of Orissa & Ors., AIR 1995 SC 2189 it was reiterated that
the Court cannot re-appreciate the material on the record. In Trustees of the
Port of Madras vs. Engineering Constructions Corporation Ltd., (1995) 5 SCC
531 the decision of a Division Bench of the High Court of Madras, which had
reversed the Award on a question of fact and not on a question of law, was
set aside by the Supreme Court. After considering its previous decisions, the
Apex Court in B.V. Radha Krishna vs. Sponge Iron India Ltd., (1997) 4 SCC
693 again held that the Court could not substitute its own view in place of that
of the Arbitrator.

In Army Welfare Housing Organisation vs. Gautam

Construction & Fisheries Ltd. (1998) 7 SCC 290 the Court declined to vary an
award for the reason that without re-appreciating evidence it would not be
possible to fault the quantum awarded towards anticipated expenses. In any

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 15 of 22

case, it cannot be said considering all the facts that the Arbitrator has
committed error in excess of jurisdiction. If that be so then this Court will not
substitute its inferences with that of the Arbitrator. This objection of the
objector is, therefore, not sustainable.

20.

The objection regarding the claim No.2 that it was never raised in

terms of reference is also not sustainable in the facts and circumstances. No
such objection was taken before the Arbitrator. In any case the Arbitrator was
appointed to adjudicate the claims and counter claims between the parties
and the claims have been specifically raised before the Arbitrator. The claim
of Rs.34,731.60 has been allowed on the ground that that during the course
of work, the contractor was directed to give a heavier design which could be
demanded by the objector only on finding defects/faults with the design
submitted by the contractor/petitioner. Since the respondent/objector failed to
produce anything that the design submitted by the petitioner was defective or
inappropriate, therefore, any extra work got done by the respondent without
adjudicating the design submitted by the claimant, was liable to be paid for by
the respondent. These aspects have been considered by the Arbitrator and
an amount of Rs.34,731.60 has been awarded and on the objections raised
by the objector, the same cannot be interfered with for the reasons as

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 16 of 22

detailed hereinabove.

21.

The objection of the objector regarding claim Nos.3, 4 and 5 being

patently untenable being for the same claim of the petitioner,is not correct.
The claim No.4 is for escalation for the period from 1st March, 1988 to 30th
September, 1988 under Clause 10(CC) whereas the claim No.5 is on account
of extension of validity of the agreement which was agreed on the condition
that the labour rates were to be increased from Rs.15.90 to Rs.18.82 per day
with effect from 1st May, 1987 whereas the claim No.3 was for the period till
28th February, 1988.

Apparently, the claim Nos.3 and 4 are for different

periods and there is no overlapping. It is not disputed in view of the finding of
the Arbitrator that the escalation should be awarded in terms of clause
10(CC) of the agreement and consequently the objection of the objector is
not sustainable.

22.

The objection of the objector that the security of Rs.2,78,632/- was not

refundable as the said sum had been adjusted against the counter claim of
Rs.1,85,000/- on account of alleged compensation for delay cannot be
sustained in the facts and circumstances.

The counter claim of the objector

for Rs.1,85,000/- was rejected entailing refund of Rs.78,632/- claimed by the

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 17 of 22

claimant.

The objection, in the facts and circumstances, is not sustainable

and the award cannot be set aside on this ground.

23.

The objection of the objector that the arbitrator could not award the

interest is also not sustainable. The Apex Court in Secretary Irrigation
Department Vs G C Roy, (1992) 1 SCC 508 had over ruled the ratio of
Engineer (Irrigation) Balimela & ors. Vs.Abhaduta Jena & ors. (1988) 1 SCC
418 and had held that the Arbitrator is competent to award interest. Relying
on G.C Roy (supra) in Executive Engineer, Dhenkanal Minor Irrigation Division v. N.C.
Budharaj, (2001) 2 SCC 721 , at page 741 had held as under:
22 . There can be no controversy over the position that the Constitution Bench of this Court in G.C. Roy case while declaring that
the decision in Jena case does not lay down good law upheld, as a
consequence the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to award only pendente lite interest, as explained and highlighted in the subsequent decisions of this Court. When the claim involved for consideration in G.C. Roy case was only with reference to pendente lite
interest it cannot be expected of the court to travel outside, except for analysing the general principles, to academically adjudicate the other aspects of the matter also decided by the Bench
in Jena case and overrule the same on such other points too. Be
that as it may, the ratio or the basis of reasons and principles
underlying a decision is distinct from the ultimate relief granted
or manner of disposal adopted in a given case. While laying
down Principle ( i ) in para 43, it has been in unmistakable terms
declared (at SCC p. 533) that the basic proposition that a person
deprived of the use of money to which he is legitimately entitled has a
right to be compensated for the deprivation, by whatever name it may be
called, viz., interest, compensation or damages, “is as valid for the peri-

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 18 of 22

od the dispute is pending before the arbitrator as it is for the period prior to the arbitrator entering upon the reference”. The efficacy and binding nature of this declaration of law cannot be either diminished or
whittled down even on any known principle underlying the doctrine of
“stare decisis”. The same is the position with reference to Principles ( ii )
and ( iii ). It cannot be legitimately contended that these principles
would either vary or could be different in a case relating to the award of
interest for the pre-reference period and to assume such a contra position in juxtaposition would not only be destructive in nature but also illogical and self-contradictory resulting in grave miscarriage of justice.
Some of the very reasons and principles which weighed with
the Constitution Bench in G.C. Roy case to sustain the jurisdiction of
the arbitrator to award pendente lite interest in a claim arising
out of an agreement which does not also prohibit the grant of interest, in our view would equally suffice and provide sound basis of reasoning for upholding the power of the arbitrator to
award interest in respect of the pre-reference period, too. The
further fact that the decisions of this Court, including the Jena
case,, envisaged four circumstances or contingencies wherein
such interest for pre-reference period can be countenanced by
the arbitrator, is by itself sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the
arbitrator to entertain and consider the said claim also, and consequently there is no justification to thwart the same even at the
threshold denying the arbitrator power even to entertain the
claim as such. "

Therefore, it cannot be disputed any more that the Arbitrator had the
power to award the interest which has been awarded.

The claimant had

claimed the interest @ 18% per annum and after considering the facts and
circumstances the learned Arbitrator has awarded interest @ 10% per annum
which cannot be faulted in the facts and circumstances.

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

24.

The objection of the counter claimant/objector that the Arbitrator has

traveled beyond the admitted facts in rejecting the counter claim of the
respondent is also without any basis. No particulars have been given nor has
been argued as to how the Arbitrator has traveled beyond which facts. On
the bald objection of the respondent/objector that the counter claim has been
rejected illegally, the award rejecting the counter claim of the objector cannot
be set aside. There is nothing to show that the award is patently bad and is
liable to be set aside. The counter claim No.1 has also been rejected on the
ground that the order which is the basis for the counter claim No.1 was
issued without serving any show cause and without giving any particulars to
the claimant and it is contrary to the specific provision of the agreement and
the order was issued after the Arbitrator had entered upon reference. This
has also been noticed that two sets of conditions were filed before the
Arbitrator alleging to be the terms of the agreement. In one set of conditions
power to levy compensation was with the Chief Engineer and in the second
set of terms and conditions filed the power to levy compensation was with the
Municipal Engineer and

the Executive Engineer.

Since the respondent

themselves were not certain as to who was entitled to levy compensation, the
rejection of their counter claim cannot be faulted in the facts and
circumstances on this ground also. In any case, the claim of the claimant has

CS(OS) 1128 of 1990

Page 20 of 22

been upheld

except the claim of cost and claims nos, 11 & 13 and the

interest has also been awarded @10% per annum instead of @ 18% per
annum and the counter claim has been rejected except for an amount of
Rs.25,778.40 on account of balance cost of cement and a sum of Rs.25,000/out of the claim of Rs.66,850/- for minor claims.

25.

In the circumstances, objections raised by the objectors are without

any merit as the objector is unable to point out any patent illegality as the
Arbitrator has taken the material before him into consideration and has
arrived at just inference. The objections are, therefore, without any merit.

26.

I, therefore, dismiss the objections of the respondent being I.A no.

8459 of 1990 under section 30 & 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 and allow the
application of the petitioner under Section 14 & 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1940
and make the award dated 26th March, 1990 Rule of the Court. Consequently,
decree sheet be drawn in accordance with the award. I also award future
simple interest @10% per annum from the date of decree till realization of
decreetal amount on the net amount awarded by the Arbitrator on the claims
and counter claims of the parties excluding the amount of interest awarded

left to bear their own costs.
