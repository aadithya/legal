MADAN B. LOKUR, J.

The Revenue is aggrieved by an order dated 24th August,
2004 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench 'F' in
ITA No.1508/Del/1999 relevant for the assessment year 1992-93.

2.

The Assessee is a private limited company dealing in shares.

The Assessee came to know that the erstwhile HCL had entered into a
joint venture agreement with Hewlett Packard, USA and that in terms
thereof, shares of the erstwhile HCL would effectively be transferred to
HCL Ltd. and HCL HP Ltd. In fact, a scheme of arrangement to this
end was prepared and sanctioned under Sections 391 and 394 of the
Companies Act, 1956 by this Court. One of the terms of the scheme of
arrangement, with which we are concerned, provided that the
shareholders of the erstwhile HCL would receive, for 100 shares held by
each shareholder, 68 shares of HCL HP Ltd. and 32 shares of HCL Ltd.
The Assessee also came to know that Hewlett Packard, USA would buy
the shares of HCL HP Ltd. at a predetermined price of Rs.168.80 per
share.

ITA No. 1315/2006

page 2 of 11

3.

Based on this information, the Assessee purchased 7,77,100

shares of the erstwhile HCL. Out of these, the Assessee sold 1,29,600
shares on various dates leaving behind a balance of 6,47,500 shares of
the erstwhile HCL.

4.

In terms of the joint venture agreement, for these 6,47,500

shares the Assessee was allotted 4,40,300 shares of HCL HP Ltd. and
2,07,200 shares of HCL Ltd.

5.

Out of the 4,40,300 shares of HCL HP Ltd. held by the

Assessee, it sold to Hewlett Packard, USA 1,14,486 shares at the
predetermined price of Rs.168.80 per share.

6.

On these broad facts, two issues arose before the Assessing

Officer on the return of income filed by the Assessee. The first issue
concerned the high price paid by the Assessee for the purchase of shares
of the erstwhile HCL. The second issue concerned the valuation of the
closing stock of shares held by the Assessee.

ITA No. 1315/2006

page 3 of 11

7.

With regard to the first issue, the explanation given by the

Assessee for purchasing shares of the erstwhile HCL at a high price was
that it had purchased a large number of shares in large blocks from the
Delhi Stock Exchange. The Assessee submitted that necessary brokers'
notes were available and the payment made to the brokers was by
account payee cheques. In other words, according to the Assessee, the
transactions were above board. The Assessing Officer did not accept
this explanation and made an addition of Rs.89,29,635/- to the income
of the Assessee on account of the high price paid by the Assessee for the
purchase of shares of the erstwhile HCL.

8.

In so far as the second issue regarding valuation of the

closing stock of shares is concerned, the Assessee worked out the
average cost of the shares of HCL HP Ltd. at Rs.55.82 per share. The
Assessing Officer took the view that the market price for the shares of
HCL HP Ltd. was Rs.100/- per share and on this basis he made an
addition of Rs.1,40,94,839/- to the closing stock of shares held by the
Assessee.

ITA No. 1315/2006

page 4 of 11

9.

The Assessee challenged both the conclusions arrived at by

the Assessing Officer but the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)
[CIT (A)] by his order dated 31st October, 1995 rejected the challenge.
The Assessee then preferred an appeal before the Tribunal which passed
an order on 20th January, 1997. This order is of some importance
because the Tribunal remanded the matter to the file of CIT (A) for
passing a speaking order and also gave certain directions.

10.

The direction given by the Tribunal with regard to the first

issue concerning the addition of Rs.89,29,635/- on account of the high
price paid for the shares of the erstwhile HCL was that the CIT (A)
should examine the matter in the light of Section 40A(2) of the Income
Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) or determine whether the transaction entered
into by the Assessee with the brokers was a sham or bogus transaction.
The Tribunal was also of the view that a mere difference in the purchase
price was not enough to sustain an addition and the explanation given
by the Assessee needed to be examined.

11.

As regards the second issue relating to the valuation of the

ITA No. 1315/2006

page 5 of 11

closing stock of shares, the Tribunal directed the CIT (A) to examine the
matter in the light of Section 49(2) of the Act and also to take into
consideration the fact that shares of the erstwhile HCL were split up into
shares of HCL HP Ltd. and HCL Ltd.

12.

The CIT (A) then heard the matter on remand in terms of the

directions given by the Tribunal. In respect of the first issue, the CIT
(A) came to the conclusion that the Assessing Officer had taken the
price of the shares of the erstwhile HCL as prevalent in the Bombay
Stock Exchange while the Assessee had actually made purchases from
the Delhi Stock Exchange. Moreover, the transaction was confirmed by
the brokers and payments were made to the brokers through account
payee cheques. The transactions did not appear to be sham transactions
and the Assessing Officer had not brought on record any evidence to
show to the contrary or that any part of the consideration had come back
to the Assessee.

It was noted that the Assessee had some special

knowledge about the joint venture and the scheme of arrangement and
was, therefore, willing to pay a higher price to corner the shares. The
CIT (A) came to the conclusion that Section 40A(2) of the Act was

ITA No. 1315/2006

page 6 of 11

inapplicable inasmuch as the expenditure was neither excessive nor
unreasonable nor was the transaction a sham and, therefore, the addition
of Rs.89,29,635/- was incorrect and was deleted.

13.

With regard to the second issue of the addition of

Rs.1,43,29,635/- being the difference in the valuation of the closing
stock of shares on the basis of its market value, the CIT (A) examined
the case in the light of the provisions of Section 49(2) of the Act. He
noted that the Assessing Officer had completely lost sight of the scheme
of arrangement which required the splitting up of the shares of the
erstwhile HCL into the shares of HCL HP Ltd. and HCL Ltd. and that
the Assessee was entitled to value the shares of HCL HP Ltd. at the cost
price of Rs.55.82 per share rather than the undetermined market value of
Rs.100/- per share. It was, accordingly, held by the CIT (A) that the
addition was not tenable.

14.

Feeling aggrieved by the order passed by the CIT (A), the

Revenue preferred an appeal before the Tribunal.

ITA No. 1315/2006

page 7 of 11

15.

On a reading of the order of the Tribunal, we find that the

submissions before it really centred around the interpretation of the
earlier order dated 20th January, 1997 passed by the Tribunal when it
remanded the case to the CIT (A) and whether the directions given by
the Tribunal were correctly interpreted and implemented by the CIT (A).
In this regard, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the CIT (A)
correctly understood the earlier order passed by the Tribunal on 20th
January, 1997 and had fully implemented it.

16.

On the merits of the case, the Tribunal held that on the first

issue, the CIT (A) had clearly held that no case had been made out for
invoking the provisions of Section 40A(2) of the Act or to hold that the
transactions entered into by the Assessee were sham transactions. The
explanation given by the Assessee for purchasing the shares of the
erstwhile HCL at a high price was plausible and since the payments
made to the brokers were through account payee cheques, there was
enough material to negate all doubts about the transaction being a sham.
Moreover, there was nothing to show that any part of the amount came
back into the coffers of the Assessee.

ITA No. 1315/2006

page 8 of 11

17.

As regards the second issue, the Tribunal noted the

contention of the Departmental Representative that Section 49(2) of the
Act was not applicable. It, however, held that since the earlier order
passed by the Tribunal on 20th January, 1997 was accepted by the
Revenue, it was now not possible for the Departmental Representative
to contend that Section 49(2) of the Act was not applicable.

18.

The question whether the closing stock could be valued at

the cost price or the market value was conclusively settled, as noted by
the Tribunal, by the decision of the Supreme Court in Sakthi Trading
Co. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, [2001] 250 ITR 871 wherein it is
held:
“It is an established rule of commercial practice and
accountancy that where there is no discontinuation of
business, the closing stock is to be valued at cost or market
price, whichever is lower.”

On these facts, the Tribunal found that there was no error committed by
the CIT (A).

19.

We are of the view that the scope of enquiry before us is

ITA No. 1315/2006

page 9 of 11

rather limited in view of the order passed by the Tribunal. The only
question that really arises before us is whether the CIT (A) correctly
understood and implemented the earlier order passed by the Tribunal on
20th January, 1997. The Tribunal has found no error in the view taken
by the CIT (A). We do not find any reason to interfere in this regard
because this is essentially a matter of understanding the order of the
Tribunal which does not lead to any substantial question of law.

20.

On merits also, we find that the explanation given by the

Assessee with regard to the first issue was a plausible explanation and
could not be termed as perverse. The CIT (A) as well as the Tribunal
were quite justified in examining the explanation and coming to a
conclusion thereon which is that the transactions of purchasing shares of
the erstwhile HCL at a high price were not sham transactions. This is
essentially a question of fact which ought not to be disturbed unless it is
perverse which, in our opinion, is not so. Both the CIT (A) and the
Tribunal have considered the relevant facts and the submissions of the
parties in the right perspective. As regards the second question about
valuation of the closing stock, the Assessee was well within its rights to

ITA No. 1315/2006

page 10 of 11

value the closing stock at cost price which was lower than the market
price. The action of the Assessee is fully backed by the decision of the
Supreme Court in Sakthi Trading Co. and no fault can be found in the
stand taken by the Assessee in this regard.

21.

No substantial question of law arises for our consideration.

The appeal is dismissed.
