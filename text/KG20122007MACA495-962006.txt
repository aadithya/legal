This order shall dispose of MAC. App. Nos.437-38/2006
and 495-96/2006.
dated

Both appeals arise out of a common award

22.12.2005.

In

MAC.

App.

No.437-38/2006,

the

respondent/Manoj Kumar has received the injuries while MAC.
App.495-96/2006 concerns the death case.
The factual scenario in nutshell is as under:On 18.1.1998 at about 7.00 a.m., deceased Sh.Nathu
Ram was driving his two wheeler scooter bearing registration No.
DL 1S G 3973 along with his son, Master Manoj Kumar, who was
pillion rider of the said two wheeler scooter, to drop him at his
school at Punjabi Bagh via Rohtak Road. On their reaching near
Inder Enclave, a DTC bus came from opposite direction at a very
fast speed and the front right wheel of the bus dashed against the
scooter after crossing divider on the road, as a result, both of
them fell on the road. Sh.Nathu Ram became unconscious and his
son received injuries. They were shifted to Jia Lal Hospital from
the site of accident, where Sh.Nathu Ram was declared 'brought
dead in the hospital'.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have
perused the records.
MAC. APP. Nos.495-96/2006 & 437-38/2006

The sole contention of counsel for the appellant is that
there was no rash and negligent driving by the driver of the bus
owned by the appellant/DTC and the accident had occurred due to
the act of God and also on account of the deceased Nathu Ram
being totally unmindful on the road while driving his two wheeler
scooter.

Counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on the

English decision of Rylands Vs. Fletcher – 1968 LR 3 HL 330
especially in Para No.4 of the said judgment to contend that the
case in hand is covered under the said exceptional clause.
Counsel appearing for the respondent, on the other
hand, contended that the accident in question had occurred due
to the rash and negligent act on the part of the appellant and the
same cannot be termed as an act of God.

Counsel for the

respondent has relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court
reported in 2003 ACJ 1775, Divisional Controller, Karnataka
State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Mahadeva Shetty &
Anr.
In the present case, accident had occurred resulting
into death of one, Mr.Nathu Ram who was driving two wheeler
scooter and Manoj Kumar who was a pillion rider when the right
wheel of the offending vehicle with its drums and hub all of a
MAC. APP. Nos.495-96/2006 & 437-38/2006

Page 3 of 6

sudden came out and hit the scooterist coming from the opposite
direction of the other road and due to the impact of the said
wheel, both the victims fell down on the road and received serious
injuries.

Mr.Manoj Kumar who received injuries gave his

deposition as PW1 and narrated the sequence of events which led
to causing the said accident. It may be true that the driver of the
offening vehicle might not have been rash and negligent in driving
the bus but the prime question would be whether the accident
had occurred due to the rash and 'negligent act' of the appellant
in driving the offending vehicle.
I do not find any justification in the argument of
counsel for the appellant that since there was no evidence on
record to prove rash and negligent driving on the part of the
driver of the DTC bus, therefore, the appellant cannot be held
liable for compensation. Such an argument would mean that the
owner or driver of the vehicle did not owe any duty to the public
and they are free to bring the vehicle on road in whatever
condition the same may be. Any vehicle on the road has to be in
a prefect and sound condition so that under no circumstance such
a vehicle can become a cause of hitting or hurting others on the
road to endanger the precious lives of the people.
MAC. APP. Nos.495-96/2006 & 437-38/2006

There is

Page 4 of 6

certainly a great lapse and negligence on the part of the appellant
in not properly ensuring the worthiness of the offending vehicle
and had such care and caution been taken, then, the said
accident would not have happened.

The Tribunal has rightly

discussed the principle of strict liability as propounded in the case
of Kaushnuma Begum & Ors. Vs. New India Assurance Co.
Ltd., 2001 AD (SC) 5, and the well settled rules laid down in the
authoritative case of Rylands Vs. Fletcher.

The mechanical

failure or defect in the bus which, led to the front right wheel with
its drum and hub coming out from the running bus cannot be
referred to as an act of God or vis majure. It would be relevant to
refer to Para 9 of the Apex Court judgment reported in Mahadeva
Shetty's case (supra) which is reproduced as under:“9. The expression “act of God” signifies the
operation of natural forces free from human
intervention, such as lightning, storm etc. It
may include such unexpected occurrences of
nature as severe gale, snowstorms, hurricanes,
cyclones, tidal waves and the like. But every
unexpected wind and storm does not operate
as an excuse from liability, if there is a
reasonable possibility of anticipating their
happening. An act of God provides no excuse
unless it is so unexpected that no reasonable
human foresight could be presumed to
anticipate the occurrence, having regard to the
conditions of time and place known to be
prevailing. For instance, where by experience
MAC. APP. Nos.495-96/2006 & 437-38/2006

Page 5 of 6

of a number of years, preventive action can be
taken, Lord Westbury defined the act of God (
damnum fatale in Scotch Laws) as an
occurrence which no human foresight can
provide against and of which human prudence
is not bound to recognize the possibility. This
appears to be the nearest approach to the true
meaning of an act of God. Lord Blancaburgh
spoke of it as “an irresistible and unsearchable
providence nullifying our human effort”.

In the light of the above discussion, I do not find any
infirmity in the impugned award passed by the Tribunal.

The

appellant is liable to compensate the respondents under the rule
of strict liability for their negligent act. The amount of award, if
not released in favour of the respondents/claimants shall be
released forthwith in both the appeals.
Dismissed.
