KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
Aggrieved with the accident by the bulldozer of the
MCD, the present cross appeals have been filed, one by the MCD
bearing MAC. App. No.948-49/2006 and the other by the
claimants bearing MAC. App. 1017/2006 assailing the findings of
the Tribunal.

Both the appeals can be disposed of by this

common order.
Before dwelling on the merits of the case, it would be
appropriate to give brief facts of the case as under:On 5.2.2005, Sh.Jabid Sekh was gathering the garbage
from the MCD Garbage Dump at Bhalswa Dairy, suddenly,
bulldozer bearing registration No. G-10241, which was driven in a
very rash and negligent manner, ran over his left leg.

He was

removed to BJRM Hospital from the site of accident, where his leg
was operated upon and was amputated below knee.

A claim

petition was filed on 2.5.2003 before the Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal and an award was made on 15.7.2006. Aggrieved with
the said award, the aforesaid cross appeals have been filed.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at
considerable length and have perused the records.
Ms.Smita Shankar, counsel appearing for the MCD in
MAC. APP. Nos.948-49/2006 & 1017/2006

Page No.2 of 8

MAC. App. No.948-49/2006 contends that there is a manifest
contradiction on the part of the claimant victim in disclosing his
correct age as well as the correct income. Referring to the claim
petition itself, where in Para 3, the age of the claimant has been
stated to be of 27 years, while in main Para 4 of the same very
petition, the claimant has stated his age as 28 years. Similarly, in
Para 6 the income has been stated as Rs.4,000/- per month while
in main Para 10 of the petition it has been stated as Rs.5,000/- per
month. The contention of counsel for MCD is that the claimant
victim himself has been inconsistent in his stand, therefore, no
reliance can be placed on the truthfulness of the claim petition
itself.

The next contention of counsel for MCD is that the

respondent/claimant admittedly had entered the prohibited area
where he was allegedly debarred to go, therefore, the MCD cannot
be held liable for the folly and wrong act of the claimant who
entered the said prohibited zone at his own risk and peril.
Supplementing this very contention, counsel further contends that
even in that area, no such accident could have occurred that too
involving bulldozer of the MCD which is generally not driven at a
high speed, usually at the speed of 3 to 4 km/hr. Counsel also
contends that the claimant had examined himself without
MAC. APP. Nos.948-49/2006 & 1017/2006

Page No.3 of 8

producing any other eye witness, therefore, the said supporting
testimony of the claimant could not have been believed. Counsel
also contends that the claimant did not render any income proof
and also details of expenses incurred in the treatment of injuries.
Counsel also contends that even the disability certificate produced
by the claimant injured of Haldia S.D Hospital, Midnapor, West
Bengal,

apparently

shows

that

the

said

certificate

dated

19.5.2005 was procured by the claimant injured on 19.5.2005.
Refuting the said contention of counsel for the MCD,
counsel for the claimant in MAC. App. No.1017/2006 contends
that FIR No.71/05 was duly registered against the driver of the
bulldozer, therefore, it cannot be said that the driver was not
driving the bulldozer in a rash and negligent manner.

Counsel

further contends that after the accident, the claimant injured was
admitted in Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital and MLC bearing
No.17342of the said hospital has been filed and proved on record.
Counsel further

contends

that

because

the said

disability

certificate was obtained from hospital at Midnapore when the
claimant went to his said village,

the truthfulness of the said

occurrence of the accident and a subsequent injury suffered by
the claimant cannot be disbelieved.
MAC. APP. Nos.948-49/2006 & 1017/2006

Counsel further contends
Page No.4 of 8

that the Court has taken into consideration the minimum wages
and that is only because the claimant injured failed to prove his
income as stated by him in the claim petition.

As regards the

inconsistency in the petition, the contention of counsel for the
claimant injured is that the same may be due to typographical
error on the part of the typist, therefore, the same cannot have
any glaring effect on the merits of the case.
The accident in question involves a young man of 27
years of age, who was doing the job of rag picking so as to earn
his livelihood. His left leg has been amputated due to the multiple
injuries received by him in the said accident. It is no doubt true
that the said rag-picker should not have entered in the aforesaid
prohibited place, the dumping place, but that cannot mean that
due to one's economic condition and poverty one enters that area
so he has no right to protect himself. The driver of the bulldozer
should have been alive and conscious to the surrounding
circumstances so as to avoid any kind of such accident. The FIR
has been duly registered against the driver of the offending
vehicle, therefore, the registration of an FIR itself is sufficient to
prove negligence on the part of the driver of the offending vehicle
so far as compensation case is concerned.
MAC. APP. Nos.948-49/2006 & 1017/2006

The contention of
Page No.5 of 8

counsel for the MCD on this aspect is repelled. The injury of the
claimant has been duly proved by him by proving the medical
records including the MLC and the disability certificate as well.
Perusal of disability certificate shows that the address of the
claimant injured has been shown therein of Nandigram itself,
therefore, no fault can be found with the said certificate. Simply
the same was issued by the hospital at Midnapore during which
period the claimant was residing at his village.
As regards salary, the contention of counsel for the
MCD is that no income proof was furnished by the claimant. I find
this argument equally devoid of any merit as the Tribunal has not
believed the income so stated by the claimant injured and in the
absence of any documentary evidence placed by the claimant
injured, the recourse has been made to the Minimum Wages Act
to assess the income of the claimant. Even on this ground, I do
not find any force.
In the light of the above discussion, the appeal filed by
the MCD is dismissed.
In the cross appeal bearing MAC. APP. No.1017/2006,
the claimant injured has claimed enhancement in compensation.
The contention of counsel for the claimant is that the Tribunal has
MAC. APP. Nos.948-49/2006 & 1017/2006

Page No.6 of 8

not taken into consideration the raise in the minimum wages.
Counsel for the claimant has placed reliance on the judgment of
this Court reported in 116 (2005) DLT 442, Mohd. Israil Vs. DTC
& Ors., to claim the benefit of increase in the minimum wages
under the Minimum Wages Act. Counsel for the claimant has also
claimed compensation for the loss of amenities suffered by the
claimant injured due to the amputation of his leg. I find myself in
agreement with the counsel for the claimant injured.

Once the

Court has taken into consideration , the minimum wages for
assessing the income of the claimant, therefore, the increase in
the minimum wages has also to be considered.

It has already

been held by this Court that the increase in the minimum wages
are not akin to future prospects. It is noticed that the minimum
wages are generally increased once in a year and the same gets
more than doubled at least in a period of 10 years. The increase
in the minimum wages is considered so as to neutralize the falling
power of rupee due to inflation. The multiplier of 18 has been
applied in the present case, therefore, safely the minimum wages
of the claimant would have at least doubled during this period.
The minimum wages of the unskilled worker as on 01.1.2005 was
Rs.3044.90 and if the same are taken to have doubled, the same
MAC. APP. Nos.948-49/2006 & 1017/2006

Page No.7 of 8

would come to Rs.6089.80, the same can be taken to be
Rs.6,100/- as a round figure. From this amount, taking average of
both the said incomes, the monthly income of the claimant injured
would come to Rs.4572/- and annual income would be Rs.
54,864/-. After applying multiplier of 18 and further considering
70% disability, the loss of earning of the claimant injured would
come out as Rs. 6,91,286.40. The loss of amenities will be
enhanced to Rs.75,000/- in MAC. App. No.1017/2006.
With these directions, the present appeals are disposed
of.
