1.
This writ petition has been filed by the petitioners
who claim to be permanent resident of house built in
khasra no.197/2 in extended Lal Dora of the village
Burari. The petitioners have submitted that one Shri
Surinder Singh has a residential house in Khasra
No.193/1 on the Western side of their property while
WP (C) No.10943-45/2006

Page No.1

some other villagers have residential accommodation
in Khasra No.196 on the Northern side of their
property. So far as the Southern side is concerned, it
is further contended that some other villagers have
property which is located in Khasra No.198/2.

Thus

on the contention that the petitioner's house is
landlocked by the properties of other villagers except
on the Eastern Side, the present writ petition has been
filed urging that on the Eastern side, there was a
passage described as "Rasta" which was located in
Khasra No.197/1 and 198/1 which was being used by
the petitioners for the last 50 years.
2.

The consolidation proceedings in village Burari

are stated to have been commenced and concluded in
the year 1980-1981.

The plot of the petitioners in

Khasra No.197/2 was made Kayam at its present
position.

Before

and

after

the

consolidation

proceedings, the Khasra No.197/1 & 198/1 were being
used as "Rasta" which is the only passage available to
the petitioners.
3.

I find that it is an admitted position that Khasra

No.197/1 has been reflected as "Rasta" in the revenue

WP (C) No.10943-45/2006

Page No.2

records more particularly in the khatauni of 1985-86
and 1993-94 and also in the Khasra Girdawari of the
year 2004-2005.
4.

A grievance has been expressed that on a

complaint of one Shri Adesh Tyagi made to the Deputy
Commissioner (North) to the effect that Khasra
No.197/1 and Khasra No.198/1 were declared as Gram
Sabha plots at the time of consolidation of the village
Burari

and

that

some

officials

of

the

revenue

department manipulated to show these plots as a
"Rasta‚Äù, a prayer was made for correcting the
revenue record and including the lands with walls.
5.

Mr. Sudhir Nandrajog, learned counsel appearing

for

the

petitioner,

has

contended

that

on

this

complaint, no notice was issued to the petitioner even
though the petitioner was the person effected by the
action of the respondent.

Without hearing the

petitioner, an order dated 8th June, 2006 was passed
by the Deputy Commissioner (North), directing the
revenue authorities to make

the corrections in the

revenue records and enter the Khasra No.197/1 &
198/1 of the village Burari as Gram Sabha land instead

WP (C) No.10943-45/2006

Page No.3

of the Gram Sabha Rasta.
6.

Immediately on gaining knowledge of the orders

passed by the Deputy Commissioner (North), the
petitioner moved an application dated 15th June, 2006
for recall/reconsideration of the order but no action
was taken thereon. This writ petition has been filed
on the grievance that the revenue authorities were
trying to take possession of Khasra No.197/1 & 198/1
and are threatening to raise construction over the
same which would result in completely blocking the
only passage to the petitioner's property.

The writ

petitioner has urged that the order passed by the
Deputy Commissioner (North) is arbitrary, illegal and
wholly without jurisdiction.
7.

The respondents have appeared in answer to the

notice to show cause and have opposed the writ
petition.

It has been contended by the respondent

nos.1 to 4 that consolidation proceedings of village
Burari took place from 1976 -1982 and that Khasra
Nos.197/1 & 198/1 were agricultural land with old
khasra number.
Khasra

During consolidation

No.197/2

WP (C) No.10943-45/2006

was

carved

out

operations,
from

Page No.4

Khasra

No.197/1 & 198/1 and allotted as Gram Sabha land.
The respondents dispute that these khasras were
rastas and that it was on account of an error and
omission that these were referred as Gram Sabha
Rasta in the revenue records. It has been admitted
by the respondents that the action to correct the
same was taken by the authorities pursuant to the
complaint received from Shri Adesh Tyagi, respondent
no.5 herein. In order to support their contention that
these khasras were never rasta/pathway, it has been
submitted that if a piece of land is reflected as rasta,
it is assigned as only one khasra number and never
two khasra numbers as in the present case.
8.

Mr. R.S. Tomar, learned counsel appearing for the

respondent No.5, has supported the stand of the
respondent nos.1 to 4 and further contended that the
officials

of

the

respondents

having

created

the

revenue authorities, the only remedy available to the
petitioner is by way of statutory appeal under Section
42 of the Consolidation Act, 1948.
9.

I have heard learned counsel for the parties and

perused the available record.

WP (C) No.10943-45/2006

Whatsoever be the

Page No.5

position, I find that the petitioners have taken a
categorical stand that the only passage to his
property is located on what has been reflected as
Gram Sabha Rasta in the revenue entries for Khasra
Nos.197/1 & 198/1. While the respondent nos.1 to 4
in the counter affidavit have disputed that the same
was a rasta (pathway), however, I find that there is no
denial to the fact that this was the only passage to the
property of the petitioners and that this land is
vacant. There is also no contest before this court to
the fact that this was being used as "rasta" for the last
50 years. Furthermore, it is an admitted position that
the revenue records have reflected these khasras as
Gram Sabha Rasta.

Khasra No.197/1 has been

referred as Rasta in the revenue records filed before
this court for the year 1985-86 and even in 20042005. In the copy of the Khatauni of 1993-94, Khasra
No.197/1

measuring

as

0.7

bighas

and

198/1

admeasuring 0.8 bighas have been reflected as Gram
Sabha (Concrete Road & Rasta Jata). Again under the
Girdawari in the year 2004-2005, Khasra No.197/1
(007 bighas) and Khasra No.198/1 (008 bighas) have

WP (C) No.10943-45/2006

Page No.6

been reflected as Gram Sabha Rasta Jata.
10. In my view, these revenue entries cannot be
simply brushed aside as an error or omission or as
being without any substance.
11. In the afore-noticed facts, it also cannot be
contended that there would be no impact of the order
on the present petitioner.

In answer to query by the

court, it has been pointed out that the main road for
the area is located in Khasra No.199. In case Khasra
Nos.197/1 & 198/1 are blocked, there is no access to
the property of the petitioner inasmuch as land of
Khasra No.198/2 falls between the petitioner's plot
and the road on Khasra no.199.
12. The grievance of the petitioner is that he was
never heard and permitted to place the correct facts
before the Deputy Commissioner (North) whose order
is, therefore, claimed to be without jurisdiction and in
violation of the principles of natural justice.
13. I find force in this contention.

Perusal of the

respondent's notings dated 30th March, 2006, 3rd
April, 2006 & 20th April, 2006 in the concerned files
contains an admission that the subject land has been

WP (C) No.10943-45/2006

Page No.7

shown as the passage in the revenue records. The
notings also show that the respondent no.5 joined the
complainant in their considerations.

No efforts have

been made to join the petitioner and it would appear
to verify the position on the site.
14. In

this

background,

the

grievance

of

the

petitioners who are only seeking an opportunity to be
joined in the consideration by the respondent and an
opportunity of hearing is certainly, not without merit.
The rights of the petitioners being effected, the
petitioners are entitled to make representation and to
be heard in the consideration by the respondents.
15. This writ petition is allowed. The order dated 8th
June,

2006

passed

by

the

learned

Deputy

Commissioner (North), respondent no.2, is hereby set
aside. A direction is issued to the respondent no.2 to
issue notice afresh to the concerned parties including
the petitioners who shall be aforded an opportunity to
make written and oral representation before passing a
speaking order afresh in the matter.
16. Pending consideration of the matter by the
respondent no.2, the passage/rasta of the petitioner

WP (C) No.10943-45/2006

Page No.8

over Khasra Nos.197/1 & 198/1 shall not be interfered
with.
This writ petition is allowed in the above terms.
