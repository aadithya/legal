1.

This appeal has impugned the judgment and decree dated

20.11.2006 which had endorsed the finding of the trial judge
dated 01.9.2005 whereby the suit filed by the plaintiff Ram
Manohar seeking possession of the suit property bearing no.4740,
23 Darya Ganj, Ansari Road with damages and mesne profits had
been decreed in his favour.
2.

It is in dispute that the during the pendency of the

RSA No.54/2007

proceedings the possession of the suit property had been handed
over to the plaintiff; this was on 08.8.2005.
3.

None has appeared for the respondent in spite of service.

On behalf of the appellant, it has been urged that the judgment of
the trial court is a perversity; the trial judge has granted mesne
profits @ `18000/- w.e.f. 01.6.1999 to 31.5.2002 thereafter the
enhanced amount of `9600/- had been awarded w.e.f. 01.6.2002 to
3.5.20005 and thereafter @ `11,500/- per month w.e.f. 1.6.2005
up to the date of delivery of the suit property. It is pointed out
that these enhanced slabs are a figment of the imagination of the
judge; how and in what manner he has arrived at this conclusion
is unexplained. It is pointed out that the plaintiff had in fact led
no evidence on this score which was his bounden duty to do so; in
the absence of which mesne profits awarded at the aforenoted
rates which had since been endorsed by the first appellant court
are a perversity and call for interference. Learned counsel for the
appellant placed reliance upon a judgment of the Apex Court
reported in AIR 2004 SC 1983 Union of India Vs. Banwari Lal &

Sons; as also another judgments of this Court report in 122(2005)
DLT National Radio & Electronic Co.Ltd. Vs. Motion Pictures

Association and 157(2009) DLT 541 Sonia & Co. (Pvt.) Ltd. Vs.
RSA No.54/2007

M/s Saboo Cylinders Pvt. Ltd. to support his submission that
mesne profits could not have been awarded in this manner as
there was no evidence forthcoming by the plaintiff.
4.

This is a second appeal. It has been admitted on 12.8.2009

and the following substantial question of law was formulated:
“Whether the trial court followed the principles of law governing
the fixation of mesne profits while granting mesne profits on
increased slabs to the respondent?”

5.

Record has been perused. The Ram Mohan Tewari karta of

plaintiff had entered into witness box as PW-1. In his affidavit by
way of evidence he had while reiterating the averments made by
him in the plaint had in para 5 stated that even after the
termination of the lease which had come to an end by efflux of
time on 31.7.1997 the defendants continued to occupy the suit
property; they had failed to pay agreed enhanced amount of

`6250/-. He had terminated the tenancy of the defendants with a
legal notice dated 30.4.1999 terminating their tenancy w.e.f.
31.5.1999.

The said notice had been proved as Ex.PW-1/A.

In

para 7 he had deposed that the defendants are liable to pay
damages for their unauthorized use and occupation; the interest
free security of `1,00,000/- was adjusted against the arrears of
RSA No.54/2007

Page 3 of 8

rent; in para 8 it has been averred that mesne profits @ `35,000/w.e.f. 01.6.1999 are payable.

No cross-examination had been

effected of this witness as the evidence of the defendants had
been struck down.

The defendants led no evidence.

The only

evidence which was thus available with the court is the statement
of the plaintiff.

The lease deed dated 09.3.1994 although

unregistered was an admitted document. In terms of this lease
deed the tenancy was to expire on 30.4.1997; it was extended for
another period of three years i.e. up to 30.7.1998 subject to
enhancement of rent @ 25%. This was an admitted position. The
initial rate of interest was `5000/- and thereafter enhanced to rent
of `6250/- per month.

Defendants had also made payment of

`12500/- for two months at the rate of `6250/- per month. The
court coupled with the testimony of PW-1 has also taken judicial
notice of the locality in which the suit premises is situated i.e.
Ansari Road, Darya Ganj being a prime commercial area of Delhi
as also the area which had been let out to the defendants i.e.
comprising of 500 sq. yards, Ist Floor. The court was of the view
that mesne profits @ `8000/- per month be awarded from
01.6.1999 up to 31.5.2002;
RSA No.54/2007

20% enhancement was awarded
Page 4 of 8

thereafter for the next three years w.e.f. 01.6.2002 to 31.5.2005;
these damages were awarded @ `9600/- per month.

The last

enhancement at the rate of 20% i.e. at the rate of `11500/- was
awarded as damages w.e.f. 01.6.2005 till the date of delivery of
the possession. The court had relied upon the terms of the lease
deed which had stipulated enhancement of 25% after every three
years.

This was coupled with the testimony of PW-1; judicial

notice of the locality and the area of the suit property had led to
the award of damages at the aforenoted rates.
6.

The finding returned by the trial judge and endorsed in the

impugned judgment were dealt with while disposing of issue no.2.
The said finding reads as follows:
“Onus to prove this issue was again upon the pltff and in
order to discharge the same plaintiff has categorically placed
reliance on the unregistered Lease Deed Ex.PW1/1 and since the
clause relating to enhancement of rent payable by the defts does
constitute a collateral purpose, hence the Lease Deed though
unregistered can also be looked into for this purpose and in Clause
7 thereof, it has been clearly provided that in case if the defdts
failed to vacate the property by 30.4.97 then they shall be allowed
to continue and remain in possession of the suit property for
further period of three months i.e. upto 30.7.1997 but they shall
have to pay the rent at the enhanced rate with 25% enhancement
in the amount of actual rent. Thus, from the aforesaid clause it
becomes amply clear that after 30.4.97, the defdts were liable to
pay to the plaintiff, the rent @ Rs.6,250/- per month. Further a
Page 5 of 8

RSA No.54/2007

perusal of Ex.PW-1/2 makes it amply clear that the payments were
made by the defdts to the tune of Rs.12,500/- for two months
pertaining to the months of May and June, 1997 which also
establishes the fact of the payment of rent by them at the rate of
Rs.6250/- per month. Further, in an application filed by the defdt
on record, which also finds its mention in the order sheet dated
7.12.2002, the defdts themselves had shown their readiness to pay
the rent at the admitted rate of Rs.6250/- per month to the
plaintiff.
Although no independent evidence has been adduced by
the plaintiff on record nor any independent witness has been
examined by him in order to prove his entitlement to the
damages/mesne profits @ Rs.25,000/- per month ad claimed by
him in the present suit, but in rebuttal, the defdts have also failed
to lead any evidence and even their defence was directed to be
struck off vide my orders dated 26.2.05 and against the said order
no appeal or any other legal remedy has been exhausted by the
defdts, hence same has become final now.
However, still keeping in view the interest of justice and
taking a judicial notice of the locality in which the suit premises is
situated which happens to be one of the prime commercial areas
of Delhi and also taking into consideration the area of the suit
property which was let out to the deftds by the plaintiff and after
taking a judicial notice of the rates of rent prevailing in the said
locality, I am of the considered opinion that interest of justice shall
be best served if the plaintiff is awarded mesne profits/damages @
Rs.8000/- per month with effect from 1.6.99 i.e. the date from
which the defdts were liable to vacate the suit property in terms of
the legal notice dated 30.4.99 terminating their tenancy with
effect from the midnight of 31.5.99 with further enhancement at
the rate of 20% after every three years.
Accordingly, in view of my aforesaid lengthy discussion, I
hereby hold that plaintiff is entitled to mesne profits/damages @
RSA No.54/2007

Page 6 of 8

Rs.8000/- per month with effect from 1.6.99 till 31.5.2002 and
thereafter @ Rs.9,600/- per month with effect from 1.6.2002 till
31.5.2005 and thereafter @ Rs.11,500/- (round off) per month with
effect from 1.6.05 till the date of actual handing over of vacant,
peaceful and actual physical possession of the suit property by
defdts to the plaintiff. the issue is disposed off accordingly.”

7.

This finding does not in any manner suffer from any

perversity. This was not a case of no evidence. The logic adopted
by the trial judge was based on the admitted document which had
been executed between the parties i.e. the lease deed dated
09.3.1994 which had stipulated enhancement of rent of 25% after
every three years and it was also acted upon by the parties.
8.

The judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the

appellant do not advance his case. In the judgment of Union of

India (supra) the court had laid down the guidelines on how
quantum of damages should be assessed by an arbitrator; an
arbitrator is a quasi judicial authority. That apart in that case the
court had noted that damages could not have been awarded up to
31.3.1993 as it was under the permission of the court that the
appellant had been allowed to use and occupy the property up to
this date. The second judgment of National Radio (supra) was a
case where the plaintiff had not led any evidence on the damages
RSA No.54/2007

Page 7 of 8

claimed by him; the third judgment of Sonia & Co. (supra) was
also a case where the judgment had noted that there was no
evidence led by the plaintiff for his claim of damages.
9.

This court is sitting in a second appeal.

Findings of fact

cannot be lightly interfered with; unless and until there is a
perversity. No such perversity has been pointed out. There is no
scope for interference.
10.

Substantial question of law is answered in favour of the

respondents and against the appellant.

The appeal as also

pending applications are dismissed.
