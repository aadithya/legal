1.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order

dated 19th October, 2005 passed by the learned Single Judge
whereby the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition filed
by the appellant.
2.

The appellant applied under the Rohini MIG Residential

Scheme for allotment of a plot in 1981.
demand letter dated 5th September, 2003,

Vide allotment-cumthe appellant was

informed that he has been allotted plot No.279, Pocket C-V,

LPA No.450/2006

Sector 28, Rohini Phase – IV, Delhi in pursuance of a draw held on
11th June, 2003, at a premium of Rs.3,71,520/-. As per the said
allotment-cum-demand letter the appellant was required to pay
Rs.1,17,263/- by 11th November, 2003 and Rs.1,85,760/- by 10th
January, 2004 and Rs.55,728/- was to be paid when possession
was to be offered by the DDA.
3.

It is an established fact that there was a delay of 178 days

and 118 days in making payment of the first and the second
instalments respectively. So far the payment of Rs.55,728/- is
concerned, a request was made by the appellant on 30th April,
2004 for extension of time for making the said payment. As per
the clause in the demand-cum-allotment letter, the said allotment
was liable to be automatically cancelled if payment was not made
within the period prescribed. The records reveal that a sum of
Rs.55,000/- was deposited on 29th September, 2004 in the
account of the DDA on account of the balance payment, which
was required to be paid when possession was to be offered by the
DDA as per the allotment letter.

However, as possession of the

plot in question was not handed over to the appellant, he filed a
writ petition before the learned Single Judge thereby seeking

LPA No.450/2006

page 2 of 5

issuance of a writ of mandamus directing the DDA to hand over
possession of the said plot.
4.

The said writ petition was listed before the learned Single

Judge on 19th October, 2005. The learned Single Judge perused
the records and noticed that both the aforesaid payments were
made belatedly.

Not only this, the learned Single Judge also

noticed some startling facts as per which the petitioner and some
other allottees, in respect of the same draw of allotment, were not
genuine persons, inasmuch as it was apprehended that property
dealers appeared to be behind the whole scandal and in all
probability the original allottees had sold the allotments. It is
recorded by the learned Single Judge that it is a highly improbable
coincidence that over 13 persons residing in 13 different colonies
would go to the same bank i..e South Indian Bank Ltd. for
preparation of the pay orders and deposit the same in their
respective accounts with DDA. It was also noticed by the learned
Single Judge that the delay in making the payments in all the
aforesaid cases, as sought for, was not condoned by the DDA.
Consequently, considering the facts and circumstances of the
case, the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition filed by
the appellant.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the present appeal

is filed on which we heard the learned counsel appearing for the
parties and have also perused the records placed before us.
6.

During the pendency of the appeal, when the matter was

listed on 14th September, 2006, learned counsel appearing for the
DDA contended that the appellant and eight others have pooled
the money from different sources and purchased the plot which
they wanted to have at predetermined rate and, thereafter to sell
them in the open market at a premium. As the said position was
denied by the learned counsel for the appellant,

this court

directed the appellant to file an affidavit in this court to show as
to how the payment of the plot in question was made by him
indicating the source of payment, name of depositors, name of
banks and with all relevant details within four weeks. Thereafter,
the matter was listed from time to time but till date the appellant
has not filed the said affidavit as directed by this court. The said
conduct on the part of the appellant clearly gives rise to a doubt,
as was expressed by the learned Single Judge as well, that the
appellant is not a genuine person. We have also gone through
the graphic representation of the payments, deemed draft
numbers, names and addresses of the persons and the dates on
LPA No.450/2006

page 4 of 5

which the demand drafts were issued as mentioned in the
impugned order. In the light of the said observations, we agree
with the decision of the learned Single Judge that the appellant is
not a genuine person and in all probability the original allottees
have sold the allotments. The decision of the respondent, in our
opinion, cannot therefore be faulted.
7.

Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.
