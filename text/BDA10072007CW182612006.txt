CORAM:HON'BLE MR JUSTICE BADAR DURREZ AHMED
1.

Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed
to see the judgment ?

2.

To be referred to the Reporter or not ?

3.

Whether the judgment should be reported in Digest ?

BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J
1.

In all these petitions, the prayers sought are virtually identical. In

the first instance, the petitioners have sought the quashing of notification No.P19011/9/2001-IOC dated 06.09.2006 on the ground that the same is not
applicable to the petitioners' retail outlets / petrol pumps because the petitioners
/ petitioners' nominees had been given the retail outlets under the land owner
category pursuant to the Policy / MDPM No.319/2002 dated 08.10.2002. The
petitioners have also sought the issuance of an appropriate writ, order or
direction to restrain the respective oil companies from enforcing /
implementing the said notification dated 06.09.2006.

Alternatively, the

petitioners have also prayed that, if, for any reason, the reliefs sought for above
are not granted by this court, the respondent oil companies be directed to
surrender to the petitioners and the petitioners be put in actual and physical
possession of the lands belonging to them within a time frame to be fixed by
this court. This alternative prayer has been made on the ground that if the
WP(C)18261-63/2006&Ors

Page No.23 of 32

object of taking the land on lease for allotment of retail outlets for the
petitioners and / or their nominees would have been frustrated, the the lands
ought to be returned to the petitioners, who are the owners thereof.

2.

In these petitions, there are four oil companies, namely, IBP

Company Ltd (IBP), Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum
Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited
(HPCL), against whom the reliefs have been claimed. It was pointed out by all
the petroleum companies other than IBP that the policy dated 08.10.2002 upon
which the petitioners seek reliance was only in respect of IBP and there is no
such policy with regard to the other petroleum companies. In any event, it was
submitted on behalf of the petroleum companies that the petitioners had not, in
any of the petitions herein, been granted retail outlets or petrol pumps by any of
the petroleum companies.

They submit that what the petitioners are calling retail outlets /

petrol pumps are nothing but lease agreements / deeds in respect of lands and
Maintenance and Handling Contracts. The two agreements are with separate
petitioners, but even if they are taken conjunctively, they do not constitute a
retail outlet / petrol pump.

The notification of 06.09.2006 issued by the

Government of India, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas pertains to the
subject of operation of retail outlets of oil marketing companies on companyWP(C)18261-63/2006&Ors

Page No.24 of 32

owned-company-operated (COCO) basis. It was submitted on behalf of the
petroleum companies as well as the Union of India that the retail outlets in
question were essentially company-owned-company-operated outlets.

The

lands for these outlets had been taken on lease from the petitioners with the
right to sub-let. The oil companies invested huge sums of money to set up their
retail outlets on the lands so taken on lease. By and large, in respect of all these
retail outlets, Maintenance and Handling Contracts have been entered into with
parties other than the petitioners who leased out the lands to them. Such
persons are also petitioners alongwith the land owner petitioners. On behalf of
the petitioners, it was contended that the Maintenance and Handling Contracts
were given to the nominees of the land owners.

4.

By virtue of the said notification dated 06.09.2006, it was pointed

out that in respect of the permanent COCO retail outlets, the oil marketing
companies may operate the same by their own officers without job contractors
or ad hoc dealers and the existing temporary COCO retail outlets should be
phased out within a time frame preferably within a year. The notification
dated 06.09.2006 also provides that the temporary COCOs which are to be
phased out, may be first offered and handed over, subject to suitability, to the
pending Letter of Intent (LoI)-holders under the following categories which
inter alia includes the Special Scheme (Operation Vijay – Kargil) allottees;
Discretionary quota Scheme; Corpus Fund Scheme (SC/ST category of
WP(C)18261-63/2006&Ors

Page No.25 of 32

dealerships, widows and women above 40 years of age without earning
parents); and other categories as prescribed in the marketing plans.

5.

The petitioners are aggrieved by the fact that it has been decided to

phase out the temporary COCO retail outlets and also to stop job contractorship
or ad hoc dealership in respect of permanent COCO retail outlets. The result of
this is that the Maintenance and Handling Contracts would cease to operate,
whereas the leases would continue to be operational. This means that the landowning petitioners would continue to own the land, but that their lands would
now be handed over by the oil companies to third parties to run the retail
outlets. According to the petitioners, the land leases and the Maintenance and
Handling Contracts (M&H Contracts) were to run conjunctively and were not
to be separated. The petitioners' legitimate expectation was that ultimately the
land leases and the M&H Contracts would translate into full-fledged retail
outlets.

6.

The contention on behalf of the oil companies, on the other hand, is

that the lands were taken on lease on market value. The duration of the leases
were 30 years and included the right of the lessees (oil companies) to sub-let
the same. The M&H Contracts were not linked with the leases and, in any
event, no retail outlets had been allotted to the petitioners.

WP(C)18261-63/2006&Ors

It was also

Page No.26 of 32

contended that there are several leases which contain arbitration clauses and
there are others which specifically permit the granting of retail outlets to others.

7.

In the context of these broad arguments, the respondents have

raised specific issues, the first being of territorial jurisdiction of this court.
According to the respondents, which includes the Union of India, all the leases
in the present petitions are in respect of lands outside Delhi.

The M&H

Contracts have also been executed and are to be worked out outside Delhi. It
was, therefore, contended that no part of cause of action arose in Delhi. In the
context of the challenge to the policy / notification dated 06.09.2006, it was
submitted by the counsel for the respondents that the petitioners have not really
challenged the same and whatever pretence of challenge is there in these
petitions, is merely to create a cause of action or impart a semblance of
territorial jurisdiction of this court. It was contended that there is no challenge
to the policy itself and the prayer itself indicates that the notification dated
06.09.2006 ought to be quashed “as the same is not applicable” to the
petitioners' purported retail outlets. There being no lis with the policy and the
question being only of an applicability of the policy / notification, the situs for
territorial jurisdiction would shift to where the lands are located. None of them
are located in Delhi and, therefore, according to the respondents, this court
would not have territorial jurisdiction to entertain these petitions. It was also
contended that even if there was a dispute with the policy, the same being a
WP(C)18261-63/2006&Ors

Page No.27 of 32

policy matter, this court would not interfere in exercise of its writ jurisdiction
unless an illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety were to be pointed
out. There is none. Therefore, this court ought not to interfere. It was also
pointed out that there is no question of any legitimate expectation arising in
favour of the petitioners.

8.

The learned counsel for the respondent / HPCL pointed out that the

leases have been executed by the petitioners pursuant to advertisements issued
by the HPCL. The last line of the advertisements made it abundantly clear
that:“This advertisement is for purchase / lease of site only and
not for allotment of dealership.”

9.

It was submitted that in view of this disclaimer, there was no

question of any expectation arising on behalf of the petitioners, who responded
to the same, legitimate or otherwise. It was also contended that the lease rents
were fixed after proper valuation of the properties and it is not as if the lease
was a part of a larger transaction. It was contended that the lease constituted a
complete transaction for which the petitioners were entitled to the agreed rent.
The leases executed in respect of the lands in question did not contain anything
with regard to allotment or grant of dealership. On the contrary, there were
clauses in the lease which permitted the lessees (oil companies) to sublet and

WP(C)18261-63/2006&Ors

Page No.28 of 32

part with possession for all or any of the purposes mentioned in the lease and
that, too, without the consent of the lessor. It was a regular lease of land and
was not limited to a retail outlet. Some of the lease agreements also contained
clauses which restricted jurisdiction to specifically mentioned places. Apart
from this, many leases contained arbitration clauses also.

10.

As regards the M&H Contracts, all the oil companies contended

that they were regular labour contracts and only as a temporary arrangement.
There were clauses in these Contracts which specified that no claim on
dealership on the sole basis of the said agreements could be made. The learned
counsel for all the oil companies also submitted that it was never held out by
the oil companies that the leases would later be converted into dealerships. On
the other hand, there were sufficient indications in the advertisements as well as
in the leases and also in the M&H Contracts, to the contrary.

11.

Mr Valmiki Mehta, the learned senior counsel who appeared on

behalf of the petitioners, sought to counter the arguments on territorial
jurisdiction as well as on merits. In order to do so, he explained that the
challenge to the

notification of 06.09.2006 is two-fold.

Firstly, it was

contended on behalf of the petitioners that they are not covered under the
expression “temporary COCO Retail Outlets” and, therefore, do not fall within
the ambit of the said
WP(C)18261-63/2006&Ors

notification dated 06.09.2006.

Secondly, it was
Page No.29 of 32

contended that if it is held that the petitioners are covered by the notification of
06.09.2006, then the policy of phasing out is liable to be declared to be bad.
This is so because there has been no breach of agreements on the part of the
petitioners nor have they been found to be guilty of any misconduct or
impropriety. On the other hand, they had a legitimate expectation that they
would be granted full-fledged retail outlets. This expectation, according to Mr
Mehta, was borne out from the fact that the M&H Contracts were given to
nominees / family members of the lessors and that the lease rents were
commensurate with the M&H Contracts.

12.

It was next contended by Mr Mehta that, in any event, the issue had

also been decided by a learned single Judge (Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J) in the case
of Nand Kishore Bajpai and Another v Union of India & Another: WP(C)
358/2007 decided on 16.01.2007 and the same was binding on this court
though, he submitted that the issue of territorial jurisdiction was not discussed
in that decision. Because, Mr Mehta has referred to the decision in Nand
Kishore Bajpai (supra) as having binding effect on this court, it would be
appropriate to examine the same. Since it is a brief judgment, the same can be
set out in its entirety as under:“WP(C) 358/07 & CM 625/07
The only question to be considered is as to whether the
petrol pump located on the land of petitioner no.1 and being
run by petitioner no.2 can be assigned or transferred to any
third party by the Oil company on the land of petitioner
WP(C)18261-63/2006&Ors

Page No.30 of 32

no.1 without the consent of petitioner no.1. Indisputably the
answer to this question would be in the negative. The Oil
companies are free to deal with their contract in accordance
with law but cannot assign the running of the petrol pump
to a third party on the land of petitioner no.1 without the
consent of petitioner no.1. This is so as the land of a citizen
cannot be taken away except in accordance with law.
Petition stands disposed of.”
12.

I am informed by the learned counsel for the parties that WP (C)

358/2007 was in respect of a lease of land on the Rae Bareli – Lucknow Road,
Bachrawan Town, U.P. The oil company concerned was IBP. I am also
informed that a Letters Patent Appeal (LPA No.158/2007) has been filed
against the said decision dated 16.01.2007 and the same is pending before a
Division Bench of this court. It is true that in the decision in Nand Kishore
Bajpai (supra), the very issue which arises in the present case was considered.
However, the various intricacies that have been raised in the course of
arguments by the learned counsel appearing on both sides before me were,
perhaps, not raised at all before the learned single Judge in Nand Kishore
Bajpai (supra). Considering the arguments to which I have referred to in some
detail above, I have serious doubts with regard to the question of territorial
jurisdiction as also on merits. The nature of the leases and the surrounding
circumstances, in my view, create serious doubts with regard to the claim of the
petitioners.

In the decision in Nand Kishore Bajpai (supra) though the

petitioner No.2 therein is described as the person running the petrol pump, I am
informed by the learned counsel that he was an M&H Contractor as explained
WP(C)18261-63/2006&Ors

Page No.31 of 32

above. I have difficulty in accepting the general observation / finding that
“The Oil companies are free to deal with their contract in accordance with law
but cannot assign the running of the petrol pump to a third party on the land of
petitioner No.1 without the consent of petitioner No.1.” This , in my respectful
view, would not hold good where the leases themselves permit sub-letting on
the part of the lessees (i.e., oil companies).

There would have been no

difficulty if I had found myself to be in complete agreement with the decision
rendered by the learned single Judge in Nand Kishore Bajpai (supra), but
unfortunately that is not the case. In Vijay Laxmi Sadho (Dr) v. Jagdish: 2001
(2) SCC 247, the Supreme Court held as under:“It is well settled that if a Bench of coordinate jurisdiction
disagrees with another Bench of coordinate jurisdiction
whether on the basis of "different arguments" or otherwise,
on a question of law, it is appropriate that the matter be
referred to a larger Bench for resolution of the issue rather
than to leave two conflicting judgments to operate creating
confusion. It is not proper to sacrifice certainty of law.
Judicial decorum, no less than legal propriety forms the
basis of judicial procedure and it must be respected at all
costs.”
13.

Accordingly, it would be appropriate if these matters are referred to

a larger Bench for resolution of the issues at hand. For this purpose, all these
matters be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for assigning the same to an
appropriate larger Bench.
