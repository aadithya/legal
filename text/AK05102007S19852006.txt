The defendant is also carrying on business of food grains and rice

under the name and style of M/s.S.A. Trading Company, having its office at
13-A, Block-U, Bindapur Matiala Road, Uttam Nagar, New Delhi-110059.

4.

The plaintiff had been selling rice to the defendant and an account in

the name of the defendant was opened and maintained in the books of
account of the plaintiff and price of

goods sold and delivered to the

defendant used to be credited and the amounts received from the defendant
used to be debited.

5.

According to the plaintiff, on 8th October, 2005, a sum of

Rs.20,71,605/- was due from the defendant to the plaintiff on account of
balance price of goods sold and delivered to the defendant for which cheque
No.993361 dated 21.10.2005 for Rs.7,35,838.51 and cheque No.133465
dated 21.10.2005 for Rs.13,35,766.62 were given to the plaintiff by the
defendant.

The said cheques when presented for encashment were,

however, returned dishonoured on account of payment being stopped.
According to the plaintiff, defendant represented that he will arrange payment
for encashment of those dishonoured cheques, however, no payment has

been made. According to the plaintiff, other cheques were also given which
have also been dishonoured.

6.

On the representation of defendant, the said cheques were again

presented for encashment, however, they were returned with the remarks
“payment stopped by drawers and account closed”. Consequent thereto, the
plaintiff raised demands for payment of amounts due on account of
dishonoured cheques by notice dated 18th February, 2006 and 15th April,
2006, however, the notices were returned with the remarks “refused”.

The

notices sent by UPS have not been received back and are deemed to have
been served.

7.

Since, the amount of dishonoured cheques were not paid, the plaintiff

filed the present suit under Order XXXVII Rule 1 of Code of Civil Procedure
claiming an amount of Rs.20,71,605.13 on account of dishonoured cheques
and Rs.3,66,780/- from 21st October, 2005 till the date of filing of the suit.
The plaintiff has also claimed interest at the rate of 18% per annum.

8.

The plaintiff has relied on the invoices issued to the defendant

stipulating that interest will be charged @ 1.75% per month in the first month,

CS(OS) No.1985/2006

Page 3 of 5

2.25% per month on the next month and 36% per annum after two months.
The plaintiff, however, has claimed interest at the 18% per annum.

9.

The summons of the suit under Order XXXVII were served on the

defendant on 21st February, 2007 and the appearance in compliance of order
XXXVII Rule 4 has not been filed.

10.

The relief claimed by the plaintiff on the basis of dishonoured cheques

is within the ambit and scope of Order 37 of Code of Civil Procedure and
there is no other impediment in decreeing the suit on failure of the defendant
in putting appearance pursuant to the summons served on the defendant
under the appropriate form under Order 37.

11.

Consequently, the averments made in the plaint are accepted to be

correct and the defendant has become liable to pay a sum of
Rs.20,71,605.13 on account of amount dishonoured cheques and an amount
of Rs.3,66,780/- on account of interest from 21st October, 2005 till the date of
filing of the suit.

12.

The suit of plaintiff is, therefore, decreed, for a sum of Rs.24,39,385/-

with costs. The plaintiff shall also be entitled for simple interest @ 9% per
annum from the date of institution of the suit till the realisation of the
decreetal amount.
