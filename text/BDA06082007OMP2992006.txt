1.

This is a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and

Conciliation Act, 1996 in respect of the Award dated 24.03.2006 passed by the
respondent No.2. Although various grounds have been taken for challenging
the said Award, the main grounds taken by the petitioner are that claim was time
barred and that the claim was also barred under Clause 25 of the agreement
entered into between the petitioner and the respondent No.1.

It appears that preliminary objections had been raised with regard to

the claim being time barred and also being barred under clause 25 of the said
agreement. The said preliminary objections were disposed of by an order dated
16.12.2003 passed by the learned Arbitrator. However, since the petitioner felt
aggrieved by the rejection of the objections, a review application was filed for
reconsideration. Without going into the objections as to whether an Arbitrator
ought or ought not to consider an application for review, the learned Arbitrator
decided to re-hear the matter and consider the objections once again. The same
were disposed of by an order dated 27.07.2004. Both the objections were
addressed and answered in the following manner:“The respondent has not denied or disputed either in
replication to the reply of the claimant or in its written
submissions, the legal position as stated by the counsel for
the claimant with reference to provisions of Section 28(b)
of the Indian Contract Act and the judgments cited by the
claimant that the provision of clause 25 is void to the
extent of waiving or barring the claims if arbitration is not
invoked within 90 days of the final bill. No other
judgment to the contrary has been brought to my notice by
the respondent. So far as the judgments cited by the
counsel for the respondent are concerned the same are not
applicable to the fact of the case in hand as in the case of
Pandit Munsi Ram Vs. DDA the reference to arbitration
was rejected not because of the arbitration having not been
invoked within 90 days but because the petition was filed
after 5 years from the date of payment of the final bill. In
this case the admitted date of payment of final bill is
31.03.1999 whereas the claimant has invoked arbitration
on 25.03.2002 which is well within three years from the
date of payment of final bill. Though in objection dated
OMP 299/2006

page no 2 of 5

11.11.2003 the respondent had alleged that the copy of the
letter dated 25.03.2002 was received on 01.04.2002 but
nothing has been produced on record to substantiate the
same. To the contrary R-1 dated 25.03.2002 filed by the
respondent with letter dated 11.11.2003 shows that the
letter invoking arbitration was received by the respondent
vide Dy. No. 376 dated 27.03.2002. Even if the period of
3 years is counted upto 27.03.2002 from 31.03.1999 it is
well within three years.
Further even as per the
allegations of the respondent itself the time extensions
were decided on 14.10.1999 and 29.10.1999 vide R-20
and R-22 and it is only thereafter that the security deposit
was disposed of and further it is admitted by the
respondent that last payment by way of payment of
escalation under clause 10 CC was made on 17.01.2000.
The counsel for the claimant has supplied a copy of
judgment in the matter of Motor General Finance Vs. T.
K. Gorge reported in 2002(1) ALR-284 (Delhi) wherein
the Hon'ble Judge has observed that the payment or part
payment tantamount to acknowledgment of the amount
and thus the period of limitation would be running from
the date when last payment is stated to have been made.
In the replication as well as written submission the
respondent has made an endeavour to plead that the final
bill was accepted on 09.09.1998 and thus the date of final
bill be treated as 09.09.1998. I have seen the record filed
and produced before me. One page of the measurement
book has been filed as R-19 by the respondent which bears
the signatures of the claimant at the top of the page. After
this endorsement and signatures subsequently lot of
recoveries and etc. have been shown. This shows that as
on the date of signing of the MB by the claimant the final
bill was not ready and the recoveries / deductions were
made later on. Further the learned counsel for the
claimant has supplied a judgment in the matter of Unity
Engineers Vs. ITPO reported in 2001 (IV) AD- Delhi-528
wherein it has been observed by the Hon'ble High Court
that the signatures of the petitioner obtained on the
measurement book cannot by any stretch of imagination
be deemed as intimation as provided in the agreement to
OMP 299/2006

page no 3 of 5

the effect that the final bill was ready. Otherwise also R19 the page of the measurement book does not bear the
signatures of the Engineer-in-charge/ Executive Engineer
passing the bill for payment. Evidently the bill has been
passed and finalized by the respondent much after
09.09.1998. Thus under the circumstances I find the date
of the final bill as 31.03.1999 when the payment was
made. So far as the another judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court relied upon by the respondent is concerned
it relates to the period before amendment in Section 28
was brought by the Amending Act of 1997. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court has not discussed the effect of the
amended provisions of Section 28(b) of the Indian
Contract Act and as already observed by me the
respondent have not brought to my notice any other law
on the point of 90 days holding otherwise than what was
held by the Hon'ble High Court in the three judgments
relied upon by the counsel for the claimant.”

3.

With regard to the question that the claim was time barred under

Clause 25, I find that the learned Arbitrator has correctly relied upon the
provisions of Section 28 (b) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and has held that
the said Clause 25 of the agreement would be void to the extent that it
extinguishes the rights of the respondent No.1 upon the expiry of the period of
90 days prescribed therein. With regard to the claim being time barred, the
learned Arbitrator has also examined the question of limitation and has taken the
date of last payment as the starting point of limitation and found that the claim,
which preferred within a period of three years thereof, was within time. I see no
infirmity with the Award passed by the learned Arbitrator so as to warrant

interference under Section 34 of the said Act.
This petition is dismissed.
