Per S.N. AGGARWAL, J.
*
1.

The learned Single Judge vide impugned order has

quashed the notification dated 7.3.1962 issued by the Delhi
Administration under Sections 4, 6 17 of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894 for acquiring the land of Village Masjid Morh
including the land of respondent no.1 measuring 5 bighas 19
biswas in Khasra No. 368. Aggrieved by the said order, the
DDA has preferred this Letter Patent Appeal.
2.

The property in question was acquired by the

Government under Section 12 of the Displaced Persons
(Compensation & Rehabilitation)

Act, 1954 and was

thereafter placed in the compensation pool under Section 14
of the Act. The said property was later on notified for sale in
public auction on 21.5.1958. The late husband of respondent
no.1 had participated in the auction. His bid was highest and
was, therefore, accepted by the Government. The Ministry of
Rehabilitation,

Government

of

India

vide

letter

dated

31.10.1960 asked the late husband of respondent no.1 to

LPA388/2005

Page 2 of 15

take provisional possession of the property in question
purchased by him in public auction. Part auction money was
paid by the late husband of respondent no.1 by way of
adjustment of his verified claim against property left by him
in Pakistan. The late husband of respondent no.1 (auction
purchaser) died on 6.6.1970. After his death the Ministry of
Rehabilitation, Government of India vide its letter dated
16.6.1980 asked respondent no.1 to deposit the balance
sale consideration of Rs.14,992/- within fifteen days. The
balance sale consideration was deposited. Sale certificate
was issued on 22.7.1980 and the same was registered on
15.7.1981.
3

Notification under Sections 4, 6 & 17 of the Land

Acquisition Act for acquiring the land of village Masjid Moth
including the land in question of respondent No. 1 was
issued on 07.03.1962 which was followed by an Award No.
1351 dated 30.06.1982. As the possession of respondent No.
1 in respect of land in question was sought to be disturbed,
she filed a suit for injunction being Suit No. 526/1992 in the
LPA388/2005

Page 3 of 15

Subordinate Court and the Subordinate Court granted the
ad-interim injunction as prayed for but the same was later
on vacated. The respondent No. 1 aggrieved by the
acquisition of her land in question vide Notification dated
07.03.1962, filed a writ petition in this Court (WP(C) No.
3789/93)

and

aforementioned

had

prayed

Notification

for

quashing

issued

by

of

the

the
Delhi

Administration and the LAC Case No. 72/85 pending in the
Court of ADJ (Land Acquisition Court). The Notification dated
07.03.1962 was sought to be quashed inter alia on the
ground that the land in question could not have been
acquired by the Government as the said land being an
evacuee property belonged to the Government in which title
had not yet passed in favour of respondent No. 1 on the date
of Notification. The prayer for quashing of Notification was
opposed by the appellant (DDA) not only on the ground of
delay and laches but also on the ground that the land in
question ceased to be Government land w.e.f. 11.12.1960
and, therefore, the rights of respondent No. 1 in the said
LPA388/2005

Page 4 of 15

land could be acquired under the Land Acquisition Act.
4

Learned Single Judge had framed following two

issues for consideration in view of the pleadings of the
parties before him:“1
Whether the land in question was an
evacuee land on the date of issue of
notification under Section 4 of the Land
Acquisition Act on 07.03.1962?.
2
Whether the land, if it was an
evacuee property, could have been acquired
under the law?.”

Relying upon two judgments of this Court in

Shyam Sundar Khanna & Ors. Vs. UOI reported in 1997 RLR
101 and Nanak Chand Sharma Vs. UOI & Ors. reported in 29
(1986) Delhi Law Times 246, Learned Single Judge answered
the first question in the affirmative holding that the land in
question was an evacuee property on the date of the
Notification under Section 4 and consequently answered the
second question in the negative holding that the land in
question could not have been acquired in law. Aggrieved by
these findings of Learned Single Judge, the appellant (DDA)

LPA388/2005

Page 5 of 15

has come up in this appeal.
6

There is delay of about 760 days in filing of this

appeal. The appellant has filed an application (CM No.
2093/2005)

for

condonation

of

the

said

delay.

This

application is supported by the affidavit of Mr. S.P. Pandey,
Director, LM (HQ), DDA. The appellant has contended in its
application for condonation of delay that the delay of 760
days in filing of the appeal was neither willful nor due to
negligence but was due to the time consuming and
unavoidable administrative procedures which have to be
gone through in cases like the present one, where the
Government is the litigant and decisions have to be taken
collectively. It is further contended that the appellant had to
collate documents, administrative orders, judgments of the
Supreme Court and various other records for preparation of
the present appeal. The request made by the appellant for
condonation of the delay is opposed by the counsel
appearing on behalf of respondent No. 1 on the ground that
the explanation given by the appellant for delay in filing of
LPA388/2005

Page 6 of 15

the present appeal is unsatisfactory. We have given our
anxious consideration to this aspect relating to condonation
of delay. While considering the delay on the part of the
appellant in filing of the present appeal, we have also taken
into account the delay of more than 31 years on the part of
respondent No. 1 in challenging the acquisition proceedings
by way of writ petition in which the impugned order which is
the subject matter of challenge in this appeal has been
opposed. We are of the view that since the question in the
present proceedings relates to valuable rights of the parties
in the land in question, the delay on the part of either of the
parties can not be allowed to come in the way of doing
justice. We are further of the view that when substantial
justice and technical consideration are pitted against each
other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred.
We feel that by delay, the appellant would not stand to gain
anything and at best he would only be entitled to get his
claim adjudicated on merits instead of it being thrown to
winds on technical consideration of delay in filing of the
LPA388/2005

Page 7 of 15

appeal. Having regard to the circumstances of the case, we
are inclined to condone the delay in filing of the present
appeal. The delay is accordingly condoned and the appeal is
taken up for disposal on merits.

The property

measuring 5 Bighas and 19 Biswas

comprised in Khasra No. 368, Village Masjid Moth, New Delhi
was acquired under Section 12 of the Displaced Persons
(Compensation & Rehabilitation) Act, 1954. The property
was formed part of compensation pool under Section 14 of
the said Act. The property in question was notified to be sold
as Government property by way of a public auction on
21.06.1958.

The

late

husband

of

respondent

No.

1

participated in the auction and gave the highest bid which
was accepted by the Ministry of Rehabilitation, Government
of India, vide its letter dated 31.10.1960. The provisional
possession of the property in question was delivered to the
late

husband

of

respondent

No.

1.

The

husband

of

respondent No. 1 died on 06.06.1970. Part of the sale
consideration of the property purchased by the late husband
LPA388/2005

Page 8 of 15

of respondent No. 1 was adjusted against claim in respect of
property left by respondent No. 1's husband in Pakistan. The
balance sale consideration of Rs.

14,992/- was demanded

by the Ministry of Rehabilitation, Government of India from
respondent No. 1 vide letter dated 16.06.1980 and the said
amount was required to be deposited within 15 days failing
which sale would to be cancelled and earnest money to be
forfeited. The balance sale consideration was deposited.
Sale Certificate was issued on 22.08.1980 and the same was
registered on 15.07.1981.

The Government of NCT, Delhi

(Erstwhile Delhi Administration) issued a Notification under
Sections 4, 6, 17 of the Land Acquisition Act on 07.03.1962
for acquiring the land of village Masjid Moth including the
land in question of respondent No. 1 for a public purpose.
This Notification was followed by an award No. 1351 dated
30.06.1982. These are the facts over which there is no
dispute between the parties.
8

The

contention

of

respondent

No.

1

before

Learned Single Judge was that the land in question could not
LPA388/2005

Page 9 of 15

have been acquired by the Government being an evacuee
property. The contention was that the Government could not
have

acquired

its

own

land.

Further

contention

of

respondent No. 1 was that the property in question
continued to remain an evacuee property on the date of
Notification dated 07.03.1962 as its title had not been
transferred or passed on in favour of her late husband on the
date of aforesaid Notification. These contentions found
favour with Learned Single Judge and therefore vide
impugned

order

Notification

dated

07.03.1962

under

Sections 4, 6 & 17 of the Land Acquisition Act was quashed.

Mr. Sarin learned counsel appearing on behalf of

the appellant had argued that the judgment of this Court in
the case of Shyam Sunder Khanna Vs. UOI relied upon by
Learned Single Judge in favour of respondent No. 1 has been
set aside by the Supreme Court in appeal filed by the
appellant titled as “Delhi Development Authority Vs. Shyam
Sunder Khanna & Ors” vide judgment dated 18.09.2003 in
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 12460 of 1997 holding that this Court had
LPA388/2005

Page 10 of 15

erred in quashing the acquisition notification ignoring the
delay and laches on the part of the petitioner in approaching
the Court. Learned counsel for the appellant had also relied
upon another judgment of the Supreme Court in Delhi
Administration Vs. Madan Lal Nangia reported as (2003) 10
SCC 321 wherein it has been held as under:-

“Merely because a property is an evacuee
property does not mean that it vests with the
Central Government. The Custodian is a
Statutory Authority appointed under the Acts.
The custodian is a distinct person from the
Central Government. Merely because a property
vests in the Central Government. It must be
noted that the Custodian is appointed for each
State. Further, if, as contended, the property
vests in the Central Government then there
would be no question of Section 12 of the
Displaced
Persons
(Compensation
&
Rehabilitation) Act providing that the Central
Government could acquire such property. The
Central Government can never acquire its own
property. Thus the very fact that Section 12 of
the
Displaced Persons (Compensation &
Rehabilitation) Act provides for acquisition by
the Central Government clearly indicates that
evacuee properties are not properties of the
Central Government. As they are not properties
of the Government they can be acquired, not
just under Section 12 of the Displaced Persons
LPA388/2005

Page 11 of 15

10

(Compensation & Rehabilitation) Act, 1954, but
even under the Land Acquisition Act.”
...........
...........
..........
“Thus merely because the property vests in
the Custodian as evacuee property does not
mean that the same cannot be acquired for
some other public purpose. The moment that
property is acquired for another public purpose
the compensation payable under the Land
Acquisition Act would be paid to the Custodian
who would then distribute it under the provisions
of various Acts.”
It may be seen from the above judgment in

Madan Lal Nangia's case (Supra) that the Supreme Court has
categorically held that even if there is a finding that the
property acquired was an evacuee property on the date of
Notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, the
acquisition in respect of the said land would still be valid.
11

The acquisition of land on similar facts, as are in

the present case, was upheld by a Division Bench of this
Court in case titled 'M.S. Dewan Vs. UOI & Ors., CWP No.
1400/1986 decided on 06.02.2003. In M.S. Dewan's case
(Supra) a Division Bench of this Court had uphold the
acquisition of evacuee property and dismissed the writ
LPA388/2005

Page 12 of 15

petition of the auction purchaser. Even S.L.P. (Civil) No.
71152/2003 filed by the auction purchaser against the
aforementioned decision of this Court was also dismissed by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Hence the view taken by this
Court in M.S. Dewan's case became final. Hence it would be
relevant

and necessary to refer to para 23 of the said

judgment which is extracted here-in-below:-

“We have already held above that the title
in the property passed in favour of the
petitioner on 14.11.1961. Even assuming that
the title had not passed to the petitioner till
22.07.1963, when sale certificate was issued, in
that case also we do not find any substance in
the submission made on behalf of the petitioner
that the property could not have been notified
for being acquired being the property of the
Government
till
22.07.1963
and
the
Government could not have acquired its own
property. The reason in our holding so is that
the property on being put to auction on
28.12.1960, the petitioner was declared to be
the highest bidder against his verified claims of
the property left behind in Pakistan. the verified
claims were surrendered by him as a part of
consideration for purchase of the property in
question in public auction. The balance
consideration was paid in cash. The entire
consideration stood paid by 14.11.1961. The
LPA388/2005

Page 13 of 15

right of the petitioner in the property on
being declared to the highest bidder was a
valuable right, which the petitioner could
enforce
against
the
respondents
in
compelling the respondents to transfer the
property in his name. Such a right could be
acquired. The property on being put to
auction and on the petitioner being declared
to be the highest bidder and on receipt of
entire sale consideration went out of
compensation pool. The petitioner alone had
interest in the property. This interest could
definitely be acquired pursuant to the
notification issued under Section 4 of the Act.
Therefore, it cannot be said that the
notification under section 4 of the Act was
non est. It was for the petitioner to have raised

a claim. Proceedings for acquisition thus cannot
be challenged on the ground that such interest
could not have been acquired. Therefore, no
fault can be found in the notification under
Section 4 of the Act.”
12

The question that needs our consideration in the

present appeal is squarely covered by the above judgment
of this Court in M.S. Dewan's case. The facts of the present
case as well as that of M.S. Dewan's case are almost same.
It has been categorically held in M.S. Dewan's case that the
right held by the auction purchaser can be legally acquired
by way of Notification under Section 4 of the Land
Acquisition Act notwithstanding the transfer of title in
LPA388/2005

Page 14 of 15

respect of land in question in his favour. We respectfully
agree with the view already taken by this Court in the
aforementioned case. Hence we have no hesitation in
holding that Learned Single Judge erred in holding that the
property in question was an evacuee property on the date of
Notification dated 07.03.1962 and in quashing the said
Notification for that reason. The view so taken by Learned
Single Judge in the impugned order thus cannot be sustained
in law particularly in view of the above referred judgment of
the Supreme Court and of this Court.
13

For the foregoing reasons, the impugned order

dated 09.08.2002 passed by Learned Single Judge in WP (C)
No. 3789/93 is hereby set aside. This appeal is allowed with
costs throughout.
