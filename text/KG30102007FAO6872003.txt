Respondent No.2 was served through publication but
even after the publication, nobody has appeared.

Nobody has

been appearing for respondent No.1 although duly served.
The grievance of the appellant in the present appeal is
that the claim petition filed by the appellants was dismissed vide
order dated 08.08.2003 on account of the fact that the appellants
FAO No.687/2003

Page 1 of 6

failed to lead any evidence. Counsel for the appellant contends
that adequate opportunity was not afforded to the appellants to
produce their evidence and just after one date, the Tribunal has
proceeded to finally dispose of the matter.
I have heard learned counsel for the appellant and
perused the records.

The appellants have filed claim petition

claiming a sum of Rs.24 lacs towards compensation for death of
their son Mr.Ramesh Chand who died on 12.10.2000 after being
hit by the truck bearing registration No. HR-26-GA-0761 driven by
respondent No.2 Sh.Mamman, rashly and negligently.

FIR

No.333/2000 was duly registered against the driver of the
offending vehicle under Section 304 A IPC and the parents of the
deceased had filed the said compensation. The issues in the said
case were framed by the Tribunal vide order dated 14.5.2001 and
the matter was adjourned to 12.10.2001 when the Presiding
Officer of the Tribunal was on leave and then the matter was
adjourned to 8.3.2002. On 8.3.2002, statement of appellant No.1
was recorded for consideration and grant of interim maintenance
and the matter was adjourned for 9.9.2002 for further evidence of
the appellants.

On the said date, the file was directed to be

placed before the other Presiding Officer due to the said case
FAO No.687/2003

being transferred.

On 21.01.2003, no PW was present nor

summoned and the matter was adjourned for 01.05.2003.

On

01.05.2003 again the appellant did not produce any evidence and
the matter was adjourned for 08.08.2003. On 08.08.2003 again,
no witness on behalf of the appellants

were present and the

Tribunal without giving any further opportunity to the appellants,
closed the evidence of the appellants and on the same date itself
passed the impugned judgment.
Although it is a matter of common knowledge that the
claimants approaching the Tribunal themselves cause undue and
enormous delay in taking steps for early disposal of their case.
This is indeed an unfortunate situation where compensation case
gets delayed due to lapses or inactions on the part of the
claimant. All the claimants appearing before the MACT should act
promptly in prosecuting their matters so that expeditious disposal
of the compensation cases can take place. However, at the same
time, the Tribunals dealing with the compensation cases needs to
be cautioned for not showing any kind of undue haste in disposing
such matters. The compensation cases are to be treated dealt
with not merely keeping in view the sound legal principles but
with human compassion as well. In the instant case, a death of
FAO No.687/2003

young boy has taken place and the Tribunal in utter haste has
dismissed the compensation petition in the absence of evidence
led by the appellants. The hasty approach of the Tribunal in the
present case deserves to be deprecated.
Motor Vehicles Act is a social welfare legislation. The
provisions underlying the Act are indisputably beneficent in
nature. The law pertaining to Motor Vehicles Act was brought on
the statute book by the legislature to extend the relief by way of
compensation to the victims of accidents or their family.

It is

settled law that to prevent injustice or to promote justice and to
effectuate object and purpose of the welfare legislation broad and
liberal view and interpretation should be made rather than taking
a narrow and pedantic view and also technicalities should not
come in the way of justice. Motor Vehicles Act being a beneficent
legislation deserves a liberal construction and in that view of the
matter the remedy to the claimants against tortfeasor for
obtaining just compensation cannot be taken away on account of
the fact that the appellants failed to lead any evidence.
At this stage, counsel for the appellant also contends
that appellant No.1 has already expired on 05.06.2003. Counsel
for the appellant also contends that due to the mistake of the
FAO No.687/2003

Page 4 of 6

counsel, the application under Order 22 Rule 3 CPC was moved by
appellant No.2 seeking deletion of name of appellant No.1 before
the Tribunal after the final order.

Counsel contends that the said

application of appellant No.2 was dismissed by the Tribunal vide
order dated 9.9.2003 after dismissal of the claim petition. It is no
doubt correct that the application moved by appellant No.2 under
Order 22 Rule 3 was not maintainable after trial in the
compensation case was concluded with the passing of the final
judgment in the case. However, since the present matter is being
remitted back to the Tribunal, the appellant shall move necessary
application along with condonation application before the Tribunal
itself so as to bring on record the legal heirs of Late Shri Bhoorji
Ram.
In the light of the above discussion, the impugned
award is set aside. The Tribunal shall give due opportunity to the
parties to lead evidence and then decide the case after hearing
the parties.
With these directions, the present appeal is disposed
of.
