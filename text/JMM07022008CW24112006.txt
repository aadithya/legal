1.
We had heard this matter at length on 5th February, 2008.
After hearing both the parties we proceeded to dictate the
judgment, however, after the order was substantially dictated, the
learned counsel for the respondent sought a short adjournment as
he wanted to look into the matter further.

We granted that

opportunity to learned counsel for the respondent and adjourned
the matter for today.
2.

We have heard the learned counsel for the respondent

further on the issue. Since on 5th February, 2008 we had recorded
the order substantially, it would be appropriate to recapitulate the
WP(C) No.2411/2006

Page 2 of 10

factual matrix stated therein.
3.

The petitioner was enrolled in the Indian Army as Clerk(GD)

on 13th December, 1977. He was promoted from time to time and
rose to the rank of Subedar and on attaining the age of
superannuation, after serving for 38 years, he retired from service
on 31st December, 2005.
4.

Much before his retirement i.e. in August, 2004,

Ministry of Defence, Government of India, with a view to rehabilitate
to ex-servicemen and as a welfare measure decided to allot 10%
quota for ex-servicemen Clerks(GD) for the post of Lower Division
Clerks in the Military Engineering Service(MES) as a deputation cum
employment measure.

SRO no.129 dated 18th August, 2004 was

issued to this effect. Thereafter this provision was given statutory
recognition as the aforesaid notification dated 18th August, 2004
was published in the Gazette of India dated 4th September, 2004
titled as “Military Engineering Services Group-C (Assistant, UDC and
LDC) Recruitment Rules, 2004. These are framed by the President
of India in exercise of powers conferred by proviso to Article 309 of
the Constitution. The Notification further stipulates that they shall
come into the force on the date of their publication in the official
gazette. As they were published in the Gazette dated 4th
WP(C) No.2411/2006

Page 3 of 10

September, 2004, the said Rules thus came into effect from 4th
September, 2004.
5.

Few months after his retirement i.e. on 7th July, 2005,

the petitioner made application for appointment to the post of
Lower Division Clerk in Military Engineering Services through
proper channel under the aforesaid rules.

This application has

however been not considered and the petitioner is denied the
benefit. Challenging the decision, the present writ petition is filed.
6.

In the counter affidavit filed by the respondent it is

stated that after the aforesaid Notification was issued, the matter
was processed and it took considerable time in formulation of the
policy. Ultimately signal dated 11th July, 2005 was issued whereby
it was decided that personnel due to retire between 1st January,
2006 to 30th June, 2006 would be considered for 'deputation cum
re-employment' as Lower Division Clerks as per the said policy.
According to the respondents as the petitioner retired before 1st
January, 2006 i.e. on 31st December, 2005 he is not entitled to the
benefit of the said policy.
7.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that

the aforesaid policy decision fixing date of 1st January, 2006 is
clearly ultra vires Notification dated 18th August, 2005 published in
WP(C) No.2411/2006

Page 4 of 10

the Gazette on 4th September, 2004 as per which the
Engineering

Services

Group-C

(Assistant,

UDC

Military

and

LDC)

Recruitment Rules, 2004 came into from its publication i.e. 4th
September, 2004.
8.

It is the submission that these rules are statutory in nature

having

been

framed

under

proviso

to

Article

309 of

the

Constitution and, therefore, by administrative order, date of
enforcement cannot be changed by fixing the same as 1st January,
2006. Learned counsel for the petitioner has also referred to the
judgment of a Single Judge of this Court in the case of Lt. General
R.C.Kochar vs. Union of India and others 2000 (2) SLJ 388 to
contend that merely because there was administrative delay in
implementing the policy a person to whom the right has already
accrued cannot be denied the same.
9.

Learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that after

the said notification was passed, it took some time to the
respondent to implement the said order as the matter was to be
looked into administratively at various angles.

Even if such a

submission of the learned counsel for the respondent is accepted
at its face value, merely because some administratively delay
took place in implementing the aforesaid notification, that would
WP(C) No.2411/2006

Page 5 of 10

not mean that it was open to the respondent to change the date
fixed in the notification by administrative order. As already noted
above, the Military Engineering Services Group-C (Assistant, UDC
and LDC) Recruitment Rules, 2004, came into force on 4th
September, 2004. This date is provided in the notification itself
as it clearly states that same shall come into force from the date
of its publication and aforesaid rules were gazetted on 4th
September, 2004. Thus all the persons covered by those rules
would get benefit of these rules w.e.f. 4th September, 2004.
These rules are statutory in nature having been framed under
proviso

Article 309 of the Constitution . These rules itself

stipulates that these statutory rules cannot be changed or
supplant as referred in Union of India Vs. Charanjit Singh Gill
& Others 2000 (V) SCC page 42. This aspect is even covered by
the judgment of this court in Lt. General R.C. Kochar Vs.
Union of India & Others (Supra). This is Single Bench judgment
given by one of us (A. K. Sikri, J.).

However, the same was

affirmed by the Division Bench of this Court and even Special Writ
Petition against this judgment was also dismissed by the Supreme
Court.

Relevant portion from this judgment is reproduced as

under:
WP(C) No.2411/2006

Page 6 of 10

I am conscious of the principle
that employer has right to fix the cut
of date i.e. from which a particular
decision would come into effect and
there are number judgments to this
effect. But circular letter dated 29th
July, 198 issued in this respect cannot
be read in isolation and all the facts
are to be taken into consideration
cumulatively,
including
the
circumstances and the background in
which the said circular letter came to
be issued. It is clear from the aforesaid
discussion that initial exclusion of the
category of lieutenant general AFMS
by the respondents was on the
assumption that extention beyond 60
years was not only for certain special
categories of personnel (including
medical specialists) to be dealt on
cases to case basis (i.e. in terms of
took into consideration only para 2(b)
of the Memorandum dated 13th May,
1998).
However, later on, it was
realised that in terms of para6 of
Office Memorandum dated 13th may,
1998 there could be general extention
of retirement age of all armed forces
personnel by two years. once this is
realised and corrected steps taken
consequent upon which circular dated
29th July, 1998 is issued, persons like
the petitioner should not have been
left out and it should have been made
effective from 31st May, 1998 instead
of 31st July, 1998. Position would have
been different if for the first time
decision was taken for enhancement
of the age of retirement of armed
forces personnel on 29th July, 1998 and
made effective from 31st July, 1998.
WP(C) No.2411/2006

Page 7 of 10

However, decision taken on 29th July,
1998 is equal to the decision which
was taken vide Office Memorandum
dated 13th May, 1998. Therefore, this
would be a case where ratio of the
judgment of D.S. Nakara Vs. Union of
India, AIR 1983 SC 130, can be
applied. Once corrective steps are
taken but made effective from
prospective date i.e. 31st July, 1998
instead of 31st May, 1998 it creates
discrimination. Fixing the date of 31st
July, 1998 would therefore be arbitrary
and violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India. At the cost of
repetition
it
is
stressed
that
substantive decision is taken vide
Office Memorandum dated 13th May,
1998 and in particular para 6 thereof
which gives the benefit to the
petitioner. If the Government realised
the correct position on a later date
and remedied the defect it should not
affect the petitioner prejudicially as
respondents cannot take advantage of
their own wrong. Moreover, fixing of
date of 31st July, 1998 has no nexus
with the objective sought to be
achieved and classifying persons in
two categories i.e. one to retire before
31st July, 1998 and others to retire on
31st July, 1998 and thereafter, when
they form same class in view of the
facts
noted
above,
would
be
discriminatory. More so, when the
genesis of both the orders dated 30th
May, 1998 is same i.e. both derive
their
sustenance
from
Office
th
Memorandum dated 13 May, 1998.
Therefore the benefit of letter dated
29th July, 1998 should have been
WP(C) No.2411/2006

Page 8 of 10

extended to the petitioner also and
not doing is unfair and violative of
what
is
popularly
known
as
Wendsbury's principle of fairness.
The matter can be seen from
another angle also. Decision is taken
on 13th May, 1998 itself as is clear
from para 6 of Office Memorandum
dated 13th May, 1998 which enhanced
age of retirement of personnel of
armed forces by two years. Once that
decision is taken which was taken
before the retirement of the petitioner
the only formality was to pass
necessary
orders
and
amend
respective rules. If the respondents
deferred the parsing of necessary
orders, those who retired in the
meantime should not be made to
suffer. More so, when petitioner is
only person who has become a victim
of delayed corrective decision which
comes ultimately in the form of
circular dated 29th July, 1998.
10.

Therefore fixing the date 1st January, 2006 as the date in the

signal dated 11th July, 2005 is clearly in violation of the aforesaid
recruitment rules and the fixing of the said date is,therefore,
hereby set aside. It is thus mandatory that the aforesaid rules
would be given effect to from 4th September, 2004.
11.

Accordingly we allow this petition and make the rule

absolute.
12.

The case of the petitioner for employment as ex-serviceman

considered and decision thereon be taken within three months
from today.
