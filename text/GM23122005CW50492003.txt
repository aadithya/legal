This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner

aggrieved by an order issued by the Government of India dated
10/23rd August, 2001 peremptorily ordering the petitioner to stop
making admission to the Dr. S.M. Naqui Imam Dental College to
the BDS Course for the academic sessions 2001-2002. Inasmuch

W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

1

as there is no dispute to the relevant facts and to the extent
necessary of the purposes of the present case, the same are briefly
set out hereafter.
2.

Rauf Muslim Jamia is stated to be a society registered

under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 which was established
with an object to establish institutions for imparting education for
the welfare of the minorities. This society set up the Dr. S.M.
Naqui Imam Dental College, the petitioner (herein referred to as
the 'college') for imparting education in dental sciences in the year
1989. The college was located in District Darbhanga in the State of
Bihar.
3.

The profession of dentistry and dental education is

governed by the provisions of the Dentists Act, 1948. In these
circumstances, upon establishment of the college, information was
given by it to the Dental Council of India, the Bihar state
government and the L.N.Mithila University seeking affiliation.
Vide a letter bearing no. 6338 dated 1st March, 1989, the
Dental Council of India directed the college to obtain a no
objection certificate from the state government and affiliation
from the concerned university.
After the inspection conducted by the Vice Chancellor of
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

2

the L.N. Mithila University on 10th June, 1990, the college was
granted a no objection certificate for affiliation by a letter dated
12th June, 1990.
4.

It is essential to notice that the petitioner has contended

that its college was established in 1989. No proper action was
taken by the authorities and that the process of admission started
immediately thereupon.
5.

It appears that the Department of Health of the Bihar

State Government, by a letter dated 31st May, 1991 made a request
to the Dental Council of India to inspect the petitioner's college.
As no action was taken, a reminder in this behalf was sent on 13th
January, 1993. The Dental Council of India did not heed either the
request of the state government or of the college.
6.

Upon the incorporation of Section 10A by amendment to

the Dentists Act, 1948 with effect from 25th August, 1992, the
petitioner filed CWJC 9490/1992 based on the contention that
Section 10A and Section 10C do not apply to the dental courses
conducted by the petitioner. On this contention, the petitioner
sought an inspection to be conducted by the Dental Council of
India.

This writ petition was dismissed by the High Court of

Judicature at Patna vide a judgment dated 14th September, 1993
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

3

holding that Section 10A & C as amended and incorporated with
effect from 25th August, 1992 would be applicable in the case of the
petitioner.
7.

The petitioner assailed the judgment of the High Court

before the Supreme Court by way of SLP No. 20394-20396/1994
and was granted special leave to appeal. Its appeals before the
Supreme Court were registered as CA 8098 and 8100/1994.
8.

In the meantime, the university, inspected the college on

3rd November, 1995 and a report was submitted by the inspectors
to its Vice Chancellor. The L.N. Mithila University apparently also
gave affiliation to the college vide a communication dated 2nd
December, 1995 which was in the following terms :“To,
The Secretary,
Dr. S.M. Naqui Imam Dental College &
Hospital,
Bahera, Distt. Darbhanga.
Sub:

Institution-Dr. S.M.

Hospital, Bahera in B.D.S. Course from the
session – 1989-90.
Sir,
With reference to your letter no. 54/SDC/95 dated 11.10.95 on the subject noticed above,
I am directed to inform you that in pursuance of
the order of the Hon'ble High Court Civil Review
No. 42 of 1994 Arising out of judgment and order
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

4

dt. 28.2.94 passed in C.W.J.C.No. 5824/93, dated
19.4.94 the Vice-Chancellor has been pleased to
grant permanent affiliation to Muslim Minority
Institution namely-Dr. S.M. Naqui Imam Dental
College & Hospital, Bahera (Darbhanga) in B.D.S.
Course from the session 1989-90 as per terms and
condition laid down by the Dental Council of India
from time to time.
It will be open for the University to
inspect your college from time to time to ensure
that the requisite standard and facilities are being
maintained there.
You are directed to deposit the requisite
Reserve Fund of your college to the University
office within two months from the date of issue of
this letter.”
Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned senior counsel for the
petitioner has contended that it is only upon full satisfaction and
compliance of all formalities that the affiliation was granted by the
university on 2nd December, 1995.
9.

In SLP No. 20394 & 20396/1994 (wherein order dated

14th September, 1993 was assailed), the Apex Court vide orders
passed on 20th February, 1995 directing the Dental Council of
India to hold an inspection and make available the report before
the court. In compliance with the orders, such an inspection was
conducted by the team of inspectors of the Dental Council of India
on 13th April, 1995 and 14th April, 1995 and a report was submitted
by them to the Dental Council of India on 17th April, 1995. This
inspection report of the inspectors was brought to the notice of the
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

5

Apex Court at the time of hearing in SLP Nos. 20394 and
20396/1994(CA Nos. 8098 and 8100/1994). Without making any
comment thereupon, the Apex Court in its order dated 10th July,
1995 observed that the first three batches of students could not
join the third year classes resulting in stagnation at the second
year level because the result of the first year BDS Examination of
the students of the

petitioner college had not yet been declared.

The Apex Court directed the publication of the result of these
students and permitted them to pursue further studies.
Pursuant to the orders dated 10th July, 1995 passed by
the Apex Court, the students of the college who were admitted in
the sessions 1989-90, 1990-91, 1991-92 were allowed to appear in
the examination.
10.

Based on the aforesaid inspection report dated 13/14th

April, 1995, of its inspectors, the Dental Council of India also
granted permission to run the college with 60 students intake
capacity from the year 1989-90 subject to rectification by the
general body of the Dental Council of India. This communication
dated 9th of August, 1996 from the Dental Council of India deserves
to be considered in extenso :“To,

The General Body of the Dental Council

the said college out of purview of the
Dentists(Amendment) Act, 1993 and to grant its
permission to run the BDS Course at the said
College and alongwith the recommendation of the
Executive Committee (Dec., 1995) and after some
discussion decided as under :“College was inspected as per

W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

11.

Yours faithfully,
-Sd/(A.L. Miglani)
Secretary
Dental Council of India”
The petitioner therefore, contends that as it had

complied with the directions of the Dental Council of India as were
made to it in the general body meeting held on 6th and 8th
November, 1995 to obtain the affiliation from the L.N. Mithila
University, it made a representation to the Dental Council of India
seeking approval of its course and permission to run the BDS
course.

The request of the petitioner was considered by the

general body of the Dental Council of India on 9th August, 1996.
The permission was recorded by the Dental Council of India vide
its letter dated 9th August, 1996, it is stated, only because the
petitioner fulfilled all legal requirements.
12.

The Dental Council of India even thereafter caused

inspection of the college to be conducted in respect of the
infrastructure and the courses of the college. Such inspection was
conducted on 22nd April, 2000. An inspection report confirming
the adequacy of the infrastructure and compliance of all
requirements in terms of building space, teaching staff etc were
submitted by the inspectors to the Dental Council of India,

W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

respondent no. 4 herein.

A joint inspection report dated 22nd

April, 2000 was considered by the Dental Council of India in its
100th meeting held on 24th and 25th April, 2000.

The

recommendations of the Dental Council in this behalf was in the
following terms :“33(34) Joint Inspection Report of the
Council's Inspectors (i) Dr. Kanda Swamy,
Chennai and (ii) Dr. Nand Kumar, Trivendrum

building space, teaching staff and other
infrastructure facilities available at Dr. S.M.

The Council may authorise
the President of the Council to forward
the above recommendation to the
Central Government after receiving
the report of the representatives who
were deputed by the L.N.Mithila
University as well as Govt. of Bihar on
the request of the Council.
The under-lined portion is
modified by the Council.
The Council also decided to
cancel the DCI letter No. DE-3(93)W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

99/7917 dated 24.2.2000 in which the
Council's Inspectors (1) Dr. K.
Jyotindru Kumar, Trivendrum and (2)
Dr. Dhirendra Srivastava, New Delhi
have been appointed to verify the
compliance report since the Council's
inspectors (i) Dr. Kanda Swamy,
chennai and (ii) Dr. Nand Kumar,
Trivandrum have inspected the said
college for the same purpose.”
Upon the acceptance of the inspection report, the Dental

Council of India decided to make necessary recommendations to
the Central Government to recognise the BDS Degree of the
L.N.Mithila University in respect of the course conducted by the
petitioner with 60 intake capacity and the president of the council
was authorised to forward the recommendations to the central
government.
14.

Around this time, it appears that the Dental Council of

India was also conducting inspections of the facilities which ought
to have been made available in other dental colleges in the state of
Bihar. A decision in this behalf was taken by the general body of
the Dental Council of India in its meeting held on 19th and 20th
February, 1999. The petitioner was inspected pursuant to action
proposed in this meeting on 22nd April, 2000.

As five other

colleges did not agree for inspection, admission to their colleges
were stopped by the Dental Council of India vide a letter dated 17th
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

10

May, 2000. These included the Patna Dental College & Hospital,
Budha Institute of Dental Sciences, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Institute of
Dental Sciences & Hospital, Darbhanga Dental College and the
Mithila Minority Dental College & Hospital. This communication
has been relied upon by the petitioner in support of its contention
that it satisfied all the requirements stipulated by law and by the
authorities in respect of running of dental courses, and that, for
this reason there was no direction to it to stop admissions.
15.

The central government was concerned with the

compliance with the guidelines given by the Supreme Court in the
Unnikrishnan, J.P. & Ors. Vs State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors. and
Unnikrishnan P.J. & Ors. vs State of A.P. & Ors (1993) 1 SCC 645.
The Director, Department of Health of the central government
issued an order on 30th October, 2000 directing adoption of the
admission process in terms of the guidelines given by the Apex
Court. A reminder in this behalf was issued on 5th February, 2001.
16.

The central government also required the Dental

Council of India to stipulate that the dental colleges should be
required to rectify all deficiencies identified by the Dental Council
of India by 30th April, 2001 failing which derecognition process
can be initiated for all dental colleges.
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

11

17.

In the meantime, for the purposes of effecting

admissions, the dental colleges were required to ensure that
admissions were as per the Supreme Court guidelines with
reference to allocation of seats in the free NRI/payment quotas.
So far as Patna Dental College was concerned, a request was made
to the DGHS that before allocation of seats to this college on the
basis of the 15% all India quota for the CBSE examination, the
status of the college for making admissions was required to be
ascertained from the government. A reminder in this behalf was
issued by the Government of India on 5th February, 2001 to the
Dental Council of India.
It is pointed out that the reference to seven colleges in
the letters dated 30th October, 2000 and 5th February, 2001 of the
Government of India was on an erroneous assumption inasmuch
as the Dental Council of India had stipulated only five colleges in
Bihar in its communication dated 17th May, 2000. The petitioner
was not one of the colleges in respect of whom any deficiencies had
been earlier pointed out.
18.

However despite much water having flown, it appears

that the decision arrived at by the Council earlier was reconsidered
by the Dental Council of India in its meeting held on 5th and 6th
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

12

March, 2001 which apparently was based on the government of
India communication dated 30th October, 2000. In this meeting,
the Executive Committee made a reference to alleged deficiencies
and levelled an allegation to the effect that the petitioner's
authorities had mislead the Council and furnished wrong
information about the teaching staff of the college.
19.

In this meeting held on 5th and 6th March, 2001, the

council upon reconsideration of the decision arrived at in respect
of the petitioner college, decided as under :“Since the college authority has been given
reasonable opportunities to fulfill the
deficiencies whereas the college authority has
not made good the above mentioned
deficiencies and has not furnished the
Compliance Report for the same inspite of
repeated reminders issued by the Council. The
Council desired that last & final opportunity
may be given to the College authority to furnish
the Compliance Report on the above
deficiencies pointed out by the Council and
required information/documents on the
following points and date of inspection to be
conducted by the Council's Inspectors before
30/4/2001 failing which the admission in BDS
Course at the said college shall be stopped.
1.
All the relevant information and
documents in relation to salary statement of
entire staff of the years of which they are
claiming their employment.
2.

present
and
permanent
residential address of all the teaching staff of
the said college.

streamlined by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India in Unnikrishnan J.P. Vs State of Andhra

4.
List of students admitted for BDS
Course
during
the
academic
session

Interestingly, there was no reference even to the
communication dated 9th August, 1996 whereby the Dental Council
of India had given permission to the petitioner to run the BDS
course with effect from 1989-90 with the 60 students intake.
20.

Adverting to these deficiencies, the petitioner has

pointed out that one of the deficiencies in the letter dated 29th
March, 2001 related to the present and permanent residential
address of the teaching staff.
It appears that vide a letter dated 3rd February, 2001 the
petitioner had informed the respondents about the status and
address of all the teachers. It was also pointed out that these
particulars stood duly verified by the Dental Council of India from
the SDO of the area area vide its letter dated 28th December, 1999.
The certificate of the SDO dated 5th January, 2000 in this behalf
was available with the council. In this communication, it was also
pointed out that all necessary information with regard to the salary
of the entire staff which was a recurring expenditure was
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

14

mentioned in the joint inspection report. All the figures were duly
verified by the inspectors of the Dental Council of India with effect
from the date of appointment of the employees and staff of the
petitioner.
21.

So far as the names of the students who were admitted

in 1989 is concerned, it was pointed out that these students had
approached the Supreme Court of India seeking permission to
pursue the academic course and orders dated 15th February, 2001
were passed in favour of three students and for the remaining
students of the batches on 18th September, 2001.
22.

Since the respondents acted upon the orders passed by

the Apex court, according to the petitioner, the entire information
with regard to the particulars of the faculty and students was
available with the respondents and the objections raised by the
Dental Council of India and in its letter dated 29th March, 2001,
were without any factual basis.
23.

In the meantime, it appears that an order dated 27th

April, 2001 was passed by the Lalit Narayan Mithila University to
the effect that while granting affiliation to the petitioner the
procedure laid down in Section 4 c(xix) read with Section 2 d of
the Bihar State Universities Act, 1976 and the related statutes was
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

15

not followed and therefore the letter dated 2nd December, 1995
communicating the affiliation and the order to this effect were void
abinitio.
24.

The petitioner assailed this order by way of a writ

petition before the Patna High Court which was registered as
CWJC 6388/2001. This writ petition was dismissed by an order
dated 25th June, 2002 which order was assailed before the Apex
Court by way of SLP(Civil) No. 12282/2002. Leave to appeal was
granted by the Apex Court and also the operation of the judgment
and order dated 25th June, 2002 of the High Court of Judicature at
Patna in CWJC No. 6388/2001 and the order dated 27th April,
2001 was stayed by the Apex Court by its order dated 22nd July,
2002. It is stated that this matter is pending even on date before
the Apex Court.
25.

The petitioner has contended that the consequence of

this interim stay would therefore be that the affiliation to the
university which was granted, would stand restored.
26.

Upon passing of the order by the Apex Court, the

L.N.Mithila University permitted completion of the incomplete
examinations of the students which was proceeded by the
declaration of their results. A notification dated 25th July, 2003
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

16

was issued by the University which was in the following terms :“

further advice from this Ministry.”
27.

The petitioner points out that despite these facts, in the

meantime, the government of India issued a communication dated
10th and 23rd August, 2001 to the petitioner and three other dental
colleges in District Darbhanga, Bihar which was in the following
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

Subject: Stopping of admissions in BDS course of
Dental
Colleges located in Bihar.
Sir,
The Dental Council of India have
recommended for stopping admission for the BDS
course in your dental college from the academic
session 2001-2002 on account of certain
deficiencies.
Further, Lalit Narayan Mithila
University, Darbhanga, Bihar, to which your dental
college is affiliated, have withdrawn their affiliation
with retrospective effect.
2.
The above position was considered in the
Ministry and it has been decided to advise you to
stop admission in your dental college for BDS
course from the academic session 2001-2002 until
further advice from this Ministry. Any violation of
this direction will be viewed seriously.”

W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

18

This communication has been impugned by the
petitioner before this court by way of the present writ petition. It
is contended that the ground for stoppage of the admissions in the
petitioner's college was withdrawal of the petitioner's affiliation. It
is submitted that in view of the order dated 25th June, 2002 in SLP
No. 6822/2002 staying the operation and effect of the order dated
27th April, 2001, the affiliation of the petitioner stood restored. It
has been contended that there are no deficiencies in the facilities
provided by the petitioner and for this reason, it deserves to be
permitted to effect admissions in its college. It has further been
contended that nothing further was communicated in this order of
the government of India and that the ground to the effect of want
of no objection certificate under Section 10A of the amended Act
cannot be read into the order. Reliance has been placed on the
pronouncement of the Apex Court in (1978) 1 SCC 405 Mohinder
Singh Gill vs Chief Election Commissioner and (2003) 6 SCC 545
Chander Singh vs State of Rajasthan to contend that the order
cannot be supported by reasons which have not been stated in the
order and are only brought out in the counter affidavit.
28.

By way of the present writ petition the petitioner has

sought the following prayers :W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

19

“i)
A writ, order and/or direction in the
nature of certiorari be issued and be pleased to
quash the order dated 10/23rd August , 2001
(Annexure P11) issued under the signature of
director (H.E.), Department of Health (P.M.S.
Section), Ministry of Health & Family Welfare,
Government of India, whereby and whereunder
an order issued to stop taking admission in the
petitioner's college/institution for B.D.S. Course
from the academic sessions 2001-2002 until
further order and any violation of the
direction/order be viewed seriously.
ii)
Issue rule nisi calling upon the
respondents to show cause as to why the
relief/reliefs prayed for the above may not be
granted and after such cause may be shown and
after hearing the cousel for the parties make the
rule absolute; and or
iii)
pass such other order/or orders as
your lordships may deem fit and proper in the
circumstances of the case.”
29.

The respondents have vehemently opposed grant of this

writ petition on the ground that the petitioner has not satisfied any
of the requirements of the Dentists Act, 1948.
vehemently urged that

It has been

the issue relating to affiliation of the

college of the petitioner with the University is pending before the
High Court of Judicature at Patna while the requirements of the
petitioner to abide by the provisions of Section 10A of the Dentists
Act, 1948 is pending before the Apex Court.

In these

circumstances, the petitioner cannot possibly be held to be an
institution which has satisfied the requirements of law and as such
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

20

cannot be permitted to effect admissions.

Appearing for the

Dental Council of India, Mr. Maninder Singh, learned counsel has
urged that the amended provisions have been incorporated in the
statute after a careful consideration of the plight of hundred of
students who are admitted in the private professional institutions
which are unable to maintain academic standards. As a result
midway through the courses, the institutions closed down putting
into jeopardy professional careers of hundred of students.

As

these institutions were earlier not required to seek any
certification from the state government, there was no authority
which was willing to take responsibility for these students when
the institutions where they were admitted closed down. It was to
prevent such a situation that Section 10A of the Dentists Act was
incorporated. Therefore, the petitioner cannot be permitted to
commence or continue any course without obtaining the requisite
no objection certificate from the state government in compliance
with the statutory provision.
Learned counsel has contended that in view of the
statutory provision, no admissions can be effected till such time
that the course of the petitioner and the degree awarded by it is
recognised by the competent authority under the statute.
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

21

The

recognised qualification has to be incorporated in the schedule to
the statute. According to learned counsel for the Dental Council of
India, the degree of B.D.S. granted by the L.N. Mithila University
is not a recognised qualification under the Dentists Act and the
petitioner is not a recognised institute and for this reason as well
no admissions can be permitted to be effected by the college.
Strong reliance has been placed on the refusal of the
Supreme Court to grant the application filed by the petitioner for
recognition of its course. It is contended that the order dated 18th
September, 2001 passed by the Apex Court was restricted to the
students who had been admitted up to the year 1992. For this
reason, it is submitted, no relief can be given to the petitioner in
the instant case. The court had directed limited relief and granted
recognition only limited to the students who had pursued the
course under orders of the court. All these batches finished by
1997 and it is pointed out that the recognition has worked itself
out.
30.

The Dental Council of India has also objected to grant of

relief to the petitioner for the reason that the issue of recognition
of the course and institution has been considered at the highest
level. It is pointed out that meetings were taken in the ministry
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

22

which were attended by representatives of all concerned including
the Dental Council of India, the representatives of the University,
state government and all the dental colleges. It has been pointed
out that in the meeting dated 27th December, 2002, the state
government had stated that it had not granted any permission to
start any of the private dental colleges in the state of Bihar and
hence it had no role in allocating students to these colleges. The
said representative had requested that no new admissions should
be allowed in the dental colleges and that wide publicity should be
given to the prohibitory orders passed by the Government of India.
Despite further meetings held even on 23rd August, 2003, it is
contended that the position remains the same. It is pointed out
that the Dental Council of India had agreed that it would
undertake inspection of dental colleges which fulfilled its norms in
terms of position of the no objection certificates from the state
governments and the university affiliation certificates apart from
the infrastructure and facilities etc. According to learned counsel,
the government had jurisdiction to issue prohibitory orders and
stop admissions in view of the applicable regulations.
31.

Having heard learned counsel for the parties, it is

evident that three steps are necessary to be completed in order to
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

23

run a dental college. These include (i) affiliation by the university;
(ii) recognition of the course and the institution by the government
of India and (iii) no objection certificate from the concerned
government.
32.

Civil Appeal No. 8098/8100/1995 is still pending before

the Apex Court which arose out of the orders passed by the High
Court of Patna on 14th September, 1993 and 13th September, 1994
on the question as to whether the Dentists Act as amended in 1993
was applicable to the petitioner or not and whether the appellant is
a minority institution. In these appeals, on 10th July, 1995, the
Apex Court had made an order to the effect that without prejudice
to the contentions that may be raised at the time of hearing, the
result of the students from the college who had appeared in the
BDS first year examination held by the L.N.Mithila University in
the year 1992 should be published forthwith and after declaration
of the results, the eligible students should be permitted to pursue
their further studies including taking part in the next higher
examination under the rules.
These students had completed their studies and passed
out of the college had obtained their degrees from the L.N. Mithila
University. However the degree obtained by these students were
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

24

not being recognised by the government of India on the ground
that the college was not recognised. The Apex Court took notice of
the fact that inspections have been held of the college in year 1997,
1999, 2000 and on 23rd April, 2000 by the Dental Council of India
and that the Dental Council of India had made a recommendation
to the government of India to accept the inspector's report and
accord recognition to the college. It was because a review was
sought of the resolution in the meeting held on 16th and 17th July,
2000 that the matter had remained pending.

In these

circumstances, having regard to the fact that the students had
pursued the course pursuant to the orders made by the court and
that even the Dental Council of India had contemplated grant of
recognition to the petitioner, vide an order passed on 15th February
, 2001, the court directed that so far as these three students were
concerned, the degree conferred on them should be recognised
and appropriate action should be taken by the Dental Council of
India in this behalf. The order dated 15th February, 2001 was in
the following terms :“These appeals arise out of orders made by the
High Court of Patna on 14.9.1993 and 13.9.1994
on the question whether the Dentists Act, as
amended in 1993, is applicable to the appellant
institution or not and whether the appellant is a
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

25

minority institution.
However in these
proceedings, with which we are concerned at
present, we are not concerned with the larger
questions. In these appeals, on 10.7.1996 this
Court made an order to the effect that without
prejudice to the contentions that may be raised at
the time of hearing, issued a direction that the
result of the students from the college who had
appeared in the B.D.S. First year examination
held by L.N.Mithila University, Darbhanga in the
year 1992 should be published forthwith and after
declaration of the results, the eligible students
should be permitted to pursue their further
studies including taking part in the next higher
examination under Rules.
Thereafter three
students, who are applicants before us completed
their studies and passed out of the college.
Although they have obtained their degree since
the college has not been recognised by the
Government of India under the Dentists Act, the
college cannot be treated to be one which is
recognised for the purpose of recognising the
degrees obtained in such courses.
The
applicants, therefore, now sought for certain
additional reliefs in these applications.
It is brought to our notice that certain
inspections have been held in the year 1997, 1999,
2000 and on 23.4. 2000 the Dental Council of
India made a recommendation to accept the
inspector's report and accord recognition to the
same. However, a review was sought of the
resolution made in this matter in a meeting held
on 16th and 17th July, 2000 on certain material
placed before it.
It is unnecessary to advert to this
aspect of the matter in these proceedings.
Applicants, in these cases, pursued their studies
pursuant to the orders made by this court and
even the Dental Council of India too
contemplated to recognise this institute and for
one reason or the other that recommendation
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

26

could not be sent to the Government and the
same has been withheld.
If these students are left in limbo their
entire career will be jeopardised for it is well nigh
impossible to say when the final decision as to
recognition of the college will be taken.
So far as these students are concerned
the degrees conferred upon them should be
recognised and appropriate action should be
taken by the Dental Council of India to do so. Let
such action be taken by the Dental Council of
India within a period of one month from today.
I.As. Are disposed of accordingly.

The Dental Council of India was opposing the

recognition of the degrees given to the students and had filed a
review petition dated 8th May, 2001. The principal ground for
review as raised in the petition was that only such dental
qualifications can be recognised which have been granted by the
college recognised by the Central Government based upon the
recommendations of the Dental Council of India. According to the
Dental Council of India, the direction of the Apex Court to the
council to recognise the dental qualifications granted by the
college when the college itself had not been recognised would not
be in conformity with the provisions of the Dentists Act, 1948.
This review petition was rejected by the Apex Court by
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

27

an order dated 31st July, 2001.
34.

It has been stated on record that so far as the degrees

obtained by the students pursuant to the orders of the Apex Court
is concerned, the same were duly recognised and notifications in
this behalf were issued by the authorities.
35.

Strong reliance has been placed by the petitioner on the

letter dated 9th August, 1996 whereby the Dental Council of India
had granted approval to the petitioner to the BDS course from
1989-90 with the intake capacity of 60 students. According to the
petitioner, there was no objection and no deficiencies so far as the
availability of infrastructure facilities and staff was concerned and
that for this reason, the Dental Council of India had given
permission to the petitioner to commence the BDS course.
Inspection of the petitioner's institution was duly conducted in
April, 2000 by the experts appointed by the Dental Council of
India in the presence of observers of the L.N. Mithila University
who recommended the recognition of the petitioner and did not
point out any deficiency. The inspection report was accepted by
the Executive Committee of the Dental Council of India which
recommended that the recognition of the BDS qualification of the
appellant college with 60 intake capacity be forwarded to the
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

28

government of India.

This recommendation of the Executive

Committee was accepted and approved by the general body of the
Dental Council of India in the meeting held on 24th and 25th April,
2000 and the recommendation was accordingly sent to the
government of India.
36.

It has been pointed out that it was thereafter that on a

general observation made by the observers with regard to the
absence of a representative of the state government in the
inspection conducted in April, 2000 that the matter was
reconsidered in a meeting held on 16 and 17th July, 2000.
According to the petitioner, there was no material whatsoever and
no deficiencies which remained in respect of the petitioner and
nothing remained to be done by it in order to be entitled to the
recognition of its course and the college by the government of
India. Even the deficiencies which were pointed out by the Dental
Council of India were duly satisfied by the petitioner.
37.

At this stage, it becomes important to notice the orders

of the Apex Court in the proceedings arising out of the petitioner's
challenge to the applicability of the amended provisions of Section
10A to 10C of the Dentists Act, 1948 to it. The High Court had
rejected the petitioner's writ petition in this behalf vide its
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

29

judgment dated 10th September, 1993.

This appeal of the

petitioner before the apex court being CA 8098 and 8100/1994, it
has been informed, got tagged with the bunch of petitions which
were disposed of on 12th March, 2003 alongwith T.M.A. Pai
Foundation & Ors. Vs State of Karnataka & Ors. (2002) 8 SCC 481.
The civil appeal of the petitioner were disposed of by the Supreme
Court vide an order passed on 12th March, 2003 with the direction
to the High Court to re-examine the matters which had been
decided and which were in appeal before the Apex Court. The
order passed by the Apex Court on 12th March, 2003 reads thus :“ In Writ Petitions
These matters are covered by the
decision of a Constitution Bench of this Court in

questions have been decided by this Court, it
becomes necessary for the High Courts to reexamine the matters which have been decided
and which are in appeal before this Court. The
orders of the High Court are, therefore, set aside
without expressing any opinion on merits and the
matter is remitted to the High Court for fresh
consideration in accordance with law.
Status quo shall continue unless the
High Court so decides to modify the same by an
appropriate application made to them by any of
the parties. The parties are at liberty to file fresh

It is further directed that the parties
can move the High Court for appropriate interim
relief.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
In Rest of the Civil Appeals
The several questions raised in these matters are

therefore, set aside without expressing any

The order of the high court holding that Section 10A

appllies to the petitioner was therefore set aside. Without any
expression of opinion on the merits of the matter, the matter was
remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration in accordance
with the principles of law laid down by the court in TMA Pai's case
law.

The Apex Court directed that status quo would continue

unless the same was modified by the High Court by an appropriate
application made by any of the parties.
39.

This matter, it is stated, is still pending adjudication in

the High Court of Judicature at Patna.

W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

32

40.

In the case of the petitioner, so far as affiliation by the

University is concerned, the withdrawal thereof was impugned by
the petitioner. The judgment of the Division Bench of the High
Court has been reported at AIR 2002 Patna 143 Dr. S.M. Naqui
Imam Dental College & Hospital vs L.N. Mithila University & Ors.
The matter is pending before the Apex Court and the order
withdrawing the affiliation stands stayed vide an order dated 22nd
July, 2002. The petitioner was granted leave to appeal under
Article 136 of the Constitution of India.
41.

So far as the issue of the applicability of Section 10A of

the Dental Council of India Act, 1942 is concerned, undoubtedly
the petitioner was permitted to effect admissions by the Dental
Council of India vide its letter dated 9th August, 1996 and it
commenced to admit students from 1989. A recommendation was
even made by the Dental Council of India to the central
government to grant recognition to the petitioner prior to Section
10A being incorporated on the statute book.
The respondents have urged that the petitioner had first
filed Writ Petition(Civil) No. 9490/1992 to the effect that Section
10A and Section 10C does not apply which was rejected. This writ
petition is still pending final adjudication before the High Court of
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

33

Judicature at Patna.
It is noteworthy that the petitioner also filed a writ
petition being CWJC No. 5824/1993 wherein the petitioner had
sought grant of the approval under Section 10A of the Dental
Council of India Act which was dismissed on 5th February, 1994 on
grounds of constructive resjudicata as the petitioner in the earlier
petition had said that Section 10A does not apply to it.
42.

Inasmuch as the entire issue with regard to the

applicability of Section 10A and the other amendments to the
Dental Council of India effected in 1992 to the petitioner are
concerned, the issue is therefore pending adjudication in CWJC
No. 9490/1992. On considerations of judicial propriety, it would
be improper for this court to dwell any further on this issue.
43.

However, it is noteworthy that no effort has been made

by the petitioner to seek hearing and adjudication in this matter.
The petitioner has taken a stand that it was a college established
prior to the provisions of Section 10A coming into force and hence
this statutory provision is not applicable to it. On the other hand,
it is the stand of the respondents that the petitioner is required to
take permission, not only for the purposes of commencement of an
institution, but also for the purposes of increase of the intake
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

34

capacity as has been specifically stipulated in the provision
incorporated by amendment of the statute.
44.

The same is the position with regard to the withdrawal

of affiliation by the university.

It is nobody's case that an

institution can be run without affiliation to the university. Leave
to appeal was granted to the petitioner against the High Court's
orders dated 25th June, 2002 in CWJC 6388/2001 and the order of
the university dated 27th April, 2001 suspending affiliation was
stayed. Even during the pendency of the present writ petition, no
steps have been taken by the petitioner to seek hearing in this
matter.
45.

The question as to the scope of right of minorities to

establish and administer educational institutions of their choice
under Article 30 of the Constitution of India fell for consideration
before the Constitution Bench of Apex Court which has decided
several questions of far reaching impact in its judgment reported
at 2002 (8) SCC 481 T.M.A. Pai Foundation & Ors vs State of
Karnataka & Ors. The judgment of the court was rendered on 31st
October, 2002 where it was interalia held as under :“57. We, however, wish to emphasize one
point, and that is that inasmuch as the
occupation of education is, in a sense,
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

35

regarded as charitable, the Government can
provide regulations that will ensure excellence
in education, while forbidding the charging of
capitation fee and profiteering by the
institution. Since the object of setting up an
educational institution is by definition
“charitable”, it is clear that an educational
institution cannot charge such a fee as is not
required for the purpose of fulfilling that
object.
To put it differently, in the
establishment of an educational institution,
the object should not be to make a profit,
inasmuch as education is essentially
charitable in nature. There can, however, be a
reasonable revenue surplus, which maybe
generated by the educational institution for
the purpose of development of education and
expansion of the institution.
67.
We now come to the regulations
that can be framed relating to private unaided
professional institutions.
69.
In such professional unaided
institutions, the management will have the
right to select teachers as per the
qualifications and eligibility conditions laid
down by the State/university subject to
adoption of a rational procedure of selection.
A rational fee structure should be adopted by
the management, which would not be entitled
to charge a capitation fee.
Appropriate
machinery can be devised by the State or
University to ensure that no capitation fee is
charged and that there is no profiteering,
though a reasonable surplus for the
furtherance of education is permissible.
xxxxx
135. We agree with the contention of the
learned
Solicitor-General
that
the
Constitution in Part III does not contain or
give any absolute right. All rights conferred in
Part III of the Constitution are subject to at
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

36

least other provisions of the said part. It is
difficult to comprehend that the framers of the
Constitution would have given such an
absolute right to the religious or linguistic
minorities, which would enable them to
establish
and
administer
educational
institutions in a manner so as to be in conflict
with the other Parts of the Constitution. We
find it difficult to accept that in the
establishment
and
administration
of
educational institutions by the religious and
linguistic minorities, no law of the land, even
the Constitution, is to apply to them.
136.
Decisions of this Court have held
that the right to administer does not include
the right to maladminister. It has also been
held that the right to administer is not
absolute, but must be subject to reasonable
regulations for the benefit of the institutions
as the vehicle of education, consistent with
national interest. General laws of the land
applicable to all persons have been held to be
applicable to the minority institutions also—
for example, laws relating to taxation,
sanitation,
social
welfare,
economic
regulation, public order and morality.
161.
The essence of secularism in India is
the recognition and preservation of the
different types of people, with diverse
languages and different beliefs, and placing
them together so as to form a whole and
united India. Articles 9 and 30 do not more
than seek to preserve the differences that
exist, and at the same time, unite the people to
form one strong nation.
Q.5 (a) xxxx
Answer to Question 5(a). A minority
institution may have its own procedure and
method of admission as well as selection of
students, but such a procedure must be fair
and transparent, and the selection of students
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

37

in professional and higher education colleges
should be on the basis of merit.
The
procedure adopted or selection made should
not be tantamount to maladministration.
Even an unaided minority institution ought
not to ignore the merit of the students for
admission, while exercising its right to admit
students to the colleges aforesaid, as in that
event, the institution will fail to achieve
excellence.
Q.5(c)
xxxx
Answer to Question 5(c). So far as the
statutory provisions regulating the facets of
administration are concerned, in case of an
unaided minority educational institution, the
regulatory measure of control should be
minimal and the conditions of recognition as
well as the conditions of affiliation to a
university or board have to be complied with,
but in the matter of day-to-day management,
like the appointment of staff, teaching and
non-teaching, and administrative control over
them, the management should have the
freedom and there should not be any external
controlling agency.
However, a rational
procedure for the selection of teaching staff
and for taking disciplinary action has to be
evolved by the management itself. xxx”
46.

The Apex Court therefore has categorically held that the

conditions of recognition and affiliation to a university or a board
have to be complied with even by a minority institution.
47.

Vide the order dated 12th March, 2003, CA 8098 and

8100/1994 filed by the petitioner before the Apex Court,
challenging the High Court judgment rejecting the contention that

W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

38

the provisions of Section 10A and the other provisions
incorporated by amendment to the Dental Council of India Act,
1948 do not apply to the petitioner on the ground that it was a
minority institution, was allowed. The Apex Court set aside the
order dated 14th September, 1993 passed by the High Court of
Judicature at Patna dismissing the petitioner's writ petition based
on this contention and remanded

the matter for fresh

consideration to the High Court. The court in its order had noticed
that the questions raised in the matter were covered by the
decision of the Constitution Bench in T.M.A. Pai Foundation
(supra) and directed the High Court to decide the writ petition in
the light of the principles laid down in TMA Pai's case. Therefore,
there can be no quarrel that the directions of the Apex Court are
binding on all parties and would govern adjudication on the issues
raised by the petitioner in its writ petition before the Patna High
Court.
48.

The petitioner had admittedly filed a writ petition being

CWJC No. 5824/1993 on the stand that a right had accrued to the
petitioner college for its approval by the respondent nos. 1 to 3 in
view of the amended Section 10A of the Dentist Act, 1948. Copy of
this writ petition no. CWJC 5844/1993 filed by the petitioner has
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

39

been placed before this court during the course of arguments. This
petition was filed after the judgment delivered by the Apex Court
in TMA Pai's case.
In para 26 of this writ petition, the petitioner had
pointed out that it had filed a writ petition being CWJC No.
9490/1992 for a direction to respondents 1, 2 and 3 to hold an
inspection and finalise the question of approval which was heard
on 14th May, 1993 and the judgment has been reserved which has
not been delivered till date. In CWJC 5824/1993, the petitioner
had sought the following relief :“ 1.
That this is an application for a
direction to the respondents 1 to 3 to grant
approval
to
the
petitioner-College
in
accordance with clause (5) of section 10A of the
Dentists Act, 1948 for which application is
pending since 1989 and further respondent no.
4 be directed to grant affiliation with
respondent no. 5 to the petitioner college which
is satisfied with the establishment of the
petitioner college.”
49.

In view of the submissions made by the petitioner in

CWJC 5824/1993 which has been filed after the judgment
rendered in T.M.A. Pai's case and having regard to the prayers
made therein, it would appear that the petitioner has accepted the
position that it is bound to comply with the amended provisions of

W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

40

the Dental Council of India Act.
50.

So far as running of educational institutions is

concerned, while the petitioner may have a right to establish and
run a minority educational institution, however the right to
administer is not an absolute right but is subject to reasonable
regulations for the benefit of the institutions.

It has been

repeatedly emphasised by the Apex Court that the institutions
have to abide by the rules and regulations framed by the
authorities in respect of affiliation and recognition. In the present
matter, the court is concerned with serious course of dentistry
whereby after pursuing the full curriculum, the degree of BDS is to
be awarded.

Upon award of a recognised degree, the student

becomes entitled to a licence to practice as a dentist under the
Dentists Act, 1948 and to treat patients. Serious dental procedures
are performed which requires extensive skills. It is not the rights
the person setting up the institution alone which are to be
considered, but the interests of the students and the public have to
be also borne in mind. The larger interest of the students and the
public would override any individual interests of the petitioner.
51.

In the instant case, a cloud has been cast over the

legality and validity of the petitioner's affiliation to the university.
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

41

The course conducted by the petitioner has till date not received
recognition by the university. Even the degree of BDS which is
awarded by the L.N. Mithila University with whom the petitioner
is claiming affiliation has not been recognised by the Central
Government.
52.

In this behalf, it would be noteworthy to notice the fact

situation which weighed with the High Court of Judicature at
Patna in AIR 2002 Patna 143 Dr. S.M. Naqui Imam Dental College
and Hospital vs. L.N.Mithila University & Ors. The court recorded
thus :“6.
It may be mentioned here that the
petitioner-College had filed writ petition,
C.W.J.C. No.9490/92 seeking direction upon
the respondents to make inspection and finalise
the approval of the College in which it took the
stand that being a minority institution it had
right to establish any institution of its choice
unaffected by the amended provisions of
Sections 10(A), 10(B) and 10(C) of the Dentist
Act. A Division Bench of this Court by judgment
dated 14-9-93 held that the right to establish
minority institution is not absolute. It was
subject to statutory regulations and therefore,
the establishment and maintenance of an
educational institution must be in conformity
with the statutory provisions. The Court further
held that the amended provisions of the Dentist
Act were applicable to all institutions including
those which were established before the
commencement of the amended provisions and
therefore, the recognition of the existing
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

42

institutions will abide by the decision of the
Central Government. The above decision titled
Dr.S.M.Naqui Imam Dental College and
Hospital v. Dental Council of India, reported in
1993(2) PLJR 641. The petitioner-college then
filed C.W.J.C. No.5824/93 seeking more or less
similar direction to grant approval to the college
in terms of Section 10A(5) of the Dentists Act
and, further, direction to grant affiliation. That
writ petition too was dismissed on 28-3-94. The
Court held that the second writ petition seeking
similar relief was barred by principles of res
judicata as no party can be permitted to raise
the same question again after being canvassed
and rejected in the earlier writ petition. In Civil
Review No.42/94 on 19-4-94 the Court clarified
that the petitioner-college could take steps for
affiliation.
12.
The further case of the University is
that General Body of the Dental Council in its
meeting held on 29/30-11-88 had taken a policy
decision that no new Dental Colleges would be
permitted to be established without the
permission or 'no objection' certificate of the
concerned State Government and the affiliation
or 'no objection' certificate of the concerned
State Government and the affiliation or 'no
objection' certificate of the concerned
University. Further, no new proposal for setting
up of new Dental Colleges wold be considered by
the President or the Executive Committee of the
Dental Council under Regulation 3(5) by
circulation. Accordingly, on receipt of the
intimation from Rauf Muslim Jamia about the
proposed establishment of a college in the name
of Dr.S.N.Naqui Imam Dental College and
Hospital, the Dental Council vide its letter dated
1-3-89 directed the President of Rauf Muslim
Jamia to obtain prior permission from the State
Government and affiliation from the University,
Rauf Muslim Jamia/college objected to the
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

43

above stand on the ground that it had right to
establish a minority institution of its choice.
Upon reference made to the Central
Government, vide its letter dated 18-4-90 of the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,
Government of India, it was clarified that
although the right of Rauf Muslim Jamia to
establish and administer a Dental College
cannot be denied, the right is subject to the
regulatory measures as prescribed in that
behalf. Rauf Muslim Jamia thereafter filed
'representation' before the Vice-Chancellor on
14-5-90.
The T\then Vice-Chancellor
(Dr.J.Kumar) who had no medical qualification
inspected the college on 10-6-90 and issued 'no
objection' certificate on 12-6-90. Curiously, the
Vice-Chancellor stated in the letter that “the
college is smoothly functioning in the three
storeyed and electrified palatial newly
constructed building located at Bahera..... I am
influenced and satisfied to this Dental College
and Hospital since it has its own well equipped
and furnished laboratories, hospital library,
hostels (boys and girls), typewriting and
duplicating machines, telephone, furniture,
teaching aids, well experienced and qualified
teaching and non-teaching staff'. The case of the
University is that the Dental Council has laid
down minimum basis norms for new dental
Colleges, none of which has apparently been
specifically noticed or mentioned in the said
letter. The University has expressed doubt that
a college allegedly established in the year 1989
could be so 'well equipped' on or about 12-6-90
as stated in the letter.
14.
In the meantime the petitioner-college
had preferred special leave petitions SLP(C)
Nos.20394-96/94 challenging the decision of
this Court in C.W.J.C. No.9490/92 (supra) but
without impleading the University.
The
Supreme Court passed interim orders relief
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

44

upon on behalf of the petitioners, directing the
Dental Council to conduct inspection vide order
dated 20-2-95, and directing the University to
publish the result of the first BDS examination
vide order dated 10-7-95. These orders were
passed behind the back of the University. It was
only on or about 12/13-10-95 that the University
was added as a party. The examinations were
accordingly held but under Transitory
Regulations already held to be ultra vires by this
Court. The fact that Transitory Regulations had
already been held to be ultra vires was
suppressed from the Supreme Court nor it was
brought to its notice that the L.N.Mithila
University had no authority to conduct any such
examination or to grant 'recognised dental
qualification' in BDS course under the Dentist
Act.
16.
As regards the affiliation dated 2-1295 it has been stated that in the second week of
October, 1995 the permanent Vice-Chancellor
Sri R.C.P. Sinha proceeded on leave. Taking
advantage of his absence on or about 11-10-95,
the petitioner-college made application for grant
of permanent affiliation. On or about -11-95 the
then Registrar of the University suo motu
without any order or authority inspected the
college and submitted a report on 9-11-95 to the
acting Vice-Chancellor Dr.B.N.Jha. On 2-12-95,
the impugned notification was issued granting
permanent affiliation of the petitioner-college in
respect of BDS course from the session 1989-90
professedly in the light of the order of this Court
dated 19-4-94 in Civil Review No.42/94.
According to the University, it was yet another
act of fraud inasmuch as neither in the main
judgment in C.W.J.C. No.5824/93 (giving rise to
Civil Review No.42/94) nor in the order on the
review petition, there was any direction of this
Court to grant affiliation much less permanent
affiliation. All this was apparently done taking
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

45

advantage of temporary absence of the
permanent Vice-Chancellor. A counter-affidavit
to this effect was also hurriedly filed in the
Supreme Court in S.L.P. Nos.20394-6 of 1994,
in January 1996. As soon as the permanent
Vice-Chancellor Dr.R.C.P.Sinha assumed charge
of the office on return from leave, taking notice
of the illegalities committed during his absence
he submitted a detailed report to the Chancellor
and the State Government on 6-1-96 pointing
out violation of statutory provisions.
The
Chancellor advised the Vice-Chancellor to take
action according to law. In August, 1996 the
University filed a counter-affidavit setting out
the facts and circumstances and violation of the
statutory provisions in the matter of grant of
affiliation. The counter-affidavit filed earlier in
January, 1996 was withdrawn as being
unauthorised.”
The aforenoted judgment has been noticed only in order
to appreciate the fact situation which has not been placed before
this court.
53.

So far as the dental education is concerned, the power to

recognise courses and grant permission for commencement of
courses is strictly vested in the central government under the
Dentists Act, 1948.
An amendment was effected to the Dentists Act, 1948
(hereinafter referred as the Act) which became effective from 27th
August, 1992.

Section 10 of the enactment stated that such

qualifications as are mentioned in the schedule to the Act would be
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

46

recognised dental qualifications for the purposes of the Act. By
virtue of the amendment, the following provisions were
incorporated into the statute :“10A. Permission for establishment of new
dental college, new courses of study etc.(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Act or any other law for the time being in force,(a)
no person shall establish an
authority or institution for a course of study or
training (including a post-graduate course of
study or training) which would enable a student
of such course or training to qualify himself for
the grant of recognised dental qualification; or
(b)
no authority or institution
conducting a course of study or training
(including a post-graduate course of study or
training) for grant of recognised dental
qualification shall (i) open a new or higher course of
study or training (including a post-graduate
course of study or training) which would enable
a student of such course or training to qualify
himself for the award of any recognised dental
qualification; or
(ii)
increase its admission
capacity in any course of study or training
(including a post-graduate course of study or
training), including a post-graduate course of
study or training except with the previous
permission of the Central Government obtained
in accordance with the provisions of this section.
10C. Time for seeking permission for
certain existing authorities. - (1) If, after
the 1st day of June, 1992 and on and before the
commencement of the Dentists (Amendment)
Act, 1993 any person has established an
authority or institution granting recognised
dental qualification has opened a new or higher
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

47

course of study or training (including a postgraduate course of study or training) or
increased its admission capacity, such person,
authority or institution, as the case may be, shall
seek, within a period of one year from the
commencement of the Dentists (Amendment)
Act, 1993 the permission of the Central
Government in accordance with the provisions of
Sect. 10A
(2)
If any person or, as the case may be,
any authority or institution granting recognised
dental qualification fails to seek the permission
under sub-section (1), the provisions of Sec. 10B
shall apply, so far as may, be, as if permission of
the Central Government under Sec. 10A has been
refused.]
10B.
Non recognition of dental
qualifications in certain cases.-(1) Where
any authority or institution is establsihed for
grant of recognised dental qualification except
with the previous permission of the Central
Government in accordance with the provisions of
Sec. 10A, no dental qualification granted to any
student of such authority or institution shall be
a recognised dental qualification for the purpose
of this Act.
(2)
Where any authority or institution
granting recognised dental qualification opens a
new or higher course of study or training
(including a post-graduate course of study or
training) except with the previous permission of
the Central Government in accordance with the
provisions of Sec. 10A, no dental qualification
granted to any student of such authority or
institution on the basis of such study or training
shall be a recognised dental qualification for the
purposes of this Act.
(3)
Where any authority or institution
granting
recognised
dental
qualification
increases its admission capacity in any course of
study or training(including a post-graduate
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

48

course of study or training) except with the
previous permission of the Central Government
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 10A, no
dental qualification granted to any student of
such authority or institution on the basis of the
increase in its admission capacity shall be a
recognised dental qualification for the purposes
of this Act.”
54.

Thus upon the amendment coming into force with effect

from 27th August , 1992, no institution could be established for the
grant of recognised dental qualifications and where an institution
stood established, no new course or higher course of study or
training or increase in admission capacity in any course of study or
training in respect of a recognised dental qualification could take
place except with the previous permission of the central
government obtained in accordance with the provisions of the
Section. Such permission required a scheme in the prescribed
form and containing prescribed particulars accompanied by the
prescribed fee to be submitted to the central government. This
scheme was required to be referred by the central government to
the Dental Council of India for its recognition. The Dental Council
of India was vested with the jurisdiction to obtain such other
particulars as may be considered necessary from the person,
authority or institution concerned granting the recognised dental

W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

49

qualification. Thereafter, it may, if the scheme is incomplete and
does not contain necessary particulars, give a reasonable
opportunity to the person, authority or institution for making a
written representation and it shall give opportunity to such
person, authority or institution to rectify the defects, if any,
specified by the Council and consider the scheme, having regard to
the factors specified in Section 10(vii). As per Section 10A(iiib),
the Dental Council of India was thereupon required to submit the
scheme together with its recommendation to the central
government.
Thereafter, in accordance with Section 10A(iv), the
central government was vested with the discretion to approve or
disapprove the scheme. The approval could be with such
conditions as the government may consider necessary.

Such

approval by the government tantamounts to the requisite
permission required by the person, authority or institution under
Section 10A(i).
55.

The legislature provided for the eventuality of the

central government failing to pass an order upon the scheme
submitted to it under sub-section 2. Where no order passed by the
central government has been communicated to the person,
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

50

authority or institution which submitted the scheme within one
year from the date of its submission, Section 10(5) provides that
the scheme shall be deemed to have been approved by the central
government in the form in which it had been submitted. It also
stipulates that the permission of the central government required
under sub-section (1) thereupon shall be deemed to have been
granted. However in computing the time limit specified in subsection (5), the time taken by the person, authority or institution
concerned, submitting the scheme in furnishing particulars called
for by the Dental Council of India or by the government is required
to be excluded.
The considerations which are to weigh with the council
while making its recommendations and with the central
government while passing the order approving or disapproving the
scheme have been set out in sub-section (7) of Section 10A.
Section 10A (7), mandates that where the government
passes the order either approving or disapproving the scheme, the
copy of the order shall be communicated to the person, authority
or institution, concerned.
56.

Learned counsel appearing for the Dental Council of

India has drawn this court's attention to the regulations which
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

51

have been framed by the Dental Council of India in exercise of
powers conferred by Section 10A read with Section 20 of the
Dentists Act, 1948.

These regulations have been called the

Establishment of New Dental Colleges, Opening of Higher Courses
of Study and Increase of Admission Capacity in Dental Colleges
Regulations, 1993.

The same have come into effect on 25th

September, 1993 when they have been published in the official
gazette. These regulations contained the provisions with regard to
the manner in which an application will be made and processed for
approval under Section 10A of the Dental Council of India Act.
They contain a provision under the heading grant of permission
which reads as follows :“Grant of permission :The Central
Government on the recommendations of the
Dental Council of India may issue a letter of
intent to set up a new Dental College with such
conditions or modification in the original
proposal as may be considered necessary. The
formal permission will be granted after the
above conditions and modifications are
accepted and the performance bank guarantees
for the required sums are furnished by the
applicant.
The formal permission will include a
time-bound programme for the establishment
of the Dental College. This permission will also
include a clear-cut definition of preliminary
requirements to be met in respect of buildings,
infrastructurul facilities, dental and allied
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

52

equipment, faculty and staff etc., before
admitting the first batch of students. The
permission will also define annual targets to be
achieved by the applicant to commensurate with
the in-take of students during the following
years.
The above permission to establish a
new Dental College and admit students will be
granted for a period of one year and will be
renewed on yearly basis subject to verification
of the achievement of annual targets and
revalidation of the performance bank
guarantees.
This process of renewal of
permission will continue till such time the
establishment of the Dental College and
expansion of the hospital facilities is completed
and a formal recognition will be granted after
four years of the Dental College by the Dental
Council of India. Unless the college fulfills the
requirements for various stages of development
to the satisfaction of the Dental Council of India
further admissions are liable to be stopped.”
The statutory source of power of the government to
prohibit further admissions as has been done by the impugned
order dated 10/23rd August, 2001 is sought to be derived from
these regulations.
57.

The

petitioners

have

contended

that

they

have

repeatedly represented to the government of India to recall the
impugned directions contained in the order dated 10th/23rd August,
2001 and that the same has been of no avail.
58.

I find that the Government of India issued the order

W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

53

dated 10th/23rd August, 2001 at a stage when the issue of
recognition of the institution, course and degree of the petitioner
had not been finally decided.
59.

At this stage, it would be appropriate to notice the

application which was filed by the present petitioner before the
Apex Court seeking a clarification of the order dated 15th February,
2001 and further directions pursuant thereto. This application
was filed in 2001 itself in Civil Appeal No. 8098 and 8100/1994.
After making detailed submissions on the several inspections of
the college, the petitioner on the averments noticed hereinafter
sought certain prayers which deserve to be also considered:“ 27.
The aforesaid application was
finally disposed of by this Hon'ble Court on
15.2.2001 interalia, directing the Dental
Council of India to take appropriate action to
recognise the degrees of the students. The
said direction was made by this Hon'ble Court
in the light of the observation that the
students were allowed to pursue their studies
pursuant to the orders made by this court.
28.
That the aforesaid order has been
deliberately misconstrued by the Dental
Council of India and have thereby
mischievously recommended the names of
only three students who preferred the
application, knowing well that this is not the
proper procedure to recommend in as much
as in terms of Section 10 (2) of the Dentists
Act, 1948, the BDS, degree of the Institution
concerned is to be notified by making
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

54

amendment int he schedule. The Council is
well aware that the decree awarded
of
the college has to be recognised of the Act of
recognition to BDS degree in as well as the
college has reliably learnt that the Central
Government
has
rejected
the
recommendation of the Dental Council of
India. Thus it is evident that the Dental
Council of India circumvented the orders
passed by this Hon'ble Court.
It is
respectfully submitted that the order dated
15.2.2001 was passed by this Hon'ble Court
keeping in view the order dated 10.7.95,
whereby the students of the Appellant College
were allowed to pursue their studies.
Therefore, while passing the present order the
intention of the Hon'ble Court was to grant
the relief to those students who pursued their
studies pursuant to the orders of this Court
i.e. 10.7.95.”
It has been pointed out by the petitioner that based on
these averments, the following prayers were sought :
“PRAYER
(a)
clarify the order dt. 15.2.12001
passed by this Hon'ble Court in so far as its
applicability is concerned.
(b)
direct the respondent Dental
Council of India (Respondent Nos.1 & 2) to
recommend the recognition of the BDS
Course awarded by the respondent University
to students of Appellant College.
(c)
direct the Union of India to take
appropriate steps in regard to the recognition
of the degree awarded in accordance with law
and also in accordance with the order dated
15.2.2001 passed by this Hon'ble Court in I.A.
Nos. 10-14 in Civil Appeals No. 8098-8900 of
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

55

1995 within a stipulated time frame and/or
(d)
pass such order or further order(s)
as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper
in the facts and circumstances of the case. ”
60.

This application was decided by the Apex Court in terms

of the order dated 18th September, 2001 whereby a limited prayer
was granted in respect of the batches of students who had been
already admitted under orders of the court.

The other reliefs

sought in the application stood rejected for the present.
61.

The prayer was made by the petitioner for recognition of

the course conducted by it was not granted by the Apex Court
while disposing of the petitioner's application in terms of the order
dated 18th September, 2001 which reads as hereunder :
“In these matters it is brought to our notice
that there are very serious questions whether
the Dentists Act, as amended in 1993 is
applicable; whether the affiliation granted to
the college in question is valid or not and
whether the appellant is a minority institution.
In these cases we do not propose to examine
these larger aspects of the matter and what we
are concerned at present is whether the order
made by us on 15.2.2001 should be made
applicable to such of the students who are
similarly placed as the students with whom we
were concerned in that order, we made that
order on 15.2.2001 only on the basis that
pursuant to the studies made by them,
examination taken by them, this court having
made an order that their results should be
declared in which they are declared to have
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

56

passed. When these students had pursued
their studies along with those students in
respect of whom order is already made we do
not think any other order could be made in
respect of them. For such of the students who
had passed along with those students in respect
of whom order was made by us on 15.2.2001
shall be extended and that is confined only to
the batches passing out in years 1989-90,
1990-91, 1991-92. The other reliefs sought for
shall stand rejected for the present. We direct
the Dental Council and the Union of India to
take further steps to implement the order dated
15.2.2001 as extended by us by this order
within a period of one month from today. I.As.
And contempt petitions are disposed of
accordingly.”
62.

The Apex Court therefore had only directed that for such

students who had passed alongwith those students in respect of
whom the order was made on 15th February, 2001, the order shall
be extended and that the same would be confined only to the
batches passing out in the years 1989-90, 1990-91 and 1991-92. In
implementation of the orders dated 15th February, 2001 and 18th
September, 2001, the Government of India issued a notification
dated 12th December, 2001 making an amendment in part I to the
Dentists Act, 1948 to the following effect :“Now, therefore, in pursuance of the Order
dated the 18th September, 2001 of the Supreme
Court of India and in exercise of the powers
conferred by sub-section (2) of section 10 of the
Dentist Act, 1948 (16 of 1948), the Central
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

57

Government, after consultation with the Dental
Council of India, hereby makes the following
further amendments in Par I of the Schedule to
the said Act, namely :In Part I of the Schedule, against
serial no. 38 relating to Lalit Narayan Mithila
Univeristy, Darbhanga, in column 2, under the
recognised dental qualification “Bachelor of
Dental Surgery”, the following shall be inserted
namely :“The above qualification shall be
recognised dental qualification in
respect of BDS students of S.M.Naqui
Imam Dental College, Darbhanga, if
granted in or before 1997”.
63.

The hard fact which remains is that admittedly the

course conducted by the petitioner has even not been approved till
date by the Dental Council of India and the degree has not been
recognised by the Central Government.

It has still not been

included in the list of recognised qualifications in the schedule to
the Dentists Act. The judgment rendered by the Apex Court dated
12th December, 2002 in Civil Appeal 2194/1996 Mata Gujri
Memorial College vs State of Bihar & Ors. is also distinguishable
for the reason that on account on facts intervening during the
pendency of the matter before the Apex Court, relating to
inspections etc., recommendations stood made by the Medical
Council of India as well as by the central government relating to
recognition of the course and for this reason the Apex Court
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

58

directed the university to grant permanent affiliation to the
institution. No such facts have intervened in the present matter.
64.

The petitioner had sought orders with regard to

recognition by the Dental Council of India. This was not granted
even by the Apex Court.
65.

Much emphasis was laid by the petitioner on the fact

that there is a stay of the order withdrawing the affiliation and the
petitioner was permitted to effect admission by the Dental Council
of India.

I find that the petitioner in the instant case has

admittedly not run any classes after the last batch of students
admitted by it in the year 1992 left college.

The University

withdrew the affiliation granted by it which matter is pending
before the court. The question as to whether the petitioner is
required to seek the no objection from the state government is also
in issue and has not been decided so far.

The reasons which

weighed with the government for introducing the amendment in
1992 have been vehemently relied upon by the Dental Council of
India. It has been contended that professional colleges mushroom
but are unable to ensure completion of courses and abandon
institutions resulting in tremendous difficulties being faced by
students who have taken admissions in these institutions. It has
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

59

been contended that the requirement of taking a no objection from
the state government ensures that some responsibility is
maintained in respect of the students who have been admitted to
private institutes.

As per the now prevalent rules, periodic

certification is required from the authorities. In T.M.A. Pai's case,
the Apex Court held that even private minority institutions are
required to abide by the terms of affiliation and recognition. The
petitioner sought interim relief with regard to recognition which
was not granted by the apex court. In the light of the larger issue
at stake and the interests of dental education, students and the
public at large being involved, the petitioner cannot possibly be
permitted to take advantage of the stay of the order withdrawing
the affiliation in its favour which had been granted by the
university or the pendency of the litigation at its instance.
66.

Most pertinent is that, even if it were to be held that the

petitioner had affiliation with the L.N.Mithila University, it is an
admitted fact that the course conducted by the petitioner does not
have the approval of the Dental Council of India. Further the
degree proposed to be awarded to its students has not been
recognised by the Central Government of India in accordance with
the provisions of the Dentists Act.
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

60

67.

It would be useful to notice the pronouncement of the

Apex Court in respect of education. It has been held by the Apex
Court that the recommendations of the Medical Council of India
constituted under the Indian Medical Council Act are not merely
recommendatory but are mandatory and are binding.

In this

behalf the judgment of the Supreme Court in (1998) 6 SCC 131
Medical Council of India vs State of Karnataka reads as follows :“27. ..... .......It is the Medical Council which is
primarily responsible for fixing standards of
medical education and overseeing that these
standards are maintained. It is the Medical
Council which is the principal body to lay down
conditions for recognition of medical colleges
which would include the fixing of intake for
admission to a medical college. We have already
seen in the beginning of this judgment various
provisions of the Medical Council Act. It is,
therefore, the Medical Council which in effect
grants recognition and also withdraws the
same.”
29. A medical student requires gruelling study
and that can be done only if proper facilities are
available in a medical college and the hospital
attached to it has to be well equipped and the
teaching faculty and doctors have to be
competent enough that when a medical student
comes out, he is perfect in the science of
treatment of human beings and is not found
wanting in any way. The country does not want
half-baked medical professionals coming out of
medical colleges when they did not have full
facilities of teaching and were not exposed to
the patients and their ailments during the
course of their study. The Medical Council, in
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

61

all fairness, does not wish to invalidate the
admissions made in excess of that fixed by it
and does not wish to take any action of
withdrawing recognition of the medical colleges
violating the regulation. Henceforth, however,
these medical colleges must restrict the number
of admissions fixed by the Medical Council.
After the insertion of Sections 10-A, 10-B and
10-C in the Medical Council Act, the Medical
Council has framed regulations with the
previous approval of the Central Government
which were published in the Gazette of India
dated 29-9-1993 (though the notification is
dated 20-9-1993). Any medical college or
institution which wishes to increase the
admission capacity in MBBS/higher courses
(including diploma/degree/higher specialities),
has to apply to the Central Government for
permission along with the permission of the
State Government and that of the university
with which it is affiliated and in conformity
with the regulations framed by the Medical
Council. Only the medical college or institution
which is recognised by the Medical Council can
so apply.
30. Having thus held that it is the Medical
Council which can prescribe the number of
students to be admitted in medical courses in a
medical college or institution, it is the Central
Government alone which can direct increase in
the number of admissions but only on the
recommendation of the Medical Council. In
our opinion, the learned Single Judge was right
in his view that no medical college can admit
any student in excess of its admission capacity
fixed by the Medical Council subject to any
increase thereof as approved by the Central
Government and that Sections 10-A, 10-B and
10-C will prevail over Section 53(10) of the
State Universities Act and Section 4(1)(b) of the
State Capitation Fee Act. To say that the
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

62

number of students as permitted by the State
Government and/or the university before
1.6.1992 could continue would be allowing an
illegality to perpetuate for all time to come.
The Division Bench, in our opinion, in the
impugned judgment was not correct in holding
that admission capacity for the purpose of
increase or decrease in each of the medical
colleges/institutions has got to be determined
as on or before 1.6.1992 with reference to what
had been fixed by the State Government or the
admission capacity fixed by the medical
colleges and not with reference to the
minimum standard of education prescribed
under Section 19-A of the Medical Council Act
which the Division Bench said were only
recommendatory. Nivedita Jain case does not
say that all the regulations framed by the
Medical Council with the previous approval of
the Central Government are directory or mere
recommendatory. It is not that only future
admissions will have to be regulated on the
basis of the capacity fixed or determined by the
Medical Council.
The plea of the State
Government that power to regulate admission
to medical colleges is the prerogative of the
State has to be rejected .
31.
What we have said about the authority
of the Medical Council under the Indian Medical
Council Act would equally apply to the Dental
Council under the Dentists Act.”
68.

In the instant case, we are concerned with the

recommendations of the Dental Council of India in the Dentists
Act, 1942. The Dental Council of India is performing functions in
respect of dental education and dentists which are parimateria to
those performed by the Medical Council of India in respect of
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

63

doctors and medical education under the Medical Council of India
Act. By parity of reasoning and the

principles of law laid

down by the Apex Court in the context of the Medical Council of
India and medical education, it has to be held that the
recommendations of the Dental Council of India are not merely
recommendatory but are mandatory and are binding.
69.

So far as education is concerned, the Apex Court has

repeatedly deprecated any order which would have the effect of
deviations or violating statutory rules and regulations. In this
behalf in 1994 (1) SCC 175 State of Punjab & Ors. vs Renuka Singla
& Ors. the Apex Court observed thus :“The admission in medical course throughout
India is governed by different statutory
provisions, including regulations framed under
different Acts. During last several years efforts
have been made to regulate the admissions to the
different medical institutions, in order to achieve
academic excellence. But, at the same time, a
counter-attempt is also apparent and discernible,
by which the candidates, who are not able to get
admissions against the seats fixed by different
statutory authorities, file writ applications and
interim or final directions are given to admit such
petitioners. We fail to appreciate as to how the
High Court or this Court can be generous or
liberal in issuing such directions which in
substance amount to directing the authorities
concerned to violate their own statutory rules and
regulations, in respect of admissions of students.
It cannot be disputed that technical education,
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

64

including
medical
education,
requires
infrastructure to cope with the requirement of
giving proper education to the students, who are
admitted.
Taking into consideration the
infrastructure, equipment, staff, the limit of the
number of admissions is fixed either by the
Medical Council of India or Dental Council of
India.
The High Court cannot disturb that
balance between the capacity of the institution
and number of admissions, on “compassionate
ground”. The High Court should be conscious of
the fact that in this process they are affecting the
education of the students who have already been
admitted, against the fixed seats, after a very
tough competitive examination. According to us,
there does not appear to be any justification on
the part of the High Court, in the present case, to
direct
admission
of
respondent
1
on
“compassionate ground” and to issue a fiat to
create an additional seat which amounts to a
direction to violate Section10-A and Section 10B(3) of the Dentists Act referred to above.”
70.

In 1993 (4) SCC 401, the apex court was considering an

order passed by the High Court on the writ petition of the
respondent students. It appears that some students of the BRS
Institute of Medical Sciences(Dental College) were seeking orders
against

the Kurukshetra

University for holding the first

professional examination.

At the relevant time when the

admissions were made, recognition and affiliation from the
Kurukshetra University had been granted. It is necessary to notice
the fact situation in the matter in order to appreciate the judgment
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

65

passed by the Apex Court. In its judgment which is reported at
1993 (4) SCC 401 Guru Nanak Dev University vs Parminder Kr.
Bansal & Ors. the court noticed thus :“2.
Guru Nanak Dev University is
aggrieved by the orders dated August 17, 1992, of
the High Court in Civil Writ Petition Nos. 2732
and 4928 of 1992 respectively, directing the
regularisation of the admission of the first
respondents in each of these appeals, to the
Internship Course.
3.
Regulation 27 of the Guru Nanak Dev
University regulating eligibility for admission to
the Internship Course provides :
“(a)
Compulsory
Rotating
Housemanship. - Every candidate, on passing
the final MBBS examination, shall undergo 12
months' training as laid down by the Faculty of
Medical Science
before he is allowed full
registration by the State Medical Council. The
work done in a Military Hospital or any other
recognised Institute(names given in the
appendix) shall be accepted for this training.
(emphasis
supplied)
(b)
There shall be an oral test at the
end of the internship programme to be conducted
by a Board of the College set up by the Principal
of the College. The Board will review the
certificates of the work given by the Heads of the
Departments or the Head of the Hospital where
the candidate has worked and also assess the
candidate through an oral examination. If the
Board is not satisfied with the performance of the
candidate, the candidate shall be required to put
in extra three or six months of internship.
Provided that in the case of a student who goes
abroad for internship training and cannot appear
in the test at the end of the term being in a
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

66

foreign country, the test may be conducted in his
respective institution and report sent to the
Principal of the concerned College from which
the student had gone, along with the report of his
work and if the Principal is satisfied he may
recommend to the University for grant of a
degree.”
The validity of this regulation, though
sought to be raised, was presumably not argued
and has not been gone into by the High Court.
Prima facie, there is no valid ground to assail the
constitutional validity of this regulation.
4.
The High Court, by its interim orders
directed the admission of the two respondents to
the Internship Course with effect from April 1,
1992, on which date, admittedly, they did not
possess the requisite eligibility. They had not
passed the MBBS examination. Pursuant to the
interim orders the respondents, were so
admitted. Thereafter, by the final order dated
August 27, 1992, the High Court as a logical
corollary and consequence of the implementation
of the interim orders, directed that their
internship be regularised.
5.
Shri Gambhir, learned counsel for the
University says that the very implication of the
idea of regularisation contained within it the
premise that the initial admission itself was
irregular. He submitted that the University was
confronted with a fait accompli by virtue of
interlocutory orders. The final order in the writ
petition did no more than validate and
perpetuate the interlocutory error without any
pronouncement on or adjudication of the basic
issues of eligibility. Shri Gambhir aired a serious
grievance that these type of orders would
introduce an element of indiscipline in academic
life and expose the system to ridicule and render
any meaningful control of academic work
impossible.
He
relied
upon
certain
pronouncements of this Court to support his
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

67

contention that in academic matters courts
should be wary in directing the admissions to
colleges by means of interim directions which
would create complications later and expose even
the beneficiaries of such orders to difficulties
when the final adjudication goes against them.”
71.

The Apex Court has repeatedly stipulated that courts

ought not to be liberal or generous while passing orders in respect
of admissions and examinations especially with regard to
institutions wherein issues relating to recognition thereof are
concerned and are at issue and that the requirements of law are to
be strictly enforced.
72.

The Apex Court had occasion to examine a matter where

students seeking reliefs in respect of a dental college which was
not yet recognised in accordance with law.

In its judgment

reported at 1995 Supp (1) SCC 304 Dental Council of India vs
Harpreet Kaur Bal & Ors., the apex court set aside the judgment of
the High Court and observed thus :
“4.
There are many pronouncements of
this Court cautioning against exercise of
jurisdiction characterised more by benevolence
than on settled legal principles. A relief must be
such as could be considered permissible in law
and worked out by the application of legally
recognised principles. The decision must have
legitimacy of legal reasoning and should not
incur the criticism of lacking objectivity of
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

68

purpose and rational and legal justification.
Where an educational institution embarks upon
granting admissions without the requisite
affiliation and recognition and the students joint
he institution with their eyes wide open as t the
lack of legitimacy in the admission, it would be
preposterous to direct the University to hold
examinations for the benefit of such students.
We cannot sufficiently deplore this attitude and
approach. The High Court has, by its order,
simply bolstered the hopes and aspirations of
these students without any means of gratifying
these expectations in a manner known to law.
We have, therefore, no hesitation in setting aside
the order under appeal as totally unjustified.
5.
Instead of the kind of order that the
High Court has persuaded itself to make, it
should, perhaps, have directed the Union of India
to forward the application for recognition stated
to have been submitted sometime in 1993 by the
institution to the Dental Council of India and, in
turn, directed the Dental Council of India to
consider that application and decide within a
time-frame whether it would accord the
recognition or not.
These were the only
permissible reliefs grantable in the case.”
Having held thus, the apex court set aside the order of
the High Court and directed the government of India to forward
the application submitted to it by the institute to the Dental
Council of India and passed further directions in respect of the
consideration of the application of the Dental Council.
73.

In the light of the view taken by the apex court in Dental

Council of India vs Harpreet Kaur, it is evident that the prayers

W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

69

made in the writ petition cannot be granted without decision and
adjudication of the issues relating to affiliation and recognition of
the course conducted by the petitioner. Inasmuch as these issues
are pending in proceedings, one before the apex court and, the
other, before the High Court of Judicature at Patna, this court
cannot even issue the directions which were issued in the Harpreet
Kaur Bal case(supra).
74.

In view of the above, the central government is bound to

look at the larger interest of the students at large who may be
persuaded to take admission to the course conducted by the
respondents in case such a caution or prohibition was not issued
by the government. Undoubtedly the petitioner is in litigation and
there is a cloud over its affiliation. The issue as to whether it is to
be required to seek a no objection certificate from the state
authority or not has also not been finally adjudicated upon. The
petitioner at one time had itself contended that it is required to get
the requisite no objection and had sought a mandamus to be
issued to the authorities in CWJC 5824/1993.
75.

In AIR 1986 SC 1490

A.P. Christians

Medical

Educational Society vs Government of Andhra Pradesh & Anr., it
was held thus :W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

70

“7.
Even while narrating the facts, we
think, we have said enough to justify a refusal
by us to exercise our discretionary jurisdiction
under Art. 136 of the Constitution. We do not
have any doubt that the claim of the petitioner
to start a minority educational institution was
no more than the merest pretence. Except the
words, “As the Christian Minorities Educational
Institutions” occurring in one of the objects of
the society, as mentioned in the memorandum
of association, there is nothing whatever to
justify the claim of the society that the
institutions proposed to be started by it were
'minority educational institutions' . Every letter
written by the society whether to the Central
Government, the State Government or the
University contained false and misleading
statements. As we had already mentioned the
petitioner had the temerity to admit or pretend
to admit students in the first year MBBS course
without any permission being granted by the
Government for the starting of the medical
college and without any affiliation being granted
by the University. The society did this despite
the strong protest voiced by the University and
the several warnings issued by the university.
The society acted in defiance of the University
and the Government, in disregard of the
provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Education
Act, the Osmania University Act and the
Regulations of the Osmania University and with
total indifference to the interest and welfare of
the students. The society has played havoc with
the careers of several crore students and
jeopardised their future irretrievably. Obviously
the so-called establishment of a medical college
was in the nature of a financial adventure for
the so-called society and its office bearers, but
an educational misadventure for the students.
Many, many conditions had to be fulfilled
before affiliation could be granted by the
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

71

University. Yet the society launched into the
venture without fulfilling a single condition
beyond appointing someone as Principal. No
one could have imagined that a medical college
could function without a teaching hospital,
without the necessary scientific equipment,
without the necessary staff, without the
necessary buildings and without the necessary
funds. Yet that is what the society did or
pretended to do. We do not have any doubt that
the society and the so-called institutions were
started as business ventures with a view to make
money from gullible individuals anxious to
obtain admission to professional colleges. It
was nothing but a daring imposture and skul
duggery. By no stretch of imagination, can we
confer on it the status and dignity of a minority
institution.
xxx
10.
Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned counsel
for the students who have been admitted into
the MBBS course of this institution, pleaded
that the interests of the students should not be
sacrificed because of the conduct or folly of the
management and that they should be permitted
to appear at the University examination
notwithstanding
the
circumstance
that
permission and affiliation had not been granted
to the institution. He invited our attention to
the circumstance that students of the Medical
college established by the Daru Salam
Educational Trust were permitted to appear at
the examination notwithstanding the fact that
affiliation had not by then been granted by the
University. Shri Venugopal suggested that we
might issue appropriate directions to the
University to protect the interests of the
students. We do not think that we can possibly
accede to the request made by Shri Venugopal
on behalf of the students. Any direction of the
nature sought by Shri Venugopal would be in
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

72

clear transgression of the provisions of the
University Act and the regulations of the
University. We cannot by our fiat direct the
University to disobey the statute to which it
ownes its existence and the regulations made by
the University itself.
We cannot imagine
anything more destructive of the rule of law
than a direction by the court to disobey the laws.
The case of the medical college started by the
Daru-Salam Trust appears to stand on a
different footing as we find from the record
placed before us that permission had been
granted by the State Government to the Trust to
start the medical college and on that account,
the University had granted provisional
affiliation. We also find that the Medical
Council of India took strong and serious
exception to the grant of provisional affiliation
whereupon the University withdrew the
affiliation granted to the college. We are unable
to treat what the University did in the case of
the Daru-Salam Medical College as a precedent
in the present case to direct the university to do
something which it is forbidden from doing by
the University Act and the regulations of the
University.”
76.

Even if it were to be found that the petitioner had some

kind of a right, it has been held by the Apex Court that such
individual right has to give way to overriding interests of the public
at large. In this behalf, in (1997) 1 SCC 134 entitled Ramniklal N.
Bhutta and another vs. State of Maharashtra and others, the Court
held thus:“10. Before parting with this case, we think it
necessary to make a few observations relevant
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

73

to land acquisition proceedings. Our country is
now launched upon an ambitious programme
of all-round economic advancement to make
our economy competitive in the world market.
We are anxious to attract foreign direct
investment to the maximum attain the pace of
progress achieved by some of the Asian
countries, referred to as “Asian tigers”, e.g.
Sough Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. It is,
however, recognised on all hands that the
infrastructure necessary for sustaining such a
pace of progress is woefully lacking in our
country. The means of transportation, power
and communications are in dire need of
substantial improvement, expansion and
modernization. These things very often call for
acquisition of land and that too without any
delay. It is, however, natural that in most of
these courts. These things very often call for
acquisition of land and that too without any
delay. It is, however, natural that in most of
these cases, the persons affected challenge the
acquisition proceedings in courts.
These
challenges are generally in the shape of writ
petitions filed in High Courts. Invariably, stay
of acquisition is asked for and in some cases,
orders by way of stay or injunction are also
made. Whatever may have been the practices
in the past, a time has come where the courts
should keep the larger public interest in mind
while exercising their power of granting
stay/injunction. The power under Article 226
is discretionary. It will be exercised only in
furtherance of interests of justice and not
merely on the making out of a legal point. And
in the matter of land acquisition for public
purposes, the interest of justice and the public
interest coalesce. They are very often one and
the same. Even in a civil suit,
granting of injunction or other similar orders,
more particularly of an interlocutory nature is
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

74

equally discretionary. The courts have to
weigh the public interest vis-a-vis the private
interest while exercising the power under
Article 226 --- indeed any of their discretionary
powers. It may even be open to the High Court
to direct, in case it finds finally that the
acquisition was vitiated on account of noncompliance with some legal requirement that
the persons interested shall also be entitled to
a particular amount of damages to be awarded
as a lump sum or calculated at a certain
percentage of compensation payable. There
are many ways of affording appropriate relief
and redressing a wrong; quashing the
acquisition proceedings is not the only mode of
redress. To wit, it is ultimately a matter of
balancing the competing interests. Beyond
this, it is neither possible nor advisable to say.
We hope and trust that these considerations
will be duly borne in mind by the courts while
dealing with challenges to acquisition
proceedings.”
77.

It has been authoritatively held in a catena of

authoritative and binding judicial precedents that wider public
interest is liable to be borne in mind while exercising the power of
issuing a writ and granting a stay and injunction.
78.

In AIR 1955 SC 425 Sangram Singh vs Election Tribunal,

Kotah & Anr. it was held thus :“13.
The jurisdiction which Arts. 226 and
136 confer entitles the High Courts and this
Court to examine the decisions of all Tribunals
to see whether they have acted illegally. That
jurisdiction cannot be taken away by a
legislative device that purports to confer power
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

75

on a tribunal to act illegally by enacting a
statute that its illegal acts shall become legal
the moment the tribunal chooses to say they
are legal. The legality of an act or conclusion is
something that exists outside and apart from
the decision of an inferior tribunal. xxx
14.
That, however, is not to say that the
jurisdiction will be exercised whenever there is
an error of law. The High Courts do not, sand
should not, act as Courts of appeal under Art.
226. Their powers are purely discretionary and
though no limits can be placed upon that
discretion it must be exercised along
recognised lines and not arbitrarily; and one of
the limitations imposed by the Courts on
themselves is that they will not exercise
jurisdiction in this class of case unless
substantial injustice has ensued, or is likely to
ensue. They will not allow themselves to be
turned into Courts of appeal or revision to set
right mere errors of law which do not occasion
injustice in a broad and general sense, for
though no legislature can impose limitations
on these constitutional powers it is a sound
exercise of discretion to bear in mind the policy
of the legislature to have disputes about these
special rights decided as speedily as may be.
Therefore, writ petitions should not be lightly
entertained in this class of case.”
79.

In AIR 1957 SC 227 A.M. Allison & Anr. Vs B.L. Sen &

Ors., it was held thus :“17.
xxx Proceedings by way of certiorari
are “not of course”. (Vide Halsbury's 'Laws of
England', Hailsham Edition, Vol.9, paras 1480
and 1481, pp. 877-878). The High Court of
Assam had the power to refuse the writs if it
was satisfied that there was no failure of justice,
and in these appeals which are directed against
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

76

the orders of the High Court in applications
under Art. 226, we could refuse to interfere
unless we are satisfied that the justice of the
case requires it. But we are not so satisfied. We
are of opinion that, having regard to the merits
which have been concurrently found in favour
of the respondents both by the Deputy
Commissioner, Sibsagar, and the High Court,
we should decline to interfere.”
80.

Noteworthy in this behalf are the observations of the

Apex Court in AIR 2000 SC 1508 entitled Indian Overseas Bank
Vs. I.O.B. Staff Canteen Workers' Union & Another in which it was
held thus:“The learned single Judge seems to have
undertaken an exercise, impermissible for him
in exercising writ jurisdiction, by liberally
reappreciating the evidence and drawing
conclusions of his own on pure questions of
fact, unmindful, though aware fully, that he is
not exercising any appellate jurisdiction over
the awards passed by a Tribunal, presided over
by a Judicial Officer. The findings of fact
recorded by a fact-finding authority duly
constituted for the purpose and which
ordinarily should be considered to have
become final, cannot be disturbed for the mere
reason of having been based on materials or
evidence not sufficient or credible in the
opinion of the writ Court to warrant those
findings at any rate, as long as they are based
upon some material which are relevant for the
purpose or even on the ground that there is yet
another view which can b reasonably and
possibly one taken. The Division Bench was
not only justified but well merited in its
criticism of the order of the learned single
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

77

Judge and in ordering restoration of the Award
of the Tribunal. On being taken through the
findings of the Industrial Tribunal as well as
the order of the learned single Judge and the
judgment of the Division Bench, we are of the
view that the Industrial Tribunal had
overwhelming materials which constituted
ample and sufficient basis for recording its
findings, as it did, and the manner of
consideration undertaken, the objectivity of
approach adopted and reasonableness of
findings recorded seem to be unexceptionable.
The only course, therefore, open to the writ
Judge was the relevant criteria laid down by
this Court, before sustaining the claim of the
canteen workmen, on the facts found and
recorded by the fact-finding authority and not
embark upon an exercise of re-assessing the
evidence and arriving at findings of ones own,
altogether giving a complete go-bye even to the
facts specifically found by the Tribunal below.”
81.

Admittedly, admissions were effected by the petitioner

only for three batches which were the 1989-90, 1990-91 and 199192 batches. They completed their course under orders of the Apex
Court and were granted recognition of the degrees also under the
orders dated 15th February, 2001 and 18th September, 2001.
Admittedly the petitioner has not effected any admissions to the
courses thereafter.

When it sought permission, it was not

permitted to admit any other students. The petitioner itself has
contended that the Dental Council has yet to decide the case of its
approval and recommend the recognition of its course. There is no
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

78

material or inspection with regard to the current position of the
facilities and infrastructure with the petitioner.
82.

In the meetings held by the government on 27th

December, 2002 and 23rd August, 2003, all present were of the
view that fresh admissions cannot be effected and that publicity
should be given to the prohibitory orders issued by the
government. The recognition given by the central government
vide its notification dated 12th December, 2001 was restricted to
those batches of students who were admitted up to 1992 and not
beyond.

The central government had issued its orders in

discharge of duty imposed by it under the regulations. The state
government had objected to giving its consent in the meeting held
with the Ministry. Certainly the government cannot be faulted for
issuing the direction prohibiting admissions when the institution
having complied with the statutory requirements.
83.

The petitioner has made a grievance that the impugned

order of prohibitting admissions was passed on the sole ground
that the affiliation of the petitioner stood withdrawn by the
University and that no other reasons can be added in support of
this. Undoubtedly, the order reads that the prohibition is being
issued for withdrawl of affiliation by the University and this order
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

79

stands stayed in the appeal of the petitioner which is pending
before the Apex Court. The principles laid down by the Supreme
Court in Mohinder Gill vs Chief Election Commissioner and
Chander Singh vs State of Rajasthan(supra) cannot be disputed.
However, in the facts of the present case, the contentions of the
petitioner are pending the adjudication in proceedings before the
Apex Court and, the other, in proceedings before the High Court of
judicature at Patna. So far as the matter of admissions of students
is concerned with, it effects not only the petitioner but also effects
candidates who are admitted to the institution and has a larger
effect on the public at large. I have noticed above the several
pronouncements of the Apex Court holding that requirements of
affiliation, recognition and obtaining of requisite certification by
professional institutions cannot be and ought not to be by passed
or compromised with under any circumstance. For this reason, as
already noticed hereinabove, without final adjudication on the
issues raised by the petitioner relating to its affiliation, recognition
and no objection certificate from the state government, the
petitioner cannot possibly be permitted to take advantage of the
interim order of stay on the withdrawl of affiliation to effect
admissions to its institutions.
W.P.(C) No. 5049/2003

80

Granting the petitioner the prayers made in this writ
petition may have the effect of permitting an institution to effect
admissions without fulfilling statutory requirements which has
been deprecated by the Apex Court in several pronouncements
noticed above.
For all the foregoing reasons, the petitioner cannot
possibly be granted the prayers made in this writ petition.
This writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
