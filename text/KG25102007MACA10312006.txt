KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:

MAC APP No. 1031-36/2006

page 1 of 9

Challenge in the present appeal has been made to the
impugned Award passed by the Tribunal mainly on two grounds
that the insurance company has not been made liable to satisfy the
Award amount and secondly compensation granted by the
Tribunal is on the lower side. The facts of the case in brief are that
one Shri Shambu Saran was travelling as a pillion rider on a motor
cycle bearing registration No. DL-7SL-0291, which was owned and
driven by Shri Dhananjay Kumar, respondent No. 1 herein. The
said motor cycle when reached near Sindhu Village Mor met with
an accident resulting in fatal injuries to the said pillion rider Mr.
Shambu Saran who ultimately succumbed to his injuries on 24th
June, 2005 near GTB hospital. A criminal case vide FIR No.
238/2000 was registered at P.S. Alipur. The deceased was aged
about 45 years and was earning a sum of Rs. 40,000/- from his
business. The deceased was survived by his widow and 4 children
besides his mother. The claim petition was contested by the
insurer of the vehicle while respondent No.1 did not choose to
contest the same. The Tribunal after considering the pleadings of
MAC APP No. 1031-36/2006

page 2 of 9

the parties and evidence led by them had awarded a sum of Rs.
3,68,669.60 against the claim amount of Rs. 10 lakhs. Being not
satisfied with the quantum of compensation as well as exoneration
of the insurance company, the appellant has preferred the present
appeal assailing the said Award of the Tribunal.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties at
considerable length.
Counsel for the appellant has confined his arguments
only to claim modification of the impugned judgment to the
extent

to make the Insurance Company liable to pay the

compensation amount to the appellants.

Counsel for the

appellants contended that this Court in FAO NO. 517/2001 has
already taken the view holding the Insurance Company liable even
for the death of a pillion rider.
Counsel for the appellant contended that although the
Supreme Court in United India Insurance Co. Ltd., Shimla
Vs. Tilak Singh & Ors. 2006 (4) SCALE 67 has taken a view
that the Insurance Company owe no liability towards the injuries
MAC APP No. 1031-36/2006

page 3 of 9

suffered by the deceased who was a pillion rider unless the
insurance policy specifically covers the risk for the death or bodily
injury of such a pillion rider but before the Hon'ble Apex Court,
Notification duly issued by the Tariff Advisory Committee dtd.
13.3.1978 was not placed and the absence of the same led to the
said finding by the Supreme Court. The counsel, therefore, urged
that this court in FAO No. 517/2001 decided on 14.5.2007 has
made reference to the said Notification and has observed that the
Insurance Company did not disclose the existence of the said
Notification before the Apex Court.

The reference of the said

Notification has also been made by the Kerala High Court in
Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Daniel, 2000 ACJ
1391 and also by the Himachal Pradesh High Court in United
India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Prem Singh & Ors. 2001 ACJ
1445.

This court in the said order further observed that the

Notification in question incorporates a deemed amendment of
policies issued w.e.f. 25.3.77, mandating that the death or bodily
injury to a pillion rider would be at par with a claim of a third
MAC APP No. 1031-36/2006

page 4 of 9

party. The Counsel for the appellant, thus, contends that in view
of the said order of this Court, the finding of the Tribunal is legally
impermissible and cannot be upheld.
Per contra counsel for the respondent contended that
in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Tilak Singh's
case (Supra), no reliance can be placed on the judgment of this
Court and therefore, no fault can be found with the findings given
by the Tribunal.
Counsel for the respondent thus submitted that the
pillion rider unless specifically covered under the policy cannot be
treated as a third party.
I have gone through all the said judgments cited by the
counsel for the parties.
Counsel appearing for the Insurance Company failed
to point out as to whether the said Notification of instructions of
the Tariff Advisory Committee was brought to the notice of the
Apex Court in

Tilak Raj's case (Supra).

Counsel for the

Insurance Company has also not disputed the factum and
MAC APP No. 1031-36/2006

page 5 of 9

existence

of the said instructions

of the Tariff Advisory

Committee as have been referred to by the learned Single Judge
of this Court in FAO No. 517/2007.
The Division Bench of Himachal Pradesh High Court in
Prem Singh's case (Supra) has held the Insurance Company
liable for the injuries caused to the pillion rider on the same very
basis of instructions of Tariff Advisory Committee dated 13.3.78.
It would be appropriate to refer to relevant paras of the aforesaid
judgment as under:
“16. We, however, need not go into the
question. We find that compensation in respect
of the pillion riders was considered by the Tariff
Advisory Committee and it was decided tha death
of or bodily injury to any person including person
conveyed in or on the motor cycle would be
covered provided such person is not carried for
hire or reward. These instructions were made
effective w.e.f 25.3.1977. The Tariff Advisory
Committee had directed:
“All existing policies should be deemed
to incorporates this amendment automatically
irrespective of the fact whether it is an 'Act policy'
or a 'comprehensive policy'.
17. We requested Ms. Devyani Sharma,
learned counsel for the appellant insurance
MAC APP No. 1031-36/2006

page 6 of 9

company to verify if the instructions of the Tariff
Advisory Committee dated 13.3.78 were followed
by the appellant insurance company. Ms. Devyani
Sharma, on instructions
from the appellant
insurance company, fairly conceded that the
instructions of the Tariff Advisory Committee were
followed by the appellant insurance company.
These instructions were noticed by a Division
Bench of Kerala High Court in Oriental Insurance
Co. Ltd. Vs. Daniel, 2000, ACT 1391 (Kerala)
18. In this view of the matter, we hold that
pillion rider is covered under the Act policy, Exh.
PX, and insurance company is liable to indemnify
the insured.”
It would be thus

evident that

with the above

instructions of the Tariff Advisory Committee dated 13.3.78, the
risk of the pillion rider is fully covered under the insurance policy
whether the same is an 'Act policy' or 'comprehensive policy',
provided such person is not carried for hire or reward.
In view of the said

decision, unless

the

Insurance

Company comes out with a case that the said instructions of the
Tariff Committee were cancelled or modified, there cannot be any
justification or plausible reason to ignore the instructions of the
Tariff Advisory Committee.

MAC APP No. 1031-36/2006

It was rather incumbent upon the

page 7 of 9

Insurance Company to have placed the said instructions of Tariff
Advisory Committee before the Tribunal during the trial of the
case and even in the present appeal also, no such instructions
were brought on record.
Be that as it may, reliance to these very instructions has
been made by the Division Bench of

Himachal Pradesh High

Court and by the Kerala High Court as well as by this Court.
Therefore, it can be safely assumed that these instructions exist
and they are legally binding upon the Insurance Company.
Moreover, in the present case, the accident took place
in 2005 and on that date the Act of 1988 was in full force.
Therefore, the liability of the Insurance Company has to be
adjudged under Section 147 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. A bare
perusal of the said Section 147 would clearly reveal that the
liability of the Insurance Company is now unlimited. Moreover,
the words “ any person” used in Section 147 (1) (b) (i) of the Act
would include a pillion rider.
In the light of the above discussion, I find myself in
MAC APP No. 1031-36/2006

page 8 of 9

agreement

with the contentions raised by the counsel for the

appellant that the Insurance Company cannot resile

from its

liability to pay the award amount to the appellants. The order of
the

Tribunal

is

thus

modified

to

that

extent

and

the

respondent/Insurance Company is held liable to pay the award
amount in terms of the impugned award dated 22.8.2006, with
interest @ 12% per annum from the date of institution of the claim
petition till realisation.

With these directions, appeal stands disposed of.
