Briefly stated the facts of the case are as follow:-

Arb.P.No.437/2007

Page 1 of 4

The Border Security Force (hereinafter to be referred as the
'BSF') had awarded a contract for construction of a school building
at its Campus at Jalalabad, Firrozpur (Punjab) to respondent No. 1.
Respondent No. 1 in turn had awarded a sub-contract to the
petitioner for execution of certain works in relation to construction
of the building in the BSF Campus Jalalabad, Firrozpur (Punjab) and
two agreements in that regard were executed between the
petitioner and respondent No. 1 and they are work order No. 78A/WP-6/RNN/04 dated 09.02.2004 and work order No. 270A/WP06/RNN/04 dated 05.05.2004. Both these agreements contained an
arbitration clause which provide for adjudication of disputes
between the parties under the above referred agreements through
the process of arbitration.
3

Ms. Saroj Bidawat appearing on behalf of the petitioner has

contended that the work awarded under the first work order was
completed by the petitioner to the entire satisfaction of respondent
No. 1 and according to her there is no dispute between the parties
under the said work order. It is submitted that the disputes and
differences have arisen between the parties only in respect of
second work order dated 05.05.2004 for the adjudication of which a
request has been made for appointment of an arbitrator.

Mr Pathak appearing on behalf of the respondents has not

Page 2 of 4

disputed the existence of the arbitration agreement and the
disputes and differences between the parties under the work order
dated 05.05.2004. However, Mr. Pathak has contended that the
respondents have already appointed an arbitrator after receiving
notice of the present petition in terms of arbitration agreement
between the parties and therefore he has contended that the
present petition may be dismissed as having become infructuous.
However, Ms. Saroj Bidawat appearing on behalf of the petitioner,
on the other hand, has contended that since the arbitrator was
appointed by the respondents after receiving notice of the present
petition, that appointment according to her is of no consequence
because the respondents have lost their right to appoint the
arbitrator of their choice after filing of the present petition. She has
placed reliance on two judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
ACE Pipeline Contracts (P) Ltd. Vs. Bharat Petroleum
Corporation Ltd. (2007) 5 SCC 304 and Union of India Vs.
Bharat Battery Manufacturing Co. (P) Ltd. (2007) 7 SCC 684.
5

It is not disputed by the counsel appearing on behalf of the

respondents that the appointment of arbitrator was made by the
respondents only after receiving the notice of the present petition.
In view of the law laid down by the Hon'ble apex Court in the
abovementioned judgments referred and relied upon on behalf of
Arb.P.No.437/2007

the petitioner, the respondents have lost their right to appoint an
arbitrator of their choice. Hence the arbitrator for adjudication of
disputes

between

the

parties

under

the

work

order

dated

05.05.2004 has to be appointed by the Court.
6

In view of the above and having regard to the facts and

circumstances of the case and the submissions made by the
learned counsel for the parties, Mr.

D.S.

Paweriya,

former

Additional District & Sessions Judge (Mobile No. 9810433390,
Chamber No. 49, Tehsil Building, Tis Hazari, Delhi-110054) is
hereby appointed as the sole arbitrator for adjudicating the
disputes and differences between the parties under the work order
dated 05.05.2004. The fee of the learned arbitrator is fixed at Rs.
25,000/- to be shared equally by both the parties. The parties are
directed to appear before the learned Arbitrator for further
directions at 4.00 P.M. on 7.3.2008.
7

A copy of this order be sent to the learned arbitrator forthwith

for information.

The present petition stands disposed of accordingly.
