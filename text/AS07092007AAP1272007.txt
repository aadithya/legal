and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to Act) for
appointment of an arbitrator.

Notice of the petition was

duly served upon the respondent who put in appearance

There is no contest to the application.

work

of

constructions

of

Multiplex

Commercial Stores at Janakpuri,

Cinema

cum

New Delhi by the

respondent vide letter dated 4.4.2002 as per terms and
conditions contained in the said letter.

After execution of

the work by the petitioner, the respondent failed to make
the payment as claimed.

The contract contained an

arbitration clause namely clause 41. As per this clause in
case of any dispute having arisen between the parties each
party is to appoint its own arbitrator and the two
arbitrators so appointed shall appoint the third arbitrator
and the dispute has to be resolved by the arbitral tribunal
so constituted. Petitioner sent legal notice dated 23.1.2007
calling upon the respondent to appoint its own arbitrator
and also informing the respondent that petitioner had
appointed Justice J.K. Mehra, retired Judge of the High
Court, as its own arbitrator.

The respondent failed to

appoint its arbitrator within 30 days of the receipt of the
notice. Petitioner, therefore, has approached this Court for
appointment of an Arbitrator for and on behalf of the
respondent. The dispute inter se the parties is technical in
nature

as

the

petitioner

carried

out

the

work

of

constructions of Multiplex Cinema cum Commercial Stores
at Janakpuri, New Delhi. Therefore, considering the nature
of dispute, the Court has to consider the qualification and

respondent. His fees is fixed at Rs. 15,000/- per hearing,
subject to maximum fifteen hearings, payable by the
respondent.
