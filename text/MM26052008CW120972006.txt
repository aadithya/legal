This writ petition involves the interpretation of Section 15(1), 2 Proviso

of Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred
to as SICA), which reads as follows:“15. Reference to Board.-- (1) When an industrial
company has become a sick industrial company, the
Board of Directors of the company, shall, within
sixty days from the date of finalisation of the duly
audited accounts of the company for the financial
year as at the end of which the company has become
a sick industrial company, make a reference to the
Board for determination of the measures which shall
be adopted with respect to the company:
..................................
..................................
Provided also that on or after the commencement of
the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial
and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and
Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 where a
reference is pending before the Board for Industrial
and Financial Reconstruction such reference shall
abate if the secured creditors, representing not less
than three fourth in value of the amount outstanding
against financial assistance disbursed to the
borrower of such secured creditors have taken any
measures to recover their secured debt under sub
section (4) of section 13 of that Act.”

W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 2 of 20

Appellate Authority for Industrial & Financial Reconstruction (AAIFR), New
Delhi.
3.

The facts of the case briefly stated are as follows:-

(a)

The respondent No. 2 company was manufacturing television sets and

accessories and availed of loan advances and other credit facilties from the
petitioner Punjab National Bank and other financial institutions and on the basis
of its audited balance sheet of the financial year ending 31st March, 1999, the
company sought a reference before the Board for Industrial and Financial
Reconstruction (BIFR) under Section 15(1) of the SICA leading to registration of
case No. 183/2000. By order dated 15th November, 2000, the BIFR rejected the
reference as not maintainable. The operative portion of the said order reads as
follows:“5. Having regard to the forgoing analysis, it is
clear that M/s BEL have indulged in serious
manipulation of accounts. It is also clear that they
have been trying to deceive the banks/FIs by
providing misleading financial statements and stock
statements.
The company has also furnished
misleading figures of performance for the quarter
ended 30.6.1999 to its shareholders. The Bench,

W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 3 of 20

therefore, concludes that the company's financial
statements are not reliable and the promoters have
approached the Board with unclean hands. The
reference filed by the company u/s 15(1) is,
therefore, dismissed as non-maintainable.”

(b)

In the meanwhile, the petitioner No.1/PNB had preferred two Original

Applications being OA Nos. 121/2000 and 641/2000 under Section 15 of the
Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993.
(c)

The order dated 15th November, 2000 passed by the BIFR was challenged

by the respondent No. 2 company before AAIFR, which appeal was dismissed on
10th August, 2001.
(d)

Another reference was made by the respondent No. 2 company on the basis

of audited balance sheet ending the year 31st March, 2001 under Section 15(1) of
SICA and consequent thereto during the pendency of the inquiry under Section 16
of the SICA, proceedings in OAs No. 121/2000 and 641/2000 filed by the
petitioner before the DRT remained stayed under Section 22 of the SICA.
(e)

Another application was made on the basis of the audited balance sheet of

the financial year ending 31st March, 2002 under Section 15(1) of the SICA and a

W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 4 of 20

case No. 741/2002 was registered.
(f)

On 4th August, 2004, in a meeting of the Consortium of lender Banks, the

petitioner Punjab National Bank as a Bank was authorised to take steps under
Section 13(4) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and
Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as SARFAESI
Act). On 18th September, 2004, the petitioner took the possession of secured
assets of the company under Section 13(4) of SARFAESI Act read with Rule 8 of
the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002.
(g)

on 1st November, 2004, the reference case No. 334/2001and 740/2002 filed

under Section 15(1) of the SICA came up for hearing and in view of Section
13(4) of the SARFAESI Act and Section 15, 3rd proviso, proceedings before the
BIFR were held to have abated by its order. The said order dated 1st November,
2004 led to the appeal before the AAIFR, which according to the petitioner was
beyond 8 months and thus beyond the statutorily prescribed maximum period of
60 days under section 25 of the SICA permitting the appeal within the said
period. The petitioner bank filed its reply inter alia pleading for the dismissal of
W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 5 of 20

the appeal on the ground of delay. On 20th April, 2006, the AAIFR allowed the
appeal filed by the respondent No.2, remanding back the case to the BIFR. The
said order of the AAIFR has led to the challenge before this Court in the present
writ petition. The impugned order reads as follows:“1.

This appeal is filed by M/s Bestavision
Electronics Limited (BEL) is directed against the
impugned order dated 1/11/2004 passed by BIFR in
case No. 740/2002. By the aforesaid order, the
reference filed by the appellant company was abated
on the ground that Punjab National Bank (PNB) on
behalf of the Consortium of Banks, had taken
possession of one of the properties charged to the
Banks u/s 13(4) of SARFAESI Act 2002.
2. During the pendency of this appeal, the Ld.
Counsel brought to our notice that the company has
successfully negotiated the settlement of its dues
with its secured creditors; namely, PSIDC, OBC,
IOB, PICUP and PNB. The appellant company is
now is the process of effecting payment to its
secured creditors in accordance with the terms of
settlement. Section 13(4) of SARFAESI Act has
become infructuous. We, therefore, set aside the
impugned order dated 1/11/2004 and remand the
case to BIFR to take further action in respect of the
reference filed by BEL u/s 15(1) of SICA based on
its Audited Balance Sheet for FY ended 31.3.2001.”

The main plea advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner Punjab

W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 6 of 20

National Bank Shri Mohit Choudhary proceeds on the 2nd proviso of Section
15(1) where it had been stipulated that after the commencement of SARFAESI
Act, 2002, where the reference is pending before the BIFR, such reference shall
abate if the secured creditors lending not less than 3/4th in value of the amount
outstanding against the financial assistance disbursed to the borrower of such
secured creditors have taken any measures to recover their secured debt under
sub-section 4 of Section 13 of the Act. The petitioner has submitted a table of
dues which reads as follows:Bank

5.

It is not in dispute that the Punjab National Bank, the Oriental Bank of

Commerce and the State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, admittedly represented the
secured creditors of more than 3/4th of the value and had taken measures to
recover their secured debt under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act.

The

petitioner therefore, submitted that since action had been taken under Section
13(4) of the SARFAESI Act measures contemplated by Section 15 2 nd proviso
SICA had been adopted and the BIFR/AAIFR were divested of their jurisdiction
to carry on any further proceedings.
6.

In supporting the above construction of Section 13(4), the petitioner bank

has also relied upon the following judgment of the Madras High Court, delivered
in Writ Petition (C) No.32594/2003 and 4481 of 2005, dated 19th July 2005, titled
as Triveni Alloys Ltd. v. Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction
and Ors. The relevant portion of the said judgment reads as follows:
“6.
Learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that the intention of the Parliament is
that the second proviso to section 15 (1) applies
only when a reference is pending before the BIFR
and not before the Appellate Authority and hence
only BIFR is mentioned therein. As already stated
W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 8 of 20

above, appeal is a continuation of the original
proceedings and very often something which is not
mentioned can be implied by necessary
implication. Moreover, the very purpose of the
Securitization Act is for speedy recovery of dues
against defaulting borrowers and hence we should
take an interpretation which furthers that object.
7.
There is no dispute that more than three
fourth of the secured creditors resolved to take
action under the Securitization Act and gave their
consent for that purpose. In our opinion, once a
decision has been taken by the secured creditors
representing not less than three fourth in value of
the amount outstanding and consent has been
given, it will amount to a measure taken to recover
the secured debt under Section 13(4) of the
Securitization Act.”

In our view, while agreeing with the conclusion in the above judgment,
with respect we are not entirely in agreement with the judgment of the Madras
High Court. In our view, a mere decision in the meeting of the secured creditors
representing three fourth in value of the amount outstanding may not amount to a
measure taken to recover a secured debt under Section 13(4) of the Securitization
Act and something more concrete has to be done by the secured creditors. In any
event, the above judgment arose from the plea whether the second proviso to

W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 9 of 20

Section 15 (1) applies before the Appellate Authority and not only BIFR and this
provision has also been rightly construed by the Madras High Court to hold that
appeal is a continuation of the original proceedings. It is evident that the bar of
Section 15 second proviso applies to not only original proceedings but also to the
appeal emanating therefrom and the bar stipulated by the 2nd proviso to Section 15
SICA applies not only to the BIFR but also the AAIFR.
7.

The Division Bench of High Court of Bombay at Nagpur, in Writ

Petition(C) No.5140/2005, decided on 21st October 2005 ,in the matter of Ravi
Spinning Ltd. and Ors. v. Union of India & anr. Reported in 2006 (2) MHLJ
145, held as follows:
“The plain reading of the above referred proviso
makes it implicitly clear that after the
commencement of the Securitization Act, 2002
st
which came into force on 21 June 2002, reference
under Section 15 if was pending before the Board of
Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, the said
reference stands abated in view of the above referred
proviso.”

We agree with above conclusion of the Bombay High Court though we are

W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 10 of 20

giving reasons for arriving at the above conclusion as reasons in support thereof
were not discernible from the Bombay High Court's judgment.
8.

The counsel for the respondent no.2 mainly submitted that the repayment of

a substantial part of the loan to all creditors except the petitioner divested the
jurisdiction under the SARFASI Act and no useful purpose would be served by
resort to SARFASI Act. It is submitted that the sine qua non for the exercise of
jurisdiction, i.e., three fourth of the creditors in value of the outstandings of the
disbursed amount, were not available to pursue the proceedings.

Upon

conclusion of arguments on 30th April 2008 the following order was passed:
“Arguments heard.
Parties are directed to file their written notes of
arguments advanced in the Court not later than one
week from today. In the meanwhile, it is not
disputed that the amount of Rs.6.87 crores has been
paid by respondent no.2 to the petitioner no.1/bank
and a further sum of Rs.11 crores to the other three
banks who are the petitioners have also been paid.
The learned counsel for petitioner no.1 states that
according to him a further sum of Rs.83 lakhs as
per the OTS offer still remains to be paid. Parties
to seek instructions on this aspect and inform this
court along with the written notes within a weeks.
Orders reserved.”

Page No. 11 of 20

9.

The counsel for the respondent no.2 has apart from the pleas advanced in

court has added certain other pleas not urged in court in her written submissions
and has not answered the query raised in the above order. Accordingly, we are
only dealing with the pleas advanced during the course of hearing.
10.

The learned counsel for the respondent no.2 submitted that the action taken

on the petitioner under Section 13 (4) of the SARFAESI Act has become
infructuous in the light of Section 13 (8) of the SARFAESI Act which reads as
follows:
“If the dues of the secured creditors together with
all costs, charges and expenses incurred by him are
tendered to the secured creditors at any time before
the date fixed for sale or transfer, the secured assets
shall not be sold or transferred by the secured
creditors, and no further steps shall be taken by him
for transfer or sale of that secured asset.”

In our view, even if the above submission is accepted the divesting of the
jurisdiction of the BIFR and AAIFR cannot be based upon the above provision
which only stipulates the conditions precedent for the operation of the
SARFAESI Act. Such pleas can indeed be raised in the proceedings under the
W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 12 of 20

SARFAESI Act but are not the pleas which can arise and be raised in proceedings
under the SICA. The learned counsel for the respondent no.2 has also submitted
that the Appellate power under Section 25 gave all jurisdiction to the AAIFR to
make such enquiries as it deems fit which included the power to confirm, modify
or set aside the order appealed against and this certainly stipulated that the
subsequent events could be taken into account while deciding the appeal. We
have no doubt that the subsequent events indeed can be taken into account by the
appellate forum. However, that has nothing to do with the basic existence of the
jurisdiction in the BIFR and appellate forum of the AAIFR pursuant to the
mandate of second proviso to Section 14 (1) of the SICA. The reliance on the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Transcore v. Union of
India, 135 (2006) DLT 151 (SC) is of no avail to the petitioner because it only
deals with the jurisdiction of the SARFAESI Act as stipulated by Section 13 (8)
and cannot have any bearing on the interpretation of SICA. Reliance has also
been placed on the judgment of the Orissa High Court in the case of Noble Aqua
Pvt. Ltd. & ors. v. State Bank of India & ors., WP(C) 4815/2007, decided on 21st
W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 13 of 20

February 2008. The above judgment has dealt with the impact of Section 22 of
the of the SICA vis-a-vis Section 13 (b) of the Securitisation Act. This plea has
been dealt with by the Orissa High Court in the following terms:
“19. In support of such contention learned
counsel relied on amendment to Securitization Act
under Section 41 thereof to certain enactments, and
one of such enactment is SICA. Such amendments
have been given in the Schedule to Section 41 of
SICA. From a perusal of the said Schedule it
appears that to Section 15 of SICA the following
amendments have been introduced in Section 41 of
the Securitization Act. The said amendment is as
follows:
In Section 15, in sub Section (1), after the proviso,
insert the following:
“Provided further that no reference shall
be made to the Board for Industrial and
Financial Reconstruction after the
commencement of the Securitization and
reconstruction of Financial Assets and
Enforcement of Security Interest Act,
2002 where financial assets have been
acquired by any securitization company
or reconstruction company under subsection (1) of Section 5 of that Act.
Provided also that on or after the
commencement of the Securitization and
reconstruction of financial Assets and
Enforcement of Security Interest Act,
2002 where a reference is pending

W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 14 of 20

before the Board for Industrial and
Financial Reconstruction such reference
shall abate if the secured creditors,
representing not less than three fourths
in value of the amount outstanding
against financial assistance disbursed to
the borrower of such secured creditors,
have taken any measures to recover their
secured debt under sub-section (4) of
Section 13 of that Act.”
Relying on the proviso to the said amendment,
learned counsel submitted that in the instant case
since the notice under Section 13 (4) of the
Securitiziation Act has been issued reference before
BIFR has abated.
20.
This court is unable to appreciate the
aforesaid contention. The proviso makes it very
clear that same will come into force where a
reference is pending before the BIFR. Such
reference will abate if the secured creditors
representing not less than three fourths in value of
the amount outstanding against financial assistance
disbursed to the borrower, have taken any measures
to recover their secured debt under sub-section (4)
of Section 13 of the Securitization Act.
21.
In the instant case, admittedly the notice
under subsection (4) of Section 13 of the
Securitization Act has been issued on 7.4.2000. But
long before that, the company has been declared a
sick industrial company by an order of the BIFR
dated 14.11.2006. Therefore, the proceeding under
the SICA was not at the stage of reference. The
proceeding has gone far ahead of that and

W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 15 of 20

culminated in an order by which the company was
declared sick on 14.11.2006. The said order was
passed by the BIFR after hearing the bank and by
the said order the bank was appointed an operating
agency with a direction to prepare the revival
scheme. Therefore, in the facts of this case, the
reference cannot abate since the matter under SICA
is not pending in reference before the BIFR. Even
though the bank is a party to the said order, it has
neither filed any appeal there from nor has it asked
for consent under Section 22 to proceed against the
petitioner company.
Therefore, this argument
raised by the learned counsel for the Bank cannot be
accepted.”

Relying on the above judgment it has been submitted that by issuance of
the notice under Section 13 (4) of the Securitization Act proceedings before the
BIFR could not abate when a scheme was formulated. In our view, the judgment
has proceeded on the basis of the distinction drawn between the pendency of
reference and the existence of the scheme. In our view, the 2nd proviso stipulates
the pendency of the reference and the reference would include even the
preparation of the revival scheme pursuant to the reference, i.e., taking of any
action by the BIFR including preparation of a scheme pursuant to the reference.
Furthermore, in order to avail of the principles of law laid down in the above

W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 16 of 20

judgment it will have to be demonstrated that a scheme had been framed in the
present case. No such framing of scheme was brought to our notice by the
respondent no.2.

However, even if a scheme had been framed in our view that

would make no difference to the import of the 2nd proviso to Section 15 of SICA.
To this extent we are respectfully unable to concur with the view taken by th
Orissa High Court.
10(a)

We are also of the view that once the jurisdiction of the BIFR was

divested by the mandatory impact of the 2nd proviso to Section 15(1), the BIFR
could not pass any orders under the SICA notwithstanding the subsequent
developments. Orders sought by the petitioner from the BIFR could have been
passed either under the SARFEASI or by a writ court exercising jurisdiction
under Article 226 of the Constitution.
10(b)

The phrase have taken measures obviously contemplates a measure

already adopted and cannot be construed to mean that the jurisdiction of the BIFR
would depend upon subsequent alteration in the composition of the consortium of
the creditors once such measures are taken. The submission of the petitioner that
W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 17 of 20

subsequent events such as the reduction in the percentage of creditors, could
enable continuance of the proceedings in the BIFR would mean that there would
be a constant reshuffling of jurisdictions between the SARFAESI Act and SICA
depending entirely upon the varying percentage of debtors based upon subsequent
satisfaction of such debts by the debtor. Such a meaning could never have been
intended by the legislature and the jurisdiction of the BIFR/AAIFR once divested
by the operation of the 2nd proviso to Section 15(1) could not resuscitate by virtue
of subsequent developments.

We, therefore, agree with the conclusion of the

Bombay High Court but for the reasons enumerated above.
11.

Ms. Maneesha Dhir also pleaded for a harmonious construction so as to

harmoniously permit the operation of the two statutes in the present instance the
deeming provision to Section 15(1) 2nd proviso was inserted to the SICA itself in
2002 after the SARFAESI Act was enacted. Since the deeming proviso divesting
the jurisdiction of the BIFR being incorporated in the SICA itself, the plea of
harmonious construction between SICA and SARFEASI Act does not arise.
12.

It is also not in dispute that the petitioner bank has fairly admitted that it

W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 18 of 20

has received the amount of Rs.687.50 lakhs but after a delay of 65 days which is
in contravention of stipulation of the OTS scheme. Consequently, as per the
petitioner for the delayed payment the respondent No. 2 is liable to pay a sum of
Rs.83,06,715/- being interest under the OTS Scheme relied upon by the
petitioner. The order of this Court dated 30th April 2008 specifically directed the
respondent to take instructions on the payment of this balance amount . The
written submissions instead of a written note of arguments, advanced by the
respondent does not mention anything on this aspect. We are, accordingly, of the
view that while dismissing the writ petition on the basis of interpretation of
second proviso to Section 15(1) of the SICA, we nevertheless in the interest of
justice hold that if balance amount of Rs.83,06,715/- is paid by the respondent not
later than 30th June 2008, the proceedings before both BIFR and AAIFR shall
stand abated. We are passing this order in public interest by involving our power
in our writ jurisdiction to ensure that a company which is on the way of revival is
given adequate opportunity to revive itself. However, this does not in any manner
affect the ousted jurisdiction of the BIFR and AAIFR in view of the impact of 2nd
W.P.(C) No.12097-100/06

Page No. 19 of 20

proviso to Section 15(1) of the SICA.
13.

We have also noted the plea that the appeal being time barred was

specifically taken before the Appellate Authority by the petitioner and prima facie
appears to be correct. The Appellate Authority has chosen not to address this
issue at all and judgment of the AAIFR cannot be sustained on this ground also.
The writ petition is accordingly allowed and the order of AAIFR dated 20th April,
2006 in Appeal No. 70/2005 is quashed and set aside.
