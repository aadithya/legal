1.

The Food Inspector had lifted samples of black

pepper from various premises. One sample was lifted from
the

page 1 of 4

premises of Ram Kishan and the other from the premises of
Amarjeet Singh, the 2 accused in the captioned appeals.
Thereafter, 2 separate complaints were filed.
2.

In addition to the 2 complaints which are subject

matter of the 2 captioned appeals other complaints were also
filed. All complaints resulted in orders of acquittal.
3.

The

apparent

reason

for

acquittal

was

the

discrepancy in the report of the Public Health Analyst and the
Director, Central Food Laboratory in each case.
4.

Primacy was given by the Court to the report of the

Director, Central Food Laboratory.
5.

Order of acquittal in one of the case was subject

matter of Crl.Appeal No.135/1989. The appeal was dismissed
on 2.4.2007.

The decision is reported as 2007 (2) JCC 1154

State vs. Dwarka Dass.
6.

In paras 4 to 6 of the decision in Dwarka Dass's case

(supra) it was observed as under:“4. The report of Public Analyst stands
superseded by the report of Director, CFL.
Prosecution cannot fall upon the report of Public
Analyst to fill up lacunae or ambiguity in the
report of CFL. Since on the basis of report of CFL,
which is silent about the mineral oil being food
grade or non food grade, the accused has been
given benefit of doubt, it would not be
appropriate for this Court to take other view.

5. In Sachchey Lal Tiwari v. State of Uttar
Pradesh MANU/SC/0865/2004, Supreme Court
observed that when an appeal is filed against an
order of acquittal, the appellant Court should
keep in mind:
(i).Generally, the order of acquittal shall not
be interfered with because the presumption
of innocence of the accused is further
strengthened by acquittal.
(ii). If two views are possible on the
evidence adduced in the case, one pointing
to the guilt of the accused and the other to
his innocence, the view which is favourable
to the accused should be adopted.
(iii). A miscarriage of justice which may
arise from acquittal of the guilty is no less
than from the conviction of an innocent.
(iv). Where admissible evidence is ignored,
a duty is cast upon the appellate Court to
re-appreciate the evidence where the
accused has been acquitted, for the
purpose of ascertaining as to whether any
of the accused really committed any
offence or not.
(v). Court considering the appeal against
the judgment of acquittal is to interfere
only when there are compelling and
substantial reasons for doing so.
6. In the above case, views taken by the trial
Court was based on the report of the Director,
CFL. It is not a case where trial Court acted
contrary to the law. There was no miscarriage of
justice. It is settled law that Appellate Court
should not reverse the decision of the trial Court
merely because a different view is possible. I find
no reason to interfere with the order passed by
the trial Court. Appeal is hereby dismissed.”

7.

Following the decision in Dwarka Dass's case (supra)

I dismiss the appeals.
8.

LCR be returned.
