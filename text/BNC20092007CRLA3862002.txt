Section 302 IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act in

FIR

No.23/1997 under Sections 394/398/302/212/120B/34 IPC PS Lahori Gate, Delhi and sentencing him
by order dated 29th January, 2002 to imprisonment
for life and a fine of Rs.5000/- under Section 302 IPC,
in default of payment of fine further RI for one year
and RI for three years under Section 27 of Arms Act.
The sentences on both the counts were directed to
run concurrently.
2.

The facts of the case, as unfolded

by Ketan

Kumar, an alleged eye witness, in his statement
forming basis of FIR, are that when on 28th January,
1997 at about 1.45 pm Ketan Kumar, Jaswant Singh,
Narottam (deceased) and Manu Bhai were present in
their office located in premises No.301 Kucha Ghasi
Ram, Chandni Chowk, Delhi, two persons aged about
25-30 years came in there to inquire about the
location of House No.3 and 4.

instance his co-accused were also arrested. One of
his co-accused namely Mustkeem however, could not
be arrested and he was declared as a proclaimed
offender.
3.

The appellant was charged under Sections
302/396/398 IPC as also under Section 27 of Arms
Act while his co- accused Aas Mohammed was
charged under Sections 396/398 IPC.

Other co-

accused namely Rakesh Kumar and Jagdish Prasad
were charged under Section 396 IPC and another coaccused Subhash under Section 120 B read with
Section 395 IPC. The appellant as well as his said coCrl. Appeal No.386/2002

and were thus tried for the same.

The trial resulted in acquittal of all the four coaccused of the appellant as the learned Trial Court
held that the charges of dacoity or attempt to commit
the same were not proved.

Even the appellant was

held not guilty of charges under Section 396 or 398
IPC.

appellant contended that

Page 5 of 20

Besides, the learned counsel argued that according
to the postmortem report the type of fire arm used
was a Rifled one and as the prosecution has failed to
establish that the country made pistol allegedly
recovered from the appellant has a spiralling grooved
barrel, the same could not be held to be the weapon
of offence.

The learned counsel further contended

that according to the prosecution case the appellant
had fired only

one shot that killed Narottam and

another shot was fired

in the air by one of his co-

accused in the process of their escape from the spot
but recovery of two empty cartridge cases, one from
the spot and the other from the barrel of the country
made pistol allegedly recovered from the appellant
totally demolishes the prosecution version in this
regard.

7.

Out of a total of 25 witnesses examined by the
prosecution to prove respective charges against the
appellant, the testimonies of Jaswant Singh (PW-5),
Ketan Kumar (PW-6) and Manu Bhai (PW-7) are preeminent as they are the persons who claim to have
had witnessed

the

occurrence

taking place.

Further, Ketan Kumar (PW-6) and Manu Bhai (PW-7)
Crl. Appeal No.386/2002

Page 7 of 20

are the ones who are stated to have had apprehended
the appellant after a hot pursuit

and facilitated

recovery of the weapon of offence from him.
8.

The learned Trial Court based its finding of
conviction against the appellant primarily on the
statements of Jaswant Singh (PW-5), Ketan Bhai (PW6) and Manu Bhai (PW-7) as also on recovery of the
country

made

pistol

(Ex.P1)

from

him

on

his

apprehension by Ketan Bhai (PW-6) and Manu Bhai
(PW-7) after a chase. On scanning the statements of
the said three witnesses, who are claimed to have had
witnessed Narottam deceased being shot at by the
appellant, it is noticed that their statements are not
free from inconsistencies which tend

to create

reasonable doubt if they had really seen the incident
taking place. Jaswant Singh, (PW-5) though stated in
his examination-in-chief that it was the person who
was apprehended by Ketan Bhai (PW-6) and Manu
Crl. Appeal No.386/2002

Page 8 of 20

Bhai (PW-7) who had shot dead Narottam but in his
cross-examination he affirmed that he had not seen
the appellant actually firing at Narottam and that he
had heard the gun shot only. He further stated that
he could not

say

if the gun shot was fired by the

appellant or some other person. Manu Bhai (PW-7)
testified that at the relevant time when the appellant
and his co-accused

had come inside the office, he

alongwith Ketan Bhai (PW-6) and Narottam deceased
was present in the inner room of his office.

In the

outer room only Jaswant Singh (PW-5) was present.
At one place in his cross-examination he affirmed that
when the shot was fired he was near the door of outer
room and Jaswant Singh (PW-5) as also Ketan Bhai
(PW-6) were outside the office at a distance of 4/5
feet from the door of outer room. The site plan (Ex.
PW 22/A) indicates the position of outer and inner
rooms of the office,
Crl. Appeal No.386/2002

the covered varanda adjoining
Page 9 of 20

the outer room and

open varanda where Narottam

deceased was shot dead at Point 'B'. The position of
the said three witnesses as also of Narottam deceased
at the time when the appellant and his co-accused
had allegedly come in is shown at point 'A' which is
inside the outer room. According to Manu Bhai (PW7), thus, it would appear that at the relevant time
when the shot

was fired at Narottam deceased,

Jaswant Singh (PW-5) and Ketan Bhai (PW-6) were
present in the covered varanda adjoining outer room.
Had Jaswant Singh (PW-5) been present in the
adjoining covered varanda alongwith Ketan Bhai (PW6), he would have clearly been in a position to see if
the gun shot at Point 'B' in Ex. PW 22/A was fired at
Narottam by the appellant or someone else. Jaswant
Singh (PW-5) has however, as pointed out earlier,
conceded

in his cross examination that he had not

seen the gun shot being actually fired at Narottam
Crl. Appeal No.386/2002

Page 10 of 20

rather he simply heard the gun shot and was thus
not sure if it was the appellant or someone else who
had fired at Narottam. Manu Bhai (PW-7) at another
place

in

his

cross-examination

made

a

self

contradictory statement where he stated that when
he came out from inner room to outer room the shot
had already been fired. He further stated that Ketan
Bhai (PW-6) was ahead of him when he had come out
of inner room to the outer room. Ketan Bhai (PW-6)
in his statement admitted that from his seat in the
inner room the main gate of the office was not visible.
According to him when the gun shot was fired,
Jaswant Singh (PW-5) was in the office and Manu
Bhai (PW-7) was ahead of him (Ketan Bhai).
further

stated that

He

at the relevant time Narottam

deceased was at a distance of only 5/6 feet from him
which if accepted would mean that Manu Bhai (PW7) was quite close to Point 'B' (Ex. PW 22/A) when
Crl. Appeal No.386/2002

Page 11 of 20

Narottam was fired at.

Manu Bhai (PW-7) however

does not support the statement of Ketan Bhai (PW-6)
in this regard as according to him it were
Singh (PW-5)

Jaswant

and Ketan Bhai (PW-6) who had

actually been present in the covered varanda. The
site plan (Ex. PW 22/A) shows the position of all the
said three witnesses as also of Narottam deceased
inside the outer room of the office at Point 'A' at the
time when the appellant and his co-accused are said
to have had entered the office. The site plan does not
indicate

the position of respective witnesses at the

time Narottam was shot dead at Point 'B' in Ex. PW
22/A. In view of mutually contradictory statements
of the said eye witnesses, as noticed hereinabove, a
lurking doubt is caused in regard to the correctness
of ocular account of the incident and consequently
one cannot be sure if the fatal shot was fired at by
the appellant alone and none else.

Apart from the statements

of said three

witnesses, apprehension of the appellant and recovery
of the country made pistol (Ex. P1) besides two empty
cartridge cases, a live cartridge and a lead core were
also

relied upon to connect the appellant with the

commission of crime in question. Even though a large
number of people were available

at the spot,

no

person from public was however joined by the police
as a witness of his apprehension by Ketan Bhai (PW6) and Manu Bhai (PW-7) and recovery of country
made pistol (Ex. P1) from him. As far as recovery of
country made pistol (Ex. P1) from
concerned,

the appellant is

again the statements of said

three eye

witnesses are at variance with each other. Jaswant
Singh (PW-5) affirmed that the appellant had thrown
away the country made pistol (Ex. P1) in the
courtyard of his office building while trying to escape
from the spot. Ketan Bhai (PW-6) on the other hand
Crl. Appeal No.386/2002

Page 13 of 20

told that the appellant was still holding the country
made pistol (Ex. P1) in his hand when he was
apprehended by him and Manu Bhai (PW-7). Manu
Bhai (PW-7) on the other hand

testified that the

country made pistol (Ex. P1) was recovered by
police

from

the

chowk

alongwith

a

the

cartridge.

Inspector Surinder Kumar, PW 8, who seized

the

country made pistol (Ex. P1) vide memo Ex. PW5/A
stated that the same was at the relevant time being
held by the appellant in his hand. If the recovery of
country made pistol (Ex. P1) had really been effected
from the appellant in the manner alleged by the
prosecution there was no reason

for the three eye

witnesses to have made contradictory statements in
regard to the place of such recovery.
10.

Prosecution claim of recovering the

country

made pistol (Ex. P1) from the appellant immediately
after the occurrence
Crl. Appeal No.386/2002

is difficult to

accept not only

contradictory statements of witnesses of

a

circumstance as emanating from the CFSL report.
According to the account of incident as testified by the
three eye witnesses, the appellant had fired only one
shot

thereafter

unsuccessfully tried to run away from the spot.
Recovery from the scene of crime of an empty

witnesses. None of the eye witnesses states that after
firing at Narottam, the appellant had fired from the
country made pistol (Ex. P1) for the second time
while running away from the spot before being
apprehended.

From the statement (Ex. PW 6/A) of

Ketan Kumar, which formed basis of the FIR, it were
co-accused of the appellant and not the appellant who
had resorted to firing in the air while trying to escape
from the spot. Thus, if the appellant had fired from
the pistol (Ex. P1) only once, no explanation is
forthcoming in regard to recovery of two empty
cartridges including fired metallic jacket of a bullet
which was found stuck into the barrel of the pistol
(Ex. P1) at the time of its recovery from him.
11.

Yet another circumstance running counter to

the prosecution version is that the evidence on record
falls far short of proving that the fatal shot had been
fired by the appellant from the pistol (Ex. P1).

Supreme Court decision in Ishwar Singh Vs. The
State of Uttar Pradesh; AIR 1976 SC 2428 wherein it
was held :“In Kartarey Vs. State of U.P. AIR 1976

“It is the duty of the prosecution
and no less of the court, to see that
the alleged weapon of the offence, if
available, is shown to the medical
witness and his opinion invited as to
whether all or any of the injuries on
the victim could be caused with that
weapon. Failure to do so may
sometimes cause aberration in the
course of justice.”
In this case it is impossible to say with
certainty whether the injury was caused by
the ballam or the bhala that were seized,
and, therefore, whether it was Ishwar Singh
or Harpal who was responsible for it, even if
one believed that on the day of the
occurrence the former carried a ballam and
the latter a bhala. Ishwar Singh's conviction

under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code
cannot
also
be
sustained
in these
circumstances.”
In the absence of any evidence that the

country made pistol (Ex.P1) is a rifled one and that
the gun shot injuries (Ex. PW 2/A) on the dead body
of Narottam could have possibly been caused by that
weapon, the learned Trial Court was not justified in
brushing aside the argument by learned defence
counsel

that

the gun shot injury could not have

been caused from country made pistol (Ex.P1) simply
on the ground that as per CFSL report the country
made pistol (Ex. P1) could chamber a 8 MM cartridge.
A reasonable doubt is thus cast in regard to
correctness of accusation against the appellant of
having shot dead Narottam with country made pistol
(Ex. P 1).
13.

In the face of infirmities and inconsistencies as

noticed above, the finding of conviction against the
appellant as recorded by the learned Trial Court cannot be
Crl. Appeal No.386/2002

Page 19 of 20

held to be well founded and on the strength of its evidence on
record, the prosecution cannot claim to have succeeded in
bringing home the guilt to the appellant beyond reasonable
doubt. Consequently, the impugned conviction and sentence
are liable to be set aside.
14.

The appeal is, in the result, allowed and the judgment

dated 24th January, 2002 of conviction

of appellant under

Section 302 IPC and Section 27 of Arms Act as also the order
dated 29th January, 2002 sentencing him for the said offences
are set aside and the appellant is acquitted

of the charges

according benefit of doubt. He being in jail custody is directed
to be set at liberty forthwith if not required to be detained in
connection with any other case.
