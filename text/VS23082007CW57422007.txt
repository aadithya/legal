1.
The petitioner was engaged on casual basis by the
respondent herein in the year 1987.

When the petitioner was

working in this capacity, criminal proceedings under Section 420,
468, 471 and 511 were instituted against him sometime in the
year 1993. Since he was working on casual basis, in view of the

aforesaid criminal proceedings he was disengaged on 17.3.1993.
Challenging this order, petitioner preferred the OA No. 692/1993,
which was, however, dismissed by the Tribunal on the ground
that there was no legal requirement to serve a legal notice of
termination to the casual worker before his services are
dispensed with.
2.

In the criminal proceedings, petitioner was acquitted

by the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate vide order dated
1.4.2005. Armed with this order, the petitioner approached the
authorities requesting for reinstatement. As his request was not
acceded to, he approached the Tribunal again.

Tribunal has

however dismissed his application vide orders dated 10th May,
2006, following the dicta of the Constitution Bench judgment of
the Supreme Court laid down in State of Karnataka and Ors.
vs. Uma Devi and Ors. 2006 (4) scale 197 wherein, the
Supreme Court has now authoritatively pronounced that any
appointment on casual basis de hors the Rules is illegal which
itself is a violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution and
no regularization could be conferred on such employees.
3.

Challenging this order, the petitioner has filed the

present petition. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
other employees who were working on casual basis at that time

were ordered to be regularized and it is only because of the
aforesaid criminal proceedings, the petitioner was disengaged.
He further submitted that before prosecuting the petitioner,
sanction of the competent authority was obtained and order
dated 22.12.1994 is produced in this Court. On this basis, plea
of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that petitioner was
treated as regular employee and therefore he has right to be
reinstated in service once he is acquitted in the criminal case
which is the basis of his disengagement.
4.

This submission of the petitioner is without any merit.

As pointed out above after the disengagement of the petitioner
he had earlier preferred an application under Section 19 of the
Administrative Tribunal Act in the year, 1993 wherein it was
contended

that

services

of

the

petitioner

terminated without serving proper notice.

could

not

be

This contention was

rejected firstly on the ground that since the petitioner is a casual
worker no such notice is required to be served. Thus, in the year
1993 when the engagement of the petitioner was dispensed with
he was treated as a casual employee and on this premise only,
the Tribunal has dismissed his petition. The petitioner has now,
at this stage taken the plea that he had become regular
employee. This is contrary to the basis of the earlier judgment
WP(C) No.5742/2007

of the Tribunal which the petitioner had accepted, and which has
become final.
5.

Admittedly, the petitioner had not undergone any

selection process before his engagement which was of casual
nature only. If, because of certain orders passed by the Tribunal
the colleagues of the petitioner were regularized, those orders
cannot enure to the benefit of the petitioner, as he had been
disengaged. As we deal with the matter today, we are governed
by the law laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Uma
Devi (supra). We do not, therefore, have any reason to interfere
with the judgment of the Tribunal. Dismissed.
