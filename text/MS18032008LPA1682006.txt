Mehta v. Union of India for shifting of industries from nonconforming

areas,

in

1996,

the

Department

of

Industries,

Government of NCT of Delhi, the appellant herein, invited
applications from industrial units situated in non-conforming areas
for allotment of industrial plots for relocating their industrial units,
in terms of a scheme formulated by it. On 26th December, 1996
vide application No.195 the respondent applied for a plot
measuring 400 sq.mtrs. under the said Scheme and deposited
10% of the total cost of the 400 sq.mtrs plot @ Rs.3,000/- per sq.
mtr.

Vide letter No.DSIDC/RL CELL/i/98 dated 3rd April, 1998

DSIDC communicated to the respondent that he has been found
provisionally eligible for allotment of an industrial plot measuring
250 sq.mtrs under the re-location scheme and was asked to pay
30% of the cost of the plot within sixty days from the date of
issue/receipt of the said letter.

Relevant clauses of the said letter

read as under:
“(2) Based on preliminary scrutiny, your unit has
been found to be provisionally eligible for
allotment of an alternative industrial plot
measuring 250 sq.mtrs.”
(4) This is provisional eligibility letter will not
confer upon any right or claim seniority for
allotment of industrial plot. Actual allotment will
(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 9 of 37

be in accordance with the policies/guidelines
framed by the Government governing priority of
relocation depending upon availability of
developed land, nature of industry to be
relocated etc.”
Accordingly the respondent deposited Rs.94,500/-.
5.Thereafter,

vide

letter

No.DSIDC/RLF/195/PLOT

dated

10th

October, 2000 DSIDC declared the respondent allottee of industrial
plot No.281, measuring 250 sq.mtrs, in Sector-I, Pocket-N in
Bawana Industrial Area and directed the respondent to deposit
50% of the total revised estimate cost of the plot which was
revised to Rs.4,200/- per sq.mtr.. The same was deposited by the
respondent.

Vide letter dated 25th September, 2001 DSIDC

directed the respondent to deposit the balance 50% of the cost of
the plot and to collect possession letter after completing requisite
legal formalities.

Subsequently, on 19th December, 2001 DSIDC

informed the respondent that the aforesaid plot measuring 250
sq.mtrs was ready for possession. Thereafter, when DSIDC did not
hand over the possession, the respondent approached this Court
by filing a writ petition.
6.In reply, DSIDC stated that the possession of the plot could not
be handed over to the respondent herein as on scrutiny of

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 10 of 37

respondent’s file and application it was found that the area
occupied by the unit of the respondent was 100 sq.yards only
while he had applied for 400 sq.mtrs under the re-location
scheme. It was stated that the Government of Delhi on the basis
of the Cabinet decision/policy directed the DSIDC to review the
cases on the basis of the criterion that the size of the plots
recommended should not exceed double the area presently
occupied by the unit, (rounded to the nearest size of the plot being
offered and subject to minimum of 100 sq.mtrs), therefore the
respondent was not eligible for 250 sq.mtrs plot but only for a plot
measuring 150 sq.mtrs.

It was also stated that before DSIDC

could intimate the respondent that his present allotment has been
cancelled in terms of the Cabinet decision and he is only entitled
to a plot measuring 150 Sq.mtrs., he approached the High Court
by filing the writ petition.

The stand of the DSIDC before the

learned Single Judge was that the Government of NCT of

Delhi

had altered the policy at their end and the respondents herein
could not have objected to the revised terms of allotment and as
sufficient land was not available to allot to all the applicants
downsizing of the plots has taken place.

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

It was also contended

Page 11 of 37

that since the relocation scheme was a policy, it did not attain
immutability or irrevocability and a policy of this genre could
always be modified if public interest so dictated.
7.The main argument of the respondents herein was that

the

allotment of plots having been made on receipt of full payment in
respect of the said plots by DSIDC, a concluded contract had come
into existence which would remain impervious to any so-called
change in policy.

The learned Single Judge after hearing

arguments, allowed the writ petitions filed by the respondents
herein.

It was held by the learned Single Judge that the

distinguishing feature of the present cases is the coming into
effect of a concluded contract and that the DSIDC had recorded in
their letters that firm allotment of plots had taken place.

The

learned Single Judge agreed with the argument of the respondents
herein that the only tentative characteristic of the transaction was
the price and not allotment of the plot or its dimensions, and held
that no inchoate or tentative aspect of the contract existed at the
time when DSIDC attempted to cancel the respective allotments.
The learned Single Judge directed the DSIDC to hand over
possession of the plots allotted earlier to the respondents herein

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 12 of 37

within fifteen days from the date of the judgment.
8.Aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellants filed the present
appeals, on which we have heard the learned counsel appearing
for the parties.
9.The learned counsel appearing for the DSIDC contended before
us that the learned Single Judge erred in holding that a concluded
contract has come into being subsequent to the dispatch of letters
of allotment.

It was contended that in the present case the

question of concluded contract would not arise as the scheme
under which the petitioners were held entitled to allotment was a
beneficial scheme and no allottee could take benefit of a wrong
committed by getting more than his entitlement. It is also
submitted that the scheme under which the allottees were given
allotment letters could not have been lost sight of and in case
where the State largesse is being granted no one could avail
benefit of more than what was his entitlement and therefore it was
not a case of pure and simple contract between the government
and the allottee but a case where, under a beneficial scheme, the
parties were being granted plots of land for purpose of their
relocation.

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 13 of 37

10.It was the contention of the learned counsel appearing for the
respondents that as the offer of allotment was accepted by the
respondents and full payment in terms thereof was made, the
contract was concluded and neither the Government of NCT of
Delhi nor the DSIDC could refuse to perform their part of the
contract and wriggle out of the same. It was further contended
that though they are not denying that a policy can be changed in
exercise of administrative/executive power but it cannot have
retrospective effect to adversely affect the vested right of a party
under a concluded contract.
11.We have perused the issues and contention raised by both the
parties and now we proceed to consider them accordingly.
12.After issuance of the advertisement inviting application for
allotment of industrial plots under relocation scheme, in March
1998 implementation of the relocation scheme was entrusted to
the DSIDC. The Commissioner of Industries, Government of NCT of
Delhi, sent a list of 8831 industrial units and advised DSIDC to
issue provisional eligibility letters. Accordingly, the DSIDC issued
provisional allotment letter in March/April 1998 whereby the
provisional allotment was made on the basis of norms of eligibility.

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 14 of 37

One of such norms relevant for adjudication of the present case is
reproduced below for reference:
“ (10) As regards the entitlement of land of
individual eligible units the following decision has
been taken by the Cabinet.
(a) no cuts in respect of units requiring upto 100
sq.mtrs of land.
(b) 25% cut in the case of plot size measuring
from 101 to 200 sq.mtrs subject to minimum size
of plot being retained at 100 sq.mtrs.
(c ) 30% cut with regard to plots measuring from
201 to 300 sq.mtrs. and
(d) 30% cut with regard to plots measuring from
301 to 400 sq.mtrs.”
13.In the Note for Council of Ministers date 4/7th June, 1998 it was,

inter alia, stated that after preliminary scrutiny, final scrutiny of
applications has been done at the level of Joint Directors of
industries/Dy.Directors of Industries. At Clause 5(vii) it was
mentioned that possession of only 1080 acres of land out of the
original 1300 acres of land identified for acquisition has been
taken as the remaining land is under heavy built-up structures.
Additional land is required to be identified within the notified urban
extension, availability of which is very limited. It is further stated
that keeping in view the limited availability of land within the
(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 15 of 37

notified urban extension, it is felt that applicants requiring plots
measuring more than 400 sq.mtrs should either be asked to shift
out from Delhi to the National Capital Region and the earnest
money deposited by them be returned along with promised
interest @7% or else they should undertake in writing to accept a
plot of size measuring 250 sq.mtrs and effect necessary change in
industrial activity. Further, under the paragraph ‘clarifications on
various points which came up during scrutiny of applications were
sought from the ‘land and flat allotment committee” at clause (c )
it is stated as under:
“During scrutiny, it has been observed that some
of the applicants are at present functioning from
much less area as compared to the area applied. It
was decided that the size of the plot recommended
in such cases should not exceed more than double
(rounded to the nearest lower size of plot being
offered and subject to minimum of 100 sq.mtrs)
the area presently being used for industrial
purposes. However, no such restriction shall be
imposed in respect of applicants who have applied
for industrial flats. Since no such condition had
been imposed by the Cabinet while deciding the
eligibility criteria, it was decided that this decision
may be got ratified by the Cabinet.”
14.Subsequently, Commissioner of Industries issued a public notice

dated 14th July, 1999 wherein it was stated that in response to the
advertisement 51,851 applications were received and all the said
(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 16 of 37

applications have been scrutinized to determine the eligibility of
individual applicants on the basis of guidelines approved by
Government of Delhi. It was also stated in the said public notice
that the basic criteria in determining eligibility was documentary
proof of establishment of the unit before 19th April, 1996, which
was the date of the order of the Supreme Court. It was also stated
that

where

documentary

proof

proprietors of units were called

was

not

available

on

file,

for personal hearing by the

Scrutiny Officers. In the said public notice it was inter alia stated
that the units which have applied for industrial plots measuring
more than 400 sq.mtrs will be offered a plot measuring maximum
of 250 sq.mtrs. Condition or term that size of the plot shall not
exceed more than double of the existing area presently being
used was not mentioned.
15.By letter dated 20th July, 1999 the Department of Industries,

Government of NCT of Delhi, addressed to the Managing Director,
DSIDC, referring to the Cabinet Meeting held on 7th June, 1999 and
3rd

meeting

of

the

High

Powered

Project

Implementation

Committee in respect of relocation scheme, it was further
informed that the size of the plot recommended should not

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 17 of 37

exceed double the area presently occupied by the unit. The said
clause is as under:
“(v) The size of the plots recommended should
not exceed double the area presently occupied
by the unit. However, no such distinction is
imposed in case of flats”.
16.In the additional affidavit filed on behalf of the DSIDC in the writ

petition, it was stated that in terms of the directions of the
Supreme Court dated 12th September, 2000, draw of lot was held
on 3rd October, 2000. It was also stated that out of 18355 allottees
who had been allotted plots in pursuance of the the said draw and
subsequent draw of lots, it was found that in 521 cases the area
allotted was more than the actual entitlement as per the decision
taken by the Cabinet.

Accordingly, the said allottees were issued

letters of cancellation of the plots and names and applications of
387 units who had paid 100% cost of the plots were put in the
fresh draw of lots held on 6th June, 2003. After downsizing the
area of plot, the excess payment had been refunded to most of
the allottees. It was also stated that downsizing of the plots was
done so as to implement the policy on a uniform basis and there is
nothing arbitrary or illegal in the same.
17.In the rejoinder to the reply filed by the DSIDC in the writ
(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 18 of 37

petition, the petitioners alleged that they have been discriminated
vis-a-vis those persons to whom possession of the plots were given
prior to taking of the impugned action inasmuch as their
allotments were not cancelled. The argument was that though the
petitioners had also deposited the entire cost of the plots, but
since plots were not handed over to them, their allotments were
cancelled for effecting the downsizing. It was also contended that
nothing prevented the DSIDC from informing the petitioners in the
year 1998/1999 itself that a decision was taken not to allot plot
size of more than double of the area presently occupied by a unit.
The DSIDC kept collecting the money from the respondents till
December, 2002.
18.One of the points which was also raised by the respondent was

that though on 10th October, 2000 he was informed that he has
been allotted a plot bearing No.281, Sector-I, Pocket-N Bawana
Industrial Complex which was three side open corner plot but
subsequently he was informed that his plot is in Pocket-O instead
of Pocket-N, the former being only a two side open plot. As the
said issue was not pressed before the learned Single Judge and
also before us, we are not commenting on the merits of the same.

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 19 of 37

19.The initial allotment letter dated 3rd April, 1998 did not confer

any vested right on the respondent to claim allotment of a plot
measuring 250 sq.mtrs as it specifically stated that the respondent
was only

provisionally eligible for the said allotment, but by

subsequent final allotment by letter dated 10th October, 2000,
specifically stating the size and number of the plot, the provisional
status came to an end.
20.The respondents have contended that after issuance of final

allotment letter and on receipt of full payment thereof a concluded
contract came into existence which would remain impervious to
any so called change in the policy as a policy cannot be given
retrospective effect.

From the aforesaid it is clear that before the

issue of final allotment letter dated 10th December, 2000 the
allotment of the plot was only provisional and no right to claim the
plot measuring 250 sq.mtrs accrued to the respondents. The
Cabinet decision/policy on which the appellant is placing reliance
was in the knowledge of the appellant much before the final
allotment was made as the same was communicated to DSIDC on
20th July, 1999. Thus the question of retrospective effect of the
Cabinet decision/policy does not arise in the present case as the

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 20 of 37

final allotment was made much after the Cabinet decision/policy
came into effect.
21.Coming to the contentions raised by the appellant-DSIDC, we

find that they have alleged that the downsizing has been done
keeping in mind the fact that there is scarcity of land and the said
action, therefore, is in public interest. It is worth mentioning that
all the the said allotments were made specifically mentioning the
area and property number allotted to the applicant. The said
contention raised by the appellant-DSIDC will not hold good in the
light of the fact that if the allotment is made specifically
mentioning the area and property number, it can be prima facie
inferred that before earmarking the land, the DSIDC would have
on paper divided the total available land among all the eligible
applicants, as per their respective entitlement, whether in excess
or otherwise. Also the factor that there was shortage of land was
considered in the year 1998 itself when instead of 400 sq.mtrs for
which the respondent had applied he was informed that a plot
measuring

maximum

250

sq.mtrs

can

be

allotted

to

the

respondent or to the other applicants and the said factor is also
evident in the public notice dated 14th July, 1999.

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

It has also been

Page 21 of 37

brought to the notice of this Court by the respondents that DSIDC
has advertised for auction of commercial plots at Bawana
Industrial Complex. One such advertisement produced in the Court
highlights that approximately 20000 industrial plots are available
for auction which would take place on 30th December, 2006.
Thus, the contention of the respondent that the said allotments
were cancelled only because there was shortage of land and
therefore it was in public interest to downsize the allotments is
unacceptable in the light of the aforementioned advertisement.
22.Another contention of the DSIDC was that the cancellation was

in consonance with the Cabinet decision/policy. It is pertinent to
note that the said Cabinet decision/policy was in existence at the
time when the final allotments to the respondent and other
applicants were made and it was the DSIDC itself who has totally
undermined the Cabinet decision/policy and made allotments
contrary to the Cabinet decision/policy which is binding on it. The
said act of the DSIDC shows gross negligence on the part of the
DSIDC in making allotments of the said plots.
decision/policy was of the year 1999,

The Cabinet

allotment was made

in

2000 but the mistake could only be detected in the year 2003

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 22 of 37

after receiving full payment for the said plot and communicating
that the said plot is ready to be handed over to the allottee. It
may also be noted that the DSIDC have themselves stated that
before allotment each and every application was scrutinised and
only after the said scrutiny if the applicant was found eligible only
then the allotment was made. The same is evident from the Note
for Council of Ministers date 4/7th June, 1998 wherein it was, inter
alia, stated that after preliminary scrutiny, final scrutiny of
applications has been done at the level of Joint Directors of
industries/Dy.Directors of Industries. We fail to understand that
how come in as many as 521 cases even after such checks the
DSIDC has made the said mistake in undermining the Cabinet
decision/policy for allotment of plots.
23.Learned counsel for DSIDC has referred to decisions of the

Supreme Court in PTR Exports (Madras) Pvt. Limited v. Union
of India (1996) 5 SCC 268, Food Corporation of India v.
Kamdhenu Cattle Feed Industries (1993) 1 SCC 71, Punjab
Communications Limited v. Union of India (1999) 4 SCC 727,
State of NCT of Delhi v. Sanjeev @ Bitto AIR 2005 SC 2080,
Kasinka Trading & Anr. v. Union of India AIR 1995 SC 874,

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 23 of 37

Bannari Amman Sugars v. Commercial Tax Officer JT 2004
(10) SC 500 and a Division Bench decision of this Court in DSIDC
v. Naresh Kumar 128 (2006) DLT 777 (DB). These decisions deal
with the question of legitimate expectation, promissory estoppel
and right of the government to change policy from time to time. It
cannot be denied that the appellant has a right to amend and
modify its policies in public interest. The doctrine of promissory
estoppel, legitimate expectation or principles of Wednesbury
Reasonableness may or may not apply when a challenge is made
to modification or amendment of the earlier policy. However, in
the present case the respondent allottees have not based their
claim

on

the

principles

of

promissory

estoppel,

legitimate

expectation or Wednesbury Reasonableness. The claim of allottees
is that a concluded contract between them and the DSIDC for
allotment of plots of specific sizes has come into existence and
DSIDC cannot by a change in its policy reduce the plot size.
24.It is also admitted case of the parties that pursuant to the
decision of the Supreme Court in M.C.Mehta’s case (supra)
applications were invited from persons who had industries in nonconforming areas to apply for allotment of industrial plots.

said

The allottees were to

deposit 10% of the total estimated cost depending upon the area
for which they had sought allotment. Terms of offer specified the
rate of land, which was @ Rs.3,000/- per sq.mtrs, but the said rate
was subject to revision.
25.On 3rd April 1998, DSIDC informed the respondents allottees that

they had been provisionally found eligible for allotment of
alternative industrial plots for the area specified in the said letter
which was either 250 sq.mtrs or 150 sq.mtrs. However, the said
letter stated that provisional eligibility letter would not confer upon
them any right to claim seniority for allotment of industrial plots.
Actual allotment would be in accordance with policy/guidelines
framed by the Government governing the priority of relocation
depending upon availability of developed land, nature of industry
to be relocated etc. By this letter the respondent allottees were
required to deposit 30% of the estimated cost of the land for which
they had been found to be provisionally eligible. Deposits were
required to be made within sixty days failing which the respondent
allottees were required to pay interest @ 18% per annum on

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

delayed payments. A reading of the above letter shows that the
respondents-allottees were found to be provisionally eligible for
allotment for the size of plots as per the area specified,

but

actual allotment was subject to the policy/guidelines to be framed
by the government governing the priority of relocation depending
upon

and

etc.

Respondent-allottees deposited payments as demanded in terms
of the said letter.
26.After a gap of nearly two years and six months, by letter dated

10th October, 2000, DSIDC informed the respondent allottees as
under :
“2. This is to inform you that based on draw
of lots held on 3rd October, 2000 you have
been found successful for allotment of an
alternative industrial plot measuring 250 sq.
mtr. in Section I, Pocket N having plot No.281
at Bawana Industrial Complex. The tentative
cost of the plot if Rs.4,200/- per sq. mt. which
is subject to change depending upon the
actual cost of development of the industrial
plot and directions issued by the Govt. of
Delhi in this regard.”
27.Respondent allottees were required to deposit 50% of the

revised estimated cost of the plot @ Rs.4,200/- per sq.mtr and pay
the balance amount in instalments as stipulated therein.

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 26 of 37

In

paragraph 12 of the said letter it was mentioned that in case of
any discrepancy, Government of Delhi/DSIDC reserves its right to
withdraw/reject the offer of allotment. A reading of the said letter
clearly shows that the appellant had time of nearly two years and
six months between 3rd April, 1998 till 10th October, 2000 to
scrutinise and examine the applications of the respondents
allottees. Thereupon they issued letter dated 10th October, 2000
confirming exact size of the plots to be alloted to the respondents.
It was stated that the tentative cost of the plot would be Rs.4,200/per sq/m but subject to change depending upon actual cost of
development.

Accordingly allottees were directed to make

payment as stipulated in the said letter.

As far as size of the plot

was concerned, the allotment letter dated 10th October, 2000 was
categorical. In this regard we have reproduced para-2 of the said
letter above.
28.Further, clause 3 of the aforesaid letter specified instalments,

which had to be paid by the respondent – allottees in terms of the
revised estimated cost. 50% of the revised estimated cost of the
entire area of the plot was to be paid by 31st October, 2000 and
further 20% had to be paid within six months of the issue of the

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 27 of 37

letter and third instalment of 20% of the revised estimated cost
had to be paid within six months after payment of the second
instalment. The balance 10% of the cost was to be paid at the
time of handing over of actual possession along with the
difference in cost.
29.The appellant by another letter dated 25th September, 2001

again confirmed allotment of a plot measuring 250 sq. mtrs/150
sq. mtrs to the respondent – allottees by making reference to the
earlier letter dated 10th October, 2000. It was further stated in this
letter that due to administrative reasons the schedule for
depositing the balance 50% payment of the cost of the plot was
deferred as notified in the leading newspaper. The respondent –
allottees were informed that it had been decided that this balance
50% of the cost of the plot should be paid by 31st October, 2001.
The letter also states that the cost of Rs.4200/- per sq. mtrs. was
tentative and the allottee shall be liable to pay any increase in the
cost of plot due to any reason whatsoever. Thus the appellant by
letter dated 25th September, 2001 again confirmed the size of the
plot, which was allotted to the respondent–allottees.

The

appellant had plenty of time till 25th September, 2001 to verify as

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 28 of 37

to the applications filed by the respondent–allottees, which were
made in 1996.
30.The

respondent–allottees

deposited

the

entire

cost

as

demanded by the appellant. The payments were made taking into
account the plot size as was indicated in the letters dated 3 rd April,
1998, 10th October, 2000 and 25th September, 2001.
31.By letter dated 19th December, 2001, the appellant informed the

respondent – allottees the specific plot number that had been
allotted to the respondent – allottees.

The said letter also

specified the area of the plots and was in conformity with the
earlier letters dated 10th October, 2000 and 25th September, 2001
clearly stipulating that the respondent – allottees have been
allotted plots admeasuring 250 sq. mtrs / 150 sq. mtrs, as the case
may be.

The appellant, however, refused to allot the plot of the

said size to the respondent – allottees. The appellant-Corporation
has taken the stand that the Government of NCT of Delhi had
examined eligibility criteria for allotment of industrial plots to
persons who had industries in non-conforming areas.

In the

Cabinet Meeting held on 2nd November, 1996, the eligibility criteria
was examined and was fixed. Thereafter another meeting of the

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 29 of 37

Council of Ministers was held on 23rd August, 1997 when eligibility
criteria was approved with some modifications.

One of the

modifications made by the Council of Ministers in its meeting held
on 23rd August, 1997 was in respect of the units, who had applied
for industrial plots of

bigger size compared to the areas from

which they were earlier functioning. It was decided that no unit
would be entitled to allotment exceeding double of its present
space “rounded to the nearest lower size” of the plot being offered
and subject to a minimum of 100 sq. mtr.

There is no dispute

about the date of the said meeting of the Council of Ministers. The
said meeting was held on 23rd August, 1997.

The appellant,

therefore, had sufficient time to scrutinise, verify and examine the
applications filed by the respondent–allottees in 1996 before
letters dated 10th October, 2000, 25th September, 2001 and 19th
December, 2001 were issued specifying the plot size, which had
been allotted to the respondent–allottees.

If the appellant–

Corporation was negligent or careless in issuing the above letters
to the respondent–allottees, they are to be blamed.

The

respondent–allottees acted on the basis of the said letters and
made payments for the plot size mentioned in the letters. With

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 30 of 37

exchange of these letters and payment of consideration, a
concluded and a binding contract came into existence between
the appellant and the respondent – allottees.

The said binding

contract cannot be washed away, modified, novated or cancelled
contrary to law.

Recently, Supreme Court in Civil Appeal

No.6666/2000 titled Delhi Development Authority, N.D. and
Anr. v. Joint Action Committee, Allottee of SFS Flats and
Ors. reported in 2007 (14) SCALE 507, has observed that
relationship between the parties arises out of the contract and in
such cases terms and conditions of the contract have to be
complied with by both the parties. Terms and conditions can be
modified with mutual consent and not unilaterally unless there
exists a provision in the law or in the contract itself. Novation of
the contract under Section 60 of the Contract Act must precede
with the parties being ad idem insofar as the terms and conditions
are concerned.

It was accordingly observed that the DDA as a

contracting party could not have altered or modified the terms of
contract without informing the parties to the contract and bringing
the modified or altered conditions to the notice of the other
contracting parties. A policy by itself is not law or a Statute which

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 31 of 37

has an effect of thrusting new terms and conditions of the contract
upon a contracting party. A policy decision taken by the Council of
Ministers not to allot a plot double the size of an existing plot does
not affect or modify or alter terms and conditions of a binding
contract. It may be noticed here that the policy decision taken by
the Council of Ministers on 23rd August, 1997 was not circulated to
the allottees either by wide publicity, public notice or individual
notice.

It remained in the files of the appellant–DSIDC.

The

respondent–allottees were not aware of any such policy or
guidelines made by the Council of Ministers. It is not the case of
the appellant that both DSIDC and the respondent– allottees
shared a mutual mistake of a fact of a fundamental character,
which will have the effect of the contract being non est or being hit
by Section 20 of the Indian Contract Act. There was no mistake or
misunderstanding, which prevented an effective agreement or
binding contract coming into existence. The present case can at
the best be one of unilateral mistake by the appellant–DSIDC,
which was not known to the respondent–allottees. Section 22 of
the Indian Contract Act states that a contract is not voidable
merely because it was caused by or because one of the parties

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 32 of 37

was under a mistake as to a matter of fact.

The respondent–

allottees are also not guilty of fraud, misrepresentation or unfair
dealing so as to deny them relief in equity. Contracts are rarely
rescinded on the ground of unilateral mistake unless the other side
is aware of the said mistake and had actual knowledge of the said
mistake or is guilty of fraud, misrepresentation or unfair belief.
Moreover, the respondent–allottees have parted with money and
had deposited the entire sale consideration with the appellantDSIDC.

The same was accepted and retained by the appellant-

DSIDC.

In some cases, the respondent-allottees have even

arranged funds from third parties on loan and interest.
32.The respondent-allottees will suffer loss and damage for no

fault of theirs in case allotments are cancelled even after they
have paid full amount as demanded by the appellant-DSIDC. In
cases where they have taken loan they will be saddled with the
liability to pay interest and other consequences for default. It is
not denied that the policy was in existence even before the final
allotments were made and the allotments were made specifically
mentioning the area and property number and full payment in
respect thereof were received and accepted.

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 33 of 37

33.It would cause prejudice to the respondent–allottees in case the
appellant decides to unilaterally novate the contract and modify
its terms and conditions by reducing the size of the plot. The party
seeking relief i.e. the respondents, are not at fault.

As already

stated above, the appellant–DSIDC was at fault and was negligent
and did not verify the facts in allotment application from 1998
onwards till December, 2001.

The respondent–allottees were

made to part with money for different sizes of plots and as per
areas mentioned in the letters written by the appellant-DSIDC.
The appellant-DSIDC now wants to reduce the size of the plot only
on the ground of unilateral mistake. The appellant–DSIDC has not
relied on Section 23 of the Contract Act. Doctrine of ultra vires has
also not been relied upon. It is not a case of the appellant–DSIDC
that the allotments in question are contrary to the object and
purpose for which the corporation was established. Allotment is
not prohibited by the Memorandum of the DSIDC.
34.At the same time, it may be noted that several other allottees

have been allotted reduced or smaller plots in terms of the policy.
Their requests for bigger plots have been rejected. The terms and
conditions of the contract also gives some flexibility in charging

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 34 of 37

cost or price of the plot. The price as mentioned in the letters was
always tentative and subject to increase. Balancing out these
factors, we direct that the allotment made to the respondentallottees should not be cancelled subject to the condition that the
allottees shall pay Rs.4200/- per sq.mt. for the area upto double
the area occupied by their unit (rounded to the nearest lower size
of the plot being offered and subject to minimum of 100 sq.mtrs.)
but for the remaining or the additional area they shall pay market
rate as on 25th September, 2001. The market rate as on 25th
September, 2001 will be calculated on the basis of the reserve
price fixed by DDA for the auction of plots in the said locality. In
case no reserve price has been fixed, the same may be calculated
on the basis of average bid price received in the auctions during
the financial year preceding the year of allotment, less 10%. No
interest will be payable on the enhanced amount till issue of fresh
allotment letter.
35.The above directions will apply only in cases where the
respondent-allottees have not encashed the cheques for refund
issued by the appellant-DSIDC or have encashed the refund
cheques under protest or without prejudice to their rights and

(LPA 168/2006 & connected matters)

Page 35 of 37

contentions by writing letters within one month from the date
when the refund cheque was received by them. In cases where
allottees have accepted the refund cheques without demur or
protest, they are estopped from making any claim. In the said
cases, the respondent-allottees have accepted the fresh terms of
the contract made by the appellant-DSIDC.
36.DSIDC is directed to issue fresh demand letters in terms of the
aforesaid directions within six weeks from the date of this order
and the respondents are allowed to make payments within four
months thereafter. It is made clear that on failure to make such
payment by the respondents within the specified time, the said
excess allotment shall stand cancelled and the respondents will
