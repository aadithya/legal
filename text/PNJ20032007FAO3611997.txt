PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Vide FAO No.361/1997, DTC has challenged the

award dated 28.4.1997 passed by the learned Judge, MACT, Tis
Hazari, Delhi.
2.

Vide Cross Objection No.323/1999, wife, children

FAO Nos.361/97 & 58/99

page 1 of 12

and parents of late Rambir Singh have sought enhancement of
compensation.
3.

Notwithstanding

cross

objection

filed

in

FAO

No.361/1997, vide FAO No.58/1999, pertaining to the sum
awarded, the wife, children and parents of late Rambir Singh
have sought enhancement of the compensation awarded to
them.
4.

3.12.1987 was an unfortunate day in the life of late

Rambir Singh.

While crossing or pedalling on his cycle on

Rohtak Road, late Rambir Singh was found dead on the spot.
Postmortem report revealed that he died as a result of a
forcible impact with a blunt object. Presumably, it was a motor
vehicle.
5.

He died at the spot.

6.

A claim petition was filed by Rambir Singh's wife, 2

sons, one of whom was a minor, a daughter and his parents.
7.

It was stated in the claim petition that Rambir Singh

was employed as a head-constable with Delhi Police and was
also managing the agricultural lands belonging to the joint
family.
8.

After recording evidence and holding that there was

no reason to disbelieve PW-6 and PW-7 who claimed to be the
FAO Nos.361/97 & 58/99

page 2 of 12

eye-witnesses of the accident and had stated that the
deceased was hit by DTC Bus No.DEP-8777, noting that the
driver of the bus was not produced as a witness by the
respondents,

Tribunal has held that the deceased died as a

result of being hit by the bus in question. Further, relying upon
the testimony of PW-6 and PW-7 it has been held that the bus
was being driven at a high speed i.e. rashly.
9.

Since grievance of DTC is that the learned Tribunal

has wrongly appreciated the evidence and has ignored the
relevant and material evidence as also has overlooked the
cross-examination of PW-6 and PW-7, I would be proceeding to
discuss the 2 appeals by having a re-look at the evidence.
10.

Suffice would it be to note that if on the evidence

two views are possible, the award would have to be upheld on
the finding pertaining to the rash driving of the bus by its
driver. However, if it is found that material evidence has been
ignored or that the evidence on record has not been rationally
understood and applied, the issue would have to be decided in
favour of DTC and against the claimants.
11.

Since PW-6 and PW-7 claimed to be eye-witnesses

to the accident, I begin by appreciating the testimony of said
witnesses as also how they responded on being crossFAO Nos.361/97 & 58/99

page 3 of 12

examined.
12.

PW-6, Bhagat Singh, in his examination-in-chief,

stated as under:-

13.

“On 3.12.87 at about 6.00/6.15 p.m. an accident
took place with DTC bus No.DEP-8777 at Tikri
Piao. The bus was coming from Tikri Border and
going towards Delhi side at a high speed. A
cyclist was also going on the same road towards
Delhi when the DTC bus hit him from behind with
a forceful impact. The bus hit the injured from its
left front side. I was present there with my
buffaloes which I brought from Tikri Border. The
bus driver fled away with his bus from the spot. I
left the spot with my cattles.”
In his examination-in-chief, PW-7 Raghubir stated as

under:“On 3.12.87 I saw an accident near Tikri Piao at
about 6.00/6.15 pm with a DTC bus No.DEP-8777
with a cyclist. We were standing on the central
verge of the road which divides into two parts.
Both cyclist and bus were going to Delhi side. The
bus was at a high speed. The bus hit the cyclist
from its left front side. After some time the bus
fled away and we went to our home.”
14.

On cross-examination, PW-6 Bhagat Singh stated

that he did not lodge any complaint with the police and that his
statement was recorded by the police after 2 or 4 days. He
stated that he did not note in writing the number of the bus.
He stated that the deceased was a resident of his village.
15.

In his cross-examination, PW-7, Raghubir stated; to

quote from his testimony:FAO Nos.361/97 & 58/99

page 4 of 12

16.

“The deceased was my village brother. He was
also village brother of Shri Bhagat Singh.......... The
deceased was also of my community.
The
deceased was of my family (khandan).”
He further deposed that he and Bhagat Singh did

not lodge a report with the police. He stated that at the time of
the accident he and Bhagat Singh were crossing the road as
they were taking their buffaloes to the village.
17.

Analyzing the evidence of PW-6 and PW-7, in para

14 of the award, conclusions arrived at by the learned Judge
are as under:“14.
PW-6 Bhagat Singh and PW-7 Raghuvir
were co-villagers of the deceased. The accident had
taken place nearby the village where the deceased
was residing. The presence of these witnesses
nearby the spot cannot be doubted. They have
asserted that it was DTC bus number DEP-8777
which had caused the accident. They have further
asserted that the DTC bus was being driven at a
very high speed and had hit the deceased from
behind with its left front side.

18.

14.
The witnesses have been examined at
length and have stood the test of cross examination.
I, therefore, hold that the deceased died due to rash
and negligent driving of the bus No.8777 by R-2.”
PW-5, SI Ranbir Singh who had investigated the

accident deposed that on 3.12.1987 he was posted as a Sub
Inspector at PS Nangloi.

That he received information

regarding the accident and reached the spot.

He found the

deceased lying dead on the spot. No witness was present. He
sent the body for postmortem to a hospital and prepared the
FAO Nos.361/97 & 58/99

page 5 of 12

site-plan Ex.PW-5/1.

He further stated that he recorded the

statements of Bhagat Singh and Raghubir on 4.12.1987 during
investigation.

He stated that he seized the cycle of the

deceased at the spot.
19.

However, in his cross-examination he stated that he

came to know subsequently that the deceased was on a cycle
and after sometimes he seized the cycle from the spot.

He

stated

the

that

during

investigation

he

learnt

about

involvement of the bus in the accident. He further stated that
the mechanical inspection of the bus was got done on
8.12.1987 and that he had challaned the driver of the bus
under Section 279 read with Section 304 (A) IPC.
20.

PW-1, Dr.Raj Kumar who conducted the postmortem

of the deceased proved the postmortem report as Ex.PW-1/1.
21.

PW-3, Head Constable Jay Ram proved the FIR as

Ex.PW-3/1.
22.

FIR Ex.PW-3/1 has been registered at PS Nangloi on

3.12.1987 pursuant to DD Entry No.17-A at about 7.30 pm.
The name of the informant has been disclosed as SI Ranbir
Singh i.e. PW-5.

The same has been registered by duty

constable Sukh Ram. As per the FIR it was recorded pursuant
to a DD entry recorded as per telephonic information given by
FAO Nos.361/97 & 58/99

page 6 of 12

SI Ranbir Singh.
23.

It would be relevant to note that the FIR does not

record the number of the offending vehicle.
24.

Ex.PW-1/1, postmortem report of the deceased

records that Constable Naresh Kumar had brought the body
under the instruction of SI Ranbir Singh. It records that it was
alleged that the deceased was found dead on the road due to
injuries sustained at a roadside accident.
25.

The FIR and the postmortem report clearly show

that no person known to the deceased from the village had
accompanied the body to the hospital.
26.

It is in this context that testimony of PW-6 and PW-7

needs to be analyzed.
27.

Both categorically stated that the deceased was of

their village.

PW-7 stated that the deceased was his village

brother and also was of his community.
28.

If the two had witnessed the accident their conduct

of quietly walking away to their residence and not informing
the police about the accident assumes significance.
29.

Indeed, it is unnatural conduct.

It is not a case

where an unknown person was hit and the eye-witness being
personally unconcerned with the accident just walked away.
FAO Nos.361/97 & 58/99

page 7 of 12

Normal human conduct, on seeing a person known being hit by
a bus and that too grievously is to render immediate aid to the
victim.
30.

The evidence on record casts a doubt that

witnessed the accident.

they

Their non presence is clearly

suggestive of the 2 being implanted witnesses.
31.

Being residents of the same village in which the

deceased resided, the 2 have obviously volunteered to falsely
implicate the bus in question.
32.

It would also be relevant to note that the site plan

prepared by SI Ranbir Singh proved as Ex.PW-5/1 does not
show the spot at which the stated cycle of the deceased was
lying.
33.

As noted above, SI Ranbir Singh stated that he

seized the cycle at the spot but in cross-examination stated
that after sometimes he learnt that the deceased was on a
cycle and thereafter he seized the same on the spot.
34.

Had there been a cycle at the spot it was impossible

for SI Ranbir Singh not to have noted the same.

It was

impossible that while preparing the sketch of the site i.e. the
site plan, position of the cycle, if available at the spot, was not
recorded.
FAO Nos.361/97 & 58/99

page 8 of 12

35.

No seizure memo pertaining to the cycle has been

proved.
36.

Unfortunately, the learned Tribunal, in recording its

opinion in the 2 paragraphs, both numbered as 14, (contents
noted in para 17 above) has ignored the afore-noted features
of the case pertaining to the testimony of PW-6 and PW-7, as
brought out in their cross-examination.
37.

Since PW-6 and PW-7 have stated that they were

taking their buffaloes to the village when the accident took
place, assuming that they could not have left their buffaloes at
the spot to render aid to the victim and even ignoring the
logical conduct that 1 out of the 2 could have taken buffaloes
to the village and the other could remain at the spot to render
aid to the victim, it remains unexplained as to why after
reaching their village they did not inform the co-villagers about
a village brother being hit by a bus and receiving serious
injuries. On reaching the village and handing over custody of
the buffaloes to the family members, normal conduct of the
said 2 witnesses ought to have been to gather a few villagers
and rush back to the spot or at least inform the police about
the accident.

Their complete silence and disclosure of the

number of the bus to the police after 2 days seriously casts a
FAO Nos.361/97 & 58/99

page 9 of 12

doubt about their presence at the spot and witnessing the
accident.
38.

Every death is traumatic to the family, more so

where it is an unnatural death. It is painful to lose a loved one
and that too by getting injured at a road accident. No doubt,
appreciation of evidence at a trial before Motor Accidents Claim
Tribunal has to be by not applying the standard of proof
beyond reasonable doubt, and principles of res ipsa loquitor
can be invoked, but the minimum standard of proof, namely
involvement of the vehicle cannot be jettisoned.
39.

There is a tendency to falsely implicate.

Some

evidence, purity whereof is not in doubt, must come on record
and only thereafter, treating the same as the starting point of
discussion, other evidence has to be evaluated.
40.

In the instant case, testimony of the 2 so called eye-

witnesses is tainted with falsehood. Their conduct belies their
presence at the spot. If testimony of PW-6 and PW-7 is to be
eschewed, there is no other evidence to establish the
involvement of the bus.
41.

A last contention needs to be noted and dealt with.

42.

It was urged that the driver of the bus was not

examined by the respondents. Therefore, it was urged that an
FAO Nos.361/97 & 58/99

page 10 of 12

adverse inference has to be drawn against the driver.
43.

I may note that the conductor of the bus was

examined as RW-1 and he denied the involvement of the bus in
any accident.
44.

The rule of drawing inference when the driver of the

offending vehicle choses not to examine himself has to be
applied with care and caution. Where involvement of a motor
vehicle is established and the claimants give their version, it
would be a relevant factor that the driver of the offending
vehicle has chosen not to sustain his version of the accident.
Meaning thereby, if the accident involving the motor vehicle is
an admitted fact and the only issue between the parties is the
manner in which the accident took place, non examination of
the driver of the offending vehicle as a respondents witness
can be weighed by the Court and can be used as a negative
evidence against the respondent.

But where the very

involvement of the vehicle is in issue, driver of the offending
vehicle not stepping into the witness box would not be a piece
of negative evidence to be used against the owner and the
driver of the vehicle.
45.

The inevitable conclusion is that the involvement of

the bus bearing No.DEP-8777 in the accident has not been
FAO Nos.361/97 & 58/99

page 11 of 12

established by any evidence.
46.

FAO No.361/1997 is allowed.

47.

Since appeal filed by DTC is being allowed question

of enhancing the compensation does not arise.
48.

Cross Objection No.323/1999 in FAO No.361/1997 as

also FAO No.58/1999 are dismissed.
49.

Noting that the sum awarded by the Tribunal has

been received by the claimants, it would be open to DTC to
move an application before the learned Tribunal for restitution.
50.

LCR be remitted.

51.

No costs.
