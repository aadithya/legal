PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

I have heard learned counsel for the appellant and

with his assistance gone through the record of the learned Trial
Judge.
2.

On 16.3.2007, following substantial question of law

was framed :“If a confectionery shop is run in a residence
whether the shopkeeper is liable to pay
commercial charges?”
3.

To appreciate the substantial question of law

framed, backdrop facts which require to be noted are that the

respondent was aggrieved when without serving upon her a
show cause notice, she received a water bill pertaining to
connection No.6409 installed at premises bearing No.Z-22,
Naveen Shahdara, Delhi-32 on non-domestic rates. She filed a
civil suit for permanent injunction alleging that premises in
question was a residential house and that water connection
sanctioned was under domestic consumer category and bills
required to be raised were as per tariff applicable to a domestic
connection.

She stated that the appellant could not raise a

water bill on non-domestic tariff.
4.

Needless

to

state

the

issue

which

arose

for

consideration in the suit was whether the respondent was
entitled to charge tariff at commercial rates.
5.

It was not in dispute between the parties that from a

part of the premises a shop was being run.

Confectionery

items were sold therefrom.
6.

The learned Trial Judge concluded that in view of the

fact that part of the premises for which water connection was
obtained was being used for a non-residential purpose,
appellant would be entitled to raise bills as per tariff applicable
for commercial buildings.

Vide judgment and decree dated

10.2.2003 the suit was dismissed.
7.

In appeal, being RCA No.30/2003, the learned

RSA NO.39/2007

Page No.2 of 5

Appellate Judge considered the matter a little deeper with
reference to question whether there was evidence on record to
sustain a finding that the respondent was using water for the
business of the confectionery shop.
8.

First Appellate Court allowed the appeal vide

judgment and decree dated 1.11.2006.

The judgment and

decree of the learned Trial Judge was reversed.

Suit was

decreed.
9.

I have gone through the evidence on record.

The

evidence shows that the appellant never served a show cause
notice to the respondent before changing the category under
which the connection was sanctioned.

The evidence shows

that the water connection was sanctioned under domestic
category. Further no suggestion to the effect that water was
being used in the conduct of the business of the confectionery
shop has been put up by the appellant to the witness of the
respondent who I note is none else other than her son who
appeared as PW-1.
10.

I note that DW-1, the Meter Inspector had stated in

his evidence that when he inspected the premises he saw a
wash basin installed adjacent to the shop and that water was
taken through a pipeline in the said wash basin.
11.

It appears what the witness intended to say was

RSA NO.39/2007

Page No.3 of 5

that through a pipeline water was reaching the wash basin.
12.

Be that as it may, 2 things stand out.

Firstly, no

show cause notice was issued to the respondent before
changing the category under which water connection was
sanctioned. Secondly, no suggestion was given to the witness
of the respondent in harmony with the stand of the appellant
that water was used in connection with the conduct of
business.
13.

On the question of law framed, suffice would it be to

record that merely because a confectionery shop is run from a
residential house would not render liable the category of water
connection to be changed on said count alone unless it is
additionally shown that water was being used in connection
with the business of the confectionery shop. Further dominant
user of the premises would also have to be kept in mind.
14.

In the instant case I find no evidence to sustain a

finding that water was being used for the business of the
confectionery shop.
15.

I notice that according to the respondent no cooking

activity

was

shop.

being

conducted

from

the

confectionery

Pre-manufactured food items in sealed packets were

being sold and continue to be sold therefrom.
16.

The inevitable conclusion has to be that the

RSA NO.39/2007

Page No.4 of 5

impugned judgment and decree dated 1.11.2006 passed by
the learned First Appellate Judge does not call for any
interference.
17.

The appeal is dismissed.

18.

No costs.

19.

TCR be returned forthwith.
