The appellants are in appeal against the

4.

The appellants faced trial on the allegations
that they committed murder of a 12 year old child
and tried to extort Rs.3 lacs from the father of the
child by making a phone call for his safe release.
The facts of the case reveal that on 6th of October,
2001 at about 2.00 p.m., Deepak, deceased, left his
house telling his mother

that he was going to the

house of appellant Vijay Kumar to collect payment of
Rs.1,100/-, which he owed to them.
return.

He did not

His parents made an unsuccessful search

for him. Around 9.45 p.m. a phone call meant for
Devinder

Choudhary, father of the child, was

received at a nearby provision shop.

On Devinder

Choudhary attending the phone call, he was asked
to arrange for payment of Rs.3 lacs by Monday in
Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

Page 3 of 24

lieu of release of his son.

On such a phone call

being received, realising that his son had actually
been kidnapped, Devinder Choudhary went to the
Police Station Kapashera at about 10.30 p.m. to
lodge a complaint for kidnapping of his child and,
accordingly, an FIR under Section 364-A IPC was
initially registered.
5.

On the intervening night of 6/7 of October,
2001, all the three appellants were apprehended
together and subjected to interrogation by the police.
Each one of them made a disclosure that the dead
body of the missing child stuffed in a gunny bag was
being kept by them in their room.

The appellants

led the police to their room No.11 of House No.629,
Kapashera and got the dead body of Deepak, kept in
a gunny bag under a table, recovered.

the prosecution based its

case on circumstantial evidence. The circumstances
that were held by the learned trial court firmly
established find mention in para 4 of the impugned
Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

Page 4 of 24

judgment. On examining the evidence on record, the
learned trial court found that the circumstances
taken together formed a chain so complete that there
was no escape from the conclusion within all human
probability that the crime was committed by the
appellants and none else.

It found that the

circumstances proved were incapable of explanation
on any reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt
against the appellants.
7.

A common argument raised on behalf of the
appellants against their impugned conviction and
sentence was that the room from which recovery of
dead body of Deepak was effected was actually not
in their occupation

and therefore, recovery of the

dead body of Deepak from room No.11 of House
No.629,

Kapashera

could

not

have

been

an

incriminating circumstance to find them guilty of the
murder in question. It was further contended that
the recovery of the dead body of Deepak from the
said room could not be held to have been effected
pursuant to alleged disclosures by them as a joint
Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

Page 5 of 24

disclosure would not be

admissible under Section

27 of the Evidence Act.

On behalf of appellants

Arvind Kumar and Udaiveer Singh, it was contended
that there is no evidence to establish that they were
present at the scene of crime at the time when
Deepak, deceased, had come to room No.11 of House
No.629, Kapashera and was done to death. Further
argument on their behalf was that no motive to
commit murder of Deepak has been brought forth
against them.
8.

Ms. Richa Kapur, learned APP, appearing for
the State contended that there is sufficient evidence
to prove that the room in question was in joint
occupation of the appellants and that on the fateful
day the deceased had been to that place to realise
the amount of Rs.1,100/- which appellant Vijay
Kumar owed to his parents. She submitted that in
view of statements of the mother of the deceased and
Ishwar Singh, PW-5, it is proved that the appellants
Vijay Kumar and Udaiveer Singh were present at the
gate of the house when the deceased

Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

approached
Page 6 of 24

them and that on being asked by appellant Vijay
Kumar, the deceased had gone upstairs to take the
payment. She contended that all the appellants had
separately disclosed that dead body of Deepak had
been kept in a gunny bag in their room under a table
and that they could get the same recovered. Relying
on a decision in “State(NCT of Delhi) Vs. Navjot
Sandhu @ Afsan Guru” , (2005)

11 SCC 600,

Ms.Kapur contended that all the three appellants
made disclosure in regard to the dead body of
Deepak being kept in a gunny bag in their room and
even though the recovery of the dead body was got
effected by the appellant Vijay Kumar, the aforesaid
information in respect of the dead body given by
each one of the appellants would continue to be
admissible in evidence under Section 27 of the
Evidence

Act.

She

argued

that

plurality

of

information received before discovery would not
necessarily take any of the information out of the
ambit of Section 27 of the Evidence Act and the
information received from each appellant separately

respectively as also Ms. Richa Kapoor, Addl. P.P. for

10.

The conviction of the appellants for murder of

Deepak

rests on circumstantial evidence. The

circumstances which accounted for their conviction
may be broadly categorized as under :
1.

The deceased being last seen with

the appellants at their place of residence;
2.

Disclosures

made

by

each

appellant leading to recovery of dead body
of Deepak in a gunny bag from their
residential room;

11.

Deepak deceased left his house around 2.00

pm on 6th October, 2001 to go to the house of
appellants to collect payment of

Rs.1100/- from

appellant Vijay Kumar which he owed to his parents
for execution of a job work. This fact is evident from
the testimony of Smt. Babli, PW-1 and Devinder
Chaudhary, PW-2. Deposition of Ishwar Singh, PW5

supplies

corroboration

to

their

statements.

According to Ishwar Singh, PW-5 he, while going
back to his place of work after taking lunch noticed
Deepak, deceased going ahead of him to the room of
the appellants and on reaching there he (PW-5) saw
appellants Vijay Kumar and Udaiveer Singh present
at the gate of the house. The appellants were jointly
living

in a room of the house belonging to one

Bhoop Singh.

Ishwar Singh, PW-5 heard Deepak,

deceased demanding from appellant Vijay Kumar the
amount due from him and appellant Vijay Kumar
asking Deepak to come upstairs to his room to take
the payment.

He thereupon saw Deepak going

Page 9 of 24

upstairs. On Deepak not returning to his house his
mother Smt. Babli, PW-1 went to the room of the
appellants

after about 30/45 minutes, looking for

him. She however, did not go upstairs and called
Deepak

from down stairs only.

Finding no

response to her call, she went back.

At about

went to the

12.

Mr. K.B. Andley, learned Senior advocate

appearing

for appellant Udaiveer Singh contended

that in terms of

statement of Ishwar Singh, PW-5

when appellant

Vijay Kumar had asked Deepak,

deceased to accompany him upstairs to the room,
there is no evidence indicating that

appellant

Udaiveer Singh had also gone upstairs with them.
No doubt Ishwar Singh, PW-5 did not state if he had
seen appellant Udaiveer Singh as well

going

upstairs with co-appellant Vijay Kumar and Deepak,
deceased, it is noticed from the testimony of Smt.
Babli, PW-1 that appellant Udaiveer Singh was
found keeping company with his co-appellant Vijay

on the

Thus, his

presence at the house at 2.00 pm, as deposed by
Ishwar Singh, PW-5

and also at about 3.30 pm

when Smt. Babli, PW-1 went to their room for the
second time clearly indicates that he remained
present at the house itself throughout and had not
Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

Page 11 of 24

moved away from there.

There is however no

evidence of appellant Arvind Kumar's presence
either at 2.00 pm when Deepak, deceased was seen
being taken upstairs to the room or at 3.30 pm when
Smt. Babli, PW-1, the mother of the deceased had
gone there and found only appellants Vijay Kumar
and Udaiveer Singh present outside the house. The
only evidence produced by prosecution against
appellant Arvind Kumar

to connect him with the

commission of murder of Deepak is in the form of
statement of one Sanjay Sharma, PW-16, who
produced copies of gate pass and attendance register
vide Ex. PW 16/1-3 to prove that appellant Arvind
Kumar had left the factory premises, where he was
working, at 1.47 pm on 6th October, 2001 by taking
half day leave. Deepak would appear to have been
done to death sometime

after 2.00 pm.

The

appellant Arvind Kumar was on the relevant date
working in a leather factory at Gurgaon.

to distance between his factory and

Even though there is no
showing the

distance of Kapashera from the factory
where appellant

approximate
in Gurgaon

Arvind Kumar was working,

cannot be lost sight of

it

that the factory being

situated in Gurgaon one had to cover atleast some
distance from Gurgaon to reach Kapashera.

The

appellant Arvind Kumar in his statement under
Section 313 Cr.P.C. though admitted

that on 6 th

October, 2001 he was on half day leave and had left
his factory premises at 1.47 pm but added that he
had taken half day leave to do some shopping. Even
if it be accepted

that the appellant Arvind Kumar

left his factory premises at 1.47 pm and proceeded
direct to

Kapashera where he lived with his co-

appellants, it was unlikely that he could have
reached the place of his residence in Kapashera by
2.00 pm when Deepak, deceased was last seen with
co-appellants Vijay Kumar and Udaiver.

It is

noteworthy that even at 3.30 pm when Smt. Babli,

booth of Mr. Surinder Tiwari, PW-3, cannot provide a
basis to find the presence of the appellant Arvind
Kumar at his room when the murder of Deepak was
committed. He can, at best be held to have come to
know at a later point of time about commission of
murder of Deepak and his dead body being kept in
a gunny bag on his reaching the room. Thus, the
finding of learned trial court in regard to

Kumar, in addition to his co-appellants Vijay Kumar
and Udaiveer Singh, being last seen with the

13.

The dead body of Deepak was recovered from

the room of the appellants pursuant to separate
disclosures Ex. PW 2/4, PW 2/5 and PW 2/6 made
by appellants Udaiveer Singh, Vijay Kumar and
Arvind Kumar respectively on their interrogation by
the police after arrest. From the statements of the
witnesses namely, Ramesh Kumar, PW-8, Devinder
Chaudhary, PW-2 and Ram Chander, PW-6
gathered

it is

that appellant Vijay Kumar was the first

one to furnish the information about the dead body
of Deepak being kept in a gunny bag in their room.
Similar disclosure statements were made by the
other two appellants recorded separately.
counsel for the appellants

Learned

Udaiveer Singh and

Arvind Kumar contended that once

co-appellant

Vijay Kumar had made a disclosure with respect to
dead body of Deepak, proximate information in that
Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

Page 15 of 24

regard by appellants Udaiveer Singh and Arvind
Kumar

could not be held admissible in evidence

against them as the said fact, which stood already
discovered, could not be claimed to have been
rediscovered on the basis of information furnished
by appellants Udaiveer Singh and Arvind Kumar.
Learned Addl. P.P. however

submitted on the

strength of the Supreme Court decision in Navjot
Sandhu @ Afsan Guru (supra) that even though the
disclosures made by each appellant led to plurality
of information, the disclosure made by respective
appellants did not cease to be an information
causing

'discovery' within the purview of Section

27 of the Evidence Act. In Navjot Sandhu @ Afsan
Guru (supra) dwelling on the scope of Section 27 of
the Evidence Act with a particular reference to joint
disclosures, it was ruled :
“.....Joint disclosures, to be
more
accurate, simultaneous disclosures, per
se, are not inadmissible under Section
27.
“A person accused”
need not
necessarily be a single person, but it
could be plurality of the accused. It
seems to us that the real reason for not
Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

Page 16 of 24

acting upon
the joint disclosures by
taking resort
to Section 27 is the
inherent difficulty in placing reliance on
such information supposed to have
emerged from the mouths of two or more
accused at a time. In fact, joint or
simultaneous disclosure is a myth,
because two or more accused persons
would not have uttered informatory
words in a chorus. At best, one person
would have made the statement orally
and the other person would have stated
so substantially in similar terms a few
seconds or minutes later, or the second
person would have given unequivocal
nod to what has been said by the first
person. Or, two persons in custody may
be
interrogated
separately
and
simultaneously and both of them may
furnish similar information leading to the
discovery of fact. Or, in rare cases, both
the accused may reduce the information
into writing and hand over the written
notes to the police officer at the same
time.
We do not think that such
disclosures by two or more persons in
police custody go out of the purview of
Section 27 altogether. If information is
given one after the other without any
break, almost simultaneously, and if
such information is
followed up by
pointing out the material thing by both
of them, we find no good reason to
eschew such evidence from the regime of
Section 27”.
The legal position on joint disclosures as it
emerges

is

that

the

same

per

se

are

not

inadmissible under Section 27 of the Evidence Act.
Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

The

plea

against

admissibility

of

disclosure

statements Ex. PW -2/4 and PW 2/6 made by
appellants

Udaiveer

Singh

and

Arvind

Kumar

respectively must therefore get answered in negative.
Unlike in the case of appellants Vijay Kumar and
Udaiver, who were last seen with Deepak, deceased
immediately before commission of his murder, there
being

no such evidence against appellant Arvind

Kumar,

the

disclosure

statement

Ex.

PW-2/6

regarding dead body of deceased would at the most
lead to conclude that he had knowledge of the dead
body of Deepak concealed in a gunny bag being kept
in the room. Thus, even if his disclosure Ex. PW
2/6 is taken to have led to discovery of dead body of
Deepak this circumstance alone cannot suffice to
prove his

complicity in commission of murder of

Deepak.
14.

Though the appellants in the course of their

examination under Section 313 Cr.P.C. took

the

stand that on the relevant date when the murder of
Deepak took place and

recovery of his dead body

Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

was effected from room No.11 of House No.629
Kapashera they were not living in that room rather
they were staying at different addresses, they
omitted to produce any evidence to show that they
had actually been living at addresses different from
the room in question.
other

Apart from statements of

witnesses including the parents of the

deceased, the statement of Ramesh Kumar, PW-8
the owner/landlord of the house, establishes that
all the three appellants were on the relevant date
living as tenants in the room wherefrom dead body
of Deepak was recovered.

The fact that

the

appellants were in joint physical occupation of the
room is proved by Smt. Babli, PW-1, Devinder
Choudhary, PW-2, Ishwar Singh, PW-5 and Ram
Chander, PW-6 as well.

It was

appellant Vijay

Kumar who pursuant to disclosure made by him,
opened the

lock of the room in question with the

key which he possessed. Unless the room was in
their possession the key of the lock could not have
been available with him. There is thus sufficient
Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

Page 19 of 24

evidence on record to hold beyond doubt that the
room No.11 of House No.629 Kapashera was in joint
occupation of the appellants and none else. Thus
the plea of the appellants to the contrary must fail.
15.

On dead body of Deepak being taken out of

the gunny bag it was found that its hands and feet
were tied with Niwar and a piece thereof was also
found

tied around the neck.

A piece of tape was

found pasted over the mouth of Deepak deceased. A
roll of Niwar Ex. P-11 and a roll of tape Ex. P-10
were recovered

from the appellants' room at the

instance of appellant Vijay Kumar. The roll of Niwar
Ex. P-11 as also

the pieces of Niwar used on the

dead body were on forensic examination found to be
'similar in respect of colour, texture, design, width,
thickness, weaving pattern, diameter of the fibers,
microscopic appearance and U.V. fluorescence' vide
Ex.

PW 15/1. Similarly, the piece of tape pasted

over the mouth of Deepak, deceased and the roll of
tape Ex. P-10 recovered at the instance of appellant
Vijay Kumar were also, on examination “found to be
Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

Page 20 of 24

possessing similar physico-chemical characteristics”
vide Ex. P 15/1. It is thus clearly established that
the pieces of Niwar and adhesive tape used on the
dead body of Deepak were taken out of the roll of
Niwar Ex. P-11 and roll of tape Ex. P-10 recovered at
the instance

of appellant Vijay Kumar.

While

recovery of rolls of tape and Niwar constitutes an
incriminating circumstance against the
Vijay

Kumar

and

Udaiveer

appellants

Singh, in

view

of

doubtful presence of the appellant Arvind Kumar at
the time of commission of murder of Deepak, such
recovery

cannot be used to sustain the impugned

conviction under Section 302/34 IPC against him.
16.

Apart from

being held guilty

by the

trial

court for the murder of Deepak, the appellants have
also been convicted for attempting to extort Rs.3 lacs
from Devinder Choudhary, PW-2 in return of 'safe
release' of his son Deepak.

A phone call was

received by Devinder Choudhary, PW-2 at about
9.45/10.00 pm demanding a ransom of Rs.3 lacs for
release of his son.

This phone call was received at

Crl. A.No.654/05, Crl. A.No.723/03 & Crl. A.No.783/03

Page 21 of 24

a provision store of one Mr.

Ved Prakash, PW-4,

situated near his house. Immediately on receiving
the call for ransom, Devinder Choudhary, PW-2
rushed to the Police Station Kapashera and on his
lodging a complaint, a FIR Ex. P-2/1 was registered
on 6th October, 2001 at 10.30 pm.

In that FIR

Devinder Choudhary, PW-2 made mention of the
ransom call for Rs.3 lacs. In terms of testimony of
Surinder Tiwari, PW-3, at the same time when
Devinder Choudhary, PW-2 had received the said
phone call at the shop of Ved Prakash, PW-4, a
phone call was made by appellants Vijay Kumar and
Arvind Kumar from his STD booth. The STD booth
of Surinder Tiwari, PW-3 was pointed out by the said
two appellants after their arrest vide memos Ex. PW

that was received by Devinder

Devinder Choudhary, PW-2 did

receive a ransom

call at the phone of Ved Prakash, PW-4 and the
ransom call so received could have been made only
by a person/s who could be holding custody of
Deepak, dead or alive.

Recovery of dead body of

Deepak from the room of the appellants, coupled
with timing of the phone call made by appellants
Vijay Kumar and Arvind Kumar from STD booth of
Surinder Tiwari, PW-3 coinciding with the time of
phone call received by Devinder Choudhary, PW-2
clearly lead to infer that the ransom call was made
by

the appellants only and none else.

Thus the

conviction of the appellants under Section 386/34
IPC read with Section 511 IPC recorded by the trial
court against the appellants and sentence imposed
on them deserve to be upheld.
17.

In view of findings as aforesaid, we find no
