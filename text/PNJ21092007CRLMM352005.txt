Backdrop facts giving rise to the present petitions are

that in the year 2000 the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
registered a case against some employees of DDA who were
allegedly involved in a housing allotment scam. Smt. Usha
Ravichandran, Senior Personal Secretary to Commissioner
(Personnel) was also accused of being involved in the scam.
Thereafter, all the employees booked as accused by CBI
including Smt. Usha Ravinchandran were suspended. (Usha
Ravichandran was suspended on 16.11.2000)
4.

Subsequently, on 15.6.2001 suspension of Smt. Usha

Ravichandran was revoked and she was reinstated. It is
pertinent to note that Smt. Usha Ravichandran was the only
suspended employee to be reinstated.
5.

On 4.5.2001, a news item appeared in the New Delhi

edition of the newspaper ‘Navbharat Times’. English translation
of said news item reads as under: “RESENTMENT AMONGST THE EMPLOYEES OF
DDA OVER REVOCATION OF SUSPENSION OF
USHA RAMCHANDRAN
Senior Correspondent, New Delhi.
Page Nos.3 of 36

There is a grave resentment among the
employees of DDA over the news of revocation of
suspension of Usha Ramachandran, Private
Secretary to Commissioner (Personal) DDA who
is accused of bungling to the tune of several
crores in allotment of DDA flats.
The CBI conducted raids in the month of
November last year at the offices and residential
premises of several officers of DDA including this
woman employee. A huge amount of cash,
document relating to DDA houses were
recovered from the possession. CBI had
registered a case against these officers after the
recovery of this property.
According to leaders of the employees it is
improper to revoke the suspension of only one
accused out of seven accused persons by the
officers of DDA without obtaining permission
from CBI. They alleged that this has been done at
the
behest
of
high
level
political
recommendation.
According to sources this file has been sent to
Chief Vigilance Officer of DDA on Thursday
evening after taking decision to revoke the
suspension of Usha Ramchandran. Now orders in
this regard have to be issued from there.

6.

According to sources that, being aware of the
mysterious aspects of this matter all the officers
of DDA are reluctant to take decision on
revocation of suspension of Usha Ramchandran
and of becoming a party to this decision, but
they are being forced to do this by pressure of
above.”
On 21.6.2001, a news item appeared in the daily edition

of the newspaper ‘Hindustan Times’. Said news item reads as
under: “Scam-tainted DDA staffer gets her job back

Page Nos.4 of 36

Aruna P.Sharma
New Delhi, June 20
A DDA employee facing Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) probe in connection with housing
scandal, which broke out last year, has been
reinstated.
The orders revoking suspension have been
issued despite opposition from the CBI officials who
were yet to complete their inquiry and finalise
report.
The personal secretary of Commissioner,
Personnel, Usha Ravichandran is the only employee
under investigation who has been reinstated while
others continue to be under suspension.
The CBI had raided the premises of Usha and a
number of employees last November in connection
with fraudulent allotment of flats and illegal refunds.
She along with Ashok Kapoor, personal
Secretary to the then Vice Chairman, Director
Housing V.K. Shinged and others were suspended
following raids in their offices and residential
premises.
A CBI official on condition of anonymity said
there was pressure from the very beginning to
reinstate Usha.
The last request for giving her clean chit came
about two to three months ago but after that we
have not been approached, the official said. He
added that there was evidence against Usha who
was apparently a conduit for receiving payments for
making favourable transfers and postings.
One of the accused M.L.Ahuja, Assistant
Director Social Welfare had confessed to the
investigating officials that he made regular
payments to Usha for transfers and postings.
Payment slips in the name of Usha were also
found at Ahuja's premises. Ahuja's son Mohit is a
Page Nos.5 of 36

property dealer and was doing housing related work,
the official added.
The reinstatement of Usha, who is allegedly
close to the Commissioner, Personnel, has sparked
off Personnel, has sparked off resentment in DDA.
Some of the employee union members said that
there is little hope of tackling corruption if senior
officials bend backwards to reinstate their
favourites.
They pointed out that the reinstatement had
been made in spite of clear instructions from the
Central Vigilance Commission that clearance is
required
from
the
agency
on
whose
recommendation suspensions have been made; in
this case the CBI.
They also said that she had reported back to
Personnel Department on rejoining and had
proceeded on leave immediately.
When contacted Vice Chairman of DDA,
Prasanna Hota said that the reinstatement was
made, as there was dire shortage of personal
secretaries in DDA. It was made after consulting the
CVC. Finance Member Laxman Rao had also gone
into the merits of the case.
Asked why only one suspended employee was
reinstated, Mr. Hota said that if others made
representation,
their
cases
would
also
be
considered.

7.

In the absence of evidence against Usha, she
was reinstated, Vice Chairman said.
She has,
however, not been posted in Personnel or Housing
departments,
he
pointed
out.”
(Underlining
emphasized)
On 24.6.2001, a news item appeared in the New

Delhi edition of

the newspaper ‘Dainik

Jagran’.

English

translation of said news item reads as under: “HOUSING ALLOTMENT SCANDAL
Page Nos.6 of 36

Many questions take birth with the reinstatement
of Private Secretary
Naveen Gautam
New Delhi: 24thJune. With the secret reinstatement
of Private Secretary to the Commissioner
(Personnel) of Delhi Development Authority,
accused in Housing-Allotment Scandal, many
questions are being raised. Whereas on the one
hand, the Private Secretary's proceeding on leave
just after taking charge after her reinstatement is a
hot topic of discussion amongst the D.D.A.
employees, on the other hand, other D.D.A.
employees named as accused in the said Scandal
have reason to rejoice. They hope that they would
also be reinstated. On seeing the said charged
officials, people have started guessing as what will
be the result of the Enquiry of Housing Allotment
Scandal.
It is worth consideration that in connection
with Houses Allotment Scandal, C.B.I. last year on
10th November, while making raid at Vikas Sadan,
the Head Office of D.D.A., had registered cases
against about a dozen persons, who were
immediately suspended by the Authority.
The
suspended officers included the then Director
(Housing) V.K.Singh, Personal Secretary to the
Vice-Chairman, Ashok Kapur, Joint Commissioner
(Housing-Self Financing Scheme) M.S.Sharma and
also Usha Ravichandran, P.S. to the Commissioner
(Personnel). Last week Usha Ravichandran was
secretly reinstated. But for the time being she has
proceeded on leave after taking charge.
Her
reinstatement has become a topic of discussion
amongst the D.D.A. Officials. It is said that even
after her suspension, Smt. Ravinchandran used to
visit D.D.A's Head Office. She continued to visit the
Authority's Head Office every after two/three days
and she often used to sit in the room of the
Commissioner (Personnel).
Her visits to Vikas
Sadan even after suspension are also confirmed
from her car number entered in the register of
Page Nos.7 of 36

Security Guards. It is also a hot topic of discussion
amongst the officials that Arvind Kumar,
Commissioner (Personnel) has played a key role in
the reinstatement of Smt. Chandran. The sources
of the Authority, while raising fingers at her
reinstatement, state that last year in the months of
June-July an examination for promotion from L.D.Cs
to the posts of U.D.Cs was held. The right of
checking the said examination-papers was of the
Director (Nazarat) Mr. Jha. But Usha Ravichandran
was given authority by the Director to check the
copies related to the exam, which was out of her
power. C.B.I. during the raids had also seized the
said copies and when the marks made thereon
were got examined by Hand-Writing Expert, it
became clear from the said examination report that
the said marks were given by Smt. Ravichandran.
Sources say that during the checking of copies of
the said exam, lot of irregularities were made in
which sixty L.D.Cs were promoted as U.D.Cs. It is a
topic of discussion that when an enquiry is under
process then what is the justification of her
reinstatement?
It is more specific that her
reinstatement has been made by Member
(Finance) Laxman Rao, after clearance given by
Joint Director (Vigilance) D.D.A, which is totally
illegal. Whereas the right to give clearance is only
vest with the Chief Vigilance Officer. Besides that,
C.B.I., while raiding the Sheikh Sarai flat of Smt.
Chandran, had made an adverse report regarding
unauthorizedly constructed room on the roof-top
and as well as the photographs thereof were taken.
When the said matter is also still under enquiry,
then what is the justification of reinstatement? Not
only the C.B.I has also seized those documents, by
which 32 Work Assistants (Electricity Division) were
directly promoted as Junior Engineers. The sources
disclose that the said matter is also under
investigation.
Well, whatever may be the result, but by the
reinstatement of Usha Ravichandran, other
suspended employees are very much hopeful.
They now feel that they will also be reinstated
soon. For that some officers had been visiting
Vikas Sadan from the very beginning. Amongst
Page Nos.8 of 36

whom is also Assistant Director M.S.Ahuja. His
visits are confirmed from the register of the
Security personnel of D.D.A., wherein the number
of the vehicle is entered. However, from the said
action of reinstatement, the employees of D.D.A
have now started admitting that the enquiry of
Housing Allotment Scandal will surely be effected.”
8.

Alleging that the afore-noted news items are defamatory

and

had

directly

or indirectly

harmed and injured

her

reputation, Smt. Usha Ravichandran, chief protagonist of said
news items filed three complaints under Sections 499 and 500
of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
9.

Pertaining to news item published in the ‘Hindustan

By way of above captioned petitions, the petitioners

14. Principal contention advanced by the petitioners is that
the said news items are neither defamatory nor have been
made with reckless disregard for the truth. Counsel for the
petitioners contended that true facts have been reported in the
news items in question. It was further contended that it is the
duty of a newspaper to expose corruption and bring to the
notice of the general public the manner in which a public body
is conducting its affairs.
15.

Per

contra,

learned

counsel

for

the

complainant

contended that the said news items are per se defamatory.
Page Nos.10 of 36

Whether or not they contain true facts or were published in
public interest is a matter of defence. That it is settled law that
courts cannot consider defence of a party at the stage of
quashing. Counsel relied upon following judgments in support
of his argument: (i)

Shatrughna Prasad Sinha v Rajbhau Surajmal Rathi & Ors,

(1996) 6 SCC 263.
(ii)

Sewakram Sobhani v R.K. Karanjiya, AIR 1981 SC 1514.

(iii)

Sardar Nihal Singh v Arjan Das, 1983 CrLJ 777.

16.

Every individual has a right to protect his reputation.

Disparaging and defamatory statements made about a person
to a third person or persons without lawful justification or
excuse are actionable in law. As observed by the Supreme
Court in the decision reported as State of Bihar v Lal Krishna
Advani, AIR 2003 SC 3357 reputation is an integral and
important aspect of dignity of every individual. The right to
preservation of one's reputation is acknowledged as a right in
rem, a right good against all the world.
17.

But freedom of speech and expression are the foundation

of all democratic organisations. Freedom of expression stems
from the requirement that members of a democratic should be
sufficiently informed. In the decision reported as Attorney
General v Times Newspaper Ltd., (1973) 3 All ER 54, it was

Page Nos.11 of 36

observed that freedom of expression has following four broad
social purposes to serve:(i)

It helps an individual to attain self fulfillment.

(ii)

It assists in the discovery of truth.

(iii)

It

strengthens

the

capacity

of

an

individual

in

participating in decision making.
(iv)

It provides a mechanism by which it would be possible to

establish a reasonable balance between stability and social
change.
18.

The right of the print media to publish news pertaining to

matters of public concern is recognized as an integral part of
freedom of expression. (See decisions of the Supreme Court in
Virender v State of Punjab AIR 1958 SC 986 and Sakal Papers v
Union of India AIR 1962 SC 305.
19.

The fundamental objective of journalism is to serve the

people with news, views, comments and information on matter
of public interest in a fair, accurate, unbiased, sober and
decent manner. It is the legitimate function of a newspaper in a
democratic set up to act as the champion of a clean
administration and sentinel of public interest, and as such a
newspaper is within its right to expose and bring to the notice
of the general public any lapse or malpractice in the working of
a public authority including acts of nepotism and favoritism.

Page Nos.12 of 36

20.

The law of defamation is a culmination of a conflict

between society and the individual. On one hand lies the
fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression
enshrined under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India, on
the other is the right of individual to have his reputation intact.
How far does the liberty of free speech and expression extend?
And when does it become necessary for the law to step in to
safeguard the right of the individual to preserve his honour.
The law of defamation seeks to attain a balance between these
two competing freedoms.
21.

The classical definition of 'defamation' has been given by

Justice Cave in the case of Scott v Sampson, (1882) Q.B.D. 491,
as a “false statement about a man to his discredit”.
22.

In the book The Law of Defamation, by Richard O'Sullivan,

QC and Ronald Brown, 'defamation' is defined as a false
statement of which the tendency is to disparage the good
name or reputation of another person.
23.

As per Section 499, Indian Penal Code, offence of

defamation consists of three essential ingredients namely:(i)

Making or publishing any imputation concerning any

person.
(ii)

Such imputation must have been made by words either

written or spoken or by visible representation.

Page Nos.13 of 36

(iii)

Such imputation must be made with the intention to

cause harm or with the knowledge or having reasons to believe
that it will harm the reputation of the person concerned.
24.

In the light of above discussion, it has to been seen

whether news items in question are defamatory or a fair report
pertaining to the affairs of DDA, a statutory body charged with
the planned development of Delhi.
25.

Before proceeding to analyse the news items in question,

I quote the well-known passage of Lord Shaw in the decision
reported as Arnold v King Emperor LR (1913-14) 41 Ind. App.
149.

26.

“The freedom of the journalist is an ordinary part
of the freedom of subject, and to whatever
lengths the subject in general may go, so also
may the journalist, but, apart from statute law,
his privilege is no other and no higher. The
responsibilities which attach to this power in the
dissemination of printed matter may, and in the
case of a conscientious journalist do, make him
more careful; but the range of his assertions, his
criticisms, or his comments, is as wide as, and no
wider than, that of any other subject. No privilege
attaches to his position.”
Pertaining to news item published in 'Navbharat Times',

relevant allegations in the complaint are as follows:“7. That the Accused No. 1 to 3 caused a news
item in “NavBharat Times” New Delhi Edition
dated 4th May 2001, making false allegations that
the complainant was involved in illegal
allotments of DDA Flats and misappropriated
several crores of rupees. It is submitted that the
complainant had not worked in the Housing
Department of DDA and, therefore, the
Page Nos.14 of 36

allegations that she was connected with housing
scam is totally false, malicious and defamatory.
Copy of the said publication is annexed hereto
and marked as ANNEXURE-D to this complaint.
8.
That the accused No 1 to 3 made
allegations in the news item, which is publicly
circulated in the city and other parts of the
country stating that the on the raid conducted by
CBI officers on the complainant a huge amount of
cash, documents relating to various investments
and documents relating to DDA houses were
recovered.”
27.

News item published in ‘Navbharat Times’ centers around

the facts that complainant was an accused in a housing scam
being investigated by CBI. That a search was conducted at her
office and her residential premises. That she along with 7
others employees were suspended. That she was the only
suspended employee who was reinstated and that CBI had not
given her a clean chit at the time of her reinstatement.
28.

All these facts are a matter of record. What is reported in

the said news item is statement of true facts. It is a fair and
objective report of correct facts. There are no insuinations and
innuendo.
29.

In the complaint, complainant has stated that news item

has falsely alleged that she was involved in the illegal
allotments of DDA flats and misappropriated several crores of
rupees, that she was working in Housing Department of DDA

Page Nos.15 of 36

and that in the raid conducted by CBI officials huge amount of
cash, documents etc were found in her house.
30.

The said news item does not report that complainant was

involved

in

the

housing

scam.

It

merely

reports

that

complainant is accused of being involved in the scam, which is
a true fact. The news item also does not report that cash,
incriminating documents were found from complainant's house.
The said news item reports that a raid was conducted by CBI at
official as well as residential premises of various DDA
employees including complainant and that huge amount of
cash and documents were recovered in the raids. It is a fact
that a raid was conducted at the complainant's house and
certain articles were seized by the CBI. The news item does not
single out complainant. Complainant is trying to twist the said
news item.
31.

Thus, news item published in ‘Navbharat Times’ does not

contain

any defamatory

imputations.

It

merely

contains

statement of true facts and is published in public interest.
32.

The Supreme Court in the decision reported as State of

Haryana v Bhajan Lal and Ors, AIR 1992 SC 604 considered in
detail the ambit and scope of Section 482 of the High Court to
quash the investigation/FIR/complaints. The decision lays down

Page Nos.16 of 36

following 7 circumstances in which such a power could be
exercised; “1. Where the allegations made in the First
Information Report or the complaint, even if
they are taken at their face value and
accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case
against the accused.
2. Where the allegations in the First
Information Report and other materials, if
any, accompanying the F.I.R. do not
disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an
investigation by police officers under
Section 156 of the Code except under an
order of a Magistrate within the purview of
Section 155(2) of the Code.
3. Where the uncontroverted allegations
made in the F.I.R. or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same
do not disclose the commission of any
offence and make out a case against the
accused.
4. Where, the allegations in the F.I.R. do
not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non cognizable offence, no
investigation is permitted by a police officer
without an order of a Magistrate as
contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Code.
5. Where the allegations made in the F.I.R.
or complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no
prudent person can ever reach a just
conclusion that there is sufficient ground
for proceeding against the accused.
6. Where there is an express legal bar
engrafted in any of the provisions of the
Code or the concerned Act (under which a
criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
Page Nos.17 of 36

institution
and
continuance
of
the
proceedings and/or where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the
grievance of the aggrieved party.

33.

7. Where a criminal proceeding is
manifestly attended with malafide and/or
where the proceeding is maliciously
instituted with an ulterior motive for
wreaking vengeance on the accused and
with a view to spite him due to private and
personal grudge."
Petition pertaining to news item in ‘Navbharat Times’

clearly falls in the category 1 and 3 enumerated in Bhajan Lal’s
case (supra).
34.

Insofar as news item published in ‘Hindustan Times’

is

concerned, allegations in the complaint reads as follows:“9. That the said publication made by Accused
No.1 to 3 with regard to the news item that there
was evidence against the complainant that she
was apparently a conduit for receiving payments
for making favorable transfer and posting is
totally wrong, derogatory and without any basis.
The Accused No. 1 to 3 by making such false and
frivolous publication directly attributed the
allegations against the complainant that she was
involved in the corrupt practices, which is perse
defamatory and such imputation against her
caused damage to her reputation, integrity,
honesty and sincerity towards her official duty.
The said publication has been made maliciously
with an intention to cause damage to the
reputation of the complainant and with a view to
lower down her reputation in the society, official
circles and amongst the friends and relations.
10. That the Accused No. 1 to 3 further
published the false news item that one of the
Accused Sh. M.L. Ahuja, Assistant Director, Staff
Welfare, confessed to the investigating officials
Page Nos.18 of 36

that he made regular payments to the
complainant for transfer and posting, which is
totally false and malicious........

35.

11. That Accused No. 1 to 3 had made further
publication, that the complainant was reinstated
as she was allegedly close to Commissioner
(Personnel) is unfounded and perse defamatory.
The suspension of the complainant was revoked
on the basis of facts and circumstances of the
case on merits by the Competent Authority as per
rules of services. Such publication damages the
reputation of the character of the complainant
being a lady employee.”
The focal point of the news item published in 'Hindustan

Times' is also the fact that the complainant was the only
suspended employee who was reinstated. However, the said
news item does contains certain imputations which on a prima
facie reading appear to be defamatory. (Imputations which
appears to be defamatory have been underlined in para 6
above.) As is evident from allegations in the complaint noted in
para 34 above, complainant has placed stress on the specific
part of the news item which are per se defamatory.
36.

Pertaining to news item published in ‘Hindustan Times’

petitioners sought to justify said imputations by relying upon a
report stated to be filed by CBI. Said report is dated 30.11.2000
and is annexed as Annexure-E of the petition.
37.

However, complainant questions the veracity of the

report relied upon by the petitioners. In her reply to the present

Page Nos.19 of 36

petition complainant has submitted that said report is a
fabricated document.
38.

In the decision reported as Sewakram Sobhani v R.K.

Karanjia, Chief Editor, Weekly Blitz & Ors AIR 1981 SC 1514,
Supreme Court considered a complaint filed by the appellant
against respondents for an offence under Section 500, IPC for
publication

of

an

news

item which

allegedly

contained

imputations which were per se defamatory. Holding that news
item in question was based upon an enquiry report, the High
Court had quashed the complaint.

The High Court had

observed that respondent's case “clearly falls within the ambit
exception 9 of Section 499 of IPC” and that “it would be abuse
of the process of the court if the trial is allowed to proceed
which ultimately would turn out to be a vexatious proceeding.”
The reasoning advanced by the High Court was as follows:“The real question to ask is, did the applicants
publish the report for public good, in public
interest and in good faith? My answer is in the
affirmative. It was a publication of a report for the
welfare of the society. A public institution like
prison had to be maintained in rigid discipline;
the rules did not permit mixing of male prisoners
with female prisoners and yet the report said the
prison authorities connived at such a thing, a
matter which was bound to arouse resentment
and condemnation. The balance of public benefit
lay in its publicity rather than in hushing up the
whole episode.
Further,
there
was
good
faith in the

Page Nos.20 of 36

publication. The source on which the publishers
acted was the proper source on which they were
entitled to act and they did so with care and
circumspection. The report further shows that the
publication had been honestly made in the belief
of its truth and also upon reasonable ground for
such a belief, after the exercise of such means to
verify its truth as would be taken by a man of
ordinary prudence under like circumstances.”
39.

Reversing the decision of the High Court, the Supreme

Court observed as follows:“8. We have considerable doubt about the
propriety of the High Court making use of the
Enquiry Report which has no evidentiary value
and in respect of which the Government claimed
privilege. The application made by the
Government claiming privilege still awaited
consideration. While the Government claimed
privilege at one stage, it appears to have waived
the claim and produced the Enquiry Report and
made the contents public. There was no factual
basis for the observations made by the High
Court underlined by me, except the Enquiry
Report. The contents of the Enquiry Report
cannot be made use of unless the facts are
proved by evidence aliunde. There is also nothing
on record to show that the accused persons made
any enquiry of their own into the truth or other
wise of the allegations or exercised due care and
caution for bringing the case under the Ninth
Exception. The Enquiry Report cannot by itself fill
in the lacunae.
9. A bare perusal of the offending article in Blitz
shows that it is per se defamatory. There can be
no doubt that the imputation made would lower
the appellant in the estimation of others. It
suggested that he was a man devoid of character
and gave vent to his unbridled passion. It is
equally defamatory of Smt. Shukla in that she
was alleged to be a lady of easy virtue. We need
not dilate on the matter any further. It is for the
accused to plead Ninth Exception in defence and
Page Nos.21 of 36

40.

discharge the burden to prove good faith which
implies the exercise of due care and caution and
to show that the attack on the character of the
appellant was for the public good.”
Petitioners have not filed any document to show that the

alleged status report in question emanated from CBI.

It's

authenticity has to be proved by leading evidence.
41.

In view of decision of the Supreme Court in Sewakram

Sobhani's case (supra), no ground is made out for quashing the
complaint pertaining to the news item published in 'Hindustan
Times' on the basis that the news item is a true and faithful
report of a fact.
42.

Pertaining to news item published in 'Dainik Jagran',

relevant allegations reads as follows:“7. That on the report of Accused No.3, a news
item was published in the 'Dainik Jagran', New
Delhi Edition, dated 25.06.2001, that the
complainant was involved in a housing scam
(while the complainant has never worked in
housing department) and that the revocation of
her suspension encouraged the other DDA
employees to indulge in corruption. It is further
alleged in the publication that Mr. Arvind
Kumar,Commissioner (Personnel) played the
main role in reinstatement of complainant. It is
further alleged in the said publication that the
complainant was given the answer sheet by the
Director (nazarat) and gave marks, which was
proved by handwriting experts. It is further
alleged in the said publication that the
complainant
was
reinstated
by
Joint
Director(Vigilance). It is further alleged that
documents were seized by CBI regarding the
promotion of 32 Works Assistants (Electrical
Department) directly to the post of Junior
Engineer.
Page Nos.22 of 36

43.

According to the complainant, said news item contains

following 4 defamatory imputations:(i)

That complainant was involved in the housing scam.

(ii)

That Commissioner (Personnel) played a key role in the

reinstatement of complainant.
(iii)

That complainant checked certain examination papers

which was outside the scope of her powers.
(iv)

That complainant was wrongly reinstated.

44.

The said news item does not report that the complainant

is involved in the housing scam. It merely reports that the
complainant is accused of being involved in the housing scam
which is a true fact. Further, the mere statement that the
Commissioner

(Personnel)

reinstatement

of

the

played

a

key

complainant

is

not

role
a

in

the

defamatory

statement.
45.

It is relevant to note that defamation can be caused by

following two ways:(i)

By direct imputation.

(ii)

By way of innuendo.

46.

Innuendo are those expressions which are not actionable

on their face, but which become so by the reason of the
peculiar situation or occasion upon which the words are written

Page Nos.23 of 36

or spoken. In simple words, innuendo means an indirect
accusation.
47.

News item published in 'Dainik Jagran' reports that the

complainant

checked

certain

examination

papers;

that

checking of said papers by the complainant was outside her
powers; that investigations revealed that there were lot of
irregularities in the checking of said papers; that the matter is
under investigation.
48.

This part of the said news item is an innuendo as it is

suggestive of the fact that complainant is a corrupt and
dishonest lady.
49.

Pertaining to news item published in ' The Dainik Jagran'

petitioners have not disclosed the source/basis of alleged
defamatory imputations. In their petition, it is merely stated
that said news item is based upon true facts.
50.

Matter pertaining to news item published in 'Dainik

Jagran' thus require a trial in as much as persons responsible
for publication of said news items will have to establish that
news item in question was based upon true facts.
51.

The next question which needs to be answered is

whether

any

criminal

liability

can

be

fastened

on

the

petitioners or in other words whether the petitioners are the
persons responsible for publication of said news items.

In Crl. M.C No.35/05, petitioner no.1, Ms. Shobhna

Bhartiya is the Managing Director, HT Media Ltd, petitioner
no.2, Mr. Vir Sanghvi is the Chief Editor, HT Media Ltd and
petitioner no.3, Ms. P. Aruna Sharma is the reporter who wrote
the news item published in 'Hindustan Times'. In Crl. M.C.
No.350/05, petitioner, Mr. Vineet Jain is the Managing Director,
Benett Coleman & Co. In Crl. M.C. No.2188/05, petitioner, Mr.
Ram Kirpal Singh is the editor of Navbharat Times. In Crl. M.C.
No.3898-99/05, petitioner no.1, Mr Sanjay Gupta is the Chief
Editor of Dainik Jagran and petitioner no.2, Mr. Naveen Gautam
is the reporter who wrote the news item published in 'Dainik
Jagran'. This is precisely how petitioners have been described
by the complainant in the complaints.
53.

Primarily, a reporter is responsible for his act of

defamation. Then, vicarious liability is fastened on the printer,
publisher and editor of the newspaper under the Press and
Registration of Books Act, 1967.
54.

Section 1(1) of the Press and Registration Act, 1867

defines ‘Editor’ as a person who controls the selection of the
matter that is published in a newspaper. Section 3 stipulates
that every book or paper shall legibly print on it the place of
printing; the name of the printer and the name of the publisher.
Section 5 stipulates that every printer and

publisher of a

Page Nos.25 of 36

newspaper shall make a statutory declaration before a
competent Magistrate in the prescribed form. Section 6
stipulates regarding authentication of a declaration made
under Section 5. Lastly, Section 7 stipulates as under:“7. Office copy of declaration to be prima facie
evidence -- In any legal proceeding whatever, as
well civil as criminal, the production of a copy of
such declaration as is aforesaid, attested by the
seal of some Court empowered by this Act to
have the custody of such declaration, or, in the
case of the editor, a copy of the newspaper
containing his name printed on it as that of the
editor shall be held (unless the contrary be
proved) to be sufficient evidence, as against the
person whose name shall be subscribed to such
declaration, or printed on such newspaper as the
case may be, that the said person was printer or
publisher, or printer and publisher (according as
the words of the said declaration may be) of
every portion of every newspaper whereof the
title shall correspond with the title of the
newspaper mentioned in the declaration or the
editor of every portion of that issue of the
newspaper of which a copy is produced.”
55.

In view of provisions of Press and Registration Act, 1867,

particularly Section 7 unless the contrary is proved, the persons
declared as printer, publisher and editor of the newspaper are
presumed to be responsible for the contents of the newspaper.
56.

Whether any person other than the Printer, Publisher and

Editor can be prosecuted for a defamatory article?
57.

In context of afore-noted question, it is relevant to note

the following judicial pronouncements.

Page Nos.26 of 36

(i)

State of Maharashtra v R.B. Chowdhari, AIR 1968 SC 110:-

The public prosecutor filed a complaint under Section 500 IPC
against four persons who were members of the Editorial Board
of a Marathi weekly named “Maharashtra”. One of the accused,
Sudhakar Gopal Madane, had filed the declaration in the
prescribed form under the Act describing himself as the editor,
printer and publisher of the newspaper. The particular copy of
the Maharashtra in which the alleged defamatory article
appeared bore the name of one Madane as the printer,
publisher and editor of the newspaper. It also showed on the
front page that the Editorial Board consisted of Madane and
three other accused. The question arose whether the members
of Editorial Board could be prosecuted for defamatory article.
Adverting to Section 7, the Supreme Court held that:“7.
The term 'editor' is defined in the Act to
mean a person who controls the selection of the
matter that is published in a newspaper. Where
there is mentioned an editor is a person who is
responsible for selection of the material. Section
7 raises the presumption in respect of such a
person. The name of that person has to be
printed on the copy of the newspaper and in the
present case the name of Madane admittedly
was printed as the Editor of the Maharashtra in
the copy of the Maharashtra which contained the
defamatory article. The declaration in Form I
which has been produced before us shows the
name of Madane not only as the printer and
publisher but also as the editor. In our opinion
the presumption will attach to Madane as having
selected the material for publication in the
newspaper. It may not be out of place to note
Page Nos.27 of 36

that Madane admitted that he had written this
article. In the circumstances not only the
presumption cannot be drawn against the others
who had not declared themselves as editors of
the newspaper but it is also fair to leave them
out because they had no concern with the
publishing of the article in question. On the
whole therefore the order of discharge made by
the learned single Judge appears to be proper in
the circumstances of the case and we see no
reason to interfere.”
(ii)

T.K.S.Muthukoya v Haji C.H. Mohammad Koya, (1979) 2

SCC 8: - Question before Supreme Court was whether the Chief
Editor of a newspaper can be prosecuted for publication of a
defamatory article. In para 34 of the decision, Supreme Court
observed as under:“34. From the facts established above, it is
manifest that the petitioner has miserably failed
to prove either that the appellant was the editor
of the paper or that he was performing the
functions,
duties
or
shouldering
the
responsibilities of the editor. It is obvious that a
presumption under Section 7 of the Press Act
could be drawn only if the person concerned was
an editor within the meaning of Section 1 of the
Press Act. Where however a person does not fulfil
the conditions of Section 1 of the Press Act and
does not perform the functions of an editor
whatever may be his description or designation,
the provisions of the Press Act would have no
application.............”
(iii)

K.M. Mathew v State of Kerela & Anr., 1992 CriLJ 3779:- In

relation to prosecution of Chief Editor of a newspaper for
publication of a defamatory news article, Supreme Court
observed as under:-

Page Nos.28 of 36

“9. In the instant case there is no averment
against the Chief Editor except the motive
attributed to him. Even the motive alleged is
general and vague. The complainant seems to
rely upon the presumption under Section 7 of the
Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867 ('the
Act'). But Section 7 of the Act has no applicability
for a person who is simply named as 'Chief
Editor'. The presumption under Section 7 is only
against the person whose name is printed as
'editor' as required under Section 5(1). There is a
mandatory (though rebuttable) presumption that
the person whose name is printed as 'Editor' is
the editor of every portion of that issue of the
newspaper of which a copy is produced. Section
1(1) of the Act defines 'Editor' to mean 'the
person who controls the selection of the matter
that is published in a newspaper'. Section 7
raises the presumption in respect of a person
who is named as the editor and printed as such
on every copy of the newspaper. The Act does
not recognise any other legal entity for raising
the presumption. Even if the name of the Chief
Editor is printed in the newspaper, there is no
presumption against him under Section 7 of the
Act. See State of Maharashtra v R.B. Chowdhari,
AIR 1968 SC 110; D.P. Mishra v Kamal Narain
Sharma & Ors, AIR 1970 SC 856; Narasingh
Charan Mohanty v Surendra Mohanty, AIR 1974
SC 47; Haji C.H. Mohammad Koya v T.K.S.M.A.
Muthukoya, AIR 1979 SC 154.
10. It is important to state that for a Magistrate
to take cognizance of the offence as against the
Chief Editor, there must be positive averments in
the complaint of knowledge of the objectionable
character of the matter. The complaint in the
instant case does not contain any such
allegation. In the absence of such allegation, the
Magistrate was justified in directing that the
complaint so far as it relates to the Chief Editor
could not be proceeded with. To ask the Chief
Editor to undergo the trial of the case merely on
the ground of the issue of process would be
oppressive. No person should be tried without a
prima facie case. The view taken by the High
Page Nos.29 of 36

Court is untenable. The appeal is accordingly
allowed. The order of the High Court is set
aside.”
(iv)

Sardar Nihal Singh v Arjan Das, 1983 CrLJ 777:- A learned

Single Judge of this court was considering whether the
Chairman and Executive Editor of a newspaper could be
prosecuted for publication of a defamatory article. With
reference to Chairman, it was observed as under:"Needless to say that as Chairman of the
Company Shri Goenka can be held liable for the
publication of the offending news items only if it
is shown that he was somehow concerned with
the publication of the defamatory news items. It
is highly doubtful that he can be asked to answer
the charge of defamation merely because he
happened to be the Chairman of the Company
owning the newspaper without there being any
further evidence as regards his participation in
the actual management and administration of
the affairs of the company. Intention on the part
of the accused to harm the reputation or the
knowledge or reasonable belief that an
imputation will harm the reputation of the
persons concerned is an essential ingredient of
offence under S. 400, IPC but such evidence is
totally missing in the instant case. Under the
circumstances the impugned order as regards
Shri Goenka cannot be sustained on this short
ground."
After referring to Section 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Press and
Registration of Books Act, 1867, the learned Judge added:“However, it is difficult to draw such a
presumption in the case of other petitioners viz.,
Arun Shorie, petitioner No. 2 and A. P. Dhar
petitioner No. 4. Their names do not find place in
the declaration printed on the newspaper itself
and there is no iota of evidence to show that they
Page Nos.30 of 36

are in any manner concerned with the collection,
control or selection of the matter printed in the
newspaper. Their designations as Executive
Editor/Editor of the Express News Service will not
per se warrant an inference that they are in any
way responsible for the selection of the material.
An authority for this view may be found in the
State of Maharashtra v. R. B. Chowdhari, AIR
1968 SC 110.”
(v)

Sardar Bhagat Singh Akali v Lachman Singh, AIR

1968 SC 269:- Calcutta High Court was considering the extent
of

the

liability

of the owner for defamatory statements

published in the paper owned by him. In para 5 of the decision,
it was observed as under:"The owner in order to be liable under S. 499 of
the Code has to have direct responsibility for the
publication of the defamatory statement and he
must also have the intention to harm or
knowledge or reason to believe that the
imputation will harm the reputation of the person
concerned. The owner of a journal has thus no
responsibility under the section. The editor of the
paper, even though he might not be directly
responsible
for
a
defamatory
statement
published in his paper attract the responsibility
by virtue of S. 7 of the Press and Registration of
Books Act by virtue of his registration as editor
under the Act which registration is sufficient
evidence that he was also the printer or publisher
of the paper concerned. The printer and publisher
by virtue of their duties as such cannot of course
avoid, the legal liability for defamation. The
owner's liability will be attracted provided it can
be shown that he was responsible for the
publication
with
the
necessary
interest,
knowledge or reasonable belief in the matter."
58.

From the afore-noted judicial pronouncements, legal

position which emerges is as follows:Page Nos.31 of 36

(i)

Besides persons declared as editor, printer and

publisher

of

a

newspaper,

only

such

person

could

be

prosecuted for an action of defamation against whom specific
and clear allegations has been made in the complaint that
either he was responsible for selection of the defamatory
matter or had personal knowledge about the contents of the
defamatory matter. In addition, it must also be averred in the
complaint that such person had the intention to harm or
knowledge or reason to believe that the imputation will harm
the reputation of the complainant.
(ii)

The Chairman or the Managing Director of the

company owning a newspaper is neither the editor, nor the
printer nor the publisher and therefore no presumption could
be drawn against holder of these offices even though they are,
by reason of the offices held by them, incharge of, and
responsible to, the company for the conduct of its business.
59.

Vis-à-vis petitioner nos.1 and 2 in Crl.M.C.No.35/2005,

petitioner in Crl.M.C.No.350/2005
Crl.M.C.No.3898-99/2005,

and petitioner No.1 in

the complaints filed against them

does not contain any such averments. General and vague has
been made against these petitioners.
60.

It is relevant to note following observations of the

Supreme

Court

in

the

decision

reported

as

Page Nos.32 of 36

S.M.S.Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. Neeta Bhalla & Anr. 2005 (7)
SCALE 397 :“.......The normal rule in the cases involving
criminal liability is against vicarious liability, that
is, no one is to be held criminally liable for an act
of another. This normal rule is, however, subject
to exception on account of specific provision
being made in statutes extending liability to
others. Section 141 of the Act is an instance of
specific provision which in case an offence under
Section 138 is committed by a Company, extends
criminal liability for dishonour of cheque to
officers of the Company. Section 141 contains
conditions which have to be satisfied before the
liability can be extended to officers of a company.
Since the provision creates criminal liability, the
conditions have to be strictly complied with. The
conditions are intended to ensure that a person
who is sought to be made vicariously liable for an
offence of which the principal accused is the
Company, had a role to play in relation to the
incriminating act and further that such a person
should know what is attributed to him to make
him liable. In other words, persons who had
nothing to do with the matter need not be roped
in.......”
61.

Even otherwise, under the Indian Penal Code, no person

can be prosecuted and punished for an offence committed by
other person except in following 4 situations:(i)

When a criminal act is done by several persons in

furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such
persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were
done by him alone.(Section 34, IPC)

Page Nos.33 of 36

(ii)

When a person abets commission of an offence, he who

abets is liable for the offence committed in pursuance of
abetment. (Section 107, IPC)
(iii)

When an offence is committed in pursuance of a criminal

conspiracy, all conspirators are liable for the offence committed
(Section 120-B, IPC)
(iv)

When an offence is committed by a member of an

unlawful assembly in furtherance of common object of
assembly, all persons who were members of such assembly at
the time of the commission of the offence are liable for the
offence committed. (Section 149,IPC)
62.

In the instant case, there is no averment that said news

item was written and published at the instance of and in
furtherance of common intention of all the petitioners. The
averments in the complaints also do not make a case of
abetment or conspiracy.
63.

In the absence of necessary averments in the complaint

against these petitioners, learned Magistrate was not justified
in issuing summoning order against them.
64.

Petitioner no. 3 in Crl.M.C.No.35/2005 and petitioner No.2

in Crl.M.C.No.3898-99/2005 are the reporters of the alleged
defamatory news items and therefore will have to face the trial.
