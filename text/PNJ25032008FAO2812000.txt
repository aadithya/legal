1.

Having failed to obtain a favourable order from the

learned Additional District Judge, the appellant is retesting it's
luck in the instant appeal which challenges the order dated
21.2.2000 dismissing appellant's objections to the award dated
28.1.1997.
2.

As reproduced in para 1 of the impugned order

dated 21.2.2000, the objections to the award was on the
following grounds:“1.

The Arbitrator had failed to give the reasons

FAO No.281/2000

Page 1 of 16

and therefore award is liable to be remitted/set
aside.
2.

The Arbitrator had exceeded the jurisdiction.

3.
The Arbitrator had failed to decide the issues
and the questions which have arisen in the subject
matter.
4.

The award is based on no evidence.

5.

The Arbitrator had exceeded the reference.

6.

The award is made after statutory period.

7.
There is error apparent on the face of the
award.
8.
There is violation of rules of natural justice by
the Arbitrator by not affording the proper opportunity
to the party.
9.
3.

The award is otherwise invalid.”
The relevant part of the order dated 21.2.2000

containing the reasons is as under:4.
Union of India referred the matter to the
Arbitrator because the contractor/objector had
failed to fulfill the contract of supply of the roofs
and Union of India made risk purchase at the risk
and cost of the contractor. The dispute referred to
the Arbitrator was to allow the claim of Union of
India for sum of Rs.2,35,086/- which was the
difference between contract price and the price at
which Union of India had to purchase the material
after the determination of the contract because of
non-fulfilment of contract by the objector. The
other claim made by Union of India was about
interest over this amount.
Respondent made
counter claim, claiming damages to the tune of
Rs.3,00,000/-. He also made counter claim of
Rs.34,594/- as refund of security and his third
counter claim was of Rs.5,000/- as balance price of
FAO No.281/2000

Page 2 of 16

store and fourth counter claim was about 18%
interest on withheld amount of security calculated
upto date of 31.03.92 amounting to Rs.30,000/-.
5.
The Arbitrator considered each claim made
by Union of India as well as by the objector and
gave his reasons.
He referred to the various
letters and documents while considering the claim
of the parties and upheld the first claim of Union of
India about the difference in the risk purchase
price and the contract price amount to
Rs.2,35,086/-. He rejected the claim No.2, i.e.,
about interest. He disallowed counter claim No.1
of the respondent/objector but allowed counter
claim No.2 and 3. He disallowed counter claim
No.4 and 5. The Arbitrator has given his Award on
the basis of the documents and the evidence
placed before him. The counsel for objector has
contended that the Arbitrator has not given
appropriate reasons for allowing the claim of Union
of India and disallowing the claim of respondent.
He relied upon 1992(1) Arb. LR PAGE 327 BHARAT
FURNISHING CO. VS. DDA and another stating that
the reasons given by the Arbitrator were no
reasons in the eyes of law. I consider that the
Arbitrator in this case has not acted whimsically as
alleged by the objector.
The Arbitrator has
referred to the contract executed between the
parties, various extension letters and the failure of
defendant to prove that there was scarcity of raw
heavily on the Arbitrator was that the risk purchase
order
was
executed
immediately
by
the
subsequent contractor who supplied the entire
quantity within prescribed time. The Arbitrator
disbelieved
the
contention
of
the
objector/respondent about non-availability of raw
material and came to conclusion that the raw
material was available, may be it was at higher
cost. The Arbitrator disallowed interest to the
Union of India as well as to the respondent. I find
no infirmity in the Award. The Award is made ruleof-the-court.”
4.

It is apparent that the laconic objections, being

FAO No.281/2000

Page 3 of 16

worthy of no credence, were not pressed and the issue was
urged on wholly different grounds.

Indeed, at the hearing

before me, only 2 grounds were urged to challenge the award.
5.

Firstly that the learned arbitrator has violated the

principles of natural justice by calling for the departmental file
behind the back of the appellant and secondly by ignoring that
force majeure conditions entitled the appellant to further
extension of time to fulfill the contract and by not extending
the time and revoking the contract the respondent acted
illegally.
6.

In brief, relevant facts are that on 30.6.1983 when

an advance tender acceptance was issued to the appellant by
the respondent a contract concluded between the parties
requiring the appellant to supply 120 sets of Roof Trough to
COD Agra @ Rs.3,697/- per set i.e. at a total fixed price of
Rs.4,43,640/-. The supply had to be completed by 30.11.1983.
A sample had to be got approved before effecting the supply.
Rs.22,185/- had to be deposited towards security deposit. Vide
Clause 19(h) of the contract it was stipulated that time was of
the essence of the contract. Clause 14 stipulated that if there
was a breach of the contract the respondent would be entitled
to risk purchase within 6 months from the date of cancellation
of the contract.
FAO No.281/2000

Page 4 of 16

7.

The appellant secured the sum of Rs.22,185/- by

means of a bank guarantee.

However it failed to offer any

sample for approval within the time prescribed under the
contract. Much after the scheduled date of completion of the
contract i.e. 30.11.1983, a sample was offered for inspection.
The respondent extended the time for completing the contract
till 31.5.1984 and also approved the sample on 27.2.1984.
Vide letter dated 24.5.1984 the appellant desired further
extension of time to effect delivery which was extended by the
respondent till 30.9.1984. This was conveyed to the appellant
vide respondent's letter dated 6.6.1984.

Since the contract

permitted the respondent to increase the contracted quantity,
vide letter dated 12.6.1984, the respondent intimated the
appellant that supply quantity was increased from 120 pieces
to 150 pieces at the same rate. Thus, value of the contract
stood enhanced to Rs.5,54,550/-. Likewise the security deposit
amount got enhanced to Rs.27,730/-.
8.

The appellant did not furnish the enhanced security

deposit and on 10.12.1984 sought further extension of time to
effect delivery. Vide letter dated 22.12.1984 the respondent
extended the time for delivery up to 28.2.1985. At the request
of the appellant the time for delivery was further extended up
to 31.5.1985.
FAO No.281/2000

9.

In June 1985, 24 sets of Roof Trough were supplied.

10.

The appellant expressed inability to effect further

supply stating that the iron/steel to be used as a raw material
was manufactured only by 1 company i.e. Steel Authority of
India Limited (SAIL) and desired that respondent should issue
an essentiality certificate to the appellant as this would
facilitate supply of raw material by SAIL. Thus, at the request
of the appellant, the respondent issued a letter dated
24.10.1985 informing as under:“M/s. Rajendra Nath Kundu & Sons,

referred to arbitration.

The respondent raised a claim of Rs.2,35,086/-

towards loss suffered. Interest @ 18% p.a. was also claimed
on said sum. By way of counter claim, the appellant claimed
Rs.3 lacs as damages; Rs.34,593/- being refund of security

18% p.a.
13.

The learned arbitrator has disallowed the counter

claims except counter claim No.2 for refund of the security
deposit which has been held to be adjustable against the claim
of the respondent for damages which has been allowed. The
award reads as under:“Award – claim No.1 of the claimants/UOI:
It is allowed on the following grounds:
1.
Date of breach in this matter is 31.12.85

14.

In the recitals to the award the learned arbitrator

has noted:
“I have perused the documents filed and relied
upon by both the parties.
I have also perused the purchase file brought
before me on my direction.”
15.

A perusal of the record of the learned arbitrator

reveals that the respondent filed as many as 29 documents
being the correspondence between the parties and the
documents pertaining to risk purchase. The documents have
been filed under cover of an index dated 6.1.1992. Like wise,

FAO No.281/2000

Page 10 of 16

under cover of 2 indexes, both dated 31.8.1992, the appellant
filed 15 documents.
16.

No doubt, the learned arbitrator has recorded in the

award that he had perused the purchased file brought before
him on his directions and that there is no order passed by the
learned arbitrator to the effect that the file should be produced
before him, but on said count alone the award cannot be set
aside unless it is shown that the learned arbitrator had relied
upon a document in the department's file and otherwise not
forming his record. None has been shown at the hearing. At
this stage I may note that the decision relied upon by learned
counsel for the appellant reported as 2004 (3) RAJ 685
G.L.Textiles Co. Vs. UOI is distinguishable on facts inasmuch as
in para 5 of said decision it was noted that the findings of the
arbitrator and in particular the finding that the contract has
been validly terminated by the Union of India, are based on the
documents and correspondence which the arbitrator might
have perused in the purchase file. I repeat, in the instant case
learned counsel for the appellant could not show any
documents referred to by the learned arbitrator which did not
form part of his record.
17.

A perusal of the pleading of the appellant before the

learned arbitrator shows that the appellant had raised a two
FAO No.281/2000

Page 11 of 16

fold plea before the arbitrator. Firstly, that vide letter dated
24.10.1985 (contents noted in para 10 above) the respondent
could not unilaterally insert a clause in the contract pertaining
to essentiality certificate and secondly due to non availability
of raw material in the market force majeure conditions came
into existence and hence the appellant was entitled to an
extension of time for completing the contract.
18.

The pleadings of the appellant qua the first plea

before the arbitrator is as under:“The respondent to avoid any further delays
who was having all the intentions of making the
supplies as per letter dt. 8-8-85, even agreed to
give Rs.25/- concession but the claimant acting
illegally issued the extension letter dt. 24-10-85,
changed the terms and conditions regarding the
Essentiality Certificate with the terms which was
not stated by the respondent by writing down
the following:
“Under Clause 19, Special Instructions.
After existing entries, please add the following
Clause 'O'.
ESSENTIALITY CERTIFICATE

19.

Section/Size,

Quality

Quantity

Suffice would it be to note that the original contract

did not envisage that the respondent would be obliged to help
the appellant in procuring raw material. It was the appellant
which desired issuance of an essentiality certificate vide it's
letter dated 18.9.1985 when it, inter alia, wrote:
“An early action to issue the essentiality certificate is
requested.”
20.

Even

otherwise,

issuance

of

an

essentiality

certificate was to the benefit of the appellant.
21.

The first plea is thus an eye wash and of no legal

significance.
22.

The plea of force majeure would be available to a

party only if it can be shown that due to circumstances beyond
its control and not envisaged by the parties when the contract
was entered into, it was unable to perform its obligations.
Clauses which excuse performance in general terms may be
construed as force majeure clauses. It is settled law that it is
for a party relying upon a force majeure clause to prove the

FAO No.281/2000

Page 13 of 16

facts bringing the case within the clause.

The party must

therefore prove the occurrence of an event and that due to the
same the party has been prevented, hindered or delayed (as
the case may be) from performing the contract by reason of
that event. Two more things have to be further proved. Firstly
that the non performance was due to circumstances beyond
the control of the party; and secondly and that there were no
reasonable steps that the party could have taken to avoid or
mitigate the event or its consequences. To put it pithily the
party must show that the performance has become physically
or legally impossible.

It has to be noted that the instant

contract does not contain a force majeure clause. Be that as it
may, a perusal of the award shows that the learned arbitrator
has considered the said plea raised by the appellant with
reference to the case pleaded by the appellant that raw
material was not available in the market.

The learned

arbitrator has returned a finding of fact that the appellant has
not led any evidence to establish that the raw material was not
available in the market. The learned arbitrator has also noted
that as a matter of fact part goods were supplied. From this,
an inference has been drawn that raw material was available in
the market. The plea of the appellant that only SAIL was
manufacturing the iron/steel of the requisite specification and
FAO No.281/2000

Page 14 of 16

in the absence of an essentiality certificate was not supplying
the raw material to the appellant has been duly considered by
the arbitrator.

The learned arbitrator has noted that the

contract as originally entered into between the parties did not
provide for the issuance of any essentiality certificate by the
respondent. I may only add that on the one hand the appellant
desired an essentiality certificate to be issued to it by the
respondent and when the respondent amended the contract to
insert a clause pertaining to the essentiality certificate, the
appellant had a grievance that the contract could not be
unilaterally amended. It would also be relevant to note that
the original contract envisaged supply to be effected within 5
months. The contract period was repeatedly extended at the
asking of the appellant and notwithstanding the respondent
agreeing to issue an essentiality certificate vide letter dated
24.10.1985, no supply was made till contract was rescinded on
25.2.1986.
23.

The learned Judge who has dealt with the objections

filed by the appellant to the award in question has rightly
repelled the challenge for the reason while considering
objections to an award the court cannot sit in appeal over the
award. The court cannot re-appreciate the evidence.
24.

I find no infirmity in the impugned order.

FAO No.281/2000

The appeal is dismissed.

Since none appeared for the respondent at the

hearing, there shall be no order to the costs.
