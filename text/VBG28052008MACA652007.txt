V.B.Gupta, J.
By way of present appeal, appellants are seeking
enhancement of compensation amount awarded to
them by the learned Tribunal.
2.

The facts in brief are that on 20th November,

2002, deceased, Kapil Bidhuri was going on his Motor

MAC App No.65/2007

Page 2 of 9

Cycle No.HR-51-L-4331 from Teh Khand to Faridabad
and when at about 9.30 p.m. he reached near Village
Badarpur, the deceased was hit by a speeding Bus
No.DL-IPB-3144. The Bus was being driven rashly and
negligently by its driver/respondent No.1 and due to
the forceful impact, the deceased died on the spot. A
compensation claimed of Rs.20 lacs along with interest
@ 12% p.a. from the date of filing of the petition till
realization was filed by the appellants against the
respondents.
3.

Vide impugned judgment dated 3rd November,

2006, passed by Ms. Sukhvinder, Judge, MACT Delhi,
she awarded a sum of Rs.5,00,360/- as compensation
along with 7.5% interest p.a. from the date of filing of
the petition till realization.
4.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

appellants that the deceased was working as a
Marketing Manager and was getting a salary of
Rs.7,500/- p.m. besides a fixed conveyance allowance

MAC App No.65/2007

Page 3 of 9

of

Rs.2,000/-

p.m.

and

salary

certificate

of

the

deceased has already been duly proved on record but
in

spite

thereof

the

Tribunal

has

assessed

the

income on the basis of minimum wages at Rs.3,128/-.
The Tribunal ought to have taken the dependency of
the appellants at Rs.7,500/- p.m. by taking future
prospects.
5.

On the other hand, it has been contended by

learned

counsel

for

the

respondents/Insurance

Company that appellants have failed to produce any
document showing that the deceased was earning
Rs.7,500/- p.m. nor any statement of accounts the
deceased have been produced that he was having a
regular monthly income. Under these circumstances,
the Tribunal rightly assessed the monthly income of
the deceased as per the minimum wages.
6.

There is no dispute with regard to the age of the

deceased which was 26 years and the Tribunal adopted
a multiplier of 18 years as per the Second Schedule of

MAC App No.65/2007

Page 4 of 9

the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short as „Act‟). The
only question which arises for consideration is as to
whether the Tribunal rightly assessed the monthly
income of the deceased on the basis of minimum wages
and whether future prospects of the deceased was
taken into account or not.
7.

PW 1, the widow of the deceased, in her testimony

has deposed that the deceased was working as a Marketing
Manager with M/s. Niharika Financial Services and was
earning Rs.7,500/- as salary per month and Rs.2,000/- per
month as conveyance allowance. However, in her crossexamination she deposed that the deceased was getting his
salary by cheque but she was not sure about it.
8.

PW3, the employer of the deceased has also testified

that the deceased was employed in his firm at a salary of
Rs.7,500/-

per

month

and

Rs.2,000/-

per

month

as

conveyance allowance. However, he has failed to produce
any document establishing that the deceased was his
employee and earning Rs.7,500/- per month. Further, in his

MAC App No.65/2007

Page 5 of 9

statement he deposed that he used to pay the deceased
mostly by cash.
9.

Thus,

there

are

contradictions

between

the

statements of PW1 and PW 3. Further, in the statement of
the PW 3 the words “because the same have been
burnt” have been added later on. These added words
relate to the accounts with regard to the payments made
by PW-3 to the deceased. Even otherwise, no material has
been placed on record to show as to when the relevant
record was burnt. This bald statement given by PW3 does
not inspire any confidence with regard to the story put in
the evidence about burning of the record.

Thus, the

testimony of both PW 1 and PW 3 is not reliable on this
account that deceased was getting a salary of Rs.7,500/per month.
10.

The appellant has failed to produce any statement of

accounts of the deceased to show that the deceased was
having a regular monthly income. Even otherwise from the
qualification of the deceased it cannot be believed that he
would have been employed as a Marketing Manager, as

MAC App No.65/2007

Page 6 of 9

admittedly he had failed in the first year examination of
Diploma in Mechanical Engineering.
11.

Learned counsel for the appellants has cited a

decision of Bombay High Court namely: Satpal Singh

DharamSingh Chowdhary & Anr. v. Ashok G. Raut &
Ors., I (2006) ACC 341. In this case, the employer has
deposed that deceased was paid Rs.8,000/- p.m. but the
Tribunal discarded same stating that it was not supported
by any payroll or account books or income tax returns and
assessed the income of deceased at Rs.15,000/- p.a.

The

Court held that:“Non submission of income tax returns
would not necessarily mean that the income
of Vijender was Rs.15,000/- per annum and
calculation of Rs.1,000/- per month for four
years was also not proper”
12.

With respect, I do not find myself in agreement with

this decision of Bombay High Court.
13.

The accident in the present case took place during

the year 2002 and if the income of the deceased is taken as
Rs.7,500/-

per

month

plus

Rs.2,000/-

per

month

as

conveyance allowance then the total gross salary would
come to Rs. 1,14,000/- per annum. Under the Income Tax

MAC App No.65/2007

Page 7 of 9

Act, 1961, on this salary, the deceased was liable to pay the
income tax and his employer was to deduct TDS.

No

income tax return has been placed on the record on behalf
of the appellants nor the employer of deceased has stated
as to what amount he was depositing after deducting the
tax from the salary of the deceased.

Thus, no reliable

documentary evidence has been placed on record with
regard to the income of the deceased.
14.

When the question of paying income tax to the

Government comes, then the claimants say that the income
of deceased is below taxable, but when the question of
receiving any compensation or any grant from Government
arises, then the claimants say that the earnings of
deceased are more than taxable income, so, the claimants
cannot blow hot and cold at the same moment. If the
income is above taxable limit, then income tax return
should be filed, otherwise legal presumption would be that
the income was below taxable limit.
15.

Since, no income tax was being paid by the deceased,

the Tribunal rightly, under these circumstances, has taken

MAC App No.65/2007

Page 8 of 9

the income of the deceased, on the minimum wages and no
fault can be found on this account.
16.

It is now well settled that while estimating future loss

of income, the Court has to take into account future
prospects of the deceased. No future prospects can be
considered in the present case as no evidence to this effect
was led by the appellant. Therefore, in the absence of any
proof with regard to the same, in view of Bijoy Kumar

Duggar v. Bidagar Dutta AIR 2006 SC 1255, the
contention regarding the future prospects is rejected.
17.

The compensation awarded by the learned tribunal is

just and fair. Accordingly, no infirmity can be found with
the order of learned Tribunal.
18.

The present appeal is, therefore, dismissed.

19.

No orders as to costs.

20.

Trial Court record be sent back.
