PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Facts may be noted in brief. Asian Global Ltd. (here-in-

after referred to as AGL) had an account with the Central Bank of
India. AGL was advanced certain credits by the bank. There were
defaults. Payments remained outstanding by AGL to its banker.
2.

In the month of March 1996, 4 cheques, each in sum of

Rs.5 lacs were issued by Asian Consolidated Industries Ltd. (hereCrl.M.C. No.4122/2003

Page No.2 of 11

in-after referred to as ACI) in favour of AGL.

Vide letter dated

7.3.1996 AGL forwarded the 4 cheques to its banker informing as
under :'Find enclosed the following cheques to clear the
outstanding amount in our account .........'.
3.

The cheques when presented for encashment were

returned dishonoured by the banker to whom the cheques were
drawn, i.e. the banker of ACI.
4.

After notifying that the cheques were dishonoured,

notice being served upon AGL and ACI, 4 complaints under
Section 138 read with Section 142 of the N.I. Act, 1881 was filed.
5.

Alok Jain, Sanjay Jain, Rajeev Jain, Rakesh C.Jain and

Sarla Jain stated to be Directors of ACI and AGL were impleaded
as accused persons, apart from the company ACI and AGL.
6.

Summoning orders were passed by the learned Trial

Judge. The same have noted that prima facie, accused are liable
to be summoned under Section 138 read with Section 141 N.I.
Act.
7.

An application was filed for recall of the summoning

orders. As per law then understood and interpreted, i.e. before
decision of the Supreme Court in Adalat Prasad Vs. Rooplal Jindal
& Ors. (2004) 7 SCC 338

was pronounced, since applications

seeking recall of the summoning orders were being considered by
the trial courts, the application for recall of the summoning order
was considered.

The same was dismissed vide order dated

28.7.2003.
Crl.M.C. No.4122/2003

8.

Since

Hon'ble

Supreme

Court

opined

in

Adalat

Prashad's case (supra) that the court issuing the summoning
order cannot recall the same, thus learned counsel for the parties
have addressed arguments on the issue, de hors the order dated
28.7.2003.
9.

Petitioners in the above captioned petitions are Sarla

Jain, Rajeev Jain and AGL.
10.

Sarla Jain questions the summoning order, inter alia,

alleging that she was an Alternative Director and that she was
neither in charge nor was in control of the affairs of the 2
companies. It is further contended by her that averments in the
complaint do not disclose a cause to proceed against her. Rajeev
Jain urges that the complaint does not disclose any cognizable
offence against him.
11.

Averments against Sarla Jain including other stated

Directors of the 2 companies are contained in paras 12 and 21 of
the complaint. The same reads as under :“12. That the Accused No.3 to 7 are the Directors of
the Accused No.1 and 2 and responsible and liable for
the acts of Accused no.1 and 2 as envisaged under
the law.
XXXX
21. That as submitted earlier, Accused No.3 to 7 as
Directors of Accused No.1 and 2 have committed the
offence and hence they are liable to be prosecuted for
the offences under Section 138, 139 & 142 of the N.I.
Act and under Section 120B and 420 of the Indian
Penal Code.”
12.

Learned counsel for Sarla Jain and Rajeev Jain submits

Crl.M.C. No.4122/2003

Page No.4 of 11

that averments in the complaint do not disclose any cognizable
offences committed by Sarla Jain or Rajeev Jain. It is urged by
learned counsel that liability of Directors of a company is a
vicarious liability under Section 141 of the N.I. Act, 1881 and
foundation of the vicarious liability is that the person made
vicariously liable is in charge of and was responsible to the
company for the conduct of the business of the company.
Further, counsel

submits that extended liability under sub-

section 2 of Section 141 of the N.I. Act can be fastened only
where it is pleaded and proved that the offence has been
committed with the consent or connivance of or is attributable to
any neglect on the part of the person made so liable.
13.

It is further urged that the pleadings in para 12 of the

complaint evidences a presumptive plea that Sarla Jain and
Rajeev Jain would be liable, as law envisages that they are liable.
14.

Per contra, learned counsel for the bank urges that

pleadings in para 12 of the complaint are with sufficient clarity
and bring home the allegations that Sarla Jain and Rajeev Jain are
responsible and are liable for the acts of the 2 accused
companies.
15.

Whether Sarla Jain was or was not an alternative

director is a question of fact which needs evidence for its
resolution and hence I am not dealing with said submission.
16.

Suffice would it be to state that criminal liability has to

be fastened with certainty and not on loose and laconic

Crl.M.C. No.4122/2003

Page No.5 of 11

pleadings.

In a complaint case, the complaint must make it

manifestly clear as to what is the gravement of the allegation
against a particular accused. Unless law presumes, there cannot
be any presumption that a person is guilty of an offence.
17.

In case of offence by a company, a presumption would

arise that the offence has been committed with the active
knowledge, consent or supervision of the Managing Director for
the reason by virtue of the designation of his office, namely,
'Managing' law presumes that such person would be liable. But in
the case of Directors, position is to the contrary.
presumption arises.

No legal

Vicarious liability has to be pleaded and

proved.
18.

Sub-Section 1 of Section 141 of the N.I. Act, 1881

reads as under :'141. Offences by companies.-(1) If the person
committing an offence under section 138 is a
company, every person who, at the time the offence
was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible
to the company for the conduct of the business of the
company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to
be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be
proceeded against and punished accordingly.'
19.
A bare reading of Sub-Section 1 of Section 141 of the
N.I. Act makes it clear that to fasten liability on a Director it has to
be proved that the person named as the Director was responsible
to the company and was incharge of the affairs of the company
pertaining to the conduct of the business of the company.
20.

The principle of variance between pleading and proof

would require that before a fact is proved, it must be pleaded.

Crl.M.C. No.4122/2003

Page No.6 of 11

Thus, an essential ingredient of an actionable complaint, where
liability is fastened on the shoulders of a Director, would be to
aver that the person concerned was in charge of and was
responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the
company.
21.

The reason is that on proof of such facts, law would

treat said person to be guilty of the offence committed by the
company.
22.

In the decision reported as AIR 1983 SC 67 Municipal

Corporation of Delhi Vs. Ram Kishan Rastogi & Anr., pertaining to
an offence under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 195,
following averment in the complaint was made :'5.
That the Accused No.3 is the Manager of
Accused No.2 and Accused No.4 to 7 are the Directors
of Accused No.2 and as such they were incharge of
and responsible for the conduct of business of
Accused No.2 at the time of sampling.'
23.
Considering the aforenoted pleadings, Hon'ble
Supreme Court, in para 14 of the report, opined that a
meaningful reading of the pleading shows that the complaint had
merely presumed that the Directors of the company would be
guilty because of holding a particular office since law would
assume so.
24.

In para 15 it was opined that no such inference is

presumed by law and that since Directors are vicariously liable
for offences by the company and vicarious liability being an
incident of an offence under the Act, there have to be specific
averments of fact against the Directors wherefrom a reasonable
Crl.M.C. No.4122/2003

Page No.7 of 11

inference could be drawn that if proved, they, i.e. the Directors
would also be vicariously liable.
25.

In the report published as AIR 2007 SC 1454 N.K.Wahi

Vs. Shekhar Singh & Ors., dealing with Sections 141 and 138 of
the N.I. Act, noting an earlier decision of the Supreme Court
reported as (2005) 8 SCC 89 SMS Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. Neeta
Bhalla, in para 8 of the report, their Lordships of the Supreme
Court observed as under :-

26.

“8. To launch a prosecution, therefore, against the
alleged Directors there must be a specific allegation in
the complaint as to the part played by them in the
transaction. There should be clear and unambiguous
allegation as to how the Directors are incharge and
responsible for the conduct of the business of the
company. The description should be clear. It is true
that precise words from the provisions of the Act need
not be reproduced and the Court can always come to
a conclusion in facts of each case. But still in the
absence of any averment or specific evidence the net
result would be that complaint would not be
entertainable.”
In para 19, legal position was summarized and in sub-

para 'a' of para 19 it was clarified as under :-

27.

“19(a).
It is necessary to specifically aver in a
complaint under Section 141 that at the time the
offence was committed, the person accused was in
charge of, and responsible for the conduct of the
business of the company. This averment is an
essential requirement of Section 141 and has to be
made in a complaint. Without this averment being
made in a complaint, the requirements of Section 141
cannot be said to be satisfied.”
Perusal of pleadings in para 12 of the complaint clearly

envisage that liability on the Directors is sought to be fastened on
the allegation that as envisaged under the law, the Directors are
responsible and liable for the acts of accused No.1 and 2.

The

pleadings

fall

short

of

sufficient

averments

required to be made constituting a proper cause pleaded in a
complaint under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the N.I. Act.
29.

Petitions filed by Sarla Jain are liable to be allowed on

this short ground.
30.

Pertaining to the petitions filed by Asian Global Ltd.

and Rajeev Jain, suffice would it be to state that since there is
commonality of pleadings vis-a-vis Rajeev Jain and Sarla Jain, for
the reasons noted here-in-above in favour of Sarla Jain, petitions
filed on behalf of Rajeev Jain have likewise to be allowed.
31.

As regards the plea of AGL, an interesting issue arose

for consideration and was debated at the Bar.

The issue was

whether AGL had negotiated the 4 cheques in favour of Central
Bank of India or whether the bank was handed over the cheques
for collection. In other words, whether the status of the bank was
that of a holder for collection or whether it was as holder in due
course.
32.

Learned counsel for the bank took a final stand that

case of the bank is that the bank was a holder in due course.
Thus learned counsel for the parties state that the matter may
proceed ahead for decision taking on record the stand of learned
counsel for the bank that the bank was a holder in due course of
the 4 cheques.
33.
due

Proceeding on the basis that the bank was a holder in
course,

question

Crl.M.C. No.4122/2003

would

arise,

whether

under

the

Page No.9 of 11

circumstances AGL would be liable for the cheques being
returned unpaid due to insufficiency of funds.
34.
Ltd.

Admitted fact is that the 4 cheques were issued by ACI
If the bank, i.e. Central Bank of India became a holder in

due course, I fail to understand as to how AGL would be liable in
case the cheques were dishonoured by the banker on which ACI
Ltd. drew the cheques.
35.

Indeed, learned counsel for the Bank, short of making

a concession, failed to make any worthwhile submissions
whereform it could be gathered that liability would be of AGL in
addition to that of ACI Ltd.
36.

It would have been debatable if it was the case of the

bank that in discharge of its liability, AGL got the cheques issued
form ACI and ACI promised to clear the dues of AGL.

This

argument could have been considered if case of the bank was not
of being a holder in due course.
37.

Under the circumstances, I hold that the complaint

discloses no cause of action against AGL.
38.

I clarify. I have proceeded on the basis, as submitted

by learned counsel for the bank, that the bank claims to be a
holder in due course of the 4 cheques.
39.

The net result is that the petitions have to succeed in

favour of all the petitioners.
40.

Ordered accordingly.

41.

The complaints and summoning orders are quashed

but limited to the petitioners, namely, AGL, Rajeev Jain and Sarla
Jain.
