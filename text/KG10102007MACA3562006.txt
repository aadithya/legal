MAC APP. No. 356/2006

page 1 of 8

contention of the counsel for the appellant is that the appellant
had duly proved the DL verification report i.e., Ex.R3W1/3 which
clearly states that the driver of the offending vehicle was
authorized to drive LMV w.e.f. 11.7.2000 but later on w.e.f.
16.5.2001 he became eligible to drive HMV. The accident in
question had occurred on 20.1.2001 and therefore on the date of
the said accident the driver of the offending vehicle was not
authorised to drive HMV and it is not in dispute that the driver of
the offending vehicle was driving a truck bearing registration
no.HR-37-A-1571. Counsel for the appellant further contends
that the appellant had served a notice as envisaged under Order
12 Rule 8 of the CPC upon the owner of the offending vehicle.
Carbon copy of the same

was exhibited as Ex.R3W1/4.

However, despite service of notice under Order 12 Rule 8 the
owner and driver of the offending vehicle failed to produce the
documents as detailed in the said notice sent by the appellant.
Counsel for the appellant, thus, contends that adverse inference
should have been drawn against the owner and driver of the

MAC APP. No. 356/2006

page 2 of 8

offending vehicle on account of non production of the original
driving licence and other documents as sought in the said notice
under Order 12 Rule 8. Counsel for the appellant contends that
the owner of the vehicle also did not prefer to contest the case
and preferred to remain ex-parte during the proceedings before
the Tribunal. Counsel for the appellant further contends that
even the said witness R3W1 according to whose deposition the
notice was served under Order 12 Rule 8 CPC and the legal
verification report were exhibited was not cross-examined by the
owner and driver of the vehicle. Counsel for the appellant has
also placed reliance on the order of this Court passed in MAC.
APP. No. 261/2006, dated 28.3.2007, where in similar
circumstances this Court has granted recovery rights to the
insurer to recover the award amount from the owner or driver of
the offending vehicle.
Per contra, counsel for the respondent contends that
there is no illegality or perversity in the award passed by the
Tribunal.

He further contends that the Tribunal has placed

MAC APP. No. 356/2006

page 3 of 8

reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in United India
Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Lehru & Ors. 1(2003) ACC
611 (SC), wherein it has been clearly held that the owner of the
offending vehicle is not expected to find out as to whether the
licence issued in favour of the driver was a genuine or fake one
or was it issued by the competent authority or not.
I have heard counsel for the parties at considerable
length.
Here is a case where a verification report issued by
the Licencing Authority, Koderma, Jharkhand has been duly
certified that the licence in question issued in favour of Mr.
Tekka Ram was initially for driving LMV w.e.f. 16.7.2000 and it
is only w.e.f. 16.5.2001, the same was changed to HMV. The
driver Tekka Ram, therefore, became eligible and authorised to
drive the HMV only w.e.f. 16.5.2001 and not prior thereto. The
accident in question involving the said offending vehicle had
occurred on 20.1.2001 and admittedly on that date the driver was
authorised to drive LMV and not HMV. It is, thus clear breach of

MAC APP. No. 356/2006

page 4 of 8

Section 149 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act and therefore, the
insurance company gets the right to recover the award amount
from the insured/owner of the offending vehicle. This is so also
because the insured/owner of the offending vsehicle failed to
contest

the

compensation case filed by the claimants.

The

owner also failed to give any response to the notice served upon
him under Order 12 Rule 8 of the CPC. The respondent/owner of
the offending vehicle also

failed

to cross-examine the said

witness R3W1, adduced by the appellant who had proved the
said verification of driving licence as well as copy of the notice
served upon the owner of the offending vehicle under Order 12
Rule 8 CPC. In the similar circumstances, this Court in an
appeal bearing MAC. APP. No. 261/2006 has held that adverse
inference has to be drawn against the insured who despite notice
under Order 12 Rule 8 CPC failed to produce the original licence.
The appellant has already paid the entire award amount along
with interest to the claimants. The only relief as claimed by the
appellant is for recovery of the award amount from the

Vs.Nicolletta

Rohtagi while elaborating the scope of Section 149(2) of the
Act has observed as under:

“ 13 . To answer the question, it is necessary to find
out on what grounds the insurer is entitled to
defend/contest against a claim by an injured or
dependants of the victims of a motor vehicle accident.
Under Section 96(2) of the 1939 Act which
corresponds to Section 149(2) of the 1988 Act, an
insurance company has no right to be a party to an
action by the injured person or dependants of the
deceased against the insured. However, the said
provision gives the insurer the right to be made a
party to the case and to defend it. It is, therefore,
obvious that the said right is a creature of the statute
and its content depends on the provisions of the
statute. After the insurer has been made a party to a
case or claim, the question arises, what are the
defences available to it under the statute? The
language employed in enacting sub-section (2) of
Section 149 appears to be plain and simple and there
is no ambiguity in it. It shows that when an insurer is
impleaded and has been given notice of the case, he
is entitled to defend the action on grounds
enumerated in the sub-section, namely, sub-section
(2) of Section 149 of the 1988 Act, and no other
ground is available to him. The insurer is not allowed
to contest the claim of the injured or heirs of the
deceased on other ground which is available to an
insured or breach of any other conditions of the policy
which do not find place in sub-section (2) of Section
149 of the 1988 Act. If an insurer is permitted to
MAC APP. No. 356/2006

page 6 of 8

contest the claim on other grounds it would mean
adding more grounds of contest to the insurer than
what the statute has specifically provided for.
14 . Sub-section (7) of Section 149 of the 1988 Act
clearly indicates in what manner sub-section (2) of
Section 149 has to be interpreted. Sub-section (7) of
Section 149 provides that no insurer to whom the
notice referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section
(3) has been given shall be entitled to avoid his
liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any
such judgment or award as is referred to in subsection (1) or in such judgment as is referred to in
sub-section (3) otherwise than in the manner
provided for in sub-section (2) or in the
corresponding law of the reciprocating country, as the
case may be. The expression ‘manner’ employed in
sub-section (7) of Section 149 is very relevant which
means an insurer can avoid its liability only in
accordance with what has been provided for in subsection (2) of Section 149. It, therefore, shows that
the insurer can avoid its liability only on the statutory
defences expressly provided in sub-section (2) of
Section 149 of the 1988 Act. We are, therefore, of
the view that an insurer cannot avoid its liability on
any other grounds except those mentioned in subsection (2) of Section 149 of the 1988 Act.”
11. As was observed in the said case the statutory
defences which are available to the insurer to contest
the claim are confined to those provided in subsection (2) of Section 149.”

In view of the above discussion, I dispose

of the

appeal granting recovery rights to the appellant to recover the
award amount as already paid by the appellant to the
MAC APP. No. 356/2006

page 7 of 8

beneficiaries of the claim petition from respondent/owner of the
offending vehicle.
With these directions, appeal stands disposed of.
Lower court record be returned.
