A.K. SIKRI, J.
:
1. The petitioner herein, a few days before his retirement, was
served with a charge-sheet dated 22.5.1989.

After nine

days, i.e. on 31.5.1993, he retired on attaining the age of
superannuation. However, inquiry against him continued.
Charges were held to be established on the basis of which,
penalty

of

“Censure”

was

passed

against

him

on

20.6.2000. Since inquiry had continued after the date of his

WP(C) No.6707/2002

Page 1 of 6

retirement, before the said punishment was imposed and
inquiry was still pending, the petitioner vide his letter dated
26.3.1998 requested the respondent to take him back in
the service from 31.5.1993 with all consequential benefits
on the ground that disciplinary proceedings could not
continue

against

him

after

his

retirement

and

the

department could hold these proceedings only while
retaining him in service till such inquiry is completed and
final order is passed therein. He, therefore, stated that as
the respondent had decided to continue with the inquiry,
he should have been treated in service. He supported this
submission by referring to the judgment of the Supreme
Court in State of Punjab Vs. Khemi Ram, AIR 1970 SC 214,
wherein it was held by the Supreme Court that the only
course open to the Government was to pass an order of
suspension and refuse to permit the concerned public
servant to retire and retain him in service till such inquiry is
completed and final order passed therein. This request of
the petitioner was rejected on 8.5.1998.
2. He thereafter filed OA before the Central Administrative
Tribunal (in short the 'Tribunal'), which was dismissed vide
order dated 24.5.2000 and at the same time, direction was
WP(C) No.6707/2002

Page 2 of 6

given to the respondent to conclude the inquiry within
three months. Within one month thereafter, as pointed out
above, penalty of censure was imposed on 20.6.2000. The
petitioner

filed

review

against

the

judgment

dated

24.5.2000 before the Tribunal and was unsuccessful in his
attempt. He thereafter approached this Court by filing writ
petition, which was also dismissed by this Court on
16.10.2001

observing

that

the petition

had

become

infructuous in view of penalty of censure. Permission was,
however, given to the petitioner to question the penalty of
censure,

if

so

advised.

The

petitioner,

thus,

filed

departmental appeal against the penalty of censure.

As

this

OA

appeal

was

not

decided,

he

preferred

No.1807/2002 seeking a direction that his appeal be
decided and relief was also prayed that he be treated as on
duty with all consequential benefits.

This OA was again

dismissed by the Tribunal on 19.7.2002. Review filed there
against was also dismissed by the Tribunal on 16.8.2002.
However, the respondent vide order dated 26.9.2002
decided to drop the charges while deciding his appeal
citing the following reasons:-

WP(C) No.6707/2002

Page 3 of 6

“The appeal of Shri M.C. Aggarwal was
considered again and it was found
that the penalty of “Censure” on
retired Government servant is an
infructuous penalty. It is, therefore,
felt that the end of justice will be met
if the charges framed against Shri
M.C. Aggarwal are dropped.”
3. According to the petitioner, effect of dropping the charges
is that penalty of censure imposed on 20.6.2000 also
vanishes to the extent that he be treated on duty for the
intervening period, i.e. from 1.6.1993 to 20.6.2000 with all
consequential benefits and be given the entire arrears of
pay with interest at the rate of 18%.

Compensation of

Rs.10 lakhs is also claimed for miseries, harassment,
financial hardship etc.
4. In this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, we are
concerned with the validity of orders dated 19.7.2002
rejecting OA No 1807/2002 of the petitioner and the orders
dated 16.8.2002 vide which his review petition was
dismissed.
5. We heard the petitioner, who appeared in person and also
filed written arguments. Nobody appeared on behalf of the
respondent. The sequence of events narrated above would
indicate that same relief that he be treated on duty was
claimed by the petitioner by filing OA on previous occasion,
WP(C) No.6707/2002

Page 4 of 6

which was dismissed on 26.6.2000 and application seeking
review of that judgment was also dismissed on 22.9.2000.
Against these orders, writ filed before this Court was also
dismissed on 16.10.2001.

In view thereof, it was not

permissible for the petitioner to seek the same relief again
by filing OA No.1807/2000. This OA, therefore, has been
rightly dismissed by the Tribunal vide impugned orders
dated 19.7.2002 holding that this matter could

not be

taken up in the said OA again.
6. That apart, we find from the orders dated 24.5.2000
passed on earlier occasion, the Tribunal noted that though
after the service of charge-sheet the petitioner had retired,
he was informed that the inquiry was continued under Rule
9 of the CCS (Pension) Rules and continuation of inquiry
under these provisions was legal and justified.

In such

circumstances, after the retirement he could not claim that
he be treated on Government service even when he had
attained the age of superannuation.
7. The contention of the petitioner is based on the judgment
in State of Punjab Vs. Khemi Ram (supra). However, that
judgment was rendered before the CCS (Pension) Rules,
1972 came into force.
WP(C) No.6707/2002

Rule 9 specifically empowers the
Page 5 of 6

Government to continue the inquiry even after the
retirement and, therefore, no Government employee has
right to claim that he be treated on duty after the age of
superannuation and be paid salary and other benefits for
the period from the date of retirement till the conclusion of
the inquiry proceedings.

This petition is, thus, devoid of

any merits and is accordingly dismissed.
8. Parties are left to bear their own costs.
