1.

Petitioner challenges the order dated 4th October 2006

passed by Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi
(the Tribunal) dismissing his original application No.186/2006 whereby
the Petitioner had sought the consideration of his case for reengagement as casual labourer in preference to juniors and outsiders
and without insisting on the Petitioner getting re-sponsorship of his
name from the Employment Exchange.
W.P. (C) No. 1219/2007

2.

The case of the Petitioner is that he was engaged as a

casual labourer on sponsorship, of his name by the Employment
Exchange by completing all the required formalities with effect from
18.9.1996. He worked in that capacity up to March 1988 whereafter
his services were dispensed with. Respondent, it is claimed, gave a
fresh requisition to the Employment Exchange for engaging casual
labourers ignoring the fact that the petitioner had worked as a casual
labourer. Being aggrieved by this action, the Petitioner preferred O.A.
No. 602/1998 before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal
Bench, New Delhi, (the Tribunal). The same was disposed of on
28.10.1998

by

directing

the

Respondent

to

consider

the

re-

engagement of the Petitioner as a casual labourer as and when
specific need arises for such engagement in preference to junior or
fresh candidates and in case the Petitioner completes the requisite
number of days, to consider him for grant of temporary status in
accordance with the rules.
3.

The Petitioner states that he was re-engaged vide order

dated 24.12.1998 but he was again dis-engaged from 29.1.1999
onwards on account of completion of work.
4.

The Petitioner once again approached the Tribunal by filing

O.A. No. 846/2000 before the Tribunal. Since, according to the
Petitioner, he was once again called to join duty vide order dated
11.3.1999 but he was in fact not engaged by the Respondent. This OA
W.P. (C) No. 1219/2007

Page 2 of 5

was dismissed on 12.5.2000 while giving liberty to the Petitioner to file
contempt proceedings. He then filed CP 229/2000 before the Tribunal
on the premise that the Respondent had once again engaged a fresh
person namely one Shri Sohan Pal in August 2005 thereby ignoring the
case of the Petitioner. It was further claimed that the Respondent was
again

sending

requisition

to

the

Employment

Exchange

for

engagement of casual labourer.
5.

The Respondents opposed the petition. It was stated that

they had engaged the Petitioner in Central Ground Water Board,
Faridabad as a daily wager for a specific period on the job which was
of casual nature. On 18.9.1996 his services were dis-continued when
there was no work. He was not engaged through the local Employment
Exchange. His engagement was of temporary in nature, till the regular
vacancies were filled up through the local Employment Exchange and
upon wide publicity in the employment news. Respondent further
stated that in the sumer season, the Central Ground Water Board,
Faridabad had engaged same labourers for a specific number of days.
The Petitioner was issued an Office Memorandum dated 24.12.1998
for attending general nature of miscellaneous work on casual basis for
a period of one month. But he did not respond to this offer. Another
memorandum was issued to the Petitioner on 6.1.1999 again asking
him to attend to casual duties. On this occasion he joined duties on
11.1.1999 and worked uptill 21.1.1999. However, Petitioner did not

W.P. (C) No. 1219/2007

Page 3 of 5

adhere to at the time schedule of casual labourer between 8 AM to 5
PM and that he left his job without any intimation. Yet another
opportunity was given to the Petitioner vide letter dated 11.3.1999.
However, he failed to respond on this occasion. On 9.4.1999 once
again the Petitioner was called upon to join duty immediately. He was
informed that if he does not respond, it would be presumed that he
was not interested in casual work. The Petitioner did not respond to
the said call. The Respondent's submission was that, from the
aforesaid, it is clear that the Petitioner was not interested to work on
casual basis. The Respondent also denied the appointment of Shri
Sohan Pal on casual basis during the month of August 2005 by the
Central Ground Water Board, Faridabad.
6.

The Tribunal rejected the Petitioner's original application

by observing that the Petitioner had not denied the fact that despite
repeated calls, the Petitioner had not responded for the casual work
offered to him. This shows that the Petitioner was not interested in
working on casual basis with the Respondent. Obviously, the
Respondent could not have waited for the Petitioner indefinitely if he
chose not to join the work in spite of repeated opportunities given to
him. The Tribunal found no fault in the Respondent's engaging
another person in order to get the work done since the work could not
have been made to suffer to await the arrival of the Petitioner. Since
the Tribunal was satisfied that the Respondent had made efforts to

W.P. (C) No. 1219/2007

Page 4 of 5

engage the Petitioner repeatedly on casual basis, and that he had not
joined duties there was no illegality in the action of the Respondents.
7.

Having gone through the order of the Tribunal we find no

infirmity in the same. Moreover, in view of the decision of the Supreme
Court in Secretary, Government of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi and
others, (2006) 4 SCC 1, in our view, there is no merit in this petition.
In the light of the aforesaid, we dismiss this Writ Petition as being
without any merit.
