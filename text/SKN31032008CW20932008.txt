ORDER
31.03.2008
The petitioner was allotted shop bearing No.G-27, Palika Bhawan,

R.K.Puram, New Delhi on licence basis on 30.5.1994. It is the case of the
petitioner that on 7th October, 1994, he had entered into a partnership deed
with one Mr.Jamil Ahmed, respondent no.3 herein and on 14.11.1994, the
said partnership firm was dissolved and the petitioner withdrew from the
said firm. It is the case of the petitioner that intimation in this regard was
sent by him to the respondent-NDMC and under some policy, transfer of
licence deed is permissible.

It appears that respondent no.3 did not

deposit the licence fee or enhanced fee with NDMC as a result the transfer
was never regularized by NDMC. On 10.11.2006, the respondentâ€“NDMC
took over the possession of the property and initiated proceedings under
Section 7 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act,

1971 claiming recovery of damages.

The said proceedings are still

pending.
2.

Two prayers made in the present writ petition are for quashing of

proceeding under Section 7 of the Public Premises (Eviction of
Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971 and issue of writ, order or direction in
the nature of mandamus commanding respondent no.1 not to licence out
the premises to any third person and restore the possession of the
premises to the petitioner.
3.

Regarding second prayer, the petition is highly belated and bad for

laches.

As per the case of the petitioner himself, he has not been in

possession of the property on or after 14.11.1994.

Moreover, DDA had

taken over the possession of the property on 10.11.2006. The present writ
petition has been filed only on 12.3.2008.
4.

It is the case of the respondent-NDMC that the petitioner had

indulged in subletting and vacated the property and transfer in favour of the
subletee was never recognized and accepted. As the per note sheet at
page 30, shop in question was found to be in occupation of unauthorized
persons or trespassers as the sublettee had also vacated the shop.
5.

In these circumstances, I am not inclined to entertain the present writ

petition on the second prayer.

6.

With regard to first prayer, proceedings under Section 7 of the Public

Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971 are still pending.
It will not be proper for this Court to interfere in the said proceedings. The
petitioner is entitled to raise all defences available to him under law before
the Estate Officer.

If required, he can challenge the order passed by the

Estate Officer.
The writ petition is disposed of.
