PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Respondents No.1, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 17 have expired.

Thus, the appeal stands abated qua them.
2.

The State is in appeal against an order of acquittal

acquitting the accused persons for the offence under Section
420 read with Section 120-B IPC.
3.

The record has been perused. Learned counsel have

page 1 of 5

been heard.

At the outset I may record that since accused

persons have been acquitted, presumption of innocence in
their favour has got reinforced. Thus, I have called upon the
parties to address arguments limited to show whether the
learned Trial Judge has ignored material evidence and secondly
whether the conclusion arrived at on the basis of the evidence
is perverse.
4.

Case of the prosecution was that a society by the

name of Bhagwan Parshu Ram Siksha Samiti was running an
institution of Physical Education holding out that it would issue
a diploma in Physical Education and that the diploma was
recognized by the government.

Based on the allurement

students were enrolled who paid annual fee to the society.
Accused persons were the member and the office bearers and
members of the managing committee of the institution.
5.

The accused persons stated that they were misled to

believe that the institution was recognized by the government
and for this relied upon letter Ex.PW-7/A dated 30.5.1974
proved by the witness of the prosecution i.e. PW-7. The said
letter was addressed by the Ministry of Education and Social
Welfare to the President of Bhagwan Parshu Ram Shiksha
Samiti wherein it was inter alia conveyed to the President as
page 2 of 5

under:-

6.

“Pending the question of recognition/Diploma/
Certificate in Physical Education run by your
Samiti, on a permanent basis by the Delhi
Administration,
fulfillment
of
essential
requirements and conditions which will be
intimated in due course, it has been decided to
entrust the examination of the students of your
college enrolled during the academic year 197374, to the authorities of the Laxmi Bai National
College of Physical Education, Gwalior.
The
students, who passed this examination will be
considered eligible for appointment to class III
posts of Physical Education Teachers under
Central Government and Union Territories, for
which Diploma/Certificate in Physical Education is
a prescribed qualification.”
Accused persons further relied upon letters Ex.DA

and DB, letter Ex.DA was written by Shri Radha Raman, the
Chief Executive Councillor to Shri D.P.Yadav, Deputy Minister of
Education, Union of India informing that issue pertaining to
recognition of diploma and certificate by Bhagwan Parshu Ram
Shiksha Samiti was under examination. Letter Ex.DB evidences
that the Deputy Educational Advisor, Ministry of Education and
Social Welfare, Union of India approved the syllabus of the
institution.
7.

Therefrom, the accused persons had urged that they

had reasons to believe that the Government had accorded
temporary approval to them for running diploma courses.
Accused pleaded that since in Ex.PW-7/4 the government
page 3 of 5

informed that pending final affiliation the government was
entrusting the examination of students to the college they
bona-fide

believed

that

they

been

granted

temporary

affiliation.

This plea has found favour with the learned Trial

Judge.
8.

I concur with the view taken by the learned Trial

Judge not only with reference to the contents of the 4 letters
afore-noted, all emanating from government agencies, but
even with respect to the testimony of PW-8, Mrs.A.Nanda, who
was the member of the State Institute of Education between
the years 1967-77.

As per her testimony the society had

sought recognition for the course in the year 1973.

Since

recognition could be granted only if institution was found
working, she had inspected the institute and had submitted her
report Ex.PW-8/A.

Based thereon, the Director of Education

opined that recognition of a degree course was not within his
power. The matter remained pending.

Aforesaid fact shows

that the accused persons did not have any guilty mind. They
were acting with transparency.

Though, they were wrong in

believing that the institution had been granted a temporary
recognition but that would not make their conduct actionable
for the offence of cheating.
page 4 of 5

9.

Needless to state, actus reus and mens rea are the

twin elements to sustain the offence under Section 420 IPC.
10.

The view taken by the learned Trial Judge is a

possible view on the evidence which has been adduced by the
prosecution.
11.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

12.

LCR be returned.
