CM No.7856/2007

the petition.

2.

The petitioner has contended that despite the award dated 10th

May, 2005 the petitioner refused to take the respondent on duty and
filed the present petition challenging the award dated 10th May, 2005.

3.

The respondent applicant has contended that he has no other

source of livelihood and he has not been able to seek any employment
in any of the establishment. It is asserted that the respondent applicant
is facing extreme hardship and mental torture and in the circumstances
he has sought payment of revised pay. The application is supported by
the affidavit of the respondent workman.

4.

The application is contested by the petitioner/corporation on the

ground that the relief prayed is not covered under Section 17-B of the
Act. The application is also opposed on the ground that an affidavit has
not filed deposing categorically that the respondent workman is not
employed in any establishment and for how long the respondent is
unemployed. According to the petitioner/management filing of an
affidavit is a condition precedent for grant of any relief under Section
17-B of the I.D Act, 1947.

5.

The petitioner/non-applicant has also challenged the award on

merits. The fact that the workman is unemployed and his family

CM 7856/2007 in WP(C) 5589 of 2006

Page 2 of 8

members are facing hardship has been denied. According to the
petitioner/non-applicant neither the workman is entitled to be taken on
duty nor he is entitled to be paid any arrears of salary or allowances.

6.

The petitioner/non-applicant has also contended that even if the

respondent workman is entitled to receive any amount, the same can
only be at the rate of last drawn wages or minimum wages subject to
furnishing/submitting of security and not at the revised pay scale.

7.

The writ petition was filed by the petitioner challenging the award

dated 10th May, 2005 directing the reinstatement of the petitioner which
award was stayed by this Court by order dated 17th April, 2006.

8.

Perusal of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

reveals that it comes into operation when an Award directing
reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further proceedings by the
employer. The preliminary consideration for making available such a
relief under Section 17B to a workman is to be found in the benevolent
purpose of the enactment, its spirit, intendment and object underlying,
which is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship which
would be caused to a workman due to delay in the implementation of an
award directing reinstatement of his services on account of the
challenge made to it by the employer. Section 17B recognizes a

CM 7856/2007 in WP(C) 5589 of 2006

Page 3 of 8

workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body and soul
together when a challenge has been made to an Award directing his
reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no inherent right of
assailing an order or an award by an industrial adjudicator by way of
an appeal. The payment which is required to be made by the employer
to the workman has been held to be akin to a subsistence allowance
which is neither refundable nor recoverable from a workman even if the
Award in his favor is set aside by the High Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106
(para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex Court was of the
view that the object under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the hardship that is caused to
the workman due to the delay in implementation of the Award.

9.

Moreover granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing

orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule;
refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the relief
could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional
error where there is no relationship of employer and employee between
the parties.

10.

Thus if the requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes

Act, 1947 are satisfied then no order can be passed denying the
workman the benefit of statutory provisions of Section 17B of the

CM 7856/2007 in WP(C) 5589 of 2006

Page 4 of 8

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The statute requires satisfaction of the
following four conditions:
(i)
an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed
in proceedings in a High Court or the Supreme Court;
(ii) during the pendency of such proceedings, employer is
required to pay full wages to the workman;
(iii) the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full wages
last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance
admissible to him under any Rule;
(iv) such wages would be admissible only if the workman
had not been employed in any establishment during such
period and an affidavit had been filed to such effect

11.

The practice of disposal of the petition as well as the application

under Section 17B of the Act contemporaneously was deprecated by the
Apex Court and the High Court was directed to first expeditiously
dispose of the application under Section 17B by the Supreme Court by
its decision reported at VII (2000) SLT 70=JT 2000 (8) SC 501,
Workmen Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Hindustan
Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. & Ors. While considering an application
under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Court cannot go
into the merits of the case in the writ petition. It was so held in 86
(2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.

12.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

CM 7856/2007 in WP(C) 5589 of 2006

Page 5 of 8

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 entitled Town Municipal, Athani v.
P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman has
a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot
be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act for
enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was concerned with
the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the Court would have a
bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well. From the
authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court, the right of a
workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified under the
Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the
constitutional mandate. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean
all the wages that have fallen due at least from the date of the Award.

13.

The petitioner therefore, cannot oppose the relief prayed by the

respondent on the ground that the application under 17B is not
maintainable. The Labor Court directed reinstatement of the respondent
which has been stayed by this Court and the respondent has remained
unemployed. The application of the respondent categorically pleads
about his unemployment and the application is supported by an
affidavit. Therefore, in the circumstances, it cannot be inferred that the
respondent has not stated on affidavit that he is unemployed. The
Learned counsel for the petitioner has also contended that the

CM 7856/2007 in WP(C) 5589 of 2006

Page 6 of 8

application has been filed after considerable delay and therefore the
respondent is not entitled for relief from the date of the award. Perusal
of the record shows that the litigation expenses were paid to the
respondent by order dated 31st July, 2007 as on filing the writ petition,
the petitioner had not paid the litigation expenses. After the order dated
31st July, 2007 the litigation expenses were paid to the respondent. The
present application was filed by the respondent in May, 2007. In the
circumstances the respondent shall be entitled for relief under Section
17 B from the date of the award. The respondent fulfills the requirement
for grant of relief under Section 17 B of the Act.

14.

For the foregoing reasons the application is allowed and the

petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or minimum wages
revised from time to time whichever is higher from 10th May, 2005 the
date of award. Arrears of last drawn wages or minimum wages be paid
within eight weeks. Petitioner shall continue to pay last drawn wages or
minimum wages whichever is higher by the 15th of every English
Calendar month in future during the pendency of the writ petition. The
respondent/workman is also directed to give an undertaking that in
case the writ petition is allowed, the difference in last drawn wages and
minimum wages shall be refunded/repaid by the respondent workman
to the petitioner within such time as shall be permitted by this Court.

CM 7856/2007 in WP(C) 5589 of 2006

The undertaking be filed by the respondent/ workman within four
weeks. The application is disposed of with these directions.
