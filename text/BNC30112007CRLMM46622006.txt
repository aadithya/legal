Instant petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
made by

the petitioner an accused in case FIR

No.2/1987 -CBI (SIU-X) dated 26th May, 1987, seeks
quashing of (a) proceedings against him based on a
charge sheet, filed on 18th November, 1993 and (b)
Crl.M.C. No.4662/2006

Page 1 of 10

order dated 25th November, 1993 whereby cognizance
of alleged offences was taken against him.
2.

The facts in brief are that an amount of
Rs.3.75 crore was advanced to M/s Keming Tools Co.
Ltd.

by C.V. Madan, erstwhile Branch Manager of

State Bank of Patiala, Janakpuri, Delhi without any
appraisal and sanction of competent authority. Later,
the assistance of the petitioner was allegedly sought
by M/s Keming Tools Co. Ltd.

for regularization of

the said loan and with that end in view an amount of
Rs.10,002/- was paid to the petitioner by co-accused
Satish Kumar Chopra. On an inquiry being held into
the transaction, based on the report of such inquiry,
a

FIR

No.2/1987

-CBI

(SIU-X)

under

Sections

120B/420/468/471 IPC was registered against C.V.
Madan and others. The petitioner was however, not
named in such FIR. In the course of investigation,
co-accused

S.K.

Chopra

was

arrested

and

a

disclosure made by him led to the arrest of the
petitioner on 12th May, 1988. A charge sheet

was

eventually filed by CBI on 23rd December, 1989 in FIR
Crl.M.C. No.4662/2006

Page 2 of 10

No.2/1987

-CBI

(SIU-X)

under

Sections

120B/420/468/471 IPC read with Section 5(2) and
5(1) (d) against C.V. Madan and others.

The

petitioner was not named as accused in that charge
sheet.

Subsequently, on 27th November, 1992 a

sanction from the Manager, Reserve Bank of India,
Kanpur was obtained to prosecute the petitioner
under

relevant

provisions

of

the

Prevention

of

Corruption Act, 1988 and another charge sheet came
to be filed on 18th November, 1993 naming the
petitioner as one of the accused therein. On filing of
such

charge

sheet,

the

court

concerned

took

cognizance of the offences on 25th November, 1993
and summoned

all the accused including the

petitioner to appear and face trial.
3.

Pursuant to summons, the petitioner made his
appearance before the court concerned.

On 11th

April, 1994 he filed an application pleading that he
could not be proceeded against

for commission of

alleged offences in view of bar of limitation.
application remained
Crl.M.C. No.4662/2006

pending

This

for quite sometime
Page 3 of 10

and the same was ultimately dismissed by the learned
Trial Court on 29th November, 2004.

On petitioner

raising the plea of limitation, an application for
condonation of delay was filed on behalf of

CBI on

25th July, 1996 but that application was later not
pressed and the same was accordingly dismissed by
the learned Trial Court on 29th November, 2004.
4.

Learned counsel appearing
argued

that

the

Niranjan Nagia

petitioner

for the petitioner

and

his

were charge sheeted

co-accused
for offences

under Sections 163/164 IPC only and as these
offences
extending

were

punishable

with

imprisonment

to one year and three years respectively

the petitioner could not have been proceeded against
beyond a period of three years and the learned Trial
Court could not have taken cognizance of the said
offences in view of bar of limitation as contained in
Section

468(1)(c)

Cr.P.C.

It

was

accordingly

contended that taking of cognizance by the learned
Trial Court beyond the period of limitation was bad in
law and therefore the order in that regard is liable to
Crl.M.C. No.4662/2006

Page 4 of 10

be quashed.
5.

From the order dated 29th November, 2004 of
the learned Special Judge, it appears

that the

petitioner's challenge to his prosecution on the
ground of

limitation was turned down in view of

Sections 163 and 164 of IPC being repealed

by

Section 31 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
(49 of 1988)(for short `the PC Act') and corresponding
provisions (Sections 9 and 10)

thereof coming into

force, in respect of which no bar of limitation applied
. The learned Special Judge held the view that as at
the time of filing of the charge sheet and taking of
cognizance, the PC Act had come into force and as in
view of sentence provided under Sections 9 and 10 of
that Act bar of limitation as prescribed under Section
368 (1) Cr.P.C. did not apply, the cognizance of
alleged offences could be taken at any time even
beyond a period of three years.
6.

The

short

question

consideration in the present

thus
petition is

raised

for

: whether

Sections 163 and 164 of the Indian Penal Code,
Crl.M.C. No.4662/2006

Page 5 of 10

which were in force at the time of commission of
alleged offences as also when commission of

such

offences came to the knowledge, would continue to
apply even after repeal thereof by Section 31 of the PC
Act or the petitioner could be prosecuted under
corresponding provisions contained in Sections 9 and
10 of the PC Act?
7.

It is beyond dispute that if the petitioner was
to be tried

for offences punishable under Sections

163 and 164 of the IPC, prosecution would

stand

barred by limitation as no cognizance could be taken
after expiry of

period of three years

in terms of

Section 368 (1) (c) of Cr.P.C. It is admitted position
that at the relevant time when the alleged offences
were committed

or even upto the time when the

commission of such offences came to the knowledge,
Sections 163 and 164 IPC held the field and the PC
Act was yet to be enacted. A greater punishment was
prescribed under Sections 9 and 10 of the PC Act for
the offences which were earlier punishable under
Sections 163 and 164 IPC.
Crl.M.C. No.4662/2006

Second limb of Clause (1)
Page 6 of 10

of Article 20 of the Constitution provides that

“no

person shall be subjected to a penalty greater than
that which might have been inflicted under the law
in force at the time of commission of the offences”.
In

a

series

Maharashtra

of

decisions

Vs.

Kaliar

including
Koil

State

of

Subramaniam

Ramaswamy; AIR 1977 SC 2091, G.P. Nayyar Vs.
State (Delhi Administration); AIR 1979 SC 602 and
State Through

CBI, Delhi Vs. Gian Singh; AIR

1999 SC 3450, the Supreme Court has consistently
ruled that being a part of fundamental right of every
person, nobody can be subjected to greater penalty
than what

the law prescribed and no ex-post facto

legislation is permissible providing for a more severe
punishment. To apply Sections 9 and 10 of PC Act
prescribing greater punishment as compared to the
ones

provided

under Sections 163 and 164 of the

Indian Penal Code, in the facts of the given case,
would clearly run counter to the mandate of the
second limb of Clause (1) of Article 20 of the
Constitution. Thus,
Crl.M.C. No.4662/2006

notwithstanding

repeal of

Page 7 of 10

Sections 163 and 164 of the Indian Penal Code, the
offences

allegedly

would continue

committed

by the

to be triable

petitioner

and punishable

thereunder only and Sections 9 and 10 of the PC Act
would not get attracted. Legal position in this regard
would not change simply because by the time the
charge sheet against the petitioner is filed, the PC
Act had come into operation.

The learned Special

Judge was thus clearly in error in finding that the
offences allegedly committed by the petitioner under
Sections 163 and 164 IPC, would become punishable
under Sections 9 and 10 of the PC Act by virtue of
that Act coming into force on the day of filing of the
charge sheet.

Sh. Harish Gulati, learned

counsel

appearing for the CBI fairly conceded and rightly so,
that

inspite of sanction

for prosecution of the

petitioner accorded under Sections 9 and 10 of the
PC Act and that Act coming into operation

on the

date of filing of the charge sheet, he is liable to be
tried for

offences

punishable under Sections 163

and 164 IPC only. The impugned order, the charge
Crl.M.C. No.4662/2006

Page 8 of 10

sheet as well as the proceedings qua the petitioner
are, in the circumstances, liable to be quashed.
8.

Admittedly,

the charge sheet against

petitioner was, in the present case, filed
period of three years from the date

the

beyond a

of commission of

alleged offences as also from the date of knowledge.
Though, an application for condonation of delay in
filing the charge sheet had been filed but the same
was later not pressed and therefore, it was disposed
of as such.

The delay in filing the

charge sheet

beyond the prescribed period of limitation was thus
not condoned by the learned Special Judge.
the

Under

circumstances, no cognizance of the offences

punishable under Sections 163 and 164 IPC could
have been taken against the petitioner by the learned
Special Judge in view of bar of limitation under
Section 368 (1) (c) Cr.P.C.
9.

In the ultimate analysis, the order dated 25th
November, 1993 whereby

cognizance of alleged

offences was taken against the petitioner as also the
charge sheet and all proceedings pursuant thereto
Crl.M.C. No.4662/2006

Page 9 of 10

qua

the petitioner

are quashed.

The petition is

disposed of accordingly.
