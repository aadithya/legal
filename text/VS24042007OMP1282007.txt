VIPIN SANGHI, J.
1.

The

parties

had

entered

into

an

agreement

which

contained an arbitration clause in Clause No. 67.3 (b) of the contract.
Clause 67.3 (b) (i) reads as follows:
“Any dispute in respect of which :
b) amicable settlement has not been reached within the
period stated in sub clause 67.2 shall be finally settled:
OMP No. 128/2007

Page No. 1 of 9

i) by arbitration in accordance with the Indian
Arbitration Act, 1940, or any statutory amendment
thereof. The arbitral tribunal shall consist of 3
arbitrators, one each to be appointed by the employer
and the Contractor, and the third to be appointed by
the Ministry of Surface Transport.”
2.

Since disputes arose between the parties the applicants

nominated one arbitrator.

Respondent No.1 also nominated the

second arbitrator. However, the Ministry of Surface Transport failed to
nominate

the

third

arbitrator.

The

applicants

filed

Arbitration

Application No. 178/2004 in this Court. The said application was
allowed on 20.9.2004 and the Court appointed Mr. Justice R.P.Sethi, a
retired Judge of Supreme Court of India as the Presiding Arbitrator to
adjudicate upon the disputes between the parties.
3.

The arbitration proceedings were undertaken before the

Tribunal thus constituted and arguments were heard on 30.11.2006. It
is stated that the arbitral Tribunal reserved its award in the two
references before it. Unfortunately the Presiding Arbitrator, Mr. Justice
R.P.Sethi, (Retired) expired on 17.1.2007 before the award was made
and punished.
4.

The applicants sent a communication on 22.1.2007 to

respondent No.2 i.e. the Director

General, Ministry of Surface

Transport to appoint the Presiding Arbitrator within 30 days of

the

receipt of the notice. A copy of the notice has been placed on record.
In the notice the applicants also stated that “In case of your failure to

OMP No. 128/2007

Page No. 2 of 9

appoint the 3rd arbitrator within the notice period of 30 days, my client
shall proceed further in the matter to get the 3rd arbitrator appointed
in accordance with law.”
5.

A copy of this communication was also sent to the

Chairman, NHAI and the other two members of the Arbitral Tribunal.
This communication was sent by Registered post and as per the postal
certificate placed on record, it was delivered to the addressee on
23.1.2007.
6.

Admittedly, the Ministry of Surface Transport did not

nominate the

third arbitrator within the 30 days period and

consequently, the applicant filed the present application. It is
submitted by learned counsel for

petitioners that the petition was

initially styled as an Arbitration Application under Section 15 read with
Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (The Act),
but on account of the objection raised by the Registry, it was
described as an Original Miscellaneous Petition (OMP) under Section
15 of the Act and reference to section 11 (6) of the Act was deleted
from the index, the title of the petition as also the supporting affidavit
filed with the petition. Even the statutory charges of Rs.1000/- payable
on an Application under Section 11(6) of the Act was detached before
refiling of the petition.
7.

This petition was filed in this court on 03-03-07 and it

came up before the court for the first time on 09-03-07. Appearance

OMP No. 128/2007

Page No. 3 of 9

was put on behalf of respondent No.1, i.e., NHAI on the same day, and
notice was issued to respondent No.2 returnable on 29-03-07. On 2903-07, counsel for the respondents made a statement that on 09-0307 the Ministry of Surface Transport had nominated the third
arbitrator.

Upon enquiry, it was informed that he was one Shri

D.P.Gupta, a retired engineer. A copy of his appointment letter dated
9.3.2007, along with a copy of a communication dated 14.3.2007
issued by Shri D.P.Gupta, taking note of his appointment, has been
handed over in Court.
8.

Counsel for the petitioner submits that on account of

failure of respondent No.2 to nominate the arbitrator within 30 days of
issuance of the notice dated 22-01-07, which was received on 23-0107, and even till the date of filing of the present petition on 03-03-07,
the Ministry of Surface Transport had lost its right to nominate the
third arbitrator and the nomination of the third arbitrator made by
respondent No.2 on 09-03-07 is of no avail. He submits that the said
nomination is incompetent in view of the decisions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Datar Switchgears Ltd., JT 2000 (Suppl.2) SC
226 and a Full Bench decision of this court in HBHL-VKS (J.V.) Vs.
Union of India and others, 2007(1) Arb. LR 252 (Delhi) (FB).
9.

He refers to para 19 of the decision in Datar Switchgears

Ltd. (supra) and para 40 of the decision in HBHL-VKS (J.V.) supra). In
relation to Section 11(6) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act it has

OMP No. 128/2007

Page No. 4 of 9

been held that if a party demands the opposite party to appoint an
arbitrator and the opposite party does not make an appointment
within 30 days of the demand, the right to appoint does not get
automatically forfeited after expiry of 30 days, if the opposite party
makes an appointment even after 30 days of the demand, but before
the first party has moved the court under Section 11. Therefore, in a
case arising under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, if
the opposite party has not made the appointment within 30 days of
demand, the right to make appointment is not forfeited but continues,
but the appointment has to be made before the former files an
application under Section 11 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act
seeking appointment of an arbitration.

Only then, the right of the

opposite party ceases.
10.

Counsel for the respondents submits that the present

petition is one under Section 15 of the Act, whereas the aforesaid
decisions have been rendered in relation to Section 11 of the Act. He
submits that the said judgments have no applicability in the facts of
the present case. He also submits that under sub-clause 67.3 (b)(iv)
the time provided for making the substitute appointment is 60 days
and not 30 days.

It is also submitted by the counsel for the

respondents that the petitioners had deliberately misdirected the
notice dated 22-01-07 by addressing the same to the Director General
in the Ministry of Surface Transport which was the reason for some

OMP No. 128/2007

Page No. 5 of 9

delay in nomination of the arbitrator.
11.

The argument of the respondents that the aforesaid

judgments do not apply to the facts of the present case does not
appear to be correct. Section 15 of the Act merely states that where
the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, “a substitute arbitrator shall
be appointed according to the rules that were applicable to the
appointment of the arbitrator being replaced.” This only means that
when the arbitrator nominated as the nominee of the Ministry of
Surface Transport lost his mandate on 17.1.2007 (in this case on
account of his demise), the said Ministry of Surface Transport became
entitled to nominate another arbitrator in his place by following the
same procedure as is prescribed, by virtue of Section 15(2) of the Act.
12.

It is only Section 11 of the Act which provides the

procedure for appointment of an arbitrator by the Chief Justice or his
designate. Section 15 does not provide for the procedure to approach
the Chief Justice, but merely states that the same procedure would
apply for substituting the vacancy that is created on account of
termination of the mandate of an arbitrator, as is prescribed in the
rules applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator.
13.

The petition as originally filed under Sections 15 and 11(6)

of the Act was correctly filed by the petitioner and it is apparent that
on account of an erroneous office objection, the petitioner deleted the
reference to Section 11(6) of the Act.

OMP No. 128/2007

However, the nomenclature

Page No. 6 of 9

used by the petitioner to describe this as an O.M.P and not an
arbitration application (A.A), and the omission to mention Section
11(6) of the Act is not decisive or fatal to the maintainability of this
petition. Therefore, in my view, the decisions cited by the petitioner
squarely apply in the facts and circumstances of the present case.
14.

Coming to the next argument of the Respondent, clause

67.3 (b)(iv) of the contract reads as follows:

15.

“If one of the parties fail to appoint its arbitrators in
pursuance of sub para (i) above, within 60 days after
receipt of the notice of the appointment of its
arbitrators by the other party, the Ministry of Surface
Transport shall appoint the arbitrator.”
By the said clause, 60 days time is provided to the second

contracting party for nominating an arbitrator, where the first party
has nominated an arbitrator.

Upon failure of the second party to

nominate an arbitrator within 60 days, the Ministry of Surface
Transport is authorised to nominate the arbitrator.
16.

It is important to note that no time is prescribed in sub-

clause 67.3(b)(iv) within which Ministry of Surface Transport is to
appoint the third arbitrator upon failure of one of the parties to appoint
an arbitrator within 60 days. If the intention of the parties was to
provide the Ministry of Surface Transport 60 days to nominate the
third arbitrator, the same would have been so specifically provided.
That not having been done, to my mind, the implication has to be that
the parties did not agree to give 60 days to the Ministry of Surface
Transport to nominate the third arbitrator in a case covered by clause
OMP No. 128/2007

Page No. 7 of 9

67.3(b)(iv).

In any case, on facts the present is not a case falling

under clause 67.3(b)(iv). It is a case falling under clause 67.3(b)(i) by
virtue of Section 15(2) of the Act. Clause 67.3 (b) (i) states; “The
arbitral tribunal shall consist of 3 arbitrators, one each to be appointed
by the employer and the Contractor, and the third to be appointed by
the Ministry of Surface Transport.”
17.

Since no time is prescribed within which the nomination of

the third arbitrator ought to have been made, the same should have
been made within 30 days.
18.

The submission that the notice dated 22-01-07 was

misdirected also does not appear to be correct.

Counsel for the

petitioner points out that in fact, there is no Ministry of Surface
Transport in existence any more, and the said ministry has been
reorganised as the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways
and the concerned department is the Department of Road Transport
and Highways. He submits that in its letter dated 09-03-07 issued by
respondent No.2 communicating appointment of Shri D.P. Gupta, copy
whereof was delivered in court, it has nowhere been asserted that the
appointment could not be made earlier on account of the notice dated
22-01-07 being addressed to a wrong authority.

Counsel for the

petitioner points out that only after the court had issued notice on this
petition on 09-03-07, respondent No.1 appears to have lobbied with
respondent No.2 to issue the communication dated 09-03-07.

OMP No. 128/2007

19.

Since the Ministry of Surface Transport failed to do the

needful within the period of 30 days of receipt of the notice and it also
did not make the appointment till the time the present petitioner was
filed in this court by the petitioner, in my view the said authority lost
its right to make the appointment of the third arbitrator.

The

nomination made vide communication dated 9-3-07 of Shri D.P.Gupta
is, therefore, of no avail.
20.

Considering the fact that earlier Mr. Justice R.P. Sethi

(Retd.) Judge of the Hon'ble Supreme Court had been appointed by
this court, as the third Arbitrator, I now appoint Mr. Justice R.C. Lahoti
(Retd.), former Chief Justice of India as the third and presiding
arbitrator of the Arbitral Tribunal. This Order would, however, take
effect upon the petitioner depositing the fee of Rs.1,000/- as is
prescribed under the Rules on an application under Section 11(6) of
the Act. The petition is accordingly disposed of. The parties are left to
bear their respective costs.
