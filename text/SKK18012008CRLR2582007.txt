SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.
1. M/s. ZZ Zippers Private Limited applied for a loan of Rs.13.00 lakh
to the Punjab & Sind Bank, Rajouri Garden Branch, New Delhi. The
application was forwarded to the zonal office for sanction and is
alleged to have been sanctioned under the discretionary power of
the DGM.

However, on 19.12.2001, the Manager at the zonal

office intimated by a note annexed that it had come to the
knowledge of the bank that the brother and sister-in-law of the
Directors of M/s. ZZ Zippers Private Limited are partners in
another firm M/s. Pinky Zip against which cases are pending
before DRT and thus advise had been given not to release the
loan and the title deeds of the property to the Branch Manager.

This note is stated to have been seen by the Senior Manager, DGM
and was finally put up to the petitioner who endorsed it as seen on
26.12.2001.

The petitioner was the General Manager of the

branch.
2. It is the case of the petitioner that the matter in issue is within the
powers of the DGM and was not required to be put up before the
General Manager.

The letter dated 3.1.2002 addressed to the

petitioner

a

making

reference

to

the

earlier

letter

dated

31.12.2001 and the discussion on 1.1.2002 was found neither
available in the original records nor carried any posting mark. A
meeting was held on 16.1.2002 in the Office of the Zonal
Manager, which is alleged to be fabricated as it is the case of the
petitioner that he was not present at the meeting and the minutes
of the meeting does not bear the signature of the petitioner.
3. The Special Judge vide order dated 17.11.2006 framed charges
against the petitioner under Sections 120-B/420/467/468/471 IPC
read with Section 13(1)(d) & 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption
Act.

This order was challenged by the petitioner by filing the

Criminal Revision Petition No.1/2007 where the petitioner pleaded
that the plea of the petitioner that the letter dated 3.1.2002 was
not even received by the petitioner until 18.5.2002 and thus the
assumption on the basis of which the charge was framed against
the petitioner of approval of sanctioning of limit on 3.1.2002 as
recorded in the minutes of the meeting dated 3.1.2002 are
incorrect. The learned single Judge of this Court found that since
the trial court had recorded the submissions with regard to the

Crl. Rev. P. No.258 of 2007

Page No.2 of 5

receipt of the letter dated 3.1.2002 on 18.5.2002 as well as the
contention of the petitioner of non-participation in the minutes of
the meeting dated 16.1.2002, the order framing charges should
have specifically dealt with these aspects.

This was so as the

order for framing charges is a reasoned one dealing with various
contentions.

Thus, by the order dated 23.2.2007 the order

framing charges was set aside and the Special Judge was directed
to consider the question of charges relating the petitioner in
accordance with the law.
4. Thereafter on hearing learned counsels for the parties, the
impugned order dated 28.3.2007 has been passed framing
charges.
5. Learned counsel for the petitioner, once again, referred to the
same plea and the manner in which the trial court has dealt with
the matter. The trial court found that there were two letters of
3.1.2002 and the first letter (D-45) is the one which dealt with the
matter which showed that the party had been allowed to avail the
limit as per sanction after discussing with the petitioner. It was
this letter which was the subject matter of discussion in the loan
committee meeting held on 16.1.2002.
6. The second letter of the same date is also written by the Branch
Manager and addressed to the Zonal Manager, stating that the
credit limit had been allowed to the party after permission and the
action should be confirmed in view of the discussion with the
petitioner. The trial court, thus, found that even if this letter had
been received by the zonal office on 18.5.2002, the letter clearly

Crl. Rev. P. No.258 of 2007

Page No.3 of 5

stated that it was with the permission of the petitioner.

Mr.

Shailender Chawla (PW-21), who is from the zonal office has
stated in his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. that the matter
was discussed in the loan committee meeting held on 16.1.2002
where it was decided to confirm the Branch Manager action and
all the members had signed on the last page except the
petitioner.
7. The other witnesses of the bank who appeared also supported the
stand about the presence of the petitioner at the meeting and the
role played by him.
8. The order has to be, in my considered view, appreciated on the
touch stone of principles settled by the Apex Court relating to the
framing of charges. It is trite to say that no detailed scrutiny of
evidence had to take place but there should be material on
record, which is sufficient so that the prima facie case can be
made to proceed against the accused. In fact, in Omwati Vs. State
2001 SCC (Cri) 685 the Apex Court cautioned the High Courts
against interference at the initial stage of framing of charges
merely on hypothesis imagination and far fetched reasons. This
reasoning applies more so where the action is taken under the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 as held by the Apex Court in
State of MP Vs. Ram Singh 2000 SCC (Cri) 886.
9. Learned counsel for the petitioner, once again, sought to draw the
attention of this Court to the material on record including the
circular dated 15.11.1999 about the verbal permissions of
sanctions and recall of credit facilities where such practice was not

Crl. Rev. P. No.258 of 2007

Page No.4 of 5

approved of oral instructions. Learned counsel for the petitioner
also sought to emphasise that there is contradiction in the
statement of PW-21, Shailender Chawla.
10.On hearing learned counsels for the parties, it is obvious that
merely because only the note dated 26.12.2001 contains the
signature of the petitioner would be no ground not to frame
charges against the petitioner. The said documents is one of the
documents showing the role played by the petitioner.

The

evidence of the bank employees shows that the petitioner
presided over the meeting of 16.1.2002 though he had not signed
the minutes. There is no reason why the name of the petitioner
would be so recorded or the witnesses would so depose against
the petitioner as there was no animosity. In any case the stage is
only of framing of charges and there is sufficient material for the
same. It will always be open for the petitioner to establish during
the course of trial that he had no role to play. The question of
participation in the meeting and the receipt of the letter dated
3.1.2002 has also been dealt with in extenso by the trial court
while framing the charges and thus that aspect has also been
examined.
11.In view of all the aforesaid reasons, I see no reason to interfere
with the impugned order of framing of charges.
12.Dismissed.
