JUDGMENT
MANMOHAN, J:

1.

The issue that arises for consideration in the present two writ

petitions is the scope of judicial review of a charge-sheet by the Central
Administrative Tribunal and by this

Court in writ jurisdiction under

Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.
2.

Petitioner, Govind Prajapati and Bhaskar Joshi, have filed the

present writ petitions being W.P. (C) Nos. 2341 and 2342 of 2008
seeking quashing of the impugned judgment and orders of the Central
Administrative Tribunal (for short “the Tribunal”) dated 19th February,
2008 passed in O.A. No. 1781/2007 and O.A. No.1881/2007 as well as
for allowing of reliefs claimed in the above Original Applications filed
before the Tribunal. In essence, the Petitioners seek revocation of their
suspension, quashing of inquiry proceedings initiated against them and
annulment of appointment of the Inquiry Officer. Since common issues
of fact and law arise in both the writ petitions and further as they have
been disposed of by a common judgment and order of the Tribunal, we
are disposing of these two writ petitions by way of a common judgment
and order.
3.

Briefly stated, the material facts of these cases are that the two

Petitioners who were working as empanelled casual artist and part-time

and Actor

Information and Broadcasting.
advertisement

According to the Petitioners, the

in the Employment News contained a clause for

relaxation of qualifications. The Selection Committee of the Song and
Drama Division recommended the Petitioners for selection in the Song
and Drama Division with two

years’ probation. Subsequently,

Petitioners were confirmed in their respective posts.
4.

The Respondents in their reply filed before the Tribunal have

stated that while giving a response to an application filed under the
Right to Information Act it was discovered by the Department that as
many as 17 officials had been appointed in the years 1998-99, 19992000 and 2000-2001 without fulfilling the requisite qualifications
prescribed for the post. It was also found that some of the selected
candidates had given wrong factual information about their caste or
submitted fake caste (ST) certificate. The Respondents further averred
that the then Director in the Song and Drama division, Shri Prem
Matiyani who was connected with the said irregular and fraudulent
appointments obstructed the correct information from being given under
the Right to Information Act. The Respondents also stated in their reply
that on a detailed scrutiny of Petitioners’ applications, a Deputy Director
in the Respondents’ Headquarters found that the Petitioner in W.P.(C)
CWP 2341 & 2342 of 2008

page 3 of 10

No. 2341 of 2008 i.e. Govind Prajapati did not possess the professional
qualification and experience required for the post of Lineman (Sound) to
which he was appointed and he also did not possess the wireman’s
licence required for the post. Similarly, in the case of the Petitioner,
Bhaskar Joshi in W.P.(C) No. 2342 of 2008, the Deputy Director found
that the said Petitioner did not possess the professional qualification
required for the post of Actor. According to the respondents a large
number of irregular and illegal appointments had taken place in the
Song and Drama Division during the tenure of Shri Prem Matiyani as
Director.
5.

In the month of August, 2007, both the Petitioners were placed

under suspension and a separate memorandum was issued to each of
them. Simultaneously, an Inquiry Officer was also appointed.

However, the

Tribunal in its well reasoned order has, keeping in view the Supreme
Court’s guidelines for quashing of a charge-sheet, rightly held that any
interference by it at the stage of issuance of the charge-sheet would
amount to pre-judging the issue as the correctness of the charges are
yet to be looked into by the disciplinary authority. The Tribunal has
further directed the Respondents to complete the inquiry within a time
bound manner after giving full opportunity to the Petitioners to defend

7.

Counsel for the Petitioners in the present proceedings sought to

urge that the statement of imputation did not contain any allegation in
support of the articles of charge against the Petitioners but only
contained allegations against the then Director, Shri Prem Matiyani.
The Petitioner, after referring to the statement of imputation in detail,
made the following submissions :

(i) It would be inconceivable that a Lineman or an
Actor could be responsible for the appointment of
Shri Prem Matiyani, the then Director, S&DD as
Selection Committee Chairman. In fact, a Lineman
or an Actor could not have had any say in the
constitution of the Selection Committee.
(ii) Similarly, the Petitioners could not have had any
say in the alleged non compliance of instructions of
the Ministry of Finance or non obtaining of the
approval prior to filling up of the direct recruitment
post.
(iii) The Charge-sheet is wholly based on surmises
and conjecture.

There is

no indication or

background facts which would even prima facie
indicate collusion of the Petitioner.
(iv) Once the Selection Committee had voluntarily
granted the relaxation, that issue could not be gone
into.

Before we proceed further, we may extract the Article of Charge

and the Statement of Imputation of misconduct issued to one of the
Petitioners (namely in W.P.(C) 2341 of 2008) :

Statement of article of charge against Shri Govind
Prajapati, Lineman (Sound), Song & Drama Division,
New Delhi.
Article of charge: Shri Govind Prajapati does not fulfill
the professional qualifications required for the post of
Lineman (Sound) in Song & Drama Division, Ministry of
Information & Broadcasting to which he was appointed
with effect from 29.05.2000.
But by utilizing his
association with authorities of Song & Drama Division he
managed to get called for interview, then selected and
appointed to the post of Lineman (Sound) at S&DD, New
Delhi in an irregular, manipulative and fraudulent
manner. Thus, he is liable for disciplinary action as per
Government of India Instruction No.2 below the Rule 11
of CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965.

Statement of imputations of misconduct in support
of the article of charge made against Shri Govind
Prajapati, Lineman (Sound), Song & Drama Division,
New Delhi.
Article of charge: Shri Govind Prajapati vide his
application dated nil applied to a post of Lineman
(Sound) at S&DD, New Delhi. In accordance with the
Recruitment Rules (RRs) for the post of Lineman
(Sound) in S&DD and advertisement issued as per the
said RRs, qualification of (1) Matriculation or its
equivalent and (2) Grade II Wireman’s license from an
institute recognized by the Government and (3) Practical
experience of not less than two years in
handling/installations Public Address System, Sound
CWP 2341 & 2342 of 2008

page 6 of 10

equipment and laying of cables etc. are essential. As per
his application he does not possess the qualifications
mentioned at item (2) and (3) above. However, he was
called for interview.
As per Ministry of I&B’s ID letter No.1/2(4)(98)-F(S)
dated 12.10.1998, Shri B.S. Biswas, then Joint Director
should have functioned as Section Committee Chairman.
But instead Shri Prem Matiyani, then Director, S&DD
function as the Selection Committee Chairman. Further,
the then Deputy Director (Admn.) in the S&DD Hqrs.
should have functioned as Appointing Authority as per
letter No. I-14013/1/85-Spl./Vig. Dated 24.04.1976.
Whereas, Shri Prem Matiyani, then Director, S&DD
functioned as Appointing Authority also approving his
own recommendations as Selection Committee
Chairman.
On the basis of the recommendations of the Selection
Committee, Shri Govind Prajapati was given offer of
appointment vide Memorandum No.A-12024/29/2000Admn.II dated 22.05.2000 and he joined the post on
29.05.2000.
In accordance with the Instructions of Ministry of
Finance circulated by the Min. of I&B vide OM No.G20011/5/99-B&A dated 17.08.1999, review of all vacant
posts were required to be taken by S&DD through the
AS&FA in the Min. of I&B and approval of Ministry of
Finance was required to be obtained before filling up the
direct recruitment posts. But this was not done and Shri
Govind Prajapati was appointed in gross violation of the
instructions of the Ministry of Finance.
The afore mentioned facts of the case indicate the full
details of irregularity indulged by Shri Govind Prajapati in
collusion with the authorities of S&DD for the irregular
appointment.
The above mentioned irregularities are enough to prove
the charge made against Shri Govind Prajapati and
proceed against him as per Government of India
Instruction No.2 below the Rule 11 of CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965.
CWP 2341 & 2342 of 2008

It is well settled that in the case of charges framed in a disciplinary

inquiry, a Tribunal or Court can interfere only if on the charges framed
read with imputation of charges, no misconduct or other irregularity
alleged can be said to have been made out or the charges framed are
contrary to law.

At the stage of issuance of the charge-sheet, the

Tribunal or Court has no jurisdiction to go into the correctness or the
veracity of the charges. The Tribunal or Court cannot take over the
functions of the disciplinary authority.

The truth or otherwise of the

charges is a matter for the disciplinary authority to go into. Indeed even
after the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings, if the matter comes
to Court or Tribunal, they have no jurisdiction to reappraise the evidence
or substitute the findings of fact recorded by thedisciplinary authority by
their own.
10.

In fact, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India

vs. Kunisetty Satyanarayana reported in (2006) 12 SCC 28 has held :

“14. The reason why ordinarily a writ petition should
not be entertained against a mere show-cause notice
or charge-sheet is that at that stage the writ petition
may be held to be premature. A mere charge-sheet
or show-cause notice does not give rise to any cause
of action, because it does not amount to an adverse
order which affects the rights of any party unless the
same has been issued by a person having no
CWP 2341 & 2342 of 2008

page 8 of 10

jurisdiction to do so. It is quite possible that after
considering the reply to the show-cause notice or
after holding an enquiry the authority concerned may
drop the proceedings and/or hold that the charges
are not established. It is well settled that a writ
petition lies when some right of any party is infringed.
A mere show-cause notice or chargesheet does not
infringe the right of anyone. It is only when a final
order imposing some punishment or otherwise
adversely affecting a party is passed, that the said
party can be said to have any grievance.
15. Writ jurisdiction is discretionary jurisdiction and
hence such discretion under Article 226 should not
ordinarily be exercised by quashing a show-cause
notice or charge-sheet.
16. No doubt, in some very rare and exceptional
cases the High Court can quash a charge-sheet or
show-cause notice if it is found to be without
jurisdiction or for some other reason if it is wholly
illegal. However, ordinarily the High Court should not
interfere in such a matter.”
11.

In the present case, we find that it is alleged that a large number

of unqualified persons have been appointed in the Song and Drama
Division of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. In today’s time
employment scams are not unknown. Since in the present case it is an
admitted position that the Petitioners did not possess the requisite
qualification for the post, yet they were called for interview, selected and
appointed. The matter certainly needs an indepth investigation as to
their role and involvement. On a reading of the charge-sheet or the
imputation of charge one cannot say that no case is made out against
the Petitioners or that the Respondents did not have the jurisdiction or
CWP 2341 & 2342 of 2008

page 9 of 10

power to issue the charge-sheet.

There may be certain aspects of the

charge-sheet which exclusively deal with or pertain to appointment of
Shri Prem Matiyani or the non-compliance of the instructions of Ministry
of Finance, but the same would not render the charge-sheet against the
Petitioners as nullity or render the enquiry futile.
12.

Consequently, in our view the Tribunal was right in dismissing the

applications filed by the Petitioners with a direction to the Respondents
to complete the inquiry within a period of six months after giving full
opportunity to the Petitioners to defend themselves. In our view the
judgment and order of the Tribunal does not call for any interference in
writ jurisdiction.
13.

Consequently, the present writ petitions being devoid of merit are

dismissed with costs of Rs.2,000/- (Rupees two thousand) to be paid
by each Petitioner.
