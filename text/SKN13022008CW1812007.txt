CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJIV KHANNA

ORDER
% 13.02.2008
I have examined the original file of JJ â€“ MCD. The petitioner claims right
to allotment of alternative commercial plot, on the basis that he was in
occupation of premises no.3014/XIV Sarai Khalil Sadar Bazar, Delhi and was
in occupation of 54'x13', 29'x13' and 11'x13' (open area). It is also the case of

the petitioner that at the time of CID Survey in 1975-76, the said property was
registered at serial no.158 in the name of his brother Mr. Abdul Waheb. The
petitioner states that Mr. Abdul Waheb was allotted alternate commercial site
only in respect of area 29'x13' (upstairs) and no allotment whatsoever in
respect of 54'x13', 29'x13' and 11'x13' (open area) was made to any person.
It is clear from the stand taken by the parties that offer of allotment of 15
sq.mts was made to the petitioner in 1980 which was rejected by the petitioner
on the ground that he is eligible for allotment of a bigger area.
The original file of MCD indicates that the case of the petitioner for
allotment of commercial plot in lieu of property no.3014/XIV was examined by
the Allotment Committee but rejected in view of the CID Survey report. The
petitioner was asked to produce documents to substantiate his claim that he
was actually carrying on business from property no.3014/XIV and was in
rightful occupation of the same. Some papers were filed to justify his claim but
the Allotment Committee was of the view that the request of the petitioner
should not be entertained for two reasons, firstly, even though the survey was
done by a law enforcement agency and was spread over more than a fortnight
or so but the petitioner's name did not find mention in the survey report in
respect of property no.3014/XIV and secondly, if any such request was
entertained it would open flood gates with applications being filed by doubtful

entities. It appears that the Allotment Committee in this regard had passed an
order in September, 1980.
The case was again re-examined and again by Order dated 27th
October, 1980 it was decided that in addition to the residential plot already
allotted to the petitioner he shall be allotted plot no.149 measuring 15 sq.mts.
at Shahazad Bagh, Delhi. The petitioner's claim for allotment of a commercial
plot of a bigger size was rejected on 27th October, 1980.
The petitioner again made representation for allotment of bigger plot.
However, his representations were rejected by the Allotment Committee way
back on 8th January, 1981 with the Allotment Committee reaffirming the earlier
decision. The file also reveals that the Vice Chairman, DDA had also rejected
the request of the petitioner way back on 23rd March, 1981 for allotment of a
bigger area.
Thereafter, in 1985 the files were sent from DDA to MCD as Slum and
JJ Department was transferred to MCD. It appears that thereafter, the
petitioner in 2004 again started making representations for having a fresh look
and re-examination of his case for allotment of a bigger commercial plot. MCD
without any specific reason and cause again started re-examining the matter
as if no decision had been taken in this matter earlier in 1980 and 81.

Having considered and examined the matter and perusing the original
files, I feel that the petitioner cannot succeed in the present matter as his
claim was rejected way back in 1980 and 1981 by the Allotment Committee.
This is clear from the file notings dated 12th September, 1980 and also from
the Minutes of the Allotment Committee dated 8th January, 1981. In case, the
petitioner had any grievance against allotment of a smaller plot he should
have approached this Court soon thereafter. Making repeated representations
does not explain the delay from 1981 till 2007 when the writ petition has been
filed. Repeated representations cannot explain delay spanning over 25 years.
It appears that some officers of MCD were trying to help out the petitioner and
detailed and copious notes were again prepared in 2004 to justify the claim of
the petitioner overlooking the fact that the claim of the petitioner had in fact
been examined by Allotment Committee in 1980 as well as in 1981 and
rejected for various reasons. It also appears that the petitioner had occupied
15 sq.mts of land which was allotted to him in the year 1980 without payment
of the costs as demanded. Slum and JJ Department in the year 2004 started
eviction proceedings for unauthorized occupation of the said plot against the
petitioner and thereupon the petitioner started making representations and
raised his claim for allotment of a bigger plot. It may be noted here that the
petitioner did not make payment for 15 sq.mts of plot which was allotted to

him. MCD has already evicted the the petitioner from 15 sq.mts of plot and
has taken possession.
In view of the above stated facts, I do not find merit in the writ petition
and the same is accordingly dismissed.
