PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
At the outset I may note that the instant appeal

numbered as a Regular Second Appeal ought to have been
numbered as an Executing Second Appeal for the reason it lays
a challenge to an order passed by the learned Appellate Judge
upholding an order passed by the Executing Court dismissing
objections filed by the appellant herein.
2.

Order 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure is a complete

code dealing with execution of decrees and pertaining to a decree

page 1 of 11

for possession of immovable property, an order disposing of
objections to execution of the decree is appealable as a decree in
terms of Order 21 Rule 103. Just as an original decree is subject
to a first appeal and thereafter a regular second appeal, order
passed by an executing court pertaining to delivery of possession
of immovable property would be subject to Execution First Appeal
and thereafter Execution Second Appeal.
3.

Whether

at

all

a

question

of

law

arises

for

consideration in the instant case?
4.

Having gone through the record of the case I hold that

no question of law arises and hence the instant appeal is being
dismissed at the after notice stage itself.
5.

Relevant facts are that property bearing municipal

No.458-466, Gali No.8, Friends Colony, G.T. Road, Shahdara,
Delhi-32 admittedly belonged to M/s.Indian Sulphacid Industries
Ltd.
6.

Whereas said company continues to assert ownership

over the said property. Appellant asserts to the contrary.
7.

Undisputed position between the parties is that M/s.

Indian Sulphacid Industries Ltd. had inducted M/s. Sun Aluminium
Corporation

as

a

tenant

in

the said property and had

sought ejectment of the tenant. M/s. Indian Sulphacid Industries
Ltd. obtained a decree for ejectment against the tenant on
28.7.2005. The tenant M/s. Sun Aluminium Corporation litigated
page 2 of 11

right up to the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

On 8.1.2007 the

Petition For Special Leave To Appeal (Civil) No.12051/2006 filed
by M/s. Sun Aluminium Corporation versus Indian Sulphacid
Industries was disposed of with the following order :“Heard.

8.

The special leave petition is dismissed.
However, at this stage, counsel for the
petitioner prays that some time be granted to
the petitioner to vacate the premises. The
learned
counsel
appearing
for
the
caveator/respondent has no objection to some
reasonable time being granted to the
petitioner. Accordingly, we grant six months to
the petitioner to vacate the premises in
question subject to its filing the usual
undertaking to this effect in this Court within
four weeks from today. The petitioner shall
hand over the vacant and peaceful possession
of the premises in question to the respondent
on or before the expiry of six months.”
Relevant would it be to note that M/s. Sun Aluminium

Corporation admitted before the Hon'ble Supreme Court that it
was in possession of the tenanted premises and undertook to
vacate the same within 6 months from the date of the order i.e.
8.1.2007.
9.

Proceedings

between

the

appellant

and

the

respondent commenced when on 14.12.2006 respondent filed
objections under Order 21 Rule 97 read with Order 101 CPC
stating that the decree against M/s. Sun Aluminium Corp. could
not be executed to evict the appellant from the property.

It

would be interesting to note that the objections to the decree
page 3 of 11

were filed on 14.12.2006 and the tenant M/s. Sun Aluminium
Corporation gave the undertaking before the Hon'ble Supreme
Court on 8.1.2007.
10.

It was stated in the objections that the appellant had

purchased the property in question vide registered sale deed
dated 6.4.2005 executed by one Rajinder Kumar Gupta for a
valuable consideration of Rs.7.4 lacs.

It was stated that

Rajinder Kumar Gupta was in actual physical possession of the
property having acquired ownership rights thereto under
documents dated 17.2.1999 executed in his favour by one Mr.
Soni acting on behalf of M/s. Indian Sulphacid Industries Ltd.
11.

Being relevant, a fact may be stated here. Prior to

filing objections, appellant had filed a civil suit predicating a
title to the same very property.

In proceedings relatable

thereto matter reached this Court in CM(M) No.1575/2006. On
4.10.2006 the CM(M) was disposed of by and under the
following order :“4.10.2006
Present:

Mr.Anil Gupta, Advocate for the
Petitioner
Mr.Pawan
Kumar
Aggarwal,Advocate
for the Respondent
No.1.
Caveat No.94/2006
Since learned counsel for respondent No.1 has

discharged.
CM No.13563/2006
Allowed subject to just exceptions.
CM(M) No.1575/2006 & CM No.13562/2006
After some hearing, it is agreed that
respondent no.1 would be free to take
possession of the disputed property from
tenant, but will not transfer, part with
possession or create any third party interest in
the suit property without leave and liberty of
the trial court.
Needless to say that the trial court will
endeavour to expedite the trial especially as
the contention of the learned counsel for
respondent no.1 is that the said respondent
has already had one round of litigation with
the tenant right up to this court.

12.

In view of the aforesaid, petition and the
application stand disposed of.”
Reverting back to the objections filed, considering

the documents filed by the appellant and the pleadings of the
appellant, noting inherent contradictions thereunder, learned
Executing Court dismissed the objections filed by the appellant
vide order dated 2.6.2006. The first appeal has been dismissed
by the Appellate Court vide order dated 25.8.2007.
13.

Learned

counsel

for

the

appellant

urges

that

Mr.V.K.Soni, Manager of the respondent had executed an
agreement to sell, irrevocable power of attorney, a general and
a special power of attorney in favour of Rajinder Kumar Gupta
and had received, on behalf of the respondent, valuable
page 5 of 11

consideration and thus, the respondent lost all right, title and
interest in the property. It is urged that Shri Rajinder Kr. Gupta
in turn executed a regular sale deed in favour of the appellant
on 6.4.2005 after receiving the sale consideration in sum of
Rs.7.4 lacs thereby conveying title to the appellant. With
reference to the decision reported as AIR 1969 SC 73 Seth Loon
Karan Sethiya Vs. Ivan E. John, 117 (2005) DLT 506 J.C.Mehra
Vs. Kusum Gupta it is urged that when a person conveys an
irrevocable power for valuable consideration the same cannot
be revoked. Thus, it is urged that the respondent cannot claim
having revoked the power of attorney executed by the
respondent in favour of Rajinder Gupta.
14.

Relying upon the decision reported as 2006 (87) DRJ

567 Vinod Singh Vs. Phutori Devi it is urged that an agreement
to sell affords

good

title

to

a

person

to

seek

specific performance of the property agreed to be sold.
15.

With reference to the decision reported as AIR 1998

SC 1754 Silverline Forum Pvt. Ltd. V. Rajiv Trust AIR 2002 SC
251 N.S.S. Narayan Sarma Vs. M/s. Gold Stone Exports Pvt. Ltd.
it is urged that since appellant was claiming an independent
title and not under the judgment debtor, learned Executing
Court was obliged to decide on the issue of title.
16.

Save and except the last 2 decisions pronounced by
page 6 of 11

Hon'ble Supreme Court, I need not trouble myself much on the
ration of law which can be culled out from the other decisions
for the reason before legal principles laid down therein can be
attracted, appellant would have to show a bona fide foundation
for the claim made by the appellant.
17.

Pertaining to the powers of an Executing Court and

scope of an objection resisting execution of a decree, relating
to immovable property, observations in para 12-13 of the
Supreme Court in Silverline's case may be noted. They read as
under :-

18.

“12-13.
It is clear that executing Court can
decide whether the resistor or obstructor is a
person bound by the decree and he refuses to
vacate the property. That question also
squarely falls within the adjudicatory process
contemplated in Order 21, Rule 97(2) of the
Code. The adjudication mentioned therein
need not necessarily involve a detailed
enquiry or collection of evidence. Court can
make the adjudication on admitted facts or
even on the averments made by the resistor.
Of course the Court can direct the parties to
adduce evidence for such determination if the
Court deems it necessary.”
It is true that under the Code of Civil Procedure

objections to execution of a decree relating to immovable
property have to be decided by the Executing Court and no
separate suit lies but as observed by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Silverline's case (supra) the court need not necessarily
hold detailed enquiry, for if on the admitted facts the matter
page 7 of 11

can be disposed of or if there are inherent contradictions in the
claim of the objector, objections can be disposed of noting the
same.
19.

In this connection I may note, as has often been

said, the real problem of a plaintiff commences when he
obtains a decree.

As would be noted hereinafter, inherent

contradictory pleadings are being resorted to by the appellant.
20.

In the objection petition filed, in para 5, pertaining to

possession, appellant has pleaded as under :“5. That Sh. Rajender Kumar Gupta S/o Sh.
Om Prakash Gupta had come into actual
physical possession of the property in question
bearing
No.458-466,
Indian
Sulphacid
Industries Compound, Gali No.8, Friends
Colony,
Shahdara,
Delhi-110032
on
17.02.1999 and the ownership and proprietary
rights remained with him till 06.04.2005 when
he executed the registered sale deed on
behalf of the company respondent No.1 dated
06.04.2005
for
a
consideration
of
Rs.7,40,000/- (Rupees seven lacs forty
thousand only). Thus the petitioner-claimant
became the absolute and exclusive owner of
the property in question and the respondent
no.2 M/s. Sun Aluminium Corporation situated
at 458-466, Indian Sulphacid Industries
Compound, Gali No.8, Friends Colony,
G.T.Road, Shahdara, Delhi had vacated the
property in question on 30.08.2006 and
handed over the vacant peaceful possession
to the petitioner-claimant. The petitioner has
been in actual physical possession of the
property in question since then.”
21.

It would be interesting to note that in the first part of

the paragraph, appellant has categorically stated that Rajinder
page 8 of 11

Kumar Gupta came into

actual physical possession of the

property. Though date when Rajinder Kumar Gupta came into
actual physical possession of the property has not been stated,
but it has to be before 6.4.2005 for the reason appellant has
stated that on 6.4.2005 he purchased the property from
Rajinder Kumar Gupta.
22.

But, in the latter half of para 5 of the objections it

has been pleaded by the appellant that M/s. Sun Aluminium
Corporation handed over possession of the property to the
appellant on 30.8.2006.
23.

Proceedings before the Hon'ble Supreme Court to

which reference has been made by me above thus assume
significance. Till

as

late

as

8.1.2007,

M/s.

Sun

Aluminium Corporation litigated with the respondent asserting
that the decree obtained by the respondent against it was bad
in law. M/s. Sun Aluminium Corporation sought to protect its
possession as a tenant even before the Hon'ble Supreme Court
till as late as 8.1.2007.
24.

It would not be out of place to mention that no

document has been filed pertaining to attornment by M/s. Sun
Aluminium Corporation in favour of either Rajinder Kumar
Gupta or the appellant.
25.

It is also interesting to note that the documents
page 9 of 11

dated 17.2.1999 referred to sale consideration being received
in cash. Even the sale deed relied upon by the appellant in his
favour refers to receiving of sale consideration in cash.
26.

The respondent has fought a bitter battle with the

tenant. The battle with the tenant commenced in the year
2004. If Rajinder Kumar Gupta had indeed acquired title to the
property under the agreement to sell and power of attorney on
17.2.1999, not a word has been explained as to what Rajinder
Kumar Gupta was doing in respect of the rent from the tenant.
27.

Not only that, the appellant gave an undertaking in

CM(M) No.1575/2006 on 4.10.2006 to the effect that let the
respondent take possession of the disputed property from the
tenant.
28.

But, what is relevant is that the

appellant admitted even before this Court on 4.10.2006 that
M/s. Sun Aluminium Corporation was a tenant in occupation of
the property in question.
29.

Surprisingly, as noted hereinabove, in para 5 of the

objections, after stating that Rajinder Kumar Gupta came into
actual physical possession of the property it was later on stated
that the tenant vacated the tenanted premises on 30.8.2006.
The said statement runs in the teeth of the statement made by

the

respondent would be free to take possession of the disputed
property from the tenant, meaning thereby, appellant admitted
that M/s. Sun Aluminium Corporation was in possession of the
premises. I may also note that later on the tenant retracted
from its undertaking before the Hon'ble Supreme Court stating
that it had surrendered possession to the appellant.
30.

It is obviously a case where the appellant and the

tenant are colluding to successfully raise obstacles in a
concerted manner against the respondent to frustrate the
execution of the decree.
31.

Facts on record prima facie establish a mala fide

attempt to continue with a futile litigation.
32.

I hold that on the aforenoted facts, view taken by

both courts below is legal and valid. No question of law arises
for consideration.
33.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

34.

Costs shall follow.
