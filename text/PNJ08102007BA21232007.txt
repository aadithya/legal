1.

Petitioner Sanjeev Hans who is in judicial custody since

23.5.2007

seeks

bail

in

FIR

No.519/06

under

Sections

308/304/323/325/34 IPC PS Dabri.
2.

Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that a

supplementary charge-sheet has been filed only on 24.7.2007
and learned Metropolitan Magistrate has listed the matter on
27.11.2007.

On said date, subject to all documents being

supplied to the accused persons, matter would be taken up for
consideration for committal proceedings.

Counsel urges that

page 1 of 3

keeping in view the offence which stand attracted in the FIR, the
matter is bound to be referred for a Session's trial.

That the

matter would then be assigned to a learned Additional Sessions
Judge. Thereafter, stage of arguments on framing charge would
be reached.

Counsel states that this would take considerable

time and hence petitioner should be released on bail.
3.

It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner

that police investigation has been completed.
4.

On merits, it is urged that the fight took place outside

the house of the petitioner and a cross FIR has been registered.
Counsel states that even a person from the side of the petitioner
received injuries.

Thus, since origin of the fight has become a

matter in issue, petitioner should be released on bail.
5.

Learned counsel for the State opposes the application

for bail very vehemently and submits that petitioner was the
principal assailant. The brutal assault on Rajeev resulted in his
death.
6.

On the origin of the dispute it may be noted that as per

the FIR, Mritunjya, son of the complainant was making payment to
labour outside his house.

Complainant heard some noise and

went outside to find the cause. He saw the petitioner with Rohit,
Hardeep and Pankaj, all armed with sticks attacking his son. That
his other sons viz. Rajeev, Niranjan and Arun also came out. Even

they were attacked.
7.

I note that Rajeev was hit 3 times on the temporal

region as per his MLC. He remained in the hospital for a few days.
He could not be saved. He died.
8.

The first bail application by the petitioner being Bail

Application No.4323/2006 was dismissed on 1.12.2006.
9.

Notwithstanding the fact that there has been a change

of circumstance viz. challan has been filed after 1.12.2006, I am
of the opinion that no case is made out to grant bail to the
petitioner at this stage for the reason the offence is serious. A
brutal assault was unleashed on Rajeev. 3 blows were directed
against his head. Petitioner is the principal assailant.
10.

The role of the petitioner has been graphically

described in the FIR. Keeping in view the gravity of the offence
first bail application was dismissed on 1.12.2006.
11.

The application for bail is dismissed.
