PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
Though different issues arise for consideration in

CRP No.168-70/2006 and C.R.P. No.394/2004, both petitions
are being disposed of together as they arise out of 2
interlocutory orders passed in the same suit.
2.

Respondents of both set of revision petitions are the

plaintiffs of the said suit. Petitioners of CRP No.394/2004 are
the legal heirs of late Shri Surat Singh (alias Surte) impleaded
as defendant No.1 in the suit and the principal contestant.
3.

Petitioners of CRP No.168-70/2006 are third parties,

subsequently impleaded as defendants in the suit.
4.

Whereas petitioners of CRP No.168-70/2006 are

aggrieved by the order dated 20.9.2005 allowing application
under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC filed by the plaintiffs to the suit and
as a consequence impleading petitioners as defendants in the
suit.
5.

The legal heirs of defendant No.1 i.e. petitioners to

CRP No.394/2004 challenge the order dated 7.7.2004 allowing
an application filed by the plaintiffs setting aside abatement of
the suit and on account of death of Surat Singh @ Surte
impleading his legal heirs i.e. petitioners of CRP No.394/2004
as defendants.
6.

To appreciate the issues raised in the 2 petitions

history of the dispute between the parties needs to be traced
out and this takes me back to the year 1986.
7.

Surat Singh @ Surte invoked the jurisdiction of the

revenue assistant under Section 85 of the Delhi Land Reforms
Act 1954 stating that he was entitled to a declaration that he
was a bhumidar of land comprised in khasra No.608 and 613 in
the revenue estate of village Malikpur Kohi @ Rangpuri, New
Delhi. Basis of his claim was that one Smt. Rampyari who was
the recorded bhumidar of the said land, being a widow, was
incapable of cultivating the same as she was issue-less and
had leased out the land to Surat Singh on batai (share
cropping) basis in the year 1961.

He further stated that

Rampyari died in the year 1978.

That there being no

successor-in-interest, he i.e. Surat Singh, continued to be in
cultivatory possession of the land and thus should be declared
a bhumidar thereof. He impleaded Risal Singh, Hukam Chand,
Hoshiar Singh, Samay Singh, Pratap Singh and Chand Singh,
apart from the Gaon Sabha of the village as respondents. The
6 private persons appeared and filed a written statement inter
alia

stating

that

Smt.Rampyari.

they

were the successor-in-interest

of

That Rampyari was in self cultivation of the

land and claim of Surat Singh was contrary to law.
8.

Risal Singh initiated proceedings under Section 84

of the Delhi Land Reforms Act for ejectment of Surat Singh
which were dismissed on 6.7.1988.
9.

The 6 private parties impleaded in the proceedings

under Section 85 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act 1954 stopped
appearing and hence were proceeded against ex-parte. Surat
Singh led ex-parte evidence.

Vide order dated 8.5.1992,

revenue assistant declared that Surat Singh was entitled to a
declaration that he was the bhumidar of the land comprised in
the 2 khasra numbers.

He directed that in the revenue

records, Surat Singh be recorded as the bhumidar of the 2
lands.
10.

None challenged the order dated 8.5.1992 before

the revenue authority constituted under the Delhi Land
Reforms Act 1954.
11.

On 7.5.1996, the sons of Risal Singh, impleaded as

respondent No.2 in the petition filed by Surat Singh under
Section 85 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act 1954 before the
revenue

assistant filed

a civil suit

seeking

declaration,

permanent injunction and consequential reliefs against Surat
Singh and a few other persons to whom Surat Singh was stated
to have transferred part of the land comprised in khasra
No.608 613.

Declaration sought was that the order dated

8.5.1992 passed by Shri B.K.Sehgal, Revenue Assistant was

null and void on the ground that a fraud was played upon the
Court, in that, service upon Risal Singh was procured with the
connivance of the process server and thus the order dated
8.5.1992 was a nullity. Injunction sought was to restrain Surat
Singh and the persons to whom he had transferred part of the
land from further selling the same.
12.

On being served with the summons in the suit filed

by the 5 sons of late Shri Risal Singh i.e. the respondents in the
2 set of captioned petitions, Surat Singh filed an application
under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC inter alia stating that by virtue of
the provisions of Section 185 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act
1954, the suit was barred. He pointed out that Section 185 of
the Delhi Land Reforms Act 1954 bars cognizance of suits,
applications or proceedings which are actionable before
authorities constituted under Schedule 1 of the Act and
pertains to a cause listed in column 3 of the said schedule. He
pointed out that proceedings relate to declaration of bhumidari
rights under Section 85 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act 1954 are
actionable only before the revenue assistant and appeal lies,
under

column

8

of

schedule

1

before

the

Deputy

Commissioner. Thus, it was prayed that the plaint be rejected.
13.

Pleas urged by Surat Singh were rejected and

application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC was dismissed by the

learned Civil Judge vide order dated 9.2.2000. Learned Judge
held that since the suit was based on allegations of fraud i.e.
that order dated 8.5.1992 passed by the revenue assistant was
a result of a report procured from the process server
evidencing

service

upon

Risal

Singh,

it

was

held

that

jurisdiction of the civil courts was not barred.
14.

Surat Singh challenged the order dated 9.2.2000 by

filing a revision petition in this Court numbered as C.R.P.
No.577/2000.

After issuing notice and granting stay of

proceedings before the learned Trial Judge, the petition was
adjourned from time to time for hearing. Surat Singh died on
19.6.2000. This fact was brought to the notice of the Court by
counsel for the respondents i.e. Rajinder Singh & Ors., the sons
of Risal Singh.

No action was taken by legal heirs of Surat

Singh to seek impleadment.

Matter was re-notified on

21.5.2001 and 14.8.2001 to enable legal heirs of Surat Singh to
seek impleadment in CRP No.577/2000. They failed to do so.
Vide order dated 19.12.2001 CRP No.577/2000 was dismissed
as having abated.
15.

After 1 year and nearly 9 months of the dismissal of

the CRP No.577/2000 on account of the same having abated,
applications were filed under Order 22 Rule 9 and Order 22
Rule 3 CPC seeking setting aside of the abatement and

impleadment of the legal heirs of the deceased petitioners.
The 2 applications were dismissed on 3.3.2003 holding that no
sufficient cause was shown by the legal heirs of late Surat
Singh to have the abatement set aside; that no valid reasons
were assigned as to why it took they nearly 2 years to seek
substitution on account of death of their father. The result was
that the 2 applications under Order 22 Rule 9 and Order 22
Rule 3 CPC were dismissed resulting in the order dated
9.2.2000 passed by the learned Civil Judge remaining intact.
16.

In

the

meanwhile,

in

the

suit

filed

by

the

respondents in the 2 captioned revision petitions, they moved
an application under Order 22 Rule 9 and Order 22 Rule 4 CPC
seeking impleadment of the legal heirs of deceased defendant
No.1 i.e. Surat Singh inter alia alleging that though knowledge
of the death of defendant No.1 was gained earlier, names of
the legal heirs came within their knowledge a few days prior to
filing of their application which I note was filed on 30.7.2002.
17.

The said application under Order 22 Rule 9 CPC for

setting aside the abatement and impleadment of legal heirs of
deceased Surat Singh was allowed vide order dated 7.7.2004.
18.

The said order has been challenged by the legal

heirs of Surat Singh by and under C.R.P. No.394/2004.
19.

In the meanwhile, Rajinder Singh & Ors. i.e. the

plaintiffs of the suit filed an application under Order 1 Rule 10
CPC praying that had it come to their knowledge that certain
parcels of land which were forming the subject matter of the
suit were further sold to Raj Roop, Yashpal and Jagdish i.e. the
petitioners of C.R.P. No.168-70/2006.

It was stated that the

said 3 persons would be affected by the decision in the suit.
Their impleadment was prayed for.
20.

The said application has been allowed vide order

dated 20.9.2005, the order under challenge by Raj Roop,
Yashpal and Jagdish in C.R.P. No.168-70/2006.
21.

Dr. Naipal Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners

of C.R.P. No.168-70/2006 urged that the suit filed by the sons of
Risal Singh was barred under Section 185 of the Delhi Land Reforms
Act and thus question of impleading any party in the suit did not
arise. Counsel urged that the learned Civil Judge was acting totally
without jurisdiction; that even entertainment of the plaint was
without jurisdiction; that all orders passed in the suit which was
without jurisdiction would obviously be without jurisdiction, was the
contention urged.
22.

Mr. S.S.Panwar, learned counsel for the petitioners of

C.R.P. 394/2004 i.e. the legal heirs of Surat Singh not only
supported Dr.Naipal Singh, Advocate but additionally urged that no
ground was made out to condone the delay in impleadment of the
legal heirs of Surat Singh and that on said short ground order dated

7.7.2004 was liable to be set aside and as a consequence the suit
filed by the respondents in the 2 captioned petitions be dismissed
as having abated.
23.

Issue as to when jurisdiction of civil court is barred

pertaining to a claim relating to agricultural land governed by the
provisions of the Delhi Land Reforms Act 1954 was the subject
matter of consideration before the Supreme Court in the decision
reported as AIR 1971 SC 2320, Hatti vs. Sunder Singh. It was held
that the jurisdiction of civil courts was barred under Section 185 of
the Delhi Land Reforms Act 1954 read with various items of the Ist
Schedule to the Act and that orders passed by the authorities under
the Act exercising primary jurisdiction were amenable to further
challenge before the appellate or revisional authorities constituted
under the Act.
24.

From

the

afore-noted

facts

pertaining

to

C.R.P.

No.577/2000, unfortunately, at this point of time, petitioners of both
revision petitions have been trapped in the pincers of procedural
laws. But, as would be noted by me hereinafter, right of petitioners
of C.R.P. No.168-70/2006 to invoke Order 7 Rule 11 CPC is still
intact and thus, it would be impermissible for me to exercise my
extraordinary jurisdiction to deal and thereafter decide the issue
whether the suit filed by the respondents of the 2 captioned
petitions is maintainable.
25.

Dismissal of C.R.P. No.577/2000 which challenged the

order dated 9.2.2000 dismissing application filed by Surat Singh
under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC has resulted in the said interlocutory
order not being set aside by this Court. But, the dismissal being on
account of the said revision petition as having abated, finality
cannot be attached to the issue whether the suit is barred or not
under Section 185 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act 1954.
26.

As held, in the opinion reported as AIR 1957 All. 67,

Debi Prasad & Ors. vs. Khelawan & Ors. interlocutory orders do not
attain finality at par with final adjudication.
27.

In my opinion, petitioners of C.R.P. No.168-70/2006

cannot question their impleadment on the ground that the suit itself
was not maintainable.

Suffice would it be to state that while

considering impleadment of parties under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC, the
contuours of consideration are whether the party sought to be
impleaded would or would not be affected by any decision in the
suit. No other consideration comes into play.
28.

Since admittedly, the said 3 parties i.e. petitioners of

C.R.P. No.168-70/2006 have purchased part of the suit land during
pendency of the suit, considering the nature of relief prayed for in
the suit, I hold that the said 3 parties have been correctly
impleaded as defendants.
29.

Issues raised by said 3 parties in the civil revision

petition has to form a subject matter of an application under Order
7 Rule 11 CPC.

30.

I hereby hold that the petitioners of C.R.P. No.168-

70/2006 would be entitled to file an application under Order 7 Rule
11 CPC and said application would be decided by the learned Trial
Judge.

I further hold that order dated 9.2.2000 passed by the

learned Civil Judge on a similar application filed by Surat Singh
would not operate as final and binding in view of the opinion of the
Allahabad High Court noted herein above, a view with which I
concur.
31.

Needless to state, law relating to challenge to a decree

stated to be obtained by fraud, whether the fraud was on the Court
or

on

the

party

stand

well

crystallized

in

various

judicial

pronouncements of the Supreme Court I may note but a few: 1996
(5) SCC 550, Indian Bank vs. Satyam Fibres; (1994) 1 SCC 1
S.P.Chengalvaraya Naidu vs. Jagannath and (2006) 7 SCC 756,
J.Narayan Parasrampuria vs. Pushpa Devi.
32.

I also note that in the decision in Hatti's case (supra),

the Supreme Court has noted remedies of persons against whom
orders are passed by revenue authorities without notice to them;
remedies being under the statutory provisions of the Delhi Land
Reforms Act 1954.

I additionally note that the Supreme Court

clearly noted the hierarchy of appeallate or revisional authorities
under the Delhi Land Reforms Act 1954.
33.

If

petitioners

of

C.R.P.

No.168-70/2006

filed

an

application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, learned Judge would be

expected to meaningfully read the decision in Hatti's case (supra)
as also would apply the law relating to decrees obtained by fraud
where distinction has been drawn on a fraud played upon a party
and a fraud played upon the Court. Learned Judge has also taken
note of the decisions where illegality alleged is on account of either
no service or on the allegation that service report procured was an
act of fraud. It would also be noted that respondents filed a reply to
the petition filed by Surat Singh under Section 85 of the DLR Act
1954.
34.

As regards the challenge to the order dated 7.7.2004 by

the sons of Surat Singh, suffice would it be to note that they never
came forward at the right time to disclose that they were the legal
heirs of Surat Singh. When the respondents of the revision petitions
i.e. the plaintiffs of the suit learnt about the names of the legal heirs
of Surat Singh, they promptly moved an application under Order 22
Rule 9 CPC.

I note that reckoned with effect from the date of

knowledge about the names of the legal heirs of Surat Singh,
application under Order 22 Rule 9 CPC was filed promptly.
35.

It is settled law that consideration of delay on account of

substitution on death of a defendant has to be in light of the date
when plaintiffs learnt about the names and addresses of the legal
heirs of the deceased defendant.
36.

The

2

sets

of

revision

petitions

are

accordingly

dismissed, but with the clarificatory observations and findings as

herein above recorded.
37.

No costs.
