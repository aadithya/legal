VIKRAMAJIT SEN, J.:(Oral)
1.

The question which calls for consideration in this Petition

concerns the date from which the Income Tax Department is
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 1 of 17

liable to pay interest on the amount of money/assets seized from
the Petitioner in the course of a Search conducted on 2.7.2002
under Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (IT Act). In the
course of this Search, cash amounting to Rs.35,15,000/- was
discovered at the premises of the Petitioner/Assessee, out of
which there was a Seizure of Rs.33,00,000/-. It is the case of the
Department that during the Block Assessment proceedings the
Assessee could sufficiently explain only a part of the cash seized
during the Search.

The Block Assessment proceedings were

completed vide Assessment Order dated 30.7.2004. According to
the Department, the Assessee's undisclosed income aggregated
Rs.12,43,232/-, attracting a tax demand of Rs.7,83,236/- together
with a penalty of Rs.7,83,236/- under Section 158BFA(2) of the IT
Act, thus raising a total demand of Rs.15,66,471. Pursuant to this
Order, the balance amount of Rs.17,33,529 was “released” on
27.9.2004 as stated in the Affidavit of the Assistant Commissioner
of Income Tax (Central Circle 5, New Delhi). Upon appeal against
the Assessment Order, the CIT(A) vide its Order dated 15.12.2004
deleted Rs.12,43,232 as undisclosed income assessable to tax
along with the penalty imposed. The Assessing Officer (AO) gave
effect to the Order-in-appeal and framed 'nil income' assessment
on 24.12.2004, releasing the remaining amount of Rs.15,66,471/-.
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 2 of 17

Thus, the entire Seizure of Rs.33 lakhs was ordered to be
released (in contradistinction to 'refunded') to the Petitioner.

2.

With respect to the payment of interest, it has been stated

in the Affidavit by the Assistant Commissioner that as per the
provisions of Section 132B(4) of the IT Act, interest

was paid on

the sum of Rs.17,33,529/- as follows: (a) 01-11-02 to 31.08.03
(10 months) at the rate of 0.66 per cent per month =
Rs.1,14,411/-; (b) 01-09-03 to 30-07-04 (11 months) at the rate of
0.5 per cent per month = Rs.95,342/-; thus aggregating the sum
of Rs.2,09,753/-. This interest is stated to have been determined
in consonance with ITNS 150 dated 7.3.2005, and was paid to the
Assessee vide Refund Voucher No.830974 dated 7.3.2005. This
computation as well as the rate of interest has not been
challenged before us, although the period for which it has been
granted is assailed by the Petitioner. The entire seized amount
having been returned, the only remaining controversy concerns
the element of interest payable by the Department to the
Petitioner.

3.

According to the Petitioner, it had informed the Department

at the time of the Search itself and thereafter in detail on
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 3 of 17

11.7.2002 that the seized cash belonged to two companies,
namely, Arkaylite Electricals, and, Contimeters & Electricals, and
had been duly accounted for in their Books of Accounts. A bald
and

unsubstantiated

statement

has

been

made

by

the

Commissioner of Income Tax to the effect that the Assessee could
only explain the source of part of the cash at the time of the
completion of the Assessment proceedings on 30.7.2004, possibly
mindful of the delay on his part in completing the adjudication.

4.

The claim of the Petitioner on account of interest is

According to learned counsel for the Department, the date

on which the Assessment is completed is the relevant date after
which interest will cease to run for the purpose of Section 132B;
and thereafter interest is to be calculated under Section 244A of
the IT Act. However, the absence of any reference to Section
244A in the pleadings of the Department, manifests that reliance
on this Section during the course of arguments was an afterthought. So far as Rs,17,33,529/- is concerned, no valid
explanation has been offered as to why interest has not been
given upto the date when payment was actually tendered. The
Department cannot be exonerated or excused from payment of
interest for the period of two months, being the hiatus between
the passing of the Assessment Order and the date on which the
interest was tendered.

6.

Let us now revert to the statutory provisions which apply to

the conundrum before us.

The provision of Section 132B(i)

appear to us to be of far-reaching dimensions, if not of draconian
nature.

It

permits

assets

seized

under

Section

132

or

requisitioned under Section 132A to be adjusted against existing
liability. The assumption must be that the Search and Seizure
provision under Section 132 or the Requisition proceedings under
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 5 of 17

Section 132A will not be lightly or obliquely resorted to by the
Department.

In other words, the highly invasive action under

Section 132A of the Act, in which the privacy of a citizen is rent
asunder, should not be employed as a surrogate of Section 226 of
the Act for effecting recoveries of tax dues from litigious
assesses.

7.

In the present case we are not concerned with this aspect

of the statute since it is Section 132B(4)(b) that is at the fulcrum
of the conundrum. It clarifies that “interest shall run from the
date immediately following the expiry of the period of one
hundred and twenty days from the date on which the last of the
authorisations for search under section 132 or requisition under
section 132A was executed to the date of completion of the
assessment under section 153A or under Chapter XIV-B”. The
period of 120 days (90 days upto 30-9-1984) was previously
stipulated in Section 132(5) of the IT Act until its omission by the
Finance Act 2002 with effect from 1.6.2002. Section 132(5) also
prescribed that the remaining

portion of the assets must be

'forthwith released' to the person from whose custody they were
seized after satisfaction of the tax liability existing against such
person. At that time, i.e. prior to the amendments brought about
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 6 of 17

by the Finance Act 2002, Section 132B(4)(b) envisaged payment
of simple interest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum on the
retained money computed “from the date immediately following
the expiry of six months from the Order under sub- section (5) of
Section 132.” It is also worth emphasizing that seized assets
for which a valid explanation has been furnished and which
therefore do not partake of the nature of undisclosed income or
assets cannot be retained even if there are outstanding tax-dues.

8.

Since the Search was conducted on 2.7.2002, the Petitioner

has claimed interest commencing from the expiry of a period of
120 days thereof, i.e., 1.11.2002. It is noteworthy that the
relevant provisions, i.e. Section 132B(4) make no reference to
Section 244A on which reliance has been placed by learned
counsel for the Respondent in the course of his final arguments.
We must take note of the fact that the Department has tendered
interest of the sum of Rs.2,09,753/- calculated for the period
1.11.2002 to 30.7.2004, i.e. the date of the Assessment Order for
the Block Period starting from 1.4.1996 to 1.7.2002. However, it
has failed to pay interest from 1.8.2004 to 27.9.2004, for no
justifiable reasons. Predicated on the said Assessment Order
dated 30.7.2004, after deducting the income-tax and penalty from
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 7 of 17

the seized sum of Rs. 33 lakhs, there was no further justification
not to release the balance sum of Rs.17,33,529/- forthwith. In the
event, this sum was actually released after some delay under
cover of the Department's letter dated 27.9.2004. As has been
noted above, interest at the rate of 0.66 per cent per month was
tendered for the period 1-11-2002 upto 31-08-2003. It appears to
us that this may have been for the reason that by virtue of the
Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2003, subsequently
cemented by the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2003, the rate
of interest stood reduced to 0.5 per cent per month with effect
from 8-9-2003.

Accordingly, interest at the higher rate should

have been calculated upto 8-9-2003. However, since this point
had not been urged by the Petitioner, we leave the matter to rest.

9.

In our opinion the purpose of stipulating the period of 120

days cannot be over-emphasised. What the statute expects is that
where a Seizure has taken place consequent upon a Search, the
decision declining to release or return the amount to the
Assessee must be taken with extreme expedition.

This is

evidently how the Department understood the provisions of the IT
Act since it has itself computed interest commencing from the
expiry of the said period of 120 days, that is, 1.11.2002. Perhaps
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 8 of 17

it would have been logical for Parliament to clarify that if a
decision to hold or withhold monies/assets discovered during a
Search is not taken with the prescribed period of 120 days,
interest would start to run from the date of the Seizure itself.
Otherwise, granting a blanket moratorium for the period of 120
days loses logicality.

This question has not been raised on

behalf of the Assessee and therefore we need not enter into an
exercise of jural engineering to impart what, prima facie, appears
to be a proper interpretation of the Section.

10.

Section 132B(4)(a) imposes on the Central Government the

liability to pay simple interest at a rate that has been varied from
time to time, on the amounts which have been duly accounted for,
together with the surplus amount for which no valid explanation
is forthcoming after deduction or reduction of outstanding tax
dues.

Thereafter, Section 132 B(4)(b) specifies that

interest

under “Chapter C – Powers”, being Sections 131 to 136, shall be
payable for the period commencing from the 121st day after the
last authorisation for the Search upto the date of completion of
the assessment relating to the Search. In the present case, since
the Petitioner has claimed interest only from the date on which
the Search was conducted, we shall assume that that was also the
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 9 of 17

day on which the last authorisation for the Search was recorded.
The following Table will elucidate that the rate of interest
payable in Search cases was not always

the same as interest

payable on delayed Refunds under Section 244A, to which our
attention has been drawn by learned counsel for the Revenue:
S.132B(4)(a)
1989

15% p.a

11.

S.244A

6% p.a

0.5% p.m

Even though the rate of interest payable under Section

132B(4)(a) and Section 244A is the same since 2002 there was a
difference prior thereto. This was obviously for the reason that
Parliament considered Search proceedings to be distinct from
ordinary assessment proceedings. We have already observed that
carrying out a Search is an invasion of the privacy of a citizen. It
is for good reason that the IT Act imposes stringent safeguards
and restrictions on the conduct of Searches. For these very
reasons Parliament was mindful of setting down a comparatively
short period of 120 days within which it expected summary
proceedings relating to Searches to be completed. In fact this

WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 10 of 17

period has been successively reduced by Parliament, since
Section 132B as originally inserted into the Act by Income Tax
(Amendment) Act, 1965 specified the period to be six months.
This period was thereafter reduced to 120 days by virtue of
Finance Act, 2002. Obviously, Parliament is mindful of the fact
that where assets and money belonging to a citizen are taken into
custody by the Department consequent upon a Search, a decision
should be taken promptly as to what portion thereof is to be
retained.

12.

At first blush, therefore, in our understanding, it must

logically be

expected that the rate of interest payable under

Section 132B(4) should be higher than that prescribed in other
provisions, with the expectation that the component of interest
would act as a deterrent to dilatory decision by the Department
in the context of Searches. On further consideration, it is equally
unacceptable for the Revenue to drag its feet or create obstacles
or delays for refunding monies to assessees. In fact, in Union of

India through Commissioner of Customs (Import & General) -vsHonda Siel Cars India Ltd, MANU/DE/0258/2007, we have taken
serious note of this deleterious and objectionable practice which
has become rampant in the Department. Perhaps for this reason
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 11 of 17

both eventualities. However, in this process the period separately

under

132B(4)

has

most of

its

After careful cogitation it appears to us that it

would be expedient to prescribe a higher rate of interest under
Section 132B(4) than that prevailing for Refunds under Section
244A. Further, Section 153B prescribes a period of two years for
completion of assessment or reassessment by the Assessing
Officer which vide the Finance Act, 2006 has been further
reduced to a period of 21 months in those cases where the last of
the authorisations for Search under Section 132 was executed
during the financial year commencing on the 1st day of April,
2004 or any subsequent financial year. This goes to show, yet
again, the intent of the Legislature to impress upon the
Department the need to deal with all Search and Seizure matters
expeditiously.

13.

In respect of the amount of Rs.15,66,471/- it will be recalled

that this amount was the aggregate of the amount computed by
the AO as the income tax demand of Rs.7,83,236/- on the amount
found to be undisclosed income, namely, 12,43,243/- together
with penalty in the like sum of Rs.7,83,236/- under Section
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 12 of 17

158BFA(2). Had these Orders not been reversed by the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [CIT(A)] in the Judgment
dated 15.12.2004, there would have been no foundation for the
claim of interest on this amount. It is trite that the Order of the
AO merge with that of the CIT(A).

As a consequence of this

amalgamation, complete parity must be accorded to the sum of
Rs.17,33,529/- and Rs.15,66,471/-, thereby necessitating identical
treatment to them.

In other words, if interest is payable with

effect from 1.11.2002 on the first sum, it would be axiomatic that
it would also be payable with effect from the same date in respect
of second amount also. In support of this proposition we shall
only mention that our attention has been drawn to the decisions
in Chloride India Ltd. -vs- Commissioner of Income-Tax, West

Bengal I, [1977] 106 ITR 38, Bardolia Textile Mills -vs- IncomeTax Officer, Circle II, Ward-E, Surat, [1985] 151 ITR 389 and
Commissioner of Income-Tax -vs- M.L. Sanghi, [1988] 170 ITR
670.

14.

We find no justification whatsoever for placing reliance on

Section 244A of the IT Act which is found in Chapter-XIX dealing
with Refunds. A reading of Sections 237 and 238 makes it clear
that it pertains to amounts of tax paid by the Assessee or on its
WP(C) No.2959/2005

fasciculous of Chapter XIII-C.

events are covered in the

Section 153A is to be found in

Chapter-XIV prescribing the procedure for assessment in case of
search and requisition, and has been dealt with as a distinct
subject even in that Chapter.

Similar is the position so far as

reference to Chapter XIV-B is concerned. None of these
provisions prescribe the period from which interest is payable. In
the event it is found that there is no justification for the retention
of the items seized by the Department in the cases of a Search,
the procedure for assessment should not be confused with
provisions stipulating the time within which a summary decision
is to be taken in respect of

money or

assets seized during a

Search.

15.

Our attention has also been rightly drawn to the decisions

in K.A. Karim -vs- Commissioner of Income-Tax, [1990] 186 ITR
97 and Manohar Lal -vs- Commissioner of Income Tax, (2001) 168
CTR(Del) 558. It has been enunciated in Sandvik Asia Ltd. -vs-

Commissioner of Income-Tax, [2006] 280 ITR 643(SC) that
interest is payable by way of compensation on amounts

wrongfully retained, including payment of interest on interest
wrongfully retained.

16.

As has already been noted above, computation of interest

under Section 132B(4) has been calculated with effect from
1.11.2002 on which there is no contest at all. The Block
Assessment proceedings were completed in terms of Assessment
Order dated 30.7.2004, pursuant

to

which

Rs. 17,33,529/- was returned on 27.9.2004.

the

sum

of

No Appeal has been

preferred by the Department on this score. So far as this sum of
Rs.17,33,529/- is concerned, interest under Section 132B(4)
became payable on 30.7.2004, which is the outer limit of the
period prescribed under section 132B(4)(b).

Since the payment

was eventually made on 27.9.2004, the Petitioner would be
entitled to compensation on account of delay for the period
1.8.2004 to 27.9.2004. We direct that compensation/damages, in
terms of Sandvik Asia, be paid by the Respondents to the
Petitioner on the sum of Rs.17,33,529/- for the period 1.8.2004 to
27.9.2004 at the rate of nine (9) per cent per annum.

17.

So far as the sum of Rs.15,66,471/- is concerned the Appeal

was decided, (in favour of the Petitioner), by the CIT(A) by Orders
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 15 of 17

dated 15.12.2004. The Respondents are liable to pay interest on
the said sum from 1.11.2002 to 15.12.2004 under Section 132B
(4)(b).

The Respondents have

without

any justification

whatsoever paid only a sum of Rs.31,328/- as interest for the
period 1.9.2004 to 31.12.2004 (the date of the AO is 30-7-2004)
glossing over and ignoring the period 1-11-2002 to 31-8-2004 (It
should be recalled that the Assessment Order was passed on 307-2004 and thus there is no plausible reason for tendering
payment with effect

from 1-9-2004).

The Respondents are

accordingly directed to pay interest under Section 132B(4)(b) on
the said sum of Rs.15,66,471/- for the period 1.11.2002 to
15.12.2004 at the rate of 0.66 per cent per month upto 8-9-2003
and thereafter at the rate of 0.5 per cent

per month.

The

question that arises is whether compensation/damages in the

Sandvik Asia mould should be granted in respect of sum of
Rs.15,66,471/- also. Since the decision of the AO was reversed in
Appeal, there may not have been any justification for granting
damages. However, since the period envisaged under Section
132B(4)(b) specifically commences from the expiry of 120 days
from the date on which the last of the authorisations for Search
was executed (which in the present case is 1-11-2002), the fact
that interest has inexplicably been tendered only commencing
WP(C) No.2959/2005

Page 16 of 17

from 1-9-2004 is indefensible. Therefore, in addition to payment
of interest at the aforementioned rate, the Petitioner shall also
be

entitled

to

receive

from

the

Respondent

compensation/damages for the period 1-11-2002 to 1-9-2004 at
the rate of nine per cent per annum.

18.

The writ petition is allowed in the above terms. The

Petitioner shall also be entitled to costs quantified at Rs.5,000/-.
