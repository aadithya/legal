Whether Reporters of Local papers may be allowed to see the Judgment?
To be referred to the Reporter or not?

1.
Petitioner No.1 is an Association of Retired Railway Drivers. Petitioner No.2 is the
Secretary of this Association and petitioner Nos. 3 to 130 are its Members as they are the retired
employees and they are receiving the pension. The drivers in the Railway are getting Running
Allowance. Third Central Pay Commission, which gave its report in the year 1973, had
recommended the continuation of Running Allowance and its computation to the extent of 75% for
working out the quantum of pension. Thus, while fixing the pension of these drivers on their
retirement, their pension was fixed after taking into consideration 75% of the Running Allowance.
Letter dated 21.1.1974 was also issued by the Railway Board in this behalf. However, vide another
letter dated 23.2.1976, percentage of the Running Allowance for computing the pension was

reduced from 75% to 45% with effect from 1.1.1973. Thereafter, vide another letter dated 17.7.1981 it
was raised to 55% with effect from 1.4.1979. Against these reductions a writ petition came to be filed
in this Court. On the creation of Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) under the
Administrative Tribunal Act, that petition was transferred CAT, Principal Bench, New
Delhi. This petition was allowed vide judgment dated 6.8.1986.

This case, i.e. Deo Dutt

Sharma v. Union of India & Ors. is reported as 1986 (1) ATC 4646. The Union of
India/Railway Administration did not question this order of the Tribunal.

Instead,

Notification dated 5.12.1988 was issued amending Rule 2544 of the Indian Railway
Establishment Code (hereinafter, ‘the Code’) making the said amendment operative from 1.1.1973
and 1.4.1979 respectively providing therein that percentage of the Running Allowance for
computation of pension would be reduced from 75% to 45% and 55% with effect from 1.1.1973 and
1.4.1979 respectively. We may note that the Tribunal in its judgment dated 6.8.1986 had quashed
the earlier orders on the ground that under the Code, which is of statutory nature, framed under
Article 309 of the Constitution of India, Running Allowance of 75% for the purpose of
computation of pension was provided, which statutory right could not be taken away by mere
executive instructions. Obviously, to overcome this difficulty, vide Notification dated 5.12.1988,
the said Rule 2544 was amended. However, this notification was challenged by filing an OA
before the Ernakulum Bench of CAT. The said Bench vide judgment dated 2.4.1990 quashed the
notification so far it gave retrospective effect. Same challenge was made by filing OA in the
Principal Bench at New Delhi as well. However, the New Delhi Bench dismissed the challenge
to the validity of the notification. As conflict arose between the two views, one taken by the
Ernakulum Bench and the other by the New Delhi Bench, matter came to be referred to the Full
Bench, which agreed with the view taken by the Ernakulum Bench. The Government challenged
this decision before the Supreme Court which was repelled as the appeal was dismissed vide
judgment dated 25.7.1997 in the case of Chairman, Railway Board & Ors. v. C.R.

However, the petitioners in this petition, who retired after 5.12.1988, made a representation
dated 25.8.1998 basing their case on the aforesaid judgment of the Supreme Court and seeking
extension of benefit thereof. It was followed by various reminders and ultimately OA under
Section 19 of the Administrative Tribunal Act was filed before the Principal Bench of CAT at
New Delhi on 14.12.1999. This OA has finally been rejected vide judgment dated 10.12.2001 holding
that the Supreme Court has upheld Rule 2544 prospectively and, therefore, the petitioners cannot
draw benefit therefrom.
2.

It is not in dispute that these petitioners have retired from service after the amendment of Rule
2544 of the Code whereby the Running Allowance, for the computation of pension, stands reduced
from 75% to 45%. In Rangadhamaiah (supra), the Supreme Court has held that the
amendment cannot be given retrospective effect. Therefore, to that extent the said judgment is of no
help to the petitioners herein. The petitioners can succeed only if they are able to prove that the
amendment to the Rule is illegal even if it is prospective in nature.

3.

In para 14 of the judgment in Rangadhamaiah (supra), the Supreme Court has formulated
the question that had arisen for consideration in the following words :“14.
The question which, therefore, needs to be examined is whether the amendments
made in Rule 2544 by the impugned notifications, to the extent they have been given
effect from January 1, 1973 and April 1, 1979, can be treated as a valid exercise of the
power to make rules under the Proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution.”

4.

It is clear from the above that the Supreme Court was concerned with a totally different issue,
namely, retrospectivity of the impugned Notification dated 5.12.1988 and referring to various
judgments held that it was not competent for the Government to amend the said Rule
retrospectively taking away the existing/accrued rights of the said persons. Para 31 of the judgment
further discloses that the concerned retired employees were those who had retired after 1.1.1973 and

WP (C) No. 1083/2002

nsk

Page 3 of 9

before 5.12.1988 and, therefore, the Court held that as per Rule 2301 of the Code, they were entitled
to have their pension computed in accordance with Rule 2544 as it stood at the time of their
retirement. In that view, the said judgment would not help either the petitioners or the respondents.
5.

However, learned counsel for the petitioners referred to observations of the Supreme Court in
paras 26 to 28 and contended that since pension was not a bounty payable on the sweet will and
pleasure of the Government, the valuable right of the petitioners to receive pension could not be
taken away. In the aforesaid paras the Supreme Court has observed as under :“26.
In Deokinandan Prasad v. State of Bihar, 1971 (Supp) SCR 634 :
(AIR 1971 SC 1409), decided by a Constitution Bench it has been laid down :“Pension is not a bounty payable on the sweet will and pleasure of the
Government and that, on the other hand, the right to pension is a valuable
right vesting in a Government servant.”
(p. 152) (Emphasis supplied)
27.
In that case the right to receive pension was treated as property under Articles
31(1) and 19(1)(f) of the Constitution.
28.
In D.S. Nakara v. Union of India, (1983) 2 SCR 165 : (AIR 1983 SC
130), this Court, after taking note of the decision in Deokinandan Prasad (AIR 1971
SC 1409) (supra), has said :“Pension to civil employees of the Government and the defence personnel
as administered in India appear to be a compensation for service rendered
in the past. However, as held in Douge v. Board of Education a
pension is closely akin to wages in that it consists of payment provided by
an employer, is paid in consideration of past service and serves the
purpose of helping the recipient meet the expenses of living.”

6.

However, these observations would be of no help to the petitioners. The pension of the petitioner is
not taken away. No doubt, there is an amendment in the Rule by which the Running Allowance
for the purpose of calculating the pension is reduced from 75% to 45%. The question is as to whether
by doing so any right of the petitioners is infringed. For this purpose, we shall have to look into the
reason because of which the Running Allowance to be taken into consideration, for the purposes of
computation of pension, was reduced.

The respondents in their counter affidavit have explained the background in which such an
amendment came to be passed. It is stated that for proper appreciation of the matter in dispute, in
the Railways there is a category of staff known as 'Running Staff' whose performance of duty is
directly connected with the charge of moving trains, i.e. Drivers, Guards, Shunters, Firemen, etc.
For the performance of such duties, 'Running Staff' are granted 'Running Allowance' which
contains a pay element. Therefore, for certain specified benefits/purposes, the pay of 'Running
Staff' is considered as basic pay (+) a specified component of basic pay representing the pay
element in the 'Running Allowance'. It is submitted that the special feature of the 'Running
Staff' of the Railways is that portion of their emoluments is dependent upon the nature of duties
and quantum of work put in by them during a month. For this purpose, the Railway Board have
framed Rules and the present rules are entitled “Rules for Payment of Running and Other
Allowances to the Running Staff on the Railways, 1981”. The quantum of Running Allowance
earned by the Running Staff is determined mainly by the actual distance worked by them. The
basic objective of this rule is an orientation towards better performance. The Running Allowance
is meant to include a portion of the pay and out of pocket expenses of the Running Staff for
meeting out of pocket expenses as their duty generally involves their absence from Head Quarters.
It is stated further that it has been the practice for over a few decades in the past to reckon the
retirement benefits of Running Staff on pay plus a fixed percentage of pay/emoluments,
Running Allowance actually drawn. This benefit of reckoning an additional component towards
calculation of retirement benefits of Running Staff is on the consideration that the arduousness
and uncertain hours of work entailed in performance of running duties over long periods of time
should be appropriately reflected in the quantum of pension admissible when the staff retires from
posts involving such duties. For this purpose, Rule 2544 of Code, Volume-II, provided that for
calculation of average emoluments, actual amount of Running Allowance drawn during the month
limited to a maximum of 75% of the other emoluments was to be reckoned in addition to pay in the

WP (C) No. 1083/2002

nsk

Page 5 of 9

authorised scales of pay. However, the pay scales were revised on the recommendation of the Third
Central Pay Commission with effect from 1.1.1973. Result of revisions of scales of pay of the
Running Staff on the implementation of the recommendations of the pay commission had become a
revision in the pay percentage fixed for computation of retirement benefits of the Running Staff.
The matter was considered by the Railway Board and vide letter dated 22.3.1976 instructions were
issued in this behalf which was a faulty action as amendment in the rule was required and, therefore,
when those instructions were quashed as contrary to the rules, amendment in the rule itself was
made.

8.

It is also explained that the entire gamut of the scheme of Running Allowance etc. admissible to
the Running Staff was subsequently examined by an expert committee known as The Running
Allowance Committee, 1980. The Committee recommended that for the purpose of retirement
benefits (including contribution to SRPF), 60% of the basic pay of the Running Staff should be
taken into account uniformly instead of reckoning the Running Allowance actually drawn subject
to a maximum of 45% of pay. It is stated that various recommendations made by this Committee
were examined by the Railway Board in consultation with the recognised federations and an
agreement was entered into with them, constituting a packaging, covering various rules/ orders
regulating grant of running and allowed allowances to the Running Staff. Regarding the pay
element for the purpose of computation of retirement benefits of Running Staff, it was decided
that an additional component of 55% of pay will be taken into account with effect from 1.4.1979.
Instructions to this effect were issued by the Railway Board in the year 1981.

9.

The pension is calculated on the basis of ‘pay’. Normally, Running Allowance would not be
treated as ‘pay’. It is only because of Rule 2544 of the Code that a part of Running Allowance is
treated as ‘pay’ for the purpose of pension. When the basic pay itself is revised after the
implementation of the Third Central Pay Commission, the concerned employees started getting

WP (C) No. 1083/2002

nsk

Page 6 of 9

much higher basic pay and keeping in view that consideration if the Government decided, as a policy
matter, to reduce the component of Running Allowance for the purpose of computation of pension,
such an action of the Government is not open to question. Fact remains that the overall pension of
the petitioners is not less than what it could have been prior to the revision in the pay scales. When
the Notification dated 5.12.1988 was issued amending the Rule, these petitioners were still in
service. They had not retired and were getting any pension which is sought to be reduced. Their
pension has been fixed much subsequently on the basis of Rule in vogue as on their respective dates
of retirement. Therefore, it cannot be said that the amendment in the Rule is illegal or violative of
Articles 14 & 16 of the Constitution.

10.

No doubt, the persons who retired after 1.1.1973 and before 5.12.1988 have got the advantage as in
their cases the pension is fixed by taking 75% of the Running Allowance. For this reason, they
may even be getting higher pension. However, that had occasioned due to bona fide lapse on the part
of the respondents in not amending the Rules at appropriate time, but issuing administrative
instructions which were held to be invalid on the ground that executive instructions could not be
issued contrary to the Rules and there was a need to amend the Rules. The Government, in these
circumstances, while amending the Rules, even wanted to cover the cases of all employees who
retired after 1.1.1973 by giving retrospective operation. However, it could not succeed as
retrospectivity to the said rule was held to be inadmissible by the Apex Court. It was, thus, a
fortuitous position for those who retired between 1.1.1973 and 5.12.1988 who benefitted under the
aforesaid unusual circumstances. That would not mean that the Government has no right to rectify
the situation by amending the Rules giving prospective operation. Thus, the persons retiring after
1.1.1973 and before 5.12.1988 form a different class because of the aforesaid fortuitous circumstance
and the petitioners cannot equate their cases with those persons and are not permitted to raise the
plea of discrimination on this basis.

We, therefore, are of the opinion that the judgment of the Tribunal is perfectly legal and the
present petition assailing that judgment is bereft of any merits. Accordingly, this petition is
dismissed with no orders as to costs.
