Dependents filed a claim petition under Section 110-A
with

Section

92-A

of

the

M.V.Act

1939

claiming

a

compensation of Rs.15,50,000/- on account of death of the
deceased in the said road accident.
3.

After holding driver of the offending vehicle guilty of

rash and negligent driving, vide award dated 23.8.1989, the
Tribunal has awarded a compensation of Rs.3 lacs to the
dependents.
4.

Aggrieved

and

dissatisfied

with

the

said

award,

DDA/appellant preferred an appeal registered as FAO No.30/1990.
5.

Respondents in the said appeal (dependents before the

Tribunal) filed cross objections i.e. CM No.2116/1990.
6.

While the said appeal and cross objections were

pending decision, dependents moved a review petition before the
learned Tribunal.
7.

Vide order dated 9.4.1991, the review petition was

allowed and award dated 23.8.89 was modified by enhancing the
compensation amount from Rs.3,00,000/- to Rs.5,84,000/-.
8.

DDA preferred another appeal challenging order dated

9.4.1991. The appeal was registered as FAO No.16/1992.
Page 2 of 15

9.

The issue involved in both the appeals as also cross

objections relates to quantum of compensation,therefore, I shall
only be noting only such facts and evidence as are relevant for
adjudication of said issue.
10.

In the claim petition, earnings of the deceased was

stated as Rs.6,000/- per month. It was stated that the deceased
was partner in 2 firms, viz., M/s.Gopi Nath & Sons and M/s.Shibban
Lal Gopi Nath and was having 30% share in each firm.
further

stated

that

deceased

was

also

a

It was

director

in

M/s.C.K.Exporters Pvt. Ltd. and was getting Rs.3,500/- per month
as remuneration out of which a sum of Rs.550/- was deducted as
tax at source.
11.

In support of the averments made in the claim petition

pertaining to the earnings of the deceased, dependents examined
4 witnesses, viz., A.K.Gupta (PW-1), Dinesh Chand (PW-5), Gopi
Nath (PW-6) and Rukmani Bansal (PW-8).
12.

Gopi Nath, the father and Rukmani Bansal the wife of

the deceased in their testimony as PW-6 and PW-8 respectively
reiterated the averments made in the claim petition.
13.

Shri A.K.Gupta, director in M/s.C.K.Exporters Pvt. Ltd.

stepped into the witness box as PW-1 and deposed that there
were 4 directors in M/s.C.K.Exporters Pvt.Ltd. and deceased,
K.K.Bansal was one of them.

He further deposed that all 4
Page 3 of 15

directors including deceased were getting fixed remuneration of
Rs.3500/- per month.

He proved the salary certificate of the

deceased as PW-1/1.
14.

Diwan Chand, accountant in M/s.Shibban Lal Gopi Nath

stepped into witness box as PW-5 and supported the averments
made in the claim petition as also testimonies of other witnesses.
15.

In order to prove the earnings of the deceased, 3

assessment orders, viz., Ex.PW-5/1, PW-5/2 and PW-5/3 and an
income tax return, Ex.PW-5/4, was placed on record.
16.

Further, in order to establish that deceased was a

partner in afore-noted 2 firms and was having 30% share in each
of the firm, partnership deeds (Ex.PW-6/1 and Ex.PW-6/2) were
placed on record.

(Partnership deeds so filed are photocopied

documents.).
17.

After

appreciating

afore-noted

documents,

learned

Tribunal has taken income of Rs.29,404/- shown in the income tax
return, Ex.PW-5/4 as the annual income of the deceased. (I note
that no deduction towards income tax has been made by the
Tribunal) Deducting Rs.9,404/- for personal spending of the
deceased (nearly 30% of the income), annual loss of dependence
has been calculated at Rs.20,000/-. Applying multiplier of 15, total
loss of dependence has been determined at Rs.3,00,000/-.
18.

In the review petition, it was contended that learned
Page 4 of 15

Tribunal erred in taking income shown in the income tax return,
Ex.PW-5/4 as annual income of the deceased for the reason said
income tax return related to a period of 2 months and 20 days
only.
19.

Tribunal concurred with the said contention advanced

by the appellant. Taking Rs.31,540/- as the annual income of the
deceased from the 2 firms on the basis of income tax return,
Ex.PW-5/1 and Ex.PW-5/2 and Rs.42,000/- as the salary of the
deceased from M/s.C.K.Exporters Pvt. Ltd., the Tribunal has
determined the total income of the deceased as Rs.73,540/-.
Deducting Rs.17,000/- towards income tax, net annual income of
the deceased is determined as Rs.56,540/-. Deducting Rs.20,000/towards

personal

expenses

of

the

deceased,

Tribunal

has

determined loss of dependence at Rs.36,540/-. Applying multiplier
of 15, total loss of dependence has been determined at
Rs.5,48,000/-. Thus, award dated 23.8.89 has been modified by
enhancing the compensation by a sum of Rs.2,48,000/-.
20.

The controversy in the instant case centers around

appreciation of afore-noted assessment orders, Ex.PW-5/1, Ex.PW5/2 & Ex.PW-5/3 and income tax return, Ex.PW-5/4.
21.

Before proceeding with the compensation assessed, I

note following observations made by the learned Tribunal:“From the perusal of the income tax returns Ex.PWPage 5 of 15

22.

5/4, it can be seen that prior to 1.9.1984, deceased
was not having taxable income. Had there been any
taxable income of the deceased prior to 1.9.1984,
then he would have filed income tax returns of the
Firm even for that period.
Similarly, income-tax
returns of the firm of K.K.Bansal and M/s. Gopi Nath,
the tax returns filed by the income tax authority is for
Rs.29,400/- for the year 1986-87 and returns for the
year, 1984-85 shows the income of the deceased as
Rs.92,320/-.”
Notwithstanding above observations, learned Tribunal

has determined annual income of the deceased on the basis of
income tax return, Ex.PW-5/4.
23.

The first question that arises is whether the Tribunal

was right in determining annual income of the deceased on the
basis of income tax return Ex.PW-5/4.
24.

Income tax return, Ex.PW-5/4 shows the income of the

deceased for a period from 01.09.1984 to 20.11.1984 i.e. 2
months 20 days.
25.

It is an admitted fact that income tax return, Ex.PW-5/4

was filed on 27.1.1987 i.e. nearly 2 years after the death of the
deceased in the said road accident.
26.

During his life time, the deceased did not file any

income tax return. The fact that said return was filed after 2 years
of the death of the deceased leads to a strong inference that said
income tax return was filed to show an exaggerated income of the
deceased in order to get more compensation.
27.

According to income tax returns PW-5/4, earnings of the
Page 6 of 15

deceased consisted of following 4 components:(i)

Remuneration of Rs.3500/- from M/s.C.K.Exporters Pvt.
Ltd.

(ii)

30% share of profits from M/s. Gopi Nath & Sons.

(iii) 30% share of profits from M/s.Shibban Lal Gopi Nath.
(iv) Income from house property.
28.

According to the dependents, earnings of the deceased

consisted of first 3 components.

No witness has stated a word

about the income of the deceased from any property. Assuming
there was some income from house property, since the asset
remained, so did the income therefrom.
29.

Income tax return Ex.PW-5/4 shows the earnings of the

deceased for a period of 2 months 20 days as Rs.29,404/-.
Meaning thereby, the deceased was earning approximately
Rs.10,000/- per month.

In the claim petition, it was stated that

deceased was earning Rs.6,000/- per month.

There is a clear

contradiction between the averments made in the claim petition
and income tax return, Ex.PW-5/4. Further the period of the return
i.e.

1.9.1984

to

20.11.1984

makes

it

a

highly

suspicious

document. It means that for the period prior to 31.8.1984, during
his life time, the deceased had no taxable income. The deceased
died on 20.11.1984. It was thus profitable to create evidence of
income for a period of about 3 months prior thereto.
Page 7 of 15

30.

These surrounding circumstances renders income tax

return, Ex.PW-5/4, an inherently suspicious document.
31.

Learned counsel for the respondents contended that

witnesses of the respondents were not subjected to any cross
examination on the issue. Counsel urged that no suggestion was
given to them that income tax return, Ex. PW-5/4, was a created
document and filed with a view to claim more compensation. He
thus contended that as statements of the witnesses remained
unrebutted, and thus the Tribunal has correctly placed reliance on
income tax return, Ex.PW-5/4.
32.

I do not concur with the learned counsel for the

respondents for the reason, lack of cross examination does not
cure the inherent suspicious nature of the income tax return,
Ex.PW-5/4.
33.

Thus, I hold that income of the deceased cannot be

determined on the basis of the income tax return Ex.PW-5/4.
34.

Likewise, assessment order Ex.PW-5/3 where under

income tax payable by the deceased was assessed on the basis of
the income tax return Ex.PW-5/4 cannot be relied upon.
35.

The next question is, whether it is proved that the

deceased was a director in M/s. C.K.Exporters Pvt. Ltd. and was
paid a monthly remuneration of Rs.3500/-.
36.

It is an admitted fact that the claim made was that the
Page 8 of 15

deceased was appointed as a director in the said company in
August 1984, i.e., 3 months prior to his death.
37.

Another admitted fact is that the company in question is

a private limited company.
38.

Next admitted fact is that though stated to be a director

in the company, the deceased was not holding any share in the
company.
39.

No reasons have been given as to why the deceased

was made a director in the company even though he had no
pecuniary investment or stake in the company. It is not shown nor
proved that the company is a family owned company.
40.

A perusal of Ex.PW-1/1 stated to be the salary certificate

of the deceased shows that alleged salary for the month of
October and November 1984 was credited to the alleged loan
account of the deceased.
41.

Section

303(2),

Companies

Act,1956

makes

it

mandatory for a company to file Form No. 32 when a director is
appointed. Form No.32 evidencing the appointment of the
deceased as a director in the said company has not been placed
on record.
42.

Witnesses of the respondents had deposed that a sum

of Rs.550/- was deducted as tax at source from the alleged
remuneration of Rs.3500/-.

But, no TDS certificate showing the
Page 9 of 15

said deduction has been placed on record.
43.

Above facts show that the respondents have tried to

create evidence of some payment made in the past to the
deceased by the company being utilized to show that the
deceased was a director in the company.
44.

Thus, I hold that it is not proved that the deceased was

a director in the said company and was being paid a monthly
remuneration of Rs.3500/-.
45.

The next question to be determined is whether the

deceased was a partner in M/s.Gopi Nath & Sons and M/s.Shibban
Lal Gopi Nath having 30% share in each firm. If so, what were his
earnings from said firms?
46.

Copies of partnership deeds (Ex.PW-6/2 and Ex.PW-6/3)

placed on record establish that the deceased was a partner in said
firms and was having 30% share in each firm.
47.

In relation to earnings of deceased from firm M/s.Gopi

Nath & Sons, the assessment order, Ex.PW-5/2 is relevant.

The

same shows annual income/profit of said firm as Rs.27,170/- for
the assessment year 1984 -85.
shown as Rs.6,832/-.

The share of the deceased is

As the said assessment order was on the

basis of a return which was filed prior to the death of the
deceased, the same can be accepted.
48.

In the said assessment order, annual income of the firm
Page 10 of 15

is shown as Rs.27,170/- and share of deceased is shown as
Rs.6,832/-.
49.

Thus, I hold that annual income of the deceased from

the firm M/s.Gopi Nath & Sons was Rs.6,832/-.
50.

To show the earnings of the deceased from the firm

M/s.Shibban Lal Gopi Nath, assessment order Ex.PW-5/1 has been
placed on record. The same shows annual income/profit of said
firm in the assessment year 1984-85 as Rs.92,320/-. Share of the
deceased is shown as Rs.24,708/-.
51.

It is relevant to note that afore noted assessment order

was issued on basis of an income tax return which was filed
subsequent to the death of the deceased.
52.

Partnership deed, Ex.PW-6/2 shows that partnership firm

M/s. Shibban Lal Gopi Nath commenced in the year 1963.
53.

A perusal of the record of the Tribunal shows that no

income tax return filed prior to the death of the deceased has
been placed on record.
54.

At this juncture, I note testimony of Diwan Chand (PW-5)

who was an accountant in M/s.Shibban Lal Gopi Nath.

He had

deposed that said firm was assessed to income tax.
55.

If the firm was assessed to income tax as deposed to by

the afore noted witness, then the question arises why no income
tax return which was allegedly filed prior to the death of the
Page 11 of 15

deceased has been placed on record.
56.

The fact that no income tax return which was filed prior

to the death of the deceased has been placed on record leads to
an inference that earnings/profits of the said firm were such on
which no income tax was payable.
57.

In absence of any income tax return which was filed

prior to the death of the deceased, not much reliance can be
placed on assessment order, Ex.PW-5/1, which is based on an
income tax return which was filed subsequent to the death of the
deceased.
58.

For the assessment year 1984-85, income up to

Rs.15,000/- per annum was non-taxable income. Therefore, I hold
that annual income/profits of the firm M/s.Shibban Lal Gopi Nath
was Rs.15,000/-.

Since the share of the deceased was 30%,

annual earnings of the deceased comes to Rs.4500/-.
59.

In view of my above discussion and particularly paras 48

and 57, I hold that total annual income of the deceased comes to
Rs.11,382/-. (Rs.6,832/- + Rs.4,500/- = Rs.11,332/-)
60.

As noted herein above, in the assessment year 1984-85,

income up to Rs.15,000/- per annum was non-taxable income.
Therefore, no deduction is made towards income tax.
61.

Taking into consideration the fact that minimum wages

as notified under Minimum Wages Act increase by nearly 250% to
Page 12 of 15

300% every 10 years to neutralize rise in inflation and cost of
living, it could reasonably be expected that the earnings of the
deceased would have doubled by the time he would have stopped
earning.

Thus, mean average annual income of the deceased

comes to Rs.16,998/-.
62.

Deducting 1/3rd for the personal spending of the

deceased, annual loss of dependence comes to Rs.11,332/-.
63.

Tribunal has applied multiplier of 15. Considering that

deceased was aged 45 years at the time of the accident, multiplier
of 15 as applied by the Tribunal is on the higher side. I consider
multiplier of 11 as appropriate.
64.

Thus, total loss of dependence comes to Rs.1,24,652/-.

65.

Tribunal

Thus, compensation is reduced by a sum of

66.

Award dated 23.8.1989 is modified by reducing the

compensation under the head 'loss of dependence' by a sum of
Rs.1,75,348/-.
67.

FAO No.30/1990 accordingly stands disposed of by

reducing the compensation by a sum of Rs.1,75,348/-.
68.

As

No.2116/1990

were

noted,

Page 13 of 15

69.

It is settled law that normal rule of determination of loss

of dependence is not strictly applicable to cases where capital
asset is the income of the deceased. See decision of the Supreme
Court reported as New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Charlie & Anr.
(2005) 10 SCC 720.
70.

In view of my above discussion, I hold that no ground of

enhancement is made out.
71.

CM No.2116/1990 is accordingly dismissed.

72.

As already noted, FAO No.16/1992 challenges the order

dated 9.4.1991 by which review sought by dependents was
allowed and award dated 23.8.1989 was modified.
73.

It is settled law that the power to review is not an

inherent power. It must be conferred by law either specifically or
by necessary implication. (See Patel Narshi Thakershi & Ors. vs.
Pradyumansinghji Arjunsinghji, AIR 1970 SC 1273).
74.

Motor Vehicles Act 1988 does not confer power to

review on Motor Accident Claims Tribunals. Thus, Tribunal was not
justified in allowing review filed by the dependents and passing
award dated 9.4.1991.
75.

Even otherwise, as the original award dated 23.8.1989

is legally not sustainable as discussed and held above, the
necessary corollary that emerges is that award dated 9.4.1991
which had modified award dated 23.8.1989 becomes null and
Page 14 of 15

void.
76.

FAO No.16/1992 is accordingly allowed and order/award

dated 9.4.1991 is set aside.
77.

FAO No.30/1990 is allowed in terms of para 65 above.

78.

CM No.2116/1990 in FAO No.30/1990 is dismissed.

79.

No costs.
