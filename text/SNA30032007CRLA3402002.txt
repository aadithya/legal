The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant

in the impugned judgment.

testimony of the witnesses on record and by reference
to the same, he had argued that there was absolutely
no

evidence

of

of

such evidence, the court below had committed an error

prosecution beyond doubt, the presumption provided for
in Section 20 of the Act cannot be drawn.

Three

cardinal principles of criminal jurisprudence are well
settled and they are as follows :i) that the onus lies affirmatively on the
prosecution
to
prove
its
case
beyond
reasonable doubt and it cannot derive any
benefit from weakness or falsity of the
defence version while proving its case;
ii)
that in a criminal trial the accused
must be presumed to be innocent unless he is
proved to be guilty; and
iii) that the onus of the prosecution shifts.
13.

The Evidence Act also does not contemplate

that the accused should prove his case with the same
strictness and rigour as the prosecution is required
to

prove

a

criminal

charge.

In

fact,

from

the

cardinal principles referred to above, it follows that
it is sufficient if the accused is able to prove his
case by the standard of preponderance of probabilities
as envisaged by Section 5 of the Evidence Act as a
result of which he succeeds not because he proves his
case

to

the

Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

hilt

but

because

of

his

Page 11 of 42

version throws doubt on the prosecution case.
14.

The learned Senior Counsel, who appeared for

the appellant, had challenged to the validity of the
sanction order passed by the sanctioning authority PW4, Shri R S Gupta, then Addl. Commissioner of Police,
Delhi.

He

urged

that

there

was

complete

non-

application of mind on the part of the sanctioning
authority in granting the sanction for prosecution.
In support of his said contention, he placed reliance
upon three judgments viz (i) Ganesh Prasad Shukla V/s.
State of Bihar 2000 Crl.L.J. 4841; (ii) Har Bharosey
V/s.

State

of

UP

1988

Crl.L.J.

1122;

and

(iii)

Mohd.Iqbal Ahmed V/s. State of AP AIR 1979 SC 677.
These judgments on the point of sanction are of no
consequence to the contention relating to validity of
sanction raised on behalf of the appellant.

PW-4 Shri

R S Gupta, who at the relevant time was the competent
authority to sanction the prosecution, has testified
in his testimony during the trial that he had granted
sanction

for

Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

prosecution

of

the

appellant

after

Page 12 of 42

consideration of all the material placed before him.
On

perusal

of

sanction

order,

Exhibit

PW-4/A,

it

cannot be said that the said order was passed by the
sanctioning authority without application of mind as
alleged

on

behalf

of

the

appellant.

Hence,

the

contention of the appellant relating to validity of
sanction is found to be without any substance and is,
therefore, rejected.
15.

Now adverting to the merits of the case, it

may be noticed at the outset that the appellant being
the Investigating Officer of a dowry death case has
heavily relied upon the fact that the relatives of the
deceased in

the

said case had

been contacting and

threatening him prior to the date of raid held on
2.11.1994 and that he had recorded such threats in his
case diary for 25.10.1995 and 29/3.10.1994 (Exhibits
DW-1/A,

DW-1/B

and

DW-2/A

respectively).

The

appellant has also submitted in his defence that the
father of the deceased (PW-2) had lodged a complaint
against him prior to the date of raid in the Vigilance

Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

Page 13 of 42

Department

on

19.9.1994

pursuant

to

which

a

departmental enquiry was held against him in which
after enquiry he was exonerated.
16.

The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant

had vehemently argued that since the relatives of the
deceased had an animosity with the appellant as they
were not satisfied with the investigation of dowry
death case done by the appellant, they had conceived a
plan in connivance with their another relative Mool
Chand,

further

contended

by

the

learned

Senior Counsel that neither there was any demand by
the appellant nor the bribe money was ever accepted by
him

from

any

of

the

relatives

of

the

deceased.

According to him, Constable Mool Chand ('Phoopha' of
the deceased) and deceased's father, Surinder Singh
(PW-2) were also the members of the raiding party and
were present at the time of raid on 2.11.1994 but the

advanced

In order to appreciate the above contentions
on

behalf

of

the

appellant,

it

would

be

necessary to refer to the explanation given by the
appellant in his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C.,
where he has given an explanation
in the present case.

why he was involved

The relevant portion of his

statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. is extracted below
:“......In November 1994 I was investigating a
criminal
dowry
death
case
bearing
FIR
no.294/94, PS Badarpur.
In this case,
Smt.Reema, d/o Surinder Singh PW was the
deceased.
The case was registered against
Mukesh and Ajit Singh, Kumari Bala and
Smt.Manju (the husband, father in law and
sisters in laws of the deceased).
I had
arrested Mukesh and Ajit Singh, However, the
two ladies, Kumari Bala and Smt.Manju had
applied for anticipatory bail.
They were
granted bail by the court of Sessions on
Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

Page 15 of 42

6.10.94, although I had opposed the bail
application.
Grant of anticipatory bail to
the ladies annoyed the family members of the
deceased, including the complainant and other
family members of the deceased.
Those
persons carried impression that bail was
granted by the court because of the weak
opposition though it was not the fact.
Surinder Singh, the father of the deceased
had complained against me to the Vigilance
Department and the DCP, South Distt.
Both
the witnesses had appeared in the inquiry in
my presence and their complaint was found
without any substance and the same was filed.
Surinder Singh, father of the deceased PW
went
to
the
court
of
ACMM
and
made
allegations against me that I was colluding
with the accused persons of dowry death case
and the Hon'ble Court recorded the statement
of Surinder Singh and his family members.
One Mool Chand Ct., of Delhi Police is
related and known person to Surinder Singh
and Surinder Kumar, PWs.
Mool Chand is not
an authorised person.
There has been many
complaints against his integrity and he is
facing departmental inquiry.
Criminal cases
stands registered against him.
He was the
person behind the screen to involve me in
this case.
On 29.9.1994 the said Mool Chand Const.,
Surinder Singh and Surinder Kumar came to the
Police Post and had threatened me that if I
failed to show the return of the dowry
articles, they will not allow me to remain in
service.
I recorded the threat in the case
diary dated 29.10.1994.
Such threats were
Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

Page 16 of 42

also extended to me on 25.10.1994 and I
recorded the said threat in my case diary on
25.10.1994.
I also recorded the threats in
daily diary dated 29/30.10.1994 of PP Sarita
Vihar....”
19.

The above statement of the appellant clearly

indicates that prior to the date raid was held on
2.11.1994, the relatives of the deceased had extended
threats to the appellant which was recorded by him in
his case dairy of 25.10.1994 and 29/30.10.1994.

The

case diaries containing the threats have been proved
by DW-1 and DW-2 as documents Exhibit DW-1/A, DW-1/B
and DW-2/A.
20.

The learned court below has taken note of the

plea of the appellant regarding the threats extended
to him by the relatives of deceased recorded in case
diary Exhibits DW-1/A, DW-1/B and DW-2/A and in this
regard it would be necessary to quote the observations

“77
PW-1
conceded
during
cross
examination that he accompanied by PW-2 had
visited and met the accused at PP on 2930/09/94. He however, denied that Const. Mool
Chand was with him on the said date. He
further denied the suggestion that he (PW2)
and Const. Mool Chand had extended threats to
the accused on the said dates. He further
denied the suggestion that similar threat was
given by him and others to the accused on
25.10.1994 and 29.10.1994. He stated that he
would not know if accused had made any entry
with regard to such threats in the case diary
or DD of P.S. It was suggested to him that he
was bearing grudge and ill will against the
accused and, therefore, had lodged false
complaint against him. He denied the said
suggestion
categorically.
Similar
suggestions about threats extended on 2930.09.94, 25.10.94 and 29.10.94 have also
been given to PW-2, who also denied the same,
also showing ignorance if any entry in this
regard had been made by the accused in the
case diary or general diary.
78
Accused
sought
to
prove
the
aforesaid entries in the case diary and daily
diary through DW-1 and DW-2. DW-1 Const.
Vikram Singh Proved the case diary no. 20 &
21 Ex. DW1/A and Ex. DW1/B pertaining to the
dowry death case referred to earlier. DW
proved DD No. 8 dated 29-30/09/94 vide copy
Ex. DW2/A in the hand of Const. Dhani Ram.
Ex. DW1/A is the copy of the case diary dated
25.10.94 while Ex. DW1/B is the copy of case
diary of 29.10.94, both purported to be in
the hand of the accused. In the case diary
Ex. DW1/A the accused, as I.O. of the dowry
death case, is shown to have recorded inter
alia that outside the Court, Const. Mool
Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

Page 18 of 42

Chand and some of his relatives had demanded
early restoration of dowry or else they would
take suitable action against him Ex. DW1/B.
Similarly inter alia also refers to Const.
Mool Chand and his relative Surinder Singh
(PW-2) having met again outside the Court and
having threatened to make a complaint against
him before superior officers. In this case
diary he also mentioned that the aforesaid
persons had gone away extending threats that
they would see him and that he would face
difficulty in his service.
98
I am not prepared to draw any motive
for false implication even from the daily
diary entry Ex. DW-2/A, which essentially
pertains to report recorded at the instance
of the accused as to what had transpired in
the Court on 29.10.94. Said entry no where
alleges any threats having been extended.
99
Case diaries Ex. DW-1/A & B on the
other hand however, perse appears to be
fabricated assumbly after involvement in this
case. Interestingly, the date and place of
occurrence mentioned in the said case diary
is described as 10.11.94, even though the
case diaries purport to have been recorded on
25.10.94 and 29.10.94. The case diary, even
otherwise, was a record within the control of
the accused. It is quite apparent that he
fabricated these case diaries so as to create
ground of defence in the case in hand.
Assuming such threats had been extended as
are fount reflected in these case diaries,
there is no explanation whatsoever on the
part of the accused as to what steps did he
take to ensure that the threats were not
translated into action.

Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

Page 19 of 42

100
It is inconceivable that a police
officer of the rank of Inspector would sit
quiet even on hearing threats from a police
official of as low a rank as a Constable. If
such incidents as alleged by the accused
actually happened they amounted to serious
misconduct, even penal offences, on the part
amongst others, of constable Mool Chand.
There was nothing stopping the accused from
initiating action against him under the law,
or through the department by way of reports
to his superiors. There is nothing on record
to indicate any such initiative on the part
of the accused.
101
Noticeably, the accused has himself
not entered the witness box to vouch safe the
acts pertaining to alleged threats received
by him on 25.10.94 and 29.10.94. The mere
reference to the case diaries through DW1
cannot result in the contents thereof being
held even remotely being proved. The fact
that accused avoided entering the witness box
to depose to such effect rather shows he
would
not
take
the
risk
of
facing
inconvenient
questions
in
the
nature
mentioned above, rendering the defence plea
further suspect.

21.

102
All said and done, I am of the
considered opinion that the theory of threats
by the Complainant side has been invented on
the basis of record that has been fabricated.
In these circumstances Chander Bhan Vs.
Stated 73 (1998) Delhi Law Times, 318 (as
relied upon by defence) is distinguishable on
facts.”

The Apex Court in the case of

Rabindra Kumar Dey V/s. State of Orissa (1976) 4 SCC
233 had observed as under :“It is true that under Section 105 of the
Evidence Act the onus of proving exceptions
mentioned in the Indian Penal Code lies on
the accused, but this section does not at all
indicate the nature and standard of poof
required.
The

Act
does
not
contemplate that the accused should prove his

the Prosecution is required to prove a

principles referred to above, it follows
that, it is sufficient if the accused is able
to prove his case by the standard of
preponderance of probabilities as envisaged
by Section 5 of the Evidence Act as a result
of which he succeeds not because he proves
his case to the hilt, but because probability
of the version given by him throws doubt on
the prosecution case and, therefore, the
prosecution
cannot
be

applicable to the accused, where he is called

consider and weigh the defence of the appellant in the
light of the above judgment of the Apex Court on the
aspect of standard of proof required from the accused
to prove his defence.

In my view, the learned trial

court went wrong in drawing an adverse presumption and
in not believing the entries contained in the case

DW-1/A,

DW-1/B

and

DW-2/A,

on

the

premise that the appellant himself did not enter the
witness box.

Such an approach was wholly erroneous in

view of the admission made by the relatives of the

(PW-1

PW-2)

in

the

course

of

their

testimony in the trial that they had contacted the

appellant on several dates prior to the date raid was
held on 2.11.1994.

Further more, the view taken by

the learned trial court that the entries contained in

are

fabricated

documents

only

because

the

date

of

10.11.1994 is mentioned there in the column of date of

It seems that the learned court below has

mistaken itself in taking the said date for construing
the case diaries as fabricated documents.

This date

of 10.11.194 mentioned in the above mentioned case

On the face of the above admissions made by

PW-1 and

PW-2 in

court

below in the present case and particularly, in view of
the written complaint made by PW-2, Exhibit PW-2/D-2,
it does not stand to reason how the court below could
have

the

plea

of

the

appellant

regarding

animosity between the complainant and the appellant
prior to the date of raid.

Since the appellant has

proved through cogent evidence that the relatives of
the deceased were entertaining hostility against him
prior to the date of raid, it was the bounden duty of
the court below to have scanned the entire evidence

In Jaswant Singh V/s.State of Punjab Air 1973

SC 707 it was held by the Supreme Court that in a
bribery case the complainant is an interested witness

Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

Page 31 of 42

and his evidence must be considered with great caution
and it can be accepted when this is corroborated by
other evidence adduced by the prosecution.

Court in its judgments particularly in State of UP

of

that

this

witness

Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

with

relative

Page 32 of 42

Constable Mool Chand was present throughout the raid
and it was contended that even the tainted money was
kept in the drawer of the appellant by Constable Mool
Chand but for reasons best known to the prosecution,
their

presence

during

raid

was

concealed

from

the

Court. In order to establish this plea, the learned
senior counsel had referred to the testimony of PW-2
Surinder Singh and had also relied upon the statement
of this witness Ex. DC recorded during departmental
proceedings

held

against

the

appellant

on

the

complaint of the deceased's father. It was contended
that PW-2 Surinder Singh in his testimony before the
Court has testified that he was not present at the
time of raid and had left for his village from the
office of his co-brother Surinder Kumar at Maharani
Bagh, New Delhi. It was pointed out that this stand
taken by PW-2 during trial of the

present case is in

complete contradiction to the stand taken by him in
his statement Ex. DC during departmental proceedings
wherein he has stated that he was very much present

Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

Page 33 of 42

during raid and also that the bribe money was accepted
by the appellant in his presence. The factual aspect
in regard to the above pointed out during arguments
cannot be said to be without substance. What learned
senior

counsel

had

contended

on

the

above

factual

aspect is in fact born out from the record of this
case. It seems that the above material contradiction
regarding

presence

or

absence

of

deceased's

father

during raid was completely overlooked by the court
below. The fact that the deceased's father (PW-2) was
present with the raiding party at the time of raid is
also born out by his answer to question No. 9 during
departmental

proceedings

and

the

same

is

extracted

below:“Q.no.9. Whether any formalities regarding
preparation of papers was done at the Police
Post before proceeding to the CBI office?

32.

Ans.
It was not done at least in my
presence. I was made to sign certain papers
in the CBI office.”
The above answer given by the deceased's

father

to

question

No.

9

during

departmental

proceedings clearly implies that though he was present
Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

Page 34 of 42

during

raid

but

the

formalities

regarding

the

preparation of papers were completed in the CBI Office
and not at the spot. In case the deceased's father was
present during raid, why the prosecution withheld his
presence creates a serious doubt on the story of the
prosecution. Even the presence of Constable Mool Chand
who was also a close relative of the deceased has also
been established through the testimony of PW-3, PW-5 &
PW-7.

The relevant portions of their testimony in

their cross- examination are extracted below :“PW3, Jitender Kumar, stated as follows:Treated notes were thereafter handed
over to the Mool Chand or complainant
Surinder Kumar. I am not sure about it.
Complainant was directed to hand over the
tainted notes to the accused in the event of
specific demand. Mool Chand was directed to
act as a shadow witness and tried to see the
transaction as well as hear the conversation.
He was further directed to give signal to the
raiding party by placing his hands over his
hairs in the event of acceptance of bribe by
accused........ We left CBI office at about
6:00pm. And proceeded towards Police Post
Sarita Vihar. Official vehicles were parked
at a distance of half kms. From the Police
Post and we all got down. Thereafter Surinder
Kumar, Tahir Hussain, Mool Chand and father
of the girl proceeded towards the Police Post
Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

Page 35 of 42

Sarita Vihar. We three remaining members of
the raiding party took position outside the
Police Post. 20/25 minutes later, Mool Chand
came out of the Police Post and gave signal
by placing his hand over his head........ It
is incorrect to suggest that at time no
person
by the name of
Mool Chand was
present
in
the
office
of
Shri
S.K.
Peshin............. I know
Mool Chand
because one person during the pre-raid
proceedings was introduced to me as
Mool
Chand. Said
Mool Chand of medium built. It
is incorrect to suggest that no person with
the name of
Mool Chand was present in the
CBI office nor any such person was introduced
to me.......... I had conversation with Mool
Chand on the date of raid. During the
conversation I came to know that said
Mool
Chand was Constable in Delhi Police and that
he was related to complainant Surinder Kumar.
PW-5, Tahir

34.

We are now left only with the testimony of

the complainant (PW-1). On giving a close look to the
testimony of this witness, he does not appear to be a

witness

and

conviction

cannot

be

based

solely on his testimony. Though PW-1 Surinder Kumar
has

admitted

in

his

cross-examination

that

the

statement Ex. DC of his co-brother PW-2 Surinder Singh
was recorded during departmental proceedings against
the appellant in his presence in which PW-2 had taken
a stand that he was present during raid but still PW-1
has testified during trial that neither Constable Mool
Chand nor his co-brother Surinder Singh was present
during raid. PW-1 has not denied that the drawer of
the

table

in

which

tainted

money

was

kept

was

unlocked. The prosecution has not proved that it was
not possible for a third person to go and keep the
tainted money in the unlocked drawer. The testimony of

had

discussion in the inner room attached to his room and
there the appellant had agreed to reduce the bribe
money from Rs. 5,000/- to Rs. 4,500/- appears to be
far from truth. The site plan Ex.PW-3/A does not show
existence of inner room attached to the room of the
appellant. The absence of inner room in the site plan

completely

belies

the

testimony

of

about any such conversation relating to reduction of

be

significant to mention that the deceased's father (PW2) has testified in his chief that he did not carry
the required bribe money at the time it was demanded
by the appellant at Patiala House Courts on 02.11.94.
In his cross-examination, he took a U-turn on this
aspect and stated that he carried Rs. 5,000/- with him
when he left his house for meeting the appellant on
02.11.94. How the deceased's father would know that
the appellant would make a demand only of Rs. 5,000/which he carried with him while he left the home in
the morning. This indicate a pre-conceived plan in the

Crl. Appeal no.340/2002

of

for

threats

have

already been extended by them to him much prior to the
date of raid. This aspect of the matter also seems to
has been ignored by the court below and creates a
serious doubt on the prosecution version against the
appellant.
35.

The court below has placed heavy reliance on

the conduct of the appellant in his running away from
the spot on seeing the raid party. As per testimony of
trap laying officer (PW-9) S.K. Peshin, Inspector R.S.
Tokas, Inspector R V S Lohmar, Inspector S R Singh,
Inspector D M Sharma and Sub-Inspector Rai Singh were
also the members of the raid party but the site plan
