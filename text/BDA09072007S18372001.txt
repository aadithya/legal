BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J
1.

This is an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil

Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'the CPC') filed on behalf of the
defendant requesting this court to reject the plaint on the ground that the suit
appears from the statements in the plaint to be barred by limitation.

2.

The suit has been filed for specific performance of an alleged oral

agreement to sell entered into between the defendant as the owner and the
plaintiff as the intending purchaser of the property bearing No. C-10, Chirag
Enclave, New Delhi-110 048. It is alleged by the plaintiff that the plaintiff
came in occupation of the property being an employee of a company known as
IA 6049/02 in CS(OS)1837/01

Page No. 1 of 6

'Modi Rubber Limited'. The said company was the tenant of the defendant.
The plaintiff claims to have occupied the premises sometime in May, 1980. It
is alleged that in October 1986, an oral agreement to sell was entered into
between the plaintiff and the defendant whereby the defendant agreed to sell
50% of his share in the land and the entire terrace rights of the building thereon
to the plaintiff for a sum of Rs 6 lakhs. It is alleged in the plaint that a sum of
Rs 3.6 lakhs was paid to the defendant's brother and a further sum of Rs 0.40
lakhs was paid to the defendant in cash. The balance amount of Rs 2 lakhs was
to be paid in installments to the wife and daughter of the defendant.

3.

It is further alleged by the plaintiff that in February 1990, the defendant

agreed to sell the entire property for a total sum of Rs 21 lakhs. The plaintiff
alleges to have paid a sum of Rs 11.33 lakhs in cash in total by 1993. It was
alleged that the defendant was not executing the sale deed because his mother
was still alive and that the same became executable only in 1993 when his
mother died (she actually died as stated in 1992 by the defendant). It is alleged
that in March, 1993, the plaintiff requested the defendant to execute the sale
deed but the same was not being executed.

4.

It is an admitted fact that in 1996, the defendant filed an eviction suit

against its tenant (Modi Rubber Limited). In February, 1997, the plaintiff
moved an application in that suit seeking impleadment as a defendant. By an
IA 6049/02 in CS(OS)1837/01

Page No. 2 of 6

order passed in January, 2001, the plaintiff was added as defendant No.2 in the
said eviction suit without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties.
The rent in respect of the premises was paid by Modi Rubber upto May, 1999
and now the same was being paid by the plaintiff.

5.

It is also an admitted position that an amendment application under

Order 6 Rule 17 had been filed by the plaintiff herein (defendant No.2 in the
eviction suit) for amending his written statement to include a counter-claim. As
stated in para 14 of the plaint, the plaintiff had moved the said application
under Order 6 Rule 17 on 20.04.2001 and the same was dismissed by the
learned Additional District Judge by his order dated 27.07.2001. It is, however,
not mentioned in the plaint as to what was the nature of the counter-claim that
the plaintiff herein was seeking in the said eviction suit. Though, alongwith the
plaint, the plaintiff filed a list of documents and the documents. One of the
documents was a copy of the order rejecting the application of the plaintiff
under Order 6 Rule 17 of the CPC in the said eviction suit. A reading of the
said order discloses that the counter-claim was in essence a plea for specific
performance of the very same agreement which is the subject matter of the
present suit. One of the grounds of rejection of the amendment application was
that the amendment sought was in respect of a plea which was barred by
limitation. The learned Additional District Judge held as under:-

IA 6049/02 in CS(OS)1837/01

Page No. 3 of 6

“11. First and foremost whether an amendment seeks to extend
the limitation, where the claim is clearly barred by time. In the
instant case the introduction of specific performance of contract
would require the amendment to be filed within specified period
and for the purpose of specific performance Article 54 of
Limitation Act would apply. Specially the latter part of the said
article where no period is specified, the refusal to perform would
constitute the notice and the beginning of limitation for specific
performance and in the instant case the defendant No.2 required
and demanded of the plaintiff to execute the sale deed in March
1993. And the amendment sought to be made through an
application dated 20.04.2001 is clearly beyond the period of
limitation prescribed for suit for specific performance and
accordingly the relief claimed through amendment would be
barred by limitation.”
6.

In the context of these circumstances, it was urged on behalf of the

applicant / defendant that the issue of limitation with regard to the plea of
specific performance already stands settled by the order dated 27.07.2001
whereby the amendment application of the plaintiff in the eviction suit was
rejected. Instead of filing an appeal against that order, the plaintiff, shortly
thereafter, filed the present suit on the same grounds. Apart from this, even on
the facts as mentioned in the plaint, the plaint has been presented beyond time
and the same is liable to be rejected as such.

7.

The plaintiff resisted this application on the ground that the plaint has

not been filed beyond time and that if there is a contentious issue with regard to
limitation, then there is no question of rejecting the plaint under Order 7 Rule
11. For this purpose, he relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the

IA 6049/02 in CS(OS)1837/01

Page No. 4 of 6

case of Liverpool & London S.P. & I Associated Ltd v. M.V. Sea Success I
and Another: 2004 (9) SCC 512. The learned counsel for the plaintiff also
referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Popat and Kotecha
Property v. State Bank of India Staff Association: 2005 (7) SCC 510 to
submit that in an application under Order 7 Rule 11, only the statements in the
plaint ought to be seen and not the defence raised by the defendants.

8.

It is true that while examining an application under Order 7 Rule 11,

only the plaint and the material presented alongwith the plaint can be seen. If
upon an examination of the plaint and the admitted documents filed alongwith
the plaint it appears that the plaint is barred by any law (in this case law of
limitation), then the plaint is liable to be rejected [See: Sanjay Kaushish v.
D.C. Kaushish and Othrs: AIR 1992 Delhi 118 (para 16)]. In the present
case, it is quite clear that the issue with regard to the plea of specific
performance being barred by limitation has already been decided by the order
dated 27.07.2001 whereby the learned Additional District Judge rejected the
plaintiff's application in the eviction suit for bringing out the amendments to his
written statement so as to include a counter-claim based on the said plea of
specific performance. In my view, once that had been done and no appeal had
been preferred therefrom, no occasion arose to enable the plaintiff to file a suit
shortly thereafter seeking a decree of specific performance.

9.

In any event, the limitation prescribed for a suit for specific performance

of a contract as per Article 54 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963 is
three years. The time from which the period begins to run is the date fixed for
the performance or, if no such date is fixed, when the plaintiff has notice that
the performance is refused. As per the averments made in the plaint, there was
no dated fixed for the performance. Therefore, the time from which the period
begins to run would be when the plaintiff had notice that performance was
refused. The averments contained in the plaint disclose that the plaintiff asked
the defendant to execute the sale deed in March, 1993, but he did not.
Therefore, the starting point of limitation would be March, 1993. The suit was
filed on 05.09.2001. It was beyond the period of three years stipulated under
the Limitation Act, 1963. Accordingly, the suit is time barred and the plaint is
liable to be rejected on the ground that the suit appears from the statements
made in the plaint to be barred by any law (in this case the law of limitation).

10.

This application is allowed. The plaint is rejected with costs.
