SANJIV KHANNA, J:

1.

M/s Jyoti Farms, Ms. Usha Wadhwa, Mr. Kanwar Lal Gupta,

Mr. Rakesh Kohli & Mr. Rajesh Kohli (hereinafter referred to as the

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

2

petitioners) are owners/recorded bhumidars of land located in the
revenue estate of village Bijwasan, New Delhi. Ms. S.M. Stella
Kujur, respondent No. 2, is Principal of Sarvodaya Kanya
Vidhaylaya, which is located in khasra No. 50, village Samalka,
New Delhi.

It is alleged that there is a demarcation dispute

between the petitioners and the respondent No. 2 in respect of a
small portion of land, which is being used by the petitioners for
ingress and egress to their land in village Bijwasan.

It is the

contention of the petitioners that the raasta or road falls in khasra
Nos. 80/16/1 and 80/15/2 of village Bijwasan, whereas the
respondent No. 2 claims that the raasta or road is part of khasra
No. 50 of village Samalka.
2.

One Mr. Om Prakash Taneja was granted a lease of three

bighas of land in khasra No. 50 by the Gaon Sabha village
Samalka on 10th March, 1975. The lease was for a period of six
years and was to expire on 9th March, 1981. It is the case of
respondent No. 2 that the Gaon Panchayat cancelled the lease on
23rd February, 1978 and refunded the balance lease money of
Rs.1,350/- to Mr. Om Prakash Taneja by cheque.
3.

The respondent No. 2 school was established in the year

1976 on 23 bighas 4 biswas of land in khasra No.50 of village
Samalka. The said khasra comprises of 26 bighas and 4 biswas.
It is the case of respondent No. 2 that Gaon Sabha vide resolution

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

3

dated 8th May, 1980 donated three bighas of land, which was
earlier on lease with Mr. Om Prakash Taneja to the said school.
Thus, the said school has become owner/bhumidar of entire 26
bighas and 4 biswas of land in khasra No. 50, village Samalka.
4.

It appears that claim in respect of 3 bighas of land and right

of Mr. Om Prakash Taneja on the land was continuously asserted
by him. In the meanwhile, Mr. Om Prakash Taneja in 1993 sold
and transferred his rights in land in Bijwasan in favour of the
petitioners, while retaining bhumidari rights in respect of part area.
5.

In March, 1997, the Government of Delhi initiated action for

removal of encroachments on Gaon Sabha land. This prompted
Mr. Om Prakash Taneja to file Writ Petition (Civil) No. 1013/1997
in Delhi HIgh Court claiming that he was bhumidar of 43 bighas of
land in village Bijwasan and his possession was being disturbed
and interfered with. The writ petition was disposed of by order
dated 11th March, 1997, inter alia, observing as under:“The plea as to whether the disputed land
belongs to the petitioner or the Gaon Sabha
cannot be entertained in this writ petition and
can be relied in the proceedings before an
appropriate forum is permissible in law.
These proceedings, as stated by learned
counsel for the petitioner, have since been
initiated. Therefore, no orders can be passed
in this writ petition in exercise of powers under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India as it will
require adjudication of facts and the petitioner
has already availed of an alternative remedy
in this regard.
The respondents shall,
however, not disturb or interfere with the

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

4

lawful enjoyment of the land by the petitioner
and will not interfere with his right of ingress
and egress in respect of the land over which
has valid and legal title. This will be, in any
case, subject to the ultimate occasion in the
proceedings which the petitioner has taken to
agitate has(sic) rights. No further orders are
necessary in this writ petition. The same is
disposed of.”

6.

Thus, Hon’ble Court felt that the issue with regard to

demarcation should be examined by the revenue authorities but
subject to final decision it was directed that the respondents would
not interfere with right of ingress and egress to land of which Mr.
Om Prakash Taneja had legal and valid title.

Subsequently, a

review application or clarification application being CM No.
2114/1994 was filed and disposed of on 25th March, 1997. The
said order records that Mr. Om Prakash Taneja had moved
applications under Sections 27 and 28 of the Delhi Land Revenue
Act, 1954

(hereinafter referred to as the Act, for short) for

demarcation of land and these would be decided within a period of
four weeks and in the meanwhile Mr. Om Prakash Taneja and his
family/employees would be granted reasonable and unobstructed
passage for ingress and egress.
7.

Mr. Om Prakash Taneja had on 11th March, 1997 filed an

application under Section 28 of the Act for demarcation of the land
stating, inter alia, that he was bhumidar of 43 bighas of land in the
revenue estate of

village Bijwasan, which adjoins and shares

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

5

boundary with village Samalka. The application also states that
khasra No. 50 of village Samalka adjoins Mr. Om Prakash
Taneja’s land on eastern boundary and dispute exists about proper
demarcation of the area and possession of land.

On this

application, notice was issued to Mr. Rajendra Gupta, who is
owner of adjacent land in village Bijwasan, M/s Jyoti Farms and
Wadhwa Farms, respondent No. 2 as well as village pradhan.
Demarcation of the entire area was done by the Revenue
Assistant/SDM, Vasant Vihar. On 5th August, 1997, preliminary
demarcation report was made and thereafter on 26th September,
1997 final demarcation report was made. Order of the Revenue
Assistant/SDM records that the demarcation was done on the
basis of permanent points fixed by demarcating officer in khasra
Nos. 2 and 3 of village Kapashera and the entire exercise
thereafter was carried out. It was noticed that the dispute was with
regard to location and boundary of khasra No. 81/16/1 of village
Bijwasan and khasra No. 50 of village Samalka (i.e. the same
dispute as in the present case). As per the said report, owner of
the farm house of khasra No. 80/16/2 viz. Mr. Rajendra Gupta had
encroached upon land belonging to Mr. Om Prakash Taneja. It
was further held in the demarcation report that Mr. Om Prakash
Taneja had no right, title or interest of any kind in the passage or
for ingress and egress in khasra No. 50 of village Samalka whose

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

6

boundary wall extended upto the stone wall. Observing that
owners of khasra No. 80/16/2 of village Bijwasan had encroached
upon khasra No. 80/16/1 belonging to Mr. Om Prakash Taneja, he
was asked to take legal action against bhumidhar of khasra No.
80/16/2.
8.

Mr. Rajiv Yaduvanshi, Collector (South West) by order dated

30th July, 1999 rejected the appeal filed by Mr. Om Prakash Taneja
under Section 64 of the Act. Thereupon, Mr. Om Prakash Taneja
filed a writ petition in this Court, which was withdrawn in view of
the alternative remedy by way of revision under Section 66 of the
Act before the Financial Commissioner. The revision petition filed
by Mr. Om Prakash Taneja was also dismissed on 27th September,
1999. It also appears that Mr. Om Prakash Taneja had filed a civil
suit and Civil Writ No. 2991/1998. In the civil suit, initially status
quo was ordered to be maintained. In the writ petition by order
dated 19th June, 1998 it was directed that the respondents therein
would not block access to the residence of Mr. Om Prakash
Taneja by constructing any wall.

Ultimately, however, no final

order was passed in favour of Mr. Om Prakash Taneja.

The

demarcation report has attained finality.
9.

Parent Teacher Association of respondent No. 2 school also

filed a writ petition in this Court being Civil Writ No. 2272/1997. On
21st Febraury, 2000, in this writ petition a detailed order was

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

7

passed by a Single Judge after noticing order dated 12th June,
1998 passed by Sub-Divisional Magistrate in respect of the
boundary dispute.

Learned Single Judge of this Court after

noticing the said order issued following directions:“There appears to be dispute between the
respondents 4 & 5 with regard to status,
position, location and title of the land in
question. In order to ascertain the factual
position, in my considered opinion, it is
necessary that a fresh demarcation be carried
out at the site of the land in question along
with the adjacent land so as to ascertain as to
whether the petitioner has a right of passage
of ingress and egress from the Najafgarh
Road and such a passage used by him is
illegally blocked. The aforesaid demarcation
shall be carried out by the Sub Divisional
Magistrate,
Vasant
Vihar
under
the
supervision of the collector. The aforesaid
demarcation process would commence on
23.2.2000 and shall be completed positively
by 24.2.2000. It shall also be indicated in the
said report to be submitted before this Court
as to the area of land to which the school
authority is entitled to showing in the map the
point to which land of the school extends to.
The report shall also indicate the status and
position of the Gaon Sabha land which is
stated to be adjacent to the land of the
applicant and the school. The report along
with the map shall be placed in this Court by
the evening hours of 24.2.2000 and the matter
shall be taken up on 25.2.2000.”

10.

Subsequently on 10th March, 2000 another order was passed

in this abovementioned writ petition directing, inter alia, right of
ingress and egress to Mr. Om Prakash Taneja in terms of the
Order of this Court passed on 11th March, 1997 in Civil Writ No.

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

8

1013/1997. Reference in this regard was also made to the order
passed by Additional District Judge in Suit No. 270/1997, directing
the parties to maintain status quo as on 24th July, 1997 in respect
of 3 bighas of land that was earlier granted on lease to Mr. Om
Prakash Taneja.

The Court also recorded that an application

under Section 27 of the Act was pending before the appropriate
authority and the same was required to be disposed of at an early
date in accordance with law.
11.

Pursuant to the directions given in the order dated 21st

February, 2000 as quoted above and the order dated 10th March,
2000 in Civil Writ No. 2272/1997, Deputy Commissioner (South
West) passed an order recording his findings under Section 27(2)
of the Act. Thereafter another order was passed on 3rd May, 2002
by Deputy Commissioner (South West), Mr. Rajiv Yaduvanshi.
This aspect has been dealt with and examined later on. It is the
case of the petitioners that in the demarcation report it has been
held that the raasta/road in question is located in village Bijwasan
and not in village Samalka and therefore is not located on the land
of the respondent no.2 school i.e. khasra No. 50 of village
Samalka.
12.

On 21st June, 2000, Director (Panchayat) passed an order

allotting three bighas of land in khasra No. 50 of village Samalka to
respondent No. 2 school on premium of Rs.9,10,000/- and subject

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

9

to payment of annual ground rent of Rs.22,750/- per acre per year.
The said order, however, recorded that the allotment would not
include the land comprising ten feet wide passage leading to the
farm of Mr. Om Prakash Taneja in view of the directions of the
High Court in interim order dated 10th March, 2000 and the said
allotment would be subject to the decision of the High Court in Civil
Writ No. 2272/1997.
13.

This writ petition was disposed of on 16th September, 2002

after taking on record the office order dated 21st June,2000 passed
by Director (Panchayat). Learned Single Judge held that the entire
dispute in the writ petition was only in respect of three bighas of
land, which stands transferred to the school in view of the order
dated 21st June, 2000. While disposing of the writ petition, the
learned Single Judge recorded as under:“In view of the aforesaid, it is clarified that the
interim order 10.3.2000 will not come in the
way of implementation of the final decision
taken on 3.5.2000 and the subsequent order
dated 21.6.2000 subject of course to any
other orders which may have been passed by
any competent Court.”

14.

The interim orders passed in this writ petition ceased to exist

and the entire three bighas of land was transferred to the
respondent No. 2 school. The contention of the respondent No. 2
and

Parent

Teacher

Association

is

that

the

preliminary

demarcation reports dated 5th August, 1997 and the final

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

demarcation report
final and binding.

10

dated 26th September, 1997 have become
In

view of the said reports, the petitioners

cannot question and challenge that the passage or raasta/road
falls in khasra No. 50 in village Samalka. The petitioners cannot
contend and raise any claim that the said passage falls in village
Bijwasan. It is, therefore, submitted that there is no question of
any fresh demarcation and the petitioners in terms of the said
demarcation report should initiate proceedings against the
owners/bhumidars of Hans Raj Gupta Farm.
15.

The petitioners, on the other hand, states that their only

access to the plots and residence is through this raasta/road and if
this is closed, they will not have access to their land and property.
The site plans have been shown, which indicate that in case the
raasta/road is blocked, the petitioners will not have any access to
their land, which is circled by land belonging to third parties and
this is the only passage to their land.
16.

The petitioners cannot claim right of passage through land in

village Samalka.

They are owners of land in village Bijwasan.

Right of passage has to be given to the petitioners through village
Bijwasan and not through the land of village Samalka.

The

petitioners cannot claim any right in khasra No. 50 including three
bighas of land, which were subject matter of lease in favour of Mr.
Om Prakash Taneja in 1975. The said issue is also concluded and

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

11

decided by judgment dated 16th September, 2002 holding that the
respondent No. 2 school is owner of entire land in khasra No. 50 of
village Samalka. In case the petitioners had any grievance against
the demarcation reports dated 5th August, 1997 and 26th
September, 1997, they should have filed appeals or proceedings
challenging the order dated 12th June, 1998 passed by Revenue
Assistant/SDM. Only Mr. Om Prakash Taneja had filed appeals
against the said order. The petitioners have accepted the said
order, though there is evidence on record that they were served
before

demarcation

proceedings

were

undertaken.

The

demarcation order having attained finality operates as res-judicata.
Principle of res judicata is based on equity, good conscience and
justice that issue once raised and decided, should not be allowed
to be raised again. The cause merges with the decision. It bars
retrial. The petitioners cannot challenge the demarcation reports
made on 5th August,1997 and 26th Sept.,1997.
17.

Orders dated 21st February, 2000 and 10th March, 2000

passed in Civil Writ No. 2272/1997 and the subsequent orders
passed by the Tehsildar dated 25th April, 2000 have, however,
complicated the issue. Order dated 21st February, 2000 has been
quoted above. Direction was given for fresh demarcation in spite
of earlier demarcation reports. Order dated 10th March, 2000 also
refers to an application under Section 27, which was stated to be

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

12

pending before appropriate authorities. However, the said orders
were interim orders that have lost their relevance after Civil writ
petition No. 2272/1997 was disposed of on 16th September, 2002.
Earlier demarcation reports dated 5th August,1997 and 26th
Sept.,1997 have not been set aside and declared as incorrect by
any court including proceedings in W.P. (C) No. 2272/1997. The
reports have attained finality and are binding.
18.

The demarcation report dated 25th April, 2000, it was stated

by the petitioners, is contrary to the demarcation reports dated 5th
August, 1997 and 26th September, 1997.

For the sake of

convenience, I am reproducing the relevant portion of the
demarcation report dated 25th April, 2000:“
The Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya and
the
Directorate
of
Education
has
misinterpreted the orders of Hon. High Court
dated_____ for construction of wall where it
originally existed. Thereby, they have left the
Samalkha Village and entered into the
Bijwasan Village and constructed a walls in a
manner so that the right of ingress and egress
of the following persons has been closed.
1.
Sh. O.P. Taneja in Kh. No. 80/15/2 min
measuring 6 Biswa and 80/16/1 min. 6 Biswa
of Bijwasan Village measuring______Biswa.
2.
Sh. H.K. L. Maggu in Kh. No. 80/16/1 of
Bijwasan Village measuring 5 Biswa.
3.
Sh. Satish Wadhwa in Kh. No. 80/15/1
of Bijwasan Village measuring 5 Biswa.
Additionally, they have encroached upon 3
Bigha of Gaon Sabha Land in Kh. No. 50 of
Samalkha Village belonging to B.D.O. (South
West), Panchayat Department which were
given on lease to Sh. O.P. Taneja till 1990
and High Court in its Order dated 10.3.2000

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

13

has held that the same is to be treated as in
the possession of Sh. O.P. Taneja
Respondent No. 4 as the land could only be
taken back from him in accordance with law
and not in any other manner.
The following is the list of persons best
entitled to the land and for making entries
Annual Register on the basis of possession.
1.
Sh. O.P. Tajeja in Kh. No. 80/16/2
Bijwasan Village.
2.
Sh. H.K.L. Maggu in Kh. No. 80/16/1
Bijwasan Village.
3.
Sh. Satish Wadhwa in Kh. No. 80/16/1
Bijwasan Village.
The Right of way through Kh. No. 50 of
Sh. O.P. Taneja existed which is defined by a
road 10 feet wide and 500 feet long and
having 40 (forty) Ashoka Pendulam Trees
planted on both sides by Sh. O.P. Taneja
since 1980.
The remaining land is in
possession of the B.D.O. (South West) and
Panchayat Department.
A map showing
solution is enclosed. Hence, in pursuance or
order of Hon. High Court dated 10.3.2000 and
the order dated 24.07.1997 of Hon. ADJ Court
for maintaining status quo. The following
entry is to be made in Kh. No. 50 of Samalkha
Village:1.
Sh. O.P. Taneja:Road 16 ½ feet
wide and 365 feet long (bounded by 40
Ashoka Trees on both sides) total measuring
13 Biswas as shown in enclosed map.
Portion marked as “A”.
2.
Gaon Sabha Samalkha through B.D.O.
South West area of 2 Bigha 8 Biswa (3 Bigha
12 Biswa) marked as “B”.
3.
Sarvodya Girls School, Samalkha 23
Bigha 4 Biswa marked as “C”.”

19.

There is merit in the contention of the respondents that the

order dated 25th April, 2000 does not record the basis of the
findings and the findings themselves are contradictory. In the first

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

14

portion of the finding, the Tehsildar records that respondent No. 2
school has left Samalka village and entered Bijwasan village. It
also records that the school has encroached upon three bighas of
Gaon Sabha land in khasra No. 50. It further records that the
pathway existing on the land in question is ten feet wide and five
hundred feet long and the same is located in khasra No. 50. The
said khasra is of village Samalka and not of village Bijwasan. This
becomes clear if one sees the last portion of the report dated 25th
April, 2000. It is mentioned in the last portion of the report that
Gaon Sabha is in possession of two bighas and eight biswas of
land and respondent No. 2 school is in possession of 23 bighas
and 4 biswas of land in khasra No. 50 of village Samalka. The
balance portion of land in khasra No. 50 of village Samalka is in
possession

of

Mr.

Om

Prakash

Taneja.

The

Deputy

Commissioner (South West), Delhi Mr. Rajiv Yaduvanshi vide his
order dated 3rd May, 2000 accepted the said report and had
observed that the petitioners’ right to ingress and egress had been
violated by blocking their passage in khasra Nos. 80/16/1 and
80/16/2 of village Bijwasan. Mr. Rajiv Yaduvanshi had, in fact,
passed the earlier order dated 30th July, 1999 rejecting the appeal
of Mr. Om Prakash Taneja challenging demarcation reports dated
5th August, 1997 and 26th September, 1997. Perhaps the earlier
order dated 30th July, 1999 passed in the appeal filed by Mr. Om

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

15

Prakash Taneja was not brought to the notice of Mr. Rajiv
Yaduvanshi, when he passed the order dated 3rd May, 2000.
20.

I may also note here that the demarcation report dated 25th

April, 2000 does not mention how and in what manner
demarcation was done.

The permanent points on the basis of

which the calculation was done, are not stated. Without first
locating permanent points it is not possible to carry out
demarcation. Calculations can be done only after locating
permanent points. It is also not stated whether any notice was
given to respondent No. 2 and Gaon Sabha Samalka before the
demarcation was done. In this regard, learned counsel for the
respondent No. 2 has also drawn my attention to Section 27 of the
Act.

Section 27(1) of the Act relates to settlement of disputes

regarding entries in the annual register or whether a particular area
of land is held and occupied for public purpose or work for public
utility. Section 27(2) of the Act, on the other hand, states that all
other disputes relating to entries in the annual register shall be
decided by the Tehsildar on the basis of possession.

Section

28(1) of the Act stipulates that all disputes regarding boundaries
shall be decided by Deputy Commissioner on the basis of existing
survey maps, but if this is not possible, boundaries shall be fixed
on the basis of actual possession. Sub-Section 2 also provides for
an enquiry to be made in case Deputy Commissioner is unable to

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

16

satisfy himself as to the party, who is in possession or if it is shown
that possession has been obtained by forceful eviction of lawful
occupants of the property. I, therefore, find merit in the contention
of the learned counsel for the respondents that the demarcation
report dated 25th April, 2000 under section 27(2) of the Act and
order dated 3rd May, 2000 under 28 (2) of the Act have to be
ignored and cannot be accepted. The demarcation reports dated
5th August, 1997 and 26th September, 1997 have attained finality.
The demarcation reports and the order passed on 12th June, 1998,
were made subject matter of appeal and then revision before the
Financial Commissioner, but were upheld.

The demarcation

reports and the said order cannot and should not be allowed to be
reopened.
21.

Yet at the same time I am conscious and concerned that the

petitioners should not be denied access to their land, which is
blocked on all sides. To deny access and right of ingress and
egress will cause hardship and inconvenience to the petitioners,
which cannot be accepted.

To some extent, the petitioners

themselves are responsible for the said hardship as they have
failed to abide by the directions given in the order dated 12th June,
1998, whereby it was left to the owners/bhumidars to initiate
proceedings against bhumidars of khasra No. 80/16/2 of village
Bijwasan. The petitioners have not taken any action thereafter.

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

17

Even the owners of the said khasra have not been impleaded as a
party to this writ petition.
22.

The Revenue Authorities in their counter affidavit have stated

as under:“The so-called rasta for ingress/egress falls in
khasra No. 50 of Villge Samalka and not in
khasra No. 80//16/1 (0-11) and 80//15/2 (0-11)
of Village Bijwasan as per the demarcation
dated 05/08/1997 and 26/09/1997. As far as
the petitioner’s claim of grant of passage for
ingress/egress is concerned, it is submitted
that since the petitioners are Bhumidars of
Village Bijwasan, the Rasta/Passage should
be granted from alnd in Village Bijwasan only.
The petitioners may file a request for grant of
passage for ingress/egress before the
Consolidation Officer, Village Bijwasan as the
consolidation proceedings are still on.”

23.

Keeping in view the above facts and balancing out equities, it

is directed as under:(i)

Liberty is granted to the petitioners to initiate
proceedings against owners/bhumidars of khasra No.
80/16/2 or to file an application before Consolidation
Officer of village Bijwasan for providing alternative
access/road to the petitioners.

(ii)

The petitioners may file an application/representation
in this regard within a period of three weeks from the
date judgment is pronounced.

The Consolidation

Officer or the revenue authorities will process the

W.P. (C) No. 3774-78/2006

18

application/representation

filed

by

the

petitioners

expeditiously and preferably within a period of three
months thereafter. The demarcation reports dated 5th
August, 1997 and 26th September, 1997 will be binding
on the authorities.
(iii)

Each of the five petitioners will pay Rs.1,000/- per
month to respondent No. 2 school for use of the
passage till alternative passage is made available to
the petitioners. Petitioners will not be entitled to carry
out any construction or install any gate on the passage
but the petitioners; their employees/servants will be
entitled to use the same. If the aforesaid arrangement
is continued beyond six months, then each of the five
petitioners will be liable to pay enhanced amount of
Rs.1500/- per month to the respondent No. 2 school.
In case there is delay beyond a period of 12 months
the respondent No. 2 will be entitled to file an
application in this Court for further enhancement of the
