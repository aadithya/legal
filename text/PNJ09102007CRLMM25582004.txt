Petitioners, Directors of the company M/s. Cargill

India Ltd., impleaded as accused Nos. 4, 5 and 6 in a complaint
filed by the respondent No. 1 under Section 7 read with Section
16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act 1954 seek
quashing of the complaint as also the summoning order dated
27.8.2003.

Page No.1 of 17

2.

The brief facts of the case are as follows:-

A.

On 15.2.2002 at about 6.30 P.M. the complainant, a

food inspector visited the premises of 'M/s. Sharma Shud Ghee
Bhandar' sole proprietory firm of Sh. Kaushal Kumar Sharma.
He purchased a sample of 'Refined Soyabean Vegetable Oil', a
food article. 'M/s. Sharma Shud Ghee Bhandar' was found
stocking and exhibiting for sale the said food article.
B.

The sample consisted of 3 x 1 ltr. of 'Refined

Soyabean Vegetable Oil'. The sample was divided into 3 equal
portions and each separate portion was independently packed,
fastened and sealed as per the PFA Act and Rules in the
presence of Kaushal Kumar Sharma and a witness Ranjit Singh.
C.

One of the sealed portion of sample along with the

copy of Form VII was sent separately to public analyst on
18.2.2002.

The remaining two sealed portions and copies of

Form VII were sent to the local health authority, Delhi on the
same day as per the relevant provisions of the PFA Act and
Rules.
D.

The report of the public analyst dated 6.3.2002

revealed that sample bears statements like 'Is good to your
heart'; 'Helps to lower risks of heart decease and may even
prevent cancer'.

The public analyst opined that the said

statements are exaggeration of the quality of the product and

Page No.2 of 17

thus the sample in question is misbranded.

He, however,

opined that the oil conformed to the standard.
E.

Investigations revealed that vendor 'M/s. Sharma

Shud Ghee Bhandar' had purchased the sampled commodity
from M/s. Goyal Brothers which was a proprietorship concern of
Sh. Vinod Goyal. That M/s. Goyal Brothers had purchased the
sampled commodity from the company M/s. Cargill India Ltd.
and that the said company was marketer of the sampled
commodity.

That M/s. Cargill India Ltd. had purchased the

sampled commodity from the company Malwa Vanaspati and
Chemical Co. Ltd. which was the manufacturer of the sampled
commodity.
F.

Since the PFA Act fastens criminal liability on the

vendor, supplier, distributor/marketer and manufacturer, the
food inspector i.e. respondent No. 1 herein filed a complaint
under Section 7 read with Section 16 of the PFA Act against
under noted persons:S. Name

It was inter-alia alleged in the complaint that since

the sample in question was misbranded, the accused persons
have violated the provisions of Section 2 (ix) (e) (g) of the PFA
Act read with Rule 37-D of the PFA Rules and therefore were
liable to be convicted under Section 7 read with Section 16 of
the PFA Act.
4.

Factual allegations made in the complaint against

the petitioners are in para 3 of the complaint which reads as
under :“
The vendor has purchased the sampled
commodity from M/s Goyal Brothers, N-61 A, Laxmi
Nagar,
Delhi-92.
M/s
Goyal
Brothers,
is
a
proprietorship concern and Sh. Vinod Goyal s/o Sh.
Girdhari Lal is the proprietor of the said firm. M/s Goyal
Page No.4 of 17

Brothers has purchased the sampled commodity from
M/s Cargill India Ltd., A-53, Okhla Industrial Area,
Phase-II New Delhi-20. M/s Cargill India Ltd. are the
Marketier of the sampled commodity and is Limited
Company consisting of three directors namely Sh
Hardeep Singh s/o late Sh.Brig Ajit Singh (2) Sh.
Sidhant Khosla s/o Sh. Maharaj Krishan Khosla and (3)
Sh. Amitabh Gupta s/o Sh. K.C. Gupta. No nominee has
been appointed by the company hence all the three
directors as well as the firm are liable.”
5.

On a prima facie consideration of the complaint and

documents

filed

along

with

the

complaint,

the

learned

Metropolitan Magistrate summoned the accused persons to
face trial for an offence under Section 7 read with Section 16 of
the PFA Act.
6.

During hearing of the instant petition, the learned

counsel for the petitioners submitted that the report of the
public analyst do not show as to how the public analyst had
come to the conclusion that the sampled commodity was
misbranded.
7.

The statements on the label

of

the sampled

commodity are as under :(i)

Is good to your heart.

(ii)

Helps to lower risks of heart disease and may even

prevent cancer.
8.

The report of the public analyst records that the

afore-noted statements are violative of provisions of Section
2(ix)(e)(g) of PFA Act and Rule 37-D of PFA Rules.
Page No.5 of 17

9.

To appreciate the contention advanced by the

learned counsel for the petitioners, it is necessary to analyze
afore-noted statements in the light of Section 2(ix)(e)(g) and
Rule 37-D.
10.

11.

Section 2(ix)(e) and (g) reads as under :“
(ix) “misbranded”- an article of food shall be
deemed to be misbrandedxxxxx
(e) if false claims are made for it upon the label
or otherwise.”
xxxxx
(g) if package containing it, or the label on the
package bears any statement, design or device
regarding the ingredients or the substances containing
therein, which is false or misleading in any material
particular; or if the package is otherwise deceptive
with respect to its contents;”
Rule 37-D of the PFA Rules reads as under :“Labelling of edible oils and fats – The package,
label or the advertisement of edible oils and fats shall
not use the expressions “Super-Refined”, “ExtraRefined”' “Micro-Refined”, “Double-Refined”, “UltraRefined”, “Anti-Cholesterol”, “Cholesterol Fighter”,
“Soothing
to
Heart”,
“Cholesterol
Friendly”,
“Saturated Fat Free” or such other expressions which
are an exaggeration of the quality of the Product.”

12.

is

meant

by

expression

“

such

other

expressions which are an exaggeration of the quality of the
Product”?
13.

In the decision reported as M/s Grasim Industries Ltd

v Collector of Customs, Bombay AIR 2002 SC 1706, the
doctrine of 'esjudem generis' was explained as under :“11. In the background of what has been urged by
Page No.6 of 17

the assessee it has to be further seen whether the
principles of ejusdem generis have application. The
rule is applicable when particular words pertaining to
a class, category or genus are followed by general
words. In such a case the general words are construed
as limited to things of the same kind as those
specified. The rule reflects an attempt to reconcile
incompatibility between the specific and general
words in view of the other rules of interpretation that
all words in a statute are given effect if possible, that
a statute is to be construed as a whole and that no
words in a statute are presumed to be superfluous.
The rule applies only when (1) the statute enumerates
the specific words, (2) the subjects of enumeration
constitute a class or category, (3) that class or
category is not exhausted by the enumeration, (4) the
general terms follow the enumeration and (5) there is
no indication of a different legislative intent. If the
subjects of enumeration belong to a broad based
genus, as also to a narrower genus there is no
principle that the general words should be confined to
the narrower genus. In interpreting Section 30 of the
United Towns Electrical Company Act, 1902 which
reads: "the company shall be liable for water rates on
all lands and buildings, owned by it in the aforesaid
town, but otherwise shall be exempted from taxation",
the Privy Council rejected the contention that the word
"taxation" should be considered ejusdem generis with
"water rate". It was held that there is no room for
application of the principle in the absence of any
mention of a genus, since the mention of a single
species for example of water rates does not constitute
a genus. [See: United Towns Electric Co. Ltd. vs. A.G.
for Newfoundland 1939 (1) ALL ER 423 PC]. The rule
cannot be applied unless there is genus constituted or
a category disclosed. If the preceding words do not
constitute mere specifications of a genus but
constitute description of a complete genus, the rule
has no application. The rule has to be applied with
care and caution. This is not an inviolable rule of law,
but it is only permissible inference, in the absence of
any indication to the contrary. Where the context and
the object and mischief of the enactment do not
require restricted meaning to be attached to words of
general import it becomes the duty of the Courts to
give those words their plain and ordinary meaning.
Page No.7 of 17

Following enunciation in Craies on Statute Law
(Seventh Edition) at page 181 succinctly states the
principle.
"The modern tendency of the law, it was
said, [by Asquith J in Allen v. Emmerson
(1944) KB 362)] is " to attenuate the
application of the rule of ejusdem generis."
To invoke the application of the ejusdem
generis rule there must be a distinct genus
category. The specific words must apply not
to different objects of a widely differing
character but to something which can be
called a class or kind of objects. Where this
is lacking, the rule cannot apply, (HoodBarrs v. IRC (1946) 2 All ER 768) but the
mention of a single species does not
constitute a genus. (Per Lord Thankerton in
United Towns Electric Co. Ltd. v. Att.
General for Newfoundland (1939) 1 All ER
423). "Unless you can find a category," said
Farwell L.J., (in Tillmans and Co. v. S.S.
Knutsford (1908) 2 KB 385) "there is no
room for the application of the ejusdem
generis doctrine," and where the words are
clearly wide in their meaning they ought not
to be qualified on the ground of their
association with other words. For instance,
where a local Act required that "theatres
and other places of public entertainment"
should be licensed, the question arose
whether a "fun-fair" for which no fee was
charged for admission was within the Act. It
was held to be so, and that the ejusdem
generis rule did not apply to confine the
words "other places" to places of the same
kind as theatres. So the insertion of such
words as " or things of whatever
description" would exclude the rule.
(Attorney General v. Leicester Corporation
(1910) 2 Ch. 359). In N.A.L.G.O. v. Bolton
Corpn. (1943) AC 166) Lord Simon L.C.
referred to a definition of "workman" as any
person who has entered into a works under
a contract with an employer whether the
contract be by way of manual labour,
Page No.8 of 17

clerical work "or otherwise" and said: "The
use of the words 'or otherwise' does not
bring into play the ejusdem generis
principle: for 'manual labour' and 'clerical
work' do not belong to a single limited
genus" and Lord Wright in the same case
said: "The ejusdem generis rule is often
useful or convenient, but it is merely a rule
of construction, not a rule of law. In the
present case it is entirely inapt. It
presupposes a 'genus' but here the only
'genus' is a contract with an employer".
14.

Thus, the expression “ such other expressions which

are an exaggeration of the quality of the product” must take
it's meaning and color from the preceding words occurring in
Rule 37-D.
15.

It is medically known that cholesterol has a direct link

to the health of the heart. Excessive cholesterol block the
arteries of the heart. Thus expressions which relate to the
product and links the same to the health of the heart would
prima facie come within the mischief of Rule 37-D.
16.

It was then urged by the learned counsel for the

petitioners with reference to the Rule 32 of the PFA Rules that
the packing and labelling of food article is the responsibility of
manufacturer of food article and therefore no offence can be
alleged against present petitioners who are the directors of the
company which markets the sampled commodity.

Page No.9 of 17

17.

PFA Act fastens criminal liability on the vendor,

distributor/marketer and manufacturer of a food article. Being
directors of the company which markets the sample commodity, the
petitioners are prima facie liable. However, the statute recognizes a
defence available to an accused other than manufacturer to show
that said accused purchased the commodity from a manufacturer.
On proof thereof, said accused would earn an acquittal.

The

petitioners would thus have to establish at the trial that they
purchased the sampled commodity from the accused no.7 company.
18.

It was lastly urged by the learned counsel for the

petitioners that it is settled law that the vicarious liability of a person
for being prosecuted for an offence committed by the company
arises only when there are specific and clear allegations/averments
in the complaint that at the material time, such person was incharge of and responsible to the company for conduct of business of
the company or that the offence was committed with the consent or
connivance

of such person or attributable to neglect on his part.

Learned counsel submitted that the complaint is totally silent in this
regard and in the absence of such averments in the complaint and
without adding or subtracting anything in the complaint, no offence
is made out against the petitioners.

Learned counsel further

submitted that the Magistrate failed to appreciate that the
petitioners are made accused solely because they happened to

be the directors of the company at the relevant time. Counsel

Learned counsel for the State contended that not

only the complaint, but material made available along with the
complaint have also to be taken into consideration to find out
whether prima facie case is made out against the persons
arrayed as accused in the complaint. He further contended that
when the documents accompanying the complaint show that
the persons named as directors of a company are responsible
for the business of the company and are incharge of the affairs
of a company it is sufficient material for the magistrate to take
cognizance of the offence against said persons.
20.

Relevant part of Section 17 of the PFA Act reads as

under:“Offences by companies (1) Where an offence under this Act has been
committed by a company (a) (i) the person, if any, who has been nominated
under sub-section (2) to be in charge of, and
responsible to, the company for the conduct of the
business of the company (hereafter in this section
referred to as the person responsible), or
(ii) where no person has been so nominated, every
person who at the time the offence was
committed was in charge of, and was responsible
to, the company for the conduct of the business of
the company; and
•

(b) the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of
the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded
against and punished accordingly:

Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section
shall render any such person liable to any
punishment provided in this Act if he prove that the
Page No.12 of 17

offence was committed
without his knowledge
and that he exercised all due diligence to prevent
the commission of
such offence.
(2) Any company may, by order in writing, authorise
any of its directors or managers (such manager being
employed mainly in a managerial or supervisory
capacity) to exercise all such powers and take all
such steps as may be necessary or expedient to
prevent the commission by the company of any
offence under this Act and may give notice to the
Local (Health) Authority, in such form and in such
manner as may be prescribed, that it has nominated
such director or manager as the person responsible,
along with the written consent of such director or
manager for being so nominated.

(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the
foregoing sub-sections, where an offence under this
Act has been committed by a company and it is
proved that the offence has been committed with the
consent or connivance of, or is attributable to, any
neglect on the part of, any director, manager,
secretary or other officer of the company [not being a
person nominated under sub-section (2) such
director, manager, secretary or other officer shall
also be deemed to be guilty of that offence and shall
be liable to be proceeded against and punished
accordingly.

21.
there

Under the scheme of Section 17 of the PFA Act,
are three

categories

of

individuals,

who

can

be

proceeded against and punished for an offence committed by
the company. They are :(i) persons nominated by the company.
(ii) persons in-charge of and responsible to the company for
conduct of business of company.
(iii) any director or other official of the company.
Page No.13 of 17

22.

Section 17(1)(a)(i) is a deeming provision which

stipulates that when the offence is committed by the company,
the person who is nominated under Sub Section 2 of Section 17
shall be deemed to be a person in-charge of and responsible to
the company for conduct of business of the company and can
be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
23.

However, in the absence of any nomination by the

company, every person, who at the time of commission of
offence was in-charge and was responsible to the company for
conduct of business of the company can be proceeded against
and punished accordingly for an offence committed by the
company. [Section 17(1)(a)(ii)]
24.

Even when there is a nomination, and it is yet

proved that the offence has been committed with the consent,
connivance or neglect on the part of any director, manager,
secretary or other official of the company, such director,
manager, secretary or other official shall also be deemed to be
guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded
against and punished. [Section 17 (4)]

25.

In the decision reported as Municipal Corporation of

Delhi v Ram Kishan Rohtagi AIR 1983 SC 67 the Supreme Court
was considering a complaint filed against the persons who

Page No.14 of 17

were Manager and Directors of the company under Sections 7
and 16 of the PFA Act. It was observed :“It
is,
therefore,
manifestly
clear
that
proceedings against an accused in the initial stages
can be quashed only if on the face of the complaint or
the papers accompanying the same, no offence is
constituted. In other words, the test is that taking the
allegations and the complaint as they are, without
adding or subtracting anything, if no offence is made
out then the High Court will be justified in quashing
the proceedings in exercise of its powers under
Section 482 of the present Code.”
26.

In the light of the decision of the Supreme Court in

Ram Kishan's case (supra), the order summoning the accused
has to be tested in the light of the material before the learned
Metropolitan Magistrate when he summoned the petitioners. I
may note that the company has not made any nomination
under Section 17.
27.

The Memorandum and Articles of Association of

accused no.3 company was filed along with the complaint.
Clause 19 and 20 thereof read as under:“19. The business of the Company shall be managed
by the Directors who may pay all expenses incurred in
setting up and registering the Company and may
exercise all such powers of the Company as are not
restricted by the act or any statutory modification
thereof for the time being in force or by these Articles
required to be exercised by the Company in general
meeting subject nevertheless, to any regulations of
these Articles, to the provisions of the Act, and to such
regulations being not inconsistent with the aforesaid
regulations or provisions as may be prescribed by the
Company in general meeting. Noting shall validate any
prior act of the Directors, which would have been
Page No.15 of 17

valid, if that regulation had not been made.”

28.

“20. The following persons are the Directors of the
Company on the date of adoption of these Articles :1.
Mr. Hardeep Singh
2.
Mr. Amitabh Gupta
3.
Mr. Sidhant Khosla”
The afore-noted clauses clearly shows that the

petitioners were in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of
business of accused no. 3 company.
29.

In the decision reported as Drugs Inspector, Palace

Road, Bangalore v Dr. B.K. Krishnaiah & Anr AIR 1981 SC 1164
a complaint was filed against the respondent who were
partners of a firm for prosecution for offences under Section
(18)(a)(vi) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. The High
Court quashed the complaint on the ground that there were no
allegations in the complaint that the “respondents were, in any
manner, in-charge of and responsible to the firm for conduct of
the business of the firm.” Noting that a partnership deed
showing the constitution of the firm was filed along with the
complaint, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the High
Court observing as under :-

“6. The only question for consideration for the High
Court in this case was whether the accused or any of
them were liable. In paragraph 17 of the complaint
petition the complainant quoted the provisions of the
Act. In addition, he cited the names of witnesses,
submitted a list of documents including a copy of the
partnership deed at item No. 13 of the list of the
Page No.16 of 17

documents. The learned Magistrate perused the
partnership deed and prima facie found that the
respondents as well as the deceased accused were
liable for the offence and proceeded for trial. The
learned High Court committed an error in holding that
there was no allegation that the respondents were not
responsible for the management and conduct of the
firm The extent of their liability would be established by
evidence during trial. In our opinion the judgment of the
learned High Court is erroneous and is liable to be set
aside.”
30.

In view of above discussion, no ground for quashing

the present complaint and summoning order dated 27.8.03 is
made out.
31.

Keeping in view the fact that the petitioners are not

manufacturers but marketers of the sampled commodity, they
are granted exemption from personally appearing before the
