1.

There has been some controversy with regard to the extent of payment

that the judgment debtor has to make to the decree holder in full and final
satisfaction of the decree. The arbitrator had awarded an amount of Rs
1,23,56,587/- as well as a sum of Rs 38,25,000/- in favour of the decree
holder. Interest on encashment of the bank guarantee to the extent of Rs
8,84,500/- had also been awarded by the arbitrator. The total of the amounts
awarded under the award came to Rs 1,70,66,087/-. The learned arbitrator
had also awarded interest @ 15% per annum on the amount of Rs

1,23,56,587/- and Rs 38,25,000/- till realisation or the date of the decree
whichever was earlier. The amount had not been paid. An application had
been moved for making the award a rule of the court and the same was done
on 06.01.1995. Therefore, the date of the decree would be 06.01.1995. On
the date of the decree, the amount payable by the judgment debtor to the
decree holder was Rs 2,76,24,471/-. This became the decretal amount.
While making the award a rule of the court, this court directed that the said
amount would be payable alongwith interest @ 12% from the date of decree
till realisation.

2.

A sum of Rs 1.5 crores was paid by the judgment debtor by way of

deposits made in court in two installments of Rs 75 lakhs each made on
02.01.1997 and 16.01.1997. The decretal amount plus interest calculated
upto 16.01.1997 would come to Rs 3,42,92,480/-. After deducting the
amount of deposit made, the balance amount remaining to be paid as on
16.01.1997 would be Rs 1,92,92,480/-. The interest on this balance amount,
which entirely consisted of part of the principal amount, would run @ 12%
from 17.01.1997 to 17.01.2008.

The extent of interest would be Rs

2,54,66,074/-. Therefore, the amount payable as of today by the judgment
debtor to the decree holder would be Rs 4,47,58,554/-. This settles the
controversy with regard to the extent of the liability of the judgment debtor
under the decree.

3.

It must be noted that the counsel for the decree holder had claimed a

much higher sum, as indicated by the computations submitted by him. He
submitted that the amount of Rs 3,47,05,918/- as stated in the execution
petition initially is incorrect and the amount due to the decree holder is
actually Rs 5,71,45,231/-. The learned counsel for the judgment debtor had
contended that the amount payable by the judgment debtor was Rs
1,83,70,503/-.

4.

I have examined the matter in detail and have come to the conclusion

that both the judgment debtor and the decree holder are wrong in their
computations. The computation has already been clarified above. A sum of
Rs 4,47,58,554 stands payable by the judgment debtor to the decree holder
as on 17.01.2008. In case the said payment is not made by the judgment
debtor to the decree holder within two weeks, the account of the judgment
debtor bearing No.05011001154 in Dena Bank, 46, Ground Floor, Scope
Complex, Lodi Road, New Delhi-110003 would stand attached to the said
extent for the purpose of realisation of the decretal amount. The judgment
debtor shall not transfer any funds from the said account other than for the
purposes of making payment under the decree in excess of the decretal
amount as determined above.
This petition stands disposed of.
