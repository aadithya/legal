1.

The petitioner was enrolled in the Army on 25.01.1972 and

sought voluntary retirement on compassionate grounds due to
domestic problems in December, 1991.

The petitioner was also

assessed at 20 per cent disability attributable to military service.
W.P.(C) 18034/2006

Page No.1 of 6

However, in view of the own request of the petitioner, the
petitioner was released from service with 20 per cent disability.
The PCDA(P), however, rejected the claim of the petitioner for
disability pension on the ground that the disability of the petitioner
was only 14-19 per cent and thus below the benchmark of 20 per
cent.

The petitioner was asked to appear before the Re-Survey

Medical Board on 16.08.1996 when his disability was again
assessed by the Medical Board at 30 per cent but the PCDA(P)
again reduced the same to 14-19 per cent.
2.

The petitioner aggrieved by the same filed an appeal before

an Appellate Committee which was also rejected on 20.09.1999.
The petitioner appeared before the Re-Survey Medical Board and
thereafter on 23.03.2001 and his disability was again assessed at
30 per cent. The PCDA(P) once again on 13.10.2001 rejected the
case of the petitioner by reducing his disability to 14-19 per cent.
The appeal of the petitioner this time succeeded before the
Appellate Committee which directed the PCDA(P) to grant disability
pension to the petitioner for 20 per cent disability in terms of the
order dated 13.08.2003.

The PCDA(P) consequently granted the

disability pension to the petitioner with effect from 01.05.1992 at
the rate of Rs.310/- per month, but the pension disbursing
authority on 03.01.2005 refused to implement the PPO and advised
the petitioner to get the same amended.
3.

The

PCDA(P),

however,

issued

a

corrigendum

dated

15.03.2005 cancelling the PPO dated 13.02.2004 in toto on the
ground that the petitioner had sought voluntary discharge and thus

4.

It is not dispute that there are two aspects which arise for

consideration in the present case.

The first is in respect to the

decision taken by the PCDA(P) on the various occasions referred to
aforesaid whereby the PCDA(P) sought to decrease the percentage
of the disability of the petitioner as assessed by the Medical Board.
This issue is no more res integra in view of the judgment of the
Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.164/1993 titled Ex.Sapper
Mohinder Singh v.Union of India decided on 14.01.2003. This
aspect has been examined in depth by a Division Bench of this
Court in the matter of Ex Singalman Shri Bhagwan v. Union of India
& Ors; 103 (2003) DLT 269 where conclusions have been set out in
para 199, which is re-produced as under:
“199. We have considered the various submissions
ably made by a large number of learned counsels on
an issue involving a deep study of all kinds of
administrative instructions and orders. We have
also gone through the judgments cited above. The
legal principles that can be derived from the
decisions of the Courts and the interpretation of
various rules, regulations and orders are as follows:Generally:
(1) Disability pension is granted to an individual who
is boarded out from
serivce:(a) On account of a disability.
(b) The disability is attributable to or aggravated
by military service.

W.P.(C) 18034/2006

Page No.3 of 6

(c) The disability is assessed at 20% or above.
The determination of attributability or aggravation
is as per the 1961 Entitlement Rules or the 1982
Entitlement Rules as the case may be. [Regulation
173].
….
….
….
….
….
….
….
(9) The opinion of a Medical Board that examines an
individual will have primacy over the opinion of any
other medical authority (including the opinion of a
"next higher medical authority" or even the Medical
Adviser (P) attached to the office of the CDA or the
CCDA) unless that other medical authority has also
examined
the
individual.
[Mohinder
Singh].
Alternatively, the Medical Board may reconsider its
opinion after a fresh examination of the individual.
[Raghubir Singh]. The exception to this will be in
case where the "next higher medical authority" or the
Medical Adviser (P) takes a view which favours the
individual.

208. Having heard submissions on the facts of many
such cases, we are of the view that as a thumb rule it
may be appropriate if the law of limitation as it applies
to civil suits is applied in such situations. Therefore,
claims for grant of disability pension may be
entertained despite a great delay, but the delayed
claim should not be granted for a period exceeding
three years prior to the date of filing the writ petition
unless the individual has been diligently pursuing the
matter with the Respondents or has made
a
representation which has not been disposed of by the
Respondents. This will, of course, depend on the facts
of each case and no binding rule can be laid down in
this regard.”

5.

The second aspect which arises is the question of rejection of

the disability pension on the ground that the petitioner had sought
discharge himself. This issue again is also no more res integra in
view of the judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in Mahavir
Singh Narwal v. Union of India & Anr; AISLJ Volume II 2005(1) 133.
It has been held that what is relevant is not how the person was
discharged but whether he acquired disability attributable to or
W.P.(C) 18034/2006

Page No.4 of 6

aggravated by his military service.
It was observed as under:
6. On careful perusal of the aforesaid rule it is
manifestly clear that invalidated from service is
necessary condition for grant of disability
pension. What has to be sent for entitlement for
disability pension is whether an individual at the
time of his release was in a low medical category
than that in which he was recruited if it was so
then such person will be treated as invalidated
from service. It is the admitted case of the
parties that at the time of recruitment the
petitioner did not have any disability.”

6.

A special leave petition filed before the Supreme Court

against the judgment in Ex.Sapper Mohinder Singh’s case (supra)
has been dismissed in limine on 04.01.2008. Since the Re-Survey
Medical Board assessed the disability of the petitioner at 30 per
cent, the said view would prevail over any observations made by
PCDA(P) and thus the assessment of the disability pension would
be made accordingly.
7.

A number of connected matters which were awaiting the fate

of the Supreme Court Judgment have now been allowed by this
Court

including

the

case

in

WP(C)10942/2004

decided

on

31.03.2008 titled Ex.Lance Naik Balwan Singh v. Union of India &
Ors.

8.

The result of the aforesaid is that the denial of the pension to

the petitioner on both the aforesaid accounts cannot be sustained
and the petitioner would be entitled to the disability pension.
9.

A writ of mandamus is issued directing the respondents to

release the disability pension of the petitioner in the aforesaid
terms and the arrears be remitted to the petitioner within a
W.P.(C) 18034/2006

Page No.5 of 6

maximum period of three months from today.
10.

The petition is accordingly allowed leaving the parties to bear

their own costs.
