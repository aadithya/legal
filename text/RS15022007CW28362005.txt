This writ petition has been filed seeking a direction to the

W.P.(C) 2836/2005

respondent to grant all benefit and arrears of salary to the
petitioner w.e.f. 24.8.1999.
It so happened that an enquiry was conducted against the
petitioner while he was working with the respondent as a Junior
Engineer. The report of the Enquiry Officer fortunately for the
petitioner went in his favour. When the matter came before the
Disciplinary Authority it disagreed with the finding of the
Enquiry Officer and passed an order dated 21.8.2000 imposing
major penalty upon the petitioner of reduction by four stages in
his time scale of pay for a period of four years with further
stipulation that he will not earn any increment of pay during the
period of reduction. The petitioner preferred an appeal against
this order to the Appellate Authority which by order dated
20.7.2001 reduced the penalty to reduction by one stage for one
year in his present time scale with cumulative effect.
Aggrieved by the orders of the Disciplinary Authority and
the Appellate Authority, the petitioner preferred a writ petition
in this Court seeking quashing of the orders dated 21.8.2000
and 20.7.2001. This Court by order dated 9.5.2002 relying upon

two judgments of the Supreme Court in Punjab National Bank
and others v. Kunj Behari Misra AIR 1998 S.C. 2713 and
Yognath D.Bagde v. State of Maharashtra and another AIR 1999
S.C.3734 held that the orders passed by the Disciplinary
Authority and then by the Appellate Authority were liable to be
quashed as the Disciplinary Authority while disagreeing with the
finding of the Enquiry Officer did not provide an opportunity to
the petitioner to satisfy it that a conclusion different from the
one arrived at by the Enquiry Officer was not warranted. It is
submitted that despite the order of this Court quashing the
orders of the disciplinary authority and the appellate authority
the consequential benefits have not been paid to the petitioner
and it is this inaction of the respondent which has led him to file
the present petition seeking direction to the respondent to pay
the consequential benefits.
According to learned counsel for the respondent, this
Court while quashing the orders passed

by the Disciplinary

Authority and the Appellate Authority gave no direction to the
respondent to pay the consequential benefits.

The said

page 3

submission is being noticed only to be rejected for it is
elementary that if the orders impugned in a writ petition have
been quashed, status-quo-ante has to follow.

In the present

case the orders of the disciplinary authority and the appellate
authority having been held to be not in conformity with the
decisions rendered by the Supreme Court,

the order of the

Enquiry Officer gets restored. Therefore, to contend, that the
respondent is not obliged to pay consequential benefits is to
render the judgment nugatory.
It is also sought to be contended by learned counsel for
the respondent that this Court in its order dated 9.5.2002 had
granted opportunity to the respondent to issue a fresh show
cause notice to the petitioner giving reasons as to why
Disciplinary Authority is disagreeing with the Enquiry Officer
and, therefore, the proceedings which were initiated against the
petitioner did not come to an end.

Accordingly, it is further

contended that it cannot be argued by the petitioner that it is
the order of the Enquiry Officer which will hold the field. It is
stated that a fresh show cause notice has already been issued to

W.P.(C) 2836/2005

the petitioner and the proceedings pursuant thereto are
pending. This submission is only a repeat of the earlier
submission except that it has been put differently.
In view of what has been noticed above , the writ petition
is allowed. The respondent is directed to pay to the petitioner
consequential benefits which he became entitled to upon this
court having quashed the orders of the disciplinary authority
dated 21.8.2000 and 20.7.2001 passed in a earlier writ petition
No.6386/2000.
