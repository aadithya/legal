This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment and decree

page 1of 13

passed by the learned Additional District Judge in Suit No. 460/2004 dated
3rd August, 2007 wherein a decree was passed in favour of the respondent
and against the appellant for the sum of Rs.3,90,000/- together with interest
@ 9% per annum with effect from 14th October, 2004 till the realization of
the entire decretal amount.
2.

The facts of the case are restated as follows: -

a.

The appellant was engaged in the transport business. In the month of

December 1998, the appellant approached the respondent no.1 for some
financial assistance as he was facing tremendous financial problems.
b.

The respondent no.1 considered the request of the appellant and paid

him a sum of Rs.7,73,000/- on 1st December, 1998.

The appellant

acknowledged having received an amount of Rs.7,73,000/- by executing a
note dated 1st December, 1998.
c.

The appellant assured the return of the loan in the monthly installment

of Rs.30,000/- on 22nd of each month.

RFA No.575/2007

The appellant paid a sum of

page 2of 13

Rs.3,83,000/- in cash as well as through cheques on different dates.
d.

On 20th November, 2001 the appellant again executed a receipt

thereby confirming the balance payable amount as Rs.3,90,000/-. The
appellant assured the respondent no.1 that he would repay the outstanding
amount in monthly installments of Rs.10,000/-.
e.

A cheque for Rs.5000/- dated 22nd June, 2003 drawn on United Bank

of India, Kirti Nagar, New Delhi issued by the appellant in favour of the
respondent no.1 on presentation was returned dishonoured with the remarks
“Insufficient Funds”.
f.

The respondent no.1 served a legal notice thereby demanding a total

sum of Rs.3,92,565/- along with interest @ 24% per annum on 4th October,
2004.
3.

The learned counsel for the appellant Shri M.R. Vig contended as

follows:
a)

The balance due from the appellant was shown on a paper as

RFA No.575/2007

page 3of 13

7,73,000/- which does not show what that figures of 7,73,000/- is and to
whom it is due. It also does not show the name of the father of the appellant
nor the address of the appellant from whom it is due. The name and address
of the witness has also not been given on it.
b)

The balance due from the appellant has been shown on 20 th October,

2001 as Rs.3,90,000/-. The paper had been written by respondent no.1
himself which has been denied by the appellant. This papers has also not
been witnessed by any person.
c)

A cheque of Rs.5,000/- was issued by the appellant on 22nd June 2003

which was dishonoured for the reasons “insufficiency of funds in account”.
However, the cheque in question was never issued by the appellant towards
the outstanding amount of the loan. The appellant never took loan from
from the respondent No.1, rather the respondent no.1 being on friendly terms
with the appellant had requested him for a loan of Rs.5,000/- and the
appellant had issued the said cheque in favour of Respondent no.1 towards

RFA No.575/2007

page 4of 13

advancing loan to the respondent no.1 which he stated that he had arranged
from other sources.
d)

Subsequently, the respondent no.1 informed the appellant that he had

not presented the cheque for encashment as he had arranged the loan from
some other person in cash. The appellant made several requests to the
respondent no.1 to return the cheque but the respondent no.1 withheld the
same with his malafide intention.
4.

The principal plea raised by the learned counsel for the appellant is

that the alleged extended loan of Rs.7,73,000/- to the appellant has not been
accepted by the appellant

and the alleged note is defective and not

acceptable in the eyes of law. The learned Additional District Judge framed
the following issues on 11th January 2007:
1.

interest whatsoever? OPP
Relief.”

By his judgment dated 3rd August 2007 the learned Additional District

Judge decided the above mentioned issues in favour of the respondent and
against the appellant with the following observations:
“9.
Onus to prove this issue was on the
defendant. However, defendant has not led any
evidence to show that plaintiff is a money lender
and that he required a money lender's license before
extending loan to the defendant. A friendly loan
can be extended by any person. Accordingly, this
issue is decided in favour of the plaintiff and
against the defendant.
10.
Both these issues are inter related and are
decided together. PW1 has stated that defendant
was in financial problems and had approached the
plaintiff for some financial assistance. PW1 has
categorically deposed that he had extended loan of
Rs.7,73,000/- to the defendant on 01.12.1998.
Defendant acknowledged the loan by executing a
note dated 01.12.1998. This document has been
proved by the plaintiff as Ex.PW1/1 and it bears
signatures of the defendant. Ex.PW1/1 has also
been witnessed by one Mr. Shyam Sunder. In his
cross examination defendant has admitted that Mr.
Shyam Sunder was his maternal uncle. DW1 has

RFA No.575/2007

page 6of 13

further deposed that PW1/1 does not bear either his
signatures or signatures of his uncle Mr. Shyam
Sunder. However, he has not produced Mr. Shyam
Sunder in the witness box to depose to this effect.
He has also deposed that defendant had paid a sum
th
of Rs.3,83,000/- uptil 20 October 2001. Details
given in affidavit shows that a sum of Rs.30,000/each was paid on 22.12.1998, 21.01.1999 and
22.02.1999. A sum of Rs.10,000/- each was paid
on
09.04.1999,
24.04.1999,
23.08.1999,
12.09.1999, 5.12.1999, 13.01.2000, 16.01.2000,
12.02.2000 and 12.03.2000. A sum of Rs.20,000/was paid on 26.03.1999. A sum of Rs.15,000/each was paid on 06.05.1999, 12.06.1999 and
27.7.1999. A sum of Rs.9,000/- was paid on
14.10.1999. A sum of Rs.8,000/- each was paid on
14.02.2000, 18.05.2000 and 13.06.2000. A sum of
Rs.7,500/- each was paid on 15.07.2000,
17.08.2000 and 12.09.2000. A sum of Rs.7,000/each was paid on 13.10.2000, 13.11.2000,
14.12.2000 and 15.01.2001. A sum of Rs.6,000/each was paid on 15.02.2001, 18.04.2001 and
19.06.2001. Similarly, a sum of Rs.5,800/- each
was paid on 18.05.2001 and 20.10.2001. A sum of
Rs.5,500/- each was paid on 20.07.2001 and
20.09.2001. A sum of Rs.6,200/- was paid on
21.08.2001. In cross examination no question has
been put to PW1 that these payments were not
made by the defendant to the plaintiff. Rather PW1
has reiterated in his cross examination that the
payments detailed in para six of his affidavit were
made by the defendant in cash as well as through
cheques. He has deposed that receipts were issued
by him to the defendant. The plea taken by the
plaintiff that defendant had paid a sum of

RFA No.575/2007

page 7of 13

Rs.3,83,000/- on different dates towards
acknowledgment dated 20.10.2001 duly signed by
the defendant at point 'X' and which has been
proved as Ex.PW1/2. DW1 has deposed that
Ex.PW1/2 did not bear his signatures but except his
bald statement in this regard he has not led any
other evidence to show that signatures appearing on
Ex.PW1/2 were not that of defendant. As per this
document a sum of Rs.3,90,000/- was due and
payable by the defendant to the plaintiff.
11.
In his written statement defendant has stated
that he had given one cheque for Rs.5,000/- to the
plaintiff. However, he has stated that the said
cheque was given to the plaintiff as a loan. He has
not stated either in the written statement or in his
affidavit that he had been extending loans to the
plaintiff and had issued some more cheques.
Plaintiff has placed on record photocopies of three
th
cheques of Rs.10,000/- each dated 11 September,
th
1999 and 14 December, 1999 issued by the
defendant to the plaintiff from his bank account
maintained in State Bank of Patiala Bali Nagar,
New Delhi. Though plaintiff has marked these
cheques in his affidavit Ex.PW1/7 to Ex.PW1/9 but
these cheque being photocopies have not been
proved in accordance with law. At the same time
defendant has not put any question to the PW1 in
his cross examination that these cheques were not
issued by the defendant to the plaintiff. Rather in
his cross examination DW1 has set up a new story
by saying that he might have issued one/two more
cheques from his bank account maintained in State
Bank of Patiala, Bali Nagar, New Delhi. This
answer clearly shows that defendant has taken

RFA No.575/2007

page 8of 13

shifting stand to suit his convenience. This conduct
of the defendant makes him highly unreliable and
untrustworthy witness. This fact further strengthens
the plea taken by the plaintiff that defendant had
made payments as detailed in para five of the plaint
towards repayment of the loan. So far as story of
the defendant that he had been extending loan to the
plaintiff is concerned, same is not at all convincing
for the simple reason that even a cheque of
Rs.5,000/- issued by the defendant was returned
dishonoured on presentation with the remarks
“insufficiency of funds”. Accordingly, I am of the
view that defendant is not a truthful witness and his
testimony cannot be preferred as against the
plaintiff which has otherwise been supported by
documentary evidence. Besides this, the case of the
plaintiff is duly supported by the documents
Ex.PW1/1 and Ex.PW1/2.
15.
In the light of above discussions I pass a
decree in favour of the plaintiff and against the
defendant in the sum of Rs.3,90,000/- together with
interest @ 9% per annum with effect 14.10.2004 till
the realization of the entire decretal amount. Cost
of the suit is also awarded. Decree sheet be drawn.
File be consigned to record room.”

6.

In our view, the learned Additional District Judge has rightly come to

the finding that the respondent had extended the loan of Rs.7,73,000/- to the
appellant on 1st December, 1998. The respondent acknowledged the loan by
executing a note dated 1st December, 1998 that the appellant had paid a sum
RFA No.575/2007

page 9of 13

of Rs.3,83,000/- on different dates towards repayment of the loan, is also
corroborated from the acknowledgment dated 20th October, 2001 duly signed
by the appellant himself. As per this document a sum of Rs.3,90,000/- was
due and payable by the appellant to the respondent.

There is also no

evidence to support the plea of the appellant that the respondent was in any
requirement of loan and the cheque dated 22nd June 2003 for Rs.5,000/which was dishonoured was not issued by the appellant because the
respondent

had

requested

him

for

loan

but

to

pay

was

part of the balance payment of the loan extended to the appellant by the
respondent on 1st December, 1998. Thus, the learned Additional District
Judge had categorically come to the finding that the loan was extended by
the appellant to the respondent on 1st December, 1998 and a balance
payment of Rs.3,90,000/- was due on the appellant as per the
acknowledgment note dated 20th October, 2001 duly signed by the appellant
himself.

RFA No.575/2007

7.

It is not in dispute that the document Ex. PW1/1 acknowledging the

loan of Rs.7,73,000/- to the appellant was duly proved by the
plaintiff/respondent and bore the signatures of the appellant and it was also
witnessed by Shri Shyam Sunder who was the maternal uncle of the
appellant himself. The bare allegation of the appellant that Shri Shyam
Sunder had not signed the said document has not been proved by the
appellant producing the said Shyam Sunder in the witness box.
8.

The respondent having duly approved the execution of document of

loan of Rs.7,73,000/- it was entirely up to the appellant / defendant to show
the said loan was discharged.

The appellant has not demonstrated the

discharge of the debt acknowledged by the said note Ex.PW1. It is the
plaintiff/respondent who has very fairly stated that out of the said amount of
Rs.7,73000, a sum of Rs.3,83,000/- was paid both by cash and cheque. He
has also proved the document Ex. PW 1/2 by which after adjusting the
payment of Rs.3,83,000/- by the appellant the balance amount of

RFA No.575/2007

page 11of 13

Rs.3,90,000/- was acknowledged by the appellant.

Except his bare

statement disputing the signatures, the appellant has not led any other
evidence to show that the signature bearing Ex. PW1/2 was not his. The
learned Additional District Judge has rightly come to the conclusion that the
acknowledgment of Rs.3,90,000/- on 20th October, 2001 as per Ex. PW1/2
clearly showed that the appellant owed this sum to the respondent. The prevalidating stand of the appellant about the cheques issued by him has been
noticed by the learned Additional District Judge and we affirm the said
finding in toto. The shifting stands of the appellant have been noticed and
adversely commented upon by the trial court and in our view, rightly. The
trial court having observed the statement of the witness was the best judge to
judge the veracity of the appellant's testimony. Accordingly, we find no
merit in this appeal while affirming the findings of the trial court.
9.

Thus, in light of the categorical finding of the learned Additional

District Judge to the effect that the loan was extended to the appellant by the

RFA No.575/2007

page 12of 13

respondent and a balance payment of Rs.3,90,000/- was due on the
appellant, which findings we entirely agree with, the appeal is dismissed.
