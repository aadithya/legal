PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
FIR No.405/05 Dated : 17.9.2005
U/S 406/498A/34 IPC
P.S. Malviya Nagar

1.

Vide afore-noted bail applications, husband, father-

in-law and mother-in-law of the complainant pray that they be
granted anticipatory bail.

Vide Crl.M.C.5496-98/05,

all the

three pray that the FIR be quashed inter alia on the ground
that no part of cause of action has accrued at Delhi.
2.

Per contra, learned counsel for the complainant and

the State submit that meaningfully read, caused of action has
accrued at Delhi.
3.

Suffice would it be to note that under Section 177

of the Code of Criminal procedure,1973

an offence shall

ordinarily be enquired into and tried by a court within whose
local jurisdiction offence was committed.

In the decision

reported as 2004 (2) CC Cases (SC) 289, Y.Abraham Ajith &
Ors. Vs. Inspector of Police, Chennai, it was held that where no
part of cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of a
concerned court, proceedings before the Magistrate had to be
quashed.
4.

Subject matter of the complaint

which was

quashed
page 2 of 6

by the Supreme Court was attracting Section 498A and Section
406 IPC.
5.

As noted

herein above, instant FIR also attracts

Section 406 and Section 498A IPC.
6.

It is inter alia stated in

the complaint that the

parties were married at Ferozpur (Punjab) on 19.4.1998.

That

immediately after the marriage, dowry demand started. That
the complainant was left at Delhi in the house of her parents
with a demand that if she brought Rs.50,000/- she would be
welcome back.

Her parents gave Rs.50,000/- and she went

back to her matrimonial house. A child was born on 14.2.1999
at Ludhiana.

That three times, the

husband left the complainant at Delhi and each time her father
had to pay money, only thereafter the complainant could go
back to her matrimonial house.

She was left at her parent's house

page 3 of 6

on 17.7.2004, the complainant was turned out from the
matrimonial house in three clothes.
7.

It is urged by learned counsel for the complainant

that there is a specific

instance when dowry demand was

satisfied at Delhi, namely, at the time of the first pregnancy of
the complainant. It is urged that in the complaint it has been
categorically

mentioned

that

when

the

in-laws

of

the

complainant left her at her parent's house at Delhi, a demand
of Rs.50,000/- was made.

On said demand being satisfied,

complainant went back to her matrimonial house. It is further
submitted that though without particulars, there is a reference
to dowry demand being satisfied at Delhi.
8.

I am afraid, complainant cannot seek sustenance

from the afore-noted pleas for the reason, if she were to fall
back on the complaint pertaining to what happened in the year
1999, prima facie, the complaint would be barred
limitation.

Needless to state,

by

for an offence under Section

498A IPC, limitation is 3 years.
9.

In relation to the second allegation wherein it is

stated as under :- “three times my husband took me to Delhi
and left me with my father's house with demand of FDR of Rs.1
lac”, it would be relevant that reference to said demands has
page 4 of 6

been made before referring to demands made after a male
child was born on 23.11.2000.
10.

Perusal of the complaint shows that the complainant

has given her version in a sequential manner i.e. in priority of
time, as and when she alleges the acts of cruelty and dowry
demand.

Thus, afore-noted allegations pertain to a period

prior to 23.11.2000.
11.

I refrain from disecting the FIR for the reason, a

complaint has to be read holistically and meaningfully.
Certainly, not in a pedantic manner.
12.

A meaningful reading of the complaint shows that

the parties were married at Ferozepur. Matrimonial house of
the complainant was at Ferozepur. She parted company at
Ferozepur.

Gravement of the allegation pertained to what

happened at Ferozepur. Under the circumstances, I hold that
the cause of action would be at Ferozepur and not at Delhi.
13.
to

Petitions stand disposed of directing the local police

14.

I further direct that in the event of being arrested by

the I.O. in the afore-noted FIR, petitioners would be released
on bail by the I.O. on their furnishing personal bond in the sum
of Rs.10,000/- each with one surety each to the satisfaction of
I.O.
