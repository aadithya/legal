It also awarded interest @ 12% per annum from the

5.

Being dissatisfied with the impugned order passed by

the learned Tribunal, the appellant has filed the present
appeal.
6.

Notice

of

this

appeal

was

issued

to

all

the

respondents.
7.

Respondents 1 & 5 were served by publication but

they did not appear. Initially, respondent No.2, 3, 4 & 7
put in appearance through their counsel but later on their
counsel did not appear.

Name of respondent No.6 was

deleted from the array of parties vide order dated 3rd
September, 1997 passed by this Court.
8.

On 1st February, 2007, counsel for the appellant as

well as counsel for respondent No.4 appeared and the
matter was adjourned for 5th February, 2007.

On 5th

February, 2007 only counsel for the appellant appeared
and

none

appeared

for

the

respondents.

As

such

arguments advanced by learned counsel for the appellant
have been heard.
9.

The main contention of learned counsel for the

FAO No.52/1996

Page 4 of 8

appellant is that injured has suffered a permanent disability
in this case and the disability certificate has been proved
on record.
award

any

In spite of this, the learned Tribunal did not
compensation

on

account

of

permanent

disability, as such the appellant is entitled in all a sum of
Rs.1 lac towards compensation.
10.

It is an admitted case that left hand thumb of the

appellant was amputated. However, learned Tribunal did
not award any compensation qua the amputation of thumb.
In its judgment the Tribunal held that:-

11.

“Amputation of left hand thumb will
not cause total impairment in the
agricultural occupation of the injured.
The claimant can still
work
as
agriculturist and there should not be
so much impairment
in his
occupation.”
This finding of the learned Tribunal is perverse and

does not appeal even to common sense.
12.

Section 142 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 defines

as to what are permanent disablement. It reads as under:“Permanent disablement.- For the
purposes of this Chapter, permanent
disablement of a person shall be
deemed to have resulted from an
accident of the nature referred to in
sub-section(1) of Section 140 if such
FAO No.52/1996

Page 5 of 8

person has suffered by reason of the
accident, any injury or injuries
involving:-

13.

(a)permanent privation of the sight
of either eye or the hearing of
either ear, or privation of any
member of joint; or
(b)destruction
or
permanent
impairing of the powers of any
member or joint;or
(c)permanent disfiguration of the
head or face.”
Since, it is a case of amputation of left hand thumb,

the appellant, in these circumstances, is entitled for
compensation due to the loss of this vital part of the body.
14.

Appellant has claimed compensation amounting to

Rs.1 lac.

However,

he has not mentioned the different

heads under which he has claimed this compensation. In
case of injuries, the compensation is generally allowed for
the

amounts

spent

on

medicines,

diet,

conveyance,

compensation for pain & sufferings, loss of income, loss of
future prospects, loss of enjoyment of life and permanent
disablement, if any.
15.

The appellant as per his statement is an agriculturist

and was earning Rs.4,000/- annually by way of cultivation.
He remained in the hospital for about five days and was

FAO No.52/1996

Page 6 of 8

operated upon and spent Rs.7,000/- on medicines (though
no document in this regard has been proved on record). He
has also spent about Rs.60/- on his diet for six weeks and
had visited the hospital for 10 to 15 days and incurred daily
expenses of Rs 50/- to 60/- on this account.
16.

The learned Tribunal has taken in to consideration all

these expenses incurred by the appellant and thereafter
awarded compensation under different heads as mentioned
above amounting to Rs.45,000/-, which in my opinion is just
and reasonable, except for the permanent disablement.
17.

As far as the

permanent disability is concerned,

admittedly no compensation has been awarded on this
account and since the learned Tribunal itself has given a
finding that there is an amputation of left hand thumb, so
keeping in view the age of the appellant as he was 50 years
old at the time of accident and keeping in view the fact that
he is an agriculturist, a sum of Rs.25,000/- is awarded on
account of permanent disablement.
18.

Accordingly, in addition to compensation awarded by

the learned Tribunal, a further sum of Rs.25,000/- is
awarded to the appellant towards “permanent disability”.

Respondents are directed to deposit this additional sum of
Rs.25,000/- with the trial court within one month from
today, failing which they shall be liable to pay interest @
6% per annum till realisation. With this modification, the
present appeal stands disposed of.
