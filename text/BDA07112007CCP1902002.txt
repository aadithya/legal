This contempt petition has been filed on the allegation that

the respondent (the alleged contemnor) has violated an undertaking
given to this court on 28.01.2002. It is alleged that the respondent had
undertaken that he would not carry out any unauthorised construction in
the kiosk which was situated towards the south of Shop No.414, New

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.1 of 22

Lajpat Rai Market, Delhi which had been alloted to him by the MCD
and which would result in obstructing free ingress and egress to the
shop of the petitioner (Shop No.414, New Lajpat Rai Market) or in any
manner interfere in the free flow of air and light to the said premises.
The case of the petitioner is that the undertaking given by the respondent
has been violated inasmuch as the respondent has extended the kiosk
under his occupation and has exceeded the area of allotment. On the
other hand, the respondent's case is that there has been no violation of
the undertaking given before this court. It was firstly submitted that
there has been no construction activity in respect of the said kiosk after
28.01.2002 and, in any event, no obstruction has been caused to the free
ingress and egress to the shop of the petitioner and there has been no
interference by the respondent in the free flow of air and light to the said
premises.

2.

The undertaking in question had been given by the

respondent in suit No. 1572/1994 which had been filed by the petitioner
against the respondent. The said undertaking dated 28.01.2002 which
forms part of the settlement has been marked as Exhibit PW1/1 and the
same reads as under :

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

“Suit No.1572/94
Statement of Jaikishan Aggarwal, s/o Shri Madan Lal,
Aged 56 years, R/o 393, Kucha Bulaki Begum, Dariba
Kalan, Delhi-6, on S.A.
I am the allottee of a kiosk towards south of
Shop No. 414, South side Link Road of New Lajpat Rai
Market, Delhi. At some distance shop No.414 of
plaintiff Shri Jitender Kumar is situated. I undertake to
the Court that I will not carry out any unauthorised
construction in that kiosk allotted to me by the MCD
which may result in obstructing free ingress and egress
to the shop of the plaintiff or in any manner interfere in
the free flow of air and light to the said premises. ”
Exhibit PW1/2 is a certified copy of the order dated 28.01.2002 passed in
IA. No.4808/2001 and suit No.1572/1994 on the basis of the said
settlement and undertaking given by the respondent (defendant in the
said suit). The order passed on 28.01.2002 (Exhibit PW1/2) indicates
that the matter was listed before court on that date for arguments on the
application (IA.No.4808/2001) filed by the defendant (respondent
herein) under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. It was noted that before arguments
on the application could commence, the defendant had made a statement
which had been recorded separately and wherein the defendant
(respondent herein) had stated that he would not carry out any
unauthorised construction in the kiosk allotted to him which may
obstruct free ingress and egress to the shop of the plaintiff (petitioner
CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.3 of 22

herein). In view of the statement made by the defendant (respondent
herein), the suit was withdrawn by the plaintiff (petitioner herein) and the
same was dismissed as withdrawn by the said order dated 28.01.2002.

3.

It is also relevant to note the order dated 02.09.2005 passed

by this court in this contempt petition. A reading of the said order
indicates that the suit (CS(OS) 1572/1994) had been filed for mandatory
injunction by the petitioner (herein) against the respondent alleging that
unauthorised construction had been carried out by the respondent in the
said kiosk. It was also noted that the defendant (respondent herein) had
given the said undertaking of 28.01.2002. The petitioner had alleged in
this petition that the respondent had carried out unauthorised
construction in violation of the undertaking given to the court. It was
also noted in the order dated 02.09.2005 that the court had directed the
petitioner to file a detailed affidavit in respect of the allegations.
Consequent to such a direction, the petitioner had filed a supplementary
affidavit on 05.02.2005 wherein the plea was taken that the unauthorised
construction was carried out by the respondent on the night intervening
21-22/08/2002.

The order notes that this fact was disputed by the

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.4 of 22

learned counsel for the respondent.

In this background, the court

observed :
“Obviously this is a question of fact which can not be
decided without evidence. Petitioner shall file affidavits of
their witnesses by way of examination-in-chief within two
weeks. Respondent shall file affidavit of their witnesses
by way of examination-in-chief within two weeks
thereafter.
List before the Joint Registrar on 7th November,
2005 for recording the cross-examination of witnesses.”
Pursuant thereto, the petitioner examined three witnesses :
1. Jinender Kumar (PW1) (petitioner himself)
2. Sanjay Gupta (PW2)
3. Dinesh Kumar (Licensing Inspector, City Zone, MCD)
On the other hand, the respondent examined three witnesses :
1. Jai Kishan Aggarwal (RW1) (the respondent)
2. Prabhat Gupta (RW2)
3. Chhiteshwar Prasad (RW3).
4.

Apart from the aforesaid witnesses, the parties also produced

documentary evidence which shall be dealt with in the course of the
discussion below. However, at this stage, it must be mentioned that the
petitioner was allowed an adjournment for the production and
examination of his witness (Mr Dinesh Kumar) by an order dated
CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.5 of 22

03.10.2006 subject to payment of costs of Rs 10,000/-. It has been
pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondent that the costs of Rs
10,000/- have not been paid / deposited by the petitioner, as directed by
this court. Consequently, the evidence of Mr Dinesh Kumar cannot be
looked into. This aspect of the matter shall also be dealt with
hereinbelow.

5.

The entire controversy is with regard to the alleged violation

of the undertaking given by the respondent to this court on 28.01.2002.
Mr Arun Khosla, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner, submitted that there was a clear violation of this undertaking
given to the court and, therefore, the respondent was guilty of contempt
and was, accordingly, liable to be punished for the same. He submitted,
with reference to the examination-in-chief of the witness Dinesh Kumar
(the Licensing Inspector, City

Zone, MCD) and who apparently

produced the summoned record, that the MCD had alloted the kiosk in
question to the respondent on 20.09.1983 and that a site plan of the kiosk
had been handed over to the respondent at the time of the allotment. He
further submitted that the said witness also stated that the location of the
kiosk was changed by a letter 26.12.1983 (Exhibit PW2/B). The said

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.6 of 22

witness further stated by a letter dated 02.04.2004 permission was
granted to the respondent to extend the size of the kiosk to 7' x 5' under
the physically handicapped scheme. The letter dated 02.04.2004 was
marked as Exhibit PW2/C. Referring to the aforesaid statements made
by the witness (Dinesh Kumar), the learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that the case of the respondent that no change had been
brought about in the kiosk since 1983 stands belied because, according to
the said witness, the location of the kiosk was changed in December,
1983 by virtue of the letter dated 26.12.1983 and that by virtue of the
letter dated 02.04.2004 permission had been granted for extension of the
size of the kiosk to 7' x 5' (Exhibit PW2/C). However, this contention of
the learned counsel for the petitioner can be straightaway repelled by
noting that the purported change of the location took place in 1983 itself.
Secondly, the permission granted for extension of size of the kiosk was
in the year 2004, much after the present contempt petition had been filed.
The contempt petition had been filed on 28.12.2002. Therefore, the
question of change of location in 1983 and the permission for extension
in size granted in 2004 have no bearing on the issues at hand. The
learned counsel for the petitioner then submitted that, in view of the
statement made by the witnesses Mr Dinesh Kumar, a site plan of the

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.7 of 22

kiosk had been handed over to the respondent in 1983. It was incumbent
upon the respondent to have produced that site plan before this court to
show that the existing structure was in accordance with the said site plan
so as to obviate any dispute with regard to the allegation of unauthorised
construction.

He submitted that the fact that the site plan was not

produced by the respondent would have to be read against the
respondent.

6.

The learned counsel for the petitioner then referred to the

complaint made by the petitioner to the MCD on 03.09.2002 (Exhibit
PW1/5). He also referred to the counter affidavit of the respondent
where the respondent had stated that no extension had been made to the
kiosk till date implying thereby that there was no construction carried out
by the respondent in the kiosk after 1983. The learned counsel also
referred to a general plan given for the kiosk by the MCD. The said plan
has been annexed as Ex. PW1/3. The learned counsel then referred to the
evidence affidavit of PW1 (the petitioner himself) and made specific
references to paragraphs 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10. In paragraph 9 it was alleged
that the original dimensions of the kiosk had been restored at the time of
the suit / undertaking on 28.01.2002 but the same had been again altered

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.8 of 22

thereafter and it is for this reason that the contempt petition has been
filed.

There is an allegation contained in paragraph 10 of the said

evidence affidavit of PW1 that the construction activity was noticed at
the kiosk on 21.08.2002 and by the morning of 22.08.2002, the
construction had been completed throughout the night and the size of the
kiosk had been enlarged to 9' x 10'.

7.

The evidence of PW2 (Sanjay Gupta), a person working at the

nearby Rajdhani Guest House, was also referred to. In paragraph 4 of the
affidavit of the said Sanjay Gupta, it is stated that on 21.08.2002 at about
10.30 p.m he saw some construction activity taking place at the
respondent's kiosk. The learned counsel for the petitioner then referred
to the cross examination of the respondents' witnesses. Referring to the
cross examination of Mr Jai Kishan Aggarwal (RW1), he submitted that
the said witness introduced a new concept of carpet area. However, there
was no such concept earlier. He submitted that the witness also stated
that there was no unauthorised construction since 1983 and there was no
change in the kiosk allotted to him. He also submitted that the said
witness, in cross examination, stated that there was no alternation or
construction carried out on 21.08.2002.

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

According to the learned

Page No.9 of 22

counsel for the petitioner these statements are blatant lies in view of the
clear evidence of the witness Dinesh Kumar of the MCD. With regard to
the cross examination of Prabhat Gupta (RW2), he submitted that the
cross examination reveals that the evidence affidavit filed by the said
witness was not confirmed before an Oath Commissioner and, therefore,
the said evidence of this witness cannot be looked into at all.

He

submitted that, in any event, this witness has also repeated the stand
taken by the respondent that there was no change in the kiosk for the last
20-25 years. Referring to the cross examination of Mr Chhiteshwar
Prasad (RW3), the learned counsel submitted that the same statement is
repeated of there being no alternation or addition in the kiosk for the last
20-25 years. He then referred to Exhibit PW1/7 which is an affidavit of
an official of the Assistant Commissioner of MCD given in another
matter. He submitted that this affidavit is also a self-serving affidavit
and no-reliance can be placed on the same.

He submitted that the

statement that the measurement of the kiosk as on date and as in 1983
was the same, cannot be relied upon. Even the plan annexed to this
affidavit shows the dimensions of the kiosk as being different from the
original allotted dimensions. The learned counsel, therefore, submitted
that the evidence regarding construction given by the petitioner's

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.10 of 22

witnesses is unchallenged as there was no suggestion to the contrary
given in the course of their cross examination. He also submitted that the
evidence of the respondent that there was no change in the dimensions of
the kiosk since 1983 is falsified by the fact that the MCD permitted
changes, the evidence of the PWs is to the contrary and that the evidence
of the RWs cannot be believed. In fact he went on to say that the
witnesses produced on behalf of the respondent are guilty of perjury.

8.

In response to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel

for the petitioner,

Mr Nitin Mittal, who appears on behalf of the

respondent, submitted that nowhere in the contempt petition has it been
stated that there was any construction activity on 21.08.2002.

This

contempt petition was filed on 28.01.2002. For the first time, the story of
construction having been carried out on 21.08.2002 was introduced in
the supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioner on
05.02.2003. The learned counsel then drew the attention of the court to
three exhibits PW1/4, PW1/5 and PW1/6 which are letters purportedly
written on 23.08.2002, 03.09.2002 and 10.09.2002 and which find
reference in paragraph 7 of the contempt petition. These were purported
complaints written by the petitioner to the MCD with regard to the

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.11 of 22

alleged unauthorised construction carried out by the respondent. Mr
Mittal submitted that in none of the three letters, is it mentioned that
there was any construction carried out on 21.08.2002. The allegations
contained in these letters are general and vague. He submits that even
the dates in each of the letters have been interpolated. In Exhibit PW1/4,
the original date was typed as 12.08.2002. The same has been changed
by pen to read 23.08.2002. With regard to exhibit PW1/5, the date has
been changed from 02.09.2002 to 03.09.2002 and with regard to exhibit
PW1/6, the date has been changed from 09.09.2002 to 10.09.2002.

9.

Mr Mittal then referred to Exhibit PW1/7 which is the

affidavit of MCD official (Mr Harbhajan Singh) in another case.
Reading the affidavit, he submitted that the petitioner's conduct has been
described as malafide and that it was the petitioner who was the
encroacher and not the respondent. Referring to the undertaking (Exhibit
PW1/1), Mr Mittal submitted that the undertaking is in two parts. The
first part pertains to unauthorised construction and the second part
pertains to obstructing free ingress and egress. He submitted that for a
contempt to be made out, there must be both unauthorised construction
as well as obstruction with regard to free ingress and egress. As regards

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.12 of 22

free ingress and egress, there is no mention in the contempt petition that
the same had been obstructed by any activity on the part of the
respondent. In this context, Mr Mittal drew the attention of the court to
the cross examination of PW1 wherein he has stated that the location of
the kiosk is towards the South of his shop (shop No. 414). It has also
been stated by the said witness that there is no door towards south and
the gate of the petitioner's shop is on the West, towards Esplanade Road.
It has also come in cross examination that the distance between the
petitioner's shop and the respondent's kiosk has remained the same since
1983. Referring to these statements of the respondent (RW1), Mr Mittal
submitted that there is no question of any violation of the said
undertaking as the ingress or egress of the respondent has admittedly not
been obstructed. He also referred to the cross examination of PW1 to
submit that even the measurement which supposedly the petitioner took
was not by measuring tape but by footsteps as admitted by the said
witness. Therefore, the entire case of unauthorised construction has been
built up on the basis of mere allegations without there being any
substance. He also submitted that in his cross examination, the said PW1
has stated that on 22.08.2002 there was a holiday and the MCD office
was closed on account thereof. However, the learned counsel submitted

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.13 of 22

that subsequently under the Right to Information Act, information has
been received that on 22.08.2002 there was no holiday of the MCD
office. He submitted that although this information has been received
after the closure of evidence, judicial notice of the same could be taken.

10.

Mr Mittal then referred to the cross examination of PW2 and,

particularly, to the portion where the said witness was asked to give the
details of the construction and to which he replied that he could not give
the details.

He also mentioned that the said witness PW2 was an

interested witness. To substantiate this, Mr Mittal referred to Exhibit
DX-2 which is a conveyance deed pertaining to the petitioner in which
the said Sanjay Gupta (PW2) was a witness. Mr Mittal then referred to
the evidence affidavit of the petitioner (PW1) and, in particular,
paragraph 10 thereof wherein there is the narration of the events which
took place on 21.08.2002 and 22.08.2002.

The affidavit has clear

reference to the fact that the petitioner ran across to one Mr Pankaj
Sharma and notified him of the construction going on. However, the said
Mr Pankaj Sharma has not been produced by the petitioner.

He

submitted that the said Mr Pankaj Sharma would have been the best
witness to have supported the petitioner's case. The non-production of

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.14 of 22

Mr Pankaj Sharma and the production of PW2 (Mr Sanjay Gupta) who
was not even named in the evidence affidavit of PW1 is itself an
indicator that the petitioner's case has no legs to stand on. He submitted
that Mr Sanjay Gupta was not even present at the site. Reference was
also made by Mr Mittal to exhibits DW1/2 and DW1/3 which are
affidavits of MCD officials given in different matters involving the
petitioner and the respondent and the MCD. In Exhibit DW1/2 dated
21.04.1995, it is indicated in paragraph 3 that the kiosk of the respondent
is at the same place as it was at the time of allotment. Exhibit DW1/3
which is an affidavit of one Kumar Swamy also indicates at paragraph 4
thereof that the kiosk of the respondent is of the same size as on 1983.
This affidavit was given on 15.09.1999. The learned counsel for the
respondent, therefore, submitted that there has been no change and or any
unauthorised construction in the kiosk. He further submitted that the
permission that was granted for extension on 02.04.2004 (Exhibit
PW2/C), could not have been granted had there been

any existing

violation. He submits that this is also a factor to be considered by this
court that the MCD does not grant permission for any alternation or
extension in respect of the premises where there exists unauthorised
construction.

This in itself is a pointer to the fact that when the

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.15 of 22

permission was granted on 02.04.2004, there was no existing violation of
the terms of allotment of the kiosk.

11.

With regard to the affidavit of Mr Prabhat Gupta (RW2) not

having been confirmed before the Oath Commissioner, Mr Mittal
submitted that this is not a serious defect. The fact remains that the
affidavit was tendered in court and that the said Mr Prabhat Gupta was
cross examined in court. Therefore, his testimony can be relied upon.
Mr Prabhat Gupta has clearly and categorically stated that no
construction activity was noticed by him in the kiosk since its existence.
The said Mr Prabhat Gupta is also a natural witness and his shop is
opposite to the site in question.

He submitted that even RW3

(Chhiteshwar Prasad) is a reliable witness as he was the General
Secretary of New Lajpat Rai Market Patri Hawkers' Union and he has
also stated that there was no construction activity. It was moreover
contended on behalf of the learned counsel for the respondent that the
police was not at all called when the alleged construction activity was
noticed by the petitioner. Even the cross examination of PW1, with
regard to this aspect of the matter, demonstrates that the said witness was
evasive.

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.16 of 22

12.

In the light of these submissions, the learned counsel for the

respondent submitted that no case for contempt had been made out and
the respondent ought to be discharged.

13.

It must be remembered that the standard of proof required to

establish a change of contempt, criminal or civil, is that it has to be
proved beyond reasonable doubt. This has been held by the Supreme
court in a series of decisions including:(1) S. Abdul Karim v M.K. Prakash: (1976) 1 SCC 975
(at page 981);
(2) Mrityunjoy Das v Sayed Hasibur Rahaman: (2001) 3
SCC 739 (at page 746);
(3) Chhotu Ram v Urvashi Gulati: (2001) 7 SCC 530 (at
page 532);
(4) Anil Ratan Sankar v Hirak Ghosh: (2002) 4 SCC 21
(at page 30);
(5) Bijoy Kumar Mahanty v Jadu: (2003) 1 SCC 644 (at
page 647);
(6) Biman Bose v State of W.B.: (2004) 13 SCC 95 (at
page 97).
Having considered the arguments advanced by the counsel for the parties
and having gone through the entire evidence, I am also of the view that

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.17 of 22

the contempt is not made out. There are various reasons for arriving at
this conclusion.

14.

First of all, the contempt petition did not mention that the

construction activity was carried out on 21.08.2002 and 22.08.2002. The
contempt petition had been filed on 28.01.2002.

The allegations of

construction having been carried out on the night intervening of 21st and
22nd August, 2002 was introduced for the first time by the petitioner in
the supplementary affidavit which was filed over two years later on
(05.02.2005). This in itself creates an element of doubt with regard to
the petitioner's allegation of construction having been carried out by the
respondent on 21-22/08/2002.

15.

Secondly, the petitioner has not alleged in the contempt

petition as in what manner the respondent has obstructed the free ingress
and egress to the petitioner's shop or in what manner the respondent has
interfered with the free flow of air and light to the said premises. In fact,
there is no direct allegation contained in the contempt petition in this
regard. Even the evidence does not disclose any obstruction having been
set up by the respondent with regard to the ingress and egress. On the

CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.18 of 22

contrary, the petitioner (PW1) has admitted in cross examination that the
location of the kiosk in question is towards the south of his shop and that
no door of the shop opens towards the south. The opening of his shop is,
on the other hand, towards the west, facing Esplanade Road. He has also
admitted that the distance between his shop and the kiosk is 6' and it has
remained the same since 1983. There is no evidence to show that the
passage between the kiosk and the petitioner's shop has been encroached
upon by the petitioner in any manner. Consequently, there is nothing on
record to show that the respondent had, in any manner, obstructed the
free ingress and egress to and fro of the petitioner's shop.

16.

Thirdly, and most importantly, three documents marked as

Exhibits PW1/4, PW1/5 and PW1/6 completely belie the case sought to
be set up by the petitioner.

These are the documents which were

allegedly sent by the petitioner to the MCD by way of complaints against
the alleged unauthorised activity of the respondent.

Exhibit PW1/4

purports to be a letter which is dated 23.08.2002. The material portion of
the letter reads as under :
“Respected Sir,
It is very kindly prayed that I am in litigation
with Jaikishan Aggarwal the owner of Kiosk on the
South side wall of my shop on Foot Path size bearing
CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.19 of 22

(6'x5') as the size receipt produced in the court, and in
the above stated suit Mr Jaikishan Aggarwal has given
the undertaking in the Hon'ble High Court that he will
not raise any unauthorised construction in his kiosk. But
he has fully encroached the kiosk from (5'x6') alloted
size enlarging and constructing unauthorised in to zie
(9'x10') app and (10'x10') shed all around kiosk and
extending the kiosk towards the tree there making
narrow the street between tree and kiosk by obstructing
ingress and egress.
It is very kindly prayed accordingly to take
the necessary action against the contemner. Copy of the
Hon'ble High Court orders is self explanatory and
attached herewith.”
17.

It is important to note that the date of the letter has been

changed as mentioned above. The date as printed was `12.08.2002'. It
was altered by pen to read '23.08.2002'. There is no doubt that the said
letter was received at the MCD office on 23.08.2002. If the letter was
first typed out on 12.08.2002, as indicated by the date printed initially,
then it could not have referred to the incidents of 21-22/08/2002. On the
other hand, if the letter was written and typed out on 23.08.2002 then the
contents would have definitely disclosed that a couple of days ago i.e.,
on 21-22/08/2002 the respondent had carried out the unauthorised
construction. The alleged incidents of 21-22/08/2002 are conspicuous by
their absence.

The contents of the letter Exhibit PW1/4 have been

virtually replicated in Exhibits PW1/5 and PW1/6. In none of these
CONT CAS 190/2002 in CS(OS) 1572/1994

Page No.20 of 22

letters is there any mention of the alleged events of 21-22/08/2002. The
conclusion, therefore, is that there was no construction carried out on the
night intervening 21-22/08/2002. It must be remembered that by virtue
of the order dated 02.09.2005, passed in this petition, evidence was
required to be led to determine whether there was any construction on
21-22/08/2002. It was this question of fact which was required to be
determined by allowing the parties to lead evidence. The evidence on
record clearly establishes that there was no such incident. In fact, the
change of date on Exhibit PW1/4 completely demolishes the story set up
by the petitioner of there being unauthorised construction on 2122/08/2002.

18.

Taking an overall view of the matter, I feel that the testimony

of PW1 as also PW2 cannot be believed with regard to the allegations of
unauthorised construction. As regards the non production of the site plan
of the kiosk handed over to the respondent, no advantage can be taken by
the petitioner because it is the petitioner's case that has to be established.
The petitioner has been unable to prove beyond reasonable doubt that
there was any construction activity carried out by the respondent at the
kiosk in question on 21-22/08/2002. This is the conclusion even if the
