SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J. (Oral)
1. A complaint was lodged by respondent no.2 under
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (‘the
said Act’ for short) impleading the petitioner as the
accused. The complaint was based on the allegation that
in May, 2001, the petitioner came to respondent no.2 and
requested for a loan for the tuition fee of his son who is
studying in Mumbai.

The loan was advanced on

28.05.2001 for a period of ten months and the petitioner
issued two cheques for Rs.25,000/- each on 08.11.2002
Crl. Rev.P.163/2007

and 14.11.2002. These cheques were dishonoured on
presentation due to insufficient funds as per the memo
dated 13.03.2003 issued by the concerned bank.

The

respondent no.2 issued a legal notice dated 26.03.2003
whereafter the complaint was filed.

On the complaint

being filed, the summoning order was passed on
19.09.2003.
2. The petitioner did not dispute his signatures on the
cheques as also the factum of the amounts being filled in
his own hand writing.

However, the defence set up by

the petitioner was that the name of the person in whose
favour the cheque was drawn was left blank and these
cheques were given over to the

brother of the

respondent no.2 who had arranged for the loan of
Rs.50,000/-. It is stated that the brother of respondent
no.2 paid him only Rs.15,000/- who obtained cheques
worth Rs.

50,000/-

and the remaining balance of

Rs.35,000/- was not paid.

Thus legally enforceable right

for encashment of cheques was not available to the
respondent no.2.
3. Another defence raised by the petitioner was that a legal
notice was served on the petitioner prior to the legal
notice in question and the cheques in question were represented after the same whereafter the second legal
notice in question was issued.

It was thus pleaded that

the complaint based on the second legal notice was not
maintainable.
Crl. Rev.P.163/2007

4. The parties led their evidence.

Insofar as the earlier

legal notice was concerned, it was admitted that no such
earlier legal notice had been filed on record.

The Trial

Court, after examining the evidence, found that the
petitioner had failed to rebut the presumption by proving
his defence in terms of Section 118/138/139 of the said
Act and since the cheques were dishonoured and the
amount not paid within the period of legal notice, the
petitioner was held guilty of the offence under Section
138 of the said Act.
5. Insofar as the aspect of sentence was concerned,
acceding to the request of the learned counsel for the
petitioner for leniency, the petitioner was directed to pay
compensation amount of Rs.75,000/- to the respondent
no.2

and was granted time of one month to pay the

amount either directly to the complainant or deposit the
same in Court failing which further proceedings would be
conducted.
6. The petitioner, aggrieved by the said order, filed an
appeal, but the said appeal was dismissed by the learned
Addl.Sessions Judge vide order dated 01.03.2007.
7. The petitioner now seeks to assail both the aforesaid
orders.
8. Learned counsel for the parties have been heard and the
orders

perused.

The

witnesses

of

the

complainat/respondent no.2 have proved the cheques
and the return memo. It emerged during the course of
Crl. Rev.P.163/2007

Page 3 of 6

evidence

that

the

brother

of

the

petitioner

had

introduced him to respondent no.2. It also came to light,
as observed above, that there was no earlier alleged
notice placed on record other than the legal notice dated
26.03.2003.

The cheques in question were written

under different inks.

The cheques were not containing

any date when they were issued but as per the
complainant, the cheques were to be filled in later. The
petitioner/accused admitted that both the cheques bore
his signatures and the amounts on the cheques were
written by him but the date and the person in whose
favour they were drawn were left blank.

The cheques

were alleged to have been handed over to the brother of
the complainant who failed to make arrangement for the
payment of full amount of Rs.50,000/- and had only paid
Rs.15,000/-.

The receipt of the legal notice was

admitted. The petitioner/accused initially wanted to lead
defence evidence but subsequently did not want to lead
any defence evidence.

These aspects have been

referred to only show that the Trial Court has discussed
the evidence in question.
9. The Trial Court also took note of the fact that where a
person signs and delivers to another person a paper
stamped in accordance with the law relating to a
negotiable instrument in force in India, either wholly
blank or having written thereon an incomplete negotiable
instrument, he gives prima facie authority to the holder
Crl. Rev.P.163/2007

Page 4 of 6

thereof to make it complete, as the case may be, for any
amount specified therein not exceeding the amount
covered by the stamp in view of provisions of Section 20
of the said Act.
10.

The petitioner in the appeal court also sought to raise

the issue of an earlier notice dated 25.01.2003, but it
was found that no such notice had been placed on record
or proved.

Not only that, even the case of the petitioner

was that the said notice was for the recovery of the said
amount and thus the appeal court found that it could not
be construed as a notice under Section138 of the said
Act.
11.

Learned counsel for the petitioner once again sought

to emphasis that there was an earlier noticed dated
25.01.2003 which has been referred to in para 6 of the
subsequent notice dated 26.03.2003.

A perusal of the

notice dated 26.03.2003 no doubt shows a reference to
an earlier notice dated 25.01.2003 but whether the said
notice was actually under Section 138 of the said Act
could have been determined only if the notice was placed
on record and proved.
12.

In my considered view, the plea of the petitioner is

hardly sustainable when the alleged notice sent earlier
has not even been placed on record.

Learned counsel

for the respondent no.2 has rightly relied upon the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Bindeshwari Prasad
Singh@ B.P.Singh & Ors v. State of Bihar (Now Jharkhand)
Crl. Rev.P.163/2007

Page 5 of 6

and Anr. AIR 2002 Supreme Court 2907 to contend that
the revision court is not to re-appreciate the evidence on
record and come to a different conclusion. Of course, in
that case, the revision was directed against the acquittal
of a private party.
13.

The courts below have examined the case of the

appellant on merits. It is not in dispute that the cheques
bore the signatures of the petitioner and the amount was
also written in writing of the petitioner.

Thus, if some

part of the instructions were left blank, the provisions of
Section 20 of the said Act would squarely apply to the
facts of the present case.

The petitioner does not

dispute issuance of the cheques but only sought to make
out a case that only Rs.15,000/- was advanced in cash to
him and the balance amount of Rs.35,000/- was not
given as loan and that is the reason, the cheques were
not released on presentation. This is hardly a plausible
defence as there is no reason given why the cheques of
Rs.50,000/- were handed over when

only Rs.15,000/-

had been received. Not only that, no such defence was
set up prior to the petitioner making a statement when
he was summoned in pursuance to the proceedings in
question.
14.

I find no merit in the petition.

15.

Dismissed.
