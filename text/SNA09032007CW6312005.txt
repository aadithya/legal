enrolled in the Indian Air Force on 30.12.1983 in Clk/PA trade for an initial
term of engagement of 20 years. He was posted to No. HQ WAC (U) Air
Force w.e.f. 10.06.2002. He had undergone Clerk Accounts Conversion
course from 16.10.2000 to 22.12.2000. On 15.06.2002, the petitioner
submitted an option for unwillingness for extension of service as his initial
term of regular engagement was to expire on 31.12.2003. The said option
given by the petitioner for unwillingness for extension of service was not
accepted by the respondents and the terms of his service was extended till
31.12.2005 beyond regular engagement i.e. 31.12.2003 since the petitioner
has undergone conversion course and was required to serve for a minimum
period of five years in terms of policy of the respondents. On 04.02.2003,
the petitioner changed his option from unwillingness to willingness and
requested for grant of three years extension of service beyond regular
engagement i.e. 31.12.2003. The petitioner had changed his option from
unwillingness to willingness in compliance of AFO 11/99. His application
for change of option was forwarded to AFRO vide WAC/3212/1/P3 dated
14.02.2003 but the same was not approved by the competent authority. The
petitioner, thereafter, filed application for reconsideration of change of
option which was strongly recommended with reasoned justification report
and the same was forwarded to AFRO. The petitioner's request for extension
of service was not approved vide signal No. AFRO/RRD/822 and he was

WP(C).No.631/2005

Page No.2 of 7

accordingly informed vide RO/PF-692271/RW/Extn. dated 12.10.2004. The
petitioner in this writ petition is aggrieved by the impugned action of the
respondents denying him extension of service arbitrarily. He has alleged
discrimination stating that in identical cases the respondents have granted
extension of service to Sgt. Kashyap and Sgt. Solaskar. He has contended
that he has been wrongly denied extension of service by the respondents and
has therefore prayed for a writ of mandamus against them that they should
grant him extension of service and set aside the discharge order dated
19.10.2004 already issued to him.
In response to notice of this writ petition, the respondents have
filed their counter affidavit in which they have denied the averments
contained in the writ petition. They have also denied the allegation of
discrimination alleged against them and have explained the circumstances
under which extension of service has been granted to Sgt. Kashyap and Sgt.
Solaskar and why the same has been denied to the petitioner. The
respondents have prayed for the dismissal of this writ petition.
The sole question that arise for consideration in this writ
petition is whether the petitioner can ask for extension of service as a matter
of right or whether he was discriminated in the matter of extension of
service as alleged by him.
The initial term of the petitioner's engagement of 20 years was

WP(C).No.631/2005

Page No.3 of 7

to expire on 29.12.2003. However, on the bases of his having undergone the
Clerk Accounts Conversion course from 16.10.2000 to 22.12.2000 as per
para 4 (h) of AFO 11/99 and the course completion report, he was retained
in the service till December, 2005. On 15.06.2002, the petitioner had
submitted his unwillingness for further extension of service in accordance
with AFO 11/99. Subsequently he submitted an application for change of
option for extension of service from unwillingness to willingness in
January, 2003. His application for change of option was processed in terms
of AFO 11/99 but was not approved by AOC, AFRO since he had then not
passed the requisite promotion examination which was pre-requisite for
grant of extension of service. On passing of said examination, his case for
change of option from unwillingness to willingness was processed and
referred to Air HQ (VB) for final decision in terms of para 8 of AFO 11/99.
The same was, however, not approved by the competent authority. This
decision was communicated to his parent unit for intimation to the petitioner
on 18.03.2003. The petitioner thereafter vide his application dated
27.04.2004 requested for reconsideration of his case for extension of
service. The said application was processed and referred to Air HQ (VB) for
final decision. This time too the competent authority did not approve his
extension. This decision was communicated to his parent unit for intimation
to the petitioner on 29.06.2004.

The grant of extension of engagement to the Airmen is
governed under the provisions of Air Force Order 11/99 as amended from
time to time. The contents of para 3 of the said Air Force Order are
reproduced here-in-below:-

“ This policy has been formulated to ensure that only those
airmen who meet the minimum criteria are allowed to extend their
engagement. An airman who is consistent in his overall performance may
be granted extension of engagement, which is governed by the following
principles:Service requirements
Willingness for extension of engagement
Medical Fitness
Passing of promotion examinations
Conduct records
ACR/Assessments for last five years
Suitability for Extension
Certificate of Undertaking (COU)”
The petitioner had initially submitted his unwillingness for
further extension of service on 15.06.2002. At that time, he had requested
the authorities that he may be given a posting to home zone (Delhi area) as
he wanted to settle down in Delhi after completion of initial period of
engagement of 20 years which was to expire on 31.12.2003. His said
request was favourably considered by the authorities and he was given

WP(C).No.631/2005

Page No.5 of 7

posting from 9 BRD (Pune) to HQ WAC (U) New Delhi, home zone.
Thereafter, he made an application on 28.01.2003 for change of option from
unwillingness to willingness for extension of engagement and started
taking shifting stands. In the first instance, he availed the benefit of home
zone posting on the ground of resettlement. On second occasion while he
applied for change of option from unwillingness to willingness, he took a
stand that his family dispute has been settled amicably. While he applied for
reconsideration, he took another stand that he was undergoing heavy mental
stress due to ancestral property distribution in his native place. He
contended that his elder brother has distributed the ancestral property
contrary to his expectation as a result of which he could not get appropriate
share in the ancestral property. The respondents have stated that the service
of Sgt. Solaskar and Sgt. Kashyap was extended on genuine compassionate
grounds in comparison to the shifting stands taken by the petitioner to
misguide the authorities for his personal interest. The respondents have
further stated that the petitioner had three black ink entries before expiry of
five years of his current regular engagement and therefore he could not be
considered for grant of extension of service as his conduct sheet was found
not clean. We are of the view that extension of service could not have been
asked for by the petitioner as a matter of right. The grant of extension of
service depends on the individual merit of each case. On perusal of material

WP(C).No.631/2005

Page No.6 of 7

on record, we do not find anything wrong in the action of the respondents in
denying extension of service to the petitioner.
For the forgoing reasons, we do not find any merit in this writ
petition and the same is, therefore, dismissed leaving the parties to bear
their own costs.
