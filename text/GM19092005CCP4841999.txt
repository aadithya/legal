By this petition under Section 11 and 12 of the Contempt

of Court Act, 1971 the petitioner has alleged wilful disobedience,
violation and defiance of the orders dated 6th April, 1995 and 18th
October, 1995 passed by this court in Civil Revision No. 916/1994
effected by the respondents on 13th August, 1999 and 27th August,
1999.

The petitioner was carrying out its business under the

name and style of Gupta Sales Corporation at the Industrial
Premises A-106, Wazirpur Industrial Area and was holding an
industrial electricity connection bearing no. XI-1675. A wholly
baseless bill was raised upon the petitioner claiming an amount of
Rs.23,56,000/- in respect of the electricity consumption was
raised upon it.

Alleging non-payment of this bill claimed

arbitrarily, electricity to the premises of the petitioner was
disconnected in August, 1993. The petitioner impugned the action
of the respondent in a proceeding before the trial court. Orders
passed therein were impugned before this court by the erstwhile
Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking in Civil Revision No. 916/1994.
Vide an order dated 6th April, 1995, this court directed
the Director, EDP of Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking to grant
hearing to the Gupta Sales Corporation and pass a reasoned order.
Liberty was given to the petitioner to take all pleas available to it
before the Director, EDP. The hearing was fixed for 11th April,
1995.
The order dated 6th April, 1995 directed thus :“6.4.1995
Present : Mr. B.C. Pandey, for the petitioner.
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 2 of 32

Mr. Jagdeep Kishore for the
respondent.
C.R. 916/94 & C.Ms. 3776-3777/94
I have heard the learned counsel
for the parties. In the peculiar facts and
circumstances of this case, I direct the
Director, E.D.P. To grant hearing to the
respondent Gupta Sales Corporation and pass
a reasoned order. The respondent would be
at liberty to take all pleas available to the
petitioner on 11th April, 1995 at 3.00 p.m. at
Sharam Shakti Bhawan, New Delhi.
List this matter for further
directions on 18th April, 1995.
Copy of the order be given dasti to
the learned counsel for the parties.
Sd/Dalveer Bhandri, Judge.”
3.

Pursuant to the order dated 6th April, 1995 and hearing

given thereupon, the Director EDP passed an order dated 24th
April, 1995 noticing that in the inspection conducted dated 4th
November, 1986 and 17th August, 1987, no misuse was found. He
directed modification of the bill raised upon the petitioner and
correction of the penalties imposed on 2nd June. The Director
(EDP) held that misuse could have been levelled only for the
period November, 1986 to August, 1987. Based on the order dated
1st September, 1995 passed

by the Director EDP, the court

recorded the agreement between the parties that the electricity

Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 3 of 32

undertaking would prepare a revised bill and that the petitioner
herein would pay the amount thereof and complete all formalities
whereupon the electricity would be restored within three days. In
case of dispute to the correctness of the bill, liberty was given to
the petitioner to deposit the amount under protest vide orders
dated 18th October, 1995 disposing of CR No. 916/1994.
4.

It is necessary to examine the order dated 18th October,

1995 closely and consequently the same is reproduced in extenso :“ 18.10.95
Present: Mr. B.C. Pandey, for the petitioner.
Mr. Jagdeep Kishore with Ms. Rekha
Gupta for the respondent
CR No. 916 & CM Nos. 3376 & 3777 of 94
It is agreed upon in between the
parties that the petitioner would prepare a
revised bill on the basis of the order passed by
the Director (EDP) dated September 1, 1995
within a week from today. On receipt of the
same the respondents would pay the amount
of the bill and complete the formalities. The
respondent would inform the petitioner about
the formalities required to be completed
within a week. On deposit of the amount of
the bill and on completion of the formalities
the electric connection which is lying disconnected would be restored within three
days. In case the respondents dispute the
correctness of the bill, in that eventuality they
will be free to deposit the amount under
protest.
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 4 of 32

The revision petition is disposed of
accordingly. Dasti.
Sd/Mohd. Shamim, Judge”
The petitioner has pointed out that the respondent failed
to raise the revised bill within a week as directed. A bill was served
upon the petitioner on 23rd November, 1995 with a covering letter
dated 21st November, 1995 for the sum of Rs.1,75,743.74
5.

The respondent failed to restore the electricity within

the period of three days of payment of the bill. On the contrary,
according to the petitioner, vide a letter dated 30th November,
1995,

wholly

unnecessary

and

unwarranted

commercial

formalities were required to be completed. The petitioner was at
pains to point out that the case related to re-connection of an
existing connection and as such there was no requirement of a
fresh agreement etc as was being demanded.
6.

Without restoring the electricity, the respondents

illegally raised an electricity bill for the month of November, 1995
in the sum of Rs.5,657/- followed by a letter dated 8th December,
1995 threatening disconnection for non-payment of the bill for
November, 1995 by 18th December, 1995.
7.

The petitioner is stated to have complied with the wholly

Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 5 of 32

unreasonable requirements vide its letter dated 18th December,
1995 and furnished the entire required information and
documents to the respondent, and protested against the mode of
functioning of the respondents.
8.

According to the petitioner, the respondents disregarded

all requests of the petitioner in writing and otherwise and paid no
heed to the orders passed by this court. They refused to restore
the electricity despite the specific directions issued on 18th
October, 1995. It has been pointed out that the electricity had
been disconnected in August, 1993 based on the totally illegal
demand of Rs.23,56,538.81 which was corrected under orders of
this court by the respondent to Rs.1,75,743.74. Despite payment
and submission of all documents by the petitioner, the
respondents were not restoring the electricity within the three
days period given to them under orders of this court.
9.

In these circumstances, the petitioner filed CCP No.

411/1996 bringing these facts before this Hon'ble Court and sought
action against the respondents who were guilty of the contempt of
the orders dated 6th April, 1995 and 18th October, 1995. Upon
consideration of the matters, dasti notice was directed to issue on
the 19th January, 1996 returnable for 29th January, 1996. One Sh.
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 6 of 32

H.C. Verma, Assistant Engineer of the Electricity Undertaking put
in appearance on the 29th January, 1996 and made a statement in
the following terms :“29.1.96
Present: Mr. J. Kishore for the Petitioner
Mr. Jayant Nath for the Respondent
CCP 11/96
Mr. H.C. Verma, Assistant Engineer,
DESU is present in the Court. On instructions
from him, Counsel for DESU states that the
electric supply will be restored in the course of the
day. The Petitioner is directed to comply with the
requirements of submitting proper test report
within three days. The direction to file proper test
report is being given in view of the submissions
made at the bar that the earlier test report was
faulty inasmuch as the connected load was to be
shown as 100 KW which is equal to roughly 130
H.P. Whereas the sanctioned load was 50 H.P.
Renotify this case on 2nd February, 1996
for compliance.
J.K. MEHRA, J.”
10.

The petitioner's electricity was restored on 29th January,

1996.
11.

I find that the statement made on behalf of the

respondents was found to be false by this court and was so noted
in the proceedings held on 2nd February, 1996 which were to the
following effect :Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 7 of 32

“ 2.2.96
Present : Mr. Jagdip Kishore for the petitioner
Mr. B.C. Pandey for the respondents.
CCP 11/96
I have heard the parties. The electric
connection has since been restored. Mr. Jagdip
Kishore has produced documentary evidence to
show that the sanctioned electric load was not 50
HP but the sanctioned load was 129.61 HP. This
clearly shows that the story for incorrect test
report was only manipulation on the part of the
Department for which certainly some action is
called for. Such conduct on the part of the
Department is not acceptable at all.
The
petitioner has suffered loss on account of nonsupply of electricity resulting in denial of
opportunity to earn. The allegation of incorrect
test report cannot be accepted in the face of such
facts as have come to light today. The allegation
of the Department that the petitioner had been
sanctioned 50 HP is clearly belied by their own
documents. The General Manager of DESU is
directed to look into this matter and fix the
responsibility for such lapse and initiate
appropriate action against the erring officer and
report to this Court within four weeks of the
action that is initiated. On this occasion I am at
this stage not inclined to impose any punishment
though one is called for in view of the contemners
having purged themselves of the contempt. The
Petition is disposed of with further orders that it
should be listed on 6th March, 1996 for the
Department to file affidavit of compliance in
terms of this order.
A copy of this order be given Dasti.
Sd/J.K. Mehra, Judge.”

12.

It becomes necessary to notice the action taken by the

respondents and the orders of this court in the contempt petition
in view of the fact that action was apparently commenced by the
electricity undertaking against its officers. On 3rd October, 1996,
this court recorded the following order in CCP No. 11/1996 :“03.10.1996
Present : Ms. Jaya Kumari for counsel for
petitioner
Mr. Jayant Nath for Respondent
CCP 11/1996
Counsel for the Respondent states that
the disciplinary proceedings have already been
initiated and consequent upon the decision of the
proceedings, action has been taken against Mr.
Ranbir Singh, the then Junior clerk and Mr. H.C.
Verma, Asstt. Engineer.
Copy of the order
initiating action has also been placed on record.
I have heard the parties. In view of the
fact that the guilty officers have already been
proceeded against and punishment imposed, I am
not inclined to proceed any further with this
contempt petition. The same stand disposed of in
terms of my earlier order.
J.K.Mehra, J.”
13.

The trauma of the petitioner did not end even here

though he abided by all the demands made on him thereafter and
made every payment.
On 13th August, 1999 the petitioner was sent a letter by
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 9 of 32

Sh. Ajit Singh(respondent no. 2) herein demanding an amount of
Rs.26,48,917.33 being the amount outstanding against his
connection up to March, 1999. The petitioner was directed to
make payment of this amount by 26th August, 1999 failing which, it
was threatened that his electricity supply would be disconnected
against non-payment.
14.

By this demand the respondent no. 2 was demanding the

same amount which was the subject matter of CR No. 916/1994
which was in apparent disregard and violation of the orders dated
6th April, 1995 and 18th October, 1995 passed in Civil Writ
916/1994 and the orders passed by the Director EDP on 1st
November, 1995.
15.

The petitioner was at pains to explain the fact situation

to the respondents vide the letter dated 18th August, 1999 which
was to the following effect :“To,
Shri Ajit Singh,
The Commercial Officer BS (II),
Delhi Vidyut Board,
Shakti Sadan,
N. Delhi.
Ref:

Your letter No. BSR/II/99-2000/432

Dear Sir,
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 10 of 32

This has reference to the meeting
undersigned demanding a sum of Rs.26,48,97033 which as per you is outstanding upto March
1999. Actually there is no amount pending to be
paid by us. As informed to you when the
undersigned met you in this connection we have
already paid the revised bill for Rs.1,75,743-74p.
for the period May 88 to Aug.93 on SIP basis and
Misuse charges and LIP for the period Nov.86 to
Aug.87 as per the speaking orders passed by the
Director EDP vide Civil Revision 916/94 and
nothing remains unpaid. Copy of revised bill and
receipt of payment is enclosed.
We hope you will make necessary
correction in your record and delete the frivolous
demand outstanding against our connection.
Thanking you,
Yours faithfully,
For Gupta Sales
Corporation
Sd/Partner.”
16.

Despite these facts, the respondent nos. 3 and 4 are

stated to have disconnected the electricity of the petitioner on 27th
August, 1999 on instructions given by the respondent no. 2 for
non-payment of the amount which could not have been demanded
in view of the orders in CR No. 916/1994.
17.

The petitioner is contended to have made several visits

to sort out the issues with the respondent no. 2 whose attitude was
found to be arrogant, uncooperative and authoritative.

Senior

officials of the electricity undertaking were of also no help in the

Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 11 of 32

matter. The petitioner contends that Sh. S.D. Kalia, respondent
no. 3 herein and Sh. R.K. Dhimal, respondent no. 4 herein are the
junior engineers and inspector of the area where the industrial
unit of the petitioner is located. It is submitted that none of these
officials

paid any heed to the matter despite the petitioner

meeting them personally on more than five occasions and handing
over copies of the orders passed by this court in CCP No. 11/1996.
The petitioner also handed over photocopies of the up to date bills
which were duly paid up.

In the presence of several persons

present, respondent no. 3 is alleged to have shouted at the
petitioner and directed him to get orders of the court.
18.

The hapless petitioner thereafter sent a detailed legal

notice dated 29th September, 1999 calling upon the respondents to
restore the electricity to his premises. Apart from the Delhi Vidyut
Board, the petitioner caused services of this legal notice to be
effected on seven officers of the electricity company including the
respondent nos. 2, 3 and 4 herein. The material contents of this
notice reads as under :“ 3.
That the Industrial electricity/power
connection of my aforesaid client M/S GUPTA
SALES CORP. was disconnected on alleged
charges of Rs.61,101/36, which was challenged by
my client by filing a civil suit, which was restored
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 12 of 32

on the orders of the Court dated 20.1.89, and
thereafter on 30.8.1993 on account of alleged
charges of Rs.26,48,970/33.These charges inter
alia were also held to be wholly unjustified by the
Ld. EDP vide order Ref. No.: DIR (EDP) VI (003)
655 dated 1.9.1995. That the electricity of my
aforesaid client was restored only on 29.1.1996,
whereby my client remained out of production for
over two years and five months without any fault
and therefore suffered losses to the tune of over
Rs.7,42,000/- during the above noted period of
about two years and five months. That beside
disconnecting the Industrial Power, the Industrial
light was also disconnected during the above
noticed period, against which there was no
demand of any nature.
4.
That after the electricity was restored
on 29.1.96, as aforesaid, my client resumed the
production but could not compete in the market
due to remaining out of the market for over two
years and five months as aforesaid. That my
client is in the line of manufacturing since 1965.
That due to this factor my client suffered losses of
Rs.9,75,000/- on account of the deliberate,
unauthorised and illegal actions of the noticees 2
to 5.
6.
That even earlier the electricity was
restored on 29.1.96, as aforesaid after my client
filed a suit being No. 70/89, thereafter an appeal
being No. 14/94, before the A.D.J. And a petition
for contempt being CCP No. 11/96, in the High
Court, besides a Revision was filed by the Noticee
No. 1, before the High Court being No. 916/94,
which was also required to be defended bu my
client.
7.
That the findings of the Ld. EDP
communicated vide letter Dt. 1.9.95, and the
orders dated 6.4.95, 18.10.95, passed by the High
Court in C.R. No. 916/94 and orders dated 2.2.96,
2.7.96 and 3.10.96 passed by the High Court in
Contempt Petition No. 11/96 clearly establishes
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 13 of 32

19.

that the electricity was disconnected by the
noticees No. 2 to 8, deliberately, unauthorisedly
and illegally and also in excess of their powers and
for ulterior purposes, considerations and motives
to put my client to undue hardship and monitory
losses and undue gain for themselves.”
Receipt of this legal notice is admitted on behalf of the

respondents. Yet, the respondents refused to still act reasonably.
They paid no heed to the court proceedings set out therein or the
facts narrated by the petitioner. In complete defiance of the rights
of the petitioner

and the orders dated 18th of October, 1995

directing restoration of the electricity upon payment of the revised
bill and completion of the formalities, the respondents issued yet
another notice dated 28th October , 1999 which was to the
following effect :“No. 85/DO/1805 Date 28/10/99

20.

In response to this communication, the petitioner again

met the respondent no. 2 and tried to make him see reason. The
petitioner contends that the respondent no. 2 completely refused
to see reason and misbehaved with the petitioner in a manner
which was most becoming of an officer dealing with the public at
large. It is contended that as a result of the disconnection of the
electricity, the petitioner has suffered grave financial loss. Being

Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 15 of 32

left with no option, the petitioner filed the present petition on 30 th
November, 1999 seeking initiation of proceedings under the
Contempt of Court Act and for a direction imposing financial
penalty on the contemnors.
21.

Notice was issued in this petition on 2nd December, 1999

when time was sought on behalf of the respondents to file a reply.
22.

I find that only the respondent no.2 has opted to file an

affidavit in response to the notice issued by this court.

The

explanation for the aforestated conduct rendered in the affidavit is
to the following effect :“4.
That it is submitted that a note was
put up before the deponent i.e. the
Respondent No.2, by the junior staff, that the
dues of Rs.26,48,970.33 is outstanding
against the petitioner. Consequently, a notice
dated 13.8.99 was sent to the petitioner giving
an opportunity to explain why the amount has
not been paid. The petitioner was further
advised to reconcile the dues with the
respondents.”
5.
That in response to the notice, the
petitioner sent a letter dated 18.8.99.
However, in the said letter dated 18.8.99 the
petitioner did not mention anything
regarding the court case or any order passed
by this Hon'ble Court or any to her court with
regard to any direction or decision on the said
pending amount.
xxx The request of Respondents to
send a person to reconcile the accounts was
also ignored.
No representative of the
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 16 of 32

Petitioner came to explain the correct facts.
It is pertinent to mention here that
the case/order it was an old case of 1996,
when the deponent was not holding this post
and consequently he was not aware of any
such proceeding with the petitioner in this
Hon'ble Court or any other court. The record
that was placed before him also did not show
that the said demand is in any way connected
with an order of this Hon'ble Court.
6.
That since the petitioner in its letter
dated 18.8.99 did not mention anything about
any such order or direction passed by this
Hon'ble Court, the deponent bonafide,
directed the respondents no. 3 and 4 to
disconnect
supply
of
electricity.
Consequently
Respondents
No.
3-4
disconnected supply of electricity of the
petitioner on 27.8.99.
7.
That the deponent learnt about his
mistake on or around 29.12.1999 when the
deponent was served a copy of the notice of
Contempt of this Hon'ble Court. At that time
the deponent directed the staff to place the
full record before him. On carefully going
through the records he learnt about the
orders passed by this Hon'ble Court on 6.4.95
and 18.10.95.
Immediately thereafter,
seeking legal advise, the deponent directed
restoration of electricity of supply.
The
supply hence, was restored at the premises of
the petitioner on 29.12.99.
8.
That it is the respectful submission
of the deponent that disconnection was
effected on account of bonafide mistake. The
mistake took place on account of fact that full
records, including the Order of this Hon'ble
Court was not shown to the deponent by the
staff concerned. The records as mentioned in
the office of deponent continued to show
large outstanding of Rs.26,48,970.33 against
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 17 of 32

the petitioner. Even in response to show
cause notice, the petitioner did not give the
full facts. It was in these circumstances that
the deponent directed disconnection of the
supply. The deponent acted bonafide in the
interest of DVB. The deponent apologises for
this bonafide mistake before this Hon'ble
Court.
9.
It is the further respectfully
submitted that otherwise, the order of the
Hon'ble Court dated 18.10.95 were duly
implemented by revising the bill as the
speaking order of Director, EDP. On receipt
of Rs.1,73,462.33, the supply of petitioner was
restored on 29.1.96. Hence, the orders of this
Hon'ble Court dated 6.4.95 and 18.10.95 were
duly complied with. It cannot be said that
there was any willful disobedience of the
order of this Hon'ble Court.
The
disconnection of electricity supply of the
premises of petitioner took place on 27.8.99
on account of erroneous records maintained.
The same cannot be said any willful
disobedience of the order of this Hon'ble
Court dated 6.4.95 and 18.10.95.
10.
That the deponent would like to
submit that the deponent acted bonafide. The
deponent has already issued memo to Sh.
S.N. Gupta, A.E., for his negligence.”
23.

The petitioner has disputed the averments made by the

respondent no. 2 in its rejoinder. Perusal of the affidavit of the
respondent no. 2 shows the utter callousness with which he has
conducted himself. The letter of the petitioner dated 18th August,
1999 clearly referred to a meeting which was held by the
petitioner. The petitioner has clearly indicated that he has paid
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 18 of 32

the revised bill for the sum of Rs.1,75,743.74 and the periods for
which the bill had been raised. This order adverts to the speaking
orders passed by the Director EDP pursuant to the orders passed
in Civil Revision 916/1994 and stated that nothing further
remained to be paid. The petitioner had enclosed the revised bill
with this letter alongwith the receipt of the payment.
24.

None of these statements made in the letter dated 18th

August, 1999 are disputed by the respondents.
25.

Receipt of this letter is clearly admitted by the

respondent no. 2 in his affidavit.
I also find that the supplementary bill issued by the
respondents enclosed with this letter contains the following
noting:“Supp. Bill for the period Nov. 86 to Aug. 87
on Lip H Tariff as per and pending order
passed by DIR(EDP) and May, 88 to Sept. 93
on LIP tariff duly confirmed by Hon'ble High
Court of Delhi.”
26.

The respondent no. 2 therefore had full knowledge and

was put to notice about the orders passed by this court.

The

supplementary bill of 1995 referred to both the orders of the
Director (EDP) as well as the orders of this court.
27.

The respondent no. 2 was acting in discharge of the

Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 19 of 32

powers conferred on him under the provisions of the electricity
enactments. It cannot be disputed that electricity is an essential
amenity and more so to an industrial establishment which would
be unable to carry on its activity without electricity.

The

justification rendered in the affidavit filed before this court is to
the effect that the respondent no. 2 was not holding the post of
commercial officer(bulk supply) in 1996 and consequently was not
aware of the court proceedings of such year.
28.

Even assuming that the respondent no. 2 was prevented

by any just or sufficient cause from getting further details from the
records of DESU/DVB, I find that the petitioner had addressed a
detailed legal notice on the 24th September, 1999 which set out the
court orders and proceedings in detail and notified the
respondents about the action taken and the orders passed by the
Director EDP as well as the revision of the bill and the payment
thereof by the petitioner pursuant to the court orders. Such notice
was admittedly served upon respondent nos. 2 to 4 who are
employees of the erstwhile Delhi Electricity Undertaking and the
Delhi Vidyut Board. If the respondent nos. 2 to 4 were nursing
doubts or did not have knowledge of the court orders, they would
have immediately verified the facts stated in this notice and taken
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 20 of 32

immediate remedial measures.
29.

The respondent no. 2 in his letter dated 13th August,

1999 has stated that the demand is based on the bulk supply
records. Such records would contain the supplementary revised
bill and its payment.
30.

Yet no action at all was taken by the respondents even

on receipt of this legal notice.
31.

Despite the orders passed against the officials of the

erstwhile Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking (taken over by the
Delhi Vidyut Board), the respondents have shown their utter
defiance of the orders passed by this court apart from the callous
disregard of their statutory duties and public law obligations to
ensure that the rights of the consumers are not prejudiced or
hindered in any manner. They have not failed to pay heed to the
specific orders by this court directing restoration of electricity
upon revision of the same demand which was the basis of the
earlier disconnection. Every tactic available in the book has been
adopted first to avoid restoration and then to repeat the
disconnection.

In the past, after the petitioner fulfilled every

reasonable and unreasonable formality imposed upon him, the
bogey of incorrect test reports was raised.
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 21 of 32

32.

The officials were not satisfied with the harassment

caused to the petitioner from August, 1993 till 1996 and did not
even let a couple of years pass before his electricity was again
disconnected on 22nd August, 1999. In the facts and circumstances
of this case, I am unable to accept the submissions that the
respondent nos. 2 to 4 had overlooked or were not aware of the
court orders when the demand dated 13th August, 1999 was raised.
I find no reason as to why no steps were taken to examine the
matter closely even upon receipt of the reply dated 18th August,
1999 from the petitioner before effecting the disconnection on 27th
August, 1999.
33.

The letter dated 13th August, 1999 does not disclose any

basis for raising the demand of Rs.26,48,917.33. According to the
respondent no. 2 the demand was allegedly raised by him “as per
bulk supply records”.

The demand raised in this letter was of a

huge amount and the respondent no. 2 was required to be satisfied
that such an amount was actually due and payable by a consumer.
The respondent no. 2 had before him the monthly consumption of
the petitioner and was required to verify the basis on which he was
raising such demand.

He was also required to disclose every

details of this amount.

In case there was any allegation of misuse

Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 22 of 32

or load violation, the respondent no. 2 was mandated by statute to
issue an appropriate notice and to give an opportunity to the
consumer to satisfy it that the allegations were not correct before
taking the extreme measure of disconnection.

Repeated

pronouncements of the Apex Court and by this court to this effect
bind the respondents officials. Apart from the duty imposed by
statute, there is an obligation imposed in public law upon officials
discharging public duties.
34.

I find that this court had considered the matter in Civil

Revision 916/1994 and CCP No. 11/1996.

The electricity was

restored by order dated 18th October, 1995 pursuant to payment of
such revised demands.

It was therefore not open to the

respondent nos. 2 to 4 to impose a demand which stood revised
and disconnect the electricity for non-payment thereof.
35.

I find that on 3rd October, 1996, in CCP 11/1996 as the

guilty officers had been proceeded against and punishment
imposed in disciplinary action, for this reason further orders were
not passed despite the contumacious conduct of the officers of the
erstwhile Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking.
36.

I find that there is also no denial to the fact that the

petitioner was made to run from piller to post and that he was
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 23 of 32

treated with utmost disrespect by the respondents. The petitioner
in his affidavit has contended that the respondents 2 to 4
misbehaved with him and despite his handing over court orders
and details of payment of bill, refused to correct their action.
37.

In these circumstances, the petitioner was without

electricity from August, 1993 till the electricity was restored on
December, 1995. Despite the petitioner's compliance with the
demand which was raised pursuant to the order dated 18th
October, 1995, the electricity to the premises was thereafter again
disconnected on 27th August, 1999 .
38.

On 2nd February, 1996, this court had noticed the

manipulations on the part of electricity authorities in the contempt
proceedings earlier necessitated for the failure of the respondents
to abide by the court orders and the court had not imposed
punishment even though it was called for, only in view of the
contemnors then having purged themselves of the contempt.
39.

It has been urged on behalf of the petitioner that the

respondents so acted to wreak a vengeance against the petitioner
in view of the earlier proceedings.

Despite being repeatedly

informed that electricity stood restored pursuant to the court
orders, that the demand was revised and paid by the petitioner
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 24 of 32

pursuant to the court order, the respondent nos. 2 to 4 showed no
intention to correct their actions.

The demand which stood

revised in proceedings before this court was being enforced by the
respondent nos. 2 to 4. The court had directed restoration of the
electricity connection upon payment of such amount. The stance
taken before this court itself shows their belligerence which clearly
indicates the arrogant belief of the respondent nos. 2 to 4 that
they are a law unto themselves and are not required to abide by
the proceedings and orders of the court. Admittedly the orders of
the court were available in the same records of the respondents,
where from they have been confirmed by respondent no. 2. I
therefore find force in the submission of the petitioner that the
respondent nos. 2 to 4 so acted to wreak vengeance against it.
40.

The court has the duty of protecting the interst of the

public in the due administration of justice and, so, it is entrusted
with the power to commit for contempt of court to protect and to
vindicate the right of the public that the administration of justice
shall not be prevented, prejudiced, obstructed or interefered with.
It is a mode of vindicating the majesty of law, in its active
manifestation against obstruction and outrage (Re: Offutt vs U.S. ,
1954 (348) US 11).
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 25 of 32

41.

The respondent no. 2 in his counter affidavit has

contended that he had committed a bona fide mistake. However, I
am unable to agree. The arrogance of the respondents is writ large
on the face of the record as is manifest from the averments made
by him. The respondent nos. 3 and 4 have considered it wholly
unnecessary to even file a reply in answer to the notice to show
cause in the present proceedings.
42.

The action of the respondents in raising the demand

dated 13th August, 1999 and disconnection of the electricity on 27th
August,

1999 was wilful and contumacious. The respondents

deliberately did not even react, let alone correct, their conduct,
despite receipt of the legal notice dated 24th September, 1999
which set out in detail the various orders of the court and the
compliance of the demand revised in the earlier proceedings by the
petitioners. Even the filing of the present contempt petition and
receipt of the notice in court on 2nd December, 1999 did not
persuade the respondent nos. 2 to 4 to correct themselves.
Electricity was restored only on 29th December, 1999.
43.

I am unable to hold that the disconnection of electricity

in the aforestated facts and circumstances was on account of a
bona fide mistake of respondent no. 2.
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 26 of 32

The present case

exemplifies the apathy of the respondents to the plight of a
consumer and the vengeance to which he is subjected in case he
takes recourse to seeking redressal in legal remedies. Such spirit
stares in the face from the manner in which they have acted in
respect of the petitioner.
44.

In

AIR

1993

SCC

1633

entitled

B.M.

Bhattacharjee(Manger General) vs Russel State Corporation, it
was held by the Apex Court that all officers of the Government
must be presumed to know that under the constitutional scheme
obtaining in this country, that orders of the court have to be
obeyed implicitly and that the orders of the Apex Court cannot, for
that matter can - should not be trifled with.
45.

The respondent no. 2 has abjured knowledge of the

orders and denied malice and pleaded good faith. He has set up a
plea of justification for his conduct which I have disbelieved.
Contempt

of

Court

is

not

confined

to

pending

cases.

Administration of justice is a continuing process. An act which
would have effect of punishing a person for having taken recourse
to litigation would be punishable as Contempt of Court. Actions
which show lack of respect for proceedings in court which may
have culminated would also be contumacious in this behalf. In
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 27 of 32

this behalf reference may be appropriately made to the law laid
down in 1963 I QB 696 entitled Attorney General vs Butternorth &
Ors.
In (1980) 3 SCC 311 Advocate General, State of Bihar vs
Madhya Pradesh Khair Industrial & Anr, the court held that it may
be necessary to punish as a contempt, a course of conduct which
abuses and makes a mockery of the judicial process and which
thus extends its pernicious influence beyond the parties to the
action and effects the interests of public in the administration of
justice. It was held that the court has the power to commit for
contempt of court in order to break and to vindicate the confidence
of the public that the administration of justice shall not be
prevented, prejudiced, obstructed or interfered with any default.
46.

The respondent no. 2 has rendered a perfunctory and

insincere apology in the reply filed by him. The same is not an act
of compunction or contrition on the part of the maker.

The

apology has not been made in a good faith and is shorn of
penitence.

I have no hesitation in rejecting such apology

contained in the counter affidavit filed by respondent no.2
Respondent nos. 3 and 4 have not rendered any such apology on
record. In impertinent defiance of the directions, the respondent
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 28 of 32

nos. 2 to 4 effected disconnection of the electricity connection of
the petitioner for non-payment of the earlier demand. Apology is
not a weapon of defence to purge the guilty of their offence, nor is
it intended to operate as a universal panacea.

It can only be

accespted if it evidences real contriteness. It is self evidence that
there cannot be both justification and an apology at the same time.
The two are mutually incompatible. In this behalf I draw strength
from the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in M.Y. Shareef's
case reported at AIR 1955 SC 19 (24).
47.

At the same time, I have found that the justification for

the conduct rendered by respondent no. 2 is not acceptable.
48.

Punishment is awarded on a contemnor to uphold the

majesty of law. The jurisdiction is exercised not because the court
is not protecting the dignity of an individual judge but to protest
the administration of justice from being maligned. In AIR 1968
SCC 1895 entitled Supreme Court Bar Association vs Union of
India, the Apex Court noticed that in contempt jurisdiction, the
court is not adjudicating upon any claim between litigating parties
and that this jurisdiction is exercised to uphold the dignity of
courts.

It was observed that in the general interest of the

community, it is imperative that the authority of courts should not
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 29 of 32

be imperilled and there should be no unjustifiable interference in
the administration of justice. It is exercised in a summary manner
in aid of the administration of justice the majesty of law and the
dignity of the courts. No such act can be permitted which may the
tendency to shake the public confidence, the fairness and the
impartiality of the administration of justice.
Power to punish for contempt therefore must be
exercised cautiously, wisely and with circumspection. (AIR 1965
SCC 745).

In AIR 1968 Kerala 301 entitled K.P. Noordin

Mohammad vs A.K. Gupalan, the court laid down the following
principles for consideration for punishment.
49.

From a conspectus of the judicial pronouncements on

the subject, the following principles can be called out :
(i)
used.

The power to punish for contempt is to be sparingly
It is to be used only from a sense of duty under the

pressure of public interest, not so much to punish the particular
offender as to deter like conduct in the future by possible
contemners.
(ii)

Courts are generally reluctant to punish unless it be

shown that it is probable that the publication or action would

Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 30 of 32

substantially interfere with the due administration of justice.
(iii)

Whether the contemner had knowledge of the pendency

or imminence of the cause might also be a factor which the court
has to consider in deciding whether it should exercise its
jurisdiction to punish for contempt. But whether such knowledge
is really an ingredient of the offence or only a consideration to be
taken into account in deciding whether the offender should be
punished or not that knowledge is more often than not, a matter
for inference.

And where the circumstances are such that a

reasonable man would infer therefrom that a judicial proceeding
must be pending or is imminent such knowledge will be imputed.
(iv)

In case of criminal contempts courts which by tryanny

always look for mens rea in criminal acts and feel unhappy over
absolute liability will naturally be low to punish where there is no
means rea ever if it be that strictly speaking, no mens rea is
required to constitute the offence.”
50.

I have held that the respondent is guilty of contempt and

have found myself unable to accept the apology rendered by the
respondent no. 2. The actions of the respondent nos. 2 to 4 show
apparent disrespect for the orders of the court and were such
which would shake public confidence in the judicial process.
Cont. Cas(C) No. 484/1999

page 31 of 32

However the disconnection was effected in 1999 and
much time has passed thereafter while the matter has remained
pending in court.
For this reason the extreme punishment is not being
granted.
51.

In these circumstances, in order to meet the ends of

justice, I hereby impose a fine of only Rs.1,000/- upon the
respondent no. 2 and a fine of Rs.500/- each on respondent nos. 3
and 4. Such fine shall be deposited by the respondent nos. 2 to 4
within a period of six weeks in this court. In the event of default of
payment of the fine, the respondents shall undergo simple
imprisonment of one week.
