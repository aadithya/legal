ORDER
10.04.2008
1. The petitioner M/s J K Choudhry Charitable and Educational Trust has
filed the present writ petition impugning order dated 23.3.2005 passed
by the Joint Assessor and Collector fixing rateable value of property
no.C-17, Community Centre, Safdarjung Area, New Delhi for the period
w.e.f. 1.4.1992, as per details give as under :
1) Rs.3.08,100/- p.a. w.e.f. 1.4.1992
2) Rs.4,51,050/- p.a. w.e.f. 1.9.1992
3) Rs.4,25,990/- p.a. w.e.f. 1.4.1994
4) Rs.7,97,304/- p.a. w.e.f. 21.9.2000
5) Rs.9,82,254/- p.a. w.e.f. 1.4.2002
6) Rs.84,890/- p.a. w.e.f. 7.7.2003

7) Rs.12,50,744/- p.a. w.e.f. 15.2.2004
2. This is the second round of litigation. The petitioner had earlier filed writ
petition no.1634/1998 impugning ex-parte assessment order dated
22.3.1996 fixing rateable value of property at Rs.8,55,970/- w.e.f.
1.4.1992. The said writ petition was allowed vide order dated 6th
December, 2000 with the matter being remanded back to the Assistant
Collector, Special Assessment Unit, Minto Road, New Delhi for fresh
adjudication. The petitioner was also given liberty to file documents
before the authority.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioner admits that notice under section
126(2) dated 26.3.1993 was issued for enhancement of the rateable
value from Rs. 86,080/- to Rs.8,55,970/- on account of increase in rent
and in view of the amendment made to the Delhi Rent Control Act,
1958.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned order is
liable to be set aside because only one notice under section 126(2) of
the Act was issued on 26.3.1993 for revising rateable value w.e.f.
1.4.1992 and therefore rateable value could not have been revised to
Rs.4,51,050/-

w.e.f.

1.9.1992,

Rs.4,25,990/-

w.e.f.

1.4.1994,

Rs.7,97,304/- w.e.f. 21.9.2000, Rs.9,82,254/- w.e.f. 1.4.2002 and to
Rs.12,50,744/- w.e.f. Rs.15.2004. He relies upon proviso to section

126(1) of the Act.
5. Before I deal with the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the
petitioner I would like to mention that the respondent/MCD had issued
another notice under section 126(2) of the Act dated 10th March, 2002
for revising rateable value of the property from Rs.8,55,970/- to
Rs.21,09,200/- w.e.f. 1.4.2001. This fact is mentioned by the
respondent/MCD in their counter affidavit but has been denied by the
petitioner in the rejoinder. Learned counsel for the respondent/MCD has
produced the original file before this court. Original file indicates that the
said notice was sent by registered post and the postal receipt is pasted
at the back side of the said notice. Therefore I am inclined to believe the
averments made in the counter affidavit filed by the respondent/MCD.
Presumption under section 27 of the General Clauses Act and Section
114 of the Evidence Act is applicable to the present case. Reference in
this regard can also be made to section 444 of Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957 which provides for service of notice by registered
post.
6. In order to examine the contention raised by learned counsel for the
petitioner reference is required to be made to section 126(1), (2) and (4)
of the Act. The said provisions read as under :

“126. Amendment of assessment list.—
(1)
The Commissioner may, at any time,
amend the assessment list(a) by inserting therein the name of any person
whose name ought to be inserted; or
(b) by inserting therein any land or building previously
omitted; or
(c) by striking out the name of any person not liable
for the payment of property taxes; or
(d) by increasing or reducing for adequate reasons
the amount of any rateable value and of the
assessment thereupon; or
(e) by making or cancelling any entry exempting any
land or building from liability to any property tax; or
(f) by altering the assessment on the land or building
which has been erroneously valued or assessed
through fraud, mistake or accident ; or
(g) by inserting or altering an entry in respect of any
building erected, re-erected, altered or added to, after
the preparation of the assessment list:
Provided that no person shall by reason of any such
amendment become liable to pay any tax or increase
of tax in respect of any period prior to the
commencement of the year in which the notice under
sub-section (2) is given].
(2)
Before making any amendment under
sub-section (1) the Commissioner shall give to any
person affected by the amendment, notice of not less
than one month that he proposes to make the
amendment and consider any objections which may
be made by such person.

(4)
No amendment under Sub-section (1)
shall be made in the assessment list in relation to—
(a) any year prior to the year commencing on the 1st
day of April, 1988, after the 31st day of March, 1991;
(b) the year commencing on the 1st day of April,
1988, or any other year thereafter, after the expiry of
three years from the end of the year in which the
notice is given under Sub-section (2) or Sub-section
(3), as the case may be.”
7. Section 126(1) of the Act stipulates that the Commissioner can at any
time amend the assessment list and change the rateable value of the
property mentioned in the assessment list. Section 126(2) of the Act
provides for issue of notice to the assesee or the owner of the property,
when Commissioner wants to change or amend the rateable value. Use
of the words “at any time” in section 126(1) indicates that assessment
list can be amended or modified without limitation. No specific time
period is prescribed under section 126(1) and 126(2) of the Act to
amend the assessment list.

Proviso to section 126(1) of the Act

however stipulates that assesee will not be liable to pay tax or
enhanced tax except for the financial year for which notice under
section 126(2) has been given to him. Amendment of assessment list
and revision of rateable value is distinct from liability to pay tax or
enhanced tax. It therefore follows that assessment list can be amended

or modified and the rateable value can be increased at any time but an
assesee will be liable to pay tax or enhanced tax pursuant to the said
amendment only from the beginning of the year i.e. 1st April in the year
in which notice for enhancement has been given. Thus, tax or enhanced
tax cannot be charged prior to the financial year in which notice of
enhancement / notice under Section 126(2) has been given.
8. In line with the above discussion, let us examine the factual background
of the present case. It is admitted that notice for enhancement of the
rateable value was given on 26.3.1993 for revising rateable value of the
property from Rs.86,080/- to Rs.8,56,970/- w.e.f. 1.4.1992. by an exparte assessment order dated 22.3.1996 rateable value was enhanced
to Rs.8,55,970/-. The said rateable value after enhancement from
1.4.1992 continued to remain in the assessment list for the subsequent
period also. It is well settled that rateable value once fixed and
mentioned in the assessment list continues thereafter till objections are
filed by an assessee or notice under section 126(2) is issued and
assessment order is passed modifying/amending the rateable value.
9. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that rateable
value could be fixed only w.e.f. 1.4.1992 and not for the period
subsequent thereafter w.e.f. 1.4.1993 or thereafter in the absence of
fresh notice under section 126(2) cannot be accepted. The reason for

the same is apparent. Rateable value of the property was enhanced to
Rs.8,55,970/- by Assessment order dated 22.3.1996 w.e.f. 1.4.1992
pursuant to notice under section 126 dated 26.3.1993. The said rateable
value continued and was part of the assessment list in the financial
years, thereafter till the remand order dated 6th December, 2000 was
passed for fresh assessment and the order dated 22.3.1996 was set
aside. After order dated 6th December, 2000 was passed, the proposal
for enhancement of the rateable value got revived and the question of
rateable value of the property in the assessment list again became
subject matter of adjudication. It was not possible for MCD to perceive
as a fortune teller that rateable value of Rs.8,55,970/- fixed w.e.f.
1.4.1992 would be set aside and the matter would be remanded back.
Once notice dated 26.3.1992 was issued and the rateable value was
fixed at Rs.8,55,970/- w.e.f. 1.4.1992 MCD was not required to issue
any notice for enhancement under section 126(2) of the Act as long as
the rateable value did not exceed the figure of Rs.8,55,970/-. MCD is
not required to behave like a soothsayer and could not have presumed
that assessment order dated 22.3.1996 would be set aside and the
matter would have been remanded back vide order dated 6th December,
2000. In view of the above reasoning, I do not find any merit in the
present writ petition challenging the rateable value as enhanced from

time to time w.e.f. 1.4.1992 onwards till 31.3.2002 as the rateable value
fixed vide order dated 22.3.2005 was below Rs.8,55,970/-.
10.

As far as rateable value w.e.f. 1.4.2002 is concerned MCD had

issued notice for enhancement dated 10th March, 2002 under section
126(2) of the Act for increase in rateable value from Rs.8,55,970/- to
Rs.21,09,200/-. Though this fact is not mentioned in the assessment
order but is a relevant and an important fact. This notice was given to
the petitioner/assesee in terms of the proviso to section 126(1) of the
Act and the same cannot be ignored. The assessment can be justified
on the basis of notice under section 126(2) of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act. As already held above amendment of assessment list
and liability to pay tax are separate and distinct. Liability to pay tax
depends upon the year in which notice is given. Though desirable, the
giving of notice need not be mentioned in the assessment order. Like a
decree sheet or a bill it can be prepared and dealt with after the order is
passed.
11.

Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the said notice

was issued in the name of Mr. J K Choudhry who had expired by then. I
may mention here that mutation and change in the municipal records
from M/s J K Choudhry to M/s Jugal Kishore Choudhry Charitable and
Educational Trust was done by passing of the order dated 23.3.2005.

There is not document on record to show that the petitioner had at any
time applied for transfer of mutation in the prescribed form as provided
in section 128 of the Act. It appears that in the letter dated 1.03.2001,
the petitioner trust had filed some documents relating to court
proceedings

etc.

and

compromise

decree

between

the

legal

representatives of Late Mr. J K Choudhry to set up their claim for
mutation of property in favour of the trust.
12.

I may note here that during the course of assessment

proceedings after order dated 6th December, 2000, the petitioner had
submitted various documents including rent agreements etc. It is on
this basis that rateable value has been fixed. The rateable value so
fixed has not been challenged and questioned on merits. It is also not
denied that the petitioner was not filing returns as required by the byelaws. The petitioner did not before the assessing officer object to fixation
of different rateable values for different periods. Learned counsel for
the petitioner has drawn my attention in this regard to letter dated 29th
March, 2004 wherein it is stated that except for notice dated 26th March,
1995 proposing to fix rateable value w.e.f. 1st April, 1992, no other
notice has been issued. The aforesaid statement made in the letter
dated 29th March, 2004 cannot be construed as an objection before the
Joint Assessor and Collector to fixation of different rateable values for

different period w.e.f. 1.4.1992.
13.

The last submission made by the learned counsel for the

petitioner was that the petitioner is entitled to benefit of section 116G(2)
and the assessment should have been made on unit area method. I am
afraid this contention of the petitioner again cannot be accepted as
116G(2) requires that option should be exercised by an assesee before
assessment proceeding is finalized. Even if it is presumed that after
remand, assessment proceeding was pending and had not been
finalized, the assesee should have exercised his option for unit area
method before assessment order was passed. There is no document on
record to show that the assesee had opted for unit area method prior to
order dated 23.03.2005.
14.

In view of the above I do not find any merit in the present writ

petition and is liable to be dismissed.
15.

However, I grant the petitioner/assesee six weeks time to make

payment of the difference between the amount paid and the amount
payable as per assessment order dated 25.3.2005. On such payment
being made the petitioner will be granted rebate which is otherwise
available on payment within the prescribed time. This concession is
being granted to the petitioner as the question involved in the present
writ petition relates to interpretation of section 126 and the plea raised

by the petitioner was plausible and required consideration.
No costs.
