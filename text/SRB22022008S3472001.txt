The plaint avers that on the basis of representation and request made of the

defendant No.2 and 3, the Defendant No.1, it was appointed by the plaintiff as the agent
for sale of tickets (domestic and international) sometimes in the year 1993. In terms and
conditions of agency, the defendants were required to remit the sale proceeds of

of passenger tickets the plaintiff company had provided the defendant with blank

CS(OS) 347/2001

passenger air tickets (cash value documents). The defendants at the end of every fortnight
were required to furnish to the plaintiff company the complete details regarding sale of
tickets, details of sector and the fare charged from the passenger, while remitting the
amount to the plaintiff company.
4.

It is averred that in acknowledgment of terms and conditions of the appointment

of the defendant No.1 as sales agent, it furnished a bank guarantee No.36194 dated 10 th

It is averred that the defendants failed to remit the proceeds within the stipulated

period at the end of fortnight and also failed to furnish the details to the plaintiff company
of substantial number of tickets which were sold by them. The plaintiff, upon verifying
its records found that the defendants were holding 513 unaccounted tickets of which the
defendants 358 were utilized to the extent of approximately Rs.71.65 lakhs. It is alleged
that the defendants are still in possession of 155 unutilized tickets (Cash Value
Documents). The defendants, in utter breach of the terms of appointment failed to
account for the tickets.
7.

That in order to discharge part liability of the plaintiff company for the sale of

tickets for the period 16.12.97 to 31.12.1997, the defendants No.2 and 3 on behalf of
defendant No.1 tendered a cheque bearing No. 074223 dated 15.01.1998 for the sum of
Rs.45,92,539. The said chqeue was drawn on the Jammu & Kashmir Bank Ltd.,
Connaught Place Branch, New Delhi. The plaintiff company deposited the cheque with
their banker, the Bank of Baroda, Parliament Street Branch for realization from the

CS(OS) 347/2001

4 of 9

defendants’ banker. However, the said cheque was returned unpaid by the plaintiff’s bank
through the memo dated 21st January, 1998 with remarks “not sufficient funds”.
8.

The plaintiff company then caused a notice dated 05.02.1998 issued through its

counsel under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act to the respondents. However,
the defendants failed and neglected to pay their admitted dues of Rs.45,92,539 even after
the statutory period. The plaintiff company finally filed a complaint before the Additional
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala House, New Delhi u/s 138 of Negotiable
Instrument Act and the same is pending adjudication.
9.

The plaintiff alleges that the defendants are liable to pay Rs.81,79,840/- (Rupees

eighty one lacs seventy nine thousand eight hundred and forty only) towards the gross
amount of sale proceeds for the periods as stated in para 9 of the plaint. Apart from this
they are also liable to pay an amount of Rs.71.64 lakhs on account of unaccounted 358
utilised tickets. Thus the total of Rs.1,53,43,840 is due from the defendants. It is alleged
that according to prevalent regulations of the plaintiff company, if a ticket is not
accounted for or surrendered by the agent, then he is liable to be charged the maximum
fare on the longest sector for which that ticket can be used.
10.

That the defendants made part payment of Rs.l0,52,539 though pay order on

22.01.1998 and a cash payment of Rs.1,00,000/- on 27.01.1998 towards payment of

CS(OS) 347/2001

5 of 9

outstanding dues lying in the credit of defendants. The plaintiff also received a pay order
No. 116360 dated 23.02.1998 for Rs.10 lakhs from J & K Bank against the bank
guarantee provided by the defendants. After deducting the above amounts the total
amount due and payable by the respondents is Rs.1,31,92,401/-.
11.

Despite service of summons, through publication, the defendants did not appear in

the suit; they were set down ex-parte on 12-4-2005. The plaintiff relied on affidavit
evidence in support of its case and also produced documents.
12.

In support of its case, the plaintiff relied upon the affidavit evidence of Ms. Rohita

Jadika, its commercial manager, dated 19th July, 2005. The witness generally supported
the plaint averments. She also marked documents Exhibit P-1/1 to Exh. P-1/16. These
include the notices issued to the defendant; certified copy of the complaint filed, cheque
issued by the defendant, the memo of the plaintiff’s bank, informing that the cheque was
not honoured, letter of appointment of the defendant as the plaintiff’s agent; the list of
tickets and the amounts recoverable from the defendants and unanswered letters of the
plaintiff.
13.

It is apparent from the above discussion that the plaintiff had entered into an

agreement with the defendants, whereby the latter was nominated as their agent, for
selling air tickets. According to the plaintiffs, during the period 1996-1998, though the

CS(OS) 347/2001

6 of 9

defendants was issued 513 tickets which were utilizable, they failed to settle accounts for
them, which they were bound to every fortnight. The terms of the agreement between the
parties have not been brought on record. A photocopy of the agency agreement entered
into in 1993 was filed; yet, the plaintiff did not produce the originals and mark it in the
evidence. The evidence available therefore, is confined to letters written to the defendants
demanding payment of amounts for the sold and unsold tickets, on 2-3-1998; it is Exh. P1/6. The details for the amount claimed, i.e Rs. 1,31,92,401/- is Exh. PW-1/7. This
document, and other such documents, however are not extracts of books of account; they
were not produced at the time of filing the suit. There is no averment in the affidavit that
the lists are true extracts of ledgers containing the account of the defendants.
14.

The plaintiff, as observed in the preceding paragraph, has not produced the terms

of the agreement. In the absence of any express terms, or rules and regulations which
bind the parties, either contractually or in law, the claim of the plaintiff as regards unsold
tickets, numbering 155 is not sustainable. One can understand that an agent, entrusted
with a tradeable commodity though in a position to use it, is unable to do so; it may lead
to diminution in value or loss of goods. Subject to rules of appropriation of such goods,
the party may be sued for value of goods. Here, however, the defendants were given
tickets for sale. 155 of those could not, or were not sold. No evidence was led to show

CS(OS) 347/2001

7 of 9

that the tickets had the effect of blocking a particular segment of any sector, or did so,
during any period. In these circumstances, the claim for the notional farthest value of the
tickets, in any sector of the plaintiff cannot be granted, without any proof of damage.
Thus, the claim as far as it relates to the sum of Rs. 71, 64,000/- has to fail.
15.

As noticed earlier, the plaintiff did not produce any extract of its ledger or any

book of account; the same was not also produced or noted when the suit was filed.
Therefore, the claim for Rs.81,79,840/- (Rupees eighty one lacs seventy nine thousand
eight hundred and forty only) towards the gross amount of sale proceeds for the periods
as stated in para 9 of the plaint are based only on assertions, except as far as they concern
the amounts forming part of the cheque issued by the defendants, which were
dishonoured. In the circumstances, the plaintiff cannot be said to have proved the entirety
of that claim. What however, has been proved is that a cheque was issued to the plaintiff
by the defendant for Rs.45,92,539/-. That cheque was not honoured; a criminal complaint
is pending before the competent court.
16.

In view of the above discussion, the plaintiff, in the opinion of the court, has been

able to prove its case for a decree in the sum of Rs.45,92,539/-. The transactions between
the parties was a commercial one, as the defendants were the plaintiff’s agents. They did
not make any attempt to pay up the amounts. Therefore, the plaintiff is also entitled to

CS(OS) 347/2001

8 of 9

pendente lite and future interest @ 10% p.a. on the said amount. The plaintiff shall also
disclose the present judgment to the court trying the complaint preferred by it.
17.

The suit has to therefore, partly succeed. It is therefore, decreed against the

defendants, to the extent of Rs.45,92,539/- with pendente lite interest @10% p.a from the
date of institution of the suit till realization, with costs. Let decree be drawn in these
terms.
