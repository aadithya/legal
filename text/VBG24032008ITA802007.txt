Page 1 of 5

the impugned order dated 25th August, 2006 passed by the
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Delhi Bench „E‟ (for short as
„Tribunal‟) in ITA No.152/Del/2006 for the assessment year
2001-02 vide which the appeal filed by the Assessee against the
order passed by Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [for
short as CIT (A)] was dismissed.
2.

The

substantial

question

of

law

which

arises

for

consideration in this case is:“Whether notice under Section 143(2) of the
Income Tax Act, 1961, in this case has not been
served within the mandatory period as prescribed
under the law?”
3.

The brief facts of this case are that the Assessee filed the

return of income on 31st October, 2001. The Assessing Officer
issued notice dated 29th October, 2002 under Section 143(2) of
the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short as „Act‟).

The same was

sent through speed post on 30th October, 2002 and it was issued
at the address mentioned in the return of income being Nulon
House, 10th Mile Stone, Mathura Road, New Delhi. The notice
was redirected at A-74, Sector-5, Noida and it was served at the
redirected address on 6th November, 2002.

4.

The Assessing Officer as well as CIT(A) held that the

notice was issued at the address mentioned in the return and
the change in address was not notified by the Assessee and,
thus, there is valid service of notice within the time prescribed
and hence assessment made pursuant to the said notice is also
valid.
5.

The Tribunal vide impugned order held that the notice has

been sent within the period of limitation and hence the
assessment

made

pursuant

to

the

such

notice

is

valid

assessment.
6.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

Petitioner that there was no material before the authorities in
support of service on 31st October, 2002 and the redirection
could at all be done on 3rd November, 2002, the other date
indicated by the post office on the envelop, in that case the
service cannot be taken before 3rd November, 2002 and since
the notice was served after mandatory period, the assessment in
question cannot be sustained.
7.

On the other hand, it has been argued by learned counsel

for the Revenue that notice under Section 143(2) was issued on
ITA No.80/2007

Page 3 of 5

29th October, 2002 and has been sent by speed post on 30th
October, 2002 and it has been received at the given address of
the Assessee on 31st October, 2002. Thereafter at the instance
of the Assessee, it was redirected at the address of Noida. So,
notice in question has been served upon the Assessee within the
prescribed period.
8.

As per material placed on record, the notice in question

has been dispatched on 30th October, 2002 and thereafter it has
been redirected to the Noida address of the Assessee. There is
nothing on record to show as to on which date this notice was
received at the given address of the Assessee and on which date
the same was redirected.
9.

As per order of the CIT(A) placed on record, the Assessing

Officer was asked for comments and vide its letter dated 12/20th
October, 2004, the Asessing Officer stated:“The notice was served by speed post which must
be delivered to the Assessee within 24 hours, that
is, by morning of 31st October”
10.

So, the Assessing officer is also not sure nor specific as to

when the notice in question has been served upon the Assessee.
It is only a presumption that notice which have been sent by
ITA No.80/2007

Page 4 of 5

speed post on 30th October, 2002, must have been delievered to
the Assessee by 31st October, 2002. There is no presumption
under the law that any notice sent by speed post must have
been delivered to the Assessee within 24 hours.

Moreover,

there is nothing on record to show as whose instance the notice
was redirected and sent at the address of Noida.
11.

So, from the material available on record, we come to the

conclusion that no notice under Section 143(2) of the Act, which
is mandatory requirement of law, have been served upon the
Assessee within prescribed period.
12.

Under the circumstances, the appeal filed by the Assessee

is allowed and the impugned order passed by the Tribunal is set
aside.
13.

The substantial question of law is, thus, answered in the

affirmative, in favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue.
14.

Appeal stands disposed of.
