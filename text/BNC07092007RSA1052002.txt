B.N.CHATURVEDI, J.
1.
The appellant is in second appeal against a
judgment/order dated 4th May, 2002 of learned Addl.
R.S.A. No.105/2002

Page 1 of 12

District Judge dismissing his appeal being barred by
limitation.
2.

The respondent had filed a suit for recovery of
Rs.47,600/- against the appellant which was decreed
by the court of Civil Judge.

The appellant filed an

appeal against the same. To the memo of appeal
instead of certified copies of the judgment and decree,
only photocopies thereof were annexed.

Later, on

realizing the mistake the appellant sought to place on
record certified copies of impugned judgment and
decree which was contested by the respondent on the
plea that

since the appeal had been filed without

annexing

thereto

judgment

and

certified
decree,

copies

the

of

appeal

impugned
was

not

maintainable and also that the same was otherwise
barred by limitation. The learned Addl. District Judge
holding

that

since

neither

any

application

for

condonation of delay was filed nor an application
R.S.A. No.105/2002

Page 2 of 12

seeking exemption from filing certified copies of the
impugned judgment and decree had been made, the
appeal was liable to be dismissed being beyond the
period of limitation and accordingly dismissed the
same.
3.

I have heard the learned counsel from either
side.

4.

The argument of the learned counsel for the
appellant was that even if the appeal was barred by
limitation

and

the

memo

of

appeal

was not

accompanied by an application for condonation of
delay, the learned Addl. District Judge should have,
instead of proceeding to dismiss the appeal as being
barred by limitation, required the appellant to make
appropriate application for condonation of delay. He
in support of his arguments in this regard referred to
INSTRUCTIONS TO CIVIL COURTS IN DELHI [Vol. I
of High Court Rules and Orders] pertaining to civil
R.S.A. No.105/2002

Page 3 of 12

appeals and

revisions and two decisions of Punjab

and Haryana High Court in Rakesh Raj etc. vs. Kewal
Kumar etc.; Vol.

178 The Punjab Law Reporter

[Vol. LXXXVI-1984] and

M/s Vishwas Trading

Corporation, Ludhiana vs. M/s

M.K.C. Industries,

Ludhiana; 451 The Punjab Law Reporter [LXXXVI1984] as also a Supreme Court decision in State
(M.P.) vs. Pradeep Kumar; 2000 Rajdhani Law
Reporter 539 (SC).
5.

On the contrary from the side of respondent a
reference was made to decisions in Union of India vs.
M.M. Anand & Ors.; AIR 1988 Delhi 271 and Delhi
Development Authority Vs. Smt. Sushil Kaur & Anr.;
AIR 1997 Delhi 104, Rampravesh Singh & Ors. Vs.
Mahesh Singh & Ors.; AIR 1961 Patna 129

and

State of J & K & Ors. Vs. Gh. Nabi War; AIR 1997
Jammu & Kashmir 24 to stress the point that where
the memo of appeal is not accompanied by certified
R.S.A. No.105/2002

Page 4 of 12

copies of judgment and decree appealed from and the
same are placed on record after expiry of the period of
limitation prescribed for appeal, the appeal would be
time barred.
6.

In the wake of issue raised for consideration,
in the backdrop of the facts of the case, following
substantial

question of law is formulated

for

determination :
Q. :

Whether

certified

copies

an
of

appeal
judgment

filed
and

without
decree

appealed from and without an application for
condonation of delay accompanying the memo
of appeal, would be liable to outright dismissal
as barred by limitation without requiring the
appellant to remedy the defect ?
7.

Order XLI Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure
provides that an appeal is to be preferred in the form
of a memorandum signed by the appellant or his
R.S.A. No.105/2002

Page 5 of 12

agent. The memo of appeal was prior to 1st July, 2002
required to be accompanied by a copy of the decree
appealed

from

and

(unless

the

appellate

court

dispenses therewith) of the judgment on which it is
founded.

By way of

Code of Civil Procedure

(Amendment) Act, 1999 w.e.f. 1st July, 2002 now the
memo of appeal is to be accompanied only by a copy
of the judgment appealed from.

There can be no two

opinions on legal proposition that a memo of appeal
is to be accompanied by certified copies of judgment
and decree or copy of judgment appealed from, as the
case may be and where the memo of appeal is
unaccompanied thereby, the same would not be a
valid presentation. Similarly, where an appeal is filed
beyond the period of limitation without an application
for condonation of delay accompanying the same, it
would be a case of curable defect and the deficiency
could be required to be removed by directing the
R.S.A. No.105/2002

Page 6 of 12

appellant

to

make

an

appropriate

application

explaining the delay in filing the appeal.
8.

INSTRUCTIONS TO CIVIL COURTS IN DELHI
[Vol. I of High Court Rules and Orders] prescribing
procedure in the case of appeals and applications
presented after period of limitation provide thus :
“5.
Appellant required on explain for
delay – In such cases if the appellant has
not tendered, with the memorandum of
appeal, any explanation of the delay in
presenting it, the Court shall, if the appellant
is present in person or by agent, record an
order thereon, or to be annexed thereto,
requiring the appellant to supply such
explanation in writing, and to represent such
appeal within a period to be specified in the
order. Such period may be enlarged in the
discretion of the Court, either before or after
it has expired, upon sufficient cause for such
enlargement being shown to the satisfaction
of the Court.
6.
Examination of appellant – When
the memorandum of appeal is represented
with the explanation required or when the
memorandum of appeal as first presented
contains an explanation of the delay in
presenting
it, the Court shall take into
consideration the explanation offered, and
R.S.A. No.105/2002

Page 7 of 12

may examine the appellant or his agent, in
order to elucidate the explanation.

9.

7.
Court may dismiss appeal as barred
by time – If the Court is of opinion that
assuming all the facts stated by way of
explanation to be true, the explanation is
(in)sufficient, the Court shall record an order
to that effect, and shall reject the appeal as
barred by time.....”
Apart from above quoted instructions on the
subject, the decision of the Supreme Court in Pradeep
Kumar's case (supra) clearly lays down that where the
appeal is filed late ordinarily it must be accompanied
by an application for condonation of delay. If the
memo of appeal is not accompanied by such an
application,

the

same

may

be

returned

for

amendment as it would not be a valid presentation. It
may then be open to the appellant to file an
application for condonation of delay and remove the
defect. On Rule 3A Order XLI CPC it was laid down
that “the rule cannot be interpreted very harshly and
make the non-compliance punitive to appellant.
R.S.A. No.105/2002

Page 8 of 12

It

was observed that an unintentional lapse on the part
of litigant should not normally cause the doors of the
judicature permanently closed before him”.
10.

In the present case when

the appeal was

initially filed only photocopies of the impugned
judgment and decree were annexed to the memo of
appeal which could,

of course, be not treated as a

valid presentation of the appeal.

Certified copies of

the impugned judgment and decree were sought to be
placed on record at a much later stage by which time
the period of limitation for appeal had already
expired. No application for condonation of delay was
filed while seeking to place the certified copies of the
impugned judgment and decree on record at such
later stage. The memo of appeal initially filed without
certified copies of impugned judgment and decree
was, as a matter of course, liable to be returned to the
appellant being not a valid presentation.
R.S.A. No.105/2002

Page 9 of 12

This was

however not done. The question of limitation came to
be raised by the respondent for consideration only
when the appellant sought to bring on record certified
copies of impugned judgment and decree in place of
photo copies thereof filed initially with the memo of
appeal. In view of obvious delay in filing the certified
copies of the impugned judgment and decree, the
appellant was required to be asked to explain the
delay in writing.

The learned Addl. District Judge

however instead of either returning the memo of
appeal to the appellant being not validly presented or
requiring

him to

make an application in writing

explaining the delay in seeking to place on record the
certified copies of the impugned judgment and decree,
proceeded to dispose of the appeal as being barred by
limitation on the basis of whatever was available on
record as also the oral submissions made from either
side. This was clearly not the advisable course as set
R.S.A. No.105/2002

Page 10 of 12

out in the Instructions to Civil Courts on civil appeals
and revisions.

The proper course for the learned

Court below was to have granted time to the appellant
to enable

him to make

appropriate

application

explaining delay, if any, in filing the appeal and/or
omission on his part in filing the certified copies of the
impugned judgment and decree with the memo of
appeal and for applying to place the same on record
at a belated stage when the period of limitation for
appeal had expired much earlier.
11.

The appeal is, in the circumstances, allowed and the

impugned judgment/order dated 4th May, 2002 dismissing the
appeal as time barred is set aside. The case is remanded to the
concerned court of learned Addl. District Judge with a direction
to grant reasonable time to the appellant to file appropriate
application in writing to explain delay and on such an

application being made to hear and decide the same
in accordance with law.
