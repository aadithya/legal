ORDER
% 27.02.2008

1. CM No.12527/2004
This is an application for bringing on record legal representatives of Mr. Vimal
Chandra. In the application it is stated that Mr. Vimal Chandra has left behind
3 sons and 2 daughters. The said legal representatives have been served and

reply has been filed by all of them except Ms. Shashi Nafari. Ms. Shashi
Nafari has been served but has not cared to enter appearance. The cause of
action survives. I see no ground or reason, why the legal representatives of
Mr. Vimal Chandra should not be brought on record. The application is
allowed. The amended memo of parties is also taken on record.
2. W.P.(C) No.11295/2004
Rule. With the consent of the parties the matter is taken up for disposal.
3. Property bearing no.A-17, First Floor and Second Floor Front (Half)

portion, Hauz Khas, New Delhi was assessed to property tax at the
rateable value of Rs.72,200/- w.e.f. 1/4/1994. The rateable value fixed
was on the basis of MCD (Determination of Rateable Values) Bye Laws,
1994. Assessment order in this regard was passed on 18/7/1997
pursuant to a rectification application moved by the respondent under
Section 176 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (hereinafter
referred to as Act). I may note here that by the same order rateable
value of the property in question was fixed at Rs.1,98,200/- w.e.f.
1/8/1991. However, the said determination is not subject matter of
challenge in the present writ petition.
4. The respondents challenged this order dated 18/7/1997 fixing rateable

value of the property in question at Rs.72,200/- w.e.f. 1/4/1994 before

Additional District Judge under section 169 of the Act. Challenge was
also made to the rateable value of Rs.1,98,200/- w.e.f. 1.8.1991 to
31.3.1994. The learned ADJ by his order dated 20th May, 1998 upheld
the rateable value of the property fixed w.e.f. 1/4/1994. In paragraph 8,
12 and 13 of the said order dated 20th May, 1998 has been observed as
under :
“8. ------------------. However, RV fixed from 1.4.94 would remain

maintained as the appellant counsel is not disputing the land rate taken
for fixing this RV.
12. Since the matter is being remanded back for fixing this RV w.e.f.
1/8/1991 as per law. However, the RV of Rs.72,200/- fixed w.e.f. 1.4.94
would remain maintained. The assessing authority would also see the
dispute of the rebate and if the payment was made by the appellant
within the stipulated period entitling the appellant for rebate then the
appellant should be given prompt payment rebate.”
13. With these observations, both these appeals are partly accepted.
RV of Rs.1,98,200/- w.e.f. 1.8.91 is set aside and matter is remanded
back for fixing the RV as per law w.e.f. 1.8.91. However, the RV of
Rs.72,200/- w.e.f. 1.4.94 is maintained. The assessing authority should
also see the dispute with regard to the rebate on account of prompt
payment. Parties to bear their own costs. Files be consigned to record
room. A copy of this order be placed in the other file.”
5. It is clear from the reading of the above paragraphs that rateable value

of Rs.72,200/- as fixed w.e.f. 1/4/1994 was maintained. However, the
matter was remanded back for determining rateable value w.e.f.
1/8/1991 till 31/3/1994.

6. The respondent herein did not challenge the order dated 20 May, 1998

in so far as rateable value w.e.f. 1/4/1994 at Rs.72,200/- was
maintained. The said order therefore has become final and binding
between the parties. The order has attained its finality in so far as
rateable value w.e.f. 1/4/1994 is concerned.
th

7. Pursuant to the order dated 20 May, 1998, the assessing authority was

to examine and fix the rateable value for the period 1/8/1991 till
31/3/1994. The assessing authority did not have jurisdiction and
authority to fix rateable value of the property for the period after
1/4/1994 and therefore did not pass any order pertaining to the said
period. Order dated 16/4/2003 was passed by the assessing authority
pertaining to the period 1/4/1991 till 31/3/1994. This was made subject
matter of another appeal before the Appellate Authority. While filing the
said appeal the respondent assessee also raised additional grounds
challenging rateable value of Rs.72,200/- fixed w.e.f. 1/4/1994. The
Appellate Authority under section 169 of Act has allowed the appeal
filed by the respondent and has set aside the rateable value of
Rs.72,200/- w.e.f. 1/4/1994 on the ground that principle of parity had not
been considered.
8. I do not think the order passed by the Appellant Authority setting aside

the rateable value of Rs.72,200/- w.e.f. 1/4/1994 can be sustained. As is

clear from the order dated 20th May, 1998 passed by the Appellant
Authority that rateable value w.e.f. 1/4/1994 was maintained. To that
extent the ratable value fixed by the assessing authority has attained
finality. The assessing authority could not have re-examined or gone
into the question of ratable value w.e.f. 1/4/1994. The assessing
authority by order dated 16/4/2003 had only examined and gone into the
question and fixed the ratable value of the property for the period
1/8/1991 till 31/3/1994. It was this order which was made subject matter
of appeal under section 169 of the Act. The jurisdiction of the Appellate
Authority was limited to the correctness and the rateable value of the
property fixed of this order for the period prior to 31.3.1994. The
Appellate Authority did not have jurisdiction to go into and examine the
rateable value w.e.f. 1/4/1994 which had already become final and
binding after order dated 20th May, 1998 was accepted by the
respondent assessee. The rateable value w.e.f. 31/3/1994 could not be
reopened in an appeal fixing rateable value for the period between
1/8/1991 to 31/3/1994. Rateable value of the property after 31/3/1994
could not be subject matter of an appeal against order dated 16/3/2003.
9. Learned counsel for the respondent relies upon Section 171 of the Act

which reads as under :

“ Finality of appellate orders – The order of the court confirming, setting

aside or modifying an order in respect of any rateable value or
assessment or liability to assessment or taxation shall be final :
Provided that it shall be lawful for the court, upon application or on its
own motion, to review any order passed by it in appeal within three
months from the date of the order.”
10. The said provision supports the case of the MCD. It stipulates that an

order of the appellate court confirming the rateable value or assessment
or liability shall be final. The Appellate Authority by its order dated 20th
May, 1998 had confirmed rateable value of Rs.72,200/- of the property
w.e.f. 1/4/1994 and the said order has therefore attained finality.
11. Learned counsel for the respondent also relies upon judgment of the

Supreme Court in the case of Mathur Prasad Sanju Jaiswal & Ors. Vs.
Tulsibai AIR 1971 Supreme Court 2355. The said judgement explains
the principle of resjudicata. It is submitted that the decision of the
Appellate Authority dated 20th May, 1998 on the question of principle of
parity is incorrect in view of subsequent decision of the Supreme Court
wherein the said principle has been accepted. It is also stated that the
judgment referred to by the Appellate Authority in the order dated 20 th
May, 1998 in the case of “Ravish Chandra Rastogi & Ors. vs. Municipal
Corporation of Delhi & Ors. reported in 67 (1997) DLT 713 (DB)” has
been set aside in the subsequent decision by the Supreme Court. This
aspect would have been relevant in case order dated 20th May, 1998

had been challenged in a writ petition and had not attained finality. The
said order having attained finality cannot now be challenged in
subsequent proceedings which do not relate to the years 1/4/1994
onwards. The order dated 20th May, 1998 will operate as resjudicata
between the parties, in so far as rateable value was fixed for the period
after 1/4/1994.
12. It is well settled that in tax matters each year as a separate year and the

principle of resjudicata has limited application. In “Bharat Sanchar
Nigam Ltd. v. Union of India,(2006) 3 SCC 1” it was observed that :“20. The decisions cited have uniformly held that res judicata does not

apply in matters pertaining to tax for different assessment years
because res judicata applies to debar courts from entertaining issues on
the same cause of action whereas the cause of action for each
assessment year is distinct. The courts will generally adopt an earlier
pronouncement of the law or a conclusion of fact unless there is a new
ground urged or a material change in the factual position. The reason
why the courts have held parties to the opinion expressed in a decision
in one assessment year to the same opinion in a subsequent year is not
because of any principle of res judicata but because of the theory of
precedent or the precedential value of the earlier pronouncement.
Where facts and law in a subsequent assessment year are the same,
no authority whether quasi-judicial or judicial can generally be permitted
to take a different view. This mandate is subject only to the usual
gateways of distinguishing the earlier decision or where the earlier
decision is per incuriam. However, these are fetters only on a
coordinate Bench which, failing the possibility of availing of either of
these gateways, may yet differ with the view expressed and refer the
matter to a Bench of superior strength or in some cases to a Bench of
superior jurisdiction.”

13. However, no such ground has been made out and argued. It is not the

case of the respondent that objections against the rateable value of
Rs.72,200/- were filed and these have been disposed of and
challenged. Rateable value of Rs.72,200/- fixed w.e.f. 1/4/1994 were by
law adopted for subsequent years but were never objected to. The
period after 1/4/1994 till 31/3/2004, when unit area method was
introduced is covered by the order dated 20th May, 1998. The rateable
value for this period between 1/4/1994 till 31/3/2004 has become final
between the parties and cannot be reopened.
14. The petitioner will raise a revised bill for the period after 1/4/1994 to

31/3/2004 after adjusting the amounts already paid. The respondent will
make payment in terms of the revised bill. He will also be entitled to
rebates permissible under the policies of MCD.
The writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
