GITA MITTAL, J.
I.A. NO. 5744/2006
This application has been filed by the defendants under Section 8 of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. The application is opposed on behalf of the
plaintiff who has pointed out that the arbitration clause under the hire-purchase
agreement dated 4th July, 2000 was restricted to disputes arising out of this agreement
between the parties and would therefore not govern the disputes which are outside the
purview of the same. The plaintiff has made a claim in the present suit of an amount of
Rs. 34,69,593/- towards an amount given as loan; an amount of Rs. 76,13,726/- on
account of sale of dumpers; and a running lease account of Rs. 16,05,272/-. It has been
pointed out that these three claims do not arise out of the agreement dated 4th July, 2000.
CS (OS) No.626/2005

Page No.1

It has further been submitted that the agreement of 4th of July, 2000 stood
exhausted inasmuch as by an offer in the letter dated 25th May, 2001, the defendants
offered to purchase these vehicles of the plaintiff which were the subject matter of the
agreement. This offer was accepted by the plaintiff and consequently, the amount
which was due and payable by the defendants came to be secured by way of demand
promissory notes and the deed of guarantee.
In this view of the matter, it is apparent that the suit claim is beyond the
arbitration clause contained in the agreement dated 4th July, 2000 even if the same was
binding. From the record placed by the plaintiff, it is apparent that this contract stood
substituted by the subsequent transaction of the sale of the vehicles.
Accordingly, the present application is dismissed.
I.A. No. 207/2007
This application has been filed by the plaintiff under Order 1 Rule 10 of the CPC
for deleting/striking out the name of the defendant no. 4.
None appears to press this application.
The same is consequently dismissed.
CS(OS) No. 626/2005
1.

The plaintiff is a company incorporated under the provisions of the Companies

Act, 1956 and registered as the non-banking financial company which is engaged in the
business of investment and leasing.
The present suit has been filed by the plaintiff under Order 37 of the Code of
Civil Procedure seeking a decree for recovery of Rs.1,26,88,591/- against the
defendants with pentende lite and future interest.
2.

As the defendants successfully avoided service of the summons, the plaintiff
CS (OS) No.626/2005

Page No.2

moved an application seeking service by the substituted modes of publication of the
citation in the daily newspaper and affixation of the summons at their last known
address and in the notice board of this court. This was permitted by the order dated 29 th
October, 2005. The defendants were duly served for the hearing fixed on 17 th March,
2006 by such mode. Again, the defendants failed to abide by the statutory limit and
failed to put in appearance within the statutory period. Appearance was put in by the
defendants only on 19th April, 2006.

The plaintiff was pressing for a decree in

accordance with the provisions of Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure on account
of the belated appearance. The defendants consequently moved an application under
Order 37 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for condonation of delay in
filing the memo of appearance which was allowed by an order passed on 9th January,
2007.
3.

The plaintiff thereupon took steps for issuance of summons for judgment under

the provisions of Order 37 Rules 2 & 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. These summons
for judgment were also issued to the defendants on 7th March, 2007 and were served
upon them on 3rd April, 2007.

Again the defendants failed to take any steps in

accordance with law within the statutory period of limitation. In these circumstances,
following the mandate of Order 37 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure and after
giving adequate opportunity to the defendants to put in appearance or to take steps in
accordance with law, this court has proceeded to judgment. The defendants have not
only failed to take any steps to file the leave to defend application but have even failed
to put in appearance. Accordingly, this court has proceeded to judgment in accordance
with law.
4.

The defendant no.1 is a partnership concern consisting of the defendant nos.2, 3
CS (OS) No.626/2005

Page No.3

& 4 as its partners. The defendants are engaged in the business of sub-contractor in the
mining and construction industry. By a hire purchase agreement dated 4th July, 2000,
the defendants took on hire purchase basis, two dumpers of the plaintiff for a period of
twelve months being vehicle nos.T-815 T A TRA – IND dumper vehicles being chassis
nos. TU21RR11F0118 and TU21RR11F00 0121. The defendant no.2 had given his
personal guarantee in respect of the two vehicles. The defendants had agreed to pay a
sum of Rs.45,000/- per month for each dumper as hire charges and the defendants had
the rights to purchase the vehicle during the period of one year.
5.

By a letter 25th May, 2001, the defendants offered to purchase the two vehicles of

the plaintiff at a price of Rs.24,62,500/- each. This offer of the defendants was accepted
by the plaintiff by a letter dated 30th May, 2001. The two afore-detailed vehicles were
handed over by the plaintiff to the defendants on finalisation of this agreement.
Payment schedule for the payment of the sale consideration by the defendants to the
plaintiff was stipulated in the letter dated 1st June, 2001.

In terms of this

communication, a sum of Rs.24,62,500/- was payable towards the sale of each dumper
which was to be paid by the defendants in 23 monthly equated instalments commencing
from 1st September, 2001 for the sum of Rs.1,35,000/- each. In the event of default, the
defendants were liable to pay interest at the rate of 24% per annum.
6.

As the defendants failed to adhere to the re-payment schedule and defaulted in the

payment, the plaintiff agreed to a revised re-payment schedule by a letter dated 28 th
January, 2003 whereby the plaintiff agreed to receive a sum of Rs.1,80,000/- as a
fortnightly instalment from the defendants. The defendants failed to maintain financial
discipline even on this occasion despite repeated reminders. The last payment which
was made by the defendants was only in July, 2003.

In the year 2001, the defendants also approached the plaintiff for short term loans.

The plaintiff provided three loans to the defendants of the sum of Rs.10,00,000/-,
Rs.17,00,000/- and Rs.11,00,000/- respectively. The defendants executed three demand
promissory notes dated 5th January, 2001, 6th February, 2001 and 16th April, 2001
respectively to secure these loans. The defendant no.2 also executed his personal
guarantee to secure these loans which were dated 5th January, 2001, 6th February, 2001
and 16th April, 2001. On these amounts, the defendants had agreed to pay interest at the
rate of 18% per annum on the loan amount. The following post-dated cheques were
also handed over to the plaintiff towards repayment of these loan amounts:Cheque No.

Apart from the agreement to purchase these two dumpers, the defendants also

took vehicles of the plaintiff company on lease basis from time to time. For these
leases, the defendants were liable to pay rental on the basis of the rate per trip
multiplied by the number of trips.

The plaintiff raised invoices in respect of the

payments due from the defendants for this purpose. As the defendants failed to clear
the liability on account of these rentals as well, the defendants were requested by a
letter dated 4th August, 2003 to reconcile the accounts and to send their ledger account.
Despite an assurance that the defendants would send the revised ledger account, they
CS (OS) No.626/2005

Page No.5

failed to do so.
On 21st June, 2002, the plaintiff called upon the defendants to confirm the

9.

balances in the statements which were prepared by the plaintiff towards the amounts
due from the defendants in all these accounts. The defendants thus confirmed the
balance dues in the three accounts as on 31st March, 2002 and signed the account
balance in confirmation of the statements sent by the plaintiff. As on 31st March, 2002,
the following amounts were thus duly confirmed by the defendants:-

The balance dues of the defendants in all the three accounts in terms of the

agreement, pro-notes and the invoices issued to them, was again confirmed by the
defendants as on 31st March, 2003. The amounts which were confirmed as due and
payable by the defendants to the plaintiff towards the three accounts on 31st March,
2003 as confirmed by the defendants as on 7th July, 2003 were as follows:“16. That subsequently, the defendants confirmed the account
balance by signing on the statements sent by the Plaintiff for the year
ending 31-3-2003. The balance as on 31-3-2003 was duly
confirmed by the defendants on 7-7-2003. The amount due in
respect of Loan Account was Rs.24,91,808/- (Rupees twenty four
lakhs ninety one thousand eight hundred and eight) and in respect of
sale of dumpers Account was Rs.54,72,429/- (Fifty four lakhs
seventy two thousand four hundred and twenty nine).”
11.

Again, the defendants confirmed the balance dues to the plaintiff as on 31st

CS (OS) No.626/2005

Page No.6

March, 2005 as hereafter:“17. The total amount due from the defendants to the plaintiff as
on 31-3-2005 under the three accounts are given hereunder:a)
b)
c)
12.

Loan A/c: Rs.34,69,593
Sale of Dumpers A/c: Rs.76,13,726
Running A/c: Rs.16,05,272”

As the defendants failed to pay its dues to the plaintiff, by a legal notice dated

17th March, 2005, the plaintiff called upon the defendants to pay the due amount of total
of Rs.1,26,88,591/- within ten days. The defendants failed to abide by the notice
demand and the plaintiff received no payments whatsoever from the defendants
compelling it to file the present suit.
13.

In the light of the foregoing discussion, I find that the evidence of the plaintiff is

unrebutted and uncontroverted and the plaintiff has established that it is entitled to a
sum of Rs.1,26,88,951/- from the defendants. As noticed hereinabove, the dues of the
defendants are based on the admissions of the defendants itself in the agreement,
promissory notes, and in the statement of accounts which have been duly confirmed by
the defendants. There is thus no part of the suit claim which is beyond the provisions of
Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure and consequently there is no impediment to the
grant of relief to the plaintiff in the present suit.
14.

Accordingly, I hereby pass a decree in favour of the plaintiff and against the

defendants, jointly and severally in the sum of Rs.1,26,88,591/-. I also award interest to
the plaintiff on the amount decreed at a rate of 10% per annum w.e.f. 4th April, 2005
when the suit was filed till realisation of the amounts.
The suit has been necessitated on account of the defendants failing to abide by its
contractual liability and failure to make payments of admitted amounts to the plaintiff
CS (OS) No.626/2005

Page No.7

despite repeated demands. The plaintiff has fixed court fee of Rs.1,26,800/- on the
plaint. In these circumstances, I also hold that the plaintiff shall be entitled to costs of
the present suit which are quantified at Rs.2,00,000/-.
