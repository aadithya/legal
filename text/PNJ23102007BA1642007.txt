thousand five hundred and one). A fixed deposit of
Rs.50,000/- has also been freezed in this account. There
are transactions worth more than Rs.19 lacs in this
account during a period of about 2 ½ years. A sum
of Rs.7 lacs were withdrawn from this account on
24.10.2005 and 26.10.2005 with the intention of
destroying evidence and siphoning off the money
from the eyes of law.
It is interesting to note that during the same period a
notice under Section 160 Cr.P.C. was issued to Zohra
Sheikh for 28.10.2005 and was pasted at the residence of
Zohra Sheikh i.e. Flat No.A-136/6, Lal Building, Nizam
Basti, Nizamuddin, Delhi on which her sister Mrs.Fatima
Ameen gave a reply in writing that Zohra Sheikh is away
to Ajmer for ZIYARAT and hence could not join
investigation. In fact, Zohra Sheikh was in Delhi and she
was destroying the evidence by withdrawing the huge
cash from her account personally on 24 and 26 October
2005.
On scrutiny of documents pertaining to SB Account
No.2216, Bank of India, CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, Delhi
it is found that this account was opened by Zohra Begum
on 3.2.1999 with an initial deposit of Rs.50,000/- (Rs.Fifty
thousand) and mentioned her address as C-278, Bawli
Gate, Gali Goga Bai, Basti Nizamuddin, Delhi with date of
birth as 04.05.1969. This account too was introduced by
Bail Application No.164/2007

Mrs.Fatima Amin. The patter of account is similar to that

this account on different dates. Some of the major

Seventy four thousand five hundred) on 25.2.2002, cash

DD of Rs.10 lacs (Rs.Ten lacs) was sent to Mumbai in the
name of Sharafat Sheikh on 5.3.2004 from this account.
There were transactions worth more than Rs.31 lacs
during a short period of 24.12.2001 to 2.8.2004 in
this account of Zohra Sheikh.
On scrutiny of documents of SB A/c No.40488 of Zohra
Sheikh w/o Sharafat Sheikh r/o 136/6 IInd Floor, Basti
Nizamuddin, Delhi, it was found that this account too has
been used for depositing heavy cash. Some of the major
credit entries are Rs.50,000/- (Rs.fifty thousand) on
1.10.2002, Rs.5 lacs (Rupees Five lacs) on 4.3.2003,
Rs.60,000/- (Rupees Sixty thousand) on 18.12.2003,
Rs.1,42,000/- (Rs.one lac and forty two thousand) on
13.1.2004, Rs.42,000/- (Rs.forty two thousand) on

one thousand, nine hundred and twenty one) on
14.1.2001 and 5.2.2004, one pay order of Rs.1,41,971/(Rs.One lac, forty one thousand, nine hundred seventy
one) on 23.6.2004 were issued to make payment for the
flat No.160, Sec. 82, Swarnim Vihar, NOIDA, purchased in
the name of Zohra Sheikh. In this account of Zohra
Sheikh, during the period of about 2 years i.e.
26.9.2002 to 23.6.2004, transactions worth more
than Rs.11 lacs took place.
Bail Application No.164/2007

13.

In totality, if we put all the three SB A/c Nos. 2216,
40488 and 9585 of Zohra Sheikh together, there
were transactions worth more than Rs.61 lacs
during the same period.”
In respect of the petitioner, apart from referring to the

6 accounts she was maintaining in her name and in respect
whereof that she could not render any satisfactory explanation it
stands recorded that the petitioner was a divorcee when she
married Sharafat Sheikh and had no income nor any assets when
she married Sharafat Sheikh. It was further stated in the chargesheet that she had procured a voter identity card from Jammu and
Kashmir, a voter identity card from Faridpur and a voter identity
card from Bareilly. That she used these cards as identity proofs
meaning thereby she would impersonate herself as 3 different
persons. That funds had flown from her accounts for purchase of
some of the properties in the name of her husband Sharafat
Sheikh and co-accused Abdul Wazid. It is alleged in the chargesheet that when her husband was arrested she had faked identity
to visit him in judicial custody and had passed on instructions to
the members of the syndicate.
14.

It is alleged in the charge-sheet that neither accused

person could explain the heavy cash flow recorded in the various
bank accounts. That when arrested, Sharafat Sheikh was heavily
armed with unauthorized weapons.

The charge-sheet discloses

the details of 25 FIRs in which Sharafat Sheikh is an accused. It is

Bail Application No.164/2007

Page No.9 of 12

further stated in the charge-sheet that neither property holder
could disclose the source of funds to acquire the properties.
15.

Shri Harjinder Singh, learned senior counsel urged that

as held by the Supreme Court in the decision reported as JT 2007
(3) SC 466 State of Maharashtra vs. Lalit Somdatta Nagpal & Ors.,
2005 (2) JCC 689 Ranjitsingh Brahmajeet Sharma vs. State of
Maharashtra & Anr. and the Division Bench of the Bombay High
Court reported as 2000 All. M.R. (Cri.) 1061 Bharat Shantilal Shah
vs. State of Maharashtra sine qua non for taking action under
MCOCA was the allegation that the accused was a member of an
organized crime syndicate as defined under Section 2(1)(f) and
that the syndicate was indulging in organized crime as defined
under Section 2(1)(e) and that the organized crime related to
continuing antisocial activity as defined under Section 2(1)(d).
Learned senior counsel urged that petitioner was an accused only
in 3 FIRs. 2 out of the 3 related to her feud with the first wife of
her husband.

That there was no material to show that the

petitioner was a member of an organized crime syndicate or was
involved in an organized crime.
16.

I need not note the 3 decisions of the Supreme Court

relied upon by learned senior counsel for the petitioner for the
reason charge-sheet presented against the petitioner seeks to
prosecute her for the offence not under Section 3 of MCOCA but
under Section 4 thereof.
Bail Application No.164/2007

Page No.10 of 12

17.

Section 3 of MCOCA is attracted when it is alleged that

a person has committed an organized crime or is a member of an
organized crime syndicate.

Section 4 is attracted when it is

alleged that the accused is in possession of movable or
immovable property on behalf of members of an organized crime
syndicate which the accused cannot satisfactorily account for.
18.

A meaningful reading of the charge-sheet shows that

the case of the prosecution against the petitioner is of holding
properties on behalf of members of an organized crime syndicate,
acquisition of which property has not been satisfactorily explained
by the petitioner.
19.

To attract Section 4 of MCOCA, prima facie, 2 things

have to be alleged.

Firstly, that there is an organized crime

syndicate and secondly that the accused person is possessing
movable or immovable property on behalf of the members of the
organized crime syndicate and has not been able to satisfactorily
explain the same.
20.

As noted herein above, there are allegations in the

charge-sheet and documents have been filed along therewith
evidencing flow of funds from the accounts of the petitioner to the
account of members alleged to be indulged in organized crime.
There are allegations, with documents in support thereof,
evidencing funds provided from the accounts of the petitioner for
acquisition of assets by the alleged members of the organized
Bail Application No.164/2007

Page No.11 of 12

crime syndicate.

There are allegations of funds flowing to the

accounts of the petitioner from the accounts of the alleged
members of the syndicate with further linkage of acquisition of
assets by the petitioner from said funds.
21.

There is prima facie material to infer that the petitioner

is possessing movable and immovable property on behalf of
members of an organized crime syndicate.
22.

In this connection it would be relevant to note that in

approximately 22 years, husband of the petitioner who is involved
in as many as 25 FIRs has acquired assets worth crores. Video
films pertaining to his residence, presented as a piece of evidence
along with the charge-sheet reveals the opulent lifestyle. Neither
petitioner nor her husband have been able to render any
satisfactory explanation justifying the acquisition of the assets.
23.

No case is made out to release the petitioner on bail.

24.

The petition is dismissed.
