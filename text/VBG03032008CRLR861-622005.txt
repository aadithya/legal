V.B. GUPTA, J.
The present petition has been filed under Section
397/401 read with Section 482 Cr.P.C. by the petitioners
for setting aside summoning order dated 5 th August, 2005
passed by learned Magistrate and also for quashing of
proceedings arising out of complaint case No.1016/2004
titled as “Indukant Dixit vs. M.K.Razdan & Anr.” under
Sections 211/463/464/465/469 and 471 IPC, pending in the
court of Magistrate.
2.

The brief facts of this case are that respondent No.2,

Indukant Dixit has filed the above mentioned complaint
case against the present petitioners in the court of
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 2 of 36

Magistrate on the allegations that he is employee of Press
Trust of India (PTI) and is currently working as a Reporter
PTI-Bhasha posted at Jammu.

Petitioner No.1 is the

General Manager/CEO/ Editor-in-chief of the Press Trust of
India and petitioner No.2, Ms.Padma Alva is the Regional
Manager (North) in Press Trust of India.
3.

Respondent No.2 is a member of PTI Employees’

Union Delhi and takes active interest in its activity. In
January, 2001, respondent No.2 won the election and
became the national councilor of Federation of PTI
Employees Union and he raised bona fide demands of the
employees and also protested against the autocratic style
of functioning of petitioner No.1.

Ever since respondent

No.2, started actively participating in the Trade Union
activities and raised his voice in protest against the
petitioner, the petitioner in collusion with M.S.Yadav, the
Joint Secretary of the Federation of PTI Employees Union,
started targeting, harassing, victimizing respondent No.2
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 3 of 36

on the one pretext or other with a view to compel him to
leave the organisation.

Later on, petitioners in collusion

and connivance with Ms.Ekta Thani, falsely implicated
respondent No.2 in the matter of sexual harassment of
Ms.Ekta Thani and respondent No.2 started getting show
cause letters on one false ground or the other. Petitioners
1 & 2 made the life of respondent No.2 worse than hell and
started harassing and victimizing and pressuring him by
leveling false charges on him, so that he leave the
organization.
4.

On July 10, 2001, Ms.Ekta Thani made a false written

complaint in collusion and connivance with the petitioners
against respondent No.2 and two other female colleagues
namely Ms.Kavita Pant and Ms.Sujata Mathur that they
used

derogatory

statements

against

her

and

passed

insulting remarks against her. Petitioner No.2 issued show
cause notice only to respondent No.2 charging him with
sexual harassment of Ms.Ekta Thani. Later on, petitioner
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 4 of 36

No.1 charge sheeted respondent No.2 with the charges of
sexual harassment of Ms.Ekta Thani and other two
charges. It is important to mention that charge of sexual
harassment was not even made by Ms.Ekta Thani herself.
5.

The petitioner with the help of enquiry officer

Mr.Shakeel Ahmed, got respondent No.2 declared guilty of
the charges of sexual harassment.
No.1

could

not

dismiss

However, petitioner

respondent

No.2

due

to

overwhelming support of the employees in favour of
respondent No.2.

Respondent No.2 was later on elected

General Secretary of the Federation of PTI Employees’
Union and later on petitioner No.1 vide office order dated
August 29, 2002 malafidely transferred respondent No.2 to
Jammu as a Reporter in PTI-Bhasha. The office order was
read in the presence of the employees and it was
mentioned in the office order dated August 29, 2002 that
after considering the representation of respondent No.2
and personal hearing, it was decided to take a lenient view
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 5 of 36

and not to impose the penalty of dismissal and instead the
respondent No.2 promotion to the next grade will be
withheld for year after it became due and it was also stated
that respondent No.2 is transferred to Jammu.

On the

same day, when respondent No.2 came back to his house,
he opened the envelope to read the transfer letter dated
August 29, 2002, and was surprised and shocked to read
about the mentioning of a false letter dated August 23,
2002.

Respondent No.2 never wrote any letter dated

August 23, 2002 to petitioner No.1 nor he had any personal
meeting with him after August 23, 2002. He immediately
contacted petitioner No.1 and asked him how and why
these false facts have been mentioned in this letter.
Petitioner No.1 clarified that it was a typing mistake and
instead of August 13, 2002, August 23, 2002 got typed and
that in place of preceding personal hearing, subsequent
personal hearing got typed.

Respondent No.2 must not

doubt the intention of petitioner No.1.

Respondent No.2

innocently believed his clarification.
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 6 of 36

6.

Before moving to Jammu to join duties, respondent

No. 2 filed a criminal complaint for defamation against
Ms.Ekta Thani and that matter is pending.
7.

On September 2, 2002, respondent No.2 reported for

duty at Jammu and in his reporting letter he made the
endorsement that the transfer order from Delhi to Jammu
was only meant for covering the Jammu and Kashmir State
Assembly Election, 2002 but later on petitioners cheated
respondent No.2 by not calling him back. Even after
malafidely

transferring

respondent

No.2

to

Jammu,

petitioners did not stop their victimizing attitude and till
date, on the one pretext or the other, they issued false
show cause notices and charge sheet to respondent No.2.
8.

On January 22, 2003, petitioner No.1 made a written

complaint to the SHO, P.S. Greater Kailash-I, with the
intention to cause injury to respondent No.2 falsely
charged him with having committed an offence of criminal
intimidation to terrorise him, his family members and
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 7 of 36

others knowing fully well that there was no just or lawful
ground for such charge against respondent No.2 because
on January 22, 2003, respondent No.2 was physically
present at Jammu and was performing his duties there. On
the basis of this false complaint, petitioner No.1 got an
F.I.R. lodged against respondent No.2 and others and by
doing so, petitioner No.1 has committed offence punishable
under Section 211 IPC.
9.

In the month of April, 2003, respondent No.2 came to

know through Mr.Neelkanth Paratkar a close associate of
respondent No.2 and who was illegally dismissed from the
services of PTI on account of his trade union activities, that
in his personal case, titled as Neelkanth Paratkar vs. PTI
Management, for

reinstatement, petitioners have filed a

photocopy of letter dated August 23, 2002 stating that this
letter was written by respondent No.2 to petitioner No.1
and the management falsely claimed before the labour
court of Mumbai for their own illegal benefit, to support
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 8 of 36

their claim against Mr.Neelkanth Paratkar in this case
where the photocopy of this false document was placed on
record, that respondent No.2 had written this letter dated
August 23, 2002 to petitioner No.1.

Respondent No.2

never wrote any such letter to petitioner No.1. The letter
dated 23 August, 2002 is a false and forged document and
petitioners had made this false document with intention to
cause damage/injury to respondent No.2 to support their
own claim and by doing so they have committed the
offences under Sections 463/464 IPC punishable under
Section 465 IPC.
10.

The petitioner have made this false and forged

document and they have tried to make the labour court,
Mumbai believe that, this letter was made/executed by
respondent No.2 knowing fully well, that respondent No.2
never wrote any such letter.

The petitioner committed

forgery with the intention that the document forged by
them shall harm the reputation of respondent No.2. They
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 9 of 36

fraudulently

used

this

forged

document

as

genuine,

knowing very well that the letter/document dated August
23, 2002 was a forged document and by doing so the
petitioners have committed offence under Sections 469/471
IPC.
11.

The petitioners have also placed on record the

photocopy of this forged letter before the Conciliation
Officer, Jammu in the matter of “Indukant Dixit vs. PTI
management” in May, 2003 and by doing so have
committed offences under Sections 463, 464, 465, 469 and
471 IPC.
12.

It is further stated by respondent No.2 in his

complaint, that on April 14, 2003, he submitted an
application in the office at Jammu addressing petitioner
No.1 for medical leave from 6th April, 2003 to 13th April,
2003 and the same was supported by the original medical
certificate issued by Dr. S. Chakraborty. On 10th May,

Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 10 of 36

2003, respondent No.2 was surprised to receive a show
cause notice from petitioner No.2.

Petitioner No.2 in

collusion and connivance with petitioner No.1, charged
respondent No.2 of submitting a false medical certificate
under a false name making a false representation of facts
for the period of April 5, 2003 to April 12, 2003. Petitioner
No.2 alleged that the medical certificate was issued for Ms.
Indukant Dixit.

Respondent No.2 was surprised to read

these allegations because he had submitted a genuine
certificate. He gave reply to the show cause notice vide
letter dated May 23, 2003 and also enclosed the photocopy
of the original medical certificate. The petitioners did not
specifically reply to the letter dated May 23, 2003 of
respondent No.2 but deliberately with mala fide intention
to harass him, deducted his salary for the period from April
5, 2003 to April 12, 2003 even when medical leave
application and original leave certificates were submitted
to him.

Respondent No.2 had no alternative but to file

In the petition seeking quashing of the summoning

order as well as proceedings arising of the complaint case
pending in the Court of Magistrate, it has been stated by
the Petitioners that the summoning order has been passed
in

a

casual

and

perfunctory

application of mind.

manner

without

due

Entire case of respondent no.2 is

based on mis-representation and concealment of facts. The
present petitioners have been falsely implicated in this
case.

The complaint filed by respondent no.2 is a clear

case of vendetta without any just reason or basis as
respondent no.2 is attempting to force and pressurize
petitioners to allow him to work in the company on his own
terms and conditions.

No expert evidence has been

brought on record and no attempt was made to prove
document in question i.e. letter dated 23rd August, 2002
was created or forged and alterations were made in the
medical certificate by the petitioners. Mere statement of
respondent No.2 and statement of witnesses would not be
sufficient to prove the basic ingredient of offence under
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 13 of 36

Section 471 IPC.

In order to prove forgery, original

document is the best evidence but the same has not been
placed before the Court of Magistrate. Besides, the case of
respondent no.2 is user of alleged forged documents in
Mumbai and hence Delhi Courts have no jurisdiction to try
the said offence.

Further, the handwriting expert has

opined that there are no significant differences between
the disputed signatures on the document and standard
signatures and writing of respondent no.2.
15.

Respondent no.2 did not approach the Court with

clean hands which is evident from the fact that he was
arrested on 5th April, 2003 in FIR No.76/2003 and was
remanded to judicial custody.

Respondent no.2 was

admitted on bail vide order dated 8th April, 2003 passed by
Additional

Session

Judge,

Delhi.

Under

these

circumstances, the submission of application for medical
leave from 6th April, 2003 to 12th April, 2003 supported by a
medical

certificate

Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

by

respondent

no.2

was

a

false

page 14 of 36

representation of the facts before the Magistrate and there
is no evidence to connect the petitioners with the act of
creation of forged documents and using the same as
genuine and as such impugned summoning order and the
consequent proceedings arising out of the complaint case
pending in the Court of Magistrate may be quashed.
16.

In reply to this petition filed on behalf of respondent

no.2 it is stated that the impugned summoning order
passed is legal and appropriate and there is no infirmity or
illegality. The respondent no.2 had prima-facie, proved the
basic

ingredients

petitioners.

of

the

offence

committed

by

the

At the stage of issuance of the process, the

offence is not to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and
only a prima-facie case has to be proved.

Further,

whatever plea which have been taken by the petitioners in
the petition they are their defence and question of defence
is a matter of trial.

Under these circumstances, the

impugned summoning order is legal and there is not
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 15 of 36

infirmity in it and the same has been passed after due
application of mind and as such the present petition is
liable to be dismissed.
17.

It is not in dispute that civil as well as criminal

litigations have been pending between the Management of
Press Trust of India and Employee Union of Pressing Trust
of India. This fact has to be taken into consideration while
dealing with the present case.
18.

Since the present petition has been filed under

Section 482 Cr.P.C., it is well settled that this Court should
not, except in extraordinary circumstances exercise its
jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C., so as to quash the
prosecution proceedings after they have been launched.
The power of quashing a criminal proceedings should be
exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that
too in the rarest of rare cases; the Court will not be
justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability
or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the

not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the Court to act
according to its whim or caprice.
19.

In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Cr LJ 527

a two judge Bench of Apex Court considered the statutory
provisions and the earlier decisions of the Court and held
that in the following categories of cases the extraordinary
power under Art. 226 or the inherent powers under S.482
Cr.P.C., can be exercised by the High Court either to
prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to
secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to
lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently
channelized and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and
to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein
such power should be exercised:
(1)

Where the allegations made in the first
information report or the complaint, even if they
are taken at their face value and accepted in
their face value and accepted in their entirety do
not prima facie constitute any offence or make
out a case against the accused.

Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 17 of 36

(2)

Where the allegations in the first information
report and other materials, if any, accompanying
the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence,
justifying an investigation by police officers
under Section 156(1) of the Code except under
an order of a Magistrate within the purview of
Section 155(2) of the Code.

(3)

Where the uncontroverted allegations made in
the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected
in support of the same do not disclose the
commission of any offence and make out a case
against the accused.

(4)

Where, the allegations in the FIR do not
constitute a cognizable offence but constitute
only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation
is permitted by a police officer without an order
of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section
155(2) of the Code.

(5)

Where the allegations made in the FIR or
complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent
person can ever reach a just conclusion that
there is sufficient grounds for proceeding
against the accused.

(6)

Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in
any of the provisions of the Code or the
concerned Act (under which a criminal
proceeding is instituted) to the institution and

Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 18 of 36

continuance of the proceedings and/or where
there is a specific provision in the Code or the
concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for
the grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7)

20.

Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly
attended with mala fide and/or where the
proceeding is maliciously instituted with an
ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the
accused and with a view to spite him due to
private and personal grudge.

Keeping in view the proposition of law laid down in

Bhajan Lal’s case, it is to seen as to whether, it is a fit case
where this Court should exercise it power under Section
482 Cr.P.C. or not.
21.

In the entire complaint, no specific allegation have

been made against petitioner no.2 as to how she has
committed the alleged criminal offences for which the
present

complaint

has

been

filed

in

the

Court

of

Magistrate.

Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 19 of 36

22.

During the course of arguments, learned counsel for

respondent no.2, could not point out any specific allegation
attributing any role to petitioner no.2, with regard to the
commission of criminal offences.
23.

As per avements made in the complaint case, in July,

2001, one Ekta Thani has allegedly made a false written
complaint in collusion and connivance with the present
petitioners against respondent no.2 and

petitioner no.2

issued a show cause notice to respondent no.2 and later on
petitioner no.1 charged sheeted respondent no.2 of sexual
harassment of Ms. Ekta Thani and petitioners falsely
implicated the respondent no.2 in that case.
24.

It has been further alleged that after inquiry they

could not dismiss respondent no.2, but they could simply
transfer him.
25.

These allegations made in the present complaint,

have no connection with the present offences as alleged in
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 20 of 36

the complaint.
26.

Next

allegation

is

that

respondent

no.2

was

transferred to Jammu vide transfer order dated August, 29,
2002 and in this order, there is mentioning of a false letter
dated August 23, 2002 which talks about reference of
personal hearing before petitioner no.1. So, admittedly, no
allegations has been made against petitioner no.2 and this
document does not concern petitioner no.2 at all.
27.
22nd

Other allegation made by respondent no.2 is that, on
January,

2003,

petitioner

no.1

made

a

written

complaint to SHO, P.S. Greater Kailash which was a false
complaint and thus petitioner no.1 has committed offence
punishable under Section 211 IPC.
28.

So, admittedly, there is no allegation qua, petitioner

no.2.
29.

The only allegation made against petitioner no.2 is

that she in collusion and connivance with petitioner no.1
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 21 of 36

charged respondent no.2 of submitting a false medical
certificate

under

a

false

name

making

a

false

representation of the facts, for the period April 5, 2003 to
April 12, 2003. So, the only role attributed in the entire
criminal complaint against respondent no.2 is that, she had
issued a false show cause notice dated 10th May, 2003 to
respondent no.2.
30.

No finding has been given by any authority till date

that the show cause notice dated 10th May, 2003 issued by
petitioner no.2 to respondent no.2 is a false. The grievance
of respondent no.2 is that petitioner no.2 has alleged that
the medical certificate was issued for “Ms. Indukant Dixit”
which is a wrong fact and respondent no.2, has been
wrongly

charged

with

submitting

a

false

medical

certificate. According to respondent no.2, petitioners have
been dishonestly altered medical certificate dated April 12,
2003 and they have made a false/forged document and had
committed forgery.
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 22 of 36

31.

There is nothing on record to show that it is petitioner

no.2 who has dishonestly altered the medical certificate
dated April 12, 2003 and have made a false/forged
document and had committed forgery.
32.

So, after going through the entire complaint case,

filed by respondent no.2 in the Court of Magistrate, it
shows that no allegation has been made against petitioner
no.2, which even prima-facie, may shows that she has
committed any offence under Sections 211, 463, 464, 465,
469 and 471 of IPC.
33.

Under these circumstances, the criminal complaint

filed against petitioner no.2 is not maintainable and the
impugned summoning order dated 5th August, 2005 passed
against petitioner no.2 is liable to be quashed.
34.

As far as the case of petitioner no.1 is concerned,

prima-facie, it is to be seen as to whether this petitioner
has also committed any criminal offence as alleged in the
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 23 of 36

complaint or not.
35.

Regarding commission of offence under Section 211

IPC alleged to have been committed by petitioner no.1 is
concerned, it has been alleged in the complaint that on
January 22, 2003 petitioner no.1 made a written complaint
to S.H.O. P.S. Greater Kailash, with the intention to cause
injury to respondent no.2, falsely charged him with having
committed an offence of criminal intimidation to terrorize
him, his family members and others knowing very well that
there was no just or lawful ground for such charge against
him because on January, 22 2003 the respondent was
physically present at Jammu and was performing his duty
as a Reporter PTI–Bhasha.

On the basis of this false

complaint and high level contacts which petitioner no.1
had in the administration, he even got an FIR lodged
against respondent no.2 and others bearing no.9/2003, P.S.
Greater

kailash.

By

doing

so,

petitioner

no.1

has

committed offence punishable under Section 211 IPC.

Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 24 of 36

36.

Section 211 IPC reads as under:“False charge of offence made with intent to
injure.- Whoever, with intent to cause injury to
any person, institutes or causes to be instituted
any criminal proceeding against that person, or
falsely charges any person with having
committed an offence, knowing that there is no
just or lawful ground for such proceeding or
charge against that person, shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to two years, or with
fine, or with both;
and if such criminal proceeding be instituted on
a false charge of an offence punishable with
death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for
seven years or upwards, shall be punishable with
imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to seven years, and shall also
be liable to fine.”

37.

A bare reading of this Section would show that there

has to be “false charge of offence made with intention to
cause injuries to any person”. Mere filing of an FIR against
any person cannot be said to be institution of criminal
proceedings against that person, unless the FIR is found to
be false. Here, in the present case though petitioner no.1
had made a complaint dated 22nd January, 2003 to the

Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 25 of 36

SHO, P.S. Greater Kailash, New Delhi but no FIR on the
basis of this complaint of petitioner no.1 was registered.
38.

On the other hand, as per copy of the FIR No.9/2003

which has been placed on record, the complainant is
constable Nandlal. So, FIR No.9/2003 has not been lodged
by petitioner no.1 at all and all the averments made in this
FIR has been recorded at the instance of constable
Nandlal.
39.

There is also nothing on record to show as to what

happened in that case in which FIR No.9/2003 has been
lodged; whether that case is still pending or the same has
been decided. There is no finding of any Court on record
that in those criminal proceedings, false charges have been
made against respondent no.2 or the FIR has been found to
be false.
40.

Under these circumstances, there is no question of

petitioner no.1 committing any offence under Section 211
IPC.
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 26 of 36

41.

With regard to the allegations under Section 463/464

punishable under Section 465 IPC, the case of respondent
no.2 is that petitioners have made false document dated
August 23, 2002 with the intention to cause damage/injury
to respondent no 2 to support their own claim and have
also placed a photocopy of this forged and false letter
before the Conciliation Officer, Jammu in the matter of
Indukant Dixit vs. PTI management in May, 2003 and by
doing so have committed offences under Sections 463, 464,
465, 469 and 471 IPC also.

43.

Respondent no.2 has nowhere stated in the entire

complaint where the original of letter dated August 23,
2002 is available. In the entire complaint, respondent no.2
has referred about the photocopy of this document only.

Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 29 of 36

44.

According to the respondent no.2, the photocopy of

this document was placed by petitioner no.1 before the
labour Court of Mumbai as well as before the Conciliation
Officer, Jammu. There is nothing on record to show that
any such document was placed by petitioner no.1 before
the Labour Court of Mumbai or before the Conciliation
Officer, Jammu nor that record has been summoned or
proved by respondent No.2 at the time of his presummoning evidence.
45.

When neither original document nor its certified copy

is either before this Court or the trial court, I fail to
understand as to how a finding can be given by any Court
that

petitioner

no.1

has

committed

forgery

of

this

document or had made a false document.
46.

Under these circumstances, ingredient of Sections

463/464/465/469 and 471 of IPC are not attracted in this
case at all.

Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 30 of 36

47.

The last allegation against petitioner No.1 is that on

May 10, 2003, respondent no.2 was surprised and shocked
to receive a show cause notice from petitioner no.2.
Petitioner no.1 in collusion and connivance with petitioner
no.1 charged respondent no.2 of submitting a false medical
certificate

under

a

false

name

making

a

false

representation of fact for the period of April 5, 2003 to
April 12, 2003.

Petitioner No.2 has alleged that the

medical certificate was issued for Ms. Indukant Dixit.
48.

As per the case of respondent no.2, on April 14, 2003,

he had submitted an application in the office at Jammu
addressing petitioner No.1 for medical leave from April 6,
2003 to April 13, 2003. The said application was supported
by

the

original

S.Chakraborty.

medical

certificate

issued

by

Dr.

Respondent no.2 was surprised and

shocked to see that petitioners had forged and fabricated
his medical certificate dated April 12, 2003 and had placed
photocopy of his medical certificate on record after forging

Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 31 of 36

the same, as in the original medical certificate, the doctor
had not struck off either Mr./Ms./Mrs.

The photocopy of

forged medical certificate which is placed on record by
petitioners show Mr. and Mrs. as struck off and it seems
that medical certificate is issued in the name of Ms.
Indukant Dixit.

Thus, without the lawful authority,

petitioners had dishonestly altered the document i.e. the
medical certificate dated April 12, 2003 in a material way,
after it was submitted by respondent no.2 and by doing so,
petitioners have made a false/forged document and have
committed forgery and they have committed offence under
Section 463/464 punishable under Section 465 IPC.
49.

According to respondent no.2, he had submitted a

genuine Medical Certificate.
50.

In the present case, it would be pertinent to point out

that respondent no.2 had been arrested in case FIR
No.76/2003, under Section 506 and 341/34 IPC, P.S.
Parliament Street, New Delhi and as per certified copy of
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 32 of 36

the bail order placed on record in this case, he was
arrested in that case on 5th April, 2003 and was bailed out
on 8th April, 2003. The bail order is reproduced as under:“State vs. 1. Indukant Dixit
2. J.S. Rawat
FIR No. 76/2003
P.S. Parliament Street
U.S. 506 & 341/34 IPC.
8/4/2003
Present: Ld. Addl. P.P. for the State.
Counsel for the applicant.
The applicants were arrested on 5.4.2003 and
are in custody since then. They have allegedly
committed the offence under Section 506 as well
as 341 of IPC in course of their activities as
Members of PTI Employees Union. There are
two other cases against the applicants of the
same nature. The complainant PTI Management
has already been protected by an order of the
Hon’ble High Court of Delhi restraining the
Union from carrying out any Union activity
within 50 metres of the Office of the
Management. The applicants be released on a
bond of Rs.25,000/- with one surety each in the
like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial
court/link MM/duty MM subject to the condition
that in case they are found violating the order of
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 33 of 36

injunction passed by the Hon’ble High Court the
current bail order will be liable to be cancelled.
A.S.J. New Delhi”
51.

So, admittedly, respondent no.2 was in judicial

custody in Delhi w.e.f. 5th April, 2003 to 8th April, 2003.
However,

the

alleged

medical

certificate

which

is

purported to have forged by the present petitioners is for
the period from 5th April, 2003 to 12th April, 2003. I fail to
understand as to how medical certificate for this period has
been obtained by respondent no.2 and was submitted in his
office, when admittedly he was in judicial custody.
52.

Naturally, when respondent no.2 was in judicial

custody and for that period when he had sent a medical
leave application to his office then, the petitioners were
fully justified in issuing show cause notice to make enquiry
into this matter.
53.

It is clear that after getting show cause notice,

respondent no.2 as a counter blast has filed the present
complaint alleging that the medical certificate has been
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 34 of 36

forged by the petitioners.

The best witness to depose

about the medical certificate as to whether it is a forged or
genuine one is Dr. S. Chakraborty who has issued the
medical certificate but his statement has not been recorded
till date.

Only he can state as to which is the original

certificate

and

which

one

is

the

forged

certificate.

Moreover, this medical certificate does not even bear the
signatures of respondent no.2.
54.

Under these circumstances, it is patently clear that

respondent no.2 has filed this criminal complaint before
the Court of Magistrate as a counter blast so as to escape
his prosecution for submitting an allegedly false medical
certificate during the course of his service.
55.

So, keeping in view the principles laid down in Bhajan

Lal’s case, the allegations made in the complaint even if
they are taken at their face value and accepted in its entity
do not prima-facie constitute any offence against any of the
petitioners.
Crl.Rev.P.No.861-62/2005

page 35 of 36

56.

Under these circumstances, the present petition is

allowed and the summoning order dated 5th August, 2005
passed by learned Magistrate is set aside and the
proceedings pending in the complaint case, as mentioned
above stands quashed.
57.

Trial court record be sent back forthwith.
