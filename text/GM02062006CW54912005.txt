1.

This petition is yet another instance of the tardiness exhibited by the

Delhi Transport Corporation in prosecution of its litigation impacting on the
rights of its workman.

WP (C) No.5491/2005

One Shri Umed Singh, respondent herein, was

Page No.1

employed by the petitioner as a security havaldar. On allegations that he
entered into a fight with another security guard on 4th November, 1991, he
was charge-sheeted on 15th November, 1991 with allegations of misconduct
under Para 19(g) & (m) of the D.R.T.A. (Condition of Appointment &
Service ) Regulations, 1952.
2.

The petitioner claims to have conducted a disciplinary inquiry against

the respondent/workman which culminated in an order of removal from
service dated 25th March, 1992. As the respondent was the concerned
workman in an industrial reference bearing I.D. No.17 of 1998, the DTC
sought approval of the disciplinary action taken and the order passed by it,
by way of application under Section 33(2)(b) of the statute before the
Industrial Tribunal which petition was registered as OP No.130/1992.
3.

On the 23rd September, 1996, as the DTC failed to pay the costs which

were imposed on the DTC on the previous date, the industrial tribunal
dismissed OP No.130/1992 on account of non-payment of costs.
4.

The petitioner assailed the order passed by the industrial tribunal in a

writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India being WP (C)
No. 130/1999. This writ petition was allowed in favour of the petitioner by
an order dated 5th February, 2004 whereby the court held thus:WP (C) No.5491/2005

Page No.2

“The Petitioner is aggrieved by an order dated 23rd
September, 1996 passed by the learned Industrial Tribunal in
OP No.130/1992.
By the impugned order, the approval application filed
by the petitioner was dismissed on the grounds the costs have
not been paid.
Learned counsel for the parties are agreed that now, in
view of the decision of a Division Bench of this Court in
Delhi Transport Corporation Vs. Hari Narain Giri & Anr.
LPA No.480/2000 decided on 7th February, 2002, nonpayment of costs is not a ground for dismissal of the
approval application.
Under the circumstances, the order dated 23rd
September, 1996 has to be set aside. It is ordered
accordingly.
The parties will appear before the learned Industrial
Tribunal on 23rd February, 2004. The approval application
will be taken up for consideration from the proceedings of
23rd September, 1996.
It is made clear that while passing the final order, the
learned industrial Tribunal will take into consideration the
conduct of the parties including the conduct of the Petitioner
in challenging the order dated 23rd September, 1996 by filing
a writ petition in this Court on 2nd January, 1999, that is, after
a delay of over two years.
In view of the inconvenience and hardship caused to
the Respondent/workman, even though the writ petition is
being allowed, the Petitioner will pay costs of Rs.15,000/- to
the Respondent/workman. The learned Industrial Tribunal
will take up the case only after costs are paid to the
Respondent/workman.”
5.

It is noteworthy that this court had directed the industrial tribunal to

take into consideration the conduct of the parties including the conduct of

WP (C) No.5491/2005

Page No.3

the petitioner in filing the writ petition after a delay of two years of the
dismissal of its approval application. It is also noteworthy that the court had
recorded that the industrial tribunal would take up the case only after the
costs were paid to the workman.
6.

After waiting for a reasonable period of over four months for the DTC

to take appropriate action in the matter, the respondent/workman had also
filed writ petition being WP (C) No.1751/1998 entitled Umed Singh Vs.
Delhi Transport Corporation under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
Shri Umed Singh, workman in this writ petition, disclosed the fact that the
application of the DTC under Section 33 (2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 stood rejected and consequently prayed for a direction to the DTC
to reinstate the workman in service with continuity of service and full back
wages. In view of the order dated 5th February, 2004 which was passed in
the writ petition filed by the DTC being WP (C) No.13/1999 remanding the
matter for fresh consideration to the industrial tribunal, the writ petition filed
by the respondent/workman being WP (C) No.1751/1998 was dismissed as
having been rendered infructuous.
7.

The DTC failed to appear before the industrial tribunal on the 23rd

February, 2004 despite the directions by this court. The DTC also failed to
WP (C) No.5491/2005

Page No.4

pay the costs which were paid before the hearing on the 23rd February, 2004
to the workman. In these circumstances, the industrial tribunal postponed
consideration of the matter to 3rd March, 2004. On the 3rd March, 2004, the
petitioner had appeared before the industrial tribunal but still failed to pay
the costs which were imposed to it by this court. The matter was therefore
adjourned to 10th March, 2004. The DTC failed to tender conditional costs
of Rs.15,000/- to the respondent/workman even in the hearing on the 10th
March, 2004. In these circumstances, after noticing the conduct of the DTC
before the Tribunal after the orders passed by this court, the industrial
tribunal was of the view that vide the order dated 5 th February, 2004, it had
been directed to take up this application only if costs are paid and that if the
same are not paid, no proceedings would take place.

The application was

disposed of accordingly and the matter consigned to record room.
8.

More than a month thereafter, the DTC filed an application dated 12 th

April, 2004 before the industrial tribunal submitting that the DTC had
prepared a cheque on the 19th March, 2004 which was sent to its advocate
on 25th March, 2004 but could not be paid as the petition stood dismissed
prior thereto on 10th March, 2004. The DTC prayed for setting aside of the
order passed on 10th March, 2004. This application was dismissed by the
WP (C) No.5491/2005

Page No.5

industrial tribunal by an order passed on 21st April, 2004 on the observation
that the order had been passed in terms of the orders of the High Court and
in the presence of the authorised representative of the DTC.
9.

In view of the order dated 10th March, 2004 passed by the industrial

tribunal finally disposing of the application of the DTC under Section
33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the workman filed an
application being CM No.7978/2004 in WP (C) No.1751/1998 seeking
revival of the writ petition as the application of the DTC stood rejected
seeking recall of the order dated 5th February, 2004.
10.

This application was listed before the court on 25th August, 2004.

None appeared on behalf of the DTC despite service. Accordingly, CM
No.7978/2004 was allowed and the order dated 5th February, 2004 disposing
of the writ petition as infructuous, was recalled. So far as the main petition
was concerned, in WP (C) No.1751/1998 the court held that since the order
dated 10th March, 2004 had not been challenged by the respondent, hence
the respondent/workman was deemed to be in continuous service and is
entitled to duties. Accordingly, by the order dated 25th August, 2004, the
court directed Shri Umed Singh, workman to report for duty to the Deputy
CGM (PM), DTC Headquarters, I.P. Estate, New Delhi on the 31st August,
WP (C) No.5491/2005

Page No.6

2004 at 10.00 A.M. so that he could be assigned duties w.e.f. 1st September,
2004.
11.

There is no dispute that the respondent/workman reported for duties in

terms of the order of this court and was taken back on the rolls and assigned
duties by the DTC in compliance of the order dated 25 th August, 2004. The
order of the court has attained finality in as much as no appeal impugning
the same was even filed by the petitioner. This order in any case stands duly
implemented
12.

After effectuating the order passed by this court holding that the

workman was in continuous service, the DTC has filed the present writ
petition on 13th January, 2004. This was more than six months after the
dismissal of its application under Section 33(2)(b) of the I.D. Act, 1947 and
more than three months after effecting reinstatement into service of the
respondent on the 31st August, 2004. In this writ petition, the petitioner has
assailed the order dated 23st April, 2004 passed in O.P. No.130/1992. The
petitioner has based this writ petition primarily on the plea that it has never
been heard on the merits of its application under Section 33(2)(b) of the
statute and that the order dated 21st April, 2004 was not sustainable in the
light of the principles laid down by a Division Bench of this court in LPA
WP (C) No.5491/2005

Page No.7

No.480/2000 entitled Delhi Transport Corporation Vs. Hari Narain Giri &
Anr. decided on 7th February, 2002 on the principle that non-payment of
costs would not be a ground for dismissal of the approval application.
13.

Mr. Raman Kapur, learned counsel appearing for the respondent, has

vehemently opposed the writ petition contending that the writ petition
deserves to be rejected on the sole ground of unexplained delay and laches.
It is further contended that by the order passed on 25 th August, 2004, the
writ petition of the workman was allowed. The petitioner has not assailed
the order dated 25th August, 2004 which was passed in these proceedings in
favour of the respondent and that the said order has become final and
binding on all the parties. It is, further, contended that the respondent,
having been reinstated into service, his rights cannot be jeopardized at the
whims of the DTC which has failed to take action in accordance with law.
14.

I have heard learned counsel for the parties. There can be no manner

of doubt that in the instant case, the petitioner has acted with utmost
negligence and casualness.

It failed to file affidavits in support of its

application under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
When, after being given several opportunities, adjournment was granted on
payment of conditional costs, the DTC not only failed to pay the costs but
WP (C) No.5491/2005

Page No.8

still did not file the affidavit, the order dated 23rd December, 1996 was
passed.
15.

After its dismissal, the DTC waited for over two years upto 2 nd

January, 1999 when it filed a writ petition being WP (C) No.13/1999
impugning the order dated 23rd September, 1996. In view of the position in
law and the judgment relied upon by the DTC, this court had no option but
to set aside the order dated 23rd September, 1996 and remand the matter to
the industrial tribunal to reconsider the matter from the proceedings of 23rd
September, 1996. Costs were imposed which were directed to be paid
before the matter could be taken up by the industrial tribunal for further
consideration.
16.

The DTC failed to appear on the date which was appointed by this

court for appearance on 23rd February, 2004. Despite the matter being listed
again on 3rd March, 2004 and 10th March, 2004, the DTC still failed to pay
the costs. From the available record, it would appear, therefore, that there
was not only no evidence in support of the application under Section
33(2)(b) of the DTC but it also failed to comply with the specific directions
of this court to pay the costs which were awarded.

Undoubtedly, the

industrial tribunal was precluded by the order dated 5th February, 2004 from
WP (C) No.5491/2005

Page No.9

considering the application of the DTC without the costs having been paid,
as directed.
17.

In the meantime, yet another event intervened. The workman filed an

application for further proceedings in its WP (C) No.1751/1998. The DTC
in the carelessness manner in which it has pursued the instant case, did not
contest the same despite service. The application was allowed and in the
writ petition, the court granted the prayer of the workman for reinstatement
into service. Since the application of the DTC under Section 33(2)(b) stood
rejected, in view of the principles of law laid down in JT 2002 (1) SC 182
entitled Jaipur Zila Sahakari Bhoomi Bank Ltd. Vikas Vs. Shri Ram
Gopal Sharma, the order of termination of the services of the workman was
rendered nonest and illegal. As a consequence, the respondent/workman
became entitled to reinstatement into service. This court not only directed
the reinstatement but directed the workman to report to the DTC on the 31st
August, 2004 when DTC was required to assign him duties.
18.

No grievance was made by the DTC in respect of the order dated 25 th

August, 2004.

On the contrary, the DTC accepted its correctness and

reinstated the workman into service w.e.f. 31st August, 2004. Having so
acted, it would not lie open to the petitioner to contend that the order dated
WP (C) No.5491/2005

Page No.10

12th April, 2004 was illegal or that the DTC was entitled to a hearing on the
merits of its application under Section 33(2)(b) of the statute. As already
noticed above, the DTC has not filed any evidence in support thereof.
Furthermore, the respondent stands reinstated into service. The DTC not
only accepted the order dated 25th August, 2004 but waited more than three
months after reinstating the workman before filing the present writ petition.
19.

It is necessary to notice that the services of the respondent were

terminated by an order passed on 25th March, 1992.

From the negligent

manner in which the DTC has conducted its litigation, the workman was
compelled to litigate for a long period of almost 13 years till the passing of
the order dated 25th August, 2004. The DTC has accepted the correctness
thereof and consequently the workman has been reinstated into service.
There is no challenge whatsoever to the order dated 25th August, 2004
passed in WP (C) No.1751/1998.
20.

It has been repeatedly held that the writ jurisdiction still has not been

exercised merely because there is an error of law but deserves to be
exercised only in cases evidencing substantial injustice.

It was so held in

AIR 1955 SC 425 (Paras 13 & 14) Sangram Singh Vs. Election Tribunal,
Kotah & Another; AIR 1957 SC 227 (Para 17) A.M. Allison Vs. B.L. Sen;
WP (C) No.5491/2005

Page No.11

1982 (1) SCC 143 J.D. Jain Vs. Management of State Bank of India &
AIR 2000 SCC 1508 Indian Overseas Bank Vs. Indian Overseas Bank
Staff Canteen Workers' Union & Another.

In 1997 (1) SCC 134

Ramniklal N. Bhutta Vs. State of Maharashtra, the court held that a writ
would not issue merely on the making of a legal ground. In 1980 (4) SCC
379 SL Kapoor Vs. Jagmohan the court held that futile writs would not be
issued.
21.

In the instant case even if the present writ petition was allowed, and

the matter was remanded for consideration of the application of the DTC
under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, it would not be
possible to remove the respondent from service in as much as by an order
dated 25th August, 2004, this court has specifically directed reinstatement of
the respondent. The workman is in service by virtue of this order. The same
has not been assailed and has attained finality.
22.

For all the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that no further

opportunity can be granted to the DTC for consideration of its application
under Section 33(2)(b) of the I.D. Act, 1947. Despite repeated exercise of
judicial discretion in its favour, the DTC has failed to take any reasonable
steps within the stipulated time or in the manner they were required to be
WP (C) No.5491/2005

Page No.12

taken.
In this view of the matter, I find no merit in the writ petition which is
hereby dismissed.
The respondent/workman shall be entitled to the costs of the present
proceedings which are quantified at Rs.10,000/- to be paid within four
weeks.
