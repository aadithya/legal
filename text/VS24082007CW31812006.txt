1.
The Petitioner assails the order dated 2 nd February, 2006
passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New
Delhi (the Tribunal) in OA No. 1045/2005 whereby, the petitioner's
aforesaid OA was dismissed by the Tribunal. Before the Tribunal, the
Petitioner

had

assailed

the

order

passed

by

the

Additional

Commissioner of Income Tax, Ghaziabad, UP dated 11.7.2000
W.P(C) No. 3181/2006

Page 1 of 4

whereby, he had been disengaged w.e.f. 6.6.2000 along with 5
others.
2.

The

applicant

was

engaged

as

a

daily

wager

on

21.10.1994. He states that he had completed 206 days on duty as on
29.9.1995.
3.

It appears that on 6.6.2000, the petitioner was involved in

an incident which resulted in registration of a case under Section 34
of the Police Act against the petitioner. Ultimately, the petitioner was
acquitted by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghaziabad on
27.7.2000.

Consequent upon his acquittal, the petitioner filed the

aforesaid OA seeking reinstatement with all consequential benefits.
The contention of the petitioner was that 5 others, who had been
disengaged similarly as the petitioner, had since been re-engaged on
26.6.2000.

However,

the

petitioner

was

discriminated

by

the

respondents, inasmuch as, he was not reinstated along with others
like him.
4.

The respondents contested the petition on the ground

that the petitioner did not hold any post since he was a daily wager.
Respondents relied upon the decisions of the Supreme Court in
Mahendra L. Jain vs. Indore Development Authorities JT 2004
(10) SC 1 and Union of India vs. A.P. Bajpai and Ors. AIR 2003 SC
923.
5.

The Tribunal observed that the petitioner had been

W.P(C) No. 3181/2006

Page 2 of 4

disengaged in the year 2000, and yet he chose to file the OA in 2005
and consequently the petition suffered from delay and laches.

Yet

the Tribunal examined the petitioner's claim on merits and rejected
the same.

The Tribunal held that the petitioner was yet to get

temporary status and was discharging his duties only on daily wages.
Consequently, he had no right of protection under Article 311 of the
Constitution of India.

On the issue of dispensing with his services

without prior opportunity to show-cause, the reasoning of the Tribunal
is contained in Para 12 of the impugned order which reads as follows
:-

6.

“Apex Court in Nar Singh Pal Vs. Union of India &
Others (2000) 3 SCC (Page 588) in case of a casual
worker, who had acquired temporary status, held
that on acquirement of temporary status one is
bestowed with certain benefits, which, inter alia,
includes entitlement of constitutional protection
envisaged by Article 311 of the Constitution, i.e.,
before the retrenchment a reasonable opportunity
should have to be accorded. However, as the
applicant was on daily wages, his dispensation of
service, though may be actuated on a particular
incident, showed his unsatisfactory performance.
The incident is only a motive for dispensing his
service, as he has no right to the post.”
We find ourselves in complete agreement with the

proposition set out by the Tribunal as aforesaid. Moreover, in view of
the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Karnataka

and Ors. vs. Uma Devi and Ors. 2006 (4) scale 197, in our
view, the petitioner has no right to seek regularization or
reinstatement and we consequently dismiss this petition.
