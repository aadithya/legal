1.

Present appeal under Section 23 of the Railways Act

1989 challenges an order dated 08.05.2006 passed by the Railway
Claims

Tribunal, Principal

Bench,

Delhi dismissing

the claim

application of the appellant.
2.

Appellant had filed a claim application under Section

124-A of the Railways Act, 1989 claiming compensation in the sum
of Rs. 4 lakhs on account of the death of her husband Sh. Raj Kumar
Pandey @ Raju (hereinafter referred to as the deceased) in a train
accident.

It

was

averred

in

the

claim

application

that

on

04.12.2000 the deceased was traveling from Shahdara to Delhi Main
by the train no. 6 S.D. That since the train was overcrowded the
deceased got a place near the door of the compartment. That at
about 9.20AM there was a sudden jerk due to which the deceased
accidentally fell down from the train and died of the injuries
sustained thereof.
4.

On 4.02.02 an application seeking amendment of the

original application was filed by the appellant. Amendment sought
was that on 4.12.2000 i.e. on the date of the accident the deceased
was traveling from Behta Hajipur to Delhi Main by the train no. 6
S.D.
5.

Vide order dated 10.04.03 the amendment sought by

the appellant was allowed by the Railway Claims Tribunal.
6.

Railways defended by pleading that the appellant is not

entitled to any compensation for the reason that neither the
deceased was a bonafide passenger in the train no.6 S.D. nor his
death was a result of an accidental fall from the train.
7.

In support of the claim the appellant examined herself

as AW-1, Mr. Avdhesh Pandey as AW-2 and Mr. Sant Ram as AW-3.
8.

Avdesh Pandey AW-2 who was the nephew of the

deceased deposed that on the date of the accident he purchased a
ticket for the deceased from Behta Hajipur station and that he saw
the deceased boarding the train no.6 S.D.

10.

On behalf of the Railways Umed Singh who was the

driver of the train no.6 S.D. on the date of the accident was
examined as RW-1.

iv)

Post Mortem Report

12.

Vide impugned order dated 08.05.06 the Railway Claims

……Ex.AW1/5

Tribunal dismissed the claim application filed by the appellant.
Reasoning given by the Tribunal reads as under: “The applicant in the claim application has shown
the address of the deceased as D-1240, Gali no.78
(Shive Gali) Ashoke Nagar-Shahdara, Delhi-93.
However the electoral card issued by the Election
Commission of India shows the address as D-732,
Ashoke Nagar-Shahdara. Anyone of the above
addresses may be correct but the fact remains that
the deceased was a resident of Ashok Nagar,
Shahdara. In case he had to travel to Delhi by 6 S.D.
logically he should have purchased ticket from
Shahdara to Delhi Main. However, in the affidavit it
has been indicated that the deceased had
purchased the ticket from Behta Hajipur which is 5
km beyond Shahdara towards Shamli. The logic of
going all the way to Behta Hajipur to buy the ticket
towards Delhi which passes through Shahdara
(Ashok Nagar) where he stays is not understood. In
support of this the applicant have produced the
evidence of AW-2 Avdesh Pandey who indicated that
FAO No. 199/2006

Page 3 of 6

he had dropped the deceased at Behta Hajipur
station where he had purchased the ticket for his
uncle. Again the reason for going away from the
place of residence by 5 kms is not understood,
hence the evidence of AW-2 Avdesh Pandey cannot
be relied upon. Applicant have also produced the
evidence of AW-3 Sant Ram who indicated that he
boarded the train along with the deceased at Behta
Hajipur, here also similar logic comes into question
as to why a passenger would go 5 kms away from
his place of residence to travel across his residence
towards Delhi when the train stops at Shahdara
where the deceased resided, hence evidence of AW3 Sant Ram cannot be relied upon.
One material fact that has been brought out by the
learned counsel for the respondent is that the death
of the deceased took place at 9.20 A.m. on 14.12.00
as per the applicant. Train no. 6 S.D. arrived Delhi
Shahdara at 8.38, hence it can be reasonably
assumed that it would have arrived at the place of
incident at 8.36 hours or 8.37 hours. The train had
already arrived and terminated at Delhi at 8.55
hours as per the driver’s log book. The fact that he
died at 9.30 AM has been brought out by the postmortem report (Ex.AW1/5) wherein it has been
stated that on 4.12.00 near 2-C Rly. Phatak opp. Rly.
Quarters Ashok Nagar at about 9.20 AM victim died,
on the spot.
After hearing arguments of learned counsel of both
the parties and going through the documents on
record it can be safely assumed that the deceased
was not a bonafide passenger of the train and he
died due to certain factors near his residence Ashok
Nagar, Shahdara much after 6 SD had passed that
location. Circumstances leading to his death near
his place of residence much later than the train had
passed through that location can lead to reasonable
assumption that he died near the railway track but
not in an untoward incident.”
13.

A perusal of the reasoning given by the learned Railway

Claims Tribunal shows that it has decided the issue pertaining to the
manner of the accident with reference to the original pleadings in

FAO No. 199/2006

Page 4 of 6

the claim application i.e on the date of the accident the deceased
was traveling from Shahdara to Delhi Main by train no. 6 S.D., that is
why the Tribunal found it strange as to why the deceased who was
to travel from Shahdara to Delhi Main would go to a place which was
5 Kms. away from Shahdara particularly when the train no. 6 S.D
passes through Shahdara.
14.

I note that the learned Tribunal has also considered the

oral evidence led by the appellant with reference to the original
pleadings in the claim application.
15.
noting

The Tribunal committed a fundamental error in not
and

considering

the

claim

petition

as

amended

on

10.04.2003 i.e on the date of accident the deceased was traveling
form Behta Hajipur to Delhi Main.
16.

Coming to the second part of the reasoning of the

learned Tribunal which is based upon the Post Mortem Report
Ex.AW1/5 suffice would it be to note that the DD Entry 11 dated
4.12.2000 Ex.AW1/2 was recorded at 9.20 AM by a police official
after receiving information about the accident from the Railways. At
the time of recording of the DD entry no. 11 i.e at 9.20 AM the
deceased had already died. The whole process starting from giving
information by the Railways to the Police, the arrival of the Police
official at the scene of the accident and the recording of the DD
Entry no. 11 must have taken atleast 20 minutes. Therefore it is
obvious that the death of the deceased took place before 9.20 AM.
The Post Mortem Repost Ex. AW1/5 records the time of the death of
FAO No. 199/2006

Page 5 of 6

the deceased as 9.20 AM. DD entry shows that the Post Mortem
Report is flawed with respect to the recording of the time of the
death of the deceased.
17.

I further note that the learned Tribunal has not

considered the relevant documentary evidence led by the appellant.
18.

The appeal is allowed.

Order dated 8.5.2006 is set

aside. I remand the matter to the learned Tribunal which shall redecide the same with reference to the amended claim application
and shall also consider the documentary evidence filed by the
appellant particularly the Inquest Report Ex.AW1/3 which records
that according to the statements made by the people present on the
site of accident the death of the deceased was caused due to falling
from the train no. 6 S.D.
19.

Appeal stands disposed of in terms of para 18 above.

20.

No costs.

21.

LCR be returned.
