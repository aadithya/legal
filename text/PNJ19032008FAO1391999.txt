FAO.No.139/1999
1.

The question involved in the present appeal is whether

the finding recorded vide impugned judgment and order dated
2.12.1988 that the will dated 15.4.1968 is the last legal and valid
testament executed by Late Sh. Maya Ram Sehgal (hereinafter
referred to as the testator) is incorrect.
2.

Maya Ram Sehgal died on 11.10.1968 leaving behind his

widow Smt. Agya Wati Sehgal (respondent No.2) as the only class I
heir.

He was the owner of the property bearing Municipal No.B-

FAO No.139/99

page 2 of 11

10/19, Rajouri Garden, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the
property).
3.

The will dated 15.4.1968, Ex. PW-2/1, allegedly executed

by the testator and propounded by the appellants after 25 years of
the death of the testator is a hand written document and consists of
a single sheet of a paper. It has been penned in Urdu language.
4.

The will is an unregistered document.

5.

The will has been purportedly witnesses by one Sh.

Chaudhary Ram Sharma and one Mr. Amrik Chand Sehgal.
6.

As per the will the testator had created life interest in

respect of his property in favour of his wife i.e. respondent No.2 and
one Mr. Surender Kumar Sehgal and has bequeathed the corpus in
favour of the wife and children of Surender Kumar Sehgal.

It

records that the testator treated Surender Kumar Sehgal, who is the
grand son of his real brother, as his own son and that is why he is
bequeathing his property in favour of wife and children of Surender
Kumar Sehgal.
7.

Surender Kumar Sehgal left the world of living on

3.9.1988.
8.

On 7.5.1993, the appellants who are wife and children of

Mr. Surender Kumar Sehgal filed a petition under Section 276 of the
Indian Succession Act 1925 seeking probate of the will in question
purported to have been executed by the testator in their favour.
9.

From the aforenoted facts one thing stands out; that the

will has been propounded 25 years after the death of the testator.
FAO No.139/99

page 3 of 11

10.

The widow of the testator i.e. respondent No.2 and one

Mr. Sanjiv Kakkar, respondent No.3, who claims to have purchased
the ground floor of the property from respondent No.2 had opposed
the petition.
11.

Defence set up by the widow of the testator was that the

testator never executed the will Ex. PW-2/1. That the will is a forged
and fabricated document. That a will dated 10.1.1965 was the last
and legal testament executed by the testator under which the
testator had bequeathed the property in her favour.

That the

testator neither adopted nor treated Mr. Surender Kumar Sehgal as
his own son. That the petition was an attempt by the petitioners to
illegally usurp the property of the testator.
12.

Respondent No.3 also pleaded that will is a forged and

fabricated document and that he is a bona fide purchaser of the
ground floor of the property.
13.

On behalf of the petitioners/appellants, 3 witnesses i.e.

Amrik Chand Sehgal, PW-1, Mr. Baldev Kumar, PW-2 and Asha
Sehgal (appellant No.
14.

1), PW-3 were examined.

In his examination in chief Amrik Chand Sehgal, PW-1,

who was the cousin brother of the testator claimed to have
witnessed the preparation, execution and attestation of the will. He
deposed that the second attesting witness has not attested the Will
in his presence but stated that the testator had told him about the
attestation of the Will by a person who was the friend of the testator
and a halwai by profession.
FAO No.139/99

page 4 of 11

15.

It be noted that before he could be cross-examined, PW-

1 died.
16.

Baldev Kumar Talwar, PW-2, who is the brother in law of

appellant No.1 deposed that the testator was the adoptive father of
Mr. Surender Kumar Sehgal. That in April 1968 the testator came to
his house and made a request to him that he should accompany him
to get the will attested by a witness. That thereafter they went to
the shop of Chaudhary Ram Sharma who was a halwai by profession
and that the testator requested Chaudhary Ram Sharma to append
his signatures on the will.
17.

Asha Sehgal, PW-3, who is the wife of Surender Kumar

Sehgal deposed that the will was handed over to her by Sh. Amrik
Chand Sehal in October/November in 1993-94.
18.

Besides examining herself as RW-1, the widow of the

testator examined one Mr. Rajender Kumar Sehgal as RW-2.
19.

The widow of the testator, in her testimony as RW-1,

reiterated the stand taken in her objections.
20.

Rajender Kumar Sehgal, RW-2, the brother of Surender

Kumar Sehgal deposed that Surender Kumar Sehgal was never
adopted by the testator.

That the will, Ex. PW-2/1, is not in the

handwriting nor bears the signatures of the testator.
21.

After noting respective pleadings and evidence of the

parties, vide order dated 2.12.1998, learned Trial Judge has held
that the will dated 15.4.1968 Ex. PW-2/1 is not the last legal and
valid testament executed by the testator.
FAO No.139/99

The decision of the
page 5 of 11

learned Trial Judge is based on the following three reasons:
A.

Even the untested testimony of Amrik Chand Sehgal PW-

1 is not credit worthy.
B.

The petitioners/appellants have failed to establish that

Mr. Surender Kumar Sehgal was adopted by the testator.
C.

The fact that the will, Ex. PW-2/1, was propounded 25

years after the death of the testator is a circumstance throwing
grave suspicion regarding the due execution of the will Ex. PW-2/1
by the testator and that the petitioners have failed to repel said
suspicious circumstance.
22.

As noted hereinabove the petitioners have filed the

present appeal against the order dated 2.12.1998 passed by the
learned Trial Judge dismissing the probate petition filed by them.
23.

Mr. Amrik Chand Sehgal, PW-1, has deposed that the

will, Ex.PW-2/1, was executed in April, 1968. It be noted that the
exact date on which the Will Ex.PW-2/1 was executed has not been
disclosed by him. He has next deposed that the Will was scribed by
a person aged 70 years old upon the instructions of the testator but
stated that he did not remember the name of said person. PW-1
initially deposed that he cannot identify the signatures of the
testator and that of the other attesting witness but later on deposed
that he can identify the same. He further deposed that he had never
met the other attesting witness.
24.

The testimony of PW-1 makes an interesting reading.

After initially identifying the signatures of second attesting witness
FAO No.139/99

page 6 of 11

and additionally stating that the second attesting witness did not
affix his signatures on the will in his presence and that testator had
told him that the signatures of the other attesting witness were of
Chaudhary Ram Sharma went on to identify the signatures of
second attesting witness. This shows that PW-1 is a tutored witness
and is not stating the truth. How could he identify the signature of
Chaudhary Ram Sharma whom he never met and even did not see
him signing as an attesting witness.
25.

It is relevant to note that PW-1 died before he could be

cross-examined and the fate of his credibility could have been
completely shattered had he been cross-examined.
26.

It is settled law that the evidentary value of a witness

who dies before he could be cross-examined though admissible but
is weak for the reason testimony of the witness is not tested on the
anvil of cross-examination.
27.

In the instant case the self inflicted wounds by PW-1 on

his testimony renders his testimony not even worth the paper on
which it is penned.
28.

At this stage it is relevant to note that it is not the case

of the appellants that the other stated attesting witness i.e.
Chaudhary Ram Sharma is not in the world of living or not subject to
process of court or incapable of giving evidence.
29.

As noted hereinabove, Balraj Kumar Tanwar PW-2, was

produced by the appellants to prove the due execution of the will.
He had merely deposed that Chaudhary Ram Sharma affixed his
FAO No.139/99

page 7 of 11

signatures on the will in the presence of the testator. He did not
depose that the testator had affixed his signatures on the will in the
presence of Chaudhary Ram Sharma.
30.

A will is validly executed when after understanding the

contents of the will the testator affixes his signatures on the will in
the presence of the attesting witnesses and thereafter the attesting
witnesses affix their signatures on the will in the presence of the
testator.
31.

Therefore even the testimony of PW-2 fails to establish

the due execution of the Will Ex.PW2/1.
32.

It is most relevant to note that none of the witnesses of

the appellants have deposed that the testator was in a state of
sound disposing mind at the time when the will Ex.PW-2/1 was
executed.
33.

Pertaining to the finding recorded by the learned Trial

Judge that the appellants have failed to establish that Mr. Surender
Kumar Sehgal was the adopted son of the testator suffice would it
be to note the testimonies of RW-1 and RW-2.
34.

RW-1 and RW-2 in their respective testimonies have

categorically deposed that Mr. Surender Kumar Sehgal was not the
adopted son of the testator. No suggestion was given to them in
their cross examination by the appellants that Mr. Surender Kumar
Sehgal was the adopted son of the testator.
35.

In such circumstances learned Trial Judge has correctly

opined that the appellants have failed to establish that Mr. Surender
FAO No.139/99

page 8 of 11

Kumar Sehgal was the adopted son of the testator. It is thus
apparent that false recitals have been incorporated in the Will to
give legitimacy to the Will.
36.

The fact that the will Ex. PW-2/1 was propounded after

25 years of the death of the testator was a suspicious circumstance
and there was a very heavy onus upon the appellant to dispel the
said suspicious circumstance.
37.

Asha Sehgal (appellant No.1) PW-3 has deposed that the

will Ex. PW-2/1 was handed over to her by Amrik Chand Sehgal in
October/November 1993-94.
38.

As noted herein above Amrik Chand Sehgal PW-1 in his

examination in chief has not even uttered a word regarding the fact
that the will Ex. PW-2/1 was in his custody and that he handed over
the same to appellant No.1 in October/November 1993-94.
39.

At this juncture I note that a suit for permanent

injunction was filed by the present appellants against the widow of
the testator. An application was moved by the present appellants
during the trial of the said suit seeking to amend the plaint filed by
them. Vide order dated 23.3.1992 said application was rejected by
a court of Sub Judge Delhi. Copy of the said order is exhibited as
RW-2/1.
40.

A perusal of the order dated 23.3.1992 Ex.RW-2/1 shows

that the amendment sought by the appellants was that the testator
had executed the will Ex.PW-2/1 in their favour.
41.

Appellant no.1 in her testimony as PW-3 had deposed

FAO No.139/99

page 9 of 11

that the Will Ex.PW-2/1 was handed over to her by Amrik Chand
Sehgal

in

October/November

1993-94.

But

contrary

to

her

testimony, the amendment pertaining to the Will Ex.PW2/1 was
moved in much before year 1993-94 as evident from order dated
23.03.92 Ex.RW-2/1.
42.

Appellant No.1 had further deposed that she was aware

about the existence of the will Ex. PW-2/1 even before her marriage
to Mr. Surender Kumar Sehgal in the year 1969 but did not make
any efforts to trace the will Ex. PW-2/1. She had also deposed that
she never questioned Amrik Chand Sehgal as to why he did not
hand over will Ex. PW-2/1 for a period of nearly 25 years.
43.

Baldev Kumar Talwar PW-2 had deposed that though he

was aware that the testator by virtue of the will Ex. PW-2/1 had
bequeathed his property in favour of Mr. Surender Kumar Sehgal,
his wife and children yet he never informed his sister in law i.e.
appellant No.1 or Mr. Surender Kumar Sehgal regarding the same. I
find it strange.
44.

The aforenoted unnatural conduct of appellant No.1 and

Baldev Kumar Tanwar and reading of the testimony of PW-1 in
conjunction with the order dated 23.03.92 Ex.RW-2/1 further
deepens the suspicion surrounding the due execution of the will Ex.
PW-2/1.
45.

In view of above discussion I find no infirmity in the

judgment and order 2.12.1988 passed by the learned Trial Judge.
46.

Impugned order dated 2.12.1998 is affirmed.

FAO No.139/99

page 10 of 11

47.

The appeal is dismissed.

48.

No costs.

C.M. No.314/01
1.

Above-captioned application under Order I Rule 10 CPC

has been filed by one Mr.Rajinder Kumar Sehgal seeking his
impleadment as a respondent in the present appeal.
2.

Impleadment has been sought on the ground that the

respondent no.2 who died on 22.02.01 by virtue of a will dated
19.03.1999 had bequeathed the property bearing Muncipal No.B10/19, Rajouri Garden, New Delhi in his favour. That the present
appeal relates to the said property. That since he would be affected
by the decision of the appeal it is necessary to allow him to defend
the present appeal.
3.

Since the present appeal is dismissed the application

has become infructous and is thus dismissed.
