2.

Brief facts necessary to dispose of this petition are that

the petitioner was working as an Executive Engineer in the DDA
in the year 1991. On 4.2.1991, a complaint no. RC6(A)/91-DLI
under Section 7 and Section 13(2) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 was filed against the petitioner alleging
that he had received a sum of Rs.3,000/- as illegal gratification.
Pursuant to the afore-noted complaint, a FIR was registered
against the petitioner.
3.

As the petitioner was 'public servant' within the meaning

of Section 21, IPC, CBI applied for sanction under Section 19 of
the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 for the prosecution of
the petitioner.
4.

Vide

order

dated

15.06.91,

the

sanction

for

the

prosecution of the petitioner was granted by the Vice
Chairman, DDA. Thereafter, CBI filed a charge sheet against the
petitioner before the Court of Special Judge, Delhi.
5.

Upon being summoned, petitioner filed an application for

discharge on the ground that the sanction was granted by an
incompetent authority. Vide order dated 31.1.96, Special Judge
discharged the petitioner on the ground that Vice Chairman,
DDA was not empowered to grant sanction for prosecution of
petitioner.

6.

On 1.6.98, CBI filed a fresh charge sheet against the

petitioner after obtaining fresh sanction for prosecution of the
petitioner from Director (Vigilance), DDA. Petitioner again filed
an application for the discharge on the ground

that the

sanction was granted by an incompetent authority. Vide order
dated 22.1.02, Special Judge again discharged the petitioner on
the ground that sanction was not granted by a competent
authority.
7.

On 1.9.2003, CBI again obtained a fresh sanction for

prosecution of the petitioner from the President of India. On the
basis of the fresh sanction, yet again prosecution has been
launched against the petitioner. Vide order dated 12.1.04,
Special Judge has taken cognizance of the matter and has
summoned the petitioner to face trial.
8.

Petitioner seeks quashing of the prosecution on the sole

ground of inordinate delay.
9.

In the instant case, complaint filed in the year 1991 is still

languishing at pre-charge stage in the year 2007. 16 have gone
by. From the facts noted above it is apparent that the
petitioner have not contributed to the delay.
10.

Right to a speedy trial is a part of fair, just and reasonable

procedure implicit in Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

Suffice would it be to note the following observations of

the Supreme Court in the decision reported as Mahender Lal
Das v State of Bihar, 2002 (1) SCC 153:"5. It is true that interference by the court at
the investigation stage is not called for.
However, it is equally true that the
investigating agency cannot be given the
latitude of protracting the conclusion of the
investigation without any limit of time. This
Court in Abdul Rehman Antulay v. R.S. Nayak
while interpreting the scope of Article 21 of the
Constitution held that every citizen has a right
to speedy trial of the case pending against
him. The speedy trial was considered also in
public interest as it serves the social interest
also. It is in the interest of all concerned that
guilt or innocence of the accused is determined
as quickly as possible in the circumstances.
The right to speedy trial encompasses all the
stages, namely, stage of investigation, enquiry,
trial, appeal, revision and retrial. While
determining the alleged delay, the court has to
decide each case on its facts having regard to
all attending circumstances including nature of
offence, number of accused and witnesses, the
workload of the court concerned, prevailing
local conditions etc. Every delay may not be
taken as causing prejudice to the accused but
the alleged delay has to be considered in the
totality of the circumstances and the general
conspectus of the case. Inordinate long delay
can be taken as a presentive proof of
prejudice."

There are plethora of judicial pronouncements where on

account of delay prosecution has been quashed, some of them
are being indexed below:-
