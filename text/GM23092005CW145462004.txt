1.

By this writ petition, the petitioner is seeking a writ

setting aside the award dated 28th July, 2003 and order dated 7th
May, 2004 in ID 7A/2001 passed by the Central Government
Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court, New Delhi. It appears that
the petitioner was appointed as a work supervisor on daily wages as
a casual ad hoc employee of M/s IRCON International
:1:

WP(C14546/2004

Limited(respondent no.2 herein). His services were regularised vide
an order passed by the respondent on 24th March, 1986 when he was
given regular pay scale of Rs.424-700 with effect from 24th
December, 1985 and his designation was changed from Works
Supervisor to Junior foreman.
2.

The petitioner thereafter served with the respondent no.2

and his services were transferred from place to place till he was
transferred to Delhi-Mathura Project of respondent no.2. On 2nd
June, 1998, respondent no.2 is stated to have issued a notice
terminating the services of the petitioner and some other employees.
3.

This action of the respondents was impugned by the

petitioner by way of writ petition no.4061/98 entitled K.P.Singh vs.
Union of India wherein the petitioner sought the following prayers:“1) Quash the notice dated 2.6.1998 issued by
respondent no.2 IRCON International Limited
(Annexure P-3) whereby the services of the
petitioner is sought to be terminated being illegal,
arbitrary, discriminatory and unwarranted.
2) direct respondent no.2 IRCON International
Limited to continue to treat the petitioner as its
regular and permanent employee and continue to
give him all the benefits as are admissible to him by
virtue of his service.
:2:

WP(C14546/2004

3) Award cost of this petition; and also.

4.

4) pass any other order or orders as this Hon'ble
Court may deem fit and proper.”
This writ petition was contested by the respondent no.2

who filed a counter affidavit on 12th October, 1998. The material
deposition on behalf of respondent no.2 relevant for the purposes of
the present case was as follows:“3. Without prejudice to the above submission it is
further submitted that the petitioner was a Junior
Engineer engaged on supervisory duties and was in
receipt of salary of over Rs.9,000/- per month and
as such, he is not a workman in terms of Section
2(s) of the ID Act. The writ petition of the
petitioner being based on the alleged violation of
the ID Act is wholly misconceived and ill
conceived. However, considering the petitioner
has based his case in the petition on alleged
violation of ID Act, the respondent is replying
those allegations by assuming that the petitioner to
be a workman under ID Act but without accepting
the same. It may be added that compliance of the
provisions of S.25(F) of ID Act is by abundant
caution, and that shall not deem that the petitioner
is a workman. It is submitted whether a person is a
workman or not under Section 2(2) of the ID Act is
a mixed question of law and facts and, therefore,
the same is to be decided on the basis of evidence
and cross examination of witnesses in the
appropriate forum so evolved under the ID Act.”
5.

The petitioner at that stage disputed these assertions on

behalf of the respondent and asserted that his claim was legally
:3:

WP(C14546/2004

maintainable. The writ petition filed by the petitioner alongwith the
writ petition filed by other employees similarly situated was
disposed of vide a detailed judgment dated 10th February, 2000
whereby this Court directed as follows:-

6.

“111. On the facts and circumstances of the instant
case before me, all facts are disputed and on the
basis of the affidavits and the materials on record,
no conclusion can be arrived at unless a complete
picture about the projects, the nature of work done
by the petitioners, and the circumstances under
which the respondent/IRCON had issued the order,
challenged in the writ petitions, is proved by
evidence, oral and documentary. The court cannot
adjudicate on these points raised by the petitioners
and respondents. That exercise could be done only
by an industrial court. In this view, I do not want
to enter into any discussion on merits of the rival
contentions of the parties. Granting the liberty to
the petitioners in these writ petitions to raise
industrial disputes, the writ petitions are
dismissed.”
This order was assailed by the petitioner in a petition

before the Supreme Court of India vide an order passed on 8th
November, 2000.

The same was disposed of in the following

terms:“Leave is granted limited to the question
on which notice to show cause was issued by this
Court on August 7, 2000.
Heard learned counsel for the appellants
:4:

WP(C14546/2004

and the Additional Solicitor General appearing for
the respondents.
In regard to the notice issued to the
respondents to show cause why similar order
should not be passed (as passed in Special Leave
Petition( C ) no.1573 of 1998) in this case also and
why reference should not be directed to be made to
the Industrial Tribunal under Section 10 of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the learned
Additional Solicitor General states that he has no
objection to passing of an order in terms of the
show cause notice. Accordingly we order that if
the Central Government is approached by the
appellants for making a reference to the Industrial
Tribunal under Section 10 of the Industrial
Disputes Act, the Central Government shall make
the reference to the Tribunal within two months of
making a written request for reference. On a
reference being made. The Tribunal shall dispose
of the same within six months. If possible,
provided both the parties cooperate.

accordingly.”

Thereafter the petitioner appears to have approached the

Assistant Labour Commissioner raising a dispute who sent the
matter to the Government of India for making a reference vide an
order dated 16th January, 2001. The Central Government vide an
order bearing no.L41011/1/2001/IR(B-I) dated 16th January, 2001,
referred the following industrial dispute to the Central Government
:5:

WP(C14546/2004

Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court for its adjudication:-

8.

“Whether the action of the Joint General Manager,
IRCON International Limited, Palika Bhawan,
Sector-13, RK Puram, New Delhi-110 066 was
within its right in terminating the services of Sri
Gopal Singh and eleven other workmen on the
respective dates as per details shown in the
Annexure(I). And whether the concerned workmen
could claim to be permanent employees of the
IRCON International Ltd? If not to what benefits
and relief the workmen are entitled to? (EnclosureAnnexure-I.”
This reference was registered as ID No.7/2001. A joint

statement of claim was made by the petitioner alongwith 11 other
persons which was contested by the respondent no.2 in its written
statement. Copy of the statement of claim dated 20 th March, 2001
has been placed on the record of this Court wherein the petitioner
had signed as signatory no.11.
It appears that the petitioner thereafter was not satisfied
with the claim as laid and made an application dated 23 rd April, 2002
seeking leave to file a separate statement of claim inter alia on the
following averments:“2. That it is submitted that my case is quite
different from other workmen to the proceedings.
My case is in a different footing and which is to be
considered differently than the other workmen
mainly on two grounds.
:6:

WP(C14546/2004

(1) I am permanent and confirmed Junior
Engineer of the IRCON and not a
particular project employee or a tenure
post.
My appointment letter dated
19.5.1986 clearly shows that my
appointment was permanent in nature
and liable to transfer to project to project.
(2) I am not a workman as per section
2(s) of the ID Act. I was a junior
Engineer in the scale of pay Rs.50008000, drawing a salary of Rs.9,000/- per
month, working in a supervisory
capacity.
The Management itself
admitted the very fact in its counter
affidavit in the writ proceeding.”
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
“Therefore it is one second prayer that
this Hon'ble Tribunal may please permit
the applicant/deponent to file separate
statement claim in the light of the above
submission and the case of the
applicant/deponent
be
considered
separately please.”
9.

In addition to this application the petitioner filed a further

application on 15th January, 2003 in ID 7/2001 submitting as
follows:“3. That the main statement of claim in this case
already filed by Shri O.P.Khadaria, Advocate in
respect of Gopal Singh and eleven others including
the applicant/deponent, on 23.3.2001, without any
authorisation or consent of the applicant/deponent
:7:

WP(C14546/2004

and for the reason there is nothing mentioned in
respect of applicant/deponent as Junior Engineer.
4. That as already stated in the main application
filed by the applicant/deponent that he was working
in a supervisory capacity, drawing a salary of
Rs.9,000/- per month therefore was not covered
under the definition of workman as provided in
Section 2(s) of ID Act. This fact was also admitted
and submitted in counter affidavit by the
respondent/management before the Hon'ble High
Court of Delhi in CWP no.4061 of 1998. Copy of
which is enclosed herewith for kind consideration
of this Hon'ble Tribunal.
Due to, improper
representation by the Advocate for the applicant
deponent before Hon'ble Supreme Court, the
Hon'ble Court in wrong impression ordered to
approach Central Government alongwith other
employees.
5. That except the applicant/deponent, and Shri
Dhal Singh, all other ten persons are workman as
defined in the Industrial Dispute Act, and therefore
the statement of claim to be filed separately is very
much necessary in the interest of justice and early
disposal of the case of the applicant/deponent. The
disposal of the case can take a long time and if
permission to file separate statement or
consideration of the case of the applicant/deponent
in the separate manner is not made than it will
make a irreparable loss to the applicant/deponent.”
10.

This application was considered by the Industrial Tribunal

which passed an order allowing the application and separating the
case of the petitioner which was treated as ID No.7A/2001 dated 28 th
:8:

WP(C14546/2004

July, 2003 based thereon:“2. After filing statement of claim by workman
written statement by the management, on the basis
of the objection of the Management Shri KP Singh
one of the workman of ID No.7/2001 moved an
application on 23.4.2002 to withdraw his claim
from this Court on the ground that his case is
different from the case of other workmen. The
application of Shri KP Singh was allowed and
accordingly his case has been separated and has
been permitted to withdraw his case.
3. Since the workman Shri KP Singh has
withdrawn his claim and A/R of the management
did not raise any objection to it the reference so far
as it relates to Shri KP Singh is answered as “the
claim of workman KP Singh has been withdrawn.
4. Accordingly No Dispute Award is passed in
respect of the claim of Shri KP Singh.”
11.

Aggrieved by the order passed on his application and no

dispute award passed by the Industrial Tribunal, the petitioner made
an application on 29th September, 2003 seeking recall of the award
on the plea that the petitioner had moved applications praying leave
to file separate statement of claim as the applicant is not a workman
but a junior engineer and that he never intended to withdraw the
case.

According to the petitioner he had never made a prayer

seeking leave to withdraw his case.
:9:

WP(C14546/2004

12.

This application was contested by the respondent no.2

before the Industrial Tribunal. By a detailed order dated 7th May,
2004, the application was rejected.
13.

The petitioner has filed the present writ petition

impugning the award dated 28th July, 2003 and the order dated 7th
May, 2004 before this Court in the present writ petition.

The

principle ground for challenge by the petitioner before this Court is
that the petitioner had never made any prayer seeking withdrawal of
his case before the Industrial Tribunal.

His application had

contained a simple prayer seeking leave to make a separate claim as
the petitioner was of the view that his case was different and that the
award dated 28th July, 2003 and the order dated 7th May, 2004 are
without jurisdiction inasmuch as the Tribunal had no authority
whatsoever to make an order which had not been sought on the
petitioner's application.
14.

I find that the petitioner had raised a specific challenge to

his termination based on the plea that he was workman covered by
the Industrial Disputes Act in WP(C) 4061/98.

In the counter

affidavit which had been filed in WP 4061/98, an objection in this
: 10 :

WP(C14546/2004

behalf had been specifically urged by the respondent who had
submitted that the petitioner was not a workman and not covered
under its definition in Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947.

Yet the petitioner maintained his claim resulting in the

judgment dated 10th February, 2000.
15.

This issue was however not decided for the reasons

recorded in the judgment dated 10th February, 2000 which has been
reproduced herein above. It was held by the court that in view of
the objections raised, disputed questions of fact arose and that no
conclusions could be arrived at on the basis of the affidavits and the
material on record. Consequently the Court did not enter into
merits of the rival contentions of the parties and dismissed the writ
petitions giving liberty to the petitioners to raise industrial dispute.
16.

The petitioner assailed this judgment on the same pleas

before the Apex Court. It appears that an order had been passed in
SLP(C) No.1573/98 directing a reference to be made to the
industrial tribunal under Section 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947. Based on this order a similar direction was made in respect of
the other petitions.
: 11 :

WP(C14546/2004

17.

The Central Government thereafter has even made the

reference on 16th January, 2001 for adjudication of the disputes
raised by the petitioner and other persons for adjudication by the
Central Government Industrial Tribunal.
18.

The petitioner filed a claim alongwith the other persons

duly signed by him to which the respondent filed its written
statement. Only thereafter, the petitioner filed the application dated
23rd April, 2002 contending that he was not a workman as per
Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act on the ground that he was
a junior engineer in the scale of pay of Rs.5,000-8,000 drawing a
salary of Rs.9,000/- per month working in a supervisory capacity.
The first admission to this effect was made in an application dated
23rd April, 2002. This was repeated in his application made on 15th
January, 2003.
19.

In his application dated 15th January, 2003 the petitioner

also asserted that the statement of claim was filed by his advocate
“without any authorisation or consent”. So far as the proceedings
before the Apex Court are concerned, the petitioner contended that
“due to improper representation” by his advocate, the Supreme

: 12 :

WP(C14546/2004

Court “in wrong impression ordered to approach Central
Government alongwith other employees”. The petitioner however
contended that except the applicant(himself) and one Shri Dhal
Singh, the other ten persons in whose behalf also the reference stood
made by the Government were covered under the definition of
workman 'as defined under the Industrial Disputes Act.
20.

I find that in the 2nd application made by him the

petitioner placed reliance on the objection taken by the respondent
no.2 before this Court in WP 4061/98 to the effect that the petitioner
was not a workman who was covered under Section 2(s) in the
definition of workman of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947. The
petitioner had even placed copy of the counter affidavit of the
respondent no.2 before the industrial tribunal.
21.

Undoubtedly a prayer was made by the petitioner to

permit the petitioner to file a separate statement of claim in the light
of these statements.
22.

The question which arises for consideration before this

Court is as to whether the prayer made by the petitioner in his
applications could have been granted in law. There is no dispute
: 13 :

WP(C14546/2004

that there was no adjudication by either this Court in the earlier
litigation or by the Apex Court on the claims of the respective
parties. The petitioner in his writ petition had sought reliefs based
on the violations of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes
Act,1947 which applies only to workmen.

There was no

adjudication of such pleas/claims. The Apex Court also was not
called upon to adjudicate upon the availability or maintainability of
the remedy under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 of the petitioner.
23.

Despite objection by the respondent no. 2 that the

petitioner was not a workman and challenge to maintainability of the
pleas taken by the petitioner, the petitioner did not seek the
severance of his case from the other persons whose cases were being
heard alongwith his case before this Court or the Apex Court and
permitted the orders dated 8th November, 2000 to be passed even in
respect of his case. He accepted the orders, sought adjudication
under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and even signed and filed a
claim before the Industrial Adjudicator.
24.

In my view the plea which the petitioner raised in the

proceedings arising out of the reference before the industrial
: 14 :

WP(C14546/2004

adjudicator ought to have been taken earlier either before this Court
or before the Apex Court. The petitioner was required to have
pointed out that his case was not the same as that of the other
persons that he was not a workman and sought severance of his case.
Having specifically based prayers on the premise that he was a
workman covered under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and
having filed a claim before the Industrial Tribunal, the petitioner
cannot be permitted to contend that he was improperly represented.
25.

In realisation of his error the petitioner made the

application dated 23rd April, 2002 to the effect that he was not
covered under the definition of workman given in Section 2(s) of the
Industrial Disputes Act.
There can be no dispute that the Industrial Disputes Act
1947 is applicable strictly to matters of disputes between workmen
as defined under Section 2(s) and

the industrial establishments

where they are employed. The disputes raised by the petitioner,
therefore,

could not have been agitated by raising a claim for

adjudication under the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 inasmuch as the
petitioner was not a workman.
: 15 :

WP(C14546/2004

26.

An employee who is not a workman, has no legal right to

approach the Conciliation Officer or any Labour Court or Industrial
Tribunal for redressal of his grievances. Appropriate remedy for
redressal of his grievances lies either before the Civil Court or
before the High Court having jurisdiction over the matter. Faced
with the admission by the petitioner, the proceedings at the instance
of the petitioner who was not a workman before the industrial
adjudicator were without authority of law and could not have been
sustained.

For this reason, the Industrial Tribunal had no

jurisdiction under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 to permit him to
file a separate statement of claim or a “separate” statement claim.
Such prayer in the petitioner's application could not have been
legally granted.
27.

Perusal of the impugned award dated 28th July, 2003

shows that the petitioner made an application dated 23rd April, 2002
to withdraw his claim before the Tribunal on the ground that his case
was different.

This application was allowed and his case was

separated(treated as ID 7A/2001) and he was permitted to withdraw
the same. As the petitioner is stated to have withdrawn his claim,
: 16 :

WP(C14546/2004

accordingly, no objection was required thereto from the side of the
management and the claim was answered as having been withdrawn.
As a result the adjudicator has returned a “no dispute” award in
respect of the claims made by the petitioner.
28.

I further find that this award dated 28th July, 2003 has

been published by the appropriate Government on 7th August, 2003
under the provisions of Section 17 of the Industrial Disputes Act
1947. The petitioner has filed the application seeking recall of the
Award only thereafter on 29th September, 2003. This application
was contested by the respondent and rejected by the order dated 7th
of May, 2004.
29.

The order dated 7th May, 2004 records that the petitioner

had filed a handwritten application for withdrawal of the claim apart
from the petitioner's contention that he was not a workman. I find
that the order dated 7th May, 2004 notices that such application was
not traceable in the file. However, in view of the admission of the
petitioner that he was not a workman within the purview of Section
2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the result on the
application of the petitioner cannot change. No other issue has been
: 17 :

WP(C14546/2004

pressed before me.

30.

I have noticed hereinabove that the petitioner raised no

issue before this Court or the Apex Court and did not object to the
directions in reference of the claim made by him to the Industrial
Tribunal.

It was only before the Industrial Tribunal he started

agitating the issue that he was not covered under the definition of
workman under Section 2(s) of the enactment. The respondent has
itself asserted such position.

It is thus manifest that having

repeatedly asserted that he was not a workman, no dispute remained
on this issue and the industrial tribunal had no option but to so
return the reference.
31.

It is trite that a tribunal or court constituted by statute

derives jurisdiction strictly from the legislation which creates it.
Such jurisdiction cannot be conferred on the tribunal or court by any
other court or even by the consent of the parties.

But for the

obdurate posture adopted by the petitioner in the earlier writ petition
and the Apex Court, despite specific objection by the respondents,
such a piquant situation would not have arisen. The orders were
passed by this court on 10th February, 2000 on such stand of the
: 18 :

WP(C14546/2004

petitioner.
In view of the volte face by the petitioner before the
Industrial Adjudicator to the effect that he is not covered under the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, he cannot possibly contend that he is
entitled to maintain a claim before the Industrial Tribunal by virtue
of the judgment dated 10th February, 2000 passed by this Court of
the order dated 8th November, 2000 of the Apex Court.
The industrial tribunal is a creation of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 with no power to adjudicate on any issue or
claim not relating to a workman.
32.

The Industrial Adjudicator has not answered the reference

on its relative merits. A preliminary submission was raised by the
petitioner ousting the jurisdiction of the tribunal. The order made by
the tribunal did not decide or impose any obligation upon the parties.
The petitioner is at liberty to seek adjudication of his pleas and
claims by any appropriate remedy, if available as per law. Needless
to say, the respondent shall have the right to contest the
maintainability and merits of the same on all legally tenable grounds
available on the facts of the present case and in law and also the
: 19 :

WP(C14546/2004

effect of the pleas taken by the petitioner and the impact of the
orders passed in the earlier litigation.
33.

In these circumstances the Award dated 28th July, 2003

and order dated 7th May, 2004 cannot be challenged on any legally
sustainable grounds and the challenge thereto is rejected and the writ
petition is dismissed.
