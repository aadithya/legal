JUDGMENT

1.

The Petitioner prays for the issuance of a writ of

mandamus directing the Respondents to fix his pay in the
revised scale

of Rs.8000-275-13500 with

effect

from

5.12.1996 and grant the benefit of ten (10) advance
WP(C)14301/2004

Page 1 of 13

increments in addition to the pay with all consequential
benefits. The prayer pertaining to payment of

interest at

the rate of twelve (12) per cent per annum has not been
pressed.

2.

The Petitioner was selected for the Short Service

Commission in the Indian Army and was commissioned in
the rank of Second Lieutenant on 25.8.1984. He served for
ten years and was released from the Indian Army on
25.8.1994 as per the Scheme of the Short Service
Commission. Thereafter, he was interviewed by the Union
Public

Service

Commission

and

was

selected

for

appointment to the post of Assistant Commandant in the
Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) vide Appointment
Letter dated 17.5.1995. After some delay attributable only
to the Petitioner, he joined the services of the CISF
pursuant to Office Memorandum dated 29.11.1996. It
appears that the Petitioner assumed charge as Assistant
Commandant on 5.12.1996 and was posted to CISF Unit
DSP,

Durgapur,

West

Bengal.

The

fixation

of

the

Petitioner's pay as Ex-SSCO re-employed as Assistant
WP(C)14301/2004

Page 2 of 13

Commandant in the CISF is contained in the letter No. E27015(3)/28/97-Entt/112A dated 10.4.1997.

It, inter alia,

records the length of service of the Petitioner in the Army
from 24.10.1983 to 22.9.1994 and that his pre-retirement
pay was Rs.3900/- (Basic pay of Rs.3300 plus rank pay of
Rs.600). The said letter witnesses that the Petitioner's
salary on re-employment with the CISF was Rs.3000/- with
effect from 5.12.1996 in the pay scale of Rs.2200-75-2800EB-100-4000. In so doing, as has been noted by the
Assistant Director/Accts, the benefits of ten (10) years
Army service were not made available to the Petitioner. A
clarification was sought from the Ministry of Home Affairs.
In the letter dated 18.12.2002 the Accounts Officer/Entt,
Directorate General, CISF, had addressed a letter to the Sr.
Administrative Officer, Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP)
seeking opinion pertaining to the pay fixation of Ex.-Capt.
Parminder Singh, Assistant Commandant, who was reemployed as an Assistant Commandant and whose service
background was similar to that of the Petitioner. It records
that the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) had
commented

that

WP(C)14301/2004

Captain

Parminder

Singh

had been
Page 3 of 13

allowed the benefits of 10 years advance increments. We
may note that the present petition is predicated on the
argument that the Petitioner should be treated on parity
with Ex. Captain Parminder Singh, Assistant Commandant,
ITBP. Eventually, despite comparisons and Representations
made

in

this

regard,

the

Assistant

Director/Accts,

Directorate General, CISF, by letter dated 13.7.2004, has
confirmed that the Petitioner's pay at Rs.8000/- is in order
and that “he cannot be allowed advance increments
because even the minimum basic pay fixed on his reemployment is more than his basic pay plus rank pay which
he was drawing at the time of retirement from Army”.

It is

this decision that is under challenge before us.

3.

The Petitioner indisputably is entitled to pay in

accordance with Rule 8 of Chapter 2 of Central Civil
Services (Fixation of Pay of Re-employed Pensioners)
Orders,

1986

circulated

vide

DoPT

O&M

dated

31.7.1986,which cannot and does not refer to any Pay
Commission. The Rule reads as under:
Rule 8 - “ECO's and SSCO's who joined preWP(C)14301/2004

Page 4 of 13

commission training or were commissioned after
10-1-1968,

may,

or

their

appointment

in

Government Service to unreserved vacancies, be
granted advance increments equal to the completed
years of service rendered by them in the Armed
Forces on a basic pay (inclusive of deferred pay but
excluding other emoluments) equal to or higher
than the minimum of scale attached to the civil post
in which they are employed. The pay so arrived at
should

not,

however,

exceed

the

basic

pay

(including the deferred pay but excluding other
emoluments) last drawn by them in the Armed
Forces”.

4.

The rationale upon which Rule 8 rests is not difficult

to comprehend and then compliment. The Armed Forces
require to augment their strength from time to time, albeit
not on a permanent basis.

A person who dedicates his

youth and best years to such service ought not to be
discarded in a manner where his subsequent career is
jeopardised.

No

citizen

would

be

interested

in

the

commission if after ten years he is to start his career anew,
and that too at the junior-most stage. It is for this salutary
reason that the ten (10) increments, which are substance of
WP(C)14301/2004

Page 5 of 13

this petition, are bestowed on persons such as the
petitioner. Once given, the benefit cannot and should not be
withdrawn or negated. The benefit has no linkage or
connection with any Pay Commission. A pay revision can
be implemented in at least two manners. Firstly, ten (10)
increments can be given effect to in the new pay
dispensation.

Secondly,

the

erstwhile

pay

and

other

emoluments will have to be calculated in the new scale of
pay.

5.

As has already been noted above, the Petitioner's pay

on his re-employment with the CISF was fixed at Rs.3,000/-,
i.e., in the pay scale of Rs.2200-75-2800-100-4000 together
with ten (10) increments [75x8 and 100x2] equal to Rs.800.
As also noted above, the last pay drawn by the Petitioner in
the Army was in the pay scale of Rs.2300-100--100-3900EB-150-5100 and was Rs.3900. It is manifestly clear that
the Petitioner's pay in the CISF, after receiving the benefits
of 10 increments, did not exceed the basic pay last drawn
by him in the Armed Forces. It is important to record, and
keep in mind, that these scales were prescribed by the IVth
WP(C)14301/2004

Page 6 of 13

Pay Commission. The problem that has arisen before us is
a consequence of the implementation of the Vth Pay
Commission. We also record that it is not in dispute that
the Petitioner has served in the CISF for a period of 11
years. If his 10 years service in the Army is taken into
account, his total service is 21 years.

6.

As noted above, the Petitioner's grievances have

arisen consequent upon the implementation of the Vth Pay
Commission. It seems to us that it is unexceptional that pay
fixation must be carried out as per the Vth Pay Commission
only and that it is illogical to refer back to salaries payable
under the IVth Pay Commission. The Petitioner is entitled
to ten (10) advance increments as per Rule 8, reproduced
above, which continues to be in force even after the Vth
Pay Commission.

The basic pay as per the Vth Pay

Commission commences at Rs.8000/- and when ten (10)
increments are added thereto the Petitioner becomes
entitled to a monthly pay of Rs.10750/-. As per the
Respondent's computation the Petitioner's salary has been
increased from Rs.3000 to Rs.8000 only by virtue of the
WP(C)14301/2004

Page 7 of 13

implementation of the Vth Pay Commission. It is wholly
incongruent for the Respondents to take into reckoning the
Petitioner's last drawn salary of Rs.3900/- as per the IVth
Pay Commission. Rule 8 prescribes

that ECOs and SSCOs

(Emergency Commissioned Officers and Short Service
Commissioned
Government

Officers),
service,

on

would

their
be

appointment

entitled

to

in

advance

increments equal to the completed years of service
rendered by them in the Armed Forces on basic pay (which
in the Petitioner's case is 10 years) provided it does not
exceed the last drawn pay, would have to be seen in the
context of salaries payable under the Vth Pay Commission
itself.

In other words, apples cannot be compared with

pears. Accordingly, what has now to be determined is what
the Petitioner's last drawn pay would have been while he
was

serving

in

the

Indian

Army

had

the

Vth

Pay

Commission come into operation. The basic pay payable in
the Army is presently Rs.11,600, plus rank pay of Rs.1200,
plus

10

increments

(300x6

and

325x4)

=

Rs.3100,

aggregating Rs.15900. It is this figure of Rs.15900/- which
presently corresponds to the figure of Rs.3900/- in the IVth
WP(C)14301/2004

Page 8 of 13

Pay Commission. In other words, when pay fixation is to be
carried out in the Vth Pay Commission, the last drawn pay,
so far as the Petitioner is concerned, is not Rs.3900/- but
Rs.15900/-. It is manifestly evident, therefore, that the
Respondents have committed a calculation error in pegging
the basic pay of the Petitioner at Rs.8000/- only. If the
argument of the Respondents is to be accepted, the
Petitioner would not be entitled to receive even in the Vth
Pay Commission regime a salary beyond Rs.3900, which is
the last salary drawn by him in the Army.

7.

Mr. Puri, learned Senior Counsel for the Respondent,

has laid emphasis on Rule 5 of CCS (Revised Pay) Rules,
1997 which reads as under:
“5. Drawal of pay in the revised scales-Save as otherwise provided in these rules, a
Government servant shall draw pay in the revised
scale

applicable

to

the

post

to

which

he is

appointed.
Provided that a government servant may elect to
continue to draw pay in the existing scale until the
date on which he earns his next or any subsequent
increments in the existing scale or until he vacates
WP(C)14301/2004

Page 9 of 13

his post or ceases to draw pay in that scale.
EXPLANATION 1 – The option to retain the existing
scale under the proviso to this rule shall be
admissible only in respect of one existing scale.
EXPLANATION 2 – The aforesaid option shall not be
admissible to any person appointed to a post on or
after the 1st day of January, 1996 whether for the
first time in Government service, or by transfer or
promotion from another post and he shall be
allowed pay only in the revised scale”.

8.

We are unable to appreciate the manner in which this

Rule supports the fixation of pay presently carried out by
the Respondents. This is evidently so since even after
receiving ten (10) advance increments the Petitioner shall
not draw salary in the revised scale contrary to the post
which he is presently holding, since the maximum pay in
the present post is Rs.13500.

9.

Mr.

Puri

has

eloquently

contended

that

if

the

Petitioner receives benefits of 10 advance increments it will
cause imbalances in the salaries payable to the personnel in
the CISF and therefore heartburn and resentment in the
WP(C)14301/2004

Page 10 of 13

Force. One of the tests of this argument lies in comparing
the salaries payable to the Petitioner with the persons who
have put in the equal number of years of service, that is, 21
years. We may immediately note that the persons with
21years of service in the CISF would presently hold the
rank of Additional DIG, if not DIG and would be placed in a
higher scale of pay. It is not that the Petitioner has been
passed-over for promotion; so far as the rank is concerned
the Petitioner has suffered a disadvantage because of his
lateral movement from the Indian Army to the CISF.
Arguably, had the Petitioner continued to serve in the
Indian Army he could well be enjoying the rank of a
Brigadier. Therefore, it is unfair to contend that in
receiving ten (10) advance increments the Petitioner has
stolen a march, so far as salary is concerned, over other
officers in the CISF. Whereas the Petitioner would be
entitled, as per the calculation made above, to Rs.10750,
persons having served the CISF for 21 years would be
drawing salaries in the pay scale of Rs.16400-18300.
Furthermore, the Petitioner as well as other SSCOs,
comprises a class of their own, incomparable to those who
WP(C)14301/2004

Page 11 of 13

had not joined the Army. It is the Policy of the Government
to grant such persons certain benefits, and this Policy is not
under challenge before us. Seen from any angle, therefore,
the Petitioner has not been treated fairly and in accordance
with law.

10.

We would have appreciated the presence of the

Deponent, Shri S.P. Selven, Assistant IG (Personnel),
Directorate General of CISF during the hearings. We are
certain that he would not have been as obdurate as Shri
Ravinder

Kumar,

Accounts

Officer,

has

been

while

instructing learned Senior Counsel for the Respondents
before us.

The Respondents were in a position to clarify

the reasons, according to them, why disparate treatment is
justified in the case of Captain Parminder Singh and the
Petitioner.

11.

In this analysis we are of the opinion that the

Petitioner is entitled to receive ten (10) advance increments
in the present scale of Rs.8000-275-13500 as per the Vth

WP(C)14301/2004

Page 12 of 13

Pay

Commission

as

he

was

heretofore

drawing

in

accordance with the IVth Pay Commission. Consequent
relief be granted within ninety days failing which the
Petitioner shall additionally be entitled to receive interest
at the rate of twelve per cent per annum on arrears of pay.

12.

Petition is well-founded and is allowed. Petitioner

shall be entitled to costs which we quantify at Rs.10000/-.
