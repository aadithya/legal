The petitioner has filed this petition against the respondents
seeking appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
2

Briefly stated the facts of the case are as follow:The Border Security Force (hereinafter to be referred as the

Arb.P.No.438/2007

'BSF') had awarded a contract to respondent No. 1 for construction
of a school building at its Campus at Jalalabad, Firrozpur (Punjab).
Respondent No. 1 in turn had awarded a sub-contract to the
petitioner for execution of certain works in relation to construction
of the school building vide work order No. 178-A/WP-06/RNN/04
dated 24.07.2003.
3

After the work was completed by the petitioner, certain

disputes and differences arose between the parties regarding the
payment claimed by the petitioner under the aforementioned work
order.
4

Mr Pathak appearing on behalf of the respondents has not

disputed the existence of the arbitration agreement in the work
order dated 24.07.2003 awarded by respondent No. 1 to the
petitioner and he has also not disputed that the disputes and
differences have arisen between the parties under the said work
order which are required to be adjudicated through the process of
arbitration. The contention of Mr. Pathak appearing on behalf of the
respondents is that the present petition has become infructuous
since the arbitrator has already been appointed by the respondents
in terms of arbitration agreement between the parties. This
contention is of no consequence in view of judgments of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in ACE Pipeline Contracts (P) Ltd. Vs.
Arb.P.No.438/2007

Page 2 of 3

Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (2007) 5 SCC 304 and
Union of India Vs. Bharat Battery Manufacturing Co. (P) Ltd.
(2007) 7 SCC 684 because the respondents have lost their right to
appoint an arbitrator of their choice after filing of the petition
seeking appointment of arbitrator by the aggrieved party.
5

In view of the above and having regard to the facts and

circumstances of the case and the submissions made by the
learned counsel for the parties, Mr.

D.S.

Paweriya,

former

Additional District & Sessions Judge (Mobile No. 9810433390,

dated 05.05.2004. The fee of the learned arbitrator is fixed at Rs.
25,000/- to be shared equally by both the parties. The parties are
directed to appear before the learned Arbitrator for further
directions at 4.00 P.M. on 7.3.2008.
