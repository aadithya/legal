1.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order

dated 10th February, 2006 passed by the learned Single Judge
whereby the writ petition filed by the appellant was dismissed.
2.

The appellant applied under the Rohini MIG Residential

Scheme for allotment of a plot in 1981.

Vide allotment-cum-

demand letter bloc-dated 1st September, 2003 to 5th September,
2003, the appellant was informed that he has been allotted plot
bearing No.102, Pocket C-2, Sector 28, Rohini Phase – IV, Delhi
(LPA 974/2006)

Page 1 of 8

measuring 60.00 sq.mtrs in pursuance of computerised draw held
on 11th June, 2003, at a premium of Rs.3,71,520/-. As per the said
allotment-cum-demand letter the appellant was required to
deposit Rs.1,17,287/- by 4th November, 2003 and Rs.1,85,760/- by
3rd January, 2004 and Rs.55,728/- was to be deposited when
possession was to be offered by the DDA.
3.

It is an established fact that there was a delay of 175 days

and 115 days in making payment of the first and the second
instalments

respectively.

The

appellant

deposited

both

the

instalments at one go on 28th April, 2004. So far as the payment
of Rs.55,728/- is concerned, the appellant on his own without any
demand

had deposited an amount of Rs.55,000/-

September, 2004.

on 29th

A sum of Rs.36,600/- was also deposited by

the appellant on 25th October, 2004.
4.

Thereafter, on 3rd October, 2005 DDA issued a show cause

notice to the appellant stating that the competent authority has
decided not to restore the already cancelled allotment in favour of
the appellant on the ground that DDA has noticed deposit of
premium by as many as six different persons on behalf of the
appellant, which indicates sale of the plot by the appellant
unilaterally and in contravention of the terms and conditions of the
(LPA 974/2006)

Page 2 of 8

allotment.

The appellant was given an opportunity to file a reply

within 15 days from the date of issue of the said show cause
notice.

Finding the reply submitted by the appellant to be

unsatisfactory,

vide letter dated 13th December, 2005 the

allotment was cancelled by the competent authority.

The said

order was under challenge in the writ petition seeking issuance of
a writ of mandamus directing DDA to hand over the possession of
the said plot to the appellant.
5.

The learned Single Judge on perusal of the records noted

that the appellant did not deny deposit of payment by different
persons and sought to explain the same by stating that as he
remained out of Delhi for

long time due to the nature of his

business, his wife took the help of somebody, who also completed
the necessary formalities on her behalf. The learned Single Judge
also found that the character of the deposits was identical as in
WP(C)18854/2005, wherein also payment towards deposit of
premium on behalf of the appellant therein was made by different
persons residing at different localities. In the said case also the
DDA had cancelled the allotment, which was upheld by the learned
Single Judge holding that it is a highly improbable coincidence that
13 persons residing in 13 different colonies would go to the same
(LPA 974/2006)

Page 3 of 8

bank i..e South Indian Bank Ltd. for preparation of the pay orders
and deposit the same with the DDA. It was also noticed by the
learned Single Judge that the delay in making the payments in all
the aforesaid cases was not condoned by the DDA. Consequently,
considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
Single Judge dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant
herein.
6.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the present appeal

is filed on which we heard the learned counsel appearing for the
parties and have also perused the records placed before us.
7.

The learned counsel for the appellant challenged the

impugned judgment on the ground that the order of the DDA
dated 13th December, 2005 was prepared on 23th September,
2005, i.e. even before the issuance of show cause notice dated 3 rd
October, 2005 which indicates predetermination on the part of the
DDA to cancel his allotment. It was further contended that the
learned Single Judge ignored the fact that in order to prove the
identity and genuineness of the allottee, the appellant in
March/April 2005 has furnished original documents, with which the
DDA was satisfied.
8.

The learned counsel appearing for the DDA however refuted

(LPA 974/2006)

Page 4 of 8

all the allegations and submitted that it was clear that the
appellant in collusion with land mafia has sold the plot, which is
also evident from the fact that deposits towards premium were
made by different persons residing at different places through pay
orders issued by the same bank.
9.

In order to appreciate the contention of the appellant

regarding the date of

23rd September, 2005 mentioned in the

cancellation letter, which was scored off and the date of 3 rd
December, 2005 was written, we have perused the said letter and
reproduce the same below for ready reference:
“DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY

Sir,
This is in continuation of this office Show Cause
Notice of even No.19482 dt. 03/10/05 on the
subject cited above. Further I am directed to
inform you that the your reply dt.07/11/05 has not
been found satisfactory and allotment of plot
cancelled by the competent authority.
Your are, therefore, requested to submit the
following documents to facilitate the refund of
deposit as per rule.
.........”
In the aforesaid letter it is specifically mentioned that it is in
continuation of the Show Cause Notice dated 3rd October, 2005
and reply thereto by the appellant dated 7th November, 2005. If
the said letter by any chance would have been prepared on 23rd
September, 2005, it would not have in any case made a reference
to the subsequent Notice and the reply filed thereto. Thus in the
light of the aforesaid observation, we are in agreement with the
learned Singe Judge in accepting the submission of the DDA that
it was only a typographical error.
10.

Further,

as per the clause-9 of the demand-cum-

allotment letter, the said allotment was liable to be automatically
cancelled

if the payment was not made within the prescribed
In the instant case it is an admitted fact that there was a

delay of as many as 175 days and 115 days in payment of first
(LPA 974/2006)

Page 6 of 8

and the second instalments

respectively, thus resulting in

automatic cancellation the allotment made to the appellant. The
appellant has alleged that an amount of Rs.36,600/- was deposited
in lieu of interest for delay in payment of instalments and
restoration charges, but no document has been placed on record
whereby it could be shown that DDA had condoned the delay and
restored the allotment of plot to the appellant. Thus it can be said
that the aforesaid amount was deposited by the appellant on his
own and without any approval or confirmation from the DDA.
11.

Also, it cannot be denied that the said allotments are

made at pre-determined concessional rates. Such plots are
allotted to satisfy the residential needs of the general public and
not for the purpose of trading. The said fact was also noticed by
the learned Single Judge while dismissing the writ petition.

The

fact that the amounts were deposited by six different people
residing at different locations through pay orders issued by the
same bank lead to an inference that the said amounts were
deposited as a part of the sale consideration in respect of the plot
and not on behalf of the appellant.

It was also not the case of the

appellant that the plot could be sold without the permission of the
alloting authority before the said plot could be actually transferred
(LPA 974/2006)

Page 7 of 8

in

the name of the allottee.

On 27th September, 2007 the

appellant sought for an adjournment for the purpose of filing an
affidavit. However, the same was never filed.
12.

In light of the aforesaid observations, we are also of the

view that there was an un-condoned delay in deposit of the
instalments, resulting in automatic cancellation of allotment. Even
otherwise, on a careful consideration of the records,

the only

inference that can be drawn is that there appears to be collusion
with the land mafia. The learned Single Judge has rightly held that
the ultimate beneficiary would be the land mafia if the relief as
prayed for is granted. We accordingly find no justification to take
a different view than that taken by the learned Single Judge.
13.

We therefore find no infirmity in the impugned judgment

and order. There is no merit in this appeal. Accordingly the appeal
and the application are dismissed. Interim order dated 9th May,
2006 stands vacated.
