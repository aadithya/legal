1.

By these writ petitions, employees of the National Textile

Corporation (Delhi, Punjab & Rajasthan) Ltd. are impugning the action
of the respondents in offering Voluntary Retirement Scheme (hereinafter
referred to as 'VRS') to be implemented in 20 mills in violation of a
scheme of rehabilitation of several units of the National Textile
Corporation (`NTC' for short) which stands approved by the Board for
Industrial Financial Reconstructions (`BIFR' for short).

There is no

dispute to the factual matrix which is identical in both petitions and to
the extent necessary is noticed hereinafter. The prayers made in both the
writ petitions are identical and therefore they are being taken up together
for disposal.

It appears that on an issue relating to revision of wages of the

employees of NTC, a matter was pending before the Supreme Court of
India since 1997.

The National Textile Corporation (Delhi, Punjab &

Rajasthan) Limited (hereinafter referred to as NTCDPRL) made a
reference to the BIFR under Section 15(1) of the Sick Industrial
Companies (Special Provision) Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as
`SICA'). This company was declared sick under Section 3(o) of SICA on
15th April, 1994. The Industrial Development Bank of India (`IDBI' for
short) was appointed as an operating agency under Section 17(3). It
formulated a draft revival scheme and submitted the same to the Board
which was circulated on 17th December, 1994.
3.

In the meanwhile, a proposal was prepared by the Northern

India Textile Research Association (hereinafter referred to as “NITRA”)
at the behest of the Ministry of Textiles, Government of India and was
given approval by the BIFR on the 10th May, 1995.

The

respondent/NTCDPRL assailed this order passed by the BIFR in an
appeal before the Appellate Authority for Industrial & Financial
Reconstruction and the matter was remanded to the BIFR pursuant to the
order of the Appellate Authority in August, 1995.
4.

In these circumstances, this proposal also could not

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 3

materialise and a revised draft scheme was prepared by IDBI for the
subsidiaries and was circulated by BIFR in March, 1996. This scheme
could not be sanctioned mainly due to lack of Government of India, the
promoters, to give commitment to provide bridge finances.
Faced with a situation where no revival proposal was being
approved, the BIFR, at one stage, issued notice to show cause as to why
the NTCDPRL not be wound up. This show cause order was kept in
abeyance vide order dated 23rd March, 2001 in public interest. Finally, a
Draft Revival Scheme was closely scrutinised and was approved. The
summary record of the proceedings of the hearing held on 22nd February,
2002 contained the Scheme which was finally approved by the BIFR.
The clauses of scheme relevant to the issues raised before this court read
as under:“15. The MD of the NTCDPRL observed that the
company NTCDPRL would offer VRS in terms of the
GOI Notification dated 6.11.2001 to all the employees
of unviable mills and in the event of non-acceptance
of VRS, the compensation as per the Industrial
Disputes Act would be allowed, for which necessary
input would be made in the VRS offer. NTCDPRL
would also offer VRS for surplus labour of the
viable mills and had entered into an MoU with the
labour unions concenred in terms of Labour Law.
Shri K.M. Chadha for NTCHCL informed all
concerned that the VRS would be offered as per the
terms of the Notification of the GOI dated 6.11.2001
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 4

5.

and after the approval of the Government, they had
circulated the same to all the mills. He added that
earlier if a worker was to get Rs.100 as VRS, under
the new scheme he would get Rs.140-180 against the
same because earlier the formula for compensation
was based on 26 days in a month while in the new
scheme, thirty days average had been taken. The
labour would get the benefits accordingly as the
number of days had been increased. He also stated
that the option would be given to the workers to opt
for the VRS and if the workers would not opt for the
same, they would be paid as per the Industrial
Disputes Act norms. Further, the VRS would be
given to all the workers of unviable mills and the
mills to be closed and to the surplus workers of the
viable mills. He mentioned that no discrimination in
this regard would be done and a uniform policy would
be adopted for all the subsidiaries.”
It appears that on the 22nd February, 2002, a written

submission was also made by the NTCDPRL before the BIFR wherein it
was stated thus:“1. THAT, a Memorandum of Understanding has to
be reached between the workers/unions and the
management of mills of NTC (DP & R) Ltd, as per
Order dated 23.10.2001 circulated by BIFR forwarding
therewith Draft Rehabilitation Scheme to the applicant
company and the other concerned parties.
2. THAT, it was inter-alia envisaged in para 6(F) read
with para 7.01 (iv) of the DRS, that NTC (DP & R) Ltd.
should enter into MOU with workers/unions for
rationalization of labour, adoption of workload/
productivity norms, redeployment/transferability, VRS,
moratorium of wage revision, etc.
3.
THAT in pursuance of the aforesaid direction,
bilateral discussions were held between representative

Page 5

unions and the unit representatives of Kharar Textile
Mills, Kharar (Punjab), Suraj Textile Mills, Malout
(Punjab), Mahalakshmi Mills, Beawar (Rajasthan); Shre
Bijay Cotton Mills, Bijainagar (Rajasthan) and Udaipur
Cotton Mills, Udaipur, the five mills proposed for
revival and accordingly in the meetings held on
08.02.2002, 11.02.2002, 14.02.2002; 13.02.2002 and
27.12.2001 at respecive mills, the following agreeemnt
is reached between the management and the unions:i)
It is agreed that the various norms for
computation of workload for rationalization of
manpower, as laid down by NITRA/industry norms
will be adopted.

A prayer was made for approval of the rehabilitation scheme

of the NTCDPRL before the BIFR. In order to appreciate as to whether
any surplus labour existed in the mills which had been considered as
viable in the Scheme before the BIFR, it becomes necessary to examine
the reports submitted by the North India Textile Research Association
(NITRA) at the behest of NTCDPRL. This report included the norms for
computation of workload for rationalisation of manpower. The report
and modernisation proposal was given by the NITRA to NTCDPRL.
The BIFR has noticed that a Group of Ministers was constituted by the
Ministry of Textiles Act of the Government of India headed by the then
Finance Minister for revival of the sick NTCDPRL subsidies.

This

group had approved a project plan for revival of these subsidiaries. In
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 6

accordance with this approved project plan, the NTCDPRL had updated
the techno-economic viability studies and submitted an updated report to
NITRA for further scrutiny. The revival proposal was prepared by the
NTCDPRL based on the upto date reports vetted by NITRA submitted to
the IDBI in April, 2001. Extract of this report has been placed before
this court as well. Five mills were considered viable by all concerned.
In the modernisation proposal put forth the NITRA, the manpower
projections were projected thus:-

Viable Mills

Unviable Mills

Kharar Textile Mills, Kharar, Edward Mills, Beawar,
Punjab
Rajasthan
Suraj Textile Mills, Malaut,
Punjab

Dayalbagh Spinning &
Weaving Mills, Amritsar,
Punjab

Udaipur Cotton Mills,
Udaipur, Rajasthan

Panipat Woolen Mills,
Kharar, Punjab

Shri Bijay Cotton Mills,
Bijaynagar, Rajasthan

Ajudhia Mills, New Delhi.

Mahalaxmi Mills, Beawar,
Rajasthan

(i)

Kharar Textile Mills:The on-roll strength after modernisation has been reflected as

572 workers and it was stated that shortage of labour, if any, would be

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 7

managed by employing overtime and/or casual labourers.
(ii)

Suraj Textiles Mills:On roll strength of workers on 31st March, 2000 was noticed

as numbering 576. It was observed that shortage of labour, if any, would
be managed by employing overtime and/or casual labourers.

While

working out the on-roll strength required after modernisation, improved
work assignment have been adopted.
(iii)

Udaipur Cotton Mills:In this mill, against the existing on-roll strength on 31st

March, 2000 of 311 workers, the worker strength required after
modernisation of workers alone was projected as 680.
(iv)

Shree Bijay Cotton Mills:531 employees on its whole strength on its rolls as on 31 st

March, 2000. The strength as on 31st March, 2000 of workmen
(permanent and badli) were numbering 470. According to NITRA, since
the real strength has considerably reduced on account of superannuation
and resignation, fresh recruitment shall be required of the working force
to effectuate the modernisation.
(v)

Mahalakshmi Mills at Beawar (Rajasthan):As on 31st March, 2000, this mill had 330 workers on its

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 8

strength. The on-roll strength of workers required after modernisation
projected as 645 workers.
7.

The petitioner has relied on this modernisation proposal

submitted by NITRA which was placed before the BIFR.

The

projections have been noticed for the reason that it has been brought to
this court's notice that according to projections which formed the basis of
the draft scheme which was finally approved by the BIFR on 22nd
February, 2002, so far as the five viable mills of the NTCDPRL are
concerned, there was no surplus labour and NITRA had itself projected
that additional labour would be required.
8.

It is contended that the scheme of rehabilitation approved by

the BIFR has to be implemented and that the respondents have
unreasonably dragged their feet. Further, according to the petitioners,
the NTCDPRL is purporting to revise the approved scheme without any
sanction or permission thereof by the BIFR.
A letter dated 13th January, 2005 issued by the Ministry of
Textiles of the Government of India has been placed on record wherein it
was thus directed:“ No.18011/9/96-NTC

Dated the 13th January, 2005
OFFICE MEMORANDUM
Subject: Implementation of Rehabilitation Schemes of
NTC
Government
has
reviewed
the
rehabilitation schemes of NTC and with a view to take
the process forward, directed as follows:i)

VRS scheme should be introduced in
the 20 NTC mills where workers
have been asking for the same. If
majority of the employees opt for
VRS in these mills, they should be
closed under ID Act. An amount of
Rs.500 Cr. Required for VRS in these
mills should be mobilised by floating
government guaranteed Bonds.

ii)

A fully tied up, mill-wise proposal for
modernisation of 15 best performing
mills should be submitted for
consideration of Government.

iii)

In regard to the rest, VRS should
be introduced to reduce the surplus
workforce
following
Industry
standards. Simultaneously, offers
from reputed private entrepreneurs to
take over and modernise the mills
should be invited. The terms for such
a private partnership should need to
be carefully crafted to ensure
continuation of the mills while
preserving their asset base. The
response in this regard should be
reported to Government.

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 10

iv)

v)

NTC should be restructured into a
single Company by merging all the 9
subsidiaries with the Holding
Company.

vi)

9.

Sale of surplus land should be done
as per Consultants' advice in a way as
to maximize returns to NTC.

The budgetary support for meeting
the actual shortfall in wages of NTC
should be continued till completion of
the rehabilitation Scheme.

2.
NTC should take expeditious action on the
above decisions after taking approvals of BIFR,
wherever required and send monthly reports on
implementation of the above directions.”
It is noteworthy that this communication mandates that the

NTCDPRL was required to take expeditious action on the afore-stated
only after taking approvals of the BIFR wherever required.

The

NTCDPRL held a meeting of workers union of all the mills of the
company on the 27th January, 2005. In this meeting, the Chairman-cumManaging Director of the NTCDPRL presided over the meeting. So far
as the issues raised in the present writ petition are concerned, clause 7 of
the minutes of this meeting are important which reads as follows:“7. The CMD invited the attention of the Trade Union
representatives to the provisions of the BIFR Revival
Scheme where it is indicated to defer demand for any
wage revision and additional facilities/allowances,
except normal increase in quantum of DA consequent
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 11

upon increase in the price index/annual increments in
basic pay, at least during the implementation of the
scheme or till the respective units achieve break/even
level, whichever is later.
The CMD also added that the Trade Unions had entered
into an agreement with the management to the effect
that during the implementation period there will be
no wage revision. He wanted that if modernisation is
undertaken, the work load of the employees have to be
revised as per the BIFR norms. In respect of KTM and
STM, it was informed that the percentage of net
contribution to wages is around 20% whereas in the case
of other 3 mills it is just 5-10% only and the remaining
amount for the wages are provided by the Govt. by way
of budgetary support. The CMD also informed that in
any case an integrated scheme in respect of the proposed
revised scheme, will be submitted to the BIFR for its
approval and that there are only two options before the
Company either to agree for the revised scheme or the
option may, perhaps before the winding of the Company
by the BIFR in case the Revival Scheme does not
succeed.
However, after the opinions by Trade Unions, there was
a general consensus among the representatives and
requested the management that the notice of MVRS be
displayed in all the five mills of NTC (DP & R) Ltd., so
that those employees who want to go may go under the
MVRS. The response of the Trade Unions to the MVRS
notice will also become more clear, once it is notified.
The Trade Unions were unanimous in their opinion that
in the absence of any wage revision, it is better to offer
MVRS and it is not necessary to discuss the same with
the Trade Unions. It was, therefore, finally decided that
their request will be favorably considered by the
management and MVRS notice will be put up in all
the five mills once the matter is taken up with the
BIFR.”

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 12

10.

It is, therefore, explicit that so far as the proposal of offering a

Modified Voluntary Retirement Scheme (`MVRS' for short) to the
workers in the five mills which are viable is concerned, the same was to
be proceeded with only once the matter had been taken up with the
BIFR.
11.

Without filing any proceedings before the BIFR to seek its

approval with regard to the modification proposed by the NTCDPRL, in
a purported effort to assess the response of the workers in the five viable
mills, vide a letter dated 9th February, 2005 issued by the General
Manager (Technical) of the NTCDPRL, it was communicated to the five
mills that “it had been decided that MVRS would be put up in all the
mills to assess the response, subject to obtaining approval of the
BIFR”.
12.

There can be no dispute that any proposal received or any

action taken by the NTCDPRL which was not in consonance with the
sanctioned scheme was subject to obtaining prior approval of the BIFR.
13.

Concerned with the dilution of the revival scheme which was

sanctioned by the BIFR on 22nd February, 2002, the National Federation
of NTC Employees addressed a letter dated 22nd March, 2005 to the
BIFR stating that the Government of India was acting in contravention of
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 13

the Scheme and was proceeding for revival only 15 mills and closure of
the remaining. It was pointed out that the Scheme to modernise and
revive the viable mills was approved by the Cabinet of the Union
Government in its meeting held on 4th September, 2000. It was based on
this approval, the BIFR had sanctioned the Scheme on the earlier
occasion. The Cabinet is stated to have approved the scheme after a unit
by unit assessment and that only non-revivalable units would be closed.
An attractive VRS option was to be made available to the surplus
employees only.
14.

According to the National Federation of NTC Employees, the

NTC had not induced any funds for modernisation during the last three
years to effectuate implementation of the approved revival scheme and,
therefore, it could not have possibly treated any mill as non-viable.

It

was also pointed out that this VRS option was being made against the
threat of closure of the mill and as a result their workmen would not be
exercising a free option who may accept the offer of the VRS proposal
under the threat of closure of the mill. Large number of workmen would
opt for such a scheme in order to have financial security. Resultantly, on
the sole ground of want of a workforce, NTCDPRL could plead that it
had become necessary to close the mills.

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 14

Reliance was placed on an order dated 8th December, 2004 in
Case No.535/1992 entitled M/s NTC (Gujarat) Limited passed by the
BIFR holding that neither the holding company nor any other authority
had any jurisdiction to deviate from rehabilitation scheme sanctioned by
the BIFR.
15.

Faced with objections from workers in respect of the VRS

option to workers in different viable mills, the NTCDPRL was left with
no option but to make an application before the BIFR dated 8th April,
2005 wherein it was stated thus:“8. Considering the constraints stated in Para 6 above
and the performance of the mills, it is proposed that the
rehabilitation process is best carried forward in the
following manner:
i)

xxx

ii)

16.

xxx
xxx

xxx

xxx

iii)
Wherever workers have been demanding for
VRS, it should be allowed. Accordingly, VRS Scheme
should be introduced in the 19 mills which were
earlier proposed for revival.”
On these averments, the NTC had made the following prayer

before the BIFR:“Closure of additional 19 mills after giving the
benefits under VRS to the employees as in Para 8(iii)
and to
xxx
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 15

17.

There is no dispute that even at the time of hearing of this writ

petition, this application of the NTCDRL is pending before the BIFR and
no steps have been taken to get the same listed and heard.
18.

In the meantime, on the 20th April, 2005, the General Manager

(Technical) of the NTCDPRL addressed a letter dated 20th April, 2005 to
the General Manager of all the five viable mills. The material contents in
this communication which throws much light on the intent of the
NTCDPRL read as follows:“ Trade Unions of our units met the Chairman and
Managing Director, NTC Ltd. on 19.4.05 wherein the
discussion was held on the issue of MVRS. In this
context, reproduced below is the extract from OM
No.18021/8/2002-NTC dated 24.3.2005 from the
Ministry of Textiles on the issue of MVRS:The number of applications for VRS are pending
and employees are seeking relief. Since NTC has got
money for expending on VRS, VRS should be given to
whoever applies.......
Further, you may also recall the discussions
held in the meeting of the General Managers on
15.4.2005 whereby it had been advised that the General
Managers should call all the unions and convey that
workmen desirous of availing VRS should submit their
applications to the management for consideration. The
discretion of approval will rest with the Management
dependent upon the nature of post and its necessity/or
otherwise.”
19.

Faced with an almost `fait accompli' situation and

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 16

apprehending the consequences of the VRS option being offered,
accepted and implemented, the petitioners rushed to this court with the
writ petition being WP (C) No.9887-9891 of 2005 on 27th May, 2005
seeking the following prayers:
“a)
quashing and setting aside the office
memorandum dated 13th January, 2005 issued by
Respondent No.4;
b)
quashing and setting aside letter dated 20th
April, 2005 issued by Respondent no.1 offering
Modified Voluntary Retirement Scheme to the workers
of the viable mills of NTC (DP&R) Ltd.:
c)
quashing and setting aside the Modified
Voluntary Retirement Scheme being offered by
Respondent no.1 to the workers of viable mills of NTC
(DP & R) Ltd.
d)
restraining
the
respondents
from
implementing the Modified Voluntary Retirement
Scheme offered to the workers by office memorandum
dated 13th January, 2005 and 20th April, 2005; and any
subsequent action.
e)
granging such other and further relief and
passing such and further orders as may be necessary in
the facts of the case; and
f)
20.

Awarding cost of this petition.”

So far as the prayers (a) to (c) are concerned, there is no

dispute that the same would require consideration by the BIFR and that
the application of the respondent in this behalf is pending even on date.

21.

The respondents had entered appearance on advance copy in

answer to notice to show cause. The respondents have placed a detailed
counter affidavit on record. In the counter affidavit filed before this
court, so far as the Modified Voluntary Retirement Scheme is concerned,
the respondents stated thus:“2.13

22.

That MVRS applications received from
workmen/employees of these five Mills
indicate that while a significant majority of
the employees of these Mills have made
requests for MVRS, the Respondent has not
acceded to the request of all these
employees.
It has in f act acting in
accordance with the mandate of the
sanctioned scheme which also, as noticed
hereinabove, permits the respondent No.1 to
grant MVRS to employees of these five
Mills. The Respondent submits that its
actions of course are subject to the final
outcome
of
the
application
for
modification of the scheme itself made by
Respondent No.2 before the learned BIFR.
The very fact that these Mills are continuing
to function smoothly, indicates that the
Respondent No. 1 has been judicious in
exercising
its
discretion
in
allowing/accepting the MVRS requests.
(Chart indicating the Muster Roll/MVRS
position in the five Mills is annexed hereto
and marked as ANNEXURE-2).

The counter affidavit filed on 9th September, 2005 shows that

the respondents had taken a stand that there was no indiscriminate
acceptance of applications made by the workmen for seeking voluntary
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 18

retirement and that according to the respondents, the mills are actually
functioning even on date.
23.

During the pendency of this writ petition, the Government of

India has addressed a letter dated 7th September, 2005 to the Chairman
and Managing Director of the NTC holding company. It was stated in
this letter that despite the letter of the Government of India dated 24th
March, 2005 directing that the VRS should be given to all the employees
of the NTCDPRL who desired to avail of this scheme, workers have been
approaching the Ministry seeking direction to NTC to extend the facility
of VRS to them. In these circumstances, the Government directed as
hereunder:“

xxx

xxx

xxx

xxx

3.
In accordance with the instructions of Govt.
in the matter, you are requested to take immediate
action for giving VRS in these mills and to ensure relief
of such workers with effect from 30.9.2005. It may be
noted that the amount released by the Government for
meeting wage shortfall in NTC should not be spent on
these mills w.e.f. 1.10.2005.
4.
Action taken in this regard may be intimated
immediately.”
24.

The directions of the Government of India have been

effectuated by the respondent no.1 in view of the afore-stated
communications and notices. So far as the proposal to offer Voluntary
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 19

Retirement Scheme is concerned, the NTCDPRL itself on 8th April, 2005
wrote to the BIFR to the effect that:“the Government of India, Ministry of Textiles, has, on
review of the Rehabilitation Scheme of NTC, taken
certain decisions. These decisions, on implementation,
would result in the modification of the approved
Revival Scheme.
The proposal also includes
restructuring of NTC into a single company by merging
all the 9 Subsidiary Corporations with the Holding
Company.”
Herein is to be found the Government understanding of the
impact of its actions.
25.

It has also been brought to notice that the present Voluntary

Retirement Scheme contains several benefits which are beyond the
benefits available to a workman under the normal voluntary schemes. I
find that the respondent had a Voluntary Retirement Scheme dated 26th
March, 1992 whereunder the following benefits were available:“4.1
An employee whose offer for voluntary
retirement is accepted, shall be entitled to the following
benefits:
(a)

Balance in his Provident Fund Account
payable as per Employees Provident Fund
Act and rules made thereunder.

(b)

Cash equivalent of accumulated earned
leave/privilege leave as per the rules of the
mills/office, concerned.

(c)

Gratuity as per Payment Act or the Gratuity

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 20

Scheme, if any.
(d)

26.

Ex-gratia payment equivalent to one and a
half month (1-1/2 months) emoluments (pay
+ DA/VDA and IR, whichever admissible)
for each completed year of service or the
monthly emoluments at the time of voluntary
retirement multiplied by the remaining
months of service before normal date of
retirement, whichever is lower.”
Against this, the Modified Voluntary Retirement Scheme

being offered to the workmen by the NTCDPRL provides the following:“3.0 BENEFITS UNDER THE SCHEME
An employee whose offer for Modified
Voluntary Retirement is accepted, shall be entitled to the
compensation, details of which are given in the
succeeding paragraphs.
Modified Voluntary Retirement Scheme (MVRS):3.1.1 Ex-gratia payment equivalent to 35 days
for every completed year of service and 25
days for the balance of service left until
superannuation. The compensation will be
subject to a minimum of Rs.2,5000/- or 250
days salary whichever is higher. However,
this compensation shall not exceed the sum
of the salary that the employee would draw at
the prevailing level for the balance of the
period left before superannuation.
3.1.2 The Additional Ex-gratia compensation
payable to an employees shall be as under:(i)
There thre was no wage
revision
after
1.1.87
additional
compensation of 100% of the eligible

(ii)
Where there was no wage
revision
after
1.1.92
additional
compensation of 50% of the eligible Exgratia amount as per para 3.1.1.
3.1.3 Salary for purpose of VRS will consist of

will be paid @ 35 days for every completed

remaining service irrespective of minimum
requirement of 240 days service in a year (as

their names are borne on the muster roll of
the mill.”
27.

The difference between two schemes is glaring and the

Modified Voluntary Retirement Scheme offers much more financial
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 22

benefits than the Voluntary Retirement Scheme which was in vogue.
28.

Apart from this submission in law to the effect that the

respondents had no power to modify a sanctioned scheme which had the
approval of the BIFR or to implement it, I find force in the submission of
learned counsel for the petitioners to the effect that the most material
difference in the schemes for voluntary retirement otherwise offered and
the present scheme is that the respondents had stipulated that a post
falling vacant as a result of an employee's Voluntary Retirement Scheme
under the scheme would stand abolished simultaneously. Stipulation to
this effect is to be found in clause

5 of the Modified Voluntary

Retirement Scheme which reads thus:
“ 5.0 PROCEDURE
5.1

An eligible employee may submit an
application in the prescribed form for
voluntary retirement under the scheme by
tendering resignation from the post held and
service in NTC to the Competent Authority.
The post falling vacant as a result of an
employee's voluntary retirement under the
scheme shall in all cases stand abolished
simultaneously while accepting resignation
and order to that effect issued simultaneously
before disbursing retirement benefits to
employees under this scheme and no person
(Permanent /badli /substitute /temporary, etc.
shall be engaged in his/her place.

5.2

The abolition of a vacant post shall not be

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 23

29.

treated as a substitute for abolition for an
occupied post. In exceptional cases and for
reasons to be recorded in writing a
corresponding manned post (Not vacant post)
can also be abolished. Orders to the effect
shall be issued before accepting resignation
and disbursing retirement benefits.”
I find that the VRS option being offered by the respondent

no.1 does not contain any of the nuances of the usual Voluntary
Retirement Scheme where the result of the retirement is not abolition of
the post.
30.

There can therefore be no dispute that the spirit, intendment

and purpose of the respondents in implementing the Modified Voluntary
Retirement Scheme is to reduce the work force irrespective of whether
they are or are not surplusage even in the five viable mills, without
drawing any distinction between the viable and unviable mills. Wielding
the “stick” of the threatened closure and dangling the “carrot” of the
huge monetary benefits before the workmen, the purpose is to induce the
workers into opting for the VRS to facilitate and effectuate mill closure.
31.

The impact of the offer for VRS is to be found in the figures

placed by the respondents before this court which are as follows:-

It is, therefore, apparent that the employees have been

pursuaded by the threat of closure of the mills and have post haste
accepted the offer communicated by the respondents. The offer by the
respondents itself was required to state that the offer was subject to the
orders by the BIFR as was stipulated by the Government of India in its
letters dated 13th January, 2005 and 27th January, 2005. The only reason
for putting up the notice for the VRS is to be found in the
communication dated 9th February, 2005. Such notice was to be put up
only to assess the response of the workmen to such proposal for VRS
subject to obtaining prior approval of the BIFR. In its communication
dated 20th April, 2005, the NTC had reserved the right to grant approval
on the VRS application of the workmen in its absolute discretion.
34.

In the counter affidavit filed before this court, the respondents

have unequivocally stated that the action is subject to outcome of the
proceedings before the BIFR. The respondents itself understood the
impact of the exercise of the VRS option by the employees on its
modification and revival proposals.
35.

There is no order passed by the BIFR till date modifying the

original scheme, the scheme which was sanctioned by it on 22nd
February, 2005.

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 26

36.

I find that the proceedings were pending before the Apex

Court at that time and an order dated 27th September, 2003 passed by the
Apex Court in SLP (Civil) No.16732 of 1997 wherein the following
order was passed by the court:“O R D E R
UPON hearing counsel the Court made the following:Intervention application is dismissed.
We have been informed that BIFR has
already formulated eight schemes which stand approved
by all concerned and agencies. Let the schemes as
sanctioned by BIFR be implemented. The special
leave petition and the transfer petitions stand disposed
of accordingly.”
37.

The respondents are bound by the directions given by the

Apex Court to the effect that the eight schemes sanctioned by the BIFR
are required to be implemented.
38.

The Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985

has been enacted with the object of extensive proceedings which
conducted to examine the possible revival of a company which has
complained that its net worth stands eroded and it is unable to make
profit consistently.

The issue as to whether financial sacrifices are

required to be made by financial institutions, banks etc, in order to
facilitate revival of the company or the appropriateness of directing its
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 27

winding up are considered by the BIFR before orders are passed in this
behalf. An operating agency is appointed which formulates schemes
which are before the Board. Once a scheme has the approval of the
BIFR, the statute itself contains the effect of non-implementation thereof.
Relevant extract of Section 18 and 32 of the statute read as follows:“18.
Preparation and sanction of schemes – (1)
Where an order is made under sub-section (3) of
Section 17 in relation to any sick industrial company,
the operating agency specified in the order shall
prepare, as expeditiously as possible and ordinarily
within a period of ninety days from the date of such
order, a scheme with respect to such company
providing for any one or more of the following
measures, namely :(2)
xxxx
(3)
xxxx
(4)
The scheme shall thereafter be sanctioned,
as soon as may be, by the Board (hereinafter referred to
as the 'sanctioned scheme') and shall come into force on
such date as the Board may specify in this behalf.
(5)
The Board may on the recommendations of
the operating agency or otherwise, review any
sanctioned scheme and make such modifications as it
may deem fit or may by order in writing direct any
operating agency specified in the order, having regard
to such guidelines as may be specified in the order, to
prepare a fresh scheme providing for such measures as
the operating agency may consider necessary.
32. Effect of the Act on other laws- (1) The
provisions of this Act and of any rules or schemes made
thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything
inconsistent therewith contained in any other law
except the provisions of the Foreign Exchange
Regulation Act, 1973 (46 of 1973) and the Urban Land
(Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 (33 of 1976) for the
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 28

time being in force or in the Memorandum or Articles
of Association of an industrial company or in any other
instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than
this Act.
(2) Where there has been under any scheme under this
Act an amalgamation of a sick industrial company with
another company, the provisions of section 72A of the
Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961) shall, subject to the
modifications that the power of Central Government
under that section may be exercised by the Board
without the Central Government under that section may
be exercised by the Board without any recommendation
by the specified authority referred to in that section,
apply in relation to such amalgamation as they apply in
relation to the amalgamation of a company owning an
industrial undertaking with another company.”
39.

Perusal of the scheme placed before the BIFR shows that the

minutes of the meeting between the trade union and the respondents
show that the workmen have sacrificed wage revision for several years in
order to facilitate modernisation of the five viable mills. The petitioners
have claimed that upon sanction of the scheme, the workers have vested
rights for revival of the five viable mills.
40.

The bindingness of the scheme which has the sanction and

approval of the BIFR fell for consideration before the Apex Court in the
judgment reported at (2001) 10 SCC 291 entitled Government of AP &
Others Vs. V.S.R. Murthy & Others wherein the Court held as under:-.
“19.
Whether absorption of the employees by the
Government would be a drain on the public exchequer
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 29

was a matter certainly present to the mind of the
Government before taking various steps culminating in
the Scheme sanctioned by BIFR. In trying to solve
various steps culminating in the Scheme sanctioned by
BIFR.
In trying to solve various problems, the
Government has to balance several interests and devise
methods to suit the needs of the situation. In the present
case, when certain industries had become “sick” and a
large number of employees were likely to be uprooted
and thus a human problem arose, the Government
sought to work out certain solutions which resulted in a
scheme framed by BIFR, now to say that such a Scheme
could not have been framed and that Scheme would
affect the rights of the other employees of the
Government or likely to affect the finances of the
Government is only the result of unimaginative narrow
thinking on the part of the Government by relying on
bureaucracy used to the usual red tapism. To depend
upon the reports of the bureaucracy, which cannot take
decision of such large magnitude involving human
problem, would only indicate that the realities of the
matter are ignored. It is only after due deliberation and
after considering the financial and administrative
implications the previous orders of the Government had
been passed leading to a scheme framed by BIFR which
has not been duly appreciated in the proper perspective
by the Government. Hence, challenge to the order of
BIFR made on 12.5.1999 is unsustainable. In that view
of the matter, if the Government was merely guided by
the reports of the bureaucracy and not on the ground
realities and thereafter the ordinance has been
promulgated under a misconception thinking it would be
applicable to the present employees, we think, the
attempt of the Government has misfired.”
41.

In 109 (2004) DLT 504 (DB) entitled Biogenics India

Limited VS. B.I.F.R. and Ors., the Division Bench of this court held as
follows:WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 30

42.

“ In view of the afore-noted background facts, wer are
of the view that the BIFR was fully justified in
declining to grant further time to the petitionercompany to deposit Rs. 145 lacs. A rehabilitation
scheme sanctioned under the Act binds the Industrial
Company, the promoters and the creditors and in the
nature of a contract. If one of the participants in the
scheme fails to discharge his obligation, the entire
scheme falls apart.”
The consequences of violating the terms of the scheme entails

a stringent penalty including imprisonment which are to be found under
Section 33 of this enactment.
43.

I have no manner of doubt and hold that the respondent have

no authority or jurisdiction to vary or modify a scheme of revival
sanctioned by the BIFR. The action of the respondent no.1 in acting
upon the modification proposal without BIFR approval is wholly in
contravention of law.
44.

Learned counsel appearing for the respondents has contended

that though the scheme stipulated that surplus labour in the viable mills
could be offered the VRS, the scheme did not provide as to which
workman was surplus and who was not. It has further been urged that in
this view of the matter, the writ petition raises disputed questions of fact
as to who was surplus and who was not. According to Mr. Ghose,
learned counsel for the respondent no.1, these questions cannot be
agitated before this court.
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 31

45.

I have noticed hereinabove the reports submitted by NITRA

which was relied upon by the NTCDPRL for formulating the scheme
which was placed before the BIFR and which was sanctioned on the 22nd
February, 2005. The NITRA, after a detailed consideration, set out the
projection which has been noticed in the preceding paragraphs. No
workman was found to be a surplusage in the five viable mills. The
respondent no.1 acted on this report and the scheme of revival based
thereon was approved by the BIFR.
46.

This court is not being required to examine any issue as to the

identification of surplus labour. There is no dispute that the respondents
have restricted the VRS option to only surplus labour in the five mills
which were viable. Indiscriminately the option has been made available
to all workmen.
47.

For this reason, in my view, there are no disputed questions of

facts which require adjudication. For this reason, I find no force in the
submissions made before this court.

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 32

48.

In contradistinction to the previous submissions and the

counter affidavit filed before this court, the respondents have now in the
oral submissions urged before this court that hundred of workers came
up for exercising the VRS option and a vested right has accrued in their
favour.
49.

I find that in this behalf, the Government of India had itself

directed in the communication noted above, that the offer was to be made
subject to outcome of the proceedings before the BIFR. In my view, it
was not open for the NTC to have accepted any offers which are in
violation of the sanctioned scheme and also in violation of the specific
government directive in this behalf.
50.

This court is not being called upon to adjudicate upon the

legality, validity or the correctness of the modification proposed by the
respondents in the sanctioned scheme. Undoubtedly, applications in this
behalf are pending before the BIFR and that the jurisdiction with regard
to the schemes or its modification lies wholly within the scope of the
proceedings before the BIFR. It is made clear that nothing contained
herein is any expression on the relative merit or demerit of any aspect of
the modification sought by the respondents in the sanctioned scheme.
51.

On a query by the court, learned counsel for the respondents

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 33

had submitted that in the event of otherwise effecting closure of the mill,
the NTCDPRL would be required to comply with the provisions of
Section 25 FF of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. It is admitted that
the financial liability of the respondents under this statutory provision is
more onerous as compared to the VRS option being given to the
workmen.
52.

Looked at from any angle, there can be no manner of doubt

that large number of workmen exercising the voluntary retirement option
would have the result of non-availability of a work force which is
essential for running a mill. The direct and inevitable result of such an
exercise would be closure of the mill.
53.

The view I have taken is fortified by a judgment of the

Division Bench of the High Court of Gujarat in Letters Patent Appeal
No.2500/2004 entitled National Textile Corporation (Gujarat) Limited
Vs. NTC Mills Technicians and Officers Staff Union (Gujarat) & Ors.
It appears that in circumstances similar to those of the respondent no.1 in
the present case, the National Textile Corporation (Gujarat) Limited
(`NTCGL' for short) is before the Board for Industrial and Financial
Reconstruction (BIFR) in case No.335 of 1992 under the Sick Industrial
Companies (Special Provisions)Act, 1985. The NTCGL had a large

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 34

number of units which were not viable and the BIFR came to the
conclusion that out of them, only two units viz. Ahmedabad New Textile
Mills, Ahmedabad and Rajnagar Textile Mills were required to be
revived and other mills of the Company were required to be closed down.
The BIFR, accordingly, passed the rehabilitation scheme on 19.2.2002
for revival and rehabilitation of the aforesaid two units of the NTCGL.
During the pendency of the rehabilitation proceedings before the BIFR,
the Managing Director of the NTCGL issued notices for Modified
Voluntary Retirement Scheme (MVRS) on 22nd and 29th September, 2004
offering Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) to all the workers of the
aforesaid two units also.
54.

This action of the NTCDPRL was challenged by the workmen

on issues similar to the issues raised before this court in a writ petition.
The learned Single Judge of the High Court of Gujarat had held in favour
of the workmen and had directed the NTCGL to approach the BIFR by
filing an application for obtaining a decision on the issues as to whether
VRS or MVRS scheme was to be operated by the NTCGL before the
different mills. A writ of prohibition was issued by the learned Single
Judge against the NTCHCL not to act upon the option furnished by the
workmen for VRS without prior permission of the court. Inter alia it was

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 35

directed.
...
that the NTCGL shall approach the BIFR by filing an
application before the BIFR for obtaining the decision of the BIFR on the
question of VRS or MVRS scheme to be operated by the NTCGL qua the
employees of Ahmedabad New Textile Mills, Ahmedabad and Rajnagar
Textile Mills.;
...
directed the NTCGL not to act upon the options furnished by
the workmen for VRS without prior permission of the Court and directed
that the restriction shall operate for a period of four weeks from the date
of the order which order came to be passed on 4.11.2004;
...
and clarified that such injunction shall not weigh with the
BIFR at the time of considering the application of the NTCGL or the
workmen's association/unions and the BIFR shall decide the matter on
merits in accordance with law.
55.
These directions of the learned Single Judge were impugned
before the Division Bench which rejecting the challenge, observed as
follows:“ 7.
Having heard the learned counsel for the
parties, it appears to us that when the BIFR is still
seized of the matter, the appellants cannot be permitted
to do anything which would come in the way of
effective implementation of the rehabilitation scheme
sanctioned by the BIFR on 19.2.2002 in respect of the
Ahmedabad New Textile Mills and Rajnagar Textile
Mills.
Mr. Nanavati's submission, that any such
clarification is not warranted, cannot be accepted
because the BIFR has specifically observed in para 7 of
its summary record of proceedings of the hearing held
on 8.12.2004 that neither the Company, NTCGL, nor
the holding Company, NTCHCL, had any authority
under the law to deviate from the rehabilitation scheme
sanctioned on 19.2.2002 by the Board, which was a
quasi-judicial authority.
The Bench directed the
Company/GOI to ensure that the number of workers in
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 36

the Ahmedabad New Textile Mills and Rajnagar Textile
Mills does not fall below 641 and 634 respectively as
per the approved sanctioned scheme and after maing
aforesaid observations, the BIFR specially directed
issuance of notice under Sections 33 and 34 of the Sick
Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 to
the Managing Director of the NTCGL to show cause
why action should not be taken against him for issuing
the MVRS notices dated 22.9.200 and 29.9.2004
offering VRS to all the workers, instead of only to the
workers of those departments/streams where surpluses
had been identified.
8.
Without making any observations on the
issue/s pending before the BIFR, it would be
incongruous to hold that the NTCGL can still implement
the notices dated 22.9.2004 and 29.9.2004 and act upon
the options furnished by the employees, which process
would result into a large number of employees leaving
the aforesaid two units of the NTCGL, more particularly
when the NTCGL has not even given any letter or
undertaking to the BIFR to the effect that not less than
641 and 634 workers would continue to be employes as
per the rehabilitation scheme for the above two units of
the NTCGL and that the vacancies created, if any,
would be filled through new recruitment.

56.

9.
We, therefore, see no merit in this appeal in
so far as it challenges the two orders of the learned
Single Judge - the order dated 4.1.2004 in SCA
No.14445 of 2004 and the order dated 31.1.2005 in
MCA No.104 of 2005.”
In this view of the matter, I find no force in the submissions

made by the respondent no.1. A plea has been urged that the VRS option
has been made available to the workmen only after full consideration of
the cost benefit to the workmen as well as the concerned industry. It has
WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 37

been submitted that public funds are at stake and that any prohibition in
implementing the VRS would have grave consequences.
57.

I have noticed that the respondent was aware that it could not

have modified the sanctioned scheme without approval of the BIFR. The
Government of India was also aware of this requirement in law and had
clearly notified the respondent to this effect as back as on 13th January,
2005. The respondents have filed an application before the BIFR on 8th
April, 2005. Though it is stated that the BIFR was not functioning at that
time, however, it is admitted before this court that the BIFR had started
functioning since June, 2005. In case there was such grave expediency
in implementing the VRS, the respondents would have ensured hearing
in this application.
58.

I find that WP (C) No.9887-91/2005 are pending before this

court since as back as on 30th May, 2005. Still the respondents have not
been persuaded to act in accordance with law. The mandate of the
statute is clear and unambiguous. The respondents cannot avoid the
same on any pleas whatsoever.
59.

Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the Apex Court in

AIR 1977 SC 898 (para 4) entitled Jai Singh Vs. UOI & Others.; AIR
1996 SC 691 entitled Executive Engineer, Bihar State Housing Board

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 38

Vs. Ramesh Kumar Singh & Others & 2002 V AD (Delhi) 690 entitled
Sree Kumar R. Vs. Union of India & Another, an argument was also
raised on behalf of the respondent no.1 that the petitioner has filed an
application before the BIFR and it has an alternative efficacious remedy
and consequently, should be non-suited.
60.

It is well settled that availability of an alternative remedy is a

rule of convenience and is not an absolute prohibition to exercise of writ
jurisdiction. In the instant case, in the face of the scheme for revival
being sanctioned as back as on 22nd February, 2002 by the BIFR, the
respondents were bound by the same. Any violation of the scheme
amounts to violation of the provisions of Section 32 of the SICA. The
respondents have also accepted this position and had moved an
application before the BIFR which is pending.
61.

The apprehension of the petitioners are fully justified in the

light of the figures placed before this court by the respondents in terms of
the number of persons who have been permitted to exercise the VRS
option. The effect of such acceptance is inevitable and would have
drastic consequences on persons who are unwilling to accept this option.
The financial consequences of implementing the VRS option are as
drastic as the apprehension expressed by the respondents in case the

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 39

implementation of the scheme was delayed. 24. The NTC is stated to be
a holding company with eight subsidiaries.

Eight schemes were

sanctioned for the eight units/subsidiaries.
62.

Perusal of the scheme approved on 22nd February, 2002 would

show that the revival scheme was arrived at after obtaining extreme
sacrifices by the financial instructions and other several concerns. These
are public funds sacrificed to revive the respondent no.1. So far as
Delhi, Punjab & Haryana were concerned, it was even agreed that lands
of unviable units would be sold and the funds be provided to viable
units.
63.

The action of the respondents without appropriate orders by

the BIFR, is wholly illegal and without jurisdiction and, therefore,
assuming that the petitioners had available an alternative efficacious
remedy, the present writ petition cannot be held to be not maintainable.
64.

The prayers made at serial nos. (a), (b) & (c) are wholly

within the purview of the application to be considered by the BIFR. As
such, no order is being passed in respect thereof in the present writ
petitions.
65.

There is no prayer (d) in the writ petition. However, in prayer

(e), the petitioners have prayed for an appropriate order restraining the

WP (C) No.18596-536/2005

Page 40

respondents from implementing the Modified Voluntary Retirement
Scheme offered to the workers by the Office Memorandum dated 13th
January, 2005 and 20th April, 2005.
In view of the position in law, this prayer would deserve to be
granted but restricted till consideration and orders by the BIFR on the
application filed by the respondent no.1 dated 8th April, 2005.
66.

Accordingly, the respondents are prohibitted from taking

further action upon the option exercised by the workmen for the
VRS/MVRS without prior permission of the BIFR or till any order is
passed by the BIFR either on the application dated 8th April, 2005 of the
respondent no.1 or otherwise.
67.

It is made clear that nothing contained in the present

judgment shall weigh with the merits of the contentions made before the
BIFR in support of or against the proposed modification to the revival
scheme and the same shall be decided by the BIFR on the merits of the
materials laid before it by the concerned parties and submissions made
before it in accordance with law.
These writ petitions are, accordingly, allowed to the aforestated extent.
There shall be no order as to costs.
