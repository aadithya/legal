As the issue involved in these appeals are identical, we

propose to dispose of the same by this common judgment.
2.

Pursuant to the directions of the Supreme Court in a public

interest litigation, in the year 1996, Department of Industries,
Government of NCT of Delhi devised a Scheme for relocation of
industries from non-conforming areas to various other authorised
[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 10 of 26

industrial complexes in Delhi, either developed or to be developed
by the authorities for the purpose of relocating industrial units
3.

Subsequently,

an

advertisement

was

issued

inviting

applications for allotment of industrial plots under relocation
scheme. A brochure in respect of the relocation scheme of 1996
was

issued

by

the

Office

of

Commissioner

of

Industries,

Government of NCT of Delhi and implementation of the said
scheme was entrusted to the Delhi State Industrial Development
Corporation ('DSIDC' for short).

At the time of application, the

applicant was required to deposit earnest money @ Rs.300/- per
sq.mtr. The said rate was an estimated figure and was subject to
change depending upon the cost of acquisition, construction,
development, location of

industrial area, other inputs etc.

The

relevant clause of the brochure issued is reproduced below for
reference:
“5. Estimated cost of industrial flat/plot
The estimated cost of one flatted factory shall be around
Rs.7 lacs and that the industrial plot shall be approx.
Rs.3000/- per square meter. These are estimate figures
and are subject to change depending upon the cost of
acquisition, construction/development, location of flatted
factory complexes/industrial area, other inputs etc.”

4.

Pursuant to the aforesaid advertisement, the respondents

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 11 of 26

herein applied for allotment of industrial plots at Narela Industrial
Complex, under the said relocation scheme. Subsequently,

by

letter dated 7th May, 2004 bearing No.DSIDC/RL/CM/P.C./03/2296
addressed to one of the allottees namely, Garg Iron and Steel
Company, respondent herein, it was informed that he has been
allotted a plot measuring 250 sq.mtrs @Rs.7,776/- per sq.mtr. The
date 7th May, 2006 was over written/superimposed on the earlier
date of 2nd January, 2004 and also the price of Rs.7,776/- was
overwritten/superimposed on the price of Rs.5,400/- per sq.mtr.
5.

Aggrieved by the allotment of an industrial plot at Narela

Industrial Complex at the rate of Rs.7,776/- per sq.mtr instead of
Rs.5,400/-, the respondents herein challenged the enhancement of
price to Rs.7,776/- by filing a writ petition praying for a direction to
the DSIDC to allot the plots to the respondents @ Rs.5,400/- per
sq.mtr as fixed in 2001.

On perusal of the facts and after hearing

the learned counsel for the parties, the learned Single Judge
formulated the key question for consideration as to whether DSIDC
can charge 20% unearned increase annually over and above the
pre-determined rates of Rs.5,400/- per sq.mtr as fixed on 1 st
January, 2001 and thereafter allowed the writ petitions by order

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 12 of 26

dated 15th May, 2007 holding that it was nowhere stated in the
affidavit filed on behalf of the DSIDC that any developmental
activity has taken place after 2001 and that any additional costs
as indicated in paragraph 5 had been incurred by the DSIDC after
2001 and therefore, it would be unfair and beyond the scope of
relocation scheme to enhance the value of the land when no
actual costs or expenses have been incurred by the DSIDC. The
demand for Rs.7,776/- per sq.mtr was set aside by the learned
Single Judge and the DSIDC was directed that they shall while
maintaining the price of 2001 i.e. Rs.5,400/- per sq.mtr, enhance it
to a higher figure, relying upon the rate of inflation in the
intervening period, which could be calculated on the basis of
wholesale price index, so that the respondents herein have to pay
Rs.5,400/- per sq. in real terms adjusted to 2007. We are told that
same works out to be Rs.6,480/- per sq.mtr. Aggrieved by the
aforesaid order of the learned Single Judge, DSIDC has filed the
present appeals.
6.

We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and

perused the records placed before us. During the hearing of the
present appeals, it was submitted by the counsel for the

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 13 of 26

respondents that they are ready and willing to deposit the balance
amount @ Rs,.6,480/- per sq.mtr without prejudice to their rights
and contentions in the present appeals. As the respondents had
not deposited the amount even in terms of the order of learned
Single Judge and have only deposited the cost of land @ Rs.4,200/per sq.mtr, by order dated 26th November, 2007, it was directed
that the said amount be deposited after adjusting the amounts
already deposited with the DSIDC. We are informed that most of
the respondents, if not all, have deposited Rs.6,480/- per sq. mtr
towards cost of land.
7.

Before the learned Single Judge and also before us it was

contended by DSIDC that the Court cannot interfere with the
costing as the scope of interference of Courts in exercise of the
powers under Article 226 of the Constitution in the matter of
costing is very limited as it relates to contractual relationship.
Though there is no dispute with regard to the said proposition that
the jurisdiction of the Court under Article 226 of the Constitution in
respect of the matter relating to costing is very limited, but it is
also well settled that a duty has been cast on the courts to see
that the decision with respect to pricing/costing is not arbitrary or

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 14 of 26

irrational and also that the relevant factors are only taken into
consideration, excluding the irrelevant factors. It is particularly so
in the present case where the allotment is to be made under a
relocation scheme on 'no profit no loss' basis as directed by the
Supreme Court.
8.

Referring to Clause 5 of the brochure it was contended by

DSIDC that prices were only estimated figures subject to change
depending upon various factors including location. It was further
contended that the date of allotment would be relevant for fixing
the price and in support of the said contention DSIDC has relied on
the letter dated 26th April, 2004 bearing No.DSIDC/EE(CD)III/RL/1999/108/74-81

issued

by

the

Commissioner

of

Industries,Government of NCT of Delhi, addressed to the Managing
Director, DSIDC wherein the Commissioner of Industries has
informed the DSIDC about the revised rates for disposal of
industrial plots.

The said letter is reproduced below for ready

reference:
“Sub: Revision of rates for disposal of industrial plots and
fixation of market rate for the purpose of charging
unearned increase under the Relocation Scheme:
Sir,
In continuation of the office order No.DSIDC/EE(CD)[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 15 of 26

III/RL/99/108/13-21 dated 14.9.2001 and No.DSIDC/EE(CD)III/RL/99/108/13-21 dated 21.9.2001 and on the subject
cited above, the Lessor/Lt.Governor of Delhi is pleased to
notify the rates of industrial land allotted/being alloted by
DSIDC at Narela, Patparganj,Jhilmil, Badli and Bawana
Industrial Estate under the Relocation Scheme as per
details given below:

Further, Lessor/Lt.Governor, Delhi is pleased to fix the
following rates for charging unearned increase in the
market value of the aforesaid industrial
plots for
regularising deletion of partners/directors not covered
under the definition of family.”

9.

The learned Single Judge has also drawn inference from the

above letter to frame the key question that whether DSIDC can
charge 20% unearned increase annually over and above the predetermined rates of Rs.5,400/- per sq.mtr as on 1.1.2001. On the
said question the learned Single Judge held that as per paragraph5 of the brochure the estimated figures were subject to increase
only if there was an increase in the cost of acquisition, cost of
construction/development, location of flatted factory complex/
industrial areas and other inputs.

But the said increase in the

present case is not on any of the said factors as no detail has been
[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 16 of 26

provided to show and indicate as to that under what head what
expenditure has been made.

It was observed that the increase

has been effected by merely citing a policy of 20% increase
annually and there are no other factors which have been taken
into account for arriving at the said price. Thus, merely citing the
policy will not be sufficient as it was specifically mentioned that
the increase, if any, will be only on account of the aforesaid factors
enumerated in paragraph-5 of the brochure.
10.

DSIDC also contended that since the allotments were

made in 2004, therefore no vested right was accrued to the
respondents to claim allotments at the price prevailing prior to
2004 and the allotment can be made only at the price determined
by the appropriate authority for the concerned year.
11.

However, the respondents, reiterating their stand taken

before the learned Single judge, contended before us also that the
learned Single Judge was right in holding that the increase was on
account of unearned increase and not on account of actual cost of
development which was the only factor on which an increase, if
any, can be made. It was also contended that the allotments were
made under the relocation scheme as per the directions of the

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 17 of 26

Supreme Court and even otherwise under a scheme of this nature,
the allotments are made on ‘no profit no loss’ basis and an
increase of this nature i.e. unearned increase, will be contrary to
the basic objective of the said policy and the directions of the
Supreme Court. It was also contended that the respondents were
ready to abide by the terms fixed at the time when the brochure
was issued and willing to pay the enhanced price, but the said
enhanced price should be only on account of increase in cost of
development as enumerated in the brochure and should not be
based on any other factor like unearned increase and should also
not be in order to capitalise the situation on account of the factors
which were never enumerated in the brochure.
12.

The respondents in order to further substantiate their

arguments have relied on the letter dated 7th May, 2004 which was
originally prepared on 2nd January, 2004 and contended that no
construction has taken place in the period between January to
May, 2004 and the increase in price from Rs.5,400/- to Rs.7,776/per sq.mtr., as over written/superimposed, is not on account of the
factors enumerated in the brochure issued at the time of
application for such allotment.

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 18 of 26

13.

In paragraph-17 of the impugned judgment the learned

Single Judge has held that it would be unfair and beyond the scope
of relocation scheme to enhance the value of the land, as DSIDC
have nowhere stated in their affidavits that any additional cost on
account of the factors indicated in paragraph- 5 of the aforesaid
brochure have been incurred by the DSIDC after 2001.

It is an

admitted position that in the year 2001 the price was at Rs.5,400/sq.mtr in Narela which is also evident from the letter dated 26th
April, 2004. Subject of the said letter indicates that it was issued
for “revision of rates for disposal of industrial plots and fixation of
market rate for the purpose of charging unearned increase under
the relocation scheme”. In the said letter, against land prices at
Narela, the price was mentioned at Rs.5,400/- per sq.mtr for the
calendar year 2001, Rs.6480/- per sq.mtr for the calendar year
2002 and Rs.7,776/- per. sq.mtr for the calendar year 2003. There
is also no dispute to the fact that the latter two amounts are
exactly 20% higher than the previous amounts.

However, the

said pricing policy was not only adopted for the Narela Industrial
area but was also adopted for other industrial areas like
Patparganj, Jhilmil and Badli where the prices were increased

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 19 of 26

accordingly and it was only the Bawana Industrial Area where the
prices have remained constant at Rs.4,200/- per sq.mtr from
calendar years 2001 to 2003.
14.

On perusal of the writ record we also find that the

respondents have themselves alleged in their list of dates that
despite the order of the Supreme Court in October, 2003 directing
the DSIDC to complete the development of industrial plots and
allot the same, the DSIDC did not act accordingly and the prices
continued to go up. Reference in this regard can also be made to
paragraph 20 of the writ petition wherein the respondents have
not contended that development of land was complete in 2001 but
have contended that due to negligence of DSIDC the land could
not be developed and the respondents are sufferers because of
the negligent bureaucratic approach. Thus from the aforesaid it
can be said that even the respondents were aware of the fact that
development of land was not complete in the year 2001. Though
it cannot be denied that DSIDC has taken a long period of over
eight years from the date of application to hand over the industrial
plots in Narela Industrial Area which as per DSIDC is a developed
industrial area in comparison to other industrial areas, but as the

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 20 of 26

loss due to delay in handing over the plots was not in issue before
the learned Single Judge and also before us, we do not think it to
be appropriate to comment on the said aspect. There can be a
number of reasons and causes why delay in development of land
took place.
15.

Accordingly, now the question which remains to be

considered is whether the said increase, termed as unearned
increase, was actually on account of cost of development. A table
annexed with the letter dated 26th April, 2004 shows that the fixed
price of the land in Narela Industrial Area has gone up from
Rs.1,123/- per sq.mtr in the financial year 1997-98 to Rs.2,796/- in
the financial year 2003-04. It has been reiterated by this Court
and the Supreme Court in

various decisions that the date of

allotment and not the date of application will be the relevant date
for the purpose determining the price.

Reference in this regard

can be made to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
Delhi Development Authority v. Pushpendra Kumar Jain reported in
1994 supp. (3) SCC 494 wherein the Supreme Court has held that
the right arises only on the communication of the letter of
allotment and accordingly the price or rates prevailing on the date

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 21 of 26

of such communication will be applicable unless otherwise
provided in the scheme. (Also see: Chief Administrator PUDA &
Another v. Mrs.Shabnam Virk reported in (2006) 4 SCC 74).
16.

Even if the allotment has to be made on ‘no profit no loss’

basis, it is necessary to determine the value of land prevailing at
the time when the allotment has to be made. The value of land in
the NCT of Delhi has seen a tremendous increase over the last
decade. In order to determine the year after year increase in the
value of the land and cost of construction, a method can be
adopted whereby a specific percentage addition is made to the
existing price. The same was the method which was adopted by
the DSIDC and the appropriate percentage addition was fixed at
20% per annum.
17.

The DSIDC has also submitted that the reserve price fixed

by the DDA for the plots at Narela Industrial Complex in 2004 was
Rs.24,000/- per sq.mtr and the rate at which the allotment being
made is still less than 1/3 of the reserve price prevailing on the
date of allotment. The said contention was answered by the
learned Single Judge by stating that the allotment in the present
case is under a relocation scheme and the aforesaid comparison

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 22 of 26

cannot be a parameter to determine the price in case of allotment
of plots under a relocation scheme. In the relocation scheme the
allotment is made on 'no-profit no-loss basis' whereas the
aforesaid reserve price was fixed by DDA in a case where the
allotment was to be made by auction. We also agree that it will
not be just and proper to compare the two prices as the allotment
in the present case is under a specific scheme i.e. relocation
scheme, but the same can be an indication to the fact that there
would have been an increase in the the cost of land and also in the
cost of development. Land is not being allotted to the respondents
at the market rate, but at the fixed pre-determined rate fixed by
the Government of NCT of Delhi. The fixed pre-determined rate is
almost 1/3 less than the reserve price fixed for auctions. Reserve
price is 20% less than the average auction rate in the last year.
18.

A reference was also made by the respondents to the

price at which allotment was made at Bawana industrial Area i.e.
@ Rs.4,200/- per sq.mtr to contend that as the price at Bawana
was Rs.4,200/-, the cost of development even at Narela cannot be
by any stretch of imagination be more than Rs.5,400/-. Though it is
an admitted position that there was no increase in the allotment

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 23 of 26

price in respect of the industrial plots at Bawana Industrial Area
but the said factor cannot be applicable in respect of other
industrial areas as except Bawana there was an increase in prices
in all other industrial areas. Also during the course of hearing a
proposal was also made by the appellant DSIDC that they are
ready and willing to allot industrial plots in Bawana industrial Area
@ Rs.4200 sq.mtr, if the respondents are

ready and willing to

surrender their allotment at Narela Industrial Complex, but none of
the respondents came forward to exercise the said option. It is
also evident from the records that the reserve price prevalent in
2004 at Bawana Industrial Area was Rs.11,750/- per sq.mtr which
is even less than half of the reserve price prevalent at Narela
Industrial Area. Thus it will not be appropriate to determine the
price by comparing the two areas and also the fact that there was
no increase in the price in the Bawana Industrial Area cannot be
made the guiding factor to decide the quantum of increase in the
price in other industrial areas.
19.

We have also gone through the letter of allotment dated

7th May, 2004.

It is apparent that the date 7th May, 2004 was

overwritten/superimposed on the earlier date of 2nd January, 2004

[LPA 1048/07 & connected appeals]

Page 24 of 26

and

accordingly

the

price

of

Rs.7,776/-

was

also

overwritten/superimposed on the price of Rs.5,400/- per sq.mtr.
Even if we accept that no development and expenditure was
incurred in the period between January and May, 2004, then also
the demand of the respondents to get the allotment at a price of
Rs.5,400/- per sq.mtr instead of Rs.7,776/- cannot be accepted in
the light of the fact that not only in the year 2004 but even in the
calendar year 2003 prevailing price was Rs.7,776/- per sq.mtr and
the allotment in the year 2004 was made at the same price. Thus,
even on 2nd January, 2004 the prevailing price was Rs.7,776/- per
sq.mtr and not Rs.5,400/- and also as the letter was posted to the
respondents with the correct price of Rs.7,776/- , no vested right
has accrued upon the respondents to claim allotment at the rate
of Rs.5,400/- on the ground that the DSIDC, instead of preparing a
new letter rectifying their mistake, chose to superimpose the
prevalent price upon the wrongly stated price.
20.

The DSIDC was only the implementing authority and the

price determining power was vested with the Department of
Industries, Government of NCT of Delhi through Lt. Governor and
from letter dated 26th April, 2004 it is evident that the said price

was fixed by the said authority with approval of the Lt.Governor
and DSIDC was bound to make allotment according to the price
determined by the said authority from time to time.
21.

In the light of the aforesaid discussion and findings, we are

of the opinion that the learned Single Judge has erred in coming to
the conclusion that the cost of land as demanded was not
appropriate as no actual expenditure has been incurred by DSIDC
towards the cost of development. Accordingly, we set aside the
impugned judgment and order and allow the appeals filed by the
DSIDC.

The respondents are directed to deposit the balance

amount @ Rs.7,776/- per sq.mtr, after adjusting the amount
already deposited, within a period of three months from today and
thereafter DSIDC to make allotment within four weeks from the
date of deposit of the balance amount and on completion of all
other necessary formalities.
