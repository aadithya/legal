PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (ORAL)

1.

Heard. Petitioner impleaded as a defendant in a suit

filed by the resspondent is aggrieved by the condition imposed
requiring petitioner to deposit Rs.3 lacs in court or file a bank
guarantee in said sum or deposit FDR in said sum as a
condition precedent for defending the suit.
2.

On merits, leave to defend has been granted to the

petitioner.
3.

Respondent's suit under Order 37 of the Code of
Page 1 of 4

Civil Procedure stated that petitioner had borrowed Rs.4 lacs
from the respondent with interest @ 18% p.a. and had
executed a promissory note as consideration for return of the
loan. The date of the transaction is stated to be 18.8.2004. It
was stated that the petitioner failed to honour the commitment
to pay under the promissory note and hence the suit.
4.

Seeking leave to defend, petitioner stated that the

respondent was appointed by it to the post of Company
Secretary and was put in charge of its project 'Kings Valley'. It
was stated that the project did not materialize and for said
reason services of the respondent were discontinued. It was
stated

that

when

working

for

the

project

in

question

respondent got familiar with the hand writing and signatures of
the petitioner and that the promissory note was a forged
document.

Receipt of any loan was denied.

It was also

pleaded that the respondent had committed acts of forgery
and cheating and a complaint was made to the police. It was
pleaded in the application seeking leave to defend that the
salary of the respondent was Rs.6500/- per month.

It was

pleaded that there was no occasion for the employer to take
any loan from the employee.
5.

In response, respondent admitted having worked

with the petitioner but stated that he worked as a consultant
Page 2 of 4

and not as an employee.
6.
the

Learned Trial Judge held that since the signatures on
promissory

note

were

disputed

and

there

was

no

independent proof in respect of the stated loan, case was
made out to grant leave to defend to the petitioner.
7.

What stands out before me is the fact that it is not

the case of the respondent that the loan in question advanced
by a cheque. In fact the plaint is completely silent as to how
and in what manner i.e. whether in cash or by cheque, the loan
in question was advanced.
8.

In my opinion, having prima facie found in favour of

the petitioner that case was made out to grant leave to defend
it required reasons to be stated as to why a condition was
being put while granting leave to defend.
9.

In the impugned order, no reasons have been

recorded whatsoever justifying imposition of the condition
while granting leave to defend.
10.

I dispose of the petition setting aside the impugned

order in so far it imposes a condition requiring petitioner to
either deposit or furnish bank guarantee or furnish a fixed
deposit receipt in sum of Rs.3 lacs.

Meaning thereby,

petitioner would be entitled to unconditional leave to defend.
11.

No costs.
