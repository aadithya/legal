page 1 of 8

since common question of law is involved.
2.

Appeal No.977/05 arises out of the decision dated 20th

January, 2005 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
for assessment year 1997-98, whereas appeal No.186/06
pertains to the order dated 29th March, 2005 for the
assessment year 1998-99 passed by the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal.
3.

The brief facts leading to the filing of these appeals

are:ITA No.977/2005
4.

The Assessee a Private Limited Company is engaged

in business of fabrication and supply of equipments and
technical items. This business is being carried out in units
situated at Kalamb, Himachal Pradesh which is a notified
backward area. Other business units of the Assessee are
situated in Delhi and Noida. The profit derived from the
Kalamb unit was eligible for deduction under Section 80-IA
of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short the Act) in the year
under

consideration,

whereas

such

benefit

was

not

available to the other units of Assessee situated in Delhi
and Noida.

In the return of income for the year under

ITA NO.977/2005 & 186/2006

page 2 of 8

consideration, the Assessee declared a gross total income
of Rs.21,91,102/- which comprised of profit from Kalamb
Unit amounting to Rs.20,92,221/-, interest and other
income amounting to Rs.10,10,149/- and loss from units in
Delhi at Rs.9,11,270/-.

From this gross total income, the

Assessee claimed a deduction of Rs.20,92,221 under
Section 80-IA of the Act being 100% profit derived from
Kalamb unit and, accordingly, total income of Rs.98,880/was shown in its return.
5.

The Assessing Officer, however, adjusted the loss of

Rs.9,11,270/-

of

Delhi

unit

against

the

profit

of

Rs.20,92,221/- of Kalamb unit and restricted the deduction
under Section 80-IA of the Act at Rs.11,80,952/.
6.

Being dissatisfied with the decision of the Assessing

Officer, the Assessee filed an appeal and the Commissioner
of Income Tax(Appeal) held that the deduction claimed by
the

assessee

under

Section

80-IA

of

the

Act

at

Rs.20,92,221/- to be correct and allowed the same.
7.

Aggrieved against the order of Commissioner of

Income Tax (Appeal) the Revenue filed an appeal before the
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, which upheld the order of
ITA NO.977/2005 & 186/2006

page 3 of 8

Commissioner of Income Tax (A).
ITA No.186/2006
8.

The issue in this case is whether Income Tax

Appellate Tribunal is justified in allowing the deduction
under Section 80-IA of the Act at Rs.18,03,143/- as against
Rs.4,53,398/- allowed by the Assessing Officer for the
assessment year 1998-99.

The Income Tax Appellate

Tribunal, following its order dated 20th January, 2005 in ITA
No.758/Del/2001

for

the

assessment

year

1997-98,

dismissed the appeal of the Revenue.
9.

It has been argued by the learned counsel for the

Appellant that as per provision of Section 80-IA of the Act
where gross total income of the Assessee includes any
profits and gains derived from any eligible business of an
industrial undertaking, the whole of the profit of such
eligible business is to be allowed as deduction under
Section 80-IA of the Act and the interest earned by the
Assessee is not a business income but it is

an income

under the head “income from other sources” and it cannot
be treated as business income.
10.

Learned counsel for the Appellant in support of its

ITA NO.977/2005 & 186/2006

page 4 of 8

contention has cited decision of Apex court in IPCA
Laboratory Ltd. v. Deputy Commissioner of Income
Tax (2004) 266 ITR 521 and Commissioner of Income
Tax v.Kotagiri Industrial Co-operative Tea Factory
Ltd., (1997) 224 ITR 604.
11.

On the other hand, it has been argued by learned

counsel for the Respondent that the Assessing Officer while
computing

the

income,

restricted

the

deduction

at

Rs.11,80,952/- being the amount allowable to the extent of
business

income

against

the

business

Rs.20,92,221/- from Kalamb unit.

profit

of

In doing so, the

Assessing Officer mixed the profits of Kalamb unit with
profits of units at Delhi and Noida and, thus, erroneously
restricted the deduction to the extent of business income.
This has been done in the total disregard of provision of
sub-section 7 of Section 80-IA of the Act.

The learned

counsel in support of his contention has cited a decision of
Andhra

Pradesh

High

Court

in

C.I.T.

v.

Vishaka

Industries Ltd., (2001) 251 ITR 471.
12.

It is an admitted fact that Kalamb Unit is the only unit

of the Assessee which is eligible for benefits available
ITA NO.977/2005 & 186/2006

page 5 of 8

under Section 80-IA of the Act during the years under
consideration, whereas the other units situated at Delhi
and Noida are not eligible for this benefit. It is also not in
dispute that profits derived by the Assessee from Kalamb
Unit amounted to Rs.20,92,221/- whereas the other units at
Delhi and Noida resulted in the loss of Rs.9,11,270/-.
Provision of sub-section 7 of Section 80-IA of the Act which
is relevant in this case, is reproduced below:-

13.

“
(7)Notwithstanding
anything
contained in any other provision of this
Act, the profits and gains of an eligible
business to which the provisions of
sub-section (1) apply shall, for the
purpose of determining the quantum of
deduction under sub-section (5) for the
assessment
year
immediately
succeeding the initial assessment year
or any subsequent assessment year, be
computed as if such eligible business
were the only source of income of the
assessee during the previous year
relevant to the initial assessment year
and to every subsequent assessment
year
upto
and
including
the
assessment year for which the
determination is to be made.”
Perusal of the above provision shows that it is a

distinct and separate deeming provision which lays down
the special method of computing the profits and gains
entitled to deduction under Section 80-IA of the Act.
ITA NO.977/2005 & 186/2006

page 6 of 8

Moreover, this provision is of overriding nature providing
specifically that during each of the assessment years in the
tax holiday, period in which the Assessee is entitled to
deduction

under Section 80-IA of the Act, this provision

will be applied as if the industrial unit is an independent
unit and is the one and only source of income possessed by
the Assessee.
14.

It is clear that while computing deduction under

Section 80-IA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, the profits and
gains of Kalamb unit for the purpose of determining the
quantum of deduction under Section 80-IA (5) of the Act is
to be computed if such eligible business of the said unit is
the only source of income of the assessee. The Assessing
Officer mixed the profits of the Kalamb unit with the profits
of units at Delhi and Noida and, thus, he erroneously
restricted the deduction to the extent of business income
and this was done by him in total disregard of the
provisions of sub-section 7 of Section 80-IA of the Act as
mentioned above.
15.

Thus, the Kalamb unit being the only unit of the

Assessee eligible for deduction under Section 80-IA of the
ITA NO.977/2005 & 186/2006

page 7 of 8

Act is to be treated as an independent unit and the same is
to be treated as the only source of income for Assessee for
the purpose of computing deduction under Section 80-IA of
the Act.

The deduction claimed by the Assessee under

Section 80-IA of the Act, thus, is in accordance with the
said provisions and as such we find that there is no
infirmity in the impugned order passed by the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal.
16.

The Judgments cited by learned counsel for Appellant

are not applicable for the facts of the present case.
17.

This being the position, we are of the opinion that

there is no substantial question of law that arises for our
consideration and we do not find any error in the view that
has been taken by the Tribunal in this regard.
18.

Consequently, both the appeals are dismissed.
