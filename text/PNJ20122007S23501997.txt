Jeewan Dass claims in the suit that the parties to

the suit belong to the family entitled to puja sewa right and
appropriate offerings at Shri Hanuman Mandir, Connaught
Place, New Delhi.

That through Janki Dass, father of the

plaintiff and grand father of defendant No.1, the plaintiff and
defendant No.1 inherited the right of Janki Dass in respect of
the family residence as also the business and the shop where
from, during his life time, Janki Dass was carrying on business.
It is pleaded by Jeewan Dass that his brother Hari Shankar and
he i.e. Jeewan Dass were conducting the business from the
shop for a period of six months each and after Hari Shankar's
death in the

year 1988, the defendant No.1, son of Hari

Shankar ousted him from the shop. It is asserted by Jeewan
Dass that he is entitled to sit in the shop and conduct business
there from for 6 months each year.

It is further pleaded by

Jeewan Dass that defendant No.1 has made unauthorized

I note that apart from Anil Sharma impleaded as

defendant No.1, Vidya Devi, wife of Hari Shankar and mother of
Anil Sharma has been impleaded as defendant No.2.

to exclusively appropriate the puja sewa rights.

Panna Lal and

Nathu jointly got 3 months. Ram Chander and Radha Krishan
got 2 ½ months each pertaining to the puja sewa rights.

That

during the respective puja sewa period, the offerings at the
temple were appropriated by the 6 pujaris.
7.

It is further pleaded by the defendants that Radha

Krishan was survived by three sons, namely, Janki Dass, Shiv
Lal and Laxman Singh. That the three brothers decided that
the 2 ½ months puja sewa rights of Radhja Krishan would be
shared by the 3 brothers by each brother having exclusive 15
days each year and 1 month every third year to appropriate
the puja sewa rights i.e. for 2 years Janki Dass got 15 days
each year and the third year he got 1 month and so on.

It is

further pleaded that the 2 sons of Janki Dass shared his right to
perform sewa puja 15 days each year for 2 years and 1 month
in the third year by assigning 15 days every alternative year to
each other and 15 days each in the third year.
8.

Pertaining to the land surrounding the temple it is

pleaded by the defendants that on 16.3.1931, the Governor
General of India executed a temporary lease in favour of the
pujaris of the temple demising 1.091 acres land for a period of
25 years.

that

Municipal Committee took possession of land

New

Delhi

abutting the

temple some times in the year 1966-67 save and except the
land comprising the temple complex and the residential
structures erected by the pujaris.
10.

Defendants deny any shop

in their possession

where from any business was being conducted. It was pleaded
that after the shop inherited from Janki Dass was demolished
by NDMC, a “takhat” put up by ancestors of one Dharam Chand
on the land belonging to the temple with the permission of the
pujarias was permitted to be used by Dharam Chand to late
Hari

Shankar on week days save and except on Tuesday.

That Hari Shankar sold flowers from the takhat belonging to
Dharam Chand and on death of Hari Shankar,

with the

permission of Dharam Chand, defendants uses the takhat to
sell flowers except on Tuesdays when Dharam Chand uses the
takhat for his business.
11.

Pertaining to the residential structures, case of the

defendants is that the original pujaris and their successors
raised constructions as per need without any title to the land.
That Janki Dass was occupying one residential hall measuring
20ft. x 40ft. having adjoining thereto a store room admeasuring
6ft. x 11ft.

A bathroom below the stair case leading to the

CS(OS) No.2350/97

defendants as constructed by Janki Dass.

brother Hari Shankar.

admeasuring 20ft. x

Hari Shankar retained the store room measuring 6ft. x

11ft. and constructed a first floor above the existing ground
floor.

That thereafter Hari Shankar constructed a kitchen, a

toilet and a bathroom out of his funds. That on the death of
Hari Shankar, since plaintiff was creating problems and wanted
formal partition, a settlement was arrived at in which the
plaintiff was given the big hall on the ground floor and the old
construction on the first floor above the hall.

That the

defendants occupied the small store room on the ground floor
and one room on the first floor.

That accommodation being

short, defendants constructed a second floor above the said
room.
13.

In the replication filed to the written statement

plaintiff denied being in possession of any hall admeasuring
20ft. x 40ft. Plaintiff pleaded that he was occupying a room
admeasuring 12.10ft. x 9.8ft. and a store measuring 6.4ft. x.
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 7 of 30

9.6ft. on the ground floor. Plaintiff denied any partition.
14.

Pertaining to the business, plaintiff made a subtle

shift in the replication by admitting that the business was being
carried out from a takhat (I may note that the plaintiff has used
the expression “counter”).

A new version was pleaded that

the counter in question was divided into two portions.

Half

portion was given to one M/s Kishan Lal & Sons and that the
remaining half was with the family of Janki Dass. It was denied
that Dharam Chand had any concern with the takhat.
15.

Evidence has been led by the parties.

Plaintiff

examined 8 witnesses. I may note that parties have led prolix
evidence. Repetitive and fairly irrelevant evidence in the form
of lengthy depositions have come on record.

The testimony of

the 7 witnesses of the plaintiff spans nearly 260 pages.
16.

Plaintiff examined himself as his first witness as PW-

1. He deposed on the same lines as he had pleaded in the
plaint.

He denied any partition.

He denied any settlement in

the year 1992. He stated that the shop in possession of Janki
Dass remained in possession of the family and that there was
no other place wherefrom Hari Shankar sold flowers. He stated
that till 1970 cold drinks, bidi, cigarette etc. were sold from the
shop but thereafter goods used in a temple like flowers,
coconut, dhoop etc. were sold therefrom. He stated that the
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 8 of 30

shop

was

used

by

somebody

else

on

Tuesdays.

He

categorically stated that in 1992 he exclusively used the shop
for 6 months from May to October. He stated that after Hari
Shankar died in 1988, his i.e. plaintiff's mother used to run the
shop.
17.

In cross examination he stated that a room on the

first floor was constructed by his mother and Hari Shankar but
admitted that said room was in occupation of Hari Shankar. He
admitted

that

there

were

2

separate

and

independent

electricity meters to record electricity consumed and that the
meter wherefrom electricity is distributed to portion in his
possession serves exclusively the residential unit in his
occupation.

Important would it be to note that in cross

examination he admitted that in 1967 NDMC carried out
demolitions in the area and that photographs Ex. PW-1/D-2 and
PW-1/D3 revealed the demolition.

He attempted to initially

project that the shop in possession of Janki Dass which was
inherited by his sons was at the same spot where the takhat
exists where from defendants were doing business but on
sustained cross examination had to virtually admit that it was
not so. Being relevant for the evaluation of evidence, relevant
part of cross examination needs to be noted. It is as under:“Q. Do you know as to who has the control over the
open area in the Hanuman Mandir Complex?
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 9 of 30

A.
The veranda/platform in front of the temple is in

A.

Approximately 8' x 5'.

Q.
Was the shop registered with any government
authority?
A.

I was young and I do not know.

Q.
Is it correct that you have no knowledge that the
shop was registered?
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 10 of 30

A.

Yes, it is correct.

Q.

When did your father commence this shop?

A.

I was not even born then so I do not know.

Q.
It it, therefore, correct that you cannot said as to
whether the shop was started by your father or by
your brother?
A.
My brother was very young and could not have
started the shop at that age. It must have been by
my father who started this shop.
Q.
How old was your brother when the shop was
established?
A.

I do not know.

Q.
What was the turn over of the shop at the time
of demise of your father?
A.

I do not know.

Q.
Is the shop run by your father was at the same
place where the present shop/flower counter is being
run?
A.

No.

Q.
Why was the shop shifted from its original
location?
A.
Because at that time there was a clean up
action of Delhi is being undertaken by DDA and as
such this shop along with other shops were shifted.
Q.
I put to you that this area was not under the
jurisdiction of DDA and the demolition was done by
NDMC in 1967 when the area was handed over to
NDMC and in that demolition this shop was also
removed.
A.
I disagree and reiterate that the shop was
removed by DDA.
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 11 of 30

Q.
Is the shop of the Hanuman Mandir at present
different from its original shape.
A.

Yes.
(EXH. PW1/D2 AND PW1/D3 ARE THE
PHOTGRAPHS OF THE HANUMAN TEMPLE
COMPLEX AT THE TIME OF DEMOLITION).

Q.
Is it correct that the pole mentioned by you is
being the pole near which the shop was located, is
the same pole as seen in EXH.PW1/D2 and partially
seen in PW1/D3?
18.

A.

It is correct.”
It needs to be recorded here that with reference to

the pole being referred to and can be seen visually in Ex. PW1/D2 and Ex. PW-1/D3 shows that structures around it were
demolished. Meaning thereby that the shop was demolished.
19.

Relevant would it be

to note that the plaintiff

admitted that the entire property belongs to the temple and
that nobody had any title documents to any property.
20.

PW-2 Bhagwati Devi the sister of the plaintiff also

supported him. It may be noted at this stage that plaintiff and
Hari Shankar were born to Janki Dass through different wives
and Bhagwati Devi was born to Janki Dass through the same
wife who bore to him the plaintiff.
21.

In cross-examination, PW-2 admitted that the shop

which was in possession of Janki Dass was demolished by
NDMC.
22.

PW-3, Nand Lal Sharma, the husband of Bhagwati

CS(OS) No.2350/97

Devi (PW-2) also supported the plaintiff. In cross-examination
even he admitted that the shop was demolished by NDMC. But
stated that after the shop was demolished, Hari Shankar and
Jeewan Dass started using a platform towards the left of the
temple for business purposes.
23.

Mahant Prem Dass who appeared as PW-4 stated

that Mahant Radha Krishan was given puja sewa rights for 2 ½
months by each year and on his death his three sons divided
the same. He stated that Janki Dass had a shop at the temple
complex where from he used to sell pan, bidi, cigarette, cold
drink, flowers etc.

He stated that the shop was demolished by

NDMC in 1967 but stated that thereafter business was carried

He also admitted that in 1967 the shop was

25.

PW-6, O.P.Gyanesh also supported the plaintiff.

26.

I am not noting the detailed testimony of the

witnesses for the reason, though with different expressions all
have deposed near identically.

All of them have spoken about

the joint status of the family of Janki Dass.

They have refuted

the theory of partition projected by the defendants.

All of

them accepted that the shop which was in possession of Janki
Dass was demolished in 1967. All of them deposed that soon
thereafter business recommenced from a platform

adjoining

the main temple.

PW-7, Prem Shankar,

whose elder sister was

married to Jeewan Dass, the plaintiff and whose younger sister
to Anil Sharma, defendant No.1 also supported the plaintiff.

PW-8, a house tax inspector from NDMC

proved

Ex.PW-8/1. The same is a letter addressed by the assistant
Secretary (Taxes) NDMC on 22.1.1967 to the legal heirs of late
Janki Dass informing that the pan bidi shop at Hanuman
Temple had been excluded from the housed tax assessment
list w.e.f. 22.7.1967.

DW-1 reiterated his defence and with reference to

photographs

PW1/D2

and

PW1/D3

stated

that

shops

constructed outside the land allotted to the temple were
demolished and that the shop in occupation of Janki Dass was
demolished. He stated that the shop was demolished in 1968.
His

father

took

possession

from

Dharam

Chand

whose

ancestors were given right by the pujaris to sell sweets from a
wooden takhat at the veranda of the temple to use a part of the
takhat to sell flowers on weekdays except Tuesdays and that
under said permission from Dharam Chand his father stated
using the takhat. He stated that the plaintiff had got a job with
MMTC and had acquired a DDA flat and had shifted residence
to said flat.
31.

Pertaining to the residential units, he deposed as

under:“That late Shri Janki Das had constructed and
occupied a single storeyed residential house in the
back and adjacent to the said Shree Hanuman
Temple. The accommodation available in the said
house was one big hall measuring about 20'x40', a
store room, door of which opens in the said hall, a
verandah now converted into room measuring
about 11'x6'. The big hall and veranda/room was
divided by partition wall made of bricks. In 1952,
late Shri Janki Dass applied to NDMC for making a
CS(OS) No.2350/97

which was approved by the NDMC as per the plans
submitted for the said purpose.

That plaintiff separated his kitchen etc. in 1978 and
started changing his affairs separately. My father
allowed the plaintiff to occupy the inner big hall and
he himself occupied the small outer room converted
from veranda. I completed my education in 1976
and started service in 1979 with Laxmi Commercial
Bank now merged with Canara Bank and became
helping hand to my father. Thereafter, my father's
financial position was improved because I started
earning about Rs.535/- per month in 1979. The
accommodation occupied by my father was too
short and it was not possible to accommodate his
whole family, therefore, in 1981 one room on the
first floor of the old residential house adjacent to
Shree Hanuman Temple was built by my father
from his personal funds and with my salary income.
The said first floor was also assessed to house tax
by NDMC in the name of my father late Shri Hari
Shankar.
At the same time, my father also
constructed a bathroom below the staircase leading
to the first floor in the old house. Till my father was
alive, he used to pay the house tax to NDMC and
thereafter I am paying house tax to NDMC. House
Tax Bill No.7599 for the year 1996-97 is Exhibit
DW1/5.

That the plaintiff got married in 1971 and was
having small children at that time, i.e., in 1981.
The plaintiff requested my father to also use first
floor room and open area in the said house
adjacent to Shree Hanuman Temple. My father out
of love and affection, permitted the plaintiff and his
family to use the same. Sometime in 1967, my
father occupied a small portion of land little ahead
of the old house for his personal use as sitting place
which he subsequently converted some portion as
kitchen for his family and in some portion he made
temporary toilet & bathroom from his personal
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 16 of 30

funds and from my salary income. In January 1985,
there were talks for my marriage but there was no
separate room for me in the house adjacent to
Shree Hanuman Temple. My father and I in May
1985, had constructed a room on the first floor over
the kitchen in the portion little ahead the old house
with my income from salary and I started living in
the said room. I got married on 19th April 1986 and
thereafter, I and my wife are living in the said room.
The plaintiff and his family was not in any way
concerned with the said accommodation and he did
not spent even a single penny in construction of the
said accommodation. Even since May 1985, I and
my family is living on the 1st and 2nd floor rooms in
the house little ahead the Shree Hanuman Temple.
The plaintiff never claimed any right, title or
interest in the said accommodation ever since it has
been built. My wife Smt. Anita Sharma @ Pinki is
real sister of my aunt Smt. Swaran Kanta. Because
of this new relationship between my wife and my
aunt, she requested me to allow them to use half
kitchen built by my father as permissive user till the
alternative arrangement is made by the plaintiff to
which I agreed and permitted the plaintiff to use my
half kitchen.
The plaintiff and his family also
requested to use latrine and bathroom built near
the kitchen because there was only one bathroom
in the old family residential house.
That after the death of my father in 1988, the
plaintiff started troubling unnecessarily to us,
namely, my mother Smt. Vidya Devi and my family
including myself. There was a settlement between
the plaintiff and myself in 1989 with the
intervention of the mother of the plaintiff, namely,
Smt. Parsandi Devi. As per the said settlement, the
plaintiff was allowed to occupy the inner big hall
and first floor accommodation above the said big
hall in the old residential house adjacent to Shree
Hanuman Temple.
My mother was allowed to
occupy the outer small room in the said old family
residential house.
That residential accommodation above the kitchen
situated little ahead the Hanuman Temple is my
absolute property and I have been using the said
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 17 of 30

32.

accommodation as my own without any interruption
by the plaintiff since May 1985. That at the time of
death of my father, there was only one room on the
first floor above the kitchen in the said second
residential accommodation. The structure of my
said room was temporary and old built by my father
and it became necessary to renovate the same to
make it properly inhabitable. In 1992, I decided to
renovate the said room. I engaged one Shri Kishori,
contractor for renovating the said first floor room
from my personal funds. In 1996, I further engaged
Shri Surinder, son of Daulat Ram, Contractor and
constructed another room on the second floor
above said room from my own funds. I also further
renovated 1st floor room in 1996. The plaintiff or
anybody else has not contributed any amount in
the renovation or construction of the said rooms.”
Since as per the deposition of DW-1 the 2 toilets

were belonging to his father and therefore to him, on being
cross examined as to where was the plaintiff using toilet
facilities, he stated that plaintiff was using the NDMC toilet.
33.

DW-2, DW-3, DW-5 and DW-6, all pujaris at the

temple parroted the statement of DW-1 pertaining to the shop
in possession of Janki Dass, it's demolition by NDMC; use by
Hari Shankar of a wooden platform under permission of
Dharam Chand; the stage wise construction of the residential
units and the separation propounded by the defendants.
34.

I proceed to decide the issues which were framed.

While discussing the issues I shall be noting the respective
submission made by learned counsel for the parties as also the
case law relied upon.
35.

I note that issue No.7 was not pressed by learned

CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 18 of 30

counsel for the parties and was given up during arguments.
Thus, the defence predicated on the plea of inadequacy of
court fee paid is recorded as not being pressed.
36.

Though not expressly given up, but no submissions

were made by respective counsel pertaining to issue No.6.
Even otherwise, I note that the said issue has been framed
keeping in view the second preliminary objection raised in the
written statement where defendants have pleaded that the
wooden takhat occupied by them where from they are
conducting business is under their occupation under permission
granted by one Dharam Chand and since Dharam Chand has
not been impleaded as a defendant, the suit suffers from the
defect of non joinder of a necessary party.
37.

From the pleadings of the parties of the evidence

led, it is apparent that the parties are litigating on possessory
rights pertaining to the takhat and do not claim any ownership
right.

Thus, even otherwise, Dharam Chand would not be a

necessary or a proper party. At best, he would be a witness
and no more.
38.

Thus, on issue No.6 I hold that the suit does not

suffer from non joinder of necessary parties.
39.

Issue No.1, 2, 4 and 9 pertain to the residential

constructions effected in the Hanuman Temple complex and
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 19 of 30

hence are being decided together.
40.

The common case of the parties is that Late Janki

Dass, father of the plaintiff and grand father of defendant No.1,
had constructed two rooms on the ground floor on a part of the
land demised initially by the Governor General of India to the
Temple vide Ex. PW-4/A and which land was later on placed by
the Government of India under the management of NDMC. It is
also the common case of the parties that the Temple complex
was initially managed by 6 pujaris who had puja sewa rights in
the temple, meaning thereby, had a right to appropriate the
offerings made by the devotees at the Temple. It is also the
common case of the parties that the descendants of the said 6
priests, by mutual agreement, appropriated different periods
each year to exclusively appropriate the respective puja sewa
rights and that the two sons of Late Janki Dass shared the right
to perform sewa puja 15 days each year for two years and one
month in the 3rd year by assigning 15 days every alternate year
to each other and 15 days each in the third year. On the puja
sewa rights there is no dispute between the parties.
41.

Pertaining

to

the

different

residential

residential units.
42.

Though

parties

are

at

variance

as

to

who

constructed what portions and when, but the evidence brings
out a common feature. The common feature is that, from time
to time, constructions were effected in a random and
haphazard manner; meaning thereby, no discernible right qua
the land comprised under the constructions is emerging.
43.

The

management

of

the

Temple

complex

is

admittedly vested in the trustees vide trust deed Ex. PW-1/D1.
It has to be noted that the plaintiff is one of the settler to the
trust deed.

Unfortunately, neither party has produced any

evidence pertaining to the rights exercised by the trustees
pertaining to the management of the Temple.

There is no

evidence that the trustees permitted Janki Dass, or for that
matter anybody else, to effect constructions on a part of the
land comprising the Temple complex.
44.

Thus, it has to be a case where neither party claims

any title to the land comprised under a disputed residential
constructions.
45.

Decisions cited by the learned counsel for the

plaintiff being AIR 1960 SC 335 Mst. Rukhmabai Vs. Lala
Laxminarayan & Ors., AIR 1967 SC 1124 Girja Nandini Devi &
Ors. Vs. Bijendra Narain Choudhary and 1995 (6) SCC 523
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 21 of 30

P.Periasami (By LRs) Vs. P.Periathambi & Ors. are of no
relevance.
46.

But, evidence establishes that the trustees of the

temple did not raise any objection when, from time to time,
residential constructions were effected by Janki Dass and his
descendants. This means that the trustees have acquiesced in
the constructions in question which have been effected from
time to time.
47.

It would not be out of place to record here that

admitted case of the parties is that the larger and smaller halls
on the ground floor were constructed by Late Janki Dass. This
construction would therefore devolve on the legal heirs of Late
Janki Dass and an inference could be drawn from the
circumstance of the quality of holdings that the descendants of
Janki Dass would have proportionate share in the building
constructed by Late Janki Dass. Thus, the roof of the existing
ground floor construction effected by Janki Dass would devolve
on his two sons in equal share and unless partitioned, both
sons of Janki Dass would have unity of title and possession in
respect of not only the ground floor construction but even the
right on the roof thereof.
48.

Thus, it has to be held that the plaintiff and Hari

Shankar, father of defendant No.1, had equal right to effect
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 22 of 30

constructions

on

the

roof

of

the

existing

ground

floor

construction.
49.

The evidence on record does not establish any

mutual settlement between the parties to partition the property
constructed by Janki Dass much less a mutual agreement
wherein Hari Shankar and thereafter the defendant No.1
effected further constructions on the first floor. The evidence,
at best, probablizes a mutual understanding to enjoy respective
possessory rights.
50.

My reason for so holding is the circumstance that

Hari Shankar, being the elder brother not only got married first
but

had

a

family

and

to

house

the

same

he

raised

constructions. The plaintiff who was a minor when Janki Dass
died had obviously no say in the matter. The dispute surfaces
when even plaintiff got married and had children. His needs
were denied.

At that stage, plaintiff asserted a right to half

share in the constructions effected. This was denied.
51.

Even

otherwise,

the

constructed

portions

in

possession of the defendants are disproportionate to their
share. As is noted from the evidence, both toilets are being
sought to be appropriated by the defendants and plaintiff is
being relegated to use the municipal toilet constructed by
NDMC as a public convenience for the devotees who visit the
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 23 of 30

Temple. It is difficult to believe that the plaintiff would have
agreed to such an unfair partition as is alleged by the
defendants.
52.

Partition

of

an

immovable

property

causes

severance of a joint status. Meaning thereby unity of title and
possession is brought to an end with each party having
exclusive

right

of

ownership

and

possession

of

his/her

respective share. Clear and cogent evidence has to be brought
on record to establish partition i.e. severance.
53.

I accordingly hold that the family arrangement

proved on record by the defendants at best evidences an
agreement between the parties of an inchoate nature to use
and occupy the different portions of the residential complex. I
hold that constructions effected by Hari Shankar on the first
floor and thereafter by defendant No.1 on the floor above were
to meet the growing needs of the family.
were not pursuant to any partition.

The constructions

Since the constructions

were on the roof of the existing ground floor constructed by
Janki Dass, the same would be liable to be partitioned, along
with the partition of the constructions effected by Janki Dass,
with plaintiff having half share therein and the defendants
having the remaining half share.
54.

Issue pertaining to the shifting of the water tank is a

CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 24 of 30

non issue for the reason the water tanks serves as an amenity
for the entire building.
55.

I accordingly decide issue No.1, 2, 4 and 9 by

directing that the residential complex is liable to be partitioned.
I pass a preliminary decree declaring that on the death of Janki
Dass his two sons, Jeewan Dass and Hari Shankar acquired 50%
right each qua the constructions effected by Janki Dass
including the roof rights thereon i.e. I declare plaintiff to be
50% owner thereof and the defendants 50% owner thereof.
The residential unit has thus to be partitioned.
56.

Issue No. 3, 5 and 8 need to be decided together.

The said issues relate to the wooden takhat where from
defendants sell flowers and other goods needed by the
devotees who make offerings at the Temple on the weekdays
except Tuesday.
57.

As is to be noted from the pleadings in the plaint,

plaintiff asserted a right in respect of a shop admittedly in
possession of Janki Dass from where Janki Dass use to sell cold
drinks, pan, cigarette, bidi etc. As pleaded in the plaint there is
no reference to the fact that the said shop was ultimately
demolished and right to the spot where the shop existed
continued to enure to the children of Janki Dass. As is noted
from the testimony of the plaintiff, he attempted to establish
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 25 of 30

during trial that the wooden takhat in question is at the same
place where the shop existed. But, from the testimony of the
plaintiff during cross examination (contents noted in para 17
above) he admitted that the takhat was not at the same place
where the shop existed.
58.

Witnesses of the plaintiff admitted that in the year

1967 the shop was demolished by NDMC. On sustained cross
examination, even plaintiff admitted the said fact. Witnesses of
the defendants supported the defendants on said issue.
59.

The evidence on record conclusively establishes that

the shop in possession of Janki Dass was demolished.
60.

Though, no party has led evidence where from the

boundary of 1.09 acres of land granted on lease to the Temple
could be identified and hence there is no evidence where from
it could be established with clarity whether the shop was
outside the 1.09 acre land or within the same.

But, though

weak, evidence led by the defendant probablizes that the shop
was outside the boundaries of 1.09 acre land, lease in respect
whereof was given to the Temple. My reason for so holding is
that it was not the case of either party that the Temple
complex does not continue to exist on 1.09 acres of land. The
only probably reason for demolition of the shop has to be the
removal of encroachments outside the boundaries of 1.09 acre
CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 26 of 30

of land leased to the Temple complex.
61.

There is no evidence that the shop in possession of

Janki Dass was given to him pursuant to any decision taken by
the original pujaris of the temple. No evidence of any custom
or usage has been led by the plaintiff.

The origin of the

possessory right of Janki Dass is unknown.
62.

The fact that the shop was demolished by NDMC

probablizes the fact that the same was an unauthorized
construction by encroaching land belonging to the Government.
Thus, with the re-possession of the site by the Government
even the possessory right of Janki Dass came to an end.
63.

It has to be noted that the plaintiff has not pleaded

in the plaint that the takht in question was in lieu of the
site/shop possessed by Janki Dass. On this short ground alone
the plaintiff must fail in relation to the claim to the takht in
question.
64.

However, lest I be wrong in aforesaid view taken by

me, I discuss the evidence on record pertaining to the takht
where from defendant No.1 is selling flowers, coconuts etc.
65.

The witnesses of the plaintiff admitted that after the

shop which was in possession of Janki Dass and was inherited
by his sons was demolished, business of sale of flowers was
being carried out from the takht in question.

They also

CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 27 of 30

admitted that on Tuesdays no such business was being done.
66.

According to the defendants, a case supported by

their witnesses, the takht in question belonged to Dharam
Chand and he had permitted the defendants to use the same
on weekdays except Tuesdays.
67.

Though, as noted above, in the plaint, plaintiff

nowhere averred that the takht was permitted to be used in
lieu of the shop, but in the replication to the written statement
filed the plaintiff has pleaded that half takht was given to
Krishan Lal & Sons and the other half to the plaintiff and his
brother Hari Shankar.
68.

But, the plaintiff did not plead as to who gave the

said right.
69.
the takht.

The plaintiff has led no evidence as to who owned
It is not even the case of the plaintiff that the

trustees of the temple complex permitted the plaintiff and his
brother to shift business to the takht.
70.

Admittedly, the takht is next to the entrance of the

temple and is in the verandah of the temple. The origin of any
right, title or interest in the takht has to be through the trustees
of the temple or through a person claiming or deriving interest
under the trustees.
71.

The plaintiff having led no evidence on said aspect

CS(OS) No.2350/97

page 28 of 30

has to fail on said count.
72.

Possession of the defendants being admitted by the

plaintiff, defendants need not establish the right to possess the
takht.
73.

Notwithstanding that, I find that the defendants

have led evidence through the testimony of their witnesses
that Dharam Chand had allowed Hari Shankar to use the takht
in question.
74.

In this connection, the admission of the witnesses of

the plaintiff that neither Hari Shankar nor defendant No.1
conducts any business from the takht on Tuesdays and that on
Tuesday the entire takht is used by somebody else (the
somebody else has to be Dharam Chand) establishes that there
is some agreement between Hari Shankar and that somebody
else (somebody else has to be Dharam Chand) pertaining to
the right to use the takht.
75.

The suit must fail pertaining to the claim of the

plaintiff to the takht in question. I accordingly decide issues 3,
5 and 8 against the plaintiff and against the defendants.
76.

A preliminary decree is accordingly passed in terms

of para 55 above.
77.

The suit shall now come up for further proceedings
