VIPIN SANGHI, J.
1.

By this order, I propose to decide the following preliminary issue:

“Whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the present suit?”
2.

This preliminary issue was framed by the Court on 23.3.2005,

since the defendant had relied upon the decision of the Supreme

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 1 of 21

Court, reported as AIR 1971 SC 2320, Hatti Vs. Sunder Singh to
contend that the jurisdiction of this Court is barred under Section 185
of the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954 (DLR Act for short) from trying the
present suit. According to the defendants, the relief of declaration of
Bhumidari Rights falls within the exclusive domain of the Revenue
Assistant, and that is the relief claimed by the plaintiff in the suit.
3.

Apart

from

the

aforesaid

objection,

the

defendants

also

advanced lengthy arguments on the issue of maintainability of the suit
and jurisdiction of this court to entertain the suit in the light of the
provision contained in the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. (LA Act for
short). This objection has also been dealt with in this order.
BACKGROUND FACTS
4.

The present suit has been filed by the Plaintiff seeking a

declaration that he is the Bhumidhar of certain lands and that the
Defendants have no right, title or interest in the said land. He is also
seeking the relief of maintenance of status quo for preservation of the
suit property.
5.

Plaintiff purchased Bhumidhari rights in certain agricultural land

measuring 84 Bighas and 11 Biswas situated in Village Malik Pur Kohi
also known as Rangpuri in the National Capital Territory of Delhi from
the original Bhumidhars of the said lands by way of a duly registered
sale deed dated 18.04.1967. Prior to such purchase, a Notification No.
4(98)/64/H&H dated 23.01.1965 under Section 4 of the LA Act, 1894

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 2 of 21

was issued by the then Chief Commissioner of Delhi in respect of some
of the land so purchased by the Plaintiff. Thereafter a declaration vide
notification No. F. 4(98)/64-L&H dated 26.12.1968 was issued under
Section 6 of the LA Act. Notice under Section 9 (1) of the LA Act, was
issued on 15.01.1981 in respect of land of the Plaintiff measuring 80
Bighas and 7 Biswas. Plaintiff preferred a writ petition challenging the
said acquisition proceedings by filing Civil Writ No. 586 / 1981 before
this Court on ground of undue delay in the finalisation of the
acquisition process. On 24.03.1981 the Civil Miscellaneous Application
(C.M. No.865/1981) filed in the above writ was taken up, and the court
passed an order directing the Respondents (including the Defendants
herein) to maintain status quo with regard to possession of land.
However, subsequently the writ petition was dismissed by a Full Bench
of this Court and the appeal was also dismissed by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court. Validity of the acquisition proceedings was upheld.
Plaintiffs Contentions
6.

The said order dated 24.3.1981 was served on the Respondents

on 31.03.1981. Allegedly on the same date an award was signed and
possession report was prepared, whereunder the possession of the
acquired land was recorded as having been taken by the Land
Acquisition Collector. The said possession report is a fake document
and possession of the suit land was never taken by the defendants.
Plaintiff continued to be in possession and was duly recorded in the

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 3 of 21

Girdawri as being in cultivatory possession of the land in the years
1981-82 and 1982-83. The alleged possession report does not mention
the time of commencement of proceedings, nor does it make any
reference to any notice being given to the Plaintiff of the passing of
the award. No member of the Revenue Staff participated in the alleged
process. The entire alleged process of taking possession is thus, an
eyewash and fraudulent, and possession of the land was never taken.
7.

In 1991 the DDA (one of the respondents in the aforesaid writ

petition) filed a contempt petition against the plaintiff, being CCP No.
357/1991, claiming that the order directing maintenance of status quo
was never communicated to the officials of the Respondent in the Writ
Petition (the Defendants in this case) and it was the Plaintiff who had
violated the said status quo order by raising illegal construction on the
said land. The said Contempt Petition came to be dismissed on merits
on 2.07.1999.
8.

By a false report No. 451 dated 11.06.1981 received from

LAC(D), entries in revenue records were changed in favour of the
defendants, both in regard to ownership and possession. Application
dated 13.07.1982 was moved by the Plaintiff before the Tahsildar,
Mehrauli seeking correction of entries in Khasra Girdwari. An order was
passed by the concerned SDM on 09.03.1983 on the basis that the
land stood acquired, and if the applicant was still in possession then it
amounted to encroachment. An appeal was preferred to the Additional

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 4 of 21

Collector who remanded the matter back. In the meanwhile, executive
instructions were passed directing revenue authorities not to record
the name of actual tiller/occupier in the land records, if land was
recorded in the name of Gaon Sabha or the Government. This was
followed by a necessary amendment in the Delhi Land Revenue Rules,
1962. The Plaintiff assailed the amendment to the Rules by way of a
Writ Petition being WP(C) 4094/1992, which came to be allowed vide
order dated 05.12.2001.
9.

The Plaintiff moved another application for correction of entries

in the Khasra Girdwari which was linked with the earlier application
pertaining to Khasra Girdwari of Rabi 1981, Kharif 1981 and Rabi 1982
etc. The Halqa Patwari carried out inspection of the land and
submitted his report dated 18.12.2001 which confirms the actual
possession of the Plaintiff in respect of the suit land.
10.

Plaintiff

has

always

been

in

actual

physical

cultivatory

possession of the entire land continuously and without any interruption
since the said land was purchased in the year 1967 and that the
Plaintiff was never dispossessed under Section 16 of the LA Act and as
such the acquisition proceedings were never completed and land
never acquired. Thus, the Plaintiff remains the absolute right holder as
Bhumidhar without any interruption since 1967.
11.

Page No. 5 of 21

proceedings whereby the possession is claimed to have been taken
over by the Defendants, in violation of an order directing maintainance
of status quo as aforesaid.
12.

For that purpose a civil suit lies before this Court for the

declaration of his status as a Bhumidhar. Since, his status as a
Bhumidhar never came to be validly revoked, the present suit is
maintainable and the Civil Courts jurisdiction is not barred.
DEFENDANTS CONTENTIONS
13.

The land acquisition proceedings are complete and final, as the

challenge of the Plaintiff to the notification under Section 4 and the
declaration under Section 6 of the LA Act failed and the acquisition
proceedings have been upheld even by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.
Moreover, the possession of the suit land was validly taken over and
the same was handed over to the Delhi Development Authority on
31.3.1981. Therefore, the land came to be vested in the government
and was also handed over to the DDA. Thus, there is no question of
Plaintiff being in possession of the land, and since the land was never
released

from acquisition,

the

Plaintiff

cannot claim

to be

a

Bhumidhar. How and when the Plaintiff came to possess the land is not
known.
14.

The suit is an attempt to obtain an order of release of land under

Section 48 of the LA Act. Plaintiff being a Rank Trespasser is not
entitled to the relief claimed under the Specific Relief Act. The

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 6 of 21

provisions of the DLR Act are not applicable after issuance of
notification under Section 4 of the LA Act, and the Plaintiff cannot
therefore be granted relief of Declaration as sought for. Even if Plaintiff
is entitled to the relief of declaration of his rights as a Bhumidhar in
respect of the suit land under the provisions of the DLR Act, the same
can be claimed only before the Authorities constituted under the said
Act. As aforesaid, reliance has been placed on the judgment of the
Supreme Court in Hatti v. Sunder Singh (Supra) wherein the court held
that the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is clearly barred under Section
185 of the DLR Act, read with the First Schedule thereof.
15.

Allegation that the possession was not validly or in fact taken

and that the possession proceedings are false and fabricated are
refuted. The Plaintiff has acquired the suit land in question after the
notification issued under section 4 of the LA Act and as such the
plaintiff is not the owner of the land and thereby not entitled to claim
Bhumidhari rights.
OBJECTION BASED ON DLR ACT
16.

Now, Section 185 of the DLR Act provides:
“185. Cognizance of suits, etc., under this Act.- (1)
Except as provided by or under this Act no court
other than a court mentioned in column 7 of
Schedule I shall, notwithstanding anything contained
in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908),
take cognizance of any suit, application, or
proceedings mentioned in column 3 thereof.

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 7 of 21

(2) Except as hereinafter provided no appeal shall lie
from an order passed under any of the proceedings
mentioned in column 3 of the Schedule aforesaid.
(3) An appeal shall lie from the final order passed by
a court mentioned in column 3 to the court or
authority mentioned in column 8 thereof.

17.

(4) A second appeal shall lie from the final order
passed in an appeal under sub section (3) to the
authority, if any, mentioned against it in column 9 of
the Schedule aforesaid.”

Before analyzing the provisions of the DLR Act we may refer to

the rule of construction applicable to statutes/provisions ousting
jurisdiction of the civil court.
19.

It is well settled that a statute ousting jurisdiction of a civil court

must be strictly constructed, and it is for the party seeking to oust the
jurisdiction of an ordinary civil court to establish that there is no
jurisdiction. (See AIR 1966 SC 1718 para 9; AIR 1967 SC 781 Para 13).
19A. In the case of Smt. Ganga Bai v. Vijay Kumar AIR 1974 SC
1126 the Supreme Court held:

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 8 of 21

“There is an inherent right in every person to
bring a suit of a civil nature and unless the suit
is barred by any statute one may, at one’s
peril, bring a suit of one’s choice. It is no
answer to a suit, howsoever frivolous the
claim, that the law confers no such right to
sue. A suit for maintainability requires no
authority of law and it is enough that no
statute bars the suit.”
20. In Dhula Bhai etc. vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and
Another AIR 1969 SC 78 the Apex Court laid down, inter-alia, the
following principle regarding exclusion of jurisdiction of a civil court.
“Where the statute gives a finality to the
orders of the Special Tribunals the civil courts
jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if
there is adequate remedy to do what the civil
court would normally do in a suit.”
21.

The object of the rule is, that no party/person should be left

remedy less. Necessary corollary to this would be that, if no adequate
remedy is provided for by a special statute through the Forum
established under it for a particular purpose/situation, civil courts
remedy to administer justice cannot be said to be ousted to deal with
even such cases.
22.

Column 3 of schedule 1 of the DLR Act gives the “description of

suit application and other proceedings” and the entry at Sl.No.4 in
column 3 reads “Application for declaration of Bhumidari Rights”.
However, it is not any application, suit or other proceedings for
declaration of Bhumidari rights which the said entry relates to. This
entry in column 3 has to be read in the light of the corresponding

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 9 of 21

entry in column No.2 of the schedule, which enlists the “Section of the
Act”. Therefore, in order to be a suit of the nature prescribed as falling
under the third column, the suit also must be one, where the rights
claimed by the plaintiff/ Petitioner are founded upon a right arising out
of one of the section enumerated under the second column.

The

second column of entry 4 to the schedule refers to Sections 10, 11, 12,
13, 73, 74, 79, and 85 of the DLR Act. A plain reading of Section 185
suggests that a suit the subject matter of which falls within any one or
more of the entries contained in column 2 of the Schedule to the said
Act would only be hit by Section 185, and not otherwise. To state it
differently, the said section does not impose a total bar of jurisdiction
of the civil court, but only imposes a restriction on suits or other legal
proceedings in respect of mattes for which a specific provision is made
in the Act. Any other construction would lead to an incongruity,
namely, there will be a vacuum in areas not covered by the Act, and
the remedy before the civil court would be displaced without replacing
it by alternate forums to seek remedies. Section 185 cannot be said to
put a sweeping and general embargo on the jurisdiction of the civil
court, in all situations. [See (2000) 9 SCC 272].
23.

In Hatti (Supra) the party approaching the civil court had sought

three reliefs from the court. First, a declaration that Bhumidari issued
in the name of the defendant with respect to the suit property was
illegal and beyond jurisdiction; second, a declaration in his own favour

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 10 of 21

under section 11 of the DLR Act; and third, possession of the said land.
The court held that these reliefs were clearly covered by entries 4, 19
and 28 in the schedule attached to the DLR Act. It was for this reason
that the court observed that “all reliefs claimed by the respondent in
the present suit were, thus, within the competent jurisdiction of the
Revenue Assistant, and the civil court had no jurisdiction to entertain
the suit.” Therefore, Hatti (Supra) only lays down that a suit claiming a
relief which is covered by an entry in column 2 in the first schedule
attached to the DLR Act is clearly barred by Section 185. The ratio of
this decision cannot be stretched to contend that all cases relating to
Bhumidari rights/agricultural land filed by a Bhumidar are necessarily
barred by section 185 of the DLR Act. No doubt, the DLR Act is a
complete code in itself. However, it is complete only in respect of
matters dealt with it and not in respect of matters not dealt with it.
Pertinently, there is no residuary provision contained in the said Act,
which could be said to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Revenue
Authorities in respect of all matters, including one like the present.
24.

A bare perusal of the sections enumerated in column 2 of Entry

4 of the Schedule shows that neither of them have been invoked by
the plaintiff in the present case.
25.

Sections 10 to 13, fall under Chapter II of the DLR Act, Part A of

which deals with Declaration of Bhumidhari right, compensation and
land revenue. These sections deal with rights and obligations of the

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 11 of 21

various classes of tenants, existing before the commencement of the
DLR Act, upon its commencement.
26.

Section 73 and 74 pertain to admission to land by a person as a

Bhumidhar/Asami respectively by the Gaon Sabha under Specific
circumstances mentioned therein. Further Section 79, only lays down
that in case of failure to institute a suit for ejectment against an
Asami, it would entitle the said person to become a Bhumidhar in
respect of the land held by him.
27.

Lastly, Section 85 confers the status of a Bhumidhar/Asami on a

person retaining possession of a holding of a Bhumidhar/Asami/Gaon
Sabha without his consent for a period of 3 years, where a suit for his
ejectment is not brought or a decree for dispossession is not executed
within the period of limitation provided. It is evident that none of the
aforementioned provisions apply to the case of the plaintiff.
ANALYSIS OF FACTS / PLEADINGS
28.

Now, reverting to the case of the Plaintiff, it is seen that the

averments as made out in the plaint read with the prayer clause
invariable suggest that in the suit the Plaintiff is only seeking a
declaration that he continues to be a Bhumidhar, as the possession
was never legally taken by the government and the acquisition
process has not been completed. Can it be said then that a suit of
such a nature falls within the ambit of Entry 4 in the First Schedule of
the Delhi Land Reforms Act? In my view the answer is 'No'.

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 12 of 21

29.

On a perusal of the relevant provisions of the DLR Act it

becomes clear that the Plaintiff is not claiming a declaration of his
rights as a Bhumidhar under any of the provisions of the Act as
mentioned herein above. The claim of the Plaintiff is that he had by
way of purchase of Bhumidhari rights from the original Bhumidhars in
1967 itself, acquired Bhumidhari right. His further claim is that the
land

acquisition

proceedings

were

never

completed

by

the

Government and the Plaintiff continues to be a Bhumidhar and seeks a
declaration under Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act for the same.
These issues cannot be adjudicated by, and no relief in respect thereof
can be granted by the Revenue Assistant under the DLR Act. They can
be determined only by a civil court in a civil suit.
OBJECTIONS BASED ON LAND ACQUISITION ACT
30.

To buttress his argument that the suit is not maintainable in

view of the provisions of the LA Act, counsel for the Defendant has
relied on following decisions:

1955).

31.

The aforesaid decisions however are of little assistance in

deciding the preliminary issue at hand. All these judgments fall in the
realm of the Land Acquisition Act, and in any case are not applicable in
the present case for the following reasons:
i)

The question of the validity or legality of the notifications

under Sections 4 and 6 of the LA Act are not the subject matter
of this suit. Therefore, the judgment at Serial No.1 above has no
relevance to this case.
ii)

The present is a suit for seeking a declaration that the

plaintiff continues to be a Bhumidhar, as possession has not
been legally taken from him and for an injunction against
dispossession (though worded as a relief for maintenance of
status quo).

The plaintiff has not sought a relief that the

defendants be restrained against completing

the acquisition

proceedings in a legal manner. The plaintiff has also not sought
any injunction/direction for release of the suit land under

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 14 of 21

Section 48 of the LA Act. Therefore the judgment at serial no.2
has no application to the facts of this case.
iii)

The plaintiff is not claiming the relief that the suit lands

were not covered by the notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of
the LA Act.

The plaintiff does not admit that actual physical

possession of the land in question has been taken over by the
defendants.

On the other hand, in Rampat (supra), the

judgment at Serial no.3 above, the challenge was to the act of
the government whereby the lands of the appellant had been
included in the declaration under Section 6 and the Award under
the LA Act, which had attained finality. Admittedly, in that case,
the actual physical possession had been taken over by the
Government. In those circumstances, the Court took the view
that the acquisition proceedings could not be challenged in a
civil court and, once possession had been taken, the land
vested absolutely and free from all encumbrances in the
Government. In this case, the plaintiff relies on the report of
the Halqa Patwari of 18.12.2001, according to which, the actual
physical possession of the suit lands was found to be that of the
plaintiff. This position was reiterated in the later report dated
4.2.2005.
In the present case, the stand of the defendants is that, on
the same day (31.3.1981) on which the order granting status

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 15 of 21

quo (order dated 24.3.1981 passed in CWP No.586/1981) was
served on the Respondents/ defendants herein, prior to such
service at 11.30 AM, possession had been taken. I find that the
oral submission in respect of the time at which the stay order
was served, and also the submission that possession was taken
prior to service of the stay order do not find any mention in the
written statement of defendant No.3 DDA. Pertinently, even
according to the DDA, possession was taken, inter-alia, on
1.6.1983, i.e. well after the passing of, and service of the order
dated 24.3.1981. The land Acquisition Collector, defendant No.
2, in his written statement claims to have taken possession on
30.3.1981 at a few places in the written statement, while at
various places in the written statement, it is claimed that
possession was taken on 31.3.1981. The order dated 2.7.1999
passed in CCP No. 357/1991 filed by the DDA defendant No. 2 is
relevant, and a portion thereof is reproduced herein below:
“...On 24.3.1981 the Court passed the following order
in C.M.865/81:“Notice for 10.4.1981. Status quo regarding
possession
to
be
maintained
in
the
meanwhile.”
On 10.4.1981 the interim order passed on 24.3.1981
was confirmed by the court. In the meanwhile, an
award was passed in respect of the above mentioned
land on 30.3.1981 under the provisions of the Land
Acquisition Act. Pursuant to the said award the
possession of the land was taken over by the Land
Acquisition Collector and the D.D.A was put in
C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 16 of 21

possession of the land on 31.3.1981. According to
the petitioner herein the interim order passed by the
High Court on 24.3.1981 was not communicated to
the respondents in the writ petition and hence
possession of the land was taken over on 31.3.1981
and the DDA was put in possession of the land on the
same day. According to the respondent herein, the
possession of the land was not actually taken over
and the respondent continued to be in possession of
the land on the strength of the orders passed by the
High Court on 24.3.1981 and 10.4.1981 and that
records were created by the authorities to show that
the possession of the land was taken over on
31.3.1981. Whatever that be, it is not disputed that
when the writ petition came up before the High Court
on 10.4.1981 the respondents in the writ petition did
not inform the court that the possession had been
taken over on 31.3.1981 and consequently the court
confirmed the interim order passed on 24.3.1981.
Even thereafter the respondents in the writ petition
did not move any application for vacating the interim
order or for restraining the petitioner in the writ
petition from being in possession of the land in
question.
The petitioner in the writ petition
continued to be in possession of the land and started
running a secondary school on a part of the land.
The school was granted recognition for class 1 to 8
with effect from the academic session 1989-90. It
was also granted affiliation for secondary classes by
the CBSE on 15.10.1991. Thereupon the DDA filed
this CCP alleging that the respondent herein
committed civil contempt by willfully disobeying the
order passed by this court in CWP 586/81 directing
status quo to be maintained. The respondent has
filed reply denying the allegation in the petition.
2.
In view of the facts stated above the
respondent cannot be said to have willfully
disobeyed the order of the court. The writ petition
was filed by the respondent challenging the land
acquisition proceedings. He sought an interim order
against the respondents in the writ petition against
the
land
acquisition
proceedings
and
his
dispossession from the land. The court by order
dated 24.3.81 directed that status quo regarding
possession be maintained in the meanwhile.
C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 17 of 21

Obviously the direction contained in the order dated
24.3.1981 was to the respondents in the writ petition
and not to the petitioner in the writ petition. The said
order dated 24.3.1981 was confirmed by the court on
10.4.1981. The respondents did not dispute the
possession of the writ petition before the court on
10.4.1981. Therefore, if the writ petition continued
in possession of the land on the strength of orders
dated 24.3.1981 and 10.4.1981 and started running
a school in the land in his possession he cannot be
said to have willfully disobeyed the order passed by
the court on 24.3.1991 and 10.4.1981 by which the
respondents in the writ petition were directed to
maintain status quo regarding the petitioner’s
possession of the land.”
Consequently, the decision in Rampat (Supra), has no
application to the facts of the present case.
iv)

In the present case the plaintiff has not raised a dispute

as to whether or not symbolic possession suffices in law. The
contention of the plaintiff is that neither symbolic possession,
nor actual possession of the suit properties have been legally
taken by the defendants. In my view, it is for this court to
determine whether actual physical possession or even symbolic
possession was taken by the defendants prior to the service of
status quo order as aforesaid, and if not, the validity of the said
possession proceedings in the face of the said order of status
quo. The determination of these issues is not contemplated
under the LA Act and, these being disputed questions of fact,
can appropriately be determined in a civil suit. Consequently,

the decision in Nagin Chand (Supra) at Sl. No.4 has no
application to the facts of this case.
v)

The judgment at serial no.5 above also does not advance

the submission of the defendants, since this judgment relates to
a case where the land owner had challenged the award in a civil
suit and the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that acquisition
proceedings could not have been challenged in a civil suit. As
aforesaid the present

is not a suit challenging either the

acquisition proceedings or the award made by the Land
Acquisition Collector.
vi)

The five decisions at serial nos. 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 above

deal with the rights of the transferee of land that has been
notified for acquisition under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition
Act viz-a-viz the rights of the Government.

The Hon’ble

Supreme Court has held that any transfer of property after it
has been notified for acquisition under Section 4 would be void
against the government.
The purchase of the suit property by the plaintiff was
through a valid sale deed subsequent to the issuance of
notification under Section 4 of the LA Act. It is not the plaintiff’s
case that on account of the sale executed in his favour by his
predecessor in interest, the respondents cannot proceed with
the acquisition proceedings. On the basis of the said sale, the

C.S. (OS) No. 927/2002

Page No. 19 of 21

plaintiff is not claiming a higher title than that of his
predecessor in interest.
It cannot be said that no transfer of property notified
under Section 4 of the LA Act can take place, or the purchaser
cannot ever become a Bhumidhar. It is not the Bhumidhari
rights so acquired which are the subject matter of these
proceedings, and the acquisition proceedings obviously do not
get defeated only because the sale has taken place.
The prior issuance of the notification under Section 4 of
the LA Act, in my view, does not have the effect of taking away
the rights of the transferee to contend that he remains a
Bhumidhar of the land, since the

possession thereof has not

been taken legally by the Government.

No doubt such a

transferee would not be entitled to challenge the validity of the
notifications issued under the Land Acquisition Act, or oppose
the taking of possession by the Land Acquisition authorities. He
would, nonetheless, be entitled to say that his possession
should not be disturbed except in accordance with law.
aforesaid,

in

the

present

case

neither

the

acquisition

proceedings are under challenge in the suit nor is the plaintiff
seeking an injunction to restrain the defendants from legally
taking over the possession of the acquired land.

It would

therefore be open to the defendant to, even now, take over

Page No. 20 of 21

possession in a legal manner and the plaintiff possibly cannot
oppose the same.

However, he is not precluded from saying

that neither actual physical possession nor even the paper
possession or symbolic possession has been taken in a legal
manner.

of

the

matter,

the

preliminary

issue

of

maintainability of the suit is decided in favour of the Plaintiff and
against the defendant.
