S. L. BHAYANA, J.
Writ Petition (Criminal) No.1858/2006 has been filed
with the prayer for setting aside the order dated 15.08.2006
passed

by

Sh.Rakesh

Kumar,

learned

Metropolitan

Magistrate, Rohini Courts, Delhi. The Petitioner has further
prayed that a direction be issued to the Superintendent,
Tihar Jail for referring him to an appropriate hospital for

medical check-up with regard to the injuries sustained by
him.
2.

The case set out in the writ petition is that

Smt.Veena, on whose behest FIR No.1161/2006 was lodged
at P.S. Sultan Puri, owed the Petitioner a certain sum of
money. The Petitioner has alleged that since Smt.Veena was
on friendly terms with the SHO, PS-Sultan Puri, he and
Smt.Veena connived and concocted a false and fictitious case
against the Petitioner and registered an FIR under Sections
354/452/506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Thereafter, on
14.08.2006, the petitioner was arrested and was very badly
beaten up by the Police at PS-Sultan Puri.
3.

The Petitioner filed a bail application, as well as an

application under Section 54 Cr.PC for constituting a medical
board for conducting medical examination of the petitioner.
4.

Learned Metropolitan Magistrate dismissed the

Petitioner’s bail application as well as the application under
Section 54 Cr.PC. For the benefit of the judgment, the order
passed by Sh.Rakesh Kumar, MM, Rohini Courts, Delhi is
reproduced hereinbelow:
“FIR NO. 1161/06 PS SULTAN PURI

J.C.

till

The State has filed its status report in this case.

The facts of the case as set out in the status report are as
follows.
6.

On 24.07.2006, information was received that a

quarrel had taken place at A-619, Gram Sabha, Pooth Kalan,
Delhi. Smt Veena’s statement was recorded to the effect that
the Petitioner had engaged her for cooking his food for a sum
of Rs.1500 per month. During this period, when Smt.Veena
cooked meals for the Petitioner, the Petitioner had attempted
to molest her on several occasions because of which she had
shifted out of that locality. He followed Smt.Veena to her

present address and while she was alone at home, the
Petitioner forcibly caught her and tried to outrage her
modesty. On the basis of statement of Smt.Veena, a case
under Section 354/452/306 IPC was registered at P.S.
Sultan Puri vide FIR No.1161/2006 on 24.07.06.

An

investigation was conducted and the Petitioner was arrested
on 14.08.2006.
7.

The Petitioner has argued that the learned MM has

failed to follow the guidelines laid down by the Supreme
Court in Sheela Barsala vs. State of Maharasthra, AIR 1983
SC 378, wherein it was laid down that it is the duty of the
Magistrate to inform the accused of their right to medical
examination,

if

he

has

complained

of

torture

and

maltreatment. He argued that the learned MM has dismissed
his application under Section 54 Cr.PC without assigning any
reason for the same.
8.

I have heard learned counsel for the accused as

well as the State and have carefully gone through the petition
and the status report filed by the State.
9.

From a careful reading of the petition, without

going into the merits of the present case, it is to be noted that
though the power of the High Court under Article 226 is very

wide, however, the High Court should not entertain a writ
petition in cases where an alternative remedy is available. In
my opinion, therefore, the writ petition is not maintainable in
view of the fact that alternative and efficacious remedy by
way of appeal in respect of the rejection of the bail application
was available to the Petitioner.
10.

The second prayer of the Petitioner for directing the

Superintendent, Tihar Jail to refer the Petitioner to an
appropriate

hospital,

in

order

to

conduct

medical

examination on his person regarding the injuries has become
infructuous as medical examination report dated 15.08.06 of
the Petitioner has been submitted before this Court. Hence,
the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in Sheela
Barsala’s case (supra) have been duly complied with by the
State.
11.

In view of the aforesaid discussion, the writ petition

is not maintainable and the same is, therefore, dismissed.
