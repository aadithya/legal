1.

This is an application for impleadment filed on behalf of

Thomson press (India) Ltd. claiming that it is the owner in respect of the
suit property. It is claimed that the suit property was sold to the applicant
by the defendants by sale deeds executed on 03.04.2001.

2.

The suit has been filed by the plaintiff seeking specific

performance of an agreement to sell dated 29.05.1986 allegedly entered
into between the plaintiff and the two defendants. The learned counsel for
the plaintiff drew my attention to the order passed on the very first day
when the suit came up for hearing on 04.11.1991. The defendants were

represented on caveat and the learned counsel for the defendants had stated
on that date that till the disposal of IA No. 11488/1991 the defendants
would not transfer or alienate the flat in question. The said application (IA
No. 11488/1991) was disposed of on 26.02.2007 and the order dated
04.11.1991 was made absolute for the duration of the suit.

3.

The learned counsel for the plaintiff, therefore, submits that any

sale or transfer, which was purported to have been made after the order
dated 04.11.1991, would be in gross violation of the undertaking given on
behalf of the defendants. Apart from this, the learned counsel for the
plaintiff referred to a decision of a learned Single Judge of this Court in the
case of Sanjay Gupta v. Smt. Kala Wati: 85 (2000) DLT 828 for the
proposition that in a specific performance suit the lis is between the parties
to the agreement and strangers cannot be impleaded as parties.

This

decision was appealed against before the Division Bench, which dismissed
the appeal by a judgment and /or order dated 19.01.2001 passed in
FAO(OS) 5/2000. The Division Bench took the view that in a suit for
specific performance the Court has to decide the existence of an agreement
between the parties and if the agreement is found to be valid in law and
enforceable, the Court will grant a decree for its performance. The lis is
between parties to the agreement only. The appellant in that case was
nowhere mentioned in the agreement which was the subject matter of the
suit for specific performance and, therefore, the appellant was held to be a
complete stranger so far as the controversy in the suit was concerned. The

Division Bench observed that the law on this point was well settled and
held that a third party like the appellant therein need not to be impleaded as
a party in a suit for specific performance as such a person was neither a
necessary nor a proper party. The matter was taken up to the Supreme
Court by way of a Special Leave Petition being SLP(C) 9761-9763/2001.
The Supreme Court had dismissed the Special Leave Petitions by on order
dated 01.10.2001.

4.

The present application is entirely covered by the said decision.

As such, the present application for impleadment would not be
maintainable. The same is dismissed.
