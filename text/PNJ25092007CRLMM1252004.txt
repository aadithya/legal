PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

FIR No.66/03 dated 22.2.2003
under Section 498-A/406/34 IPC
PS Paschim Vihar.
Order dated 11.5.2005 records that the complainant

has shifted to Orissa.
2.

Petitioners who are the husband and the in-laws of the

complainant Jasmeet pray that afore-noted FIR be quashed
because the complainant has settled

her

disputes

with

her

husband and her in-laws and has consented that the FIR may be
quashed.
3.

The settlement between the parties as stated in the

petition is sought to be made good with reference to the
pleadings of the complainant and first petitioner, her husband, in
the petition filed under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act
seeking dissolution of their marriage by mutual consent. In para
6 of the said petition filed under the joint signatures of the
parties, it is recorded as under:-

4.

“6.
That the petitioner No.2 has received a
sum of Rs.4,50,000/- (Rupees Four lac fifty
thousand only) in lump sum for past, present and
future maintenance and for remaining dowry
articles, istridhan, etc. Out of this amount of
Rs.4,50,000/- a sum of Rs.3,17,000/- has been paid
by way of FDR to the petitioner No.2 by the
petitioner in pursuance to order of Hon'ble High
Court, Delhi passed in Crl.M.(M) No.2577/2003. This
amount shall be utilized by the petitioner No.2 at
her discretion. The petitioner No.1 shall have right
in the said amount of the FDR. Remaining amount
of Rs.1,33,000/- has been paid today in cash in the
Court itself by the petitioner to the petitioner No.2
towards full and final settlement as referred to
supra. The petitioner No.2 would not be entitled to
claim any maintenance from the petitioner No.1 in
future and the amount has been paid in full and
final settlement of claim of the petitioner No.2 in the
Court itself.”
Further, pursuant to the petition seeking dissolution of

the marriage by mutual consent, reliance

has

been

placed

upon the judgment and decree dated 11.12.2003 passed by the
learned District Judge, Ambala in HMA Case No.175. The same
records that the husband has paid to the complainant Rs.4.5 lacs
as stated in para 6 of the joint petition filed by the husband and
the wife.
5.

In

para

2

of

the

judgment

and

decree

dated

11.12.2003 it has been recorded as under:-

6.

“2.
Joint statement of the parties was
recorded today. As per that statement the parties
started living separate from each other due to
temperamental differences. They have settled all
their claims of present as well as future
maintenance.
Petitioner
No.1
has
paid
Rs.4,50,000/- to petitioner No.2 towards future
maintenance, out of which an amount of
Rs.1,33,000/- was paid today before the Court while
the remaining amount of Rs.3,17,000/- has been
deposited in fixed deposits pursuant to the orders of
the Hon'ble High Court, Delhi, which petitioner No.2
Smt.Jasmeet Kaur will be entitled to withdraw. The
parties have also decided to withdraw the cases
filed by them against each other including the
criminal case bearing FIR No.66 of 2003 under
Section 498-A/406/34 IPC registered at Police
Station, Paschim Vihar, Delhi.
Since consent of the complainant for quashing of the

afore-noted FIR has been recorded in judicial proceedings, I
dispose of the petition quashing the afore-noted FIR.
7.

I may note at this stage that learned counsel for the

State has no objection if

FIR

is

quashed

for

the

reason

a

matrimonial dispute between a husband and a wife has been
settled.
8.

No costs.
