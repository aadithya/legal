RSA.No.295/2006
1.
It is urged by learned counsel for the appellant that
a
page 1 of 5

substantial question of law arises for consideration in the
instant appeal.

Counsel states that the question of law of

substantial importance which arises for consideration is: on the
facts and circumstances of the case has it been proved that the
respondent No. 1 bank has discharged the obligation of duty of
reasonable care when it permitted withdrawal of the amount in
sum of Rs.47,000/- from the account of the appellant?
2.

Relevant facts are that the appellant maintained an

account with respondent No. 1 being current account No. 3030.
From out of the cheque book issued by the bank, cheque
bearing No. 510284 was alleged to be misused by Yagya
Bhattaria an employee of the plaintiff and after forging
signatures of the plaintiff, Rs.47,000/- were withdrawn.

The

cheque in question was drawn on self.
3.

In the written statement filed by defendant No.1, it

was specifically pleaded that the bank followed all norms and
banking procedures in entertaining the cheque and that the
signatures on the cheque matched the specimen signatures of
the plaintiff when account was opened.

It was specifically

pleaded that the bank had neither any reason nor any occasion
to suspect the genuineness of the signatures of the plaintiff on
the cheque.

4.

These averments have been specifically made in

para 1 of the preliminary objections in the written statement
filed by the bank. It was further stated in the written statement
that in letter dated 30.10.1998 written by the plaintiff, plaintiff
had admitted that the signatures on the cheque appeared to be
genuine.
5.

The

learned

Trial

Judge

decreed

the

suit

by

recording a finding that in its pleading contained in the written
statement the stand of the bank was, (to quote from the
judgment of the learned Trial Judge):- “the stand of the
defendant bank is not that no forgery was committed, rather,
the stand is that forgery was committed by defendant No. 3
and 4 and there was no negligence on behalf of the bank.”
6.

Learned

counsel

for

the

appellant

very

fairly

concedes that aforesaid reproduction of the pleadings of the
bank as is recorded by the learned Trial Judge is incorrect.
7.

Be that as it may, learned Appellate Court has

corrected the incorrect reproduction of the pleadings of the
bank. It has set aside the judgment of the learned Trial Judge.
8.

S.S.Aulakh,

Senior

Manager

of

the

Bank

who

appeared as DW-1 proved the specimen signatures of the
plaintiff and the precaution taken by the bank when the cheque
page 3 of 5

was permitted to be encashed.
9.

The only cross examination of DW-1 is as under:“x
x
plaintiff.

10.

x by Sh. Amitabh Rajat, Ld. Counsel for the

I have carefully gone through my affidavit
Ex. D-1 before signing the same. I am working with
the Bharat Nagar branch of the defendant Bank w.e.f
21st Nov. 2002. We identify filed the signature of the
customer from the signature cards which are retained
by the bank. I have filed the specimen signature of
the plaintiff on record. It is wrong to suggest I am
deposing falsely.”
Learned Appellate Judge has noted that except for

stating that his signatures were forged, plaintiff led no
evidence to substantiate the plea.

Learned Appellate Judge

has noted that not even a handwriting expert was examined.
Thus, it has been opined that the plaintiff had failed to prima
facie establish that the cheque was forged.
11.

In my opinion, issue which needed to be adjudicated

was whether the bank exercised the duty of reasonable care
when cheque was presented for encashment.
12.

The testimony of DW-1 establishes the duty of

reasonable care taken by the bank.

As noted hereinabove,

DW-1 was hardly subjected to any cross examination.
13.

Thus, it has to be held that the bank successfully

discharged the burden of proving the duty of reasonable care.

14.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

15.

LCR be returned forthwith.

16.

No costs.
