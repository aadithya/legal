1.

On 11th August, 2000 the petitioner was allotted a shop on

compassionate ground as his father an employee of DDA had died in harness
on 29th September, 1992. On 7th September, 2000, respondent issued an
allotment letter for a shop measuring 15.32 sq.mt. to the petitioner on
premium of Rs.2,63,900/-. Payments were to be made by the petitioner and
possession slip dated 28th February, 2002 was issued.
2.

On 2nd March, 2002, the petitioner received letter dated 6/21st February,

2002 demanding enhanced premium of Rs,7,48,500/- as against the original
demand of Rs.2,63,900/-. The enhanced premium is under challenge in the
present Writ Petition.

3.

It is the case of the respondent-DDA that the original allotment was

provisional and therefore DDA is entitled to demand enhanced premium. In
this regard, my attention has been drawn to the letter dated 7th September,
2000 and the word “provisional” written on the top right side of the said letter.
4.

I am unable to accept the contention of the respondent-DDA. The word

'provisional' written on the top of the said letter, does imply and mean that the
cost price mentioned in the letter was provisional and subject to
enhancement. Careful perusal of the said letter indicates that the petitioner
was required to comply with the terms and conditions of DDA (Management
and Disposal of Housing Estates) Regulation, 1968 and the terms and
conditions communicated along with the application form. As far as premium
is concerned, it was categorically stated that the shop was being allotted on a
premium of Rs.2,63,900/- and monthly installment payable was Rs.8,772/-.
Other charges payable by the petitioner were also communicated. Petitioner
was required to make payment as per Clauses 4 and 5 of the letter dated 7 th
September, 2000 which are reproduced below:“4. The premium of the shop allotted to you is
Rs.2,63,900.00. The monthly instalment payable is
Rs.8,772.00.
5. You are now called upon to deposit the amount
detailed below within 60 days from the date of issue
of this letter and to submit a certified copy of the

challan showing payment as proof thereof, in the
manner mentioned below:
i.
ii.
iii.

25% of the reserved price shop/stall platform :
Rs.65,975.00
Documentation charges : Rs. 45.00
Annual maintenance charges (1% of premium) : Rs.
2,639.00
Total to be deposited : Rs. 68,659.00
(Sixty Eight Thousand Six hundred and Fifty nine)”

4.

If the respondent-DDA had reserved their right to enhance and charge a

higher amount, it should have clearly specified. The word 'provisional' on the
other hand clearly refers to compliance with the other requirements mentioned
in the letter dated 7th September, 2000 which read as under:“You are also required to produce, if you have not
already submitted the same along with your application
the following:
(a) Attested copy of Ration Card.
(b) Affidavit duly attested as mentioned in clause of the
Terms and Conditions with signature.
(c.) Affidavit duly attested, that you or you spouse not
taken any benefit of Commercial allotment from DDA on
previous occasion, under this quota or any other
quotas/scheme.
(d) Terms & Conditions duly attested from Notary Public
and specimen signature duly attested.
(e) Undertaking regarding payment of balance premium
with 6% interest p.a. Duly attested by a Notary
Public/Executive Magistrate.
(f) Affidavit duly attested regarding source of Finance.

(g) Affidavit duly attested regarding marriage status.”
5.

A similar issue had also arisen before a Division Bench of this Court in

LPA No. 76/2005 decided on 20th September, 2007 titled DDA versus Mukesh
Kumar. Identical plea raised by the DDA was examined and it was, inter alia,
held as under:“8. It is submitted before us by the counsel appearing
for the appellant that the price fixed was provisional as
on the top of the letter dated 31st August, 2000 the
word “provisional” was mentioned. Relying on the
same, it was also submitted that the aforesaid
mentioning of the word “provisional” establishes that
the premium of the shop allotted to the respondent was
a provisional price, which could be increased later on
and in terms thereof a revised demand letter was rightly
issued to respondent. We are, however, unable to
agree with the aforesaid contentions raised by the
counsel appearing for the appellant. In paragraph 4 of
the letter dated 31st August, 2000 in categorical terms it
is stated that the premium of the shop allotted to the
respondent was Rs.1,53,500/-. It is not indicated
therein that the said price was provisional. Other
clauses of the letter also support the above
observations. The term “provisional” appearing in the
letter means that the allotment itself was provisional i.e.
subject to the respondent complying with various
formalities and making payment in terms thereof.
9. The price fixed, as appearing in clauses 4 and 5 of
the letter, specifically mentions that the price of the
shop will be Rs.1,53,500/- and how this amount is to be
paid. There was no other indicated stating that the said
price could be revised or enhanced at a later stage. It
was for the appellant DDA to be clear and explicitly
stated that the price stated can be revised and
thereupon it was for the respondent to accept or reject
the offer, considering various aspects including his

pocket. The respondent also belongs to a socially and
economically backward group and is a son of a
Gardener of the appellant, who had died in harness.”
6.

In these circumstances, the Writ Petition is allowed. Impugned demand

is quashed.
No costs.
