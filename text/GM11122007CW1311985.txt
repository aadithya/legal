GITA MITTAL, J(Oral)
1.

This writ petition has been filed by Shri Kesho Dass Bhutani assailing the orders

dated 24th May, 1976; 4th June, 1976; and 7th June, 1976 passed by the competent
authority under the Delhi Land Holdings (Ceiling) Act, 1960 as amended by
Amendment Act of 1975 and the notification dated 30th June, 1976 published under
Section 6(3) and 21st April, 1977 under Section 9(3) of the said Act whereby the
competent authority had declared the land in question situated in Village Mandoli,
Delhi as excess land. The facts to the extent relevant are noticed
-2hereinafter.
2.

The petitioner has pointed out that he is in possession of land comprised in pre-

consolidation Khasra nos. 352(8-2), 353(4-19) measuring 13 bighas and 1 biswas postconsolidation Khasra no.

11/12/2(3-18), 11/13/1(1-07), 11/18(4-10), 11/19(4-16),

11/22(4-16) and 11/23(4-16) measuring 24 bighas and 3 biswas situated in Village
Mandauli, Illaqa Shahdara, Delhi since 23rd December, 1957. It has been urged that
this land was owned by one Shri Jagmer Singh. The petitioner was granted lease for
such land for establishing and operation of a brick field and for manufacture of bricks
as back as in the year 1957 coupled with transfer of land which was still in force. He
was granted an irrevocable licence. Placing reliance on the provisions of Sections 84
and 85 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954, the petitioner has claimed that he had
acquired bhoomidari rights on the subject land.
3.

It appears that Shri Jagmer Singh, the owner of the land expired on 15th March,

1968. Thereafter, Shri Tej Partap Singh, respondent no. 3 herein is stated to have
illegally got the said land mutated in his name behind the back of and without any
notice to the petitioner.
4.

The petitioner points out that consolidation operations in the village

commenced in the year 1971-72 and the land of the petitioner was transposed into new
Killa numbers as noticed hereinabove.
-3Reliance is placed on the revenue records to contend that the petitioner's rights
were duly recorded in the concerned khasra girdawaries.
The writ petitioner also claims to have remained in exclusive, absolute and
continuous occupation and possession of the subject land in his own right as owner.
During the pendency the original petitioner died and his son has been brought

on record as his LRs. The other LRs had placed their no objections.
5.

Mr. Vipin K. Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that during the

consolidation operations at the time of preparation and confirmation of the scheme,
the land was reserved in the name of the original right holders.
6.

This writ petition has been filed inasmuch as that during the course of

consolidation operation of the village, the lands of Sardar Jagmer Singh were
amalgamated with the land of respondent no. 3 Shri Tej Partap Singh for determining
the excess area with respondent no. 3 in which the petitioner has claimed rights.
It is in this view of the matter, the impugned orders dated 24th May, 1976, 4th
June, 1976 and 7th June, 1976 came to be passed holding that the land of the petitioner,
when treated as part of the holding of the respondent no. 3, was excess land within the
meaning of Section 4 of the
-4Delhi Land Holdings (Ceiling) Act, 1960.
The petitioner was however not issued any notice of the proceedings conducted
by respondent nos. 1 and 2 and the respondent no. 3 have also made no efforts to
contest the proceedings.
7.

The admitted position is that the respondent no. 3 did not file any return. The

impugned orders are stated to be passed on information collected behind the back of
the respondent no. 3 as well as the petitioner by the competent authority while
effecting determination under Sections 6(3) and 9(3) of the statute.
8.

The petitioner has filed this writ petition assailing the orders dated 24 th May,

1976, 4th June, 1976 and 7th June, 1976 premised on its primary contention that

respondent no. 3 has no right, title and interest in the subject lands which have been
validly transferred in favour of the petitioner by the deceased Shri Jagmer Singh.
9.

There is no real contest to the afore-noticed factual narration on behalf of the

respondents. The petitioner has drawn my attention to the pronouncement of this
court reported at 72 (1998) DLT 157 Roop Kaur Vs. Union of India wherein a
similar order of the competent authority under the Delhi Land Holdings (Ceiling) Act,
1960 was assailed before this court on grounds akin to the challenge laid before this
court.
10.

It appears that Sardar Jagmer Singh from whom the petitioner had
-5-

acquired right, title and interest in the subject land, was the owner of a large tracts of
land in Village Mandoli. Apart from the land which was transferred in favour of the
petitioner, one Smt. Roop Kaur had claimed entitlement to another portion of land.
This land had also been claimed by Shri Tej Partap Singh (respondent no. 3), who in
the situation similar to that in the instant case, managed to get mutation of the land
over which Smt. Roop Kaur was claiming rights in her favour. The land over which
Smt. Roop Kaur was claiming entitlement and ownership was also the subject matter
of another order passed on 4th June, 1976 by the competent authority under the Delhi
Land Holdings (Ceiling) Act, 1960 dismissing the application of the said Roop Kaur
and rejecting her return.
11.

These orders were assailed by way of Writ Petition (C) No. 417/1977 which was

decided on 20th February, 1998 and has been reported at 72 (1998) DLT 157 Roop
Kaur Vs. Union of India.

12.

The Apex Court by its order dated 16th October, 2000 disposed of the Special

Leave Petition (C) No. 4969/1999 entitled Union of India Vs. Roop Kaur (Dead)
through LRs.
13.

The respondents are legally required to examine the rights claimed by the

petitioner which have been set up before this court as well and to arrive at a conclusion
with regard to the correctness thereof.
14.

Apart from the fact that the petitioner has claimed rights acquired
-6-

from Shri Jagmer Singh under a licence, however, the circumstances in which the
impugned orders dated 24th May, 1976, 4th June, 1976 and 7th June, 1976 have been
passed against the petitioner were similar to the circumstances in which the impugned
orders passed against Smt. Roop Kaur are concerned.
This court has set aside the order dated 4th June, 1976 in Roop Kaur's case and
the order affirming the same and directed the statutory authorities to have a relook in
the matter giving full consideration to the rights claimed by Smt. Roop Kaur.
15.

It appears that Shri Tej Partap Singh had filed an application before competent

authority claiming rights over the subject land which was rejected by the competent
authority by an order passed on 7th June, 1976. Shri Tej Partap Singh had incorrectly
laid a claim that he is using the land for agricultural purposes which was rejected.
Be that as it may, certainly, the rights of the petitioner were not placed before
the competent authority at the time of passing of the order dated 4 th June, 1976 or at
the time of passing of the order dated 7th June, 1976. After passing of these orders, the
respondents have issued notification under Section 6(3) holding that the subject land

is excess land in the hands of Shri Tej Partap Singh who has also been referred to as
the owner. The respondents thereafter issued a notification dated 21st April,
-71977 under Section 9(3) of the Land Holdings (Ceiling) Act, 1960 declaring the list of
the subject land held by Shri Tej Partap Singh in excess of the ceiling limit which was
required to be acquired under the statutory provisions.
16.

The impugned notifications dated 30th June, 1976 and 21st April, 1977 are

premised on the correctness of the orders dated 24th May, 1976, 4th June, 1976 and 7th
June, 1976 and consequently, cannot be sustained as well.
Accordingly, the orders of the competent authority dated 24th May, 1976, 4th
June, 1976 and 7th June, 1976 as well as the Gazette Notification dated 30th June, 1976
and 21st April, 1977 are hereby set aside and quashed.
The competent authority shall re-examine the matter having regard to the
claimed rights of the petitioner herein.
Such proceedings shall be completed within a period of four months after giving
notice to all concerned parties in accordance with law.
This writ petition is allowed in the above terms.
