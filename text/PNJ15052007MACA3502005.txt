10.
most

The possession of one's own body is the first and
valuable

of

all

human

rights

and

while

awarding

compensation for bodily injuries this primary element is to be
kept in mind. Bodily injury is to be treated as a deprivation
which entitles a claimant to damages. The amount of damages
varies on account of gravity of bodily injury. Though it is
impossible to equate money with human suffering, agony and
personal deprivation, the Court and Tribunal should make an
honest and serious attempt to award damages so far as money
can compensate the loss. Regard must be given to the gravity
and degree of deprivation as well as the degree of awareness of
the deprivation. Damages awarded in personal injury cases
must be substantial and not token damages.
11.

The general principle which should govern the
Page 3 of 15

assessment of damages in personal injury cases is that the
Court should award to injured person such a sum as will put him
in the same position as he would have been in if he had not
sustained the injuries.
12.

Broadly

speaking,

while

fixing

an

amount

of

compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the damages
have to be assessed separately as pecuniary damages and non
pecuniary damages.

Pecuniary damages are those which the

victim has actually incurred and which is capable of being
calculated in terms of money.

Whereas, non pecuniary

damages are those which are incapable of being assessed by
arithmetical calculations.
13.

As noted herein above, damages have to be assessed

separately as pecuniary damages and non pecuniary damages.
In the instant case, Tribunal has awarded Rs.7,09,850/- under
the head 'pecuniary damages' and Rs.3,25,,000/- under the
head 'non-pecuniary damages'.

I shall deal with each head

separately.
Non-pecuniary Damages:
14.

Tribunal has awarded Rs.3,25,000/- under this head.

Break-up of the compensation awarded under this head is as
follows:Page 4 of 15

(i)

Pain and suffering

:

Rs.1,00,000/-

(ii)

Permanent disability/
Loss of amenities of life

:

Rs.2,00,000/-

(iii)
Loss of marriage prospects
:
Rs.25,000/15.
Learned counsel for the appellant contends that
compensation awarded by the Tribunal under this head is
excessive. He particularly stresses that award of Rs.2,00,000/for permanent disability/loss of amenities of life is excessive.
16.

In order to properly appreciate the contentions

advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant, I note the
following judgments:(i)

B.N.Kumar vs. D.T.C., 118 (2005) DLT 36.
In said case, injured sustained crush injuries on his

right leg leading to its amputation above knee in a road
accident on 5th November 1987.

He suffered a permanent

disability of 85%. Noting various judgments wherein Courts had
awarded Rs.3,00,000/- under the head non-pecuniary damages,
a Single Judge of this Court awarded Rs.75,000/- for 'pain and
suffering' and Rs.2,00,000/- for 'continuing disability suffered by
him'.

Thus, a total of Rs.2,75,000/- was awarded under this

head.

From the afore noted judicial decisions, a trend which

emerges is that between the years 1985 to 1990, Courts have
been awarding about Rs.3,00,000/- under the head 'non
pecuniary

damages'

for

amputation

of

leg

resulting

in

permanent disability of 50% and above.
18.

In

the

instant

case,

Tribunal

has

awarded

Rs.3,25,000/- under the head 'non pecuniary damages'. Thus,
award of the Tribunal under the head 'non pecuniary damages'
Page 9 of 15

is just, fair and reasonable.
Pecuniary damages:
19.

Tribunal has awarded Rs.7,09,850/- under the head

'pecuniary damages'.

Learned counsel for the appellant

challenges the award under pecuniary damages on two counts.
One, compensation of Rs.25,000/- awarded by the Tribunal for
medical expenses is excessive.

Two, Tribunal has applied

incorrect principles of law while determining compensation to
the injured for loss of earning capacity.
20.
contended

On the issue of medical expenses, learned counsel
that injured had placed on record medical bills

totaling Rs.1,744/-. But, counsel stated that Tribunal committed
an error by awarding Rs.25,000/- to the injured for medical
expenses.
21.

It is relevant to note that compensation in sum of

Rs.1,000/- has been awarded by the Tribunal for future medical
expenses.
22.

An artificial limb was implanted on his right leg. The

same would require replacement every 2 or 3 years.
23.

In the decision reported as Nagappa Vs. Gurudayal

Singh 2003 ACJ 12, noting that artificial leg implanted on the leg
of the injured would have to be changed every two to three
Page 10 of 15

years, Supreme Court awarded compensation in sum of
Rs.1,00,000/- to meet the said future expenses.
24.

Thus, compensation in sum of Rs.1,000/- awarded by

the Tribunal for future medical expenses is inadequate.
25.

Therefore, I find no infirmity in Tribunal awarding

Rs.25,000/- to the injured for medical expenses.
26.

Tribunal has awarded Rs.6,76,350/- to the injured for

loss of earning capacity.
27.

Tribunal has assessed damages for loss of earning

capacity by applying the multiplier method.
28.

I note that injured had stated that he was a labourer.

In absence of any evidence, documentary or otherwise, to
establish the earnings of the injured, Tribunal has rightly
determined the income of the injured on the basis of the
minimum wages notified under the Minimum Wages Act.
Tribunal has placed injured in the category of unskilled labour.
Minimum wages for an unskilled labour as on 1.2.2003 were
Rs.2,783/- per month.

This figure has been adopted by the

Tribunal as the monthly income of the deceased at the time of
the accident.
29.

Noting that to neutralize increase in cost of living and

price index, minimum wages increased from time to time,
Page 11 of 15

Tribunal has assumed that earnings of the deceased would have
doubled by the time he would have left gainful employment.
Thus, mean average income of the deceased has been
determined as Rs.4,175/- per month.
30.

It is now well settled that while estimating future loss

of income, the court has to take into account future prospects of
the injured (See K.Narsimha Murthi Vs. The Manager, Oriental
Insurance Co. Ltd. & Anr. 2004 ACJ 1109). Thus, Tribunal has
rightly considered future increase in minimum wage while
awarding compensation for loss of earning capacity. I note that
minimum wage tend to increase by 100% every 10 years.
31.

Increase in minimum wages is not akin to future

prospects for the reason inflation eats into the purchasing power
of the rupee and to neutralise the falling power of the rupee,
wages are increased.
32.

Considering that the injured was aged 26 years at

the time of the accident, multiplier of 18 has been applied by
the Tribunal.
33.

In the decision reported as U.P. State Road Transport

Corporation Vs. Trilok Chandra & Ors. (1996) 4 SCC 362,
Supreme Court has held that the highest multiplier of 18 has to
be applied for the age group of 21 years to 25 years.
Page 12 of 15

34.

In the instant case, injured was aged 26 years at the

time of the accident. Noting the Trilok Chandra's case (supra),
correct multiplier in the instant case is 18. Thus, multiplier of
18 adopted by the Tribunal is fair and reasonable.
35.
disability.

Admittedly, injured had suffered 60% permanent
Tribunal has taken functional disability suffered by

the injured as 75%. Thus, total compensation is determined by
the Tribunal as Rs.4,175 x 12 x 18 x 75% = Rs.6,73,350/-.
36.

The question is whether Tribunal is right in assessing

functional disability suffered by the appellant as 75%.
37.

While estimating future loss of income, the effect of

the earning capacity ought to be judged in the light of the
importance of the loss of permanently impaired limb in the
vocation or profession or employment career of the injured
person. The nature of work or business has to be considered
and the extent of disablement cannot be indifferent to the
nature of the work.
38.

In the instant case, injured was working as a

labourer.

The nature of business of the injured is such that

amputation of left leg will seriously hamper his earning capacity
as his movement would be restricted.
39.

However, in my opinion, functional disability of 75%
Page 13 of 15

as assessed by the Tribunal is on the higher side.
40.

At this stage, I note decision of this court in MAC.

APP. No. 228/2006, Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Vijay Kumar
Mittal decided on 11.05.2007. In said case, an injured aged 2324 years sustained grievous injuries in a road accident which
occurred on 13.6.2001 resulting of his right leg below knee.
Injured was working as a scrap dealer at the time of the
accident. Functional disability suffered by the injured was
assessed at 60%.
41.

Noting the afore-noted decision, functional disability

suffered by the injured in the instant case is assessed at 60%.
42.

Therefore, loss of earning capacity suffered by the

injured comes to Rs.5,41,080/-. (Rs.4,175 X 12 X 18 X 60%)
43.

Tribunal has awarded compensation in sum of

Rs.6,76,350/- under the head 'loss of earning capacity'. Thus,
compensation under the said head is reduced by a sum of
Rs.1,35,270/-.
44.

Appeal is accordingly allowed to the extent that

compensation as awarded by the Tribunal is reduced by a sum
of Rs.1,35,270/-.
45.

No costs.
