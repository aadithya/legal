2.

Arguments stood concluded on 3.5.2007. Today, Mr.

Naresh Thanai, Advocate has made a mention and has submitted
that this Petition is not connected with the said Batch matter of
which W.P.(C) 2835/2000 is a lead case.
The prayers in this Petition read as follows
(I)
Certiorari to quash the notification dated,
28.5.1995 under Section 4 and 17 and other
subsequent acquisition proceedings under the
Land Acquisition Act in respect of the land and
structures of the petitioners situated in the
revenue estate of village Shahbad Daulatpur,
Delhi, over the khasra nos. 51/8, 12, 13/1, 18, 19,
23, 53/14, 17 and 9.
(II) Directing the respondents to withdraw from
the acquisition proceedings of the said land and
structures of the petitioners by issuing a
notification under Section 48(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 as amended up to date.
(III) Restraining the respondents from taking
forcible possession of the aforesaid land and
houses belonging to the Petitioners in respect of
village Shahbad Daulatpur, Delhi.
(IV) Issue any other appropriate writ, order or
directions as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and
proper in the circumstances of the case thereby
directing the Respondents to regularise the
structures of the Petitioners.

Mr.Thanai presses prayer No.(II) before us.

Prayer

No.(I) seeks the quashing of Notification dated 28.5.1995 under
Section 4 read with Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act in
respect of the Acquisition of land situated in the Revenue Estate
of Shahbad Daulatpur. In Smt. Rakhi Rughwani's case a prayer
pertaining to denotification of the land under Section 48 of the
Land Acquisition Act has not been made.
4.

It appears to us that arguments on prayer No.(I)

would be on lines similar to those in Rakhi Rughwani's case. On
a perusal of the Order dated 17.3.1997 it appears that only the
prayer pertaining to denotification had been pressed. This is also
what Mr.Thanai submits before us today.
5.

On 17.4.2001 statement had been recorded that

symbolic possession has been taken by the Respondents.

On

4.1.2002 proceedings had been adjourned in order to enable
learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Petitioners, to examine
the question of maintainability of the Writ Petition in so far as the
prayers for issuance of a writ seeking denotification under
Section 48 of the Land Acquisition Act was concerned.

On

10.8.2005 Mr.Thanai had appeared on behalf of the Petitioner,
and it was recorded that Writ Petition

Nos. 2835/2000 and

393/2006 shall be treated as lead case.

6.

On several occasions we have had the opportunity to

consider the appropriateness of issuing Writ Petitions in the
context of Section 48 of the Land Acquisition Act in

W.P.(C)

3795/2007 titled Dalpat Singh -vs- Lt.Governor decided on
18.5.2007, W.P.(C) 17538-42/2006 titled Dharamvir Singh -vs-

Lt.Governor, decided on 20.3.2007 and W.P.(C) 2972/2007 titled
Satya Narain Prakash Punj -vs- Union of India pronounced
on 25.4.2007, we have held, after going into the matter in detail,
that writs or directions under Article 226 of the Constitution
should not be passed so far as they relate to Section 48 of the
Land Acquisition Act.

We may note that Notification dated

6.9.1996 has been issued in respect of the impugned Notification
under Section 4 and 17 of the Act dated 28.4.1995. Entertaining
any further relief in this regard would tantamount to a second
salvo or relooking into the matter which already stands
concluded.
7.

The Writ Petition is without merit and is dismissed.
