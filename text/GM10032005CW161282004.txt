The petitioners have arrayed the Delhi

Metro Rail

Corporation as respondent no. 1 and the Government of NCT of

W.P.(C) 16128-29/2004

page 2 of 12

Delhi as the respondent no. 2 in the writ petition. The petition has
been filed on the averments that the petitioners are the co-owners
of the land/property bearing Khasra no. 830/756/419 situated at
Bagachhi Peer Ji, Adil Shahi Garden Land, Sabzi Mandi
admeasuring approximately 1 Bighas and 13 Biswas i.e. 1380 sq.
meters. It is submitted that the petitioners were informed by their
watchman on 12th December, 2000 that officials of the respondent
no. 1 had taken forcible possession of their property and started
dumping material on the same. Despite repeated oral and written
requests dated 14th December, 2000, 15th January, 2003, 5th
February, 2003, 18th March, 2004 and 8th August, 2003, the
respondents have failed to comply with the demand made therein
to remove the trespass and to pay the damages as afore stated. The
petitioners submit that the respondents sent reply dated 31st
January, 2003 and 8th August, 2003 to the petitioners which are
totally contrary to the real facts. It is contended that the statement
made by respondent no. 1 that the land has already been
requisitioned by it for acquisition is totally contrary to the position
at site and that the respondents have taken illegal possession of
the property of the petitioners.
3.

So far as title is concerned, the petitioners have placed

W.P.(C) 16128-29/2004

page 3 of 12

on record photocopies of the Jamabandi of the land in question
since the year 1960-1967 and also the site plan prepared by the
Revenue Authority.

The petitioners have placed reliance on a

possession letter issued by the Government of India, Ministry of
Rehabilitation which is dated 22nd April, 1960 whereby possession
of the land is stated to have been handed over by it to the
predecessor in interest of the petitioners, namely Smt. Ananta
Devi who purchased the property vide an auction conducted by the
authorities.

The mutation was also effected in favour of the

petitioners who are the successors in interest of Smt. Ananta Devi
after her death and mutation of this land was duly effected in the
revenue records, some of which dated 30th May, 2003 and 22nd
May, 2001 have been placed before this court.
The respondents having failed to act in accordance with
law, according to the petitioner, it had no option but to file the
present writ petition seeking the prayers afterstated.
4.

The respondents have appeared in answer to the notice

to show cause in this petition and filed an affidavit in response.
The respondent no. 1 has stated that the land in question is
required for construction of the Pratap Nagar station for the metro
rail. However, the metro rail have not acquired any land in Delhi
W.P.(C) 16128-29/2004

page 4 of 12

by itself. It is submitted that the acquiring authority on its behalf
is the Government of NCT of Delhi which acquires the land and
transfers the same to the Metro Rail Corporation.

Despite a

requisition for allotment of the land comprising Khasra no.
830/756/419 for construction of the station, the same has not
been allotted to it till date. According to the respondent no. 1, the
Land Acquisition Collector(North) vide a letter dated 10th August,
2004 addressed to the Deputy Secretary(LA) had stated that the
land in question belonged to the Central Government and
possession thereof was with the East Punjab Railways. It was
further pointed out by the Land Acquisition Collector that the
revenue officials had surveyed the land and observed that the land
was

lying

vacant

and

encroached

by

temporary

shopkeepers/hawkers. In view of the stated ownership being that
of the Government authorities, notification for acquisition of the
land under the Land Acquisition Act, 1994 could not be issued.
The respondent no. 1 is stated to have requested the Chief
Engineer, Northern Railway vide a letter dated 16th September,
2004 requesting for allotment of the land to the Metro Rail
Corporation since it had been informed that the land belong to the
Railway Authorities. The respondent no. 1 has clearly stated in its
W.P.(C) 16128-29/2004

page 5 of 12

affidavit that the land was not being allotted to it and that it is still
at the stage of getting allotment of the land. The respondents have
disputed any liability to pay compensation or damages to the
petitioners stating that the writ petition was without any cause of
action.
5.

I have been taken through the documents on record and

have given my considered thought to the submissions made by
both sides.
6.

The position which emanates is that the party stated to

be in illegal dispossession of the property, disputes the same and
has stated on affidavit that it has taken steps for allotment of the
land in question to it in accordance with law. It appears that the
Government authorities are disputing the title of the petitioner
also inasmuch as the Land Acquisition Collector(North) vide a
letter dated 10th August, 2004 has informed the Deputy
Secretary(LA) of the Government of NCT of Delhi as follows :“ OFFICE OF THE LAND ACQUISITION

Sub:-

Acquisition of private land for
Pratap Nagar station of MRTS
Phase-I.

Sir,
With reference to your letter
No.F.7(41)/2003/L&B/LA/MRTS(N)/24101
dated 27.1.2004, on the subject cited above,
it is to apprise that as per revenue record,
the Khasra No. 830/756/419 (1-13) required
for construction of Pratap Nagar Station,
belongs to Central Govt. and under the
possession of East Punjab Railways, the
land was surveyed by revenue officials of
the Distt. As per survey report the land is
lying vacant and encroached by temporary
shopkeepers/hawkers. A copy of survey is
enclosed.
Thus in view of the above
circumstances, the draft Notification under
Section 4,6 & 17 of the L.A.Act 1984 cannot
be issued.
Yours faithfully,
Sd/(AZIMUL HAQUE)
LAC (NORTH)”
Therefore, according to the acquiring authorities, the
land in question belongs to the Central Government and is under
the possession of the East Punjab Railways. The Collector has
further stated that it has effected a survey and that the land is lying
vacant and encroached by temporary shopkeepers/hawkers.
W.P.(C) 16128-29/2004

7.

In these circumstances, the respondent no. 1 has stated

that it has made a request for allotment of the land to the Chief
Engineer(MRTF) Northern Railway, Baroda House, New Delhi
vide a letter dated 16th September, 2004 which reads as hereunder
:“Sir,
Land measuring 1 bigha and 13
biswas at Bagichi Peer Ji Basgh Aadil Shah,
Subzi Mandi is required for Pratap Nagar
station on Shahdara - Rithala Section of Delhi
MRTS Phase-I.
Land Acquisition Collector, North,
vide
his
letter
No.
PA/LAC(North)/2004/2677 dated 10.8.04
(copy enclosed) has informed that the land in
Khasra No. 830/756/419 (1-13) belongs to
Central Government and under the possession
of East Punjab Railways as per the revenue
record. The land belonging to Erstwhile, East
Punjab Railway is with the Northern Railway.
It is therefore, requested that the
said land may be allotted for Delhi MRTS
project. xxxx ”
The respondent no. 1 has also placed on record its note
sheets dated 11th January, 2005 in support of its contention that it
is following up with the Northern Railway and making every
endeavour to get allotment of the land.
8.

The respondent no. 1 is disputing the case of the

petitioners on the plea that the writ petition is without any cause of
W.P.(C) 16128-29/2004

page 8 of 12

action and is liable to be dismissed. It has clearly stated that it
proceeds in accordance with law and consequently had sought
acquisition of the land by the land acquiring authority. When it
was informed by the acquiring authority that the land could not be
acquired as it was owned by the Railway Authorities, the
respondent no. 1 is pursuing the matter with the Railway
Authorities for allotment of the land to it.
9.

In view of the aforestated position, it is to be noted that

while the petitioner is placing reliance on record of revenue entries
to establish its title, there are no documents of title in the nature of
sale deeds or allotment by the Government on record.

The

admitted position even on behalf of the petitioner is that the land
was owned by the Government. The revenue entries have been
placed on record to show mutation in the name of Smt. Ananta
Devi.
10.

In the light of these conflicting claims and statements,

the position is that even the title of the petitioner is not admitted
by the respondents. This question cannot be looked into by this
court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India. The revenue entries which have been placed
on record cannot establish title. In this behalf reference may be
W.P.(C) 16128-29/2004

page 9 of 12

made to pronounce of the Supreme Court in JT 1989 (4) SC 115
entitled Smt. Chandrakantaben wife of Jayantilal Bapalal Modi vs.
Vadilal Bapalal Modi & Ors.; 1996(6) Scale 333 entitled

Smt.

Sawarni vs Inder Kaur & Ors. and the judgment of this court in 54
(1994) DLT 484 entitled Rajinder Kakkar & Ors vs Delhi
Development Authority & Anr.
11.

In addition thereto, while the petitioners have claimed

possession, there is not an iota of material on record to support
this contention.

Even the revenue record relied upon by the

petitioners does not state that the petitioners are in possession of
the property. The photographs filed by the petitioners do not in
any way bear out either the location of the land or occupation of
the DMC. It is not possible to identify the land from the material
on record. Additionally even the Will of Mrs. Ananta Devi dated
16th June, 1982 relied upon by the petitioners in support of their
title does not state anything with regard to the Testator being in
possession of the land in question. The revenue record in favour
of the petitioners merely shows mutation of some land in their
favour.
12.

Even assuming in favour of the petitioner that Smt.

Ananta Devi was the real owner of the land who was put in
W.P.(C) 16128-29/2004

page 10 of 12

possession of the land on 22nd April, 1960 and that the petitioners
derive title from her, there is nothing on record to show that the
petitioners were ever in possession of the land to entitle them to
their claim of damages against the respondents even if they had
been dispossessed. However in view of my findings with regard to
the possession based on the statements of the respondents relating
to their survey it is not possible to hold so. On the other hand, the
respondents have stated that the writ petition is without any cause
of action. The stand of the respondent no. 1 is clearly that it
proceeds in accordance with law and that the land has not been
allotted to it. It has denied its liability to pay damages of any kind
to the petitioner. The respondent no. 1 has placed on record a
letter of the Land Acquisition Collector which has pointed out that
either the land is lying vacant or is encroached by private shop
keepers etc. Even assuming that the petitioner was the land owner,
it is to be seen as to whether it can resort to the present petition
either for getting encroachment on the land in question removed
or for making gains by way of damages in respect of the property.
13.

In the light of the material placed on record, I have no

hesitation in holding that the respondent no. 1 is not in possession
of the property which is the subject matter of this petition. As such
W.P.(C) 16128-29/2004

page 11 of 12

it cannot be fastened with a liability for paying damages as have
been claimed in the writ petition.
For these reasons, the petitioners cannot be granted the
prayers made in the writ petition.
The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
