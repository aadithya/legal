These two cases are references made to this Court by the Income Tax

Appellate Tribunal (‘Tribunal’) Delhi Bench “E”, New Delhi under Section
256 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1961 (‘Act’). The questions referred for two
Assessment Years are more or less similar. Relevant to the Assessment Year
1976-77, the following questions of law have been referred for our opinion
ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 1 of 13

in ITA No. 2601/Del/1979:
1.
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that 5,06,076
shares being bonus shares of M/s. Mohan Meakin Breweries
Ltd ('MMBL'). Received by the assessee did not represent
funds of the trust invested in the said concern for purposes of
section 13(4) of the Act?
2.
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the
prohibited category of persons mentioned in Section 13(3) did
not have substantial interest in MMBL in which the funds of
the assessee were invested and, therefore, the provisions of
section 13(2)(h) were not applicable?
3.
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the trust was
entitled to exemption as stipulated under Sections 11 and 12 of
the Act?
2.

Relevant to the Assessment Year 1977-78, the following questions of

law have been referred for our opinion in ITA No. 2305/Del/1982:
1.
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that 8,86,076
shares being bonus shares of MMBL received by the assessee
did not represent funds of the trust invested in the said concern
for purposes of sec. 13(4) of the Act?
2.
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the
prohibited category of persons mentioned in section 13(3) did
not have substantial interest in MMBL in which the funds of
the assessee were invested and, therefore, the provisions of
section 13(2)(h) were not applicable?”

3.

The Assessee Trust, Narinder Mohan Foundation, was founded by

late N.N.Mohan, Managing Director of MMBL and a Trust Deed dated
25.3.1964 was executed by him for the purpose and got registered. The
Trust property initially consisted of Rs. 10,000 transferred by N.N.Mohan

ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 2 of 13

from his account in Punjab National Bank. Subsequently the Trust received
substantial donations in cash and by way of shares and securities. The Trust
purchased 1,08,082 shares of MMBL.

In addition the trust received a

donation of 5,11,261 shares and 5,06,076 bonus shares of MMBL.

4.

In its income tax return filed for the Assessment Year 1975-76 the

Assessee Trust, inter alia, disclosed that the income from dividend was in
the sum of Rs.6,75,251. During scrutiny by the Income Tax Officer
(hereafter ‘ITO’) a question arose whether in terms of Section 13(1)(h) of
the Act the income of the trust had remained invested in any concern in
which any person referred to under Section 13(3) has a substantial interest.
After considering the replies of the Assessee Trust, the ITO found that the
11,25,418 shares held by the Assessee Trust in MMBL, including the bonus
shares and shares received by way of donation, were more than 5% of the
total share holding of MMBL and therefore the benefit of Section 13 (4) of
the Act was not available. As regards the pattern of the share holding in
MMBL, the following shares held by a certain category of persons came for
scrutiny:
Shares Held by
No. of Shares
i)
Six HUFs
7,30,849
ii)
Five Trusts settled by members of the
Mohan family for benefit of unborn persons and
Future spouses
3,00,000
iii) a) Bakshi Sampuran Singh
64,485
b) Balbir Singh
29,915
c) Ranbir Singh
29,915
d) Kulbir Singh
29,215
1,53,530

ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 3 of 13

5.

The Revenue contended that if the above shares were added to the

shares held in MMBL by the Assessee Trust then the holding of the
‘prohibited’ category of persons in terms of Section 13 (2) (h) read with
Section 13 (3) would exceed 20% of the total paid up share holding of
MMBL. This would make the income ineligible for exemption in terms of
Sections 11 and 12 of the Act. This view was accepted by the AO.

6.

The appeal filed by the Assessee Trust was allowed by the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) ['CIT(A)']. It was held by the CIT
(A) that the bonus shares and shares received by way of donation had to be
excluded for computing the percentage of shareholding of the Assessee trust
in MMBL. Consequently the CIT (A) held that the Assessee Trust was
entitled to the benefit of Section 13 (4) of the Act. As regards the shares
held by the ‘prohibited category’ of persons and close relatives, the CIT (A)
accepted the contention of the Assessee Trust that this did not exceed 20%
of the total shareholding in MMBL and that therefore the Assessee trust was
entitled to exemption in terms of Sections 11 and 12 of the Act.

7.

In the further appeal by the Revenue, the Tribunal concurred with the

CIT (A) that for the purposes of Section 13 (4), the bonus shares and shares
received by way of donation had to be excluded. It also concurred with the
CIT (A) that for the purposes of Section 13(2)(h) the 7,30,849 shares held
by the six HUFs and the 3,00,000 shares held by the five trusts had to be
excluded. Therefore the total number of shares held by the persons
answering the description of those listed in Section 13 (3) was 15,80,477
ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 4 of 13

which was about 18.5% of the total shares in MMBL. The Tribunal
concluded that the prohibited categories of persons mentioned in Section
13(3) did not have a substantial interest in MMBL (in which the funds of
the Assessee Trust were invested) and therefore the provisions of Section
13(2)(h) were not applicable. As regards Assessment Year 1977-78, the
Tribunal followed its order for the Assessment Year 1976-77 and dismissed
the appeal of the Revenue.
8.

As regards question (1) in the reference for both the Assessment

Years 1976-77 and 1977-78, it is not in dispute that in view of the decisions
of this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v.

Sir Shri Ram

Foundation (2001) 250 ITR 55 and Commissioner of Income-Tax v. Sir
Sobha Singh Public Charitable Trust (2001) 250 ITR 475, wherein it has
been held that the bonus shares received by a trust cannot be said to be
funds invested by the trust for the purposes of Section 13(4) of the Act, the
question requires to be answered in the affirmative, that is, against the
Revenue and in favour of the Assessee.

9.

The second and third questions referred for the Assessment Year

1976-77 and the second question referred for Assessment Year 1977-78 are
similar with only the actual figures of the number of shares and the amount
of dividend being different. Both sets of questions require an examination
whether the prohibited category of persons mentioned in Section 13(3) of
the Act do not have substantial interest in MMBL in which the funds of the
Assessee were invested. If the prohibited category of persons did have a
substantial interest in MMBL, then the provision of Section 13(2)(h) would
ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 5 of 13

stand attracted. The relevant provisions of the Act read as under:
“13. (1) Nothing contained in section 11 or section 12 shall operate
so as to exclude from the total income of the previous year of the
person in receipt thereof(a) to (bb) xxxxxxxx
(c) in the case of a trust for charitable or religious purposes or a
charitable or religious institution, any income thereof(i)
if such trust or institution has been created or
established after the commencement of this Act and
under the terms of the trust or the rules governing the
institution, any part of such income enures, or
(ii) xxxxx
directly or indirectly for the benefit of any person referred to in subsection (3)
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of clause
(c) and clause(d) of sub-section (1), the income or the property of the
trust or institution or any part of such income or property shall, for
the purposes of that clause, be deemed to have been used or applied
for the benefit of a person referred to in sub-section (3),(a) to (g) xxxxxxx
(h) if any funds of the trust or institution are, or continue to
remain, invested for any period during the previous year (not
being a period before the 1st day of January, 1971), in any
concern in which any person referred to in sub-section (3) has a
substantial interest.”
(3) The person referred to in clause (c) of sub-section (1) and subsection (2) are the following, namely:(a) the author of the trust or the founder of the institution;
(b) any person who has made a substantial contribution to
the trust or institution, that is to say, any person whose total
contribution up to the end of the relevant previous year exceeds
fifty thousand rupees;
(c) where such author, founder or person is a Hindu
undivided family, a member of the family;
(cc) any trustee of the trust or manager (by whatever name
called) of the institution;
(d) any relative of any such author, founder, person, member,
trustee or manager as aforesaid;
(e) any concern in which any of the persons referred to in
clauses (a), (b), (c ) [(cc)] and (d) has a substantial interest.
(4) to (7) xxxxxx
Explanation 1.- For the purposes of sections 11,12,12A and this
section, “trust” includes any other legal obligation and for the
ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 6 of 13

purposes of this section “relative”, in relation to an individual, means(i)
spouse of the individual;
(ii) brother or sister of the individual;
(iii) brother or sister of the spouse of the individual;
(iv) any lineal ascendant or descendant of the individual;
(v) any lineal ascendant or descendant of the spouse of the
individual;
(vi) spouse of a person referred to in sub-clause (ii), subclause (iii), sub-clause (iv) or sub-clause(v);
(vii) any lineal descendant of a brother or sister of either the
individual or of the spouse of the individual.
Explanation 2. xxxxxx
Explanation 3.- For the purposes of this section, a person shall be
deemed to have a substantial interest in a concern,(i)
in a case where the concern is a company, if its shares
(not being shares entitled to a fixed rate of dividend whether
with or without a further right to participate in profits) carrying
not less than twenty per cent of the voting power are, at any
time during the previous year, owned beneficially by such
person or partly by such person and partly be one or more of
the other persons referred to in sub-section (3);
(ii) in the case of any other concern, if such person is
entitled, or such person and one or more of the other persons
referred to in sub-section (3) are entitled in the aggregate, at
any time during the previous year, to not less than twenty per
cent of the profits of such concern.”
10.

The scheme of the above provisions of the Act relevant for the

present purposes is that the income of a Trust is generally exempt from
taxation when such Trust is for charitable or religious purposes. Section 12
specifies the types of income that would be deemed to be the income
derived from the property held by the Trust wholly for charitable and
religious purposes. Section 13 sets out the conditions under which income
earned by the Trust would not qualify for exemption under Sections 11 or
12. If the income of the Trust during the previous year is applied directly or
indirectly for the benefit of a person referred to in sub-section (3) then the
ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 7 of 13

income would not be so exempt. For this purpose Section 13(2) sets out the
kinds of income which would be deemed to have been used or applied for
the benefit of a person referred to in sub-section (3).

Under Section

13(2)(h) one such deemed income would be an investment by the Trust in
any concern in which the person referred to in sub-section (3) has a
substantial interest. Explanation 3 is a deeming provision as regards
substantial interest. Explanation 3 (ii) states that a person shall be deemed to
have substantial interest if such person and one or more persons referred to
in sub-section (3) of Section 13 are “entitled in the aggregate” “to not less
than 20% of the profits of such concern” which in this case is MMBL. In
other words, a shareholding in excess of twenty percent of the paid-up share
capital would in terms of Explanation 3 connote substantial interest.

11.

As far as the Assessee Trust is concerned if the dividend earned by it

in the shares of MMBL in which it has invested its funds is to be brought to
tax in terms of Section 13(2)(h) it would have to be shown that persons
referred to in sub-section (3) have a substantial interest in MMBL. The
categories of persons mentioned in this provision include the author of a
Trust or the founder of the institution, any person whose contribution to the
Trust exceeds Rs.50,000, where the author is a Hindu Undivided Family
('HUF') a member of the family, any trustee of the Trust or manager. Any
relative of any such author, founder person or even trustee are all mentioned
in said Section 3. Explanation 1 further describes a relative to include
spouse in the individual, brother or sister of the spouse of the individual,
any lineal ascendant or descendant of the individual or any spouse of a
ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 8 of 13

person referred to in sub-clause (ii), sub-clause (iii) etc.

12.

The share holding pattern of MMBL therefore becomes relevant. It is

not in dispute that for the Assessment Year 1976-77, six HUFs having the
members of the Mohan Family as kartas held 7,30,849 shares in MMBL.
The CIT (A) and the Tribunal have concurrently found that they do not fall
within the prohibited categories of persons referred to in Section 13(3) read
with Explanation 1. After considering the submissions of learned counsel
for the parties, we are not inclined to take a different view. It is not possible
to read Section 13 (3) as bringing within the fold of prohibited persons an
HUF, which is a taxable entity by itself. The device of piercing the veil of
the legal entity of a HUF in order to ascertain the person in actual control of
its functioning is unknown to this branch of tax law. The submission of Ms.
Bansal that the persons who are actually in charge of the HUFs are
themselves mentioned individually in Section 13(3), and therefore it is
implied that the HUF itself is one of the prohibited categories cannot be
accepted. Taxation statutes admit of a strict interpretation. It is not possible
to write into the categories mentioned in Section 13 (3) a category that is
not mentioned there. For this reason we are not inclined to interfere with the
conclusion reached by the Tribunal that the shares of the HUF cannot be
considered for the purposes of determining whether the persons mentioned
in Section 13(3) have a substantial interest in MMBL.

13.

The next lot of shares which require to be considered is 3 lakhs shares

held by the various trusts. Ms. Prem Lata Bansal places reliance upon the
ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 9 of 13

judgment of this Court in Commissioner of Income-Tax v. Brigadier Kapil
Mohan (2001) 252 ITR 830 to contend that even if the beneficiaries of the
Trusts which hold shares in MMBL were unknown, it cannot be said that
the Trusts did not hold the shares beneficially for any person. On the other
hand Mr. Monga, learned counsel for the Assessee submits that the
categories mentioned under Section 13(3) does not include a Trust in itself
and, therefore, it would be stretching the language of the Section
impermissibly to bring the share holding of the Trust within the mischief of
Section 13(2)(h) read with Section 13(3) of the Act.

14.

The Tribunal itself has observed in para 18 of its order dated 21 st

October, 1989 that a Trust cannot be a legal owner of the shares in terms of
Section 153 of the Companies Act, 1956. It is the trustees who are the legal
owners who hold the shares beneficially for certain persons specified in the
trust deeds. The Tribunal has also observed that copies of three trust deeds
have been furnished to it.

Two of them were dated 22nd

May, 1973

executed by Mrs. Comilla Mohan for the benefit of the first son of Shri
Hemant Mohan. The second deed dated 22nd May, 1973 was executed by
Mr. Rakesh Mohan for the benefit of the first son of Shri Pankaj Mohan. A
third deed dated 18th July, 1973 was executed by Mrs. Comilla Mohan for
the benefit of the first son of Shri Vinay Mohan.

The Tribunal also

proceeded on the footing that the trustees of the five Trusts were persons
covered under Section 13(3) of the Act. Therefore the only question that
remained was whether these trustees were holding the shares for the
beneficiaries.

The Tribunal then proceeded to answer this question by

ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 10 of 13

holding that the beneficiaries were known and therefore it cannot be said
that the trustees were holding the shares beneficially for them.

15.

At the time the Tribunal gave its judgment it did not have the benefit

of the judgment of this Court dated 16th May, 2001 in the case of Brigadier
Kapil Mohan. There too a contention had been raised that the beneficiary
of the Trust was unknown and, therefore, it cannot be said that the shares
would be held beneficially by the trustees. It was argued that since the
children for whose benefit the shares were held had not yet been born, the
provision of Section 13(3) would not get attracted. This Court negatived
this argument and pointed out as under:
“In order to constitute a valid trust the author of the trust
must indicate with reasonable certainty:(a) the intention
on his part to create a trust, (b) the purpose of the trust,
(c) the beneficiaries, (d) the trust property, and (e)
transfer of property to the trust. According to learned
counsel for the Revenue except condition (c) all other
conditions are present here. We find that it is not a case
where the beneficiary was unknown or indefinite. In
fact it was clearly stipulated that the beneficiary was the
first son of Shri Rakesh Mohan.”
“A transfer cannot be made directly to an unborn
person, for the definition of transfer in section 5 is
limited to living persons. Such transfer can only be
made by the machinery of trusts. Possibly, to express
this distinction, the expression “for the benefit of “ has
been used, since the trustees, being the transferees, hold
the property for the benefit of the unborn person.
In the case at hand the entire interest in the property
goes to the benefit of the child to be born to Shri
Rakesh Mohan. As the facts go to show, in fact a child
was born in August, 1977. What would have happened
if Rakesh Mohan did not get a male child is also spelt
out in the trust deed.”

ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 11 of 13

16.

In light of the above observation it is clear that even if the property of

the Trust was being held for the benefit of yet to be born persons it cannot
be said that the requirement of Section 13(2)(h) read with Section 13(3) is
not met. It cannot therefore be said that the shares held by the trustees were
not for the benefit of anyone. It is clear from the trust deeds themselves that
the beneficiary could be an unborn child but that does not by itself take it
outside the purview of Section 13(2)(h) read with Section 13(3) of the Act.

17.

Accordingly it is held that the three lakhs shares held by the trust

were held by prohibited categories of persons in terms of Section 13(3) of
the Act.

18.

The last tranche is of 1,53,530 shares held by Shri Bakshi Sampuran

Singh and his three sons. There is no dispute that Shri Bakshi Sampuran
Singh, being the husband of the sister of Smt. Ram Rakhi, spouse of Shri
Narender Mohan, falls within the meaning of 'relative' under Section 13.
The only reason why the Tribunal appears to have accepted the contention
of the Assessee that this share holding should not be included for the
purposes of calculating the 20% share holding is that the spouse of the
Assessee was no longer in that capacity after his death in 1969. In our view
there can be no manner of doubt that the Tribunal has erred in coming to
this finding. It is beyond comprehension how Smt. Ram Rakhi Mohan
would cease to remain in the legal capacity of a spouse after the death of her
husband.

ITR No. 271 of 1984 and ITR No.381 of 1984

page 12 of 13

19.

Therefore, after adding back the two pieces of share holdings, that is,

3,00,000 shares held by the Trusts and the 1,53,530 shares held by Shri
Bakshi Sampuran Singh and his three sons, the total shareholding of
prohibited person in MBBL would be greater than 20% of the total paid up
capital. The factual position therefore, is that the prohibited categories of
persons hold a substantial interest in MBBL and, therefore, the dividend
income of the Assessee Trusts cannot be exempted from tax in terms of
Sections 11 & 12 of the Act.

20.

Relevant to assessment year 1976-77, questions No. (2) and (3) are

answered in the negative, that is, in favour of the Revenue and against the
Assessee.

21.

In regard to assessment year 1977-78 the position is more or less

similar except that the actual figures of the share holding are different.
Therefore, question (i) is answered in the affirmative, that is, in favour of
the Assessee and against the Revenue. Question No.2 is answered in the
negative, that is, in favour of the Revenue and against the Assessee.

22.

The two references are therefore disposed of accordingly with no

order as to costs.
