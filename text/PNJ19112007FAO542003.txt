PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Ramwati's estate was litigated upon. Shri Krishan as

also Kanta Devi filed 2 petitions seeking probate of respective will
relied upon and as stated to be executed by Ramwati. Petition
seeking probate filed by Shri Krishan was registered as PC19/2002.

Petition seeking probate filed by Kanta Devi was

registered as PC-432/2001. Both petitions were filed 3 years after
the date of death of Ramwati. A preliminary issue pertaining to
the maintainability of the probate petitions with reference to
the law of limitation was framed in both petitions. Both petitions
were disposed of vide common order dated 26.10.2002 holding
page 1 of 4

that both petitions were barred by limitation. In taking the view,
decision of this Court reported as 2000 RLR 137 Pamela Man
Mohan Singh vs. State was relied upon.
2.

It is not in dispute that the said view has since been

dissented from by a larger Bench of this Court holding that
pertaining to grant of probates of a will since a will is a indenture
of entrustment till trust is discharged, remedies can always be
invoked pertaining to grant of probate.
3.

In that view of the matter, impugned order dated

26.10.2002 cannot be sustained.
4.

But, a problem has arisen. Whereas Kanta Devi, the

petitioner of Probate Case No.432/2001 has challenged the order
dated 26.10.2002, Shri Krishan, the petitioner of Probate Case
No.19/2002 has not challenged the said order.
5.

If petition is allowed, which it has to be, petition filed

by the petitioner would be restored.

What happens to the claim

of ShriKrishan?
6.

He certainly would have a right to oppose grant of

probate as prayed by Kanta Devi and for said reason he can rely
upon the will which he propounded in Probate Case No.19/2002.
7.

Does he have any other right? In my opinion, yes. The

right flows to him from the decision of the Division Bench of this
Court reported as 91 (2001) DLT 702 Suraj Bhan & Anr.

vs.

page 2 of 4

Rajinder Pal Singh Lamba & Ors. The Division Bench construed
the ambit of Rule 33 of Order 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure
and held that a narrow meaning to said rule would empower the
Appellate Court, to do complete justice, to pass necessary orders
in respect of all issues although the respondent may not have
filed an appeal or an objection to the decree impugned.
8.

I note that with effect from 1.2.1977, Rule 33 of Order

41 of the Code of Civil Procedure has been amended and includes
the power to vary or alter a decree or an order where the decree
relates to cross suits or where 2 or more decrees are passed in
one suit, though cross appeal may not have been filed. Meaning
thereby, as in the instant case, where on a common question of
law, 2 cross probate petitions stand disposed of holding that both
were barred by limitation, if it is held that the petitions were not
barred by limitation, notwithstanding that Shri Krishan has not
filed an appeal pertaining to dismissal of his probate petition, this
Court would be empowered to restore even probate petition
filed by Shri Krishan.
9.

The petition accordingly stands disposed of quashing

the impugned order dated 26.10.2002. Both probate petitions i.e.
PC No.19/02 filed by Shri Krishan and PC No.432/2002 filed by
Kanta Devi are restored. Both would be decided simultaneously.
10.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned counsel
page 3 of 4

for the parties.
11.

LCR be returned.
