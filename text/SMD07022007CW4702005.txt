ORDER

: Dr. S. Muralidhar, J.(oral)

1.

This contempt petition has been filed by two Italian nationals

who were detained in Tihar Jail in Delhi on 10.2.2005 in a case under
Section 420 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). In the another case involving
these two petitioners a production warrant had been issued on
12.2.2005 by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ernakulam Kerala
requiring production of these two petitioners in that Court on
18.2.2005.

The said production warrant was issued in terms of

Section 267 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC). The
Chief

Metropolitan

Magistrate,

Delhi

declined

the

prayer

for

production of the petitioners in the Kerala Court on the ground that

CONT.CAS(C) 470/2005

1 of 9

they were required in the criminal cases in Delhi. Consequently the
petitioners were not produced in the Court in Kerala on the date
indicated in the production warrant.

2.

Pursuant to a circular dated 27.11.2003, issued by the Office of

the Director General (Prisons), Tihar, New Delhi in matters where a
production warrant sent from a court “Outside Delhi” is unable to be
executed, a message is required to be sent soon thereafter to that
court to ascertain the next date of production. Accordingly, a wireless
message was sent by the Tihar jail officials on 17.2.2005 to the
learned Chief Judicial Magistrate Ernakulam, seeking intimation
about the next date of production.

Although the next date was

intimated as 1.3.2005, but even on this date, the petitioners could not
be produced since the prayer for producing the petitioners had been
declined by the CMM, Delhi.

3.

Thereafter, another production warrant was issued by the CJM,

Ernakulam requiring the petitioners to be produced in that Court on
18.3.2005. This time, the permission was granted by the CMM Delhi
on 15.3.2005, but due to paucity of time, the petitioners could not be
produced before the court of the CJM at Ernakulam. On 17.3.2005 a
wireless message was flashed to the CJM, Ernakulam, Kerala giving
the reason for non-production and sought intimation of the next date
of production.

4.

On 18.5.2005, the petitioners were released in Delhi in the

criminal case consequent upon the offences having been compounded.
However they were not released on the ground that they were
possibly required for production in Kerala.

At this stage, the

petitioners filed an application on 18.5.2005 itself in the Court of
CONT.CAS(C) 470/2005

2 of 9

CMM, Delhi for directions to the Superintendent to Tihar Jail to
release the petitioners “forthwith if they are not wanted in any other
case”. The learned CMM, Delhi called for a report on 19.5.2005. The
Superintendent Jail, Tihar filed a report in the Court of CMM
informing that a wireless message had been sent to the Court of the
CJM, Ernakulam on 19.5.2005 to ascertain the next date.

5.

On 21.5.2005, the learned CMM, Delhi passed the following

orders:
“ Present:-

APP for the State
Counsel for applicant

Report received from Supdt. Jail, Tihar.
Heard & Perused.
If the message in case FIR No. 931/2004 u/s 420/34
IPC, Police Station Ernakulam, Kerala has been sent
and if till today no response has been received from
Ernakulam and if two days expired from date of sending
by jail rec. the accused be released as per directions of
DIG (prisons) Delhi and file the compliance report on
27.5.2005. Copy of order be sent to Supdt. Jail Tihar
for compliance.”

6.

It appears that although a wireless message had been sent on

19.5.2005 by the Jail Authorities in Delhi, no response had been
received by 21.5.2005 and this led to a further message being sent on
21.5.2005. The petitioners were subsequently sent to Kerala where
they were ultimately released upon the settlement of the criminal case
pending there. It is stated that the two petitioners are no longer in
India.

7.

Mr.Vikas Pahwa, learned counsel for the petitioners urges that

the liberty of persons brought within the ambit of criminal justice

CONT.CAS(C) 470/2005

3 of 9

system in this country is precious. He states that on the facts of the
present case, detention of the petitioners in Delhi beyond 21.5.2005,
i.e., on the expiry of 2 days after the wireless message was sent on
19.5.2005 was contrary to the order of the CMM dated 21.5.2005 and
the circular issued by the jail authorities on 27.11.2003.

He

accordingly states that nothwithstanding the fact that the petitioners
have been released subsequently, a case of contempt of the order
dated 21.5.2005 passed by the CMM, Delhi is made out and
consequential orders should be passed by this Court.

8.

Ms. Zubeda Begum, learned counsel for the respondents places

reliance on the following averments in paras 12 and 13 of the counter
affidavit:
“12. That in accordance with the above

However, as no

wireless was sent on 21.5.2005 asking for
confirmation whether or not the petitioners

21.5.2005.

dated 21.5.2005 is enclosed herewith and
marked as ANNEXURE – R/8.

was also a gazetted holiday (Budh Purnima),

and

received

confirmation therefrom that the petitioners
were required in case FIR No. 931/2004. As
such, the petitioners were handed over to the
III Battalion, DAP, Delhi on 23.5.2005 for
production at Ernakulam, Kerala.”
Her specific plea here is that the wireless message sent on 19.5.2005
did not contain a statement that the petitioners/prisoners would be
released within two days if there was no response. Therefore, a
further message was sent on 21.5.2005 incorporating such statement.
She submits that the confirmation having been obtained within two
days thereafter on 23.5.2005, no case for contempt is made out.

9.

There can be no gainsaying that no person's liberty in this

country can be curtailed or restrained except according to the
procedure established by the law. The Cr.PC incorporates many of the
basic inviolable

safeguards concerning the protection of life and

liberty of all persons in our country. The manner of issuing of
warrants for production of persons detained in prisons before courts,
including outside the court in whose jurisdiction the person required
to be produced is and the manner of their execution has been set out
under Section 267 CrPC. It is well settled that the provisions of the
Cr.PC admit of a strict construction and any deviation from the
procedure stipulated therein is normally viewed seriously by the
courts. Our

courts have also emphasised the desideratum of

interpreting 'liberty-restricting' provisions in the backdrop of the
Constitutional command of Article 21. The lucid exposition of the law
by Supreme Court in Francis Coralie Mullin vs. Administrator,

Union Territory of Delhi (1981) 1 SCC 608 continues to be the
guiding lode star in such matters. That decision reminds us that when
it comes to issues of life and liberty, the Constitution brooks of no

CONT.CAS(C) 470/2005

unequal treatment of non-citizens.
10.

The circular dated 27.11.2003 issued by the prison authorities

in Delhi acknowledges the mandatory nature of Section 267 CrPC.
The circular stipulates that where the earlier production warrant
issued by a Court located outside Delhi is unable to be executed for
any reasons, a message should be sent to the concerned Court
“immediately” for soliciting information about the next date of
production.

However, the word “immediately” should not be

construed as permitting an 'open ended' outer limit. It ought to be
reasonably interpreted as requiring an outer time limit within which
such information should be sought.

11.

As far as the present case is concerned the jail authorities in

Delhi flashed a wireless message on 17.3.2005 to the concerned Court
in Kerala soliciting information about the next date of production. So
far, there can be no cause for complaint.

However it is the events

that transpired thereafter that has led the petitioners to file the
present contempt petition.

The message flashed on 19.5.2005 was

almost two months after the earlier message of 17.3.2005 and this
again was sent only after the conclusion of criminal case against the
petitioner on 18.5.2005 in Delhi. The question really is whether the
respondents were justified in detaining the petitioners beyond a
period of two days after 19.5.2005 and should they take advantage of
their own lapse in not incorporating the sentence in the wireless
message of 19.5.2005 that the petitioners would be released within
two days if no reply was received. It was this that led to the sending of
a further message on 21.5.2005 the confirmation for which was
received only on 23.5.2005.

12.

No doubt, the gap between the earlier message of 17.3.2005

CONT.CAS(C) 470/2005

6 of 9

and the subsequent message of 19.5.2005 was more than two months.
Still, in terms of the circular dated 27.11.2003, the message of
19.5.2005 had to contain the line that the petitioners “would be
released if no response is received”. It did not. However, in view of
the subsequent events in the present case, this lapse does not appear
to be so serious as to warrant any conclusion of contempt having
being committed by the respondents of the order dated 21.5.2005
passed by the CMM, Delhi.

13.

It transpires in the present case although there had been a

settlement in the criminal case against the petitioners in Kerala and a
petition for quashing was filed consequent thereto in the High Court
of Kerala, it was not immediately acted upon. An order dated
19.5.2005

passed

by

the

High

Court

of

Kerala

in

Criminal

Miscellaneous Case No. 1411/2005 and 1386/2005 reveals that
although the fact of the settlement was noted, the case had been kept
back till 31.5.2005. Therefore, the requirement of the petitioners in
Kerala in the criminal case pending there was still alive on the date of
on which they were actually sent from Delhi to Kerala. The
information ascertained by the jail authorities here telephonically
from the Office of the Superintendent of Police in Kerala on the
morning of 23.5.2005 to the effect that the petitioners would be
required to be produced before the CJM, Ernakulam was, therefore,
correct. In that view of the matter it cannot be said that the sending
of a further message on 21.5.2005 seeking information from the Court
in Kerala has prejudiced the case of the petitioners or has delayed
their release. Had the petitioners not been required in Kerala as of
21.5.2005, the consequences of the lapse of the prison authorities in
Delhi may have been viewed seriously. However, on the facts of the
present case the Court is not persuaded to view the action of the
CONT.CAS(C) 470/2005

7 of 9

respondents as being in wilful disobedience

of the order dated

21.5.2005 of the learned CMM, Delhi. Their conduct cannot be said to
be contumacious.

14.

Nevertheless, this Court would like to emphasize that there

should be no undue delay in soliciting information from another court
whose production warrants have not been unable to be executed for
any reason. The gap between the two messages sent in terms of the
circular dated 27.11.2003 should not exceed ten days. Secondly, the
message should be sent to the concerned Court and the information as
to the next date of production should also be obtained only from the
said Court itself and not through the Police of such other State. The
purport of Section 267 Cr.P.C. is that such information should be
sought from the concerned Court itself. If these two requirements are
incorporated into the circular dated 27.11.2003 for mandatory
compliance, any prejudice that may be caused to a prisoner detained
in Delhi whose production is ordered by the Court outside Delhi, can
be avoided.

15.

The counsel for the petitioners states that there are instances of

other prisoners detained needlessly in the jails in Delhi for lack of
information about the next date of their production in Courts outside
Delhi. However the scope of the present proceedings do not permit
examination of this aspect. The Court is sanguine that if the
modifications to the Circular dated 27.11.2003 in light of what has
been suggested here are made this grievance can also be taken care
of by the prison authorities. They have been reminded time and again
by our Courts that in their role as guardians of our penal correctional
institutions, they have a constitutional obligation to also guard against
impermissible infractions of the liberty of those entrusted to their
CONT.CAS(C) 470/2005

custody.

16.

With these observations, the contempt petition is closed and

disposed of as such.
Copy of the order be given dasti to the parties. A copy also be sent by
the Registry to the Director General of Prisions, Thiar, Delhi, within
three days.
