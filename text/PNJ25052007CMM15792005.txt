PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

By and under the present petition, petitioner has

challenged the order dated 04.06.05.
2.

Relevant facts necessary to be noted to appreciate

the issue raised in the petition are that the petitioner owned a
truck bearing No. HR-29B-1244. It was desirous of insuring the
said truck and for said purpose approached respondent no.1
who is in the business of insurance.

On 7.4.2000, a cheque

Page 1 of 11

was issued by the petitioner to respondent no.1 towards
premium payable for obtaining a policy of insurance for the
truck.

Receiving the premium tendered by and under a

cheque, a cover note bearing No.063406 was issued by the
respondent no.1 pertaining to truck bearing no. HR-29B-1244.
The period for which the truck was to remain insured was
mentioned as 7.4.2000 to 6.4.2001.
3.

For unexplainable reasons, the insurance company

kept the cheque paid towards premium with it and only on
24.4.2000 presented the said cheque for encashment. The
banker of the petitioner on whom the cheque was drawn
returned the cheque recording that the cheque was being
returned because of insufficiency of funds in the account of the
petitioner.
4.

Unfortunately, the return memo issued by the bank

was based on a misconception because admittedly there was
sufficient money in the account of the petitioner for its banker
to honour the cheque.

Without any external intervention,

realizing its mistake on its own, on 26.4.2000 the banker of the
petitioner forwarded a banker's cheque in respect of the
premium amount under cover of a letter admitting its mistake

Page 2 of 11

that it had returned by mistake the cheque issued by the
petitioner.
5.

Notwithstanding the fact that respondent no.1 not

only received the aforenoted banker's cheque sent to it by the
petitioner's banker towards premium paid and also encashed
the same, on 5.5.2000, respondent no.1 sent a letter to the
petitioner cancelling the cover note no.063406. A fresh cover
note was issued by the insurance company w.e.f. 26.4.2000 to
25.4.2001.
6.

In the interregnum, on 13.4.2000 the truck was

involved in an accident resulting in the death of Smt. Nanda
Devi.

Respondents 3 and 4 filed a claim petition seeking

compensation on the ground that they were the dependents of
Smt Nanda Devi.
7.

The respondent no.1 predicated a defence that on

the date of the accident, it was not liable to indemnify the
insured for the reason original policy note dated 7.4.2000 was
cancelled and was followed by a cover note issued on 5.5.2000
covering the period 26.4.2000 to 25.4.2001.
8.

By and under the award dated 3.9.2004, the learned

Tribunal returned a finding as under:-

Page 3 of 11

9.

“However, as by way of positive evidence the
insurance company proved that the earlier
insurance policy was duly cancelled and the
insured has not come forward to contest the
same.
I consider that insurance company
should be given liberty to recover the awarded
amount from the insured. Hence, the insurance
company is given a liberty to recover the
awarded amount from the insured as per law.”
The petitioner did not challenge the award.

Execution was sought by the insurance company after
satisfying the award in favour of respondents 3 and 4.

It

sought to recover the awarded amount from the petitioner.
The petitioner objected to the execution, inter alia alleging that
the vehicle was duly insured as on date of the accident
because the cover note issued when premium was paid by
cheque was not cancelled when the accident took place and
that the very fact of cancellation was contrary to law. It was
further pleaded that the award did not vest any recovery rights
in the insurance company and that the award only granted a
liberty to file a substantive proceeding to establish recovery
rights and thereafter, on success, recover the amount paid to
the claimants.
10.

Vide impugned order dated 4.6.2005, the learned

Tribunal dismissed the objection filed by the petitioner holding
that the award gave recovery rights to the insurance company
Page 4 of 11

and having attained finality, had to be executed. It was further
held that acting as an executing court, the Tribunal could not
go behind the award.
11.

Before dealing with the contentions urged at the bar

by learned counsel for the parties it would be useful to note an
event during the period the claim petition filed by respondents
3 and 4 was being adjudicated upon by the Tribunal.
12.

Being a case of death at a road accident, interim

compensation under Section 140 of the MV Act 1988 was
payable to the claimants.

Vide order dated 08.04.2003,

interim application for interim compensation was allowed in
favour of the claimants i.e. respondents no. 3 and 4 and
compensation in sum of Rs.50,000/- was awarded in their
favour. At that stage, respondent no.1 raised an objection that
it was not liable to pay the interim compensation as the vehicle
was not insured on the date of the accident i.e. 13.4.2000.
Rejecting the said stand and noting the facts hereinabove
noted by me pertaining to the cheque towards premium paid
by the petitioner, cover note issued by the respondent no.1 for
the period 7.4.2000 to 6.4.2001, the return of the cheque by
the banker of the petitioner, the cancellation of the cover note

Page 5 of 11

in May 2000 and issuance of a fresh cover note covering the
period 26.4.2000 to 25.4.2001, the learned Tribunal recorded a
finding as under:“From the facts on record it is clear that on
13.4.2000, the day of accident the cover note
no.063406 was in existence and it is not clear
on record till date nor the R-3 has asserted in
pleadings or placed on record any document
showing as to when R-3 came to know of the
dishonour of the cheque of the premium
amount.

On the other hand, the case of the petitioner is
well covered within the 4 corners of the
judgment cited above of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court.
The observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Rula & Ors.,
2000 ACJ 630 in para 6 of the judgment are as
under:“Now, a contract of insurance, like any
other contract, is concluded by offer and
acceptance. Normally, a liability under
the contract of insurance would arise
only on payment of premium if such
payment was made or condition
precedent to the insurance policy taking
effect. But such a condition which is
intended for the benefit of the insurer
can be waived by the insurer.”
These observations clearly suggest that the
insurer can waive or vary the terms and
conditions of the contract of insurance policy
which are beneficial to it. Judging in the light of
above observation, if we read the intimation
Page 6 of 11

letter 5.5.2000 of this case whereinafter
cancellation of the existing insurance cover
note, further suggestion of the R-3 to the R-2
that the R-2 can afresh take the insurance
policy by depositing the amount of the
dishonoured cheque of the premium go to
establish that what was revived by the policy
no.040603/31/00/135/00 w.e.f 26.4.2000 to
25.4.2001 was nothing but a continuation of
the previous cover note because the parties,
the subject matter, the risk covered remains
the same except the date of the risk. Thus, the
R-3 failed to establish its case to the effect that
the R-3 is not liable to make the payment of the
compensation

Nothing said in this order above shall effect or
prejudice the merits of the case.”
13.

Vide order dated 04.06.05 i.e. impugned order,

while dismissing the application filed by the petitioner
opposing the execution, the Tribunal functioning as the
executing court has observed as under:“Aforegoing conclusion drawn by the Tribunal
that Insurance Company by way of positive
evidence had proved that the earlier insurance
policy was duly cancelled and the insured had
not come forward to contest the same, leaves
no scope to hear to the contrary by way of
application in hand, filed by the responent
no.2-JD no.2. Assuming, the Tribunal erred in
reaching the said conclusion, the appropriate
remedy there-against cannot lie by way of
application in hand in the execution filed. Ld.
Page 7 of 11

Counsel for the applicant-JD no.2 on his part
strenuously contested that the liberty
reserved by the Tribunal for the Insurance
Company to recover the Award amount from
the insured as per law, in the given facts and
circumstances, was a liberty to file a suit only,
as according to him, the questions as regards
the valid cancellation of the cover note
effectively could only be adjudicated in a
regular suit. Contention raised by the Ld.
Counsel for the applicant, I consider, is equally
merit less for the reason that the Tribunal by
itself has gone into the dispute between the
insurer-respondent no.3 and the ownerrespondent no.2/JD no.2 and given its findings
on that aspect. Having done so, the Tribunal
has even proceeded to issue recovery
certificate. Needless to say, the insurerrespondent no.3 paid the amount under the
directions of the Tribunal and in view of the
conclusions aforegoing drawn by the Tribunal,
it is most equitable to recover by way of the
execution proceedings, which are, of course
are, in accordance with the law laid down.
Reliance 2004 (I) scale 180 National Insurance
Company Vs. Swaran Singh and Ors. , I (2004)
ACC 524 (Supreme Court), OIC Vs. Nanjappan.
In view of the aforegoing, I do not find any
merit in the application and the same is
hereby dismissed.”
14.

The maxim “actus curiae neminem gravabit” means

that an act of court shall prejudice no man. No acts of court
should harm a litigant and it is the bounden duty of a court to
see that if a person is harmed by a mistake of court, he should
be restored to the position he would have occupied but for that
Page 8 of 11

mistake.
15.

A perusal of the language used by the Tribunal in its

award dated 3.9.2004 shows that the Tribunal has used
inappropriate expression to convey the final direction.

The

language used by the Tribunal is that the insurance company is
given liberty to recover the awarded amount from the insured
as per law.
16.

Normally, granting liberty to a person connotes that

the court is permitting the person to take recourse to some
other substantive remedy. As held by the Supreme Court in
the decision reported as National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Swaran
Singh & Ors. 2004 (3) SCC 297, where complex questions of
facts arise for consideration, the Tribunal can relegate the
adjudication of the inter se dispute between the insurer and
the insured at a regular civil trial. Thus, the petitioner was not
unjustified in presuming that the award has not adjudicated on
merits qua the issue of recovery rights and as and when and if
the insurance company filed a suit, it could defend itself.
17.

Though

award

dated

3.9.2004

has

not

been

challenged in the petition with reference to a specific prayer,
but I note that the petitioner has prayed for any other

Page 9 of 11

appropriate relief to be granted to it.
18.

Since all necessary facts and evidence are before

me, it would be futile to relegate the parties to a civil trial for
the reason only issue which needs to be decided is whether on
the admitted facts aforenoted, insurance company would be
entitled to recovery rights.
19.

It is not in dispute that before the original cover

note was cancelled, premium towards the policy had already
been received by the insurance company.

It is also not in

dispute that on 13.4.2000 when the truck met with the
accident, the original cover note had not been cancelled. It is
not in dispute that the petitioner is not at fault and the
inadvertent mistake by its banker of returning the cheque
drawn on it towards the premium payable was rectified by the
bank the very next day it issued the return memo. It is not a
case where the insurance company had to notify the petitioner
that the cheque towards premium was dishonoured and as a
consequence the cover note issued was being cancelled.
Under Rule 142 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules 1989, a
cover note remains valid for 60 days unless revoke earlier.
Under Section 147 of the MV Act 1988 it is the duty of the

Page 10 of 11

insurance company to issue a certificate of insurance and a
policy of insurance after premium for issuance of the policy is
received by it.

Thus, the respondent no.1 could not have

cancelled the original cover note.

The period of insurance

covered by the original cover note i.e. the period 7.4.2000 to
6.4.2001 covered the truck and its owner against all third party
claims.
20.

The petition is accordingly allowed.

It is declared

that the appellant is not liable to recompense respondent no.1
any amount in respect of the accident in question.

It is

declared that the respondent no.1 is not entitled to any
recovery rights against the petitioner. The execution sought by
respondent no.1 against the petitioner is dismissed.
21.

No costs.
