CS(OS) No. 141/2005

Sarai, Tehsil - Hauz Khas, New Delhi-110062. The suit came up
for hearing on 4th February, 2005. Despite repeated summons
and notices issued to the defendant, he could be served only by the
substituted mode by publication of a proclamation in the
newspaper as well as by affixation of the summons at his last
known address and on the notice board of this court. Publication
of the summons was effected in the daily newspaper Tribune in its
Delhi and Chandigarh edition in the issue dated 27th September,
2005. As the defendant failed to put in appearance, the defendant
was directed to be proceeded ex-parte by orders passed on 14th
December, 2005. On the same date, the plaintiff was directed to
file its ex-parte evidence on affidavit as well as any additional
documents. The plaintiff has filed its own affidavit and the
affidavit of Shri Mohd. Shafeeq as PW2 in support of its case.
2.

Alongwith the suit, the plaintiff had also filed an application

under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 being IA NO. 856/2005. By orders
passed on 14th of December, 2005, the defendant was restrained
from creating any third party right/or parting with possession of

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 2 of 17

the property in question.

This order was modified by orders

passed on 20th January, 2006 in IA NO. 677/2006 whereby the
defendant was directed to maintain status quo with regard to
possession of the suit property.
3.

The matter has been thereafter posted before this court for

hearing of arguments. Written submissions have also been filed in
support of the plaintiff's contentions in the plaint.
4.

The contentions of the plaintiff in the suit remain undisputed

and unchallenged and the facts duly established on record deserve
to be noticed for the purposes of adjudication of the present case.
The unrebutted facts established by cogent and clear evidence
show that by an agreement to sell dated 16th July, 2004, the
defendant agreed to sell his property being a vacant plot
measuring 4400 sq. yeards bearing no. K-224 in Khasra No. 660
in the Revenue Estate of Village Neb Sarai, Tehsil - Hauz Khas,
New Delhi-110062 to the plaintiff for a total sale consideration of
Rs.35,52,000/- Even before entering into this agreement to sell
which has been marked Exhibit P-1, one Ms. Aparna Berry

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 3 of 17

representing the defendant, had taken earnest money of Rs.1 lakh
on his behalf for which she had executed a receipt dated 12th July,
2004 (Exhibit P-4).

Receipt of this payment was duly

acknowledged by the defendant in the documents executed by him
subsequently.

Apart from this payment, the plaintiff has

established that he has paid a sum of Rs.3 lakh in cash on 16th
July, 2004 and an amount of Rs.2 lakh by a demand draft no.
972262 dated 15th July, 2004 drawn on the Canara Bank, Hauz
Khas, New Delhi. The defendant had acknowledged receipt of the
total sum of Rupees six lakhs by a duly stamped receipt dated 16th
July, 2004 executed by him and witnessed by Ms. Aparna Berry
and Shri Suraj. This receipt has been proved on record as Exhibit
P-3. The agreement dated 16th July, 2004 executed between the
parties towards sale and purchase of the suit property also
witnesses receipt of the sum of rupees six lakhs by the defendant
from the plaintiff.

The plaintiff has placed reliance on the

representations made by Ms. Aparna Berry on behalf of the
defendant to the effect that she was holding the original

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 4 of 17

documents of the suit property in trust and confirming that she
would not part with the original documents to anybody other than
the plaintiff . Ms. Aparana Berry has apparently addressed a letter
dated 16th July, 2004 to the plaintiff in these terms. The plaintiff
has also proved the receipt dated 12th July, 2004 whereby she has
acknowledged receipt of the payment of the earnest money from
the plaintiff.
5.

So far as title of the defendant is concerned, the plaintiff

places reliance on a title deed search conducted by Shri Narender
Vashist, Advocate on his behalf. The search report dated 28th
July, 2004 given by this counsel has been proved on record as
Exhibit P-7 wherefrom the plaintiff has verified the defendant's
rights in the suit property.
6.

The plaintiff has deposed that thereafter the defendant

started delaying execution of the sale deed in terms of the
agreement dated 16th July, 2004. With a lot of persuasion, the
defendant finally agreed to and executed a registered will dated
7th September , 2004 (Exhibit P-19) in favour of the plaintiff; a

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 5 of 17

special power of attorney dated 17th September, 2004 (Exhibit P18) in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the suit property. By the
bequests made in this Will, the defendant bequeathed the suit
property in favour of the plaintiff. The submission of the plaintiff
is that this was merely a confirmation of the rights of the plaintiff
in the suit property inasmuch as properties in the area is being
transacted with and rights transfered by execution of documents
as agreement to sell, irrevocable power of attorney, Will etc. The
defendant also executed a special power of attorney on the same
day appointing the plaintiff as attorney of the defendant in respect
of the suit property.
7.

The plaintiff has also proved before this court the affidavit

dated 7th September, 2004 deposed by the defendant wherein he
confirmed that he had sold the suit property to the plaintiff and
acknowledged receipt of the consideration in respect of the land.
The defendant has also confirmed execution of the agreement to
sell and the other documents in respect of the suit property in
favour of the plaintiff and undertaken that he would not revoke

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 6 of 17

these documents under any circumstance.

The defendant has

unequivocally deposed that he had delivered the actual physical
vacant possession of the land to the plaintiff.
The defendant has also acknowledged handing over the
vacant and physical possession of the suit property to the plaintiff
by "handing over and taking over" of possession note dated 7th
September, 2004 which has been proved on record as Exhibit P22.

It is noteworthy that this transaction took place in the

presence of Shri Mohd. Shafeeq and Shri Suraj Bhan who have
also signed as witness thereon on this possession letter dated 7th
September, 2004 (Exhibit P-22) on record.
8.

The plaintiff has established payment of a sum of

Rs.26,70,000/- to the defendant pursuant to the agreement dated
16th July, 2004 and 7th September, 2004. It is stated that the
defendant paid by cheque no. 972262 dated 15th July, 2004 drawn
on Canara Bank for the sum of Rs.2 lakhs; cheque no. 194504
dated 26th July, 2004/7th September, 2004 drawn on Canara
Bank for the sum of Rs.10,70,000/-; cash dated 16th July, 2002 of

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 7 of 17

Rs. 4 lakhs; cash through self cheque no. 194506 dated 7th
September, 2004/26th July, 2004 drawn on the Canara Bank
through a cheque of Rs.10 lakhs. These payments were also duly
acknowledged by the defendant in a receipt dated 7th September,
2004 which has been exhibited as Exhibit P-21.
I find that in Exhibit P-21, the parties had agreed that the
balance sum of Rs.8,82,000/- would be received by the defendant
at the time of registration of the documents .
9.

The plaintiff has contended that after being put in possession

of the suit property, he has carried out extensive land scapping as
the sole owner in possession and has incurred expenses to the tune
of Rs.10 lakhs to repair boundary walls etc.

The plaintiff has

submitted to be in interrupted and exclusive possession of the suit
property eversince he received possession of the property from the
defendant. The plaintiff has effected large scale improvements on
the suit property and has placed photographs before this court on
record as Exhibit P-31 to P-45 to establish his possession of the
suit property.

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

10.

The present suit has been necessitated inasmuch as the

defendant was inaccessible after October, 2004. All efforts of the
plaintiff to contact the defendant or his representative Ms. Aparna
Berry did not bear fruit. In these circumstance, the plaintiff got
issued a notice dated 20th November, 2004 calling upon the
defendant to present himself at the Tehsil Mehrauli in the office
of the Sub-Registrar for execution of the registered documents for
transfer of title in respect of the suit property. This notice also
failed to evoke any positive response. The plaintiff has submitted
that he received a notice under Section 160 of the Criminal
Procedure Code from the Police Station Mehrauli in a case bearing
FIR No. 724/2004 wherein he was required to appear as a witness.
This criminal complaint has been registered by the police
purportedly on a complaint against the defendant Shri Ajay
Mathur.

It appears that the criminal complaint had been

registered by the police against the defendant who was attempting
to sell the suit property to one Shri Rajpal Singh who had made the
allegation that Shri Ajay Mathur had duped him. The plaintiff thus

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 9 of 17

became aware that the defendant's intentions were malafide and
he was attempting to disown the terms of the agreement to sell
dated 16th July, 2004 in respect of the suit property.
11.

The plaintiff has contended that he has throughout been

ready, willing and able to perform his part of the contract and has
effected substantial payment in terms of the agreement to the
defendant.
12.

The case of the plaintiff is corroborated on all scores by the

testimony of Shri Mohd. Shafeeq who has been examined as PW 2
and whose affidavit has been filed. Shri Shafeeq has not only
established the execution of the agreement dated 16th July, 2004
but also has established the payments made by the plaintiff to the
defendant and to Ms. Aparna Berry as noticed above. PW 2 is also
a witness on all material documents executed by the defendant
evidence transfer of his rights and interest in the suit property in
favour of the plaintiff. This witness has also deposed that the
plaintiff was put in possession of the suit property on 7th
September, 2004 which he continues to occupy.

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 10 of 17

This witness

tendered his evidence by affidavit before this court on 26th March,
2007 and

identified his signatures as witness on the documents

which have been exhibited on record and marked as Exhibit P1,
P4, P18, P19, P 21 and P22.
13.

It is well settled that the relief for specific performance has to

be premised on equitable principles. Vide discretion is conferred
on the court to grant or decline a decree for specific performance.
The Specific Relief Act, 1963 mandates that it would not be
necessary for a court to decree specific performance merely
because it is lawful to do so.

Considerations of equity, good

conscience and fairness form the very foundation for grant of the
relief of specific performance and the discretion is to be exercised
in consonance with the well settled principles.
Thus having regard to the spirit intendment and purpose of
the statutory provisions of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 where a
contract is proved to have been executed in accordance with law;
where the plaintiff has acted fairly and without any undue delay
and pursued his remedy without infringing any legal provision and

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 11 of 17

equity justifies exercise of discretion in favour of the plaintiff,
specific performance of the agreement is certainly merited. It is
well settled that equity must give relief where equity so demands.
Equitas nuquam liti an cillatur ubi remedium potest dare

is a

clear illustration which has been duly accepted by the Indian
courts. (Ref : 2006 (90) DRJ 276 entitled M.K. Sehgal v.
Mohindar Kaur)
This maxim applies to consideration of a prayer for specific
performance of an agreement.
14.

In AIR 1988 SC 2031 Atma Ram Mittal vs. Ishwar

Singh Punia, the court held that the time taken by the court in
deciding suits or appeals would not be permitted to work to the
disadvantage of the party to the lis as it is well settled that acts of
courts shall cause prejudice to none is well settled.
15.

For the same reason, if the court arrives at the conclusion

that the plaintiff is ready, willing and able to perform his part of
the contract and no delay is attributable to him, it has been held
that specific performance would be granted.

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 12 of 17

In this behalf

reference can appropriately be made to a

Division Bench

judgment of this court reported in 2006 (90) DRJ 276 M.K.
Sehgal v. Mohinder Kaur and Single Judge pronouncements
in 128 (2006) DLT 96 Raj Kumar Sharma vs. Pushpa
Jaggi & Ors. and 114 (2004) DLT 345 Jai Gopal Goyal &
Anr. vs. Bishan Dayal Goyal. In M.K. Sehgal vs. Mohinder
Kaur (supra), I find that this court has also held that making of an
alternative prayer by the plaintiff in a suit cannot be construed as
a waiver or abandonment of the main relief of specific
performance of the agreement.
16.

I find that the principles on which discretion is to be

exercised under Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 have
been succinctly laid down by the Apex Court in its pronouncement
reported at JT (2001) 4 SC 43 Her Highness Maharani
Shantidevi P Gayakwad vs Savji Bhai Haribhai Patel &
Ors. wherein the court has stated thus :"The grant of decree for specific performance is
a matter of discretion under Section 20 of the Specific
Relief Act, 1963. The Court is not bound to grant
such relief merely because it is lawful to do so but the
CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 13 of 17

discretion is not required to be exercised arbitrarily.
It is to be exercised on sound and settled judicial
principles. One of the grounds on which the Court
may decline to decree specific performance is where it
would be inequitable to enforce specific performance.
The present is clearly such a case. It would be wholly
inequitable to enforce specific performance for (i)
residential houses for weaker sections of the society
cannot be constructed in view of the existing Master
Plan and thus, no benefit can be given to the said
Section of the society, (ii) In any case, it is extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to continuously supervise
and monitor the construction and thereafter
allotment of such houses, (iii) the decree is likely to
result in uncalled for bonanza to the plaintiff, (iv)
patent illegality of order dated 20th June, 1998, (v)
absence of law or any authority to determine excess
vacant land after construction of 4356 dwelling units,
and (vi) agreement does not contemplate the transfer
of nearly 600 acres of land in favour of the plaintiff
for construction of 4356 units for which land required
is about 65 acres. The object of the Act was to
prevent concentration of urban land in hands of few
and also to prevent speculation and profiteering
therein. The object of Section 21 is to benefit weaker
sections of the Society and not the owners. If none of
these objects can be achieved, which is the factual
position, it would be inequitable to still maintain
decree for specific performance."
17.

Applying the equitable principles laid down by the Apex

Court and this court to the present case and as per the statutory
mandate, I find that it is an undisputed fact that the parties had

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 14 of 17

entered into an agreement to sell dated 16th July, 2004; that the
plaintiff has made substantial payments thereunder and has been
even placed in possession of the suit property. The plaintiff has
acted bonafide and fairly and there is no challenge that the
plaintiff has not been ready, willing and able to perform all
obligations under this agreement. All statutory requirements and
equitable considerations for grant of specific performance in the
facts of the instant case stand satisfied which clearly justify
exercise of judicial discretion in favour of the plaintiff.
Accordingly, I hereby pass a decree for specific performance
of the agreement to sell dated 16th July, 2004 in favour of the
plaintiff against the defendant subject to the following conditions
:(i)

The plaintiff shall pay the balance sale consideration of

Rs.8,82,000/- by a cheque to the defendants within two weeks
from today.
(ii)

On receipt of this payment, the defendants shall execute the

registered documents of transfer of title in the suit property in

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 15 of 17

favour of the plaintiff in accordance with law.
(iii) In case of non-acceptance the balance consideration by the
defendant, the plaintiff shall deposit the same in this court.
(iv)

In the event of default of the defendant, the plaintiff shall be

entitled to get the sale deed executed by an officer to be appointed
by an order of this court upon an application for this purpose to be
filed by the plaintiff after depositing the balance sale consideration
in this court.
I also hereby pass a decree of permanent prohibitory
injunction against the defendants restraining the defendants, his
agents, servants, nominees, assigns from selling, alienating or
creating any third party interest in the property bearing K-224 in
Khasra No. 660 in the Revenue Estate of Village Neb Sarai, Tehsil
- Hauz Khas, New Delhi-110062.
The defendants, his agents, servants, nominees, assigns are
hereby restrained by a decree of permanent prohibitory injunction
from disposing the plaintiff or in any manner interfering with his
quiet and vacant possession of the property bearing K-224 in

CS(OS) No. 141/2005

page 16 of 17

Khasra No. 660 in the Revenue Estate of Village Neb Sarai, Tehsil
- Hauz Khas, New Delhi-110062. .
So far as the alternative relief of damages is concerned, this
court has decreed the suit of the plaintiff for specific performance
and consequently this relief does not need to be considered.
The plaintiff will be entitled to costs of the present suit which
are quantified at Rs.75,000/GITA MITTAL
