MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
The Revenue is aggrieved by an order dated 22nd December,
2006 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench „A‟ in
ITA No. 2892/D/2004 relevant for the Assessment Year 1996-97.
2.

The assessment in respect of the Assessee was completed

under Section 144 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short the Act) on 31st
March, 1999.
3.

Feeling aggrieved by the assessment order, the Assessee

preferred an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)
[CIT (A)] who passed an order dated 12th May, 2000, the operative
portion of which is important and that reads as follows: “It was also the case of the ld. Counsel that the additions
were made without any basis and there was no history of
case which could justify such an assessment I have
considered this argument also. It is true that there is no
history of case in respect of the additions made in the
assessment order. At least nothing is mentioned in the
order in this respect. It is also felt that the Ld. AO could
have specifically granted one more opportunity to the
appellant to state his case in respect of the matters covered
in the questionnaire. This is so because the appellant
could have thought that the proceedings may be dropped
after hearing the preliminary objection. Though it is
mentioned in the note that the AR did not agree to file any
detail.
Yet the AO could have granted one more
opportunity, particularly when the matter had remained
pending up to 31.3.1999. It is also seen that the assessment

was taken up on 5.3.99, while the initial notice had been
issued on 27.11.97 and there was no follow up of the case
in the interregnum. In view of this, I am of the view that
the ld. AO should have granted one more opportunity to
the appellant on proposed additions. Therefore, it is held
that it will be the interest of the justice to restore the matter
to the file of the AO, so that one more opportunity may be
given to the appellant to file evidence and state his case in
respect of matters covered in show cause dated 5.3.99.
Thereafter, the Ld. AO may pass order u/s 144 taking the
explanation into account.
Therefore, this matter is
restored to the file the AO. Thus, ground no. 2 of the
appeal is treated as allowed.”
4.

When the matter was taken up by the Assessing Officer

pursuant to the above order, he issued a notice to the Assessee under
Section 143(2) of the Act on 24th February, 2003 for making a fresh
assessment.

According to the Assessee, the notice was barred by

limitation in view of the provisions of Section 153(2A) of the Act.
5.

Since the Assessee apparently did not cooperate with the

Assessing Officer, the assessment, as originally framed, was once again
made by the Assessing Officer.
6.

Against the assessment order, the Assessee preferred an

appeal before the CIT (A) who concluded that the provisions of Section
153(2A) of the Act were not applicable but the case was covered by
Section 153(3)(ii) of the Act and as such there was no time limit fixed

ITA No.729/2007

Page 3 of 7

for making the assessment.
7.

Feeling aggrieved by the order passed by the CIT (A), the

Assessee preferred an appeal before the Tribunal. The appeal was
allowed by the order under challenge and it was held by the Tribunal
that the provisions of Section 153(2A) of the Act were applicable and
not Section 153(3)(ii) of the Act.
8.

For facility of appreciating the controversy involved, Section

153(2A) of the Act and Section 153(3)(ii) of the Act are reproduced
below:
“153.

reassessments.

(2A)
Notwithstanding anything contained in subsections (1), (1A), (1B) and (2), in relation to the assessment
year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1971, and any
subsequent assessment year, an order of fresh assessment
in pursuance of an order under Section 250 or section 254
or section 263 or section 264, setting aside or cancelling an
assessment, may be made at any time before the expiry of
one year from the end of the financial year in which the
order under section 250 or section 254 is received by the
Chief Commissioner or Commissioner or, as the case may
be, the order under section 263 or section 264 is passed by
the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner:
Provided ……….

Provided further ……….
3.
The provisions of sub-sections (1), (1A), (1B) and
(2) shall not apply to the following classes of
reassessments, reassessments and recomputations which
may, subject to the provisions of sub-section (2A), be
completed at any time –
(i)

xxx
(ii)
where the assessment, reassessment or
recomputation is made on the assessee or any person in
consequence of or to give effect to any finding or direction
contained in an order under section 250, 254, 260, 262, 263,
or 264 or in an order of any court in a proceeding
otherwise than by way of appeal or reference under this
Act.”
9.

It was contended by learned counsel for the Revenue that

the order passed by the CIT (A) did not set aside the assessment order
and, therefore, the provisions of Section 153(2A) would not be
applicable. We are not at all in agreement with learned counsel for the
Revenue.
10.

The operative words in Section 153(2A) of the Act are “an

order ……………… setting aside or cancelling an assessment”. We
have reproduced the operative portion of the order passed by the CIT
(A) and although that portion does not specifically say that the order of
the Assessing Officer has been set aside or cancelled, but since ground

ITA No.729/2007

Page 5 of 7

No.2 of the appeal filed by the Assessee was allowed, by necessary
implication, the assessment order was set aside to that extent.
11.

The CIT (A) had made it clear in his order that the Assessing

Officer “should have granted one more opportunity to the Appellant
on proposed additions” and in view thereof, it was held that it would
be in the interest of justice to restore the matter to the file of the
Assessing Officer so that one more opportunity could be given to the
Assessee to file its evidence and state its case in respect of the show
cause notice issued to it. The CIT (A) also directed the Assessing
Officer to pass an order under Section 144 of the Act after taking the
explanation of the Assessee into account. This, in our opinion, clearly
means that the assessment order to the extent that it did not give an
opportunity to the Assessee to place its evidence on record was set
aside or cancelled by the CIT (A) although these specific words were
not used in the appellate order.
12.

This being the position, in our opinion, Section 153(2A) of

the Act is clearly applicable.
13.

In so far as the applicability of Section 153(3)(ii) of the Act is

concerned, that relates to giving effect to a finding or direction, inter
alia, by the CIT (A). What this means is that the Assessing Officer must

ITA No.729/2007

Page 6 of 7

comply with the finding or direction given by the appellate authority
without necessarily disturbing the assessment order. In so far as the
present case is concerned, that is not the position because the Assessing
Officer was directed by the CIT (A) to pass a fresh order under Section
144 of the Act meaning thereby that the assessment order to the extent
that it is covered by ground No.2 of the appeal filed by the Assessee
was set aside or cancelled.

There was no independent finding or

direction which the Assessing Officer was required to comply with on
the basis that the core of the assessment order has been sustained by
the CIT (A).
14.

Under the circumstances, we are of the view that no

substantial question of law arises for consideration.
15.

The appeal is dismissed.
