1.

This petition has been filed by the petitioner complaining

of wilful violation of the orders dated 12th September, 2003
passed in WP (C) No.6145/2001. It appears that the DDA had
allotted plot bearing no.211, Pocket A-1, Paschim Puri, New
Delhi to Smt. Asharfi Devi. Not only was the possession handed
over but the lease deed in respect of the subject land was
executed on 12th September, 1974. Prior to the demise of Smt.

Asharfi Devi on 26th July, 1983, she had executed a Will dated
24th June, 1975 bequeathing the subject property in favour of
her nephew who is the petitioner in the present case. On this
basis, the petitioner sought transfer of the lease and mutation
of the property in his name and thereafter its conversion to
freehold.
2.

So far as the mutation was concerned, upon the failure of

the DDA to effect the same, the petitioner had filed Civil Writ
Petition No.1545/1988. In this petition, on 21st January, 1992,
the respondent stated that the property stood mutated in the
name of the petitioner without payment of unearned increase.
The petitioner has thereafter raised construction and sought
conversion of the plot to freehold.
3.

The DDA thereafter insisted on payment of composition

fee for delayed construction.

This action of the DDA was

assailed by the DDA by way of second writ petition being WP
(C) No.6145/2001. This petition was decided by the court on
12th September, 2003 holding that the entire composition fee as
demanded by the respondent, was not liable to be paid. The
court had specified the period for which the composition fee
Cont.Cas.(C) No.170/2005

Page No.2

would be paid and consequently had quashed the demand
raised by the DDA raised by the letters dated 4th February, 2000
and 4th May, 2000. The court had issued a mandamus to the
respondents to issue a fresh demand on the petitioner within a
maximum period of four weeks from the date of passing of the
order. Inasmuch as the delay was attributed to the DDA, it was
directed that there would be no question of charging any
interest on the demand.

On the 12th September, 2003, the

court had further directed that on the petitioner depositing the
demanded amount and completing the necessary formalities,
its case for conversion from leasehold to freehold would be
processed and the conveyance deed executed in favour of the
petitioner not later than two months upon the petitioner
depositing the demand.
4.

Pursuant to the orders passed, the respondents raised a

demand by a letter dated 16th April, 2004 which amount was
deposited by the petitioner by a demand draft dated 13th
August, 2004.

The petitioner issued reminders dated 9th

October, 2004 and 23rd October, 2004 calling upon the
respondents to execute the conveyance deed within the period
Cont.Cas.(C) No.170/2005

Page No.3

of two months directed by this court.

Upon the respondents

failure to do so, the petitioner filed the present petition seeking
initiation of the proceedings under the Contempt of Courts Act
against the respondents. The respondent entered appearance
on advance notice on the very first date when a direction was
issued to them to file a reply setting out the steps taken for
compliance of the judgment dated 12th September, 2003.
5.

In the reply which was filed, it has been pointed out that

the petitioner was required to pay ground rent to the tune of
Rs.3,096/- and interest thereon of Rs.5,255/-. The respondents
had also claimed that the petitioner was liable to pay an
amount of Rs.2,133/- as processing charges. The petitioner has
disputed the demand of Rs.2,133/- pointing out that it had
deposited the ground rent as back as on 30th December, 1991.
In these circumstances, on the 12th January, 2006, it was
noticed that the statement made on behalf of the DDA was
cryptic and failed to indicate the date on which the ground rent
was payable or disclose the progressive interest so calculated
year to year.

In this background, costs of Rs.7,500/- were

imposed on the DDA which was directed to file a detailed
Cont.Cas.(C) No.170/2005

Page No.4

statement of account due and the interest.
6.

On the direction made by the court, the DDA filed a

calculation sheet dated 5th October, 2005 now disclosing that
the petitioner was owing an amount of Rs.2,991/- for the period
between 1st December, 1993 to 14th January, 1998. Credit has
been reflected only of the payment of Rs.678/- paid on 6th
October, 1982. On this amount, the DDA was claiming interest
at the rate of 10% per annum on the progressive computation
w.e.f. 7th December, 1978 to 6th October, 2005. The calculation
sheet filed by the DDA discloses a liability of Rs.6,101/-.
7.

The DDA has thereafter filed an affidavit dated 8th

February, 2007 acknowledging the payment of Rs.2,133/towards ground rent by the petitioner as back as on 30th

conveyance deed.

8.

Having regard to the manner and the period for which this

matter has lingered in this court, the petitioner is directed to
deposit this amount of Rs.2146/- to the respondent within
period of 10 days from today. A statement is made by learned
counsel for the petitioner that the duly stamped conveyance
deed stands submitted to the DDA as back as on 25th February,
2005.
9.

Ms. Monica Sharma, learned counsel for the DDA, has

pointed out that the DDA had issued a letter dated 28th
February, 2005 to the petitioner. It has been pointed out that
the stamping on the conveyance deed in terms of the directions
by the DDA and the calculation by the Collector of Stamps has
been effected on 28th February, 2005.

The petitioner has

submitted that he had deposited the amount of stamp duty as
indicated to him by the Collector of Stamps, in the treasury.
10. It is apparent that the document has not been executed or
registered in accordance with law till date.

It has also been

pointed out that since the deposit of the amount of stamp duty
payable in February, 2005, the State Government had effected
amendments to the stamp duty which was leviable on the
Cont.Cas.(C) No.170/2005

Page No.6

conveyance deed in favour of the petitioner in March, 2005 &
June, 2005, reducing the same substantially. The provisions of
the Stamp Duty Act envisage that the incidence of stamp duty
occurs at the time of execution of the conveyance deed.
Accordingly, for the reason that the conveyance deed has not
been executed so far, based on the pronouncement of this
court in 2003 III AD (Delhi) 407 Piyush Agarwal & Anr. Vs.
Government of NCT of Delhi & Ors., it is directed that the
petitioner shall be entitled to refund of the excess stamp duty,
if any, and appropriate steps in this behalf shall be taken by the
Collector of Stamps within a period of four weeks from the
receipt of this order. The petitioner is directed to approach the
Collector of Stamps with copy of this order.

The DDA shall

ensure that the conveyance deed in respect of the petitioner is
executed in favour of the petitioner within a period of eight
weeks from today.
11. This matter was dragged on and the petitioner was made
to run from pillar to post for almost two decades.

Despite the

specific time bound directions made on 12th September, 2003,
the DDA has further dragged the matter necessitating the filing
Cont.Cas.(C) No.170/2005

Page No.7

of the present petition. No due care has been exercised by the
officer even in taking appropriate and timely steps so far as this
petition was concerned despite issuance of notice in the
present proceedings. In this view of the matter, in my view, the
petitioner deserves to be compensated with costs which are
quantified at Rs.25,000/-.

Costs shall be paid by the DDA

within four weeks from today.
12. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
petitioner is concerned with execution of the conveyance deed
in his favour and subject to the respondent complying with the
directions made today, he would not press the prayer for taking
appropriate action under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1972.
Accordingly, the proceedings in this matter are closed.
13. In the event of the failure of the respondent to abide by
the directions made by the court, it shall be open to the
petitioner to seek revival of the present petition.
The costs shall be paid within a period of two weeks from
today.
