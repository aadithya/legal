1.

M/s Delhi Kanodia Oil Mills Ltd., the petitioner has challenged demand

of Rs.2,00,179.54 mentioned in letter dated 13/2/1995 towards supplementary
bill for load violation charges for April 1991 and May 1991 as well as
supplementary bill for LPF charges for the period April, 1994 till September,
1994. The petitioner has also made a prayer for refund of excess load
violation charges paid by them for the period after 30th September, 1991 till 8th
June, 1994.
2.

For adjudication of the petition brief facts may be noted. On 18th April,

1991 Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking carried out inspection in the property
of the petitioner located at More Sarai, Delhi-6. As per the inspection report

the petitioner had connected load of 178 KW, which was more than a
sanctioned load of 169.693 KW. After the said inspection the petitioner was
asked to pay load violation surcharge as well as low power factor surcharge.
The latter was subsequently withdrawn and we are not concerned with the
same.
3.

On 30th September, 1991 the petitioner wrote a letter requesting DESU

to re-inspect the property. They also enclosed a test report by competent
electrician for the connected load. This request was again repeated on
9/12/1991, 5/6/1992 and 18/1/1993. In spite of these letters, DESU did not
carry out inspection and thereupon the petitioner filed a writ petition in this
court being civil writ no.4576/1993. During the course of the said proceedings,
DESU on 9/12/1993 gave an undertaking that they shall re-inspect the
premises of the petitioner. The premises of the petitioner was again inspected
on 15/12/1993. As per correspondence and the counter affidavit filed by
DESU at the time of inspection the total connected load was found to be
164.72 KW.
4.

At this stage I may state that the counsel for respondent/distcom, who

has been impleaded as a party pursuant to disbundling, has pointed out that
as per details mentioned in the inspection report dated 15/12/1993 the total
connected load was 208 KW and not 164.72 KW. However, this fact is not
mentioned in any of the letters written by DESU or even in the counter

affidavit and therefore, I am inclined to presume that the facts stated in the
counter affidavit and letters written by DESU are correct. I may note here that
DESU in its letter dated 26/9/1994 has specifically admitted that total
connected load of 164.72 KW was found during re-inspection on 15/12/1993.
This has been repeatedly admitted in the counter affidavit also.

Counsel for

the respondent/Distcom states that they may be permitted to amend the
counter affidavit.

I am not inclined to allow the said request for reasons

indicated below and the final conclusion I have reached.
5.

After re-inspection of the premises DESU should have withdrawn load

violation charges as the connected load was found to be less than the
sanctioned load. The leaned counsel for the petitioner states that the
petitioner was made to pay load violation charges @ 30 % even after
inspection on 15the December, 1993 till 8th June, 1994. A rough calculation
was done in the court and it was stated that Rs. 1,60,000/- (approx.) will be
refundable to the petitioner.
6.

With regard to the supplementary charges claimed in letter dated

13/2/1995, I find that the petitioner is liable to pay Rs.74,479.54 on account of
load violation charges, in view of the inspection dated 3/5/1999 for the period
April to May 1991. Challenge on the ground of limitation, cannot be sustained
in view of the decision of this court in MCD Vs. H.D.Shourie reported in 1994
(1) AD (Delhi) 105. Thus the petitioner is liable to pay Rs.74,479.54 along

with the interest or late payment surcharge.
7.

DESU has also claimed low power factor charges on account of slow

meter/defective meter for the period April, 1994 till September, 1994 of
Rs.1,71,620. It is contention of the petitioner that this amount could not have
been raised without adjudication and decision by an electrical inspector. There
may be some merit in the contention raised by the petitioner in view of
H.D.Shaurieâ€™s case (Supra). However, it may not be appropriate to refer to the
entire dispute raised, to an electrical inspector after lapse of nearly 10 years. I
may also notice here though I have not accepted the contention of the
respondent/distcom on calculation of the total connected load as mentioned in
the report dated 15/12/1993, yet it cannot be denied that the entire
machinery/equipment found at that time has been specifically mentioned in
the inspection note along with the load factor. The petitioner has also enjoyed
stay of the impugned demand mentioned in letter dated 13/2/1995. Sending
the matter back for further examination and decision by the electrical inspector
at this stage is bound to result in further litigation. Balancing out equities and
with a view to bring the litigation to an end, it is held that the petitioner will not
be liable to pay demand dated 13/2/1995 in terms of the supplementary bill, in
view of the excess load violation charges paid by them even after inspection
held on 15th December, 1993 till 8th June, 1994. The amounts payable are set
off against each other. The result will be that the petitioner will not be entitled

to any refund and the amount refundable to the petitioner will be set off
against the demand of Rs.74,479.54 and also the second claim for defective
meter.
The writ petition is accordingly disposed of. No costs.
