This appeal arises out of an order dated 18.08.2005
passed by a learned Single Judge of this Court whereby IA No.
329/2001 filed under Order IX Rule 13 read with Section 151 of
the CPC has been dismissed. The said application, it appears
became necessary on account of the dismissal for nonprosecution of the objections filed by the appellant under
Sections 30/33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 to an arbitral award.
When this appeal came up for hearing before this Court on
29.05.2005, learned counsel for the parties agreed to the matter
being referred to the Mediation and Conciliation Centre in the
High Court to explore the possibilities of an amicable settlement
