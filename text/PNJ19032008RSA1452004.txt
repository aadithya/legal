PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

Till date no question of law has been framed in the

instant appeal. Having heard learned counsel for the parties I
am of the opinion that no question of law arises for
consideration in the instant appeal for the reason decisions
passed by the learned Trial Judge and the First Appellate Court
are based on appreciation of unimpeachable evidence, being
documentary evidence emanating from government record,
and no material circumstance in favour of appellant has been

ignored by the Courts below.
2.

Respondent, A.S.Khanna, filed a suit for possession

and damages against the appellant inter alia alleging that suit
property bearing Municipal No.XIV/2140-41 Gali Chullehewali,
Pan Mandi, Sadar Bazar, being an evacuee property, vested in
the custodian of evacuee properties and was put to auction.
He i.e. A.S.Khanna was the successful bidder.
accepted.

His bid was

He was declared to be the owner and vide sale

certificate dated 25.9.1968, Ex.P-1, was declared the owner of
the property.

He further stated that the plaintiff was in

possession of the property since 1947-48. He stated that as a
result of Ex.P-1 he acquired title by becoming the owner of the
property and that the defendant entered upon a portion of the
property in January 1967.
3.

In the written statement filed, the defendant took a

plea that the suit property i.e. the property which was alleged
to be in his unauthorized possession was actually a part of
property bearing Municipal No.XIV/2146 Gali Chullehewali, Pan
Mandi, Sadar Bazar. He stated that the owner of the said
property was M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai & Sons and that he was a
tenant under the said firm at a monthly rent of Rs.1,500/-.
4.

In view of the defence taken by the defendant

M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai & Sons was also impleaded as a coRSA No.145/04

page 2 of 6

defendant who I incidentally note filed an application under
Order 1 Rule 10 CPC seeking impleadment.
5.

Needless to state, even M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai & Sons

pleaded a case in conformity with the one pleaded by the sole
defendant i.e. the appellant.
6.

In view of the pleadings of the parties, the learned

Trial Judge rightly framed the issue whether the appellant is
tenant under the owner M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai & Sons and whether
the plaintiff was the owner of the suit property.
7.

The Courts below have concluded the issue in favour

of the plaintiff with reference to the sale certificate Ex.P-1, the
objections, Ex.P-2, filed by Shri Shadi Lal Ghai, a partner of
M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai & Sons, the decision thereon, Ex.P-5, an
appeal filed by M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai & Sons against the decision,
Ex.P-5, decided vide order Ex.P-6.
8.

When the property was sold by the custodian of

evacuee properties to the plaintiff (respondent in the instant
appeal), M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai & Sons filed objections vide Ex.P-2
before the Assistant Settlement Commissioner pointing out
that part of

their

property bearing Municipal No.XIV/2146

appears to have been sold to A.S.Khanna by mistake. Prayer
made in the application Ex.P-2 is as under:“It is, therefore, prayed most respectfully in the
RSA No.145/04

page 3 of 6

interest of justice that the sale deed dated
13.3.1967 be declared to be illegal and the same
be set aside, and the property No.XIV/2146
belonging to the petitioner be earmarked clearly
before the property No.2140-41 is sold.”
9.

As noted above, the said objection was dismissed

vide Ex.P-5 being an order dated 18.9.1967 passed by Shri
S.P.Sood, Assistant Settlement Commissioner who recorded
that what was sold vide Ex.P-1 is not a part of property
No.XIV/2146 and that what was sold was property No.XIV/214041.
10.

The order Ex.P-5 was taken in appeal before the

Assistant Settlement Commissioner by M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai &
Sons.

The appeal failed vide order dated 27.2.1968, Ex.P-6.

The Assistant Settlement Commissioner affirmed the findings
returned in Ex.P-5.
11.

M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai & Sons did not leave the matter

at that. They availed of a revisional remedy available to them
under Section 33 of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and
Rehabilitation) Act 1954.

21.3.1968 was

dismissed by Mr.Rajni Kant, the officer to whom powers of the
Central Government is delegated. The order is dated 3.7.1968
which has been proved as Ex.P-7.
12.

The findings returned vide order dated 27.2.1968

RSA No.145/04

page 4 of 6

Ex.P-6 were affirmed in appeal.
13.

Needless to state the owner of the property bearing

Municipal No.XIV/2146 namely defendant No.2 in the suit i.e.
M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai & Sons lost the title battle vis-a-vis the
plaintiff and since both i.e. the plaintiff and defendant No.2
claimed title under the Central Government, orders passed and
as noted above, concluded that the suit property was not part
of property bearing Municipal No.XIV/2146 but was bearing
Municipal No.XIV/2140-41.
14.

I need not deal with other evidence gone into for the

reason Ex.P-1, P-2, P-5, P-6 and P-7 conclude the issue in
favour of A.S.Khanna and against the appellant as also
M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai & Sons.
15.

Before concluding I may record that M/s.Bodh Raj

Ghai & Sons who have lost the title battle with A.S.Khanna
have not challenged the impugned judgment and decree.
16.

Since appellant claimed to be a tenant under

M/s.Bodh Raj Ghai & Sons obviously his possessory rights have
to fail.
17.

Thus, appellant would indeed be a trespasser in the

suit property for the reason neither the custodian nor
A.S.Khanna inducted him as a tenant.
18.

The RSA is dismissed.
