MANMOHAN, J: (ORAL)
1.

The present appeal has been filed by the State against the

acquittal order dated 18th April, 1994 passed by Shri M.L. Mehta,
Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi.
2.

The facts of this case are that the Food Inspector purchased a

sample of haldi powder from the shop of Respondent/Accused situated
at R.K. Puram, New Delhi. After taking a sample, the Food Inspector
got the same analyzed from a Public Analyst who reported that the said
sample did not conform to the standards as it contained abundance of
foreign starches.

The

trial

court

by

a

well

reasoned

order

acquitted

Respondent/Accused on the ground that the report of the Public Analyst
was vague and it did not conclusively prove that the seized sample was
adulterated.

The conclusion of the trial court is reproduced

hereinbelow for ready reference :“In view of what has been laid down in the aforesaid
cases, it can be held that on the basis of the report of the
P.A., no case of admixture of foreign starch or the sample
being otherwise adulterated on account of foreign starch,
was made out. The report of P.A. as such suffers from
vagueness and possibility could not be ruled out that the
foreign starch were present in traces which were
negligible; and could not make the sample as adulterated,
unless it was shown that these starches were unfit for
human consumption or injurious to health, which infact
was not the case of the prosecution. Hence, the accused is
entitled to be acquitted of the offence for which he was sent
to face the prosecution. As such the accused is acquitted.”
4.

This Court is also of the view that the Public Analyst’s report

lacks particulars, as even according to the Appellant it neither
mentioned the percentage of foreign starches nor did it conclusively
state that the seized sample of haldi power was unfit for human
consumption or injurious to public health.
5.

Consequently, present appeal being devoid of merits is

dismissed.
