JUDGMENT
1.

The Petitioners have assailed the acquisition of their land

pursuant to the following Orders dated 30.6.2000 passed by the
WP(C) No.5046/2000

Page 1 of 10

Hon. Lt. Governor of Delhi:
“I have gone through the records and requirement
of the Delhi Development Authority and the draft
notification prepared by LAC.
I am fully satisfied that the land at Okhla
measuring 17-14 Bigha bearing Kh. Nos.34(5-09), 35(712), 46(4-13) is urgently required for a valid purpose,
namely for Planned Development of Delhi (Master Plan of
Jamial Milia Islamia) ... In view of the urgency of the
scheme, I order that notifications Under section 4, 6 & 17
(1)

of

the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 be issued

immediately”.

2.

The Notification dated 13.7.2000 inter alia states that “The

Lt. Governor, Delhi is satisfied also that provisions of sub-section
(1) of the section 17 of the said Act are applicable to this land and
is further pleased under sub-section (4) of the said section to
direct that all the provisions of Section 5(A) shall not apply”.

3.

The contention of Mr. Ravindra Sethi, learned Senior

Counsel for the Petitioner, is that the draft Notification put up to
the Hon. Lt. Governor as well as other notings on the file make it
abundantly clear that the proposal of the Delhi Government was
to invoke the powers contained in Section 17(4) of the Land
Acquisition Act (LA Act for short). Mr. Sethi argues that since the
WP(C) No.5046/2000

Page 2 of 10

Hon. Lt. Governor has not made any reference to Section 17(4),
but has instead mentioned Section 17(1) alone in his Order, the
only inference that can be drawn is that he did not propose to
invoke those provisions. It is also Mr. Sethi's contention that
unless an Order specifically under Section 17(4) is passed, an
opportunity to file Objections under Section 5-A of the LA Act
must be given to the Petitioners either by virtue of their being
owners, or occupiers or persons interested in the land sought to
be acquired.

4.

On behalf of the Respondents it has been stated that large

tracts of land had been acquired in this very area by a previous
Notification dated 4.4.1964, followed by a second Declaration
dated 7.12.1966; followed by notices under Sections 9 and 10
dated 27.12.1992. These were with regard to Khasra Nos.34, 35
and 46.

The owner of the land, the Delhi Simla Catholic

Archdiocese, laid a challenge to these acquisition proceedings in
CW No.150/1983. The acquisition, however, was found to be in
consonance with the law in terms of the celebrated decision in

Roshanara Begum -vs- UOI, AIR 1996 Delhi 206 and the petition
was dismissed. However, due to the pendency of this litigation
the acquisition process could not be completed. A Representation
WP(C) No.5046/2000

Page 3 of 10

was, therefore, made to the Hon. Lt. Governor by the Vice
Chancellor, Jamia Millia Islamia (University) requesting that
further action should be taken because the land was acquired for
transferring it to Jamia Millia Islamia (University) but the same
came in possession of unauthorised occupants (who are the
petitioners herein).

This led to the publication of the second

Notification dated 13.7.2000 under Section 4, read with Section
17 of the LA Act which appears to have been published inter alia
in the Hindustan Times on 18.7.2000.

On the first date of

hearing, on 5.9.2000, interim Orders were passed directing the
maintenance of status quo as to the possession.

5.

Mr. Poddar, learned counsel for the Land Acquisition

Collector, has drawn our attention to Krishi Utpadan Mandi

Samiti, Muzaffarnagar(U.P.) -vs- Ratan Prakash Mangal, AIR
1988 SC 1459 and Union of India -vs- Praveen Gupta, (1997) 9
SCC 78 to buttress his argument that since a second Notification
had been necessitated, after the first Notification was found to be
in order, no further challenge could legitimately be raised. He
has also underscored the fact that a reading of the Petition will
disclose that the argument that is now sought to be raised was
not pleaded viz. that an order specifically under Section 17(4)
WP(C) No.5046/2000

Page 4 of 10

should necessarily have been passed. In Praveen Gupta their
Lordships had come to the conclusion that acquisition of land to
ease traffic congestion in the walled city was unassailable. They
also opined that the “decision on emergency is an administrative
decision and is a matter of subjective satisfaction of the
appropriate Government on the basis of the material available on
record. Therefore, there was no need to pass any reasoned order
to reach the conclusion that there is urgency so as to dispense
with the enquiry under Section 5-A in exercise of power under
Section 17(4)”. The following passage from Krishi Utpadan has
been heavily relied upon:
13.

There seems to be no doubt with regard to the

legal position that the report dated 20th January, 1981
submitted by the Land Acquisition Officer was not
binding on the State Government and it was still open to
continue the proceedings for acquisition of Plot No.289
notwithstanding the said report. The reason why in place
of issuing a Notification under Section 6(1) of the Act in
continuation of the Notification dated 26th October, 1978
under Section 4(1) fresh Notifications under Sections 4
and 6 had to be issued as also the reason for the delay in
issuing

the

fresh

Notifications

have

already

been

indicated above. As regards the submissions that Section
17(4) of the Act has been

erroneously invoked in the

fresh Notification under Section 4(1) dated 20th May,
1982 also and that inquiry under Section 5-A had again
WP(C) No.5046/2000

Page 5 of 10

to be made before issuing this Notification, suffice it to
point out that once an inquiry under the said Section had
already been made and the parties had been given full
opportunity to substantiate their case in the said inquiry
and the State Government was not inclined to agree with
the report of the Land Acquisition Officer submitted in
pursuance of that inquiry it would have been a futile
exercise to repeat the whole performance again. After
the issue of the earlier Notification dated 26th October,
1978 a period of nearly 3-1/2 years had expired when the
fresh Notification dated 20th May, 1982 under Section 4
(1) was issued and apparently the necessity to acquire
Plot No.289 during this period became more acute due to
this delay. Further, as stated in the Notification dated
20th May, 1982 itself the urgency had become more
imminent on account of the direction issued by this court
on 2nd March, 1982 in Writ Petition No.1318 of 1982 filed
by the traders challenging the Notification under Section
7(2)(b) of U.P. Act No.25 of 1964. Consequently, we find
it difficult to hold that the opinion of the State
Government that it was a fit case to invoke Section 17(4)
of the Act was invalid on the ground that there was no
basis or material in support of that opinion.

We are

further of the view that on the facts indicated above it is
also not possible to hold that the Notification dated 20th
May, 1982 had been issued by the State Government in
colourable exercise of its power.
6.

Mr. Sethi has argued that these decisions are of no avail to

the Respondents since the arguments raised in the present
WP(C) No.5046/2000

Page 6 of 10

petitions are that Orders under Section 17(4) are essential, and
this argument had not been raised earlier. Therefore, whether
there was, in fact, urgency in the matter has not been assailed by
the present Petitioners.

The frequently quoted opinion of the

House of Lords in Quinn v. Leathem, 1901 AC 495 : (1900-3) All
ER Rep 1 is that of Lord Halsbury, namely, that “every judgment
must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or
assumed to be proved .... The other is that a case is only an
authority for what is actually decides”. These quotations have
been reiterated in Goodyear India Ltd. -vs- State of Haryana,
(1990) 2 SCC 71 and State of Orissa -vs- Sudhansu Sekhar Misra,
AIR 1968 SC 647. In the latter case, the Court explicitly opined
that “a decision on a question which has not been argued cannot
be treated as a precedent”.

Their Lordships, in turn, referred

back to the previous opinion in Rajput Ruda Meha -vs- State of

Gujarat, 1980 SC 1707 in which it had similarly been stated that
where an issue has neither been raised nor argued any decision
by the Court, even after 'pondering over the issue in depth',
would not be a binding precedent.

Similar observations have

been made by the Constitution Bench in Padma Sundara Rao -vs-

State of T.N., 2002(3) SCC 533, as is evident from the following
extract:
WP(C) No.5046/2000

Page 7 of 10

Courts should not place reliance on decisions

without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in
with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance
is placed. There is always peril in treating the words of
a speech or judgment as though they are words in a
legislative enactment, and it is to be remembered that
judicial utterances are made in the setting of the facts of
a particular case, said Lord Morris in Herrington v.

British

Railways

Board,

(1972)

2

WLR

537.

Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different fact
may make a world of difference between conclusions in
two cases.
We have carefully perused the Judgments in Nandeshwar Prasad

-vs- The State of U.P., [1964] 3 SCR 425, Union of India -vsMukesh Hans, (2004) 8 SCC 14 and Union of India -vs- Krishan
Lal Arneja, AIR 2004 SC 3582 in order to ascertain whether it
had been argued that a separate decision must be taken under
Section 17(1) or (2) on the one hand, and Section 17(4) on the
other; or that even if Section 17(1) or 17(2) are resorted to,
Objections under Section 5-A must be invited and decided before
an acquisition can be completed. Our research is that these
contentions had not been raised. Therefore, the dictum in Quinn
assumes great significance. We will nonetheless give due
deference to all the observations made by the Apex Court, even
though we find from the pleadings before us, that grounds
WP(C) No.5046/2000

Page 8 of 10

predicated on the above arguments have not been articulated in
the petitions.

Indubitably, these are legal contentions and we

would be loathe to ignore them solely for the reason that they
have not been pleaded. But this state of affairs has obviously
been occasioned because of the views ventilated in Mukesh

Hans.

7.

Mr. Sethi has also emphasised the fact that the controversy

has been put to rest by the decision of three-Judge Bench in

Mukesh Hans. He has pointed out that the acquisition
proceedings were held not to be legal even though they came in
the form of a second Notification. Therefore the earlier decision
in Krishi Utpadan to the effect that a new enquiry would be
futile in the case of a second Notification of the same land is no
longer binding.

8.

We consider it appropriate to record all the arguments

raised by the adversaries before us even though we do not
propose to consider them for the simple reason that we feel it
inappropriate to exercise the powers vested in us by virtue of
Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

In

proceedings (CW 2383/1983 and 150/1983), on 19.11.1983,
WP(C) No.5046/2000

Page 9 of 10

interim orders had been passed for maintenance of status quo as
regards possession, construction and occupation. It has not been
controverted that the present petitioners have acquired the land
from Delhi Simla Catholic Archdiocese subsequent to the passing
of these Orders.
Archdiocese

It has been explained that Delhi Simla Catholic

had

executed

a

General

Power

of

Attorney

authorising the Petitioners to enter into further transaction only
on obtaining necessary permission. These permissions have not
been

obtained

but

the

property

has

been

illegally

and

unauthorisedly purchased, contrary to the Court Orders. The
Petitioners are unlawfully obstructing the cause of Jamia Millia
Islamia (University). The Petitioners have not approached this
Court with clean hands. We, therefore, decline to exercise
extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India. The Writ Petition is dismissed.
