1.

The Petitioner joined as Khalasi with the Respondent

in 1978 and was promoted to the post of S.S. Fitter w.e.f.
15.12.1980. He was further promoted to the post of Fitter w.e.f.
15.1.1983 in the pay scale of Rs.950-1500. After rendering 7
years of service he became eligible for promotion to the next
higher grade of Rs.1200-1800. It appears that the juniors of the

Petitioner were promoted to the next higher grade of Rs.12001800 while he was left out. He represented against his being
denied promotion but to no avail. In the meantime, his juniors
were further promoted as Fitter Grade I in the pay scale of
Rs.1320-2040 in the year 1993. He further represented on
24.9.1999 for promotion and for his being placed at par with his
juniors. Eventually, he filed O.A. No. 1540/002, which was
disposed

of

on

6.6.2002

by

the

Tribunal

directing

the

Respondents to dispose of the Petitioner's representation. The
Petitioner filed CCP No.491/2002 complaining that the orders
were not complied with. Finally the grievance of the Petitioner
was redressed and he was promoted to the post of Fitter Grade I
in the pay scale of Rs.4500-7000 with effect from 1.6.2003. Not
satisfied, the Petitioner once again approached the Tribunal by
filing O.A. No. 502/2004 seeking promotion from 1991 when his
juniors were promoted.
2.

The Respondents contested the application. It was

pointed out that the Juniors of the Petitioner, who were granted
promotion prior to him, fell in reserved category. The applicant,
though falling in the reserved category had never disclosed about
the same ever since he joined the Respondent department. In
pursuance of the order of Tribunal dated 6.6.2002, the Petitioner
W.P. (C) No. 1618/2007

was granted proforma promotion on the post of Fitter Grade II in
the pay scale of Rs.400-6000 with effect from May 1991 and on
the post of Fitter Grade I in the pay scale of Rs.4500-7000 with
effect from 1.3.1993 at par with his juniors vide letter dated
19.5.2003. Actual payment in the higher grade had been given to
the Petitioner with effect from 1.6.2003. In terms of Railway Board
instructions vide letter No. E(NG)I-2002/PMI/16 dated 2.7.2003, no
arrears were payable to the Petitioner on proforma promotion.
The Respondent relied on decision of the Supreme Court wherein
it has been held that the employees were not entitled to higher
salary during the period of proforma promotion on the basis of the
principle 'no work no pay', since they had not worked on the
higher posts. The Tribunal by relying on paragraph 228 of the
Indian Railway Employees Manual (IREM) and the aforesaid letter
of the Railway Board dated 2.7.2003 dismissed the aforesaid OA.
The Tribunal has also relied on various decisions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court including those rendered in Union of India and
others vs. P.O. Abraham and others, in C.A. No.8904/1994,
decided on 13.8.1997, Virender Kumar, General Manager,
Northern Railway, New Delhi vs. Avinash Chander Chadha,
(1990) 2 SCR 769, State of A.P. vs. K.V.L. Narasimha and
others, (1999) 4 SCC 181, State of Haryana & Others vs.
W.P. (C) No. 1618/2007

Page 3 of 5

O.P.Gupta & Others, (1996) 7 SCC 533 and a few others.
Learned counsel for the Respondent has also drawn our attention
to the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Union of India
and Anrvs. Tarsem Lal and others, (2006) 9 SCALE 485 SC. In
this case, the Supreme Court was concerned squarely with para
228 of the IREM and by relying on Virender Singh (Supra) and
P.O., Abraham (Supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held
that on notional promotion, arrears of pay should not be given.
Apart from the aforesaid, in the facts of the case we find that the
Petitioner slept over his rights for a long time. He claimed that he
was discriminated and his juniors were promoted in the year
1990. However he approached the Tribunal for the first time only
in the year 2002 i.e. after about 12 years.
3.

In view of the aforesaid legal position and in the facts

of this case, we find no merit in this petition and accordingly
dismiss the same.
