defendants.
2.

The facts of the case relevant for the decision of this

application are as follows :3.

The plaintiffs are manufacturing and marketing dental

products including toothbrushes, tooth paste and tooth powder in
India under the well known trade mark 'COLGATE'. One of the
products of the plaintiffs is a tooth brush marketed under the trade
name 'COLGATE EXTRA CLEAN'. The shape and design of the
said toothbrush is the subject matter of design registration no.
185480 dated 9.5.2001. It is stated that the said design registration
is currently valid for a period of five years upto 9.5.2006. The
plaintiffs have alleged infringement of their design registered vide
No. 185480 by the defendants for which the cease and desist notice
was sent to them. In respect of design registration No. 185480 dated
9.5.2001, the plaintiffs have filed the present suit seeking various
reliefs as mentioned above. The plaintiffs have also prayed for grant
of interim injunction during the pendency of the suit.
4.

The defendants in their reply to the injunction

application have taken a primary defence of prior design registration
under No. 185103 dated 22.3.2001 in respect of their

'CELLO'

toothbrush.

Confronted with the defence taken by the defendants in

their reply to the injunction application, the plaintiffs have come up
with the instant amendment application seeking to incorporate the
existence of four additional design registrations of variants of the
toothbrush to which the toothbrush design in the present suit is
related. The details of these additional design registrations are as
follows:176343 dated 4th May 1998
176345 dated 4th May 1998
180362 dated 16th September 1999
176344 dated 4th May 1998
6.

In

substance,

the

plaintiffs

now

seek

to

allege

infringement on the part of the defendants even in respect of its four
other design registrations by adding Paragraphs 4A and 13A after
Paragraphs 4 and 13 of the plaint. The plaintiffs also seek to amend
prayer clause (a) in Paragraph 18 of the plaint. The amendment
proposed to be made in the plaint is to the following effect:“4A. The plaintiff is also the registered design
owner of 'toothbrush” as set out below:-

13A. The impugned toothbrush design of the
defendants under the trademark CELLO infringes the
plaintiff's registered designs bearing numbers 176343
dated 4th May 1998, 176345 dated 4th May 1998,
180362 dated 16 September 1999 and 176344 dated 4th
May 1998 as the essential features of the said
registrations have been fraudulently imitated by the
defendants. The defendants are estopped from taking
the defence of lack of novelty or distinctiveness or
prior publication against the plaintiffs registered
designs since the defendants have admittedly obtained
registration for a similar design subsequently. As such
the defendants have no plausible defence to
infringement and the fact of their registration of
CS(OS) 1483/2003

Page 4 of 14

7.

design No. 185103 in itself amounts to an admission of
the invalidity thereof being hit by lack of novelty and
distinctiveness as well as prior publication. The
impugned design registration of the defendant is liable
to be cancelled being clearly covered as it is by the
plaintiffs registration Nos. 176343, 176345, 180362
and 176344 for the design of toothbrush. The plaintiffs
are taking appropriate steps to file a cancellation
petition against the impugned design No. 185103 in
the Patent Office, Kolkata.
18(a).
For a decree of permanent injunction
restraining the defendants, their partners/proprietor,
principal officers, servants, agents, representatives,
dealers and all others acting for and on its behalf,
from making, selling, offering for sale, advertising,
directly or indirectly dealing in toothbrushes being an
obvious and fraudulent imitation of the design of the
'COLGATE EXTRA CLEAN' toothbrush amounting to
infringement of plaintiff No.1's registered design Nos.
185480, 176343, 176345, 180362 and 176344.”
It is stated by the plaintiffs that the amendments sought

are bonafide and are based on statutory rights and necessitated due
to the disclosure in the defendants' reply to IA 7742/2003 which
were not in the plaintiffs' knowledge before the said reply was filed.
It is further stated that the plaintiffs had no reason or cause to
anticipate the defence taken by the defendants prior to the
institution of the suit. According to the plaintiffs, the amendments
proposed to be made in the plaint are necessary to resolve the
matter in controversy.
8.

The defendants have filed their reply in opposition to the

grant of prayer made in the instant application. The defendants
CS(OS) 1483/2003

Page 5 of 14

have contended that the plaintiffs are trying to set up a totally new
case based upon the design registration numbers which were not
disclosed earlier. According to the defendants, the incorporation of
additional registered designs amounts to adding a new cause of
action which cannot be allowed being contrary to law. As per the
defendants, the proposed amendment establishes the fraudulent
conduct of the plaintiffs as they have filed the present suit claiming
novelty and distinctiveness in their design registered under
registration No. 185480 whereas the same is now being claimed to
be variation of subject matter of prior registration design Nos.
176343, 176344, 176345 and 180362. It is contended that the
amendments proposed to be made in the plaint are totally frivolous,
unnecessary and untenable in law. It is contended that in case the
amendment proposed to be made in the plaint are allowed, it will
cause irreparable prejudice to the defendants as the plaintiffs would
succeed in setting up a new case which is contrary to law.
9.

I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for both

the parties and have also perused the record.
10.

In the suit originally filed, the plaintiffs have alleged

infringement of its design registered under registration No. 185480
dated 9.5.2001 in respect of its toothbrushes. The defendants in
CS(OS) 1483/2003

Page 6 of 14

their reply to the injunction application have taken a defence of
prior registration of the design in their favour. The defendants have
stated that they hold prior design registration under No. 185103
dated 22.3.2001 in respect of their 'CELLO' toothbrush. The
plaintiffs' design registration No. 185480 is dated 9.5.2001.
11.

Having realized that the defendants have taken a

defence of prior registration, the plaintiffs now by way of
amendment seek to allege that the defendants are guilty of
infringement of their other designs registered under registration
Nos. 176343, 176345, 180362, 176344 in respect of their 'COLGATE'
toothbrush. The said amendment proposed to be made in the plaint
was strongly opposed by the learned counsel for the defendants who
had argued that in case proposed amendment is allowed then it
would change the entire cause of action in the suit. The contention of
the counsel for the defendants was that it is the registration of a
design and its infringement that gives rise to a cause of action to the
plaintiff to file a suit in respect of such design. It was further argued
that each registration gives rise to a separate cause of action. On the
other hand, Mr.Anand appearing for the plaintiffs had argued that
the proposed amendment would not change the quality and quantity
of the reliefs claimed by the plaintiffs in the suit. His contention was
CS(OS) 1483/2003

Page 7 of 14

that the plaintiffs are alleging infringement in the design of their
product 'COLGATE' toothbrush. According to Mr.Anand, the
plaintiffs only seek to bring more material before the Court to
establish their case of infringement of their designs by the
defendants and the same would not amount to changing the cause
espoused in the suit. The plaintiffs' learned counsel had referred to a
judgment of the Supreme Court in Kailash vs. Nanhku & Ors.
(2005) 4 SCC 480 and had laid emphasis on Para 28 at Page 495 of
the said judgment which is extracted below:“All the rules of procedure are the handmaid of
justice. The language employed by the draftsman
of processual law may be liberal or stringent, but
the fact remains that the object of prescribing
procedure is to advance the cause of justice. In an
adversarial system, no party should ordinarily be
denied the opportunity of participating in the
process of justice dispensation. Unless compelled
by express and specific language of the statute, the
provisions of CPC or any other procedural
enactment ought not to be construed in a manner
which would leave the court helpless to meet
extraordinary situations in the ends of justice. The
observations made by Krishna Iyer, J. in Sushil
Kumar Sen v. State of Bihar are pertinent: (SCC
p.777, paras 5-6)
“The mortality of justice at the hands
of law troubles a judge's conscience and points an
angry interrogation at the law reformer.
The processual law so dominates in
certain systems as to overpower substantive rights
and substantial justice. The humanist rule that
procedure should be the handmade, not the
CS(OS) 1483/2003

Page 8 of 14

mistress, of legal justice compels consideration of
vesting a residuary power in judges to act ex debito
justitiae where the tragic sequel otherwise would
be wholly inequitable ..... justice is the goal of
jurisprudence – processual, as much as
substantive.”
12.

Replying on the above judgment, it was argued by

Mr.Anand that as procedures are handmaid of justice, the
procedural law should not come in his way in making out a case of
infringement against the defendants. There is no dispute about the
proposition laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforementioned judgment but the point to be decided in the present case
is whether the amendment proposed to be made by the plaintiffs in
the plaint can be allowed without injustice to the other side or can it
not?
13.

The cause of action for a suit is a bundle of facts to be

proved by a party before the reliefs prayed for can be granted. What
the plaintiffs have alleged in the suit originally instituted is that the
defendants have infringed their design registered under registration
No.185480 dated 9.5.2001 in respect of their product 'COLGATE'
toothbrush. However, now by way of proposed amendment the
plaintiffs seek to allege infringement in respect of its other designs
registered under Registration Nos. 176343, 176344, 176345 and

CS(OS) 1483/2003

Page 9 of 14

180362 also.
14.

Whether amendment can or cannot be allowed has to be

seen in the light of the provisions contained in Order VI Rule 17
CPC which are reproduced herein below:-

15.

“Order VI
PLEADINGS GENERALLY
17. Amendment of pleadings - The Court may
at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to
alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on
such terms as may be just, and all such
amendments shall be made as may be necessary for
the purpose of determining the real questions in
controversy between the parties:
Provided that no application for amendment
shall be allowed after the trial has commenced,
unless the Court comes to the conclusion that in
spite of due diligence, the party could not have
raised the matter before the commencement of
trial.”
The purpose and object of Order VI Rule 17 CPC is to

allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in such a manner
and on such terms as may be just. The power to allow the
amendment is wide and can be exercised at any stage of the
proceedings in the interest of justice on the basis of guidelines laid
down by the various High Courts and the Supreme Court. The
amendment cannot be claimed as a matter of right and under all
circumstances. However, the Courts while deciding such prayers
should not adopt hypertechnical approach. Liberal approach should

CS(OS) 1483/2003

Page 10 of 14

be the general rule particularly in cases where the other side can be
compensated by costs. Technicalities of law should not be permitted
to hamper the Courts in administration of justice between the
parties. Amendments are normally allowed in the pleadings to avoid
multiplicity of litigation.
16.

In

Pirgonda

Hongonda

Patil

vs.

Kalgonda

Shidgonda Patil & Ors. AIR 1957 SCC 368, it was held by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court as under :-

17.

“All amendments ought to be allowed which
satisfy the two conditions(a) not working injustice
to the other side, and (b) of being necessary for
the purpose of determining the real questions in
controversy between the parties. Amendments
should be refused only where the other party
cannot be placed in the same position as if the
pleading had been originally correct, but the
amendment would cause him an injury which
could not be compensated in costs. It is merely a
particular case of this general rule that where a
plaintiff seeks to amend by setting up afresh
claim in respect of a cause of action which since
the institution of the suit had become barred by
limitation, the amendment must be refused; to
allow it would be to cause the defendant an
injury which could not be compensated in costs by
depriving him of a good defence to the claim. The
ultimate test therefore still remains the same :
can the amendment be allowed without injustice
to the other side, or can it not?”
Let us test the proposed amendment which plaintiffs seek to make

in their plaint on the touch stone of the above guidelines laid down by the

CS(OS) 1483/2003

Page 11 of 14

Hon'ble Supreme Court on the subject. The basic question that calls for
consideration is whether the defendants would suffer an injustice in case the
amendment proposed to be made in the plaint is allowed and whether the
injustice so caused to them cannot be compensated in terms of costs. In case
the injustice likely to be caused to the defendants by allowing the proposed
amendment cannot be compensated in terms of cost then the amendment cannot
be allowed. In the present case, the defendants have raised a plea of prior
registration in their favour and this would prima facie non suit the plaintiffs in
view of provisions contained in Section 22(3) read with Section 19 of the
Designs Act, 2000. Section 22 (1) and (2) of the Designs Act, 2000 provides a
key to the question whether each registration gives rise to a separate cause of
action. The provisions of Section 22 (1) and (2) of the Designs Act, 2000 are to
the following effect:22. Piracy of registered design. (1) During the existence of copyright in any design it shall not
be lawful for any person-(a)
for the purpose of sale to apply or cause to be
applied to any article in any class of articles in which the
design is registered, the design or any fraudulent or obvious
imitation thereof, except with the licence or written consent of
the registered proprietor, or to do anything with a view to
enable the design to be so applied; or
(b)
to import for the purposes of sale, without the
consent of the registered proprietor, any article belonging to
the class in which the design has been registered, and having
applied to it the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation
thereof; or
(c ) knowing that the design or any fraudulent or
obvious imitation thereof has been applied to any article in any
CS(OS) 1483/2003

Page 12 of 14

18.

class of articles in which the design is registered without the
consent of the registered proprietor, to publish or expose or
cause to be published or exposed for sale that article.
(2)
If any person acts in contravention of this section, he
shall be liable for every contravention--(a)
to pay to the registered proprietor of the design a
sum not exceeding twenty-five thousand rupees recoverable as
a contract debt, or
(b)
if the proprietor elects to bring a suit for the
recovery of damages for any such contravention, and for an
injunction against the repetition thereof, to pay such damages
as may be awarded and to be restrained by injunction
accordingly:
Provided that the total sum recoverable in respect of any one
design under clause (a) shall not exceed fifty thousand rupees:
Provided further that no suit or any other proceeding for relief
under this sub-section shall be instituted in any court below the
court of District Judge.”
A plain reading of the above statutory provisions would

show that the infringement of each registration would give rise to a
separate cause of action which has to be specifically pleaded by the
plaintiff who seeks to bring an action in Court for infringement of
copyright in design registered under the Designs Act, 2000.
Furthermore, the plaintiff has to specifically allege as to copyright in
which particular design has been infringed by the defendants.
Registration of each design gives rise to a separate cause of action. I
am of the considered opinion that in case the plaintiffs seek to allege
violation of copyright by the defendants in respect of its earlier designs
registered under registration nos. 176343, 176344, 176345, 180362
then the plaintiffs have to file a separate suit for the said purpose. The
designs under registration nos. 176343, 176344, 176345, 180362 by no
means can be allowed to be incorporated in the suit originally filed only
CS(OS) 1483/2003

Page 13 of 14

in respect of one design registered under registration No. 185480 dated
9.5.2001. The amendment, if allowed, would change the entire cause of
action

and would cause a serious prejudice to the defendants that

cannot be compensated in terms of costs. Hence, the amendment
proposed to be made in the plaint cannot be allowed.
19.

In view of the above, I do not find any merit in the instant

amendment application and the same is, therefore, dismissed but with
no order as to costs.
