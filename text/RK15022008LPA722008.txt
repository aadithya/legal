DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ. (ORAL)

1.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated

07.12.2007 passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing the writ
petition of the appellant on the ground of inordinate delay and
laches.
2.

On the basis of a dispute raised by the appellant, the

Secretary (Labour), Delhi Administration referred the dispute in the
following terms:
“Whether the workmen as shown in “Annexure A” are
LPA 72/2008

entitled to be regularised and if so to what relief are
they entitled and what directions are necessary in this
respect?”
3.

After receipt of the aforesaid reference, the Industrial Tribunal

allowed the parties to file their pleadings.

The learned Industrial

Adjudicator after completing the proceedings disposed of the
reference by passing an award on 10.09.2003. In the said award,
the Industrial Tribunal held that the workmen are not entitled for
regularisation as they were appointed on contractual period for a
period of six months from 01.11.1990. It was also held that thereafter
their services were not continued although there was an order
passed by the High Court for maintenance of status quo. The said
order also ultimately came to be vacated on 02.03.1993. In the light
of the aforesaid observations and findings recorded by the learned
Industrial Adjudicator, the reference was answered against the
workmen and in favour of the respondent. The workmen did not
challenge the said award immediately.
4.

The writ petition came to be filed before the learned Single

Judge in the year 2007 after a gap of four years. The stand taken in
the writ petition is that the appellant did not file the present writ
petition and did not challenge the award dated 10th September,
2003 under a misconception as he has filed a writ petition as
against the order passed by the Industrial Adjudicator in the
application filed under Section 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act.
Undoubtedly, both the proceedings are distinct and separate
proceedings. The present proceeding arises out of the reference
LPA 72/2008

proceedings made by the appropriate Government.

Despite

pendency of the aforesaid proceeding, it was possible to initiate
present writ proceeding, particularly when he himself got the
reference proceeding initiated. It was necessary for the appellant
to diligently take steps if he was in any manner aggrieved by the
aforesaid award dated 10th September, 2003. The writ petition is
filed after a lapse of four years and without giving any appropriate
explanation. There is no whisper in the writ petition as to why the
appellant did not file the said writ petition immediately after the
award was passed on 10th September, 2003.
5.

In that view of the matter, we find no error in the judgment

passed by the learned Single Judge. The appeal has no merits and
LPA 72/2008 and CM No.2351/2008 are accordingly dismissed.
