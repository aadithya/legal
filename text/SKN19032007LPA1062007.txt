Allowed subject to all just exceptions.
R.A. No.93/2007 & CM No.3392/2007
1. We had allowed the Appeal filed by the appellant vide Order
th

dated 27 February, 2007 and vacated the Stay Order dated
31

st

January, 2007 granted by the learned Single Judge.

These applications

for Stay and Review have now been

filed by the respondent, Mr. Anil Prakash.
2. Learned counsel for the applicant was heard at length for
more than 30 minutes. Learned counsel wanted us to rehear the matter on merits. However, this cannot be permitted
and allowed in view of Order XLVII of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the Code, for
short) and limited power of review which this Court has. We
cannot re-examine and re-appreciate the contentions raised
and decided in the original order, while deciding a review
application. Power of this Court is circumscribed by the
conditions specified in Order XLVII of the Code.
3. Learned

Counsel

relied

upon

Common

Cause,

a

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 3

Registered Society versus Union of India and others,
reported in (1999) 6 SCC 667. In this case the Supreme
Court has held that where error or mistake is made by the
Supreme Court or the High Courts in exercise of their
plenary powers under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution
of India, the mistake once pointed out should be corrected,
as an error made by the court should not cause prejudice to
any one. The said decision has no application to the present
case as for applying the said principle there should be an
error or mistake made by the court on erroneous
assumption,

which

results

in

miscarriage

of

justice.

Similarly, in Bhavnagar University versus Platina Sugar
Mill (P) Limited and others reported in (2003) 2 SCC 111,
the Supreme Court has clarified that facts or statement
mentioned in any order or judgement is conclusive of what is
stated and cannot be contradicted by filing affidavit or other
evidence by parties. In case of error, the remedy available
to a party is to file a review application before the same

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 4

court. However, in some cases, a party may resile from the
statement made and the appellate court can permit him to
question the decision of non-appreciation of law, which had
caused injustice. Certainly this Court has power to review its
earlier decision in case any contention as raised has been
ignored or there is a mistake apparent on the face of the
record. However, the present case does not fall in the said
exceptions. The contentions as raised had been noticed in
the Order dated 27

th

February, 2007 and had been duly

considered. There can also not be any dispute that power of
the Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India are
not fettered by normal legal constraints and in a given case
the Court may correct its own mistake. However, we do not
feel that in the present case the said principle is required to
be applied. Suffice it is to refer to the case of Meera Bhanja
versus Nirmala Kumari Choudhury reported in (1995) 1
SCC 170. In this case the contention raised was that the
power to review inheres in every court of plenary jurisdiction

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 5

to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave and
palpable errors committed by it. The Supreme Court
reversed the judgement of the Division Bench of the High
Court and observed as follows:
“15. In our view the aforesaid approach of the
Division Bench dealing with the review
proceedings clearly shows that it has
overstepped its jurisdiction under Order 47, Rule
1 CPC by merely styling the reasoning adopted
by the earlier Division Bench as suffering from a
patent error. It would not become a patent error
or error apparent in view of the settled legal
position indicated by us earlier. In substance, the
Review Bench has reappreciated the entire
evidence, sat almost as court of appeal and has
reversed the findings reached by the earlier
Division Bench. Even if the earlier Division
Benchs
findings regarding C.S. Plot No. 74 were
found to be erroneous, it would be no ground for
reviewing the same, as that would be the function
of an appellate court. Learned counsel for the
respondent was not in a position to point out how
the reasoning adopted and conclusion reached
by the Review Bench can be supported within the
narrow and limited scope of Order 47, Rule 1
CPC. Right or wrong, the earlier Division Bench
judgment had become final so far as the High
Court was concerned. It could not have been
reviewed by reconsidering the entire evidence
with a view to finding out the alleged apparent
error for justifying the invocation of review

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 6

powers. Only on that short ground, therefore, this
appeal is required to be allowed.”

4. However, to satisfy the applicant-respondent we have
examined the contentions raised and the decisions relied
upon by him. Learned counsel for the applicant relied upon
the decision in the case of Sahil Singh Maniktala versus
Harpreet Singh reported in 118 (2005) DLT 350 and
Begum Aftab Zamami versus Shri Lal Chand Khanna
reported in AIR 1969 Delhi 351. The latter judgement follows
line of reasoning which was not accepted by the Supreme
Court in the case of Shah Babu Lal Khimji versus
Jayaben D. Kalia reported in (1981) 4 SCC 8. In our Order
dated 27

th

February, 2007 we have also referred to the

subsequent judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of
Subal Paul versus Malina Paul reported in (2003) 10 SCC
361.
5. Judgement of this Court in Sahil Singh Maniktala & others
versus Harpreet Singh and others reported in 118 (2005)

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 7

DLT 350 (DB) does not help the case of the appellant as in
the said case no ex-parte stay was granted and the Order
passed by the learned Single Judge refusing to grant exparte stay was taken up in Appeal. In Sahil Singh case
(supra), the Court noticed that no party has right to claim exparte interim relief and a Judge has every right to decide the
same after affording hearing to the other side. Thus, an
Appeal under Section 10 of the Delhi High Court Act or
Letters Patent Appeal may not be maintainable against an
order refusing to grant ex-parte stay. Moreover, in paragraph
11 of the judgement, the Division Bench itself has noticed
that in some cases an appeal may be maintainable. The
factual position in the present case is to the contrary as an
interim injunction order was passed by the learned Single
Judge in the present matter. At the time when the Order
th

dated 27 February, 2007 was being dictated in the Court,
we had made it clear that we did not find any merit in the
preliminary objection raised by the respondent regarding

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 8

maintainability of the Appeal.
6. It may be pointed out here that there is a typographical error
th

in paragraph 5 of the Order dated 27 February, 2007. Full
Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court in case of Zila
Parishad versus Brahma is

reported in AIR 1970

Allahabad 376 and not in AIR 1976 Allahabad 376. A wrong
citation it is obvious, does not call for review or recall of the
entire order. The said typographical mistake is however
ordered to be corrected.
7. Learned counsel for the applicant further submitted that the
judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of State of
Haryana versus S.M.Sharma and others reported in AIR
1993 SC 2273 stands over-ruled in Secretary-cum-Chief
Commissioner, Chandigarh versus Hari Om Sharma and
others reported in JT 1998 (3) SC 654. We do not agree. In
Hari Om Sharma (supra) the Supreme Court distinguished
the decision in case of S.M. Sharma (supra), inter alia,
holding that every person has right to be considered for

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 9

promotion provided he is eligible. There cannot be any
dispute on the said proposition. It is well established. Right
of the respondent to be considered for appointment is not
disputed and not the controversy in issue. As and when
regular appointment to the post in question is made, if the
respondent is eligible, he has a right to be considered. S.M.
Sharma's case (supra) specifically deals with ad hoc
appointment or a stop gap conditional appointment. In S.M.
Sharma's case (supra) it has been held that no one has a
legal right to ask for and stick to current duty charge and the
high court should not have entertained the writ petition.
Prima facie, we also do not agree that the terms and
th

conditions of the letter dated 8 November, 2005 are void
being contrary to Section 23 of the Contract Act. Letter dated
th

8 November, 2005 stipulates the terms and conditions on
which the respondent was entrusted with look after the
charge of the post of Director-in-Chief (Sanitation), MCD.
This aspect will be finally decided by the Ld. Single Judge

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 10

while disposing of the writ petition and appropriate directions
can be given, if the applicant-respondent is successful.
8. Learned counsel for the respondent-applicant has also
referred to some judgments of the Supreme Court in which it
has been held that transfer or reversion, if malafide or
contrary to public policy, is bad and can be set aside. No
th

such plea at the time of arguments on 27 February, 2007
was raised. However, we have examined the reply to the
Show Cause Notice filed by the respondent. The respondent
in his counter-affidavit had raised plea of malafide in law and
not malafides in fact. It was further alleged that the action of
the appellant was arbitrary and affecting the respondent's
right and career prospects. These are allegations which can
be considered and decided by the learned Single Judge,
while deciding the writ petition on merits.
9. Other Judgements relied upon by the applicant-respondent
may now be noticed. In N.K. Singh versus Union of
India, reported in 1994 (3) Service Law Journal 37 (SC), the

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 11

Supreme Court has held that transfer of a public servant
holding a sensitive and important post has two aspects.
Firstly, the private right of the public servant as an individual
and secondly prejudice to public interest irrespective of the
private right of the individual. However, the Supreme Court
clarified that mere suspicion or likelihood of some prejudice
to the public interest is not enough and there should be
strong unimpeachable evidence to vitiate a transfer on the
ground of public interest.

Courts have to be extremely

cautious and must show circumspection when allegation of
prejudice to public interest is made. Learned counsel for the
applicant-respondent drew our attention to paragraph 10 in
V. Jagannadha Rao and others versus State of Andhra
Pradesh and others reported in JT 2001 (9) SC 477. In
the said paragraph, the Supreme Court has examined
definition of the term transfer and held that a Government
servant is liable to be transferred to a civil post in the same
cadre which is normal feature and incidence of a

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

government servant.

Page 12

It has been also held that no

government servant can claim right to stay at a particular
place or in a particular post unless his appointment itself is to
a specified non-transferable post. The said judgement does
not support the contention raised by the applicantrespondent.
10.In Jagdish Prasad Shastri versus State of U.P. and
others,

reported in 1971 (2) SCR 583, learned counsel

drew our attention to the observations of the Supreme Court
at page 588. In this case the Supreme Court noticed that
the name of the appellant therein had been directed to be
struck off from the list of officers eligible for promotion and
involved serious consequences.
11.The Supreme Court in State of U.P. and others versus
Sughar Singh reported in AIR 1974 SC 423 was examining
a case of reversion of one officer out of several others, who
were officiating at higher posts. The order was held to be
discriminatory as junior officers had been retained at the

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 13

officiating posts and it was admitted that the order of
reversion was by way of punishment due to adverse entry in
the character roll.
12. Similarly, in the case of Shrilekha Vidyarthi versus State
of U.P. reported in AIR 1991 SC 537, the Supreme Court
was examining en-block removal of all district government
counsels in the State of U.P. It was held that there was a
public element attached and Article 14 of the Constitution
was attracted.

In these circumstances, it was held that

termination of all the district counsels without existence of
any cause and cogent reason was arbitrary. The Court felt
that the respondent State had resorted to a Spoils system
alien to the constitutional scheme to throw out the
government counsel. The said judgement deals with public
interest aspect as highlighted by the Supreme Court in the
case of N.K. Singh (supra).
13.In R.D. Gupta and others versus Lt. Governor reported in
AIR 1987 SC 2086, it was held that ministerial staff in the

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 14

New Delhi Municipal Committee constituted a unified cadre.
Distinction was drawn with the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi in which there are three separate and independent
wings.

However, this does not in any way support the

contention raised by the applicant-respondent that he could
not be transferred, though he was appointed purely on Look
After charge basis. In Delhi Water Supply and Sewage
Disposal Committee and others versus J.P. Gupta and
others reported in 36 (1988) DLT 378, the Supreme Court
noticed that Municipal Corporation of Delhi

has three

separate municipal funds/accounts. The question arose in
the said case whether Delhi Municipal Corporation Service
Regulations, 1959 were applicable to the employees working
in Water Supply and Sewage Disposal Committee. Keeping
in view, Regulation 3 of the aforesaid Regulations, it was
held that they apply only to those employees who are paid
out of the general account.
14.We do not think that case for review of the Order dated 27

th

RA 93 & CM 3392 in LPA 106/2007

Page 15

February, 2007 is made out. Review Application and the
Stay Application are accordingly dismissed. It is again
clarified that the observations made in this order are only for
the purpose of deciding the present review application and
the writ petition shall be decided on merits without being
influenced by any of the findings and observations made in
this order.
