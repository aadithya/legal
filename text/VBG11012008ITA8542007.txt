Madan B.Lokur, J.(oral)
The Assessee is aggrieved by an order dated 30 th March, 2007
passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench 'B' in ITA
No. 3622/Del/1995 relevant for the assessment year 1992-93.
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we admit this
appeal and while dispensing with the filing of paper book, we frame
ITA 854/2007

page 1 of 5

the following substantial question of law for consideration:
Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was
justified in differing with the view taken by a coordinate Bench of the Tribunal in respect of the
same Assessee for the assessment year 1985-86?
The question that arose on the merits of the case before the
Tribunal was whether on revaluation of the stock in trade of the
Assessee, the Assessing Officer was justified in making an addition
of Rs.6.01 crores.
An identical issue had arisen in the case of the Assessee,
though in respect of a different amount for the assessment year
1985-86. In respect of that assessment year, the Assessing Officer
made an addition, but that was set aside by the Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) by a detailed order dated 29th October, 1990.
Aggrieved by the order passed by the Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals), the Revenue preferred an appeal which was
heard and dismissed by the Tribunal on 31st January, 2001 being
Appeal No. 873/Del/1991 relevant for the assessment year 1985-86.
The Tribunal did not give its own reasons while disposing of
the appeal of the Revenue but relied upon the basis and reasons

ITA 854/2007

page 2 of 5

given by the Commissioner, which it found to be sound and
convincing, so as not to warrant any interference with the order
passed by the Commissioner.
When the same issue arose in the present assessment year
1992-93, the Assessing Officer again took a view which was not
favourable to the Assessee with the result that the Assessee
preferred an appeal before the Commissioner, but by an order dated
10th March, 1995 the Commissioner dismissed the appeal of the
Assessee.
Being aggrieved, the Assessee preferred an appeal before the
Tribunal and one of the points urged by the Assessee was that since
the issue raised in 1985-86 was identical, the order passed by the
Tribunal in respect of that year should be followed by the Tribunal
in this year also. The Tribunal considered that contention in
paragraphs 30 to 32 of its order and rejected it on three grounds:
firstly, that on the earlier occasion the Commissioner had taken into
consideration an amendment to Section 45(3) of the Act which came
into force from 1st April, 1988 which was, therefore, not applicable in
respect of the assessment year 1985-86; secondly, that some of the

ITA 854/2007

page 3 of 5

decisions cited before the Tribunal in the present matter were not
cited on the earlier occasion; thirdly, that the issue raised was
“sensitive” and was not deliberated upon by the Tribunal on the
earlier occasion. On this basis, the Tribunal declined to follow the
order passed in respect of the assessment year 1985-86.
It is now well settled that when one Bench of the Tribunal
takes a view, then another Bench of the Tribunal cannot pass a
contrary order but must, if it disagrees with that view, have the
conflict resolved by referring the matter to a larger Bench. This is
not only a matter of judicial propriety but also a matter of judicial
discipline.
In Union of India v. Shri P.D. Sharma & Ors., 2004 III AD
(DELHI) 131, a Division Bench of this Court observed as follows:“It is now trite law that a Coordinate Bench of the
Tribunal cannot take a view contrary to a view
expressed by earlier Bench. It is bound by the judgment
of the Coordinate Bench rendered earlier. In case it
differs from the decision of the earlier Bench, the only
course open to it to is to refer the matter to a Larger
Bench.”
In Sundarjas Kanyalal Bhatija & Ors. v. Collector, Thane,
(1989) 3 SCC 396, the Supreme Court held as follows:

ITA 854/2007

page 4 of 5

“The judicial decorum and legal propriety demand that
where a learned Single Judge or a Division Bench does
not agree with the decision of bench of co-ordinate
jurisdiction, the matter shall be referred to a larger
bench. It is a subversion of judicial process not to
follow this procedure.” (emphasis supplied)
In arriving at this conclusion, the Supreme Court relied upon
two of its earlier decisions, namely, Mahadeolal Kanodia v.
Administrator General of West Bengal, AIR 1960 SC 936 and Lala
Shri Bhagwan v. Ram Chand, AIR 1965 SC 1767.
Under these circumstances, we answer the question in the
negative and remit the matter to the Tribunal for a fresh
consideration in accordance with law.
