BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.
The petitioner is the proprietor of Delta Electronics which manufactures
Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL). The petitioner is aggrieved by the fact that
the manufacture of CFL) requires mandatory certification under Section 14 of
the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as the BIS
Act). The Bureau of Indian Standards has specified Indian Standard IS:15111
in respect of Self Ballasted lamps for general lighting services. These are the
lamps which the petitioner manufactures and sells. Part-1 of IS:15111 pertains
to safety requirements. Part-2 of the said IS:15111 pertains to performance
WPC1343/2007

Page No.1 of 13

requirements. The petitioner has no issue with part-1 which relates to safety
requirements. The petitioner is only aggrieved by the fact that in paragraph
13.2 of Part-2 of IS:15111, the average life of the lamps has been specified as
not less then 6000 hours. According to the petitioner, this is arbitrary and
requires to be struck off the said standard.

2.

In this context, the petitioner has, inter alia, prayed that the notification

dated 22.08.2005 issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry requiring
mandatory certification under Section 14 of the BIS Act, be struck down
insofar as it relates to Self Ballasted (with internal choke) CFLs as per
IS:15111(Part 1 and 2). The petitioner has also prayed that the specification of
6000 hours life time under the said IS is arbitrary and should be removed from
the said Indian Standards. The petitioner has also prayed that BIS standards be
revised so as to bring it in harmony with the international standards specified by
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) which is a worldwide
organization for standardization comprising of National Electrotechnical
Commissions.

3.

The petitioner contends that part-1 of IS:15111 is based on the IEC

Standard specified in 60968 with regard to safety requirements. Similarly, part2 of IS:15111 is based on IEC Standard 60969 in respect of performance
requirements. Paragraph 13 of Part-2 of IS:15111 reads as under:WPC1343/2007

Page No.2 of 13

“13 LIFE
13.1 The life to 50 per cent failures (average life)
measured on `n' lamps shall be not less than the rates life to
50 percent failures.
(`n' is declared by the manufacturer or the responsible
vendor, but shall be a minimum of 10 lamps.)
13.2 The average life shall not be less than 6000 h.”
The corresponding paragraph in the IEC 60696 is as under :“10 Life
The life to 50% failure (average life) measured on “n”
lamps shall be not less that the rated life to 50% failures.
(“n” is declared by the manufacturer or responsible vendor,
but shall be minimum of 20 lamps)”
4.

Comparing the two provisions, it was contended on behalf of the

petitioner that the international standard does not specify any minimum
average life whereas the Indian standard specifies the minimum average life of
6000 hours by virtue of paragraph 13.2 of IS:15111 (Part-2). It was contended
that since the Indian standard is admittedly based upon the International
standard prescribed by IEC, the requirement of a minimum average life of
6000 hours is not in consonance with the International standard and, therefore,
ought to be removed from the Indian standard. Referring to the foreword in
Part-2 of IS:15111, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the
said Indian Standard (Part-2) was prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards
after the draft finalised by Electric Lamps and their Auxiliaries Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Electro-technical Division Council.

WPC1343/2007

Page No.3 of 13

Furthermore, the standard was based on IEC 60969 (1988) “Self Ballasted
Lamps for General Lighting Service Performance Requirements” issued by the
IEC with certain modifications. It was contended that the modification did not
include the prescription of an average life of 6000 hours.

5.

The petitioner submitted that the requirement of a high average life does

not, in any way, affect the safety or the performance of the lamp. According to
the petitioner, if a lamp is rated for 3000 hours and it meets the 50% failure
rate then it would be equally good, performance-wise, as a lamp which is rated
for 6000 hours and which also has a 50% failure rate as prescribed under
paragraph 13.1 of the IS: 15111 (part-2) He submitted that the cost and price
of a CFL is proportionate to its average life. The lower the average life, the
lower the cost and, the higher the average life, the higher the cost.

By

stipulating a minimum average life of 6000 hours entails that lamps below that
rating cannot be manufactured and sold. It also means that cheaper lamps
having lower life ratings would not be available. It was submitted in this
context that a CFL with a 6000 hours rating would be priced at approximately
Rs 120 per lamp whereas a CFL with a lower average life rating could sell as
low as Rs 20 per lamp.

Insofar as the consumption of electricity was

concerned, there would be no difference because the CFL having an average
life of 6000 hours or more would also consume 7 watts as would a CFL having
an average life of, say, 3000 hours. It was also pointed out by the learned
WPC1343/2007

Page No.4 of 13

counsel for the petitioner that normally a filament type bulb costs around Rs
10/- and its life is around 1000 hours . The power used is 25 watts and the light
output is 200 lumens. On the other hand, a low cost CFL costing about Rs
20/- would have an average life of 3000 hours use only 7 watts of power.
Therefore, there is clear conservation of energy in the case of a low cost CFL
compared with a normal filament bulb. If the restriction of having minimum
average life of 6000 hours is imposed, it would mean that the low cost CFL
would not be available to the poor and middle class consumer inasmuch the
CFLs having an average life of 6000 hours or more would, in the minimum,
cost Rs 120/- per lamp. This is the argument that has been advanced on behalf
of the petitioner to justify its stand that the imposition of a minimum average
life of 6000 hours in the Indian Standards is unreasonable and arbitrary and
does not, in any way, better serve the requirements of energy conservation.

6.

It was contended by the learned counsel for the Union of India that

initially a notification dated 17.02.2003 had been issued. By virtue of the
notification, the Central Government, in exercise of the powers conferred
under Section 14 of the BIS Act and after consulting the Bureau of Indian
Standards, had notified the Electrical Wires, Cables, Appliances and Protection
Devices and Accessories (Quality Control) Order, 2003 (hereinafter referred to
as the “Control Order 2003”). By virtue of the said Control Order, 2003 there
was a prohibition regarding manufacture, storage, sale, land distribution etc in
WPC1343/2007

Page No.5 of 13

respect of electrical wires, cables, appliances, protection devices and
accessories which do not conform to the specified Standards and do not bear
the Standard mark of the Bureau on obtaining certification marks license. The
expression electrical wires, cables, appliances, protection devices and
accessories was defined in the Control Order, 2003 to mean items specified in
column (2) of the Schedule. Serial Nos 8 and 9 of the Schedule pertain to self
ballasted lamps for general lighting services IS:15111 (part 1 and part 2)
respectively. Various representations were made from CFL Manufacturer's
Association as it was felt that the standards prescribed for average life i.e.,
6000 hours could not be tested within the prescribed period of six months
allowed under the Control Order, 2003. Pursuant thereto, Items at serial Nos 8
and 9 pertaining to CFLs were deleted from the Control Order, 2003.
According to the learned counsel for the Union of India, this was done with the
understanding that the position would be reconsidered after 12 months so that
the industry got sufficient time to establish the test procedure required for
compliance with the standards.

It is on reappraisal and after giving due

consideration to the time required for the implementation of the

Control

Order, 2003, that the CFLs were again included for mandatory BIS marking by
virtue of the issuance of the notification dated 22.08.2005 which the petitioner
has impugned herein. It was also pointed out by the learned counsel for the
Union of India that the notification dated 22.08.2005 re-introduced serial Nos
8 and 9 in the Control Order, 2003 but the same was not to come into effect
WPC1343/2007

Page No.6 of 13

immediately and by virtue of the notification itself it was to come into force
after 18 months from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette. The
same was published on 22.08.2005 itself and, therefore, it would have become
effective on or about 22.02.2007.

7.

In the context of the aforesaid facts, it was submitted on behalf of the

Union of India that the petitioner, who had established his factory in 2003,
knew very well about the Standards. He was well aware of the initial Control
Order, 2003. He was also aware of the withdrawal of Serial Nos 8 and 9
which pertained to CFLs and also the reintroduction by virtue of the
amendment brought out on 22.08.2005. But the petitioner did not take any
steps nor did he move any representation. Nor did the petitioner come to this
court on the issuance of the notification dated 22.08.2005 which he is now
impugning. The petitioner waited for the entire 18 months period and filed the
writ petition a couple of days prior to the expiry of that period.

The

notification was to become effective on 22.02.2007 and the writ petition was
filed on 20.02.2007. It was, therefore, contended that apart from the fact that
the petition had no merit, the conduct of the petitioner also disentitled him to
any relief.

8.

On behalf of the respondent No.4 (Bureau of Indian Standards), Mr Jos

Chiramel submitted that the standards were prescribed, inter alia, for
WPC1343/2007

Page No.7 of 13

eliminating sub-standard Chinese imports from the Indian market. He made
detailed submissions with regard to IS:15111. I need not to go into those
details because of the view that I am about to take in this matter. Mr Chiramel
referred to the affidavit filed on behalf of the BIS to indicate that the European
Union has prescribed a minimum lamp life of 6000 hours for CFL.

He

submitted that other countries have also prescribed minimum standards. For
example, Hong Kong has prescribed 8000 hours, Chinese Taipei has
prescribed 8000 hours, Sri Lanka has prescribed 8000 hours. Therefore, the
petitioner's allegation that the minimum life time of 6000 hours is arbitrary, is
baseless. It was submitted by Mr Chiramel that the crux of the contention
canvassed by the petitioner was that the low costs CFL being allegedly
manufactured and sold by them as also the standard CFL with 6000 hours
rating were equally energy efficient and, therefore, there ought to be no
restriction on the former. According to him, energy saving was not the only
criterion which was relevant for prescribing a minimum standard.

He

submitted that though the incandescent bulbs which had served the world for
more than two centuries consume more energy and are being gradually
replaced with CFLs, the waste disposal management and environmental
concerns are much graver in the case of CFLs. Referring to the affidavit filed
on behalf of the respondent No.4, he submitted that there are as many as 24
passive electronic components, besides mercury, holophosphate powder, lead
etc used in the manufacture of CFLs which are not biodegradable and pose
WPC1343/2007

Page No.8 of 13

serious environmental hazards.

As compared to this, the only passive

component in incandescent bulbs was a negligent amount of lead used in
soldering. In this context, he submitted that use of lower life CFLs means a
large number of CLFs being used and, therefore, a much larger waste disposal
problem. Use of higher life CFLs means fewer lamps being used leading to
fewer disposals and a lower effect on environment and ecology.

9.

Mr Chiramel also submitted that The Electric Lamps and their

Auxiliaries Sectional Committee (ET-23) of the Bureau is representative of
various interest groups such as large and small scale manufacturers,
associations representing
research

organizations,

such manufacturers, Government departments,
academic

institutions,

consumer

groups

and

associations, bulk government purchasers etc. He submitted that ET-23 was
constantly engaged in the improvement and upgradation of, inter alia,
IS:15111 (Part-1 & Part -2). The said Committee, according to him, meets
regularly and takes suggestions from members for improvement of the Indian
Standards.

10.

Concluding

his

arguments,

Mr

Cheramal

submitted

that

the

specification of standards is not done arbitrarily but is arrived at after several
rounds of consultation with all concerned. Furthermore, the improvement in
the Standards is an ongoing process and ET-23 meets for this purpose from
WPC1343/2007

Page No.9 of 13

time to time. He submitted that these are matters which require expertise and
the Bureau of Indian Standards is the expert body prescribed under the statute
for specifying the Indian Standards for various products.

Therefore, he

requests that this court ought not to interfere in this matter.

11.

The counsel for the respondent No.3 adopted the arguments advanced

by the other respondents. The respondent No.5 (Bureau of Energy Efficiency)
(BEE) filed a short affidavit. The affidavit was sworn by Mr G Pandian who
had been the nominee of BEE on the BIS Sectional Committee known as ET23 dealing with electric lamps and their Auxiliaries. It was contended that the
BEE is a body corporate constituted by the Central Government, Ministry of
Power to implement and enforce measures for efficient use of energy and its
conservation under the Energy Conservation Act, 2001. It is stated in the
affidavit filed on behalf of BEE (respondent No.5) that IS:15111 had been
formulated by ET-23 and B15.

It was further contended that, based on

representations of the Industry Association, a meeting of the ET-23 Committee
which, inter alia, oversees the standards of CFLs, was specifically convened
on 05.03.2007 wherein the issue in question was tabled and is being
considered. A copy of the notice of the meeting of the members of ET-23
dated 23.02.2007 was annexed and marked as annexure R-2 to the affidavit
filed on behalf of the respondent No.5. The said annexure discloses that the
ET-23 Committee is very broad based. It includes manufacturers, consumer
WPC1343/2007

Page No.10 of 13

societies, Government experts and Government bodies dealing in energy
efficiency and research, small scale industries as well as the Small Scales
Lamps and Competent Manufacturer's Association apart from a host of other
organisations. The said annexure also reveals that, in respect of IS:15111
(Part-2) (performance requirements), the industry and industry association had
made representations to the Director General BIS regarding review of the life
test requirement in the standard and that the same was under consideration of
ET-23. It was submitted by respondent No.5 that in the light of the pending
representation before ET-23, the writ petition is premature and may be
dismissed.

13.

From the above narration of facts and the stand taken by each of the

parties, one thing that is clear is that the specification contained in an Indian
Standards is a technical matter which requires specialised expertise.

The

Bureau of Indian Standards has been given the job by the BIS Act to carry out
this function. It has based the standard in question on IEC 60968 and 60969
but it has thought it proper to bring in certain modifications including the
modification of the average life requirement of 6000 hours. The arguments of
the learned counsel for the petitioner may appear attractive from the point of
view of a poor consumer but this has to be seen in the overall context of
environmental concerns and protection of ecology.

There may be other

technical and scientific reasons which are not apparent at the moment and
WPC1343/2007

Page No.11 of 13

which have not been referred to by the counsel for the parties both in support
and against the fixation of a minimum average life of 6000 hours for CFLs.
But, in my view it would not be appropriate to interfere with this decision at
this stage by passing any direction in this writ petition. This is so because of
three reasons. The first being that the petitioner knew about all the changes that
have been brought about and neither made any representation to any of the
authorities concerned nor approached this court for a long time.

The

notification was issued on 22.08.2005 and was to become operative after 18
months of its publication. The petitioner waited till the fag end of the 18
months period and filed the present writ petition just two days before the
notification was to become effective. Secondly, and more importantly, the
question of specifications in an Indian Standard is essentially a technical one.
Courts do not have the experts to examine such technical issues and it is best
left to experts unless some blatant irregularity or perversity is pointed out. In
the present case, I find that there is no element of arbitrariness. There may be
scope for debate on the issue but that does not enable this court to strike down
the specification or a requirement under the Indian Standard merely because
more views and one may be possible. Before such an action can be taken by
this court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution,
something more needs to be pointed out. That is not the case here. Thirdly,
the very issue which the petitioner is agitating before this court is, as indicated
by the respondents, under review by the ET-23 committee. It would, therefore,
WPC1343/2007

Page No.12 of 13

be appropriate that the point of view of the petitioner is also placed before that
Committee and it would be for them to suggest any changes if at all.
With these observations, this writ petition is dismissed.
No costs.
