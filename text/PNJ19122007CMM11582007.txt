7.

The applications have been dismissed. Detailed

reasons are in the order dated 16.5.2007 dismissing application
page 4 of 8

which was filed in Suit No.62/2005. In the other suit, by an
order of even date it has been recorded that for the reasons
contained in the order dated 16.5.2007 in Suit No.62/2005 the
application was being dismissed.
8.

The requirement of law while framing issues is as

per Order 14 Rule 1 CPC. The requirement is that where
material proposition of fact or law formed by a party is denied
by the other, issues arise.
9.

The 2 agreements to sell dated 26.5.2004 and

29.5.2004 pertain to 300 sq. yards of land each comprised in
Khasra No.81/154 and 81/155, Village Bakauli. The purchaser is
the same but sellers are different.

Material terms of the 2

agreements are near identical. They require sellers to obtain
the necessary permissions to effect the sale. There is clause in
the 2 agreements that in case of default twice the earnest
money

would be paid by way of damages.

Both of them

contain clauses that the buyer would be entitled to enforce the
contract if there is a dispute.

Disputes surfaced. Suits for

specific performance were filed. Alternatively, damages were
claimed.
10.

Defences were taken near identically alleging that

the agreements were not enforceable.

Defences were taken

that the claims were barred by limitation. Defences were taken
page 5 of 8

that sale permissions were not required. Defences were taken
that the plaintiff was not ready and willing to perform his
obligations. It was specifically pleaded that time was of the
essence of the contract.

It was also a defence taken in the

written statement that in view of clause-6 of the agreement to
sell the suit for specific performance was not maintainable.
11.

On the defences taken issue pertaining to the

maintainability

of

the

suit

relating

to

clause-6

of

the

agreements to sell certainly arises for consideration. Further,
issue pertaining to whether time was of the essence of the
contract also require to be settled for the reason the ordinary
presumption in law relating to sale of immovable property is
that time is not of the essence of the contract. Further, in the
teeth of the language of the agreements to sell namely sale
permissions would be obtained by the sellers, since there was
a denial in the written statement that any sale permission was
required, an issue had to be struck.
12.

Further, since law requires a plaintiff to allege and

prove that at all material times plaintiff was ready and willing to
perform his obligation under the contract an issue to said effect
had to be framed.
13.

Because alternative prayer for damages was made

in the plaint on the ground that since clause relating to specific
page 6 of 8

performance is discretionary, should the court not exercise the
discretion in favour of the plaintiff who may otherwise prove
the case, in said eventuality damages should be awarded.
Thus, an issue had to be struck on the alternative claim for the
reason the defendants denied liability to pay any damages.
14.

Needless to state interest payable on the damages,

if any, also require to be decided and thus require an
appropriate issue to be framed.
15.

The issues which were settled in the 2 suits do not

bring out the controversy between parties.
16.

The learned Trial Judge was thus wholly unjustified in

dismissing the 2 applications filed by the plaintiff.
17.

Indeed, the issues which were proposed by the

plaintiff in both the suits require to

be

framed

and

additionally framed as prayed for.
18.

I dispose of the 2 petitions directing that in

supercession of the issues which were framed in the 2 suits on
18.1.2006 and as noted above, the issues would be framed/reframed/additionally settled as proposed in the application
under Order 14 Rule 5 in each suit.
19.

The trial would take place with reference to the re-

casted issues as afore-directed to be framed.
20.

Petitions stand disposed of.
