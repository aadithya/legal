1.

The present suit has been filed by the plaintiff alleging violation of its

proprietary rights in the trade mark and trade name Kamdhenu by the
defendant by dishonest intention and infringement of this registered mark.
The suit has been filed by M/s Kamdhenu Ispat Ltd., a company registered
under the Companies Act, 1956 through Shri Arvind Gupta, its company
CS (OS) No.1069/2005

Page No.1

secretary who is stated to be its authorised official by resolution of the
Board of Directors. The plaintiff has clarified that it is using the trade mark
and trade name Kamdhenu since the year 1991. The plaintiff has asserted to
be enjoying an established reputation in the market in relation to its goods
by this trade mark and trade name in respect of which it has conducted
extensive promotional activities as well. The plaintiff has alleged in the
plaint that its application for registration of trade mark Kamdhenu was
pending in certain categories.

The plaintiff has contended that it also

employs a unique lettering style and colour combination in respect of the
trade mark which is its original artistic work within the meaning of the
Indian Copyright Act, 1957 and as such, the plaintiff is the owner and
proprietor of the same as well.
2.

The suit has been necessitated as the plaintiff came to know of

activities of the defendants through the industrial directory “Thomas
Register of Indian Manufacturers, 2004” wherein the factum of the
defendant’s engagement in manufacturing and marketing of steel and
stainless steel fastners under the trade mark and trade name Kamdhenu
Industrial Service became known to it. It has been submitted that the goods
of the defendant are the same or in any case are cognate goods as those of
CS (OS) No.1069/2005

Page No.2

the plaintiff and its trade mark and trade name was identical to that of the
plaintiff. Even the get up, make up and artistic manner of the trade mark as
adopted by the defendant was a colourable imitation and deceptively similar
to that of the plaintiff, establishing the deliberate act of dishonest imitation
on the part of the defendant.
3.

In these circumstances, bearing in mind the resemblance between the

trade mark and trade name of the plaintiff and the defendant, the present suit
has been filed seeking the following reliefs:“(i) For decree for permanent injunction restraining the
defendants by themselves and through their directors,
partners,
servants,
agents,
assigns,
successors,
representatives, distributors and all other acting for and on
behalf from manufacturing, marketing, selling offering for
sale, advertising or displaying directly or indirectly or using
or dealing in any mode or manner in Steel and Stainless
Steel fasteners or goods of same/similar/allied/cognate
descriptions and nature under the impugned Trade
Mark/Trade

KAMDHENU/KAMDHENU
INDUSTRIAL SERVICE or any other Trade Mark/Trade
Name identical with or deceptively similar thereto in
relation
to
impugned
goods
and
goods
of
same/similar/allied/cognate description or from doing any
other acts or deeds amounting to or resulting in:(a)

Infringement of the plaintiffs registered trade mark

(b) Passing off and violation of the Plaintiff's common
law rights in their trade mark KAMDHENU
(ANNEXURE P-1)
CS (OS) No.1069/2005

Page No.3

(c)

Passing off and violating the Plaintiff's common law
rights in their trade name M/s Kamdhenu Ispat Ltd.

(ii) Restrain the defendants from disposing of or dealing with
its assets including its shops and premises including at
Panbaug, Chakla, Andheri Kurla Road, Andheri (E) –
400099, Mumbai and such other assets as may be brought
to the knowledge of this Hon'ble Court during the course of
the proceedings and on its ascertainment by the Plaintiff, as
the Plaintiff is not aware of the same, as per Section
135(2)(c) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 as it would
adversely effect the Plaintiff's ability to recover costs and
accounts of profits.
(iii) For an order of rendition of accounts of the defendants by
their aforesaid impugned trade activities and a decree to the
Plaintiff on the amount so ascertained.
(iv) For an order for delivery up of all the impugned finished
and unfinished goods bearing the trade mark
KAMDHENU including poly packs, cartons, packing
material, carry bags, sticker, blocks, dies or any other
incriminating material including display boards and sign
boards and trade literature to the plaintiff for the purpose of
destructions/erasure.”
4.

The defendant was duly served with the summons of the suit and

entered appearance through counsel on 16th January, 2006. However, no
written statement was filed and there was also no appearance for the
defendant thereafter on the several dates when the matter was listed. There
are also two communications from the defendants dated 2nd January, 2006 as
well as 8th January, 2006 on record which show that the defendant was duly

CS (OS) No.1069/2005

Page No.4

served and was aware of the pendency of the suit.

As there was no

appearance and no defence to the suit, by an order dated 29th August, 2006,
the defendant was directed to be proceeded ex parte. The plaintiff was also
directed to file its evidence by way of affidavit and it has filed the affidavit
of Shri Arvind Gupta in support of its case.
5.

From a perusal of the evidence placed by the plaintiff on record, the

afore-noticed facts have been duly established on record. The plaintiff has
established that it is using the trade mark and trade name Kamdhenu bona
fide and in the course of its business since the year 1991. The business
carried on by the plaintiff is extensive and various categories of goods of
the plaintiff bearing the trade mark Kamdhenu are being distributed all over
the country. The plaintiff has placed before this court its sales figures since
the year 1995 till 2004. The same reflects an increase from Rs.7,84,09,004
in 1995-1996 to Rs.75,90,29,372.00 in the year 2003-2004. The plaintiff
has also placed before this court the copies of the various advertisements
and distribution literatures, hoardings etc. placed by it in different
publications and different places promoting sales and distributions of its
goods.
6.

At the time of filing of the suit, the trade mark Kamdhenu was

CS (OS) No.1069/2005

Page No.5

registered in favour of the plaintiff in class 06 in the Fourth Schedule of the
Trade Marks Act, 1991 under registration number 717214 which certificate
has been proved on record as Exh. P-1. The plaintiff has pointed out in the
plaint and its affidavit by way of evidence that various applications for
registration were pending for completion of formalities. However, during
the pendency of the suit, more than 25 applications of the plaintiff for the
trade mark Kamdhenu have been registered in different classes. The details
of the registration of these applications require to be noticed and read thus:S.No.

The lettering style and colour combination adopted by the plaintiff in

respect of its trade mark Kamdhenu is registered under the Copyright Act,
1957 and as such, the plaintiff is the owner and has exclusive proprietary
rights therein under the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1957.
8.

The defendant has adopted the trade name Kamdhenu Industrial

Service which is identical to the trade mark and trade name of the plaintiff
which would certainly result in creating confusion and deception in the
minds of the public who would carry a belief that the business of the
defendant is associated with that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has also
established that the adoption of such trade mark and trade name by the
defendant is subsequent and without the knowledge, permission or consent

CS (OS) No.1069/2005

Page No.8

of the plaintiff and that the same is dishonest, mala fide and fraudulent.
Certainly, by these acts which the plaintiff has complained of, the defendant
is infringing the legal, exclusive and proprietary rights of the plaintiff in the
trade mark and the trade name. These actions of the defendant are also
causing dilution of the plaintiff's established goodwill and reputation in the
market.
9.

There is no dispute to the averments of the plaintiff or the evidence

placed by it before this court. The plaintiff has placed reliance on the
principles laid down by this court in 2004 (28) PTC 121 (SC) entitled
Midas Hygiene Industries P. Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Sudhir Bhatia & Ors. and
AIR 1978 Delhi 250 entitled Century Traders Vs. Roshal Lal Daggar &
Co. and Others which apply to the facts of the instant case.
10.

In view of the foregoing discussion, the plaintiff has certainly

established entitlement to protection of its trade mark and trade name from
such dishonest adoption and use by the defendant and a judgment in its
favour.
11.

Accordingly, I hereby pass a decree for permanent prohibitory

injunction in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant restraining the
defendant, by themselves and through their directors, partners, servants,
CS (OS) No.1069/2005

agents, assigns, successors, representatives, distributors and all others acting
for and on their behalf from manufacturing, marketing, selling, offering for

Plaintiff's common law rights in their trade mark KAMDHENU and trade
name M/s Kamdhenu Ispat Ltd.
12.

There is no material before this court with regard to the sales of the

defendant etc. Consequently, the prayer for a decree for rendition of the
accounts is hereby declined.
The plaintiff shall be entitled to the costs of the suit.
