PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
Since common questions arise for consideration in the 6

1.

abovementioned petitions filed under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India, they are being disposed of by a common
order.
2.

Facts in brief, pertaining to the 6 petitions are that a

company named M/s. Birla Cotton Spinning and Weaving Mills
Ltd. filed eviction petitions invoking Section 14(1)(i) and
Section 22 of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 alleging that
the premises in question were allotted to the respondent
(predecessor-in-interest of some respondents) for residential
purposes as a service tenant exclusively by virtue of their
being in the service and employment of the said company.
3.

That it was a term of allotment that within 4 days of

superannuation

or

cessation

of

employment,

vacant

possession would be re-delivered to the company. That, in
spite of cessation of employment, vacant possession was not
handed over.
4.

It was further alleged that by and under a scheme of

arrangement sanctioned by Hon'ble Mr.Justice H.L.Anand of

CM(M) No.64/2005

Page No.3 of 15

this Court, the entire assets of M/s. Birla Cotton Spinning and
Weaving Mills Ltd. stood transferred to M/s. Texmaco Ltd. and
therefore said company was the successor-in-interest of M/s.
Birla Cotton Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd.
5.

The petitions were finally pressed under Section 14(1)(i)

for the reason due to orders passed by the Supreme Court,
manufacturing operations had to be closed down by the
company

and

therefore

obviously,

requirement

of

the

premises for employees of the company, a ground available
under Section 22, ceased to exist.
6.

After recording evidence, learned Addl. Rent Controller

allowed the eviction petitions which are a subject matter of
CM(M) 64/2005 and CM(M) 92/2005.

The eviction petitions

which are subject matter of the other 4 CM(Ms) were
dismissed.
7.

Appeals filed by the respondents against whom eviction

orders were passed were dismissed by the learned Addl. Rent
Control Tribunal. The 4 appeals filed by the company against
the 4 dismissal orders have been allowed by the learned Rent
Control Tribunal.
8.

Under-noted is the data pertaining to the date of the

The defence set up in all the petitions was that

allotment was not due to the allottee being an employee of
M/s. Birla Cotton Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd.

That the

allottee was a tenant independent of his status as employee
of the company.

That the eviction petitions were not filed

under a proper authorisation. That M/s. Texmaco Ltd. was not
successor-in-interest

of

M/s. Birla

Cotton Spinning

and

Weaving Mills Ltd.
10.

Whereas all defences were rejected in the eviction

petitions which are a subject matter of CM(M) 64/2005 and
CM(M) 92/2005 and as a consequence, the learned Addl. Rent
Controller passed an order of ejectment, which order has
been upheld in appeal by the tribunal, eviction petitions filed
CM(M) No.64/2005

Page No.5 of 15

which are subject matter of CM(M) Nos. 65/2005, 67/2005,
69/2005 and 101/2005 were dismissed by the learned ARC,
inter alia, on the ground that authority of the person who had
instituted the petition for eviction was not proved.
11.

Said authorisation was held as proved in the other 2

eviction petitions which were allowed and are a subject
matter of CM(M) 64/2005, CM(M) 92/2005.
12.

The eviction petitions which were dismissed were filed

under the signatures of one Shri P.C.Chhajer.
13.

A perusal of the decisions in the various cases where the

learned Addl. Rent Controller has held that authority of Shri
P.C.Chhajer was not established to file the eviction petitions
shows that the learned trial court has been influenced by the
fact that the Executive Director of the company who had
executed the power of attorney in favour of Shri P.C.Chajjer
pursuant to the board resolution dated 10.7.1978 whereunder
it was resolved that Shri P.C.Chajjer be authorised to file the
eviction petitions and sign the petition and verify the
pleadings

CM(M) No.64/2005

Page No.6 of 15

was held that recourse could not be had to Section 85 of the
Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
14.

Copy of the notarised power of attorney was otherwise

accepted as a document. It was assigned an exhibit mark in
various eviction petitions.
15.

The learned appellate court has taken a contrary view,

being that where a document is executed before and
authenticated by a notary public, production of the duly
authenticated and notarised document raises a presumption
that the document was duly executed and authenticated.
16.

In

the

eviction

petitions

which

were

allowed,

respondents (in the eviction petition) laid a challenge to the
authority of the person concerned who had instituted the
petition as also signed and verified the pleadings. Defence
was held as not established.
17.

As noted above, the said appeals were dismissed by the

learned tribunal.
18.

I may note, a fact not disputed by the learned counsel

for the petitioners that M/s. Birla Cotton Spinning and
Weaving Mills Ltd. was the perpetual lessee of a parcel of
land on which a Spinning and Weaving Mill stood erected. On

CM(M) No.64/2005

Page No.7 of 15

the land allotted to the company, residential quarters were
built for the staff.

It is also not in dispute that either the

petitioners (before me) or the predecessor-in-interest of the
petitioners were employees of the said mill.
19.

In WP(C) No.4677/1985 M.C.Mehta Vs. Union of India the

Supreme Court directed closure of the mill on account of the
reason that Master Plan for Delhi did not permit the industrial
user in question. The mill was required to shift out of Delhi.
Under orders of the Supreme court 68% of the land had to be
handed over to DDA and the remaining 32% vested in the
company.
20.

It is also not in dispute that employment of the said

persons was duly established at the trial with the testimony of
the employees of the company as also production of written
record being attendance/paysheets of the employees in
question.
21.

The same evidenced deduction of a monthly rent.

22.

The scheme of transfer of M/s. Birla Cotton Spinning and

Weaving Mills Ltd. and M/s. Texmaco Ltd. as approved by
Hon'ble Mr.Justice H.L.Anand of this court was duly proved.
Certified copies of the scheme of arrangement and orders

CM(M) No.64/2005

Page No.8 of 15

passed by this court were proved and were given exhibit
marks.
23.

A two fold contention was urged before me. Firstly, that

the structures in question fell on the part of the land which
had to be handed over to DDA and therefore Texmaco
Limited was not the owner thereof and hence could not
maintain the eviction petition. Second point urged was that
since the Executive Director of the company who executed
the power of attorney in favour of the employee who had
signed and verified the petition as also instituted the eviction
petition was not produced as a witness, therefore the power
of attorney which was relied upon as constituting the
authorisation remained an unproved document.
24.

On the first issue raised, suffice would it be to note that

eviction as finally pressed was under Section 14(1)(i) of the
Delhi Rent Control Act, 1959. The legislative provision is that
where the premises were let out to a tenant for use as a
residence

by

reason

of

his

being

in

the

service

or

employment of the landlord, service or employment ceasing,
entitles the landlord to a decree for ejectment.
25.

Ownership is not relevant for the reason a person may

CM(M) No.64/2005

Page No.9 of 15

be a landlord without being an owner.
26.

A company may take a premises on a 30 year lease

from the owner with a permission to induct its employee as a
tenant/sub-tenant. Such an employee to whom the said
permission is allotted would be a tenant under his company
and the allotment would be pursuant to his employment.
Such an allottee cannot resist the eviction, if otherwise
grounds are made out.
27.

Even otherwise, under the directions of the Supreme

court, 68% land has to be handed over to DDA for being
maintained as open areas. DDA has not become the owner of
the said land. Ownership would vest in DDA when possession
is handed over.
28.

It would be the obligation of the company to evict its

tenants including heirs of the tenants and hand over
possession to DDA.
29.

But, I rest my decision on firmer grounds. A tenant who

accepts a person as his landlord is estopped from questioning
the title of his landlord.
30.

The petitioners are therefore estopped from questioning

the title of M/s. Texmaco Ltd. for the reason either they or

CM(M) No.64/2005

Page No.10 of 15

their predecessor-in-interest were inducted as a tenant by the
predecessor-in-interest of M/s. Texmaco Ltd.
31.

On the second issue raised, namely, authority of the

person who has signed and instituted the eviction petition,
the controversy between the parties stood resolved by the
Tribunal in the context of Section 85 of the Indian Evidence
Act, 1872. The same reads as under :-

32.

"85. Presumption as to powers-of-attorney.The Court shall presume that every document
purporting to be a power-of-attoreny, and to have
been executed before, and authenticated by, a
Notary Public, or any Court,
Judge, Magistrate,
(Indian) Counsul or Vice-Consul, or representative of
the (Central Government), was so executed and
authenticated.
It is not in dispute that the notarised power of attorney

in favour of the person who had signed and verified the
eviction petition as also who had filed the same was produced
at the trial and copy thereof was assigned an exhibit mark.
The only question which arises for consideration is, whether in
absence of the notary public being produced as a witness or
the executant thereof being not produced as a witness to
prove the same, was the document proved as per law.
33.

Authentication by a notary public is a solemn act

performed by the notary public whose duty is to ensure that

CM(M) No.64/2005

Page No.11 of 15

the executant is the person before him and is identified to his
satisfaction. Once a document is authenticated by a notary
public, it will be presumed that the document was duly
executed and was in order. The use of the expression 'shall
presume' shows that the section is mandatory and the court
has to presume that all necessary requirements for the
proper execution of the power of attorney were duly fulfilled
before the notary public. As observed in AIR 1984 363 M/s.
E.C. & E. Co. Ltd. Vs. M/s. J.E. Works, if 2 conditions are
satisfied, firstly the power of attorney being executed before
a notary public and secondly it being authenticated by a
notary public, a presumption would arise under Section 85
about the executant of the power of attorney.
34.

Onus would thus lie on the opposite party to prove to

the contrary.
35.

It is well settled that authentication would mean more

than mere execution. Where proof of authentication surfaces,
benefit of Section 85 has to be granted.
36.

No negative evidence has been brought on record, none

has been shown to me by the petitioners.
37.

The purpose of Section 85 of the Evidence Act appears

CM(M) No.64/2005

Page No.12 of 15

to be that a duly executed and authenticated power of
attorney can be proved under Section 85 without undue
expenses to be incurred by producing the executant thereof
or the original board resolution.
38.

The reason is obvious. Banks, insurance companies and

multinational companies empower officers to institute and file
suits on their behalf. Large number of suits are filed by these
organisations.
executant

of

If the original board resolution or the
the

power

of

attorney

has

to

submit

itself/himself before the court as a sine qua non to prove the
power of attorney, practical difficulties would arise and unnecessary expenses would be incurred by the organisations
to prove the document in the afore-noted manner.
39.

I am in full agreement with the view taken by the

learned Rent Control Tribunal that the authority of the person
who had signed and verified the petition as also instituted the
eviction petition stood duly proved by means of production of
the authenticated and notarised power of attorney bearing
the seal of the notary public.
40.

Decision of the Supreme Court reported as AIR 1997 SC

3 Union Bank of India Vs. Naresh Kumar is additionally relied

CM(M) No.64/2005

Page No.13 of 15

upon by me. The said decision states that where a suit has
been filed on behalf of a corporate body and is duly
prosecuted by the person who had filed the suit, a
presumption would arise that the person concerned was
authorised to do so.
41.

A lame duck argument was sought to be urged, being

that pursuant to the scheme of arrangment sanctioned by this
court, it was directed that the scheme of arrangement has
been sent to the Registrar of Companies who will issue the
necessary certificate regarding thereto. Since there was no
proof that the scheme of arrangement was sent to the
Registrar of Companies and no certificate issued by him was
proved, it cannot be held that M/s. Texmaco Ltd. was the
successor-in-interest

of

M/s. Birla

Cotton Spinning

and

Weaving Mills Ltd.
42.

I am afraid, this issue was not raised before the Trial

Judge or the appellate court. It relates to a question of fact. I
cannot permit the petitioners to raise the said issue before
me for the first time.
43.

I find no merits in the petitions.

44.

The same are dismissed.
