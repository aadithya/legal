PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

It is unfortunate that for 14 years the instant appeal

has remained in the record room of this Court as an After
Notice Miscellaneous Matter.

No question of law has been

framed till date.
2.

Whether or not a question of law requires to be

framed?
3.

The answer would depend whether a case is made

out to frame one.
RSA No.81/94

4.

In my opinion, no substantial question of law or for

that matter even a question of law requires to be framed, as
none arises.
5.

Appellant was the plaintiff. His suit for possession

and damages was dismissed by the learned Trial Judge vide
judgment and decree dated 23.9.1992. First appeal being RCA
No.14/1992 was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated
19.2.1994.
6.

Briefly stated, appellant's case was that vide sale

deed dated 20.6.1971, Ex. P-1, he had purchased 200 sq.yds.
of land comprised in Khasra No.115 of Village Shakurpur Khas,
Illaqa Shahdara, Delhi from its owners S/Shri Revti Prasad,
Balwant, Chander Bhan, Onkar and Ram Sharan.

That the

registered sale deed described the property as under:East :
West :
South:
North:
7.

Gali.
Field of Inderjeet.
Land of vendors.
Land of vendors.

It was further alleged that the area came under

illegal and unauthorized colonization and when other houses
were constructed municipal numbers were assigned and
number assigned to plaintiff's plot was 573-B.
8.

The defendant did not dispute the tile document of

the plaintiff but stated that the suit land was not the one which

RSA No.81/94

page 2 of 7

belonged to the plaintiff. Defendant stated that his wife has
purchased the same.

The defendant stated that at site the

property was bounded, not in the manner as stated in the
plaint, but as under:West
East
North
South
9.

:
:
:
:

House No.573-A
House No.S-582
House of Smt.Shanti Devi
Lane

The defendant did not lead any evidence pertaining

to the title document of his wife but proved site plan Ex.DW-1/1
showing the boundaries of the land as it existed at site.
10.

Both Courts below have non suited the appellant

holding that the land at site does not conform to the
description in the sale deed of the plaintiff but conforms to
Ex.DW-1/1, meaning thereby it has been held that the suit land
is not the one to which sale deed Ex.PW-1 relates to.
11.

Reason given by the Courts below is that when the

defendant proved Ex.DW-1/1, no suggest was given to him that
the land at site does not conform to Ex.DW-1/1. Further, it has
been held (para 10 of the judgment of the Appellate Court) that
in cross-examination the plaintiff himself could not give the
description of his property.
12.

Another reason given by the learned Appellate Judge

is that in the grounds of appeal it was urged:-

RSA No.81/94

page 3 of 7

“That the property in question is located in
unauthorized regularized colony upon the
agricultural land to which development has been
carried out in phases came up in haphazard
manner.”
(I have in verbatim copied the ground urged
before the First Appellate Court as recorded in
para 9 of the decision with its imperfect
grammatical syntax.)
13.

Learned Appellate Judge has noted that during

arguments it was urged by the appellant that in these kinds of
colonies sale deeds are normally executed without specific
numbers and that the property conveyed are usually described
by boundaries as was also done in the present case by the
vendor.

The Appellate Court has noted that no such plea

appears to have been raised before the learned Trial Judge.
The learned Appellate Judge has also noted that there is no
evidence on record as to when was the colony regularized and
when were municipal numbers allotted.
14.

In the instant appeal, picking on the observations of

the learned Appellate Judge in para 11 where it has been
recorded that the plaintiff has failed to discharge the onus, it is
sought to be urged that where evidence is led, onus loses
significance and the rule of best evidence applies. Taking the
argument a step forward it is urged that the defendant did not
prove the sale deed of his wife and therefore the only

RSA No.81/94

page 4 of 7

inevitable conclusion to be drawn was that the land at site
conforms and relates to the sale deed relied upon and proved
by the appellant as Ex.P-1.
15.

I am afraid, the plaintiff has to stand on his own

feet.
16.

That apart, even applying the rule of preponderance

of probabilities it has to be noted that at site house in question
is surrounded by 3 houses on the west, east and north. A lane
exists towards the south of the land. But, the sale deed, Ex.P1, in favour of the plaintiff gives a totally different picture. The
lane is shown on the eastern side of the plot forming subject
matter of the sale deed. The western, southern and northern
sides are shown as bounded by the field of one Inderjeet Singh
and the land of the vendors.
17.

To compound the appellant's problem, the appellant

did not produce the owners of the adjoining houses as his
witnesses nor produced or summoned his vendor to prove
what was sold by the vendor to him.
18.

The case has hinged on documentary evidence and

the statements of the witnesses.

I find no infirmity in the

appreciation of evidence by the learned Appellate Judge as well
as by the First Appellate Judge.
19.

The hiatus between the physical boundaries of the

RSA No.81/94

page 5 of 7

site which physically exist and as disclosed in the sale deed
Ex.P-1 is indeed fatal to the case of the appellant.
20.

Before concluding I must record that nearly 50% of

the Regular Second Appeals in this Court relate to possessory
rights in unauthorized colonies.

The voice of the Courts

requiring unauthorized colonies to be regularized as per a
regularization plan assumes significance because in Court
litigation, which indeed is a lawyer's delight to litigate on such
properties but is a judge's despair for the reason no credible
evidence comes on record to ascertain the position at site visa-vis the tile documents of the parties. The instant case could
be an illustration of this malice. It is possible that when the
plaintiff purchased the land vide Ex.P-1, being an undeveloped
area the owners of the land described it as per the sale deed.
But the same lost all meaning when actual development took
place. What happened when. No body knows. But, in a Court
of Law credibility and admissible evidence is what can be
looked into by a Judge.
21.

Further, to test purity of an evidence suspect

impure, it needs to be reacted with evidence credibility and
purity whereof is not in doubt.
22.

In relation to land in an unauthorized colony this

exercise may become fairly simple if there is an authenticated
RSA No.81/94

page 6 of 7

layout plan of the colony.

But where there is none, it is a

virtually impossible task to co-relate the boundaries of lands
forming subject matter of a sale deed and in particular when
these

sale

relate

to

the

initial

period

of

unauthorized

colonization because what ultimately comes up may not
conform to what was conceived of.
23.

It is not a judicial over-reach when Courts direct the

executive to conduct the affairs relating to town and country
planning as required by law.

It is not only substantive law

which is in issue but even rules of evidence on which
substantive rights are determined which get affected when
there is no logic, except appeasement, in an executive policy
decision.
24.

In unauthorized colonization more than often than

not the Courts lands up protecting the possession of the person
who is ultimately proved to be in possession because relatable
to title, trustworthy and credible evidence linking the site to
the title document seldom surfaces.
25.

The

appeal

is

dismissed

without

framing

any

question of law, as none arises.
26.

No costs.
