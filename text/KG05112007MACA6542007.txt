KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
*
The present appeal is preferred against the
award of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal dated
23.8.2007.
The facts in a nutshell are:On 19.6.98, Shri Om Prakash, aged 60 years,
was

travelling

on

a

two

wheeler

scooter

bearing

registration No. DL 6SD 4740, which at the relevant time
was being driven by Shri Joginder Makhija, was hit by a
vehicle bearing registration No. DL1Y 4991, which was
being driven in the most rash and negligent manner by
Shri Devender Singh. Shri Om Prakash suffered fractures
in his right leg for which he was operated upon and
remained hospitalized for a month. The claim petition was
filed on 28.7.1998 before MACT and award was made on
23.8.2007. Aggrieved with the said award, present appeal
is preferred by the appellant claimant.
Shri S.C. Singhal, counsel for the appellant
MAC APP No.654/2007

contends that

the Tribunal has not granted adequate

compensation towards pecuniary damages on account of
the expenses incurred by the appellant towards medical
treatment.
Another contention raised by the counsel for the
appellant is that due to the injury sustained by the
appellant, he had closed his work for an indefinite period
and due to which he has suffered immense losses.
Counsel

for

the

appellant

has

attention to the evidence of the appellant

drawn

my

who entered

the witness box as PW-1. In his deposition the appellant
stated that

he remained in hospital for a period of one

month and till the date of his deposition he had not fully
recovered from the injuries sustained by him in the
accident.

He also stated that his mind was still not

working properly and he forgot things very quickly. The
appellant also deposed that after the accident his shop
was totally closed as there was no one to look after the
MAC APP No.654/2007

page 3 of 8

shop.
Based on the evidence of appellant, counsel for
the appellant contends that once the appellant has stated
in his

deposition that his shop was totally closed then the

Tribunal ought to have granted compensation not only for
the period from the date of the accident till the said
deposition but also for the future due to the deprivation of
the appellant from his business of gold smith. Counsel for
the appellant contends that there is no cross-examination
of the said deposition of the appellant.
I have heard counsel for the appellant at
considerable length and have perused the records.
In para 17 of the judgment the Tribunal has
dealt with the first contention as raised by the counsel for
the appellant.

The Tribunal has observed that the

appellant has duly proved on record the bills of medicines
in the sum of Rs.19,560/- besides the payments made by
the appellant

for artificial limb in the sum of Rs.9856/-.

MAC APP No.654/2007

page 4 of 8

The Tribunal has also awarded a sum of Rs.15,000/- on
account of special diet and conveyance and thus in all, the
total compensation under the head of medicines, medical
treatment, special diet and conveyance granted by the
Tribunal is Rs.44,416/-.
Perusal of the said para evidently shows that the
Tribunal has allowed the payment towards the bills of
medicines as produced by the appellant.

For

claiming

pecuniary damages the claimant has to place on record
the necessary proofs in the shape of documents and bills
so that the compensation can be assessed under the head
of pecuniary damages.

Since the appellant himself has

failed to place on record any other medical bill of the
amount in excess of amount of Rs.19560/- the contention
of the counsel for the appellant that the Tribunal should
have

awarded

more

amount

towards

the

medical

expenses, cannot be accepted.
In this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has given
MAC APP No.654/2007

page 5 of 8

following observations in the judgment reported in (2001)
8 SCC 197 entitled Lata Wadhwa vs State of Bihar:“In examining the question of
damages for personal injury, it is
axiomatic that pecuniary and nonpecuniary heads of damages are
required to be taken into account. In
case of pecuniary damages, loss of
earning or earning capacity, medical,
hospital and nursing expenses, the loss
of matrimonial prospects, if proved, are
required to be considered. In the case
of non-pecuniary losses, loss of
expectation of life, loss of amenities or
capacity for enjoying life, loss or
impairment of physiological functions,
impairment or loss of anatomical
structures or body tissues, pain and
suffering and mental suffering are to be
considered. But for arriving at a
particular figure on each of the
aforesaid heads, the claimant is dutybound to produce relevant materials,
on the basis of which, a determination
could be made, as to what would be the
best compensation.”
I, therefore, do not find any infirmity
order

of

the

Tribunal

concerning

the

in the

amount

of

compensation under the said head.
As regards the second contention of the counsel
MAC APP No.654/2007

page 6 of 8

for the appellant that

the appellant remained without

work for an indefinite period, the Tribunal in para 18 of the
award has observed that the appellant did not state in his
deposition

as to

for how much period he was without

work on account of the injuries sustained by him. Even in
the absence of any categorical evidence produced by the
appellant still the Tribunal

has taken into consideration

six months period and has awarded a sum of Rs.18,000/towards the loss of income. Perusal of the examination of
the appellant also shows that although he stated that his
shop was totally closed after the accident but he failed to
state for how long the said shop remained closed.
In the absence of any evidence disclosing
duration of the closure of the shop, the Tribunal could not
have decided the period of closure of the shop itself.
I do not find any infirmity in the impugned
award.
Dismissed.
