BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.
These three petitions are taken up together as they involve common
issues. WP(C) 1895/2007 has been filed by Tirath Ram Shah Hospital. WP(C)
11957-63/2006 has been filed by Dr Anuj Tyagi and other Doctors who are
DNB1 trainees at Tirath Ram Shah Hospital. WP(C) 1714/2007 has been filed
by Jaipur Golden Hospital. The respondent in each of these petitions is the
National Board of Examinations.

2.

The main issue pertains to the amount of stipend that is to be paid

to DNB trainees by hospitals which are accredited to the National Board of
Examinations (hereinafter referred to as “the NBE”) insofar as the various
specialties / super-specialties are concerned. The case for the hospitals is that
the circular issued on 08.05.2006, which is impugned by them, is based upon
the judgments / orders of a learned Single Judge of this Court passed on
23.11.2005 and 06.01.2006 and that these judgments / orders have been set
aside by a Division Bench of this court on 31.3.2006. By the order dated
06.01.2006, the learned Single Judge of this court had directed that the stipend
1 Diplomate of National Board
WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 2 of 21

paid by accredited hospitals / institutions to the DNB trainees ought to be Rs
19,000/- per month.

According to Mr Singla, the learned Senior counsel

appearing on behalf of the hospitals, this direction given by the learned Single
Judge has been set aside by the Division Bench on 31.03.2006 in an appeal
from that order. Therefore, the NBE ought not to insist upon the hospitals
paying the stipend at the rate of Rs.19,000/- per month as a condition for
renewing the accreditation accorded to the

hospitals.

The letters dated

05.02.2007 and 28.02.2007 issued to the Jaipur Golden Hospital and Tirath
Ram Shah Hospital (respectively) by the NBE indicating the disapproval for
renewal of accreditation have also been challenged. The ground taken in the
letters of February, 2007 issued to both the hospitals is that the said hospitals
are not complying with the guidelines of the NBE with respect to the payment
of stipend to DNB trainees.

3.

According to Mr Manmohan, the learned Senior counsel appearing

on behalf of the NBE, the guidelines prescribed the payment of Rs.19,000/- per
month stipend to the DNB trainees. He submits that this stipend has been
determined not just on the basis of the decision of the learned Single Judge
dated 06.01.2006 but also on the basis of an independent exercise carried out by
the NBE by constituting a Committee and by inviting suggestions / consulting
with a sample of accredited Institutions / Hospitals. It was also pointed out by
Mr Manmohan that the DNB qualification which is awarded by the NBE has
WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 3 of 21

been treated to be equivalent to the

MD / MS degrees not only by the

Government of India but also by the Supreme Court in the decision rendered on
02.05.2001 in the case of Kidwai Memorial Institute of Onchology & Anr v
State of Karnataka & Ors passed in Civil Appeal Nos.3520/2001 &
3521/2001.

4.

The entire issue, therefore, is — what is the effect of the Division

Bench decision upon the stipend of Rs.19,000/- per month fixed for DNB
trainees? To consider the rival contentions of the parties, it would be necessary
to give a resume of the facts leading up to the said decision. A petition had
been filed before this court by Dr Vishal Sehgal with regard to the issue of
payment of stipend to him as he was a DNB trainee. The hospital concerned in
that case was Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital. The grievance of Dr Vishal
Sehgal was that he was not being paid a stipend though initially he had been
paid a stipend but the same had been discontinued. After examining the entire
issue in depth, a learned Single Judge of this court came to the conclusion that
Dr Vishal Sehgal was entitled to receive stipend from Deen Dayal Upadhyay
Hospital yet the amount “cannot be same as is being paid to the MD / MS
students who are working as Junior Residents”. The court further observed that
what the amount should be is not within the domain of this court. The quantum
has to be worked out by the Hospital in consultation with the NBE. The court,
however, observed that all that can be said is that the amount ought not to be
WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 4 of 21

less than Rs.10,000/- per month. This decision of the learned Single Judge is
reported as Dr Vishal Sehgal & Ors v Secretary (Health) : 116 (2005) DLT
493.

5.

It may be pertinent to note that, as informed by Mr Manmohan, the

NBE was not a party to those proceedings and, therefore, it could not be
pointed out that DNB qualification was equivalent to the MD / MS
qualification which position is now settled by the Government of India Circular
issued on 01.06.2006 as well as the Supreme Court decision in Kidwai
Memorial Institute of Onchology referred to above.

6.

After the decision in Dr. Vishal Sehgal (supra), an order was

passed by the Secretary (Health) Government of NCT of Delhi on 31.07.2003
with regard to payment of stipend to students pursuing the DNB courses in the
hospitals under the control of the Government of NCT of Delhi. That order had
reference to the said judgment in Dr Vishal Sehgal (supra) and prescribed that
the students, who are undergoing the DNB course in the hospitals under the
control of the Government of NCT of Delhi, shall be paid a stipend at the rate
of Rs.10,000/- per month. On 10.2.2004 the NBE had given accreditation to
the Tirath Ram Shah Hospital for the specialty of Paediatrics w.e.f. January,
2004 to December, 2006. Paragraph 2(c) of the said accreditation stipulated
that the DNB trainees be paid stipend equivalent to the sum paid to other PG
WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

trainees (MD / MS) in their respective States. On 20.12.2004 the NBE issued
revised guidelines for accreditation to DNB courses. The stipulation with
regard to the remuneration / stipend was mentioned in para 9 of the Revised
Minimum Criteria for DNB courses which reads as under :“9.

Remuneration / Stipend

Accredited hospitals should pay each trainee (both Post
MBBS & Post Diploma) a minimum monthly stipend not less than
the following rates. It is also desirable that the Hospital provides
accommodation to their trainees in addition to their stipend :Programme
Broad
Specialities

First Year
Rs. 8,000/-

Second Year
Rs. 9,000/-

Super Specialities Rs. 10,000/- Rs. 11,000/-

Third Year
Rs. 10,000/Rs. 12,000/-

An undertaking to pay all DNB trainees at the
above mentioned rates should be submitted to NBE while
applying for accreditation.”
7.

In the present cases, which are concerned with super specialties, if

one looks at the table given above, the stipend that is to be paid for super
specialties is Rs. 10,000/- in the first year, Rs. 11,000/- in the second year and
Rs. 12,000/- for the third year. This revised guideline with regard to stipends
was incorporated in the fresh accreditation given to Tirath Ram Shah Hospital
on 22.12.2005 with regard to the specialty of obstetrics and gynaecology for the
period of January, 2006 to December, 2008. The said accreditation contained
condition 2(f) which reads as under :
“f)

Stipend / Remuneration : that, the hospital will pay each
trainee (both Post MBBS & Post Diploma) a minimum

WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 6 of 21

monthly stipend not less than the following rates. It is also
desirable that the Hospital provides accommodation to their
trainees in addition to their stipend. NBE has no objection
to the payment of a sum exceeding the amount stipulated,
according to the stature of the institution and work load of
the trainees :Programme

First year

Second year

Third year

Broad
Specialities

Rs. 8,000/-

Rs. 9,000/-

Rs. 10,000/-

Super
Specialities

Rs. 10,000/

Rs. 11,000/-

Rs. 12,000/-

A reading of this condition indicates that while the minimum rates were
prescribed by the NBE, it was also indicated that the NBE had no objection to
the payment of a sum exceeding the amount stipulated, according to the stature
of the institution and work load of the trainee. What is clear is that the stipends
prescribed by the NBE were the minimum stipends to be paid by accredited
institutions such as the Tirath Ram Shah Hospital.

8.

On 06.01.2006 the learned Single Judge of this court had decided

the writ petitions being WP(C) 19903/2004 and other connected matters titled
Dr Shiv Shanker Shahi & Ors v Government of N.C.T. Of Delhi & Ors. The
order passed in those writ petitions reads as under :“O R D E R
06.01.2005
In the judgment of Madan B. Lokur dated
December 18, 2002, it had been directed that DNB
students should not be paid less than Rs.10,000/- per
month.
WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 7 of 21

It needs to be clarified that these students
have already passed their MBBS degree. Junior Doctors
presently are being paid a stipend of Rs.17,000/- per
month. Post-graduate Doctors are presently receiving a
stipend of Rs.20,121/- per month. The University Grants
Commission has taken a positive approach in the matter.
It has conveyed to the Court by letter dated 5.1.2005 that
it will honour the decision of the Court or of any other
Authority for payment of enhanced stipend to DNB
students.
Keeping the stipends already being paid in view,
I direct that a stipend of Rs.19,000/- per month be paid to the
petitioners and other DNB students similarly placed.
Thereafter whenever stipends are increased, the present ratio
be maintained. Stipends be paid with effect from 1.1.2006.
Writ petitions stand disposed of in these terms,
with no order as to costs.
VIKRAMAJIT SEN, J”

It appears that appeals were preferred against the said decision by the Principal
Secretary of the Government of NCT of Delhi. The same were disposed of on
the first hearing itself by a Division Bench of this Court by an order / judgment
dated 31.3.2006. It is interesting to note that no appearance was entered on
behalf of the NBE because, as per Mr Manmohan, no advance notice had been
given for it. The said Division Bench decision referred to the Government of
NCT of Delhi order dated 31.7.2003 which were to DNB courses in the
hospitals under the Government of NCT of Delhi.

The requirement,

thereunder, was for payment of a stipend of Rs.10,000/- per month. Referring to
the said Government order dated 31.7.2003, the Division Bench held that the
writ petitioners were entitled to stipends @ Rs.10,000/- per month and that the
WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 8 of 21

stipend fixed by the learned Single Judge of Rs.19,000/- per month cannot be
sustained. The reasoning given by the Division Bench was that the fixation of
pay / grant of stipend ought not to have been done by the Court as these are
executive functions and that, ordinarily, it would not be appropriate for a court
to fix the same.

The Division Bench while setting aside the direction with

regard to the payment of stipend at the rate of Rs.19,000/- fixed by the learned
Single Judge, at the same time felt that the stipend of Rs.10,000/- per month
appeared to be inadequate and directed the appellants to consider the prayer of
the writ petitioners for a higher stipend afresh since the cost of living had gone
up considerably. Unfortunately, as pointed out by Mr Manmohan, the NBE was
not present on the date on which the said decision was rendered by the Division
Bench. Had advance notice gone to them, the NBE would have been in a
position to point out to the Division Bench the Memorandum of Association
and Rules and Regulations of the NBE and in particular Object 3(xxv) which
reads as under:“(xxv)

To institute offers and grants, prizes, awards,
scholarships, research grants and stipends in
furtherance of the objects of the Board.”

This shows that the NBE is the authority which fixes the stipends in furtherance
of its other objects.

9.

Returning to the facts of the present cases, on 04.05.2006, Tirath

Ram Shah Hospital applied for renewal of accreditation for its DNB course of
WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 9 of 21

the Paediatrics department for the period subsequent to December, 2006.
Shortly thereafter, on 08.05.2006, the impugned circular, indicating the policy
decision of the NBE, was issued. The circular reads as under :
“To :

Director / DNB Coordinators,
Of
Accredited Hospitals / Institutions

Sub :

Policy decisions – Stipend to DNB Trainees

Sir,
I am directed to convey to you that, in pursuance to the
judgment delivered by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi on 23rd
November, 2005 and 6th January, 2006, the competent authority
has decided the following :1.

Payment of stipend to DNB trainees is mandatory for all
NBE accredited institutions.

2.
the

DNB trainees shall be paid monthly stipend equivalent to
sum paid to MD / MS / DM / MCh trainees by respective
State Govts., in institutions owned by them.

3.
The trainee(s) shall be paid monthly stipend as per
Clause
92) above or as mentioned in the table below,
whichever is
HIGHER:Programme

First year

Second year

Third year

Broad Specialties Rs.10,000/- Rs.11,000/-

Rs.12,000/-

Super Specialties Rs.14,000/- Rs.15,000/-

Rs.16,000/-

4.

The DNB candidates in accredited institutions in Delhi shall be
paid monthly stipend of a minimum Rs.19,000/- or the stipend
paid by the Government of India / Govt of NCT of Delhi to their
MD / MS / DM / MCh trainees in their respective year of
studies, whichever is HIGHER.

5.

In strict compliance to the judgment delivered by the Hon'ble
High Court of Delhi, on 6th January, 2006, DNB trainee(s) in
Delhi shall be paid monthly stipend as per Clause 94) above
w.e.f. 1st January, 2006.

WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 10 of 21

6.

Notwithstanding the above, stipend to DNB trainees shall
always be in equivalence to the sum paid by respective State
Govts. as they revise them from time to time, or, as mentioned
in Clause (3) and (4), whichever is HIGHER.
All accredited institutions are requested to implement these
revised guidelines on stipend with IMMEDIATE EFFECT.
This letter supersedes all earlier communications from NBE on
stipend.”

A reading of the above circular would indicate that DNB candidates, in
accredited Institutions in Delhi, were required to be paid a monthly stipend of a
minimum Rs.19,000/- or the stipend paid by the Government of India

/

Government of NCT of Delhi to their MD / MS / MCh trainees in their
respective year of studies, whichever was higher.

10.

A plain reading of the circular would also give the impression that

the same had been issued pursuant to the decision of a learned Single Judge of
this court of 06.01.2006 fixing the stipend of Rs.19,000/-. According to the
petitioners (Hospitals) such a policy decision ought not to have been taken
because the order dated 06.01.2006 of the learned Single Judge had been set
aside by the Division Bench.

However, according to the learned counsel

appearing for the DNB trainees and for the NBE, the setting aside of the
learned Single Judge's order dated 06.01.2006 did not affect the power of the
NBE to fix a stipend. According to Mr Manmohan, although the circular refers
to the orders dated 23.11.2005 and 06.01.2006, the fixation of a sum of
Rs.19,000/- was actually based on an independent study done by a three

WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 11 of 21

member committee constituted by the NBE prior to the issuance of the circular
and in consultation with some of the accredited Institutions / hospitals. This,
according to Mr Manmohan, is explained by a letter dated 21.06.2006 written
by the NBE to the hospitals. It clarifies the position in detail. The letter dated
21.06.2006 which was issued to the hospitals clearly indicates that the NBE had
constituted a three member committee to study and recommend the payment of
stipend to DNB candidates. The three member committee had recommended
that payment of stipend to DNB candidates was a must and it should also be
commensurate with the status of a qualified doctor. The letter of 21.06.2006
has reference to the decision in Dr Vishal Sehgal &Ors (supra) of the learned
Single Judge as also the decision of the learned Single Judge in the case of Shiv
Shankar Shahi (supra) and its reversal by the Division Bench in LPA 52829/2006 on 31.3.2006. It was noted in the letter dated 21.06.2006 that the
Division Bench at the first hearing of the Latters Patent Appeal on 31.3.2006
had disposed of the same. The Division Bench had set aside the order dated
06.01.2006 passed by the learned Single Judge. It was contended in the letter
dated 21.06.2006 that a bare perusal of the judgment dated 31.03.2006 passed
by the Division Bench indicates that the judgment of the Single Judge had been
set aside purely on the ground that the learned Single Judge had fixed the
stipend at Rs 19,000/- per month and that at the same time there was no fault
found with the policy of payment of stipend to DNB candidates and that the
question of grant of stipends should be considered afresh because the stipend of
WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 12 of 21

Rs.10,000/- per month, as it appeared to the Division Bench, was inadequate. It
was further stated in the letter dated 21.06.2006 that the NBE, while
formulating the stipend policy as afore-stated, had considered all the relevant
factors including various judgments passed by the court and have only
thereafter issued the policy guidelines for payment of stipends. The figure of
Rs.19,000/- was accepted by NBE as a monthly stipend to DNB candidates as
the same had emerged during the deliberations and was also a reasonable
amount in the opinion of the NBE and the said amount had also incidentally
matched with the monthly stipend proposed by the major stakeholders. It was
also pointed out in the said letter dated 21.06.2006 that DNB qualifications
have been equated with the MD / MS decree and, therefore, it would not be out
of line to suggest a stipend which is more or less equivalent to the stipend paid
to MD / MS trainees.

11.

Subsequently, there is a letter on record written by Tirath Ram Shah

Hospital on 27.07.2006 with reference to the policy guidelines issued on
08.05.2006 stating that :“As regards the payments of stipend is concerned, please
note that we are not in a position to pay the same at
enhanced rate of Rs.19,000/- as per your guidelines as
contained in your order No. ACC/Policy/Stipend/227 to
702 dated 8th May, 2006.”

page no. 13 of 21

Thereafter, the impugned letters of February were issued by the NBE refusing
further accreditation to the hospitals on the ground of non compliance of the
payment of stipend at the monthly rate of Rs.19,000/- per month as directed in
the circular dated 08.05.2006.

Insofar as the Jaipur Golden Hospital is

concerned, provisional accreditation had been given to the hospital on
24.1.2007 but the same was subsequently withdrawn on 13.02.2007 on the
same ground that the circular of 08.05.2006 was not being complied with by the
said hospitals.

12.

The records of the Stipend Committee, which was constituted by

the NBE, were produced before this Court. There is a letter dated 16.11.2005
on the said file, issued by the Executive Director of the NBE on the subject
“Committee for Recommendations for Payment of Stipend to DNB Trainees”.
The letter indicates that a committee had been constituted for recommendations
of payment of stipend and the constitution of the members of the committee
was also provided in the said letter.

The names of the members of the

committee are not being disclosed on the request made by Mr Manmohan, the
learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the NBE, to protect the interests
of the members of the committee. However, it is sufficient to indicate that a
three member committee comprising of eminent and independent persons, was
constituted.

page no. 14 of 21

13.

The first meeting of the Stipend Committee was held on

30.11.2005.

The minutes of the meeting indicate that the committee was

concerned about the grievances of candidates with regard to the fixation of
stipend.

It also noted that various writ petitions had been filed by the

candidates in various courts in India in respect of stipend issue. This was the
preliminary meeting and the committee members had decided to examine the
files available with the accreditation section of NBE and also to ascertain the
amount of stipend paid by various hospitals to MD/MS/DM/MCh candidates.
Thereafter, the committee met on 27.12.2005. The minutes of the meeting of
that date disclose that the committee members had contacted various hospitals
for taking their inputs for payment of stipend to DNB trainees/ candidates. The
sample-accredited hospitals requested the committee members for not
disclosing their names as that would create bad blood amongst various
accredited institutes. It is for this reason that the committee members thought it
fit not to disclose the names of the sample institutes.
on 27.02.2006.

The committee then met

This meeting was subsequent to the decision of the learned

Single Judge of this Court on 06.01.2006 in the case of Shiv Shankar Shahi
(supra), wherein the learned Single Judge had directed the fixation of stipend
for DNB candidates at Rs.19,000/- per month. The committee took note of the
decision of the learned Single Judge. However, the committee continued with
its own deliberations with regard to fixation of stipend. The next meeting of
the committee was held on 28.03.2006. The committee noted that on the basis
WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 15 of 21

of information received, the DNB trainees in Delhi were being paid stipends as
low as Rs.10,000/- per month in Government Hospitals and as high as
Rs.28,000/- per month in private hospitals. Though the normal range of stipend
being paid in Delhi was between Rs.17,000/- to Rs.21,000/-. It was pointed out
that the DNB candidates have to spend a substantial amount of the stipend
money towards purchase of academic material as these facilities are not
available in all hospitals. It is also noted that the DNB candidates are normally
in the age group of 25 years to 30 years, having families of their own to support
besides incurring expenses on the academics and that their cost of living also
goes up with their round-the-clock strenuous duties. After going through the
circulars and guidelines of the NBE, the committee members came to the
conclusion that the NBE was also in favour of payment of stipends to the DNB
candidates. It was also indicated that the committee members wanted to seek
certain clarifications on legal issues and that the committee would come to a
final conclusion subsequently.

14.

The next and final meeting of the Stipend Committee took place on

21.04.2006.

In the meanwhile, the decision of the Division Bench dated

31.03.2006, setting aside the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge,
had come. The committee took note of the said decision of the Division Bench
and actively considered the scope and effect of the order passed by the Division
Bench.

Since the committee was concerned about the legal effect on the

WP (C) 1895/2007, WP(C) 1714/2007 & WP(C) 11957-63/2006

page no. 16 of 21

working of the present committee, the opinion of their advocate was taken.
Their advocate, Mr Rakesh Gosain, informed the committee members, after
referring to all the orders and judgments and also Clause 3 (xxv) of the
Objectives of the NBE, that the power of fixation of stipend for DNB
candidates is only with the NBE. The said advocate also pointed out that the
existence of power of the NBE to fix the stipends, was not contradicted by any
of the judgments. Accordingly, the committee members took the view that
Rs.19,000/- per month would be an appropriate amount for stipend to DNB
candidates in Delhi. Keeping in mind the normal range of Rs.17,000/- to Rs.21,000/that was being paid to such candidates by accredited institutions in Delhi, this figure
of Rs.19,000/- per month was arrived at by taking the average of Rs.17,000/-

and Rs.21,000/-. A separate criteria for fixation of payment of stipend for
institutions outside Delhi was given, with which we are not concerned in the
present petitions. The committee also took note of the fact that the DNB
qualification is equivalent to MD/MS/DM/MCh in all respects and, therefore,
the unanimous recommendation of the committee for payment of monthly
stipend to DNB candidates in Delhi was as under:“The DNB candidates in accredited institutions in

This unanimous recommendation was forwarded to the NBE and

since they were also concerned about the legal effect of the various decisions
passed by the learned Single Judges and the Division Bench, a legal opinion of
the advocate was sought. The legal opinion was given and the same is on
record of the file maintained by the NBE.

Being satisfied with the legal

opinion obtained from the advocate as well as the recommendation received
from the Stipend Committee, the circular dated 08.05.2006 was issued, which,
in essence, was the culmination of the entire proceedings before the Stipend
Committee.

16.

Having examined the records available with the NBE, it is apparent

that the stipend of Rs.19,000/- per month for DNB trainees has been fixed not
merely on the basis of the decision of the learned Single Judge dated
06.01.2006 but on the basis of an independent and separate enquiry and
investigation conducted by the committee itself.

Even the Division Bench

decision of 31.03.2006, which set aside the order of the learned Single Judge,
made it clear that, ordinarily, it is not for the court to fix the amount of stipend
but for the executive. In this case, it is clear that the power of fixing the stipend
vests with the NBE. This aspect has not been negated by the Division Bench
while passing the order dated 31.03.2006 and this aspect was clearly confirmed
by the learned Single Judge in the Dr. Vishal Sehgal case (supra) in paragraph
56 of the said decision by observing that the quantum has to be worked out by

the hospital in consultation with the NBE. In that case, the hospital was Deen
Dayal Upadhyay Hospital. There is no doubt that the exact quantum that is to
be paid by way of stipend may be worked out by the accredited institution/
hospital in consultation with the NBE. However, it is open to the NBE to fix a
minimum amount of stipend to be paid by any of the accredited institutions. In
the present case, the circular had merely prescribed the minimum amount of
stipend and it is always open to the accredited institutions to fix a higher
amount of stipend in consultation with the NBE. In my view, that is the manner
in which the decision of the learned Single Judge in the case of Dr. Vishal
Sehgal (supra) has to be construed.

17.

It is therefore clear that the impugned circular dated 08.05.2006,

although it ostensibly gives an indication that it was passed merely on the basis
of the decision of the learned Single Judge passed on 06.01.2006, has actually
been issued after deliberations of the Stipend Committee, which has come to an
independent conclusion, based on logical reasoning and sound premises. The
reasoning being that the average stipend being paid in Delhi for DNB
candidates was between Rs.17,000/- to Rs.21,000/- and the committee thought
it fit to fix the average of these two limits, which came to Rs.19,000/- per
month. It is another matter that this amount has coincided with what the
learned Single Judge had recommended / directed by his order dated
06.01.2006.

The Division Bench decision, upsetting this direction of the

page no. 19 of 21

learned Single Judge, did not in any way come in the way of the NBE to
independently fix the amount of Rs.19,000/- per month by way of a stipend.
This is what has been done by the NBE and, therefore, the circular dated
08.05.2006 cannot be faulted. Consequently, the grievance of the petitioner
that accreditation was not being granted for non-compliance with the conditions
of this circular, is also not well founded.

18.

The learned counsel for the hospitals submitted that, in any event,

rules of natural justice ought to have been followed before the circular dated
08.05.2006 was issued. He submitted that the petitioner/hospitals ought to have
also been consulted or heard before the amount was fixed. In the present case,
the committee had gone through with its deliberations starting from 16.11.2005
and ending on 21.04.2006. It has looked into various pieces of information
collected by it and has also taken a sample of the accredited institutions to
arrive at the said decision. Although practical considerations alone cannot be
sufficient to override the requirements of natural justice, it must be seen as to
whether the procedure adopted by the Stipend Committee was reasonable or
not. In my view, the committee has followed a very reasonable approach and
has considered the entire range of stipends, which includes not only those
institutions which were taken in the sample but also others and the committee
has fairly taken the view that the average stipend should be fixed as the

minimum. This has been fixed taking into the interests of the DNB candidates.
I see no infirmity in the procedure adopted by the respondents.

19.

Accordingly, the writ petitions filed by the Jaipur Golden Hospital

and Tirath Ram Hospital are dismissed. Insofar as the writ petition filed on
behalf of the DNB trainees is concerned, I am of the view that their grievances
have been taken care of by the circular dated 08.05.2006 and which ought to be
implemented in letter and spirit.

The parties shall bear their own costs.
