1.

The petitioner joined BSF as a Constable in the year 1967. He was

detailed for one year training for the course of Veterinary Stockman at
Jaipur.

After completing one year’s training, he was appointed as

Stockman in the rank of Head Constable by the BSF vide order dated 8 th
December, 1982 in the pay scale of Rs.225-308. Even though as per the
Fourth Pay Commission, the pay scale for the post of Stockman/Stock
Assistant/Vaccinator/Milk Recorder was prescribed as Rs.975-1540, but
the petitioner was given the pay scale of Rs.950-1400 which was also the
pay scale admissible to the post of Constable.

WP(C) No.18047/2005

2.

On 6th June, 1995, the petitioner was designated as Head Constable

(Compounder Veterinary) and was given the pay scale of Rs.975-1660.
According to the petitioner, both as Stockman and Compounder, the rank
of the petitioner was that of Head Constable and as such there was no
promotion involved. It is also stated by him that even as per the new
Recruitment Rules floated in 2003, Head Constable (Stockman) is not a
feeder post for Head Constable (Compounder Veterinary) and, therefore,
it is contended that both the posts used to be and are still one and the
same post as per Recruitment Rules, 2003 as also that the essential
qualification for recruitment to both the posts is the same.
3.

It is submitted that as per the recommendations of the Fifth Pay

Commission, the Central Government revised the pay scale of both Head
Constable (Stockman) and Head Constable (Compounder Veterinary) as
Rs.4000-6000 but while implementing the aforesaid pay scale, the
possession of two- year certificate course was made mandatory and
those who were not possessing the two-year certificate had been given
the replacement scale of Rs.3200-4900. Since the petitioner was holding
only one-year certificate, he was also given the pay scale of Rs.32004900 as a replacement pay scale.
4.

It is the case of the petitioner that despite waiver of the condition

of two-year certificate course

for

existing

employees

by

the

Department of Animal Husbandry (Government of Delhi), the benefit of
the pay scale of Rs.4000-6000 was not extended to the petitioner
whereas the said pay scale was made admissible to all existing
compounders/stockmen from 1st January, 1996, but the replacement pay

WP(C) No.18047/2005

Page 2 of 10

scale given to the petitioner and other BSF personnel is that of Rs.32004900 with effect from 1st January, 1996 instead of Rs.4000-6000 even
though the petitioner joined as Stockman in 1982 when only one-year
certificate course was in vogue. Thus, it is submitted that, the petitioner
has been discriminated against.
5.

The petitioner thus claims parity in the pay scale by contending

that he should have been granted the pay scale of Rs.4000-6000 with
effect from 1st January, 1996 instead of pay scale of Rs.3200-4900.
6.

It is also submitted that since the petitioner was stagnating in the

post of Head Constable since 1982, he was granted the benefit of
Assured Career Progression Scheme while granting the pay scale of
Rs.5000-8000 with effect from 9th August, 1999. It is pleaded that even
at this time, he was discriminated inasmuch as the Havaldar, Veterinary
of Indo Tibetan Border Police were granted the pay scale of Rs.55009000 vide order dated 3rd April, 2002 with effect from 9th August, 1999. It
is further that the BSF and the ITBP are both Armed Forces of the Union
and the veterinary persons of both the forces perform the same duties
but given different pay scales i.e. (Rs.5500-9000 to ITBP personnel and
Rs.5000-8000 to BSF personnel) which is discriminatory and violative of
the principles of `equal pay for equal work’.

Thus, the petitioner also

claims the pay scale of Rs.5500-9000 since 9th August, 1999 instead of
the pay scale of Rs.5000-8000 from the said date.
7.

The third grievance made by the petitioner is about withdrawal of

the benefit of ACP made admissible to him by conferring the pay scale of
Rs.5000-8000 as ACP with effect from 9th August, 1999 for the reason

WP(C) No.18047/2005

Page 3 of 10

that the said pay scale was admissible to those S.I.s who were
possessing B.Sc degree with biological science and those S.I.s who did
not possess the degree were given replacement of Rs.4500-7000 and for
the persons who were not entitled to the pay scale of Rs.5000-8000 like
the petitioner, a recovery of a certain amount could be made which in
the petitioner’s case was a sum of Rs.82,625/-, out of the gratuity of the
petitioner after he superannuated. The said decision was communicated
to the petitioner vide their letter dated 22nd September, 2004. Further,
the grant of ACP Scheme is also disputed by pleading that the petitioner
was promoted on 6.6.95 when he was granted pay-scale of Rs.975-1660
and thus was not entitled to the benefit of ACP Scale also.
8.

By way of this writ petition, the petitioner has claimed the following

reliefs:“(i) The petitioner be granted pay scale of
Rs.4000-6000 instead of the pay scale of Rs.32004900 with effect from 1st January, 1996 and
further be granted the pay scale of Rs.5500-9000
with effect from 9th August, 1999 instead of
Rs.5000-8000; AND,
(ii)
That the respondents be restrained from
recovering the sum of Rs.82,625/- out of the
gratuity of the petitioner being the benefit of the
enhanced pay scale granted to the petitioner on
the ground of his stagnation in the same pay scale
for number of years and having not been granted
any promotion.”
9.

The respondents, have contested the writ and opposed the prayer

made by the petitioner on the ground that the pay scale of Rs.4000-6000
was not admissible to the petitioner inasmuch as, he was not having the
requisite qualification which were essential for granting the pay scale of
Rs.4000-6000 instead of Rs.3200-4900. It is also stated that since the
WP(C) No.18047/2005

Page 4 of 10

petitioner was not having the required educational qualification which
would have made him admissible to the pay scale of Rs.5000-9000, he
was not entitled to the benefit of ACP Scheme. As regards the pay scale
of Rs.5500-9000, it is submitted that it was a promotional scale which
was in any case not admissible to the petitioner. In relation to the
recovery sought to be effected from the petitioner, it is submitted that
benefit of ACP was granted to the petitioner inadvertently and therefore
there was nothing wrong in effecting recovery of the amount paid to the
petitioner because of a mistake.
10.

We have considered the rival submissions.

A few facts are

apparently clear from the pleadings of the parties which can be
enumerated for the sake of reference are:(a) That the petitioner though joined as Constable in 1967, but was
designated as `Veterinary Stockman’ in the year 1982 after he
completed one year course of `Veterinary Stockman’ from Jaipur but the
pay scale which was made admissible to him even at that time was the
same pay scale which was granted to him at the time of his appointment
as Constable. Thus, at that time, there was no promotion given to the
petitioner.
(b)

Similarly, when on 6th June, 1995, the petitioner was designated as

Head Constable (Compounder Veterinary) and was given the pay scale of
Rs.975-1660 it was nothing else but the same pay scale of which
replacement pay scale was 3200-4900.

Thus, virtually, the petitioner

was not given any promotion and, therefore, he continued stagnating in
the pay scale of Rs.950-1400/975-1660 right from 1982 which both had

WP(C) No.18047/2005

Page 5 of 10

the same replacement pay scale of Rs.3200-4900 as per the Fifth Pay
Commission.
11.

The petitioner was also not entitled to the benefit of the pay scale

of Rs.4000-6000 as a replacement pay scale inasmuch as there is
nothing on record which may go to show that the said pay scale was
made admissible to the counter parts of the petitioner by the BSF.
Merely because the Government of Delhi extended those benefits even
to those persons who were having one-year certificate course later on
though initially the requirement was of two-year certificate course in
addition to other essential qualifications would not give parity to the
petitioner unless the said pay scale was accepted and adopted by the
Central Government even in respect of para-military organizations.
12.

As far as the higher pay scale of Rs.5500-9000 made admissible to

the ITBP personnel is concerned, we do not find that there is any parity in
the case of the petitioner and those who had been made admissible to
the pay scale of 5500-9000 which was, in fact, a promotional scale
whereas according to the petitioner has not been given any promotion so
far. Thus, in these circumstances, we agree with the respondents that
the petitioner is neither entitled to the pay scale of Rs.4000-6000 nor the
pay scale of Rs.5500-9000. Even otherwise the claim of parity of payscale cannot be entertained on the principles of delay and latches in as
much as the claim pertains to the year 1996 and it has been claimed by
way of writ petition only now.
13.

However, we do not find any justification for the respondents to

withdraw the benefit of the ACP Scheme granted to the petitioner
inasmuch as, since 1982, the petitioner was not given any higher pay
WP(C) No.18047/2005
Page 6 of 10

scale or promotion.

Even if the pay scale of Rs.5000-8000 was not

admissible to the persons holding requisite qualification as was being
held by the petitioner, it would still not deprive him of that scale because
that being the higher scale was granted to him at the time of granting
him the benefit of ACP Scheme. The fact that the petitioner was granted
the pay-scale of Rs.5000-8000 as ACP Scheme is also clear from the
letter dated 9.5.2001 which goes to show that there were no promotional
avenues available for the post of HC/Stockman/Lab Tech, having the payscale of 3200-85-4900 and from the order dated 16.1.2003 (Annexure
P12) fixing the pay-scale for Tarif Singh (the petitioner) in the pay scale
of 5000-150-8000 in respect of his earlier pay-scale i.e., 3200-85-4900.

In view of the aforesaid stand of the respondent i.e., pay-scale
which was made admissible to the petitioner by way of Assured Career
Promotion Progression was not admissible to him does not stand to
reason.

Therefore its recovery cannot be sustained that also without

giving him an opportunity of hearing.
14.

We do not find anything on record which might go to show that the

petitioner was ever given any show cause notice or an opportunity of
being heard with regard to the action of the respondents to withdraw the
benefits already granted to the petitioner. At this juncture, we may also
WP(C) No.18047/2005
Page 8 of 10

observe that in number of cases, this Court has set aside such action of
the respondents where the respondents sought to withdraw the benefit
of ACP Scheme.

A reference can be made to the orders passed by a

Division Bench of this Court of which one of us (Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.)
was

a

member

vide

order

dated

3rd

October,

2007

in

WP(C)

No.7280/2007 as well as in WP(C) Nos.5291/2006,11543-52/2005 and
18620-22/2005.
15.

Thus taking all the aforesaid facts into consideration, we hold that

while the petitioner is not entitled to enhanced pay scale as claimed by
him, at the same time, the respondents are also not entitled to recover
the benefit of the ACP granted to him after a period of about 17 years
stagnation in the same pay scale.

Thus, the purported action of the

respondents to deduct the sum of Rs.82,625/- from the gratuity of the
petitioner as per the letter dated 22nd September, 2004 cannot be
sustained and therefore the respondents are liable to refund the amount
already deducted and prohibited from recovery of it any further.
16.

We may also observe that insofar as the Recruitment Rules which

came into being in 2003 is concerned, about which a reference has been
made by the respondents, to deny the benefit of higher pay scale to the
petitioner, it may be said that the said Rules came into being
subsequently and cannot be given effect to retrospectively and as such
those Rules have no applications to the facts of the case.
17.

Thus, a writ of mandamus is issued in favour of the petitioner and

against the respondents directing them (i) not to recover/deduct any
further amount from the gratuity of the petitioner pursuant to their letter
dated 22.9.2004 and (ii) to refund the amount already recovered from
WP(C) No.18047/2005
Page 9 of 10

the petitioner within two months of the passing of this order. No further
relief is granted to the petitioner.
18.

The writ petition stands disposed of accordingly. Parties are left to

bear their own costs.
