To be referred to the Reporter or not?

:

Whether judgment should be reported in Digest?
PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

The above captioned second appeal arises out of the

judgment and decree dated 12.8.1980 passed by the learned
ADJ, Delhi whereby the judgment and decree dated 17.8.1976
passed by the learned Sub-Judge, Delhi was set aside.
2.

Facts necessary to dispose of the present second

appeal are that Delhi Improvement Trust allotted a plot bearing
municipal No.124, Block-8A, Western Extension Area, Karol
Bagh, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the suit property) in
favour of Smt. Vidyawati (hereinafter referred to as the
deceased).

Deceased died on 16.3.1956 leaving behind 3

daughters namely, Mrs.Vimal Kumari Khanna, Mrs.Kamwal
RSA No.229/1980

Page No.1 of 15

Sarin and Dr. Mrs.Compesh Kumari Kapur.
3.

Alleging that it had purchased the suit property from

the deceased vide sale deed dated 27.1.1948 the appellant
filed a suit against aforenoted 3 daughters of the deceased and
DDA, the successor-in-interest of Delhi Improvement Trust. In
the suit inter alia it was prayed as under :i.)

A decree of declaration that the appellant is the absolute

owner of the suit property be granted.
ii.)

A decree of perpetual injunction restraining the 3

daughters of the deceased from claiming any right or interest
in the suit property be granted.
iii.)

A decree of mandatory injunction directing DDA to

execute perputal lease deed in respect of the suit property in
favour of the appellant be granted.
4.

The daughters of the deceased filed a joint written

statement. Defence set up by them in their written statement is
as under :i.)

Suit is not properly valued for purposes of court fees.

ii.)

Suit is barred by virtue of provisions of Section 34 of

Specific Relief Act in as much as appellant should have also
sued for possession of the suit property.
iii.)

Deceased had no right in the suit property for the reason

suit property was purchased benami in name of the deceased
and it was the husband of the deceased Sukh Dayal i.e. their
father who was the real owner of the suit property as he had
RSA No.229/1980

Page No.2 of 15

paid the entire consideration in respect of suit property.
iv.)

Sale deed dated 27.1.1948 purported to have been

executed by the deceased in favour of the appellant is a forged
and fabricated document.
v.)

Lastly defendants placed reliance upon clause-13 of

Terms and Conditions relating to the tender/offer for Lease
which clearly mandated that a transfer will be valid only when
Delhi Improvement Trust executed the perpetual lease deed in
favour of offerer/tenderer and possession of the allotted plot
had been handed over to the tenderer/offerer.
5.

It was pleaded that neither a perpetual lease deed

was executed by Delhi Improvement Trust or DDA in favour of
the deceased nor possession of the suit property was handed
over to her thus deceased had no right to transfer the suit
property.
6.

DDA also filed written statement inter alia averring

that:i.)

Suit is not maintainable for the reason no notice as

required under Section 53(B) of the Delhi Development Act was
served upon DDA.
ii.)

Deceased had no right to transfer the suit property in

view of clause-13 of Terms and Conditions relating to the
tender/offer for Lease.
7.

On the basis of pleadings of the parties, vide order

dated 23.2.1974, the learned Trial Court framed the following
RSA No.229/1980

Page No.3 of 15

preliminary issues:“1. Whether the suit is properly valued for
the purposes of Court-fee and jurisdiction?
OPP

8.

2.
Whether the suit is barred under Section
34 of the Specific Relief Act?”
Vide order dated 26.8.1974 the learned Trial Court

decided the afore-noted preliminary issues in favour of the
appellant and held the suit to be maintainable. Said decision
has become final.
9.

After disposing the preliminary issues vide order

dated 5.11.1974 learned Trial Court framed following 5 issues :“1.

Whether the sale deed dated 27-1-48 is
forged document? OPD

2.

Whether Smt. Satyawati was Benami
holder of the property? OPD

3.

Whether Sh. Krishna Mohan is competent
to sign and verify the plaintiff? OPD
Whether
the
suit
is
barred
by
limitation?OPD
Relief.”

4.
5.
10.

On behalf of plaintiff 5 witnesses namely K.N.Mahal

PW-1, Mr.G.L.Nagpal PW-2, Ram Lal PW-3 and S.N.Pandit PW-4
and S.P.Singh PW-5 were examined.
11.

PW-1 was employed as an Accounts Assistant in the

plaintiff company. He deposed that Mr.Krishan Mohan had the
authority to sign and verify the plaint in question.
12.

PW-2 deposed on the lines of the plaint.

He duly

proved the certified copy of the sale deed dated 27.1.1948 as
Ex.PW-2/1.

Relevant portion of testimony of PW-2 reads as

RSA No.229/1980

Page No.4 of 15

under :“It was 5.6.71 when a letter was written and
prior to that also we had been contacting DDA
for transfer of plots in our favour. I cannot say
from memory as to when a first letter was
written regarding the transfer of plot...............
Que. First time, when you did take up this
matter regarding plot No.124, Block No.8A,
WEA, with DDA.
13.

Ans. I do not remember.”
PW-3 was employed as a Clerk in the Registrar

Office, Delhi. He deposed that sale deed dated 27.1.1948 i.e.
Ex.PW-2/1 is the certified copy of the original sale deed. He
however deposed that he had no personal knowledge about the
execution of original sale deed by the deceased.
14.

PW-4 was the Ex Sub-Registrar, Delhi. He deposed

that he had registered the sale deed dated 27.1.1948 executed
by the deceased in favour of the appellant.
15.
company.

PW-5 was the General attorney of the plaintiff
He deposed that the original sale deed dated

27.1.1948 certified copy of which is Ex.PW-2/1 has been lost
and is not traceable.
16.

No evidence was led from the side of the daughters

of the deceased.
17.

Jai Gopal Gaur, UDC, DDA was examined as D4W1

on behalf of DDA. He deposed that Delhi Improvement Trust
had allotted the suit property in favour of the appellant. That
the deceased had paid entire sale consideration in respect of

RSA No.229/1980

Page No.5 of 15

the suit property. That possession of the suit property was not
handed over to the deceased. That no perpetual lease deed in
respect of the suit property was executed by the Delhi
Improvement Trust or DDA in favour of the deceased. That the
deceased had no right to transfer the suit property unless a
perpetual lease deed in respect of the suit property was
executed in her favour and possession of the suit property was
handed over to her.
18.

D4W1 proved documents namely Letter of Allotment

dated 27.1.1943 as Ex.D-1, a resolution dated 28.1.1943
passed

by

Delhi

Improvement

Trust

as

Ex.D-2

and

correspondence between the parties as Ex.D-3 to Ex. D-21.
19.

Letter

of

Allotment

dated

27.1.1943

Ex.D-1

contained therein Terms and Conditions relating to the
tender/offer for Lease. Clause-13 of the Terms and Conditions
relating to the tender/offer for Lease

on

which reliance has

been placed by the defendants reads as under :-

20.

(13) No transfer of any rights by the
tenderer/offerer will be recognised by the trust
until all the dues in respect of the plot have
been paid by the tenderer/offerer and
possession taken over, and the lease
deed/agreement
for
sale/or
sale
deed
executed and registered by him/her.”
Ex.D-2 records that the suit property was allotted in

favour of the deceased.
21.

I need not note the correspondence between the

parties in detail save and except letter dated 30.8.1943 Ex. D-6

RSA No.229/1980

Page No.6 of 15

issued by Delhi Improvement Trust and addressed to the
deceased which reads as under :“Madam,
I am directed to inform you that your tender of
Rs.18/ 15/- per square yard premium and 2
½% thereof per annum as ground rent subject
to enhancement according to the conditions of
the lease, for perpetual lease hold of plot
No.124, Block No.8-A, W.E. Area Scheme Area
134.03 square yards residential house on the
conditions agreed to by you has been
accepted by the Trust, You are requested
therefore to pay :1.

Rs.2038/3/-

being the balance of the
amount of the premium
due:

2.

Rs.

54/-/-on account of cost of
stamps for the registtration of the lease deed;

3.

Rs.

1/-/-towards the charges for
the preparation of the
lease deed and

4.

Rs.

5/-/-cost of boundary pillars.

Total: 2098/3/Within one month from the date of issue of this
letter.
Please note that failure to comply with it shall
be treated as breach of the conditions of the
tender and your deposit of earnest money will
be liable to be forfeited under the conditions of
the tender of the lease.
No transfer of any rights by the tenderer will
be recognised by the Trust until all the dues in
respect of the plot have been paid by the
tenderer and lease deed executed and
registered and possession taken over by him
or her.

RSA No.229/1980

Page No.7 of 15

Yours faithfully,
sd/For Lands Officer.”
I also note that from the correspondence it is clear

22.

that the entire sale consideration in respect of the suit property
was paid by the deceased.

It is also clear that neither

perpetual lease deed in respect of suit property was executed
in favour of the deceased nor possession of the suit property
was handed over to the deceased.
23.

Another thing which emerges from Ex.D-3 to D-21 is

that daughters of the deceased first time in the year 1965
applied to DDA that the suit property be allotted in their favour
for the reason they are the only surviving legal heirs of the
deceased. Vide 2 letters dated 5.6.1971 Ex. D-19 and Ex.D-20
appellant first time informed DDA and daughter of the
deceased Compesh Kumari that the deceased had transferred
her rights in the suit property in favour of the appellant.
24.

After considering pleadings as also evidence led by

the parties, the version of the appellant found favour with the
trial court. The decision of the trial court can be summarized as
under :i.)

Krishan Mohan was competent to sign and verify the

plaint.
ii.)

The onus to prove that sale deed dated 27.1.1948

Ex.PW2/1

executed between the deceased and appellant was

RSA No.229/1980

Page No.8 of 15

forged

and

fabricated

document

was

upon

the

defendants/respondents which they failed to discharge.
iii.)

The onus to prove that the deceased was a Benami owner

was also upon the defendants which they failed to discharge.
iv.)

Defendants/respondents failed to show as to how suit filed

by the appellant was barred by limitation.
v.)

As regards Clause-13 relied upon the defendants the

learned Trial Court opined as under :-

25.

“Admittedly,
no
document
had
been
executed in favour of deceased Satya Wati by
D.D.A. or its predecessor-in-interest the Delhi
Improvement Trust. Yet I am of the view that
this clause 13 of the tender form does not
bind the present plaintiff who is a bonafide
purchaser of the rights of the deceased Satya
Wati in respect of the plot in question.”
Thus vide judgment and decree dated 17.8.1976 the

learned Trial Court granted the relief prayed for by the
appellant.
26.

Aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated

17.8.1976 passed by the trial court DDA filed an appeal before
the court of learned Additional District Judge, Delhi.
27.

During the pendency of the appeal DDA filed an

application under Order XIV Rule 5 CPC for framing of
additional issues. Additional issues sought to be framed were
that present suit is not maintainable in view of provisions of
Section 53(B) of Delhi Development Act, suit is not valued
properly for purposes of court fees and suit is not maintainable
in its present form.
RSA No.229/1980

Page No.9 of 15

28.

Vide order dated 21.7.1980 the learned appellate

court dismissed the application under Order XIV Rule 5 CPC
filed by DDA.
29.

After considering the case in its entirety, the case

set up by the appellant impressed upon the learned appellate
court. The decision of the appellate court can be summarized
as under:i)

It was incumbent upon the appellant to prove that the

sale deed dated 27.01.48 Ex.PW2/1 is a genuine document and
not a forged and fabricated document. And the appellant failed
to do so.
ii)

In view of clause 13 of the clause-13 of Terms and

Conditions relating to the tender/offer for Lease the deceased
had no right to transfer the suit property till the perpetual lease
deed in respect of the suit property was executed in favour of
the deceased and possession of the suit property was handed
over to the deceased.
iii.)

Additionally, appellate court also reasoned that the

appellant should not have filed a suit for injunction simpliciter
but should have also prayed for relief of possession of the suit
property.
30.

Thus vide judgment and decree dated 12.08.80

learned appellate court allowed the appeal filed by the DDA
and set aside the judgment and decree dated 17.08.96 passed
by the learned Trial Court.
RSA No.229/1980

Page No.10 of 15

31.

Aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated

12.08.1980 passed by the learned appellate court the appellant
has filed the present second appeal.
32.

Vide order dated 24.9.1980 under-noted substantial

question of law was framed by this court:-

33.

“Whether the First Appellate Court was right in
law in reversing the decision on preliminary
issues on maintainability of suit and cause of
action against respondent No.1 which were
already decided by Trial Court on 26.8.1974
and the First Appellate Court itself dismissed
the application of respondent No.1 claiming
additional issues?”
The afore-noted substantial question of law is

inappropriate for the reason a perusal of the judgment of the
appellate court makes it clear that suit filed by the appellant
was not dismissed on account of maintainability but was
otherwise dismissed on merits.
34.

The only thing that has to be considered is that

whether the decision of the appellate court was correct.
35.

In so far as issue relating to genuineness of the sale

deed dated 27.1.1948 Ex. PW-2/1 is concerned, suffice would it
be to note the decision of the Supreme Court reported as Janki
Narayan Bhoir Vs. Narayan Namdeo Kadam AIR 2003 SC 759.
In the said decision the Supreme Court observed as under :“10. Section 68 of the Evidence Act speaks of
as to how a document required by law to be
attested can be proved. According to the said
Section, a document required by law to be
attested shall not be used as evidence until
one attesting witness at least has been called
for the purpose of proving its execution, if
RSA No.229/1980

Page No.11 of 15

36.

there by an attesting witness alive, and
subject to the process of the Court and
capable of giving an evidence. It flows from
this Section that if there be an attesting
witness alive capable of giving evidence and
subject to the process of the Court, has to be
necessarily examined before the document
required by law to be attested can be used in
an evidence..........”
The sale deed dated 27.1.1948 Ex.PW2/1 purported

to have been executed by the deceased has been witnessed
by one Amar Nath Kakar and Brij Dayal. These witnesses have
not been examined by the appellant.
37.

Testimonies of PW-3 and PW-4 do not establish that

sale deed dated 27.1.1948, Ex. PW-2/1 was executed by the
deceased.
38.

PW-3 has deposed that he had no knowledge about

the execution of the sale deed by the deceased.
39.

PW-4 deposed regarding the registration of the sale

deed dated 27.1.1948, Ex. PW-2/1. At this stage suffice would
it be to note the following observations of the Gujarat High
Court in the decision reported as

Lalbhai Trading Company &

Ors. Vs. UOI & Ors. (2006) 1 GLR 497:“It is also necessary to take into consideration
that the petitioner is also disputing its liability
as a surety. Whether or not, the petitioner
has executed the bond is an issue which
requires leading of evidence and thereafter
adjudication. In normal circumstances, such
an issue would not arise. However, where the
party who is termed to be surety denies the
execution of the bond it would fall within the
realm of leading of evidence and proving of
execution of document.
In law execution
means signing, sealing and delivery of
RSA No.229/1980

Page No.12 of 15

40.

document.
The term execution may be
defined as a formal completion of a deed. It is
the last act or series of acts which completes
it. Mere registration of a document is not in
itself sufficient proof of its execution. Under
Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
the proof of execution of document required
by law to be attested is provided for. The
concept of the term attested means that a
person has signed the document by way of
testimony to the fact that the said person saw
it being executed. An attesting witness is one
who signs the document in the presence of
the executant after seeing the execution of
the document or after receiving a personal
acknowledgment of the execution of the
document by the executant. A document
cannot be attested by a party to it.”
In said circumstances and considering the judgment

of the Supreme Court in Janki Narayan's case (supra) I find no
infirmity in the decision of the appellate court that the
appellant failed to duly prove the sale deed dated 27.1.1948,
Ex.PW-2/1.
41.

Assuming that the sale deed dated 27.1.1948

Ex.PW2/1 was duly executed by the deceased, the question
arises could the deceased transfer the suit property.
42.

Clause-13 of Terms and Conditions relating to the

tender/offer for Lease as noted in para 18 above and letter
dated 30.8.1943, Ex.D-6 issued by Delhi Improvement Trust
and addressed to deceased as noted in para 20 above are self
speaking. From a perusal of the afore-noted documents it is
clear that the deceased had no right to transfer the suit
property till perpetual lease deed in respect of the suit property
was executed in her favour and possession of the suit property
RSA No.229/1980

Page No.13 of 15

was handed over to her. None had happened.
43.

Before concluding I note that as per the records of

Delhi Improvement Trust and DDA, for the first time in the year
1971 appellant informed DDA that he had purchased the suit
property from the deceased. PW-2 in his testimony though has
deposed that even prior to 1971 they had informed DDA but he
failed to prove any record in support of same. That appellant
informed DDA

for the first time in the year 1971

is

strengthened by the fact that appellant also informed daughter
of the deceased about the said purchase in the year 1971 as
well. The sale deed Ex. PW-2/1 is dated 27.1.1948. The fact
that the appellant informed DDA about the purchase of the suit
property from the deceased about a gap 23 years is highly
suspicious of the due execution of the sale deed dated
27.1.1948 Ex.PW2/1.
44.

I note that as per the records of the Delhi

Improvement Trust no document was ever executed by it in
favour of the deceased in respect of title in the suit property.
45.

The only document from which deceased could have

derived title in the suit property was the Letter of Allotment
dated 27.1.1943 Ex.D-1.
46.

Letter of Allotment dated 27.1.1943 Ex.D-1 was also

the document on basis of which deceased could have
transferred her rights in the suit property in favour of another
person.
RSA No.229/1980

Page No.14 of 15

47.

As

already

noted

Letter

of

Allotment

dated

27.1.1943 Ex.D-1 contained therein Terms and Conditions
relating to the tender/offer for Lease, clause 13 of which
stipulated

that the

suit

property

could

not have been

transferred until execution of the perpetual lease deed in
favour of the deceased and delivery of the possession of the
suit property to the deceased.
48.

Even if it is assumed that the deceased executed

sale deed dated 27.1.1948 Ex.PW2/1, the fact which emerges is
that at the time of the alleged purchase of the suit property
appellant was fully cognizant of the Clause 13 of the Terms
and Conditions relating to the tender/offer for Lease.
49.

Appellant thus cannot be held to be a bonafide

purchaser for the reason he was clearly aware of the fact that
the deceased could not have transferred the suit property until
execution of the perpetual lease deed in favour of the
deceased and delivery of the possession of the suit property to
the deceased.
50.

In view of above discussion the present second

appeal is dismissed.
51.

No costs.
