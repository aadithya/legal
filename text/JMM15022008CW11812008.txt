Rule D.B.

2.

Ms.Maneesha Dhir, counsel for the respondents, states that

no counter affidavit is required and both the parties are
agreeable to argue the matter finally at this stage. We have
accordingly heard counsel for both the parties.
3.

The petitioners, who are Group C and D Combatised

Hospital Staff working with the CRPF, seek the grant of the
patient

care

allowance/hospital

patient

care

allowance

(hereinafter referred to as „the hospital allowance‟). The Group C
and D Hospital Staff in the Respondent Department is divided into
two categories viz. „Combatised‟ and „Non Combatised‟. However,
the said hospital allowance was sanctioned by the Government
only for Non combatised staff and it was denied to the
Combatised staff. The case set up by the petitioners is that there
is no difference between the two categories, insofar as their real
nature of duties, etc. is concerned. The only difference is that the
hospital staff recruited after 1989 are Combatised and the pre1989 recruits other than those who opted to be Combatised, are
all Non Combatised. Otherwise there is no difference in their role
WP(C) No.1181/2008

Page 3 of 7

and nature of duties except that the Combatised staff are trained
in combat and wear uniform while the Non Combatised are the
civilian staff with no training of combat and work in civil dress.
Therefore, it is submitted that, in fact, it is the Combatised staff
which has got the better training than Non Combatised staff.
Further, submission of the petitioners is that, as hospital staff,
they discharge their duties in the same manner as Non
Combatised staff and there is hardly any difference between the
two and therefore, the grant of the hospital allowance to the Non
combatised staff and denying the same to the Combatised staff
amounts to hostile discrimination.
4.

It is pointed out by the petitioners in this petition that their

colleagues belonging to Group C and Group D Combatised
Hospital Staff had filed an application before the Principal Bench
of Central Administrative Tribunal for directions to the authorities
to grant the hospital allowance, which was allowed. Against this
order of the Principal Bench of Central Administrative Tribunal,
the Union of India has filed a Civil Appeal No. 11966/1996 titled
as “Union of India Vs. T.M. Jose & Others” before the Supreme
Court, which was dismissed on 17th October, 2001. The said

WP(C) No.1181/2008

Page 4 of 7

order of the Supreme Court is annexed as Annexure P 3 with this
petition.
5.

The petitioners have also pointed out that other writ

petitions filed by similarly situated persons have been allowed by
various High Courts.

Particulars of two writ petitions are as

under. CWP No. 08/2004 titled as “Paramjit Singh and Ors. Vs.
UOI and Ors.” decided on 28th April, 2005, whereby the said J&K
High Court had directed the respondents to start paying the
hospital allowance to the Para Medical Staff Combatised at par
with Group C and D Civilian (Non Combatised) Hospital Staff. The
Indore Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court took a similar view in
CWP No. 6883/2004 titled as “Surajbhan and Ors. Vs. Union of
India and Ors.” decided on 22nd November, 2004.
6.

Ms.Maneesha Dhir, learned counsel appearing for the

respondents, fairly conceded the above-said factual position and
submitted that the aforesaid judgments have been complied with
by the CRPF. The petitioners in those cases have been granted
the benefit and are in receipt of the hospital allowance as is given
to Group C and D Civilian (Non Combatised) Hospital Staff.
7.

In view of the aforesaid, we put a query to Ms.Maneesha

WP(C) No.1181/2008

Page 5 of 7

Dhir as to why the respondents have not passed general orders
granting this benefit to all such Group C and D Combatised
Hospital Staff.

She submitted that the CRPF has received

communication from the Ministry of Home Affairs to the effect
that the Ministry of Finance has referred the matter to VIth
Central Pay Commission and the report of the said Commission is
still awaited.

That may be so, however, when there are

authoritative judicial pronouncements conferring such benefit
and

the

respondents/Government

have

accepted

and

implemented those judgments, we fail to understand as to why
all such similarly situated Group C and D Combatised Hospital
Staff are not extended the same benefit. The respondents, who
are supposed to act as a role model, cannot force each and every
person to approach this Court in order to get his legitimate dues.
It is expected that the respondents should have acted on the
basis of equality. The legal proposition in this regard is settled by
the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the judgment titled as Amrit Lal
Vs. Collector of Central Excise [1975 (1) SLR 153 (SC)], wherein it
was observed as under:
“When a citizen aggrieved by the action of the
Government Department has approached the
WP(C) No.1181/2008

Page 6 of 7

Court and obtained a declaration of law in his
favour, others, in like circumstances should be
able to rely on the sense of responsibility of the
department concerned and to expect that they
will be given benefit of this declaration without
need to take their grievances to the Court.”
8.

We, therefore, make the rule absolute and allow this

petition with the direction to the respondent to grant the hospital
allowance to the petitioners being Group C and D Combatised
Hospital Staff. We also direct to extend this benefit to other
similarly situated, namely, all such Group C and D Combatised
Hospital Staff working in the CRPF.
