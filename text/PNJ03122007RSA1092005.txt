3.

Appellant is the landlord.

Respondents are the legal

heirs of one Shiv Lal. Stand of the appellant is that the children of
Shiv Lal were not tenants under him and were illegally occupying
the tenanted premises. According to the appellant, Shiv Lal was a
tenant under him and

he executed a will dated 27.1.1999

bequeathing the tenanted premises in favour of the

appellant

directing his son Om Prakasah to vacate the tenanted premises.

to his tenanted premises

by the appellant

be

He claimed that he was paying rent @ Rs.50/- per

month to the appellant.
5.

It appears that there were some proceedings pending

before the learned Additional Rent Controller.

The impugned

order do refer to some proceedings but did not clarify what they
were.

Be that as it may, the learned Additional Rent Controller

held that Om Prakash had successfully established that he was a
tenant under the appellant.

Two orders were passed on

16.11.1991 and 23.11.1996.

Appeals were filed.

During

pendency of the appeals before the Rent Control Tribunal
appellant made a statement accepting Om Prakash as his tenant
provided Om Prakash paid to him rent @ Rs.100/- per month

w.e.f. 1.1.1991.

Subsequently, appellant filed an application to

withdraw the afore-noted statement.

The application was

allowed. On 2.12.1997 final orders were passed holding in favour
of Om Prakash.
6.

Appellant filed a suit for declaration praying that

orders dated 16.11.1991, 23.11.1996 and 2.12.1997 be declared
a nullity.

He alleged that the counsel engaged by him joined

hands with Om Prakash and did not conduct the trial in a proper
manner. That all the orders were obtained by playing fraud on
the court. Suit was dismissed vide order dated 2.5.2000. Appeal
filed by the appellant was dismissed on 28.9.2004.
7.

Both courts have noted a relevant fact. The relevant

fact was that after orders were passed in the petition filed by Om
Prakash, appellant withdrew

an eviction petition

filed by him

seeking ejectment of Om Prakash.
8.

Fraud alleged is not a fraud on the court. Thus, the

earlier decrees cannot be challenged by way of subsequent suit.
9.

Even otherwise as held

in the decisions reported as

2004 (2) CCC 462, Gopal Lal Vs. Babu Lal and 1993 (3) RCR 685
Banwari Lal Vs. Smt.Chando Devi court upon which fraud is
played is the court which has to be moved for setting aside its
orders.
10.

No question of law arises.
