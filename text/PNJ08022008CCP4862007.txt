The backdrop facts are that for the purpose of metro

of property bearing municipal No.21, Inder Prakash Building,

affected

by

the

acquisition.

The association of allottees had filed

the writ petition claiming right to receive the compensation for the
acquired land.
3.

The

court

declined

the

relief

holding

that

the

disbursement of compensation has to be decided in the acquisition
proceedings.
4.

Though not forming subject matter of the

petition, it

was recorded in the order that an endeavour would be made to shift
the amenities within 30 days so that the land could be used for the
purpose for which acquisition was being made.

Stand of the

petitioner who was impleaded as respondent No.7 was noted that
between Rs.35 to Rs.50 lacs

would be required for shifting the

amenities.
5.

While disposing of the said petition it was noted as

under :-

Cont. Cas.(C) No.486/2007

Page No.2 of 6

“It is now agreed that respondent No.7 would at
his own expense shift these amenities from the
acquired land to another piece of land available
on other part of the plot and identified by DMRC
for the purposes. It is also agreed that any
compensation that may be paid by the
government or by any authority for shifting these
amenities from the existing site to another site
shall not be claimed by any person except
respondent No.7. However, that alone will not
create any right in favour of respondent No.7 to
claim ownership of the acquired land nor the
same would give an exclusive right to the said
respondent to claim compensation for the same.
However, if any compensation is payable for
shifting these facilitates/amenities, respondent
No.7 alone will
be entitled to such
compensation.“
6.

Claiming to have spent Rs.48,21,307/- for shifting the

amenities and alleging that the Land Acquisition Collector did not
pay any money under said head to him, a contempt petition
registered as Cont.Cas(C) No.242/2005 was filed.

to

pay

The said

stand was repelled by this court vide its order dated 24.7.2006
disposing of Cont.Cas(C) No.242/2005.
8.

View taken was that the authority has to pay a holistic

compensation which includes money spent for work done which
facilitates the vacation of the premises for a public purpose.
9.

Directions were issued to the Land Acquisition Collector

to take a decision afresh.
10.

The Land Acquisition Collector sought review of the

Cont. Cas.(C) No.486/2007

Page No.3 of 6

order dated 24.7.2006. A stand was projected that since the award
has already been pronounced, the Land Acquisition Collector had
become functus-officio.

Thus, no supplementary

award could be

made.
11.

Since no formal orders were passed by the Land

Acquisition Collector after order dated 24.7.2006, review petition
filed by the Land Acquisition Collector was disposed of on 7.11.2006
by recording as under :“Learned counsel for the respondent states upon
instructions that an appropriate order after
examining the matter would be issued in
accordance with law. In view of this statement
nothing further survives in these proceedings.
The review petition is accordingly disposed off.”
12.

Thereafter, the Land Acquisition Collector proceeded to

pass an order

dated 22.12.2006 disposing of the claim of the

petitioner to be paid Rs.48,21,307/-.
13.

The Land Acquisition Collector declined to entertain the

merits of the claim recording that the award had been pronounced
on 30.6.2004 but the claim was submitted on 2.7.2004 i.e. after the
award.

He noted that no such claim was made pursuant to the

notice issued under Section 9 and 10 of the Act.

It was further

noted that assessment of damage caused to the building resulting
from the acquisition of the land was got valued from the Public
Works Department and sum of Rs.57,38,229/- assessed by the
Public Works Department

Cont. Cas.(C) No.486/2007

was allowed in the

award under the

Page No.4 of 6

heading “structure”.
14.

A short

issue arise for consideration.

Whether, while

passing the order dated 22.12.2006 the Land Acquisition Collector
is in contempt of the order dated 16.9.2003.
15.

It is urged by learned counsel for the petitioner that the

said order required compensation to be paid for shifting of the
amenities and admittedly none having been paid, the order has
been violated.
16.

Per contra, stand of the Land Acquisition Collector

is

that the consent directions required petitioner to file a proper claim
when notice was issued under Section 9 and 10 of the
Acquisition Act.

None having been filed

Land

and award having

pronounced on the existing material, the Land Acquisition Collector
having become functus-officio can do no more.

Additionally, it is

urged that the assessment of damage caused to the building
resulting from the acquisition as valued by Public Works Department
has been paid for in the award under the heading “structure”.
17.

It is settled law that only a contumacious violation of an

order passed by the court constitutes contempt.
18.

Prima facie, there is no contumacious violation of any

order passed by the Court.
19.

Order dated 16.9.2003 disposing of WP(C) No.5133/03

has to be construed in light of the law.

Law, being the Land

Acquisition Act,1894.

20.

The petitioner ought to have made a claim before the

Land Acquisition Collector and submitted proof in support thereof
when notice was issued under Section 9 of the Act. He admittedly
did not do so.
21.

The award stood pronounced on 30.6.2004.

was submitgted on 2.7.2004.

The claim

Obviously, on 30.6.2004 the Land

Acquisition Collector became functus-officio.
22.

The only remedy of the petitioner is to seek reference

under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Collector.
23.

The petitioner is better advised to avail said remedy.

24.

The notice of contempt is discharged.

25.

Petition is dismissed.
