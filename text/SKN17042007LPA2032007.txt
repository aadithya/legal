SANJIV KHANNA, J:
1.

The appellant, who appears in person, by way of present

appeal has challenged order dated 3rd January, 2007 passed by the

LPA No. 203/2007

Page 2

learned Single Judge dismissing his review application as well as
order dated 25th September, 2006 dismissing his writ petition.
2.

Learned Single Judge while dismissing the writ petition had

noticed that the appellant had made the following prayers:“a) Your Lordship may graciously be pleased
to issue a writ of mandamus and/or writ in the
nature of mandamus or any other appropriate
writ, direction or order for the respondents to
cease and desist providing every nature of
service, command, control, communication,
intelligence
and
information
to
the
Commonwealth of Australia till this Child Right
and Human Right Violation has been removed
by the partnership and treaties between the two
be quashed in total.
b)
During the pendency and final disposal of
this petition, the respondents and/or their
servants, or nominees may retrained from
enforcing executing continuing, buying, selling
exchanging or giving effect to any treaty
agreement without considering the human rights
and child rights violations of the petitioner.
c)
During the pendency and final disposal of
this petition, the respondents and/or their
servants, or nominees may restrained from
enforcing executing, continuing, buying, selling
exchanging or giving effect to any treaty
agreement, or finalising any future planned

LPA No. 203/2007

efforts and contracts or treaties without
considering the human rights and child rights
violations of the petitioner.
d)
During the pendency and final disposal of
this petition, the respondents and/or their
servants, or nominees may retrained from
enforcing executing continuing, buying, selling
exchanging or giving effect to any treaty
agreement or completing any present ongoing
completed treaties, contracts and agreement
without considering the human rights and child
rights violations of the petitioner.
e)
Any such relief or reliefs as this Hon'ble
Court deems just and proper in the facts and
circumstances in this case may also be granted.
f)
Grant the monetary compensation demand
as calculated before the National Human Rights
Commission and Supreme Court in the
applications for mentioned so as to teach the
respondents and their partners a lesson.”

3.

The appellant submitted before us that there has been gross

violation of UN Charter, fundamental rights of children
Rights Convention.

and Child

He has made various allegations against the

Commonwealth of Australia.
4.

The facts as stated in the petition are not lucid and clear.

However, it appears that the appellant is married to one Ms. Sarah
Newman Singh an Australian. He also has a minor daughter
aged about 5 years named Nara.

in

Australia. The appellant claims that he had last spoken to his wife
and daughter on 28th May, 2005. His wife told him that they were in
trouble and his daughter was perturbed and wanted him to come
back. The appellant claims thereafter that he has not been able to
talk to his wife and daughter in spite of repeated attempts. It also
appears that the appellant has been making visits to Australian High
Commission and Ministry of External Affairs as he apprehends that
his wife and daughter were kidnapped and

thereafter they have

disappeared.
5.

He had filed a writ petition before the Supreme Court which

was withdrawn with liberty to approach a court or any authority of a
competent jurisdiction.

He had also filed a petition before the

National Human Rights Commission, which was disposed of on 13th

LPA No. 203/2007

Page 5

July, 2005. A review application was also filed before the National
Human Rights Commission but without success.
6.

We agree with the finding of the learned Single Judge that basic

grievance of the appellant is against the Government of Australia.
The wife and child of the appellant are residing in Australia. The
appellant has already invoked jurisdiction of the Human Rights
Commission in Australia. We do not think that this Court can issue
any direction to the Union of India not to deal with and have
arrangement with the Government of Australia. No prayers as sought
for in the writ petition can be granted. It would be appropriate for the
appellant to process and to continue his proceedings, which have
already been initiated in Australia.
7.

The appeal has no merit and is dismissed. No costs.
