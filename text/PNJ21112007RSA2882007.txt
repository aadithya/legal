PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
I shall be referring to the respondents as the plaintiff

and the appellant as the defendant.
2.

Plaintiffs filed a suit for a permanent injunction inter

alia alleging that the father of the plaintiffs owned the suit
property and on his death same was inherited by the plaintiffs.
That Hari Ram, husband of the defendant was inducted as a
tenant in the suit premises by their father at a monthly rent of
Rs.13/-.

That their father had instituted an eviction petition

against the husband of the defendant under Section 14(1)(e) of
the Delhi Rent Control Act. That decree was not executed. That
page 1 of 4

after death of Hari Ram, defendant became a tenant and
continued to pay the rent. That rent up to 12.9.1982 had been
paid and thereafter none was paid. That the tenanted premises
consisted of a room with tin sheds as per site plan. That on
19.8.1996

the

defendant

attempted

to

raise

permanent

constructions by demolishing the existing structure.
3.

It was claimed that the plaintiffs are entitled to a

decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendant from
raising unauthorized constructions in the suit property.
4.

Defence taken was that after decree of eviction was

obtained against her husband, same not being executed, plaintiff
lost all rights against the defendant. That she became owner by
adverse possession.

That as owner of the property she was

entitled to deal with the property in whatsoever manner she
chose to.
5.

Learned courts below have taken the view and in my

opinion rightly that having admitted that her husband was a
tenant in the suit premises, principle of once a tenant always a
tenant would apply unless by evidence it was established that
relationship

changed.

That non-execution of the decree

obtained by the father of the plaintiffs would not alter the status
of either the defendant or her husband. I may additionally note
that the courts below have also taken note of a decision passed
page 2 of 4

by a learned Civil Judge pertaining to a suit filed by the husband
of the defendant seeking declaration that he was the owner of the
suit property. He had lost the battle. Said decree of civil court
had attained finality.
6.

No fault can therefore be found with the view

concurrently taken by both courts that the plaintiffs were the
owner of the suit property and that the defendant was a tenant
therein.
7.

On the issue of entitlement of the defendant to raise

constructions, suffice would it be to state that as per Building ByeLaws applicable in the city of Delhi not even the owner can raise
constructions or make additions and alterations without seeking a
prior sanction from the municipal authorities.
8.

Admittedly, no sanction has been obtained by the

defendant. Even otherwise, without consent or permission from
the landlord a tenant has no right to effect alterations or
additional constructions in a tenanted premises.

No fault can be

found with the judgments and decrees of the courts below which
have injuncted the defendant from raising

unauthorized

constructions in the suit property.
9.

It is urged that the decree is too wide and the span of

the decree sweeps even construction which may possibly be
made in the future.

Counsel has posed the question : What if
page 3 of 4

some repairs are required?
10.

The answer is to be found in the decree and law. It is

settled law that every decree has to be construed with reference
to the law in force.
11.

Constructions and repairs are treated separately in the

municipal Building Bye laws.

What has been injuncted in the

instant case is the carrying on of unauthorized constructions.
12.

No question of law, much less substantial questions of

law arises for consideration in the instant appeal.
13.

The appeal is dismissed in limine.
