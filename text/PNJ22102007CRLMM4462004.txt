PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
Petitioners are the real brothers of the complainant.

Petitioners seek quashing of a complaint filed by their brother
under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure alleging
offences purportedly committed by the petitioners under Section
406/420/468/471/120-B IPC.
2.

According to the complaint, the father of the 3 brothers

expired on 1.4.1992.

That petitioners forged a will purportedly

executed by their father on 28.2.1992 and acting

Page 1 of 3
under the forged will usurped the residential house of the father.
3.

Seeking quashing of the complaint it is pointed out that

the will in question is a registered will. The will gave life interest
to the mother and on her death petitioners were the beneficiary of
the property. Petitioners additionally rely upon the registered gift
deeds dated 15.3.1996 executed by their mother in their favour
exhilarating bequest.
4.

Petitioners further state that a civil suit being Suit

No.674/01 is pending adjudication before a Civil Judge.

The

plaintiff of the suit is the complainant. Relief claimed in the suit is
a declaration that the will relied upon by the petitioners is a
forged will.
5.

I have perused the plaint as also copy of the complaint.

6.

In my opinion, in view of the decision of the Supreme

Court reported as 1987 (Supp.) SCC 146 Sardool Singh & Anr. vs.
Smt.Nasib Kaur, the petition has to be allowed.
7.

In Sardool Singh's case (supra), Supreme Court was

considering a similar issue where a will was the subject matter of
a civil litigation and criminal proceedings were
Page 2 of 3
initiated alleging the will to be a forged document. It was opined

by the Supreme Court that since parties were litigating on the
issue at a civil forum, criminal proceedings could not continue.
However, it was observed that if civil suit results in a finding that
the will was a fabricated and a forged document, at that point of
time appropriate criminal proceedings could be initiated.
8.

I follow likewise.

9.

I

dispose

of

the

petition

quashing

the

criminal

complaint filed by the respondent, copy annexed as Annexure P-5.
I clarify that if it is held by the Civil Court that the will in question
is a forged will, it will be open to the complainant to take resort to
criminal proceedings as per law.
