PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
First appeal filed by DDA was delayed by 40 days.

The appeal was accompanied by an application under Section 5
of the Limitation Act. Learned Appellate Judge has opined that
sufficient cause was not shown and hence delay in filing the
appeal was not condoned.

The result was that DDA's

application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act was dismissed.
As a consequence the appeal was dismissed as time barred.
2.

Really speaking DDA ought not to have filed a

regular second appeal. The order which had to be challenged
was the order dismissing application filed by DDA under Section
page 1 of 10

5 of the Limitation Act. Order dismissing the first appeal was a
consequential order dismissing the appeal as barred by
limitation.
3.

Learned counsel for the parties state that the instant

appeal may be treated as a petition laying a challenge to the
order dated 6.3.2007 dismissing application

filed by DDA

under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
4.

The appeal in question along with the application

seeking delay to be condoned was filed on 13.7.2006.

The

judgment and decree which was challenged is dated 24.4.2006.
5.

The chronology of milestones between 24.04.2006

and 13.7.2006 as explained by DDA may be noted in a tabular
form. They read as under :24-4-06 The judgment was pronounced by the Trial

Reasons which have weighed with the learned

Appellate Judge may be noted in the language of the learned
Judge herself. It has been opined as under:“23.
I have given my considerable thought to
the submissions put forth by Ld. Counsel for parties
and carefully perused the record. The perusal of
record reveals that this application is supported by
an affidavit of Sh. Yashpal Garg, Director
(Commercial), DDA. It is clear that the impugned
judgment was passed on 24/4/2006 and on
26/4/2006, an application was moved for obtaining
certified copy, which was prepared on 29/4/2006.
Three days time for obtaining certified copy has to
be deducted.
There is no explanation from
30/4/2006 till 02/5/2006 when LA, Tis Hazari
submitted the file before SLA(TC). The time taken
by SLO(TC) to submit the file before SLO(LD) is two
days. It has not been explained why it was not
page 3 of 10

submitted immediately. After that there is gap of
seven days till report was submitted to Director(CL).
Satisfactory/sufficient reason in this delay has been
explained. After that from 12/5/2006 for about ten
days i.e. 22/5/2006, file could not be put before
Commissioner(Lands).
What
to
talk
of
cogent/sufficient reason, no reasons has been
explained from 12/5/2006 till 22/5/2006 for
movement
of
file
from
Director
(CL)
to
Commissioner (Lands). After this on 30/5/2006,
after gap of eight days, panel lawyer was
appointment.
Thee is no such explanation
regarding taking eight days' time even for
appointment of panel lawyer. After that it took
fourteen days by department to hand over the file
to panel lawyer on 14/6/2006. These fourteen days'
delay has not been explained in any manner. It has
further been submitted that Ld. Counsel for
appellant was out of station to attend marriage of
his relative and came back on 01/7/2006. Neither
there is any affidavit of Ld. Counsel for appellant
supporting this averment nor any detail has been
mentioned. It has not been mentioned regarding
the place/station where Ld. Counsel had gone and
the relationship also. Even the date of marriage has
not been mentioned. Even sufficient reason has not
been explained for filing the appeal on 13/7/2006,
after coming back of ld. Counsel for appellant on
01/7/2006.
24.
It is clear that sufficient cause has not
been explained for such delay. At the most the
appeal after deducting period for obtaining certified
copy should have been filed by 23/5/2006, but it
has been filed on 13/7/2006. There is delay of
about forty days in filing the appeal. This delay as
mentioned above, has not been explained properly.
It is well settled proposition of law that it is not the
period of delay which has to be considered while
deciding such application, but sufficient reasons to
be explained. There should be sufficient cause to
be explained by the applicant, which compelled him
from filing of the appeal after lapse of period of
limitation.”
7.

A perusal of the reasons recorded by the learned
page 4 of 10

Appellate Judge show that the gap between 12.5.2006 to
22.5.2006 (10 days), further gap between 30.5.2006 to
14.6.2006 (14 days) and the gap between 1.7.2006 to
13.7.2006

(12

days) has been held

as not sufficiently

explained.
8.

Various

judicial

pronouncements

pertaining

to

approach to be adopted by the courts while dealing with
applications for delay to be condoned have been noted by the
learned Appellate Judge.
9.

I do not intend to make a catalogue of various

judicial pronouncements nor do I intend to pen down a lengthy
order stating as to which judgment has been followed by which
and which judgment has been explained or dissented from in
which.
10.

The principles of law which guide the court in

considering applications which seek to show sufficiency of
cause for a default may succinctly be stated as under :(A)

Since

substantive

processual

laws,

unless

laws
the

are

subservient

compelling

to

language

the
of

a

processual law leaves no scope for a contrary interpretation, a
processual law must be construed in a manner which subserves
the purpose of the substantive law.
(B)

No party is presumed to not enforce the statutory rights
page 5 of 10

available to the party.

Meaning thereby, the consideration

must begin with a presumption in favour of the bona fides of
the concerned party.
(C)

Whenever there is delay there is bound to be some

negligence.

Sans negligence, there would never be a delay

resulting in a default. Thus, the issue has not to be looked with
reference to negligence alone but with reference to the
backdrop facts resulting in delay or default as the case may be.
(D)

Each day's delay has not to be considered; meaning

thereby, pedantic approach has not to be adopted by the
Courts. The pleadings in the concerned application have to be
read liberally and pragmatically.
(E)

The pragmatic approach requires the court to see whether

facts laid before the court evidence a desire of the party to
exercise its statutory rights or not. Meaning thereby, court has
to look to such facts wherefrom it can be gathered that the
party was desirous of exercising its statutory right and was
taking steps in said direction.
(F)

As against a living human being, where the party is a

juristic entity, the court has to be conscious to the fact that the
juristic entity acts through a hierarchy of living human beings
and the file has to travel various tiers as per the administrative
hierarchy in the department.
page 6 of 10

(G)

Even if the delay is excessive that by itself would not be

sufficient to throw out a claim which otherwise is meritorious
and if the litigant is an instrumentality of the State and the
cause which is being espoused by it is as the custodian of
public property, due weightage has to be given to said fact.
11.

With the afore-said guiding principles I re-visit the

chronology of facts noted here-in-above.
12.

The judgment and the decree is dated 24.4.2006.

Promptness was shown in exercising the appellate remedy.
Certified copy was applied for on 26.4.2006. It was received on
29.4.2006 and was promptly dispatched to the Senior Law
Officer (LD) on 3.5.2006. The very next day it was received in
the office of the Senior Law Officer who gave an opinion that
appeal be filed. The file was received by the Director
(Commercial Lands) on 11.5.2006.
5.5.2006 was a Friday.

It has to be noted that

6th and 7th May were Saturday and

Sunday. Offices of DDA were closed.
13.

Thus, the first gap stated to be unexplained as per

learned Appellate Judge is explainable. Even otherwise, as
noted here-in-above, while considering issue of sufficient cause
in belated filing of an appeal each day's delay has not to be
noted. A broad overview of the facts has to be in the vision of
the court.
page 7 of 10

14.

The

Director

(Commercial

Lands)

recorded

his

opinion and transmitted the file to Commissioner (Land
Disposal) on 12.5.2006. After penning down his note he sent
the file to the Chief Legal Advisor on 15.5.2006. The file was
processed by the Deputy Chief Legal Advisor on 22.5.2006.
15.

The second gap of 7 days noted by the learned

Judge, i.e. between 15.5.2006 and 22.5.2006 is explainable on
account of the fact that 2 out of the 7 days in between
happened to be a Saturday and the Sunday. Thereafter, the file
was immediately processed on 23.5.2006 and appeal was
recommended to be filed on 24.5.2006. The file was received
back in the office of the Chief Legal Advisor on 25.5.2006. It
happened to be a Thursday. The day next after, happened to
be a Saturday, following next by a Sunday. Meaning thereby
that between 25.5.2006 and 30.5.2006, 2 days were nonworking days.
16.

The courts closed for summer vacations on 3.6.2006.

Obviously, DDA had a problem in locating the counsel who was
not in station. File was handed over in the office of the panel
lawyer during summer vacations.
17.

Counsel returned on 1.7.2006.

18.

Obviously, the counsel took some time to settle

down not only to the grinding heat of Delhi but even to the
page 8 of 10

work schedule after spending time in the hills.
counsel's

negligence

should

not

visit

DDA

In any case,
with

penal

consequences.
19.

The appeal was prepared on 10.7.2006 and was filed

on 13.7.2006.
20.

At every stage DDA has shown a desire to bona fide

prosecute its statutory right to file the appeal.
21.

Within the contours of the requirements of law I hold

that sufficient facts are brought on record entitling DDA to have
the the delay condoned in filing the first appeal.
22.

The appeal is accordingly allowed.

23.

Order

dated

6.3.2007

passed

by

the

learned

Additional District Judge is set aside and application filed by
DDA under Section 5 of the Limitation Act praying that delay in
filing the appeal be condoned is allowed. Delay in filing the first
appeal is condoned.
24.

RCA No.29/2006 is restored to the file of the learned

Additional District Judge.

The same would be decided in

accordance with law and on merits.
25.

Parties are directed to appear before the learned

Additional District Judge on 19.12.2007.
26.

Registry is directed to supply a certified copy of the

present order to learned counsel for the appellant.

On the

page 9 of 10

certified copy of the present order being produced learned
Judge would restore the appeal.

If need be, a formal

application will be filed by the appellant.
27.

No costs.
