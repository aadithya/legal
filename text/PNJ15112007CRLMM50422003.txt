1.

Petitioners, impleaded as accused in a complaint

filed by the respondent no.2, Mohd Shamim, under Sections
307,436 and 511 IPC seek quashing of the complaint as also
the summoning order dated 21.10.03.
2.

Facts necessary to dispose of the present petition

Page 1 of 8

are that one Sh. Mohd. Amzad Oureshi, son of respondent
no.2/complainant alleged that on 3.7.01 a mob led by the
petitioners came to his house bearing no.7427, Gali Chhoti
Masjid, Quresh Nagar, Delhi and set it on fire. That articles
worth Rs.10.5 lacs were destroyed in the fire. That in addition
to burning the house, the mob also attacked him and his family
members particularly his father. That as a result of the attack,
he and his father sustained grievous injuries. That the mob had
attacked him, his house and family members to take revenge
on him as he had filed a writ petition because of which
unauthorised slaughtering houses were ordered to be closed
and heavy fine was imposed on its owners.
3.

On the basis of the afore-noted statement of Mohd.

Amzad Oureshi, the police registered a FIR No. 238/01 under
Sections

147/148/149/186/152/380/506/323/435/427/383/332/34

IPC against only 11 persons.
4.

Feeling dissatisfied with the action taken by the

police in the afore-mentioned FIR, respondent no.2 filed a
complaint under Sections 307/436 and 511 IPC. 58 accused
persons were named in the said complaint. Along with the
complaint, an application under Section 156(3) of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 was also filed praying that a case
under Sections 307/436 and 511 IPC be filed against the
persons named as accused i.e. the petitioners. It was stated in
Page 2 of 8

the complaint as also the application under Section 156(3),
Cr.P.C. that the police have colluded with the accused
persons/petitioners and is trying to shield them by implicating
the accused persons only for commission of minor offences and
not including serious offences i.e. Sections 307, 436 and 511
IPC.
5.

Taking

cognizance

of

the

complaint

and

the

evidence led by the complainant, vide order dated 21.10.03 the
learned Metropolitan Magistrate summoned the petitioners to
face trial for offences under Section 307 and 436 of the IPC and
also directed the issuance of non-bailable warrants against the
petitioners.
6.

Aggrieved by the order dated 21.10.03 passed by

the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, the petitioners have
approached this Court under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 seeking quashing of the complaint
and the summoning order.
7.

In support of the petition, learned counsel for the

petitioners drew support from the Section 210(1) of CrPC, 1973
and contended that in view of the provisions of Section 210(1)
the learned Metropolitan Magistrate ought not to have issued
process against the petitioners as the investigation in FIR
No.238/01 which pertained to the same incident was already in
progress.
Page 3 of 8

8.

Section 210 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

reads as under :“210.
Procedure to be followed when
there is a complaint case and police
investigation in respect of the same
offence.- (1) When in a case instituted
otherwise than on a police report (hereinafter
referred to as a complaint case), it is made to
appear to the Magistrate, during the course of
the inquiry or trial held by him, that an
investigation by the police is in progress in
relation to the offence which is the subjectmatter of the inquiry or trial held by him, the
Magistrate shall stay the proceedings of such
inquiry or trial and call for a report on the
matter from the police officer conducting the
investigation.
(2) If a report is made by the investigating
police officer under section 173 and on such
report cognizance of any offence is taken by
the Magistrate against any person who is an
accused in the complaint case, the Magistrate
shall inquire into or try together the complaint
case and the case arising out of the police
report as if both the cases were instituted on
a police report.
(3) If the police report does not relate to any
accused in the complaint case or if the
Magistrate does not take cognizance of any
offence on the police report, he shall proceed
with the inquiry or trial, which was stayed by
him, in accordance with the provisions of this
Code.”
9.

Before the provisions of Section 210(1) can be

applied in a given case, it is essential that :i)

Complaint case and FIR case pertains to same

offence; and
Page 4 of 8

ii)

Investigation in the FIR case must be in progress.

10.

In the instant case, it has to be thus seen that

whether at the time of issuance of summoning order dated
21.10.03, investigation in FIR No.238/01 was in progress or
was concluded.
11.

A perusal of the orders passed by the learned

Metropolitan Magistrate in the complaint case is as follows :S.

against

the

Order dated 12.03.03 clearly records that the police

had filed challan in FIR No.238/01.
13.

Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

stipulates that on the completion of investigation, the officer
in-charge of the police station is duty bound to submit a report
(challan) to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of
the offence.
14.

Thus, from the order dated 12.03.03, it is apparent

that the police had already concluded the investigation in FIR
No.238/01 when vide order dated 21.10.03 the learned
Metropolitan Magistrate directed issuance of the process
against the accused persons. From a perusal of the orders, it is
further apparent that the learned Metropolitan Magistrate
issued

process against the accused persons only after

satisfying itself that the challan in the FIR No.238/01 had
already been filed.
15.

At this stage, I further note the judgment of the
Page 6 of 8

Supreme Court in the decision reported as Hari Singh v State
of U.P. AIR 2006 SC 2464. In para 4 of the said decision, the
Supreme Court had observed as under :“4.When the information is laid with the
police, but no action in that behalf is taken,
the complainant can under Section 190 read
with Section 200 of the Code lay the
complaint before the Magistrate having
jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence
and the Magistrate is required to enquire into
the complaint as provided in Chapter XV of
the Code. In case the Magistrate after
recording evidence finds a prima facie case,
instead of issuing process to the accused, he
is empowered to direct the police concerned
to investigate into offence under Chapter XII
of the Code and to submit a report. If he finds
that the complaint does not disclose any
offence to take further action, he is
empowered to dismiss the complaint under
Section 203 of the Code. In case he finds that
the complaint/evidence recorded prima facie
discloses an offence, he is empowered to take
cognizance of the offence and would issue
process to the accused. These aspects have
been highlighted by this Court in All India
Institute of Medical Sciences Employees'
Union (Reg) through its President v. Union of
India and Ors [(1996) 11 SCC 582].It was
specifically observed that a writ petition in
such cases is not to be entertained.
16.

In view of the above discussion, I find no infirmity in

the order dated 21.10.03.
17.

The petition is devoid of any merits and is dismissed.

18.

No costs.
