VIKRAMAJIT SEN, J.:
JUDGMENT
1.

The Petitioner prays for the quashing of the impugned

Detention Order dated 14.2.1997 whereby, with a view to prevent
him in future from acting in any manner prejudicial to the
augmentation of foreign exchange, it was found necessary to direct
him to be detained and kept in custody. The prayer to produce the
Petitioner and set him at liberty has been rendered infructuous as
the Detention Order has expired. The challenge is founded on the

WP(Crl.)442/1997

Page 1 of 13

grounds of delay in passing the Detention Order; non-supply of
copies of baggage tags and Search Warrants, thereby undermining
the effective representation against the Detention Order; and that
since the Passport of the Petitioner had been impounded, no
further illegal activity was possible.

2.

Arguments were heard in great detail on 9.1.2008 for over

one hour. Regretfully, all that time only a proxy counsel for the
Respondents was available, who was unable to assist us in the
matter. We have deliberately delayed the pronouncement of this
Judgment, but that notwithstanding, no appearance, request or
representation has been made by the counsel on record. We have,
therefore, carefully perused the Counter Affidavit in an effort to
gather and understand the case of the Respondents. The facts of
the case can be drawn from the grounds on which the impugned
Detention Order has been issued, dated 14.2.1997. It recites that
the Petitioner was arrested under Section 35 of the Foreign
Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (FERA for short) on 25.9.1996 by
the officers of the Enforcement Directorate, Mumbai. One day
earlier, on 24.9.1996, the Petitioner had been apprehended, his
statement had been recorded, and his residence had been
searched. On being produced before the Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate, Mumbai, he was remanded to judicial custody till

WP(Crl.)442/1997

Page 2 of 13

30.9.1996 on which date he was enlarged on bail. As is evident, the
Detention Order was passed almost after the passage of five
months. There is no material on record, and certainly none has
been brought to our notice, because of the non-representation of
the Respondents, showing investigation of any sort was undertaken
between September/October, 1996 and February, 1997. There is
no gainsaying that Preventive Detention can be justified only if
there is a clear and present possibility or danger of illegal activity
(smuggling

in

this

instance)

being

continued;

wherever

unexplained delay occurs this presumption no longer endures or
exists.

3.

Almost four decades ago it had been observed in Moti Lal

Jain -vs- State of Bihar, AIR 1968 SC 1509 that the interest

of

society are no less important than that of an individual and that
when these two rights collide with each other, the Court must
bring in being a balance between them.

A score years later, in

T.A. Abdul Rahman -vs- State of Kerala, (1989) 4 SCC 741 = AIR
1990 SC 225 the Supreme Court opined that “when there is
unsatisfactory

and

unexplained

delay

between

the

date

of

detention and the date of securing arrest of the detenu such a
delay would throw considerable doubt on the genuineness of the
subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority leading to a

WP(Crl.)442/1997

Page 3 of 13

legitimate inference that the detaining authority was not really and
genuinely satisfied as regards the necessity for detaining the
detenu with a view to preventing him from acting in a prejudicial
manner”. These observations have been extracted and reiterated
in Rajinder Arora -vs- Union of India, AIR 2006 SC 1719: 2006(4)
SCC 796 . This kind of delay has been found to be fatal in P.M.

Hari Kumar -vs- Union of India, (1995) 5 SCC 691 and SMF Sultan
Abdul Kader -vs- Jt. Secy. to Govt. of India, (1998) 8 SCC 343. A
complete analysis of the law is available in the decision of the
Division Bench of this Court in Dalbir Singh-vs- Union of India,
1995 I AD (Delhi) 1169 which deals with the circumstances that
can be considered as constituting delay both in the passing of the
Detention Order as well as its execution.

Dalbir Singh also

discusses the facet of non-supply of documents.

Therefore, it

would apply on all fours to the case in hand unless, in the decade
that has elapsed since its pronouncement, the Supreme Court has
varied the law. It appears to us that the law has not been changed.
This is evident from a reading of Rajinder Arora, Vinod K.

Chawla -vs- Union of India, (2006) 7 SCC 337 and Sheetal Manoj
Gore -vs- State of Maharashtra, (2006) 7 SCC 560 .

4.

In Sk. Nizamuddin -vs- State of West Bengal, AIR 1974 SC

2353 it has been observed that the Detaining Authority is obliged

WP(Crl.)442/1997

Page 4 of 13

“to place all relevant facts before the Court and if there is any
delay in arresting the Detenu pursuant to the Order of Detention
which is prima facie unreasonable, the State must give reasons
explaining the delay”. In that case no explanation had been
tendered and the Detention Order was quashed. The facts in Issac

Babu -vs- Union of India, (1990) 4 SCC 135 were that the Detenu
was implicated by the main culprit in his statement under Section
108 of the Customs Act recorded on 30.11.1986. The Detention
Order came to be passed only on 7.10.1987 and was executed on
23.5.1988. The delay was considered sufficient reason to quash the
Detention Order. In A. Mohammed Farook -vs- Jt. Secy. to G.O.I., JT
1999 (10) SC 290 : 2000(2) SCC 360 the Order was made on
25.2.1999 and executed on 5.4.1999. But in the interregnum the
Detenu was available in Court proceedings on 25.2.1999 and
25.3.1999. Since no explanation was forthcoming as to why the
Order was not executed at least on these dates, it was quashed. In

Abdul Kader the Detention Order was passed on 14.3.1996 and
executed on 7.8.1997 and the Court found that no explanation had
been given for the period 14.3.1996 to 25.4.1996. In P.V. Iqbal -vs-

Union of India, 1992 (1) Crimes 166 the Detention Order was dated
21.8.1989, received by the Superintendent of Police on 1.9.1989
who further dispatched it to the Circle Inspector, Thrissur, who
thrice reported that the Detenu was not available in his native

WP(Crl.)442/1997

Page 5 of 13

place. The Government issued an Order under Section 7(1)(b) of
the

Conservation

of

Foreign

Exchange

and

Prevention

of

Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA Act) on 14.5.1990.
Eventually, the Detenu was arrested on 9.8.1990 from his village.
The Court was of the view that “the Detaining Authority, after
passing the Detention Order, was indifferent in securing the
Detenu by not taking appropriate action with greater promptitude.
The police officials have treated the Warrant of Arrest in a casual
manner and unduly delayed its execution”. The Order was quashed
for this reason. In K.P.M. Basheer -vs- State of Karnataka, 1992
Crl. L.J. 1927 : (1992) 2 SCC 295 the Detenu was, on 12.11.1990,
found in possession of gold with foreign markings for which no
valid explanation was forthcoming. The impugned Order was
passed on 7.1.1991 and it was served on 28.6.1991.

The Order

could have been served on the Detenu as he had appeared before
the Assistant Collector of Customs on 6.2.1991 and 20.2.1991. It
was in these circumstances that the Court was unable to locate
the live and proximate links between the grounds of detention, and
took the view that the purpose of detention had snapped on
account of undue and unreasonable delay. It should be noted that
Section 7 (1)(b) of the COFEPOSA Act had not been resorted to.

In Shafiq Ahmad -vs- District Magistrate, Meerut, JT 1989(3)

SC 659 : (1989) 4 SCC 556 it was noted that from 15.4.1998 to
12.5.1988 and thereafter from 29.9.1988 to 2.10.1988 no attempt
had been made to contact or arrest the Detenu and no explanation
had been offered for this inactivity. In Ahamed Mohaideen Zabbar

-vs- State of Tamil Nadu, 1999 (2) JCC (SC) 292 : 1999 (4) SCC 417
a Show Cause Notice was issued to the Detenu under the Customs
Act on 4.5.1998 and the adjudication proceedings were completed
on 9.1.1998. The Detention Order was passed on 23.11.1998 and
since no explanation was tendered for the delay, it was struck
down. In S.K. Serajul -vs- State of West Bengal, (1975) 2 SCC 78
delay at the stage of passing of the Detention Order as well as its
execution was found not to have been specifically explained. The
Court clarified that they “must not be understood to mean that
whenever there is delay in making an Order of Detention or in
arresting the Detenu pursuant to the Order of Detention, the
subjective satisfaction of the Detaining Authority must be held to
be not genuine or colourable. Each case must depend on its
peculiar facts and circumstances. The Detaining Authority must
have a reasonable explanation for the delay and that might be seen
to dispel the inference that its satisfaction was not genuine”. In

Manju Ramesh Nahar -vs- Union of India, (1999) 4 SCC 116 the
Detention Order was passed on 3.2.1997 which was executed on

WP(Crl.)442/1997

Page 7 of 13

23.4.1998. The Court was not impressed with the vague allegation
that the Detenu was absconding and was apprehended on
21.3.1998; it was found that the parties had not given details of
any steps that might have been taken in the meantime to execute
the Order.

6.

From a distillation of these decisions it appears to us that if

we are subjectively satisfied that unexplained and unjustified delay
has occurred either in the passing of the Detention Order or in its
execution, the assault on the liberty of an individual must be
redressed forthwith. However, the jural assessment of such
grounds is not akin to that prevailing in criminal matters. This
distinction has been drawn in Union of India -vs- Amrit Lal

Manchanda, JT 2004(2) SC 378 : AIR 2004 SC 1625 where their
Lordships observed thus:
8.

....The

of

the

Detaining

Authority,

therefore, is considered to be of primary importance,
with great latitude in the exercise of its discretion. The
Detaining Authority may act on any material and on any
information that it may have before it. Such material and
information may merely afford basis for a sufficiently
strong suspicion to take action, but may not satisfy the
tests of legal proof on which alone a conviction for

tenable.

their

meanings provide the justification for the laws of
prevention detention. Laws that provide for preventive
detention posit that an individual's conduct prejudicial to
the maintenance of public order or to the security of
State or corroding financial base provides grounds for
satisfaction for a reasonable prognostication of possible
future manifestations of similar propensities on the part
of the offender. This jurisdiction has at times been even
called a jurisdiction of suspicion. The compulsions of the
very preservation of the values of freedom of democratic
society and of social order might compel a curtailment
for individual liberty. "To, lose our country

by a

scrupulous adherence to the written law" said Thomas
Jefferson "would be to lose the law itself, with life,
liberty and all those who are

7.

In Hemlata -vs- State of Maharashtra, (1982) 1 SCR 1028 the

Apex Court has clarified that the Constitution of India does not
empower the writ Court or even the Supreme Court to function as
an appellate forum on the merits of the Detention Order. Their

WP(Crl.)442/1997

Page 9 of 13

duty is to ensure that all the formalities enjoined by Article 22(5)
have been complied with by the Detaining Authority.

8.

Reliance has been placed by Mr. Raju Ram Chandran,

learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner on Issac Babu (supra),

Rajinder Arora(supra) and T.A. Abdul Rahman(supra) .

9.

It is in the conspectus of these cases that we have to test

whether there is any delay, and if so, whether a valid explanation
has been tendered in respect thereof.

We have perused the

Counter Affidavit filed by the Joint Secretary, COFEPOSA and find
that no explanation is forthcoming as to why a delay of almost five
months

had

occurred

between

the

relevant

incident

in

September/October, 1996 and the passing of the impugned
Detention Order in February, 1997. We, therefore, are of the view
that the impugned Detention Order must be quashed on this
ground.

10.

We are, however, not impressed with the contention that

since the Petitioner's Passport had been impounded, any further
illegal activity by him had become impossible. Smuggling or illegal
transactions of foreign exchange are most often carried out
through organised gangs. Even if the Petitioner had been disabled

WP(Crl.)442/1997

Page 10 of 13

from travelling abroad because of the impounding of his Passport,
his continued participation in these illegal activities cannot be
ruled out. All that can be assumed is that the Petitioner would not
be the person actually and physically carrying the foreign
exchange or smuggled goods.

There is every reason to assume,

keeping the background of such person in perspective, that he
would find a substitute. Therefore, confiscation of the Passport is
not per se a ground for quashing the Detention Order.

11.

A copy of the Detention Order and the grounds have been

supplied to the Petitioner in English as well as in Hindi. His ipse

dixit, totally unsubstantiated, that although he has studied upto
SSC level, he could only read and write Marathi cannot be
accepted by the Court.

It has been pointed out in the Counter

Affidavit that the Petitioner had given his statement, in his own
handwriting, in Hindi. This ground is patently false and untenable.

12.

It has next been contended by learned Senior Counsel for the

Petitioner that several documents, relied upon by the Respondents,
had not been supplied, thereby seriously handicapping the
Petitioner's right to make a Representation. In the first place, it
has been contended that copies of the baggage tags have not been
supplied. According to the Respondents the impugned foreign

WP(Crl.)442/1997

Page 11 of 13

currency was found in checked-in baggage allegedly belonging to
the Petitioner. In our opinion, the case of the Respondents could
not have been made good unless, but by reliance on the baggage
tags/ticket jacket etc. The foreign currency could be traced back to
the Petitioner only through these documents, which assume the
nature of relied upon documents and therefore ought to have been
supplied to the Petitioner.

The rights of the Petitioner under

Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India have been seriously
compromised and the Detention Order is liable to be quashed on
this ground. No meaningful asseverations on this point are
available in the Counter Affidavit. The situation is similar in the
case of Search Warrants and Summons. In the Counter Affidavit it
has been stated that copies of the Search Warrants are not
furnished as a practice. The practice adopted by the Respondents
is wholly irrelevant if it does not meet with the requirements of
law. This is especially so in those cases where these documents
are relied upon or perforce must be relied upon by the Detaining
Authority. As in the case of baggage tags we are of the view that
non-supply of copies of the Summons and Statements recorded of
the co-accused, the Detention Order is bad in law.

13.

For the reasons sated above, firstly since there is an

inordinate and unexplained delay between the incident and the

WP(Crl.)442/1997

Page 12 of 13

issuance of the Detention Order and secondly because copies of all
the documents relied upon by the Respondents had not been
served on the Petitioner, the Detention Order is liable to be set
aside.

We accordingly quash and set aside the impugned

Detention Order. Parties to bear their respective costs. Petition is
disposed of.
