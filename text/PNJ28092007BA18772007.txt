a

complaint

lodged

by

one

K.S.Tomar, FIR No.109/07 has been registered pursuant to a
complaint lodged by the Central Bank of India, Greater Kailash
Branch, New Delhi.
3.

I would be noting the admitted facts and thereafter

the facts on which there is a divergence between the
prosecution and the defence.
4.

Admitted facts are that Neena Gulati and one

Mandeep Singh Chatwal had entered into a partnership to carry
on business under the name and style 'The Perfect Ten'. The
business was of running beauty, slimming, health and fitness
centres.
premises.

2 centres were being operated from 2 different
One business was being operated from the

basement of a house bearing Municipal No.E-84 Greater
Kailash, Part-I and the other was being operated from part of a
residential building bearing Municipal No.H-1/A Hauz Khas, New
Delhi.

Further admitted fact is that Mandeep Singh Chatwal

retired from the partnership and K.S.Tomar and his son Pankaj
Tomar as also one Navroop Singh joined Neena Gulati as
partners of The Perfect Ten.
Bail Appl. Nos.1882 & 1877/07

A deed of partnership dated
Page No.2 of 10

8.8.2002 was executed. Share of K.S.Tomar and his son in the
profits and losses of the partnership firm was 15%.
5.

Further

admitted

fact

is

that

a

few

months

thereafter, on 2.12.2002, K.S.Tomar and his son walked out
from the partnership and it was agreed that in lieu of the
investment made by the father and son in the capital of the
partnership firm they would be paid a minimum guaranteed
sum of Rs.63,820/- per month. Further admitted fact is that the
minimum guarantee agreement recorded that the Tomars had
invested Rs.56,72,900/- in the partnership firm which money
was used for purchasing various equipments for running of the
beauty, fitness and slimming centres.
6.
Perfect

Further admitted fact is that the partnership firm The
Ten

applied

for

and

obtained

a

Cash

Credit

(Hypothecation) limit of Rs.7 lacs and a term loan of Rs.41 lacs
from the Central Bank of India.

When said facilities were

availed of, The Perfect Ten was functioning as the sole
proprietory firm of Neena Gulati i.e. other partners had retired.
7.

Hereinafter are the facts which are in dispute

between the parties.
8.

K.S.Tomar lodged a complaint which resulted in

registration of FIR No.435/06 under afore-noted provisions
stating that Neena Gulati induced him to invest money in the
Bail Appl. Nos.1882 & 1877/07

Page No.3 of 10

fitness and slimming centres which she was running along with
Mandeep Singh Chatwal.

She gave him a rosy picture.

invested Rs.56,72,900/- in the partnership firm.

He

That Neena

Gulati did not pay him any profits as she was in control of the
business and was manipulating the accounts.

That he was

residing in Panchkula, Haryana. That Neena Gulati induced him
to retire from the partnership and instead received a minimum
guarantee of Rs.63,820/- per month.

He further stated that

certain post dated cheques which were issued by Neena Gulati,
when presented for encashment were dishonoured.

That in

furtherance of her intention to cheat him Neena Gulati
dissipated all the assets of The Perfect Ten.
9.

As regards the bank, allegation is that Neena Gulati

obtained 2 facilities i.e. Cash Credit and Term Loan totalling
Rs.48 lacs.

She availed the benefit under the 2 sanctions

granted to her.

That the machinery and equipment at the

beauty, slimming and fitness centres at Greater Kailash and
Hauz Khas which were hypothecated to the bank were
dissipated. Further, equitable mortgage credited by one Harpal
Singh Ahuja pertaining to Flat No.108-C, Plot No.6, Naseer Pur,
Dwarka by means of an equitable mortgage when loan was
advanced was frustrated inasmuch as Harpal Singh Ahuja sold
the flat to a third party.
Bail Appl. Nos.1882 & 1877/07

Page No.4 of 10

10.

Rival versions of Neena Gulati is that due to the

sealing drive in Delhi she has to close the fitness slimming
centres. That the loss was a business loss.
11.

Pertaining to the machinery, equipment and other

allied things at the fitness and slimming centres, the equipment
was found in the custody of one Ashok Mittal who claimed
ownership thereof on account of the fact that Neena Gulati had
taken from him a loan in sum of Rs.70 lacs in 2 installments of
Rs.50 lacs and Rs.20 lacs.
12.

Neena Gulati seeks to explain the custody of the

equipment and other movables at the fitness and slimming
centres with Ashok Mittal by placing reliance on a letter dated
28.2.2006 addressed to the SHO, Vasant Kunj Police Station.
She further takes refuge on the fact that she is suffering from
Brain Tuberclosis.
13.

In her complaint dated 28.2.2006 Neena Gulati has

informed the SHO PS Vasant Kunj that due to her ill health and
nature of infirmity, she is required to take strong medicines
which keep her drowsy and sleepy.

That Ashok Mittal

accompanied by one one P.S.Gulati, one Harpreet Gulati and
one C.M.Thapar came to her flat and compelled her to sign
blank papers some of which were stamp papers.

In her

complaint dated 28.2.2006 she has informed the SHO that
Bail Appl. Nos.1882 & 1877/07

Page No.5 of 10

equipments of the centres have been taken possession of by
Ashok Mittal and his henchman.
14.

Is it a case of a civil transaction not meeting the

expectations of the complainants? Is it a case where due to the
sealing drive in Delhi fitness and slimming centres being
required to be closed down have resulted in business losses?
15.

Prima facie, the answer has to be in the negative.

16.

It is not in dispute that the entire investment of

Mr.Tomar as also substantial part of the loans taken from the
bank have not been returned.
17.

Neena Gulati has not explained as to how and on

what account for the same set of equipments she took money
from Tomars as also from the bank. Prima facie it is a case of
taking money from 2 persons and purchasing the same
equipments.
18.

That is not the end.

19.

Pertaining to Mr.Ashok Mittal it would be interesting

to note that he has handed over to the police a loan agreement
dated 14.2.2005; a hypothecation agreement of even date as
also a loan agreement dated 6.4.2005.
20.

The loan agreement dated 14.2.2005 records that

Neena Gulati proprietor of The Perfect Ten has taken a loan of
Rs.50 lacs from M/s.AGM Management Services Ltd. through its
Bail Appl. Nos.1882 & 1877/07

Page No.6 of 10

Director Ashok Mittal.

The second loan agreement dated

6.4.2005 likewise record a similar loan but in sum of Rs.20 lacs.
21.

Neena Gulati has prima facie tried to create

evidence in her favour by causing to be sent to the SHO PS
Vasant Kunj the complaint dated 28.2.2006, contents whereof
have been noted briefly in para 13 above, for the simple reason
the 2 loan agreements refer to the loans being advanced by
means of cheque No.717656 dated 14.2.2005 (Rs.50 lacs) and
cheque No.723628 dated 15.3.2005 (Rs.10 lacs) and cheque
No.725608 dated 6.4.2005 (Rs.10 lacs).
22.

The loan by M/s.AGM Management Services Ltd.

through Ashok Mittal are by means of cheques issued in the
months of February, March and April 2005, much before the
date when Neena Gulati wrote the complaint dated 28.2.2006.
23.

Prima facie, Neena Gulati has duly executed the loan

agreements relied upon by Ashok Mittal. The loan agreements
are

contemporaneous

documents.

They

find

inherent

sustenance with reference to the dates of the negotiable
instrument i.e. the cheques by means of which loan in sum of
Rs.70 lacs was taken by Neena Gulati.
24.

Thus, it is not a case where, for the same

equipments, Neena Gulati has duped 2 persons but it is a case
where for the same equipments Neena Gulati has duped 3
Bail Appl. Nos.1882 & 1877/07

Page No.7 of 10

persons.
25.

Not only that.

An account was opened with State

Bank of Patiala, Patel Nagar Branch in the name of PM
Enterprises showing one Mr.Rajan as the sole proprietor
thereof.

Address of PM Enterprises disclosed to the bank is

premises No.6/15 East Patel Nagar, New Delhi.
26.

It is not in dispute that Neena Gulati was operating a

fitness and slimming centre from said place. I find a reference
to said address in Neena Gulati's complaint dated 28.2.2006
made to the SHO PS Vasant Kunj.
27.

Money was transferred to the account in the name of

PM Enterprises from the account of The Perfect Ten with the
Central Bank of India, Greater Kailash Branch and was
withdrawn from the said account.
28.

It would be interesting to note that the account with

State Bank of Patiala was opened on 1.10.2004. The account
was closed on 30.12.2004. Rs.55,31,450/- which were credited
in the account were withdrawn between 29.10.2004 to
30.12.2004 i.e. in 2 months.
29.

Prima facie, the account in question with State Bank

of Patiala was opened to siphon away the money from the
account of The Perfect Ten by transferring money to the
account at State Bank of Patiala and thereafter withdraw the
Bail Appl. Nos.1882 & 1877/07

Page No.8 of 10

same.
30.

Rajan, the stated sole proprietor of PM Enterprises is

absconding. In her disclosure statement made to the police on
25.7.2007 Neena Gulati has stated that Rajan was her
employee.
31.

Neena Gulati has taken Rs.70 lacs from the company

of Ashok Mittal. She has taken Rs.56.729 lacs from K.S.Tomar.
She has availed of credit facilities worth nearly Rs.50 lacs from
the Central Bank of India. She has prima facie taken money
from 3 parties for purchase of same equipments. Opening of
the account by Rajan in the name of PM Enterprises and
transfer of funds to said account and withdrawal of the funds in
less than 2 months makes it a serious offence.
absconding.

Rajan is

Harpal Singh Ahuja who credited the equitable

mortgage of the flat is absconding. If Neena Gulati is released
on bail there is every possibility that either she would abscond
or would connive with the co-accused persons.
32.

I may note that charge-sheet has been filed in FIR

No.435/06.
33.

Notwithstanding investigation being complete in said

FIR, considering the seriousness of the charges against Neena
Gulati and the fact that nearly Rs.1.5 crores has been
misappropriated by her I hold that no case is made out to
Bail Appl. Nos.1882 & 1877/07

Page No.9 of 10

release Neena Gulati on bail.
34.

Both the applications are dismissed.
