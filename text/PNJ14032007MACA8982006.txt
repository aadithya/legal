1.

A short question arises for consideration in the

present appeal.
2.

Determining compensation under Section 163-A of

the M.V.Act 1988, can the Tribunal assess compensation in
excess of an annual income of Rs.40,000/- as stipulated in the
IInd schedule to the M.V.Act 1988?
3.

In view of the decision of the Supreme Court reported

as 1 (2004) ACC 728, Deepal Girishbhai Soni & Ors. vs. United
India Insurance Co. Ltd., the answer is in the negative.
4.

Since the question afore-noted stand conclusively

answered by the Supreme Court, I need not pen down a

MAC APP.No.898/2006

lengthy judgment.
5.

Suffice would it be to note that in Deepal Girishbhai

Soni's case (supra) Supreme Court referred to the legislative
history of the law pertaining to awarding compensation to
victims and/or their families due to injuries or death suffered
by reason of rashness or negligence on the part of the driver of
a motor vehicle. It was noted that law as originally enacted
required compensation to be paid only on proof that the
accident was a result of rash or negligent driving of a motor
vehicle by the driver concerned. Exceptions were carved out
when Section 140 was inserted in the statute book on the
promulgation of the M.V.Act 1988.

Further exception was

carved out when Section 163-A was introduced in the statute
book in November 1994.
6.

It was noted that Section 140 and Section 163-A did

not require proof of rashness or negligence. It was enough to
prove that the death or injury was occasioned due to use of a
motor vehicle.

In para 36 -37 of the opinion in Deepal

Girishbhai Soni's case (supra) following was observed:“36.
Section 163-A was introduced in the Act
by way of a social security scheme. It is a code by
itself. It appears from the objects and reasons of
the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1994 that
after enactment of the 1988 Act several
representations and suggestions were made from
the State Governments, transport operators and
members of public in relation to certain provisions
thereof. Taking note of the observations made by
the various provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act,
the Government of India appointed a Review
MAC APP.No.898/2006

page 2 of 8

Committee. The Review Committee in its report
made the following recommendations:
“The 1988 Act provides for enhanced
compensation for hit and run cases as well
as for no fault liability case.
It also
provides for payment of compensation on
proof-of-fault basis to the extent of actual
liability incurred which ultimately means an
unlimited liability in accident cases. It is
found
that
the
determination
of
compensation takes a long time. According
to information available in Delhi alone
there are 11214 claims pending before the
Motor Vehicle Accidents Tribunals, as on
31.3.1990.
Proposals have been made
from time to time that the finalisation of
compensation claims would be greatly
facilitated to the advantage of the
claimant, the vehicle owner as well as the
Insurance Company if a system of
structured compensation that is payable for
different clauses of cases depending upon
the age of the deceased, the monthly
income at the time of the death, the
earning potential in the case of the minor,
loss of income on account of loss of limb
etc., can be notified. The affected party
can then have the option of either
accepting the lump sum compensation as
is notified in that scheme of structured
compensation or of pursuing his claim
through the normal channels.
The General Insurance Company with
whom the matter was taken up, is
aggreeable in principle to a scheme of
structured compensation for settlement of
claims on “fault liability” in respect of third
party liability under Chapter XI of M.V.Act,
1988.
They have suggested that the
claimants should first file their claims with
Motor Accident Claims Tribunals and then
the insurers may be allowed six months
time to confirm their prima facie liability
subject to the defences available under
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
After such
confirmations of prima facie liability by the
insurers the claimants should be required
MAC APP.No.898/2006

page 3 of 8

to exercise their option for conciliation
under structured compensation formula
within a stipulated time.”

7.

37.
The recommendations of the Review
Committee and representations from public were
placed before the Transport Development Council
for seeking their views pursuant whereto several
sections were amended.
Section 163-A was
inserted in the Act to provide for payment of
compensation in motor accident cases in
accordance with the Second Schedule providing for
the structured formula which may be amended by
the Central Government from time to time.”
In paras 43-45 following was observed:“43.
Section 163-A which has an overriding
effect provides for special provisions as to payment
of compensation on structured formula basis. Subsection (1) of Section 163-A contains non-obstante
clause in terms whereof the owner of the motor
vehicle or the authorized insurer is liable to pay in
the case of death or permanent disablement due to
accident arising out of the use of motor vehicle,
compensation, as indicated in the Second
Schedule, to the legal heirs or the victim, as the
case may be, Sub-section (2) of Section 163-A is in
pari materia Sub-section (3) of Section 140 of the
Act.
44.
Section 163-A does not contain any
provision identical to Sub-section (5) of Section 140
which is also indicative of the fact that whereas in
terms of the latter, the liability of the owner of the
vehicle to give compensation or relief under any
other law for the time being in force continues
subject of course to the effect that the amount paid
thereunder shall be reduced from the amount of
compensation payable under the said section or
Section 163-A.
45.
By reason of the Section 163-A, therefore,
the compensation is required to be determined on
the basis of a structured formula whereas in terms
of Section 140 only a fixed amount is to be given. A
provision of law providing for compensation is
presumed to be final in nature unless a contra
indication therefor is found to be in the statute
either expressly or by necessary implication. While

MAC APP.No.898/2006

granting compensation, the Tribunal is required to
adjudicate upon the disputed question as regard
age and income of the deceased or the victim, as
the case may be. Unlike Section 140 of the Act,
adjudication on several issues arising between the
parties is necessary in a proceeding under Section
163-A of the Act.”
It may be that the M.V.Act 1988 is a beneficial

legislation and, thus, deserves liberal construction with a view
to implement the legislative intent but Courts cannot travel
beyond the enacted provisions and extend the scope of the
statute on the pretext of exceeding the statutory benefits to
those who are not covered thereby or exceeding the limits of
compensation.
9.

It is thus obvious that the IInd schedule referred to in

Section 163-A of the M.V.Act 1988 provides for a structured
formula which has to be applied while assessing compensation
to a third party involved in a fatal accident/injury. A multiplier
system is introduced, pursuant whereto and in furtherance
whereof the compensation has to be calculated having regard
to the age of the victim or the dependents as also the annual
income of the deceased/injured.
10.

The

same

has

to

be

reduced

by

1/3rd,

in

consideration of the expenses which the victim would have
incurred towards maintaining himself, had he been alive.
11.

In the instant case, monthly income of the deceased

as established at the trial was Rs.3,000/- per month. He was
aged 26 years.

MAC APP.No.898/2006

page 5 of 8

12.

Referring to the decisions of the Supreme Court and

in particular the decision reported as AIR 1996 SC 1272, Sarla
Dixit vs. Balwant Yadav, the learned Tribunal granted benefit
of future increase in the earnings, noting that since income of
the deceased was determined with reference to the minimum
wages, since minimum wages increase from time to time to
neutralize inflation, therefore, loss of dependence had to be
determined with reference to futuristic increase in the
minimum wages.

Thus, for computing loss of dependence

assumed income has been treated as Rs.4500/- per month.
13.

Claimants before the Tribunal were the mother and

the father of the deceased. He was a bachelor. Father having
died during the pendency of the claim petition, only mother
pursued the same.
14.

From the affidavit filed towards examination-in-chief

by the mother on 2.9.2004 it is apparent that her age was 51
years when she filed the affidavit.
15.

Multiplier adopted by the Tribunal is 18 as deceased

was in the age group between 25-30 years.
16.

The insurance company is aggrieved on 2 counts.

Firstly, since compensation assessed was under Section 163-A
of the M.V.Act, no future increase in income could be taken
note of and secondly the multiplier adopted is excessive.
17.

On the issue of multiplier, suffice would it be to note

that there are various decisions of the Supreme Court noting
MAC APP.No.898/2006

page 6 of 8

defects and deficiencies in the multiplier table contained in the
IInd schedule.

It has been held that the multiplier has to be

applied with modifications and not only the age of the
deceased but even the dependent has to be considered.
18.

Noting the law that where compensation assessed is

under Section 163-A of the M.V.Act 1988, benefit of income
more than Rs.40,000/- per annum cannot be granted, noting
that the proved income of the deceased was Rs.3,000/- per
month i.e. Rs.36,000/- per annum,

deducting 1/3rd as the

personal expenses of the deceased I take the loss of
dependence at Rs.24,000/- per annum
19.

Accident took place on 8.4.2000, which proved fatal.

Further noting that the mother deposed in September 2004
and stated that she was aged 51 years as of said date, age of
the mother as on date of accident is between 46 to 47 years. I
treat the same as 46 years.
20.

Appropriate multiplier has to be 11.

21.

Thus, loss of dependence to the mother comes to

Rs.2,64,000/-.
22.

The Tribunal has assessed the same at Rs.4,86,000/-.

23.

Thus,

I

reduce

compensation

payable

Rs.2,22,000/-.

Deducting

Rs.2,22,000/-, compensation awardable is determined at
MAC APP.No.898/2006

page 7 of 8

Rs.2,94,000/-.
25.

The appeal accordingly stands disposed of holding

that in the instant case, total compensation payable to
respondent No.1 due to unfortunate death of her son Ravinder
Kumar is payable in sum of Rs.2,94,000/-.

The same shall

carry interest as per the award.
26.

As per the award, 70% of the compensation payable

would be invested in a fixed deposit with a nationalized bank
or in a post office scheme, where from maximum interest can
be generated.

Remaining would be forthwith paid over to

respondent No.1.
27.

Noting that while issuing notice to show cause, only

25% of the compensation assessed by the Tribunal was
directed to be released on pro rata basis as per the award,
which sum has been released, I direct that the further sum
payable

in

terms

of

the

present

decision

would

be

paid/disbursed as afore directed within 30 days from today.
28.

Interest on the sum retained by way of a fixed

deposit with a nationalized or in a post office scheme would be
permitted to be withdrawn by respondent No.1.
29.

No costs.
