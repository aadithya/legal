ORDER
07.04.2008
A temporary allotment in favour of the petitioner was made vide letter

dated 4th June, 1990. The temporary allotment letter stipulates that no
structure shall be constructed on the site and the petitioner will park six
taxies. The allotment was for a period of one year upto 31st March, 1991,
subject to renewal and execution of licence deed. The allotment letter also
stipulates licence fee @ Rs.250 per month for installation of wooden booth
of the size 4x4 feet size, shall be paid.
2.

It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondent-DDA that

the said licence expired on 1st April, 1991 and thereafter the petitioner did
not make any request for renewal. No licence deed has been executed. It
is admitted that thereafter no allotment in favour of the petitioner has been

made.

The petitioner had deposited a sum of Rs.3,000/- in 1996 and

thereafter another sum of Rs.9,000/- was deposited on 18th March, 2005.
Last payment of Rs.6,000/- was deposited on 14th November, 2007, just
before filing of the present writ petition. There is no deposit between the
period 1996 till 2005.
3.

The respondent have also pointed out in their counter affidavit that

permission to park six taxies was granted and the term of licence expired
on 31st March, 1991. In fact, it was found that the petitioner was parking
abour forty taxies in the said area.
4.

In these circumstances, I do not find any merit in the present writ

petition and the same is dismissed.

However, it is clarified that the

petitioner will be entitled to apply for allotment of a taxi stand in terms of
policy framed by DDA.
