JUDGMENT
Per Thakur, J(oral)

1.

This Petition is an utter abuse of the process of this Court. It is

directed against two orders, one of which is passed by the DRT and the
other by the Appellate Tribunal, dismissing an application filed by the
petitioners seeking rejection of the plaint on the ground that it disclosed
no cause of action against them.

2.

The genesis of the controversy lies in a claim made by three

financial institutions namely ICICI, IDBI and IFCI before the Debt

WP(C) 15318/2006

Page 1 of 6

Recovery Tribunal in which they have prayed for a decree against the
defendants including the Petitioners herein for the recovery of an amount
of over Rs.30 crores. The Petitioners are said to have executed deeds of
guarantee and created equitable mortgages for repayment of the loan
amount borrowed by a company that has gone sick and is presently
under liquidation in this Court. The financing institutions have, in that
background, sought a decree for recovery of the outstanding amount
before the DRT in which the Petitioners first moved IA No. 218/2001
seeking rejection of the plaint on the ground that it did not disclose any
cause of action against them. That application was dismissed by the DRT
on 14.05.2001.

3.

Aggrieved by the above order the petitioners appealed to the

Appellate Tribunal, which appeal was disposed of on 13.07.2001 without
interfering with the order of dismissal passed by the DRT. Liberty was,
however, given to the petitioners to file a fresh representation before the
Tribunal, if so advised. That is when the petitioners filed IA No. 534/2001
once again agitating the same issue and arguing that the plaint did not
disclose any cause of action against them. The Tribunal considered that
contention and rejected the same by a reasoned order dated 16.09.2002
in the following words:
“6.
I do not find any force in the contention of
the Ld. Counsel for the defendants no.2 to 5 that
OA is barred by limitation and is liable to be
dismissed. In the foreign currency loan of US $
617985 first agreement was executed on
30.04.1984. Subsequently, notes of amendment
were executed in respect of this loan itself on
11.2.1985, 14.7.1986 and 10.07.1987 respectively.
Supplemental head of agreement was executed on
WP(C) 15318/2006

Page 2 of 6

11.2.1985 and thereafter notes of amendment were
executed on 14.07.1986 and 10.07.1987. In respect
of additional foreign currency loan also equitable
mortgage was created on 9.5.1985. In respect of
rupee term loan agreement was executed on
9.5.1985 and thereafter a note of amendment was
also executed on 14.07.1987. Similarly, in respect
of additional rupee term loan the agreement was
executed on 14.7.1986. Equitable mortgage was
created on 14.7.1986. Cash Subsidy loan
agreement was executed on 18.8.1986. In shortterm loan agreement was executed on 27.10.1987.
In this loan category equitable mortgage was
created on 27.10.1987. It is apparent from the
above that in each facility the last document
executed was in the year 1986-87. All these
facilities were to be repaid in installments.
Equitable mortgage in respect of immoveable
property was involved, thus, period of limitation
would be 12 years. The proceedings remained
pending before the BIFR/AAIFR from 29.5.1995 to
24.2.1997 i.e. for almost two years. This period has
to be excluded in the period of limitation. If this
period excluded the OA filed on 19.8.1999 would
be well within the period of limitation. Besides this,
recall notice was issued to the defendant no.1 on
5.4.1999, whereas guarantee agreements were
invoked against the defendants no. 2 and 5 on
12.5.1999, therefore, period of limitation would
also commence from the date the loan was recalled
more so when immovable property was involved for
this reason also OA is well within the period of
limitation and cannot be dismissed merely on an
application filed by the defendants no.2 to 5. This
application is accordingly dismissed being devoid
of merits(emphasis supplied).

4.

Aggrieved by the above findings of the Tribunal, the Petitioners

appealed to the Appellate Tribunal which appeal also failed and was
dismissed by an order dated 19.07.2006. The Appellate Tribunal
observed:
“….7. Regarding first objection with regard to
non-disclosure of cause of action, as raised by the
learned counsel for the appellants, a reading of
Para 5 of the impugned order would disclose that
WP(C) 15318/2006

Page 3 of 6

the Tribunal has recorded that the cause of action
arose not only on each and every date when
agreements were executed in each credit facility
but also when defendant no.1 defaulted in making
payment of installment. Tribunal also recorded
that cause of action further arose when equitable
mortgage was created and/or extended, and that
lastly on 5.4.99 when applicants issued recall
notices to the defendant no.1 who was asked to
pay the due of the applicants. The Tribunal also
recorded
that
when
applicants
revoked
guarantees of the defendant no.2 to 5 on 12.9.99
cause of action arose. The Tribunal has, in Para 6
of the impugned order, taken note of the
execution of documents relating to the agreement
on 30.04.84 and subsequent notes of amendment
in respect of the loan itself on 11.2.85, 14.7.86
and 10.7.87 respectively and has held that cause
of action is disclosed by the respondent-financial
institution for filing the O.A…..”

5.

We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the

record. As seen above the entire controversy arises out of a suit being
tried by the Tribunal. The Plaintiff- financial institutions have already
concluded their evidence in the said suit. Defendants have now been
given an opportunity to lead their evidence in rebuttal. No progress,
however, is made in the suit for the past nearly 5 years on account of the
applications filed by the Petitioners alleging that no cause of action is
disclosed in the plaint against them. Apart from the fact that the
applications appear to us to be an attempt to gain time and prevent the
Tribunal from concluding the proceedings pending before it, we see no
merit in the contention that the OA does not disclose any cause of action
against the petitioners. As rightly observed by the Tribunal the
Petitioners have executed deeds of guarantee. The Tribunal has also
referred to various other documents to show that equitable mortgages

WP(C) 15318/2006

Page 4 of 6

were created in connection with the loan facilities availed by the
borrowing company. In the circumstances, the OA could not be said to be
disclosing no cause of action against the defendants, petitioners herein.
The contention of the Petitioners that the plaint deserved to be rejected
even when deeds of guarantee were executed by them needs notice only
to be rejected. The legal position as regards the approach to be adopted
in the matters while dealing with an application under Order 7 Rule 11
CPC is well settled by the Supreme Court in a catena of judgments. In

Vijai Pratap Singh vs. Dukh Haran Nath Singh, AIR 1962 SC 941,
paragraph 9, the Supreme Court held:
“….The court has not to see whether the claim
made by the petitioner is likely to succeed: it
has merely to satisfy itself that the allegations
made in the petition, if accepted as true, would
entitle the petitioner to the relief he claims. If
accepting those allegations as true no case is
made out for granting relief no cause of action
would be shown and the petition must be
rejected. But in ascertaining whether the
petition shows a cause of action the court does
not enter upon a trial of the issues affecting the
merits of the claim made by the petitioner. It
cannot take into consideration the defences
which the defendant may raise upon the merits;
nor is the court competent to make an elaborate
enquiry into doubtful or complicated questions
of law or fact. If the allegations in the petition,
prima facie, show a cause of action, the court
cannot embark upon an enquiry whether the
allegations are true in fact, or whether the
petitioner will succeed in the claims made by
him…..”
6.

In this regard reference may also be made to D.Ramachandran

vs. R.V.Janakiraman, (1999) 3 SCC, 267, paragraph 8, wherein the
Supreme Court held:
WP(C) 15318/2006

Page 5 of 6

“It is well settled that in all cases of preliminary
objection, the test is to see whether any of the
reliefs prayed for could be granted to the
appellant if the averments made in the petition
are proved to be true. For the purpose of
considering a preliminary objection, the
averments in the petition should be assumed to
be true and the court has to find out whether
those averments disclose a cause of action or a
triable issue as such. The court cannot probe
into the facts on the basis of the controversy
raised in the counter.”
7.

Further, in Liverpool & London S. P.

& I.Assn.Ltd.

M.V.Sea Success I and Anr., (2004) 9 SCC, 512,

vs.

paragraph 146, the

Court has observed:
“It may be true that Order 7 Rule 11(a)
although authorizes the court to reject a plaint
on failure on the part of the plaintiff to disclose
a cause of action by the same would not mean
that the averments made therein or a document
upon which reliance has been placed although
discloses a cause of action, the plaint would be
rejected on the ground that such averments are
not sufficient to prove the facts stated therein
for the purpose of obtaining reliefs claimed in
the suit.”
8.

There is no merit in the Writ Petition which fails and is dismissed

with costs of Rs.10,000/- (rupees ten thousand).
