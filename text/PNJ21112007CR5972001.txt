PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
Petitioner was the plaintiff. His suit was decreed ex-

parte. A composite application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the CPC
read with Section 5 of the Limitation Act was filed by the MCD
praying that the ex-parte decree dated 7.7.1999 be recalled and
the corporation be permitted to defend the suit on merits.
2.

The suit filed by the petitioner challenged the penalty

of reduction to the lower rank which was imposed after inquiry
officer found that the petitioner, a male nurse, had tried to
outrage the modesty of a colleague female nurse by grasping her

breast.
3.

Explaining reasons as to why the MCD could not

appear after it was served it was pleaded that one J.P.Dixit a
panel lawyer had been entrusted with the brief.

The written

statement was duly drafted and was filed but for unexplainable
reasons the lawyer stopped appearing.

That when decree was

put into execution the counsel concerned moved an application
under Section 47 CPC raising objections to the decree. It was only
thereafter that MCD realize that their counsels were behaving in a
most unprofessional manner by doing what they did.

It was

stated that being a statutory body MCD had to act through living
human beings.

The gravity of the misconduct of the petitioner

was pointed out in the application with prayer that the ex-parte
decree be set aside.
4.

Learned Trial Judge has noted the delay. Learned Trial

Judge has also noted that in between the decree was put into
execution and objections thereto were filed but has opined that
MCD should not suffer due to lack of professional diligence by the
counsel engaged by the MCD. Learned Trial

Judge has noted

the decision of the Supreme Court reported as State of Haryana
Vs. Chandramani (1996) 3 SCC 132.
5.

The view taken by the learned Trial Judge cannot be

called perverse.

6.

The petition invokes remedy under Section 115 CPC.

7.

Unless it is shown that the view taken by the learned

Trial Judge is perverse or that the learned Trial Judge has acted
with material irregularity or that the impugned order, if allowed to
stay, would occasion a miscarriage of justice it would be
impermissible for this court to intervene under its revisional
jurisdiction.
8.

No such infirmity has been shown.

9.

The petition is dismissed.

10.

Since considerable time has been consumed due to

pendency of the civil revision petition learned Trial Judge would
expedite hearing in the suit.
11.

No costs.
