1.

This application has been filed by the plaintiffs seeking leave to

amend the plaint. In order to appreciate the controversy between the parties,
it becomes necessary to notice a few factual details. The defendants herein
place reliance on an agreement to sell dated 8th June, 1970 executed by one
Shri Behu as co-sharer of land out of Khasra No.27, 3/2, 4/1, 7, 8, 12/1,
14/1 of Khasra No.42/8, village Karawal Nagar, Delhi. It was alleged that

IA No.7167/2005 in CS (OS) No.2430/2000

Page No.1

Shri Behu was owner of 1/3rd portion of land while 2/3rd was owned by
Arjun and Devi Sahay, who were sons of one Gagan. The defendants urged
that possession of 1/3rd of the share of the land was delivered to them
pursuant to the agreement to sell on the same date and since then was under
their cultivation and possession. Urging that their possession was being
interfered with, the defendants filed Suit No.3/458/29 (Suit No.458/1970)
for permanent injunction on 10th December, 1970 seeking a decree of
injunction against the defendants. This suit was decreed on the 17th May,
1980 and the plaintiffs were prohibited from dispossessing the defendants
from the afore-noticed land. This decision was affirmed in the appeal being
R.C.A. No.3/1980 by the judgment passed by the Additional Senior SubJudge dated 22nd April, 1981.
2.

The plaintiffs herein assailed the the judgment of the courts below in

this court by way of RSA No.181/1981. The decree dated 17th May, 1980
and the judgment dated 22nd April, 1981 in appeal was set aside by this court
by its judgment dated 8th December, 2000. Aggrieved thereby, the present
defendants had filed a special leave petition before the Apex Court which
was decided by an order dated 21st July, 2005.
3.

After the passing of the judgment dated 8th September, 2000 by this

IA No.7167/2005 in CS (OS) No.2430/2000

Page No.2

court in RSA No.181/1981 in their favour, the plaintiffs filed the present
suit on the 4th October, 2000 seeking relief of possession and damages
against the defendants on the following pleas:(i)

The predecessor of the plaintiffs had executed an agreement to sell
dated 8th June, 1970 with the predecessor-in-interest of the defendants
for a total consideration of Rs.13,800/-.

The defendants could not

pay the balance consideration of Rs.7,000/- within the stipulated
period.
(ii)

The agreement to sell contained the clause that time was of the
essence of contract and upon failure to pay the balance consideration
and registration of sale deed, the defendants had the right to get the
contract specifically performed by the court of law.

(iii) Upon failure to make payment, the owner of the property had the
contractual right to forfeit the earnest money which was done as the
defendants and their predecessor-in-interest neither paid the money
nor sought specific performance of the contract.
(iv)

Since 30 years had passed, the defendants were not entitled to
specific performance and that a mere agreement to sell does not
confer right, title or interest in favour of the person in whose favour it

IA No.7167/2005 in CS (OS) No.2430/2000

Page No.3

has been executed.
(v)

The agreement to sell has never been acted upon by the parties.

4.

On these pleas, it was urged that the defendants had no valid right to

continue to remain in possession of the property and consequently, it was
contended that their possession was illegal and unauthorised and they were
liable to hand over possession and to pay damages to the tune of Rs.2.5
lakhs to the plaintiffs. The suit was based on the plea that cause of action
for filing the suit arose upon the passing of the order dated 8th September,
2000 in RSA No.181/1981 by this court.
5.

The admission/denial of documents was conducted in the matter as

back as on 21st November, 2003. The matter has, thereafter, remained
pending for framing of issues.
6.

It appears that the appeal filed by the defendants against the judgment

dated 8th September, 2000 was taken up for consideration before the Apex
Court on the 21st July, 2005 when, after noticing the facts of the case, the
court passed the following order:“xxx

xxx

Heard counsel for the parties.
Counsel for the respondents fairly admitted
IA No.7167/2005 in CS (OS) No.2430/2000

Page No.4

today before us that the appellants are in actual
possession of the suit land and that the respondents
have already filed a suit for possession against the
appellants in the court of competent jurisdiction.
Without going into the merits of the dispute
including the question as to whether the appellants
were given possession of the suit land in pursuance of
the Agreement of Sale dated 8th June, 1970; or
whether their possession is legal or illegal, leaving
the question of law open, this being a settled
proposition of law that nobody can be dispossessed
from the settled possession except in accordance with
law, we dispose of this appeal with observation that
the appellants would not be dispossessed from the
suit land except in accordance with law. No costs.
Needless to mention nothing stated in this order
shall be taken as expression of opinion on merits of
the case and the pending suit for possession shall be
proceeded with and decided without being influenced
by any of the observations made hereinabove.”
7.

It is noteworthy that in the present suit, the plaintiffs had filed a

replication on the 4th March, 2002 reiterating the submissions made in the
plaint and contending that the title of the parties to the suit was to be
decided in the present suit which was not the subject matter of the special
leave petition.

In paras 17 & 18 of the replication, the plaintiffs stated

thus:“The contents of paras 17 & 18 of the written
statement are wrong and denied and the
IA No.7167/2005 in CS (OS) No.2430/2000

Page No.5

corresponding paras of the plaint i.e. paras 6 & 7 of
the plaint are reaffirmed. It is categorically denied
that the pendency of SLP render the present suit
infructuous. It is submitted that the pendency of SLP
does not effect the present suit infructuous because in
the present suit, the title of the parties on the suit land
are to be decided which is not at all the subject matter
of the SLP. Thus, if the suit is finally decreed, the
relief of decree of permanent injunction claimed by
the defendants-granted by the lower court-set aside
by the Hon'ble High Court – assailed before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in SLP does not put an
embargo on the relief of possession as prayed by the
plaintiff in this suit. The suit of the plaintiff thus
deserves to be decreed as prayed for.
Prayer para of the written statement is wrong
and denied. The defendants have miserably been
failed to disclose any plausible defence and therefore
the suit of the plaintiffs deserve to be decreed with
costs as prayed for.”
The entire thrust of the replication was also that the agreement to sell
was actually executed but the transaction was not completed.
8.

In this background, the plaintiff has filed the present application on

4th September, 2005 asserting that the issue relating to the validity of the
agreement to sell was not challenged in the present suit prior hitherto as the
same was the subject matter of the special leave petition. The plaintiffs
have contended that the issues have been left open by the judgment dated
21st July, 2005 passed by the Apex Court and therefore, it has sought leave

IA No.7167/2005 in CS (OS) No.2430/2000

Page No.6

to amend the suit to incorporate a plea that an order was passed by the
Assistant Collector (Revenue) on the 24th April, 1972 holding that Biru, the
predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiffs, did not possess the land and that the
possession on the land was kept as before in the revenue records. The
plaintiffs have further sought amendment of the prayer clause seeking to
incorporate a prayer for a decree for declaration holding the agreement to
sell dated 8th June, 1970 produced by the defendant be declared as null and
void on the ground that the same has been manufactured, manipulated and
fabricated document.
9.

This application has been vehemently opposed on behalf of the

defendants who have pointed out that the plaintiffs had placed reliance on
an order dated 18th May, 1972 of the settlement officer which was
considered by the courts in the earlier litigation and that if the order dated
24th April, 1972 which has been raised for the first time in application dated
4th September, 2005, had really existed, the same would have been produced
earlier. It has also been contended that the plaintiffs' entire suit is based on
the plea that the agreement to sell dated 8th June, 1970 had been executed
which has not been challenged in any proceedings and that the plaintiffs
cannot be permitted to set up a completely new case by way of amendment
IA No.7167/2005 in CS (OS) No.2430/2000

Page No.7

raising a challenge at this highly belated stage. The defendants submits that
relief of declaration sought by the plaintiffs at this stage would have also
been barred by limitation.
10.

I have given my considered thoughts to the rival contentions. It is a

settled principle of law that no party has an unbridled and absolute right to
seek amendment of the pleadings. In the plaint filed by the plaintiffs, a
specific stand is that the defendants were not entitled to continue in
possession in as much as they did not abide by the requirement in the
agreement to make payment of the balance consideration and that no right,
title or interest passed in favour of the purchaser under the agreement to
sell.

It is on such pleas that the plaintiffs have sought a decree for

possession. This stand has been forcefully reiterated in the replication which
has been filed. The suit was filed by the plaintiff in the year 2000. There
was no challenge to the execution or the legality or the validity of the
agreement to sell in the plaint in any manner. In fact, the suit reproduces
clauses of the agreement in support of the submission that the predecessorin-interest of the defendants had breached the terms thereof. Certainly, by
the challenge as is sought to be incorporated by the proposed amendment to
the agreement, the plaintiffs are seeking to urge an entirely new case. This
IA No.7167/2005 in CS (OS) No.2430/2000

Page No.8

is clearly impermissible in law. It is noteworthy that a relief based on such
pleas would today even be barred by limitation
11.

Vide the order dated 21st July, 2005, the Supreme Court had left only

the issue as to the manner in which the defendants came into possession,
open which would be the issue which requires adjudication in the present
matter. The special leave petition was disposed of by the Apex Court on the
21st July, 2005 on the plea of the present plaintiffs before the Supreme Court
that they had filed a suit for possession against the appellants in this court.
Therefore, the plea of the plaintiffs that the amendment has been
necessitated on the ground that the same was permitted or left open by the
Apex Court, is wholly misconceived and is not borne out from the judgment
of the Apex Court dated 21st July, 2005.
12.

So far as the purported order dated 24th April, 1972 of the revenue

officer is concerned, no such order has ever been pleaded by the plaintiffs or
the predecessor-in-interest in any of the proceedings. No such order was
ever relied upon by the parties before any court prior thereto.

The

defendants have submitted that if such order had existed, it would have been
produced. Such an order has been set up in order to defeat the plea of the
defendants with regard to their having been put in possession by the
IA No.7167/2005 in CS (OS) No.2430/2000

Page No.9

predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiffs. There is not an iota of explanation
as to why, if such order dated 24th April, 1972 actually existed, it had not
been averred or produced for all these years. Certainly, the order would
have had material bearing on the adjudication in the earlier litigation. There
is, therefore, force in the submission of the defendants that the application is
mala fide.
13.

Undoubtedly, principles governing adjudication on an application

seeking amendment of pleadings mandate that amendments essential for
complete adjudication of the plaint, should be liberally permitted. However,
the courts have repeatedly cautioned that proposed amendments of
pleadings setting up a new case, taking away admissions of fact and vested
rights of the other side, shall not be permitted. While the merits of the pleas
proposed to be incorporated cannot be examined while adjudicating an
application seeking leave to amend, it has been held that court shall not
permit a plea which is sought to be raised mala fide.
14.

In my view, the pleas proposed to be incorporated by the plaintiff

cannot be permitted for all the foregoing reasons.
I find no merit in this application which is hereby dismissed.
By this application, the plaintiffs have delayed adjudication in the suit
IA No.7167/2005 in CS (OS) No.2430/2000

Page No.10

and, therefore, has to be burdened with costs which are quantified at
Rs.5,000/-. The costs shall be paid by the plaintiffs in equal shares to the
counsel for the defendants and the National Legal Aid Fund (NALSA)
within a period of two weeks from today.
