CM No.15552/2005 in W.P(C) No.3103/1999

1.

This is an application filed by the respondent/workman under

Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking direction to
the petitioner to pay full monthly last drawn wages to the
applicant/respondent during the pendency of the writ petition.
2.

The respondent/applicant contended that he has been out of

job and has not been employed in any establishment since the date of

CM No.15552/2005 in W.P(C) No.3103/1999

Page 1 of 8

termination of his services by the petitioner/non applicant and that
he has not been getting any remuneration and has no other means of
livelihood. In the circumstances the applicant has prayed that he be
paid full monthly wages with effect from 8th January, 1998 the date of
the award.
3.

A reply has been filed on behalf of petitioner/non applicant

denying the plea of the respondent that he is jobless since 1986. The
petitioner contended that since the applicant/respondent was holding
a license for driving heavy vehicles therefore the plea that the
respondent/workman was not getting any remuneration and had no
means of livelihood is not true. The petitioner alleged that the
respondent was in fact gainfully employed and was engaged in the
profession of property dealer in the area of Nangli Skarawati and in
support of its plea the petitioner stated that the respondent is a owner
of a Car, a two wheeler scooter and also has a mobile phone which
cannot be maintained by a person who is not gainfully employed and
thus the

application of the respondent under section 17B of the

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is not maintainable and that the relief
as prayed for in the application cannot be granted. The petitioner also
pleaded that the respondent be directed to disclose his employment
details.
4.

Provisions of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

CM No.15552/2005 in W.P(C) No.3103/1999

Page 2 of 8

comes into operation when an Award directing reinstatement of a
workman is assailed in further proceedings. The statute requires
satisfaction of the following four conditions:
(i)

(ii)

during the pendency of such proceedings, employer
is required to pay full wages to the workman;

(iii)

the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any
maintenance allowance admissible to him under
any Rule;

(iv)

5.

an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in proceedings in a High Court or the
Supreme Court;

such wages would be admissible only if the
workman had not been employed in any
establishment during such period and an affidavit
had been filed to such effect.

While considering an application under this provision it is

necessary to bear in mind that the spirit, intendment and object
underlying the statutory provision of Section 17B is to mitigate and
relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship resulting to a workman due
to delay in the implementation of an award directing reinstatement of
his services on account of the challenge made to it by the employer.
The preliminary consideration for making available such a relief to a
workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment.
It recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body
and soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award
directing his reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no
CM No.15552/2005 in W.P(C) No.3103/1999

Page 3 of 8

inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment which is required to be
made by the employer to the workman has been held to be akin to a
subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor recoverable
from a workman even if the Award in his favor is set aside by the High
Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T.
Patel the Apex Court was of the view that the object under Section
17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain
extent, the hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay
in implementation of the Award.
6.

While considering an application under Section 17B of the

Industrial Disputes Act, the Court cannot go into the merits of the
case in the writ petition. It was so held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5)
AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander. Since the section itself
mentions ‘employment in establishment’ self employment quite
apparently is not in contemplation. Workman can be denied the
benefits under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act only when it
is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the workmen has been
employed and has been receiving adequate remuneration during the
period of pendency of the writ petition. It is thus well settled that
transient employment by the workman does not affect his entitlement
to receive wages pending decision; that is to say that, the benefit of
Section 17B of the Act cannot be denied merely because the workman

Page 4 of 8

is engaged in some activity or in some vocation to eke out his
livelihood. Such relief can be denied only if it is proved that the
workman is gainfully employed in some establishment and is
receiving adequate and regular remuneration which is not the case
with the applicant.
7.

The plea raised by the petitioner that the applicant has a

license and a car and a mobile phone is without any particulars and
is based on the assumption on behalf of the petitioner. On the basis of
these allegations made by the petitioner in the reply to the
application, it cannot be inferred that the respondent is gainfully
employed in an establishment as contemplated under Section 17 B of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 so as to deny him the relief of grant
of last drawn wages or minimum wages which so ever is higher.
8.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51, Town Municipal, Athani v. P.O.
LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman has a
legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot
be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act
for enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was concerned
with the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the Court would
have a bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well. From a

CM No.15552/2005 in W.P(C) No.3103/1999

Page 5 of 8

conspectus of the authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court,
the right of a workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified
under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of
the constitutional mandate and nothing more. It is undoubtedly, the
bare minimum which is required by the workman to subsist and is
nothing more. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean all the
wages that have fallen due at least from the date of the Award.
9.

This also cannot be disputed that granting relief under Section

17B of the Act and passing orders directing payment of wages last
drawn, is generally the rule; refusing to grant relief under Section 17B
is an exception, as it could be passed only in the rarest of the rare
cases of jurisdictional error where there is no relationship between the
parties.
10.

In the present case the applicant has contended that he is not

employed in any establishment since the date of termination of his
services. Regarding the plea of the applicant that he is not gainfully
employed since the date of termination of his services, the denial by
the petitioner is bald without any particulars. Rather it is contended
that the applicant should be directed to disclose his employment
details.

The petitioner/non applicant has also not disclosed any

material facts to show that the applicant is gainfully employed and he
is not entitled for last drawn back wages from the date of the award.

CM No.15552/2005 in W.P(C) No.3103/1999

Thus, the applicant fulfills the criteria for availing the benefit under
section 17B of the Act.
11.

Consequently, the application of the workman/respondent

under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is allowed and
the petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or the minimum
wages as may be applicable from time to time whichever is higher
from

the

date

of

the

award

i.e.

8th

January,

1998

to

the

respondent/workman. The arrears of the last drawn wages or the
minimum wages whichever is higher be paid within 30 days. The
petitioner shall continue to pay the wages in future by 10th of every
month during the pendency of the petition. The respondent is also
directed to file an undertaking that in case the petition is allowed and
it is held that the petitioner is not entitled for minimum wages then
difference in the minimum wages and the last drawn wages shall be
refunded/returned by the respondent within the time allowed by this
Court.

The

undertaking

to

this

effect

be

filed

by

the

respondent/applicant within two weeks. With these directions the
application is allowed.
W.P(C) No.3103/1999
Rule has already been issued in the matter on 10th August,
2007. The record of the lower Court be called for.
