MADAN B. LOKUR, J.

The Delhi Development Authority (for short DDA) is aggrieved
by a judgment and order dated 17th August, 2007 passed by a learned
Single Judge in WP(C) No. 8464/2006.
2.

The broad facts of the case are that the Respondent, his mother

and wife purchased a property bearing No.7, Community Centre, East of
Kailash, New Delhi in an open auction held by the DDA on 10th August,
1969. Possession of the property was then given to the purchasers and a
lease deed was also executed in their favour by the DDA.
3.

After the demise of the Respondent’s mother and wife, the

property devolved upon the Respondent and other legal heirs.
4.

On 17th February, 2004 the Respondent and other legal heirs

requested the DDA to mutate the property in their favour. In response,
the DDA sent a letter dated 20th May, 2004 raising a demand for misuse
charges to the extent of Rs.1.78 crores for the period from 30th July,
1983 to 5th February, 2003. It was stated by the DDA that in the event
misuse charges were not paid, action would be taken in respect of the
property under the terms and conditions of the lease deed.

The

Respondent was also asked by the DDA to remove the misuse. The

LPA No. 22/2008

Page 2 of 9

Respondent represented against the demand but it was impliedly turned
down by the DDA when by its letter dated 22nd September, 2005 it
reiterated its demand for misuse charges. It was at that stage that the
Respondent filed a writ petition in this Court.
5.

The stand of the DDA in its counter affidavit is to the effect that

the Respondent had misused the basement from 30 th July, 1983 till 5th
February, 2003; the mezzanine floor was misused from 20 th June, 1990
till 5th February, 2003 and the terrace was misused from 7th September,
1992 till 13th January, 2003. It was stated by the DDA that as many as
14 show cause notices were issued to the Respondent from time to time.
6.

The Respondent in his rejoinder affidavit offered an explanation in

respect of each instance of misuse and also referred to certain decisions
in his favour.
7.

It appears that during the pendency of the writ petition, the DDA

agreed that the question of mutation may be delinked from payment of
misuse charges and that issue was then sorted out by the learned Single
Judge in his order dated 21st April, 2007.
8.

Thereafter, two questions remained for adjudication by the learned

Single Judge: the first question pertained to the power of the DDA to
demand misuse charges while the second pertained to the validity of the
LPA No. 22/2008

Page 3 of 9

demand of misuse charges.
9.

Insofar as first question is concerned, we do not propose to go into

its merits and leave that issue open. This is because with regard to the
validity of the demand, we are in agreement with the learned Single
Judge that the DDA has clearly erred.
10.

What is required to be seen, as pointed out by the learned Single

Judge, is that a show cause notice alleging misuse should be issued to
the Respondent; the Respondent should have admitted or denied the
allegations made in the show cause notice; a decision should be taken on
the show cause notice (if the contents are denied); and finally a demand
should be raised on the basis of the adjudication order passed on the
show cause notice.
11.

In so far as the present case is concerned, show cause notices were

issued to the Respondent, to which he replied, but no orders were passed
thereon. This is clear from the facts given below.
12.

The first show cause notice was issued to the Respondent on 8th

August, 1983 regarding misuse of the basement.

The Respondent

submitted a reply on 10th August, 1983 but no decision was taken by the
DDA on that show cause notice.
13.

In June, 1990 the property was inspected by the DDA and some

LPA No. 22/2008

Page 4 of 9

non-conforming use was observed with regard to the basement, ground
floor and mezzanine floor. A show cause notice dated 28th June, 1990
was issued to the Respondent only in respect of the alleged misuse of
basement and mezzanine floor. The Respondent sent a reply to the show
cause notice but again no decision was taken by the DDA. After the
response given by the Respondent, all that happened was that the DDA
issued `final’ notices to the Respondent on 3rd September, 1990 and 11th
December, 1990 requiring him to stop violation of the conditions of the
lease deed failing which it would be terminated. The Respondent sent a
reply to the first `final’ notice on 5th November, 1990 but again no
decision was taken on any of the two `final’ notices sent to the
Respondent.
14.

The property was again inspected by the DDA on 31 st December,

1990 and although it appears that there was some alleged misuse or nonconforming use of the property, no show cause notice was issued to the
Respondent.
15.

A third inspection was carried out of the property on 24 th April,

1991 and some misuse was noticed in the basement, ground floor and the
mezzanine floor. It was also observed that the first floor, second floor
and third floor were being used as offices. However, a show cause
LPA No. 22/2008

Page 5 of 9

notice dated 8th May, 1991 was issued only in respect of the alleged
misuse of the mezzanine floor. The Respondent replied to the show
cause notice but again the DDA did not take any further steps for passing
an order on the show cause notice.
16.

On 16th September, 1992, a show cause notice was issued to the

Respondent with regard to unauthorized construction of two rooms on
the terrace. The Respondent replied to the show cause notice stating that
the tenant had raised the unauthorized construction without his consent
and that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi had been asked to demolish
the unauthorized construction. No further action was taken on this show
cause notice by the DDA. On 11th August, 1994, yet another show cause
notice was issued to the Respondent which was again replied to but no
decision was taken. Two final show cause notices were issued to the
Respondent on 28th November, 1994 and 11th January, 1995 requiring
the Respondent to remove the alleged breaches but again no follow up
action was taken by the DDA pursuant to these notices.
17.

All these facts would show that till 11th January, 1995 allegations

were made against the Respondent regarding misuse of the basement and
mezzanine floor and several show cause notices were issued to him. No
show cause notice was issued to him thereafter. The Respondent replied
LPA No. 22/2008

Page 6 of 9

to almost all these notices, but there was no determination by the DDA
at any point of time on any of the notices after the replies given by the
Respondent that there was no misuse of the property or that there were
no breaches of the lease deed.
18.

As regards the terrace, a show cause notice was issued to the

Respondent first on 16th September, 1992, as mentioned above, but
despite a reply having been given by the Respondent, no order was
passed by the DDA. A further show cause notice was issued on 11 th
August, 1994 regarding misuse of the basement, the mezzanine floor and
unauthorized construction of three rooms on the terrace.

This was

followed by two final show cause notices dated 28 th November, 1994
and 11th January, 1995 repeating the allegations but again despite the
Respondent having given a reply to the show cause notice dated 11 th
August, 1994, no determination took place insofar as the Respondent is
concerned.
19.

It may be worthwhile to mention here that the alleged misuse was

being committed by the tenants of the Respondent and it has come on
record that the Respondent had initiated action against his tenants for
vacating the premises. In fact it has been mentioned by the learned
Single Judge that one of the tenants had vacated the mezzanine floor on
LPA No. 22/2008

Page 7 of 9

1st December, 1991 and legal proceedings were also initiated against the
tenants on the ground floor as well as terrace. We have been informed
that the tenants have since been evicted by the Respondent.
20.

The facts mentioned above clearly go to show that despite

allegations of misuse of the property and issuance of show cause notices,
the DDA has not taken any final decision as a result of the replies given
from time to time by the Respondent. It has also been noticed by the
learned Single Judge that in none of the show cause or `final’ notices has
the Respondent been informed that the DDA is proposing to levy misuse
charges against him.

It is, therefore, not possible to accept the

contention of learned counsel for the DDA that since no limitation has
been prescribed for recovery of misuse charges, the DDA is not at fault
in keeping the matter pending or, as was submitted, by being lenient to
the Respondent.
21.

It is trite law that where no period of limitation is prescribed,

action must be taken by the authorities within a reasonable period of
time. Reference in this regard can be made to a decision of the Supreme
Court in State of Punjab v. Bhatinda District Coop. MIL P. Union Ltd.,
[2007] 11 SCC 363 wherein it has been held that if no period of
limitation is prescribed, a statutory authority must exercise its
LPA No. 22/2008

Page 8 of 9

jurisdiction within a reasonable period. What should be the reasonable
period depends upon the nature of the statute, rights and liabilities
thereunder and other relevant factors. By no stretch of imagination, it
can be said today after a lapse of almost 25 years (and in any case at
least 10 years) that the DDA has not acted arbitrarily or at least unfairly
insofar as the Respondent is concerned. Moreover, as noticed above, the
Respondent was never informed by the DDA that he was required to pay
any misuse charges.
22.

Under the circumstances, we are of the opinion that the learned

Single Judge was right in coming to the conclusion that the demand of
misuse charges of Rs.1,78,85,001/- is unjustified and it has to be
quashed.
23.

The appeal is dismissed.
