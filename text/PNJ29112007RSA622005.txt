1.

defendant.
3.

Alleging that plaintiff was owner of property bearing

Municipal No.A-1/147-148, New Kondli, Delhi-110096 by virtue
of documents registered on 27.10.1995 plaintiff stated that
defendant was inducted as a tenant with respect to the show
room on the ground floor of the composite property.

That

letting was for a commercial purpose at a monthly rent of
Rs.4500/-. That rent up to May 1999 was paid and with effect
from 1.6.1999 defendant was in arrears of rent. That rent for
the months of April and May 1999 was paid vide cheque
No.320660

and

320666

drawn

on

Corporation

Bank,

Vasundhara Enclave. That tenancy was determined vide notice
dated 22.11.1999 sent to the defendant on 24.11.1999. That
notice was received by the defendant on 27.11.1999.
4.

The suit in question was instituted on 16.12.1999.

5.

Before noting the defence a fact may be noted.

Date

when tenancy commenced has not been stated in the plaint.
6.

In the written statement filed it was stated that the

plaintiff was not the owner of the property, but relationship of
landlord and tenant was admitted.

It was stated that the

agreed rent was Rs.1500/- per month + Rs.100/- towards
electricity charges. It was stated that since rent was less than
Rs.3500/- per month the civil court had no jurisdiction to
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.2 of 19

entertain the plaint which sought ejectment of the tenant.
Purpose of letting was admitted.
7.

Pertaining to the 2 cheques referred to in the plaint as

tender of rent for the month of April and May 1999 it was
pleaded that not only said 2 cheques but even cheque
No.320667 was issued in the name of the husband of the
plaintiff in respect of a business transaction. It was stated that
the husband of the plaintiff is a property dealer and a builder
and had advanced money to the defendant for supply and
affixing aluminium glazing and glass etc. for the reason
defendant was carrying on said business from the tenanted
premises.

The defendant did not execute the works and

returned the advance by tendering the 3 cheques.

That

cheque No.320667 was returned by husband of the plaintiff
and in lieu thereof Rs.4500/- was received by him in cash. The
other two cheques were encashed by the husband of the
plaintiff.
8.

Pertaining to the written statement it may be noted that

even the defendant did not disclose the date with effect where
from tenancy commenced.
9.

On the pleadings of the parties 5 issues were framed as

under :“1. Whether the suit property was let out to the
defendant @ Rs.1,500/- per month + Rs.100/- as
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.3 of 19

electricity charges. If so whether the suit is barred
by section 50 of the Delhi Rent Control Act? (OPD)
2.
Whether the suit premises is let out to the
defendant @ Rs.4500/- if so, whether the plaintiff is
entitled for seeking possession of the suit property
as per provision of Transfer of Property Act? (OPP)
3.
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to mesne
profits and damages, if so, at what rate? (OPP)
4.
Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the interest
as claimed in the plaint, if so, at what rate? (OPP)
10.

5.
Relief.”
Besides self plaintiff examined 2 witnesses.

11.

PW-1 Ch. Ravinder Singh stated that he knew the plaintiff

for the last 4-5 years. That he knew the defendant who was a
tenant under the plaintiff. That monthly rent payable by the
defendant to the plaintiff was Rs.4500/- excluding electricity
charges. That he asked defendant to pay rent to the plaintiff
for the month of January and February 1999 @ Rs.4500/- per
month. That even he was a tenant in a shop in property No.A3/214, Kondli. That he was paying rent @ Rs.6000/- per month.
That rent agreement dated 4.11.1999 evidencing rent payable
by him to the landlord was Ex.PW1/A. In cross-examination he
admitted that rent agreement Ex.PW1/A was not registered.
That it was on a stamp paper of Rs.2/-.

That he did not

remember the date in the month of January and February 1999
when he witnessed defendant pay rent to the plaintiff.

He

stated that he did not remember as to when was the property
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.4 of 19

let out.
12.

PW-2 Satish Kumar proved rent agreement Ex.PW2/1

pertaining to property No.A-1/145, Main Road, New Kondli. The
said rent agreement is dated 7.6.1999.

Rent payable as

recorded therein is Rs.4500/- per month. In cross-examination
he stated that the area of shop let out as per Ex.PW2/1 is 32 sq.
yds. He stated that he never witnessed payment of rent by the
defendant to the plaintiff.
13.

Plaintiff examined herself as PW-3.

She proved her

alleged ownership with reference to general power of attornies
executed

by

the

respective

owner

of

property

bearing

Municipal No.A-1/147 and A-1/148, New Kondli being Ex.PW3/1
and EX.PW3/2.
14.

She stated that she rented out the entire ground floor of

both portions to the defendant at a monthly rent of Rs.4500/for a commercial purpose.

That defendant paid rent till the

month of May, 1999 through cheques in the name of her
husband but thereafter refused to pay the rent.

That she

terminated the tenancy and received in response reply
Ex.PW3/3 from the counsel of the defendant. She proved the
site plan of the tenanted premises as Ex.PW3/4.

In cross-

examination she admitted having executed no writing in favour
of her husband to deal with the suit property but stated that
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.5 of 19

being her husband she had allowed him to look after the
building. She admitted that no written lease agreement was
executed. She stated that she did not remember whether shop
was let out in the year 1996. She admitted that no rent receipt
was ever issued. She volunteered that her husband used to
collect the rent from the defendant and did not remember
whether her husband issued any rent receipt. She admitted
that no separate meter was installed for the tenanted premises.
She denied that the agreed rent was Rs.1500/- per month.
15.

Defendant examined, besides self 4 witnesses. DW-1 Sh.

Sudhir Dubey stated that he was a property dealer and that the
colony New Kondli was not fully developed in the year 1996.
That in the middle of 1996 defendant took the shop i.e. the said
property on rent which ad-measured 52 sq. meters. That the
agreed rent was Rs.1500/- per month.

That on 2 occasions,

once in the year 1998 and the other in 1999 he had witnessed
defendant pay rent in sum of Rs.1500/- + Rs.100/- towards
electricity charges to the plaintiff.
16.

From the record of the learned Trial Judge it appears that

DW-1 was never tendered for cross-examination.
17.

DW-2 Harish Kumar produced the proved Ex. DW2/1 being

the bank statement of account pertaining to the current
account No.45 in the name of M/s. Rim Zim Glass & Aluminum
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.6 of 19

Co. the stated sole proprietary firm of the defendant.
18.

DW-3/A Narinder Kumar deposed that on the second

Sunday of June 1996 he had accompanied the defendant as per
request of the defendant when he took on rent the suit
premises.

That the agreed rent was Rs.1500/- per month +

Rs.100/- as electricity charges.

In cross-examination he

admitted that no other person was present when terms of
tenancy were finalized and that no written document was
executed.
19.

DW-4 Shiv Kumar Dhawan proved statement of account

Ex. DW4/1 in the name of the plaintiff maintained with Punjab
National Bank Ghaziabad.
20.

Defendant examined himself as DW-3. He stated that he

took the suit property on rent in the middle of 1996 and that
the agreed rent was Rs.1500/- per month + Rs.100/- towards
electricity charges. He stated that he issued cheques bearing
Nos.320660 and 320666 as also cheque No.320667 in the
name of the husband of the plaintiff who had paid him an
advance for supply and execution of work pertaining to
aluminum glazing and glass work.

That the first 2 cheques

were encashed but the third cheque bearing No.320667 was
returned by the husband of the plaintiff and in lieu thereof he
took Rs.4500/- in cash.
RSA No.62/2005

He proved Ex.DW-3/12, Ex.DW-3/13
Page No.7 of 19

and Ex.DW-3/14 being the photocopies of the cash book and
the ledger account pertaining to Rim Zim Glass & Aluminimum
Co. the sole proprietary firm of defendant.

He produced the

original of the 3 exhibits for perusal of the court.
21.

In cross-examination he stated that he took the shop on

rent on the second Sunday of June, 1996.
22.

In view of the evidence led, whereas plaintiff urged before

the learned Trial Judge that the defendant having admitted
issuing cheque Nos.320660 and 320666 drawn on Corporation
Bank in the name of her husband and defendant having failed
to establish the defence that the cheques were issued for
return of the alleged advance paid by her husband, the 2
cheques evidenced the monthly rent.

Plaintiff further urged

that in view of defendant's reply to the legal notice sent by her
determining the tenancy, reply being Ex.PW3/3, the tenancy
stood determined and there was no reason why the suit be not
decreed. It was highlighted that Ex.DW-3/12, Ex.DW-3/13 and
Ex.DW-3/1 being the ledger account and cash book were
fabricated documents evidenced from the hand writing which
evidenced that one person had written the said documents
probably on a single day.
23.

Per contra, defendant urged that the tenancy was no

doubt determined but pleaded that the suit which was filed on
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.8 of 19

16.12.1999 was pre-mature. Pertaining to the rent payable it
was urged that the 2 cheques issued in the name of the
husband of the plaintiff could never be treated as proof of rent
for the reason testimony of DW-4 established that the plaintiff
was maintaining a bank account in her name and there was no
reason why cheque towards rent would be paid in the name of
the husband of the plaintiff. It was submitted that Ex.DW-3/12
to Ex.DW-3/14 were truthful documents.
24.

Learned Trial Judge held that under Indian circumstances,

housewives allow their husbands to look after their commercial
interests and therefore the 2 cheques drawn from the account
of the sole proprietary firm of the defendant in the name of the
husband of the plaintiff were good evidence to establish the
monthly

rent.

Holding

that

the

tenancy

was

validly

determined, learned Trial Judge decreed the suit for ejectment
but restricted mesne profits to the stated monthly rent i.e.
Rs.4500/- per month.
25.

Defendant filed an appeal. He succeeded. The Appellate

Court held that the 2 cheques i.e. cheque No.320660 and
320666 paid in the name of the husband of the plaintiff did not
establish rent paid by the defendant to the plaintiff. The notice
determining the tenancy being the notice dated 22.11.1998
was held to be illegal in as much as Section 106 of the Transfer
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.9 of 19

of Property Act required 15 days clear notice for termination of
the tenancy before filing suit which had to be filed after
tenancy month was over.
26.

As noted here-in-above the notice determining the

tenancy was posted on 24.11.1999 and was received by the
tenant on 27.11.1999.

It was not in dispute between the

parties that the tenancy commenced from the first day of each
calender month and expired on the last day of each calender
month. Thus, the tenancy could have been determined as per
the notice with effect from the midnight of 31.12.1999.
27.

Pertaining to the issue of determination of tenancy and

relatable to the first substantial question of law framed, learned
counsel for the appellant urged that a notice under Section 106
of the Transfer of Property Act has not to be interpreted
pedantically or hyper-technically.

Counsel stated that the

notice has to be liberally construed.
28. Counsel relied upon the following authorities:(a)

100 (2002) DLT 497 (DB) Uttam Parkash Bansal Vs. LIC

(b)

89 (2001) DLT 440 (DB) Mercury Travels India Ltd. Vs.

Mahabir Prasad & Anr.
(c)

1999 (51) DRJ (DB) Capital Boot House & Ors. Vs.

Intercraft Ltd.
29.

In my opinion aforesaid judgments have no role to play

RSA No.62/2005

Page No.10 of 19

while considering the dispute which has emerged for the
reason issue does not relate to the validity of the legal notice
but relates to the date when cause of action springs pursuant
to the notice in question.
30.

Suffice would it be to state that requirement of law is to

determine a residential or a commercial tenancy by serving a
notice

intimating

the

lessee

that

the

tenancy

stands

determined. The notice of determination has to be served at
least 15 days prior to the end of the tenancy month. Meaning
thereby the suit has to be filed after the tenancy month is over.
Shri Sanjay Jain, learned Senior counsel for the appellant had
conceded during arguments that the suit ought to have been
instituted on or after 1.1.2000.
31.

But, that would not be the end of the discussion.

Something more has to be probed.
32.

What happens in law where a suit is filed before right to

sue has matured but during pendency of the suit the right to
sue stands matured?
33.

In the decision reported as AIR 2005 SC 1891 Vithalbhai

P. Ltd. Vs. UOI, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that a suit of a
civil nature disclosing a cause of action even if filed before the
date on which the plaintiff became entitled to sue and claim the
relief

founded

RSA No.62/2005

on

such

cause

of

action

is

not

to

be

Page No.11 of 19

unnecessarily dismissed for said reason if cause of action
matures during pendency of the suit.
34.

The reason for the said statement of law is that a suit

being pre-mature does not go the root of the jurisdiction of the
court. Thus, unless manifest injustice or prejudice is shown
caused to the defendant, a court would not deny relief merely
because when filed the suit was pre-mature.
35.

The High Court of Karnataka, in the decision reported as

AIR 2007 Karnataka 162 Cordcell Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Marazaria
Products Pvt. Ltd., noting decision of the Supreme Court in
Vithalbhai's case (supra) held :-

36.

“No doubt the cause of action arises on the
termination of the tenancy. In case suit is filed
before expiry of lease period and the said lease
periods expires before the defendant files his
written statement, no prejudice is likely to cause to
the lessee and the suit cannot be dismissed only on
the ground that, the suit is filed before the expiry of
the lease period. Plaintiff is required to disclose the
cause of action in the suit. However, suit need not
be dismissed as premature, if by the time the
written statement came to be filed, the parties will
know their case and adduce evidence and the court
will adjudicate the suit on merits on the issues
arising out of pleadings.”
In the instant case, as noted above, suit was instituted on

16.12.1999.

Defendant was served for 10.1.2000.

Written

statement was filed on 9.3.2000. By the time defendant was
served and written statement was filed, the date by which
plaintiff was entitled to sue after determining the lease had
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.12 of 19

been crossed.
37.

The first question of law framed in the instant appeal is

accordingly answered by holding that the suit for ejectment
was pre-mature when filed but the same does not entitle the
defendant to have the suit dismissed.

The suit became

maintainable on 1.1.2000, much before the date when the
defendant was served and filed the written statement.
38.

Pertaining to the second question of law relevant would it

be to state that where on the evidence brought before the
court 2 views are possible and the Trial Judge adopts one out of
the 2 views the first Appellate Court would not be justified in reappreciating the evidence and adopt the second view. Further,
where only one view is possible and the same has been
adopted by the first Appellate Court, in second appeal, the
second Appellate Court would not re-appreciate the evidence.
39.

Pertaining to rent 2 issues were framed in the suit. Issue

No.1 was whether the suit property was let out to the
defendant at a monthly rent of Rs.1500/-. Onus thereof was on
the defendant.

The second issue was whether the suit

premises was let out to the defendant at a monthly rent of
Rs.4500/-. The onus thereof was on the plaintiff.
40.

Prima facie, the manner in which issues have been framed

leaves much to be desired for the reason what if both parties
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.13 of 19

led no evidence?

Would the court have decided issue No.1

against the plaintiff and issue No.2 against the defendant? This
would have been the natural corollary of neither party leading
no evidence.

What would have been the final decree under

said circumstances? I need not speculate on hypthetical issues
for the reason under Section 107 of the Code of Civil Procedure
it is permissible for an Appellate Court to frame issues other
than those framed at the trial and if evidence has already been
led on the subject matter it would be permissible for the
Appellate Court to neither record further evidence nor refer the
matter for further evidence.
41.

In my opinion, in view of the pleadings of the parties the

issue which needed to be framed was :- At what rate of rent
was the suit property let out by the plaintiff to the defendant?
Onus on the parties.”
42.

The issue of rent assumes significance for the reason

under the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 all properties on rent up
to Rs.3500/- p.m. are protected tenancies and civil courts have
no jurisdiction to entertain an eviction suit pertaining to the
tenanted premises.
43.

Before I discuss the evidence brought on record I feel it

important to pen down implications of tax avoidance.

Tax

avoidance is a norm adopted by the vast majority of the
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.14 of 19

citizens of this country. Tax compliance is the exception. To
avoid paying taxes, citizens in this country conduct civil
transactions in un-officious manner with the result that
evidence recognized as cogent, clinching and good evidence by
law is seldom brought on record.
example thereof.

Instant case is a classic

Both parties have heavily relied upon oral

testimony.
44.

Who would win the battle would ultimately probably be

decided on the basis of not who has brought better evidence on
record but whose evidence is the worst.
45.

Turning to the plaintiff, it has to be noted that she never

even disclosed the date on which the tenancy commenced.
She brought on record neither the rent note nor a rent receipt
and not even proof of any payment tendered in her name. The
only evidence brought on record was her self serving testimony
and the testimony of PW-1. That apart plaintiff had to clutch on
to the 2 cheques being cheque Nos.320660 and 320666
admittedly issued by the defendant in the name of her
husband.
46.

PW-2 was not a witness when the plaintiff and the

defendant settled the terms of lease.

He claimed to have

always witnessed payment of rent by the defendant to the
plaintiff but failed to even remotely give the day, much less the
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.15 of 19

time when he witnessed payment of the rent.

Testimony of

PW-2 lacks credibility.
47.

The testimony of the plaintiff also lacks credibility for the

reason she categorically deposed as under :-

48.

“I do not operate any bank account. No cheque was
issued to me by the deft. of the rent, the cheques of
rent which were issued were only issued to the
name of my husband. I do not know the date of
issue of cheque. In respect of which month. I can
not tell the no. of cheques as was not issued to me.
My husband deals in property.
It is wrong to
suggest that the cheques which were issued to my
husband by the deft. in respect of business
transaction.”
Her statement is not truthful for the reason, Ex. DW4/1

being the statement of account of the plaintiff evidences that
she was maintaining saving bank account No.20 with Punjab
National Bank Branch, Ghaziabad and that the account was
opened by her on 18.5.1998.
49.

Thus, explanation of the plaintiff that cheque Nos. 320660

and 320666 in sum of Rs.4500/- towards rent payable for the
months of April and May 1999 were drawn in favour of her
husband as she was not maintaining any bank account is
palpably false.

Her oral testimony is belied by her deeds

reflected in Ex.DW4/1.
50.

Pertaining to the documentary evidence being Ex.PW1/A

and Ex.PW2/1 i.e. the rent agreement dated 4.11.1999 and
7.6.1999 pertaining to property No.A-3/214, New Kondli,
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.16 of 19

Property No.A-1/145, New Kondli relevant would it be to note
and record that the same pertained to tenancies commencing
in the month of June and November 1999.

For purpose of

comparison and determining comparable rents the said rent
agreement would have no relevance to tenancies which
commenced in the area around the year 1996.

Thus,

pertaining to said documents the question when the instant
tenancy commenced assumes significance.
51.

The plaintiff did not disclose in the plaint the month or the

year of tenancy.

Nor did the defendant did so. However,

whereas suggestions were put to the plaintiff in crossexamination that the tenancy commenced in June 1996,
plaintiff did not challenge the testimony of the defendant and
his witness DW-3/A when both stated that the shop in question
was let out on the second Sunday of June 1996.
52.

Since DW-1, Sudhir Dubey has not been cross-examined

probably for the reason he never offered himself for crossexamination, I eschew the affidavit by way of evidence filed by
him.
53.

DW-3/A, Narinder Kumar Kaushik and the defendant have

clearly stated in cross-examination that the area in question did
not have many shops in 1996.

Thus, there is evidence that

there was not much demand for commercial properties in the
RSA No.62/2005

Page No.17 of 19

area in the year 1996.
54.

Though not very cogent but defendant has brought on

record at least some evidence which shows that the rentals in
the area in the year 1996 were much less than the rentals in
the area in the year 1999.
55.

I am conscious of the fact that the shop which is subject

matter of the dispute has an area larger than the area of the
shops which are subject matter of Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW2/1.
56.

In the year 1996 and till the year 2002 for rented

properties property tax was being assessed and collected in
relation to actual rents. Plaintiff has not brought on record any
evidence that she paid property taxes qua the property owned
by her disclosing that the ground floor was on rent of Rs.4,500/per month.

She has with held best evidence.

Further, her

husband who was the best witness to depose regarding receipt
of two cheques in his name from the defendant has not been
examined by the plaintiff as her witness. The version of the
plaintiff that the two cheques were drawn in the name of her
husband as she was not maintaining any bank account stands
belied from the fact that since 1998 she was maintaining a
bank account. It has to be noted that the two cheques were
issued in the month of May 1999.
57.

As per Evidence Act a fact is said to be proved when, after

RSA No.62/2005

Page No.18 of 19

considering the matters before it, the Court either believes it to
exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man
ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act
upon the supposition that exists.

As per Evidence Act a fact is

said to be disproved when, after considering the matters before
it, the Court either believes that it does not exist, or considers
its non-existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under
the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the
supposition that it does not exist.

A fact is said not to be

proved when it is neither proved nor disproved.
58.

Even if I were to lean backwards in favour of the plaintiff it

would be a case where neither party has proved or disproved
whether rent was Rs.1500/- per month or it was Rs.4500/- per
month. It would then be a case of rent being not proved i.e.
neither proved nor disproved by either party.
59.

The plaintiff must therefore lose the battle.

60.

The appeal is dismissed.

61.

No costs.
