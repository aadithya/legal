1.
As per the claim of the petitioner, he is a documentary/short film
maker of national and international fame.

Besides earning critical

acclaim for his works, he has won several awards.

He has also

produced various documentaries and short films for various
government and other agencies, inter alia, on fine arts like paintings
of the top ranking and important artists of the country and the artists
themselves. He carries on his profession under the name and style of
'M/s. Cine Arts India', of which he is the sole proprietor.
2.

The respondent No.1, Lalit Kala Academi (for short, 'Akademi'), which

AA No. 24/2006

Page 1 of 10

is an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Tourism and
Culture, was established in the year 1954. Therefore, the year of
2004 was Golden Jubilee Year of its existence. For this occasion, it
proposed to make a film on Akademi giving an overview of the
evolution of this institution, the contribution it has made to its assigned
field of activity and an indication to future direction. The respondent
No.1 assigned this work to the petitioner requesting him to make a
documentary film on “50 Years of Lalit Kala Academi”. An agreement
dated 2.8.2004 was entered into between the parties as per which the
documentary was to be made for a duration of 30 minutes.
Consideration was

settled at Rs.4,00,000/-

plus service tax

applicable, which was payable in stages. Ten per cent of this amount
was to be paid on signing of the contract and, thus, a sum of
Rs.40,000/- was paid on 23.8.2004.

The petitioner prepared the

aforesaid documentary film for the respondent No.1 and the entire
amount of Rs.4,00,000/- has also since been paid.
3.

However, the film produced by the petitioner turned out to be for a
duration of 40 minutes and 40 seconds (at some places, it is
mentioned as 40 minutes and 50 seconds). The petitioner, therefore,
claimed that he was entitled to further payment on proportionate
basis, keeping in view that Rs.4,00,000/- was the payment agreeable
for 30 minutes' film.

AA No. 24/2006

Therefore, as per the petitioner, he became

Page 2 of 10

entitled to further sum of Rs.1,59,177/- inclusive of service tax for the
cost of additional time of 10.50 minutes and also raised bill for this
amount. However, the respondent No.1 has taken the stand that the
same is not payable as in accordance with the agreement, total
consideration agreed was Rs.4,00,000/-, which has been paid.
4.

Agreement dated 2.8.2004 entered into between the parties contains
clause 18, as per which in the event of disputes and differences
arising or in the said agreement, the same are to be referred to or any
person appointed by the Chairman, Akademi.

According to the

petitioner, vide letter dated 5.3.2005, he requested the Chairman,
Akademi to appoint the arbitrator in terms of the aforesaid clause and
as the Chairman neglected to do so, the present petition is filed under
Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short,
'the Act') for appointment of the arbitrator by this Court.
5.

The respondent No.1 has contested this petition and filed the written
statement. Perusal of this written statement would show, which was
the basis of submission during oral argument as well, that the petition
is contested on two grounds :
(a)

procedure contained in clause 18 of the agreement has not

been followed inasmuch as no notice or request was received by the
Chairman, Akademi, for appointment of the arbitrator and, therefore,
the petition was not maintainable. It was the contention that letter

AA No. 24/2006

Page 3 of 10

dated 5.3.2005 was never received and to support this, true copy of
the relevant extract from the Dak Receipt Register of Akademi is
produced. Learned counsel for the respondent No.1, referring to the
judgment of this Court in Food Corporation of India v. Indian
Council for Arbitration & Anr., 2000 (3) ALR 550, submitted that a
petition under Section 11 (6) of the Act could be filed only on the
failure of the designated authority to act as required under the
procedure agreed to by the parties and since this procedure was not
followed, request was not made to the Chairman, Akademi for appoint
of the arbitrator; there was no failure to act on the part of the
Chairman, Akademi and this pre-condition for request to the Court to
take measures for the appointment of the arbitrator having not been
fulfilled, the petitioner was required to be dismissed on this ground
itself;
(b)

on merits, it was argued that there was no dispute or difference,

which needed to be referred.

The respondent No.1 has given its

version in the reply stating that as per the agreement, the total
consideration of the film was not to exceed Rs.4,00,000/-. Therefore,
merely because the length of the film, ultimately produced, was more
than 30 minutes, the respondent No.1 could not be fastened with any
additional liability.

The reference was made to clause 13 of the

agreement, as per which in no case the consideration was not to

AA No. 24/2006

Page 4 of 10

exceed cost of Rs.4,00,000/- as indicated in clause 10 of the
agreement.
6.

Insofar as the first contention of learned counsel for the respondent
No.1 is concerned, I do not find any substance therein. There is no
quarrel about the legal proposition advanced by the learned counsel
for the respondent No.1, namely the procedure as agreed to between
the parties and contained in the arbitration agreement has to be
followed and, therefore, it was incumbent upon the petitioner to
request the Chairman, Akademi to appoint an arbitrator stating the
disputes and differences.

In this case, the petitioner has made

specific averment in the petitioner that this procedure was followed
inasmuch as, letter dated 5.3.2006 was sent by the petitioner to the
Secretary, Akademi with copy to the Chairman.

In this letter, the

petitioner had categorically stated that he had submitted additional bill
for the exact duration of the film, which was not paid and had
requested that the payment be made within a period of one month
and in case the respondent No.1 disputes the bill, request is made to
appoint an arbitrator in terms of clause 18 of the agreement. In the
copy addressed to the Chairman, specific endorsement in the
following manner is made :“Copy to: Chairman, Lalit Kala Akademi, Rabindra Bhavan,
35, Feroz Shah Road, New Delhi – 110 001 (by Registered
Post). He is requested to appoint an Arbitrator in terms of
Clause 18 of the Agreement referred to above, in case the
AA No. 24/2006

Page 5 of 10

Lalit Kala Akademi fails to pay our bill within a period of one
month as that would imply that a dispute/difference has arisen
out of the Agreement executed with the Lalit Kala Akademi
dated 2nd August 2004.”

This letter is sent by registered post and the petitioner has
enclosed copy of the postal receipt.

It is not in dispute that the

address mentioned on this letter is the correct address of the
respondent No.1. When the petitioner has given proof and dispatch
of this letter at correct address, presumption under Section 27 of the
General Clauses Act, 1897 would be drawn in favour of the petitioner.
The petitioner has also placed on record complaint regarding nonreceipt of the Acknowledgment Card, which is addressed to the Post
Master, Gol Dak Khana, GPO, New Delhi. In response to this letter
dated 15.5.2006, reply has been received from the APM, General
Correspondence Branch of the GPO stating that the letter in question
was delivered to the addressee on 7.3.2005. Therefore, it cannot be
said that the petitioner did not make demand or followed the
procedure in accordance with clause 18 of the agreement.
7.

In order to appreciate the second contention, we may refer to some of
the clauses of the agreement. The first recital of this agreement on
page 1 stipulates that the film to be produced is to be of 30 minutes
duration and reads as under :“WHEREAS The Akademi has decided to producer (sic) a
Betacam video documentary on 50 years of Lalit Kala
Akademi for during of 30 minutes on the terms and conditions
hereinafter contained.”

AA No. 24/2006

Page 6 of 10

Clause 10 mentions the consideration of Rs.4,00,000/- in the
following manner :“The Akademi would pay to the Executive Producer an
amount of Rs. 4,00,000/- (Rupees four lakh plus service tax
as applicable) for the documentary as consideration for the full
completion and delivery to the satisfaction of the Akademi of
the items/material mentioned in paras 1, 1A above.”

In clause 13, it is mentioned that the price of the documentary
will not exceed the cost stipulated in clause 10. This clause is worded
in the following manner :“It is mutually agreed that the price of the documentary will not
exceed the cost indicated in Clause 10 of this Agreement
except for increase in statutory levies and duties. In respect
of such increase, the Executive Producer may apply to the
Akademi for a revision in the price of the film based on actual
increases, the Akademi will have the right to consider such
application on merits and at its discretion.”

8.

Based on the aforesaid clauses, contention of learned counsel for the
respondent No.1 was that the Akademi had decided to produce
documentary for 30 minutes duration. Clause 10 provides that the
amount to be paid for this film would be Rs.4,00,000/- for “the full
completion and delivery” of the film to the Akademi and this cost of
Rs.4,00,000/- was not to exceed, except for increase in statutory
levies and duties.

Therefore, irrespective of the length of the

documentary, insofar as the respondent No.1 is concerned, it was to
make payment of Rs.4,00,000/- and no more was the argument of
learned counsel appearing for the Akademi. It was submitted that if
the petitioner made the film for a longer duration than 30 minutes,

AA No. 24/2006

Page 7 of 10

even in that eventuality, he was not entitled to any additional amount
in view of the aforesaid clauses.
9.

Learned counsel for the petitioner, on the other hand, took me
through the correspondence exchanged between the parties on the
additional length of the documentary.

He stated that letter dated

16/18.10.2004 was written by the petitioner to the respondent No.1
clearly stating that the duration of the film produced by him was 40.40
minutes against the sanctioned duration of 30 minutes and that he
had also indicated in this letter that if 10.40 minutes is removed from
the film, it would become somewhat superficial. However, he left it to
the Akademi to decide this. The petitioner reiterated the same vide
his letter dated 21.10.2004, while giving the final version of the
documentary, stating that it was complete in all respects and again
highlighted that the final running time of the film was 40.50 minutes as
against the stipulated duration of 30 minutes. Along with this letter,
apart from submitting the bill of Rs.2,00,000/- plus service tax, which
was 50% balance payment of the total cost of Rs.4,00,000/-, he also
stated in the last para as under :“I am also enclosing two bills, one for the balance payment as
per the Agreement and the other for the DVDs. I shall be
grateful if these could be processed at the earliest. As
discussed, I shall be sending a supplementary bill for the
additional duration of the film separately.”

10.

On the basis of this, the submission of learned counsel for the

AA No. 24/2006

Page 8 of 10

petitioner was that the film has produced for a longer duration was
sent because the respondent No.1 agreed to accept the same and,
therefore, he mentioned that he would be sending supplementary bill
for the additional duration “as discussed” between the parties. Vide
another

letter

of

even

date,

the

petitioner

mentioned

that

Rs.1,46,667/- was the amount worked out but he was enclosing
supplementary bill of Rs45,000/- plus service tax, only making a total
of Rs.49,500/- and supplementary bill of the said amount was sent.
This was followed by letter dated 28.12.2004 reiterating that the
petitioner had demanded only Rs.49,500/-. which was 1/3rd of the
payment due to him. As this amount was not paid, he sent another
letter dated 5.3.2005 stating that since despite the reminders the
payment was not made, he was withdrawing his earlier bill of
Rs.49,500/- and sending the bill for normal charges i.e. Rs.1,44,444/plus service tax, thereby making a total of Rs.1,59,177/-.

Thus,

learned counsel submitted that even when the agreement stipulated
Rs.4,00,000/- as cost, which was not to exceed, that was for a film of
30 minutes duration. No doubt, he had produced the film of longer
duration, but the same was accepted by the respondent No.1 and,
therefore, the respondent No.1 was liable for payment of this amount.
11.

Though I have noted the contentions of both the parties in some detail
on this aspect, but the same is done only with one purpose, namely to

AA No. 24/2006

Page 9 of 10

find out as to whether there is any dispute between the parties or not.
It is clear that there is a dispute between the parties on the
interpretation of the agreement, because as per the Akademi, no
further amount is payable under any circumstance, whereas the
petitioner insists otherwise. It could clearly be termed as a 'dispute'.
As to whose version is correct, is not for this Court to decide. Once
the Court comes to the conclusion that there is a dispute, then in a
petition under Section 11 of the Act, the only course open to the Court
is to refer the matter to the arbitrator in view of the arbitration clause
in the agreement for resolution of this dispute and it would be within
the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to decide the said dispute.

12.

The petition is, accordingly allowed and Dr. (Ms.) Prem Lata, former
Member, District Consumer Forum, is appointed as the Arbitrator,
who shall get lumpsum fee of Rs.25,000/-.

The entire fee shall

initially be paid by the petitioner, however, it would be for the
arbitrator to ultimately decide as to who has to bear this fee and/or
how the same is to be shared.
