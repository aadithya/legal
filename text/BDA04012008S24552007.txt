The plaintiffs had instituted the present suit

against the defendants for, inter alia, infringement of
copyright in respect of the plaintiffs software, namely,
AutoCAD LT 2008, AutoCAD Revit Architecture Suite 2008
and Autodesk 3ds max 2008.

The said software was

being used by the defendants at their office premises
without obtaining a licence from the plaintiffs. However,
during the pendency of the suit, it has been settled
between the parties that the defendants shall make full
payment for the use of the software by obtaining of the
licences in respect thereof. All the amounts have already
been paid by demand drafts as well as by post dated
cheques as indicated in para 2(d) of the application. The
defendants have also unconditionally regreted their use of
the unlicenced software of the plaintiffs. It has also been
agreed that in the event of breach of any of the payment
terms or any other terms of the present settlement, the
plaintiffs would be entitled to forthwith and without any
notice, terminate the present settlement and pursue
appropriate legal remedies available to them.
