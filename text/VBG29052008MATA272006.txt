The present appeal under section 28 (2) of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 (for short as the “Act”) has been filed
by the Appellant/Husband against an order dated 06.07.06
passed by Sh. K.S. Pal, Additional District Magistrate, Delhi
whereby the Trial Court dismissed the application of the
Appellant under section 26 of the Act read with section 151
of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for grant of an interim
custody of Appellant‟s children by appointing him as a
natural guardian.
2.

The relevant facts for disposal of the present appeal

are

that

the

marriage

between

the

Appellant

and

Respondent was solemnized on 23.01.92 at New Delhi
according to Hindu rites and ceremonies and the same was
registered with the Registrar of marriage under the Act in
Delhi on 18.08.93. Two children were born out of this
wedlock. The elder son Master Vaibhav Kasturia was born
on 18.11.92 and the younger son Master Vishesh Kasturia
was born on 10.01.98. Later on, there started differences
between the parties and in Nov.2001 the appellant shifted
to Germany to work in Brandenburg Technical University,

Page 2 of 14

Germany. Respondent and two sons also came to Germany
in April 2002. On 27.12.02, a „Separation Agreement‟ was
concluded between the parties with the intentions to get
divorce. On the issue of the right to determine the
residence of the children, it was decided that this right
would remain with both the parents. According to this
Agreement, both the parties were supposed to have
custody of the children alternatively for a week.
3.

It has been stated by the appellant that sometime

after the separation, the Respondent with intention to
agonize and fetch money from the Appellant filed a case in
the Local Courts of Cottubus, Germany. The Local Court of
Cottbus, Germany vide order dated 08.05.03, granted the
right to determine the place of residence of the children to
the Respondent.

5.

It has been alleged by the Appellant that during the

pendency of the above referred case, Respondent stopped
compliance of the Separation agreement.
6.

Aggrieved as above, Appellant filed an application

before the Local Court of Cottbus on 12.09.03 and vide
interim order dated 22.10.03, the Court allowed the
Appellant to have the custody of the children every
alternative Saturday from 10 am to 6 pm till the disposal of
the Custody case.
7.

On 26.06.04, the parties left Germany and reached

India. It is alleged by the Appellant that on return, at the
Airport,

the

Appellant

met

an

accomplice

of

the

Respondent who claimed to be from police. He told the
Appellant that Respondent‟s father had filed a complaint
against

the

appellant

before

police

and

this

way

Respondent forcibly took the children away from the
Appellant.
8.

It is further stated by the Appellant that he is a

Software Engineer by profession and since graduation has
been

working

MAT App. No.27/2006

with

highly

reputed

companies

Page 4 of 14

and

Multinationals and he is in a much better position to look
after and care the children for a bright future while the
Respondent is a house wife and had no income of her own
and was wholly dependent on the Appellant since the
commencement of marriage. It is further alleged that the
Respondent along with both the sons has been living with
her parents in a two rooms apartment at Mayur Vihar and
due to congested environment, the Respondent cannot
provide healthy growth and good education to the children.
The Trial Court has erred in holding that the Appellant is
not entitled for interim custody or any visitation rights with
the children though the prayer in the application of the
Appellant was only with regard to the interim custody. The
Trial court has ignored the fact that the father is the legal
guardian of the children and he has full right for visitation
with their children as well as for interim custody. It is
alleged by the Appellant that the Respondent has no
respect for law and she has violated various agreements
and court orders passed by the Germany Court while living
in Germany. Hence, it is prayed by the Appellant that the
custody of both the sons born out of this wedlock be given

MAT App. No.27/2006

Page 5 of 14

to him for their proper environment as well as for good
education.
9.

In reply affidavit filed on behalf of the Respondent, it

is stated that prior to the filing of the appeal, the Appellant
with ulterior motives filed two separate petitions against
the Respondent, one is for seeking decree of divorce on the
ground of cruelty and the second is under section 26 of the
Act for grant of permanent custody of children born out of
the wedlock of the parties. Both the said petitions are
pending for disposal before the Trial Court. Later on,
without withdrawing the said petition under section 26 of
the Act, the Appellant has also filed a petition under
section 25 of the Guardians & Wards Act for seeking
permanent custody of the children. Along with it he has
also filed an ad-interim application for seeking the custody
of the children or the restoration of meeting rights. The
said application was dismissed by the Trial Court vide
order dated 06.07.06 against which the appellant has filed
the present appeal before this Court.
10.

The Appellant has also filed an application under

section 151 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 before the

MAT App. No.27/2006

Page 6 of 14

Guardian Court, thereby seeking restoration of meeting
rights with the children. To the said application, the
Respondent filed her reply dated 15.01.07 to which no
rejoinder has been filed by the Appellant. The said
application is still pending for disposal before the Guardian
Court. After the dismissal of the said application under
section 26 of the Act in terms of order dated 06.07.06, the
Appellant cannot be permitted to agitate the same issues
by filing the present appeal under reply and that too when
another application filed by him is still pending disposal
before the Guardianship Judge.
11.

It is further stated that when the Respondent filed an

application under section 24 of the Act for seeking
maintenance for herself and for the children, then the
appellant in reply to the above said application, has refused
to pay maintenance. Despite being a man of means having
substantial amount available at his disposal, the appellant
in the said reply alleged that since Nov. 2005, he has been
working as a free-lance programmer/Software Engineer
earning a monthly income of Rs.15,000/-; his income is not
fixed but flexible; has suffered huge litigation cost; has the

MAT App. No.27/2006

Page 7 of 14

responsibility of his old parents and suffered of loss of
about Rs.40,000/- in June,2004.
12.

By praying for dismissal of maintenance application of

respondent for her maintenance and for the maintenance
of

children,

the

Appellant

has

proved

beyond

any

reasonable doubt that neither he had nor he has any love,
affection and/or attachment for the children and it is the
respondent who is looking after them.
13.

It is further stated that when the Respondent was in

Germany, she filed an application on 3.2.03 with District
Court of Cottbus, Germany for sole custody of children also
declaring therein that after the separation, she would like
to return to India. On 12.6.03, the Court while accepting
the said petition of the respondent, directed the appellant
to hand over the passports, school and health certificates
of children to her. While coming to the said conclusion that
the right to decide the place of residence of children was
assigned to the respondent, the Court also took into
consideration the recommendation and judgments of Youth
Welfare Office in Cottbus.

14.

Against the said order, the appellant filed an appeal

before the Brandenburg Higher Regional Court, however,
the said appeal was disposed off vide order dated 30.10.03
on technical grounds.
15.

Ultimately it was decided that the parties will leave

Germany for India on 21.6.04. After coming back to India,
the parties are living separately from each other since
27.12.02 i.e. ever since the agreement of separation was
executed between the parties.
16.

The Respondent did B.Sc (Physics Hons.) from Delhi

University in the year 1986 and thereafter successfully
completed two years Diploma in Computer Applications
from BRC Institute of Computer Sciences, Chandigarh.
After completing her education, she joined the service but
resigned from the job as the appellant was not interested
that the Respondent should continue with the job after
marriage as the parties were getting married on 23.1.92
and after coming back to India, she joined Max Muller
Bhavan for learning the German language.

MAT App. No.27/2006

17.

It is further stated by the Respondent that she is

educated, gainfully employed and taking full care of her
children. Both the children born out of the wedlock of
parties are studying in Ryan International School, Mayur
Vihar Phase III, Delhi which is one of the best schools of
Delhi and respondent is taking full care of the children and
providing them with the best education within her limited
means. Both the children are deeply attached to their
mother and maternal grandparents. The respondent is
living with her parents in their own house. After coming
back to India, it is the father of Respondent who took full
care of Respondent and children and provided them all the
basic necessities of life and also got the children admitted
in the best school of the area.
18.

From August, 2003, both the children started living

permanently with their mother. Even while staying at
Germany, the appellant stopped paying any maintenance
charges for respondent and paid the same only for the
children, for which he himself was getting the aid from the
German Government.

Therefore, it is prayed that it is in the welfare of the

children

that

their

custody

should

remain

with

the

Respondent. By giving any meeting rights and/or the
custody of the children to the Appellant, the same will
adversely affect their up-bringing, growth, education etc.
Thus,

the

appeal

filed

by

rejoinder

filed

by

the

Appellant

should

be

dismissed.
20.

In

the

Appellant,

he

had

controverted the averments made by the Respondent.
21.

I have heard the Ld. Counsel for the parties and have

perused the record.
22.

Although under the provisions of Hindu Law by which

the parties are governed, the father is accepted as the
natural guardian of a minor, but there are several
instances, where the courts had accepted the mother as
the natural guardian of a minor in preference to the father
even when he was available.
23.

The question regarding the custody of a minor child

cannot be decided on the basis of the legal rights of the
parties. The custody of a child has to be decided on the sole

MAT App. No.27/2006

Page 11 of 14

and predominant criterion of what would best serve the
interest and welfare of the child.
24.

Having regard to the complexities of the situation in

which this Court has been called upon to balance the
emotional confrontation of the parents of the children and
the welfare of the minors, I have given anxious thought as
to what would be in the best interest of the minors. I have
myself spoken to children, without either of the parents
being present, in order to ascertain their preference in the
matter.
25.

Although the children had expressed before this

Court that they were not willing to stay with their father,
keeping in mind the fact that the welfare of the children is
of paramount importance, the Court seriously consider
whether the children should be deprived of their father‟s
company or not?
26.

The children are living with their mother permanently

since Aug.2003. Thus, under these circumstances the
interim custody of the children cannot be given to the
Appellant.

27.

Without

going

misapprehensions

into

expressed,

the
on

allegation
the

and

paramount

consideration of best safeguarding the interest of the
children, in my opinion, order for visitation rights of the
Appellant deserves to be passed.
28.

I, therefore, feel that the interest of children will be

best served if they remain with the Respondent but with
sufficient access to the Appellant to visit them at frequent
intervals but so as not to disturb and disrupt their normal
studies and other activities.
29.

Accordingly, I direct that the Appellant will be at

liberty to take children out with him and to bring them
back to the Respondent's house on alternate Sunday from 3
p.m. to 6 p.m. during the summer vacations and when
school remains open, then once in a month from 4p.m. to 6
p.m.
30.

The present appeal, stands disposed off in view of

above terms.
31.

No orders as to costs.
