SANJIV KHANNA, J:
1. The present appeal has been filed by Mr. S.C. Sharma, an
erstwhile employee of Modi Rubber Limited, the respondent

LPA No. 511/2000

No. 8 herein.

Page 2

It is the case of the appellant that on 12

th

September, 1972 he was appointed as Stenographer with the
respondent No. 8.

On 26

th

August, 1996 his services were

terminated by giving one month salary in lieu of notice.
Aggrieved, the appellant filed Writ Petition No. 3654/1996 on
rd

23 September, 1996 challenging his termination from service
on the ground that it is in violation of principles of natural
justice, Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution of India.
2.

Before the Learned Single Judge, preliminary objection was
taken by the respondent No. 8 that the writ petition was not
maintainable as the said company is not a “State” or an
“instrumentality” or an “agency” of the Government within the
meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India.

By the

th

impugned judgment dated 11 August, 2000, Learned Single
Judge has held that the writ petition was not maintainable as
the respondent No. 8 is an incorporated company and,
therefore, does not come within the sweep of Article 12 of the
Constitution of India.

It was also held that the Government

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 3

does not exercise direct, deep and pervasive control over the
respondent No. 8 merely because some of the financial
institutions of the Government were shareholders or had given
loans to the respondent No. 8 and their nominees were on the
Board of the respondent no.8. The terms “any person” and “for
any purpose” in Article 226 of the Constitution of India were
also examined with reference to various judgments of the
Supreme Court and the propositions as elucidated by H.M.
Seervai in Constitutional Law of India, Fourth Edition. It was
held that Article 226 cannot be construed to replace ordinary
remedies available by way of a suit to a litigant or a citizen
under general law of the land. The Learned Single Judge
observed that once the history of the Prerogative Writs is kept
in mind, there is no difficulty in understanding that the
expression “any person” cannot include private persons who
are not performing public functions. Learned Single Judge
noticed the distinction between “public function” and “private
functions”. The contention that the respondent No. 8 was

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 4

performing public function, was also rejected. The Court also
noticed that the dispute between the appellant herein and the
respondent No. 8 is based upon contract of personal service
and the said contract it was held cannot be made subject
matter of a writ petition. The expressions “any person” and “for
any purpose” by itself would not entitle a citizen to file a writ
petition against an incorporated company.
3.

Learned counsel for the appellant, in addition to his oral
submissions,

has submitted

before us written submissions

going into 16 pages along with two voluminous compendiums
of judgments. The arguments of the appellant can be
condensed in the following words:(i) Though the respondent No. 8 is a company incorporated under
the Companies Act, 1956, several Government Companies
Corporations like Industrial Financial Corporation of India, Unit
Trust of India, Life Insurance Corporation of India, Industrial
Development Bank of India and General Insurance Corporation
of India hold shares in respondent No. 8 to the extent of 52.4%

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 5

of its paid up equity share capital.

They had nominated

Directors on the Board of the respondent No. 8. Reference in
this matter was made to the provisions of the Companies Act,
1956. Therefore, the respondent no. 8 is a state under Article
12 of the Constitution.
(ii) Respondent No. 8 had taken loan from public financial
institutions and, therefore, the said respondent was performing
public functions. Activities carried out by the respondent No. 8
were for public good, of vital and high public and national
importance. It was the third largest tyre manufacturer company
in the country. Some of the objects of the Memorandum of
Association of the respondent No. 8, entrust it with important
public duties. Thus, respondent No. 8 performed public
functions.
(iii) Writ petition under Article 226 is maintainable against any
person and it is not necessary that the said person should be
exercising

sovereign

public

functions

or

should

be

a

governmental authority. Writ petition under Article 226 of the

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 6

Constitution of India is maintainable for any purpose without
any limitation or restriction. Distinction between the private law
and public law are not relevant.
(iv) Fundamental rights of the appellant have been violated
because his service has been terminated by giving one month
notice.

Action of the respondent No. 8 violates Articles 14,

19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution of India. Contract of
personal service though not enforceable under the Specific
Relief Act, but, Law does not permit arbitrary and

illegal

termination without reasons in violation of principles of natural
justice.
4. Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, has
also filed written submissions pointing out that respondent No.
8 does not perform “State” or “public function” and is a purely
private body. No public interest as such is involved as the
dispute pertains to the appellant and the respondent, which is a
purely private dispute between employer and employee.
5. We, may mention here that other terminated employees of

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 7

respondent no. 8 had also filed Writ petitions, which were
dismissed. Letter Patent Appeals filed were also dismissed.
The Special Leave Petitions were granted but the Civil Appeals
were disposed of vide order dated 23

rd

January, 2003, inter

alia, holding that it was not necessary to examine the
correctness or otherwise of the order passed by the High Court
dismissing the Writ Petition on the ground of maintainability as
it was not denied by the appellants therein that alternative
remedies were available to them under the general law. In
these circumstances, the appellants were asked to avail of
alternative remedies to shorten the litigation as suggested by
the Court. The Civil Appeals were disposed of by, the Supreme
Court without examining the issue of maintainability of the writ
petition on merit on the ground of availability of alternate
remedy. The present appeal is liable to dismissed following the
decision of the division bench in the case of V. Mahendru
versus Union of India (LPA No. 171/1998), dismissing the
appeal filed by the other erstwhile employees of the respondent
no. 8.
6. There is no dispute that the appellant herein was initially
employed as Stenographer and was, therefore, a workman
within the meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act, however, the

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 8

appellant was later on promoted to the position of Assistant
Manager (Insurance) in 1988 and subsequently his services
were terminated in 1996.
7.

We need not refer to various judgments cited by both parties
as we feel the entire controversy has been settled by the
decisions of the Supreme Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas
versus Indian Institute of Chemical Biology and Others,
reported in (2002) 5 SCC 111, VST

Industries Limited

versus VST Industries Workers' Union and Another,
reported in (2001) 1 SCC 298, G. Bassi Reddy versus
International

Crops

Research

Institute

and

Another,

reported in (2003) 4 SCC 225 and Binni Limited and Another
versus V. Sadasivan and Others, reported in (2005) 6 SCC
657.
8.

In Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra), the Supreme Court
interpreted Article 12 of the Constitution of India, which reads :“ in this part, unless the context
otherwise requires, “the State”
includes
the Government and the Parliament of India

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 9

and the Government and Legislature of each
of the States
and all local or other
authorities within the territory of India or under
the control of the Government of India”
9.

The majority judgment held that the term “State” for the

purpose of Article 12 would mean Central Government, State
Government, local authorities and statutory corporations and would
also include non-statutory bodies, which meet the test as prescribed
in

Ramana

Dayaram

Shetty

versus

International

Airport

Authority of India, reported in (1979) 3 SCC 489, as reformulated in
the case of Ajay Hasia versus Khalid Mujib Sehravardi, reported in
(1981) 1 SCC 722. These tests are as under:i) Whether the entire share capital is held by the Government.
ii) Whether the corporation enjoys monopoly status conferred by
the state.
iii) Whether the functions of the corporation are governmental
functions or functions clearly related thereto.
iv) If a department of the government has been transferred to the
corporation.
v) Volume of financial assistance received from the state.
vi) Quantum of state control.
vii) Whether any statutory duties are imposed upon the
corporation.
viii) Character of corporation may change with respect to its

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 10

different functions.

10.

Analysing the tests formulated in Ajay Hasia's case

(supra), it was explained in Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra) that
these are not rigid principles and mere fact that a body satisfies one
of the tests, it does not, as a ex-hypothesi, follow that said body is a
“State” within the meaning of Article 12. For deciding the said status,
cumulative effect of the facts have to be examined so as to find out
whether the said body is financially, functionally and administratively
dominated by or under the control of the Government. The control of
the Government should be particular to that body and must be deep
and pervasive. A control, which is merely regulatory whether under
the statue or otherwise, would not make the said body a “State”.
11.

When we apply the aforesaid test laid down in Ajay Hasia's

case (supra) and also keep in mind the ratio of Pradeep Kumar
Biswas's case (supra), we do not think that the respondent No. 8
can be regarded as a “State” within the meaning of Article 12 of the
Constitution. Mere fact that statutory corporations have entered into

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 11

commercial contracts and granted loans to the respondent No. 8,
have nominated Directors on the Board of respondent No. 8 or hold
shares in the respondent No. 8, is not sufficient. The fact that the
State controlled Financial Institutions pursuant to contracts or due to
purchases from the share market cumulatively hold more than 50%
shares in the respondent No. 8, is also not sufficient to hold that the
respondent No. 8 is a “State”. The test is functional, administrative
and financial control of the Government which should be deep and
pervasive. It is admitted that the respondent No. 8 is a company
incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. It is a
listed company and it's shares are traded. The respondent no. 8 is a
commercial business venture for the purpose of making profits in
which the promoters and the public could have made investments to
get returns and reap profits. It is not an extended arm of the State.
The said company has entered into purely commercial contracts for
securing loans and finance for the commercial venture with the
statutory corporations and institutions of the Government of India. In
the said era private lending hardly existed. The relationship between

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 12

the respondent No. 8 and these statutory corporations/banks is that
of a borrower and a lender. It is a commercial business transaction
between the respondent no. 8 and the financial institutions. By
becoming shareholders of the respondent No. 8, the said
institutions/banks have also become investors with the underlining
purpose and objective to ensure that the investment made and loans
given are protected, not pilfered or misused. Nomination of Directors
by these statutory institutions/banks is not for the purpose of
controlling and managing the affairs of the respondent No. 8, and to
take over the said Company,rather, for the purpose of ensuring that
the investments made and the loans taken are not misutilised.
Nominated Directors normally do not oust and control the
management of the company. The company works under the control
and supervision of the promoters and private directors, who are in
overall charge of the affairs

and functioning of the company.

Nominated Directors may also ensure that there is compliance with
the contractual requirements and the terms on which the loans have
been granted. The role and conduct of the financial institutions is not

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 13

the subject matter of the Writ Petitions. The Company i.e., the
respondent no. 8 has a distinct personality and legal identity. It is not
a body constituted by the State Government or Central Government.
It is a Company incorporated under the General law i.e., the
Companies Act, 1956 and its affairs and functioning is regulated as
per provisions of the said Act. Whether the State has deep and
pervasive control over the respondent no. 8 could be established
when the body is financially, functionally and administratively
dominated by or under the Control of the Government. Mere
regulatory control

under a statute or a contract is not sufficient.

Doctrine of lifting of the corporate veil is applied by Courts when
circumstances justify and require the same to be resorted to. In the
present case the said doctrine is not applicable. Even if we apply the
said doctrine, there is no evidence and material to establish and it
cannot be said that the financial institutions controlled the affairs of
the respondent no. 8 and said control was pervasive. The objective
and purpose of applying the various tests is to decipher whether the
body is really an agency of the Government. If a body is not an

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 14

agency of the Government, it is not an “Authority” within the meaning
of Article 12 of the Constitution of India. By applying the said tests, it
cannot be held that the respondent No. 8 is a “State” as it is an
“instrumentality” or an “agency” of the Government. Thus, the
respondent no. 8 is not a State within Article 12 of the Constitution.
12.

Article 226 of the Constitution of India is plenary in nature

and confers powers on the High Courts of the country to issue writs.
The said Article reads as under:“1. Notwithstanding anything in Article 32
every High Court shall have power,
throughout the territories in relation to which it
exercises jurisdiction, to issue to any person
or authority, including in appropriate cases,
any Government, within those territories
directions, orders or writs, including writs in
the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus,
prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, or
any of them, for the enforcement of any of the
rights conferred by Part III and for any other
purpose.”

13.

The said Article states that every High Court has jurisdiction

to issue appropriate writs against any authority for enforcement of

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 15

rights conferred by Part III or for “any other purpose”.

The said

Article also states that writs can be issued to “any person”. The
expressions “any person” and “for any other purpose” have been
explained and elucidated upon by the Supreme Court.
14.

In G.

Bassi

Reddy's

and

it

was

held

these

as under:-

“27. It is true that a writ under Article 226 also
lies against a “person” for “any other
purpose”. The power of the High Court to
issue such a writ to “any person” can only
mean the power to issue such a writ to any
person to whom, according to the wellestablished principles, a writ lay. That a writ
may issue to an appropriate person for the
enforcement of any of the rights conferred by
Part III is clear enough from the language
used. But the words “and for any other
purpose” must mean “for any other purpose
for which any of the writs mentioned would,
according to well-established principles

issue”.
28. A writ under Article 226 can lie against a
“person” if it is a statutory body or performs a
public function or discharges a public or
statutory duty (Praga Tool corpn. v. C.A.

Union ).......................... In Praga Tool Corpn.
v. C.A. Imanual this Court construed Article
226 to hold that the High Court could issue a
writ of mandamus “to secure the performance
of a public or statutory duty in the
performance of which the one who applies for
it has a sufficient legal interest”. The Court
also held that : (SCC p.589, para 6)
“An
application
for
mandamus will not lie for an order of
reinstatement to an office which is
essentially of a private character nor
can
such
an
application
be
maintained to secure performance of
obligations owed by a company
towards its workmen or to resolve any
private dispute. (See, Sohan Lal v.
5
Union of India ).”
15.

It may be noted that in Praga Tool Corporation (supra)

referred to above by the Supreme Court the appellant company
therein at the material time was to the extent of 88%, owned by the
Union Government and the Government of Andhra Pradesh, who
held 56% and 32% shares respectively. However, the writ petition

5 AIR 1957 SC 529

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 17

filed by the workers was dismissed on the ground that the
incorporated company, the appellant therein, was not a statutory
corporation and was also not performing public duties.
16.

In the case of

Binni Limited (supra),

employees of the

company had filed a writ petition challenging right of the management
to terminate their services without assigning any reason by giving
one month notice or salary in lieu thereof. The employees were not
entitled to protection under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and had
prayed that they should be reinstated in service with back wages, as
the termination clause was illegal and violative of Article 23 of the
Contract Act, 1872.

The Supreme Court noticed the difference

between the public duties and contractual duties, which are a matter
of private law. Public duties are enforceable by Mandamus and issue
of Writs and can be made subject matter of a writ petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution.

Under the said Article, a Writ of

Mandamus can be issued even against a private authority in respect
of the public functions being discharged by the said authority. A writ
court can by its decision direct a private authority to correct or

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 18

enforce discharge of public functions. The term “public function” was
defined as one, which seeks to achieve collective benefit for public or
a section of public and is accepted by the public or that section of
the public as having authority to do so.

Bodies, exercise public

function when they intervene or participate in social or economic
affairs of public interest. Contractual rights, on the other hand, are
private rights, which can be enforced through ordinary contractual
remedies

by

filing

a

suit

performance and declaration.

for

injunction,

specific

High Courts while exercising

jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India do not issue
a Writ of Mandamus in matters of private law because Writs are
discretionary remedies normally issued to enforce public duties and
secondly, not usually granted where alternative remedies are
available. On the question whether the employees should be allowed
to invoke jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 on the basis
of a contract, the Supreme Court noticed that the courts should be
reluctant to exercise writ jurisdiction solely based upon private law
element. It was accordingly observed as under:-

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 19

“29. Thus, it can be seen that a writ of
mandamus or the remedy under Article 226 is
pre-eminently a public law remedy and is not
generally available as a remedy against
private wrongs. It is used for enforcement of
various rights of the public or to compel
public/statutory authorities to discharge their
duties and to act within their bounds. It may
be used to do justice when there is wrongful
exercise of power or a refusal to perform
duties. This writ is admirably equipped to
serve as a judicial control over administrative
actions. This writ could also be issued against
any private body or person, specially in view
of the words used in Article 226 of the
Constitution. However, the scope of
mandamus is limited to enforcement of public
duty. The scope of mandamus is determined
by the nature of the duty to be enforced,
rather than the identity of the authority
against whom it is sought. If the private body
is discharging a public function and the denial
of any right is in connection with the public
duty imposed on such body, the public law
remedy can be enforced. The duty cast on
the public body may be either statutory or
otherwise and the source of such power is
immaterial, but, nevertheless, there must be
the public law element in such action.
Sometimes, it is difficult to distinguish
between public law and private law remedies.
According to Halsburys
Laws of England , 3rd
Edn., Vol. 30, p. 682, 1317. A public
authority is a body, not necessarily a county
council, municipal corporation or other local

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 20

authority, which has public or statutory duties
to perform and which perform those duties
and carries out its transactions for the benefit
of the public and not for private profit.
There
cannot be any general definition of public
authority or public action. The facts of each
case decide the point.
30. A contract would not become statutory
simply because it is for construction of a
public utility and it has been awarded by a
statutory body. But nevertheless it may be
noticed that the Government or government
authorities at all levels are increasingly
employing contractual techniques to achieve
their regulatory aims. It cannot be said that
the exercise of those powers are free from
the zone of judicial review and that there
would be no limits to the exercise of such
powers, but in normal circumstances, judicial
review principles cannot be used to enforce
contractual obligations. When that contractual
power is being used for public purpose, it is
certainly amenable to judicial review. The
power must be used for lawful purposes and
not unreasonably.
31. The decision of the employer in these two
cases to terminate the services of their
employees cannot be said to have any
element of public policy. Their cases were
purely governed by the contract of
employment entered into between the
employees and the employer. It is not

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 21

appropriate to construe those contracts as
opposed to the principles of public policy and
thus void and illegal under Section 23 of the
Contract Act. In contractual matters even in
respect of public bodies, the principles of
judicial review have got limited application.
This was expressly stated by this Court in
State of U.P. v. Bridge & Roof Co. (India) Ltd.
and also in Kerala SEB v. Kurien E. Kalathil .
In the latter case, this Court reiterated that
the interpretation and implementation of a
clause in a contract cannot be the subjectmatter of a writ petition. Whether the contract
envisages actual payment or not is a
question of construction of contract. If a term
of a contract is violated, ordinarily, the
remedy is not a writ petition under Article
226.
32. Applying these principles, it can very well
be said that a writ of mandamus can be
issued against a private body which is not 
State
within the meaning of Article 12 of the
Constitution and such body is amenable to
the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution and the High Court under Article
226 of the Constitution can exercise judicial
review of the action challenged by a party.
But there must be a public law element and it
cannot be exercised to enforce purely private
contracts entered int o between the parties.”

17.

In the case of Binni Limited (supra), earlier decision in the

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 22

case of VST Industries Limited (supra) was also relied upon. In
this case again there was a dispute between the incorporated
company and workers union, who had filed a writ petition seeking a
Writ of Mandamus.

The following proposition summarised by D.

Smith, Woolf and Jowell's Judicial Review of Administrative Action
was quoted with approval :“(1) The test of whether a body is performing
a public function, and is hence amenable to
judicial review, may not depend upon the
source of its power or whether the body is
ostensibly a 'public' or a 'private' body.
(2) The principles of judicial review prima
facie govern the activities of bodies
performing public functions.
(3) However, not all decisions taken by
bodies in the course of their public functions
are the subject-matter of judicial review. In
the following two situations judicial review will
not normally be appropriate even though the
body may be performing a public function:
(a) Where some other branch of
the law more appropriately
governs the dispute between the
parties. In such a case, that
branch of the law and its remedies
should and normally will be

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 23

applied; and
(b) where there is a contract
between the litigants. In such a
case the express or implied terms
of the agreement should normally
govern the matter. This reflects
the normal approach of English
Law, namely, that the terms of a
contract will normally govern the
transaction, or other relationship
between the parties, rather than
the general law. Thus, where a
special method of resolving
disputes (such as arbitration or
resolution by private or domestic
tribunals) has been agreed upon
by the parties (expressly or by
necessary
implication),
that
regime, and not judicial review,
will normally govern the dispute.”

18.

Following VST Industries Limited (supra), and General

Manager

Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills Limited, Sultanpur, U.P.

versus Satrughan Nishad and Others, reported in (2003) 8 SCC
639, in Federal Bank Limited versus Sagar Thomas and Others,
reported in (2003) 10 SCC 733, it has been held that the High Court
should not entertain a writ petition against a private limited company
for issue of mandamus on disputes relating to private contracts of

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 24

employment. In Federal Bank Limited (supra), the Supreme Court
rejected the contention that a private company, which carries on
business of banking and had an element of statutory or public duty
and, therefore, writ jurisdiction under Article 226 should have been
exercised. It was held that the mere fact that the commercial activity
undertaken by the company because of nature of business had
impact on the economy of the country in general, does not by itself
justify the conclusion that the company was discharging duties or
functions of a public nature. This judgment in fact takes care of the
argument of the appellant that the respondent No. 8 is performing
public function, as it is a scheduled industry under the Industries
(Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 or is otherwise performing
public functions because it is engaged in commercial venture or
manufacturing tubes and tyres and was the third largest company of
the country at the time, when services of the appellant was
terminated. In view of the ratio of these judgments, it cannot be said
that the respondent no.8 is performing public functions and it is
amenable to writ jurisdiction as the subject matter is a private

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 25

contract between the appellant and the respondent no.8. The
contentions of the appellant are therefore rejected.
19.

Learned counsel for the appellant had also relied upon two

decisions of the Supreme Court in the cases of Central Inland
Water Transport Corporation Limited and Another versus Brojo
Nath Ganguli and Another, reported in (1986) 3 SCC 156 and
Delhi Transport Corporation versus D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress
and Others, reported in 1991 SUPP. (1) SCC 600.

These two

decisions were also relied upon the before the Supreme Court in the
case of Binni Limited (supra). The Supreme Court explained that
these were Public Sector Undertakings and public policy and
principles were applied, but the same cannot be applied to private
bodies as they stand on different footing.

In both cases, the

authorities were “State” within the meaning of Article 12 of the
Constitution of India.
20.

Learned counsel for the appellant has also made reference

to a decision of Division Bench of this Court in Kuldip Mehta versus
Union of India, reported in 1993 (2) Delhi Lawyer 196. This decision

LPA No. 511/2000

Page 26

was also relied upon before the learned Single Judge, but was rightly
distinguished for the reasons stated. In the said case, the petitioner
therein was appointed to a public limited company in which 50.91%
shares were held by private investors. However, the Court noticed
that in spite of the shareholding pattern, the affairs of the said
company were managed and controlled by National Textile
Corporation.

After the decision of the Supreme Court in M/s.

Doypack Systems Private Limited versus Union of India and

circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.
