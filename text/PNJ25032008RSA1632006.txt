PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

Heard learned counsel for the parties.

2.

Appellants filed a suit for possession and damages

against Smt.Daljit Kaur, the respondent, in the instant appeal.
They alleged that they were the owner of property No.C-394,
Avantika, Rohini, Delhi-110085. They claimed ownership under
a Will dated 26.11.1999 purported to have been executed by
Late Smt.Narinder Kaur wife of Shri Pritam Anar Singh Dang.
3.

It may be noted that plaintiff No.1 is the son of

RSA No.163-66/06

page 1 of 6

Smt.Narinder Kaur. Second plaintiff is the wife of plaintiff No.1.
Plaintiff Nos.3 and 4 are the daughters of plaintiff Nos.1 and 2.
4.

It

was

stated

in

the

plaint

that

the

defendant/respondent Smt.Daljit Kaur was permitted to occupy
a room, toilet and a bathroom on the ground floor of the
property in question by Smt.Narinder Kaur. It was stated that
the plaintiffs determined the said right of the defendant to
continue to occupy the said portion of the house.

On the

allegation afore-noted suit for recovery of possession was filed.
5.
than

It may be noted that Smt.Daljit Kaur is none other
the

sister

of

plaintiff

No.1

i.e.

the

daughter

of

Smt.Narinder Kaur.
6.

In her written statement, Smt.Daljit Kaur disputed

the Will relied upon.

She stated that her brother had been

disowned by her mother.

She stated that her mother had

allowed her to occupy a portion of the house. She asserted a
right in the house.
7.

On the pleadings of the parties 7 issues were

framed. The same read as under:“1. Whether the suit is without any cause of action?
OPD.
2.
Whether the suit is not properly valued as so
alleged in the P.O. No.3 of WS, if so, its effect? OPD.
3.

Whether the suit is bad for non-joinder of the

RSA No.163-66/06

page 2 of 6

parties? OPD.
4.
Whether the will dated 26.11.1999 was executed
by deceased Smt.Narinder Kaur in favour of the
plaintiff? Is, its effect? OPP.
5.
Whether plaintiffs are entitled for the recovery of
the possession of suit property? OPP.
6.
Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to damages
from the defendant? If so, at what rate and what
extent? OPP.
7.
8.

Relief.”
Needless to state issue No.4 was the main issue on

which the fate of the litigation hinged. In view of the evidence
led, learned Trial Judge recorded a finding that the Will in
question Ex.PW-2/1 was duly proved.

Accordingly, vide

judgment and decree dated 14.10.2004 suit for possession was
decreed and damages were awarded at the rate of Rs.2,000/per month from 1.7.2001 till possession was handed over.
9.

Smt.Daljit Kaur filed an appeal against the judgment

and decree dated 14.10.2004.

The same was registered as

RCA No.58/2004.
10.
Judge

For unexplainable reasons the learned Appellate
permitted

Smt.Daljit

Kaur

to

raise

a

plea

that

Smt.Narinder Kaur was not the owner of the suit property. The
said plea has been dealt with and accepted by the learned
Appellate Judge. The findings are as under:-

RSA No.163-66/06

page 3 of 6

“I have considered the rival contentions raised by
learned counsel for the parties. The polemical point
involved in the present appeal is as to whether the
respondent had become owner of the suit property by
virtue of Will dated 26.11.1999, left by late
Smt.Narinder Kaur. The learned Civil Judge ruled that
the execution of the aforesaid Will has been proved
beyond doubt and as such the respondents had
become owner of the suit property and consequently
decreed the suit. I do not see eye to eye with the view
taken by learned Civil Judge. It cannot be gain-said
that in a suit for possession based on title, as
happened in the present case, the plaintiff is dutybound to establish his ownership rights of property in
dispute.
Admittedly, the property in question
belonged to DDA. The entire case is silent as to who
was the first allottee of the suit property by way of Will
left by late Smt.Narinder Kaur, it needs to be
substantiated that Smt.Narinder Kaur had got
ownership rights with regard to the suit property.
I have shifted the entire records of trial court with
great circumspection but failed to find out any iota of
evidence such as record or allotment letter issued by
the DDA in respect of suit property in favour of late
Smt.Narinder Kaur or someone else. Thus, it remains
a mystery as to how the suit property belonged to
Smt.Narinder Kaur. Unless late Smt.Narinder Kaur had
any proprietory rights to the suit property, in my view
she had absolutely no right to bequeath the same by
way of Will in favour of the plaintiff. On the same
principle she was unable to pass on a better title in
favour of the plaintiff than she herself had. The
authorities cited on behalf of the respondent do not
come to his rescue because all the authorities cited by
respondent talk about litigation based on previous
possession whereas, the first para of the plaint filed by
respondent makes it crystal clear that he sought
possession of suit property being owner on the basis
of Will dated 26/11/99 hence, the observation made
by learned Civil Judge that respondent had become
owner of the suit property on the basis of the Will is
not based on any material and is a perverse one.
Accordingly, the observation made by learned Civil
Judge on this score is set aside. The result is that the
RSA No.163-66/06

page 4 of 6

appeal is accepted. The impugned judgment dated
14/10/04 passed by learned Civil Judge being perverse
one is hereby set aside. Parties are left to bear their
own costs. File be consigned to RR.”
11.

Suffice would it be to record that the brother and

sister were not at variance on the issue that their mother was
the owner of the property in question. In the written statement
by Smt.Daljit Kaur she nowhere disputed the title of her mother
to the suit property. She never pleaded that her mother could
not bequeath the suit property as her mother was not the
owner thereof. She only challenged the Will.
12.

Needless to state since title of the mother to the suit

property was not disputed by Smt.Daljit Kaur obviously no
issue was required to be framed on the title of Late
Smt.Narinder Kaur to the suit property.

Indeed, none was

framed.
13.

From nowhere has the learned Appellate Judge

raised an issue; permitted to raise an issue, which was not the
subject matter of the pleadings of the parties.
14.

The position therefore is that the First Appellate

Court having completely misdirected the inquiry the impugned
judgment and decree dated 4.3.2006 disposing of RCA
No.58/04 is required to be set aside. The first appeal has to be
restored for adjudication on merits. I do so for the reason the

RSA No.163-66/06

page 5 of 6

learned Appellate Judge has not considered the objections
raised in the appeal pertaining to the finding recorded by the
learned Trial Judge that the Will Ex.PW-2/1 is the last legal and
valid testament of the deceased Smt.Narinder Kaur.
15.

No substantial question of law has been framed by

me for the reason the impugned judgment passed by the
learned First Appellate Judge is being set aside and the matter
is being remanded for fresh adjudication.
16.

The appeal stands disposed of setting aside the

impugned judgment and decree dated 4.3.2006 passed by Shri
K.S.Mohi, Additional District Judge, Delhi disposing of RCA
No.58/04. The said appeal is restored for decision on merits.
17.

Needless to state, learned Appellate Judge would

take note of the instant decision while deciding the appeal.
18.

Parties are directed to appear before the learned

Additional District & Sessions Judge on 12.5.2008. They would
thereafter appear before the Court concerned where the
appeal is listed after restoration.
19.

No costs.
