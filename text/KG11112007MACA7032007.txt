KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
A short controversy is involved in the present appeal
as the appellant is seeking enhancement

in the compensation

amount as awarded by the Tribunal.

On advance notice Mr. Kamal Chaudhary, Advocate
appears for respondent no.3. Respondents 1 & 2 are the driver and
owner of the offending vehicle. The service on respondents 1 & 2
is dispensed with as the offending vehicle is duly insured with the
respondent no.3 and respondent no.3 is the only contesting party
in the present appeal.
Both the counsel for the parties state that the matter
may be taken up for final disposal.
The brief facts relevant for deciding the present appeal
are that on 2.3.2006 at about 11.05 p.m. the deceased Shri
Rajesh Arora was hit by motor cycle No. DL-4S-AW-9418, driven
by the respondent no.1 which came from the opposite side in a
rash and negligent manner at Mukherjee Nagar, Bandh Road due
to which the deceased got seriously injured and succumbed to his
injuries.
Counsel for the appellant has mainly contended that
the Tribunal has not taken into consideration

the increase in

inflation and cost of living, therefore, no increase on account of

MAC APP No.703/2007

page 2 of 7

inflation and increase in price index has been taken into
consideration by the Tribunal. Counsel further contends that the
Tribunal has wrongly taken into consideration 1/3rd income of the
deceased towards personal expenses.

The appellants are also

aggrieved on account of the meager amount of compensation of
Rs.20,000/- towards loss of consortium besides not granting any
compensation to the small children for the loss of love and
affection.
Per contra, Mr. Kamal Chaudhary, counsel for
respondent no.3 contends that there is no infirmity or illegality in
the impugned award passed by the Tribunal. Placing reliance on
the judgment of the Apex Court in Bijoy Kumar Dugar Vs.
Bidya Dhar Dutta, (2006) 3 SCC 242, counsel for the
respondent contends that in the said case also the Apex Court
has not taken any note of such increase in the price index or
inflation, therefore, in accordance thereof no increase in the
income of the deceased can be taken into consideration in the
present case also. Counsel also contends that

MAC APP No.703/2007

the Tribunal has

page 3 of 7

rightly deducted 1/3rd income towards personal expenses of the
deceased.
I have heard counsel for the parties and have perused
the record also.
Perusal of the award shows that the deceased was
running a STD Booth and a General Store. The appellant had
proved the income tax return of the deceased for the assessment
year 2005-2006 and the income of the deceased was assessed on
the basis of the said assessment year at Rs.81,200/-. For claiming
any increase

in the income in the said

business, appellants

should have placed some material on record but perusal of the
award shows that no such material was placed on record. The
Apex Court in the recent judgment in Bijoy Kumar Dugar's
case (Supra) has discussed the said issue threadbare. It would be
appropriate to refer to the observation of the Apex Court as under:
“The mere assertion of the claimants that the
deceased would have earned more than Rs 8000
to Rs 10,000 per month in the span of his lifetime
cannot be accepted as legitimate income unless all
the relevant facts are proved by leading cogent and
reliable evidence before MACT. The claimants
have to prove that the deceased was in a trade
MAC APP No.703/2007

page 4 of 7

where he would have earned more from time to
time or that he had special merits or qualifications
or opportunities which would have led to an
improvement in his income. There is no evidence
produced on record by the claimants regarding
future prospects of increase of income in the
course of employment or business or profession, as
the case may be.”

In the light of the above position, I do not find any
force in the argument of counsel for the appellant claiming that the
Tribunal should have taken into consideration the inflationary
trends and price index for assessing the correct income of the
deceased in a span of 13 years period. I do not find any infirmity in
the award in this regard.
As regards the last contention of the counsel for the
appellant that the Tribunal has awarded a meager amount of
Rs.20,000/- towards the loss of consortium and the non grant of
any amount towards loss of love and affection, I find some force i
the argument of counsel for

the appellant.

In this case the

deceased at the time of the accident was of 47 years of age and he
is survived by his wife, one daughter and one minor son. In the
recent judgment of the Apex Court in Mohinder Kaur & Ors.
MAC APP No.703/2007

page 5 of 7

Vs. Hira Nand Sindhi (Ghoriwala) & Anr. 2007 ACJ 2123,
the Apex Court has upheld the award of Rs.50,000/- towards loss
of consortium and has allowed the interest @ 9% p.a. from the
date of filing of the petition. The date of filing of the petition in
the said case was 20.5.1982, while in the present case the date of
accident is 2.3.2006. The Division Bench of Madras High Court in
United India Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Sulocahan &
Ors., III (2007) ACC 50 (DB),

has awarded Rs.50,000/-

towards the loss of consortium and Rs.25,000/- each to the
daughter and mother of the deceased towards loss of love and
affection.
Considering the import of the aforesaid judgments, I
enhance compensation of Rs.20,000/- to Rs.50,000/- towards
loss of consortium and for loss of love and affection, I grant
Rs.25,000/- each to the children.
Counsel for the appellant states that the respondent
insurance company has already complied with the award. Let
differential amount of Rs.80,000/- be paid by the respondent with
up-to-date interest @7.5 % p.a. from the date of filing of the
MAC APP No.703/2007

petition till realisation.
With these directions, appeal stands disposed of.
