Before dealing with the matter in issue, I must record
displeasure at the way learned ASJ. has dealt with the

application seeking anticipatory bail filed by the petitioner.
3.

Needless to state, the warm and loving hands of a

Judge are the only true guarantee of preserving the life and
liberty of the citizens.

When these hands turn cold, the first

4.

The FIR has been registered on being forwarded by the

Union Minister of Water Resources. The complainant is one Ishrat
Tasleem Shah.
5.

In the complaint made to the Minister, complainant

states that he is trading under the name Marvlex Trading
Company and is based in Srinagar. He states that his company
deposited Rs.5 lac with a company called Savera. He states that
the company informed him that Rs.5 lacs would be returned but
in installments. He states that some cheques which were issued
towards return of Rs.5 lacs have bounced.
6.

Petitioner who is the Administrative Officer of Savera

sought anticipatory bail in the above captioned FIR before the
learned ASJ. He brought to the notice of the learned Judge that on
26.4.2006 a memorandum of understanding was arrived at
between his company i.e. Savera and the firm of the complainant.
He stated that as per the MOU, the complainant was to deposit
Rs.10 lacs with his company for dispatch of certain goods. He
stated in his application that the complainant deposited only Rs.5
lacs. He stated that the MOU was breached by the complainant
but his company agreed to return Rs.5 lacs.

He stated in his

application that Rs.1.3 lacs has been returned and that balance
would be returned.
7.

Qua himself, petitioner stated that being an employee

of Savera he had no role to play in the transaction.

8.

Surprisingly, in spite of the fact that whatever has

been stated by the petitioner stands corroborated by the
Investigation Officer, learned ASJ has rejected the application
seeking anticipatory bail recording that in view of the nature of
allegations, there is no ground for grant of anticipatory bail.
9.

To say the least, the order passed by the learned ASJ

reveals the utter dis-concern of the learned Judge to human
rights.
10.

What are the nature of allegations which have led the

learned Judge to hold that no ground is made out for grant of
anticipatory bail have unfortunately remained in the mind of the
Judge. They do not find a reflection in the order dated 20.7.2007.

company.

Firstly, petitioner is an employee of the accused
Secondly, petitioner had no role in the transaction

between his employer and the complainant. Thirdly, employer of
the petitioner admitted liability to pay back Rs.5 lacs to the
complainant and in part satisfaction of said admission has paid
Rs.1.3 lacs to the complainant. Lastly, it is the complainant who
is in breach of a civil obligation. Notwithstanding that, the other
contracting party agreed to restitute the benefit received under
the civil transaction.
13.

Petition accordingly stands disposed of directing that

A copy of this order would also be sent to the

Registrar General of this court who would forward the same to the
Inspecting Judge of Sh. Mahavir Singhal.
