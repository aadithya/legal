(1)

The petitioner by letter dt.18/12/1988 was allotted a shop bearing no.S-

29, CSC, Rewari Line, Delhi. The petitioner was required to deposit 25% of
the reserve price of the shop amounting to Rs.34,245/- within 60 days of the
issue of the said allotment letter. The petitioner was also required to submit an
undertaking that he would pay balance 75% of the amount of sale

consideration with 6% interest. The petitioner deposited Rs.34,245/- vide
challan dated 11/1/1989. The terms and conditions of the allotment provides
as under :
“After approval of the result of draw of lots by the VC/DDA or
such other officers as may be authorized by VC/DDA in this
behalf the successful applicants shall be informed in writing about
the shops/stalls etc. allotted to them and the successful
applicants shall have to pay within 60 days from the date of issue
of allotment letter 25% of the reserved price in cash or by bank
draft in favour of DDA and deposit this amount in the Central
Bank/State Bank of India, Vikas Sadan. The balance amount be
payable in 24 equal monthly installments together with the
interest @ 6% per annum.
In case the applicant fails to pay the balance 75% of the reserved
price on monthly installments as may be fixed within the time
permitted the allotment will be cancelled and the amount
deposited would be forfeited. After such cancellation VC/DDA
shall be competent to make allotment of the cancelled space to
any person.”
(2)

The term related to payment of ground rent which reads as under :
“In addition to the premium for the space, the allottees shall pay
ground rent for the space allotted to him @ Rs.1525/- per annum
w.e.f. the date taking over of possession. the allottee shall have
also to deposit the maintenance charges equal to the amount of
ground rent till the services of the shopping centre are handed
over to MCD. The amount of ground rent and maintenance
charges is payable in advance.
The rate of ground rent shall be subject to enhancement to such
rate as may be decided by lessor after the period of thirty years.
An interest of 10% per annum or such other rate as the
DDA/lessor may in its absolute discretion decide from time to
time, without prejudice to the right of re-entry under the lease shall

be charged on all delayed payments. Such interest will be
calculated for full fortnight or month as the case may be and not
for fraction thereof.”
3. After deposit of 25% of the amount the petitioner, was handed over and

given possession of the shop on 18/2/1991.
4. DDA vide letter dt.17/12/1991 revised the total sale consideration of the

shop and revised demand notice was issued. The petitioner challenged
the revised demand letter by way of the present writ petition which was
filed in the year 1993.
5. It is admitted case of the parties that the revised demand letter cannot

be sustained and upheld in view of the decision of Division Bench of this
court in the case of Devender Kumar & Anr. Vs. DDA & Anr. reported in
54 (1994) DLT 68 (DB). To this extent there is no dispute now between
the petitioner and the DDA as DDA has accepted the said decision and
the fact that the petitioner is also entitled to benefit of the said decision.
The revised demand letter dated 17/12/1991 is accordingly quashed.
6. The only dispute surviving today is whether the petitioner is liable to pay

interest in terms of the Clause C2 of the terms of allotment quoted
above and in terms of allotment letter dt.18/11/1988. The terms of
allotment and the allotment letter are clear that the petitioner was
required to pay 75% of the balance amount with 6% interest. This
payment was to be made within 24 months. Admittedly, the said

balance amount as stated in letter dt.18/11/1988 was paid by the
petitioner on 24/12/1997. Therefore, I feel the petitioner is liable to pay
interest on the balance 75% of the sale consideration in terms of
demand letter i.e. w.e.f 17/2/1989. The petitioner did not at any time
dispute the total sale consideration mentioned in the letter dt.18/11/1988
and should have himself come forward and deposited the said amount,
even if he was disputing the enhanced demand letter dt.17/12/1991.
There is no reason and justification for not depositing 75% balance
amount in terms with the letter dated 18/11/1988 and as per terms of
allotment. Moreover, rate of interest which has been charged from the
petitioner is 6%. The petitioner had retained the balance sale
consideration of 75%, though he has been enjoying possession of the
shop since 1991.
7. In these circumstances I do not find the claim of the DDA that the

petitioner should pay 6% interest in accordance with the allotment letter
dt.18/11/1988 and as per terms and conditions of allotment is unjustified
or contrary to law. This contention of DDA is upheld.
8. It is also admitted by the petitioner that he did not pay ground rent as

stipulated in the terms and conditions of allotment. Therefore, as per the
said terms the petitioner is liable to pay pay 10% interest in case of

delayed payment of ground rent. The petitioner is liable to pay ground
rent also.
9. I find that the writ petition filed by Mr. Devender Kumar and Anr. (Supra)

was allowed with costs quantified at Rs.1,000/- each. The petitioner will
be also entitled to the said cost. The cost will be adjusted while making
payment of interest. The interest and ground rent will be paid by the
petitioner in 2 equal installments. The first installment will be paid on or
before 15th March, 2008 and the second installment will be paid by 30th
April, 2008.
Writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
