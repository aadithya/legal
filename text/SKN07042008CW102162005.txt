ORDER
07.04.2008

1. I have examined the affidavit filed by MCD. It is stated in the affidavit
that the area in question has now been declared as a commercial
area. The question of alleged misuse as the property is being used
for commercial purpose, has become infructuous.
2. The other allegation in the writ petition is with regard to the
unauthorized construction. (It may be stated that in the prayer clause
no specific direction in this regard has been prayed for). Learned
counsel for MCD states that the property was already booked for
unauthorized construction and demolition order dated 22.3.2005 was

passed. However, the said demolition could not be executed in view
of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006 but now that the
monotorium period is over, action will be taken by MCD in
accordance with law. In view of the statement made by the counsel
for the respondent the writ petition is disposed of.
3. However, Deputy Commissioner, City Zone, MCD will inform the
petitioner within six months about the status of unauthorized
construction, if any, in the property of respondent no.3 and action
taken by MCD in that regard. Similarly, the property of the petitioner
will be also inspected and action against unauthorized construction
will be taken as per law and the MCD will also write a letter to
respondent no.3 within six months informing him about the
unauthorized construction, if any, and the action taken.
Writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
