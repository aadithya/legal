1.
This application has been filed on behalf of the complainant (Smt Shalini
Gupta). She seeks a clarification / correction in the order dated 16.10.2006 to
the effect that but for Section 498-A, all other charges as framed by the courts
below remain the same meaning thereby that the charge under Section 406 IPC
is to be framed against the petitioner Nos. 1 and 3 and the charge under Section
417 is to be framed against the petitioner Nos. 1 & 2 and the charges under

CRLMA13960/06inCRL.REV.P.168.05

page No.1 of 4

Sections 313 and 342 are to be framed against all the petitioners (i.e. petitioner
Nos. 1 to 5).

2.

The order dated 16.10.2006 clearly indicates that the charge under

Section 498-A cannot be framed against any of the accused. Insofar as the
charge under Section 406 IPC is concerned, the same has been framed in
respect of the petitioner No.1 (Mohit Gupta) and the petitioner No.3 (Sita
Gupta), as indicated by the applicant. With regard to the charge under Section
417 IPC, it is also clear that it has been framed against the petitioner No.1 and
the petitioner No.2. This is also as per the understanding of the applicant.

3.

The only question that remains to be considered is with respect to the

charges under Sections 313 and 342 IPC. According to the learned counsel for
the complainant / applicant, this court had in paragraph 11, observed as under:“In these circumstances this revision petition is a partly allowed
in the sense that the charge under section 498-A against the
petitioners does not arise and stands cancelled. However, the
other charges, as framed by the courts below, remain the same.
Relying on the latter sentence, the learned counsel for the applicant submitted
that this court meant that the charge under Section 498-A stands deleted, but all
other charges as framed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge would remain
and, therefore, the charges have to be framed against all the petitioners in
respect of Sections 313 and 342 IPC. However, it must be noted that the

CRLMA13960/06inCRL.REV.P.168.05

page No.2 of 4

aforesaid sentence which has been referred to by the learned counsel for the
complainant / applicant was immediately followed by the following:“This means that the charge under section 313 is to be framed
against the Mohit Gupta and Sita Gupta. The charge under
section 406 IPC is to be framed in respect of Mohit Gupta and
his mother Sita Gupta. The charge under section 417 IPC is to
be framed in respect of Mohit Gupta and his father. There is no
question of any charge under section 342 IPC. As indicated in
the impugned order itself, there are no allegations of wrongful
confinement of the complainant in the house. Therefore, the
charge under section 342 IPC is to be deleted. It appears that a
charge under section 495 IPC is also made out and the same
should also be framed insofar as Mohit Gupta is concerned
particularly as the ingredients of the offence have already been
alleged in the complaint made by Shalini, a person aggrieved.
Vineet Gupta and his wife Sangeeta Gupta are discharged. With
these directions this revision petition stands disposed of.”
4.

Clearly, the sentence referred to by the learned counsel for the

complainant / applicant has been qualified by the following sentences and any
doubts that may have arisen because of the construction of the said sentence
have been set at rest. The result is that the petitioner No.1 stands charged under
Sections 313/406/417/495 IPC. The petitioner No.2 stands charged with the
offence under Section 417 IPC and the petitioner No.3 of the offences under
Sections 313/406 IPC. The petitioner Nos. 4 & 5 have been discharged.

5.

This application stands dismissed.
