1.

The petitioners who were directly recruited as Asstt.

Company Commander in I.T.B.P. in 1974 were further promoted
as Company Commanders and confirmed as such in the year
1980. On the other hand, respondents no. 3 to 18 (hereinafter
referred to as private respondents) were recruited as Assistant
Company Commander in the year 1980 and were promoted to the
post of the Company Commanders/Dy SP in the year 1984.

WP (C) No. 2178/1996

2.

The

promotional

post

from

the

post

of

Company

Commander/Dy. SP is that of Asstt. Commandant (Re-designated
as Deputy Commandant). The second petitioner was promoted to
the post of Asstt. Commandant (Deputy Commandant) on
06.5.1988 while the first petitioner was promoted to the said post
on 06.7.1989.

3.

Later a Writ Petition (CWP No. 885/89) was filed by R.S.

Pathania i.e. the private respondents challenging the promotion of
certain Subedar/Inspector (non gazetted) (their juniors other than
the petitioners) to the post of Asstt. Commandant/equivalent
post.

In the said Writ Petition directions were given by this court

to respondents 1 and 2 on 26.7.1994 to consider the private
respondents for promotion to the post of Asstt. Commandant (redesignated as Deputy Commandant) by making the following
observation:“It may be recalled that the petitioners
were directly recruited to the post of
Assistant Company Commanders on June
12, 1980. Those were admittedly gazette
posts and “in the Force” too. Thus, on May
6, 1988 when Respondents 3 to 15 were
considered for promotion, they petitioners
had already put in nearly 8 years of
gazette service in the Force. There claim
for being considered for promotion to the
post of Assistant Commandant could not
thus be ignored.
What should then be done?
Since the petitioners (Respondents no.
3 to 18 herein) had rendered qualifying
period of gazetted service in the Force,
they ought to have been considered for
promotion to the post of Assistant
Commandant.
As this was not done,
Respondents 1 and 2 are directed to
consider them for promotion on their
WP (C) No. 2178/1996

Page 2 of 12

record as on the date when they ought to
have been considered and is selected.
Their position will be adjusted in the
seniority list”.

4.

The aforesaid judgment was delivered by taking into

consideration section 105 of CRPF (Second Amendment) Rule
1985 sub para 3-(A) (b) which provides that for the post of Asstt.
Commandant five years gazetted service in Force from amongst
Commanding Commanders or Quarter Masters or Asstt. Principals
Central Training College of the Central Reserve Police Force was
sufficient.

On the strength of this judgment, the private

respondents were promoted as Asstt. Commandants (Deputy
Commandants) by the Review DPC held on 22.9.1995 w.e.f.
February 1988.

Subsequently, a revised seniority list dated

29.2.1996 was circulated by respondent no. 2 wherein the private
respondents were shown senior to petitioners no. 1 and 2.

5.

Petitioners aggrieved by the aforesaid action of respondents

have filed the present Writ Petition. They have submitted that
action of the respondents 1 and 2 showing the petitioners as
juniors of the private respondents who were their juniors even on
the strength of the orders passed by this court in the aforesaid
writ petition dated 26.7.1994 and not granting benefit of the said
judgment to them is unsustainable being arbitrary and contrary
to law. In this regard, the petitioners have made three folds
submissions:-

i) The promotional post of Company Commander/Dy.SP is Asstt.
Commandant (now named as Deputy Commandant). To be
WP (C) No. 2178/1996

Page 3 of 12

eligible for that post, as per the revised eligibility conditions as
circulated by the Government of India vide their office order
bearing no. I-45026/5/82/Pers.II, dated 29.10.1987 the incumbent
must have to his credit at least six years „gazetted service‟ in the
Force at the time of his consideration whereas the judgment
delivered by this court in Pathania‟s case (supra) is based on rule
105 CRPF which provide only five years service and was
superseded.
ii) Once the petitioners had already been promoted on the
strength of the rules applicable, the private respondents who
were promoted subsequently could not have been shown senior
to them.
iii)Even if the judgment in Pathania‟s case is to be taken as a
correct judgment, though it is not, the petitioners should also
have been given benefit thereof and should have been promoted
as Deputy Commandant w.e.f. 21.11.1979 when they acquired
five years gazette service in the Force.
6.

Thus the petitioners sought issuance of a writ/directions in

the nature of Certiorari for quashing the final revised seniority list
in the grade of Deputy Commandant (GD) in ITBP as on 01.1.1993
circulated by the respondent no.

2 vide memo number 1-

1093/4195/Estt/A-426, dated 29.2.1996 with further directions to
prepare a fresh seniority list after assigning proper seniority to
the petitioners in the said list.

A further prayer is made for a direction to the respondents
no. 1 and 2 to grant them also the benefit of the judgment
delivered in the case of R.S. Pathania (supra) by considering them
as

qualified

for

the

post

of

Asstt.

Commandant/Deputy

Commandant at the time of their initial considerations.

WP (C) No. 2178/1996

Page 4 of 12

7.

The respondents 1 and 2 have contested the matter.

According to them, the writ petition filed by the petitioner is
basically to seek promotion as Deputy Commandant w.e.f.
21.11.1979 and further grant of subsequent promotion despite
the fact that the petitioners were not promoted in the year 1979
nor they objected to the same. Thus they are precluded to
challenge their seniority after a period of 16 years.

It is also

stated by the respondents that the contentions of the petitioners
seeking benefit of R.S. Pathania’s case (supra) is blowing hot
and cold in the same breath as on the one hand they alleged that
the private respondents could not have been promoted to the
post of Asstt. Commandant/Deputy Commandant having not
completed six years of Group A Services in view of the
Government of India letter No. 45026/2/85/Pers/II, dated 29th Oct.
1987, while, on the other hand, maintaining Rule 105 of the CRPF
Rule as redundant despite directions given to the respondent 1
and 2 by the High Court on 26th July, 1994 to consider the private
respondents for promotion to the post of Asstt. Commandant on
the basis of Rule 105 of CRPF Rule in R.S. Pathania’s case
(supra) to which, they were not even a party. They have also not
challenged the said judgment.

While
by

the

replying to the merits of the case, it is also stated

respondents,

that

the

private

respondents

were

considered for promotion by review DPC and promoted as
Assistant

Commandant

(now

re-designated

as

Deputy

Commandant) w.e.f. 1988 notionally on the basis of the judgment
delivered in Pathania’s case and accordingly seniority was

WP (C) No. 2178/1996

Page 5 of 12

assigned to them.

As regard the petitioners it is submitted that

they were considered for the promotion to the post of Asstt.
Commandant (now re-designated as Dy. Commandant) by the
DPC held on 7.7.1987 and thereafter by DPC held on 25.2.1988,
while

the

petitioner.

2

was

promoted

recommendation of DPC held on 25.2.1988.

on

the

basis

of

Petitioner no. 1 was

superseded by his juniors even in these two DPCs and was
promoted on the basis of recommendation of DPC held on
22.9.1988. The review DPC was held in compliance of orders of
this court in R.S. Pathania’s case (supra). It is stated that the
post of Asstt. Deputy Commandant is a selection post. Even few
officers belonging to directly recruited batch of Asstt. Coy
Commander of 1980 batch were also superseded by their junior in
view of the grading given by the DPC.

As such no harm was

caused to the petitioners and if petitioners had any grudge then
they should have challenged the above mentioned judgment. It is
stated that by way of present writ petition, they cannot challenge
the judgment of this court. It is also submitted that prior to
enforcement of ITBPF Act, 1992 and Rules made thereunder,
ITBPF was regulated under the provisions of CRPF Act, 1949 and
CRPF rules 1955 made thereunder.

In view of Transitory

provisions laid down in rule 187 of ITBP Rules 1994.

8.

Learned counsel appearing for respondents 1 and 2 has

submitted, that revised instructions were brought to the notice to
the court which decided in R.S. Pathania’s case (supra).

A

specific reference to the averments in the counter affidavit in that

WP (C) No. 2178/1996

Page 6 of 12

case has been set out as under in the counter affidavit to the
present writ petition:-

“The letter dated 29th Oct. 87 issued by
MHA has been brought to the notice of
Hon‟ble High Court at the time of hearing
of CWP No. 885/89 and the same had been
annexed with the counter affidavit to the
said writ petition as Annexure –R.XI. The
promotion of respondents 3 to 18 to the
post of Dy. Commandant has been made in
the compliance of orders of 26.7.1994 of
this Hon‟ble High Court in CWP No. 885/89,
as such same are legal and valid.”
9.

It is also stated that the final seniority list was prepared,

circulated after inviting objections from the concerned persons
and due compliance of principle of natural justice, service
jurisprudence and rules, the final seniority list issued on
29.2.1996 is in order and as such no injustice has been done to
the petitioner.

The petitioners were considered by the original

DPC held on 25.2.1988 but the petitioner no. 1 could not make
grade.

10.

As far as the private respondents are concerned they have

neither to caused appearance nor come to contest the writ
petition.

11.

We have considered the judgment delivered by this court in

R.S. Pathania’s case (supra) of which copy has been annexed
by the petitioners along with the writ petition. From the aforesaid
Judgment, we find that while the court has not taken note of the
revised

circular

WP (C) No. 2178/1996

dated

29.10.1987

despite

contentions

Page 7 of 12

of

respondents no. 1 and 2 and the circular having been placed
before the Court, we find, that the court considered rule 105 (3A)
in extensio and held that the said Rule being statutory rule was
applicable and was binding on the parties.

The relevant

discussions in this regard appears at internal page 17 of the
judgment which is being reproduced for the sake of reference:“During arguments the promotion on May
6,1988 of respondents 3 to 13 and 15 and
non-consideration of the petitioners for
promotion had been sought to be justified
on the ground that at the relevant time the
petitioners were not even qualified to be
considered for promotion to the post of
Assistant Commandant and in support my
attention was drawn to sub-clause (6) in
sub-rule (3-A) in clause (iii) of sub Rule 105
of the Central Reserve Police Force Rules,
1955 as substituted with effect from April
6, 1985 by Central Reserve Police Force
(2nd Amendment) Rule, 1985 and which
speaks of the requirement of 5 years of
gazette service of certain categories of
officers for being considered for promotion
to the post of Assistant Commandant. The
so substituted sub-clause (6) runs as
under:“(3-A)
the
posts
of
Assistant
Commandants…
shall be filed
(i) …………..
(ii) ……………..
(iii)by promotion:(a) ……
(b)From amongst Company Commanders
or
Quarter Masters or Assistant
Principals Central Training College of the
Central Reserve Police Force who have
completed 5 years gazette service in the
Force”.
It was contended on behalf of the
Respondents that since on May 6, 1988
when Respondents 3 to 13 and 15 were
considered for and promoted to the post of
Assistant Commandant the Petitioners had
not completed 5 years of gazette service
“as Company Commanders”. Therefore,
they were not eligible to be considered for
WP (C) No. 2178/1996

Page 8 of 12

promotion to the said post. It may be
recalled
that
the
petitioners
were
promoted as Company Commanders on
February 20,1984.
Undoubtedly, as on
May 6, 1988 they had not yet completed
five years of services as “Company
Commanders”. Were they, therefore, not
eligible? This is the question and the
answer lies hidden within the words “who
have completed 5 years gazetted service
in the Force.”
The learned counsel for Respondents
1 and 2 submitted that the words “who
have completed 5 years gazetted service
in the Force” are restricted to gazetted
service put in conjointly in all the three
posts referred to or either in one or two of
those posts. In other words, the argument
was that the period of gazetted service
though rendered in the Force would not be
counted if it was on a post other than the
post of Company Commander, Quarter
Masters or Assistant Principal, Central
Training Colleges of the Central Reserve
Police Force.
I feel no hesitation in
rejecting it. The rule does not say so either
directly or by implication.
It is wide
enough and lays down only to restrictions.
First, completion of 5 years gazetted
service and secondly completion of such
service “in the Force‟, which are wide
enough to include all gazetted posts in the
Indo-Tibetan Border Police, would have
given place to some other words, like “on
those or either of those posts”.
It may be recalled that the
petitioners were directly recruited to the
post of Assistant Company Commanders
on June 12, 1980. Those were admittedly
gazetted posts and “in the Force‟ too.
Thus, on May 6, 1988 when Respondents 3
to 15 were considered for promotion, the
petitioners had already put in nearly 8
years of gazetted service in the Force.
Their claim for being considered for
promotion to the post of Assistant
Commandant could not thus be ignored.
What should then be done?
Since the Petitioners had rendered
qualifying period of gazetted service in the
Force, they ought to have been considered
for promotion to the post of Assistant
WP (C) No. 2178/1996

Page 9 of 12

Commandant.
As this was not done,
Respondents 1 and 2 are directed to
consider them for promotion on their
record as on the date when they ought to
have been considered and is selected their
position will be adjusted in the seniority
list.
No order is made as to costs”.
12.

We may observe that when there was a rule in existence in

the statute book i.e. Rule 105 (supra), the administrative
instructions issued by the Government of India could not
supersede the rule unless the instructions were incorporated in
the Rules.

Nothing has been pointed out that there was any

vacuum which was sought to be filled up by administrative
instructions.

In this regard, we may also refer to another

judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of T.N.
Housing Board v. N. Balasubramanium,, (2004) 6 SCC 85 wherein
it has been held:
“Once the eligibility criteria are considered
to be a prerequisite for giving effect to the
statutory
Regulations, the
purported
executive instructions would not be
applicable. Once it is held that relying on
the basis of the executive instructions in
terms of Regulation 28 (a), the Draftsmen
who have been getting higher salary are
given preference over the diploma-holder
Junior Engineers, the eligibility criteria
contained in the statutory Regulations
would become otiose. Such a consequence
would lead to an absurdity. Therefore, it is
held that the executive instructions cannot
be given effect to”.
13.

Now coming to the second point i.e. benefit of Rule 105 not

being granted to the petitioners by promoting them w.e.f.
21.11.1979 it would suffice to observe that the petitioners having
not come to the court earlier against the report of the DPC at the
relevant time despite existence of rule of 105, now cannot take
WP (C) No. 2178/1996

Page 10 of 12

benefit thereof merely because of a judgment delivered in the
case of R.S. Pathania’s case (supra). If the petitioners were
aggrieved that they ought to have been considered by Rule 105
they should have approached the court at proper time without
delayed laches.

14.

However,

petitioners

we

could

find

not

have

in

been

the

contention

shown

junior

that
to

the

private

respondents who were considered for promotion on the strength
of order passed in R.S. Pathania’s case (supra) which writ
petition itself was filed in 1989 by which time both the petitioners
had already been promoted as Asstt. Commandant (re-designated
as Deputy Commandant). They were neither a party to the writ
petition filed by the Pathania & Ors. not were juniors of the
petitioners who ought to have been affected by the review DPC
which was held for granting promotion to the private respondent
on the strength of the judgment delivered in the R.S.Pathania’s
case (supra).

We also do not find any direction in the order

passed by this Court in R.S. Pathania’s case (supra) whereby
the respondents no. 1 and 2 were authorized to make the
petitioners who were not even a party to the writ petition junior to
the private respondents.

15. Thus, to that extent, the petitioners succeed and accordingly
Writ of Certiorari is issued thereby quashing the seniority list
circulated by the respondents 1 and 2 dated 29.2.1986 with a
further direction to prepare a fresh seniority list by showing the
position of Petitioners no. 1 and 2 over and above private
WP (C) No. 2178/1996

Page 11 of 12

respondents. It is trite to say that the petitioners would become
entitled to all consequential benefits qua private respondents.
With these observations, Writ Petition is disposed of by
leaving the parties to bear their own cost and accordingly, all the
interim application have become infructuous and are disposed of.
