ORDER
17.12.2007
We have perused the Orders of the Chief of Army Staff
dated 7.9.2007, relevant paragraphs of which read thus:4. I have perused the Statutory Complaint and
examined

the

same

against

his

overall

profile,

comments of intermediary authorities, existing rules
and regulations and other relevant documents.

After

consideration of all aspects of the complaint and
viewing it against the redress sought, it emerges that
the plea for setting aside of discharge from service on
grounds

of

'Service

no

longer

required

being

undesirable soldier', is not justified. The individual was
a habitual offender and even after being provided

ample opportunity to improve himself, he did not show
any improvement and continued to indulge in acts of
indiscipline. His further retention

in service would

have been detrimental to
organizational interest. Having earned six red ink
entries, the individual was discharged from service
under the provisions of Army Rule 13 (3) Item III (v)
read in conjunction with Integrated HQ of Ministry of
Defence (Army) letter No A/13210/159/AG/PS-2(c) dt
28 Dec 1988, wherein JCOs/OR having four or more
red ink entries can be discharged from service on
grounds of being undesirable/inefficient. No injustice
has been done to him.
5. I, therefore, direct that the complaint be rejected.

The contention raised by learned counsel for the Petitioner
is that a Court Martial must necessarily precede action under
Rule 13(3)(iii)(v) of the Army Rules, 1954. Reliance is placed on
Rules 180 and 22 of the Army Rules, 1950. In our view that
would apply where the decision is predicated only on a charge
which is the reason for the discharge. In the present case there
are already six red ink entries and three black ink entries. A
Show Cause Notice was issued in March 2004 to the petitioner
itemising all these punishments. In response thereto the
Petitioner had submitted a Representation dated April, 2004 in
which he had only pleaded that the threatened action would

lead to financial ruin of his family. Therefore, there is no room
to contend that the administrative decision to discharge the
Petitioner was perverse, unreasonable or not supported by
sufficient material.
To contend that action under Rule 13(3)(iii)(v), which is
essentially

an

administrative

action,

should

also

be

in

consonance with Rules 180 and 22 would render this provision
totally nugatory.

Rules 180 and 22 relate to Courts-Martial.

Keeping the dismal record of the Petitioner in mind we find no
reason to exercise the extraordinary powers vested in us by
virtue of Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
Dismissed.
