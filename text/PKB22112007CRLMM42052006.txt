JUDGMENT

P.K.BHASIN, J:

The petitioner in all these four petitions is one Ajay Kumar Jain. He has invoked the
jurisdiction of this Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 for quashing of four FIRs registered against him for the offences under
Sections 420/406 of Indian Penal Code (‘I.P.C.’ in short), registered at Police
Station Mukherjee Nagar on 14.03.2002 at the instance of the respondent no. 2complainant, M/s Ashok Leyland Finance Ltd. Since these petitions were filed after
the dispute between the petitioner and the respondent no. 2 complainant had
been compromised and were taken up together for hearing, I shall dispose them of
by this common judgment.

2.

The relevant facts necessary for the disposal of these petitions are that the

respondent no. 2, a Company carrying on the business of financing Motor Vehicles,
filed four separate complaints under Sections 200/202 of Cr.P.C. in the Court of
Metropolitan Magistrate for the offences under Sections 406/420 of I.P.C. The
learned Metropolitan Magistrate in exercise of its powers conferred upon it under

Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. vide its order dated 08.03.2002 directed the police to
register FIR and investigate the matter. Pursuant thereto four separate FIRs were
registered by the police but till date no charge sheet appears to have been filed in
the Court.

3.

As per the averments in these petitions the complainant (respondent no. 2

herein) had entered into four hire purchase agreements with the petitioner in
respect of some vehicles. Since the petitioner could not pay the monthly
installments regularly as agreed between the parties for the loan amount
sanctioned by the complainant Company the complainant filed four criminal
complaints under Sections 420/206 I.P.C. in Court and pursuant to the order of the
Magistrate four FIRs were registered.

4.

As per the petitioner he had arrived at an amicable settlement with the

complainant and the payment due to the complainant with respect to the loan
transactions has been made as per the settlement. After clearing the dues of the
complaint-company the petitioner preferred the present petitions for quashing of
the FIRs in view of settlement arrived with the complainant and clearance of the
loan amount. The petitioner in support of this petition placed reliance upon one
judgment of the Apex Court in “B.S. Joshi & Ors. v. State of Haryana” 2003 (3) SC

189, and one judgment of this Court in “Gurcharan Singh v. State & Anr.” 1998
Cri.L.J. 3780.

5.

Notice of this petition was given to the State as well as respondent no. 2-

complainant. On 27.09.2007 Mr. Jatan Singh, advocate, appeared for respondent
no. 2 and affirmed that the dispute had been amicably resolved and so the
complainant was no more interested in pursuing the complaints based on which
the police had registered four FIRs against the petitioner and he supported the
prayer of the petitioner for quashing of all the four FIRs.

6.

Learned APP for the State, however, opposed quashing of the FIRs on the

ground that offence under Section 406 of I.P.C. is not compoundable under Section
320 Cr.P.C. and so if this offence is permitted to be compounded that would
amount to bye-passing the provisions of section 320 Cr.P.C. which should not be
done by this Court by exercising the inherent jurisdiction vested in it under Section
482 Cr.P.C.

7.

It is now well settled by many judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court that

FIRs even in respect of those offences which are not compoundable under section
320 Cr.P.C. can be quashed as also the criminal proceedings emanating therefrom

if it is felt while dealing with a quashing petition under section 482 Cr.P.C. that it
would secure the ends of justice if the FIR and criminal proceedings arising
therefrom are quashed and continuation of the criminal proceedings would
amount to abuse of the process of law. The judgment in B.S. Joshi’s case (supra),
relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner is one of such judgments
wherein it has been so held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. It is significant to note
that one of the offences in that case was also under section 406 I.P.C. but still the
criminal proceedings were quashed because of the compromise between the
complainant side and the accused persons. In the present case, the FIR against the
accused came to be registered primarily because of his failure to repay the loan
amount which the complainant had disbursed for purchase of certain vehicles and
in respect of which transactions hire purchase agreements were executed between
the complainant Company and the borrower. Since the complainant has received
back the loan amount from the accused it would secure the ends of justice if the
FIRs registered against the petitioner are quashed. Under almost similar
circumstances, a learned Single Judge of this Court has in a recent case decided on
30.11.2006 reported as 137(2007) DLT 583 “G. Udayan Dravid & Ors. V. State &
Ors.” had quashed the FIR under Sections 406/420/120B I.P.C. relying upon the
settlement arrived at between the complainant bank and the borrower to whom
money had been advanced for purchase of some vehicles. It was observed in that
judgment that since no public money was involved in the transaction between the

parties and the parties had compromised the matter the FIR deserved to be
quashed. In an earlier decision also of a Single Judge Bench of this Court reported
as 2006 (1) JCC 371 “D.C. Singham v. State & Anr.” FIR under Sections 420/406
I.P.C. as well as the criminal proceedings emanating therefrom had been quashed
because of the compromise arrived at between the complainant and the accused
of that case.

8.

In view of the foregoing, I allow these petitions and consequently FIR nos.

117/2002, 118/2002, 120/2002 and 122/2002 under Sections 420/406 I.P.C.
registered at Mukherjee Nagar Police Station on 14.03.2002 stand quashed.
