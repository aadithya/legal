1.

By way of this appeal the appellant has claimed

enhancement

in

compensation

over

and

above

the

compensation as awarded by the learned Tribunal in the
impugned Award dated 17.2.2004. The detailed facts of the case
need not be elaborated as it is admitted case that a fatal accident
involving death of the son of the appellant had occurred due to
the rash and negligent driving on the part of the DTC bus
bearing registration No. DEP 9353 and a Mini bus bearing
registration No. DBP â€“ 1395 on 21.1.1991.
2.

The appellant is primarily aggrieved with the meager

amount of compensation awarded in her favour by the Tribunal.
Mr.S. Shahi, counsel for the appellant contended that the
deceased was at his prime age of 26 years and ignoring the
applicable multiplier as laid in schedule II of the Motor Vehicles
Act the Tribunal has taken into consideration the multiplier of 8
for calculating the compensation. The counsel further contended
that the appellant has also been deprived of the interest from the
MAC APP. No. 231/2004

page 2 of 11

date of the filing of the petition i.e. December, 1991. The interest
has merely been granted with effect from 6.1.2001. Counsel for
the appellant also contended that no compensation towards the
future prospects of the deceased has been granted by the
Tribunal and no compensation for the loss of love and affection
has been granted and even no funeral expenses have been
granted by the Tribunal. The contention of the appellant is that
in a most prefidious and pedantic manner the Tribunal has
awarded a meager sum of Rs. 63,000/- towards the
compensation for the death of a young man of 26 years. Counsel
for the appellant further contended that the Tribunal has
wrongly concluded that there was no proof of age of the
appellant despite filing of the election card by the appellant
before the Tribunal. The contention of the counsel for the
appellant is that the age of the appellant at the time of the filing
of the petition was about 40 years and at the time of deposition
it was 49 years. The counsel further contended that the
appellant has also illegally been deprived of the interest from the
MAC APP. No. 231/2004

page 3 of 11

date of filing the petition by misconstruing the order dated
6.9.2001 passed by the High Court, which in no way stated that
the appellant will not be paid interest from the filing of the
petition. The counsel also urged that even the rate of interest is
quite on the lower side.
Per contra Mr.Ataul Haque, counsel appearing for the
respondent contended that

the amount of compensation

awarded by the Tribunal is just and proper keeping in view the
facts and circumstances of the case. The counsel for the
respondent has relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in
Sarla Dixit Vs. Balwant Yadav 1991 ACJ 581 (SC) to
refute the argument of the counsel for the appellant that the
Tribunal should have taken into consideration the future
prospects of the deceased to determine the loss of the income.
Counsel for the

respondent has also contended that the

Tribunal has correctly applied the multiplier of 8 after taking
into consideration the age of the appellant as 38 years on the
date of the accident. Counsel has further contended that the age
MAC APP. No. 231/2004

page 4 of 11

of the appellant on the date of the accident could not have been
40 years as the age of the deceased as per own case of the
appellant was 26 years as on the date of the accident. Counsel
also contended that the appellant herself had disclosed the age
of the pre-deceased father of the deceased as 80 years, who died
much prior to the date of the accident, which occurred in the
year 1981.
Counsel has placed reliance on the following
judgments in support of his contentions:
1)

Rani & Ors. Vs. Sahabuddin

& Ors.-

2006 ACJ 837 (Del)
2)

Chunni Lal & Anr. Vs. Satpal & Ors.-

2005 ACJ 1721 (Del)
3)

Lalita Devi & Ors. Vs. Mewa Singh &

Ors.- 2006 ACJ 941 (Del)
4)

Mathura Dutt & Ors. Vs. DTC & Anr.-

2006 ACJ 1129 (Del)
I have heard counsel for the parties and have also
MAC APP. No. 231/2004

page 5 of 11

perused the records.
The income of the deceased has been determined
after making reference to the Minimum Wages Act, as the
appellant failed to prove on record the exact income of the
deceased. This Court has also taken a consistent view that the
increase in the minimum wages under the Minimum Wages Act
cannot be treated at par or akin to the future prospects as the
increase in the minimum wages is made by the Government
from time to time after taking into consideration the inflationary
trends and denunciation of currency value and other economic
factors. The appellant is thus entitled to claim the benefit of the
said increase as per the Minimum Wages Act. As the income of
the deceased @ Rs.990/- has been determined under the
Minimum Wages Act for the year 1991, therefore, the appellant
would be entitled to the benefit of increase under the Minimum
Wages Act.
As regards the contention as far as the multiplier is
concerned, the appellant in her deposition, which was made in
MAC APP. No. 231/2004

page 6 of 11

the year 2002 had stated

her age to be of 50 years.

The

Tribunal has disbelieved the said age due to the fact that the
husband of the appellant and father of the deceased had died at
the age of 80 years much prior to the date of the said accident as
the death certificate of the father of the deceased which is placed
on record by the appellant shows that he died in the year 1980.
The election identity card filed by the appellant shows

the

appellant's age as 42 years in the year 1995 which means the
appellant correctly disclosed her age as 49 years on the date of
deposition in the year 2002. The appellant has stated that in
her deposition the date of death of the father of the deceased
was wrongly mentioned due to some typographical error. If the
age of the appellant at 49 years in the year 2002 is accepted as
correct, then

it would be difficult to accept the age of the

deceased on the date of the accident i.e., in January 1991 as 26
years. It is thus apparent that the appellant has failed to prove
her correct age and due to which the Tribunal has disbelieved
the testimony of the appellant. It appears that either the age of
MAC APP. No. 231/2004

page 7 of 11

the deceased as disclosed by the appellant is incorrect or the age
of the appellant has not been correctly disclosed. In any case of
the matter, the multiplier of 8 appears to be quite on the lower
side. Considering the facts of the present case the appropriate
multiplier would be 11 as applicable to the age group between
50 to 55 years as per the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles
Act.
Dealing with the argument of the counsel for the
appellant regarding denial of interest with effect from the date of
filing of the petition till realisation, I am of the view that the
Tribunal has wrongly deprived the appellant from the benefit of
the interest from the said period. With regard to the Reference
to the order dated 6.9.2001 passed by this Court in CM.(M) No.
304/2001, it is manifest that the Court has merely stated that
the respondent could be best compensated by not awarding the
interest in favour of the appellant from the date of dismissal of
the case till the date of the said order.

The compensation

petition filed by the appellant was dismissed in default
MAC APP. No. 231/2004

in

page 8 of 11

17.12.98 and the same was restored by the High Court vide
order dated 6.9.2001, therefore, at the most the Tribunal could
have taken the said period from the date of dismissal till its
restoration into account for denying the benefit of interest and
not for the period with effect from filing of the petition till the
date of the award. Accordingly, the appellant is held entitled to
claim interest @7.5% per annum with effect from the date of
filing of the petition till 17.12.98 and then from 6.9.2001 till the
date of award i.e., 17.2.2004. As regards the interest payable
from the date of the said award till realisation, the appellant
shall be entitled to interest @ 9% per annum.
Perusal of the award shows that the Tribunal has not
allowed any compensation
therefore,

towards the funeral expenses,

I allow a sum of Rs.5,000/- towards the funeral

expenses in favour of the appellant and against the respondent
Nos. 1 to 3.

The appellant is also entitled to

a sum

of

Rs.10,000/- towards the loss of love and affection due to the
death of her only child.
MAC APP. No. 231/2004

page 9 of 11

In the light of the aforesaid discussion, the
compensation for the loss of future income shall be determined
by taking the mean of minimum wages in the year 1991 of a semi
skilled worker i.e., Rs.891/- with the wages of the year 2002 i.e.
Rs.2758/-, i.e., 11 years

period of multiplier. The appellant

thus shall be entitled to a sum of Rs.14,596/- towards loss of
income towards dependency. As already held the multiplier of 11
is appropriate keeping in view the facts of the present case and
not the multiplier of 8 as has been determined by the Tribunal.
Therefore, the compensation shall come out as Rs.1,60,556/-.
The appellant shall be further held

entitled to a sum of

Rs.10,000/- towards loss of love and affection and Rs.5,000/for funeral expenses. The appellant shall be entitled to interest
on the said amount w.e.f. 17.12.98 @7.5% and then from
6.9.2001 the appellant shall be held entitled to claim interest
@9% from the date of the award till its realisation or final
payment.
With these directions the matter is remanded back to
MAC APP. No. 231/2004

page 10 of 11

the Tribunal to carry out the aforesaid directions and modify the
award accordingly.
