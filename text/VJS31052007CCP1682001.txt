JUDGMENT
: VIKRAMAJIT SEN, J
CCP No.168/2001
1.

This Contempt Petition, filed by Jamia Millia Islamia

(JMI), has been pending since 20.4.2001. The allegation is that
Mohd. Haroon Chaudhary, resident of B-46, Ghaffar Manzil-1,
Jamia Nagar, New Delhi-110 025 should be punished for
committing contempt of the Orders passed by this Court on
5.9.2000 in CW 5046/2000. It is remarkable that the Contempt
Petition states that the said Order has been annexed as AnnexureP1, whereas the Order that has been filed as Annexure P-1 is
dated 12.12.2000 passed by Vijender Jain, J. Be that as it may, on
5.9.2000, Manmohan Sarin, J. had ordered - “In the meanwhile
status quo as to possession be maintained”.

2.

On 8.1.2004 JMI had filed photographs of the area

which when compared to the photographs filed by them on
17.5.2007, show that construction has indeed been carried out.
Mr. Sawhney, learned Senior Counsel for the JMI, has inter alia
relied on Sections 36 and 37 of the Wakf Act to contend that an
unregistered Wakf Deed has no legal efficacy. He has also taken
us through various other documents, in the nature of complaints

CCP 168/2001 & 1731/2006

Page 2 of 6

written by the alleged contemnors, on 30.4.2000, 4.5.2000,
26.5.2000, 20.6.2000 to the Police Authorities, and a letter dated
26.6.2000 to the Vice-Chancellor of the JMI. All these letters
speak of a Masjid (Mosque), named as Madina Masjid, then
existing in the area.

Mr. Sawhney's contention is that these

communications have been engineered in anticipation of the
acquisition Notifications which eventually came to be published
on 13.7.2000.

3.

On behalf of the alleged contemnors, Mr. Sethi,

learned Senior Counsel, has submitted that Khasra Nos.35
admeasures 7 Bigha, 12 Biswa corresponding to 7600 square
yards approximately. It is his submission that a challenge has
been laid to the acquisition of only 2250 square yards out of this
Khasra No. in CW 5046/2000. It is his contention that the said
Writ Petition 5046/2000 did not relate to or concern the land on
which the Masjid has been existing; neither the Wakf established
by Deed dated 28.1.1992 mentioned above nor the Mutawalli
have challenged the acquisition of the land. In contempt
proceedings we need not enter upon the controversy of whether
the Wakf has been properly constituted under the Wakf Act. Mr.
Sethi's contention is that since the Wakf or the Mutawalli or the

CCP 168/2001 & 1731/2006

Page 3 of 6

Managing Committee had not approached the Court in CW
5046/2000, the direction to maintain status quo did not enure to
their benefits and, therefore, was not applicable to the alleged
contemnors. It is explained that even the Order dated 12.12.2000,
passed by Vijender Jain, J., therefore, has no bearing to the
alleged contemnors. Mr. Sethi has also contended that an Award
has not been announced till date and the acquisition proceedings
remain inchoate. JMI is, therefore, only a prospective beneficiary
and

cannot

espouse

the

grievance

of

the

appropriate

Government, which has till date not taken possession of the land
sought to be acquired.

4.

We are in agreement with the contention of Mr. Sethi

that as on date JMI has no locus standi to complain of a
violation of any orders passed by this Court. Secondly, it is not
clear whether the Wakf or the Managing Committee of the
Madina Masjid had approached this Court in CW 5046/2000. If
only a portion of Khasra No.35 has been acquired, it would not be
established whether the land on which the Mosque exists is
covered by those acquisition proceedings. Thirdly, we are unable
to disregard the communications and correspondence emanating

CCP 168/2001 & 1731/2006

Page 4 of 6

from the alleged contemnors prior to both the Notifications under
Section 4 as well as the filing of CW 5046/2000.

5.

In these circumstances the Notices issued to alleged

contemnor, Mohd. Haroon Chaudhary are recalled.

Contempt

Petition No.168 of 2001 is dismissed.

6.

Nothing said herein will tantamount to expression of

opinion on the merits of the main case.

CCP No.1731/2006
7.

This contempt petition must also, in our considered

view, meet the same fate. The complainant appears to be one out
of many others who is in possession of a parcel of land in Khasra
Nos. 34, 35 and 46. An Award being No. 95/83-84 dated
28.2.1984 in respect of five Khasras which, in addition to the
above also include Khasra Nos. 36 and 37.

Possession of the

portions of the land appears to have been taken over and handed
over to the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) on 14.5.1999.

The writ

petition itself states that the acquisition proceedings have
reached the stage of Sections 7 and 8 of the Land Acquisition Act.
Eviction orders have been passed under the Public Premises

CCP 168/2001 & 1731/2006

Page 5 of 6

(Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act in respect of four
structures that were in Khasra Nos. 36 and 37 with which W.P.
(C) 5046 of 2000 titled Mohd. Haroon Chaudhary -vs- Union of
India is not concerned. Therefore, prima facie, there is no
possibility that demolition of structures complained of in these
proceedings were within the contemplation of the Court when the
Orders dated 5.9.2000 and 12.12.2000 came to be passed.
Mr.Bahar U Barqi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of
Complainant has sought to save the Petitioner by contending that
no demarcation had been carried out even in respect of the said
Khasra Number. If this is so the entire situation becomes
nebulous and uncertain that entertaining contempt proceedings
would not be appropriate. For these reasons notice issued to the
alleged contemnors are recalled. The contempt petition No. 1731
of 2006 is dismissed.

8.

Nothing said herein will tantamount to expression of

opinion on the merits of the main case.
