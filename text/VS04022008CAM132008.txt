the

Alternate Chairperson for the meeting of the equity shareholders of
the Transferor company No.1. The quorum for the said meeting of
the equity shareholders will be 25 equity shareholders.

The

Chairperson and the Alternate Chairperson will ensure that the
notices convening the meeting of equity shareholders of the

equity shareholders of the Transferor company No.1 by recorded post
at their registered or last known addresses at least 21 days before
the date appointed for meeting, in their presence or in the presence
of their authorized representatives. Considering the facts and
circumstances, and keeping in view the submission of the applicant
the sending of individual notices to the equity shareholder holding
upto 100 shares is dispensed with, as they represent only 3.4% of the
total shareholding of such equity shareholders. However, all equity
shareholders will be entitled to attend the meeting of the equity
shareholders to consider and if thought fit to approve the scheme of
arrangement and amalgamation. Notice convening the aforesaid
meeting should state that the copies of the proposed scheme of
arrangement and amalgamation and the statement under Section
393 of the Companies Act, 1956 can be obtained free of charge from
the registered office of the Transferor company. The same shall be
published in newspapers 'The Statesman' & 'Indian Express' (English

appointed for the meeting.

14.

The applicant/Transferor company no. 1 has 10,790

unsecured creditors in all. The applicant has sought the holding of the
meeting of its unsecured creditors for considering and if thought fit
approving the scheme. Considering the facts and circumstances, the
meeting of the unsecured shareholders of the Transferor company
No.1, Usha International Limited, be held on 26.03.2008 at 1:15 p.m.
at the venue â€œShriram Bhartiya Kala Kendra, 1, Copernicus Marg, New
Delhi-110001.

I appoint Mr. Amrit Pal Singh, Advocate Mobile

No.9810082347, as the Chairperson and Ms. Girija Krishna, Advocate
Mobile No.9313338142, as the Alternate Chairperson for the meeting
of the unsecured creditors of the Transferor company No.1.

The

quorum for the said meeting will be 100 unsecured creditors.

The

Chairperson and the Alternate Chairperson will ensure that the
notices convening the meeting of unsecured creditors of the applicant
company No.1 along with copies of scheme and statement under
Section 393 of the Companies Act, 1956, shall be sent to the
unsecured creditors of the Transferor company by UPC at their
registered or last known addresses at least 21 days before the date
appointed for meeting, in their presence or in the presence of their
authorized representatives. The counsel for the applicant has
submitted that the sending of individual notices to the unsecured
creditors whose credit is upto Rs. 25,000/- be dispensed with, as they
represent less than 12.1% of the total amount due. Considering the
COMPANY APPLICATION (MAIN) No. 13 of 2008

Page 8 of 11

facts and circumstances, I am of the view that all the unsecured
creditors should be sent the notices of the proposed meeting to
consider the scheme. However, in respect of the unsecured creditors
of the value upto Rs.25,000/-, the detailed scheme and explanatory
statement need not accompany the notice. The notice should,
however,

state

that

the

copies

of

the

proposed

scheme

of

arrangement and amalgamation and the statement under Section
393 of the Companies Act, 1956 can be obtained free of charge from
the registered office of the applicant company. The notice shall also
be published in newspapers 'The Statesman' & 'Indian Express'
(English edition) and 'Navbharat Times' (Hindi edition) in terms of the
Companies (Court) Rules, 1959, at least 21 days before the day
appointed for the meeting.

15.

The Transferor company no. 1 has 2 secured creditors.

Both the secured of the applicant company No.1 have given their
consent in writing to the scheme of amalgamation, which have been
filed on record. Since the consents to the scheme of amalgamation
have been filed on behalf of the respective secured creditors of the
applicant company No.1, therefore, it is just and appropriate to
dispense with convening the meeting of the secured creditor of the
applicant company No.1 to consider the scheme of amalgamation.
However, the above direction is subject to the consent/no-objection
being filed once again at the stage of second motion by both the
secured creditors.

the applicant company No.1 at least forty eight hours before the

Alternate Chairpersons shall be Rs.25,000/- in addition to meeting
their incidental expenses. The Chairpersons appointed by this Court
shall file their respective reports within two weeks from the date of
holding of the respective meetings. The Alternate Chairpersons shall

Applicant Transferor company so that meetings of the shareholders
and the unsecured creditors are conducted in a just, free and fair
manner.

19.

of the Transferee company by 10 times, it is directed that all the
aforesaid notices shall specifically state the said aspect of the

post amalgamation.

The application is allowed in terms of the above order.
