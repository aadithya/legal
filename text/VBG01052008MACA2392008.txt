V.B.Gupta, J.
The present appeal has been filed by the appellants
against the impugned judgment dated 18.09.07 passed by
Sh. A.S. Jayachandra, Judge, Motor Accident Claims
Tribunal

(for

short

as

“Tribunal”),

KKD,

Delhi

for

enhancement of the compensation amount.
2.

In a nutshell, the facts relevant for the purpose of

dealing with this appeal are as follows:
3.

On 20.11.05, the deceased Sh. Kamal kishore along

with his younger brother Chander Mohan were travelling
MAC APP.NO.239/2008

Page 2 of 9

on motor-cycle from Delhi to Sector-55, Faridabad and
when at about 12.55 p.m. reached Canara bank, Town no.1,
Faridabad, then a truck bearing no. HR-38G-3162, driven
by Respondent no.1 came from behind at a very high speed
driven

rashly

and

negligently

and

hit

against

the

motorcycle of the deceased. Deceased Kamal Kishore died
due to the fatal injuries and Chander Mohan received
serious injuries.
4.

The Tribunal vide impugned judgment, awarded

compensation of Rs.3,38,000/- including Rs.30,000/- for the
funeral expenses, transportation of body and loss to the
estate by applying a multiplier of 11, along with interest @
7.5% per annum.
5.

Not satisfied with the award, the present appeal has

been filed by the parents of the deceased, seeking
enhancement of the compensation.
6.

It has been contended by Learned Counsel for the

appellants that the Tribunal erred in assessing the income

MAC APP.NO.239/2008

Page 3 of 9

of the deceased on the basis of Minimum Wages @ Rs.3,
500/- per month whereas, the deceased was actually
earning Rs.5,900/- p.m. The Tribunal has failed to consider
that Minimum Wages are being revised twice in a year; as
such the deceased would have earned much more in near
future. No compensation for loss of love and affection and
pain and suffering and mental torture on account of sudden
and premature death of the deceased were awarded. The
Tribunal erred in paying the interest @ 7.5% only on the
awarded amount. It ought to have awarded the interest @
18% p.a. on the awarded amount from the date of the
petition till realization.
7.

Ld. Counsel also cited Daya Arora & Ors. v. Kapur

Singh & Anr., IV (2005) ACC 313 and United India
Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Budhi Ram & Ors., I (2008) ACC
533 in support of its contentions.
8.

Thus,

the

determination

MAC APP.NO.239/2008

in

principal
this

question

appeal

is

that

that

arises

for

“Whether

the

Page 4 of 9

compensation awarded by the learned Tribunal is just and
fair or not?”
9.

It was well established before the Tribunal by the

testimony of PW-2, Chander Mohan and affidavit Ex.P-1
given by Raj Kumar, father of the deceased that deceased
Kamal Kishore died on 20.11.05 in accident due to rash and
negligent driving of the vehicle no. HR38-G-3162. Further
the respondents have not led in any evidence to show
anything to discredit the negligence attributed. Therefore,
the aspect of involvement of the vehicle of the respondents
was clearly made out.
10.

In arriving at the compensation aforesaid, the learned

Tribunal has taken into account the age of the mother and
father of the deceased at 50 and 52 years respectively. The
deceased was 21 years and he was having good health and
privately employed as a salesman with Royal Verma
Jewellers (P.) Ltd.

The appellants had not produced any

document to show the age and income of the deceased

MAC APP.NO.239/2008

Page 5 of 9

except the Driving Licence and the certificate Ex.PW 1/2
issued by the employer of the deceased
11.

Ex.

PW1/2

does

not

disclose

the

registration

particulars under various statutes with record to the
establishment of the employer. Moreover, the employer of
M/s Royal Verma Jewellers (P) Ltd. where the deceased
was employed, has not been examined to prove as to what
monthly salary was being paid to the deceased. Admittedly,
the primary and best evidence with regard to the income of
deceased has not been produced.
12.

Thus, in the absence of any other evidence, the Ld.

Tribunal had taken the help of Minimum Wages Act to
assess the monthly income of the deceased, which is the
right approach adopted by it.

Thus I do not find any

infirmity on the findings of the Tribunal on this issue.
13.

Further, I do not find any force in the contention of

the learned Counsel for the appellants that the Tribunal
has not taken into consideration the future increase in the
MAC APP.NO.239/2008

Page 6 of 9

income of the deceased. Regarding the future prospects,
the same cannot be granted unless there is evidence to this
effect on record. There is no evidence on record to prove
that the deceased was in a trade where he would have
earned more from time to time or he had special merit or
qualification or opportunities which would have led to an
improvement in his income. Therefore, in view of Bijoy

Kumar Duggar v. Bidagar Dutta AIR 2006 SC 1255, the
contention regarding the future prospects is rejected.
14.

Another contention raised by the learned counsel for

appellants is that no compensation on account of loss of
love and affection and on account of pain & suffering and
mental torture has been awarded by the Ld. Tribunal. In
support of its contention, reliance has been placed upon
Daya Arora & Ors. (supra) by the appellants.
15.

In the grounds of appeal, it has been alleged that the

Tribunal ought to have paid one Lac rupees for loss of love
& affection, as the appellants are young widow and minor

MAC APP.NO.239/2008

Page 7 of 9

children who lost their sole bread earner.
16.

This plea in the ground of appeal taken was nobody in

case, before the Tribunal, because the deceased in the
present case was unmarried and the appellants are his
parents and as such question of awarding Rs.1,00,000/- for
loss of love & affection to young widow and minor children
does not arise and the case law cited by the Ld. Counsel for
the Appellants on this point is not at all applicable to the
facts of the present case.
17.

As regards the award of interest @ 7.5% per annum

by the Tribunal, in Abati Bezbaruah v. Deputy Director

General, Geological Survey of India,

(2003) 3 SCC

148, the Apex Court has observed as under;
“The question as to what should be rate of interest,
in the opinion of this Court, would depend upon the
facts and circumstances of each case. Award of
interest would normally depend upon the bank rate
prevailing at the relevant time.”
18.

In view of the above decision, I am of the opinion that

the award of interest @ 7.5% cannot be considered to be
MAC APP.NO.239/2008

Page 8 of 9

lower side. I do not find any justification for increasing the
same to 18% p.a. I am, therefore, not inclined to interfere
in the discretion exercised by the Tribunal in awarding
interest on the award amount.
19.

Keeping in view all the facts and circumstances

brought on record, I am of the view that the compensation
as awarded by the learned tribunal is just and fair.
Accordingly, no infirmity can be found with the order of
learned Tribunal.
20.

The present appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
