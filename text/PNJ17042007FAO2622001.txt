PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Kamal Kishore, aged 44 years was injured in a road accident

on 28.2.91.
2.

He filed a claim petition under Section 140 and 166 of the

Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 claiming compensation in sum of
Rs.7,00,000/- on account of the injuries suffered by him in the said
road accident. Later, by way of the amendment he enhanced the
claim to Rs.20,00,000/-.

Rs.4,23,701/-

Aggrieved by the compensation awarded by the Tribunal,

injured/appellant

has

filed

the

present

appeal

praying

for

enhancement of compensation.
5.

Since fairness of the compensation assessed is the only

matter which was debated by the learned counsel for the parties, I
need to note only such facts as are relevant for determination of the
said issue.

page 2 of 20

6.

Date of accident is 28.2.91. Age of the appellant as on the

date of the accident is 44 years. He claimed to be selling sarees
from a small shop under the name of Kamal Deep Sarees. He
claimed an income of Rs.5,000/- per month at the time of the
accident.
7.

Period of treatment spreads over different dates, spanning

around 20 months. He was admitted in LNJP Hospital on the date of
the accident and was discharged in the last week of April 91.
Thereafter, he was treated by three doctors, namely, Dr. Shekhar
Aggarwal, Dr. H.U. Nagar and Dr. Mukesh Jain. Appellant claimed to
have undergone six operations.
8.

Details of injuries suffered by the appellant are as follows:
i)
ii)

Compound fracture of left ankle and left foot.

iii)

Closed fracture of right femur and right tibia.

iv)
9.

Crush injury on left thigh and foot.

Lacerated wound on left ankle and joint.

As a result of the said injuries, right leg of the injured was

shortened by one inch and he has suffered a permanent disability of
55%.
10.

Since appellant is aggrieved by the amount of compensation

awarded by the Tribunal under various heads, I shall deal with each
head separately.

page 3 of 20

11.

Before proceeding with the compensation assessed by the

Tribunal under each of the heads, I note that most of the bills,
prescriptions etc are exhibited as PW1. PW1 is Ram Phal, Head
Constable who has proved the copy of FIR. (The testimony of PW1 is
at page 63 of the record of the Tribunal). I fail to understand as to
how the bills, prescriptions etc are exhibited as PW1.
DRESSING CHARGES
12.

Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.7,000/- as against

Rs.20,000/- claimed by the appellant.
13.

Relating to dressing charges, appellant (PW-3) had deposed as

under (page 67):

14.

“A person namely Dr.Narinder and Mohd. Ali used
to come for a period upto the December 1992.
They used to charge Rs.50/- per dressing and I
incurred sum of Rs.20,000/- (twenty thousand).”
Appellant has also placed on record four bills amounting to

Rs.16,000/- issued by Dr. Narinder Nath and Mohd. Ali respectively.
The same are Ex.PW1/C-86 (page no. 735), Ex.PW1/C-88 (page no.
739), Ex.PWI/C-89 (page no. 741) and Ex.PW1/C-91 (page no. 745).
15.

But, testimony of appellant and bills on record cannot be

treated as gospel truth. The correctness of same has to be
determined taking into consideration other evidence and attendant
circumstances.
16.

Bills of medicines purchased by the appellant will give a clue

as to the period of dressing. A perusal of bills show that appellant

clearly establish that the appellant used

to get his wounds dressed from March 91 to June 92. (Appellant has
purchased 1 dozen of bandage in June 92, thus it could reasonably
be expected that he used to get his wounds dressed even after June
92, but I am taking the period of dressing from March 91 to June 92).
18.

Appellant had further deposed that he used to pay Rs.50/- per

day for dressing. This statement of appellant cannot be believed. In
year 1991, minimum wages of unskilled labourer was Rs.845/- per
month, i.e. Rs.28/- per day. Considering that appellant himself
provided antiseptic lotion, cotton and other material used for
dressing, the dressing charges @ Rs.50/- per day claimed by
appellant are exaggerated.

page 6 of 20

6

19.

Noting that the dresser used to come at the residence of the

appellant for dressing, I allow dressing charges @ Rs.35 per day for
a period of 15 months. The same comes to Rs.15,750/-. Thus, I
award a sum of Rs.15,750/- to the appellant under the head
“dressing charges”.
20.

Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.7,000/- under the head

“dressing charges”. Thus, compensation under the head “dressing
charges’ is enhanced by a further sum of Rs.8,750/-.
PHYSIOTHERAPY CHARGES
21.

Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.3,420/- as against

Rs.17,100/- claimed by the appellant.
22.

In relation to physiotherapy exercises, appellant had deposed

as under (page 67):

23.

“ I have to take physiotherapy exercises and I have
been paying Rs100/- per sitting to Saxena. The bills
issued by Dr.Saxena are filed on record.”
Appellant had tried to substantiate his claim by filing two bills

issued by Saxena Prosthetic and Orthotic Clinic totaling Rs.17,100/-.
The same are exhibited as Ex.PW1/C-89 (Page 737) and Ex.PW1/C90 (page 743).
24.

Bills relied upon the appellant merely contains the stamp of

Saxena clinic. The person who has issued the said bills has not
stepped into the witness-box. In fact, the name of the person who

page 7 of 20

7

has issued the afore-noted bills is neither discernible from bills nor
from the testimony of the appellant.
25.

Further, no details pertaining to physiotherapy exercises (for

example, person who used give said exercises, types of exercises
etc) are mentioned in the said bills. No receipt has been filed
evidencing payment pursuant to the bills.
26.

For the above reasons, neither testimony of appellant nor

afore-noted bills clearly establish that appellant has incurred a sum
of Rs17,100/- for physiotherapy exercises. Thus, I do not interfere
with award made by the Tribunal under the head “Physiotherapy
Charges”.
EXPENDITURE INCURRED ON SERVICES OF ATTENDANT
27.

Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.11,102/- as against

Rs.35,095/- claimed by the appellant.
28.

In relation to expenditure incurred on services of attendant,

appellant had deposed as under:
“I have to employ one servant namely Ramu @
Ram
Prasad
during
the
course
of
my
hospitalization. I used to pay Rs.110/- per day to
Ramu. He remained in employment for 53 days.
After discharge from the hospital I had to employ
servants for about 1 ½ days to look after me and
to help me. I was paying Rs.70/- or 75/- per day to
the servant. I had to employ the servant 1 ½
years and incurred Rs.35,000/- (thirty five
thousand) on them.”

page 8 of 20

8

29.

To further substantiate his claim, appellant has filed seven

bills for the period 02.03.91 to 10.4.92 (13 months) totaling to
Rs.35,095/-. Amount claimed ranges between Rs.70/- per day to
Rs.110/- per day. The bills are exhibited as Ex.PW1/C-1 to Ex.PW1/C6 (Page 721 to 731).
30.

Noting the afore-noted bills, Tribunal has believed that

appellant had engaged attendant for a period of 13 months but has
disbelieved that he was paying Rs.70/- to Rs.110/- per day to the
attendant for their services.
31.

Taking minimum wages notified under the Minimum Wages

Act, 1948 as the guiding principle, Tribunal has awarded the
compensation. In the year 1991, minimum wages payable to
unskilled labourer was Rs.854/- per month, thus Tribunal has
awarded a sum of Rs.11,102/- (854X13=11,102) under the said
head.
32.

There is no evidence wherefrom it could be inferred as to for

how many hours in a day appellant required the services of the
attendant.
33.

In absence of clear and cogent evidence, I find no infirmity in

Tribunal’s decision in assessing compensation under this head on
the basis of minimum wages.
34.

I uphold the award of Rs.11,102/- made by the Tribunal under

the head “expenditure incurred on services of attendant”.

A perusal of the above table shows that appellant had only

filed 38 bills and not 51 as claimed by him. Thus, Tribunal has
disallowed four bills.

page 10 of 20

1

38.

Bill at serial no. 2 is a handwritten bill and is signed by one Sh.

D.K. Singhal. Except the said bill, all other bills are issued by the
medical stores. In all the bills except one bill (Amount of bill marked
Ex.PW1/C-43, pg no. 649 is for Rs.6,000/-), the amount of medicines
purchased by the appellant is less than Rs.1,000/-. This fact makes
the bill at serial no. 2 highly exaggerated one. In my opinion,
Tribunal has rightly disallowed the bill at serial no. 2 as the same
does not appear to be a genuine bill.
39.

Bill at serial no. 3 is an incomplete bill and thus rightly

disallowed by the Tribunal.
40.

I agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that bills at

serial nos. 14 and 15 have been wrongly disallowed by the Tribunal.
I allow the said bills and award a sum of Rs.955/- (rounded off to
Rs.1000/-) under the head “Medicinal Expenses”.
EXPENSES INCURRED ON TREATMENT
41.

Tribunal has allowed a sum of Rs.13,792/- as against

Rs.35,795/- claimed by the appellant.

to 8 are handwritten receipts containing

an acknowledgement that a sum of money is paid to Dr.H. U. Nagar.
The said receipts are not signed by Dr. Nagar but by another person
whose signatures cannot be identified.
44.

Tribunal has disallowed the bills at serial nos. 1 to 8 for the

reason said bills/receipts are not certified/proved by the person who
has issued them. I agree with the decision of the Tribunal.
45.

Bill at serial no. 9 is for the expenses incurred by the appellant

on account of his having undergone an operation at Orthonova
Hospital in September 91.
46.

No reasons have been given by the Tribunal for disallowing

the said bill.
47.

The

fact

that

appellant

was

operated

upon

stands

corroborated by the testimony of the Dr. H. U. Nagar and appellant.
48.

Dr. H.U. Nagar stepped into the witness-box as PW-4 and

deposed that he had operated appellant for fusion and curetage of
his infected left ankle in September 91 at Orthonova Hospital.

page 12 of 20

1

49.

Appellant had also testified that he was operated upon by H.U.

Nagar for removal of pus from his left ankle in September 91 at
Orthonova Hospital.
50.

In view of testimony of Dr. H. U. Nagar and appellant, I allow

the bill at serial no. 9.
51.

Bills at serial nos. 10, 11 and 12 are for expenses incurred by

the appellant on account of his having undergone two operations at
Vardhman Trauma Centre in January and September 92.
52.

Bill at serial no. 10 is a prescription by Dr. Mukesh Jain. The

said prescription/ bill merely contains an entry of Rs.10,000/-. The
same does not show that a sum of Rs.10,000/- was paid by the
appellant. Thus, I disallow the bill/prescription at serial no. 10.
53.

In relation to bills at serial no. 11 and 12, Dr. Mukesh Jain

stepped into the witness as PW-4 and deposed that he had twice
operated appellant in January and September 92 respectively at
Vardhman Trauma Centre.
54.

But, the afore-noted bills and testimony of Dr. Mukesh Jain are

not corroborated by the testimony of the appellant.
55.

In his testimony, appellant had testified that he was operated

upon four times. He further deposed that the first two operations
were conducted at LNJP Hospital on 28.2.91 and last week of April
91 respectively. He deposed that third and fourth operations were

page 13 of 20

1

conducted at Batra and Orthonova Hospital in June and September
91 respectively.
56.

The fact that appellant was operated upon twice by Dr.

Mukesh Jain in month of January and September 92 at Vardhman
Trauma Centre does not find a mention in the testimony of
appellant. No explanation is forthcoming as to why appellant has not
mentioned about the said two operations in his testimony.
57.

Noting the testimony of the appellant, I disallow the bills at

serial nos. 11 and 12.
58.

The net effect is that I award a sum of Rs.2,682/- to the

appellant under the head “expenses incurred on treatment”.
CONVEYANCE CHARGES
59.

Tribunal has allowed a sum of Rs.3,400/- as against Rs.

36,247/- claimed by the appellant.
60.

Appellant had stated that he was being treated by Dr. Mukesh

Jain who was practising at Vardhman Trauma Centre, Muzaffar
Nagar, U.P. and thus claimed conveyance charges for traveling from
Delhi to Muzaffar Nagar but the same were disallowed by the
Tribunal on the premise that Delhi has better medical facilities than
Muzaffar Nagar.
61.

In my opinion, Tribunal has wrongly disallowed the same for

the reason testimony of Dr. Mukesh Jain and appellant, prescriptions
issued by Dr. Mukesh Jain and bills of medicines purchased by the

page 14 of 20

1

appellant clearly establish that appellant was being treated by Dr.
Mukesh Jain.
62.

I consider it reasonable to allow a further sum of Rs.2,500/- to

the appellant under the head “conveyance charges”.
LOSS OF INCOME
63.

Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- as against

Rs.2,50,000/- claimed by the appellant.
64.

Appellant

had

deposed

that

his

monthly

income

was

Rs.5,000/- at the time of the accident and he could not attend to his
business for a period of 2 ½ years on account of the injuries suffered
in the accident. Relying on the testimony of the appellant, a sum of
Rs. 1,50,000/- has been awarded by the Tribunal.(5,000X 30 months
= Rs. 1,50,000/-).
65.

It is not clear as on what basis appellant had claimed a sum of

Rs.2,50,000/- under the head “loss of income”. In fact, the award of
the Tribunal is on the higher side as the evidence on record
suggests that appellant was undergoing treatment for a period of 20
months and not 30 months as claimed by the appellant. More so
when income was from a shop and it could be presumed that during
period of treatment somebody was running the shop.
66.

I maintain the award of Rs. 1,50,000/- made by the Tribunal

under the head “loss of income”.
FUTURE LOSS

page 15 of 20

1

67.

Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- under this head.

68.

As per disability certificate (Ex. PW1/D, pg 899) appellant has

suffered a permanent disability of 55%. Tribunal has assessed
functional disability suffered by the appellant as 40% and on this
basis awarded a compensation of Rs.1,50,000/- to the appellant.
69.

Learned counsel for the appellant contends that while

determining compensation under this head Tribunal has not taken
into account the fact that the appellant will have to incur expenses
on his future treatment.
70.

Tribunal has not specified as on what basis it has arrived at a

compensation of Rs.1,50,000/-. It appears taking monthly income of
the appellant at the time of the accident as Rs.5,000/- and applying
multiplier of 6, Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- to the
appellant. (Rs.5,000/-X12X6X40% = Rs.1,44,000/-; rounded off to
Rs.1,50,000/-.)
71.

On the future loss, noting that the appellant was running a

sarees shop, I do not think that any meaningful future loss has
surfaced. The nature of permanent disability, in my opinion, is not of
a kind which would affect the avocation of the appellant. In my
opinion, a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- awarded by the Tribunal is
adequate.
NON- PECUNIARY DAMAGES

page 16 of 20

1

72.

Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.50,000/- under the head

“non-pecuniary damages”. Tribunal has awarded Rs.50,000/- for
pain and suffering. No amount has been awarded towards loss of
amenities of life.
73.

No amount of money can recompense a person the loss of

enjoyment of pleasures of life.
74.

Every disability takes away some pleasure of life or the other.

There cannot be an absolute measure to compensate a non
pecuniary loss. But, some guidance can be had from the extent of
injury and the period of hospitalization coupled with the disability
suffered.
75.

I look at various judicial trends which are as under:
(1) Amar Singh v. Ishwar 1999 ACJ 809, Supreme Court
awarded compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- under the head
'pain, shock and suffering' to an injured who suffered 30%
permanent disability and remained in hospital for a period
of more than 3 years though intermittently on account of
injuries sustained by him in a road accident.
(2) Dr.(Ms.) K.R. Tandon v. Om Prakash and Anr. 1999 ACJ
1299, Supreme Court awarded a compensation of Rs.
1,00,000/- under the head 'non pecuniary loss' to an
injured who sustained injuries of ribs, spine and hip-joint in
a road accident.

page 17 of 20

(3) Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Corporation v. Hansa
Ben Natwarlal Dabgar and Ors. 2003 ACJ 642 due to
accident which took place on 13.9.1991 Hansaben, a cook
sustained a fracture in her right leg. The fracture malunited resulting in shortening of right lower limb and thus
she suffered permanent partial disablement to the extent
of 38%. She was hospitalized for a period of 10 days. The
Division

Bench

of

Gujarat

High

Court

awarded

a
