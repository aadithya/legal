ANIL KUMAR, J. (ORAL)
1.

This is an application by the petitioner seeking modification of order

dated 9th March, 2006 and seeking appointment of some other arbitrator in
place of Mr.Justice (Retd) J.B.Goel to adjudicate the dispute arisen between
the parties.

2.

The applicant contended that by order dated 9th March, 2006 the

petition was allowed under Section 11 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
Arb.P.No.126/2006

Page 1 of 6

1996 and Mr.Justice J.B.Goel (Retd) was appointed as the sole arbitrator to
adjudicate the dispute between the parties. While appointing Mr.Justice
J.B.Goel (Retd) as an arbitrator the parties were directed to appear before
the arbitrator on 29th May, 2006.

3.

The petitioner/applicant contended that when the counsel for the

applicant appeared before the learned arbitrator, fees was quoted by the
learned

arbitrator

to

conduct

the

arbitration

proceedings.

However

considering the commercial viability for the petitioner company, the fees
quoted by the arbitrator could not be agreed to by the petitioner company.
Consequently, the arbitrator did not proceed with the matter and returned the
matter.

4.

The petitioner, therefore, in the facts and circumstances has

contended that the arbitrator has withdrawn from the office for the reason that
the fees quoted by him could not be paid by the petitioner. Consequently, the
mandate of the arbitrator has been terminated under Section 15 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and, therefore, the petitioner has
prayed for the substitution of an arbitrator in place of Mr.Justice J.B.Goel

Arb.P.No.126/2006

Page 2 of 6

(Retd) already appointed as a sole arbitrator pursuant to order dated 9th
March, 2006.

5.

The application has been filed by the petitioner under Section 151 of

the Code of Civil Procedure. The learned counsel for the petitioner has
contended that the application by petitioner is an application under Section
15 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and merely mentioning Section 151
of the Code of Civil Procedure will not disentitle the petitioner for the relief
claimed, as the Court is competent to grant the relief claimed by the petitioner
in the application under Section 15 of Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996.

6.

The respondent/non-applicant was served by substituted service by

publication in 'The Statesman' as the notices sent to the respondent/nonapplicant had received back with different remarks as `premises found
locked’ and that `one person comes there at the address given of the
respondent only to collect the rent’.

7.

The learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on (2004) 12 SCC

278, N.Mani Vs. Sangeetha Theatre & Ors in support of his contention that

Arb.P.No.126/2006

Page 3 of 6

the application filed by the petitioner under Section 151 of the Code of Civil
Procedure be treated as an application under Section 15 of Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 for substitution of the arbitrator appointed pursuant to
order dated 9th March, 2006.

8.

In N.Mani (Supra) it was held by the Supreme Court that reference to a

wrong provision of law by itself does not vitiate the exercise of power so long
as the power exists and can be traced to a source available in law. The
relevant observation of the Apex Court is as under:“It is well settled that if an authority has a power under the law
merely because while exercising that power the source of power
is not specifically referred to or a reference is made to a wrong
provision of law, that by itself does not vitiate the exercise of
power so long as the power does exist and can be traced to a
source available in law.”

9.

Under Section 15(1)(a) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act where the

arbitrator withdraws from the office for any reason, a substitute arbitrator can
be appointed by a Court under Section 15(2) of the said Act.

10.

The arbitrator appointed by order dated 9th March, 2006 has withdrawn

Arb.P.No.126/2006

Page 4 of 6

from the office for the reason that the fees quoted by him were found to be
commercially unviable by the petitioner who was unable to pay the fees and
consequently the arbitrator has withdrawn from the office which fact has not
been denied and there is no reason to disbelieve the petitioner who has
averred about it in his application which application is also supported by the
affidavit of Ms.Shalini Saxena, Assistant Manager (Legal) of the petitioner
company.

11.

Consequently, the inevitable inference in the facts and circumstances

is that the arbitrator appointed by order dated 9th March, 2006 has withdrawn
from the office and, therefore, the mandate of the arbitrator stands terminated
and petitioner is entitled for appointment of a substitute arbitrator.

12.

The petition is, therefore, allowed and consequently, in the facts and

circumstances I appoint Mr.S.M.Chopra, Advocate (Retd, Additional District
Judge), 181, Deshbandhu Apartments, Kalkaji, New Delhi-110029 (Mobile
No.9213230349, Residence No.26484158) as substitute arbitrator. The fees
of the arbitrator shall be Rs.6000/- per hearing subject to a maximum fees of
Rs.60,000/-. The petitioner shall appear before the arbitrator on 8th October,

Arb.P.No.126/2006

2007 at 4.30 PM. A copy of this order be sent to the learned arbitrator. The
petitioner is also directed to give a copy of this order to the arbitrator. Copy to
the counsel for the petitioner, dasti.
