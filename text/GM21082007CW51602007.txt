1.

This writ petition has been filed by the petitioners

contending that they have applied for plots advertised
by the Delhi Development Authority (`DDA' for short)
in the scheme which was titled as the `Rohini
Residential Scheme 1981'. As per the brochure relied
upon

by

the

petitioners,

the

respondent

had

announced this residential scheme in Rohini for
allotment of plots of various sizes ranging from 26
mts. to 90 mtrs. The petitioners alongwith thousands
of other people applied for various sizes of residential

plots ranging from 26 mtrs. to 90 mtrs. as per their
eligibility and entitlement.
2.

This scheme envisaged development of these

plots by the Delhi Development Authority and its
allotment by draw of lots. It is not disputed that the
petitioners were assigned priority numbers as under:Sl.

The petitioners are aggrieved by the action of the

respondent

in

arbitrarily

disposing

of

plots

by

conducting auctions which have inter alia been
advertised on 22nd May, 2000, 24th May, 2000, 25th
May, 2000, 22nd June, 2000 and 23rd to 25th July,
2007.

According to the petitioners this action is

WP (C) No.5160/2007

Page No.2

violative of the rights of the petitioner and is liable to
be

quashed

being

wholly

arbitrary.

The

writ

petitioners contend that the respondents had made a
representation in the brochure that they shall allot
these plots developed by them to the applicants and it
is not open to the Delhi Development Authority to
dispose of the same to non-applicants by public
auction.
4.

The action of the DDA in not alloting the plot is

also assailed as being contrary to the principles of law
on

the

ground

of

delay

in

acting

on

the

representations and promises to allot the land as
contained in the brochure.
5.

Mr. Ajay Verma, learned counsel for the DDA on

advance notice

has placed

before this court a

judgment of the Division Bench of this court rendered
on 3rd September, 2003 in LPA No.978/2002 Smt.
Supla Jain Vs. DDA.

Perusal of this judgment shows

that the petitioner-appellant therein had assailed an
order dated 3rd October, 2002 passed by the learned
Single Judge in Civil Writ Petition No.7471/2000
whereby the writ petition was dismissed. The facts as
WP (C) No.5160/2007

Page No.3

noticed by the court show that the judgment has been
rendered in circumstances which are almost identical
to the facts of the present case.
6.

The appellant before the Division Bench was also

registered in the MIG category with the DDA with
allotment of a plot of land in Rohini Residential
Scheme, 1981. She was constrained to approach this
court on the same grievance as the petitioner and
assailed firstly, the delay in the allotment of the plot
by the DDA and secondly, challenged the action of the
DDA in disposing of the plots by auctions.
7.

I find that after a detailed consideration of the

facts of the case, the court was of the view that the
DDA did not allot a plot to any person who is below
the appellant in the list of registrants. It was noticed
that the brochure itself postulated payment of interest
at the rate of 7% per annum to the applicants on the
amounts which were deposited by them.
8.

The action of the DDA in disposing of land by

auction despite the applications which had been
invited for allotment under the 1981 scheme was also
scrutinised and not faulted.

It is noteworthy that the DDA is conducting such

auction under the provisions of Delhi Development
Act,

1957

thereunder.

and

the

rules

&

regulations

framed

Development of land, construction and

the provision of housing are amongst the several
functions of the authority which the authority has
taken up and is discharging. The judgment dated 3rd
September, 2003 has itself noticed that acquisition of
land and its development work are in progress and are
time consuming. In para 7 of this judgment, the court
has noticed thus:"7. At the time of launching the scheme it was
proposed to allot plots of 90 sq. mtrs./60 mtrs.
to the registrants of MIG and 48 sq. mtrs./32 sq.
mtrs. to the LIG category but as per the decision
taken in the Ministry of Urban Development on
9.7.1999 it was decided that MIG category may
be restricted to 60- sq. mtrs. and 32 sq. mtrs. to
the LIG category. It was also decided to speed
up to liquidate the pendency.
DDA has
prepared an action plan for liquidating 38278
pending registrants of Rohini Residential
plotted Scheme. In this respect it is mentioned
that DDA proposes to make allotment of 6,000
plots (out of which 2,000 would be in MIG
category) by October/November, 2003 in
addition to 4,000 plots already allotted up to 6th
March, 2003. It is also explained that 1478
acres of land has been acquired in 2001-2002
and the development work is in progress.
Moreover, 10,000 acres of land has been
notified for acquisition and every attempt is
WP (C) No.5160/2007

Page No.5

made to clear the backlog."
10. I find that the DDA had placed extensive figures
with regard to the allotments already made.

The

judgment has noticed that a total of 46110 allotments
in the three categories stood made.
11. It also appears that the DDA has prepared an
Action Plan for making allotments to the 38,278/pending registrants of the Rohini Residential Plotted
Scheme.
12. This judgment was rendered on 3rd September,
2003 and the proposal which was then envisaged
refers to allotments to be made in October/November,
2003.

Certainly, the position would have materially

changed since then and the Delhi Development
Authority would have been able to make allotments to
some of the applicants.
13. Mr. Ajay Verma, learned standing counsel for the
DDA has placed the current status of the applicants
before this court.

This status report dated 17th July,

2007 in the Rohini Residential Scheme which is duly
signed by the Deputy Director, LSB, Rohini has been
produced before this court and is taken on record. As

WP (C) No.5160/2007

Page No.6

per this tabulation, which gives the position subsisting
on 7th March, 2007, so far as the applicants in the MIG
category are concerned, there is a backlog of 8177
applicants; under the LIG category, there is a backlog
of 12,785 applicants and under the Janta category, the
backlog is to the tune of 4404 applicants. Thus, as on
7th March, 2007, the DDA has a backlog of a total of
25,366 applicants under three categories alone who
are

still

awaiting

allotments

under

the

Rohini

Residential Scheme, 1981.
14. It has been submitted by the learned counsel for
the DDA that the DDA is effectively taking steps to
acquire further land to complete the allotment process
and to ensure that there is no backlog. Acquisition of
the land and its development requires finances.
Auctions may be necessary for this reason as well.
15. The writ petition does not contain any allegation
of discrimination on the part of the DDA in having
made the allotments.
16. In the afore-noticed circumstances and having
regard to the pronouncement of the Division Bench, it
cannot be held that the action of the DDA is arbitrary
WP (C) No.5160/2007

Page No.7

or illegal.
In this view of the matter, this writ petition and
CM No.9572/2007 are dismissed.
Needless to say, the DDA shall proceed in the
matter of allotment of plots to the petitioners as per
its notified policy and the petitioners shall be allotted
plots as per their priority number.
16. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that
the petitioner has a grievance that the DDA is not
disclosing the complete information with regard to the
properties which have been disposed of on auction
despite the representation made in the brochure. The
petitioner may make an appropriate application to the
competent statutory authority of the DDA giving
specific details of the information which is sought by
the petitioner. The same shall be processed and dealt
with by the DDA in accordance with law.
