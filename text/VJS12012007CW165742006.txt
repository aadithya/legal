JUDGMENT
1.

In these writ petitions the Order disposing of the Objections

filed by KLM Dutch Airlines ('Assessee' for short) to the initiation
of re-assessment proceedings has been challenged; a prayer has
also been made for the issuance of a writ of Certiorari or any like
Order quashing the impugned Notice under Section 148 of the
Income-Tax Act [ for short 'IT Act'] dated 8.3.2006; and for
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 1 of 26

quashing the re-assessment proceedings initiated in pursuance to
the Notice dated 8.3.2006. The assailed Notice pertains to
Assessment Year (AY) 2001-2002 in WP(C) 16576-77 and to AY
2003-2004 in WP(C) No.16574-75. On a perusal of the impugned
Notice it appears that the Assistant Director of Income Tax [for
short Assessing Officer(AO)] intends to 'reassess' the income of
the Petitioner/Assessee inter alia since the word 'assessed' has
been

scored

out.

This

is

noteworthy

since

avowedly

no

assessment has in fact been framed.

2.

The Assessee had filed its Return of Income under Section

139 of the IT Act on 31.10.2002 for AY 2002-03 declaring a 'nil
taxable income' and consequently seeking a refund of tax
deducted/deposited. Exemption under Section 90 of the IT Act
has been claimed in respect of income earned from “technical
handling”. On 19.1.2004 a notice under Section 148 of the IT Act
was issued in respect of AY 2002-2003. In response thereto the
Assessee filed its Return of Income once again declaring nil
taxable income. The AO thereupon issued a Questionnaire dated
21.3.2005 inter alia containing the following queries:
Why receipts from technical handling is not taxable,
furnish the evidence regarding claim that receipt is
covered under DTAA?
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 2 of 26

What is technical handling and apportioned expenses?
Furnish evidence for the amount received under
technical handling and expenses incurred?
Assessee's case is that these queries were duly answered in terms
of its letter dated 28.3.2005. The Assessee thereafter received
the impugned Notice dated 8.3.2006 also under Sections 147-148
of the IT Act stating that the AO had 'reason to believe' that
income had escaped assessment, this view having been concurred
with by the Commissioner of Income Tax. The Assessee again
furnished its Return of Income though under protest and
simultaneously requested for supply of the reasons recorded for
issuance of the Notice dated 8.3.2006. On 10.4.2006 a notice
under Section 143(2) of the IT Act seeking further information
was issued. Thereupon, the following reasons recorded on
8.3.2006 for the issuance of the Notice under Section 148 of the
IT Act were conveyed by the AO to the Assessee on 3.7.2006:M/s KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Netherlands
AY 2002-03
Reasons for Issuance of Notice u/s 148 of the Income Tax
Act, 1961
The assessee is a company incorporated in Netherlands.
It

is

into

the

business

operations

of

aircraft

in

international business as well as rendering of technical
services to other airlines. The assessee during the year
under consideration has declared the income from
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 3 of 26

rendering of technical services in its return of income
and has claimed the same to be covered under Article-8
of the DTAA between Indian and Netherlands. However,
no assessment for the relevant assessment year has been
made u/s 143(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. It is a
settled position, in the light of the decision of Delhi ITAT
in the case of British Airways PLC, that income from
rendering of technical services cannot be claimed as
covered under Article 8 of the DTAA. Therefore, the
income from rendering technical services shall be
subjected to tax in India.
In view of the foregoing I have reasons to believe that
income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for the
relevant assessment year within the meaning of Section
147 r.w.s. 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
(Pravin Rawal)
Assessing Officer
By letter dated 24.7.2006 the Assessee filed Objections to the
initiation of re-assessment proceedings. Subsequently, a letter
dated 6.10.2006 was issued by the AO to the Assessee granting it
a final opportunity to comply with the Notice under Section 142
(1) by 12.10.2006, failing which the AO would make the
assessment as per provisions of Section 144 of the IT Act. It is at
this stage that the present Writ Petition has been filed.

WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 4 of 26

3.

In respect of AY 2003-2004, on 25.2.2004 the Assessee suo

moto filed its Return of Income for AY 2003-2004 on the same
lines as in the previous year. A Notice dated 29.12.2004 under
Section 143(2) of the IT Act came to be issued to the Assessee,
inexplicably at the address of its Chartered Accountant. This was
followed by a Notice dated 16.9.2005 under Section 143(2) of the
IT Act issued yet again at the address of the Chartered
Accountant, followed by a Notice under Section 142(1) of the IT
Act dated 10.10.2005 raising certain specific queries one
amongst them being:“Please furnish details of all foreign payments made in
connection with your operations in India including
payments relating to engineering and technical handling
services”.
The Assessee asseverates that a detailed Reply dated 13.2.2006
had been forwarded in which the Questionnaire had been duly
replied to. One of the grounds taken therein was that a notice
under Section 142(1) had been received by the Assessee on
14.10.2005; and since no action had been started under Section
143(2) hence the proposed action was barred by limitation. It is
at this stage that the impugned Notice dated 8.3.2006 under
Section 148 came to be issued, which was responded to in terms
of the Assessee's letter dated 7.4.2006 along with the demanded
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 5 of 26

Return of Income.

The next event is the issuance of a Notice

under Section 143(2) of the IT Act, replied to by the Assessee in
terms of the letter dated 17.4.2006 praying inter alia for
furnishing a copy of the reasons. These are identical to the
'reasons' dated 8.3.2006 already extracted above. On 24.7.2006,
in respect of AY 2003-2004 the Assessee filed Objections to the
initiation of re-assessment proceedings which have been rejected
by the impugned undated common Order pertaining to both AYs,
stated to have been received by the Assessee on 19.7.2006.

4.

At this stage it will be relevant to take note of two decisions

of the Income Tax Appellate Authority (ITAT) on the subject
under consideration. On 24.9.2001 in the matter of British

Airways Plc. -vs- Deputy Commissioner of Income-Tax, 80 ITD 90
the ITAT Delhi-A Bench had come to the conclusion that so far as
British Airways was concerned “the rendering of engineering and
ground handling services to other airlines are in no way
inextricably linked with the operation of the aircrafts. If for any
reason the assessee stops rendering these services to the other
airlines, the activity of transport of international traffic in persons
and cargo will not be affected in any manner. .... Thus, in the
ultimate analysis, applying the analogy discussed in detail while
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 6 of 26

interpreting Article 8 of DTAA, I am fully in agreement with the
finding of the authorities below that the present activity cannot
be taxed under section 44BBA of the Income-tax Act, 1961”.
Thereafter, on 12.2.2004 ITAT Delhi-B Bench has decided

Lufthansa German Airlines -vs- Deputy Commissioner of IncomeTax, 90 ITD 310 and “noted that as per Article 8(4) of DTAA
between India and Germany, the profit from the participation “in
a pool” will not be taxable in India. But

Article 8(2) of DTAA

between India and UK talks of “participation in pool of any kind
by enterprises engaged in air transport”. The use of the word
“pools”

envisages

that

there

could

be

several

pools

or

understanding i.e. more than one. Here the word “pool” does not
indicate a pool which is internationally recognized. The use of
the word “pools of any kind” clearly indicates that it was in the
nature

of

commercially

understood

meaning.

But

in

the

international aviation industry, there is only one pool i.e. IATP.
Certainly, in the case of British Airways, it was not a case of
participation in a pool. In the appellant's case, it is participation
in IATP only. This was the reason that the ITAT has to find out the
meaning of the word “pool” in the case of British Airways.
Moreover, in the case of British Airways, it was “pools of any
kind” but in the case of the appellant, it was not a pool of any
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 7 of 26

kind but only IATP. Thus, the facts in the case of British Airways
were altogether different then the facts of the appellant's case
and the view taken by the ITAT in the case of British Airways is
not applicable in the case of appellant as the facts are entirely
different. We have also noted that British Airways has rendered
services to Atlas Air Corporation which is not a member of IATP.
The services rendered to that airline could not be bound by IATP
manual.” We cannot ignore the fact that the Lufthansa decision
has not been taken into consideration by the Revenue in the
“reasons for issuance of notice u/s 148 of the Income-Tax Act,
1961 dated 8.3.2006”.

5.

Mr. C.S. Aggarwal, learned Senior Counsel for the Assessee

has emphasised upon the distinction between the two airlines
decisions delivered by different Benches of the ITAT. According
to him, British Airways had been extending technical handling
services to entities not covered by the DTAA and hence was found
not to be entitled to the benefits of the Treaty, whereas this was
not the position in the Lufthansa case. It was for this reason
that the Assessee had, in the Objections filed in consonance with
the ratio of GKN Drive Shafts (India) Ltd. -vs- ITO, 259 ITR 19
(SC), specifically relied on the Lufthansa case, which, according
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 8 of 26

to the Assessee, applies on all fours in its favour. We, however,
shall steer clear from recording any conclusion on this aspect
since it is not called for in the context of the present Writ
Petitions. Presently, we are not concerned with the merits of the
dispute; the only question is whether the pending proceedings
under Sections 147/148 are palpably devoid of jurisdiction and
hence are liable to be terminated through the exercise of the
jurisdiction vested in this Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India.

6.

Mr.

Sanjeev

Sabharwal,

learned

counsel

for

the

Respondent/Revenue has set-out in sequential order the manner
in which re-assessment proceedings should be conducted. It
would commence with the recording of 'reasons to believe' on the
basis of the information received by the AO that income
chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. It appears to us that
where an assessment has not been framed at all it is not possible
to posit that income has 'escaped' assessment. Notice under
Section 147 calling upon the Assessee to file its Return of Income
would thereupon be issued with the consequence that the
Assessee would have to file its Return of Income. Simultaneously
with or immediately after the Assessee makes this compliance it
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 9 of 26

would be entitled to be apprised of the 'reasons to believe' which
had constituted the springboard for the Sections 147/148 action.
The Assessee would then have the right to file Objections
remonstrating

against

the

assumption

of

re-assessment

proceedings which would have to be answered by the AO before
delving

further

in

the

assessment,

re-assessment

or

re-

computation proceedings as the case may be. Mr. Sabharwal's
contention that during Re-assessment since the AO has to clarify
the contents of the Return and/or the escaped income notices
under Section 143(3) are to be issued within twelve months, is
not free from doubt.

He has not clarified as to whether this

procedure can be followed without completing the relevant
pending assessment.

7.

In our opinion Sections 147/148 cannot be interpreted in

isolation of the other provisions of Chapter-XIV of the IT Act
which is the fasciculous dealing with the procedure for
Assessment. Section 139 makes it mandatory for every person
whose total income exceeds the maximum amount which is not
chargeable to Income-Tax, to furnish a Return of Income by the
due date. Section 142 deals with the inquiry before Assessment.
The first sub-section thereof empowers the AO to issue a notice to
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 10 of 26

any person to file a Return or to produce its Accounts or any
documents or to provide any information as the AO may require.
Sub-section(2) empowers the AO to make any inquiry he
considers necessary. Sub-section (3) incorporates the audi

alteram partem rule of natural justice viz. providing to the
affected party an opportunity of being heard. Section 143 deals
with the dispatch of intimations specifying the sum payable as tax
or interest that has been found by the AO to be due on the basis
of the Return; it deals with refunds payable to the Assessee. The
neat question which arises before us is whether on the
commencement of assessment proceedings must they first be
brought to their logical conclusion by framing an assessment
before embarking on the proceedings as envisaged in Sections
147/148 of the IT Act; or more precisely stated, can resort to
Section 147 be made even whilst the normal assessment
proceedings are pending conclusion. To find the answer we must
keep in perspective that every Return of Income filed under
Section 139 may not result in its active and in-depth perusal or
consideration by the AO as it may receive an automatic onward
passage under Section 143(1). However, once an inquiry has
been initiated by the AO, it cannot but result in either the Return
being accepted as having been correctly computed by the
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 11 of 26

concerned Assessee, or for an Assessment being conducted and
concluded thereon by the AO. The provisions of Section 147
would have no role to play at this stage of the proceedings. Once
a Return of Income attracts the attention and scrutiny of the AO,
it is his bounden duty to delve into every aspect thereof. The AO
is sufficiently empowered to ask for all information necessary for
framing the Assessment. The only fetter on the amplitude of his
discretion is that the Assessment must be framed within the time
limit set-down by Section 153 which, in substance, is two years
from the end of the Assessment Year in which the income was
first assessable or one year from the end of the Financial Year. A
perusal of its second sub-section makes it clear that proceedings
under Section 147 are altogether different to those under Section
143. This distinction appears to have escaped the attention of the
Revenue. Sub-section(2) stipulates that no order under Section
147 shall be made after the expiry of one year from the end of the
Financial Year in which notice under Section 148 was served.

8.

Section 147 of the IT Act deals with the powers of the AO to

'assess' or reassess the income chargeable to tax which has
escaped assessment. Section 148 contemplates making the
'assessment', reassessment or recomputation under Section 147.
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 12 of 26

Keeping the factual matrix before us in perspective, it becomes
critical to define the word assess since the AO is avowedly not
reassessing or recomputing the income presented by the assessee
for taxation in the form of its Return. It is trite that the words
assess, reassess or recompute are not synonymous of each other.
It seems to us that an assessment must entail a conscious and
concerted calculation carried out by the concerned officer with a
view to determine the amount of tax payable by any person. The
exercise commencing with Section 139 and ending at Section
145A cannot be interpreted as identical to or overlapping
Sections

147/148/149.

They

are

predicated

on

different

circumstances and operate in disparate dimensions. The IT Act
makes it incumbent upon every person whose total income
exceeds the maximum amount which is not chargeable to IncomeTax to file a Return of Income in order to kick-start the normal
assessment procedure.

However, it may happen that a person

fails to file a Return of Income, say for the AY 2000-2001, even
though he is liable to pay tax. It could also happen that a person
may file a Return of Income incorrectly offering for purposes of
taxation a sum lower than the correctly calculated income. Both
these situations have been obviously kept in view in 2nd
Explanation to Section 147 and in its clauses (a) and (b). In either
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 13 of 26

event the AO would invoke the powers conferred upon him by
Section 147 of the IT Act culminating with the completion of the
assessment. It is also conceivable that the incorrectness of the
Return may not be detected or noticed within the time period setdown in Section 153. In these circumstances if the AO has reason
to believe, predicated on information received by him, that
income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment, he would
invoke the powers under section 147. On the other hand, where a
Return of Income has been filed but has been taken at its face
value, without any proceedings under Section 143(2) and 143(3)
having been conducted, no assessment exercise would obviously
have been undertaken. After the expiry of the time period setdown in Section 153, this situation can be remedied by the AO by
invoking Section 147. The word 'assessment' has been defined in
the Act in a most unsatisfactory manner, merely by stating that it
includes reassessment. A more comprehensive definition is
readily available in the Australian decision titled Batagol -vs-

Federal Commissioner of Taxation, (1963) 109 CLR 243 in these
words:
“assessment means the completion of the process by
which the provisions of the Act relating to liability to tax
are given concrete application in a particular case with
the consequence that a specified amount of money will
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 14 of 26

become due and payable as the proper tax in that case”.

9.

A 'clearance' or notice or intimation under Section 143(1)

of the Act clearly falls beyond the parameters of this definition.
In Punjab Tractors Ltd. -vs- Joint Commissioner of Income-Tax,
[2002] 254 ITR 243 it was opined that it is not necessary that
assessment should have been finalised under Section 143(3)
before it can be 'reopened' under Section 147, since an
intimation under Section 143(1) operates an order of assessment
unless the AO proceeds to give notice under Section 143(2) and
passes an Order under Section 143(3). This very understanding
of the law

has been articulated by the Division Bench of the

Allahabad High Court in Pradeep Kumar Har Saran Lal -vs-

Assessing Officer, [1998] 229 ITR 46 which, in turn, followed the
view of the Calcutta High Court in Jorawar Singh Baid -vs- CIT

(Asstt.), [1992] 198 ITR 47 wherein it has been observed that
-”the power that can be exercised under section 143(2) to correct
the assessment made under section 143(1) does not exclude the
power of the Assessing Officer to reopen the assessment under
section 147 if the ingredients of section 147 are satisfied. It is
open to the Assessing Officer to invoke the jurisdiction under
section 147, notwithstanding the fact that there are other
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 15 of 26

remedies open to him under the Act. It cannot, therefore, be
accepted that the reassessment under section 147 is vitiated
because the Assessing Officer failed to invoke his power to
correct the assessment already completed under section 143(1)
by issuing a notice under section 143(2) of the Act”.

However,

in the present case since inquiries had been initiated under
Section 143(2), it became mandatory that they should have
culminated in an order under Section 143(3).

10.

In Trustees of H.E.H. The Nizam's Supplemental Family

Trust -vs- CIT, [2000] 242 ITR 381(SC) the Apex Court has
observed that it is “settled law that unless the return of Income
already filed is disposed of, notice for reassessment under
Section 148 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, cannot be issued, i.e., no
reassessment proceedings can be initiated so long as assessment
proceedings pending on the basis of the return already filed are
not terminated. According to the Revenue it is immaterial
whether the order is communicated or not and the only bar to the
reassessment proceedings is that proceedings on the return
already filed should have been terminated”. The following
concluding passage from the said Judgment is self-explanatory:A return of income filed in the form prescribed
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 16 of 26

along with an application for refund under section 237 of
the Act is a valid return. There is no stopping the Incometax Officer to complete the assessment on the basis of the
return so filed. It may be that the Income-tax Officer may
limit the scope of examination of the return to satisfy
himself regarding the correctness of the amount claimed
as refund. For that purpose, he will examine if the tax
paid by the assessee exceeds the amount of tax with
which he is chargeable. If it is found that the income was
“nil”, he will direct that refund be granted to the
assessee of any amount of tax paid. That will certainly be
assessment. The filing of a return in the form prescribed
under section 139 of the Act along with the application
for refund is not an empty formality. It assumes
importance if such return had not been filed earlier. We
have reproduced the note/order dated November 10,
1965, on the file pertaining to the assessment year 196364. In the file for the assessment year 1962-63 there is
another note which is as under:“Please see my note in 1963-64 file. Refund to
be considered in the hands of the beneficiaries”.
A mere glance at this note would show that it could
not be said that the Income-tax Officer gave finality to
the refund since no refund is granted either in the hands
of the trust or in the hands of the beneficiaries. It is an
inconclusive note where the Income-tax Officer left the
matter at the stage of consideration even with regard to
refund in the hands of the beneficiaries. This note was
also not communicated to the trustees. When we examine

WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 17 of 26

the note dated November 10, 1965, on the file of 1963-64
nothing flows from that as well. In any case if it is an
order, it would be appealable under section 249 of the
Act. Since the period of limitation starts from the date of
intimation of such an order, it is imperative that such an
order be communicated to the assessee. Had the Incometax Officer passed any final order, it would have been
communicated to the assessee within a reasonable
period. In any case, what we find is that the note dated
November 10, 1965, is merely an internal endorsement
on the file without there being an indication if the refund
application

has

been

finally

rejected.

By

merely

recording that in his opinion, no credit for tax deducted
at source is to be allowed, the Income-tax Officer cannot
be said to have closed the proceedings finally. The
decisions referred to by the Revenue are of no help in the
present case. We are, thus, of the opinion that during the
pendency of the return filed under section 139 of the Act
along with the refund application under section 237 of
the Act, action could not have been taken under section
147/148 of the Act. Our answer to the question,
therefore, is in the negative, i.e., against the Revenue.
(underling added)

11.

We would arrive at this very destination even if we were to

traverse along a different dialectic, namely, if we were to analyse
the circumstances in which Section 147 of the IT Act could be
invoked. There is plenitude of precedents on this aspect of the
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 18 of 26

law; hence only some of them shall be discussed. The question
that had arisen before the Bombay High Court in Western

Outdoor Interactive P. Ltd. -vs- A.K. Phute, Income-Tax Officer,
[2006] 286 ITR 620(Bom) was whether, upon the Rectification
being set aside by the Commissioner(Appeals), notice for
reassessment on the same grounds could validly be initiated;
there was no failure on the part of the assessee to disclose
material facts and no fresh information had been received by the
AO. At best, it was possible to say that two views were available
and in such a situation it was held that the said provision was not
available.

In

particular,

the

Bench

noted

the

following

enunciation of the law in Indian Oil Corporation -vs- ITO, [1986]
159 ITR 956(SC):
The principles on this branch of law are wellsettled.
To confer jurisdiction under clause (a) of section
147 of the Act beyond the period of four years but within
a period of eight years from the end of the relevant year
under section 148, two conditions were required to be
fulfilled: the first is that the Income-tax Officer must
have reason to believe that the income, profits or gains
chargeable to tax had been underassessed or escaped
assessment; the second is that he must have reason to
believe that such escapement or underassessment was
occasioned by reason, so far as relevant for the present
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 19 of 26

purpose, to disclose fully and truly all material facts
necessary for the assessment of that year. Both these
conditions are conditions precedent to be satisfied. See,
in this connection, the observations of this court in

Calcutta Discount Co. Ltd. -vs- ITO, [1961] 41 ITR 191.
As is well-settled now by the several authorities of
this court and of several High Courts, there must be
materials to come to the conclusion that there was
'omission or failure to disclose fully and truly all material
facts necessary for the assessment of the year'. It
postulates a duty on every assessee to disclose fully and
truly all material facts necessary for the assessment.
Therefore, an obligation is to disclose facts; secondly,
those which are material; thirdly, the disclosure must be
full and fourthly, true. What facts are material and
necessary for assessment will differ from case to case.
In every assessment proceeding, for computing or
determining the property tax due from the assessee, it is
necessary to know all the facts which help the assessing
authority in coming to the correct conclusion. From the
primary facts in his possession, whether on disclosure by
the assessee, or discovered by him on the basis of the
facts disclosed, or otherwise, the assesssing authority
has to draw inferences as to certain other facts. But on
the primary facts, it is for the taxing authority to draw
inferences. It is not necessary for the assessee to draw
inferences

for

him.

See,

in

this

connection,

the

observations in Calcutta Discount.

The Full Bench of this Court in Commissioner of Income-

Tax -vs- Kelvinator of India Ltd., [2002] 256 ITR 1 had opined
that the amendments introduced into Section 147 with effect
from 1.4.1989 have not altered the position that a mere change of
opinion of the AO was not sufficient ground for embarking on a
reassessment. Calcutta Discount was duly considered and
applied by the Full Bench. The Full Bench further observed that
an order of assessment must be presumed to have been passed
by the AO concerned after due and proper application of mind. In
these circumstances the decision of the Division Bench in

inasmuch as it is irreconcilable with the views of the Full Bench,
must be held not to lay down the correct law. This is especially so
since the assessment proceedings had not come to an end under
the first sub-section of Section 143, but under the third subsection.

A Division Bench of a particular High Court is fully

bound by the view preferred by a larger Bench of that Court,
regardless of the fact that another High Court prefers a different
view [in this case that of the Gujarat High Court as in Gruh

Ltd. -vs- Deputy CIT (No.1), [1996] 222 ITR 27(Guj.)]. The Full
Bench of this Court has taken into consideration both Praful

Chunilal Patel as well as Garden Silk Mills. In Kelvinator the
Full Bench had also analysed the earlier Division Bench
decisions,

namely,

-vs-

Deputy

Commissioner of Income-Tax, [1998] 234 ITR 170 presided over
by R.C. Lahoti, J. (as learned Chief Justice of India then was) and

Bawa Abhai Singh -vs- Deputy Commissioner of Income-Tax,
[2002] 253 ITR 83 comprising Arijit Pasayat and D.K. Jain (as
their Lordships then were). It is quite possible that had the Court
in Consolidated Photo been made aware of the consistent
opinion of this Court in Jindal Photo and Bawa Abhai Singh,
their conclusion may have been totally different, notwithstanding
alternative view of the Gujarat High Court.

13.

It also needs to be clarified that in Mahanagar Telephone

Nigam Ltd. -vs- Chairman, Central Board of Direct Taxes, [2000]
246 ITR 173 the Division Bench of this Court opined that an
intimation under Section 143(1)(a) cannot be treated to be an
Order of Assessment. Therefore, although the assessment had
been completed under Section 143(1)(a), recourse could be taken
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 22 of 26

to Section 147. In that case while finalising assessment for the
AY 1996-1997 under Section 143 it was found that the claim of
license fee made by the assessee was erroneous and should have
been disallowed.

14.

The

diametrically

opposite

position

had

arisen

in

Commissioner of Income-Tax -vs- Sun Engineering Works P. Ltd.,
[1992] 198 ITR 297(SC). It was held that “in the reassessment
proceedings, it is not open to an assessee to seek a review of the
concluded item, unconnected with the escapement of income, for
the purpose of computation of the income escaping assessment;
and, therefore, the Tribunal was right in holding that the
respondent was not entitled to reagitate the question of the setoff of losses in the reassessment proceedings”. In other words,
reassessment must invariably be preceded by a conclusion of the
original proceedings. The decision of the Supreme Court in

Esthuri Aswathiah -vs- ITO, [1961] 41 ITR 539; 1961[2] SCR 911
was applied by the Division Bench of the Madras High Court in

M. Ct. Muthuraman -vs- Commissioner of Income-Tax, Madras,
[1963] 50 ITR 656 in reaching the conclusion that for the AYs
1953-54 and 1954-55 the proceedings were lawfully terminated
by the remark “N.A.” on the Assessment File and notices under
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 23 of 26

Section 34 of the Indian Income-Tax Act, 1922 were not invalid.
With regard to the AYs 1950-51 and 1951-1952 the assessment
proceedings have not been closed in any manner and as they
were pending, the notices under Section 34 were invalid. Finally,
the notice for AY 1952-1953 was invalid as the notice was issued
before the date on which the Appeal in respect of that year was
disposed of.

15.

Applying this line of decisions to the facts of the present

case, the inescapable conclusion that would have to be reached is
that while assessment proceedings remain inchoate, no 'fresh
evidence or material' could possibly be unearthed. If any such
material or evidence is available, there would be no restrictions
or constraints on its being taken into consideration by the AO for
framing the then current assessment. If the assessment is not
framed before the expiry of the period of limitation for a
particular AY, it would

have to be assumed that since

proceedings had not been opened under Section 143(2), the
Return had been accepted as correct. It may be argued that
thereafter recourse could be taken to Section 147, provided fresh
material had been received by the AO after the expiry of
limitation fixed for framing the original assessment. So far as the
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 24 of 26

present case is concerned we are of the view that it is evident
that, faced with severe paucity of time, the AO had attempted to
travel the path of Section 147 in the vain attempt to enlarge the
time available for framing the assessment.

This is not

permissible in law.

16.

Mr. Sabharwal, learned counsel for the Revenue, has also

challenged the legal propriety of the present writ proceedings.
We have already recorded our view on this aspect of the law in
WP(C)

Nos.4997/2005,

5010/2005,

5062/2005

titled

Basu

Distributors Pvt. Ltd. -vs- Income-Tax Officer Ward 2(3), New
Delhi decided on 15th December, 2006 and we do not intend to
make this Judgment prolix by reproducing them. Suffice it to
state that wherever and whenever it appears to the High Court
that proceedings have been initiated or are continuing without
the authority of the law the High Court would be in dereliction of
duty if it hesitated in exercising the extraordinary powers
contained under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India. In
the present case since the AO was duty-bound to conclude the
assessment before resorting to Section 147 of the IT Act, it is our
bounden duty to issue a writ of Certiorari so as to bring these
legal proceedings to a definitive halt. The dicta in GKN Drive
WP(C) No.16574-75/2006

Page 25 of 26

has been not duly followed since the Objections filed by the
Petitioners, in our view, have been disposed off contrary to law.

17.

In this analysis the Writ Petitions are allowed.

The

initiation of proceeding under Section 147 of the IT Act was
irregular and illegal on the short ground that Returns of Income
having been filed and since no order of assessment had been
finalised by the AO, there was no scope for invoking Section 147.
The pending proceedings are quashed. Since this aspect of the
law has already been clarified in various decisions, the Petitioner
shall be entitled to costs quantified nominally at Rs.25,000/-.
Costs to be paid within six weeks.
