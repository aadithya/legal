The petitioners have filed this petition under Section 34

of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 for setting aside of the
arbitral award dated 19.8.2000 of the sole Arbitrator Sh Sandeep
Tandon in the matter of Karamyogi Group. The petition is also
accompanied with an application under Section 14 of the Limitation
Act for exclusion of time spent in pursuing the earlier OMP No.
267/2000 wherein the petitioners were respondents no. 3, 16, 11, 19
OMP No. 478/2007

I have heard Mr.Sanjay Jain, learned Senior Advocate

who appeared on behalf of the petitioners and have also perused the
paper book of the present petition.
3.

The factual matrix of the case giving rise to this petition

is as follows;
4.

Certain disputes and differences arose between the

parties arising out of business of Karamyogi Group of Companies
and the same were referred to the sole Arbitration of Mr.Sandeep
Tandon. The learned Arbitrator after hearing the parties passed his
award on 19.8.2000. Subsequent to the publishing of the award, the
petitioners herein filed an application before the learned Arbitrator
under Section 33(1) and 33(4) of the Arbitration Act on 17.9.2000 for
making an additional award. The learned Arbitrator after receiving
copy of the said application passed an order dated 19.10.2000 and
sent copy of the same to the petitioners. Aggrieved by the aforesaid
award passed by the learned Arbitrator, some of the parties filed
objections under Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,
1996 which were registered as OMP No. 276/2000. The petitioners in
the present petition were respondent nos. 3, 16, 11, 19 and 20
respectively in OMP No. 276/2000. They had filed their reply to the
OMP No. 478/2007

Page 2 of 10

objections in OMP No. 276/2000. The reply was filed by them on
25.4.2001. The petitioners who had filed their reply in OMP No.
276/2000 had supported the objections and have prayed for setting
aside of the arbitral award. However, except the petitioners the
other respondents in OMP No. 276/2000 did not file any reply to the
objections in OMP No. 276/2000. The objections in OMP No.
276/2000 were withdrawn by the petitioners of that case and an
application filed by respondents no.1, 8, 9, 12 and 53 for their
transposition as petitioners was also dismissed by the learned Single
Judge vide order dated 6.11.2001. Aggrieved, by the dismissal of
application for transposition, the respondents no. 1, 8, 9, 12 and 53
filed an appeal (FAO (OS) No. 537/2001) which was also dismissed
by the Division Bench of this Court vide order passed on 15.5.2007.
It is after the dismissal of the said appeal, the petitioners herein
who were respondents no. 3, 16, 11, 19 and 20 in OMP No. 276/2000
have filed the present petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking to set aside the arbitral award dated
19.8.2000/19.10.2000. The petitioners have also filed an application
under Section 14 of the Limitation Act and have prayed for exclusion
of the time spent by them in pursuing the proceedings of OMP No.
276/2000 while computing the limitation for filing of objections
OMP No. 478/2007

Page 3 of 10

under Section 34 (3) of the Arbitration Act.
5.

The main question that arises for consideration is

whether the time spent by the petitioners in pursuing the
proceedings of OMP No. 276/2000 can be excluded under Section 14
of the Limitation Act for computing the limitation provided in
Section 34(3) for filing of objections against the arbitral award.
6.

Mr.Jain appearing on behalf of the petitioners had

vehemently argued that the petitioners are entitled for exclusion of
time spent by them in pursuing the earlier proceedings in OMP No.
276/2000 as they were pursuing the said proceedings with due
diligence. It was contended that the order of the Division Bench
dated 15.5.2007 dismissing the appeal of those respondents whose
request for transposition was disallowed by the learned Single Judge
should not come in the way of the petitioners herein for challenging
the arbitral award by way of present petition. Mr.Jain had further
argued that the case of the petitioners is distinguishable from that of
respondents whose appeal was dismissed by the Division Bench vide
order dated 15.5.2007 inasmuch as the respondents whose request
for transposition was disallowed had not filed any objections or even
an application for condonation of delay whereas the petitioners who
now seek to challenge the arbitral award dated 19.8.2000/19.10.2000
OMP No. 478/2007

Page 4 of 10

had filed their opposition to the arbitral award by way of their
written statement in OMP No. 276/2000 and also by way of their
reply filed in FAO (OS) NO. 537/2001.
7.

I have given my anxious consideration to the arguments

advanced on behalf of the petitioners but I could not persuade myself
to agree with any of the contentions advanced on behalf of the
petitioners.
8.

Admittedly, the arbitral award which is now sought to be

challenged in the present petition was published by the learned
Arbitrator on 19.8.2000. This fact is admitted by the petitioners in
Para 22 of their written statement (Annexure P-6) filed in OMP No.
276/2000. The objections against the arbitral award have been filed
by the petitioners after about seven years. Section 34(3) of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 prescribes a period of three
months to be reckoned from the date on which the party intending to
file objections had received the arbitral award. The proviso to subSection 3 of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act confers a discretion
upon the Court to entertain the objections within a further period of
30 days in case the Court is satisfied that the applicant was
prevented by sufficient cause from filing the objections within the
prescribed period of three months. As per provisions contained in
OMP No. 478/2007

Page 5 of 10

Section 34(3) the Court cannot extend the time for filing of objections
beyond four months:9.

Provisions of Section 34(3) came to be interpreted in the

decision of Supreme Court in Union of India vs. Popular
Construction Company, IV (2001) CLT 65 (SC)=VII (2001) SLT
104=(2001) 8 SCC 470. IN the said decision, the Supreme Court held
that the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 being a 'special law'
and the provisions of Section 34 providing for a period of limitation
different from that prescribed under the Limitation Act, the said
provisions would govern the period of limitation and not any
provisions of the Limitation Act. It was held by the Supreme Court
that by virtue of Section 34(1) of the Act, recourse to a Court against
an arbitral award cannot be made beyond the period prescribed in
Sub-section (3). This court is of the view that Section 34 of the Act of
1996 is a complete code with regard to scope, parameters and the
grounds on the basis of which an application to challenge an award
can be filed.”
10.

In the present case, the objections have been admittedly

filed by the petitioners against the arbitral award beyond prescribed
period of four months. However, the petitioners have prayed for
exclusion of time spent by them in pursuing the proceedings of
OMP No. 478/2007

Page 6 of 10

earlier OMP No. 276/2000. The petitioners were respondents no.3,
16, 11,

19 and 20 in that petition. It is no doubt true that the

provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act are applicable to the
arbitration proceedings under the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,
1996. Reliance in support of this proposition is made to a judgment
of the Supreme Court in State of Goa vs. Western Builders (2006)
6 SCC 239. Though as a general proposition the Limitation Act,
1963 applies to the arbitration proceedings under the 1996 Act but
still the question is as to what extent Section 14 of the Limitation
Act which deals with exclusion of time spent in prosecuting the
remedy before another forum would apply to the facts of the present
case. Section 14 of the Limitation Act 1963 reads as under :“14. Exclusion of time of proceeding bona fide in court
without jurisdiction (1)In computing the period of limitation for any suit the time during
which the plaintiff has been prosecuting with due diligence
another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance or of
appeal or revision, against the defendant shall be excluded, where
the proceeding relates to the same matter in issue and is
prosecuted in good faith in a court which, from defect of
jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to
entertain it.
(2)In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time
during which the applicant has been prosecuting with due
diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first
instance or of appeal or revision, against the same party for the
same relief shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted
OMP No. 478/2007

Page 7 of 10

in good faith in a court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other
cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it.
(3)Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 2 of Order XXXIII of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), the provisions of
sub-section (1) shall apply in relation to a fresh suit instituted on
permission granted by the court under rule 1 of that Order where
such permission is granted on the ground that the first suit must
fail by reason of a defect in the jurisdiction of the court or other
cause of a like nature.
Explanation – For the purposes of this section, (a)

in excluding the time during which a former civil proceeding
was pending, the day on which that proceeding was instituted
and the day on which it ended shall both be counted;
(b)
a plaintiff or an applicant resisting an appeal shall be deemed
to
be prosecuting a proceeding;
(c)
misjoinder of parties or of causes of
action
shall
be
deemed to be a cause of a like nature with defect of jurisdiction.”
11.

A plain reading of Section 14 of the Limitation Act would

show that the party who seeks exclusion of time spent in earlier
proceedings has to show that he was pursuing the earlier
proceedings in good faith and with due diligence in a Court which by
defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature was unable to
entertain the said earlier proceedings. In the present case, the
petitioners admittedly did not file any objections against the arbitral
award in the earlier proceedings in OMP NO. 276/2000. They were
simply arrayed as respondents in that case and merely because they

OMP No. 478/2007

Page 8 of 10

had filed their reply in the earlier proceedings cannot be construed
to mean that they were prosecuting their remedy against the
arbitral award in good faith or with due diligence. Furthermore, the
Court in which the earlier proceedings were prosecuted did not
suffer from any defect of jurisdiction.

Had the petitioners would

have filed their objections against the arbitral award, the Court in
which earlier proceedings (OMP No. 276/2000) were pending was not
incompetent to deal with the objections of the petitioners. Even if it
is assumed that the petitioners were interested in opposing the
award through their reply filed in OMP No. 276/2000, the
appropriate remedy available to them was to have made an
application to the same Court for their transposition or to file an
appeal against the order of the Single Judge before the Division
Bench. Having not availed that remedy, the petitioners cannot now
be heard to say that they were prosecuting the earlier proceedings in
good faith or with due diligence. Furthermore, it may be noted that
though according to the petitioners themselves the arbitral award
was published on 19.8.2000 and thereafter order on their application
under Section 33(1) and 33(4) of the Arbitration Act was passed on
19.10.2000, the petitioners had not filed their reply in opposition to
the award within the statutory time period prescribed for filing of
OMP No. 478/2007

Page 9 of 10

objections

under

Section

34(3)

of

the

Act.

The

written

statement/reply to OMP No. 276/2000 was filed by the petitioners on
25.4.2001 and this was admittedly beyond the prescribed time period.
Thus, looking from any angle the only inescapable conclusion is that the
petitioners are now precluded from filing objections against the arbitral
award and that they are not entitled to any exclusion of time allegedly
spent in pursuing earlier proceedings of OMP No. 276/2000.
12.

In view of the above, the application filed by the petitioners

under Section 14 of the Limitation Act fails and is hereby dismissed.
Consequent thereto the main petition filed by the petitioners seeking to
challenge the arbitral award is also dismissed in limini as barred by
limitation.
