V.B. GUPTA, J.
The present appeal has been filed under Section 260A

ITA No.134/2008

Page 1 of 8

of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short as „Act‟) by the
Assessee

challenging

the

impugned

order

dated

8th

December, 2006 passed by the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal (for short as „Tribunal‟), Delhi Bench „D‟ in
IT(SS)A No.26/DEL/2004 pertaining to block assessment
period from 1st April, 1990 to 10th August, 2000.
2.

The brief facts of this case are that a search was

conducted at the premises of the Assessee on 20 th July,
2000. Thereafter, notice under Section 158BC of the Act
was issued to the Assessee and the Assessee filed the
return for the block period on 22nd June, 2000 declaring
undisclosed income of Rs.47,93,000/-, details of which have
been mentioned in the assessment order.
3.

During the course of assessment proceedings, the

Assessing Officer brought to the notice of the Assessee that
the undisclosed income of the family members of the group
concerns had wrongly been disclosed by the Assessee in

ITA No.134/2008

Page 2 of 8

the return of undisclosed income.

The Assessee filed his

letter dated 11th September, 2000 with revised particulars
of undisclosed income to Rs.20,55,000/-.
4.

The

Assessing

undisclosed income

Officer
as per

assessed
return

the

to the

original
extent of

Rs.47,93,000/-. A sum of Rs. 69 lacs was assessed on the
basis of slip No.5 Annexure A-13 of the seized documents
and an addition of Rs.2,000/- was made on account of
interest of loan.
5.

The Assessee challenged the order of the Assessing

Officer

by

way

of

appeal

and

in

the

appeal

the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) (for short as
„CIT[A]‟) deleted the additions made in respect of family
members and other group concern besides the addition of
Rs.69,00,000/- was reduced to Rs.47,00,000/-.
6.

Cross appeals were filed by both the parties and the

appeal filed by the Assessee was partly allowed whereas,

ITA No.134/2008

Page 3 of 8

the appeal of the Revenue was dismissed.
7.

Now,

the

Assessee

has

filed

present

appeal

challenging the impugned order passed by the Revenue.
8.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

Assessee that the Tribunal cannot decide which sums in a
document, seized during the search, are to be treated in
what manner under the Act without first determining
whether the document is a dumb document or not.
Furthermore, the document seized was having only names
and figures but no dates, no units and there were nothing
to indicate receipts or expenditures.
9.

In the present case, the Assessee has made the

conditional

offer

in

his

statement

which

has

been

mentioned by the Assessing Officer in his assessment order
and the same is reproduced as under:“Actually, the slip#5 contains two types of
entries-one from where the money had either
come to me or I was supposed to receive it.
The other type of entries where those where I
ITA No.134/2008

Page 4 of 8

was supposed to give money or had already
given them. If you would see carefully, you
will find that some entries have been ticked
right(). All such entries are those where
money had to be given by me or had already
been given away. The sources obviously was
profits earned by me or money taken from
others by me. The total of all such amounts
which has been given away be me comes to
58 lacs. The entries which have not been
ticked right, are those from where I had
either taken the money or was supposed to
take the money. Out of these, 10 lacs in the
name of Kapil was accounted for. The total of
unaccounted money received or receivable
comes to 11 lacs. It would also be very clear
that unticked() entries are incoming receipts
or receivable if you take into consideration
the fact that the amount of 10 lacs in the
name of Kapil had been received by me and is
unticked. So, the net income of Rs.17 lacs
which includes money given away or yet to be
given. It does not in any way mean that I had
47 lacs with me which I had given away. In
fact, I have never possessed an amount
anywhere close to 47 lacs but to buy peace of
mind and avoid litigation. I am ready to let
this amount be treated as money given or to
be given away in consequences to the profits
and wholly and solely out of the profits
generated from my business activities. But
my surrender is only on the condition that
this amount of Rs.47 lacs is treated as
application of unaccounted profit as admitted
by me earlier in this statement.

ITA No.134/2008

Page 5 of 8

I‟m doing this solely for the reason of buying
peace and avoiding litigation so that I can be
a free man to carry out my business activities,
which have suffered heavily because of
unfounded allegation about my involvement
in betting and match fixing. By now, would
also have how false allegation were. I simply
want to get over with this.
However, I would reserve my right to
contest and litigate if this surrender of 47
lacs is treated in any form other than
application of my unaccounted profits from
my business activities.”

10.

Thus, the Assessee has surrendered Rs.47,00,000/-

after due consideration of the documents seized.

The

subsequent retraction of the Assessee cannot be accepted
and there is no basis for accepting the same. The Assessee
had admitted that entries are in his own writing and has
also admitted this fact that some of the transactions shown
in the document were real. A document has to be accepted
or

rejected in toto. It cannot be said that a part of the

document is true whereas the other part is false.

ITA No.134/2008

Page 6 of 8

11.

The Assessee has thus declared Rs.47,00,000/- as

unaccounted income and has surrendered the same and
later on tried to retract

the statement given by him.

Therefore, the statement given by the Assessee under
these facts and circumstances cannot be allowed to be
withdrawn.
12.

In view of concurrent findings of facts, given by the

statutory

authorities,

that

Assessee

surrendered

Rs.47,00,000/- after due considerations, we do not find any
infirmity in the order passed by the Tribunal.
13.

Under these circumstances, no fault can be found

with the view taken by the Tribunal. Thus, the order of the
Tribunal does not give rise to a question of law, much less
a substantial question of law, to fall within the limited
purview of Section 260-A of the Act, which is confined to
entertaining only such appeals against the order which
involves a substantial question of law.

Accordingly, the present appeal filed by the Assessee

is, hereby, dismissed. .
