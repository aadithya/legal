JUDGMENT

P.K.BHASIN, J:

The petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under Section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for impugning the common order dated
19.09.2006 passed by learned Metropolitan Magistrate in respect of four
complaints filed by the petitioner-complainant under Section 138 of The
Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’) against the
respondent herein whereby all the four complaints were disposed of as having
been compounded. Since the order under challenge is same one in all these
petitions and the point involved is also common the same were heard together and
now I shall also be disposing of the four petitions by a common order.
2.

Factual matrix necessary for the disposal of the present petitions is that the

petitioner complainant is engaged in the business of Chit Funds. Respondent
became member of some Chit Groups and towards discharge of his liability in
respect of those Chits he issued several cheques of the total value of Rs.
2,03,500/- in favour of the petitioner but on presentment to his bank all the
cheques were dishonoured. Feeling aggrieved the petitioner filed four complaints
under Section 138 of the Act. The respondent on being summoned by the trial
Court entered appearance and contested the complaints which were in due course
clubbed together.
3.

During the pendency of the complaints, the respondent, however, showed his

inclination to settle the matter with the petitioner-complainant by moving an
application on 25-04-2006. It has been averred in these petitions that the

respondent had agreed outside the Court to pay Rs. 1,50,000/- towards full and
final settlement of the amounts involved in all the four cases and also paid Rs.
60,000/- to the petitioner as part payment and so the case was adjourned to 1909-2006. However on that date of hearing when complainant intimated the Court
about the aforesaid settlement the respondent backed out and claimed that the
settlement was for Rs. 1,00,000/- in all and that he was willing to pay the balance
amount of Rs. 40,000/-. The learned Metropolitan Magistrate then directed the
complainant to return the amount of Rs. 60,000/- to the respondent which he
declined upon which the trial Court passed the impugned common order disposing
of the four complaints as having been compounded relying upon a judgment of this
Court reported as 2004 (1) JCC (N.I.) 44.
4.

Aggrieved by the said order dated 19.06.2006, the petitioner has filed these

four petitions alleging therein that since there was no consensus between the
parties in respect of the terms of the settlement and which was not even got
recorded in Court or otherwise reduced into writing outside the Court, the trial Court
was not justified in treating the cases as compounded and that reliance on the
judgment of this Court in 2004 (1) JCC (NI) 44 was placed erroneously.
5.

Notice of these petitions was issued to the respondent who, however, did not

enter appearance despite having been served with the notice. So, I heard the
counsel for the petitioner only.
6.

After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner I have unhesitatingly

come to the conclusion that the impugned order is liable to be set aside. From the
averments made in these petitions and also from a perusal of the impugned order
it becomes apparent that there was no consensus between the parties as to the
amount which the respondent had agreed to pay to the complainant as a result of
the alleged compromise. The so-called understanding between the parties was not
arrived at before the Court nor was it reduced into writing. So, the learned trial
Court could not have taken note of any compromise and also could not have asked
the complainant to return the money received by it as part payment of the total
agreed amount which according to it was Rs. 1,50,000/-. Apart from this, the
impugned order is liable to be set aside also for the reason that the offence under
Section 138 of the Act has not been made compoundable under the Act. Hon'ble
Supreme Court in a judgment reported as AIR 1973 SC 84 had held that if under
any Special Act an offence under that Act is not made compoundable the same
cannot be compounded with or without the permission of the Court. In that case
the accused had agreed to sell two flats to the complainant of that case. It was
alleged that inspite of having received Rs. 28,000/- from the complainant the
possession of the flats was not delivered to him by the accused. The complainant
then filed a complaint against the accused under Section 420 of the Indian Penal
Code and Section 13 of the Maharashtra Ownership of Flats (Regulation of the
Promotion of Construction, Sale, Management and Transfer) Act, 1963. During the
pendency of that complaint the parties entered into an agreement by way of which

the accused undertook to do certain things within a certain period. Pursuant to the
said agreement the case was compounded and the accused was acquitted by the
Trial Court. However, after the acquittal the accused did not perform his part
under the compromise agreement and the undertaking given to the trial Court.
The trial Court then made a reference to the High Court for initiating contempt
proceedings against the accused.

The High Court, however, did not initiate

contempt proceedings but instead reversed the order of the trial Court whereby the
accused was acquitted and directed the trial Court to proceed with the trial. When
the accused approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court against the said decision of
the High Court his appeal was dismissed by observing that the offence under
Section 13 of the Maharashtra Act was not compoundable either with or without
the permission of the Court and, therefore, the trial Court was not right in
acquitting the accused on the basis of compromise between the complainant and
the accused. This legal position appears to have not been noticed by the learned
trial Court in the present case while disposing of the four complaints.
7.

In view of the foregoing, I allow these petitions and restore the four

complaints and the trial Court is directed to proceed further in the cases from the
stage at which they stood at the time of passing of the impugned order. The
complaints shall now be taken up by the trial Court on 30th November, 2007 and
the parties would be sent a notice of the said date by the trial Court for their
appearance.
