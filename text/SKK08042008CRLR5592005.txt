SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J. (Oral)
1.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (for short ‘CBI’) is
aggrieved by the impugned order dated 12.4.2005 passed
by

the

learned

Special

Judge

discharging

the

accused/respondents for offences under Sections 120B/409 of the IPC read with Section 13(2) and 13(1)(d) of
the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988.
2.

The case in question was registered on 27.7.1998 by the
CBI in respect of transaction during the period of 1994-95.
It was alleged that Shri K.S. Bains, the then Chairman and

Crl. Rev. P. No. 559 of 2005

Page No.1 of 9

Managing Director of Punjab & Sind Bank (hereinafter
referred to as the Bank) was a member of criminal
conspiracy with Shri Gurpal Singh, the then General
Manager (Operations) of the Bank, Shri H.S. Pall, the then
Branch Manager of the Bank, Shri A.S. Roy, Managing
Director

of M/s.

Jayanti Business

Machines Limited,

Mumbai (for short ‘M/s. JBML’), M/s. Prasad & Company
(share broker) and M/s. JBML to cheat the Bank in the
matter of purchase and sales of shares of M/s. JBML and
sanction of limits for the said company.

Shri K.S. Bains

was alleged to have passed an order dated 23.12.1994
after meeting with Shri A.S. Roy for purchase of shares
worth Rs.2.00 crore on firm allotment basis and in
pursuance to the said order a note was moved by the
Funds Management Department of the Bank to the
Investment Committee. The Investment Committee in its
meeting held on 9.1.1995 rejected the proposal on the
ground that it was not possible to book profits for the Bank
for the financial year ending 31.3.1995. Shri Gurpal Singh
was, however, alleged to have submitted a note dated
18.1.1995 without referring to the earlier decision of the
Investment Committee in respect of purchase of shares to
the extent of Rs.2.00 crore at a premium of Rs.70.00 per
share. This note dated 18.1.1995 was placed before the
Investment Committee, which approved the same on
20.1.1995 and the proposal was subsequently approved

Crl. Rev. P. No. 559 of 2005

Page No.2 of 9

by the Board of the Bank on 2.3.1995.

The Bank

purchased 2.50 lakh shares and paid Rs.2.00 crore and
thus violated the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines
stipulating that the banks could invest up to five (5) per
cent of its incremental deposits in shares and debentures.
The investment under the head was stated to be more
than the permissible limit.

The shares were sold by the

Bank through M/s. Prasad & Company at rates lower than
the prevailing market rates and the share broker was
allowed to retain the proceeds from the sale of shares for
about six (6) months causing wrongful pecuniary gain to
the company and the share broker to the extent of
Rs.2,49,062.00 with corresponding loss to the bank.
3.

It was also alleged that the Bank extended underwriting
support of Rs.1.00 crore to the Company, which was
sanctioned by Shri K.S. Bains and approved by the
Management Committee on 17.2.1995. Shri Gurpal Singh,
however extended the underwriting support by Rs.1.25
crore which was post facto approved by Shri K.S. Bains on
30.5.1995 and the enhancement of underwriting support
by Rs.25.00 lakh to the Company was not reported to the
Management Committee of the Bank.

Shri Gurpal Singh

also alleged to have made available bank funds by
sanctioning limits to an associate company for purchase of
shares and also sanctioned limits by arranging a proposal
within his powers though the proposal for a higher limit

Crl. Rev. P. No. 559 of 2005

Page No.3 of 9

which was beyond his powers was pending at the
Headquarters.
4.

On completion of investigation charge sheet was filed only
against Shri Gurpal Singh, General Manager (Operations)
of the Bank, Shri A.S. Roy, Managing Director, M/s. JBML
and

M/s.

JBML

through

its

Managing

Director,

the

respondents herein. The allegations forming the basis of
the charge sheet are that a proposal for purchase of
shares of the company to the tune of Rs.2.00 crore had
earlier been rejected by the Investment Committee on
9.1.1995. The charge sheet was based on the crucial fact
that Shri Gurpal Singh in pursuance to the criminal
conspiracy

submitted

the

subsequent

note

dated

18.1.1995 concealing the fact that the proposal had
already been rejected by the Investment Committee on
9.1.1995 and subsequently the Investment Committee
approved the proposal on 2.3.1995.

It may be noticed

that this proposal was based on the fact that the shares
would be disposed of before 31.3.1995 which would result
in the profit for the financial year ending in question.
There was, thus, a violation of the RBI guidelines.
5.

The Funds Management Committee in its meeting held on
6.3.1995 authorised Shri Gurpal Singh to sell shares of
M/s. Punwire Limited to bring the investment of the Bank
in the shares and debentures within the permissible limit
of the RBI but he failed to take any action to sell the

Crl. Rev. P. No. 559 of 2005

Page No.4 of 9

shares of M/s. Punwire Limited and paid Rs.2.00 crore to
M/s. JBML for investment in their shares on 18.3.1995.
6.

The sanction of Rs.4.00 crore under funded limit and
Rs.3.00 crore under non-funded limit for the Company was
placed before Shri Gurpal Singh on 18.1.1995 and Shri
Gurpal Singh sanctioned Rs.2.00 crore under the funded
limit which was conveyed to the concerned branch. This
funding was stated to be compensation to the Managing
Director Shri A.S. Roy for the amount to be paid by him
towards cost of shares.

Shri Gurpal Singh had invested

Rs.11.50 lakh in the name of his school going daughter,
Ms. Ranjeeta K. Singh in M/s. Vihanga Finance Pvt. Ltd., an
associate company of the said company on 19.10.1994 by
obtaining a loan of Rs.6.00 lakh from Citibank/Standard
Chartered Bank against shares and Rs.6.00 lakh from Shri
Labh Singh, Chairman of M/s. Tex India Silk Mills Limited,
which had been shown official favour from time to time by
Shri Gurpal Singh. Thus, Shri Gurpal Singh had received
Rs.12.90 lakh from M/s. Vihanga Finance Pvt. Ltd. Which
included Rs.1.40 lakh being interest within a short period
alleged to quid pro quo as investment of Rs.11.50 lakh for
about two (2) months.
7.

The statements of the prosecution witnesses have been
examined in depth by the Special Court and it was found
that the allegation against Shri Gurpal Singh that he put
up

the

proposal

Crl. Rev. P. No. 559 of 2005

in

the

Investment

Committee

on

Page No.5 of 9

20.1.1995 without referring to the earlier decision dated
9.1.1995 was baseless. Shri Gurpal Singh was not present
in the meeting of the Investment Committee on 9.1.1995
and the Minutes of this meeting never reached him
because they were not signed by the Directors and they
were

never

received

by

the

Funds

Management

Department from where they were rejected. The Special
Court has observed that even if it is assumed that Shri
Gurpal Singh was aware of the position of 9.1.1995 on
account of one of the witnesses deposing that he had told
Gurpal Singh about the same, the important factor which
could not be lost sight of was that there was only a lapse
of time of about ten (10) days between the rejection of the
first proposal and the acceptance of the second one by the
Investment Committee. It could, thus, hardly be said that
the Investment Committee was unaware of the earlier
decision taken by it ten (10) days ago.

In fact, the

testimony of the witnesses is said to support an apparent
interest of Shri K.S. Bains in the clearance of the proposal
though he was not named in the FIR and no evidence was
produced to put him for trial. Not only that, the evidence
collected showed that the shares of the company could
not be sold by 31.3.1995 but were ultimately sold by the
Bank at a profit and the Bank suffered no loss.
8.

Insofar as the sale of shares of M/s. Punwire Limited is
concerned it was found that a decision was taken to sell

Crl. Rev. P. No. 559 of 2005

Page No.6 of 9

the shares even at a loss but the action of Shri Gurpal
Singh of not complying with this decision could be a
dereliction of duty which may have resulted from a better
sense of business and economics rather than any criminal
conspiracy.
9.

The most important aspect is what is noted in paragraph
17 of the impugned judgement/order that the learned PP
himself during the course of arguments admitted that
there was no evidence that M/s. Vihanga Finance Private
Limited is a sister concern of M/s. JBML or that Shri A.S.
Roy was connected with the investment in the name of
the daughter of Shri Gurpal Singh in the finance company.
The two transactions could not be connected.

10.

The allegation about the advance allowed by Shri Gurpal
Singh was again found to be without basis because what
he had sanctioned was within his financial powers.

11.

Learned counsel for the petitioner again sought to
emphasise the same aspects which have been dealt with
by the Special Court.

12.

It is trite to say that in exercising the revisionary
jurisdiction this Court has to only examine the legality or
propriety of the finding in the order and not to sit as a
court of appeal. It is within the said parameters that the
rationale of the impugned order has to be scrutinized.

13.

In respect of the aforesaid, the Special Court record has
been perused and the submissions of the petitioner based

Crl. Rev. P. No. 559 of 2005

Page No.7 of 9

on the same lines as before the Special Court do not have
any merit.
14.

The first aspect relating to the proposal itself shows that
the matter at both stages was initiated by Shri K.S. Bains,
yet no material was brought against him.

It is only the

respondents, who were charged as accused. The role of
Shri Gurpal Singh was limited to putting up the note on
the second occasion without mentioning the factum of
rejection of the first proposal. It is not as if the Investment
Committee was unaware of the rejection of the first
proposal simply for the reason that the time lapse is only
ten (10) days between the rejection of the first proposal
and the acceptance of the second proposal.

The

respondents were not present at the meeting when the
first proposal was rejected. The Special Court has rightly
observed that even if the testimony of one of the
witnesses who has stated that he had informed Shri
Gurpal Singh is assumed to be correct it would have no
material significance for the reasons recorded aforesaid.
This reasoning can hardly be faulted.
15.

Shri Gurpal Singh is also not charged with violating the
sanction limit beyond his authority.

All that is stated is

that while the sanction for a higher limit was pending Shri
Gurpal Singh sanctioned a limit within his authority. This
again can hardly be faulted. An important aspect is that
the Bank never suffered a loss and has in fact gained

Crl. Rev. P. No. 559 of 2005

Page No.8 of 9

profits as noted in the impugned order.
16.

The only aspect on which Shri Gurpal Singh can be faulted
is not selling the shares of M/s. Punwire Limited to bring
the investment in the relevant category within the
permissible limits of the RBI guidelines but as the Special
Court has observed that it can at best be an irregularity
and can also be better sense of business and economics
since the shares were to be sold even at a loss. This can
hardly be a ground to charge Shri Gurpal Singh.

The

allegation against the other respondents is only of
conspiracy with Shri Gurpal Singh.
17.

In view of the aforesaid, I find no merit in the Revision
Petition.

18.

Dismissed.
