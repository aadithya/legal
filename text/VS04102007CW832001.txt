1.

The Petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 8th

February 2000 passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal,
Principal Bench, New Delhi, (hereinafter referred to as the
`Tribunal') in O.A. No. 964/1996 and the order dated 27.11.2000
passed in RA No.89/2000 filed in the aforesaid O.A. By these
orders, the OA and the RA respectively filed by the petitioner
W.P. (C) No. 83/2001

Page No. 1 of 5

were dismissed by the Tribunal.
2.

The Petitioner was earlier engaged as a casual labourer

in October 1975 and was regularized as a B.M. Khalasi on
3.4.1980 in the Grade 196-232. After being transferred to Railway
Electrification Organization on 8.12.1980, he was promoted on adhoc basis as clerk on 11.5.1983. He was further given ad-hoc
promotion on the basis of seniority to the post of Senior Clerk on
16.5.1986. The Petitioner sought regularization of his service as a
clerk but his representations did not bear fruit. Consequently, he
filed O.A. No. 964/1996 before the Tribunal seeking regularization
as a clerk from the date of his ad-hoc promotion, i.e. from
11.5.1983. The Tribunal dismissed the said OA by a short order on
8.2.2000. Paragraph 3 to 5 of the said order reads as follows:
“3. Applicant has not denied in rejoinder,
the specific averment of Respondents in
their reply that applicant was appointed as a
Khalasi in Mech. Engineering Deptt. And was
transferred to Railway Electrification Project
Organization, New Delhi on 26.12.1980 and
was promoted in REP Organization against
an ex-cadre post of clerk (Rs.260-400) on ad
hoc basis on 11.5.1983.
4.
Applicant has no enforceable legal
right to compel Respondents to regularize
him against an ex-cadre post outside his
own channel of promotion even if he has
been working against that post on ad hoc
basis since long.
5.
W.P. (C) No. 83/2001

Northern Railway letter dated 18.2.97

(Ann-III) does not help applicant's case as it
refers to eligible Group 'D' Staff (emphasis
supplied). No rule or instruction has been
shown by applicant to establish that an
employee of ME Department is eligible for
regularization as a Clerk in REP Organization
merely because he has been working
against the post of clerk on ad hoc basis in
that organization since long.”
3.

Thereafter the Petitioner preferred the aforesaid review

application which has been dismissed by the Tribunal by holding
that the order does not require any review.
4.

The

Respondents

have

filed

counter

affidavit

in

opposition to the Petition. The stand of the Respondents is that
the Petitioner was appointed as substituted Boiler Maker Khalasi
in the scale of 196-232 for Loco Shed in Moradabad on 4.4.1990;
that he is a unscreened Khalasi belonging to the mechanical
Engineering

Department;

he

was

transferred

to

Railway

Electrification Project Organization, New Delhi on 26.12.1980
where he was promoted against an ex-cadre post of clerk in the
Grade of 260-400 on 11.5.1985 purely on ad hoc basis. The
Respondent further states that the Petitioner has no legal right of
regularization as clerk on Moradabad Division, as he is an
unscreened substitute BM Khalasi. The Respondents further aver
that he is not eligible for promotion as clerk by virtue of his
position in his parent department in terms of the recruitment
W.P. (C) No. 83/2001

rules.

According

to

para

174(b)

of

the

Indian

Railway

Establishment Manual, Vol. I, Group 'D' Staff working as Office
Khalasi, Office Peon, Messenger, etc are eligible for promotion as
clerks against the promotion quota by selection. The Petitioner
has no enforceable legal right to seek regularization as a clerk
against an ex cadre post outside his own channel of promotion
merely because he is working in that post on ad-hoc basis since
long. The Petitioner is not even regularized in Group 'D' category
within his own cadre. He would need to be first regularized in his
turn in Group 'D' category in his own cadre before being
considered for regular promotion in Group 'C' category.
5.

The Petitioner places reliance on the decision of the

Tribunal on O.A. No. 1395/1992 and in other cases decided by the
Tribunal.

In

O.A.

No.

1395/1992,

the

applicants

sought

regularization as Material Checking Clerk (MCC)/Clerk from the
date they were working on ad hoc basis. The said OA was allowed
by the Tribunal directing regularization of the Petitioners therein.
6.

We find no merit in the petition filed by the Petitioner,

not only for the reasons recorded by the Tribunal that the
promotion on ad-hoc basis granted to the Petitioner was in the
RAP Organization against an ex cadre post of clerk, and that he
cold not seek regularization against an ex-cadre post outside his
W.P. (C) No. 83/2001

Page No. 4 of 5

own channel of promotion, but also for the reason that the same
would be contrary to the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in State of Karnataka vs. Uma Devi, 2006 4 SCC 1. The
ad hoc appointment as a clerk granted to the Petitioner was not
preceded by a due process of selection for recruitment to a
permanent post in compliance of the recruitment rules. In such
circumstances there is no question of the incumbent seeking
regularization to the post occupied by him for some length of
time. The decision cited, apart from not being a binding precedent
on this Court, is also in the teeth of the aforesaid decision of the
Supreme Court.
7.

We accordingly find no merit in this petition and

dismiss the same.
No costs.
