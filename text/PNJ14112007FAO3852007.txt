PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

Petitioner is the plaintiff.

He is aggrieved by the

order dated 16.1.2007 declining the prayer made to amend the
plaint. Reason which has weighed with the court is that inspite
of the objection taken in the written statement to the
maintainability of the suit, written statement

being filed on

23.2.2000, amendment was sought only on 18.9.2005.

In the

interregnum issues were framed and plaintiff filed affidavit by
way of evidence.

examination and repeatedly sought adjournment.
2.

Petitioner was appointed as a Manager by the

respondent and his services were terminated on 12.8.1999. He
filed a suit for declaration praying that letter of termination be
declared null and void. He sought mandatory injunction to be
reinstated in service.

He also prayed that a decree in sum of

Rs.1,03,700/- for past dues.

Prayer 'D' in the plaint was to

direct the defendant to pay to him salary @ Rs. 32,650/- p.m.
by way of mesne profits till he is reinstated.
3.

Plaintiff realized that he can not be reinstated and

has to seek quantified damages; that loss of salary could not
be claimed as mesne profits.

He sought amendment by

quantifying the damages.
4.

Learned Trial Judge has dismissed the application for

amendment holding that it has been filed belatedly and after
the trial had commenced. It has also been opined that by way
of amendment a suit for declaration is being converted into a
suit for damages.
5.

I note that the suit was filed on 16.10.1999 much

prior to the amendments incorporated in the Code of Civil
Procedure by and under the Amendment Act 22 of 2002. Thus,
the

pre-amended

provisions

of

Order

6

Rule

17 CPC

would
Page 2 of 4
govern the adjudication of the application in question.
6.

As held by the Supreme Court in the decision

reported as AIR 2002 SC 3369, Sampat Kumar Vs. Ayyakannu
where basic structure of the suit is not altered and amendment
sought relates to the nature of the relief prayed for it would not
amount to introducing a fresh plea nor would it amount to
changing the nature of the suit.
7.

In the said decision a suit for injunction was declined

to be amended to seek relief of possession.

Hon'ble Supreme

Court held that the amendment ought to be allowed holding
that the proposed amendment would not change the structure
of the suit.
8.

As noted hereinabove, a prayer for damages @

Rs.32,650/- per

month (stated to be mesne profits) till

reinstatement has been made in the original plaint. What the
plaintiff intends to do by way of amendment is to quantify the
damages.
9.

In view of the decision of the Supreme Court noted

hereinabove, the amendment needs to be
considering

that

the

petitioner

has

allowed.

delayed

filing

But,
the

amendment inspite of being cautioned when written statement

was filed on 23.2.2000 that the structure of the suit is
Page 3 of 4
defective, yet inspite thereof,

petitioner not taking step to

correct himself, inconvenience caused to the defendant needs
to be recompensed with adequate costs.
10.

I

note that the petitioner lingered on with the

defective suit for over 5 years and 7 months.
11.

I thus dispose of the petition setting aside the

impugned order dated 16.1.2007.

I allow the amendment

prayed for but subject to payment of costs of Rs.25,000/- by
the petitioner to the respondent. Cost would be paid in cash on
the next date of hearing before the learned Trial Judge.

On

cost being paid, amended plaint would be taken on record for
the reason, in said eventuality the amendment application filed
by the petitioner would be treated as having been allowed.
12.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to counsel for

the parties on payment of usual charges.
