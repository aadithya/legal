JUDGMENT
VIKRAMAJIT SEN, J.
1.

This batch of writ petitions challenges the legality of

the acquisition of land contiguous to the existing colony
called Rohini, the largest residential colony in Delhi, if not
India and Asia. Phases I to IV- of Rohini have already been
completed. The assailed acquisition was initiated by the
publication of a Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the Act)
bearing No.F.11(19)/2001/L&B/LA/20112 dated 21.3.2003.
A scanned copy of the Delhi Gazette: Extraordinary reads
thus:

2.

We have scanned the Gazette for the reason that

learned counsel for the Petitioners have

vehemently

contended that the rectangle by means of which the land
which is the subject matter of the acquisition has been
depicted is misleading. It will be relevant to record that if
the actual map is perused, the rectangle would be longer
from North to South than West to East. One of the
questions that arises is whether this erroneous depiction is
sufficient cause for invalidating the
Objections received

acquisition. The

in response to the Notification have

been rejected. Thereafter, the Declaration under Section 6
of the Act bearing F.11(11)/2004/L & B/LA/28281, was

acquisition includes Barwala, Rani Khera, Muhamadpur
Majri, Karala, Begumpur, Pehladpur Bangar, Pansali,
Mundka and Kirari Suleman Nagar (Patti Nithiari). It has
strongly been argued that the subject Notification is so
vague that it vitiates the

acquisition, and that details

similar to those contained in the Declaration could easily

The Objections under Section 5A are in great detail

having been prepared by the Petitioners' Advocates. Some
of the Petitioners have filed the Report prepared by the
Land Acquisition Collector pursuant to Section 5A of the
Act which would be beneficial to extract. It is significant
that the Report is not dated:

It is in this factual matrix that the acquisition has

been assailed on several grounds by Mr. Ravindra Sethi
and Mr.P.N. Lekhi, learned Senior Advocates among other
learned

counsel

for

the

Petitioners.

We

shall

now

endeavour to deal with each one of these Objections.
A. CHANGE OF PUBLIC PURPOSE
5.

The Notification recites that it appears to the Lt.

Governor, Delhi that land is likely to be required to be
taken by Government at public expense for a public
purpose namely for Rohini Residential Scheme. The recital
in the Declaration is to the effect that “the Lt. Governor,
Delhi is satisfied that land is required to be taken by
Government at the public expense for a public purpose

CW15946/2004

Page 44

namely

for

ROHINI

RESIDENTIAL

SCHEME

under

Planned Development of Delhi”. It has been contended on
behalf of the Petitioners that the Rohini Residential
Scheme has not been made public, and that it has not been
conceived of under the Delhi Development Act. The public
purpose should, it is argued, have been mentioned in the
proper detail, and since it is vague, the entire proceedings
are illegal and should be struck down by us. Reliance has
been placed on Hajari -vs- The State of M.P. Bhopal, AIR
1976 Madhya Pradesh 76. Speaking for the Full Bench
Justice J.S. Verma, as the learned Chief Justice of India
then was, opined that if the name of the village has been
specified this would ordinarily be sufficient compliance of
Section 4(1) of the Act as it indicated the 'locality' that was
affected by the proposed acquisition. This decision is not
an authority for the proposition that the village(s) must
invariably be named. In fact, the Full Bench observed that
if blocks within the village were left out, confusion may be
created in the minds of the villagers. The essence of the
Judgment is that the locality can be detailed by mentioning
the village concerned, but this is only one of the methods
CW15946/2004

Page 45

that can be adopted. This decision also does not advance
the argument that a diagram mentioning the boundaries of
the land that is proposed to be acquired is legally
improper.
6.

A similar opinion can also be found in the decision of

the Full Bench in Bahori Lal -vs- Land Acquisition Officer,
AIR 1970 Allahabad 414. The question that had arisen was
whether the description of the land sought to be acquired
without giving the number of plots but by referring to a
map which could be inspected in Office of the Collector
fulfilled the expectations of the law. In that case a mention
had been made that the land proposed to be acquired was
to the extent of 2.15 acres in Mauza Mathura, Pargana
Mathura and District Mathura and that a Site Plan was
available for perusal in the Office of the Collector.
Obviously, this description was too wide to indicate the
particular land which was to be acquired. Mr. Sethi has
also relied on NarendraJit Singh -vs- The State of U.P.,
1970(1) SCC 125. It was observed in paragraph 8 as
follows - “Section 4 does not require that the identity of the
CW15946/2004

Page 46

lands which may ultimately be acquired should be specified
but it enjoins upon the Government the duty to specify the
locality in which the land is needed. In the instant cases
the notifications suffer from a very serious defect in that
the locality where the lands were needed was not satisfied.
The notification merely showed that lands mentioned in the
schedule were needed. The schedule in its turn though it
contained the headings District, Pargana, Mauza and
approximate area, gave no particulars of the same and all
that was mentioned by way of a note was that the plan of
the land might be inspected in the office of the Collector of
Rampur. As no details were given, the only indication about
the locality of the lands was possibly the District of Rampur
inasmuch as the plan of the land was to be found in the
office of the collector of the same district. Certainly the Act
did not intend that all the persons owning land in a district
should rush to the Collector's office to find out whether his
lands were covered by the notification”. The underlined
sentence runs counter to the arguments put forward before
us. In Narindrajit Singh and Ranjit Singh -vs- The State of

U.P., (1973) 1 SCC 157 no compliance of Section 4(1) of
CW15946/2004

Page 47

the Act was made on the specious understanding that this
was not required because Section 17(4) of the Act had been
invoked. State of Mysore -vs- Abdul Razak Sahib, (1973) 3
SCC 196 is distinguishable for the reason that whilst the
Notification under Section 4 was issued in the Official
Gazette on August 17, 1961, notices, as required by that
Section, were not published in the locality till November,
1961. The action was struck down on this short ground.
These decisions are therefore irrelevant.
7.

Learned counsel for the Petitioners have also relied

on Madhya Pradesh Housing Board -vs- Mohd. Shafi,
(1992) 2 SCC 168 because of two findings made therein.
Their Lordships noted that a perusal of the schedule
appended to the Section 4(1) Notification showed that the
only description given about the particulars of 2.29
hectares of land proposed to be acquired was that it was
situated in District Mandsaur, Tehsil Mandsaur, Village
Mandsaur. Secondly, the 'public purpose' for which the
land was required was stated to be 'residential'. This
decision is of no relevance since the boundaries stated in
CW15946/2004

Page 48

the subject Notification leave no doubt of the lands which
fall within the contemplation of the Notification. Learned
counsel for the Petitioners have failed to sufficiently
substantiate how the mention of the high tension line at the
Western extremity of the land is at all nebulous. Similar is
the position as far as the North is concerned since the
Yamuna Canal has been adverted to which cannot create
confusion. The position is similar so far as the South is
concerned since the Rohtak Railway Line has been
depicted. The Eastern boundary refers to Phase -IV and V
of the land already acquired which obviously has reference
to Rohini. Persons whose land had not been acquired, at
the Eastern extremity of the Notification corresponding to
the Western side of Rohini Phase IV and V have been
clearly put to notice of the intentions of the Government,
and that such persons could avail of the opportunity of
filing Objections under Section 5A of the Act. In the
present case we are dealing with 3000 hectares of land and
it is certainly arguable that if minute and specific details
had been given in the subject Notification, it may be
undecipherable and incomprehensible to the concerned
CW15946/2004

Page 49

person. The Court must be satisfied that the description
was not such as would confuse the public with regard to
which land is sought to be acquired leading to a failure to
exercise the invaluable rights to object to the acquisition
in terms of Section 5A of the Act. Looking at the subject
Notification we are of the view that it conveys to the public
in a most satisfactorily definite manner of the lands which
are proposed to be acquired. We have already noted that
the development of several phases of Rohini has reached
an advance stage. All citizens of Delhi, and definitely
owners and occupiers of land adjoining or surrounding the
existing Rohini complex, cannot but be aware of what is
commonly known as the Rohini Residential Scheme as also
that this Scheme is an important part of the Planned
Development of Delhi.
8.

No useful purpose can be served by referring to

Munshi Singh -vs- Union of India, (1973) 2 SCC 337 since
this decision has been considered by the Constitution
Bench in Aflatoon -vs- Lt. Governor of Delhi, 1975(4) SCC
285, in which the Apex Court had granted its imprimatur to
CW15946/2004

Page 50

the phrase 'Planned Development of Delhi'. It appears plain
to us that the mention of Rohini Residential Scheme
provides added detail, and therefore cannot be faulted. So
far as the shape of the rectangular is concerned, since
boundaries have already been disclosed, likelihood of
confusion is minimal. Secondly, the fact that the rectangle
should be vertical and not horizontal is not a factor which
would weigh in the minds of the owners/occupiers of the
land. This discrepancy would be noted only by an astute
advocate, who in any case would harbour no doubt as to
the extent of the acquisition on a perusal of the boundaries
mentioned in the subject Notification. Topically, the Apex
Court was satisfied that the public purpose for acquisition
of land measuring 3000 acre 'for the execution of the
Interim General Plan for the greater Delhi' satisfied the
requirements of the Act in Lila Ram, Birla Cotton Spg. &

Wvg. Mills -vs- The Union of India, AIR 1975 SC 2112. In
S. Gurdial Singh -vs- Ludhiana Improvement Trust, AIR
1997 SC 2573 their Lordships were satisfied that since the
map and the scheme was available for inspection, and was

CW15946/2004

Page 51

also annexed to the Declaration, failure to disclose the
public purpose would not invalidate the acquisition.
9.

In this context Mr. Lekhi has drawn our attention to

Articles 239AA, 243E and 243F as also Section 50 of The
Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. It was on this basis
that he has submitted that rather than draw up a plan in
the Notification, a reference should have been made to
Wards, Khasra Nos. etc. The fallacy in the argument is that
this may be one of the methods whereby land can be
described for any purpose, but not the only one. So far as
Section 4 of the Act is concerned the Notification must
indicate the lands which may fall under the acquisition
hammer in order to put the owners/occupiers to caution
that firstly Government officials can enter upon the land to
inspect it with a view to assess its suitability for achieving
the public purpose mentioned in the Notification, and
secondly to enable the parties affected by Notification to
remonstrate against and resist the proposal by filing
Objections

under

Section

5A.

In

our

opinion

the

Declaration under Section 6 must perforce be in greater
CW15946/2004

Page 52

detail so far specifications of the land are concerned since
it has the effect of expropriating the land and not merely to
put the public to notice of the intention to do so. We find no
error in the manner of description of the land in the subject
Notification delineated for acquisition.
B. ACQUISITION OF LANDS SLATED FOR
REGULARISATION
10.

The

Deputy

Director

(LA),

Land

and

Building

Department, Government of NCT in terms of his Affidavit
dated 25.4.2007 has duly disclosed that there are 1432
applications

from

Resident

Welfare

Association

for

regularisation of unauthorised colonies in NCT of Delhi. Of
the 1072 such clusters 46 unauthorised colonies are stated
by him to be in existence in the Rohini Residential Scheme
(Zone M+H). A map has also been filed with the Affidavit.
There is some controversy as to whether the land in
question falls within these unauthorised colonies slated for
regularisation but we shall proceed on the basis that the
Petitioners' lands/properties fall within the category of
colonies likely to be regularised. The submission of the
CW15946/2004

Page 53

Respondents, however, is that regularisation has no
bearing on acquisition, which has to be completed in
consonance with the provisions of the Act. On the other
hand learned counsel for the Petitioners contend that no
purpose would be served in acquisition of the land if it is to
be

subsequently

regularised.

These

arguments

have

already been considered by the Full Bench of this Court in

Roshnara Begum -vs- Union of India, AIR 1996 Delhi 206,
which stands affirmed by the Supreme Court in Murari -vs-

Union of India, (1997) 1 SCC 15.

Their Lordships have

observed that where large expanses of land were to be
acquired for the `Planned Development of Delhi’, it would
not be proper to leave out portions therefrom only because
construction had been carried out. The Full Bench had
noted that in the event that any of the Petitioners were
covered by some policy of regularising the unauthorised
colonies the proper course to be adopted was to approach
the Government and not to question the acquisition. The
Full Bench had also affirmed the approach of

an earlier

Division Bench in Shri Bhagwan -vs- Union of India,
1991(2) Delhi Lawyer 59 (DB). B.N. Kirpal, J., as learned
CW15946/2004

Page 54

Chief Justice of India then was, speaking for the Division
Bench in Shri Bhagwan had observed that administrative
instructions where the Lt. Governor exercises the statutory
power

that

cannot

be

curtailed

by

Administrative

authorities can always change or modify their earlier
decisions, except where principles of promissory estoppel
have come into operation, i.e. where the petitioners had
acted to their detriment as a result of that administrative
policy. The Bench also rejected the argument that where
large-scale habitation on lands has already come into
existence, its acquisition ought not to be carried out. The
Bench pithily observed that they were not dealing with the
acquisition of land for allotment to a society, but rather for
the `Planned Development of Delhi’. The Bench also
repulsed the postulation that agricultural land could not be
earmarked for industrial or residential requirements,
applying Bharat Singh -vs- State of Haryana, 1988(4) SCC
534. The opening arguments that the “petitioners will be
rendered homeless and thousands, if not lacs, of families
will be uprooted if the acquisition is not quashed” did not
impress the Division Bench. This approach has also been
CW15946/2004

Page 55

favoured by another Division Bench of this Court presided
over Y.K. Sabharwal, J., as the learned Chief Justice of
India then was, titled Prem Chand Ramesh Chand -vs-

Delhi Development Authority, 66(1997) DLT 482(DB),
noting the argument “that there is any public policy to
regularise unauthorised colonies or there is a policy
decision not to acquire built up area, are concluded against
the petitioner by a Division Bench decision of this Court in
the case of Attar Singh vs- DDA (CW 3110 of 1991) decided
on 10th August, 1992”. In Attar Singh the Division Bench
recorded that it had been “contended that unauthorised
colonies on Government land are sought to be regularised.
It is possible that a political decision to this effect may be
taken with regard to some of the colonies but as far as this
land is concerned, there have been valid proceedings for
acquisition under the provisions of the Land Acquisition
Act. If there was any built-up area as on the date when
Section 4 Notification was issued, the claimants would be
entitled to receive compensation in accordance with law”.
Ironically, it is Mr. Ravinder Sethi who had ably argued

Prem

Chand

CW15946/2004

Ramesh

Chand,

but

for

the
Page 56

Respondent/DDA. Alas, he did not bring Prem Chand

Ramesh Chand to our notice. In this analysis this is now
the well-entrenched view, taken by the three Division
Benches of this Court, as also the Full Bench in Roshnara

Begum, affirmed by the Supreme Court in Murari.
Unfortunately, the same points are agitated time and again
before each and every Bench to which the Land Acquisition
Roster is assigned.
C. SHOULD PUBLIC POLICY PREVAIL
OVER STATUTORY LAW
11.

It was in these circumstances that Mr. Lekhi has

contended that statute law is always subservient to public
policy. According to him, Public Policy dictates that no
injury or deviation can be tolerated to the welfare of
citizenry, and by the same token tendencies harmful to the
public. Public Policy as defined in the Black's Law
Dictionary is - “The general principles by which a
government is guided in its management of public affairs,
or the legislature in its measures”. We have read the
decision of the House of Lords in Fender -vs- Mildmay,
1937 (Vol.3) All ELR 403 (at page 414). However, in our
CW15946/2004

Page 57

opinion, the observations are of no assistance to the
Petitioners. In his speech Lord Thankerton has said that
“there can be little question as to the proper function of the
courts in questions of public policy.

Their duty is to

expound, and not to expand, such policy. That does not
mean that they are precluded from applying an existing
principle of public policy to a new set of circumstances,
where such circumstances are clearly within the scope of
the policy. Such a case might well arise in the case of
safety of the state, for instance. No such case is suggested
here”. No such case is made out even before us. Public
Policy cannot override statutory law except in very rare
circumstances. It cannot be gainsaid that Public Policy, in
fact, finds expression in enactments of Parliament. It is
inconceivable that Public Policy can run counter to the will
of Parliament. Mr. Lekhi's reliance on the following
passage from De Smith Woolf and Jowell Judicial Review of
Administrative Action is not logical.

On the contrary the

observations militate against the Petitioners since they
have indubitably acted against the law and their endeavour
is to profit from their own misdeeds:
CW15946/2004

Page 58

Associated with the presumption of implied human
rights is the presumption that Parliament intends
the powers it confers to be exercised in accordance
with “public policy”. Public Policy is an “unruly
horse” which must be ridden with care, but it is the
public law equivalent of private law equitable
principles, such as that which states that no person
may benefit from his own wrong. Thus the courts
will presume that Parliament did not intend to
imperil the welfare of the state or its inhabitants. In
a recent case public policy has even been held to
override the clear terms of a statute, when to
conform with the letter of the statute might have
endangered a life.
12.

As has been correctly emphasised by learned counsel

for the Respondents the land in question is agricultural in
nature and contrary to this embargo, the Petitioners have
on their own showing constructed residential, commercial
or factory structures. We are also unable to accept Mr.
Lekhi's argument, which is in derogation of his argument
of the preeminence of Public Policy, that the Cabinet has
approved the scheme to regularise unauthorised colonies.
The impugned acquisition proceeds on the strength of the
Act and till such time amendments are carried out to this
CW15946/2004

Page 59

statute, a Cabinet decision would have no legal efficacy.
Our attention has also been drawn to the opinion of the
U.S. Supreme Court in Ellis Gregory, Jr. and Anthony P.

Nugent, Jr. Judges, -vs- John D. Ashcroft, Governor of
Missouri, 115 L. Ed. 2d 410. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
speaking for the majority, had observed as follows:
“Policy” is defined as “a definite course or method
of action selected (as by a government, institution,
group, or individual) from among alternatives and
in the light of given conditions to guide and
usu[ally] determine present and future decision”.
Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1754
(1976). Applying that definition, it is clear that the
decision making engaged in by common-law judges,
such

as

petitioners,

places

them

“on

the

policymaking level”. In resolving disputes, although
judges

do

discretion,

not
they

operate
do

with

choose

unconstrained
“from

among

alternatives” and elaborate their choices in order
“to guide and ... determine present and future
decisions”. The quotation from Justice Holmes in
the majority's opinion, is an eloquent description of
the policymaking nature of the judicial function.
Justice Cardozo also stated it well:

CW15946/2004

Page 60

“Each [common-law judge] indeed is legislating
within the limits of his competence. No doubt the
limits for the judge are narrower. He legislates
only between gaps. He fills the open spaces in
the law .... [W]ithin the confines of these open
spaces and those of precedent and tradition,
choice moves with a freedom which stamps its
action as creative. The law which is the resulting
product is not found, but made”. B. Cardozo, The
Nature of the Judicial Process 113-115 (1921).
Moreover, it should be remembered that the
statutory exception refers to appointees “on the
policymaking level,” not “policymaking employees”.
Thus, whether or not judges actually make policy,
they

certainly

policymaking

are
officials

on
in

the

same

other

level

as

branches

of

government and therefore are covered by the
exception. The degree of responsibility vested in
judges, for example, is comparable to that of other
officials that have been found by the lower courts
to be on the policymaking level. See, e.g. , EEOC v
Reno, 758 F2d 581 (CA11 1985) (assistant state
attorney); EEOC v Board of Trustees of Wayne Cty.
Comm. Coll. 723 F2d 509 (CA6 1983) (president of
community college).

CW15946/2004

Page 61

13.

We have given due deference to these weighty words

but once again fail to appreciate their applicability. If the
Cabinet has decided to regularise illegal colonies, it must
further ensure that its decision is translated into law. Until
this happens, there are no 'gaps' or 'open spaces' for us to
fill-up. We cannot see how we will not be transgressing the
very boundaries set-out in Ellis Gregory if we apply what
at best is inchoate or is law in preference to statutory
provisions that have held sway for over a century.
D. CHALLENGE TO SECTION 4 NOTIFICATION
14.

So far as the public character of the assailed

acquisition is concerned it is no longer possible to argue
that the Planned Development of Delhi is not a public
purpose

as

envisaged

under

the

Act.

There

is

no

precedential or statutory warrant for the submission on
behalf of the Petitioners that the Notification must mention
Khasra Nos. as well as the name of the village or revenue
estate etc. The locality which is within the purview of the
proposed acquisition must be indicated in any manner
which has the effect of notifying and cautioning persons
CW15946/2004

Page 62

possessing an interest in such lands that it would be
advisable for them to take recourse to Section 5A if they
intend to oppose the proposed expropriation of these
lands. The fact that the rectangle does not exactly and
correctly correspond to the actual map of the area in the
Notification is irrelevant in view of the precise boundaries
shown in the Notification. While it may be advisable to
mention the locality in the minute manner employed in the
Notification

dated

November,

1959,

outlining

its

boundaries is also an acceptable method. This view has
been adopted in Baldev Singh Dhillon -vs- Union of

India, 121(2005) DLT 606, in which Mr.Lekhi appeared for
the Petitioners.. The Notification need not be physically
signed by the Lt. Governor, so long as it is a direct product
of his decision. The impugned Notification may have been
signed by the Dy. Secretary (LA) but this officer has done
so on the orders of and in the name of the Lt. Governor of
Delhi and hence the objection is without merit.

We are

also not impressed by the contention that the Lt. Governor
blindly acceded to the Minister’s desire to
further acquisitions on
CW15946/2004

carry out

one of his visits to the locality.
Page 63

After detailed and protracted parleys in the Department,
the following Note had been prepared by the Deputy
Secretary (LA) and approved by the higher echelons:
A proposal for acquisition of land measuring
approximately 3000 hectare adjacent to the land
already acquired for Rohini Residential Scheme

(H.D.MAHI)
DEPUTY

SECRETARY

(LA)
10.1.03
JOINT SECRETARY( L&B)
The Note was received in the Office of the Lt. Governor
on 15-1-2003 and his consent was given a fortnight later.
There is adequate material to assume that the Lt. Governor
had considered the proposal in all its complexities. It is not
essential, nor in fact pragmatically possible, for a detailed
scheme to be in place at the time of either the subject
Notification, or for that matter on the publication of the
Declaration under Section 6. While exercising judicial
review we are not expected to substitute our satisfaction in
place of the satisfaction of the Government of NCT of
CW15946/2004

Page 66

Delhi.

There

is

enough

material

on

the

record

to

substantiate that the Notification follows a due exercise of
mind by the Lt. Governor. We are also unable to accede to
the arguments of learned counsel for the Petitioners that
the detailed Plan mentioned in the Notification was not
available for inspection in the Office of the Collector.
E. VALIDITY OF SECTION 5A PROCEEDINGS
15.

Although it has been argued that proper publication

of the subject Notification had not been carried out in the
locality, nevertheless a substantial number of Objections
under

Section

5A

had

been

filed

before

the

Land

Acquisition Collector by persons interested in the land
under acquisition. These Objections have been drafted and
even signed by Advocates. It would therefore be fair to
assume that all aspects of law have been properly covered
in

the

Objections

and

the

interests

of

all

inhabitants/occupants have been covered. The Petitioners
have asserted therein, as well as in the writ petitions, that
the Plans had not been made available to them. We find no
foundation for this incredible accusation except for the
CW15946/2004

Page 67

Petitioners’

ipse

dixit.

But

even

otherwise

nothing

substantial turns on it as we are satisfied that the
Notification adequately indicates the boundaries of land
which had come within its sweep. Whatever doubt that may
have remained would have been understood by the
Advocates of the Petitioners who prepared and filed the
Objections. Approximately 2500 Objections are stated to
have been filed. It is sanguine to suspect that the interests
of the Petitioners had not been safeguarded to the hilt. Yet
another

assertion

had

been

levelled

against

the

Respondents, namely, that a proper hearing had not been
granted to the Petitioners. We find no basis for this
submission. As mentioned above, the Petitioners were
represented by common Advocates. The Report (supra)
prepared in respect of Section 5A is indicative of the fact
that a proper hearing had been given to the Petitioners and
their Advocates. Learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioners
have sought to contend that all the Objections should have
been considered separately which we summarily reject in
the facts of the present batch of petitions. The Collector is
not expected to draft his Report as if he were writing a
CW15946/2004

Page 68

judgment. Portions of this Report, it should not be
forgotten, were not in favour of the proposed acquisition.
We find no merit in the argument that the Report is “nonspeaking” and it is vitiated for non-application of mind.
F. COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 6
16.

It has been enunciated several times by the Supreme

Court that Sections 4, 5A and 6 have to be read and
interpreted conjointly. This is so because their fields of
operation are interwoven and are integrated cogs in the
acquisition wheel. The most important of the three
provisions is Section 6 which actually alters, with finality,
the rights of the owners, occupiers or persons interested in
the land. When a decision is taken under Section 6, the Lt.
Governor would carefully consider the Report of the
Collector under Section 5A.

While doing so he would

invariably become broadly acquainted with the Objections
preferred by the owners/occupiers/persons interested in
the land since they would have been addressed and
answered in the Report.

Section 6(1) only contemplates

that the appropriate Government should consider the
CW15946/2004

Page 69

Collector's Report, and therefore it is futile to contend that
all the Objections (in the present case as many as 2500)
should be actually and/or separately perused. Anyone who
carefully reads the Report (supra) would become alive inter
alia to the factors that (a) there were several cases where
large scale construction had been carried out, (b) that
regularisation of these illegal colonies was under the active
consideration of the Government, (c) that the Petitioners
had challenged that the acquisition was not for public
purposes, (d) that hundreds of persons had remonstrated
against the proposal which would have the effect of
displacing and uprooting lakhs of citizens from their
homesteads

etc..

The

Petitioners

have

themselves

asseverated in the writ petitions that the Collector “has
neither accepted nor rejected the written objections. He
has given no reasons in support of either, whichever
manner his disposal of the written objections is read”. The
Correspondence and Notings also deal with the many
complexities that have become manifest in these litigations.
The pros and cons of the acquisition were at large before
the Lt. Governor. Assuming that the Report suffers from
CW15946/2004

Page 70

equivocation,

ambivalence and indefiniteness, the Lt.

Governor had no alternative but to exercise his mind and
take his own decision in the matter, even if he did so in the
course of one day, as has been asserted by the Petitioners,
and remarkably not traversed by the Respondents. We
must agree with Mr. Lekhi that the legal quality and
procedural propriety of the pleadings or counter-affidavits
is very shoddy. However, we cannot travel with Mr. Lekhi
the whole distance, viz. that every statement in the
response of the Respondents should be ignored inter alia
because the verifications are improper or because the
defence has been prepared by the authority not directly
concerned with
Government

the issue. It

henceforward

is our hope that the

conforms

to

the

detailed

parawise reply to writ petitions, as has been the well
established practice. Otherwise the High Court may
become intolerant of every failure to comply with legal
rigours of pleadings and cases would be lost by the
Government, regardless of their merits.

CW15946/2004

Page 71

17. The Petitioners have incorrectly pleaded that the Lt.
Governor passed an Order of one line on 17.3.2004 to the
effect that - “I agree to the proposal at 'A' prepage for the
issue of notification under section 6”. The Respondents
have not specifically traversed the statements in paragraph
64 of WP(C) No.15946/2004 wherein it has been stated
that after the Land Acquisition Collector had sent said
Report to the Secretary (L&B) Department, the latter sent
only the Report to the Lt. Governor/Administrator vide his
note dated 16.3.2004 without noting the detailed 2500 odd
objections filed; and that the Lt. Governor passed an Order
for the issuance of the Declaration on 17.3.2004. The
contention of the Petitioner is that since these decisions
were

taken

on

successive

dates,

the

Lt.

Governor/Administrator could not possibly have exercised
his mind with the diligence that the subject matter
requires. We have already observed that the Act does not
contemplate that the Lt. Governor must peruse each and
every Objections. If this were so it would become well-nigh
impossible to take a decision within the period prescribed
by the statute. It, however, remains uncontested that the
CW15946/2004

Page 72

Lt. Governor had before him not only the Report under
Section 5A but also a detailed note authored by the
Secretary (L&D). As in the Report the recommendations of
the Secretary (L&D) did not unequivocally and without
qualification recommend the complete acquisition by the
promulgation of the Declaration under Section 6. The
Petitioners have tried to mislead us by stating that a one
line Order had been passed by the Lt. Governor and for this
reason we are reproducing below the said Order in its
entirety. It will be evident from the reading of the Order
that it was well-informed, duly considered and taken
without undue haste. It makes it abundantly clear that a
decision to publish the Declaration had been taken after
the Lt. Governor/Administrator was subjectively satisfied of
the expediency of this measure.
I agree to the proposal at 'A' prepage for the issue
of notification under section 6.
For exclusion of the heavily built up areas, which
the government has agreed to regularise, we
should make use of the aerial photographs of
March
CW15946/2004

2002.

I

am

informed

by

Principal
Page 73

Secretary(UD) that prints of those photographs
have not yet become available and that we are
expecting them by end-March. As soon as we get
them, we should transpose the photographs on the
sizra and an exercise should be undertaken to
delineate the outer boundary of the built up parts
and exclude the khasra numbers falling within that
outer boundary from further proceedings under the
Land Acquisition Act. That boundary should also be
taken

as

the

limit

of

regularisation

and

if

authenticated copies should be sent to the agencies
concerned with regularisation and provision of
infrastructure.
Secretary(Land) may work on this approach further
and refine it in its implementational details.

Learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioners have

belaboured the fact that the succeeding Lt. Governor was
of the opinion that the method of superimposition of aerial
maps on sizra has its own problems. Our attention has also
been drawn to subsequent notings dealing with acquiring
the entire tract of land in the face of the likelihood of
regularisation of unauthorised colonies. No useful purpose
CW15946/2004

Page 74

will be served in doing so since the subsequent notings and
comments do not impinge upon the propriety of the
Declaration dated March 19, 2004 pursuant to the decision
of the Lt. Governor dated March 17, 2004. At best these
subsequent events, discussions and observations would be
relevant

for

a

decision

to

allow

or

disallow

the

Denotification of the acquired land in terms of Section 48
of the Act, in which neither the Writ Court nor the Civil
Courts have any role to play.

We are satisfied that the

Declaration dated 19.3.2004 has been issued in consonance
with the procedure.

G. OTHER GROUNDS BUT WHICH
HAVE ALREADY BEEN REJECTED
19.

A number of other grounds have been raised by

learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioners. It is argued that
the Rohini Residential Scheme is not a statutory Scheme. It
appears that this question had also been raised and
rejected by this Court in Baldev Singh Dhillon, to which
our

attention

CW15946/2004

was

not

drawn

during

the

opening
Page 75

arguments. Learned counsel for the Respondents had in
their Arguments in Reply made reference to

the said

decision. We must immediately state that learned Senior
Counsel for the Petitioners ought to have first brought

Baldev Singh Dhillon to our notice straightaway and
thereafter had endeavoured to convince us that that
decision should not be affirmed or approved. It is specious
to contend that the factual matrix in Baldev Singh

Dhillon is different to that obtaining in these Petitions and
hence it was not necessary for learned counsel to preface
their arguments with a reference to the said case. Mr.
Lekhi had fruitlessly relied on paragraph 312 of Bombay

Dyeing & Mfg. Co. Ltd.(3) -vs- Bombay Environmental
Action Group, (2006) 3 SCC 434. It is of no assistance
whatsoever to the Petitioners as it does not excuse them
for failing to draw our attention to dialectic of Baldev

Singh Dhillon. It is too simplistic to contend that Baldev
Singh Dhillon deals with the channelisation of River
Yamuna with which we are not presently concerned. There
is no manner of doubt that our attention should have been
drawn to Baldev Singh case prior to raising contentions
CW15946/2004

Page 76

that had already been answered in that case. Paragraph
312 of the Bombay Dyeing reads thus:312. So far as the order of this Court dated 11-52005 is concerned, again the validity or otherwise
of the BIFR Scheme and/or implementation thereof
was not in question. An order of this Court, it is
well known, must be construed having regard to
the text and context in which the same was passed.
For the said purpose, the orders of this Court were
required to be read in their entirety. A judgment, it
is well settled, cannot be read as a statute. (See
Sarat Chandra Mishra v. State of Orissa and State
of Karnataka v. C. Lalitha). Construction of a
judgment, it is well settled, should be made in the
light of the factual matrix involved therein. What is
more important is to see the issues involved therein
and the context wherein the observations were
made. Any observation made in a judgment, it is
trite, should not be read in isolation and out of
context.
20.

In this context Mr. Lekhi has also sought support

from the frequently quoted opinion of the House of Lords in

Quinn v. Leathem, 1901 AC 495 : (1900-3) All ER Rep 1,
namely, that “every judgment must be read as applicable to
CW15946/2004

Page 77

the particular facts proved or assumed to be proved .... The
other is that a case is only an authority for what is actually
decides”.

These

quotations

have

been

reiterated

in

Goodyear India Ltd. -vs- State of Haryana, (1990) 2 SCC 71
and State of Orissa v. Sudhansu Sekhar Misra , AIR 1968
SC 647. In the latter case, the Court explicitly opined that
“a decision on a question which has not been argued
cannot be treated as a precedent”. Their Lordships, in turn,
referred back to the previous opinion in Rajput Ruda Meha

-vs- State of Gujarat, 1980 SC 1707 in which it had
similarly been stated that where a question has neither
been raised nor argued any decision by the Court, even
after 'pondering over the issue in depth', would not be a
binding precedent. Similar observations have been made
by the Constitution Bench in Padma Sundara Rao -vs- State

of T.N., 2002(3) SCC 533, as is evident from the following
extract:
9. Courts should not place reliance on decisions
without discussing as to how the factual situation
fits in with the fact situation of the decision on
which reliance is placed. There is always peril in
CW15946/2004

Page 78

treating the words of a speech or judgment as
though they are words in a legislative enactment,
and it is to be remembered that judicial utterances
are made in the setting of the facts of a particular
case, said Lord Morris in Herrington v. British

Railways Board, (1972) 2 WLR 537. Circumstantial
flexibility, one additional or different fact may make
a world of difference between conclusions in two
cases.
None of these decision exonerate the learned counsel from
not bringing Baldev Singh Dhillon to our notice at the
very threshold of arguments.
21.

Our learned Brother, A.K. Sikri, J., had paraphrased

the argument of Mr. Lekhi in Baldev Singh Dhillon in the
following words and thereafter had considered and rejected
them in detail.:
(2) Alternatively, even otherwise without a scheme
there could not have been a notification under
Section 4 of the Act for acquisition of land. His
submission was that 'public purpose' was vague
once the land was acquired for 'Channelisation of
Yamuna River' there had to be a proper scheme in
the

place

CW15946/2004

before

land

was

acquired

for

the
Page 79

specified purpose. For this proposition he relied
upon the following judgments:
i. State of T.N. & Anr. v. A. Mohd. Yousef &
Ors., (1991) 4 SCC 224.
ii. Maharashtra Housing & Area Development
Authority and Anr. v. Gangaram and Ors.,
(1994) 2 SCC 489.
iii. M.P. Housing Board v. Mohd. Shafi & Ors.,
(1992) 2 SCC 168.
(3)

He also

attacked

the

notifications issued

without application of mind by the Competent
Authority. Referring to noting dated 11 th October,
1989 at page 11/N of the respondent's records, he
submitted that proposal for acquisition of land
proceeded on the basis that there was some
scheme of channelisation cleared by the Pune
Institute. He pointed out that Survey Report of 13 th
February, 1989 would indicate that entire exercise
was done within a period of two days which would
clearly indicate that it was mere formality as such
colossal exercise was not possible within this short
span.

refer to the Constitution Bench decision in Aflatoon. Their
Lordships

had

observed

that

“the

fact

that

actual

development is permissible in an area other than a planned
area with the approval or sanction of the local authority did
not preclude the Central Government from acquiring the
land for planned development under the Act. Section 12 is
concerned only with the planned development. It has
nothing to do with the acquisition of property; acquisition
generally precedes development. For planned development
in an area other than a development area, it is only
necessary to obtain the sanction or approval of the local
authority as provided under Section 12(3). The Central
Government could acquire any property under the Act and
develop it after obtaining the approval of the local
authority”. In Ajay Krishan Singhal -vs- Union of India,
(1996) 10 SCC 721 in which Mr. Lekhi had represented the
Petitioners

while

Mr.

Sethi

had

appeared

for

the

Respondent, the Court held that it was no longer res

integra that in the case of an acquisition of large tracts of
land belonging to different persons, the specification of the
purpose can only be with reference to the acquisition of the
CW15946/2004

Page 81

whole area. In State of Tamil Nadu -vs- L. Krishnan, AIR
1996 SC 497 it was held that acquisition of land could be
carried out even though a final and effective scheme had
not been framed. Eventually, this very question has been
discussed in detail by Sikri, J. in Baldev Singh and the
argument was repulsed. We respectfully concur with this
majority opinion.
23.

It has also been argued on behalf of the Petitioners

that the acquisition of the subject land runs counter to the
Master Plan and hence requires to be quashed. No
amendment to the Master Plan of Delhi has been mooted
and the Central Government has not accorded its approval.
In this regard we may merely refer to Bhagat Singh -vs-

State of U.P., (1999) 2 SCC 384 wherein in paragraph 22
their Lordships have recorded the following opinion:
22. As pointed out in the above judgments, there is
no need that the land proposed to be acquired by
the Government for a particular public purpose
should be for the same purpose or use mentioned in
the Master Plan or Zonal Plan for the said area. Nor
will the acquisition be invalid merely because the
CW15946/2004

Page 82

land proposed to be acquired is for a purpose other
than the one permitted by the Master Plan or Zonal
Plan applicable to that locality. Acquisition will be
valid if it is for a public purpose even if it is not for
the type of user permitted by the Master Plan or
Zonal Plan in force at the time the acquisition is
made.

It

will

be

for

the

beneficiary

of

the

acquisition to move the competent authority under
the Development Act and obtain the sanction of the
said authority for suitable modification of the
Master Plan so as to permit the use of the land for
the public purpose for which the land is acquired.
In fact, it may be difficult for the beneficiary of the
acquisition to move the competent authority under
the Development Act seeking permission to change
of land use even before the land is acquired or
before possession is given to the beneficiary. On
the principle stated in Aflatoon case it is clear that
acquisition for a public purpose and obtaining
permission from the competent authority under the
Development Act concerned for change of land use
are different from one another and the former is
not dependent upon the latter.
This precise question has previously been raised by Mr.
Lekhi and rejected by the Full Bench in Roshnara Begum.
Since

Roshnara Begum has been affirmed by the

CW15946/2004

Page 83

Supreme Court in Murari, we fail to appreciate why the
same question has been raised once again before us. In
paragraph 15, the Court observed that even after the
enforcement of the Delhi Development Act, 1957 Section
15(1) thereof prescribes that land for the purposes of
development may be acquired under the provisions of the
Act. We accordingly conclude that an acquisition of land,
contrary to the Master Plan, is not per se illegal.
24.

The next argument raised on behalf of the Petitioners

to the effect that the Lt. Governor is not the appropriate
Authority envisaged under the Act stands rejected by the
Supreme Court in Om Prakash -vs- Union of India, (1988) 1
SCC 356.
25.

Learned counsel for the Petitioners have drawn our

attention to Delhi Science Forum -vs- Delhi Development

Authority, 112(2004) DLT 944(DB) but we fail to appreciate
its relevance. The DDA had drawn ground water by digging
in violation to the ban imposed by the Central Ground
Water Authority and this action was castigated.

CW15946/2004

Page 84

26.

Finally, we shall consider the argument put forward

on behalf of some of the Petitioners that it was the
consistent policy that the land within 50 metres of the Lal
Dora of village Abadi would not be acquired. It has been
submitted

that

in

some

instances

Denotification

of

farmhouses had been ordered. We find no merit in these
arguments. We have already mentioned that there is no
legal embargo against acquiring of lands and buildings that
may be in the state of legal existence. Quite often this is
exactly what happens where land is acquired for widening
of roads. Normally, expropriation of such lands/buildings is
eschewed for the very simple reason that the compensation
payable is extremely high but this is a pragmatic practice
only. Where a large parcel of land is acquired for the
development of satellite colonies, it would not be advisable
from the standpoint of aesthetic, town planning etc. to have
pockets of property and land within the parcel of land
existing

in

isolation.

Uniformity

in

the

Planned

Development receives a severe setback in such cases.
Moreover, learned counsel for the Respondents have
correctly submitted that it is only the Petitioners ipse dixit
CW15946/2004

Page 85

that construction of farmhouses have been duly sanctioned
since

Title Deeds as well as Sanctioned Plans have not

been filed. Be that as it may we find no substance in this
argument even on merits.
27.

In conclusion it is our considered opinion that these

writ petitions deserve to be dismissed on the short ground
that the Petitioners have not approached the Court with
clean hands and equities are not in their favour. As has
been repeatedly underscored by learned counsel for the
Petitioners themselves the user of the lands in question is
agricultural. However, the Petitioners have carried out
constructions contrary to the prescribed user fully knowing
that their actions are not in consonance with the law.
Article 226 of the Constitution of India is a discretionary
and equitable relief and it would be inappropriate, if not
improper, for the Writ Court to extend its succor to parties
who have themselves knowingly and willfully transgressed
the law.

It

was

observed

in

Bal Kishan Chhabra –vs-

Union of India, 127(2006) DLT 460 that it will be of
relevance to underscore straightway that while exercising
CW15946/2004

Page 86

extraordinary jurisdiction the Court would not come to the
aid of a party which is guilty of malfeasance and failure to
adhere to the spirit of law and rules and regulations in the
public domain. Courts of law have to decide disputes which
come before them strictly in accordance with and not in
flagrant

violation

of

the

statutory

law.

Political

considerations have no role to play in judicial judgments.
The Government may, therefore, find it advantageous to
ignore the well-settled principles of law, or annihilate and
nullify its own decisions taken and executed in accordance
with law, by denotifying land legally acquired by it. The
Government

may

drag

its

feet

even

on

taking-over

possession of illegal colonies and defer demolition of illegal
and unauthorised structures. But Courts must uphold and
preserve the rule of law. Since we find no legal infirmity
with the actions of the Government taken under Sections 4
and 6 of the Act, we would dismiss these writ petitions even
on the solitary ground of the Petitioners having approached
the Court with unclean hands.

All interim Orders are

recalled.

These writ petitions are dismissed with costs of

Rs.5,000/- payable by each of the Petitioner to the
