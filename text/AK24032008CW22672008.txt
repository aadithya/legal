The petitioner/management has impugned the award dated 15th

February, 2007 of the Labour Court holding that the services of the
respondent workman were terminated illegally and, therefore, she is
entitled to be reinstated in service on the same terms and conditions
and granting her 100% back wages from the date of termination till she
is reinstated in the service.

The respondent workman had raised an industrial dispute which

was referred by the appropriate Government in the following terms:“Whether the services of Smt.Poonam Devi have been
terminated
illegally
and/or
unjustifiably
by
the
management, and if so, to what relief is she entitled and
what directions are necessary in this respect?”

3.

The respondent/workman had contended in her claim that she

was working with the petitioner for the last 9 years as a `sampling
maker’ and her last drawn wages were Rs.1784/- per month. She
alleged that she was not paid minimum wages and over time wages and
when she demanded the same she was refused duty by the
management from 18th September, 1997. She requested the petitioner
to allow her to join the duties till 4th October, 1997 and thereafter a
complaint was made by her to the Labour Department.

4.

The respondent/workman had asserted that she has remained

unemployed since her termination on 18th September, 1997 and she
has not been able to get any employment despite best efforts on her
part.

The claim

of the respondent was contested by the petitioner

contending inter-alia that

the reference made by the Government of

NCT was totally misconceived and untenable as the petitioner had not
terminated the services of the respondent and it was the respondent
who did not come to report for duty despite several reminders by the
petitioner and there exists no industrial dispute between the parties as
per the provisions of Industrial Dispute Act, 1947. The petitioner,
however, in their written statement to the claim filed by the respondent
admitted that the respondent was engaged as thread cutter since 1st
January, 1991 and her last drawn salary was Rs.1784/-. Any
harassment

alleged

by

the

respondent

was

denied

by

the

petitioner/management. The petitioner also contended that she was
never refused to join the duties and the services of the respondent has
not been terminated on 18th September, 1997 in contravention of the
provisions of law. The petitioner/management contended that the
respondent/workman abandoned the job on her own with effect from
18th September, 1997 and did not turn up to resume the duties despite
several reminders dated 29th September, 1997, 10th November, 1997,
24th January, 1998, 17th February, 1998, 19th march, 1998, 14th April,
1998, 15th may, 1998 and 25th June, 1998. It was also denied that the
respondent had come to report for duty till 4th October, 1997.

The Labour Court considered the pleas and contentions of the

parties. It appears that the petitioner was proceeded ex-parte. The
learned counsel for the petitioner has produced a certified copy of the
proceedings conducted before the Labour Court which reveals that the
evidence of the respondent/workman was concluded on 1st July, 2002
and

the

matter

was

listed

on

17th

September,

2002

for

the

petitioner/management witness. From 17th September, 2002 the matter
was adjourned on various dates for the evidence of the management
witnesses, however, the evidence was not recorded. The adjournments
were granted to the management subject to cost also which was paid,
however, the witnesses were not examined leading to closure of
management evidence on 31st March, 2006. After 2006 the matter was
taken up on various dates, however, no application seems to have been
filed by the petitioner for setting aside the order closing the evidence of
the petitioner management leading to an award dated 15th February,
2007 passed against the petitioner management.

7.

Perusal of the averments made in the writ petition also reveals

that no ground has been made out by the petitioner against closing of
his evidence on 31st March, 2006 after various opportunities were given
to the petitioner since 17th September, 2002. Therefore, there is no
cogent evidence on the part of the petitioner/management to refute the
established pleas of the respondent/workman.

The plea of the petitioner/management is that the respondent

abandoned her job on her own and did not report for work with effect
from 18th September, 1997. It is also contended that various reminders
were sent to the respondent workman to come and join the duties,
however, none of these alleged reminders had been served on the
respondent. The Labour Court has relied on the fact that the petitioner
failed to lead any evidence and prove those letters whether they were
actually sent and delivered to the respondent or not. The letter exhibit
WW.1/6 was not relied on as the same was sent after the receipt of
reference in the Court and the fact that in the written statement the
petitioner did not offer to take the respondent back on duty.

9.

Based on this that no letters have been proved by the

petitioner/management asking the respondent to come and join the
duties and the sole letter allegedly sent by the petitioner was also after
filing of the reference and in the written statement no offer was made to
the respondent/workman to come and join the duties, it is inferred that
the respondent did not abandon her employment on her own. Since the
respondent had been working from 1991, even according to the
petitioner, her services were not terminated after complying with the
mandatory provisions of Section 25F of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
WP (C) 2267 of 2008

The plea of the petitioner is that the workman abandoned the services
which fact has not been established by the petitioner. In these
circumstances, it has been held that the termination of the service of
the respondent was illegal and unjustified.

10.

While exercising its powers of judicial review under Article 226 of

the Constitution of India this Court is not to re-appreciate the evidence.
It is a settled position of law that in exercise of jurisdiction under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, the Court does not interfere with
factual findings of the lower courts and restrain itself from reappreciating evidence while exercising powers of judicial review.
Reliance for this proposition can be placed on the judgment of the
Supreme Court, Government of A.P. and Ors. v. Mohd. Nasrullah Khan
reported as (2006) 2 SCC 373. Reliance may also be placed on the
following judgments rendered by the Supreme Court and this Court
concerning the scope of judicial review by a writ court: Harbans Lal v.
Jagmohan Saran (1985) 4 SCC 333; B.C. Chaturvedi v. Union of India
(1995) 6 SCC 749; Indian Overseas Bank v. I.O.B. staff Canteen
Workers' Union AIR 2000 SC 1508 ; Municipal Corporation of Delhi v.
Asha Ram and Anr.117 (2005) DLT 63 and Filmistan Exhibitors Ltd. v.
N.C.T. Secy. Labour and Ors. 131 (2006) DLT. In all the above
judgments, it has been held that a writ court should refrain from
WP (C) 2267 of 2008

Page 6 of 8

interfering with the orders of an inferior tribunal or subordinate court
unless it suffers from an error of jurisdiction, or from a breach of the
principles of natural justice or is vitiated by a manifest or apparent
error of law.

11.

The learned counsel for the petitioner has also emphasized on the

letter dated 25th June, 1998, however, it is apparent that the same was
received by the respondent after the reference was made to the Court.
After the reference was made to the Court the petitioner filed the written
statement and in case their offer to the respondent was genuine they
should have made an offer even in their written statement asking
respondent to come and join the duties. An inference arrived at by the
Labour Court in the facts and circumstances is probable and
reasonable and this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article
226 of the Constitution of India will not substitute its own inference
with the inference drawn by the Labour Court. Consequently, there is
no manifest error or perversity in the award dated 15th February, 2007
nor there is any denial of principle of natural justice to the petitioner
management so as to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article
226 of the Constitution of India.

The writ petition in the facts and circumstances is without any

merit and it is dismissed.
