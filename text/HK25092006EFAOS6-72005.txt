Page No.1 of 10

25th November, 2000 to 25th September, 2003, on the sum
awarded by the arbitrator under an award dated 24th November,
2000.
2.

The brief facts of the case are that an execution

petition was filed by the respondent/decree holder against the
appellants/judgment debtors praying inter alia, for execution of
an

award

dated

24th

November,

2000

published

by

Dr.Y.P.C.Dangay, an arbitrator appointed by the Chief Engineer
(CDZ), New Delhi vide letter dated 5th June, 1998. The learned
arbitrator published the award on 24th November, 2000 under
which he awarded a sum of Rs.3,03,178/- in favour of the
respondent herein, claimant in the arbitration proceedings and
against the appellants herein, respondents in the arbitration
proceedings along with interest as awarded against claim No.14,
in full and final settlement of all the claims and counter claims
raised before him.
3.

Pursuant to the aforementioned award, the appellants

filed two applications for rectification, dated 12th December,
2000 and 25th January, 2001 pointing out certain errors in the
award against the claims No.10 & 11 and claim No.9 respectively.
After going through the said applications and the replies thereto,
EFA(OS) No.6-7 of 2005

Page No.2 of 10

the learned arbitrator rejected the first application for rectification
dated 12th December, 2000 stating that there was no error in the
award published against claims No. 10 & 11. With respect to the
second application for rectification dated 25th January, 2001, the
learned arbitrator modified the amount awarded under claim
No.9, by reducing it from Rs.24,450/- to Rs.23,215/-, vide order
dated 8th February, 2001 thus reducing the total awarded
amount to Rs.3,01,943/- along with interest as awarded in the
original award dated 24th November, 2000.
4.

Aggrieved

by

the

aforementioned

award,

the

appellants challenged the same by filing a petition under Section
34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter
referred as `the Act'). However, the said petition was dismissed
by the learned Single Judge.

As a consequence thereof, the

respondent filed an execution petition seeking execution of the
award dated 24th November, 2000 by way of execution petition
No.160/2001.

During the pendency of the aforesaid execution

proceedings, a sum of Rs.4,68,753/- was received by the
respondent/decree

holder

on

26th

September,

2003.

Subsequently, vide application under Section 31 (7) (b) of the Act
filed by the respondent/decree holder on 31st August, 2004, it
EFA(OS) No.6-7 of 2005

Page No.3 of 10

was submitted that while the appellants/judgment debtors had
paid the sum of Rs.4,68,753/-, they had not paid interest thereon
at the rate of 18% per annum from 25th November, 2000 to 25th
September, 2003, which comes to Rs.1,53,991/-, to which the
respondent/decree holder was also entitled. The said application
was allowed by the impugned order whereunder, warrants of
attachment were directed to be issued attaching a sum of
Rs.1,53,991/- in the account of the appellants/judgment debtors
with their bankers.
5.

Aggrieved by the said order, the appellants have

preferred the present appeal stating, inter alia, that by awarding
interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the sum awarded and
directed to be paid under the arbitral award, with effect from the
date of the award to the date of payment i.e. from 25th
November, 2000 to 25th September, 2003, the executing court
sought to modify or interpret the award, which is not permissible.
It was also submitted that in the said process, the executing court
awarded a further sum of Rs.1,53,991/- to the respondent in
addition to the amount payable under the award, which already
stood satisfied.

Lastly, it was contended that by passing the

impugned order, the executing court sought to exercise the
EFA(OS) No.6-7 of 2005

Page No.4 of 10

powers under Section 33 of the Act which were conferred only on
the arbitrator and not on the executing court.
6.

Having heard the submissions of learned counsel for

the parties and perused the records placed before us, including
the award and the impugned order, we are of the opinion that
there is no infirmity in the impugned order dated 10th February,
2005 inasmuch as the provisions of Section 31(7) (b) contained in
the Act, are self explanatory and leave nothing to imagination and
interpretation. Section 31, Sub-section (7) (b) of the Act reads as
under:

7.

“31 (7) (b): A sum directed to be paid by an arbitral
award shall, unless the award otherwise directs, carry
interest at the rate of eighteen per centum per annum
from the date of the award to the date of payment.”
In the award, the claim of interest is contained in claim

No.14 the relevant part of which is reproduced hereinbelow:
“Grant of interest is also presumed to be an implied
term of
the agreement.
Under the provision of
Arbitration Act, arbitral proceedings commence from
the date when the request is received by the
respondents stating that the dispute (s) be referred to
arbitration. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Shri V.Bhaskaran vs. M/s Sponge Iron India Ltd.-AIR
1997 SCR 1324, has confirmed an award of simple
interest @ 21% p.a. Under the provisions of Arbitration
& Conciliation Act, every arbitration award shall carry
an interest @ 18% p.a., if not specified otherwise. I
see no reason to disallow the claim of interest of the
claimants which I award @ 14% per annum (simple
EFA(OS) No.6-7 of 2005

Page No.5 of 10

interest) with effect from 20.12.1996 i.e.the date of
invocation of Clause 25 of the agreement on the
amounts awarded above, till the date of award.”
8.

A bare perusal of the aforesaid award makes it

manifest that the learned arbitrator was conscious of the
provisions of Section 31 (7) (b) of the Act.
9.

Hence, the provision of the Statute itself makes it

abundantly clear that unless an award otherwise specifies, any
sum directed to be paid under an award shall automatically carry
interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of the award
till the date of payment. In view of the fact that in the present
case, the award did not direct otherwise, it must be presumed
that the amount directed to be paid under the award would carry
interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of the award
to the date of payment. So understanding the relevant provisions
of the statute, in the context of the award rendered by the
learned arbitrator, the learned Single Judge while passing the
impugned order dated 10th February, 2005, held that the
respondent/decree

holder

shall

be

entitled

to

a

sum

of

Rs.1,53,991/- being the sum payable towards interest at the rate
of 18% per annum with effect from 24th November, 2000 i.e. date
of publishing the award, till 25th September, 2003, that is the
EFA(OS) No.6-7 of 2005

Page No.6 of 10

date on which the respondent/decree holder received the sum of
Rs.4,68,753/- (which included the principal awarded amount along
with interest at the rate of 14% per annum with effect from 20th
December, 1996 i.e. the date of invocation of clause 25 of the
agreement till the date of the award).
10.

It is, therefore, explicit from a perusal of the said

provision that any sum which is directed to be paid by an arbitral
award shall, unless the award otherwise directs, carry interest at
the rate of 18% per annum from the date of the award to the date
of payment. This being the mandate of the provision of the Act,
even if it was not so spelled out in the award, it has to be read
into the award and the executing court cannot be faulted in doing
so in the present case. This cannot be termed as a modification
of the award.

The submission of the learned counsel for the

appellants that the award already stood satisfied on payment of
Rs.4,68,753/- and that the provisions of Section 33 could only be
invoked by the arbitral tribunal and not by the court for carrying
out any correction and/or interpreting an award or passing an
additional award, is devoid of merits inasmuch as the executing
court has not exercised its powers under the said provision at all.
Nor has it corrected the original award or passed any additional
EFA(OS) No.6-7 of 2005

Page No.7 of 10

award. The learned Single Judge has only amplified the relevant
provisions of the Act and given effect to them by holding that the
respondent/decree holder is entitled to receive interest on the
awarded amount at the rate of 18% per annum from 25th
November, 2000 to 25th September, 2003.
11.

Even otherwise, it is a well settled rule of justice,

equity and fair play that the court has inherent jurisdiction to
award interest even in the absence of any legislation, agreement
or custom to that effect, though subject to contrary agreement.
As held by the Supreme Court in the case of South Eastern
Coalfields Ltd. Vs. State of M.P.and others reported as AIR 2003
SC 4482, “applicability of the rule to award interest in equity is
attracted on the existence of a state of circumstances being
established

which

justify

the

exercise

of

such

equitable

jurisdiction and such circumstances can be many...”
12.

In the above said judgment, reference was also made

to an earlier decision rendered by the Supreme Court in the case
of Executive Engineer, Dhenkanal Minor Irrigation Division, Orissa
& Ors. Vs. N.C.Budharaj (Deceased) by LRs. & Ors. reported as
AIR 2001 SC 626, wherein the controversy relating to the power
of an arbitrator (under the Arbitration Act, 1940) to award interest
EFA(OS) No.6-7 of 2005

Page No.8 of 10

for pre-reference period has been set at rest by the Constitution
Bench which opined that the basic proposition of law is that a
person deprived of the use of money to which he is legitimately
entitled has a right to be compensated for the deprivation by
whatever name it may be called ,viz.,interest, compensation or
damages and this proposition is unmistakable and valid; the
efficacy and binding nature of such law cannot be either
diminished or whittled down. It was also held that in absence of
anything in the arbitration agreement, excluding the jurisdiction
of the arbitrator to award interest on the amount due under the
contract, and in the absence of any other prohibition, the
arbitrator can award interest.
13.

In the present case, as already observed hereinabove,

the statute itself mandates under Section 31 (7) (b) that any sum
directed to be paid under an arbitral award, unless the award
directs otherwise,

shall carry interest at the rate of 18% per

annum from the date of award till the date of payment.
14.

We, therefore, find no infirmity in the impugned order

dated 10th February, 2005 passed by the learned Single Judge.
The appeal is devoid of merits and dismissed.

No order as to

costs.
