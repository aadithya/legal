PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
Appellant, Uttar Pradesh Roadways challenges the award

dated 5.10.1993. Vide CM No.779/1994, claimants have filed
cross objections praying that compensation awarded be
enhanced.
2.

On 10.6.1987, the deceased Gauri Shankar travelling on

his two wheeler scooter met with a road accident involving bus

FAO 58/1994

Page No.1 of 9

No.UGP-4485 owned by U.P. Roadways Corporation. He died.
3.

Claimants filed claim petition under Section 110-A read

with Section 92-A of the M.V. Act, 1939 claiming compensation
in sum of Rs.4 lacs on account of death of the deceased in the
said road accident.
4.

Parties were at variance as to the manner in which the

accident in question took place.
5.

Case set up by the claimants was that accident in

question occurred when deceased who was driving his two
wheeler scooter was hit from behind by the bus driven by
Sadiq Hussain, respondent No.2.
6.

Owner and driver of the bus on the other hand pleaded

that accident occurred when the deceased who was moving
between private bus and their bus tried to overtake the private
bus but in the process struck the private bus and fell from his
scooter behind their bus. They further pleaded that due to the
impact of the fall, deceased sustained injuries and died. They
denied their involvement in the accident.
7.

To prove their version, the claimants examined

Shri

Krishan Gopal, PW-1 and Shri Madho Ram, PW-6 who claimed
to be eye witnesses to the said accident. Driver and owner of

FAO 58/1994

Page No.2 of 9

the bus examined the driver of the bus as RW-1 to prove their
version.
8.

Tribunal disbelieved the testimony of Shri Krishan Gopal,

PW-1 for the reason his presence at the time of the accident
was not proved. However, Tribunal believed the testimony of
Madho Ram, PW-6.

Testimony of the driver of the bus was

rejected holding that he was an interested witness.
9.

Relying upon the testimony

of Madho Ram, PW-6,

Tribunal has held that the accident in question was caused due
to rash and negligent act of the driver of the bus bearing
No.UGP-4485.
10.

Aggrieved by the said finding of the Tribunal, appellant

U.P. Roadways have filed the present appeal.
11.

Learned counsel for the appellants contended that

Tribunal erred in relying upon the testimony of Madho Ram,
PW-6 and rejecting the testimony of the driver of the bus.
12.

Testimony of Madho Ram, PW-6 is pitted against the

testimony of driver, RW-1. Word of mouth of an independent
witness is pitted against word of mouth of an interested
witness.
13.

It is a principle of law of evidence that testimony of an

FAO 58/1994

Page No.3 of 9

interested witness needs to be scrutinized more carefully than
that of an independent witness for there is greater possibility of
taint in the testimony of an interested witness.
14.

After appreciating respective testimonies of Madho Ram,

PW-6 and driver, RW-1 and noting above mentioned principle,
Tribunal believed the testimony of Madho Ram, PW-6 and came
to the conclusion that accident in question was caused due to
rash and negligent act of the driver of the bus bearing No.UGP4485.
15.

It is a settled principle of law that an appellate court has

no power to reappreciate the evidence unless the finding of the
trial court is perverse or against the rules of justice.
16.

After analyzing the respective testimonies, Tribunal has

attached more importance to the testimony of Madho Ram,
PW-6. Therefore, the finding of the Tribunal which is arrived at
after appreciation of evidence cannot be faulted with.
17.

Be that as it may, I note a relevant fact which suggests

that the accident in question was caused due to the rash and
negligent act by the driver of the bus bearing no.UGP-4485.
18.

It is not in dispute that after the accident, it was the

driver of the bus who had taken the deceased to the hospital.

FAO 58/1994

Page No.4 of 9

19.

Driver of the bus in his testimony as RW-1 had deposed

that deceased after being struck by the private bus had fallen
behind the bus which he was driving.

If that had been the

case, there was no reason for the driver of the bus to stop the
bus and to take the deceased to the hospital.
20.

Driver had tried to explain his act of taking the deceased

to the hospital by deposing that people who were present at
the time of the accident misunderstood that accident was
caused by him and forced him to stop his bus and to take
deceased to the hospital. If the private bus was also involved
in the accident as deposed by the driver of the

bus, then

people would have stopped the private bus as well.
21.

In my opinion, the fact that driver of the bus had taken

deceased to the hospital leads to an inference that the
accident in question was caused due to the rash and negligent
act of the driver of the bus.
22.

In view of above discussion, I uphold the finding of the

Tribunal that accident in question was caused due to rash and
negligent act of driver of bus bearing no.UGP-4485.
23.

Vide award dated 15.10.1993, learned Tribunal awarded

compensation in sum of Rs.2,01,600/- to the claimants of the

FAO 58/1994

Page No.5 of 9

deceased.
24.

Aggrieved by the amount of compensation awarded by

the learned Tribunal, claimants have filed the cross-objections,
i.e. CM No.779/1994.
25.

Relevant facts necessary for adjudication of said issue are

as follows :(a)

Deceased was aged 43 years as on the date of the

accident.
(b)

He was survived by his wife, 3 minor sons and one minor

daughter.
(c)

He was employed as ASI in Delhi Police and was drawing

a salary of Rs.1878/- per month at the time of the accident.
(d)

Deceased had another 14 years of service left at the time

of his death in the accident.
26.

Taking salary of the deceased as Rs.1878/- per month

and deducting 1/3rd for his personal spending, loss of
dependence has been determined by the Tribunal at Rs.1200/per month. Applying multiplier of 14, total compensation has
been determined at Rs.1200 x 12 x 14 = Rs.2,01,600/-.
27.

A perusal of the award shows that the award is faulty on

2 counts.

FAO 58/1994

Page No.6 of 9

28.

By virtue of recommendations of Vth Pay Commission in

the year 1996, pay scales of the government employees were
revised. It is a reality that pursuant to recommendations of Vth
Pay Commission, salaries of the government employees have
considerably increased. Considering that the deceased was in
a stable government job, Tribunal ought to have considered
the prospects of future increase in the income of the deceased
while determining loss of dependence.
29.

No evidence has been led to show the increments in

salary which were to be earned by the deceased. However,
considering that deceased would have got the benefit of Vth
Pay Commission, I consider it reasonable to assume that salary
of the deceased would have increased by 2.5 times by the time
he would have left gainful employment. Thus, mean average
income of the deceased comes to Rs.4225/- per month.
(Rs.6573 + Rs.1878 ÷ 2 = Rs.4225/-)
30.

Noting the extended family of the deceased and the fact

that all his children were minor, deduction of 1/3rd made by the
Tribunal for the personal spending of the deceased is
excessive.

In so holding, I note the principle, larger is the

family, less is the presumed expenses on self and the second

FAO 58/1994

Page No.7 of 9

principle that lesser is the income, less is the presumed
expenses on self. I consider deduction of ¼ the for the personal
spending of the deceased as appropriate. Thus, loss of
dependence comes to Rs.3,169/- per month.
31.

Considering that deceased was aged 43 years at the time

of the accident, multiplier of 14 is on the higher side. In so
holding, I note the undermentioned judgments:
(i)

U.P.State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Krishna Bala
& Ors., (2006) 6 SCC 249

(ii)

Managing Director, TNSTC Ltd. Vs. K.I.Bindu, (2005) 8
SCC 473.

(iii)

T.N.State Transport Corporation Ltd. Vs. S.Rajapriya,
(2005) 6 SCC236.

(iv)

Municipal Corpn. of Greater Bombay Vs. Laxman Iyer,
(2003) 8 SCC 731.

(v)

State of Haryana Vs. Jasbir Kaur, (2003) 7 SCC 484.

(vi)

New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs. Smt.Kalpana
& Ors., 2007 (2) Scale 227

(vii)
32.

New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Satendar & Ors., JT
2006 (10) SC 234.
On the basis of aforenoted judgments, I consider of

multiplier of 10 as reasonable. Applying multiplier of 10, total
loss of dependence comes to Rs.3,169/- x 12 x 10 =
Rs.3,80,280/-.
33.

Noting that Tribunal has awarded no compensation under

FAO 58/1994

Page No.8 of 9

the head 'non-pecuniary damages' and that accident in
question took place in the year 1987, I award Rs.10,000/under

the

head

'non-pecuniary

damages'.

Thus,

total

compensation comes to Rs.3,90,280/-.
34.

Tribunal

has

awarded

compensation

in

sum

of

Rs.2,01,600/-. Therefore, compensation is further enhanced by
a sum of Rs.1,88,680/-.
35.

CM 779/1994 is accordingly disposed of by enhancing the

compensation by a further sum of Rs.1,88,680/-.
36.

I direct that enhanced compensation shall be paid

together with interest at 6% p.a. from date of claim petition till
date

of

realisation.

I

further

direct

that

enhanced

compensation shall be paid only to the widow of the deceased,
i.e., Vijay Devi, respondent No.1.
37.

FAO No.58/1994 is accordingly dismissed as per para 22

above.
38.

CM No.779/1994 is allowed in terms of paras 35 and 36

above.
39.

No costs.
