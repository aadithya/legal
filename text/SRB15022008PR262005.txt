This petition under the Indian Succession Act, 1925 seeks grant of letters of

Administration concerning the Will of one Shri. Kunwal Kumar Sharma (hereafter “the
testator”), who died on 17th December, 2002. A true copy of the death certificate has been
produced with the petition.

2.

It is averred in the petition that the testator, at the time of his death was residing at

36, Bilston Lane, Willenhall, West Midlands, WV13 2QB, United Kingdom and had
roots in the society. Prior to his demise, the testator executed his last and only will, on
28-8-1991, bequeathing all his movable and immovable properties to the petitioners. It is
averred that the will was attested by PA Lowers and J Evans of Rowland Tildesley &
Harris Solicitors, New Road Willenhall West Midlands WV 13 2AH UK. The testator
had named his wife Ms. Susheel Sharma as sole executrix and trustee of the will;
however, she passed away on 17-1-1999 before the death of the testator. In terms of the
will, if the widow, Ms. Susheel Sharma did not survive the deceased for 21 days after his
death, his properties and estate were to devolve equally in favour of the petitioner, his
children.
3.

The petitioners aver that Probate was granted in respect of the Will, at their request

and on their application, on 15-7-2003 in the High Court of Justice, the District Probate
Registry, at Birmingham, UK. They have annexed a true copy of the Probate dated 15-72003. The petitioners undertake to pay ad-valorem court fees as may be determined in
respect of the property, which is subject matter of the Will; they also undertake to

administer the property of the deceased testator, as described by him in the will.
4.

The petition is accompanied by an application seeking exemption under Section

228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 from the requirement of producing the original
will, since it has been probated; instead the petitioners seek liberty to file the copy of the
will, attested by their solicitor and notary. The petition also encloses the valuation of the
bequest, so far as it concerns the request for administration, i.e UK £ 33474.11 invested
with the State Bank of India, Connaught Place branch, by the testator. The certified copy
of the probate along with attested copy of the will were produced subsequently.
5.

Notice of the petition was issued; notice to the public at large was also published

in the newspaper “The Statesman” in its Overseas Edition, dated 1-10-2005. However, no
response to the notice was received.
6.

The petition has been signed by all the petitioners, i.e children of the testator; it is

also supported by the affidavit of the first petitioner, one of the sons of the deceased
testator. Section 228 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, which is the relevant provision,
reads as follows:
“228. Administration, with copy annexed, of authenticated copy of will proved
abroad- When a will has been proved and deposited in a court of competent
TEST.CAS. 26/2005

3 of 6

jurisdiction situated beyond the limits of the State, whether within or beyond the
limits of India, and a properly authenticated copy of the will is produced, letters of
administration may be granted with a copy of such copy attached.”

7.

The object of Section 228 is to dispense with the need to produce the original will

owing to its deposit in some other court. The order under this provision is not like Section
276; however, it is ancillary to a grant made by a competent court. Before making an
order on such application, the court has to satisfy itself that the copy produced before it
answers the description in Section 228.
8.

In this case, the testator died on 28-8-1991; the original executrix of the will also

died in 1999. The petitioners, as residuary legatees, being children, applied for probate
before the competent court, i.e the High Court of Justice, the District Probate Registry, at
Birmingham; that was granted on 15-7-2003. A copy of the probate, along with a
notarized and attested copy of the will has also been produced. The petitioners seek an
order under Section 228 as far as it concerns the movable property of the deceased
testator located in India, i.e £ 33474.11 invested with the State Bank of India, Connaught
Place branch, New Delhi. The State Bank of India, through its letter dated 5-7-2006
addressed to counsel for the petitioner has confirmed that the value of the deposit is Rs.

29, 74, 486/- (Rupees twenty nine lakhs, seventy four thousand, four hundred and eighty
six only) at the rate of Rs. 84.26 per UK £ Sterling.
9.

From the above discussion it is apparent that the Will of the testator, Shri . Kunwal

Kumar Sharma where he bequeathed the properties, including £ 33474.11 invested with
the State Bank of India, Connaught Place branch, New Delhi to the petitioners, was
subject to the grant of probate by the High Court of Justice, the District Probate Registry,
at Birmingham UK; the probate was granted on 15-7-2003. A certified copy of the
probate, along with attested Notary copy of the will has been placed on record.
10.

In view of the above, I accept the Will executed by late Kunwal Kumar Sharma for

which probate was granted on 15-7-2003 by the High Court of Justice, the District
Probate Registry, at Birmingham, UK. The petitioner are hereby granted letters of
administration in respect of the property, i.e Fixed Deposit FCNB term deposit No.
0139K45734002 bequeathed in the Will subject to valuation, to be obtained by this court
and the petitioners paying the requisite Court fee, on the basis of the valuation of the term
deposit indicated by the State Bank of India, NRI Division, Personal Banking Branch, 11
Sansad Marg, New Delhi, and their furnishing administration bond and surety bond.
