Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat:
1.

These batch of writ petitions involve determination of common questions

of fact and law; they were bunched with consent of counsel for the parties and
heard together. WP 5198-99/05 and WP 4827/05 have been filed by the
electricity companies (hereafter called “DISCOMS”). The other petitions were
preferred by employees who sought severance on the basis of the schemes
formulated by the petitioner DISCOMS.
2.

The question requiring decision by the Court in these proceedings is the

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

2 of 79

liability for payment of pension and terminal benefits on the basis of the Special
Voluntary Separation Scheme (hereafter called “the Scheme”) formulated in
almost identical terms by the DISCOMS, namely, the New Delhi Power Limited
(“NDPL”); BSES Rajdhani Ltd (“BSES”) and BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (“BYPL”)
on 29.11.03 and 18.12.2003. The DISCOMS allege that the liability to pay such
pension under the Schemes, falls on the DVB Employees Terminal Benefit Fund,
a Trust incorporated under provisions of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882(hereafter
referred to as “the Pension Trust”) to the extent it has resources for the purpose
and the liabilities to the extent it is unfunded, are of the Government of National
Capital Territory of Delhi (hereafter called “ the GNCT”).

The claim in the

petitions filed by employees is that the DISCOMS are liable to pay pension and
terminal dues which have not been disbursed to them despite acceptance of their
offers and their voluntary retirement from the service.
3.

The facts necessary to decide these proceedings are as follows. The GNCT

decided to reorganize electricity generation, transmission and distribution in the
territory of Delhi. In the wake of of the policy announcement by GNCT to so
reorganize electricity generation and distribution, employees of the existing
service provider, namely, the Delhi Vidyut Board, a statutory corporation
(hereafter referred to as “DVB”) voiced grave apprehensions about their fate and
the likelihood of their being prejudiced, even thrown out of the employment. The
employees through their representatives contended that in the event of reorganization and introduction of private participation, their accumulated service

& WP(C)13231-40/05

benefits, right to pension and terminal benefits would be jeopardized. To allay
these fears, tripartite agreements were entered into between the DVB, the GNCT
and representatives of the employees through their unions/associations. The
tripartite agreements were executed on 28.10.2000. The relevant terms of the
two tripartite agreements entered into (which are in identical terms between
different sections of the employees,the GNCT and DVB) are extracted below:
"3.
Now therefore in consideration of the promises and
mutual conditions set forth herein, it is agreed that in the event
of reorganization of DVB into two or more corporate entities and
disinvestments of any such entitles of GNCT of Delhi and the
DVB hereby guarantee as follows :

with recognized unions/associations without detriment to the
existing benefits.
(c)

devise its own pension scheme and make arrangements for
funding and disbursing the pensionary benefits.
(6)
The balance of provident fund standing at the credit of the
absorbed employees on the date of their absorption in the new

The Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 (hereinafter “the Act” or the

“DERA”) was enacted on 23.11.2000.
bundling

The process of re-organization/ un-

of DVB commenced after that.

The Act and the policy directives

envisioned creation of successor companies to the DVB as well as clear
demarcation between different activities such as electricity generation,
transmission and distribution. The scheme of the Act was the creation of a parent
body (which came to be known as the Delhi Power Company Limited) and
formation of a company for purposes of generation, another for the purpose of
transmission and corporate entities/ companies (known as DISCOMS, who are
the petitioners in this case) for the purpose of electricity distribution activity. The
task of distribution was demarcated on the basis of territoriality. Bids were
invited from interested parties and the process of finalizing the re-organization &
structure was completed sometime in June, 2002. On 01.07.02, the Rules known
as Delhi Electricity Reform (Transfer Scheme) Rules, 2001 (hereafter called “the
Rules”) were framed and brought into force.
5.

At this stage, it would be necessary to advert to some provisions of the Act

and the Rules. Part-II of the Act deals with the establishment of the Delhi
Electricity Regulatory Commission, its composition, terms and conditions of
service of its members etc; Part-III relates to the powers and functioning of the
Commission and Part-IV relates to powers of the GNCT under the Act. Part-V
deals with reorganization of the electricity industry.

Section 14 enabled the

GNCT to incorporate such number of companies for the purpose of generation,
WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

transmission or distribution of electricity as it deemed appropriate; it also
empowers the GNCT to create a holding company and divide responsibilities of
such corporate entities. Section 15 (1) provides that with effect from the date
when the transfer scheme prepared by the Government to give effect to the
provisions of the Act, came into effect, interest in property rights and liabilities
immediately before the effective (date which belonged to the DVB) vested with
the GNCT; Section 15 (2) enables the GNCT to transfer property or interest in
property rights and liabilities to any company or companies established under
Section 14. Section 15 (6) prescribes several things, that a transfer scheme can
provide for. Section 16 which is material for the purposes of these proceedings
reads as follows:
“Section 16- Provisions relating to personnel-(1) The
Government may, by a transfer scheme, provide for the transfer
of the personnel from the Board to a company or companies
established as the case may be, under Section 14 and distribution
companies ( hereinafter referred to as “transferee company or
companies”) on the vesting of properties, rights and liabilities in
a company or companies established as the case may be, under
Section 14 or the distribution companies.
(2)
Upon such transfers the personnel shall hold office in the
transferee company on terms and conditions that may be
specified in the transfer scheme subject, however, to the
following, namely:(a)
that the terms and conditions of the service applicable to
them in the transferee company shall not in any way, be less
favourable than or inferior to those applicable to them
immediately before the transfer;
(b)
that the personnel shall have continuity of service in all
respects; and
(c)

that the benefits of service accrued before the transfer

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

shall be fully recognized and taken in account for all purposes
including the payment of any and all terminal benefits”.
6.

Section 60 of the Act empowers the GNCT to frame rules to carry out the

purposes of the Act; Section 61 empowers the DERC to frame regulations. The
Rules, to the extent they are material for deciding the controversy involved in this
case, read as follows:

Section 5 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948

11.

It is averred in the petitions by the DISCOMS that a large number of

employees applied under the Schemes and were allowed to sever their
employment. They were granted the ex gratia amounts payable in terms of the
Scheme. It is averred that the terminal and the retiral benefits for the entire
period of service with DVB had to be paid by the Trust. However, the Trust
refused to disburse the terminal benefits or pay pension on the ground that its
liability arose only in the event of the employees reaching the normal age of
WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

superannuation. It is also averred that the Government of NCT, in the event of
any shortfall, was bound both in terms of the tripartite agreements as well as the
Act and the Rules to make good such shortfall. Its refusal to do so, is termed as
illegal.
12.

The DISCOMS have relied upon Section 16 (2) of the Act which stipulates

that transferred employees would hold office in the successor entities subject to
the condition that the service conditions applicable to them would not in any way
be less favourable or inferior to those applicable to them immediately before the
transfer and that the benefits of service accrued before transfer shall be fully
recognized and taken into account for the purpose of including payment of
terminal benefits. Further reliance is placed upon Rule 6 (1). The DISCOMS
allege that the guarantee of continuity of service conditions means that existing
regulations such as Central Civil Service Rules and Fundamental Rules and
Supplementary Rules as also the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 would continue in all
significant aspects even after transfer of the service of such employees. It is
averred that an integral part of the tripartite agreement was creation of a pension
fund by way of a Trust and obligation of the Trust to pay pensionary benefits of
absorbed and transferred employees. It is averred that as a consequence of the
tripartite agreements, the GNCT established a Trust in 2002. The Trust Deed, it
is contended, recognized all obligations regarding payment of retirement benefits
including

provident fund, superannuation, pension, encashment of leave,

gratuity etc. as available to employees who had retired or were to retire from

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

18 of 79

service of DVB on or after the date of restructuring. Such obligations were
assumed by the Trust.

13.

Reliance has been placed upon Rules 6 (7) (8)(9) to say that the Trust and

the GNCT are, at all relevant times, under the obligation to effectuate guarantees
in the tripartite agreements regarding payment of terminal benefits. They have to
ensure that if there is any shortfall in the pension fund, the GNCT, to the extent
such fund is unfunded, will bear the liability.

14.

The DISCOMS allude to a previous proceeding which had been filed by the

employees of the DVB with the advent of the Act and Rules being WP 1864/02,
Ashok Kumar -v- GNCT (hereafter “ Ashok Kumar 's case”) . It is averred that
the GNCT had taken the stand that it and DVB were to discharge pensionary
liabilities of employees of DVB for the duration of their service. This was a clear
acknowledgment of liability of the GNCT towards the employees of DVB to the
extent of their services with the latter.

15.

The DISCOMS further allege that the GNCT had in its affidavit in WP

1864/02 admitted that the sum of Rs. 1329.10 crores was to be deposited towards
pension and terminal benefits and a further guarantee to meet any shortfall in the
pension benefit fund at any stage to ensure that pension and terminal benefits of
transferred employees and existing pensioners were secured. It is, thus, averred

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

19 of 79

that all contingencies including continuity of service of the employees, whose
services were transferred, its inclusion for the purpose of all service benefits
including pension, protection of terms and conditions of service were fully
visualized. Thus, the GNCT and the Trust were aware at all times that they were
liable to pay the terminal benefits and pension to all those eligible in terms of
their contracts of employment.

In these circumstances, the denial of such

liability is attacked by the petitioners.

16.

The BSES and BYPL, in their pleadings states that it paid SVRS benefits to

the tune of Rs. 328.00 crores as ex gratia to 4352 employees opting for it. It is
averred that the second component, namely, the terminal benefits were payable
by the Trust which was requested to disburse the payments by a letter dated
31.12.03. It is averred that the Trust, through a letter dated 16.01.04 stated that
the exact implication and details of liability cast upon the fund due to SVRS was
being worked out by the actuary. The Trust took the position that its Terminal
benefits fund was a Superannuation Fund and that payment to VRS retirees could
not be made out of it. On 29.01.04, the Chairman and Managing Director, Delhi
Power Co. Ltd. who is also Principal Secretary, Department of Power, GNCT
mentioned about inadequacy of the initial corpus of the fund to pay the additional
amounts on account of the SVRS. It is also averred that on 10.02.04 again the
Trust took the position that it was not liable to pay any amounts towards
liabilities arising on account of the VRS opted for by the employees under the

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

20 of 79

schemes formulated by the DISCOMS.

17.

It is alleged that the position of the GNCT and the Trust are arbitrary. The

fund created and managed by the Trust is not just a Superannuation Fund.
Reliance has been placed upon Rule 48-A of the CCS (Pension) Rules and the
circumstance that the Trust had paid terminal benefits and also paid pension to
those who sought and were granted voluntary retirement for the period between
July, 2002 and November-December, 2003 under that provision. It is stated that
apart from pension the withholding of other terminal benefits such as gratuity,
leave encashment etc. on present value basis could not be done as in any case it
would not be higher than what the Trust would have to pay the employee at the
time of normal retirement. It is alleged by the BSES that a sum of Rs. 50 crores
was tendered to the Trust; likewise, the NDPL avers that it tendered the sum of
Rs. 41 crores to the Trust. These amounts were based on an actuarial exercise
commissioned by the DISCOMS to determine additional liability that would
accrue to the fund due to premature release of terminal benefits and pension and
were to cover the carrying cost which was equivalent to additional liability as per
actuarial valuation. These were without prejudice the rights of the DISCOMS.

18.

The DISCOMS allege that the stand put forward by the GNCT and the

Trust are violative of provisions of the Act and the Rules. It is alleged in the
grounds urged in the support of the petitions that the denial of the liability to pay

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

21 of 79

pension and terminal benefits negates the guarantee of continuity and protection
of past service contained in the tripartite agreements as well as the statutory
provisions. It is also pleaded that the GNCT has virtually gone back on its
promise made to this Court about making payment for any shortfall in the
Pension Trust at any time.

19.

The petitioners in WP 1231-40/05 and WP 2340/05, i.e employees of the

DISCOMS claim that as a result of the schemes, a large number of employees;
4312 of the BSES and BYPL and 1728 of the NDPL opted for voluntary
retirement.

They were paid only the ex gratia and special amounts due.

However, the other amounts being encashment of earned leave, gratuity,
commutation of monthly pension etc. remained unpaid. Therefore, a direction to
pay such amounts or in the alternative restore status quo ante as on 31.12.03 and
consequently the employment of the petitioners, is sought for.

An additional

direction to pay back wages to these petitioners has been claimed.

STAND OF THE TRUST

20.

The Trust in its counter affidavit has adverted to the sequence of events

which led to enactment of the DERC Act, framing of the Rules, tripartite
agreements and creation of the DISCOMS. The Trust avers that as on 30.06.02,
the total work force of DVB who were transferred to three DISCOMS, aggregated

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

22 of 79

to 17692. As a consequence of the Schemes formulated by the three DISCOMS,
6210 of such employees (2496 of BSES, 1868 of BYPL, 1846 of NDPL) or a third
of the total strength of the total employees opted for the VSS/ VRS packages.
The Trust claims that the schemes provided heavy inducement and allurement to
separate from employment in the form of ex gratia payments of up to 60 months
salary to those opting for it. Additionally early bird incentives were also held out.
The Trust claims that the benefits offered to the employees as part of the VRS
packages payable by it (i.e. the Trust) were pension, commutation of pension,
gratuity, leave encashment, medical reimbursement and LTC after retirement.
The Trust claims that prior to declaration or publication of the schemes, its
approval or consent was not sought and on the contrary, the DISCOMS ignored
the warnings given to them by it.

21.

It is claimed that according to the Trust Deed, a superannuation fund was

created which is premised on the assumption that the contributed funds with
annual growing contributions would be locked up and would continue to generate
interest till the employee retires on attaining the age of superannuation. The
liability of the Trust is in the event of superannuation of the employee. Therefore,
if the invested securities are encashed ahead of schedule to fulfill VRS/SVRS
demands, a huge loss of income from interest would ensue apart from
unwarranted erosion of the corpus and loss of future contribution. It is alleged
that no mandate for such incursion into Trust fund and investment is permitted

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

23 of 79

in the Deed. The payments in question on account of VSS/SVRS would lead to
unforeseen financial implications such as pre-ponement of pension, preponement of gratuity, pre-ponement of payment of leave encashment, loss of
pension and leave salary contributions which the Trust would otherwise be
entitled to till decision of normal date of superannuation and a substantial loss of
interest on the capital amounts.

22.

It is alleged that additional financial implications for an estimated 10 year

cycle/service period based on present value of money were worked out. The
Trust relies upon Clauses 3 (a)(d), 4, 5 and 6 (h) of the tripartite agreements to
underline its stand that what was visualized or contemplated when the employees
were assured protection were their existing terms and conditions of service and
also protection of accrued benefits.

It was made clear that the benefits or

stipulations in the agreements would not extend to those employed by the new
concerns/ DISCOMS.

Much emphasis has been placed upon the expression

superannuation pension by the Trust. It is averred that a mass premature exodus
of this nature (out of the 18000 employees) was never within the contemplation
of the tripartite agreement or the GNCT when the Trust was set up; consequently
it was not catered to. It is averred that both the documents show a concern to
retain the existing work force, which was a significant factor in the bid and the
implications worked out between the parties at the time of unbundling.

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

24 of 79

23.

The Trust relies upon clause (b) of the Preamble of the Deed which

stipulates that it was set up to establish a Superannuation Fund for the purpose
of providing pension according to the rules to the members on their retirement
after attaining a specific age or on their being incapacitated. It is averred that
retirement has been defined with reference to Rule 35 of CCS (Pension) Rules,
which contemplates superannuation.

It is, therefore, alleged that retirement

other than superannuation such as voluntary retirement, defined under Rule 36
of the CCS Pension Rules and catered to by Rule 48 and 48A are not covered by
the Trust Deed. Therefore, the Trust can not go beyond its charter.
24.

It is further averred that the VSS/superannuation schemes are later

events, after the Transfer Scheme came into force, having no connection with the
terms of the tripartite agreement and were not conditions of service on the date of
transfer or on the date of creation of Trust. They were never intended. The Trust
claims that the GNCT, on advice of its consultants to the reforms process based
upon an actuarial valuation discharged its liability by depositing a one time
payment of Rs. 868 crores, being the balance of Rs. 1329.10 crores of the required
corpus available with the then DVB. It is stated that the actuary in its letter dated
13.08.01 had stated that “ the valuation for 31st March, 2001 is based on data of
31.03.2000 and cannot be used for VRS, mass withdrawal and its investments”.
It is alleged that the DISCOMS had in their plea before the Supreme Court in SLP
No. 1772/03 (Civil Appeal No. 663/2004) stated that the pension Trust is not
funded for VRS/the Schemes. It is claimed that having regard to the objectives of
WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

25 of 79

the VRS schemes which were essentially cost driven and aimed at man power
reduction leading to greater financial efficiency as well as enhanced profitability,
no additional liability can be fastened upon the Trust or the GNCT.

25.

The Trust avers that it holds funds on behalf of about 34,000 members of

whom about 13,000 are pensioners.

Those beneficiaries are placed in a

recognized schedule of payment beneficiaries and would approach the Trust on
the scheduled date of superannuation.

They would be paid terminal benefits

from that date, provided the individual meets the eligibility/ qualifying service
criteria and full contributions on his behalf have been received till the date of
superannuation. These promises would be, however, unfulfilled in the case of
VRS optees and the Trust claims that it cannot pay in violation of those
conditions. It urges that if compelled to withdraw amounts to pay 6500 VSS/
SVRS optees, the survival of the Trust itself would be seriously jeopardized and
besides, immediate loss would be caused.

It would lead to discrimination to

other remaining beneficiaries who have not opted for VRS.
26.

The Trust alleges that in a meeting held in September, 2003 where

representatives of DISCOMS were special invitees, they were clearly informed
that the scheme/SVRS was not covered by the Trust Deed and the Rules. Hence
they are now estopped from claiming that the Trust or the GNCT is liable.

27.

The Trust, in addition has adverted to a decision taken by the

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

26 of 79

Indraprashtha Power Generation Company Ltd, (IPGCL) one of the successors
entities of DVB which decided to promulgate a VRS Scheme. In that context, it is
stated that in the meeting held on 29.09.03 the conclusion was that the pension
Trust Deed and the Rules did not provide for discharging additional liabilities
arising out of the VRS to the new entities. It is averred that this matter was
referred to the GNCT which on 11.11.04 decided that one time payment to VRS
optees of IPGCL

on account of commutation of pension gratuity and leave

encashment will be made by IPGCL and the recurring payment on account of the
residual pension to such VRS optees would be by IPGCL from the date of their
separation from the company till the date of their superannuation or death,
whichever is earlier. This decision was adopted and SVRS optees of IPGCL, it is
stated, received payments on that pattern.
STAND OF THE GNCT
28.

The GNCT in its affidavit, like the Trust has referred to various provisions

of the Act, the Rules and conditions in the tripartite agreement. It has also
referred to Rule 35 of the CCS (Pension) Rules. Its position is that the liability to
pay pension before the date of superannuation, in terms of the schemes does not
fall upon it. It is claimed that the nominee Director of the GNCT, who was in the
Board of the NDPL had agreed with the resolution to publish and implement the
VRS with the caveat that the company should pay the extra cost on account of the
additional liability to the Pension Trust. It is averred by GNCT that at all relevant

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

27 of 79

times, the DISCOMS were aware that liabilities arising out of SVRS for premature
payment of terminal dues would not be borne either by the Trust or by it. The
GNCT has supported the stand of the Trust that the fund does not cover any VRS
Scheme and can cater only to a superannuation pension. According to GNCT, the
Trust was created on the premise that a certain small percentage of employees
would be retiring or dying during a year and was not funded for a mass exodus of
employees through voluntary retirement Scheme. Substantial payment of such
retiral dues, therefore, was never within the contemplation of the Trust. The
GNCT avers that this was communicated to the DISCOMS by it on 31.12.03.

29.

It is averred by the GNCT that there is substantial difference between a

voluntary retirement in terms of Rule 48 and 48 A of the CCS (Pension) Rules
and the SVRS/ VSS Schemes introduced by the DISCOMS.

The statutory

schemes, it is alleged condition cessation of service upon the completion of a
certain tenure of service without an element of inducement.

However, the

schemes of DISCOMS here were applicable to employees with less than 20 years
of service or even below 50 years of age with massive inducement of ex gratia
payment of up to 60 months pay. It is alleged that if liability is cast upon the
Government in such cases where employees leave their services on the basis of
allurement/inducement, huge funds would be lost from the public exchequer. It
is alleged that the claim of the petitioners cannot be encouraged as that would
cause danger to public funds.

The GNCT further states that adequacy or

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

28 of 79

otherwise of pension funds is not relevant – what is important is that such
schemes are not and were never within the contemplation when the Trust was
established and it does not cater to them. The GNCT too has relied upon the
actuarial valuation communicated to it on 13.08.01 and further, like the Trust
states that the profit or efficiency oriented objective favoring the DISCOMS
cannot be the basis for saddling additional liability on the GNCT or endangering
other members of the Trust who would be entitled to the full value of their
benefits.

30.

The GNCT avers that drastic reduction of man power through the

VRS/SVRS mode is contrary to the intent of the tripartite agreement and the
transfer scheme. Both, the agreement and the Scheme disclose the intention to
retain the work force, as a cost factor in the bid. The promise of any premature
and unscheduled payment of terminal dues extended to the section of employees,
it is averred, does not come from the pension Trust. The GNCT further states
that as according to the declaration of DISCOM in their annual revenue
retirement (ARR) filed before the DERC, an estimated 75 per cent of their earlier
DVB employees were to opt for voluntary retirement. If the scheme of DISCOMS
were to be accepted and the Trust made liable, the consequent result would be
exploitation of 3/4th of the fund of the employees and payment of terminal
benefits by the GNCT/Trust which would bear the entire cost of such exercise. If
such intention were to be countenanced, the GNCT itself could have performed it
WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

and then transferred the company for a higher bid.

Submissions of DISCOMS

31.

Mr. A.S.Chandhiok, learned senior counsel appeared on behalf of the

BSES and BYPL; Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel appeared on behalf of
NDPL. Mr. Chandhiok contended that the refusal of the GNCT to honour its
obligations to fund the pension Trust to the extent of the shortfall, on account of
SVRS 2003 was arbitrary. He relied on Section 16, particularly Section 16(2)(b)
and contended that the provision assured statutory continuity of service in all
respects. This was further reinforced by Rule 6(6) and (7) as well as clauses
3(1)(d) and 3(c) of Tripartite Agreement, which had to be honoured in terms of
the Rules. Counsel submitted that Rule 6(9) constitutes acknowledgment of
financial benefits which were not thought out or contemplated and that about the
likelihood of some part of it being unfunded. Therefore, the Trust and the GNCT
could not shrug off their responsibility in making payments towards terminal
benefits.

32.

It was contended that the internal correspondence between the DISCOMS,

particularly BSES and the Trust and DPCL showed that the scheme was
approved.

Reliance was placed upon the letter of Shri Jagdish Sagar dated

20.9.2003 in this regard.

The Board resolutions by which the SVRS were

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

30 of 79

approved had been agreed to by the nominee directors of the GNCT. Counsel
also contended that BSES and BYPL had by letters dated 19.12.2003 sought
clarifications from the Trust as to whether as per the schemes, extra 5 years
weightage could be given, in accordance with Rule 48-B of the CCS pension
Rules. The Trust had replied on 29.12.2003, in the affirmative. In the light of
these facts the volte face by the Trust and the GNCT that they were not liable, was
contrary to their understanding. In any case both were estopped from raising
such contention.

33.

It was contended that huge amounts of Rs. 326 crores were paid by the

BSES in furtherance of the Scheme. It was contended that on an application of
Rules 37A(11A) and 48-A of the CCS Pension Rules, the employees of DISCOMS
who opted for voluntary retirement were undeniably entitled to terminal benefits
and pension. These were assured and guaranteed by the GNCT in the Tripartite
Agreements and given statutory cover under the Rules, particularly Rule 6(9).
Therefore, it was not open for the Trust or the GNCT to contend that their
liabilities were outside the scope of the provision or were not visualized. Learned
counsel relied on a condition in para 3 (b) of the Tripartite Agreement to say that
the GNCT had, in the most categorical terms, held out the assurance of protecting
conditions and service rules; they were even guaranteed. These included the
conditions of service such as Rule 48-A which enabled employees

to retire

voluntarily.

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

31 of 79

34.

Learned counsel contended that as long as there was no provision in the

Act or the Rules prohibiting the extension of benefits to such class of employees
who opted for voluntary retirement, the GNCT much less the Trust could not
deny the liability.

35.

Learned counsel next contended that the GNCT is bound by its assertion

contained in the affidavit filed before this Court in Ashok Kumar's case. It was
submitted that the GNCT guaranteed to meet any shortfall in the Trust at any
stage to ensure that

pensionary and terminal benefits of erstwhile DVB

employees are secured after the transfer. In these circumstances the respondents
could not deny their liability.

36.

Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel contended that as a matter of law

between the two of them i.e. the Trust and the GNCT, were liable to pay terminal
benefits as well as pension to all eligible employees including those opting under
the Schemes. It was submitted that retirement is cessation of service. Rule 48-A
of the Pension Rules, which was applicable to the DVB and its employees,
outlined the conditions upon the fulfillment of which employees could seek
voluntary retirement. Once those conditions are fulfilled and the options were
exercised, the cessation of service took place.

In such an eventuality the

individual acquired an indefeasible right to be paid the terminal benefits and

pension.

37.

Learned counsel contended that the liability of an employer to pay the

retiral or terminal benefits arises either through contract or by operation of law.
The erstwhile DVB could not have contended that no employee was entitled to
seek voluntary retirement.

On the face of this the statutory liability of the

erstwhile DVB which was in the clearest terms cast upon the Trust, which is a
mechanism to ensure payments, cannot be whittled down by the latter, with an
argument that only superannuation pension is payable by it or that the Trust
Deed does not envision payment of any terminal benefits except superannuation
pension. Such a construction would be impermissible and in fact it would render
the Tripartite Agreements as well as statutory provisions contained in Section 16
on the one hand and protection of existing service conditions on the other,
entirely illusory.

38.

Learned counsel contended that the position advanced in these

proceedings by the Trust and GNCT amounts to virtually forfeiting the rights of
the employees to pension in spite of a clear-cut liability of the respondents in that
regard. Having not contested or disputed the likelihood of the VSS Scheme and
even clarified about the extra weightage that can be given to optees under the
VSS, on an application of Rule 48-B of the Pension Rules, the respondents cannot
now deny their liability.

& WP(C)13231-40/05

39.

Learned counsel contended that all the VRS optees of NDPL except two

qualified for retiral and terminal benefits under the Pension Rules, in terms of
Rule 48-A, having worked for at least 20 years. The VSS Scheme in question was
designed to provide a comprehensive package in lieu of existing rules to the
employees who accepted the voluntary severance or voluntary retirement. In
such a situation it could have been possible to create packages which excluded
benefits that would have arisen under the Rules. However, the Scheme of the
DISCOMS were not of that category. They expressly recognize the right of the
employee to receive such retiral benefits under the Rules.
40.

Learned counsel relied upon the decisions reported as UCO Bank and

others Vs. Sanwar Mal 2004 (4) SCC 412 ; Jaspal Singh Vs. Sumitra Mahajan
(Smt.) & Anr. 2004 (4) SCC 522 and Reserve Bank of India & Anr. Vs. CECIL
Dennis Soloman & Ors. 2004 (9) SCC 461 in support of the submission that
although the fact of resignation and voluntary retirement is cessation of service
on account of the volition exercised by the employee, yet they have different
repercussions. One fundamental distinction is that resignation can be tendered at
any time whereas voluntary retirement can be sought for after rendering the
prescribed period of qualifying service. The second distinction is that in the case
of voluntary retirement, there is a nexus between such retirement and the retiral
benefits. Reliance was also placed upon the decision reported as Bank of Baroda
Vs. Rajender Pal Soni (1996) 7 SCC 696 where the Court had held that the

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

34 of 79

liability in the event of amalgamation of a private bank with another transferee
bank was that of the transferor bank.

41.

It is next contended that the correspondence on record was court leads to

inference with the principle the GNCT accepted that severance of service of
employees would lead to a fresh liability of payment of pension and retiral
benefits and a converse right to such employees.

In the face of such an

admission, it is not open having regard to provisions of the Act and Rules,
particularly Rule 6(9) to escape payment of liability.

42.

Learned counsel contended that the stand of the respondents that VRS was

not designed to meet the liabilities is undeniable because:
i)A fair reading (of the provisions) shows that the obligation of Govt
was to fund for superannuation as well as voluntary retirement the expression voluntary retirement would need to be construed in
harmony with Rule 48 A.
ii)Even if the VSS is a scheme introduced by NDPL, the Government
is under an obligation to create an appropriate fund to meet its
liability towards retiral benefits of VRS Optees under Rule 48 A
(NDPL having discharged its part of the liability under the VRS). In
this context the stand taken by the Delhi Government and the
Judgment of this Hon'ble court in Ashok Kumar case are conclusive
of the matter.
iii)Rule 37A (25) and (26) are directly relevant in this context. A
plain reading of the Rules suggests that one of the mandatory
safeguards that the government has to provide for on
privatization/disinvestment is the voluntary retirement benefits.

43.

It was urged that in any disinvestment proposal down-sizing by “golden

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

35 of 79

hand shakes” is a well known rule. Most cases of disinvestment involve, inter
alia, reorganization of the work force. Rule 37A (25) and (26) assume great
importance - by commanding that voluntary retirement benefits be protected.
They ensure that employees who want to disassociate themselves from the
privatized entity are assured of voluntary retirement benefits and these are not
taken away as a consequence of disinvestment.

44.

Mr. Salve submitted that the NDPL as a matter of law, is not obliged to

bear any additional burden for payment of retiral benefits to those opting for
VRS. He made a “with prejudice” offer, in writing, on the basis of instructions,
that if the respondents agree to pay the pension

and other retiral benefits

forthwith to the employees(which would include reimbursement to NDPL of what
was wrongfully withheld and which had to be paid by NDPL in an appropriate
manner with carrying cost) then the petitioner would be agreeable to an actuarial
calculation of the net incremental liability (in lumpsum) of the fund.

Such

calculation could be conducted by a mutually agreed actuary to determine the
difference between the funding requirement of the Trust as on the date of VSS
(01.01.2004) to service the retiral benefits of the 1798 VRS Optees. The
calculation would be assuming that the VSS Optees had retired on
superannuation age in the normal course, as against retirement on the date of
VSS. This net incremental liability cast on the Trust as worked out could be
funded by the petitioner (NDPL) without any right to seek recompense.

Submissions on behalf of the GNCT

45.

Mr. A.M.Singhvi, learned Senior counsel for the GNCT submitted that a

combined reading of the Tripartite Agreements, Section 16 Rule 6 and the Trust
Deed would clarify that what was contemplated towards the pension liability of
the DVB employees whose service were transferred to the DISCOMS were
superannuation pension and not pensionary liability arising on account of
operation of Rule 48-A or any liability on account of Special Separation
Schemes/Voluntary Retirement Schemes. learned counsel relied upon the
clarifications given by the consultant to the Actuary namely S .B. I. Capital
Markets Ltd that the valuation for creation of the fund to be administered by the
Trust, on 31.3.2001 was based on data of 31.3.2000 and could not be used for
VRS, mass withdrawal and disinvested. It was submitted that reliance placed
upon the so-called approvals by the nominee directors of GNCT to the schemes
were misplaced. The nominee directors had in each case expressly recorded that
the DISCOMS would have to pay the extra cost to be borne by the Trust on this
account.

46.

Learned counsel contended that the GNCT had by its letter dated

31.12.2003 clearly warned DISCOMS against launching the scheme and clarified
those signalling that it could not be saddled with liability. Learned senior counsel

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

37 of 79

contended that the argument about entitlement to seek voluntary retirement in
terms of Rule 48-A was misplaced. He submitted that during the period between
1.7.2002 and 31.12.2003 i.e .post DVB period after the services of employees was
transferred, only a negligible percentage of employees namely 0.65 % working in
the DISCOMS had applied and secured voluntary retirement under Rule 48-A.
However, the schemes were entirely different; they lowered the threshold
eligibility to 10 years qualifying service or employment of an individual of 40
years age. Besides this, the schemes were designed to encourage mass cessation of
service and the record bore out this basic premise, as one third of the totality of
the employees in the DISCOMS sought severance. The liability to pay terminal
and pension benefits on the basis of such unilateral schemes could not be thrust
upon the Trust or even the GNCT. In this context it was contended that what was
within the contemplation of parties when Rule 6(9) was framed was a residual
unforeseen exigency but not a unilateral decision resulting in huge liability.

47.

Learned counsel contended that a reading of Rule 35, CCS Pension Rules

(which finds mention in the Trust Deed) qualifies that the liability assumed by
the Trust and also under the Rules was only superannuation pension. He relied
upon the letter written by Shri Jagdish Sagar,

the nominee of GNCT and

submitted that Shri Sagar had also mentioned that the additional contribution
from the new entities would have to be calculated and paid to the Trust. In
addition he had clearly said that the principles adopted for VRS of IPGCL should

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

38 of 79

be applied to NDPL.

48.

Learned counsel submitted that the CCS Pension Rules cannot ipso faco be

applied as a matter of law. They were not part of the conditions of service of
erstwhile DVB employees. He relied upon the decision of this court in Ashok
Kumar's case (supra) to say that the Division Bench had ruled that Rule 37-A of
those Rules was inapplicable.

Submissions of the Trust

49.

Mr. Sumeet Pushkarna submitted that the Trust cannot go beyond its

charter in the Deed. Such a transgression would invite penal action. Learned
counsel contended that in the application for directions filed by the DISCOMS
before the Supreme Court, there was a clear admission that the Trust had not
been funded for the SVRS. On the face of these, the DISCOMS are estopped from
raising any contention against the Trust fund. It was submitted that the Division
Bench

in Ashok Kumar's case had rejected the claim for release of pro rata

pension by holding that Rule 37-A of the Pension Rules could not be applied.
Therefore, a claim for piecemeal pre-superannuation relief i.e. payment of
terminal benefits before the event of the employees attaining the age of
superannuation cannot be entertained except in the case of death or
incapacitation.

Learned counsel contended that the relevant provisions are

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

39 of 79

Clause A(a)(xxvi) of the Preamble to the Trust Deed; Clause (xxvi) of the Rules
defining retirement amounting as superannuation. Rule 35 of the CCS Pension Rules
and Clauses 6.7 and 6.8 of Part of the Rules of the Trust defining forfeiture were relevant.

Put

together, these establish that the liability of the Trust for payment of terminal
benefits would arise in each case where the employee attains the age of
superannuation and not before that. It was also submitted that none of the other
documents or provisions namely the Tripartite Agreement, the Act or the Rules
cast any right or create any corresponding liability to pay retirement benefits to
any transferred employee before his normal date of retirement. Counsel relied
on Clause 3(d)(5) and 3(h) of the Tripartite Agreement to say that the GNCT had
a duty to fund only superannuation, incapacitation and death liability and that for
all other liabilities the DISCOMS were liable.

50.

Learned counsel contended that the schemes of the DISCOMS cannot,

under any circumstances, be compared with any form of statutory retirement
provisions enabling premature exit from service. It was submitted that the object
of the schemes was entirely profit oriented, to streamline

the DISCOM'S

functioning. It was founded on the desire to change the work force profile and
not to rationalise it.

Learned counsel contended that if an employer by a

contractual arrangement with a section of his employees secured advantages and
economies by promising such employees attractions or advantages which would
be additionally payable over and above what is their right in terms of the contract

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

40 of 79

of employment, the liabilities on such account and consequences arising from it
cannot be fastened on the Trust. He relied upon the judgments of the Supreme
Court reported as HEC Voluntary Retd. Employees Welfare Society & Anr. Vs.
Heavy Engineering Corpn. Ltd. & Ors. 2006(3) SCC 708 and Hindustan
Machines Tools Ltd. Vs. M.S.Kang/P.N.Kashyap 1997 11 SCC 186 that when,
pursuant to an offer held out by a VRS an employee opts, he makes an offer,
which if accepted gives rise to a contract. He cannot in such an event claim
something over and above the package offered by the employer. In the present
case the employees were induced to seek retirement for the benefit of the
DISCOMS who paid substantial ex gratia payment. That cannot be an occasion
to prepone the liability of the Trust to pay terminal benefits in the event of
superannuation. The decision in Hindustan Machines Tools Ltd.'s case (supra)
was relied upon to submit that there is intelligible differentia between those who
retire in the normal course and others who opt to retire pursuant to VRS.

51.

Learned counsel also placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme

Court reported as A.K.Bindal & Anr. Vs. U.O.India & Ors. AIR 2003 SC 2189. Mr.
Pushkarna next relied upon the judgment of this court in O.P.Gupta Vs. Delhi
Vidyut Board & Anr. (85) 2000 DLT 779 to say that there is no automatic
applicability of the service conditions of Central Government employees to
erstwhile DVB employees whose services were transferred to the DISCOMS. He
placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court reported as Committee of

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

41 of 79

Management of Pachaiyappoa Trust Vs. Official Trustee of Madras JT 1993 [6]
SC 389 to contend that the upholding of the contentions of the petitioners would
amount to re-writing the Trust Deed. This submission was in the context that the
Trust has to cater to the needs of a service class whose rights can be prejudiced by
unwarranted incursions into the fund by the significant withdrawals which were
never within the contemplation of any one at the time of its formation.

52.

Counsel contended that the Trust owes an obligation towards those

employees who did not opt for VRS and has to protect their interest since the
contributions received on their behalf would be irretrievably jeopardised if its
liability to pay terminal benefits and pension of VRS optees is upheld. Learned
counsel submitted that the Aggregate Revenue Requirement (ARR) filed by
DISCOMS before the DERC for the relevant years establish that the objective of
the schemes were to provide inducement to separate from employment before
the actual date of superannuation, voluntarily. It was further contended that
both the DISCOMS were aware of the additional expenses on account of VSS and
had declared its funding.

In these circumstances, they were estopped from

contending that pension or retiral benefit were payable on any time before the
superannuation of their employees, by the Trust. That liability had to be borne by
them till the date of normal superannuation of the VRS optees.

53.

Before proceeding to consider the rival submissions, it would be necessary

to extract the relevant provisions of the Trust Deed and the pension rules. As
noticed earlier, the Trust Deed was executed on 26.03.02.

Part (b) of the

preamble indicates that the Government of NCT decided to establish a
superannuation fund for the benefit of those entitled to pension in accordance
with the pension scheme of DVB, as detailed in the rules of the fund (annexed to
the Trust Deed which are referred to hereafter as the “Trust Rules”). Clause (3)
of the Deed enjoins the Trustees to pay pension and other terminal benefits in
accordance with the Trust Rules. The Trust Rules, inter alia, define actual
service by referring to Rule 30 of the CCS (Pension) Rules; the duration of
pension payable, by Clause 2 (x) is provided by Rule 54 (6) of the CCS (Pension)
Rules; “eligible members” under Clause 2 (xi) is defined as those covered by the
CCS (Pension) Rules. The term “qualifying service” has been defined as what is
contained in Rule 3 (q) of the CCS (Pension) Rules. The expression “ retirement”
and “normal retirement date” have been defined as follows:
“(xxvi) “RETIREMENT” as defined under Rule 35 Central Civil
Services (Pension) Rules, 1972, as amended from time to time.
(xxvii) “NORMAL RETIREMENT DATE” shall mean the date of
retirement as
defined in Fundamental Rules, 1956.

54.

Rule 4 deals with contributions to the fund by the corporation and the

members. It refers to the fund being a superannuation fund. Rule 4 (b) (c)
empowers the Trustees with the authority to fix additional contribution amounts
to be paid by the “new entity” i.e. DISCOM S and other successors, from time to
WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05

time in consultation with the Government. Part V of the Trust Rules outlines the
benefits. Rule 6.1 provides that a member, on superannuation would be entitled
to pension and other terminal benefits as available to the existing employees on
the retirement commencing from the month following superannuation, as per the
Fundamental Rules.

Rule 6.2 states that to qualify for benefit on

superannuation, employees should have completed a minimum reckonable
service as defined by Rule 14 of the CCS (Pension) Rules. The relevant parts of
Rule 6 are extracted below:
“6.1. A member on superannuation will be entitled to
pension and other terminal benefits as available to the
existing employees on the retirement commencing from
the month following superannuation as per
Fundamental Rules, 1956 as amended from time to

A member would be entitled to pension life time.

6.6. MINIMUM PENSION: In no case pension shall be

6.7. On separation from service of a member by his
resignation before completion of the qualifying service

Rules, 1972, shall be dealt with as per Rule 26 of Central
Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 and any other
applicable Rule as amended from time to time.
6.8. On separation of a member who is

per Rule 24 of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules,
1972 and any other applicable Rule as amended from

55.

From the above, it is apparent that the concepts such as the retirement,

terminal benefits, qualifying service and superannuation have been borrowed
from the CCS (Pension) Rules. Indeed the Trust's rules have incorporated those
provisions. The relevant provisions of CCS (Pension) Rules are extracted below:

Questions for decision by the Court
56. The following questions arise for decision by the Court in these proceedings:
(1) Whether the liability of the respondents to pay or ensure payment of
terminal dues is confined to cases of superannuation, death or
incapacitation of employees of the DISCOMS or it extends to cases of
voluntary retirement;
(2)Nature of the schemes formulated b y the DISCOMS and the obligation
to pay pension and terminal benefits;
(3) Relief, if any.

Regarding Question No. 1

57.

This question i.e. nature of liability of the respondents and whether it is

confined to the incidence of superannuation or retirement in the normal course
of service of the transferred employees has to be first decided in view of extensive
contentions by the parties made in the court. The DISCOMS allege that liability
to pay terminal benefits/pension to the VRS optees is as a matter of right in view
of the Rule 48-A of the CCS Pension Rules coupled with the mandate of Section
16 of the Act and Rule 6 (framed under the Act) as well as provisions of the
tripartite agreements. On the contrary, the Trust and the GNCT contend that the
arrangement made at the time of un-bundling and the creation of the Trust

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

48 of 79

obliged only satisfaction of the liability upon attainment of superannuation, of
existing employees of the erstwhile DVB and not any under any other
circumstances.

58.

Superannuation, voluntary retirement and resignation no doubt bring

about cessation of services of employees. Yet, there are certain salient features
with significant nuances that distinguish each of these concepts.

It is

undoubtedly correct that resignation and voluntary retirement are pursuant to
choice exercised by the employee. On the other hand, superannuation occurs on
the happening of a certain event foreseen by the parties to the contract of the
employment i.e. attainment of a specified age. Although in the broadest sense the
three methods of severing the employer-employee relationship have the same
effect, (as far as the contract of the employment is concerned), the legal effect, so
to say, of each of these would vary having regard to the terms and conditions or
the applicable rules which govern the employment. Ordinarily the event of
resignation does not entitle the employee to terminal benefits like pension.
Resignation normally entails forfeiture of past service- as the universal
assumption is that the employee wishes to terminate his contract to secure
another or better employment. Therefore, specific rules such as Rule 26 of the
CCS Pension Rules expressly provide for forfeiture of service. In the case of
voluntary retirement, the event is subject to the employee fulfilling the qualifying
conditions i.e. a defined quantum of service and acceptance of his request by the

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

49 of 79

employer. Such defined quantum of service signifies, not only the pre-condition
for an application (to voluntarily retire) but also a corresponding obligation of the
employer to ensure payment of terminal benefits and/or pension, having regard
to the liability cast

under the rules for the past service of the employee.

Therefore, the volition or choice exercised by the employee in the case of
voluntary retirement does not entail forfeiture of past or accrued benefits for the
purpose of payment of accrued benefit unlike resignation. The third category of
severance namely superannuation on the other hand does not require exercise of
choice by either party. It is the happening of an event foreseen in the contract of
employment or service rules, namely, attainment of a particular age, by the
employee

In this case too the employee is entitled to payment of terminal

benefits and/or pension.

In a decision by a Division Bench of this Court i.e. Ashwani Kumar vs.

Oriental Bank of Commerce, 103 (2003) DLT 738 it was held that the resignation
of an employee would not entail forfeiture of his past service and that there is, in
fact, no distinction between such method of ending a contract of employment and
voluntary retirement. However, that view was overruled in the judgment of the
Supreme Court reported as UCO Bank vs. Sanwar Mal 2004 (4) SCC 412. In
that decision as well as in the other judgment noticed above i.e. Cecil Dennis
Soloman's case and HHEC Retired Employees Welfare Society's case (supra) the
Supreme

Court

noticed

retirement

and

resignation.

In

CECIL Dennis Soloman's

case the Court held that a

fundamental distinction between the two is that retiral benefits are denied in case
of resignation whereas they are admissible in the case of voluntary retirement.

60.

In said two decisions of the Supreme court, namely, HHEC Retired

Employees Welfare Society's case and

Cecil Dennis Soloman's case, the court

held that voluntary retirement is a condition of service created by statutory
provision. In the absence of any specific statutory rules, voluntary retirement
does not bring about superannuation. This view had also been taken earlier in
the case of Union of India Vs. Rakesh Kumar, 2001(4) SCC 309.

61.

The facts of the present case disclose that even before the process of un-

bundling and re-organisation were finalized, the DVB, GNCT and employees of
the erstwhile DVB entered into a tripartite agreement. This was occasioned by
the anxiety of the employees that the process of re-organisation might lead to
unforeseen and un-settling consequences upsetting their livelihood and
extinction or whittling down of their accrued benefits. The agreements were
aimed at assuring that the right to pension and the right to employment, right to
accrued benefits and the right to terminal benefits would not be disturbed. The
tenor of the agreements—both which were executed on the same date and
contained identical terms—lend support to the conclusion that they were meant
as a general assurance by the then public employer (DVB) backed by a guarantee

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

51 of 79

of the GNCT, that the unbundling process would be painless to the employees.
Thus, the agreements have to be seen as assuring and guaranteeing generally in
regard to the terms and conditions of service, with the object of securing and
protecting them and consequently, have to be construed in a broad and liberal
manner.

62.

Clause 3(b) ( of the Agreements) guarantee that existing terms and

conditions of service (of the erstwhile DVB employees) would be continued and
that modifications would be only by mutual negotiations, without detriment to
existing benefits. Clause 3(d) obliged the GNCT to create a pension fund by a
Trust and pensionary benefits of absorbed employees to be paid out of such
pension fund. Clause 3(d) (1) to (4) use the expression “pensionary liability”.
However, clause 3(d)(5) provided that arrangements under the agreement would
be applicable to existing pensionary benefits and to existing employees on their
superannuation in the successor bodies/new entities. It further stated that such
arrangements would not apply to employees directly recruited by the new
entities. Clause 3(e) guarantees continuation of existing welfare measures like
compassionate appointment, medical reimbursement etc.; Clause 3(f) guarantees
that benefits of services rendered by employees in the DVB on the date of restructuring would be protected and given full effect to.

63.

Section 16 (2) of the Act provides that the transferred personnel of the

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

52 of 79

erstwhile DVB would hold office in the DISCOMS and other successor companies
inter alia on the same terms and conditions applicable to them which would not
be in any way less favourable or inferior to those applicable to them immediately
before the transfer. Section 16(2)(c) protects benefits of service accrued before
the transfer for all purposes including payment of any and all terminal benefits.
Rules 6(9) which is most material for the purpose of these proceedings, casts
statutory obligations in terms of tripartite agreement. It mandates the GNCT to
make “appropriate arrangement” as provided in the tripartite agreement vis-a-vis
funding of the terminal benefits to the extent it is unfunded on the date of
transfer from the board. A transitory arrangement by which TRANSCO was to
pay amounts falling due to existing pensioners was also created.

"Existing

pensioner" was defined in these provisions. The expression "Terminal benefit"
has been defined in clause 6(9)(b) to include gratuity, pension, dearness
allowance and other terminal benefits to the personnel and existing pensioners.

64.

The Trust, which was formed on 28.3.2002 framed its rules. The tenor of

those rules no doubt appear to be restrictive. This is borne out by reference to
definition of retirement; retirement date and provisions of Part V all of which
point to payment of superannuation pension, indicated by Rule 35 of the CCS
Pension Rules. That means retirement of the employee on his attaining the age of
retirement, specified in the rules.

65.

A textual analysis of provisions of the Trust and the Tripartite agreements

undoubtedly lend support to the contention by the Trust and the GNCT that their
liability is restricted to payment of terminal benefits, only of those employees
who superannuate from their services in the normal course. Attractive though
this solution may appear to be, such a simplistic approach should be avoided by
the Court which is bound to explore the larger context in which the tripartite
agreement was entered into and the apprehension which it sought to allay. As
noticed earlier, the first in the entire series of documents and statutory
instruments (apart from the Act), were the tripartite agreements.

The

background in which they were entered into was the justifiable apprehension
voiced by employees of the then DVB about the uncertain fate of their past service
and the future prospects of their employment. The then public employer ( DVB)
and GNCT sought to allay these concerns and comprehensively dealt with all
aspects of employment, guaranteeing existing terms and conditions of service and
the arrangements for payment of terminal benefits on the basis of past service.
The tripartite agreements, therefore, are to be viewed not as an endeavour to
restrict benefits but as a guarantee and assurance of continuity held out to the
employees.

The agreements, except clause 3(d)(5)

nowhere talk of

superannuation—they emphasise upon continuity of existing service conditions
and assurance to pay pensionary benefits and discharge of pensionary liability.
Clause 3(b) assures and guarantees that existing terms and conditions of service
of all the employees would be protected.

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

54 of 79

66.

The agreements in effect were implemented by Section 16(2) which

protected all terms and conditions of service applicable to existing employees,
their continuity of service and recognition of the benefits of their service. The
relevant rule namely Rule 6 takes the guarantee further and provides for
protection of all conditions of service.

Rule 6(9) obliged GNCT to make

appropriate arrangements. It expressly referred to the tripartite agreement, in
regard to the funding of the terminal benefits. Terminal benefits are also defined
to include gratuity, pension, dearness allowances and other terminal benefits to
personnel and existing pensioners.

67.

In the above backdrop the question which has to be further decided is

whether the right to seek voluntary retirement under the CCS Pension Rules and
claim pension, was in any manner disturbed or curtailed. The submissions of the
DISCOMS here were that the schemes formulated by them and opted for by their
employees were voluntary retirement under existing rules and that such rights of
employees could not be defeated. On the contrary, the argument of the Trust and
the GNCT here was that the CCS Pension Rules did not apply and that in any
event the Trust was liable only to pay those who superannuated in the normal
course.

68.

As discussed in the preceding paragraph, the right to apply for a voluntary

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

55 of 79

retirement and the entitlement to pension in the eventuality of such severance is
not an implied condition of service unlike resignation but has to be expressly
provided for. It would, therefore, be necessary to examine firstly whether the
Pension Rules were applicable and further whether the right to apply for
voluntary retirement under Rule 48-A existed as a condition of service for the
employees of DVB.

69.

The Division Bench of this court in Ashok Kumar vs. GNCT of Delhi (in

CWP 1864/2002,decided on 16th September, 2002) had to decide whether Rule
37 of the CCS Pension Rules applied to the employees of the erstwhile DVB. That
petition too was filed in the wake of the un-bundling process of DVB. The court
noticed, in para 11 of the judgment that the predecessor of the DVB i.e. DESU was
a department of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The Corporation (MCD) had
framed Regulations in 1973 granting benefits to employees of DESU.
Subsequently, in 1977 the DESU (DMC) Service Regulations were approved.
They stipulated that service rules applicable to Government Servants would also
apply to DESU employees. Regulation 4 indicated that unless provided in the Act
or the Regulation, the rules applicable to Government Servants in the service of
the Central Government, were to, so far as may be, regulate the service of
Municipal employees except in regard to the matters relating to provident fund.
The Division Bench noticed that upon incorporation of the DVB the assets and
liabilities of the DESU and its undertaking devolved on it. The DVB later issued a
WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

56 of 79

circular protecting existing service conditions and expressly mandating
“there must be no retrenchment or change in service conditions to
the detriment of the staff. Pension and all terminal benefits must be
safeguarded by the Delhi Government.”

70.

The Division Bench after considering the assurances held out by the DVB

and analysing the provisions of Section 16, rules and the tripartite agreement,
held that Rule 37 of the Pension Rules could not be applied as there was no
question of deemed retirement. The Court held that Rule 37 could apply where
by legal fiction a person superannuated but not otherwise. Accordingly where
there was no retirement in terms of legal fiction, the question of payment of prorata pension did not arise. As far as the decision of the court in O.P Gupta's case
is concerned, the contention raised was that in terms of Rule 9 of the CCS
Pension Rules, the authority and jurisdiction to effect a cut in pension was with
the President of India and not DVB. This was negatived; the court held that
Pension Rules are not automatically applicable to employees of DVB and they
were adopted mutatis mutandis. The President of India is not the employer of
the employees of DVB nor were the employees holders of civil posts. They were
not governed by Articles 309 of the Constitution of India. DVB was held to be a
body constituted and being an autonomous body, required to act according to its
own rules etc. As the Board of the DVB was the supreme authority, it was entitled
to pass necessary orders under Rule 9 of CCS Pension Rules in the case of
employees of DVB. The court did not rule out applicability of the CCS Pension
WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

57 of 79

Rules, but held them to be applicable, in so far as exercise of powers under Rule 9
were concerned.
71.

There is, in my opinion, another detail which lends support to the view

that the right to apply under Rule 48-A was considered an integral part of the
service conditions of the erstwhile DVB employees. In its letter of 29-12-2003,
the Trust clarified that the benefit of five years' weightage could be given to those
retiring, in terms of Rule 48-B of the CCS Pension Rules. That rule applies to
employees who seek and are permitted to retire under Rule 48-A.
72.

The above analysis would show that at material times when the functions

of the erstwhile DVB were carried out by its predecessor in interest, i.e DESU,
Regulations had been framed which extended the terms and conditions of service
applicable to the Government Servants. Those conditions were protected and
they became part of the conditions of service of employees of DESU upon its
creation. No material has been brought to the notice of the court by way of a
conditional circular or resolution, restricting applicability of the CCS Pension
Rules to exclude the right to apply for voluntary retirement under Rule 48-A. In
these circumstances, the logical inference is that such a right to apply for
voluntary retirement under Rule 48-A (of the CCS Pension Rules) existed and
was a protected condition of service in terms of the tripartite agreements, Section
16(2) and Rule 6. Though the terms of the Trust Deed undoubtedly support the
plea that superannuation is the incident on which pension is payable, yet Rule

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

58 of 79

6(9) in my opinion was framed to cater to the eventuality of the Trust not being
liable to pay, but the GNCT being obliged to make arrangements to the extent the
Trust is unfunded, if there is a shortfalls in the event of exercise of option by an
employee under Rule 48-A CCS Pension Rules. In this context, it has to be held
that the tripartite agreements cannot be read as a charter to restrict existing
rights—their tenor and purpose was to grant continuity. Such being the case the
defect if any of the GNCT in constituting the Trust and the restrictive definition in
the Trust rules entitling only superannuated employees to pension cannot rob or
divest those applying, and becoming eligible to pension, in terms of rule 48-A of
Pension Rules to the terminal and pension benefits. In such an eventuality, the
GNCT has to the extent of Trust being unfunded bear the liability wherever
recourse is made by the transferred employees to Rule 48-A of the Pension Rules.
Regarding Question No. 2

73.

A decision on question No. 1 cannot automatically be dispositive of the

proceedings. The second question, as to the liability, to pay pension and terminal
benefits in terms of the schemes of the DISCOMS contested by both parties and
asserted with equal vehemence not to be that of either party, but the other, is of
crucial importance in this case.
74.

In the recent past, employers, particularly corporate and public employers,

have resorted to schemes with a view to reduce manpower, and achieve
rationalization or "downsizing" of staff. At times, this is aimed as a part of
WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

59 of 79

restructuring of the employer's staffing pattern; sometimes, it is aimed at
economizing activity and many times, its objective is to shed excess manpower. In
Bank of Baroda -vs- O.P. Swarnakar

(2) SCC 721; Board of Trustees,

Vishakhapatnam Port Trust v. T.S.N. Raju,(2006) 7 SCC 664, at page 675 and
State Bank of Patiala -vs- Ramesh Chandra Kanoji 2004 (2) SCC 651 it was
held that voluntary retirement Schemes are not proposals or offers but merely an
invitation to treat. They become binding contracts, upon the acceptance of the
application of the employee (an offer) by the management.

75.

In the Board of Trustees, Vishakapatnam Port Trust case (supra) the

Supreme Court applied the reasoning in the previous decisions that Voluntary
Retirement Schemes are contractual, and meant for achieving specific purposes;
they are non-statutory. The court held as follows:
"In Bank of India & Ors. vs. O.P. Swarnakar & Ors., (2003) 2 SCC
721, the moot question posed and answered by this judgment was
whether the VRS is an offer/proposal or merely an invitation to
offer. The question was whether the Banks intended to make an
offer or merely issued an invitation to treat is essentially a question
of fact. In paragraph 49, this Court held as under :
"49. An offer indisputably can be made to a group of persons
collectively which is capable of being accepted individually but the
question which has to be posed and answered is as to whether
having regard to the service jurisprudence : the principles of Indian
Contract Act would be applicable in the instant case. It is the
specific case of the "Banks" that the schemes had been floated by
way of contract. It does not have any statutory flavour. Reference
to the pension scheme framed under the regulations was made for
computation of the pension."
The learned Judges of the Bench have also elaborately discussed the
WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

60 of 79

use of the term "offer" or "proposal" and held in paragraphs 59, 60,
61, 62 and 74 as under :
"59. The request of employees seeking voluntary retirement was
not to take effect until and unless it was accepted in writing by the
competent authority. The Competent Authority had the absolute
discretion whether to accept or reject the request of the employee
seeking voluntary retirement under the scheme. A procedure has
been laid down for considering the provisions of the said scheme to
the effect that an employee who intends to seek voluntary
retirement would submit duly completed application in duplicate in
the prescribed form marked "offer to seek voluntary retirement"
and the application so received would be considered by the
competent authority on first come first serve basis. The procedure
laid down, therefore, suggests that the applications of the employee
would be an offer which could be considered by the bank in terms of
the procedure laid down thereof. There is no assurance that such an
application would be accepted without any consideration."
"60. Acceptance or otherwise of the request of an employee seeking
voluntary retirement is required to be communicated to him in
writing. This clause is crucial in view of the fact that therein the
acceptance or rejection of such request has been provided. The
decision of the authority rejecting the request is applicable to the
Appellate authority. The application made by an employee as an
offer as well as the decision of the bank thereupon would be
communicated to the respective General Managers. The decisions
making process shall take place at various levels of the banks."
"61. The following, therefore, can be deduced :
(i) The banks treated the application from the employees as an offer
which could be accepted or rejected.
(ii) Acceptance of such an offer is required to be communicated in
writing.
(iii) The decision making process involved application of mind on
the part of several authorities.
(iv) Decision making process was to be formed at various levels.
(v) The process of acceptance of an offer made by an employee was
in the discretion of competent authority.
(vi) The request of voluntary retirement would not take effect in
praesenti but in future.
(vii) The Bank reserved its right to alter/rescind the conditions of
the scheme."
"62. From what has been noticed before, it is apparent that the
Nationalized banks in terms of the scheme had secured for
themselves an unfettered and unguided right to deal with the jural

& WP(C)13231-40/05

relationship between themselves and their employees".
"74. We, therefore, have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion
that the voluntary scheme was not a proposal or an offer but
merely an invitation to treat and the applications filed by the
employees constituted an 'offer'."
In HEC Voluntary Retd. Employees Welfare Society & anr. vs.
Heavy Engineering Corpn. Ltd. & Ors., (2006) 3 SCC 708, this
Court in paragraph 11 held as under :
"11.An offer for voluntary retirement in terms of a scheme, when
accepted, leads to a concluded contract between the employer and
the employee. In terms of such a scheme, an employee has an
option either to accept or not to opt therefor. The scheme is purely
voluntary, in terms whereof the tenure of service is curtailed, which
is permissible in law. Such a scheme is ordinarily floated with a
purpose of downsizing the employees. It is beneficial both to the
employees as well as to the employer. Such a scheme is issued for
effective functioning of the industrial undertakings. Although the
Company is "State" within the meaning of Article 12 of the
Constitution, the terms and conditions of service would be
governed by the contract are employment. Thus, unless the terms
and conditions of such a contract are governed by a statute or
statutory rules, the provisions of the Contract Act would be
applicable both at the formulation of the contract as also the
determination thereof. By reason of such a scheme only is an
invitation of offer floated. When pursuant to or in furtherance of
such a Voluntary Retirement Scheme an employee opts therefore,
he makes an offer which upon acceptance by the employer gives
rise to a contract. Thus, as the matter relating to voluntary
retirement is not governed by any statute, the provisions of the
Contract Act, 1872, therefore, would be applicable too. (Bank of
India v. O. P. Swarnakar (2003) 2 SCC 721)."
76.

O. P. Swarnakar's case concerned a situation where the employer, i.e the

public sector bank had statutory conditions which enabled employees to apply for
voluntary retirement in the event of fulfilling the qualifying service criteria. The
employers introduced non-statutory schemes, which contained additional
benefits. The Supreme Court was required to decide whether the option once

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

62 of 79

exercised by employees, could be withdrawn, in the event of the conditions in the
non-statutory scheme being amended. The court held that the schemes operated
as contracts, which were complete upon acceptance by the employer.

77.

The above discussion was necessary for an understanding of the exact

nature of the rights of employees to secure terminal and other benefits, in the
event of their offers under special voluntary retirement schemes being accepted.
The decisions have consistently reasoned that such schemes are special in nature,
and contractual. The expression "Special Scheme" must be understood in the
context of a general Scheme of employment governing the terms and conditions
of service or which is a part of the statutory rules governing the service of the
employees. In this sense also the Voluntary Retirement Schemes or the schemes
of the DISCOMS in this case are Special Schemes. (Ref. HEC Voluntary Retd.
Employees Welfare Society case, supra).

78.

In the present case, the facts show that the objectives of the schemes were

not manpower reduction, but change of employee profile. The objectives outlined
by the DISCOMS in their ARR Petitions show that they desired to restructure
hierarchies and re-pattern employment within their organizations. It was not as if
new recruits were completely ruled out. No doubt, reduction and the consequent
economics was a significant factor; but it was not the main or predominant one.

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

63 of 79

More than a third of the workforce opted for the schemes. As on 1-7-2002 (i.e
date of transfer) the total work force of DVB who were transferred to three
DISCOMS, aggregated to 17692. As a consequence of the Schemes formulated by
the DISCOMS, 6210 such employees (2496 of BSES, 1868 of BYPL, 1846 of
NDPL) opted for the VSS/ VRS packages. The question is whether the liability
for payment of terminal benefits is cast upon the Trust or the GNCT, or both of
them.
79.

Both schemes of the DICOMS have largely common features:

(1) Eligibility is 10 years' qualifying service or 40 years age of the employee,
making the offer;

(2) Benefit, other than the "usual" ones, was defined as amounts equal to Basic
pay plus dearness allowances as applicable on the date of separation (i.e. date
when his request is accepted by the employer) for the number of months worked
out, on the basis of two months for each completed year in transferee
DISCOM/DVB or the monthly emoluments i.e. Basic Pay + DA on the date of
separation multiplied by the balance months of service left before normal date of
retirement, whichever was less. In addition to this, in the case of BSES the
employer gave additional incentives if the employees opting exceeded 2200, and
also an "early bird" incentive;
(3) Pension, terminal benefits, medical benefits, LTC, etc, as per rules, payable

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

64 of 79

by the Trust.
(4) Three months' notice pay.
(5) The nature and tenuous character of the schemes is evident, like in the
schemes considered in the reported cases, where the employer had the discretion
to refuse, or decline the request, and not accept the offer. In the schemes of BSES
and BYPL, Clause 10.3 and in the case of NDPL, clause XI (c) conferred such
discretion on the employer. These provisions override all other clauses and state,
in the clearest terms that the scheme does not confer any right on any employee
to have his/her request for voluntary retirement/separation accepted by the
competent authority.

80.

There are some important differences between the nature and character of

the DISCOM's schemes and the conditions spelt out in Rule 48/ 48-A. They are:
(1) In terms of the said rules the condition for cessation of service, indeed the
making of an application, i.e eligibility, is upon the completion of a fairly long
tenure of service (30 years in the case of Rule 48; 20 years for Rule 48A.)However, the period is far less in the two schemes. It is 10 years or the
employee being 40 years of age.
(2)

Rules 48 and 48-A are devoid of any element of inducement. However, the

schemes of DISCOMS contain inducement of ex gratia up to 60 months pay.
Besides, other inducements such as early bird incentives, etc were held out.

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

65 of 79

81.

The Trust and GNCT aver that in the normal course, when employees

applied for retirement in terms of Rule 48-A during the period when the schemes
were not in force, i.e between 1-7-2002 and 31-12-2003, only 141 employees
sought such premature retirement. They constituted less than 1% (i.e 0.65%) of
the workforce. In contrast, the number of applicants under the VRS/schemes of
the DISCOMS were a staggering 6210 or more than 33% of the total employee
strength.

82.

It had been contended on behalf of the DISCOMS that the GNCT and the

Trust were estopped from taking the position that they were not liable to pay
terminal dues in the event of acceptance of the offers under the schemes, because
the former were made aware. Strong reliance was placed upon the letter of Shri
Jagdish Sagar, dated 20-9-2003, nominee director of GNCT in NDPL, as well as
the decision of the DISCOMS endorsed by the respective nominees of GNCT. At
first blush, the letter of Shri Sagar seemingly supports this contention. Yet, a
careful reading of the entire letter, particularly the last paragraph would reveal
that he had cautioned that the DISCOM would have to bear the additional
funding for the cost by the DISCOMS:
"When calculating the benefits of the Early Separation Scheme, it
will be necessary to take into account the additional contributions
that would be expected from the new entities."
Similarly, the resolutions of DISCOMS, endorsed by nominee directors of GNCT,

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

66 of 79

uniformly record that extra cost of the scheme to be paid by the Trust would have
to be borne by the company (i.e DISCOMS). Even before the scheme became
operational, the GNCT, by its letter dated 31-12-2003 disclaimed its liability, and
told all the DISCOMS that:
" It has already been made clear at different times that the Pension
Trust will be able to take on the additional burden created by VRS
only on the basis of suitable compensation to the Trust for the
additional expenditure on this account. The Trust is working out
the implications in detail and will be apprising you of them with the
relevant calculations in the near future."
83.

It has been held in numerous decisions that to invoke the doctrine of

promissory estoppel, there should be clear, sound and positive foundation that
the party invoking the doctrine has altered its position relying on the assurance of
the Government. The assurance or promise relied upon should be forthright and
unequivocal; the party relying on it should have unalterably changed its
circumstances on the basis of that promise. ( Ref. Union of India v. Godfrey
Philips India Ltd., (1985) 4 SCC 369; Kasinka Trading v. Union of India, (1995)
1 SCC 274; Sharma Transport v. Govt. of A.P.,(2002) 2 SCC 188; and A.P. Steel
Rolling Mills -vs- State of Kerala 2007 (2) SCC 725). In the present case, there is
no such foundation; the materials also disclose that the GNCT had reservations
about the liability to pay terminal benefits and therefore consistently took the
position that the Trust had to be compensated additionally if it were to be saddled
with the liability. Therefore, I hold that there is no question of the GNCT, or the
Trust being estopped, as contended by the DISCOMS, or any liability on account

of alleged estoppel.
84.

The factual matrix would show that the anxiety of the GNCT and the DVB

was to primarlily allay the concerns of existing employees (of DVB) as to their
continuity of service, protection of service conditions, and preservation of
accrued rights, including terminal benefits. To that end, a Trust was created; Rs.
860 crores were transferred to it, as a one time payment, by the GNCT. The latter
also guaranteed that it would make good any shortfall, to the extent the Trust was
unfunded. These show that the objective of the GNCT and the mechanism
devised, i.e Section 16, Rule 6 as well as the Trust, was to enure to the benefit of
all the employees, assuring their past service, as well as accrued benefits. The
Trust was not forseen, or created as a devise to achieve future

manpower

reduction of DISCOM's . If such were the intention, the GNCT could have
negotiated or devised suitable measures. What was visualized was continuity of
the existing state of affairs. This is reinforced by the express assurance that there
would be no retrenchment. The facts also show that though the concept of
voluntary retirement existed and was protected in the DISCOMS as a condition of
employment, i.e Rule 48-A of the CCS Pension Rules, that was not resorted to in
these cases. The employees who opted under the schemes, did so under special
terms and were primarily impelled by the ex-gratia amounts and other
substantial monetary benefits. Besides as a matter of law too, the schemes are
contractual, and stand apart from the "normal" voluntary retirement under
Section 48-A.

85.

Apart from the above considerations, such as distinctions between the

statutory scheme (Rule 48-A) and the VRS schemes of the DISCOMS, there is
another feature which assumes significance. The Trust has to cater to a large
number of members, who are expected to attain superannuation on achieving the
age of retirement. The application of Rule 48-A is an exception; it has operated in
an insignificant manner, in the normal course. In its own terms, an employee's
request for voluntary retirment does not operate as a severance unless it is
accepted by the employer. Thus, if the employee seeks voluntary retirement
under Rule 48-A, it is subject to regulation and the individual is retired only if the
offer is accepted. In normal circumstances if such requests are received from an
unusually large number of employees, without any form of allurement, then too,
the employer has a right to withold acceptance, on grounds of financial
considerations, if so advised by the Pension Trust. Here, the proportion of
employees opting under the schemes is on an exodus scale. It does not tax one's
imaginantion as to why such requests were made: the inducements and
allurements held out by the DISCOMS were formidable and powerful. This was
based on a unilateral scheme formulation exercise, by the DISCOMS, on an
assumption of the Pension Trust and GNCT's liability. If the employer, i.e the
DISCOMS are allowed to in effect deplete Trust funds (as would be the case, if
their claim is upheld) then, even those ineligible under Rule 48-A can claim
terminal benefits. More importantly, vis-a-vis those (among the optees) who

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

would be covered by Rule 48-A, the Trust funds's corpus would be depleted, to
the grave prejudice of the contributories, who have to await their normal turn.
There is clearly no warrant for such an inroad into the Trust funds in the Deed.
The payments in question on account of VRS/SVRS do lead to unforeseen
financial implications such as pre-ponement of payment of pension, preponement of gratuity, pre-ponement of payment of leave encashment, loss of
pension and leave salary contribution which the Trust would otherwise be
entitled to till decision of normal date of superannuation and a substantial loss of
interest on the capital outcome. The Trust has alleged that financial implications
for an estimated 10 year cycle/service period based on present value on money
were worked out, when the fund was created. In the HEC Voluntary Retd.
Employees Welfare Society & Anr. Vs. Heavy Engineering Corpn. Ltd. case and
State Bank of Patiala case (supra) the Supreme Court had recognized that VRS
schemes are special as well as the end product of careful financial planning,
which include putting in place special funding. The DISCOMS were aware of this,
as is evident from the disclosure in ARR petitions, where provision to fund the
ex-gratia payments were made. However, they adopted an ostrich like and
schizophrenic approach when it came to the payment of terminal benefits entirely
seeking to cast the burden on the Trust, whose charter is to cater to normal
contingencies, such as superannuation, and pay out of terminal and pensionary
benefits to a negligible percentage of the members every year, on account of
death, incapacitation or due to voluntary retirement, and not make pay-outs on

& WP(C)13231-40/05

70 of 79

adoption of unplanned and unapproved policies, by DISCOMS, as in this case.

86.

For the above reasons, I find that the schemes of DISCOMS cannot be

equated with voluntary retirement in exercise of the conditions of service which
existed at the time of transfer; they are in any case outside the purview of Rule
48-A. Therefore, the optees do not fall within the description of those voluntarily
retiring as per conditions of service existing as on 1-7-2002; they were induced to
contractually depart from employment. The Trust is not geared to bear this
sudden and substantial, unilaterally created burden; the GNCT, too, is not liable
in terms of the Act or Rule 6(9) to fund the payment of terminal benefits, of such
VRS/SVSS optees. The severence being achieved through contract between the
DISCOMS and the employees, the liability for payment of terminal benefits, as
well as commutation of pension and monthly residual pension, is that of the
DISCOMS.

REGARDING QUESTION NO.3

87.

In the preceding discussion it has been held that the VRS/Schemes

formulated by “DISCOMS” are contractual. The employees who opted, clearly did
so on the assumption that they would be paid pension and their other terminal
benefits of past service based on the provisions of the Act as well as continuity
guaranteed in terms of the Act, Rules and the Tripartite Agreements. However,

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

71 of 79

the terms in the VRS assuring payment of pension and terminal benefits by the
trust were unilateral.
88.

The Scheme was accepted in its terms by the employees on the assumption

that they would be paid the entire package which include terminal dues. Today as
the consequence of the above findings the liability to pay pension and terminal
dues, according to the Schemes does not fall upon the Trust. A simple solution
would be relegate the parties the position they stood when the contract was
formed i. e. restoration of the employment of those who opted for the VRS. This
is because the entire VRS offered and accepted by the two contracting parties was
one whole package. It is not possible for the Court to excise one part of it and
uphold the latter. This logic is strengthened by a powerful reasoning that the
contract failed because the material consideration remained unpaid. However,
this reasoning would lead to some complications.

The VRS optees severed

relationship with the DISCOMS more than three years ago. The employers have
in the meanwhile restructured their organization and clearly proceeded ahead on
that basis. Relegating parties to a status quo ante in these circumstances would
not be practicable. The second option could be to declare that the liability to pay
pension and terminal benefits till the attainment of normal age of
superannuation by the VRS optees is that of the DISCOMS and leave it to the
employees to work out their remedies. In such case this judgment would at best
be declaratory and lead to multiplicity of litigation as the DISCOMS liabilities
would have to be worked out through appropriate legal proceedings.

89.

During the proceedings the trust had adverted to what is termed as the

“IPGCL model” whereby a successor company of DVB, IPGCL was to make one
time payment to the VRS optees on account of commutation of pension, gratuity,
provident fund and leave encashment etc., on the assumption that such amounts
would be refunded by the trust to the IPGCL without any interest when the
concerned employees attains the age of superannuation, or dies, whichever is
earlier.

As far as the liability to pay residual pension to such optees was

concerned, the IPGCL assumed that liability from the date of severance of the
optees till the date of their superannuation in the normal course or death,
whichever was earlier. The trust, according to IPGCL model would assume the
liabilities for payment of residual pension after the employee attained the normal
date of superannuation. The NDPL during the course of the proceedings had
suggested that another possible solution could be for appropriate determination
of the additional compensation, by application of actuarial principles, through a
process of adjudication/determination of an expert body. The BSES/BYPL have
not made any suggestions in this regard.

90.

These batch of cases has presented various complexities. It is well-known

that in judicial review the Court does not enter into a primary decision making
exercise. It is enjoined to apply judicial review standards and decide whether
action of the State or public agencies are correct and proper. This is conditioned

WP(C) 4827/05, WP(C)5198-99/05, WP(C) 23460/05
& WP(C)13231-40/05

73 of 79

with one imperative under Article 226 of the Constitution i.e. the need to do
justice between the parties. It has been held repeatedly that the Court exercising
powers under Article 226 of the of Constitution of India can mould the relief.
The amplitude of the proceedings are sufficiently wide and the Court can devise
appropriate modalities or mechanisms to do substantial justice between the
parties.

91.

In this case if the Court were to decide the cases on the basis of the

findings, the judgment would be merely declaratory. As explained earlier, such a
declaratory judgment would spawn further litigation. That course would not be
correct since the former employees of the DISCOMS who opted for the VRS have
also claimed relief in the proceedings through substantive writ petitions.
Therefore, this is an appropriate case whether the Court should discharge its
duties and issue appropriate directions for the parties to achieve substantial
justice with a view to end all disputes.
92.

Two options, hereafter elaborated are proposed. The first is payment of

the terminal dues to VRS optees by the DISCOMS through the IPGCL model. In
case the DISCOMS do not agree to this, the Trust would pay the dues, and
residual pension, after the DISCOMS pay the additional costs on account of
premature withdrawal to it, on the basis of award of an Arbitral Tribunal,
constituted in terms of this judgment.
