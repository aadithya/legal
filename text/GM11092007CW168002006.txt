Rule

2.

Learned counsel for the respondent waives notice of rule.

The parties submit that the writ petition can be disposed of on
the basis of the available pleadings. The respondent has also
brought the original record relating to the registration of the
petitioner before this court.
3.

There is no material dispute to the facts giving rise to the

present petition and the same are briefly noticed hereafter.

4.

The petitioner was registered with the Delhi Development

Authority (“DDA” in short) under the “NPRS - 1979” for
allotment of an MIG flat in the year 1979 on making payment of
registration deposit of Rs.4,500/-.

As per the scheme of

allotment, this deposit was to earn interest at the rate of 7%
compounded annually.
5.

It is an admitted position that based on her priority

number, the petitioner was successful in drawing an MIG flat
bearing no.150-C, Pocket – J & K, Dilshad Garden, Delhi which
was communicated to her vide letter dated 21st April, 1986.
The petitioner did not avail this allotment and by a letter dated
20th May, 1986, requested the respondent to place the
petitioner's name for further allotment in Paschim Vihar, Vikas
Puri, Rohini & Pitam Pura.

Thus, it would appear that the

petitioner had requested for being considered for allotment of
flat at a later date in accordance with the offer made by the
respondent in the letter dated 24th February, 1986 itself.
6.

It appears that consequently, as communicated in the

letter dated 21st April, 1986, the respondent placed the
petitioner at the end of the priority list and considered her for
WP (C) No.16800/2006

Page No.2

allotment in a draw of lots held on 31st March, 2004. Against
the petitioner's priority number, she drew a flat bearing no.C88, Third Floor, Sector 12, Dwarka Phase 1, Delhi. Interestingly,
the petitioner was not informed of her being successful in
drawing this flat.
7.

I find from the record that inasmuch as the respondent

addressed a communication dated 11th August, 2004 requiring
the petitioner to deposit within 15 days additional copies of the
fixed deposit receipts, registration card, challan for Rs.4,500/-,
photocopies of the challan vide which cancellation charges have
been deposited, photocopy of the letter vide which the
petitioner has been requested to deposit the cancellation
charges, photocopy of any correspondence made with the DDA
in connection with allotment of flat, photocopy of the demand
letter, if allotment made and got the same cancelled, photocopy
of the ration card indicating residential address along with two
photocopies and signatures duly attested by gazetted officer 1st
class and any letter from DDA where tail and priority has been
assigned and could be allotted for depositing cancellation
charges.

The petitioner has placed before this court proof of having

submitted these documents on the 2nd September, 2004. The
DDA had issued acknowledgment receipt no.REC/H/04/29788
dated 2nd September, 2004 of the receipt of these documents to
the petitioner.
9.

No

further

communication

appears

to

have

been

addressed by the DDA to the petitioner.
10. The petitioner has contended that after a passage of
almost two years thereafter, she was shocked to receive a letter
dated 25th August, 2006 informing her that the DDA had
cancelled her allotment/registration due to Flat No.88, THD,
Sector – 12, Dwarka Phase I, Delhi, of her having failed to
respond to the letter dated 11th August, 2004.
11. This writ petition has been filed assailing the cancellation
of the allotment of the petitioner as informed to her by the
communication of 25th August, 2006.
12. Perusal of the record shows that the documents which
have been admittedly received by the DDA on 2nd September,
2004, are not available on the original file.

The note sheet

shows that after 6th August, 2004, the file has been dealt with
WP (C) No.16800/2006

Page No.4

on several dates and on 24th April, 2005, a noting has been
recorded

requiring

cross-checking

of

the

status

by

the

concerned branch. Again the DDA proceeded for verification of
the fixed deposit receipts. Finally on 30th June, 2000, the DDA
has recorded that no response has been received from the
petitioner in answer to the letter dated 11th August, 2004.
Finally, a recommendation was made on the 4th July, 2006 to
cancel the allotment which was processed subsequently.
13. From the counter affidavit filed before this court, I find that
there is no explanation as to the documents which have been
submitted by the petitioner against valid and binding receipt by
the DDA on 2nd September, 2004. There is also no challenge to
the receipt which has been placed on record by the petitioner.
Interestingly, the DDA at no point of time has informed the
petitioner with regard to the fact that she has actually drawn a
flat no.C-88, Third Floor, Sector 12, Dwarka Phase 1, Delhi in the
draw of lots held on 31st March, 2004. No such intimation was
given to the petitioner even in the letter dated 11th August,
2004. Obviously, the petitioner has been kept in the dark with
regard to the allotment which has been drawn by her.
WP (C) No.16800/2006

Page No.5

14. Obviously, at this stage, the petitioner is kept awaiting for
the flat and has not corresponded with the respondent after
submission of the documents on 2nd September, 2004.
15. The petitioner having submitted the required documents in
terms of the letter dated 11th August, 2004, it would appear that
the order of cancellation of the allotment in favour of the
petitioner communicated by the letter dated 25th August, 2006
is proceeded on wholly incorrect premise. Even though there
was no intimation of the allotment in favour of the petitioner,
the DDA has by the communication of 25th August, 2006,
communicated cancellation of the alloted flat to the petitioner.
16. In view of the afore-noticed facts, I have no hesitation in
holding that the order dated 25th August, 2006 cancelling the
allotment of the flat in favour of the petitioner is arbitrary,
illegal and contrary to the record and consequently cannot be
sustained.
17. Mr. R.K. Saini, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner,
has also submitted that a reference was made to the deposit of
cancellation charges in the letter dated 11th August, 2004.

I

find from the record which has been placed before this court
WP (C) No.16800/2006

Page No.6

that the DDA has not issued any letter informing the petitioner
of assignment of a tail in the priority and there has been no
demand for deposit of any cancellation charges.
18. In any case, perusal of the letter dated 21st April, 1986
whereby the respondent has first informed the petitioner of the
demand-cum-allotment of flat in Dilshad Garden which is in her
favour, I find that the DDA had clearly endorsed a condition that
“in case the allotment is not accepted, you will be placed at the
end of the priority list for further allotment”.

The petitioner

accepted this condition when she addressed the communication
dated 20th May, 1986. The petitioner has thereby suffered the
disadvantage of being placed at the tail end of the priority list
for further allotment and has thereby been deprived of
allotment of a flat for a long period of almost 18 years from
April, 1986 to 31st

March, 2004.

In the instant case, the

petitioner has been deprived of even the second allotment
made to her by the failure of the respondent in considering by
the document filed by her and their failure in communicating
the allotment to the petitioner.
19. Mr. R.K. Saini, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner,
WP (C) No.16800/2006

Page No.7

has also pointed out that at the time of registration, the
petitioner is required to deposit an amount of Rs.4,500/- with
the DDA on which interest at the rate of 7% compounded
annually enures to the petitioner. This fixed deposit receipt is
required to be discharged by the petitioner in favour of the DDA
pursuant to the allotment made.
20. Consequently, I find force in the submissions on behalf of
the petitioner that the DDA is not only bound by the
consequences which it has intimated to the petitioner in case if
she failed to accept the allotment made by the letter dated 21st
April, 1986. There is also force in the submissions on behalf of
the petitioner that the DDA cannot be permitted to unduly
enrich itself inasmuch as the DDA gets the benefit of interest
which accrues on the fixed deposit receipts.

The respondent

not having communicated any requirement of making payment
towards the cancellation of the original allotment, imposed such
a condition at the belated stage of making the second
allotment.
21. This of course is purely academic as in the instant case,
the

respondent

WP (C) No.16800/2006

has

not

communicated

any

Page No.8

cancellation

charges.
22. The views taken are also fortified by the pronouncement of
this court dated 18th October, 2005 in WP (C) No.5793/2005 Raj
Kumar Malhotra Vs. DDA.
For all the foregoing reasons, this writ petition deserves to
be allowed.
23. Accordingly, the order dated 25th August, 2006 cancelling
the allotment of the flat of the petitioner is hereby quashed.
24. A direction is accordingly issued to the DDA to issue
demand-cum-allotment letter to the petitioner at the same cost
at which the demand was raised in respect of the flat bearing
no.150-C, Pocket – J & K, Dilshad Garden, Delhi allotted on 21st
April, 1986.

It is open to the DDA to charge demand

cancellation charges and interest on the said cancellation
charges at 15% per annum till 31st March, 2004.
25. Mr. R.K. Saini, learned counsel for the petitioner, submits
that without prejudice to the contentions of the petitioner, in
order to obviate any further delay in receiving possession of the
flat, the petitioner is willing to pay any cancellation charges
with interest thereon at 15% per annum till 31st March, 2004.
WP (C) No.16800/2006

Page No.9

26. The DDA will issue a demand-cum-allotment letter to the
petitioner within six weeks from today.
27. Upon the petitioner making payment of the demanded
amount, the DDA shall hand over the possession within a
further period of four weeks thereafter.

The DDA shall also

notify the petitioner of the cancellation charges and interest
thereon at the rate of 15% per annum till 31st March, 2004 in
the demand-cum-allotment letter which shall be issued to the
petitioner.
This writ petition and the application are disposed of in the
above terms.
The petitioner shall be entitled to the costs of Rs.5,500/which shall be paid within a period of four weeks from today.
