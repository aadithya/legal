ORDER
02.04.2008
1. The petitioner had filed an application for allotment of a flat under Narela
Housing Scheme, 2004. The petitioner had deposited Rs.30,000/- and
was successful in the draw of lots. On 25.5.2004, the demand cum
allotment letter was issued to the petitioner for payment of disposal cost
of the flat of Rs.5,66,796/-. Demand cum allotment letter also provided
that payment could be made up to 22.12.2004 with interest. It was
stated in clause 13 of the demand cum allotment letter that there would
be automatic cancellation in case deposit was not made by 22.12.2004.
2. It is the admitted case that the petitioner did not make payment by
22.12.2004. About four days before the said date i.e. on 18.12.2004,
the petitioner wrote a letter to DDA seeking permission to mortgage the
property with a bank to arrange for loan.

On 20.12.2004, DDA gave

permission to the petitioner to mortgage the property. No payment was

made by the petitioner even thereafter.
3. After lapse of about 1 ½ years on 12.5.2006, the petitioner deposited
Rs.7,39,000/- in the bank account of the respondent/DDA. This deposit
in fact was made after DDA had issued show cause notice dated 1st
May, 2006 asking the petitioner to produce evidence if he had made
payment in terms of the demand cum allotment letter dated 25.5.2004.
Thereafter, the petitioner was informed by DDA that his allotment was
cancelled and cannot be restored. He was asked to apply for refund of
the amount deposited by him.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the issue of show cause
notice dated 01.5.2006 shows that the allotment was not cancelled and
time could be extended.

She also submits that DDA has various

policies under which time for payments have been extended and
belated payments have been condoned. She has referred to some
documents with the rejoinder and states that time for payment of money
was extended in some cases.
5. I do not think issue of show cause notice dated 1st May, 2006 amounts to
extension for time for making payment. Show cause notice was issued
as a matter of caution to verify whether the petitioner had in fact made
payment and therefore, he was required to submit documents. Show
cause does not state that the time for making payment has been
extended.

6. DDA has framed various policies and guidelines depending upon the
scheme. Under several schemes, initial registration was made in 197981 but allotment could not be made because DDA was not able to
construct flats within reasonable time. In view of factual background,
DDA has framed schemes/guidelines for condonation of delay and
extension of time to make payment. As far as Narela Housing Scheme
is concerned, it was one time scheme. A particular number of flats
were available for disposal. Applications were invited and allotments
were made. Others were refunded the registration amounts. Clause 16
of the said scheme stipulates as under:“16.

PERIOD FOR PAYMENT
Allottee is liable to make the payment within 90 days
from the date of issue of demand letter without interest.
Thereafter, the allottee is liable to deposit the amount in
not more than next 90 days along with interest @ 15%
p.a. compounded as on 31st March. If the payment is
not made within 180 days from the date of demand
letter, allotment of the flat will be automatically
cancelled. No show cause notice / intimation will be
given by the DDA for cancelaltion. No time extension
for payment beyond the date of automatic cancellation
would be given in this scheme. Also no restoration is
allowed, repeat no restoration is allowed once the
flat is automatically cancelled due to non payment.
Allottees should submit the required papers to DDA (on
their own) for refund if they fail to deposit the demanded
amount within 180 days. The amount deposited will be
refunded without interest and after deduction of
cancellation charges as mentioned in para 13. If the
allottee fails to submit required documents within
180 days from the date of automatic cancellation,
the amount deposited by allottee shall be forfeited.”

7. It is made clear in the said clause that no extension of time beyond 180
days was permissible. It has been emphasized in the said clause that
there shall be no restoration after 180 days and there would be an
automatic cancellation and the registration amount deposited by the
allottee shall be forfeited. In the present case, the period of 180 days
expired on 22.12.2004. In fact, DDA went out for way to issue letter
permitting the petitioner to mortgage the flat within 2 days after request
was made by the petitioner on 18.12.2004. The payments were made
in May, 2006 after almost 1 ½ years or 18 months from the date last
payment was to be made. In view of the specific terms and conditions
of the scheme, which was one time scheme and as the registration was
valid only for the said scheme and for a particular number of flats, I do
not find any merit in the present writ petition and the same is dismissed.
8. The petitioner is entitled to refund of the amount deposited by him. The
petitioner will appear before the Director (Housing-II), DDA on
28.4.2008 at 3.30 p.m. along with relevant documents and refund
cheque will be issued to him as per terms of the scheme.
