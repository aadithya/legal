1.

The above two captioned second appeals are filed

by the same appellant K.K.Mehrotra and arise out of a common
judgment and decree dated 18.5.2002 passed by the Additional
District Judge, Delhi whereby

judgment and decree for

declaration and permanent injunction passed by the Civil Judge,
Delhi on 18.12.1999 in favour of the appellant was set aside
and suit for possession filed by the respondent which was
dismissed by the Civil Judge, Delhi was decreed.

2.

Backdrop facts leading to the filing of the present

appeals are that late Sh. Panna Lal Mehrotra (hereinafter
referred to as the deceased) died on 24.3.1987 leaving behind
his widow, Smt. Chandravati and 3 daughters. At the time of
his death, deceased was the sole and the exclusive owner of
the property bearing Municipal No. 133/134, Gali Batashan,
Barsha Bullah, Chawri Bazar, Delhi (hereinafter referred to as
the suit property).
3.

Daughters of the deceased relinquished their share

in the suit property in favour of their mother Smt. Chandravati.
4.

Smt. Chandravati executed a sale deed dated

18.1.1989 transferring all her rights and interests in the suit
property in favour of the respondent Smt. Ratan Prabha.
5.

Thereafter the appellant i.e. Mr. K.K.Mehrotra who

was the son of the brother of the deceased filed a suit bearing
no.60/89 (new no.343/97) against Smt. Chandravati praying
that the sale deed dated 18.1.1989 be declared as null and
void and that Smt. Chandravati be restrained from transferring
or alienating the suit property in favour of any other person
including the respondent.

Material allegations in the plaint

were that:i).

Appellant was the adopted son of the deceased

ii).

Appellant was adopted by the deceased in the year

RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 2 of 16

1951.
iii).

Appellant is residing in the suit property since last

20-25 years. He was residing therein with the deceased and
his family during the life time of the deceased. That even after
the death of the deceased appellant continued to reside with
his adoptive/foster mother i.e. Smt. Chandravati.
iv).

Suit property was never partitioned.

v).

Being legal heir of the deceased appellant is entitled

to a share in the suit property.
vi)

Sale deed dated 18.1.1989 executed by Smt.

Chandravati alienating the suit property in favour of the
respondent be declared null and void for the reason she was
not the sole and exclusive owner of the property.
6.

Simultaneously with the filing of the aforenoted suit

by the appellant, the respondent also filed a suit bearing
no.598/89 against the plaintiff praying that a decree for the
possession of the suit property be granted in his favour.
Material allegations in the said plaint were that:i).

Smt. Chandravati is the sole and exclusive owner of

the suit property.
ii).

Appellant is not the adopted son of the deceased.

iii).

Appellant forcibly took the possession of the first

floor of the suit property.
RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 3 of 16

iv).

Respondent is the valid and legal purchaser of the

suit property.
7.

Both the parties led their evidence in support of

their respective suits.
8.

In order to establish that he was duly adopted by the

deceased appellant examined himself.

In his testimony

appellant reiterated the stand taken in the plaint filed by him.
No other witness was examined. It is noteworthy that natural
parents of the deceased were alive at the time of the trial of
the suit yet he chose not to examine them.
9.

As regards documentary evidence only a settlement

deed Ex.DW-1/A dated 10.9.1951 entered into between the
deceased and his three brothers namely Ganga Sahai, Raj
Narain

and

Madan

Mohan

was

filed

by

the

appellant.

Settlement deed Ex. DW-1/A is in Dev Nagri Script. Relevant
part of the translation of the said settlement deed reads as
under:“We Ganga Sahai s/o Lala Basant Rai ---- Ist Party
and Raj Narain and Madan Mohan in person and
guardian Manmohan minor son own ..... Third Party
and Panna Lal in person guardian Krishan Kumar
minor adopted minor son own s/o Lala Ganga Sahai
Caste Khatri r/o Bullanshahar.”
10.

Apart from the settlement deed dated 10.9.1951 no

other document was proved.
11.

In so far as evidence of respondent is concerned she

RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 4 of 16

examined one Mr. Vinod Kumar who is the attorney and
husband of the respondent. Vinod Kumar deposed that he was
the neighbourer of Chandravati and that he was on visiting
terms with her.

He further deposed that the appellant has

been residing in the suit property since 20-25 years. However
when questioned about the relationship of the appellant with
the deceased and his family he pleaded ignorance.
12.

Noting the aforenoted settlement deed Ex.DW-1/A

and testimony of Vinod Kumar that he is not aware about the
relationship of the appellant with the deceased and his family
even though he was the neighbourer and was on visiting terms
with Chandravati, vide decision dated 18.12.1999 the learned
Trial Court has held that the appellant has been able to
successfully establish that he is the adopted son of the
deceased. A decree for declaration and permanent injunction
as prayed for by the appellant in suit no.60/1989 (new
no.343/97) was granted by the Trial Court.

The suit bearing

no.598/89 filed by the respondent for possession of the suit
property was dismissed.
13.

Against the judgment and decree dated 18.12.1999

passed by the learned Trial Court, two appeals bearing Nos.
RCA No. 12/2000 and RCA No. 13/2000 were filed by the
respondent.

RCA No. 12/2000 was directed against the

RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 5 of 16

decision of the trial court in suit no.60/89 granting a decree for
declaration

and

permanent

injunction

in

favour

of

the

appellant. RCA No. 13/2000 was directed against the decision
of the trial court order dismissing suit no.598/89 filed by the
respondent for the possession of the suit property.
14.

Holding that the burden to prove the adoption of the

appellant by the deceased was on the appellant and that he
failed the discharge the same, vide decision dated 18.5.2002
the learned Appellate Court allowed the appeals of the
respondent. In RCA No.12/2000 the appellate court set aside
the decree of declaration and permanent injunction passed by
the Trial Court in favour of the appellant in suit no.60/89. In
RCA No.13/2000

the appellate court

granted a decree for

possession of the suit property as prayed for by the respondent
in suit no.598/1989.
15.

Aggrieved by the judgment and decree dated

18.5.2002 passed by the learned Appellate Court, the appellant
has filed the present two second appeals. RSA No.119/02 is
directed against the decision of the appellate court in RCA
No.12/2000. RSA No.120/02 is directed against the decision of
the appellate court in RCA No.13/2000.
16.

At the hearing held on 23.11.2007 under-noted

substantial question of law was framed by this court:RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 6 of 16

“Whether in view of Ex. EW-1/A finding returned by
the first Appellate Court that there is no sustainable
evidence to conclude that appellant was the adopted
son of late Panna Lal is correct?”
17.

On the standard of proof to establish adoption, in

the decision reported as AIR 1959 SC 504 Kishori Lal Vs. Mst.
Chaltibai the Supreme Court observed as under:“As an adoption results in changing the course of
succession, depriving wives and daughters of their
rights and transferring properties to comparative
strangers or more remote relations it is necessary
that the evidence to support it should be such that it
is free from all suspicion of fraud and so consistent
and probable as to leave no occasion for doubting its
truth. Failure to produce accounts, in circumstances
such as have been proved in the present case, would
be a very suspicious circumstance. The importance
of accounts was emphasised by the Privy Council in
Sootrugun v. Sabitra ((1834) 2 Knapp. 287); in
Diwakar Rao v. Chandanlal Rao ((1916) I.L.R. 44
Calcutta 201 (P.C.); in Kishorilal v. Chunilal ((1908)
36 I.A. 9); in Lal Kunwar v. Charanji Lal ((1909) 37
I.A. 1, 7) and in Padamlal v. Fakira Debya (A.I.R.
1931 (P.C.) 84).”
18.

In the decision reported as AIR 1987 SC 962 Rahasa

Pandiani (Dead) by L.Rs. And Ors. Vs. Gokulananda Panda &
Ors. the Supreme Court gave a warning to be careful in dealing
with the cases of adoption.

In this judgment the earlier

judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Kishori Lal
(supra) was quoted with approval. In the said judgment it was
observed as under:“As an adoption results in changing the course of
succession, depriving wives and daughters of their
rights and transferring properties to comparative
RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 7 of 16

strangers or more remote relations it is necessary
that the evidence to support it should be such that it
is free from all suspicion of fraud and so consistent
and probable as to leave no occasion for doubting its
truth. Failure to produce accounts, in circumstances
such as have been proved in the present case, would
be a very suspicious circumstance. The importance of
accounts was emphasised by the Privy Council in
Sootragun v. Sabitra; in Diwakar Rao v. Chandanlal
Rao; in Kishorilal v. Chunilal; in Lal Kunwar v.
Charanji Lal and in Padamlal v. Fakira Debya.”
19.

The Supreme Court further observed as under:“... Be it realized that setting up a spurious adoption
is not less frequent than concocting a spurious Will,
and equally, if not more difficult to unmask. And the
court has to be extremely alert and vigilant to guard
against being ensnared by schemers who indulge in
unscrupulous practices out of their lust for property.
If there are any suspicious circumstances, just as the
propounder of the will is obliged to dispel the cloud
of suspicion, the burden is on one who claims to have
been adopted to dispel the same beyond reasonable
doubt. In the case of an adoption which is not
supported by a registered document or any other
evidence of a clinching nature if there exist
suspicious circumstances, the same must be
explained to the satisfaction of the conscience of the
court by the party contending that there was such an
adoption. Such is the position as an adoption would
divert the normal and natural course of succession.
Experience of life shows that just as there have been
spurious claims about execution of a Will, there have
been spurious claims about adoption having taken
place. And the court has therefore to be aware of the
risk involved in upholding the claim of adoption if
there are circumstances which arouse the suspicion
of the court and the conscience of the court is not
satisfied that the evidence preferred to support such
an adoption is beyond reproach.”

20.

It is well established principle of law that onus lies

upon the person who seeks to displace the natural succession
RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 8 of 16

by alleging adoption. When the question arises whether there
has been adoption in a particular case, the conduct of the
parties both before and after adoption, the attendant and
antecedent circumstances, the existence or absence of any
writing

with

reference

to

adoption

and

any

previous

adjudication in the matter by the Court would be relevant.
21.

An essential condition of

a valid adoption is

performance of ceremony of giving and taking of the adopted
child by the natural and foster parents.(See the decision of the
Supreme Court in the decision reported as AIR 1961 SC 1378
Lakshman Singh Kothari v Smt. Rup Kanwar and Section 11(6)
of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act).
22.

But it is not possible in every case to lead oral

evidence of giving and taking to prove adoption and more
particularly in the case of an adoption alleged in the distant
past. In case of an adoption in the distant past it is very difficult
to get direct evidence for the reasons the persons who actually
witnessed the adoption may not be in the world of living at the
time when the issue of adoption has arisen before the Court.
23.

In the decision reported as AIR 1970 SC 1286 Debi

Prasad Vs. Smt. Tribeni Devi while considering the issue
pertaining to burden of proof and mode of appreciation of
evidence in case of an adoption in the distant past, the
RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 9 of 16

Supreme Court observed as under:“There is no doubt that the burden of proving
satisfactorily that he was given by his natural father
and received by Gopal Das as his adoptive son is on
Shyam Behari Lal. But as observed by the Judicial
Committed1 of the Privy Council in Rajendrao Nath
Holder v. Jogendro Nath Benerjee and Ors. 14 Moore's
Indian Appeals p. 67 that although the person who
pleads that he had been adopted is bound to prove
his title as adopted son, as a fact yet from the long
period during which he had been received as an
adopted son, every allowance for the absence of
evidence to prove such fact was to be favourably
entertained, and that the case was analogous to that
in which the legitimacy of a person in possession had
been acquiesced in for a considerable time, and
afterwards impeached by a party, who had a right to
question the legitimacy, where the defendant, in
order to defend his status, is allowed to invoke
against the claimant every presumption which arises
from long recognition of his legitimacy by members of
his family; that in the case of a Hindoo, long
recognition as an adopted son, raised even a stronger
presumption in favour of the validity of his adoption,
arising from the possibility of the loss of his rights in
his own family by being adopted in another family. In
Rup Narain and Anr. v. Mst. Gopal Devi and Ors. 36
I.A. p. 103 the Judicial Committee observed, that in
the absence of direct evidence much value has to be
attached to the fact that the alleged adopted son had
without controversy succeeded to his adoptive
father's estate and enjoyed till his death and that
documents during his life and after his death were
framed upon the basis of the adoption. A Division
Bench of the Orissa High Court in Balinki Padkano and
Anr. v. Gopalkrishna Padhano and Ors. AIR 1964 ORI
117 held that in the case of an ancient adoption
evidence showing that the boy was treated for a long
time as the adopted son at a time when there was no
controversy is sufficient to prove the adoption
although evidence of actual giving and taking is not
forthcoming. We are in agreement with the views
expressed in the decisions referred to above.
In the case of all ancient transactions, it is but natural
RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 10 of 16

that positive oral evidence will be lacking. Passage of
time gradually wipes out such evidence. Human
affairs often have to be judged on the basis of
probabilities. Rendering of justice will become
impossible if a particular mode of proof is insisted
upon under all circumstances. In judging whether an
adoption pleaded has been satisfactorily proved or
not, we have to bear in mind the lapse of time
between, the date of the alleged adoption and the
date on which the concerned party is required to
adduce proof. In the case of an adoption said to have
taken place years before the same is questioned, the
most important evidence is likely to be that the
alleged adoptive father held out the person claiming
to have been adopted as his son; the latter treated
the former as his father and their relations and friends
treated them as father and son. There is no
predetermined way of proving any fact. A fact is said
to have been proved where after considering the
matters before it, the court either believes it to exist
or considers its existence so probable that a prudent
man ought, under the circumstances of the particular
case, to act upon the supposition that it exists. Hence
if after taking an overall view of the evidence
adduced in the case, we are satisfied that the
adoption pleaded is true, we must necessarily
proceed on the basis, in the absence of any evidence
to the contrary, that it is a valid adoption as well.”
24.

In the decision reported as Moti Lal Vs. Sardar Mal &

Ors. AIR 1976 Rajasthan 40 the Rajasthan High Court observed
as under:“It has been laid down in several cases that after a
lapse of long years, it is likely that the evidence of
adoption may not be available and it may become
difficult to find any witness who had eye-witnessed
the ceremony of actual giving and taking in adoption.
In such cases if the party alleging adoption adduces
some evidence of the factum of adoption, it may be
regarded as sufficient to shift the burden on the other
side to prove that fee adoption did not take place. In
such cases of old adoption, a presumption in favour
of the validity of the adoption is naturally drawn from
RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 11 of 16

the status of the adopted son in the adopting family
and its recognition by the members of the family for a
number of years. Reference in this connection may
fee made to the following authorities wherein due
weight has been given to all the inferences and
presumptions which may arise from such status of
the adopted person and its recognition : Nand
Kashore v. Brij Behari, ILR (1954) 4 Raj 822 = (AIR
1955 Raj 65), Mt. Binda Kuer v. Lalita Prasad, AIR
1936 PC 304, Seetharama Chandra Row v.
Kanchumarthi Raju. AIR 1925 PC 201, Rajendro Nath
v. Jogendro Nath, (1870) 14 Moo Ind. aPP 67 (PC) and
Kailash Chandra Nag v. Bejoy Chandra Nag., AIR 1923
Cal 18.”
25.

Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court

has also considered this issue in the case of Surajbai Vs.
Sadashiv Jugal Kishore AIR 1958 MP 100 and held that where
alleged adoption is an old one and has taken place many years
ago strict proof of giving and taking or performance of the
ceremonies necessary to constitute valid adoption is not
necessary. It was further held that even very slight evidence
establishing that alleged adopted son has been treated as such
for long series of years by the foster family is sufficient proof in
cases of old adoptions.
26.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court in the afore said

case had relied on a judgment in the case of Dal Bahadur Singh
Vs. Bijai Bahadur Singh AIR 1930 PC 79 wherein the Privy Court'
has held that onus of proving the adoption is on the part of
setting it up but it is also true that if the plaintiff's adoption is
old one and the plaintiff has been treated as adopted son by
RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 12 of 16

the member of the family and in public transaction then
presumption arises in his favour.
27.

In the decision reported as AIR 1976 Ori 43

Gouranga Sahu & Ors v Bhaga Sahu & Anr the Orissa High
Court observed as under:-

28.

"Though the normal rule is that one who seeks to
deflect the natural line of succession to property by
alleging adoption must discharge that burden, in
eases of ancient adoption every allowance for the
absence of evidence to prove such fact must be
favourably entertained and where there is long lapse
of 36 years between the adoption and the time of its
being questioned and during that period of
interregnum a variety of transactions of open life and
conduct on the footing that the adoption was a valid
act have taken place, the initial burden necessarily
shifts to the person who challenges its validity."
But while considering evidence pertaining

to

adoption in the distant past where natural parents of the
person claiming to be given in adoption are alive, it is desirable
to examine the natural parents and if they are not examined an
adverse inference could be drawn against the person claiming
to be given in adoption.
29.

To put it pithly, law requires best evidence to be

brought on record.
30.

In the decision reported as Jogendra Vs. Jahaja

Baliar Singh AIR 2007 Orissa 142 it was observed that in order
to establish factum and validity of an adoption it is always
desirable to examine natural parents of the adopted child.
RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 13 of 16

31.

In the decision reported as Sita Ram Vs. Shankar Lal

2007 (1) AWC 357 the Allahabad High Court has held that
where natural parents are not examined and there is no
justifiable cause for such non examination, the courts must
draw an adverse inference against the person who sets up the
claim of adoption.
32.

In the instant case the appellant did not examine his

natural parents event though they were alive during the trial of
the suits in question. No explanation has been given by the
appellant as regards non examination of his natural parents.
33.

In the instant case save and except the settlement

deed Ex.DW1/A there is no other evidence showing that the
appellant was either treated as son of the deceased or member
of the family of the deceased. Even the said settlement deed
does not clearly records that the appellant was the adopted son
of the deceased.
34.

As regards the fact that the appellant was residing

with the deceased and his family since last 20-25 years is
concerned, suffice would it be to note that the appellant was
the son of the brother of the deceased. It is quite common in
Indian society that nephews reside with their uncles. Thus, the
mere fact that he was residing with the deceased does not

RSA Nos. 119/2002 & 120/2002

Page 14 of 16

establish that the deceased or his family treated him as their
adopted son.
35.

Appellant could have successfully established his

relationship with the deceased and his family by getting
examined relatives, friends and neighbours of the deceased
and his family. But no such evidence was led by the appellant.
36.

Documents such as ration card etc. could have been

placed on record by the appellant to establish that he was the
adopted son of the deceased. Ration card if filed would have
been a clinching evidence clearly establishing the relationship
of the appellant with the deceased and his family.
37.

In view of above discussion I thus hold that that the

appellant has not been able to prove by leading positive and
acceptable evidence that he was the adopted son of the
deceased. The solitary evidence of settlement deed Ex.DW1/A
dated 10.9.1951 does not meet the legal requirements relating
to proof of an adoption.
38.

The judgment and decree dated 18.5.2002 passed

by the learned Appellate Court is affirmed.
39.

There is no merits in the appeals.

40.

The same are dismissed.

41.

No costs.
