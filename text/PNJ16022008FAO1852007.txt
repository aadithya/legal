PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

The appellant is aggrieved by the order dated

7.4.2007 declining interim relief to the appellant.
2.

Briefly stated case of the appellant was that he

along with Rama Kant Aggarwal and Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal,
impleaded as defendants No.1 and 2 in the suit were partners
of the firm M/s.Kanishka Builders vide a deed of partnership
dated 15.1.1998.

It was stated that the partnership firm

entered into a collaboration agreement with the owner of
FAO 185/07

page 1 of 6

property bearing No.G-1/5, Model Town-III, Delhi as per which
on construction of a new building certain flats on different
floors were to be the property of the partnership firm and the
remaining of the owners of the land. It was stated that apart
from other flats, Flat No.14 on the first floor and Flat No.33 on
the third floor were assigned to the partnership firm. It was
further stated that on construction of the building, save and
except Flat Nos.14 and 33 other flats falling to the share of the
partnership firm were sold but money was dishonestly
misappropriated by Rama Kant Aggarwal and Mahesh Kumar
Aggarwal.

Pertaining to Flat No.33 it was averred that all 3

partners joined in the sale of the flat to Amit Aggarwal and his
father S.N.Aggarwal impleaded as defendants No.3 and 4
respectively. The sale being through an agreement to sell and
a general power of attorney, the general power of attorney was
executed in favour of S.N.Aggarwal.

Other documents were

executed in favour of Amit Aggarwal. It was further stated that
the sale consideration in sum of Rs.9 lacs was tendered by 3
cheques in the name of the partnership firm but later on, the
issuer of the cheques, namely Amit Aggarwal colluded with
Rama Kant Aggarwal and Mahesh Aggarwal by striking off the
name of the payee i.e. M/s.Kanishka Builders and re-writing
thereon Rama Kant Aggarwal as the payee. The
FAO 185/07

cutting and

re-writing was initialled by Amit Aggarwal. It was accordingly
averred

that

Rama

Kant

Aggarwal

and

Mahesh

Kumar

Aggarwal in collusion with S.N.Aggarwal and Amit Aggarwal
had deprived the appellant of his share in the money which
was to be received by the partnership firm, but was instead
received by Rama Kant Aggarwal.
3.

The suit sought rendition of accounts cancellation of

the sale documents pertaining to flat No.33 was prayed for. A
decree of permanent injunction was also prayed for to restrain
S.N.Aggarwal and Amit Aggarwal from further alienating the
flat.
4.

S.N.Aggarwal and Amit Aggarwal relied upon a

receipt which contained the terminal endorsement as under:'All cheques are drawn in favour of Shri Rama
Kant Aggarwal'
5.

Declining relief, learned Trial Judge has opined that

S.N.Aggarwal and Amit Aggarwal were bona fide purchasers for
valuable consideration and hence injunction could not be
granted against them.

It has been held that right of the

plaintiff is against his partners.
6.

The core issue which needed to be concentrated

upon by the learned Trial Court, for purposes of interim
injunction, was whether S.N.Aggarwal and Amit Aggarwal have

FAO 185/07

page 3 of 6

colluded with Rama Kant Aggarwal and Mahesh Aggarwal for
interpolating the receipt as also on the 3 cheques issued in
sum of Rs.3 lacs each as sale consideration.
7.

It is not in dispute that as per sale documents the 3

cheques have been tendered as sale consideration of the flat
to the partnership firm.
8.

In a criminal proceeding between the parties the

receipt relied upon by S.N.Aggarwal and Amit Aggarwal was
sent to the CFSL Laboratory for opinion whether the transcript
'All cheques are drawn in favour of Shri Rama Kant Aggarwal'
was an interpolation or not.
9.

CFSL report (page 64 of the appeal paper book

record) records that the typed script portions marked Q1-Q2
have been subsequently added. The said marked portions are
the afore-noted words in the receipt.
10.

Photocopy

of

the

receipt

relied

upon

by

S.N.Aggarwal and Amit Aggarwal has been shown to me. The
words 'Industrial Complex, Delhi.' precede the words 'All
cheques are drawn in favour of Shri Rama Kant Aggarwal'. A
visual look at the receipt evidences that the alignment of the
words 'All cheques are drawn in favour of' is a little above the
straight line of the alignment of the preceding 3 words
'Industrial Complex, Delhi.'.

11.

Prima facie it is a case where S.N.Aggarwal and

Amit Aggarwal have colluded with Rama Kant Aggarwal.
Collusion being, after issuing the cheques in the name of the
partnership firm they have changed the name of the payee to
Rama Kant Aggarwal. In the receipt issued by the 3 partners
of the firm, an interpolation has been made. In this connection
it is important to note that as per the plaintiff/appellant
S.N.Aggarwal is related to Rama Kant Aggarwal through blood.
Relationship being that Rama Kant Aggarwal is the nephew of
S.N.Aggarwal. Needless to state the respondents dispute the
relationship.
12.
discussed

Unfortunately, the learned Trial Judge has nowhere
the

interpolation

on

the

cheques

and

the

interpolation on the receipt relied upon by the respondents as
also the CFSL report. Prima facie, respondents No.3 and 4 are
instrumental in respondents No.1 and 2 siphoning off the funds
of the partnership firm.
13.

Under

the

circumstances,

appellant

would

be

entitled to an interim injunction restraining the defendants of
the suit from transferring, alienating, encumbering or parting
with possession of Flat No.33 in the building bearing Municipal
No.G-1/5, Model Town-III, Delhi.

14.

Before concluding I may note that observations in

the present order are a prima facie opinion of this Court and
not to be treated as a conclusive opinion on the matter in
issue. Needless to state at the end the trial learned Trial Court
would adjudicate the suit in light of the evidence brought on
record.
15.

LCR be returned forthwith.

16.

No costs.
