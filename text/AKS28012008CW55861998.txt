A.K. SIKRI, J.
1.
When this petition came up for hearing on 4.1.2008, orders
were reserved and permission was given to learned counsel for
the petitioner to file written submissions, if any, within one
week.

However, we waited for over two weeks, but the same

were not filed. Since we heard the matter on merits, we are now
proceeding to decide the issue involved vide this judgment.
2.

The petitioner had filed the aforesaid writ petition claiming
pensionary benefits from the date of his discharge from service.
After hearing the counsel for the parties, this petition was
dismissed vide orders dated 7.9.2001. Almost one and a half
years thereafter, i.e. in February 2003, the present application
was filed seeking modification of the said orders dated

CM 2458/03 in WP 5586/98

7.9.2001. Before we advert to the contents of the application
and the nature of modification which the petitioner is seeking, it
would be appropriate to restate the nature of order passed on
7.9.2001.

3.

The petitioner had joined the Border Security Force (BSF) on
21.9.1965. However, after some years of service he submitted
his resignation and his request for voluntary retirement was
accepted.

He, thus, ceased to be in the service of BSF with

effect from 26.6.1976. In this way, the petitioner rendered 10
years and 9 months of service.

4.

It is not in dispute that a person has to have a minimum of 20
years of service, as provided in Rule 48-A of the CCS (Pension)
Rules. The petitioner admittedly had not

completed

the

qualifying service on the basis of which he could earn pension
and, therefore, this benefit was not accorded to him. However,
22 years after his discharge, the petitioner preferred the
aforesaid writ petition stating that even if service rendered by
him was less than 20 years, he should be given pro-rata pension
on the basis of service rendered by him. It is this relief which
was denied to the petitioner by this Court in its order dated
7.9.2001 holding that the petitioner cannot be given any such
pro-rata pension.

The Court referred to the judgment of the

Apex Court in the case of Union of India & Ors. v. Rakesh
Kumar, (2001) 4 SCC 309 and on the basis of this judgment it
was held that the petitioner, who had resigned from service
before completing the statutory period of qualifying service, was
CM 2458/03 in WP 5586/98

not entitled to get any pension.
5.

In the application for modification it is alleged that the case of
the petitioner is wrongly decided. It is further alleged that this
Court had took up the case on its own motion on 3.9.2001 and
passed an ex-parte judgment relying upon the judgment in the
case of Rakesh Kumar (supra), which is not applicable in the
instant case.

6.

We find from the order dated 7.9.2001 that no doubt the
petition was listed on 3.9.2001 and nobody had appeared on
behalf of the parties on that date.

However, thereafter the

petition was directed to be listed on 7.9.2001 and on that date
counsel for both the parties appeared. Ms. Santosh Singh, who
was

the

counsel

for

the

petitioner,

duly appeared

and

represented the petitioner and argued the case on his behalf. It
is only after hearing both the counsel that the order was passed
on 7.9.2001. It is, therefore, totally wrong on the part of the
petitioner to alleged that an ex-parte order was passed.
7.

Insofar as contention of the petitioner that judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of Rakesh Kumar (supra) is not
applicable is concerned, that would not be a ground for seeking
modification of the order. In essence, the petitioner is seeking
review of the said judgment. Such a contention is not available
even for the purpose of seeking review inasmuch as if the
petitioner feels that the case is wrongly decided, his remedy was
to challenge the order. Even otherwise, review application can
be filed within 10 days whereas the present application was filed
almost 1Â½ years after the passing of the order dated 7.9.2001

and is, thus, clearly time barred.
8.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has sought to argue the case
afresh and wanted liberal interpretation to be given to Rule 48-A
of the CCS (Pension) Rules. He referred to the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of Madan Singh Shekhawat v. Union
of India & Ors., (1999) 6 SCC 459. That was a case where the
Court was concerned with the grant of disability pension which
was denied to the appellant therein on the ground that he was
not on duty because the journey being performed by him on
leave was not 'at public expense'.

The Court held that the

appellant could not be denied disability pension by giving a
liberal interpretation to the expression 'at public expense' and
the appellant should be treated on duty and, therefore, was held
that the appellant was entitled to disability pension.
9.

We fail to understand how such a judgment is applicable to the
fact situation insofar as the present case is concerned. Rule 48A, in no uncertain terms, lays down the eligibility condition for
earning pension, namely, minimum service of 20 years. By no
stretch of imagination it can be said that a person who has
rendered less service and is not even eligible for pension should
be given pro-rata pension.

10.

The case was then argued referring to Rule 19 of the BSF Rules,
1969 which deals with 'Resignation'. The petitioner cannot seek
shelter under this Rule to get pro-rata pension only because he
was allowed to resign from the Force having regard to the
special circumstances. This provision only permits the Central
Government to accept the request of an officer of the Force to

CM 2458/03 in WP 5586/98

nsk

Page 4 of 5

resign

from

the

Force

having

regard

to

the

special

circumstances. If there are no such special circumstances, an
officer is not even entitled to resign.

Thus, one cannot take

advantage of this Rule for interpreting Rule 48-A of the CCS
(Pension) Rules and advance an argument that simply because
he was allowed to resign before he put in minimum 20 years of
service, to earn pension he should now be given pro-rata
pension.
11.

Therefore, even on merits we do not find any force in this
application and, accordingly, dismiss the same.
