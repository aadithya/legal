BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J
1.
This order shall dispose of the above mentioned four
applications.

IA 2357/2007 is an application for amendment of IA

7295/2006 which has been filed under Order 9 Rules 7 and 13 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'the CPC').
This application seeks to carry out minor amendments and the same is
allowed. The amended application is taken on record.

2.

IA No.7295/2006 and 2358/2007 are taken up together. As

mentioned above, IA 7295/2006 is an application under Order 9 Rules 7
and 13 for setting aside the ex parte decree dated 14.12.2005 as also the
ex parte order dated 23.01.2004. These applications have been filed on
behalf of the defendant No.1. IA 2358/2007 is an application under
Section 5 of the Limitation Act for condoning the delay in filing IA
No.7295/2006.

3.

The summons issued to the defendant No.1 was served upon

defendant No.1 on 28.02.2003. Since nobody appeared on behalf of the
defendant No.1, this court passed an order directing the suit to proceed
ex parte as against the said defendant on 23.01.2004.

As per the

defendant No.1, the reason for non-appearance on 23.01.2004 as well as
on other dates was that the matter being a cargo claim arising out of
Airway Bills issued at Mumbai had been entrusted to the Cargo
Manager, Mumbai of the defendant No.2, namely, Mr Rettiganti. As per
the said defendant No.1, there was correspondence between the plaintiff
and the said Mr Rettiganti. It is also submitted that at the relevant time
Mr Rettiganti was suffering from cancer and he eventually died on

IA Nos.7295/06& Ors in CS(OS)2035/2002

Page No.2 of 7

25.10.2003. It was submitted on behalf of the defendant No.1 that in all
probability, Mr Rettiganti was unable to give due attention to this matter
on account of his ill health. Even after his death on 25.10.2003, no steps
were taken by the defendant No.1 to put in appearance before this court
or to take appropriate steps for setting aside of the decree within the
limitation period of 30 days as the file and other related documents
pertaining to this matter were not found at Mr Rettiganti's work station
after his death. It is, therefore, submitted that his successor remained
unaware of the pendency of this matter till the defendant No.1 received a
copy of the ex parte decree at its Mumbai office in the first week of June,
2006, which was presumably sent by the plaintiff. It was also submitted
that as soon as the copy of the ex parte decree was received by the
defendant No.1, steps were taken for setting aside of the same.

4.

Reliance was placed by the defendant No.1 on a decision of a

learned single Judge of this court in the case of Indradhanush T.V. Pvt.
Ltd. (M/s.) v. National Film Development Corporation: 2006 III AD
(Delhi) 104. At the outset, I may state that this decision would not be
applicable and / or relevant to the present case inasmuch as it is a
decision rendered in respect of Order 8 Rule 1 CPC, whereas the present

IA Nos.7295/06& Ors in CS(OS)2035/2002

Page No.3 of 7

case is one under Order 9 Rules 7 and 13 CPC. A plain reading of Order
9 Rule 13 would indicate that an ex parte decree may be set aside if the
court is satisfied that the summons was not duly served or that the
defendant was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when
the suit was called on for hearing. In the present case, it is an admitted
position that the summons had been duly served, therefore, it is
incumbent upon the defendant No.1 to establish and satisfy this court
that the defendant No.1 was prevented by sufficient cause from
appearing when the suit was called on for hearing. The only reason
given by the defendant No.1 is that when the summons were received,
the Cargo Manager (Mr Rettiganti) was suffering from cancer and that he
ultimately died on 25.10.2003. And that, it is because of this that the
defendant was prevented from appearing before this court when the suit
was called on for hearing.

5.

In G.P. Srivastava v. R.K. Raizada and Others: 2000 (3)

SCC 54, the Supreme Court observed that unless sufficient cause is
shown for non-appearance of the defendant in the case on the date of
hearing, the court has no power to set aside an ex parte decree.
However, the Supreme Court also observed that the words “was

IA Nos.7295/06& Ors in CS(OS)2035/2002

Page No.4 of 7

prevented by any sufficient cause for appearing” must be liberally
construed to enable the court to do complete justice between the parties
particularly when no negligence or inaction is imputable to the erring
party. Sufficient cause for the purpose of Order 9 Rule 13 has to be
construed as an elastic expression for which no hard and fast guideline
can be prescribed. The courts have a wide discretion in deciding the
sufficient cause keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of
each case.

It was also pointed out that “sufficient cause” for non-

appearance refers to the date on which the absence was made a ground
for proceeding ex parte and cannot be stretched to rely upon other
circumstances anterior in time. If “sufficient cause” is made out for nonappearance of the defendant on the date fixed for hearing when ex parte
proceedings were initiated against him, he cannot be penalised for his
previous negligence which had been overlooked and thereby condoned
earlier.

6.

The facts of the present case need to be considered in the

context of these observations.

Admittedly, the defendant No.1 was

served with the summons in February, 2003. Mr Rettiganti, the alleged
Cargo Manager expired on 25.10.2003. The date on which the court

IA Nos.7295/06& Ors in CS(OS)2035/2002

Page No.5 of 7

passed an order for proceeding ex parte against the said defendant was
23.01.2004.

The suit itself was decreed on 14.12.2005 and the

application for setting aside the ex parte decree was filed on 01.07.2006.
Apart from the purported explanation of Mr Rettiganti's ill health and
ultimate death, there is no explanation forthcoming during the period
February, 2003 to 01.07.2006. The defendant No.1 is a well-established
international Airline and it cannot be expected that when the summons
have been duly served, only one person would be in the know of such
service of summons and that he would not act upon the same at all. The
death of Mr Rettiganti is unfortunate as is the death of any person, but
his death cannot be cited as an excuse for non-appearance. It is also not
established as to how Mr Rettiganti alone was looking after this case.
The explanation sought to be given by the defendant No.1 does not at all
appear to be plausible and is also bereft of particulars. The submission
made by the learned counsel for the defendant No.1 that, in all
probability, Mr Rettiganti was unable to give due attention to the matter
on account of his ill health is also nothing but surmise and conjuncture.
The fact of the matter is that the summons were duly served and that the
defendant has been unable to satisfy this court that it was prevented by
sufficient cause from appearing before this court on the date on which

IA Nos.7295/06& Ors in CS(OS)2035/2002

Page No.6 of 7

the suit was called on for hearing. This being the case, this court has no
power to set aside the ex parte decree. Accordingly, IA Nos.7295/2006
& 2358/2007 are dismissed. Consequently, IA No.2359/2007 is also
liable to be dismissed and it is so dismissed.
