ANIL KUMAR, J.

1.

The petitioner has impugned the award dated 25th July, 2007

dismissing his claim for regularization and declining his claim for
payment of wages as per the wages payable to regular employees.

2.

The Ministry of Labour by its letter No.L-40011/27/2001 (IR (DU)

Central Government dated 07/23.01.2002 had made the following
reference:

WP (C) 1640 of 2008

Page 1 of 6

“Whether the action of the General Manager, Videsh
Sanchar Nigam Limited, Greater Kailash, Part-I, New Delhi110048 in verbally stopping from duty w.e.f. 31.10.1999 to
Shri Roop Chand, Lift Operator, instead of regularizing his
services and not paying him wages as per their regular
employee, is justified? If no, to what relief the workman is
entitled to.”

3.

The petitioner claimed that he had been employed by the

respondent as a Lift Operator and his last drawn salary was Rs.2,200/per month which was less than the minimum wages as per the labor
laws. The petitioner contended that during the course of his
employment he was not provided all the legal benefits and since the
petitioner demanded the legal benefits, the management got annoyed
and on 31st October, 1999, the services of the petitioner were
terminated without assigning any reason and without paying the earned
salary of the months of August, September and October 1999.

4.

The claim of the petitioner was contested by the respondent

contending that the petitioner was never employed as a Lift Operator
since 8th July, 1998 as has been alleged by the petitioner. It was
contended that the petitioner had been carrying out some specific work
of repairs of lifts etc. in October 1998 to December 1998 and thereafter
during the period 15th April, 1999 to 15th June, 1999 and the petitioner
was paid the amount in cash for the works done by him. The petitioner
WP (C) 1640 of 2008

Page 2 of 6

had executed the receipts in the name of Roop Singh as well as Roop
Chand.

Regarding the gate passes produced by the petitioner, it was

contended that M/s.OTIS Limited, supplier of lifts, was providing
maintenance and the petitioner frequently visited along with the
Technician of M/s. OTIS Limited.

The gate passes issued to the

petitioner to carry out the material were in fact issued to M/s. OTIS
Limited

who

were

doing

the

maintenance

work.

In

these

circumstances, it was asserted that the petitioner was never employed
by the respondent on daily wages nor the petitioner had carried out
work for more than 240 days.

5.

The Central Government Industrial Tribunal cum Labour Court –

II dismissed the claim on the ground that the petitioner has not been
able to prove that he worked for 240 days so as to attract the provision
of Section 25 F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

6.

The learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on the cash bills

dated 2nd November, 1998 under which the petitioner was paid an
amount of Rs.2,100/- for running and cleaning the lift. Similar is the
receipt for the month of November 1998 and December 1998. From the
receipts produced by the petitioner, it is apparent that the petitioner
was not engaged as a daily wager as a Lift Operator as the amounts
WP (C) 1640 of 2008

Page 3 of 6

have been paid to the petitioner mainly for the repair of the lift.

In any

case, from the documents produced by the petitioner, it cannot be
inferred that the petitioner had worked for more than 240 days in a
year. The petitioner is unable to refute the averment of the respondent
that he worked during the period of October 1998, December 1998 and
from 15th April, 1999 to 15th June, 1999 only. In the circumstances,
the inference drawn by the Central Government Industrial Tribunal
cum Labour Court – II that the petitioner has not been able to show
that he had worked for 240 days cannot be termed to be perverse or
suffering from any manifest error.

There are no grounds to interfere

with the findings of the Central Government Industrial Tribunal cum
Labour Court – II, in the circumstances, in exercise of jurisdiction
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

7.

The findings and inferences of the Tribunal are based on evidence

and documents on record and there does not appear to be any manifest
errors in them. This court in exercise of its jurisdiction under article
226 of Constitution of India is not to substitute its own inferences with
the inferences drawn by the Labor Court. In (2006) 2 SCC 373 , at page
378 Govt. of A.P. v. Mohd. Nasrullah Khan the Supreme court had held:

11. By now it is a well-established principle of law that the
High Court exercising power of judicial review under Article
WP (C) 1640 of 2008

Page 4 of 6

226 of the Constitution does not act as an appellate
authority. Its jurisdiction is circumscribed and confined to
correct errors of law or procedural error, if any, resulting in
manifest miscarriage of justice or violation of principles of
natural justice. Judicial review is not akin to adjudication
on merit by reappreciating the evidence as an appellate
authority.

8.

Thus it is a settled position of law that in exercise of jurisdiction

under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the High Court is not
interfere with factual findings of the lower courts and should restrain
itself from re-appreciating evidence while exercising powers of judicial
review.

Writ court is not to interfere with the orders of an inferior

tribunal or subordinate court unless their order suffers from an error of
jurisdiction or from a breach of the principles of natural justice or is
vitiated by a manifest or apparent error of law. The objective of judicial
review is that a person receives a fair treatment and objective is not to
re-appreciate the entire pleas and evidence and draw inferences again.
Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the
manner in which the decision is made. Power of judicial review is meant
to ensure that the individual receives fair treatment and not to ensure
that the conclusion which the authority reaches is necessarily correct in
the eye of the court.

9.

The documents produced by the petitioner do not show that he

worked for more than 240 days and the receipt produced by the
petitioner also show that the amounts paid to him were mainly for
repairs and in the circumstances, the inference of the Tribunal that the
petitioner was not engaged on daily wages cannot be faulted in the facts
and circumstances to be interfered in exercise of jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The writ petition in the facts
and circumstances, therefore, is without any merit and it is dismissed.
