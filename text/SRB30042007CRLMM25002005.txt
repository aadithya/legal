Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat (Open Court)

COM. CASE. 263/2003
U/S: 29 (2) DDA ACT
1.
The petitioner claims a quashing order in respect of a complaint filed by
the Delhi Development Authority alleging commission of offence under Section
29 of the Delhi Development Act.
2.

The complaint of the DDA was that Ms. Aruna V. Kumar was using the

premises being a residential flat for unauthorized/commercial purposes. The
complaint alleged that the first petitioner Aruna V. Kumar and her daughter
(second petitioner) were partners of M/s Aruna V. Kumar & Co. and were
CRL.M.C. 2500/2005, CRL.M.C. 2501/2005

1 of 5

carrying on business/ commercial activities which was impermissible.
3.

Despite issuance of notice on the respondents, there has been no

appearance in these proceedings by the DDA. Learned counsel relied upon the
order of this Court in CW 3425/2003 dated 22.10.03 to say that residents of the
locality concerned had filed writ petition levelling allegation that the petitioners
were misusing the premises, i. e. B-7, second floor, 12 Shyam Nath Complex, Civil
Lines. The Court had directed inspection by the DDA as well as the MCD. The
petition was disposed off without requiring either of the statutory authorities to
take any action against the petitioner.
4.

The relevant part of the order dated 22.10.03 reads as follows:
“Inspection has been carried out both by DDA and MCD and
the affidavit of the MCD has been filed in Court which is taken on
record.
The affidavit of the MCD states that one of the rooms is
being used by respondent Nos. 3 to 5 as their personal office.
Photographs have also been filed. It has been stated that under the
Master Plan, maximum of 25% of the area or 50 sq. mtrs.,
whichever is less, can be used for non-residential activity in
residential flats and property but the activity should be which does
not cause nuisance. It is stated that respondents No. 3 to 5 fall
within the parameters of the Master Plan.
The photographs filed by the DDA also show that really
speaking only one room is being used as an office though there are
files and papers kept on the tables in other rooms.
Respondents No. 3 to 5 on their affidavit have stated that
respondent No. 3 is the Honorary Secretary of Delhi Council of
Child Welfare and at times personal connected with the same visit
the residence of the petitioner and that is why one room is being
used as an office. Learned counsel for respondent Nos. 3 to 5 states
that the premises are being used and shall be used only in
accordance with the Master Plan.
In view of the aforesaid position, I find no reason to pass
any further direction in the writ petition especially in view of the
statement of learned counsel for respondents No. 3 to 5.
Writ Petition stands disposed of.”

It is submitted that since the complaint was filed before the order of this

Court, the trial Court ought not to have taken cognizance and that the DDA did
not act bona fide in proceedings with the complaint. Learned counsel urged that
the tenor of the complaint was that the first petitioner was carrying on
commercial activity - the DDA could not have said so and pursued with the
complaint after having admitted before the Court that the same petitioner was
using the premises for a social welfare activity i. e. working as Honorary Secretary
to the Council for Child Welfare, Delhi. It was further contended that the first
petitioner died during the pendency of the proceedings, and that the description
in the complaint, as if the petitioners were partners in a venture carrying on
commercial activity, was completely without basis. Counsel relied upon several
judgments to say that on the basis of unspecific and vague allegations, the
complaint could not have been proceeded with. He submitted that the Magistrate
issued the order on a cyclostyled order sheet which shows non-application of
mind.
6.

The records of CW No. 3425/03 had been called for by the previous order.

I have gone through those records. The order as is evident shows that stand of
the DDA after inspection of the premises was that it was being used for office
purposes, to wit,

the office of Honorary Secretary of the Council for Child

Welfare. The DDA had revealed its stand that the photographs and materials
relied upon by the DDA were that only one room in the premises were being used
for the purpose of an office. In any event, there was no question of the same
being used for any commercial activity. Equally, the DDA had nowhere stated
CRL.M.C. 2500/2005, CRL.M.C. 2501/2005

3 of 5

that either of the petitioners were members of a firm or carrying on any other
activity or business.
7.

Having considered the materials on record, it is evident that the complaint

was filed in July, 2003 on the basis of a sanction said to have been obtained on
24.07.03. The sanction and the complaint were on the alleged inspection on
04.06.03 carried out by the DDA. Later, however, the DDA reported to the Court
that no commercial activity was being carried out but that the petitioner used one
room in the premises for a welfare activity. In these circumstances, I am satisfied
that the criminal proceedings could not have been pressed in the manner the
DDA sought to do. The entire proceedings, from inception were an abuse of
process because after having suffered an order on 22.10.03 and allowed that to
become final, the DDA was under an obligation to have drooped the matter.
8.

The impugned order issuing process also, to my mind, betrays a

completely casual and mindless approach. This Court in at least two judgments,
namely, Flex Foods Ltd. -v- Registrar of Companies 1996 (37) DRJ 60 and also
in Charanjeet -v- DDA & Anr. 94 (2001) DLT 334 had under-scored the
requirement of application of judicial mind to materials and disclosure of such
application of mind on the face of the order. It was held that an order to be called
one such, should shows some semblance of judicial proceeding. Issuance of a
cyclostyled order cannot be called a judicial order. Such an order may perhaps be
appropriate in administrative proceedings.
9.

For the above reasons, this petition has to succeed.

It is accordingly

allowed. The criminal proceedings in complaint No. 263/2003 dated 30.07.03
