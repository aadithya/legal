1.

This is an application filed by the respondent/workman under

Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking direction to
the petitioner to pay full wages/minimum wages during the pendency
and before the final disposal of the writ petition. The respondent has
also sought for arrears of wages as per the last wages/minimum
wages from the date of the award dated 2nd January, 2004 till date.

The

respondent/applicant

contended

that

he

has

been

unemployed since 15th July, 2000, the date of termination of his
services, and being poor and jobless he is leading an extremely
miserable life as the means of livelihood have been taken away by the
petitioner arbitrarily and illegally.

3.

No reply to the application has been filed on behalf of

petitioner/non-applicant.

In

the

facts

and

circumstances

the

averments made in the application are deemed to be admitted as the
same have not been refuted by the petitioner/non applicant. The
learned counsel for the petitioner however orally submits that court
can decide the writ petition prior to deciding the application under
section 17B.

4.

Perusal of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

reveals that it comes into operation when an Award directing
reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further proceedings by the
employer. The statute requires satisfaction of the following four
conditions:
(i)

(ii)
(iii)

an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in proceedings in a High Court or the
Supreme Court;
during the pendency of such proceedings, employer
is required to pay full wages to the workman;
the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any

CM No.7999/2006 in W.P(C) No.12374/2005

Page 2 of 6

(iv)

maintenance allowance admissible to him under
any Rule;
such wages would be admissible only if the
workman had not been employed in any
establishment during such period and an affidavit
had been filed to such effect.

Thus under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, there
has to be an award directing reinstatement of the workman and the
court has to ascertain whether the workman was gainfully employed
in any establishment and once the court comes to the conclusion that
the workman was not gainfully employed then the court is bound to
grant relief to the workman in terms of the provision as laid down
under section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act. Also the Court
cannot go into the merits of the case/writ petition while deciding an
application under section 17B of the Act as was held in 86 (2000) DLT
510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander. In a
catena of cases the Apex Court has also held that the application
under section 17B should be disposed of expeditiously and before
deciding the writ petition. Thus the plea of the petitioner that the writ
petition be decided prior to deciding the application under section
17B is rejected.

5.

The preliminary consideration for making available such a relief

under Section 17B to a workman is to be found in the benevolent
purpose

of

the

enactment

the

CM No.7999/2006 in W.P(C) No.12374/2005

spirit,

intendment

and

Page 3 of 6

object

underlying which is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the
hardship which would be caused to a workman due to delay in the
implementation of an award directing reinstatement of his services on
account of the challenge made to it by the employer. Section 17B
recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body
and soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award
directing his reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment which is required to be
made by the employer to the workman has been held to be akin to a
subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor recoverable
from a workman even if the Award in his favor is set aside by the High
Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T.
Patel the Apex Court was of the view that the object under Section
17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain
extent, the hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay
in implementation of the Award.

6.

Moreover granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and

passing orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the
rule; refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the
relief could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of
jurisdictional error where there is no relationship of employer and

CM No.7999/2006 in W.P(C) No.12374/2005

Page 4 of 6

employee between the parties.

7.

In the present case the workman has categorically averred in

the application that he has been jobless since the date of termination
of his services.

In the facts and circumstances, the applicant

fulfills the criteria for availing the benefit under section 17B of the Act
and in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, if the
requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are
satisfied, no order can be passed denying the workman the benefit of
statutory provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947.

Consequently, the application of the workman/respondent

under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is allowed and
the petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or the minimum
wages whichever is higher from the date of award dated 2nd January,
2004. Arrears of last drawn wages or the minimum wages be paid
within six weeks. Future last drawn wages or the minimum wages be
paid by 10th of every month. Respondent/workman is also directed to
file an undertaking that in case the petition is allowed, the
respondent/workman

shall

refund/repay

to

the

petitioner

the

difference of last drawn wages and minimum wages within the time
allowed by this Court. The undertaking to this effect be filed by the
respondent/applicant within four weeks.
