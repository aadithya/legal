MADAN B. LOKUR, J.

The Revenue is aggrieved by an order dated 31st August,
2005 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench “E”,
New Delhi (the Tribunal) in IT (SS) A No.102/Del/1998 relevant for the
block period 1987-88 to 1997-98 (upto 6th November, 1996).

2.

The assessee carries on fishing activities in the high seas and

it appears that on the basis of some information available with the
Revenue, a search operation in respect of the assessee was conducted
under Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) on 6th
November, 1996. During the search operation, some documents were
seized and some fishing vessels/trawlers belonging to the assessee were
searched and a restraint order under Section 132(3) of the Act was
passed in respect of those vessels and served upon the concerned
persons.

3.

The restraint order under Section 132(3) of the Act was

extended on 30th March, 1997 upto 30th September, 1997 when no
further orders were passed.

4.

On 16th December, 1997 a notice was issued to the assessee

under Section 156BC of the Act to file a return for the block period
1.4.1986 to 6.11.1996. The return was filed by the assessee on 15th
September, 1998 and an assessment order was made on 30th September,
1998.

5.

In the meanwhile, a further search was conducted on the

fishing vessels/trawlers on 14th September, 1998. There was no seizure
but a panchnama was drawn up.

6.

The Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, in his

assessment order dated 30th September, 1998 levied tax on the assessee
against which an appeal was filed before the Tribunal. In the appellate
forum, the assessee raised an additional ground, which was permitted by
the Tribunal, to the effect that the assessment order passed on 30th
September, 1998 is without jurisdiction being barred by limitation as
provided under Section 158BE of the Act. This contention was accepted
by the Tribunal and it was held that the assessment order was invalid
with the result that the appeal filed by the assessee was allowed.

7.

Being aggrieved, the Revenue has filed this appeal under

Section 260A of the Act seeking the framing of some substantial
questions of law. In our opinion, no substantial question of law arises
for consideration since the issues raised are no longer res integra.

8.

The principal question that arises for consideration is

whether the last panchnama was drawn on 6th November, 1996 when
certain documents were seized by the Revenue and a restraint order was
passed in respect of the fishing vessels/trawlers under Section 132(3) of
the Act or whether the search and seizure operations concluded when a
panchnama was drawn up on 14th September, 1998. According to the
assessee, all proceedings concluded on 6th November, 1996 and the
proceedings on 14th September, 1998 were an eyewash intended only to
extend the period of limitation. The Revenue, of course, justifies the
drawing up of the panchnama on 14th September, 1998 and canvassed
that the period of limitation be calculated from that date.

9.

We find that on 6th November, 1996 some documents of the

assessee were seized and a panchnama drawn up on the same day after

ITA No.656/2006

Page 4 of 12

an inventory was made. On the same day, three trawlers belonging to
the assessee were subject to a restraint order under Section 132(3) of the
Act. Thereafter, absolutely no search or seizure took place in respect of
the assessee for more than one year and ten months. Eventually, on 14th
September, 1998 the search was completed and we have on record a
letter dated 15th September, 1998 issued by the Assistant Director of
Income Tax (Investigation), Belgaum to the Assistant Director of
Income Tax (Investigation), New Delhi in respect of the completion of
search. The opening sentences of this letter read as follows:“The search in the above group case was completed by me on
14-09-1998 as required by you. The completion of search
was mere formality as there were no PO in existence.”

10.

It is quite clear, on a reading of this letter, that what the

Revenue has done is to carry out some kind of a dummy search on 14th
September, 1998 even though there was no restraint order in respect of
the fishing trawlers and the dummy search was conducted by way of a
formality so as to extend the period of limitation for drawing up an
assessment order. Is this permissible?

11.

In Dr. C. Balakrishnan Nair v. Commissioner of Income-

ITA No.656/2006

Page 5 of 12

tax, [1999] 237 ITR 70, the Kerala High Court observed that the search
in that case was discontinued on 27th October, 1995 and resumed only
on 10th November, 1995. There was no cogent reason for the gap of
fourteen days and neither the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 nor the
Act nor the Income Tax Rules permitted the postponement of a search
for such a long period.

Keeping the affected parties in a state of

suspended animation about the probable continuation of search would
be agonising.

It was held that there must be some convincing reason

for not resuming the search immediately and absent such convincing
reasons, it was held that the second search was not legal or valid.

12.

Similarly, in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Mrs. Sandhya

P. Naik, [2002] 253 ITR 534, it was held by the Bombay High Court
that simply stating in the panchnama that the search is temporarily
suspended does not entitle the authorised officer to keep the search
proceedings alive by passing a restraint order under Section 132(3) of
the Act. In arriving at this conclusion, the Bombay High Court placed
reliance upon Sriram Jaiswal v. Union of India, [1989] 176 ITR 261
decided by the Allahabad High Court.

ITA No.656/2006

13.

A general consensus appears to have emerged among the

High Courts to the effect that a search under Section 132 of the Act
should be continuous and if it is discontinued and thereafter resumed,
then there must be a valid explanation for the gap. In so far as the
present is concerned, the facts on record show that prima facie there was
absolutely no justification for keeping the search pending for more than
one year and ten months without any semblance of any activity by the
Revenue.

14.

By way of justification for the hiatus, we were told by

learned counsel for the Revenue that there was a transfer of jurisdiction
in respect of some officers and enquiries were required to be made in
respect of the assets of the assessee and that is what resulted in the
break. These reasons are worth nothing for prolonging the search and
seizure operation for such a long period of time. The absence of any
cogent or valid explanation given by the Revenue for postponing the
search from 6th November, 1996 to 14th September, 1998 makes the
proceedings of the latter date completely unwarranted.

ITA No.656/2006

15.

To this must be added the fact that the letter dated 15th

September, 1998 sent by the Assistant Director of Income Tax
(Investigation), Belgaum to the Assistant Director of Income Tax
(Investigation), New Delhi clinches the issue. It has been categorically
stated in the letter that the search conducted was a mere formality since
there was no prohibitory order in existence.

The unarticulated

suggestion in this letter is that the Revenue carried out the search on
14th September, 1998 merely to extend the period of limitation and not
because it was necessary to conduct a search for making any recovery or
seizure. We agree with the conclusion of the Tribunal that this letter
clearly suggests that the search and seizure operation had come to an
end on 6th November, 1996 and that on 14th September, 1998 there was
no restraint order in respect of the fishing trawlers of the assessee and,
therefore, the search and panchnama drawn on 14th September, 1998
were not in accordance with law.

16.

This being the position, it cannot be said that the last

panchnama drawn up in respect of the search and seizure operation
pertaining to the assessee, in terms of Explanation 2 to Section 158BE

ITA No.656/2006

Page 8 of 12

of the Act, was drawn up on 14th September, 1998 – it was actually
drawn on 6th November, 1996 and the period of limitation must,
therefore, run from that date onwards.

17.

Learned counsel for the assessee contended that the restraint

order in respect of the fishing trawlers could not have been passed under
Section 132(3) of the Act but was required to be passed under Section
132(1) of the Act.

18.

The second proviso to Section 132(1) of the Act clearly lays

down that where it is not possible or practicable to take possession of
any valuable article or thing and remove it to a place due to its volume,
weight or other physical characteristics or due to its being of a
dangerous nature, then the authorised officer may serve on the owner or
the person who is in possession of that article or thing an order
restraining him from removing or parting or otherwise dealing with the
said article or thing except with the previous permission of the
authorised officer and such action shall be deemed to be a seizure of
such valuable article or thing. On the other hand, Section 132(3) of the

ITA No.656/2006

Page 9 of 12

Act comes into operation when it is not possible to seize any valuable
article or thing for reasons other than those mentioned in the second
proviso to sub-section (1) and by an Explanation added to Section
132(3) of the Act, it is made clear that the serving of an order under
Section 132(3) of the Act shall not be deemed to be a seizure of such
valuable article or thing.

19.

It is obvious that the fishing trawlers could not be seized by

reason of their volume or weight. Appropriately, therefore, an order
could be passed by the authorised officer only of deemed seizure under
Section 132(1) of the Act. Passing an order under Section 132(3) of the
Act was not at all warranted given the nature of the articles, that is,
fishing trawlers.

20.

In B.K. Nowlakha v. Union of India, [1991] 192 ITR 436,

this Court held that if a seizure is effected then an order is required to be
made under Section 132(5) of the Act but if there is no seizure and only
an order of restraint is passed under Section 132(3) of the Act, then
other consequences follow including the possibility of an extension of a

ITA No.656/2006

Page 10 of 12

restraint order under Section 132(8A) of the Act as it stood at the
relevant time. It was held that given the field of operation of the second
proviso to Section 132(1) of the Act, and the far reaching adverse effect
that a restraint order under Section 132(3) of the Act may have on the
business of an assessee, “the power under Section 132(3) cannot be so
exercised as to circumvent the provisions of Section 132(1) read with
sub-section (5) thereof.” The Bombay High Court reached the same
conclusion in Mrs. Sandhya P. Naik and added that this had become
more clear after the insertion of the Explanation to Section 132(3) of the
Act to the effect that a restraint order passed thereunder does not amount
to a seizure.

21.

Under the circumstances, we are clearly of the view that the

action for seizing the fishing trawlers ought to have been taken by the
Revenue under Section 132(1) of the Act and not under Section 132(3)
of the act. By merely resorting to a restraint order under Section 132(3)
of the Act, and that too only upto 30th September, 1997, the Revenue
could not have extended the time limit for passing an assessment order.

ITA No.656/2006

22.

Learned counsel for the assessee submitted, that even

otherwise, 14th September, 1998 cannot be the date of the last
panchnama because in fact no seizure was effected on that date. We do
not think it necessary to go into this question on the facts of the present
case. We also do not think it necessary to discuss the provisions of Rule
112(7) of the Income Tax Rules relied upon by learned counsel. The
reason for our not discussing this is because we have come to the
conclusion that the search and seizure operation actually concluded on
6th November, 1996 and the events that took place on 14th September,
1998 were a make-believe intended to extend the time limit, which was
not permissible.

23.

The issues raised being clearly settled, and since we find no

fault in the order passed by the Tribunal, in our opinion, no substantial
question of law arises for consideration.

24.

The appeal is dismissed.
