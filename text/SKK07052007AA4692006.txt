2. It is stated in the petition that the work of laying of cables in tender No.OFC-10
awarded by Telecommunication Consultancy India Limited to the petitioner
also involved the job work of laying of cables which was assigned to the
petitioner. The work could not be completed due to unavoidable reasons but
the respondent terminated the contract of the petitioner for laying of cables by
show cause notice and letter dated 22.5.2006. The petition states that despite
the aforesaid termination, the petitioner was asked to complete the work of
laying of cables on Jalandhar – Amritsar route, which was done by the
petitioner and the petitioner raised bills for the job done. The bills were not
paid and disputes have arisen in respect thereof.
3. It is the case of the petitioner that an amount of Rs.7,30,230.65 along with
interest @ 15 per cent per annum is due to the petitioner and despite notice the
respondent did not remit the amount. The respondent is also stated to have
encashed the bank guarantee furnished by the petitioner in terms of the
Memorandum of Understanding.
4. In view of the disputes having arisen, the petitioner vide letter dated 11.8.2006
invoked the arbitration clause and suggested the name of Shri S.K. Goyal as the
sole arbitrator, which was not acceptable to the respondent vide letter dated
17.8.2006. Hence the present petition has been filed.
5. The respondent entered appearance through counsel on 22.1.2007 and filed the

Power of Attorney. Four weeks time was granted to file the reply. No reply
was filed when the matter was listed on 22.3.2007 and the matter has thus been
placed before the Court. No reply has been filed till date. None has put an
appearance for the respondent. The result is that there is no opposition to the
averments made in the petition.
6. In view of the existence of the arbitration clause under the Memorandum of
Understanding dated 1.3.2004 and disputes having arisen as set out in the
petition by the petitioner, the same are liable to the referred to a sole arbitrator
to be appointed by the Court.
7. In view of the aforesaid, I appoint Shri H.P. Sharma, Additional District Judge
(Retd.) as the sole arbitrator to enter upon reference and adjudicate the disputes
between the parties. The arbitrator will fix the sitting fee subject to a maximum
fee of Rs.60,000.00 apart from out of pocket expenses to be borne equally by
both the parties. In case the respondent does not attend the proceedings or does
not pay the fee, the petitioner shall initially pay the fee, which shall form a part
of the main cause.
