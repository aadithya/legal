1.
the

The question involved in the present appeal is whether
will dated 6.10.1989 is the last legal and valid testament

executed by late Sh. Than Singh.
2.

Late Sh. Than Singh (hereinafter referred to as the

testator) who died on 15.1.1991 was survived by his widow Smt.
Birina Devi, 3 sons namely, Sh. Rohtas Singh, Sri Bhagwan and
Jaswant Singh and 1 daughter Smt. Sham Devi.
3.

On 19.4.19991 Rohtas Singh filed a petition under

Section 276 of the Indian Succession Act 1925 seeking probate of

FAO No.577/2002

Page 1 of 27

the will purported to have been executed by Than Singh on
6.10.1989. He was the principal beneficiary under the will.
4.

The will dated 6.10.1989, Ex. P-1, is a computer typed

document and consists of 6 sheets.
language.

It has been typed in English

It bears the thumb impression of the testator on each

page. It is a registered document.
5.

The will, Ex. P-1, has been witnessed by one Sh.

Devender Kumar Sharma, Advocate and one Sh. Naresh Kumar
Verma, Advocate.
6.

In the will it has been stated that while executing the

will the testator is revoking an earlier will executed by him on
21.8.1986, Ex.OW4/1. Reason given in Ex.P-1 for revoking the will
dated 21.8.1986 and bequeathing major portion of his estate in
favour of Rohtas Singh is the cruel behaviour of his two sons Jaswant
Singh and Sri Bhagwan and their families towards the testator and
his wife. It is further recorded that the said two sons were dishonest
and they were attempting to illegally grab the property owned by
the testator. It is further recorded that in the month of September
1987 said two sons threatened the testator to hand over the
property to them and also forcibly obtained his signatures on certain
documents. It is further recorded that one Sh. Baljit Singh who is a
relative of Sri Bhagwan, acting in connivance with the sons of the
testator have filed a false case against the testator.

9.

Defence set up by the objectors was that on 6.10.1989

the testator was bed ridden and was not having required
testamentary capacity to execute a will as he was suffering from a
paralytic attack. That the will was got executed from the testator by
the propounder by playing fraud and coercion upon him. That the
properties bequeathed under the will were ancestral properties and
not self acquired properties of the testator.

That the will dated

21.8.1986, Ex. OW-4/1, is the last legal and valid testament
executed by the testator.

That the testator never recovered after having suffered second
paralytic attack.

That in the year 1987-88 the testator was

examined and treated by one Dr. Kothari.

25.

G.V. Dass Advocate in his testimony as OW-4 deposed

about the attestation and due execution of the will dated 21.8.86
Ex.OW-4/1

by

the

testator.

Relevant

portion

of

the

cross

examination reads as under:“I have no personal knowledge about the pendency of
the LAC case regarding LAC case filed by the testator in
his life time volunteered. Now I remember that I had
filed a petition u/s 18 of the Land Acquisition Act before
the concerned LAC on the instructions of the testator. It
is correct that I had moved an application on behalf of
Than Singh and certified copy of the same is Ex. OW4/P1. Sh. Than Singh had not put his thumb mark at
point X on Ex. OW-4/P1 in my presence. Volunteered – I
had prepared the document Ex. OW-4/P1 and had given
it for signature/thumb mark on the testator Than Singh
to Sh. Rohtas Singh.................... Than Singh Used to
contact me in connection with his LAC case but I do not
remember about the frequency of his visits to me. I do
not remember whether the testator Sh. Than Singh had
contacted me on 5.12.1988, 10.7.1989, 12.7.1989,
18.4.1990, 4.5.1990 and 3.1.1991 immediately prior to
the date of hearing as well as after the date of
hearing........... Than Singh was coming to me only to
receive the vouchers of the compensation in the
company of Rohtas Singh applicant and all the three
sons were coming to the court on his behalf intervally i.e.
some time one son and sometime other son. Mr. Than
Singh was of sound disposing mind at the time of his
visits to me till 1980. (one thousand nine hundred and
eighty only). I cannot give any reply to the question
whether the testator had become a person of unsound
mind after 1980. The testator was alright and was of
sound mind whenever he came to me even after 1980.”
26.

Karan Singh in his testimony as OW-5 deposed about

the attestation and due execution of the will dated 21.8.86 Ex.OW4/1. Relevant portion of cross-examination of OW-5 reads as under:-

FAO No.577/2002

Page 10 of 27

“I used to meet Than Singh even in the year 1990 and
1989. In 1989-90 and he was suffering from old age and
cough etc. Otherwise he was alright.”
27.

Sri Bhagwan in his testimony as OW-6 deposed that the

testator suffered second heart attack in the year 1987-88. That the
testator never recovered after having suffered second paralytic
attack.

That from the time the testator suffered second heart

attack till his death he was residing with Rohtas Singh who did not
allow him and Sri Bhagwan to meet the testator That certain
litigations were pending by and against the testator. That the said
litigations were being prosecuted by the propounder on behalf of
the testator.
28.

Prehlad Singh OW-9 deposed that he can neither admit

nor deny the suggestion whether DD entry No.39 dated 30.9.1987
was recorded at the instance of the testator.
29.

On behalf of the objectors following documentary

evidence was led:i)

Ex. R-1........ DD Entry No.39 dated 30.9.1987.

ii)

Application dated 9.10.1990 filed by the propounder in

the High Court seeking his appointment as a guardian of the
testator as he was suffering from mental infirmities (It is an unexhibited document.

However propounder admitted having filed

said application)
iii)

Ex. OW-4/P1.......Being an application for payment of

compensation filed by the testator on 12.7.1989.
iv)

Ex. OW-4/P2....... Certified copy of order dated 10.7.1989

FAO No.577/2002

Page 11 of 27

passed by the learned Additional District Judge in LAC No.49/1993.
30.

After noting respective versions and evidence led by the

parties, vide impugned order dated 24.8.2002 learned Trial Court
has held that the propounder failed to prove the due execution of
the will dated 6.10.1989 Ex. P-1 by the testator and thus dismissed
the petition under Section 276 filed by the propounder.
31.

Aggrieved by the impugned order dated 24.8.2002

passed by the learned Trial Court the propounder of the will Ex.P-1
has filed the present appeal.
32.

Law relating to proof of the wills can be culled out as

under:I

A will is a solemn document, being written by a person

who is dead and who cannot be called in evidence to testify about
the due execution of the will. It is the living who have to establish
the will. It naturally throws a heavy burden on the court to satisfy
its judicial conscience that the burden of proof of due execution is
fully discharged and every suspicious circumstance explained.
II

The legal burden to prove due execution always lies

upon the person propounding a will. The propounder must satisfy
the judicial conscience of the court that the instrument so
propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator.
III

The onus is discharged by the propounder adducing

prima facie evidence proving the competence of the testator and
execution of the will in the manner contemplated by the law. The
contestant opposing the will may bring material on record meeting
FAO No.577/2002

Page 12 of 27

such prima facie in which event the onus would shift back on the
propounder to satisfy the Court affirmatively that the testator did
know well the contents of the will and in sound disposing capacity
executed the same. (see the decision of the Supreme Court in
Madhukar D. Shende v Tarabai Aba Shedge AIR 2002 SC 637)
IV

The requirement of proof of a will is same as any other

document excepting that the evidence tendered in proof of a will
should additionally satisfy the requirement of Section 63

of the

Indian Succession Act, 1925 and Section 68 of Indian Evidence Act,
1872. If after considering the matter before it, that is, the facts and
circumstances as emanating from the material available on record
of a given case the court either believes that the will was duly
executed by the testator or considers the existence of such facts so
probable that any prudent person ought under the circumstances of
that particular case, to act upon the supposition that the will was
duly executed by the testator, then the factum of execution of will
shall be set to have been proved.
V.

If a will is prepared and executed under circumstances

which raise a well grounded suspicion that the executor did not
express his mind under the will, probate
would not be granted unless that suspicion is removed.
VI

Circumstances can only raise a suspicion if they are

circumstances attending, or at least relevant to the preparation and
execution of the will itself.
VII

Suspicious circumstances are a presumption to hold

FAO No.577/2002

Page 13 of 27

against the will. Greater is the suspicion more heavy would be the
onus to be discharged by he who propounds the will.
VIII

Suspicion being a presumptive evidence, is a weak

evidence and can be dispelled.
IX

If there is nothing un-natural about the transaction and

the evidence adduced satisfies the requirement of proving a will the
court would not return a finding of “not proved” merely on account
of certain assumed suspicion or supposition. Who are the persons
propounding and supporting a will as against the person disputing
the will and the pleadings of the parties would be relevant and of
significance.
X

Well found suspicion may be a ground for closer scrutiny

of evidence but suspicion alone cannot form the foundation of a
judicial verdict-positive or negative.
33.

With the afore-said understanding of law, I shall test the

correctness of the impugned order dated 24.08.02.
34.

A perusal of the impugned order shows that the learned

Trial Court has held that the propounder has been able to establish
that the testator had executed the will Ex.P-1 in presence of two
attesting witnesses PW-1 and PW-2 but that the execution of the will
is surrounded by under-noted circumstances which cast a suspicion
upon the fact that the testator was in a state of sound disposing
mind at the time of the execution of the will:a)

Reasons given in the will Ex.P-1 for revoking will dated

21.8.86 Ex.OW-4/1 are the bad behaviour of Sri Bhagwan and
FAO No.577/2002

Page 14 of 27

Jaswant Singh towards the testator and their attempt to grab the
property of the testator. However from the documentary evidence
led by the propounder neither the bad behaviour of Jaswant Singh
nor any attempt by him to grab the property of the testator is
forthcoming.
b)

In the will, Ex. OW4/1, the plot bearing Municipal no. WZ-

60 is stated to be in the possession of Rohtas Singh and

Sri

Bhagwan while in the will Ex. P-1 the said plot is stated to be in the
possession of Rohtas Singh and some tenants. It has been opined
that the fact that wrong particulars are mentioned in the will Ex. P-1
suggests that the testator was not aware of the contents of the will
Ex.P-1.
c)

In the will Ex. OW4/1 the plot bearing Municipal no. WZ-6

was bequeathed by the testator in favour of three sons. However
under the will Ex. P-1 the said plot has been bequeathed in favour of
Rohtas Singh and his wife i.e. bequest was disproportionate.
d)

In the will, Ex. OW4/1, the properties bequeathed by the

testator were stated to be the ancestral properties while in the will
Ex. P-1 said properties are stated to be self acquired. It has been
opined that the fact that wrong particulars are mentioned in the will
Ex. P-1 suggests that the testator was not aware of the contents of
the will Ex.P-1.
e)

The fact that an application dated 9.1.90 was filed by

Rohtas Singh in the High Court of Delhi seeking his appointment as
a guardian of the testator for the reason the testator was mentally
FAO No.577/2002

Page 15 of 27

infirm goes to show that the testator was not having required
testamentary capacity at the time of the execution of the will Ex. P1.
f)

That Naresh Kumar Verma PW-2 stated during his cross-

examination that he did not know that the testator had given a copy
of the will Ex.OW4/1 to his senior Sh Gehlot. It has been opined that
this means that Sh. Gehlot was also associated in the preparation of
the will but it is no where the case of the propounder that Sh. Gehlot
was associated in the preparation of the will Ex.P-1.
g)

Jaswant Singh OW-2 deposed that Rohtas Singh used to

prosecute the Suit no.166/88 and LAC case no.49/93 on behalf of
the testator and that no suggestion was given to OW-2 in his crossexamination that Rohtas Singh was not prosecuting said cases on
behalf of the testator.
h)

D.K.Sharma PW-1 deposed that the testator, Naresh

Verma PW-2 and he were present at the time of the execution of the
will Ex.P-1. While Naresh Kumar Verma PW-2 deposed

that the

testator, his wife, D.K. Sharma PW-1 and he were present at the
time of the execution of the will Ex.P-1. It has been opined that
there is contradiction in the testimony of the witnesses.
i)

When questioned about the will Ex.OW4/1, Rohtas Singh

pleaded ignorance. Will Ex.OW4/1 finds mention in the Will Ex.P-1.
It has been opined that the fact that Rohtas Singh pleaded
ignorance about the will Ex.OW4/1 suggests that he was trying to
hide something.
FAO No.577/2002

Page 16 of 27

j)

In the Will Ex.P-1 it has been stated that the testator is

bequeathing major portion of his estate in favour of Rohtas Singh
because of his good behaviour towards the testator. Rohtas Singh in
his testimony as PW-4 denied the suggestion that will Ex.P-1 was
executed by the testator in his favour because of his good behaviour
towards the testator. It has been opined that this is against the
contents of the Will Ex.P-1 and thus raises doubts about its
genuineness.
k)

In the will Ex.P-1 it has been stated at the time of the

execution of the will the testator is residing with Rohtas Singh.
However Rohtas Singh in his testimony as PW-4 denied the
suggestion that the testator was residing with him at the time of the
execution of the Will Ex.P-1. It has been opined that this is also
against the contents of the Will ex.P-1 and thus raises doubts about
its genuineness.
l)

Testator was around 80 years old at the time of the

execution of the will Ex.P-1 and had suffered two paralytic strokes.
This raises a presumption that the testator was not in such a
physical condition to go to the chambers of D.K.Sharma, Advocate
PW-1 for execution of the will Ex.P-1 or to the chambers of Ravi
Kumar Aggarwal, Advocate PW-5 in connection with prosecution of
suit no.166/88.
35.

Before

examining

the

afore-noted

circumstances

enumerated by the learned Trial Court I note that the learned Trial
Court had not appreciated the evidence led by the parties in its
FAO No.577/2002

Page 17 of 27

correct perspective.
36.

A closer scrutiny of the evidence led by the objectors

shows that the version of the objectors that the testator was
phyisically infirm and was not in state of sound disposing mind at
the time of the execution of the Will. Ex-P1 as he was suffering from
a paralytic attack has no legs to stand for the reason evidence led
by the objectors suffers from the following defects:I.

OW-1, OW-2 and OW-6 deposed that the testator

suffered in a paralytic attack in the year 1987-88 while OW-3
deposed that the testator suffered paralytic attack one year before
his death i.e. in the year 1990.
II.

From

the

testimonies

of

OW-2

and

OW-6

it

is

forthcoming that the testator was being treated by one Dr.Kothari
and Dr.Sehra. It is further forthcoming from the testimony of OW-2
that Dr.Kothari was capable of giving evidence.

Had the doctors

who were treating the testators were examined by the objectors the
correct medical condition of the testator would have come to the
knowledge of the court. The non examination of the doctors of the
testator by the objectors leads to an adverse inference to be drawn
against the objectors.
III.

The orders dated 5.12.1988 Ex. P-1 and P-2 passed by

the learned Additional District Judge in LAC No.49/1993 shows that
on 5.12.1988 the testator along with Jai Dev OW-3 were present in
court. However Jai Dev in his cross examination deposed that the
testator was in not in a position to attend the court.
FAO No.577/2002

When

Page 18 of 27

questioned as to when the testator was not in a position to attend
the court he pleaded ignorance. Evidence of Jai Dev, OW-3 is thus
ipxi dixit in nature and in no way helps the case set up by the
objectors.

Ex.P-1 and Ex.P-2 evidence that on 5.12.1988 the

testator was physically fit and was present in court.
IV.

Exhibits P-1, P-4 and P-5 show that the testator was

present in the court on 5.12.1988, 18.4.1990, 4.5.1990 and
3.1.1991. G.V.Dass OW-4 in his cross examination stated that he do
not remember whether the testator contacted him around the time
of aforenoted dates. Ex.OW4/P2 shows that on 10.07.89 G.V. Dass
informed the court that his client i.e. the testator made a statement
in the court on 5.12.1988. Ex. P-2 shows that G.V. Dass was not
present in the court when the testator made a statement on
5.12.1988. How did G.V.Dass OW-4 became aware that the testator
made a statement in court on 5.12.1988 remains a mystery?
V.

G.V.Dass OW-4 in his cross examination further deposed

that all 3 sons of the testator used to come to the court in
connection with conduct of LAC No. 49/1993.

This testimony is

contrary to the stand taken by the objectors that LAC No. 49/1993
was prosecuted by Rohtas Singh on behalf of the testator.
VI.

G.V.Dass OW-4 during his cross examination also

deposed that the testator was in a state of sound disposing mind
during the time of his visits to him till the year 1980.

When

questioned about the condition of the testator after 1980 he first
pleaded ignorance and later replied the testator was alright and in a
FAO No.577/2002

Page 19 of 27

state of sound disposing mind during the time of his visits to him
even after 1980.

Evidence of G.V.Dass OW-4 is thus ipxi dixit in

nature and in no way helps the case set up by the objectors.
VII.

Karan

Singh

OW-5

in

his

cross

examination

has

categorically deposed that he used to meet the testator in the years
1989-90 and that in the years 1989-90 the testator was only
suffering from old age and cough but was otherwise alright. In view
of said testimony case set up by the objectors that the testator
never recovered after having suffered second paralytic attack
suffers a serious set back.
37.

Evidence led by the propounder and the attendant facts

and circumstances of the case strenghtens the case of the
propounder. My reasons for so holding are as under :I.

In the will Ex.P-1 one of the reasons for revoking the will

Ex.OW-4/1 is stated to be the cruel behaviour of Sri Bhagwan and
Jaswant Singh towards the testator and his wife.

The fact that

widow of the testator supported the will Ex.P-1 lends credence to
the contents of the will Ex.P-1.
II.

Another reason stated in the will Ex.P-1 for revoking the

will Ex.OW-4/1 is the attempt by Sri Bhagwan and Jaswant Singh in
the month of September, 1987 to illegally grab the properties of the
testator.

The fact that DD entry dated 30.9.1987 Ex.R-1 was

recorded in respect of the said incident lends credence to the
contents of the will Ex.P-1. The objectors have contended that DD
entry Ex.R-1 was recorded at the instance of the propounder and not
FAO No.577/2002

Page 20 of 27

the testator. However, the fact that the incident of 30.9.1987 finds
mention in the written statement dated 8.5.1989, Ex.PW5/RX2, filed
by the testator in Suit No.166/1988 strongly suggests that the DD
entry was recorded at the instance of the testator.
III.

The pleading in the written statement dated 8.5.1989

Ex. PW5/RX2 that the propounder gave a sum of Rs.75,000/- to the
testator so as to enable him to purchase a property goes to show
that the relations between the testator and the propounder were
very cordial.
IV.

The fact that the testator filed written statement

Ex.PW5/RX2 on 8.5.1989 strongly suggests that the testator
recovered after having suffered a paralytic attack and that he was
having required testamentary capacity around the time of execution
of the will dated 6.10.1989 Ex.P-1.
V.

The testimony of PW-5 that on 10.7.1989 testator visited

him in his chambers is strengthened by the fact that on said date
PW-5 made a statement in court on basis of which Suit No.166/1988
was dismissed as being infructous. There is a strong presumption
that PW-5 made said statement only after being instructed by the
testator. This establishes that the testator was in a state of sound
disposing on 10.07.89 as also around the time of the execution of
the will dated 6.10.89 Ex.P-1.
VI

To counter Exhibits PW5/RX2, PW5/RX3, P-1, P-2, P-4, P-5

and P-6

objectors pleaded that the suit no. 166/88 and LAC

no.49/93 were being prosecuted by the propounder on behalf of the
FAO No.577/2002

Page 21 of 27

testator. No suggestion was given either to Ravi Kumar Aggarwal,
Advocate PW- 5 or to GV Dass Advocate OW-4 that the said cases
were being prosecuted by the propounder on behalf of the testator.
This leads to an inference that the testator was prosecuting said two
cases himself.
VII.

Exhibits P-1, P-2, P-4, P-5 and P-6 records the presence

of the testator in the court on 5.12.88, 18.04.90, 04.05.90 and
03.09.91 respectively clearly leads to an inference that testator was
in a state of sound disposing mind around the time of the execution
of the Will Ex-P1.
38.

I may now deal with the circumstances enumerated by

the learned trial court as suspicious.
39.

As regards circumstance (a) suffice would it be to note

that when a person makes a statement that two persons were
involved in an incident and there is independent evidence that one
of the said two persons was involved in the said incident, the
presumption of truthfulness of the statement gets reinforced. The
case projected by the objectors was that they were having cordial
relations with the testator but Rohtas Singh with whom the testator
was residing prevented them from meeting the testator. In this
regards, the testimony of two witnesses of the objectors OW- 3 and
OW- 5 is important. OW- 3 Jaidev was the nephew of the testator
and OW- 5 Karan Singh was the neighbour of the testator. Both the
witnesses deposed that they were in regular contact with the
testator till his death. However, none of the said witnesses deposed
FAO No.577/2002

Page 22 of 27

that objectors were having cordial relations with the testator and
that the propounder prevented the objectors from meeting the
testator.
40.

Circumstance (b) is not suspicious for the reason there is

a time gap of nearly 3 years between the executions of the two
wills. The possibility that in the said period of 3 years the persons
who were in the possession of the plot could have been changed
cannot be ruled out. No evidence has been led by the objectors to
establish that Sri Bhagwan was in possession of the said plot at the
time of the execution of the will Ex. P-1.
41.

Circumstance (c) is not suspicious for the reason the

very reason for the execution of the will Ex.P-1 by the testator was
to change the bequest made in the will Ex.OW4/1. Furthermore the
reasons as to why testator changed the bequest are clearly stated in
the will Ex.P-1.
42.

Circumstance (d) is not suspicious for the reason a

perusal of the wills shows that the testator in both the wills stated
that he had rebuilt and renovated the said properties by his own
funds and that he is the absolute owner of the said properties. The
trial Judge has placed undue importance on the fact that in the will
Ex. OW4/1 testator has stated that he got the properties in
succession from his ancestors but has overlooked the fact the in the
very next sentence the testator has stated that he had rebuilt and
renovated the said properties from his own funds.
43.

While holding circumstance (e) as suspicious the learned

FAO No.577/2002

Page 23 of 27

trial court ignored the record of suit no 166/88 and LAC no 49/93. As
already noted the record of suit no.166/88 and LAC no

49/93

suggests that the testator was in a state of sound disposing mind
around the time of the execution of the will Ex.P-1. Trial Court
ignored the fact that suit no.166/88 and LAC case no.49/93 were
more proximate in time to execution of the will Ex.P-1 as compared
to application dated 9.10.90 filed by Rohtas Singh. Testator died on
15.1.91. Thus application dated 9.10.90 was more proximate in time
to the death of the testator. The probability is that the testator was
having required testamentary capacity at the time of the execution
of the will Ex.P-1 as evident from the record of suit no.166/88 and
LAC case no.49/93. That the health of the testator failed 4-5 months
before his death and that is why propounder moved application
dated 9.10.90 in the High Court of Delhi.
44.

Pertaining to circumstance (f) suffice would it be to note

a question was put to PW-2 in cross-examination whether the copy
of the Will Ex.P-1 was handed over by the testator to Sh. Gehlot.
PW-2 pleaded ignorance about the said fact. This cannot be a
suspicious circumstance in as much as PW-2 merely answered a
question put to him.
45.

Pertaining to circumstance (g) learned Trial Judge

overlooked the fact that objectors did not give any suggestion to
PW-5 and OW-4 advocates engaged by the testator that Rohtas
Singh used to prosecute the said two cases on behalf of the testator.
46.

As regards circumstance (h) the said contradiction

FAO No.577/2002

Page 24 of 27

between the testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2 is not so major so as to
be fatal to the genuineness of the will Ex.P-1. Will Ex.P-1 was
executed on 6.10.89. Examination-in-chief of PW-1 was conducted
on 4.5.94. While appreciating oral evidence it needs to be
remembered that witnesses forget minute details pertaining to a
fact/incident for the reason there is quite often a considerable time
interval between the happening of the fact/incident and recording of
evidence.
47.

As regards circumstance (i) i.e. Rohtas Singh by

pleading ignorance about the will Ex.OW4/1 meant that he had no
personal knowledge about the execution of the said will by his
father. The fact that the will Ex.OW4/1 finds a mention in the will
Ex.P-1 does not mean that Rohtas Singh was having personal
knowledge about the execution of the will Ex.OW4/1.
48.

As regards circumstance (j) suffice would it be to note

that a witness cannot be asked questions which are in the nature of
an opinion.
49.

As regards circumstance (k) suffice would it be to note

that scenario of parties trying to overstate or hide their cases is not
uncommon. It is quite possible that Rohtas Singh picked up a
rumor/gossip that a will is held to be not genuine if testator was
residing with the beneficiary at the time of the execution of the will
and thus deposed that the testator was not residing with him at the
time of the execution of the will dated 6.10.89 Ex.P-1.While
appreciating testimony of Rohtas Singh it is to be noted that he is a
FAO No.577/2002

Page 25 of 27

villager and thus could have easily been influenced/misled by
rumors/gossip etc.
50.

As regards circumstance (l) suffice would it be to note

that the said presumption drawn by the learned trial court is
contrary to Exhibits PW5/RX2, PW5/RX3. P-1, P-2, P-4, P-5 and P-6
which show that the testator used to appear in the court around the
time of the will Ex.P-1 and the testimony of OW-5 that the testator
was in an alright condition even in the years 1989-90.
51.

Objectors have miserably failed to prove that the

testator never recover after having suffered second paralytic attack
and the testator was not having required testamentary capacity at
the time of the execution of the will dated 6.10.1989 Ex. P-1. The
objectors have tried to hoodwink the court by taking advantage of
the fact that the testator suffered a paralytic attack sometime prior
to the execution of the will dated 6.10.89 Ex.P-1.
52.

On the other hand propounder by leading positive

evidence successfully established that the testator recovered after
having suffered second paralytic attack and that he was having
required testamentary capacity at the time of the execution of the
will Ex. P-1.
53.

In view of above discussion I hold that the will dated

6.10.1989 Ex.P-1 was duly executed by the testator and thus grant
letters of administration in respect of will dated 6.10.1989 Ex. P-1 in
favour of the propounder/appellant.
54.

The appeal is allowed. Petition filed by the appellant is

allowed.
55.

Impugned order dated 24.8.2002 is set aside.

56.

No costs.
