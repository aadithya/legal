DR.MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CHIEF JUSTICE: (ORAL)
1.

We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties on

this appeal and on the order under challenge which was passed by the
learned Single Judge in a Company Petition filed under Sections 433(e),
434 and 439 of the Companies Act directing that an amount of
Rs.2,11,232/- lying deposited in this Court be paid to the appellant and
that if any interest is accrued on the aforesaid amount, the same shall
also be paid to the appellant.

2.

The appellant is aggrieved by the aforesaid order on the ground

that he has not been paid interest for the period from 18th May, 2005
till the deposit was made in the Court. The petition was filed by the
appellant under Sections 433, 434 and 439 of the Companies Act with
a prayer that the respondent is unable to pay its debt.

Contention

raised before the learned Company Judge was that in 1997 cars and
coaches were given on hire / rent by the appellant to the respondent
company and invoices were raised and that a total amount of
Rs.3,63,730.05 towards hire / rental charges is due and payable by the
respondent.

The appellant has also stated that the respondent was

also liable to pay taxes and that in all an amount of Rs.4,85,944/- is
due and payable by the respondent to the appellant.

However,

deduction was also given by the appellant for an amount of
Rs.2,74,712/-. Finally it was stated in the said Company Petition that a
total amount of Rs.2,11,232/-, which is claimed, is due and payable by
the respondent to the appellant in terms of which a notice was issued
and thereafter the aforesaid petition was filed. The Court under order
dated 18th May, 2005 directed the respondent to deposit the said
amount of Rs.2,11,232/- in this Court, which the respondent company
has deposited.

The Company Court after hearing the parties under

order dated 13th July, 2006 directed that the aforesaid amount along
with the interest accrued thereon should be paid to the appellant.

3.

Therefore, the issue which is raised is as to whether or not the

respondent should be directed to pay interest for the period from 18th
May, 2005 till the date of deposit of the said amount in this Court. This
is not a recovery suit nor is it necessary for us to determine finally as
to what amount is due and payable and whether interest is also due
and payable in these proceedings. If the appellant is in any manner
aggrieved, the appropriate remedy for him is to take resort to civil
proceedings or arbitration proceedings, provided there is any such

arbitration clause between the parties.
4.

We, therefore, hold that in this appeal we are not inclined to

grant payment of interest. If the appellant is desirous of claiming
interest on the aforesaid amount, he can take resort to appropriate
proceedings in accordance with law. The appeal has no merit and the
same is dismissed.
