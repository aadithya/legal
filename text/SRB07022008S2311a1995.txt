1.

In these proceedings, the plaintiff seeks filing of an arbitration award dated 10.9.1995;

the defendants have filed objections to the award being I.A. 1026/1999. Initially, there was a
controversy as to whether the respondents had filed objections within the stipulated time;
however, that was set at rest by the order of this Court dated 13th November, 2007 whereby
their application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act was accepted on condition of their
paying Rs. 10,000/- as costs.

The facts as emerging from the pleadings are that the petitioner was awarded a contract

towards “supply and errection of 2x100 KVA D.G. Set for 50 KW SW (Short Wave) AIR
Transmitter” at Srinagar, in Jammu and Kashmir. A condition in the contract i.e. Clause 25
stipulated that disputes between the parties would be adjudicated by an Arbitrator. The
contract was awarded on 29.8.2007. It required completion of the supply and errection of
agreed equipments within five months.
3.

The petitioner sought reference and preferred 9 heads of claims including withholding

of balance amount of Rs. 1,24,335/- payable from the final bill (Claim No. 1), interest on that
amount at 24 per annum for the period 18.10.1988 to 17.12.1991 (Claim No.2); loss of interest
(Claim No.3); differential Sales Tax amounts at 6% on the basis of a stipulation in the contract
(Claim No.4) for the sum of Rs. 29543/- with interest and other claims towards interest loss on
three bank guarantees (Claims 5 to 7) and counsel's fee at Rs. 10,000/- being Claim No. 9. The
Arbitrator made and published his award on 10th September, 1995. In its terms, the petitioner
claimant succeeded in part in Claims 1 and 2 were allowed to the extent of Rs. 67,140/- and
interest on that amount for a period 5.6.1989 to 17.12.1991, was granted. The other claim
awarded was Claim No. 4 to the extent of 50%; the amount quantified was Rs. 31,390/-. The
Arbitrator declined all other claims.
4.

The objections to the Award center around the alleged infirmity in it. According to the

respondent Union of India (which is the objector) the first claim and consequentially the
CS(OS) 2311A/1995

2 of

13

second claim were clearly inadmissible.

Ms. Monika Garg, learned for the respondents

referred to the pleadings and adverted to the documents, particularly, documents marked in the
arbitration proceedings such as show cause notices and other letters being R-2 (dated
8.3.1988), R-4 (dated 2.5.1989) to state that although time was indicated for the performance
of the agreement, the contractor did not adhere to it and was repeatedly warned; even show
cause notices were issued.

Therefore, the Arbitrator, it is claimed, fell into an error in

awarding any amount much less the sum of Rs. 67,140/- in respect of claim No. 1. She also
adverted to the defective performance of the contract, concerning the supplying of a 0.8 power
factor alternator in stead of the agreed 0.9 power factor. It was submitted that for the same
reason, there was no question of granting any interest on the amounts.
5.

Learned counsel contended that so far as the award concerned to Claim No. 4, the

petitioner could not have been given those amounts. She referred to terms of the contract and
submitted that the respondent's liability was conditioned on

the petitioner's demanding

furnishing of the Form-C or for-D, as the case may be, towards Sales Tax. In the absence of
any demand (during the performance of the contract or even in close proximity of it), the
petitioner could not have claimed any amount, or the differential 6% Sales Tax amounts. It
was contended that in any event, the Arbitrator could not have, in the absence of proof or
material documents awarded any amount and certainly not the amount of 50% of the claim
which was not supported by evidence.

Learned counsel, relying upon the allegations in the objections, submitted that the

Arbitrator unjustifiably turned down the entire counter claim which was to the extent of Rs.
2,68,828/-. It was submitted that the counter claim was crucial for consideration in so far as
the aspect of delay and the performance of the contract, as far as it concerned justification of
Claims 1 & 2 of the petitioner contractor were concerned.
7.

The petitioner contractor on the other hand resisted the objections. It was contended

that the award was justified and that the Court should not substitute its reasoning and examine
minutely the nature of evidence or the terms of contract. So long as, there was some material
to justify the finding in the award, the Court should lean against the tendency to intervene and
substitute its opinion as an appellate body.
8.

Adverting to specific claims, learned counsel urged that Claim No.1 was allowed on

the basis of an admission by the respondent objector.

Learned counsel referred to the

arguments/rejoinder on account of counter claims made by the respondents in writing; it was
filed before the Arbitrator on 12.5.1999. Learned counsel submitted that according to para 2 of
the said written arguments, the respondents admitted their liability to the extent of Rs.
67,140/-. Learned counsel also invited reference to Annexure-1 to the Written Statement
signed by the Executive Engineer; in the third column while referring to their running and
final bill, it admitted that the sum of Rs. 67,140/- was payable to the claimant. It was
submitted that in these circumstances the Award cannot be faulted. Learned counsel also
CS(OS) 2311A/1995

4 of

13

claimed that the award of interest was justified since there is no dispute about the performance
of the contract on 5.6.1989 and that the claim was in fact preferred on 17.12.1991.
9.

Learned counsel submitted that onus of the proving justification for withholding Rs.

67140/- the sum awarded in claim No. 1—or any other amount such as Rs. 32533/- was
squarely with the respondents which it fails to discharge. It was submitted that a mere
reference to extension of time (EOT) compensation was not sufficient and the respondents
were under a further obligation to disclose, in the arbitration proceedings how they were
deprived or the extent of legal injury caused to them which entitled the withholding of such
amounts. Therefore, the Arbitrator, he submitted, was justified in concluding as he did that
Rs. 67140/- with interest according to claims 1 & 2 were payable, by the respondents.
10.

Mr.

Chandwani, learned counsel further submitted that so far as the 4 th Claim was

concerned, the award was justified. He referred to the concerned condition, namely, Clause 2
of the offer which was finally accepted. That condition reads as follows:
“ 4% extra against Form-C or D due which shall be provided by the
Purchaser/Consignee”
It was submitted that the stipulation cast a primary obligation upon the respondents to pay 4%
over an above the duty to furnish the D-Form. Nowhere did the respondents indicate that the
D-Form was ever furnished. Although, the petitioner claimant did not furnish proof of having
paid the amounts, the claim was a matter of law, based on interpretation of contract. Learned

CS(OS) 2311A/1995

5 of

13

counsel referred to the decision of this Court reported as Haryana Paper Mills vs. Union of
India, 1995 (35) DRJ to state that in almost similar circumstances, in the absence of proof of
payment the Court upheld an award where 50% of the Excise Duty, which had been awarded
in the proceedings was affirmed.
11.

So far as the averments on counter claims were concerned, learned counsel submitted

that Clause 14 of the contract (in the terms of conditions which bound the parties) required the
respondents purchaser to indicate, within a period of 6 months the defects, if any, and also
correspondingly make a claim within that period. It was submitted that no suich claim, or even
the claim of Rs. 2,68,828/- made during the arbitration proceedings was ever preferred or
demanded from the claimant within that period. In the circumstances, the Arbitrator was
justified in rejecting the counter claim. Adverting to the power factor, learned counsel relied
on the same condition and further submitted that no document or material was placed or
pressed into service by the respondents to show that the notice about the power factor was ever
alleged within the time stipulated. It was, therefore, submitted that the claims as adjudicated
and upheld and the rejection of the counter claim of the respondents were justified. Counsel
submitted that in these circumstances, the Court should made the Award Rule of Court and
also direct post award interest from the date of the filing of petition till its realization.
12.

A look at the Award in question shows that undoubtedly it does not contain detailed

reasons. However, what is significant is that out of nine Claims made by the petitioner, only
CS(OS) 2311A/1995

6 of

13

three were allowed, and in part. The first Claim by the petitioner was to the extent of Rs.
1,24,355/- towards balance amounts due and payable in their final bill. The Arbitrator went by
the admission of the respondents as is evident from the following extract:
“The respondents admitted in their Written Statement dated 16.3.94 that
Rs. 67,140/- is due for payment in respect of the same. Again the
Respondents confirmed and admitted in their arguments/Rejoinder on
account of Counter-claims dated 12.5.95 that a sum of Rs. 5,27,617/- was
payable to the Claimants out of which Rs. 4,60,675/- was paid upto the
second R.A. Bill as on 9.12.1988. This left a sum of Rs. 67,140/- with the
Department. The Claimants have also agreed this claim. Accordingly I
award an amount of Rs. 67,140/- in favour of the Claimants under this
claim.”
13.

The admission apparently adverted by the Arbitrator is to be found in the arguments of

the respondents in its written note on counter claims. The same reads as follows:
“2.
The claimant did work amounting to Rs. 4,87,543/- upto the 3rd & final
bill plus Loading charges amounting to Rs. 7,000/-, CST amounting to Rs.
17,272/- and the amount payable for extra NTC 495 Engine is Rs. 16,000/-.
Thus a sum of Rs. 5,27,815/- was payable to the claimant out of which Rs.
4,60,675/- was paid upto the Second R.A. Bill as on 9.12.1988. This has left a
sum of Rs. 67,140/- with the department.”
14.

The averments or contentions in the para immediately succeeding para 2 mentions that

the sum of Rs. 32,533/- was adjusted against the EOT compensation leaving the balance of Rs.
34,607/- with the respondents. This prima facie discloses that the respondents admitted their
liability. The question is what was the quantum. Now, the reasoning of the Arbitrator is
premised on the admission of the respondents which is also apparently supported by

CS(OS) 2311A/1995

7 of

13

Annexure-1 to the written statement which adverted that the amounts admitted to be payable to
the petitioner were Rs. 67,140/- as against the sum of Rs. 32,533/- which was shown in the
foot of the said annexure under the head “recoveries”.
15.

There perhaps can be two opinions as to the exact amounts payable by the respondents

to the petitioner. One plausible view would be that the respondents did not unambiguously
admit their liabilities to be Rs. 67,140/- but stated that it was Rs. 34,607/-. On the other hand,
the view taken by the Arbitrator is apparently that the counter claim of the respondents was not
supported by any material. If one takes this into account and the further fact that no material
has been shown in support of the allegation that the sum of Rs. 32,533/- could be adjusted
against EOT and for what reason, the other view was preferred by the Arbitrator is in an
equally feasible one.
16.

If two such views are possible, even while not discounting the reasonableness of the

claim in para 3 of the respondents' arguments, the fact that the Arbitrator has chosen to prefer
one which does not admit the petitioner's claim in totality and is indeed supported by the
materials on record, by itself cannot entitle the Court to infer the award is arbitraory or that the
Arbitrator mis-conducted himself in preferring one view. Likewise, on the issue of interest,
the Arbitrator has preferred to award 17.5% on the said amount of Rs. 67,140/- for the period
5.6.1989 till the 17.12.1991. This is based on the finding by the Arbitrator that the date of the
completion of the work as recorded by the respondents was 5.6.1989. For the same reason, as
CS(OS) 2311A/1995

8 of

13

in the case of Claim No.1, this court finds no infirmity with this approach. Although the rate
of 17.5% per annum made seems excessive now but it would be well to remember that at that
time the prime landing of the banks for commercial advances was considerably high and even
in excess of 20% per annum. Being a commercial contract, withholding of the principal sum
and the award of interest at 17.5% cannot be called unreasonable.
17.

The only item of claim which survives consideration is No. 4. Here, the claimants had

contended successfully that the contract required the Respondents to furnish Form-D or C as
the case was, for onward transmission to the Sales Tax and in addition they were entitled to
4%. It is not in dispute that the petitioner did receive 4% of the agreed quantum. In these
circumstances, the obligation to furnish Form-D was, in terms absolute.

There is again no

serious dispute—and indeed it had not been even urged in this regard—that at the rate of Sales
Tax was 10% at the relevant time in the event of the dealer/assessee not furnishing the
concerned form, (which would have entitled him to a lower levy). Here, the respondents' plea
is that the petitioner did not call upon them to furnish the Sales Tax Forms. The Arbitrator in
the opinion of the Court reasonably rejected this untenable proposition. The condition clearly
stipulated that the respondents had to furnish the C and D Forms, which was not done. In the
decision in Haryana Paper Mills(supra), a similar question was considered. The Court there
held that in the absence of any stipulation requiring the claimant to render proof of payment
(where actual excise duty had to be paid), the amount had to be awarded. In this case, also
CS(OS) 2311A/1995

9 of

13

there is no dispute that the goods were in fact supplied. In these circumstances, in the absence
of the respondents' furnishing the concerned forms, the finding of their having breached that
condition, cannot be characterized as illegal or untenable so as to amount to mis-conduct by
the Arbitrator. In any event, the Arbitrator has awarded 50% of the claim like in the case of
Haryana Paper Mills.

Annexure-1 to the written statement, had indicated some amounts against the

expression “recoveries” and claimed that this was on account of work done at contractor's risk
and cost. Such being the case, the onus lay upon the counter claimant/respondents to satisfy
the Arbitrator as to the feasibility of such demands or liability of the petitioner on each head.

CS(OS) 2311A/1995

11 of 13

Apparently, beyond making the claim, the counter claimant did not furnish any materials in
that regard. Further more, counter claims were also used as a justification for withholding
amount ultimately awarded in respect of Claim Nos. 1 & 2. In the overall conspectus of fact
that the Arbitrator declined to award any amount towards the counter claim, such findings
cannot in the opinion of this Court be termed as illegal or unreasonable.
20.

The parameters of a Court's jurisdiction under Section 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act,

1940 to interfere with an Award are far too well settled. The jurisdiction of the Court is
neither appellate nor supervisory. It cannot second guess findings of an Arbitrator, who is a
nominated and agreed adjudicator by the parties. The Court has generally satisfy itself that the
approach of the Arbitrator conformed to the law and that the Award does not disclose any
patent or manifest ill-legality in the findings or in the application of law. The Supreme Court
in its decisions reported as State of Rajasthan vs. Puri Construction Co. Ltd. and Anr. , (1994)
6 SCC 485 and the previous decision in Sudarsan Trading Co. v. Govt. of Kerala, (1989) 2
SCC 38 ruled that the Court cannot substitute its evaluation of the conclusion of the law or fact
to conclude that the findings of the Arbitrator were contrary to the bargain between the parties.
It was also held that whether any particular amount was liable to be paid by within the
competence of the Arbitrator. The Court, therefore, cannot take upon itself the burden of
saying that what was actually found was contrary to the contract and as such beyond
jurisdiction of the Arbitrator. More importantly it had been held (in State of Rajasthan vs.
CS(OS) 2311A/1995

12 of 13

Puri Construction Co. Ltd. and Anr.) that if a view taken by the Arbitrator on certain amount
is a possible view though not perhaps only ones the Award still cannot be examined by the
Court; where reasons are furnished the correctness of reasonableness cannot also be subject of
scrutiny.
21.

The above approach has found consistent favour in all succeeding judgments of

Supreme and has been adopted and applied by various High Courts including this Court. On
an application of the rule enunciated by the Supreme Court in its above decisions and
consistently applied by all Courts, all this while, this Court is of the opinion that the findings
of the Arbitrator in the award impugned as regards the claims of the petitioner and to the extent
that declined the counter claims of the respondents cannot faulted. They are neither arbitrary
nor contrary; they also do not disclose any patent illegality or manifest injustice.

The

objections, therefore, have to fail.
22.

In view of the above findings, the Award is made Rule of the Court. The petitioner

shall also be entitled to the post award interest at 10% from the date of filing of the present
petition till its realization. I.A. 1026/1999 is dismissed. Suit decreed in the above terms No
costs.
