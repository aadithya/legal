her another medical examination when

25% burns

were found present on anterior part of her chest and

A

was

eventually

registered at PS Chandni Mahal, Delhi under Sections
498A/324/34 IPC at 7.20 pm.

Learned counsel for the petitioners argued that
the complainant in her first complaint simply made
general allegations, without specifying the roles of
individual accused, that some oil was poured on her
by the petitioners and their co- accused including her
husband

Salauddin

on

account

of

which

she

sustained burns on her person. It was pointed out
that on her first medical examination at JPN Hospital
no external injury of any sort was, however, found on
her person and it was only on the next day on 18 th
April, 2007 at 2.45 pm on her being taken to the said
Hospital

for

the

second

time

for

her

medical

examination that 25% burns over anterior parts of her
chest and abdomen were found. The learned counsel

medical

Learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that in her first complaint the complainant
did not specify the role played by the petitioners and
her co-accused and it was only in her subsequent
statement dated 20th April, 2007 that she came out
with an allegation that both the petitioners had
caught hold of her and her husband had poured oil on
her body. Referring to a typed statement dated 11th
May 2007 of the complainant, naming four more
persons as accused and yet another supplementary
statement dated 22nd June 2007, it was contended
that the complainant kept on making improvements in
her successive statements and not only that she came
out with changed versions in regard

to alleged

incident she also went on roping in certain other
persons also whose names did not find mention in her

initial complaint.
5.

The plea for anticipatory bail to either of the
petitioners was opposed on behalf of the State.

6.

It is noticed that the learned Addl. Sessions
Judge who dealt with the applications for anticipatory
bail on behalf of the present petitioners as also their
co accused Naseema, Mubina and Salauddin granted
pre-arrest bail to their co-accused Naseema and
Mubina but declined the same to petitioners and their
co accused Salauddin on the grounds that there were
specific allegations of both of them catching hold of
the complainant and their co-accused Salauddin
pouring oil on her resulting into burns on her person.
It is however, to be noticed that in her initial
complaint the complainant had made

only general

allegations against the petitioners and their coaccused

Naseema

and

it

was

only

in

her

supplementary statements that she came out with
specific role allegedly played by them.
7.

From the perusal of first MLC it is gathered

Bail App. No.1540-41/2007

Page 5 of 6

that no burns were found on her person on the date
of incident and it was only on the next day in the
afternoon when she was

taken for her medical

examination for a second time that 25% burns were
noticed on the anterior part of her chest and
abdomen.
8.

In the totality of the facts and circumstances of
the case, the petitioners are, in the event of

their

arrest, directed to be released on bail on their
furnishing personal bond for Rs.10,000/- each with
one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
I.O./S.H.O. concerned.

They shall keep on joining

investigation whenever so required.
9.

Both the petitions stand disposed of.
