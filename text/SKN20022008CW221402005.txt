December, 2005 had directed

Divisional Commissioner, Government of NCT, Delhi to carry out
demarcation of the area by Total Station Method. It was noticed that the
earlier demarcation report cannot be accepted. The demarcation was to
be done also in accordance with the directions given in the earlier order
dated 2/12/2005.
5. The demarcation report has been filed in terms of the said order dated

20/12/2005. It is sated that Total Station Method was deployed in

addition to manual measurement. The conclusions of the report are as
under :
“Khasra no.561/421 admeasuring 9 bighas 8 biswas consists of

two parts. One is of 7 bighas 12 biswas which was acquired for
the Railways and as on today most of this land is inside the
Railway boundary and some portion of it has been transferred to
PWD for utilization in road no.43. Remaining portion of this khasra
is bighas 16 biswas and is heavily built up and privately owned
land. In khasra no.561/421 in revenue estate Saleempur, Majra,
Madipur there are about 20 heavy built up houses. This khasra
no. is not acquired land and is privately owned land. The detailed
list of the persons who have constructed their houses and are

8. Under the provisions of the Delhi Land Revenue Act, 1964 and the Delhi

Land Revenue Rules, 1962 any dispute pertaining to demarcation and
the demarcation report can be made subject matter of an appeal/review.
In the present case as demarcation has been done under the personal
supervision of Deputy Commissioner (West), an appeal or revision will
lie to the Financial Commissioner. The petitioner therefore has an

alternative remedy to challenge the demarcation report by filing an
appeal/revision before the Financial Commissioner who can go into all
relevant aspects including the objections raised by the petitioner to the
demarcation report. The petitioner will also be at liberty to rely upon the
possession report dated 18/4/2004 which states that the construction on
khasra no.561/421 min measuring 1382 sq.mts was demolished. The
petitioner can also rely upon the notice under section 9 of the Land
Acquisition Act dated 7/4/2004 wherein the name of Mr. Ramesh Chand
Agarwal is mentioned. The respondents can also file documents in
support of their claim. The evidenciary value and effect of the
documents will be examined by the Financial Commissioner. These are
all aspects, which the Financial Commissioner will have to examine and
go into while examining the demarcation report. It is also clarified that
observations of this court will not be binding on Commissioner who will
examine claims of the parties on merits. In case the petitioner is
aggrieved by the order of the Financial Commissioner he will be at
liberty to challenge the same in accordance with law.
9. The petitioner has been bona fidely pursuing these proceedings and

has also filed objections to demarcation report in this court. The
objections were taken on record and being examined. It is therefore,

observed that the petitioner will be entitled to benefit under section 14 of
the Limitation Act, 1963.
The writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
