CM No.11035/2003 in WP (C) No.2056/2003
By this application, the respondent/workman is seeking
grant of wages on the ground that by an industrial award dated 11th
July, 2000, the industrial tribunal has held that termination of the
services of the respondent was illegal and has directed his
reinstatement into service. This award has been assailed by the
petitioner before this court and interim stay thereof has been
granted. It is submitted on behalf of the workman that he remains
unemployed since the date of termination of his service and that
he has no source of income. According to the workman, despite
best efforts, he could not get any job in any other establishment
and that he is surviving with the assistance of his eldest son. The
workman has sworn an affidavit submitting that he was neither
gainfully employed in any establishment during the pendency of
the dispute before the labour court nor is he gainfully employed in
any establishment even now.
The petitioner has contested the application and has
contended that the petitioner has a good case on merits and for
this reason, the application itself would not be maintainable.
The principles governing adjudication on an application
which is filed by a workman who has an industrial award directing
WP (C) No.2056/2003 & WP (C) No.3667/2000

Page No.2

reinstatement into service in his favour in a writ petition filed by
the management challenging such award, are well settled. It has
been held by the Apex Court that such wages are in the nature of
non-refundable subsistence allowance and that minimum wages
which are notified by the statutory authorities are a fair index of
quantum of such wages which deserve to be awarded. There is no
dispute at all with regard to the submission of the workman that
he is not gainfully employed since the date of termination of his
service.
In the light of the well settled principles of law, the relief
sought deserves to be granted. The application is hereby allowed.
The petitioner is directed to make payment of wages to the
workman which were being paid to him at the time when his
services were terminated. Payment of wages in terms of the order
passed today shall be effected within a period of four weeks from
today.

It is pointed out that WP (C) No.3667/2000 and WP (C)
No.2056/2003 are connected in as much as the parties are same
and identical issues of law and fact arise. Consequently, with the
consent of both parties, the writ petitions are taken up for hearing.

By way of WP (C) No.3677/2000, the petitioner (DTC) has

assailed an order dated 3rd January, 2000 passed in OP
No.466/1993 by Industrial Tribunal No.II rejecting an application
of the D.T.C. filed under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947. It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that
on account of unauthorised absence of the respondent/workman
who had been employed as a driver by the D.T.C., a charge-sheet
was issued to him and after conducting a disciplinary inquiry in
accordance with law and after compliance with the principles of
natural justice, by an order dated 6th August, 1993, the services of
the respondent/workman were terminated. During the pendency
of the industrial dispute in which the workman was a concerned
party, the petitioner had consequently filed an application under
Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking
approval of the disciplinary action taken against the workman.
However, the workman has contended before the industrial
tribunal that the petitioner had treated the period of 104 days of
the absence of the workman as leave without pay and that by such
act has regularised the absence of the workman.
3.

The industrial tribunal was of the view that once the period

of such absence is treated as a period of leave without pay and any
WP (C) No.2056/2003 & WP (C) No.3667/2000

Page No.4

other kind of leave, this absence would not be treated as
misconduct. Consequently, it was held by the industrial tribunal
that the respondent had not committed any misconduct and as a
consequence, dismissed the application of the petitioner by an
order passed on 3rd January, 2000.
4.

The workman had separately made a grievance with regard

to the termination of his service by agitating the same before the
labour authorities.

The appropriate government had passed an

order dated 31st October, 1994 under Section 10 & Section 12(5) of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 referring a dispute relating to the
illegality and justifiability of the removal of service of the
respondent. This reference was registered as ID No.2067/1994.
5.

Thereafter, in view of the order dated 3rd January, 2000

passed by the industrial tribunal whereby the application of the
petitioner under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 was dismissed, the industrial adjudicator was of the view that
it was of no fruitful use to record the management's evidence. It
was held that the position in law was that once the application for
approval is refused, the workman would be deemed to have been
reinstated.

By the award dated 11th July, 2000, the industrial

adjudicator answered the reference in favour of the workman.
WP (C) No.2056/2003 & WP (C) No.3667/2000

Page No.5

6.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the

view taken by the industrial adjudicator is wholly erroneous in law
in as much as once an order of reference is made and the
industrial adjudicator proceeds in the matter, the proceedings can
be closed only upon an adjudication in accordance with law and
passing of the award. Aggrieved thereby, the DTC has assailed the
award dated 11th of July, 2000 by way of WP (C) No.2056 of 2003.
7.

Be that as it may, it would not be necessary to delineate on

this issue in elaboration in view of the position in law on the view
taken by the industrial tribunal on the application filed by the
D.T.C. under Section 33(2)(b) of the Act.
8.

So far as the issue relating to unauthorised absence and the

same having been treated as leave without pay by the management
is concerned, the principles applicable to the same have been
authoritatively laid down by the Apex Court in its pronouncement
reported at AIR 2004 SC 4161 entitled D.T.C. Vs. Sardar
Singh wherein the Apex Court has held thus:“8. In all theses cases almost the whole period of
absence was without sanctioned lave.
Mere
making of an application after or even before
absence from work does not in any way assist the
concerned employee.
The requirement is
obtaining leave in advance. In all these cases the
WP (C) No.2056/2003 & WP (C) No.3667/2000

Page No.6

absence was without obtaining leave in advance.
The relevant paras of the Standing Order read as
follows :
“4. Absence without permission:(i) An employee shall not absent
himself from his duties without
having first obtained the permission
from the Authority or the competent
officer except in the case of sudden
illness. In the cases of sudden
illness he shall send intimation to
the office immediately. If the illness
lasts or is expected to last for more
than 3 days at a time, applications
for
leave
should
be
duly
accompanied
by
a
medical
certificate, from a registered
medical practitioner or the Medical
Officer of the D.T.S. In no case shall
an employee leave station without
prior permission.
(ii) Habitual absence without
permission or sanction of leave and
any continuous absence without
such leave for more than 10 days
shall render the employee liable to
be treated as an absconder resulting
in the termination of his service with
the Organisation.
19. General Provisions :Without prejudice to the provisions
of the foregoing Standing Orders,
the following acts of commission
and omission shall be treated as
mis-conduct :
(a) ...............
(h) Habitual negligence of duties and lack of
interest in the Authority's work.
10. When an employee absents himself from
duty, even without sanctioned leave for very long
period, it prima facie shows lack of interest in
WP (C) No.2056/2003 & WP (C) No.3667/2000

Page No.7

work. Para 19(h) of the Standing Order as
quoted above relates to habitual negligence of
duties and lack of interest in the Authority's
work. When an employee absents himself from
duty without sanctioned leave the Authority can,
on the basis of the records, come to a conclusion
about the employee being habitually negligent in
duties and an exhibited lack of interest in the
employer's work. Ample material was produced
before the Tribunal in each case to show as to
how the concerned employees were remaining
absent for long periods which affect the work of
the employer and the concerned employee was
required at least to bring some material on
record to show as to how his absence was on the
basis of sanctioned leave and as to how there
was no negligence. Habitual absence is a factor
which establishes lack of interest in work. There
cannot be any sweeping generalisation. But at
the same time some telltale features can be
noticed and pressed into service to arrive at
conclusions in the departmental proceedings.
11. Great emphasis was laid by learned
counsel for the respondent-employee on the
absence being treated as leave without pay. As
was observed by this Court in State of Madhya
Pradesh v. Harihar Gopal [1969 (3) SLR 274]
by a three-judge Bench of this court, even when
an order is passed for treating absence as leave
without pay after passing an order of
termination that is for the purpose of
maintaining correct record of service. The
charge in that case was, as in the present case,
absence without obtaining leave in advance. The
conduct of the employees in this case is nothing
but irresponsible in extreme and can hardly be
justified.
The charge in this case was
misconduct by absence.
In view of the
Governing Standing Orders unauthorised leave
can be treated as misconduct.
WP (C) No.2056/2003 & WP (C) No.3667/2000

Page No.8

12. Conclusions regarding negligence and lack
of interest can be arrived at by looking into the
period of absence, more particularly, when same
is unauthorised. Burden is on the employee who
claims that there was no negligence and/or lack
of interest to establish it by placing relevant
materials. Clause (ii) of Para 4 of the Standing
Order shows the seriousness attached to
habitual absence. In clause (i) thereof, there is
requirement of prior permission.
Only
exception made is in case of sudden illness.
There also conditions are stipulated, nonobservance of which renders the absence
unauthorised.”
9.

The position in law having been stated thus, it has to be held

that the view of the industrial tribunal to the effect that the period
of absence having been treated as leave without pay does not
remain misconduct, cannot be sustained in law. The effect of such
absence and the same having been treated as leave without pay
would require to be considered in the light of the specific evidence
which is brought before the labour court which will have to assess
the same in order to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the
absence was negligent and wilful and also as to whether the same
resulted in prejudice and loss to the employer and thereafter as to
whether the absence was habitual as to render the same as
negligence.
10.

In view of the law laid down in DTC Vs. Sardar Singh

WP (C) No.2056/2003 & WP (C) No.3667/2000

Page No.9

(supra), the order dated 3rd January, 2000 cannot be sustained.
WP (C) No.3667/2000 is hereby allowed.
The order dated 3rd January, 2000 is hereby set aside and
quashed and the matter is remanded for further and fresh
consideration to the Industrial Tribunal No.II which shall proceed
in the matter in accordance with law.

The parties may be given

opportunity to place such further and other evidences and material
as have been necessary and relevant before the industrial tribunal.
The parties shall appear before the industrial Tribunal on
15th May, 2006 for further directions in the matter.
11.

In as much as the award dated 11th July, 2000 is based only

on the order dated 3rd January, 2000 which has been set aside, the
writ petition (C) No.2056/2003 has to be allowed. The award
dated 11th July, 2000 is hereby set aside and quashed and the
matter is remanded for further consideration to the Labour Court
No.IX for fresh adjudication in the light of the law laid down by
the Apex Court. The parties shall appear before the Labour Court
No.IX in ID No.2067/1994 for directions on 15th of May, 2006.
The Labour Court shall given an opportunity to both parties to
such evidence as may be permissible in law in support of their
respective contentions.
