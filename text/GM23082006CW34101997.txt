1.

This writ petition raises fundamental issues of first

principles of jurisdiction of the authorities under Section 33 of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the difference between the scope
of consideration under Section 36 A and Section 33 (C) (1) of the
same enactment.
2.

Respondent No.4, Mrs.Parveen Bahl, in the instant case

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 1 of 75

was appointed as a temporary Steno pursuant to an order dated
14th October, 1980.

This letter of appointment contained the

following stipulation :“2. You will be on probation for a period of 12
(twelve) months or for such further extended
period as the Management may in its sole
discretion decide. You will continue to remain on
probation till a letter of confirmation is issued to
you.
Both during and after the probationary
period, your services will be terminable by 30
days (thirty days) notice, in writing, on either
side, or salary in-lieu thereof.
3. On completion of the probationary period or
the extended period, as the case may be , you may
be considered for confirmation on a suitable
salary/grade provided your services are found
satisfactory and subject to your being found
medically fit by a doctor nominated by the
Company.”
3.

The probationary period of respondent No.4 were

extended upto 30th April, 1982, by the petitioner on the ground
that her work was not satisfactory.

The relevant extract of the

letter dated 30th April, 1982 reads as under :“Since your work was not found satisfactory by the
Management during the abovementioned period
of probation, vide our letter No.D.13/HRG:PV
dated 17th Nov. 1981, as clarified vide our letter
No.D.13/HRG:VKA dated 19th Nov. 1981, the
probationary period was extended upto 30th April,
1982. We regret to inform you during the
extended probationary period also your work has
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 2 of 75

not been found satisfactory. We have, therefore,
to inform you that your services will stand
terminated on expiry of the extended
probationary period i.e. on 30th April, 1982”.
The petitioner further informed the respondent No.4
that in view of the length of her service i.e. from 21 st October, 1980
to 30th April, 1982, it had been decided to pay her an amount
equivalent to one month's wages as compensation, besides one
month's wages as notice pay and her other dues.

Respondent

No.4 was required to settle all accounts with the petitioner before
closing of the office on 30th April, 1982.
4.

Respondent No.4 complained to the authorities under

the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 against her termination being
illegal and that the same was on account of her involvement in
trade union activities in the establishment. She asserted that the
extension of her probation vide letter dated 17th November, 1981
was also without any basis.

Conciliation proceedings before the

authorities under the statute culminated in a failure report.
5.

By an order dated 10th March, 1983, the Secretary

(Labour) Delhi Administration, Delhi passed in exercise of powers
under Sections 10 and 12 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the
following disputes were referred for adjudication to the Labour

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 3 of 75

Court-II :“Whether the service of Mrs. Praveen Bahl was
unjustifiably or illegally terminated and if so, what
directions are necessary in this regard.”
6.

The workman stated that despite the management

informing the Conciliation Officer that she would be confirmed,
her services were peremptorily terminated by the letter dated
30.4.1982.

The petitioner stated that she has not accepted the

amount which was offered by the management.
7.

The industrial adjudication culminated in an award

dated 31st January, 1990 whereby the adjudicator arrived at a
conclusion that respondent No. 4 being on probation, was not well
conversant with the terminology of the technical words and was
not so highly qualified so as to expect from her that she would have
correctly typed all the letters.

On this ground, the Labour Court

arrived at a further conclusion that mere mistakes of spelling could
not be a ground for dispensing with her services and that the
management had terminated her services with ulterior motives
and not by a bona fide exercise of powers under the contract.

In

this view of the matter, it was held that termination of the services
of respondent No.4 was illegal and unjustified and she was

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 4 of 75

directed to be reinstated from the date of termination of her
service. It was further directed that she would be deemed to be in
continuous service from the date of termination of her service. So
far as back wages are concerned, in view of the fact that the
workman had been gainfully employed for a certain period after
the termination of her services by the petitioner, it was directed
that respondent No.4 would be entitled to the difference of wages
which she had earned uptill the date of the award while working
with other firms and the salary which she would have drawn when
she was working with the petitioner.
8.

This award was assailed by the petitioner by way of Writ

Petition (C) No.1416/90 which was dismissed in limine vide order
dated 8th May, 1990 when the Division Bench of this Court passed
the following order:“We have heard the learned counsel for the
petitioner at length. We have also been taken
through the portions of the award as also the
relevant evidence which has been made a part of
this petition. We are satisfied that the findings of
the Labour Court to the effect that the respondent
has been victimised is based on evidence and is
fully justified. As regards the back wages, the
Labour Court has made clear provision in the
award itself and the appropriate authority will
naturally determine the arrears which are due to
the respondents. We find absolutely no merit in
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 5 of 75

9.

this petition and dismissed the same in limine.”
Aggrieved by the above dismissal order, the petitioner

filed two special leave petitions in the Supreme Court being SLP(C)
Nos.7198-99/1990 against the order of this Court as also
impugning the industrial award in favour of respondent No.4.
The Special Leave Petitions were called up for hearing on 20th
November, 1995 and dismissed with the following directions :“We see no ground to interfere with the Award of
the Labour Court as upheld by the High Court.
Mr.Rao states that Mrs.Praveen Bahl, respondent
in the petition herein, shall join the duties in
terms of the award within two weeks. We direct
Mrs.Praveen Bahl to join between December 1 and
December, 15, 1995.
In case she fails to join
during this period, she shall not be permitted to
join thereafter. Needless to say that she shall be
permitted to join in terms of the Award and she
shall be entitled to all the benefits given to her
under the Award. The Special Leave Petitions are
dismissed.”
Thus, the industrial award dated 31st January, 1990
attained finality and time bound directions were passed directing
the respondent no. 4 to join duties.
10.

The petitioner has contended that vide a letter dated 25th

May, 1990 it called upon respondent No.4 to join service but she
did not do so. By this communication, the petitioner had inter alia
informed the respondent No.4 as under :W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 6 of 75

“iii) You raised an industrial dispute to challenge
the termination of your service. The Hon'ble
Labour Court-II, Delhi in its Award published on
30th April, 1990 has reinstated you in service. In
compliance with the Award of the Hon'ble
Labour Court, the Management is hereby
reinstating you in service. You are required to
report for duty latest by 1st June, 1990.
iv)
Please note that you will remain on
probation for a further period of six months from
the date you report for duty.
v) In view of the revision of minimum rates of
wages vide the Notification dated 28.4.90 issued
by the Delhi Administration, your consolidated
salary will be Rs.1215/- (Rs.One thousand two
hundred and fifteen) per month w.e.f. The date
you report for duty.
The other terms and
conditions of your service as stipulated in your
appointment letter No.D.13/HRG:Ns dated
14.10.80 shall remain unchanged.”
11.

Respondent No.4 vide letters dated 29th May, 1990 and

6th June, 1990 stated that the terms were unfair and she could not
have been appointed on probation.

Despite these assertions,

respondent No.4 has contended that she reported for duty vide
letter dated 31st May, 1990 but was not allowed to do so by the
petitioner. Needless to say, the petitioner disputes this.
12.

Thereafter, the respondent no. 4 filed an application

dated 1st August, 1990 under Section 36 A of the Industrial

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 7 of 75

Disputes Act, 1947 whereby she sought necessary action to be
taken by the Secretary (Labour) and reference of the differences
which had arisen between the parties with regard to interpretation
of the award to the Labour Court concerned.

This application of

respondent No.4 was rejected vide an order dated 26th November,
1990 whereby she was informed that in the view of the Competent
Authority, there was no ambiguity in the award dated 30th April,
1990 which warranted no clarification/interpretation.
13.

The petitioner assailed this order dated 26th November,

1990 by way of a writ petition being CWP No.178/91. During the
pendency of this writ petition, respondent No.4 also made an
application

dated

20th

March,

1995

before

the

Labour

Commissioner-respondent No.2 for implementation of the award.
14.

Meanwhile, CWP No.178/91 came up for hearing on 25th

July, 1995 when it was brought to the notice of the Court that the
respondent No.4 had sought implementation of the award which
was not being effected on account of pendency of the above writ
petition.

The Court disposed of the writ petition by an order

dated 25th July, 1995 holding thus:“Without prejudice to the rights of the parties, it is
decided that since the petitioner has invoked the
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 8 of 75

jurisdiction of the authority concerned for the
implementation of the award, therefore, this writ
petition is premature. At this stage when the
request of the petitioner is pending for the
implementation of the award, the question to
determine or to interpret the award or to hold that
it is clear or vague as required under Section 36-A
of the I.D. Act does not arise.
With the above observations, the
petition is disposed of. Let appropriate authority,
who is competent, take steps to implement the
award in accordance with the law after hearing
both the parties.”
15.

Before the Labour Commissioner, respondent no.4 had

pleaded that she was entitled to a particular amount from the
petitioner.

The petitioner filed a reply dated 28th July, 1995

disputing the correctness of the amount claimed and also sought
copies of the documents filed by respondent no.4. The petitioner
also pointed out that despite being asked to join, the respondent
no.4 had failed to join her duties.
16.

On 13th September, 1995, the Labour Commissioner

passed an order informing the respondent no.4 that she should
contact the concerned District Labour Officer for reinstatement
with the Management as per the award and then to intimate the
office of Labour Commissioner/respondent no.2.

So far as the

claim of dues submitted by respondent no.4 was concerned, she
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 9 of 75

was directed to approach the labour court to get the amount
computed in the first instance.
Thus, the respondent no.4 was directed to explicitly join
her duties in terms of the Award, between 1st and 15th December,
1995 and that in case she failed to join during this period, she
would not be permitted to join thereafter.
17.

Respondent no.4 thereafter joined her duties on 11th

December, 1995.

In the joining report which she submitted, she

had requested for pay fixation in the appropriate grade as was
given to her colleagues and also demanded resultant benefits and
arrears as per the award.
On the 16th of December, 1995, the respondent no.4
again

demanded amounts,

which according to her

were

recoverable from the petitioner for the period w.e.f. 1st May, 1982
to 30th June, 1995.
18.

Alleging violation of the order of the Supreme Court on

account of non-payment of the amounts which she was
demanding, respondent no.4 also filed contempt petitions before
the Supreme Court.

These Contempt Petitions being nos. 101-

102/96 filed by the respondent no.4 in SLP (Civil) 7198/90, were

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 10 of 75

dismissed by the Supreme Court on 7th April, 1996 wherein the
Court recorded that it was not satisfied that any case was made out
for proceeding against the respondent for alleged contempt of the
Court. The Court, however, clarified that the dismissal of these
petitions would not come in the way of respondent no.4 “in case
she takes recourse to any other remedy available to her in law in an
appropriate forum”.
19.

After dismissal of the Contempt Proceedings, the

respondent no.4 filed an application dated 16th May, 1996 under
Section 36-A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 before the Labour
Commissioner submitting that she was reinstated in service w.e.f.
11th December, 1995 without being treated as confirmed and also
no back wages and benefits in terms of the award have been
provided to her.
According

to

the

respondent

no.

4

despite

representations, the Management had failed to implement the
Award. Therefore, according to the respondent no.4, prima facie
disputes and differences had arisen between the parties with
regard to interpretation of the award dated 30th January, 1990, in
respect of non-confirmation of her service and payment of dues of

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 11 of 75

wages including the arrears.

On these pleas respondent no.4

made the following prayer :“It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that this
learned authority may be pleased to make
necessary reference U/s 36-A of the I.D. Act
1947 so that dispute or difference as exist
between the parties with regard to
interpretation of the Award is resolved by the
learned labour court.”
However, no copy of this application was ever served
upon the petitioner.
20.

It is important to note that the respondent no. 4 has

admittedly been confirmed in service by the petitioner by an order
dated 1st June, 1996. The respondent no. 4 has not raised any
objection that she already stood confirmed and that consequently
for this reason, this order was unnecessary and incorrect.

This

order dated 1st of June, 1996 has also not been assailed in any
judicial proceedings.
21.

So far as the second application dated 16th May, 1996

under Section 36A of the Act was concerned, the petitioner
contested the same on several grounds including, inter alia, that
the second application for the very relief, which stood rejected by
26th November, 1996, was not maintainable.

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 12 of 75

22.

On 6th December, 1996, the Office of the Labour

Commissioner issued a notice to the petitioner requiring it to
submit a written clarification to the Labour Commissioner with
regard to the payment of the dues to Smt.Praveen Bahl
(respondent No.4) in terms of the industrial award dated 31st
January, 1990.

It was stated therein that a report had been

received by the Office of the Labour Commissioner that the
petitioner had not complied with the Court's order. This notice was
followed by a second notice dated 19th December, 1996.
It is noteworthy that the aforesaid notices were issued by
the Labour Commissioner on the application filed by respondent
No.4, which was dated 16th May, 1996.
23.

On 10th January, 1997, the respondent No.4 addressed a

letter to the Labour Commissioner- respondent No.2 herein, which
reads as under :“Sub : Implementation of Award Passed
in I.D.No.46 of 1983 dated
13th January 1990, under Section 33-C(I)
of the I.D.Act, 1947.
Sir,
It is brought to your kind notice that my
application dated 16.5.1996 under Section 36-A
of the I.D. Act 1947 for interpretation of the
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 13 of 75

Award may be treated as withdrawn.
It is therefore requested that the above said
Award be got implemented and my difference of
wages be got paid to me in the pursuance of
Section 33-C(I) of the I.D. Act at the earliest.”
Thereafter, respondent no.2 addressed last and final
notices dated 7th February, 1997 and 24th February, 1997
respectively requiring the petitioner to be present for discussions
with regard to the implementation of the Labour Court's award
No.46/1983.
24.

The petitioner protested against these notices by

writings dated 5th March, 1997 and 15th July, 1997, setting out the
complete details of the payments made and also the fact that the
management had fully implemented the award and nothing
further was payable to the workman.
However, apparently, dissatisfied with the submissions
of the petitioner, the Labour Commissioner disregarded the same
and issued a recovery notice dated 24th July, 1997 purportedly
under Section 33-C(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 for a
sum of Rs.2,48,376/60p holding that the same was payable to the
workman/respondent No.4 for the period from 1st May, 1982 to

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 14 of 75

30th November, 1996.
25.

The petitioner is aggrieved by this recovery certificate

and has impugned the issuance of the same by way of the present
writ petition on the ground that the same is without jurisdiction
and contrary to law. It has been contended that the provisions of
Section 33-C(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are executory
in nature and no certificate can be issued in such a matter where
there had neither been adjudication of the issues raised by the
petitioner nor any decision holding that respondent No.4 was
entitled to payment on the basis of which she was claiming the
same. The other limb of the petitioner's challenge is based on the
contention that respondent No.4 had herself sought reference of
the disputes/difference by way of an application under Section
36A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 which amounted to an
admission that the amount claimed by her had not been
adjudicated upon.

The Labour Commissioner-respondent No.2

had passed an order dated 30th September, 1995 thereon
informing the respondent No.4 that so far as payment was
concerned, in as much as the very facts were disputed, she would
be required to approach the Labour Court by way of industrial

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 15 of 75

adjudication.
It has therefore been contended on behalf of the
petitioner that a view having been taken as contained in the order
dated 13th September, 1995, the respondent No.2 did not have any
power to review the decision taken.

Consequently, the action of

respondent No.2 in entertaining the application under Section 36A
and latterly treating the same application as an application filed
under Section 33 (C) (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, is
contrary to law and without jurisdiction.
26.

So far as the adjudication which culminated in the award

dated 31st January, 1990 is concerned, the petitioner has
contended that the only issue which was referred to adjudication
related to the plea of illegality in the order of termination.

The

issue with regard to extension of probation or denial of the
confirmation was not even referred for consideration before the
industrial adjudicator in the order of reference dated 10th March,
1983. For this reason, it is submitted that the claim of respondent
No.4 which is based on her plea that the extension of her
probation was illegal, has not been adjudicated upon till date and
therefore, she shall not be entitled to any amount based on such a

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 16 of 75

plea.
It is submitted that the amount which the respondent
no.4 has claimed, is an arbitrary amount and according to her is
based on her claim of difference of wages between what has been
paid by the petitioner to her and what she would have been
entitled to as a confirmed employee.

This issue was never

adjudicated upon and was not admitted by the management.
There was no basis for the same. Without giving an opportunity to
the petitioner to contest the same in accordance with law, it is
contended that the same could not have been directed to be paid.
27.

On behalf of the respondent No. 4, Mr. B.K. Pal, learned

counsel has submitted that the submissions of the petitioner
proceed on an erroneous misconception. He places reliance on
provisions of Section 10 (4) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 to
submit that the industrial adjudicator was fully competent to
decide all matters which were incidental to the issue referred to it.
According to Mr. Pal, the issue as to the confirmation of the
respondent no. 4 and the illegality of the extension of a probation
were inherent in the order of reference. According to learned
counsel, the industrial adjudicator has returned a finding that the

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 17 of 75

services of the respondent no. 4 were satisfactory. Reliance has
also been placed on the order dated 8th May, 1990 to contend that
the Division Bench of this court in Writ Petition (C) No. 1416/1990
had also recorded that it was satisfied that the findings of the
Labour Court to the effect that the respondent has been victimized
is based on evidence and is fully justified. The Division Bench had
noticed that the Labour Court had made a provision in the Award
itself with regard to back wages, and therefore the appropriate
authority would determine the arrears which were due to the
respondent. The submission is that this order was finally affirmed
by the Apex Court in its order passed on 20th November, 1995
whereby the respondent was permitted to join duty by the
management. On behalf of the respondent, reliance is also placed
on the order dated 2nd April, 1996 in Contempt Petition No. 101 &
102/1996 in SLP (C) No. 7198-99/1990 which was filed by the
respondent no. 4 whereby, though the contempt petitions were
dismissed, the Apex Court directed that the dismissal of the
petitions would not come in the way of the petitioner in case she
takes recourse to any other remedy available to her in law in an
appropriate forum.

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 18 of 75

28.

Respondent no. 4 has also set up a plea that the

industrial award had held that the action of the management was
illegal and therefore, there was no requirement of relegating the
respondent no. 4 to filing of another industrial reference and
seeking any further adjudication.

It is contended that the

respondent had set up a plea and raised a claim that the petitioner
had assured that she would be confirmed upon expiry of the
probation and on this statement she had withdrawn the grievance
made by her in this behalf before the labour authorities.
According to learned counsel for respondent no. 4, the petitioner
was duly notified of the proceedings and was given a hearing. It
has been contended that the labour authorities issued notices
dated 6th December, 1996, 19th December, 1996, 7th February,
1997, 24th February, 1997 to the respondent. The petitioner is
stated to have filed a reply which was also considered by the
authorities before directing issuance of the recovery certificate.
29.

It is therefore, urged that the action of the Labour

Commissioner in issuing the recovery certificate was justified and
in accordance with law and that the respondent no. 4 could not be
relegated to seeking adjudication of the dispute raised by the

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 19 of 75

petitioner and to filing of another industrial dispute.
30.

Having heard learned counsel for the parties and

perused the available record, to my mind, three fundamental
questions arise for consideration in the instant case. The same can
be enumerated as follows:(i)

whether the direction to reinstate into service a

workman would ipso facto amount to a direction by the industrial
adjudicator to reinstate the workman as a confirmed employee in
the post she/he was holding as a probationer wherefrom he was
terminated from service;
(ii)

whether the appropriate government had any authority

to pass an order for issuance of a recovery certificate for recovery
of dues claimed by the respondent no. 4 without an adjudication
by the Labour Court on the same as directed by the order dated
13th September, 1995; and
(iii)

whether the appropriate government by its order dated

13th September, 1995 having held that the respondent no. 4 was
required to go to the appropriate court for getting the amount of
her dues computed, had authority or jurisdiction to review the
same.

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 20 of 75

31.

With regard to the issue no. 1, it is necessary to examine

the prayers made by the respondent no. 4 in her complaints and
claims before the Conciliation Officer/industrial adjudicator.
Before the Conciliation Officer, the respondent No.4 made a
prayer

that

the

Conciliation

Officer

may

persuade

the

Management to reinstate the retrenched employee with all
benefits.
32.

By the order dated 10th of March, 1983, the only issue

which was referred for adjudication was as to whether the services
of the respondent no. 4 were terminated unjustifiedly or illegally.
In the statement of claim filed by the petitioner dated 28th May,
1983, the petitioner thus sought the following prayers:“9. Since the management promised to confirm
the employee on expiry of extended period of
probation the conciliation officer did not proceed
with the matter further. As stated earlier the
services of Mrs. Pravin Bahl were terminated on
30.4.82. A copy of the letter of termination is
annexed (Annexure-III) the Union demands
immediate reinstatement of Mrs. Bahl vide letter
dated 3.5.82. A copy of the representation made
by the Union is annexed as Annexure-IV.
10. In view of the submissions aforesaid, the
workman through its Union respectfully prays
that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to direct
the management.

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 21 of 75

(i) To reinstate the workman, Mrs. Pravin Bahl.
(ii)
to award her all backwages and other
benefits under her service.
(iii)
To confirm her to the post of Junior
Stenographer.”
33.

Perusal of the entire record relied upon by the parties

and placed before this court would show that there was neither any
claim nor any issue raised that the respondent no. 4 was entitled to
be considered as a confirmed employee or that he/she was entitled
to the same wages as those of confirmed employees. There was no
such pleadings before the industrial adjudicator. There was no
grievance even with regard to the extension of the probation made
by the petitioner nor any adjudication sought on this aspect by her.
The award dated 31st January, 1990 has directed payment of an
amount to the respondent no. 4 bearing in mind “what she would
have drawn had she continued in service”. There is no finding
anywhere in the award that the respondent no. 4 would be entitled
to any particular wage or wage scale or that she was required to be
considered as a confirmed employee.
34.

It is evident, therefore, that though the respondent no. 4

specifically prayed for a direction to be made to the petitioner to
confirm her in service, this prayer was not pressed before the

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 22 of 75

industrial adjudicator. There is no finding or direction in this
behalf in the award dated 31st January, 1990.
35.

The respondent no. 4 herself was conscious of the fact

that there was neither any finding to the effect that the extension
of the probation was illegal nor any award holding or directing that
the respondent no. 4 was a confirmed employee and was required
to be reinstated in service in such capacity. Conscious of this, the
respondent no. 4 filed the application under Section 36 A of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 praying that the award be sent back
to the industrial adjudicator for clarification. This application was
dismissed as not maintainable by the Labour Commissioner by the
order dated 26th November, 1990. Thereafter, the respondent no.
4 filed an application dated 20th March, 1995 seeking
implementation of the award dated 31st January, 1990 which
became enforceable on its publication with effect from 29th May,
1990. The respondent no. 4 had assailed the order passed by the
Labour Commissioner on 26th November, 1990 in her application
under Section 36 A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. This court
while considering Writ Petition (C) No. 178/1991 which was filed
by the respondent no. 4 assailing the order dated 26th November,

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 23 of 75

1990 had noticed that the present petitioner had contended that
there was no ambiguity in the award and that it was prepared to
accept the respondent no. 4 in service on the terms mentioned in
the letter issued to her to join duty. The court had also noticed
that the respondent no. 4 was objecting to the terms imposed by
the petitioner on the contention that they were in infringement or
in violation of the award published by the Labour Court. The court
consciously held that in view of the request of the respondent no. 4
in the application dated 20th March, 1995 to the labour authorities
seeking implementation of the award, the question to determine or
to interpret the award or to hold that it is clear or vague as
required under Section 36 A of the Industrial Disputes Act does
not arise. This writ petition was disposed of with a direction to the
appropriate competent authority to take steps to implement the
award in accordance with law after hearing both parties.
36.

In the light of the above, it is apparent that the

respondent no. 4 was herself of the view that the award dated 31st
January, 1990 had not given her the complete relief while only
directing reinstatement into service. For this reason, the workman
had herself sought reference to the Labour Court under Section 36

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 24 of 75

A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
The Special Leave Petition was dismissed on 21st
November, 1995 directing that the respondent no. 4 would be
entitled to all benefits given to her under the award.
37.

The petitioner claims to have issued letters to the

respondent no. 4 to join duty on 25th May, 1990 but she did not do
so. Again, letter dated 17th August, 1995 was issued to her, which
also she did not comply. By the order dated 13th September, 1995,
the Labour Commissioner directed the respondent no. 4 to contact
the concerned District Labour Officer for reinstatement in terms of
the award. So far as the claims of dues submitted by her on the
basis of her being a confirmed employee was concerned, the
Labour Commissioner clearly directed her to approach the
appropriate labour court to get the amount computed in the first
instance.
38.

The petitioner made an application under Section 36 A

of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, which was rejected by the
appropriate government vide its order dated 26th November, 1990
holding that the same was not maintainable. The application of
the petitioner seeking implementation of the award was disposed

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 25 of 75

of by the appropriate government vide its order dated 13th
September, 1995 directing that for the purposes of reinstatement,
the respondent no. 4 could approach the District Labour Officer.
For the purposes of dues which were being pressed by respondent
no. 4 on the ground of her being a confirmed employee, the
appropriate

government

relegated

the

petitioner

to

the

appropriate Labour Court for getting the amount computed.
39.

Respondent no. 4 did not assail the order dated 13th

September, 1995 which has attained finality. On the contrary, she
moved yet another application on 16th May, 1996 under Section 36
A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

This application was

withdrawn by her by the letter dated 10th January, 1997 wherein
she stated that she may be paid her dues under Section 33 -C (1) of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
40.

My attention has also been drawn to an application

bearing CM No. 67/1994 dated 16th December, 1993 filed by the
workman in Writ Petition (C) No. 178/1991. The respondent no. 4
in this application has averred as follows:“11. That accordingly, the present application is
being made before this Hon'ble Court for issuing
necessary directions to the effect so that the
petitioner is able to resume her duties as a
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 26 of 75

confirmed employee of the respondent and also is
allowed to draw the relevant grade salary which
she is entitled to receive as a reinstated employee
like other colleagues which the petitioner would
have been receiving without break in service.”
41.

On the basis of these averments, the respondent no. 4,

wanting that she should be taken back as a confirmed employee
made the following prayer:“It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that this
Hon'ble High Court may release to make
appropriate necessary order to the effect that the
petitioner is enable to resume her duties as a
confirmed employee of the respondent drawing
the salary as per relevant grade which the
petitioner is entitled to receive as if she continues
to be in service from the date of termination (i.e.
30.04.1982) as ordered by the Labour Court vide
its Award dated 30.1.1990. This order may be
made without prejudice to the rights of the
petitioner of receiving all the necessary
consequential benefits which the petitioner is
legally entitle to receive. Any other order/orders
may please be passed which this Hon'ble Court
deems fit and proper in the circumstances of the
case.”
42.

The request made by the respondent no. 4 in this

application was never granted. The writ petition as noticed above,
was disposed of by the order passed on 25th July, 1995.
43.

It is noteworthy that the respondent no. 4 was also

making a prayer that she should be given the same salary as was
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 27 of 75

paid to other stenos which was not on the basis of her having been
deemed to be confirmed on a particular date prior to the passing
of the award.
44.

In this behalf, it would be useful to notice the

submission of respondent no. 4 in her joining letter dated 11th
December, 1995 wherein after referring the order of the Supreme
Court dated 20th November, 1995 and the dismissal of the writ
petition and the special leave petition at the instance of the
petitioner, the respondent no. 4 stated thus:“A medical certificate from the Doctor as well as
relieving certificate dated
from the previous
employer is also being enclosed and annexed.
I request for being allowed to resume duty
forthwith and accordingly may also be fixed in the
appropriate grade as being given to my
colleagues. The resulting benefits and arrears as
per award may also be provided and paid to me.”
The respondent no. 4 was thus insisting for the arrears
as were paid to her colleagues without asserting any claim of
confirmation.
45.

It is noteworthy that neither the industrial adjudicator

nor any of the courts has passed an order holding that the
extension of the probation of respondent no. 4 was an act of
victimization.

There is no direction that the respondent no. 4

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 28 of 75

stood confirmed.

Assuming that the finding of the industrial

adjudicator to the effect that the services of the respondent no. 4
was satisfactory and that termination of her services was illegal
and unjustified amounted to an order against the petitionermanagement holding that the extension of her probation was also
illegal, the question would then arise as to what is the date from
which she could be held to be confirmed and what would be the
benefits, monetary or otherwise, to which she would be entitled.
There has neither been any adjudication on this aspect nor any
findings by any appropriate forum or court in this behalf.
46.

The Supreme Court directed the respondent no. 4 to join

duties between 1st to 15th of December, 1995 by its order dated
20th November, 1995.

The respondent no. 4 has admittedly

joined duties in terms of the offer made by the petitioner on the
11th of December, 1995. In continuation of her objection that she
was a confirmed employee and contending that the action of the
petitioner in reinstating her on the terms on which it had done so
was contumacious, respondent no. 4 filed Contempt Petition Nos.
101 & 102/1996. This contempt petition was also dismissed by the
apex court which clearly held that no cause was made out for

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 29 of 75

proceeding against the present petitioner for allegedly committing
contempt of court. The court clarified that the dismissal of the
petition would not come in her way in case the respondent no. 4
“takes recourse to any other remedy available to her in law in an
appropriate forum.” This order was clearly based on the defence
taken by the petitioner to the effect that respondent no. 4 could
only be reinstated in the post wherefrom her services had been
terminated. The respondent no. 4 has accepted the fact that there
was no such finding/direction in the award dated 31st January,
1990 whereby it could have been held or directed that the
respondent no. 4 was a confirmed employee. For this reason, she
filed a second application dated 16th May, 1996 under Section 36
A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. In this application after
reproducing the findings returned by the Labour Court, the
workman pleaded thus:“5.
That earlier also the workman
concerned moved an application U/s 36-A of the
I.D. Act which was not considered as such the
workman concerned filed civil writ petition No.

13.
That in the aforesaid circumstances it is
prima facie evident that a dispute or difference
has arisen between the parties with regard to
interpretation of the Award dated 30.01.1990
whereby the workman has been given the relief of
reinstatement in service with difference of wages
and the workman concerned deemed to be in
continuous service.
14.
That in the Award it has been made
explicitly clear that the probation period of the
workman was extended malafidely and
accordingly termination so made has also been
held to be malafide and illegal.
15.
That non-confirmation of the petitioner
even till date on resumption of duty w.e.f.
11.12.1995 as well as non-payment of difference of
wages including arrears by the management is
against the Award dated 30.01.1990 due to which
the workman concerned is seriously aggrieved.”
47.

After reproducing the statutory provisions of Section 36

A of the Industrial Disputes Act, the respondent no. 4 sought the

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 31 of 75

following prayers:“It is therefore respectfully prayed that this
learned authority may be pleased to make
necessary reference under Section 36-A of the
I.D. Act, 1947 so that dispute or difference as exist
between the parties with regard to interpretation
of the Award is resolved by the learned labour
court.”
48.

From the aforegoing facts, it is apparent that no

direction had been made in the impugned award dated 31st
January, 1990 holding that the respondent no. 4 was a confirmed
employee or that she was entitled to wages on the basis of salary
payable to regular employee.

The respondent no. 4 has not

assailed the order dated 13th September, 1995 directing her to
seek computation of the amount payable to her by approaching the
appropriate labour court.
49.

It is noteworthy that the respondent no. 4 in para 9 of

her claims noticed above, herself has set up a case that the
petitioner had agreed to confirm her upon the expiry of the period
of the extended probation. Therefore, to the extent that the
respondent no. 4 has asserted that the industrial adjudicator had
held that the extension of the probation was also an act of
victimization is unsupported by the case set up by the respondent

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 32 of 75

no. 4.
50.

The respondent no. 4 was also conscious of the fact that

there had been no adjudication nor any finding or direction
returned by the Labour Court on her plea that she was a confirmed
employee.

The petitioner contested the application filed by

respondent no. 4 under Section 36 A of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947. In its reply dated 26th November, 1996, it was pointed
out that there was no dispute/differences in the earlier industrial
adjudication which required any clarification and for this reason,
the order dated 26th November, 1990 has been passed declining to
refer such matter to the Labour Court under Section 36 A of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Additionally, it was pointed out in
para 4 of the reply that:“....In any case and without prejudice, the Award
has now been implemented after the judgment of
the Supreme Court dated 20.11.1995, and the
petitioner has been reinstated in services with
effect from 11.12.1995 and she joined her services
without any protest. She has now been confirmed
w.e.f. 11.6.1996.”
This fact was reiterated elsewhere in the reply.
51.

Section 36 A of the Industrial Disputes Act empowers

the appropriate government, if in its opinion there is any difficulty

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 33 of 75

or doubt arising as to the interpretation of any provision of an
award, to make a reference of such question to the labour court, as
it may think fit, the labour court is thereafter required to give the
parties an opportunity of being heard, to decide such question
which decision shall be final and binding on all parties.
52.

The issue in the instant case, however, is even more

fundamental.

So far as the pleas raised by respondent no. 4

relating to the extension of her probation and confirmation are
concerned, no issue in terms thereof was referred for adjudication
to the labour court. The labour court also did not frame any such
issue. The respondent no. 4 had earlier filed an application under
Section 36 A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 which was
decided by the appropriate government by its order dated 26th
November, 1990 holding that no such clarification was necessary.
53.

This question assumes importance in view of the clear

stipulation in her letter of appointment dated 14th October, 1980
wherein it was clearly stipulated that “the respondent no. 4 will
continue to remain on probation till the letter of confirmation is
issued to her.” Confirmation was subject to the services being
found satisfactory and subject to the respondent no. 4 being found

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 34 of 75

medically fit by a doctor nominated by the company.
Therefore, in the face of such stipulation being
contained in the appointment letter, undoubtedly, even if it were
to be held that the findings of the industrial adjudicator amounted
to setting aside the letter extending her confirmation, the
respondent no. 4 could not be held to be confirmed without
further directions in this behalf.
54.

Adjudication before the industrial adjudicator under the

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 can commence only if the
appropriate government makes an order of reference referring the
dispute which requires adjudication to the industrial adjudicator.
The adjudication and the decision of the industrial adjudicator has
to be confined to the question referred to it. In fact, jurisdiction is
derived by the industrial adjudicator from the order of reference
passed by the appropriate government under Section 10 of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. It is not open to the industrial
adjudicator to enlarge the scope of jurisdiction beyond the terms
of reference. Thus, in AIR 1967 SC 469 entitled The Delhi
Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd. Vs. The Workmen &
Ors., the reference included the issue as to whether the strike and

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 35 of 75

the lockout at the Delhi Cloth Mills as well as the strike at the
Swatantra Bharat Mills was justified and legal and whether the
workmen were entitled to wages during the period of the strike. It
was held by the Apex Court that the Industrial Tribunal must look
to the pleadings of the parties to know the exact nature of the
dispute, however, it could not enlarge scope of its jurisdiction and
decide that there was no strike or lockout at all. In this behalf, the
court observed thus:“17.
On behalf of the respondents, Mr. Chari
put before us four propositions which according
to him the Tribunal had to consider before
coming to a decision on these two issues. They
were : (i) The fact that there was a recital of
dispute in the order of reference did not show that
the Government had come to a decision on the
dispute; (ii) The order of reference only limited
the Tribunal's jurisdiction in that it was not
competent to go beyond the heads or points of
dispute; (iii) Not every recital of fact mentioned
in the order of Government was irrebutable; and
(iv) In order to fix the ambit of the dispute it was
necessary to refer to the pleadings of the parties.
No exception can be taken to the first two points.
The correctness of the third proposition would
depend on the language of the recital.
18.
So far as the fourth proposition is
concerned, Mr. Chari argued that the Tribunal
had to examine the pleadings of the parties to see
whether there was a strike at all. In our opinion,
the Tribunal must, in any event, look to the
pleadings of the parties to find out the exact
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 36 of 75

nature of the dispute, because in most cases the
order of reference is so cryptic that it is
impossible to cull out therefrom the various point
about which the parties were at variance leading
to the trouble. In this case, the order of reference
was based on the report of the Conciliation Officer
and it was certainly open to the Management to
show that the dispute which had been referred
was not an industrial dispute at all so as to attract
jurisdiction under the Industrial Disputes Act.
But the parties cannot be allowed to go a stage
further and contend that the foundation of the
dispute mentioned in the order of reference was
non-existent and that the true dispute was
something else. Under S.10 (4) of the Act it is not
competent to the Tribunal to entertain such a
question.”
55.

In the instant case, the order of reference was explicit

and clear. Respondent no. 4 was conscious of the same while
drafting the claims and even sought a prayer in respect of the
confirmation which it appears, was not pressed. The industrial
adjudicator strictly directed reinstatement into service.
56.

For the purposes of consideration of the issue as to

whether the award passed by the industrial adjudicator directing
reinstatement has been implemented or not it become necessary
to examine the meaning of the expression 'reinstatement'. In the
Collins Concise Dictionary 3rd Edition at page 1129 'reinstatement'
is defined as “to restore to former rank or condition”.
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 37 of 75

The meaning given to the expression in the Legal
Glossary published by the Government of India, 1988 Edition at
page 285 is “to reinstall; to re-establish, to place again in former
state, condition or office, to restore to a state or position from
which the object or person had been removed.”
57.

This expression has also fallen for judicial interpretation

in several pronouncements. In 1981 (1) LLJ 386, Surendra
Kumar Verma & Ors. Vs. The Central Government
Industrial

Tribunal,

New

Delhi,

in

para

7

of

the

pronouncement, the Supreme Court held thus:“.......The Labour Court appears to have thought
that the award of the relief of reinstatement with
full back wages would put these workmen on a par
with those who had qualified for permanent
absorption by passing the prescribed test and that
would create dissatisfaction amongst the latter.
First, they can never be on par since
reinstatement would not qualify them for
permanent absorption. They would continue to
be temporary, liable to be retrenched.”
58.

Similarly, in 1995 LLR 924, Government of NCT of

Delhi Vs. Kamlesh & Ors., it was held that reinstatement
means to restore status quo ante and this court observed thus:“However, the third contention has to be upheld.
Having adjudged the termination to be illegal, the
Labour Court could have directed the status quo
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 38 of 75

ante to be restored but could not also have
allowed relief which was beyond the scope of the
terms of reference made to it. The question
referred to the Labour Court was : Whether the
termination of the services of Smt. Kamlesh is
illegal and unjustified and if so what relief is she
entitled and what directions are necessary in this
respect? It is apparent that while answering the
question and making the Award, the Labour
Court could not have further entered into and
decided the question whether the employee was
entitled to regular pay-scale along with DA and
additional DA.”
59.

In 2002 SCC (L & S) 1010, Deep Chandra Vs.

State of U.P. & Anr., the Apex Court in para 2 of the report held
that such an employee would be reinstated in his original service
on the same terms and conditions in which he was working earlier.
60.

It would be useful to notice the observations of the

Bench in 1943 K.B. 462, Hodge Vs. Ultra Electric Ltd. In
this case, the arguments on behalf of the appellant were noticed
thus:“The natural and prima facie meaning of the word
“reinstate” as applied to a person who has been
dismissed is to replace him in the position from
which he was dismissed in such a way as fully to
restore the status quo ante the dismissal.”
In the judgment of the Bench rendered by Charles, J
(page 465) of the report, it was observed thus:-

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 39 of 75

“The respondents did not exhibit any desire to
evade their responsibilities or in any way to flout
or disregard the direction given lawfully by the
national service officer under the Essential Work
(General Provisions) Order, 1942. They took Mrs.
Birch back into their service. They put her again
on the pay-roll at the same rate of wages. They
paid her those wages. They insured her under the
National Health Insurance Act, and they treated
her in every way as she had been treated before,
that is to say, as an employee in their service, save
only, that they gave her no work. The reason for
that, as the justices have found as a fact, was that,
when she attended at the respondents' premises
on August 10, there was no work available for her
to do. It appears to me that in a case of this kind
the word “reinstatement” connotes the putting
back, so far as is possible, of the person dismissed
into the same position as that which he occupied
when the dismissal took place. I cannot give
accord to the submission that the idea of giving
work is not to receive any consideration. I think
it must; because work and wages are very closely
knit together under the regulations and the
Essential Work Order. Equally do I feel, however,
that when employers are directed to reinstate an
employee and they do all that the respondents did
here to put that employee back in his previous
position and only fail to provide him with work
because there is no work for him to do, those
employers have, in fact, reinstated the employee.
I, therefore, think that the justices were right in
dismissing the information, and the appeal must
be dismissed with costs.
In the concurring judgment rendered by Croom
Johnson, J, it was further observed thus:“The duty to reinstate must be a duty to put the
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 40 of 75

employee back in the same job and under the
same terms and conditions. I assume that there
was an obligation on the respondents to find some
work for Mrs. Birch, but I cannot think that there
was an obligation to find work every day or to find
what was described in one of the cases to which
we were referred, as continuous work. Without
citing them I may refer to the observations of A.L.
Smith M.R. in Turner V. Sawdon & Co. (I). If
there were an obligation to find continuous work,
an action would lie at the suit of the servant for
not being given enough work or a fair share of the
work. In other words, the obligation on the
employer is an obligation to give work if there is
work available, and not an absolute obligation to
give work then there is none in fact. That being
so, the word “reinstatement” not being a term of
art and having no specialized meaning but being a
word to be accorded its ordinary sense, I can see
no trace of the justices having proceeded on any
wrong basis in law in arriving at the conclusion
which they reached.”
61.

Undoubtedly, in the case of the petitioner the Labour

Court in its award dated 31st January, 1990 has held that the
respondent no. 4 would be reinstated into service and further
would be paid wages which were equivalent to the difference in the
wages which she had earned up till the passing of the award with
other firms and the salary which she would have drawn if she had
been working with the present management. It was specifically
directed that she would be reinstated from the date of termination
of her services. There was no finding and no direction that she
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 41 of 75

was a confirmed employee or the date from which she was
confirmed in service or the wages which she would have drawn as
a confirmed employee.
62.

At this stage, it is necessary to examine another

argument on behalf of the respondent no. 4 in support of the
submission that respondent no. 4 was a confirmed employee and
therefore entitled to all benefits.

It has been contended that

respondent No.4 has been held to have completed her
probationary period satisfactorily. Therefore, merely because the
petitioner has not passed an order of confirmation, would not have
any impact on her services which would be deemed to have been
confirmed or that there would be implied confirmation of the
same.

Mr. B.K. Pal, learned counsel for the respondent no. 4 has

submitted that the respondent no. 4 was entitled to the relief
granted to her in view of the principles laid down by the Apex
Court in 1987(Supple) SCC 1363,

M.K.Aggarwal Vs.

Gurgaon Gramin Bank; 1987 (4) SCC 482, State of
Gujarat Vs. Akhilesh C. Bhargav & Ors and AIR 1988
SC 1673, Shiv Kumar Sharma Vs. Haryana State
Electricity Board.

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 42 of 75

Unfortunately, perusal of the law on this aspect of the
matter does not support the submissions of learned counsel for
respondent No.4.

In M.K.Aggarwal Vs. Gurgaon Gramin

Bank (supra), the rules provided the maximum period of
probation.

The same could be for one year in the first instance

and could be extended by a further period of six months.

Thus,

there was a limitation on the part of the employer to extend the
probation beyond 18 months coupled with the further requirement
that at the end of it, the services of the probationer should either
be confirmed or discharged. It was in the face of such a position
in the rules that if the probationer was not discharged at or before
the expiry of maximum period of probation, that the Apex Court
held that there would be implied confirmation as there was no
statutory indication as to what should follow in the absence of
express confirmation at the end of the maximum permissible
period of probation.
So far as the respondent no. 4 is concerned, the
appointment letter dated 14th October, 1980 contained a clear
stipulation that the respondent No.4 would be on probation
initially for a period of 12 months or for such further period as the

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 43 of 75

management would decide in its sole discretion.

There was a

further stipulation that respondent No.4 would “continue to
remain on probation till a letter of confirmation is issued” to her.
Such being the position, so far as the conditions of
service of respondent No. 4 are concerned, it cannot be contended
that merely because the period of probation provided had expired,
there would be implied or deemed confirmation.
63.

The position in 1987 (Supple) SCC 1363, State of

Gujarat Vs. Akhilesh C. Bhargav & Ors. was similar.

The

applicable rules provided that no probationer should be kept on
probation for more than double the normal period of two years, in
the applicable administrative instructions. Since the rules did not
contain any specific provision, these administrative instructions
were held to be binding and consequently a probationer
continuing in service for five years without any written order was
held to be deemed to have been confirmed.
64.

Similarly, in AIR 1988 SC 1673, Shiv Kumar Vs.

HSEB, Chandigarh, the Court was concerned with arbitrariness
and illegality in fixing the seniority list, after delay in passing an
order of confirmation in favour of an employee. The issues raised

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 44 of 75

before the Apex Court in this pronouncement do not arise in the
instant case and for this reason, the same does not apply to the
facts and circumstances of the instant case.
65.

In this behalf, the petitioner has also placed reliance on

the pronouncement dated 21st January, 1964 of the Apex Court in
Kesho Ram Cotton Mills Ltd. Vs. Gangadhar, reported in
AIR 1963 SC 7031. In this case, it was held by the Apex Court
that a probationer cannot after the expiry of the probationary
period automatically acquire the status of a permanent member of
a service, unless of course, the rules under which he is appointed
expressly provide for such a result.

Therefore, even though a

probationer may have continued to act in the post to which he is
appointed on probation for more than the initial period of
probation, he cannot become a permanent servant merely because
of the efflux of time unless the rules of service which govern him
specially laid down that the probationer will be automatically
confirmed after the initial period of probation is over.
66.

To the same effect are the principles laid down by the

Supreme Court in AIR 1964 SC 806 entitled Management of
the Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. Madurai Vs. Presiding

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 45 of 75

Officer Labour Court Madurai.
In this case the, the matter related to an employee who
was appointed on probation for six months. The Court held that
there can be no doubt about the position in law that an employee
appointed on probation for six months continues as a probationer
even after the period of six months if at the end of the period his
services had either not been terminated or he is confirmed. The
court held that without anything more, an appointment on
probation for six months gives the employer no right to terminate
the service of an employee before six months had expired, except
on the ground of misconduct or other sufficient reasons in which
case even the services of a permanent employee could be
terminated. At the end of the six months period the employer can
either confirm him or terminate his services because his service is
found unsatisfactory. If no action is taken by the employer either
by way of confirmation or by way of termination, the employee
continues to be in service as a probationer.
67.

In AIR 1991 SC 1402, Municipal Corporation

Raipur Vs.Ashok Kumar Mishra, the Court held thus :
“6.
Exercise of the power to extend the
probation is hedged with the existence of the
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 46 of 75

rule in that regard followed by positive act of
either confirmation of the probation or
discharge from service or reversion to the
substantive post within a reasonable time after
the expiry of the period of probation. If the
rules do not empower the appointing authority
to extend the probation beyond the prescribed
period, or where the rules are absent about
confirmation or passing of the prescribed test
for confirmation of probation and inaction for a
very long time may lead to an indication of the
satisfactory completion of probation. But in
this case R.8 expressly postulates otherwise.
The period of probation is subject to extension
by order in writing for another period of one
year. Passing the prescribed examinations and
successful completion of probation and to make
an order of confirmation are condition
precedent. Mere expiry of the initial period of
probation does not automatically have the effect
of deemed confirmation and the status of a
deemed confirmation and the status of a
deemed confirmation of the probation.
An
express order in that regard only confers the
status of an approved probationer. We are of
the view that note of sub-rule (2) read with subrule (6) of Rule 8 manifests the legislative intent
that confirmation of the probation of the
respondent would be made only on successful
completion of the probation and the passing of
the prescribed examinations.
It is not the
respondent's case that he passed all the
examinations.
He shall be deemed to be
continued on probation. Before confirmation
the appointing authority is empowered to
terminate the service of the probationer by
issuing one calender month's notice in writing
and on expiry thereof the service stands
terminated without any further notice. Within
three months from the date of expiry of original
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 47 of 75

two years period of probation and within one
year's period, the order of termination was
made. In this view the question of conducting
an inquiry under the Classification, Control and
Appeal (Rules) after giving an opportunity and
that too for specific charges does not arise. The
High Court, therefore, committed manifest error
of law in decreeing the suit.
By an interim
order passed by this Court, the respondent
received a sum of Rs.5,000/- from the
appellant. The appellant shall not recover the
same from him.
The appeal is accordingly
allowed. The judgment and decree of the High
Court is set aside and that of the trial Court and
the 1st Appellate Court are confirmed. But in
the circumstances parties are directed to bear
their own costs.”
68.

In view of the principles laid down by the Supreme

Court in these cases and having regard to the terms and conditions
of the letter of appointment, I have no manner of doubt that in the
instant case the respondent No.4 cannot be held to have been
confirmed impliedly.
Reference can also be appropriately made in this behalf
on the pronouncements of the Apex Court reported at (1998) 8
SCC 767 entitled Dr. Amritlal Dharshibhai Jhankharia
Vs. State of Gujarat and (1985) 2 SCC page 5 entitled
Dhanjibhai Ramjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat.
69.

For this reason as well, it has to be held that the

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 48 of 75

direction to reinstate the workman into service would not amount
to a direction ipso facto by the industrial adjudicator to confirm
the workman in the post he was holding as a probationer at the
time of termination of his service.
70.

In these circumstances, it has to be held that the

respondent no. 4 had to be restored to status quo ante and had to
be put back in the place occupied by her when her services were
terminated on 30th April, 1982. Admittedly, respondent no. 4 was
not a confirmed employee on this date. She was on probation and
she could not have been reinstated in any other post, position or
capacity. So far as the first question is concerned, it is therefore
held that the direction to reinstate the respondent no. 4 into
service did not ipso fact amount to a direction to reinstate the
workman as a confirmed employee in the post wherefrom she was
terminated.
71.

So far as the second question is concerned, it is

submitted on behalf of the respondent no. 4 that under the
provisions of Section 33 (C) (1), labour authorities were entitled to
direct payment of wages on the higher rate to the workman
inasmuch as the same only involved an arithmetical calculation.

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 49 of 75

Reliance has been placed on the pronouncement of the apex court
in 1966 SC 616, Sawatram Ramprasad Mills Co. Ltd.,
Akola Vs. Baliram Ukandaji & Anr. and the pronouncement
of the High Court of Judicature at Kolkata reported at AIR 1953
SC 613, Bilash Chandra Mitra Vs. Balmer Lawrie & Co.
Ltd.
72.

In Sawatram Ramprasad Mills Co. Ltd., Akola

Vs. Baliram Ukandaji & Anr. (supra), the workmen were
claiming from the mills compensation for the period of lay off.
The objection of the management to the application under Section
33 (C) (1) was not on account of any issue with regard to
entitlement but it was on the ground that in a petition under
Section 33 (C) (1) of the Act, the claim for lay off is not a claim for
money due because calculations have to be made before the
money due can be found. In this behalf, the Apex Court held that
“it is not essential that a claim which can be brought before the
government or its delegatee under Section 33 (C) (1) must always
be for a predetermined sum. The government or the labour court
may satisfy itself about the exact amount and then take action
under that section.”

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 50 of 75

In this case, the dates of the lay off were known and each
workman would show the Labour Court that he was qualified to
receive the compensation for the lay off which would be shown
from the muster roll which was maintained by the management.
It was thus held to be a simple arithmetical calculation, which the
Apex Court permitted under Section 33 (C) (1) of the Act.
73.

To the same effect are the observations of the apex court

in Kays Construction Co. Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of U.P. &
Ors., AIR 1965 SC 1488. The court held thus:“7.
.......Every case of calculation,
however simple, would have to go first before a
Tribunal. In our judgment, a case such as the
present, where the money due is back wages
for the period of unemployment is covered by
the first sub-section and not the second.......”
The observations of the apex court in its judgment in
fact, lend support to the submission on behalf of the petitioner.
74.

Similarly, in AIR 1953 SC 613 entitled Bilash

Chandra Mitra Vs. Balmer Lawrie & Co. Ltd., the Calcutta
High Court held that:“17.
The next question relates to the scope
and effect of the Award. It is contended by Mr.
De that as the company did not at any time
reinstate the plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot claim
any salary or allowance. It appears to me that the
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 51 of 75

contention of Mr. De cannot be accepted. The
Award declares that the plaintiff is reinstated to
his previous service and post with effect from the
date on which the Award would become effective
and as consequences of reinstatement the
plaintiff would get arrears of pay and allowances.
Further, a time limit was fixed within which the
amount had to be paid. It is thus clear that
nothing was left to be done by the defendant
company. The plaintiff was restored to his service
by the Award itself and he was declared entitled
to arrears of pay and allowances. There was
automatic reinstatement by virtue of the Award.
The award fixed the liability of the company to
pay the arrears of salary and allowances. In other
words, a sort of decree for a sum to be calculated
arithmetically had been passed against the
defendant and in favour of the plaintiff.”
Therefore, there was no issue, as in the instant case, as
to the status in which the workman was required to be reinstated
or the wages to which he would be entitled.
75.

In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties, it

would be appropriate to consider the provisions of Section 33 (C)
(1) and (2) and Section 36 A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 in
extenso which read thus:“Section 33 (C) (1) Recovery of Money Due
from an Employer – Where any money is due
to a workman from an employer under a
settlement or an award or under the provisions of
[Chapter VA or Chapter VB] the workman himself
or any other person authorized by him in writing
in this behalf, or, in the case of the death of the
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 52 of 75

workman, his assignee or heirs may, without
prejudice to any other mode of recovery, make an
application to the appropriate Government for the
recovery of the money due to him, and if the
appropriate Government is satisfied that any
money is so due, it shall issue certificate for that
amount to the Collector who shall proceed to
recover the same in the same manner as an arrear
of land revenue:
Provided that every such application shall be
made within one year from the date on which the
money became due to the workman from the
employer:
Provided further that any such application may be
entertained after the expiry of the said period of
one year, if the appropriate Government is
satisfied that the applicant had sufficient cause for
not making the application within the said period.
(2) Where any workman is entitled to receive
from the employer any money or any benefit
which is capable of being computed in terms of
money and if any question arises as to the amount
of money due or as to the amount at which such
benefit should be computed, then the question
may, subject to any rules that may be made under
this Act, be decided by such Labour Court as may
be specified in this behalf by the appropriate
Government [within a period not exceeding three
months.]
[Provided that where the presiding officer of a
Labour Court considers it necessary or expedient
so to do, he may, for reasons to be recorded in
writing, extend such period by such further period
as he may think fit.]
Section 36 A. Power to remove difficulties
– (1) If, in the opinion of the appropriate
Government, any difficulty or doubt arises as to
the interpretation of any provision of an award or
settlement, it may refer the question to such
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 53 of 75

Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal as it
may think fit.
(2) The Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal to which such question is referred shall,
after giving the parties an opportunity of being
heard, decide such question and its decision shall
be final and binding on all such parties.”
76.

The question as to the scope and nature of proceedings

under Section 33 (C) (1) also arose for consideration before this
court in M/s Weston Electroniks Ltd. Vs. Union of India
reported at 1997 (1) AD (DELHI) 538. The Division Bench of
this court authoritatively laid down the principles thus:“37.
From the aforesaid discussion, we
conclude that the proceedings under Section 33-C
(1) are in the nature of execution proceedings
providing an additional mode of speedy recovery
of money due to a workman from an employer
under a settlement or an award or the provisions
of Chapter V-A or Chapter V-B. Section 33-C (1)
does not vest any power of adjudication on the
appropriate government except to the limited
extent of examining the facts to find out whether
objections to jurisdiction of the appropriate
government has been taken by the employer
simply with a view to oust the jurisdiction of the
appropriate government under the said Section
and deprive the workman of money due to him.
On the interpretation of Section 33-C (1) of the
Act and scope of power of the appropriate
government under this Section, we summarise
our conclusions as follows:(i) Proceedings under Section 33-C (1) of the Act
are in the nature of execution proceedings.

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 54 of 75

(ii) The appropriate government has not been
invested with powers of a Labour Court or
Industrial Tribunal to hold a formal enquiry.
(iii) In case the management raises bona fide
dispute/s on the right of a workman to claim of
money due under a settlement or an award or
under the provisions of Chapter V-A or V-B, the
appropriate government has no right of
adjudication of such dispute/s.
(iv) In case of bona fide dispute about the right of
a workman of the money claimed as due from the
management, the workman will have to raise an
industrial dispute for reference being made for
adjudication by the Labour Court/Industrial
Tribunal.
(v) The appropriate government has, however, a
limited right of examining the objection of the
management to the claim of the workman, only to
form a prima facie opinion whether the objection
of the management is perverse, frivolous or mala
fide taken with a view to deprive the workman of
the money due to him.
(vi) The appropriate government is required to
afford a reasonable opportunity complying with
the principles of natural justice to the
management and the workman before taking a
decision under Section 33-C (1) and is also
required to make a speaking order giving reasons
so that the aggrieved party – management or
workman may seek judicial review of the decision
of the appropriate government in accordance with
law.”
77.

In Union of India Vs. Shri Amar Singh & Anr.,

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 55 of 75

66 (1997) DLT 130, the learned single Judge of this court was
called upon to consider the jurisdiction of the court while
considering an application of the workman filed under Section 33C (2) of the I.D. Act. The workmen had claimed difference of
wages from the date they acquired temporary status till they were
appointed on regular pay scale. The court held that the claims of
the workmen, who were daily rated/casual workers, to be paid
wages at the same rate as the regular workers, had not been earlier
settled by adjudication or recognised by the employers and such
claims were disputed by the management. In these circumstances,
it was held that there could be no computation of the benefit under
Section 33-C (2) of the statute. This petition was held to be not
maintainable.
78.

The apex court was called upon to consider a similar

question in (1995) 1 SCC 235, MCD Vs. Ganesh Razak &
Anr. wherein it was held that the power of the Labour Court
under Section 33-C (2) extends to interpretation of the award or
settlement on which the workman's right rests, as the Executing
Court's power to interpret the decree for the purpose of execution,
where the basis of the claim is referable to the award or

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 56 of 75

settlement, but it does not extend to determination of the dispute
of entitlement or the basis of the claim if there be no prior
adjudication or recognition of the same by the employer. Where
the basis of the claim or the entitlement of the workman to
ascertain the benefit is disputed, there being no earlier
adjudication or recognition thereof by the employer, the dispute
which relates to entitlement was held to be not incidental to the
benefit claimed. In these circumstances, the apex court held that
such a dispute was clearly outside the scope of proceedings under
Section 33-C (2) of the Act, which provision would be applicable
only where the entitlement has been earlier adjudicated or
recognized by the employer.
It is noteworthy that this case also related to the claims
of the workmen, who were daily rated/casual workers seeking
same wages as a regular workman.
79.

On behalf of the respondent no. 4, reliance has also been

placed on AIR 1965 SC 1488, Kays Construction Co. Pvt.
Ltd. Vs. State of U.P. & Ors. The court was called upon to
consider provisions of Section 6 (H) (1) and (2) of the U.P.
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 which are in pari materia to Section

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 57 of 75

33 (C) (1) and (2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The court
pointed out the contrast between 'money due' on the one hand and
a benefit which is not 'money due'.

In both the statutes, the

cognate section is divided into two parts. The first part deals with
recovery of 'money due' to a workman under an award and the
second deals with a 'benefit' computable in terms of money. A
'benefit' can become 'money due' after the money equivalent is
determined on the other marks out the areas of operation of the
two sub-sections. It was held by the Apex Court that:“7. .......If the word 'benefit' were taken to cover a
case of mere arithmetical calculation of wages, the
first sub-section would hardly have any play.
Every case of calculation, however, simple, would
have to go first before a Tribunal. In our
judgment, a case such as the present, where the
money due is back wages for the period of
unemployment is covered by the first sub-section
and not the second. No doubt some calculation
enters the determination of the amount for which
the certificate will eventually issue but this
calculation is not of the type mentioned in the
second sub-section and cannot be made to fit in
the elaborate phrase 'benefit which is capable of
being computed in terms of money'. The contrast
in the two sub-sections between 'money due'
under the first sub-section and the necessity of
reckoning the benefit in terms of money before
the benefit becomes 'money due' under the
second sub-section shows that mere arithmetical
calculations of the amount due are not required to
be dealt with under the elaborate procedure of the
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 58 of 75

second sub-section. The appellant no doubt
conjured up a number of obstructions in the way
of this simple calculation. These objections dealt
with the 'amount due' and they are being
investigated because State Government must first
satisfy itself that the amount claimed is in fact
due. But the antithesis between 'money due' and
a 'benefit which must be computed in terms of
money' still remains, for the inquiry being made is
not of the kind contemplated by the second subsection but is one for the satisfaction of the State
Government under the first sub-section. It is
verification of the claim to money within the first
sub-section and not determination in terms of
money of the value of a benefit.”
The claim of respondent no. 4 is not 'money due' nor is it
a 'benefit' which involves merely arithmetical calculations. The
same would entail fixation of the date of confirmation, her wages,
determination and quantification of the dues of the respondent no.
4, all of which are disputed by the petitioner.
80.

In AIR 1959 Punjab 400, Malout Transport Co.

Vs. State of Punjab, it was stated that a certificate could only be
issued in a case where the money due had already been
ascertained and the Labour Commissioner could not, on his own,
proceed to ascertain the amount and issue the recovery certificate.
On the question under consideration, the following
passage from AIR 1960 MP 319, Bengal Nagpur Cotton

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 59 of 75

Mills Ltd. Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh is of irrefutable
topicality:“6. In our opinion, the contention advanced by
the learned counsel for the petitioner must be
given effect to. The argument of the learned
Advocate-General does not seem to us, to be in
accord with the language of Ss. 25FFF and 33C.
Section 33 C (1) speaks of recovery of any money
due to a workman from an employer under a
settlement or an award or under the provisions of
Ch. VA. Now, an amount 'due' means an amount
which has been ascertained and has become
payable. Section 33 C (1), therefore, deals with the
recovery of an amount which has already been
ascertained and not with the ascertainment of any
amount payable to the employee. The amount
due to a workman from an employer under a
settlement or an award may be an ascertained
amount.
But the same cannot be said of an
amount due to him under the provisions of Ch.
VA. This has to be determined in accordance with
the relevant provisions of Ch. VA before the
recovery of it can be ordered under S. 33 C (1).
Section 33 C (1) no doubt says that the
appropriate Government if satisfied that any
money is due, shall issue a certificate for the
recovery of that amount. But this satisfaction of
the appropriate Government is not for the
purpose of the ascertainment of the amount. It is
with regard to the question whether any
ascertained amount payable to the worker has or
has not been paid to him, or whether any balance
is still due to him. That the question of recovery
of any amount cannot arise unless it is first
ascertained is a proposition obvious enough.
That the amount of compensation
payable to workmen in case of closing down of an
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 60 of 75

undertaking is not always a mere matter of
calculation from the muster-rolls maintained by
the undertaking becomes plain from the
provisions of S. 25FFF.
The amount of
compensation payable under the said provision
has to be ascertained with reference to the
continuity of service of the workman during the
prescribed period and in accordance with the
provisions of S. 25 F and also with reference to
the question whether the undertaking was closed
down on account of unavoidable circumstances
beyond the control of the employer. Where the
undertaking is closed on account of unavoidable
circumstances beyond the control of the
employer, the compensation to be paid to
workmen cannot exceed his average pay for three
months.
Again, under the Explanation to S.
25FFF, an undertaking which is closed down by
reason merely of financial difficulties (including
financial losses) or accumulation of undisposed of
stock is not taken to have closed down on account
of unavoidable circumstances beyond the control
of the employer within the meaning of the proviso
to sub-sec. (1) of S. 25 FFF.
Without an
adjudication
on
all
these
points,
the
compensation payable to workmen under S. 25
FFF cannot be determined, and unless it is
determined there cannot be any recovery of that
amount under S. 33 C. Here, admittedly, there
was no ascertainment of the amount of
compensation payable to workmen under S. 25
FFF. Consequently, the Labour Commissioner
had no jurisdiction to issue certificates for the
recovery of the amount of compensation
calculated by himself on the basis of the registers
maintained by the petitioner-mills.”
81.

In 1995 LLR 924, Government of National

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 61 of 75

Capital Territory Through Medical Superintendent
Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Shahdara, Delhi Vs. Smt.
Kamlesh & Anr., vide an ex-parte award dated 21st July, 1994,
the Labour Court held that the termination of the services of the
respondent/workman was illegal and directed reinstatement with
continuity of service. The Labour Court further directed payment
of full back wages as per the regular pay scale along with DA and
additional DA to be paid to the workman.

In this case, the

management assailed the ex-parte award on the ground that the
award directing payment of regular wages was wholly beyond the
terms of reference inasmuch as the appropriate government had
only referred the issue relating to the claim of wrongful
termination of service. The Division Bench of this court upheld
the finding relating to the termination of service being illegal and
also approved the finding of the Labour Court to the effect that the
termination being illegal and wrongful, and the workman not
being gainfully employed elsewhere during the period was entitled
to back wages. However, it accepted the challenge to the award of
regular pay scale to the workman holding thus:“9.
However, the third contention has to be
upheld. Having adjudged the termination to be
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 62 of 75

illegal, the Labour Court could have directed the
status quo ante to be restored but could not also
have allowed relief which was beyond the scope of
the terms of reference made to it. The question
referred to the Labour Court was : Whether the
termination of the services of Smt. Kamlesh is
illegal and unjustified and if so what relief is she
entitled and what directions are necessary in this
respect? It is apparent that while answering the
question and making the Award, the Labour
Court could not have further entered into and
decided the question whether the employee was
entitled to regular pay-scale along with DA and
additional DA.
10.
For the foregoing reasons, the petition
is allowed in part. The directions contained in the
operative part of the award whereby the
employee/respondent no. 1 has been allowed
reinstatement with continuity of service and full
back wages is maintained. Rest of the award
allowing as par the regular pay scale along with
DA and additional DA to the respondent no. 1 is
set aside.
The result is that the
employee/respondent no. 1 shall be entitled to be
reinstated back in service with full back wages
calculated at the same rate at which she was being
paid on the date of impugned termination subject
to revision of rates under the minimum wages act
as may be applicable to her.
11.
We may make it clear that we have
expressed no opinion on merits of the question
whether the respondent no. 1 is entitled to regular
pay scale or not. She may raise that question
before an appropriate forum if she may be
inclined to do so.”
82.

It is noteworthy that the facts of this case are similar to

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 63 of 75

the case laid before the industrial adjudicator. The management
has challenged the very entitlement of the workman to her claim
that she was a confirmed employee and was entitled to payment of
wages on this ground. There is neither adjudication on this issue
nor any finding or direction made by the labour court in this
behalf. Therefore, in the light of the principles laid down by the
Apex Court in (1995) 1 SCC 235 entitled MCD Vs. Ganesh
Razak & Anr. and by the Division Bench of this court in M/s
Weston Electroniks Ltd. Vs. Union of India reported at
1997 (1) AD (DELHI) 538 as well as in 1995 LLR 924 entitled
Government of NCT of Delhi Vs. Kamlesh & Ors., the
petition under Section 33-C (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
seeking a claim which was neither adjudicated nor admitted by the
management was not maintainable. Furthermore, by the order
dated 13th September, 1995, the appropriate government had
already held so.
83.

It has been urged that the Division Bench of this court in

M/s Weston Electroniks Ltd. Vs. Union of India (supra)
has clearly held that the appropriate government is required to
afford a reasonable opportunity to the management and the

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 64 of 75

workman and comply with the principles of natural justice before
taking a decision under Section 33-C (1) and is also required to
make a speaking order giving reasons so that the aggrieved party –
management or workman may seek judicial review of the decision
of the appropriate government in accordance with law.
84.

It has been pointed out that in the award dated 31st

January, 1990, no figures were mentioned. The workman filed an
application dated 16th May, 1996 under Section 36-A of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 which has been noticed hereinabove.
Vide a letter dated 10th January, 1997, the respondent no. 4 had
withdrawn this application and by one single line in the same
letter, requested that the award be got implemented and
difference of wages be paid to the respondent no. 4 at the earliest.
Neither the application dated 16th May, 1996 (under Section 36-A
of the statute) nor the letter dated 10th January, 1997 contained
any computation or the amount which the respondent no. 4 was
claiming. In its reply dated 5th March, 1997 and 15th July, 1997,
the petitioner had vehemently objected, not only to the
maintainability, but even had made objections to the amounts
which were being claimed by the respondent no. 4.

The respondent no. 4 has placed reliance on a notice

dated 24th July, 1997 addressed by the Assistant Labour
Commissioner to the District Collectorate (Collector), Tis Hazari,
Delhi which reads as follows:“As per Labour Court Award dated 31.1.1990 in
I.D. No. 46/83, a sum of Rs. 2,48,376.60 (Rupees
Two Lakh Forty Eight Thousand, Three Hundred
Seventy Six and Sixty Paide) for the period from
1.5.82 to 30.11.96 is payable to the workman
concerned Smt. Pravin Bahl by M/s Greaves
Cotton & Co. Ltd., Thapar House, 124, Janpath,
New Delhi.
The aforesaid amount is to be recoverable under
Section 33-C (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 and there is no separate account as such this
amount shall be payable to Smt. Pravin Bahl.”
86.

It is pointed out that pursuant to this communication,

the Tehsildar has issued the notice dated 24th July, 1997 to the
petitioner requiring it to deposit a sum of Rs. 2,48,376.60/- to the
account of the respondent no. 4 by the 19th of August, 1997.
Undoubtedly, no speaking order in terms of the directions of the
Division Bench in Weston Electroniks Ltd. (supra) has been
passed.
There is no basis as to how the figure was arrived at by
the Labour Commissioner nor any justification for the demand by
the Collector for the recovery of this amount. The Government has
W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 66 of 75

been arrayed as a party respondent before this court but has also
opted not to appear in the

present proceedings.

No counter

affidavit has been filed. The petitioner has placed before this court
the recovery certificate while the respondent no. 4 is placing
reliance on the communication dated 24th July, 1997 whereby the
Government wrote to the District Collector to effect the recovery of
the amount.
87.

Form K-I to the Industrial Disputes (Central) Rules,

1957 provides the format in which an application under subSection 2 of Section 33 of the statute is required to be made. The
details of the amounts to be claimed have to be set out in the
annexure. The respondent No.4 has submitted that as per Rule
62(1) of the Industrial Disputes (Central) Rules, 1957, the
workman is only required to submit an application which may be
in the form of a letter and details of the money to which he is
entitled and that such formality has been completed by the
workman.
88.

The request of the workman has been noticed herein

above. It has been contended on behalf of respondent No.4 that
she had enclosed details of the amounts which she was entitled to,

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 67 of 75

alongwith its letter dated 16 November, 1995 and further that the
legal notice dated 23rd May, 1997 had also been served on the
petitioner alongwith calculations. It has also been contended that
the respondent has also placed calculations of the amounts due to
her before this Court. Therefore, according to the respondent no.
4, the petitioner cannot object to the order passed by the Labour
Commissioner.
89.

The order dated 24th July, 2005 placed before this

Court has erroneously recorded that the Labour Court award
dated 31st January, 1990 had held that the workman was to be
paid a sum of Rs.2,48,376.60 for the period 1st of May, 1982 to
30th November, 1996. It is noteworthy that the respondent No.4
had sought reference of the issue to the Labour Court in its letter
dated 16th May, 1996. The petitioner has also urged that there
was no application under Section 33(C) (1) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947.

The only application before the labour

authorities was the application afore-noticed dated 10th January,
1997 by the petitioner which contains no prayer relating to
confirmation and which gave no details of the dues, their basis or
the period.

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 68 of 75

90.

Respondent No.4 had filed an application bearing CM

No.67/93 dated 16th December, 1993 in CWP 78/91 asserting that
she was entitled to resume duty as a confirmed employee. This
Court in the order dated 25th July, 1995 had not given the relief in
this behalf to the workman. The Assistant Labour Officer vide its
order dated 14th September, 1995 had directed the respondent
No.4 to approach the Labour Court to get the amount computed.
Undoubtedly, there was no material whatsoever before the
authorities when the order dated 24th July, 1997 has been issued
directing recovery of the amount.

In these circumstances, I find

that the petitioner has been denied an opportunity to contest the
claim made.
91.

It is now necessary to examine the third question

noticed above which relates to the jurisdiction of the labour
authorities to review an order once passed. Mr. D.R. Thadani,
learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 confers no power on the labour
authorities to review the orders passed by them.
92.

Undoubtedly the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 does not

confer any such power on the authorities.

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 69 of 75

Power to review is

derived from specific statutory power in this behalf. In 1971 (3)
SCC 844, Patel Narshi Thakershi & Ors Vs. Shri
Pradyumansinghji Arjunsinghji, the Court held that the
Court was required to consider a question as to whether an official
Shri Monkodi had the legal competence to quash the order made
by the Saurashtra Government on 22nd October, 1956.

It was

noticed that Shri Mankodi was functioning as a delegate of the
State Government and that the order passed by him in law
amounted to a review of the order made by the
Government.

Saurashtra

In this behalf, the Court held that the power to

review was not an inherent power and that it must be conferred by
law either specifically or by necessary implication.
93.

No provision in the statute in question was placed before

the Court from which the Court could gather that the Government
had the power to review its own order. In these circumstances, it
was held that the if the Government has no power to review its
own order, it was obvious
reviewed its order.

that its delegatee could not have

The question as to whether the Government's

order was correct or valid in law did not arise for consideration in
the proceedings before the Apex Court so long as that order was

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 70 of 75

not set aside or declared void by a competent authority and hence
the same could not be ignored.
94.

By the order dated 13th September, 1995 on the earlier

application filed by the workman for implementation of the award,
the authority had directed the workman to get the amount
computed from the appropriate Labour Court. The respondent
No.4 thereafter had sought nothing new. She has not assailed the
order dated 30th September, 1995. On the contrary, she has filed
the application dated 16th May, 1996 under Section 36 A of the
Industrial Disputes Act and had withdrawn the same by a
communication dated 10th January, 1990 and sought payment of
the same dues under Section 33(C) in respect of which an order
dated 13th September, 1995 was passed by the authorities.
Therefore, the impact of the order which was issued by the Labour
Commissioner on 24th July, 1997 was in fact to review the earlier
order.
95.

So far as the power to review is concerned, it is well

settled that the same has to be explicitly provided by the statute
either specifically or by necessary implications.
The order issued on 21st July, 1997 therefore is clearly

W.P. (C) No. 3410/1997

Page 71 of 75

without jurisdiction and contrary to law.

The same is not

sustainable for this reason as well.
For all the foregoing reasons, the writ petition deserves
to be allowed. The order of the respondent no. 2 computing the
amount demanded from the petitioner and the notice dated 11th of
August, 1997 are hereby set aside and quashed.
There shall be no order as to costs.
