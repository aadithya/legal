1.
Notice was issued in the writ petition. However, despite
service, none had appeared on behalf of the respondent.

An

opportunity was given in the interest of justice for filing counter
affidavit which was not filed. In these circumstances, the record of
the industrial adjudicator was called for and has been made
available to me.
2.

I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused

the available record.

WP (C) No.18490/2004

By this writ petition, the petitioner has

Page 1 of 17

assailed an award dated 28th June, 2002 whereby the Industrial
Tribunal answered the reference in favour of the workman holding
that the workman has worked for more than 240 days and that the
gap in his working was artificial. In these circumstances, it was
held by the industrial adjudicator that termination of the services
of the workman amounted to retrenchment within the meaning of
the expression given in Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947.

It was further held that as the same was without

compliance with the provisions of Section 25-F of the statute, it
was illegal. On such findings, the Industrial Tribunal directed the
petitioner to reinstate the workman with all consequential benefits
and full back wages which was required to be paid within one
month of the date of publication of the award failing which the
management was liable to pay interest at the rate of 9% per
annum.
3.

From the record, it appears that the respondent/workman

had raised an industrial claim that he was employed by the
erstwhile Delhi Water Supply & Sewage Disposal Undertaking of
the M.C.D. w.e.f. 25th January, 1979 in the post of Sewar Gang
Beldar. The workman claimed that he was being treated as the
daily rated/casual/muster roll workman and was being paid wages
WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 2 of 17

less than those fixed and revised under the Minimum Wages Act
for unskilled casual workers despite his counterparts who were
regular employees doing identical work and work of same value.
The workman was paid a fixed allowance whereas these regularly
placed employees performing the same work were being paid
Rs.196-232. It was contended that this pay scale was revised to
the pay scale of Rs.750-940 with usual allowances under the rules
w.e.f. 1st January, 1986 complaining that his services were illegally
terminated w.e.f. 13th February, 1984 to the labour authorities. It
was also claimed that the cause of termination of his service was
that the workman was arrested by the police on 17 th February,
1984 in a criminal case by the police of Haryana and was sent to
custody. The respondent/workman claimed that he was acquitted
upon trial on 28th February, 1985 by the criminal court and that he
had sent intimation with regard to his arrest, detention and
acquittal to the petitioner. The workman stated that he reported
after acquittal on 28th January, 1985 when he was required to
submit copy of the judgment but despite the same, he has not
been given any job.
4.

The workman claimed that he acquired the status of a

permanent employee w.e.f. 21st January, 1979 after completing
WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 3 of 17

240 days of continuous employment as required by Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 and consequently, his services could not have
been terminated without compliance of the provisions of Section
25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

The workman also

alleged violation of Sections 25-G, H & N of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 and that he remains unemployed since 13th
February, 1984 except for the period from April, 1988 to July,
1992 when he was allowed to work as a muster roll worker. On
these pleas, the workman claimed that he would be entitled to be
regularised on the post of Sewer Gang Beldar on the date of his
joining into service on 25th January, 1989 in the proper pay scale
and allowances without consequential benefits thereof. 5.
The complaint raised by the workman was referred for
adjudication by the Government of N.C.T. of Delhi vide a
notification dated 29th April, 1994 on the following terms:“1. Whether the services of Shri Dharambir
have been terminated legally and/or justifiably
and if not, to what relief is he entitled and what
directions are necessary in this respect?
2.
Whether
non-employment
of
Shri
Dharambir for the period 17.2.84 to 18.1.85 is
legal and/or justified and if not, to what relief is
he entitled and what directions are necessary in
this respect?
WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 4 of 17

3.
Whether non-regularisation of Shri
Dharambir on the post of Sewer Gang Beldar is
legal and/or justified and if not, to what relief is
he entitled and that directions are necessary in
this respect?”
6.

The workman had raised a claim which was similar to his

complaint. The petitioner-employer set up a case that it had no
intimation about the arrest of the workman or about his acquittal.
It was also stated that the petitioner had offered regularisation to
the respondent/workman on the post of drains Sweeper/Bhisti
and to undergo medical examination which he failed to undergo.
It was on account of his absenteeism that the workman was
treated to have abandoned his job.
7.

The Industrial Tribunal recorded evidence in the matter.

The workman submitted his affidavit by way of evidence wherein
he supported the claim made by him. In order to prove that he
had worked for more than 240 days, the workman proved muster
roll records before the Industrial Tribunal. The petitioner has
placed before this court a tabulation of the various dates on which
the workman claimed employment as per the muster roll records
produced before the industrial adjudicator.

It would appear

therefrom that the workman worked for 146 days in the year 1989,

WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 5 of 17

37 days in 1990, 67 days in the year 1991 and had worked for 75
days in the year 1992.

It would, therefore, appear that the

workman had not rendered 240 days of continuous service in any
year.
8.

The workman had stated that his services were terminated

on 1st August, 1992. Therefore, it would appear from the evidence
produced before the Industrial Tribunal that the workman had not
worked for 240 days in a single year from 1989 till 1992. Perusal
of the award would show that this issue has not been considered in
its correct perspective by the Industrial Tribunal. The Industrial
Tribunal was of the view that in as much as the petitioner
management had admitted the number of days on which the
workman had worked, therefore, for the period from 1989 to 1992,
the workman had worked for more than 240 days and that the
same was separated by artificial gaps. For this reason, without
examining the issue as to whether the workman had worked for
240 days in the year preceding his termination, the Industrial
Tribunal was of the view that since the petitioner had failed to
prove that the respondent/workman had been engaged for a
particular

year,

therefore

his

termination

amounted

to

retrenchment within its definition as given in Section 2 (oo) of the
WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 6 of 17

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and that as the management had not
proved that it had complied with the provisions of Section 25-F of
the enactment, such termination was illegal.
9.

It would be useful in this behalf to notice the requirement of

law. Section 25-B & Section 25F which govern adjudication in the
present case read thus:“25B. Definition of continuous service(1)

a workman shall be said to be in continuous
service for a period if he is, for that period,
in uninterrupted service, including service
which may be interrupted on account of
sickness or authorised leave or an accident
or as strike which is not illegal, or a lockout
or a cessation of work which is not due to
any fault on the part of the workman;

(2)

where a workman is not in continuous
service within the meaning of clause (1) for
a period of one year or six months, eh shall
be deemed to be in continuous service
under an employer-

(a)

for a period of one year, if the workman,
during a period of twelve calender months
preceding the date with reference to which
calculation is to be made, has actually
worked under the employer for not less
than,
(i)

(ii)
WP (C) No.18490/2004

one hundred and ninety days in
the case of a workman employed
below ground in a mine,
two hundred and forty days, in
Page 7 of 17

any other case;
(b) for a period of six months, if the workman,
during a period of six calender months
preceding the date with reference to which
calculation is to be made, has actually
worked under the employer for not less
than(i)
(ii)

ninety-five days, in the case of
workman
employed below
ground in a mine; and
one hundred and twenty days,
in any other case.

25F Conditions precedent to retrenchment of
workmen - No workman employed in any industry
who has been in continuous service for not
less than one year under an employer shall be
retrenched by that employer until(a) the workman has been given one month's
notice in writing indicating the reasons
for retrenchment and the period of notice
has expired, or the workman has been
paid in lieu of such notice, wages for the
period of the notice;
(b) The workman has been paid, at the time
of retrenchment, compensation which
shall be equivalent to fifteen days' average
pay (for every completed year of
continuous service) or any part thereof in
excess of six months; and
(c) notice in the prescribed manner is served
on the appropriate Government (for such
authority as may be specified by the
appropriate Government by notification
in the Official Gazette).”

WP (C) No.18490/2004

It would, therefore, be necessary that the workman has been

in continuous service for not less than one year as has been
mandated by the legislature in Section 25-F and Section 25-B (1)
of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 to be entitled to the benefits
thereof. The issue as to whether the period of one year is to mean
the calender year beginning from January and ending in
December or can mean a period of twelve months in all has fallen
for consideration in several cases and the principles governing its
determination are well settled. In the pronouncement of the Apex
Court reported at (1981) 3 SCC 225 entitled Mohan Lal Vs.
Management of Bharat Electronics Limited, it was held by
the Supreme Court that before a workman can complain of
retrenchment being not in consonance with Section 25-F, he has
to show that he has been in continuous service for not less than
one year with the employer who has retrenched him from service.
It was also noticed that Section 25-B is the dictionary clause of the
expression “continuous service” . It was held that a workman
would be deemed to have been in continuous service for a period
of one year by a legal fiction despite the fact that he has not
rendered uninterrupted service for a period of one year but he had
rendered service for a period of 240 days during a period of twelve
WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 9 of 17

months commencing and counting backward from the relevant
date which is the date of retrenchment. Therefore, in order to
invoke the fiction enacted in Clause 2(a), it was held that it was
necessary to determine first the relevant date, i.e. the date of
termination of service which is complained of as retrenchment.
After the date is ascertained, it is necessary to move backwards to
a period of twelve months just preceding the date of retrenchment
and then to ascertain whether, within the period of twelve months,
the workman has rendered service for a period of 240 days. If
these three facts are affirmatively answered in favour of the
workman pursuant to the deeming fiction enacted in Clause 2(a),
it will have to be assumed that the workman is in continuous
service for a period of one year and he will satisfy the eligibility
qualification enacted in Section 25F.
11.

It may be noted that the Apex Court had placed reliance on

the earlier pronouncement of the court which was reported at
1981 SCC (L & S) 16 entitled Surender Kumar Verma &
Ors. Vs. Central Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court,
New Delhi & Another.
12.

This issue had also arisen for consideration before a Division

Bench of this court which has considered the entire case law on
WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 10 of 17

the subject by its authoritative pronouncement reported at 124
( 2005) DLT 248 (DB) entitled Suraj Pal Singh Vs. The
Presiding Officer & Anr., has laid down the principles thus:-

“27. Section 25B(1)of the Act being
beneficial and welfare provision has to be
liberally and broadly interpreted, yet at the
same time we cannot amend and modify a
statutory provision by incorporating and
adding words. Our role is to interpret the
law as its exists and not to add and subtract
words already used by the Legislature or
usurp the role of the Legislature. The
Legislature in Section 25(b)(2) has referred
to period of `240 days in the preceding year'
following the date of termination as the
criteria to determine and decide whether a
workman has been in continuous service for
a period of one year. The Legislature,
however, has deliberately not mentioned
the period of 240 days in a period of one
year as the criteria in Section 25B(1), of the
Act, Section 25B(1) now here specifies that
if a workman has worked for a period of 240
days in a period of 'one year', he is deemed
to be in uninterrupted service for 'one year'.
The period of 240 days specified in Section
25B(1) of the Act. Our judicial pen cannot
write these words into the aforesaid subsection and read them in Section 25B(1),
when the Legislature has consciously and
deliberately not used these words. The
requirement of Legislature, as far as Section
25B(1) of the Act is concerned, is clear and
unambiguous. It refers to 'continuous' or
WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 11 of 17

'uninterrupted' service for a period of one
year i.e., 12 consecutive months. We cannot
by judicial interpretation decrease this
period of 365 days to 240 days. Of course
the period of one year should be interpreted
liberally as has been done in the present
judgment. The two judgments, in the case
of Moti Ceramic Industries (supra) and
Metal Powder Co. Ltd. (supra) support and
have similarly interpreted Section 25B(1)
and (2) of the Act. Bombay High Court in
the case of New Great Eastern Spinning and
Weaving Co. Ltd. v. Vasant Mahade Bidia,
reported in 2005(1) CLR 50 has also taken a
similar view.
28. We wish to further clarify that the
above interpretation is not against
workmen. The Legislature has been careful
and cautious to include certain periods like
authorised leave, legal strikes, lockouts,
periods during which the employer illegally
refused to permit the workman to do work,
etc., as a period during which the workman
is deemed to be in continuous or
uninterrupted service. Therefore in a given
case, a workman may have worked for in
fact less than 240 days, but after including
the specified periods mentioned in Section
25B(1), his continuous or uninterrupted
service might be for a period of 12
consecutive months. Accordingly, we hold
that period of 240 days is not relevant as far
as Section 25B(1) is concerned as the figure
`240 days' is not mentioned in the said subsection and is mentioned only in Subsection (2). It is not possible for this Court
to legislate and add the words 240 days in
Section 25B(1) of the Act.
29.

Sub-section (2) of Section 25B also

WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 12 of 17

incorporates a deeming fiction. As per Subsection (2) to Section 25B, if a workman has
worked for 240 days or 190 days (in case he
is employed below ground in a mine) during
the period of 12 calender months preceding
the date with reference to which calculation
is to be made, he shall be needed to be in
continuous service for a period of one year.
In case of a retrenchment, the reference
date will be the date on which the
retrenchment order is passed. Therefore, in
a workman has worked for 240 days (190
days in case he has worked below ground in
a mine) during the period of 12 calender
months preceding the date of his
retrenchment, the said period of 12 calender
months preceding the date of his
retrenchment, the said workman is deemed
to have rendered continuous service for a
period of one year. Section 25B(2) refers to
a period of 12 months immediately
preceding and counting backwards from the
relevant date and not to any other period of
employment. If a workman has worked for
more than 240 days during this period of 12
months prior to his retrenchment, he is
deemed to be in continuous service for a
year. The words `preceding the date with
reference to which calculation is to be made'
are not redundant or otiose. The period of
12 months mentioned in Section 25B(2) is
not therefore an period of 12 months but the
immediately preceding 12 months with
reference to which calculation is to be made.
30. Section 25B(2) as per the clause itself,
comes into operation when a workman has
not been in continuous service within the
meaning of Sub-section (1) for a period of
one year. However, in practice and for all
practical purposes, a workman will be
WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 13 of 17

entitled to protection under Section 25F of
the Act, if conditions mentioned in either of
the two clauses are satisfied. The Subsections are therefore in alternative.
Requirement
of
Section
25B(1)
is
uninterrupted service for a period of one
year and under Sub-section (2) requirement
is service for a period of 240 days (or 190
days in case worker is employed below
ground in a mine) during the preceding 12
calender months prior to the date of
termination/retrenchment. By the deeming
fiction in Section 25B(2), a workman who
has worked for aforesaid period in the
preceding 12 calender months prior to the
date of termination/retrenchment is
deemed to have been in continuous service
for not less than one year.
The two
provisions, namely, of Section 25B(1) and
25B(2) are separate and distinct. The
requirements and conditions to be satisfied
to some extent are also different.”
13.

In view of these well settled principles, the workman could

have complained that he has been illegally retrenched from service
only if he had worked for a period of 240 days in twelve months
preceding the termination of his service.
14.

The same principle was laid down in 2005 (3) SCC 409

entitled Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation
and Another Vs. S.G. Kotturappa & Another wherein the
court also held thus:-

WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 14 of 17

“It is not a case where the respondent has
completed 240 days of service during the
period of 12 months preceding such
termination as contemplated under Section 25F read with Section 25-B of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947. The Badli workers, thus,
did not acquire any legal right to continue in
service. They were not even entitled to the
protection under the Industrial Disputes Act
nor were the mandatory requirements of
Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act
required to be complied with before
terminating his service, unless they complete
240 days' service within a period of twelve
months preceding the date of termination.”
15.

Undoubtedly, the onus and burden of proof of the fact that

he had worked for a period of 240 days lies on the workman. The
Apex Court in the judgment reported at (2002) 3 SCC 25
entitled Range Forest Officer v. S.T. Hadimani has stated
the applicable principles as follows:“3. .....In our opinion the Tribunal
was not right in placing the onus on the
management without first determining on
the basis of cogent evidence that the
respondent had worked for more than 240
days in the year preceding his termination.
It was the case of the claimant that he had
so worked but this claim was denied by the
appellant. It was then for the claimant to
lead evidence to show that he had in fact
worked for 240 days in the year preceding
his termination. Filing of an affidavit is
only his own statement in his favour and
that cannot be regarded as sufficient
evidence for any court or tribunal to come
WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 15 of 17

to the conclusion that a workman had, in
fact, worked for 240 days in a year. No
proof of receipt of salary or wages for 240
days or order or record of appointment or
engagement for this period was produced
by the workman. On this ground alone,
the award is liable to be set aside.”
16.

In the instant case, a careful perusal of the record of the

industrial adjudicator shows that the workman was able to
establish only the fact that he had worked for 146 days in 1989, 37
days in 1990, 67 days in 1991 & 75 days upto 31st December, 1992.
The workman had claimed that his services were terminated on 1st
August, 1992. Therefore, the twelve months period which would
commence from the date of his termination and required to be
read backwards therefrom, would have commenced on 1st August,
1991 till 31st July, 1992. From the records placed before this court,
the workman had not worked at all from 1st July, 1991 till 30th
April, 1992. He has worked for 24 days in May, 1992, 26 days in
June, 1992 and only 25 days in July, 1992.
17.

In this view of the matter, looked at from any angle, the

findings of the Industrial Tribunal that the workman had worked
for a period of 240 days, is not supported by any evidence on
record.

In any case, the Industrial Tribunal has arrived at a

conclusion that the workman had worked for more than 240 days
WP (C) No.18490/2004

Page 16 of 17

by considering the entire period from 1989 to 1992. In the light of
the principles of law laid down by the Apex Court and by Division
Bench of this court as well as the clear stipulation in the statute,
such a view taken by the Industrial Tribunal is not legally
sustainable.
18.

The workman had not worked for 240 days as required by

law and was not in continuous service in a year preceding his
termination to entitle him to complain against his termination
being illegal on the ground of non-compliance with the provisions
of Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
19.

For this reason, the claim raised by the workman could not

have been sustained or granted and as such, the reference
required to be answered against the workman.
20.

In view of the afore-noticed discussion, the award dated 28th

June, 2002 is not sustainable and the same is hereby set aside and
quashed.
The writ petition is allowed in the above terms.
There shall be no orders as to costs.
