It is averred in the suit that on 1.06.2000 a Franchisee Agreement was entered between the

Plaintiff and the Defendant for running an exclusive ladies' luxury hair dressing salon at New Delhi
under the brand name of “Jacques Dessange”, the defendant’s trade name. The agreement was for
an initial period of four years; ending on 31.12.2004, but subject to further renewal. There was no
Jacque Dessange Salon in India prior to the venture. It is alleged that the plaintiff set up a ladies'
luxury hair dressing salon at 50-51, Community Centre, New Friends Colony, New Delhi-110065.
Later, on 1-7-2002, another, similar Franchisee Agreement was entered between the parties, for
establishment and running of a ladies' luxury hair dressing salon at Mumbai. That agreement
provided for the end date to be 31.12.2006. According to its averments, the Plaintiff set up a ladies'
luxury hair dressing salon at Taj Mahal Hotel, Apollo Bunder, Mumbai.

3.

The plaint avers that in May, 2003, the Plaintiff expressed the desire to the Defendant for the

possibilities of opening Jacque Dessange Salons in the other cities of India and, requested the
Defendant for rights for sub-franchise. The plaintiff further alleges that the Defendant at once
accepted the said proposal and informed it of having a Master Franchisee Contract for the said
purpose, which was also to include the existing Jacque Dessange Salons managed by the Plaintiff.
The Defendant in fact forwarded a draft of the Master Franchisee Contract to the Plaintiff under
their mail dated 28.5.2003. The Plaintiff sought for confirmation with respect to the said salons
from the Defendant under their letter dated 24.06.2003. The plaintiff alleges that the Defendant, by
letter of 3.07.2003, confirmed and approved about signing a Master Franchisee Contract opening of
the said additional salons as suggested by the Plaintiff, with it. The plaintiff avers to discussion in

CS (OS) 1114/2004

2 of 17

this regard between parties, where the Defendant again reaffirmed its intention of including the
existing Jacque Dessange salons at Delhi and Mumbai as the flagships and future salons as subfranchisee under the Master Franchisee Contract. It is alleged that the Defendant had unequivocally,
by letter of 19.11.2003, showed appreciation on the development of Jacque Dessange in India.
4.

The plaint averments advert to defendants’ letter of 13.02.2004, evincing the intention of

binding itself by a Master Franchisee Contract. This intention was further reaffirmed by the
Defendant in the letters of 30.3.2004 and 8.4.2004. The Defendant also approved the opening of the
new Jacque Dessange Salons by the Plaintiff at Delhi and Mumbai. The Plaintiff, allegedly hired
one Ms. Martin Fuzeau, a trainer from Jacques Dessange, Paris from February 15, 2004 for the
purpose of training the staff, which the Plaintiff had hired for the said additional Jacque Dessange
Salon which was to open in Mumbai. The plaintiff, however in the interest of Jacque Dessange
brand, decided to close its earlier Jacque Dessange salon which was being operated from Taj Mahal
Hotel. This was informed to the defendant through letters dated 19.5.2004 and 2.6.2004. The
Defendant, through its letter dated 14.06.2004, unequivocally accepted and endorsed the decision. It
is alleged that the Defendant by the said letter, even on being informed of the closure of the salon at
Taj Mahal Hotel, indicated that the contract with the Plaintiff was still valid.

5.

The plaintiff adverts to the Defendant in a series of correspondence, indicating continuation

and existence of the Franchisee Agreement entered with the Plaintiff for the Mumbai Salon. This
position continued, even after the Plaintiff through the letter dated 6.7.2004 confirmed that it had
ceased the operation of their salon at Taj Mahal Hotel from 30.06.2004. In these circumstances, the

CS (OS) 1114/2004

3 of 17

plaintiff, through mail dated 5.7.2004 informed the Defendant about the proposal of opening a new
Jacque Dessange Salon in the new Ravissant Store in Mumbai. The Defendant, on being informed
of the same, not only approved of the said decision, but in fact informed the Plaintiff that they
should use Jacque Dessange interiors for the said new Salon, and sent the necessary catalogue for
the said purpose. In these circumstances, the plaintiff alleges that it started the renovation work in
the store. It claims to have incurred cost of Rs. 75 lakhs towards such renovation work and Rs. 20
lakhs towards architect’s fees. The Plaintiff also claims that it has to pay a rental of over Rs. 4 lakhs
per month for the premises and that it had already cost over Rs. 18 lakhs on account of salaries of
staff, allowances, cost of hiring Ms. Martine Fuzeau, including her travel and accommodation,
towards training staff for the said Mumbai Salon. The Plaintiffs also avers to have entered into a
two year irrevocable contract with the said staff and engaged Mr. Josef Fluck, a well known
architect in Germany since July, 2004 for coordinating with Simon and Salvatore, Architects, to
finalize the layouts in the said new salon.
6.

On 19.7.2004, the defendant informed the Plaintiff of their decision to cancel the Franchisee

Agreement with respect to the Delhi Salon on its expiry date, i.e. 31.12.2004. It however, also
evinced the intention to continue the relationship with the Plaintiff in respect of the Delhi Salon on
modified terms and conditions, which were agreed to by the Plaintiff by the letter dated 10.8.2004.
The Plaintiff also informed the Defendant of starting a new Salon in Delhi from B-51, Greater
Kailash, New Delhi-110 048 and at Mumbai from New India Centre. The Defendant by its letter
dated 17.8.2004 confirmed to the Plaintiff about its intention to discuss the future of the Delhi Salon

CS (OS) 1114/2004

4 of 17

Franchisee Agreement, post 31.12.2004. After this, the plaintiff claims to have got in touch with
one AICE Recruitment at Paris, for recruiting hairdressers for the said new Salons at Delhi and
Mumbai. It is also claimed that Mr. Ravi Chawla, on behalf of the Plaintiff, visited Paris at the
defendant’s request to meet the latter’s representatives on 7/8.09.2004. It is alleged that during the
meeting the defendant re-affirmed that its relationship (with the Plaintiff) for the salon at Delhi
would continue beyond 31.12.2004, and also that opening of new Salons was again approved. It is
alleged that based on this understanding between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, the former
finalized the hiring of French Hair Stylists and Managers through the AICE Recruitment, the
nominated recruitment agency of the Defendant. For this purpose, Shri Chawla finalized the
plaintiff’s orders with M/s Maletti, Italy, the nominated manufacturers of Jacque Dessange
equipments and furniture, for supplies of equipments and furniture for the new Salons at Mumbai
and Delhi
7.

It is also averred that by the letter dated 8.9.2004, the defendant again showed its intention

of continuing the Delhi Salon in one manner or the other beyond 31.12.2004, by assuring the
Plaintiff of “eventual creation of master franchisee” to include the existing Salon at Delhi. The
latter offered certain financial conditions, in modification of the earlier terms under the Master
Franchisee Agreement and also sought for the acceptance by the Plaintiff of those terms and the
agreement. The Plaintiff, through the letter dated 13.09.2004 reconfirmed its acceptance of the
offer of 8.09.2004. This, it is alleged concluded the Master Franchisee Agreement between the
parties. The Plaintiff also informed the Defendant that the new Mumbai Salon was ready and could
be opened as soon as the new items could be received from Maletti.

8.

It is alleged that on 21.09.2004, the Defendant faxed a letter, dated 20.09.2004 to the

Plaintiff terminating the Franchisee Agreement, with respect to the Mumbai Salon retrospectively
effective from 31.07.2004 apart from casting cloud/doubts about the future of the otherwise
concluded Master Franchisee Agreement. The said letter came as a rude shock to the Plaintiff. It is
alleged that the Defendant, by that letter had also made several incorrect assumptions of the
Plaintiff's action, only to somehow justify their action taken under the said letter. It is claimed that
the plaintiff was also informed by Ms. Sandrine Opter, of AICE Recruitment Agency that in view
of instructions of the defendant, the three selected hair stylists would now not proceed to take up the
assignment at the Delhi Salons.

The Plaintiff immediately sent a detailed letter to the

Defendant on 25.09.2004 pointing out that the latter’s actions were illegal and would cause it
serious prejudice. It is also alleged that the defendant’s actions are actuated primarily on account of
their intention to transfer their Franchisee to some other competitors of the Plaintiff in the business
of Salons.
9.

It is alleged that the defendant is therefore in serious and material breach of the two

Franchisee Agreements dated 1.6.2000 and 1.7.2002, in respect of the Delhi and the Mumbai
Salons. This amounts to attempting to reneging the Master Franchisee Agreement, which is patently
illegal, as it had been concluded between the parties; it is also seriously prejudicial to the interest of
the Plaintiff and would cause irreparable and irretrievable harm, loss and damage; to the goodwill,
incapable of being restituted. It is alleged that the present Jacque Dessange Salon operated by the
Plaintiff at Delhi is identified as part of Ravissant brand. Whatever goodwill Jacque Dessange has
acquired in India is only and entirely because of the Plaintiff' efforts over the last four years.

The defendants were served, and they caused appearance, in the suit to defend the

proceedings. However, they did not file any written statement; the right to do so was foreclosed by
order dated 26th July, 2005. They also went unrepresented later on. The plaintiff, in support of its
case, examined Mr. Ravi Chawla, its Managing Director, as PW-1, through his affidavit and his
deposition in its support. He also marked documents as exhibits, in support of the suit.
11.

PW-1 deposed about the initial execution of the Franchise Agreement, between parties on 1-

6-2000 and a subsequent agreement on 1-7-2002. A copy of the latter was marked as Ex. P-2. These
two agreements led to opening of Jacque Dessange salons in Delhi and Mumbai. The witness
deposed about his desire, to the defendant in May 2003 of exploring the possibility of opening other
such salons in different parts of the country and requesting for rights as a sub-franchisee and the
forwarding of a draft Master Franchise Agreement to him through mail dated 28-5-2003. He relies
upon a letter of 3-7-2003, by defendant, Ex. P-5 approving opening of salons elsewhere and for
signing the Master Franchise Agreement. He further relies upon the defendant’s letter of
appreciation dated 19-7-2003 Ex. P-7. PW-1 also adverts to letters dated 30-3-2004 and 8-4-2004 to
support the claim that the defendant too was keen to enter into a master franchise agreement. He
claims to have hired Ms. Martine Fuzeau, a trainer from Jacques Dessange salon which was to open
at Mumbai, and also paying Rs. 7,56,417/- towards salary and travel expenses. According to PW-1,
before the additional salons could be opened at Mumbai, the existing salon had to be shut down – a
fact made known to the defendant through Ex. P-11 and Ex. P-12.
12.

PW-1 stated that the defendant, through its letter dated 14-6-2004 accepted and endorsed the

CS (OS) 1114/2004

7 of 17

plaintiff’s decision to close down the Mumbai salon, and nevertheless indicated its resolve to have
an arrangement concerning the Master Franchise agreement – Ex. P-13. Likewise, the witness
deposes about the defendant’s approval to the plaintiff’s proposal to open another salon in the New
Ravissant Store at Mumbai, in the mail dated 5-7-2004, Ex. P-15. He further claims to have spent
Rs. 75 lakhs towards renovation works and Rs. 20 lakhs towards architect’s fee, as well as Rs. 4
lakhs as rental per month and the sum of Rs. 18 lakh towards salary of staff and recruitment firm
AICE, France. PW-1 mentions about the defendant’s letter of 19-7-2004, Ex. P-17 to cancel the
franchise agreement in relation to the Delhi salon on the expiry date, i.e 31-12-2004, and yet also
showing intention to continue with the relationship as regards the Delhi salon, with modified
conditions. This was acceptable to the Plaintiff : PW-18. He claims to have travelled to meet with
the defendant’s representatives, in the first week of September, to Paris, when they agreed to enter
into the Master Franchise contract. He also claims to have spent Rs. 5,33,017/- on travelling and Rs.
3,19,365/- towards expenses, and finalized, with M/s Maletti, Italy, regarding equipments and
furniture for the new salons in Mumbai and Delhi. He claims to have spent Rs. 53, 56,065/- as
expenses; in support, he exhibited Ex. P-21 bills and vouchers. Through letter dated 13-9-2004, (Ex.
P-22) the plaintiff is said to have confirmed acceptance of the offer, including obligations listed in
it. On this basis it is deposed that the Master Franchise Agreement stood concluded.
13.

The witness PW-1 deposes that in the above background, when the plaintiff had finalized

arrangements to recruit consultants, furnish the salons, and also recruited the staff, the defendant
sent its letter dated 20-9-2004, Ex. P-23, terminating the Franchise Agreement with respect to the
Mumbai salon, with effect from 31-7-2004, apart from casting doubts about the future of the Master
CS (OS) 1114/2004

8 of 17

Franchise Agreement.
14.

The above facts and pleadings show that the plaintiff entered into two franchise agreements,

one concerning the salon in Delhi, on 1-6-2000, effective till 31-12-2004 (Ex. P-1) and the other,
concerning the salon at Mumbai, on 1-6-2002, effective till 31-12-2006 (Ex. P-2). Other than the
specifics regarding locale and period of the agreement, the terms were identical; the plaintiff agreed
to open salons in premises hired by it; the banner or brand to be used was the “Jacques Dessange”
logo. The standards for such use, the know how, uniforms etc were to be according to specifications
of the defendant. The latter owned the trademark for the product description and style. It also
claimed a certain percentage of the proceeds, as fees. The plaintiff on 14-6-2004 (Ex. P-13) notified
its decision to close down the Mumbai salon; this was accepted by the defendant. On 19-7-2004,
through Ex. P-17. The defendant notified the plaintiff about its decision to cancel the franchise
agreement in relation to the Delhi salon on the expiry date, i.e 31-12-2004. These and other
previous letters as well as discussions between the parties are claimed to be the basis of an agreed
“Master Franchise Agreement” said to have been allegedly concluded by the parties. On the
strength of these allegations, the plaintiff seeks declaration that the term of the Franchise
Agreement dated 1-6-2000 stood executed beyond 31-12-2004 and a further declaration that a
“Master Franchise agreement” is deemed to have been concluded between parties. Another
declaration that the termination letter Ex. P-23, dated 20-9-2004 is illegal and of no effect, is
claimed. Permanent injunction against the defendant restraining it from giving effect to or enforcing
the termination letter dated 20 September, 2004 and a mandatory injunction restraining the
defendant from withholding any of its obligations under the Franchise Agreements dated 1-6-2000
CS (OS) 1114/2004

9 of 17

and 1-7-2002 under the Master Franchise Agreement, have been sought.
15.

Clause 2 of both the agreements, dated 1-6-2000 and 1-7-2002, read identically, as follows:
“ Clause 2 Period of the Agreement
This Agreement, granted for a period starting on 1st June 2000 and ending on 31st
December 2004.
Tacit Renewal This Agreement shall be renewed by tacit agreement for further
periods of 5 (five) years if, 3 (three) months before each period expires, neither of
the parties has notified to the other party by registered letter with
acknowledgement of receipt, reference being made to the date of postage, of his
intention to terminate the Agreement. It shall be renewed thereafter in similar
fashion for further periods of 5 (five) years subject to the same reservations.
However, notwithstanding the preceding provisions, the FRANCHISOR shall at
any time have the option of terminating the agreement, in particular, in the event
of non-observance breach, non-performance or non-exectuion by the
FRANCHISEE of any of the following conditions pursuant to the “AVOIDANCE
CLAUSE” given under Article 16 below.”

16.

The analysis of facts would show that the plaintiff of its own volition had closed business at

the Mumbai salon.

These communications were accepted by the defendant; at that stage it

expressed the need to replace the salons, on an urgent basis. In this background, the letter dated 8 th
September, 2004 (Ex. P-21) by the defendant is indicative of its intention to enter into a master
franchise agreement with the plaintiff, for four years; certain broad terms concerning royalty, or
fees were spelt out. Other conditions were also indicated. The defendant adverted to a draft
agreement having been sent to the plaintiff, earlier, but also stated that it would send its
confirmation about the Master Franchise Agreement, after receiving he plaintiff’s response, and
evaluating it. The plaintiff expressed its willingness for the Master Franchise Agreement, in the
letter (Ex. P-22) dated 13th September, 2004. It also requested the defendant to send its confirmation
regarding acceptance of the Master Franchise agreement, whereby the plaintiff was to be its
CS (OS) 1114/2004

10 of 17

franchisee. This was followed by Ex. P-23, where the defendant declined to confirm its position
regarding a Master Franchise Agreement.
17.

Now as far as the relief is concerned, the plaintiff seeks declaratory reliefs that the term of

the Franchise Agreement dated 1-6-2000 stood executed beyond 31-12-2004 and declaration that a
“Master Franchise agreement” is deemed to have been concluded between parties. Another
declaration that the termination letter Ex. P-23, dated 20-9-2004 is illegal and of no effect, is
claimed. Permanent injunction against the defendant restraining it from giving effect to or enforcing
the termination letter dated 20 September, 2004, is sought. All these claims have to be considered
together, as the question is whether the parties are said to have entered into a lawful and binding
contract, i.e the Master Franchise Agreement.
18.

Long ago, in Haridwar Singh –vs- Bagun Sumbrui 1973 (3) SCC 889, the Supreme Court

had underlined the need for enforceability of a contractual relationship to be premised upon a
concluded contract. The court dealt with “conditional acceptance” of offers to see whether the
happening of an event, foreseen by one party could amount to acceptance, in futuro as it were. The
court held, quoting Williston : On Contracts, Vol. I, 3rd Ed., Section 77-A that:
"A nice distinction may be taken here between : (1) a so-called acceptance by
which the acceptor agrees to become immediately bound on a condition not
named in the offer, and (2) an acceptance which adopts unequivocally the terms
of the offer but states that it will not be effective until a certain contingency
happens or fails to happen. In the first case there is a counter-offer, and rejection
of the original offer; in the second case there is no counter-offer, since there is no
assent to enter into an immediate bargain. There is, so to speak, an acceptance in
escrow, which is not to take effect until the future. In the meantime, of course,
neither party is bound and either may withdraw. Moreover, if the time at which
the acceptance was to become effectual is unreasonably remote, the offer may
lapse before the acceptance becomes effective. But if neither party withdraws and
CS (OS) 1114/2004

11 of 17

the delay is not unreasonable a contract will arise when the contingency happens
or stipulated event occurs."
8. In this case, it is not the want of communication of the confirmation by the
Government to the appellant that really stands in the way of there being a
concluded contract, but rather the want of confirmation by the Government of the
conditional acceptance by the Divisional Forest Officer. The appellant's bid was
for Rs. 92,001/-. The acceptance of the bid by the Divisional Forest Officer was,
therefore, subject to confirmation by Government. The proceedings of the
Minister, dated November 27, 1970, would show that he did not confirm the
acceptance of the offer by the Divisional Forest Officer. What the Minister did
was not to confirm the acceptance made by the Divisional Forest Officer, but to
accept the offer made by the appellant in his communication, dated October 26,
1970, that he would take the coup for the reserved price of Rs. 95,000/-. There
was, therefore, no confirmation of the acceptance of the bid to take the coup in
settlement for the amount of Rs. 92,001/-. If the offer that was accepted was the
offer contained in the communication of the appellant, dated October 26, 1970,
we do not think that there was any communication of the acceptance of that offer
to the appellant.”
19.

A careful reading of the defendant’s letter dated 8th September, 2004 would show that it

sought the plaintiff’s views about the proposal to enter into a more enduring relationship, i.e the
Master Franchise Agreement. Some of the terms were spelt out; the defendant also indicated that its
previous draft for that purpose was with the plaintiff, but at the same time emphasized that the draft
had undergone some evolution. The plaintiff, in its letter Ex. P-22 agreed to the proposal, and
sought confirmation. This clearly showed that the defendant had merely issued an invitation to
offer, to the plaintiff; the latter in turn agreed. This resulted in a binding offer by the plaintiff.
However, to crystallize into a binding promise or contract, the offer had to be accepted by the
defendant. The plaintiff recognized this, and sought confirmation from the defendant. However the
defendant’s letter of 20th September 2004 unequivocally stated that it was unwilling to enter into a
Master Franchise Agreement. There was as such no concluded contract.

CS (OS) 1114/2004

20.

There is another aspect to the dispute. Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, which

empowers the civil court to issue declarations, reads as follows:
“Any person entitled to any legal character, or to any right as to any property,
may institute a suit against any person denying or interested to deny his title to
such character or right, and the Court may in its discretion make therein a
declaration that he is so entitled, and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for
any further relief:
‘‘Provided that no Court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff,
being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so”.
Section 34 obliges every litigant seeking a declaration to club all the reliefs which he is capable of
seeking, as a consequence to that relief. In this case, the plaintiff has made extensive references to
the alleged expenses incurred by it on account of the representations of the defendant to it, about the
possibility of a master franchise agreement. Those expenses have been clearly articulated in
monetary terms. Yet, the plaintiff has consciously chosen not to seek any relief in that regard.
Instead, it seeks two declarations i.e that the master franchisee agreement stood executed, and that
the termination of contract was illegal.

21.

In the judgment reported as R.K. Aneja –Vs- Delhi Development Authority 47 (1992) DLT

649, this court, emphasized the need to seek proper relief, along with the claim for declaration
and also articulated the consequence of absence or failure of the plaintiff:
“29. It is crystal clear from the prayer clauses reproduced above that the plaintiff
through the institution of the present suits wants this Court to declare Clauses 19
and 30 of the conditions of contract as un-enforceable, null and void and action
taken by the defendants under Clause 2 of the agreement also as null and void.
The sum and substance of the relief’s sought is that the defendants may not
withhold the amount and the same be paid to him. Similarly, no penalty be
imposed on him by the defendants and he be got paid the amount which has fallen
due to him into. Thus, this Court feels that the applicant could have sought

CS (OS) 1114/2004

13 of 17

further relief after seeking the impugned declaration, i.e., the recovery of the
amounts which have fallen due to him. The applicant for the best reasons known
to him confined himself to seeking a mere declaration without seeking the further
relief which he was entitled to. Such a suit I feel is clearly barred by Section 34 of
the Specific Relief Act. The learned Counsel for the applicant has failed to show
anything to the contrary.”

22.

In the present case, the plaintiff has not sought the appropriate consequential relief, i.e

decree for any amount of money allegedly spent by it, towards expenses. The plaint averments
show that such a claim was available. In view of these facts, the reliefs of declaration are clearly
barred.

23.

As regards the injunctive relief in respect of the termination letter is concerned, it would be

necessary to notice two provisions, i.e Section 14 and 41 of the Specific Relief Act. They are as
follows:

_14. Contracts not specifically enforceable.—(1) The following contracts cannot be
specifically enforced, namely:
(a) a contract for the non-performance of which compensation is an adequate relief;
(b) xxx

xxxx

xxxx

(c) a contract which is in its nature determinable
xxx

xxxx

xxxx

41. Injunction when refused—An injunction cannot be granted—
(e) to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which would not be
specifically enforced.”

24.

Under English law specific performance of contractual obligation is available only in

CS (OS) 1114/2004

14 of 17

equity and is subject to well defined restrictions. This position in explained by G.H. Treitel’s
treatise, ‘The Law of Contracts’ VIth Edition, pages 764 to 775. It is said that’s specific
performance will not be directed where damages are adequate remedy; if the contract involves
personal service, or requires constant supervision and if the party against whom specific
performance is sought is entitled to terminate the contract.

The author explains, at page 775, that—
‘If the party against whom specific performance is sought is entitled to
terminate the contract, the order will be refused as the defendant could render
it nugatory by exercising his powers to terminate. This principle applies
whether the contract is terminable under its express terms or on account of the
conduct of the party seeking specific performance.’

25.

The position, i.e effect of breach of a contract by a party seeking to specifically enforce

a contract under Indian law is dealt with in Section 14(c) read with Section 41(e) of the Specific
Relief Act, 1963. Clause (e) of Section 41 of the Specific Relief Act provides that injunction
cannot be granted to prevent the breach of contract, the performance of which would not be
specifically enforced. Clause (c) to Sub-section (1) of Section 14 says that a contract which is
in its nature determinable cannot be specifically enforced. If it is found that a contract which by
its nature is determinable, the same not only cannot be enforced but in respect of such a
contract no injunction could also be granted and this is mandate of law. This, is subject,
however, to an exception, provided in Section 42 that where a contract comprises an affirmative
agreement to do a certain act, coupled with a negative agreement, express or implied, not to do
a certain act, the circumstances that the Court is unable to compel specific performance of the

CS (OS) 1114/2004

15 of 17

affirmative agreement shall not preclude it from granting an injunction to perform the negative
agreement.

26.

In Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Amritsar Gas Service and Others, 1991 (1) S.C.C. 533,

the Supreme Court considered the terms of a distributorship agreement, which could in terms,
be terminated, under Clauses 27 and 28. The respondent contended that since the contract had
not been terminated in accordance with Clause 27, the firm was entitled to continuance of
distributorship in the special circumstances of the case, which was upheld by the Arbitrator.
Supreme Court set aside the award of the arbitrator on the ground that there is error of law
apparent on the face of the record and grant of relief in the award cannot be sustained. It was
held—

"Sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act specifies the contracts
which cannot be specifically enforced, one of which is a contract which is in
its nature determinable. In the present case, it is not necessary to refer to the
other clauses of Sub-section (1) of Section 14, which also may be attracted in
the present case since Clause (c) clearly applies on the finding read with
reasons given in the award itself that the contract by its nature is
determinable. This being so granting the relief of restoration of the
distributorship even on the finding that the breach was committed by the
appellant-Corporation is contrary to the mandate in Section 14(1) of the
Specific Relief Act and there is no error of law apparent on the face of the
award which is stated to be made according to the law governing such cases.
The grant of this relief in the award cannot, therefore, be sustained."
In M/s. Classic Motors Ltd. v. M/s. Maruti Udyog Ltd., (1997) 65 D.L.T.166 this Court
observed—

‘In view of long catena of decisions and consistent view of the Supreme Court,
I hold that in private commercial transaction the parties could terminate a
contract even without assigning any reasons with a reasonable period of

notice in terms of such a Clause in the agreement..”

The above position has been endorsed in other judgments, such as Marriott International Inc. &
Others––Vs--Ansal Hotels Ltd. & Anr 82 (1999) DLT 137 Airport Authority of India –vs- Kunwar
Singh Yadav 82 (1999) DLT 546; Indian Oil Corporation –vs- Shriram Gas Service 57 (1995)
DLT 279; Rajasthan Breweries Ltd. v. The Stroh Brewery Co., 2000 VI AD (Delhi) 741 and
Cogent Silver Fibre Pte Ltd. V. Noble Fibre Technologies Inc. & Ors 127 (2006) DLT 707.

27.

In the present case, both the franchise agreements, relating to the Delhi venture as well

as the one pertaining to Mumbai, contained clear stipulations which made them determinable. In
these circumstances, applying the rule in Amritsar Gas Service’s case (supra) and the other
decisions which have followed it, the court concludes that injunctive reliefs are barred, in view
of Sections 14 and 41 of the Specific Reliefs Act. The plaintiff has also not established that any
affirmative obligation under Section existed, which entitled it to such relief. Thus, the other
reliefs claimed too cannot be granted.

28.

In view of the findings recorded above, the suit has to fail; it is accordingly dismissed.
