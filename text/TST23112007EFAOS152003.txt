Per Thakur,J(Oral):
This order shall dispose of EFA(OS)15/2003 and Review
Application No. 440/2006.

While EFA(OS)15/2003 arises out of an

interim order passed by a learned Single Judge of this Court in
execution proceedings arising out of a compromise decree passed in
Suit No.1550/1997, Review Application no. 440/2006 is directed
against an interim order passed by a Division bench of this Court in
the present appeal.

The controversy arises in the following factual

backdrop:
2.

Civil

suit

no.

1550/1997

for

recovery

of

a

sum

of

Rs.20,61,416.25/- on the basis of two dishonored cheques issued by
the defendant-appellant in this appeal was filed by the plaintiffrespondent No.1, on the original side of this Court.

EFA(Os)15/2003 & RA440/2006

A compromise

Page 1 of 11

application under Order 23 Rule 1 & 3 read with Section 151 of CPC
was filed in the said suit inter alia stating that the parties had entered
into an amicable settlement between themselves providing for
payment of a sum of Rs.11,82,500/- to the plaintiff in the suit in full
and final settlement of the claim made in the same. The settlement
also provided for delivery of possession of property bearing no. 7/18,
Kalkaji Extension, New Delhi on the 2nd floor left hand side of the
building.

A decree passed in terms of the said settlement was

eventually passed by R.C. Chopra, J, as his lordship then was, on 30 th
September, 2002, in the following words:

“This application under order
23 Rule 3 CPC been filed for
passing a decree in terms of

been signed by all parties and is
supported by their affidavits also.

&

3.

We may also, at this stage, gainfully extract the critical part of

the settlement between the parties relating to the payment of a sum
of Rs.11,82,500/- to the plaintiff and the delivery of possession of the
property mentioned above to the defendant.

Para 3.1 of the joint

application filed by the parties, in this regard, reads as under:

EFA(Os)15/2003 & RA440/2006

Page 2 of 11

“3.1 The defendants shall pay a sum of
Rs.11,82,500/- (Rupees eleven lacs eighty two
thousand five hundred) to the plaintiff in full
and final settlement of the reliefs claimed in
the suit and consequently the plaintiff shall
deliver the possession of the said immovable
property being Second Floor left hand side of
property no. 7/18, Kalkaji Extension, New
Delhi, to the defendants.”

4.

Despite the amicable settlement arrived at between them and

the decree passed by the Court, the parties were it appears unable to
resolve the matters regarding payment of the amount and delivery of
possession, outside the Court necessitating institution of Executing
proceedings of the decree mentioned above. In the said proceedings
an order was passed by the Executing Court on 4th September, 2003
directing deposit by the judgment debtor of a sum of Rs.11,82,500/- in
the Court and release of the said amount in favour of the plaintiff
upon the plaintiff furnishing security to the satisfaction of the
Registrar General of this Court within a period of two weeks. Since
the order in question is brief, the same may be extracted in extenso
for ready reference:

“Ex. No. 262/2002
Mr.

Chetan

Sharma,

learned

senior

Advocate appearing for the decree holder
states that a fresh cheque No. 137053 dated
3rd September, 2003 drawn on Bank of Pubjab,
Chandigarh in the sum of Rs.11,82,500/- is
ready with him and he is prepared to deposit
the same in the Court in lieu of the earlier
cheque which has lost its validity due to lapse
of time.

The cheque is ordered to be

deposited in the Court.
Mr. Arun Batta, learned counsel for the
EFA(Os)15/2003 & RA440/2006

Page 3 of 11

judgment debtor prays that the amount be
paid to be judgment debtor subject to his
furnishing a security/surely subject to the
outcome of the execution petition.

The

request is opposed by the counsel for the
decree holder. Having regard to the facts and
circumstances that the amount deposited by
the

decree

holder

is

pursuant

to

a

compromise/consent decree passed by this
Court about three years back, it seems to be
expedient that without prejudice to the pleas
and contentions raised by the decree holder
and the applicant/objector and subject to the
judgment

debtor

furnishing

a

property

security within two weeks to the satisfaction of
the registrar General, the amount so deposited
may be released in favour of the judgment
debtor.
Ordered accordingly.
Mr. Arun Batta, learned counsel for the
judgment debtor does not wish to file a reply
to the execution petition or to the additional
affidavit. Rejoinder, if, any, by the applicant –
objector may be filed within two weeks.
List the matter on 17th October, 2003.
R.C. JAIN, J”
5.

Aggrieved by the above order, the defendants-appellants have

filed EFA(OS)15/2003 to argue that the payment of the amount of
Rs.11,82,500/- was subject to the delivery of possession of the flat in
question in their favour.

It was contended by Messers Parekh and

Shukla appearing for the appellants that while the appellants had no
difficulty in depositing the amount payable under the decree in the
Court, its release in favour of the plaintiff-respondent no.1 was wholly
unjustified.

It was contended by them that release of the amount

EFA(Os)15/2003 & RA440/2006

Page 4 of 11

without Respondent No.1 surrendering the possession of the flat in
their favour amounted to placing a premium on the illegal act of the
respondent by allowing the respondent to continue holding the
property illegally and also receive the amount which he would be
entitled to receive only when he delivers the property to the
appellants.
6.

During the pendency of this appeal, a division bench of this

Court had by an order dated 13th October, 2006 directed Sh. Rakesh
Kumar Singh, respondent no.2, the party who is reported to be in
actual physical possession of the flat in question, to deposit in this
Court a sum of Rs.25,000/- per month towards mesne profits w.e.f.
23rd January, 2003.

Aggrieved by the said direction, Sh. Rakesh

Kumar Singh has filed Review Application no. 440/2006. Mr. Tiwary,
counsel appearing on behalf of the review applicant argues that Sh.
Rakesh Kumar Singh, Respondent no. 2 was not a tenant in
occupation of the property. He submits that Sh. Rakesh Kumar Singh
was let in possession of the property in question by plaintiffrespondent no.1 in the suit acting through Smt. Deepa Dhingra, its
Managing Director. He further submits that while Respondent No.2
was in occupation of the property, he had negotiated a sale in his
favour from Appellant No.1 company. In support of that submission,
Mr. Tiwary placed reliance upon an agreement dated 21st January,
2003 allegedly executed between the appellant no.1 company and
Ambuja Hotels and Real Estates Pvt. Ltd. through Sh. Rakesh Kumar
Singh, its Director. He argued that since the flat in question was in
possession of Ambuja Hotels and Real Estates Pvt. Ltd. in its own
right on the basis of the agreement to sell executed in his favour by
the appellant company, there was no justification for directing the
company or respondent No.2, its Director to deposit mesne profits of
EFA(Os)15/2003 & RA440/2006

Page 5 of 11

Rs.25,000/- per month. The order of this Court dated 13th October,
2006, argued the learned counsel, suffered from errors apparent on
the face of the record, hence deserved to be set aside.
7.

According to Messrs Parikh and Shukla, a document purporting

to be an agreement to sell had, no doubt, been executed by appellant
No.1 company but the transaction had fallen through on account of
the fact that cheques for Rs.40 lacs given by the respondent no.2,
Ambuja Hotels and Real Estates Pvt. Ltd. had been dishonored. It was
contended by M/s Parekh and Shukla that since the R-2 and his
company M/s Ambuja Hotels and Real Estates Pvt. Ltd. had cheated
Appellant No.1 company, there was no question of the said agreement
to sell coming to the rescue of R-2 or his company in order to
legitimize its possession over the flat in question.
8.

Mr. Tiwary, on the other hand, argued by reference to the

document executed between the parties that the same acknowledges
receipt of a sum of Rs.5 lacs in cash while another sum of Rs.10 lacs
was paid by cheque dated 21st January, 2003 favouring M/s Aggarwal
Law Associates and a sum of Rs.11,82,500/- was deposited payable to
M/s Mauve & Crimson Advertising. Towards the sale price a sum of
Rs.13,18,000/- alone was payable for which a cheque was issued to
the appellant No.1 company in full and final settlement of the entire
claim

towards

the

sale

consideration

for

the

proposed

sale

transaction. Since Mr. Rakesh Kumar Singh had in the meantime got
reliable information from one Sh. C.V. Shah that the property no
longer belonged to appellant no.1 company, the payment of that
cheque was stopped.

There was according to Mr. Tiwary, no

deliberate stoppage or dis-honoring of the cheque issued towards sale
consideration as alleged by the appellants. It is noteworthy that Sh.
C.V. Shah from whom respondent No.-2 claims to have received the
EFA(Os)15/2003 & RA440/2006

Page 6 of 11

information regarding the appellant company having no saleable
interest left in the property, has himself filed OS No. 1329/2003 in
this Court in which an interim order dated 7th July, 2003 passed by a
Single Judge of this Court has restrained the defendants in the said
suit including respondent No.-2, Ambuja Hotels and Real Estates Pvt.
Ltd.

as also the appellants from transferring the possession of the

property or creating any third party interest in the same. The interim
order reads as under:

“Accordingly, by an ad-interim injunction, I
restrain defendant No.4 from parting with
possession or creating any third party interest
in respect of flat on second floor, admeasuring
1800 sp. ft. of super area on plot No.7/18,
Kalkaji Extension, New Delhi. Defendant Nos.
2,3, and 5 are also restrained from creating
any third party interest in respect of flat on
second floor, admeasuring 1800 sp. ft. of
super area on plot No.7/18, Kalkaji Extension,
New Delhi.
Provisions of Order XXXIX Rule 3 CPC
be complied with within three days.

Sd/Manmohan Sarin,J”
9.

The interim order passed by this Court on 13th October, 2006

has been complied with by respondent no. 2 in part.

The said

respondent has, pursuant to the directions issued by this court on 20th
December, 2006 in the review application, deposited 50% of the
amount in terms of the direction of this Court. The said amount is
lying in deposit.
10.

Having given our careful consideration to the submissions made

at the bar and having perused the record, we are of the considered
EFA(Os)15/2003 & RA440/2006

Page 7 of 11

opinion that the controversy lies in a narrow compass. The issue that
arises in the appeal preferred before us is whether the direction
issued by the Executing Court for deposit of a sum of Rs.11,82,500/by appellant no.1 and its release in favour of respondent no.1 in this
appeal was justified having regard to the fact that the said amount
was to be paid in lieu of delivery of possession of the flat in question
in favour of appellant no.1 company. The grievance of the appellants
as noticed earlier is that while the appellant company is ready and
willing to make the deposit, the amount so deposited should not have
been directed to be released in favour of the respondent no.1 till such
time possession of the flat was not delivered to the appellants in terms
of

para 3.1 of the settlement extracted earlier.

There is, in our

opinion, merit in that contention. On a plain reading of para 3.1 of the
settlement between the parties, payment of Rs.11,82,500/- to the
plaintiff in the suit was to be simultaneously effected by delivery of
possession of the property in possession of the plaintiff. It is true that
the Court could have directed deposit of the amount before issuing a
warrant for recovery of possession and simultaneous release of the
amount upon delivery of premises by the plaintiff but that is not what
the court has done. There is no direction in the impugned order for
simultaneous recovery of possession from respondent no.1. All that
the order directs, is deposit of the amount and its release subject to
the respondent no. 1 furnishing security.

That direction, in our

opinion, is likely to result in an inequitable situation inasmuch as the
appellants company would neither get the possession of the property
nor retain dominion over the money.

The proper course, in our

opinion, was to direct deposit of the money but withhold disbursement
till such time the possession of the flat was not voluntarily handed
over to appellant no.1 or delivered under the coercive process of the
EFA(Os)15/2003 & RA440/2006

Page 8 of 11

Court. To that extent alone, we find there is room for our interference
with the impugned order. Respondent No.-1 has not, it is noteworthy,
appeared to contest this appeal which implies that she has no
objection to the modification of the order nor is she interested in
having the direction regarding disbursement enforced against the
appellants.
11.

That leaves us with the question whether the claim made by

respondent No.-2 whether individually or on behalf of his company
M/s Ambuja Hotels and Real Estates Pvt. Ltd. needs to be investigated
in these proceedings. The admitted position, as noticed earlier, is that
respondent No.-2 is in occupation of the flat in question as the
Director of the company mentioned above. That company claims to be
holding the property in its own right based on an independent
agreement to sell entered into between appellant no. 1 and M/s
Ambuja Hotels and Real Estates Pvt. Ltd.

As to whether the

agreement is valid in the eye of law, has been properly executed and
is enforceable and if so whether execution of the decree can be
obstructed on the basis of that agreement are matters which do not
directly fall for our consideration in these appeals. All those issues
can and, in our opinion, ought to be agitated before the Executing
Court in proper proceedings.

In that view, the direction regarding

payment of Rs.25,000/- per month towards mesne profits also requires
to be modified to the extent that while the amount deposited by
respondent No.-2 would remain available to the Executing Court for
proper adjudication and adjustment of equities in the ultimate
analysis, the deposit of the balance amount in terms of the said
direction would stand waived and the order to that extent modified.
12.

Insofar as the claim made by Sh. C.V. Shah is concerned, since

the matter is pending before a Single Judge of this Court on the
EFA(Os)15/2003 & RA440/2006

Page 9 of 11

original side, the issues raised in the suit can and ought to be suitably
agitated and determined in the same.
13.

In the result, we allow EFA(OS) 15/2003 and R.A. 440/2006 but

only in part and to the following extent:
(a)

Order dated 4th September, 2003 shall stand modified to
the extent that while appellant no.1 company shall deposit
a sum of Rs.11,82,500/- with the Executing Court in terms
of the direction already given, the said amount shall not be
disbursed to plaintiff respondent no.1 till such time the
possession of the flat is not delivered to the appellant
company in terms of the compromise decree passed by the
Court.

The appellant shall be free, in this regard, to

approach the Executing Court for a proper direction for
delivery of possession in which event respondent no.2 i.e.
Ambuja Hotels and Real Estates Pvt. Ltd. shall be free to
object to the execution of the decree on all such grounds
as are legally available to it including the ground that
there is an agreement to sell executed between appellant
no.1 company and M/s Ambuja Hotels and Real Estates
Pvt. Ltd. Needless to say that if any such objections are
filed, the Executing Court shall examine the same in
accordance with law and pass appropriate orders on the
same.
(b)

Orders dated 13th October, 2006 shall stand modified with
the direction that the amount of Rs.5,87,500/- deposited
by respondent no.2 in this Court shall stand transferred to
the Executing Court for appropriate orders regarding the
same upon adjudication of the issues that arise for
consideration. Further deposit in terms of the said order

EFA(Os)15/2003 & RA440/2006

Page 10 of 11

shall stand waived.
(c)

It shall also be open to the parties to seek any further
direction from the Executing Court regarding mesne
profits if otherwise legally permissible.

14.

No costs.
