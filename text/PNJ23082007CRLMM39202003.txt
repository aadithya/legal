Vide Crl.M.C. No.2111/2004 Anu Gautam prays that

the orders dated 25.1.2003 and 5.2.2003 passed by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge be quashed.
3.

Order dated 25.1.2003 passed by the learned

Additional Sessions Judge reads as under:“Present: Shri L.C.Jain APP for the State with
SI Shiv Darshan with case file and
complainant Smt.Anu with
her counsel
Sh.S.K.Sharma, Adv. Sh.K.K.Madan,
Adv. for the petitioner.

4.

Heard.
Efforts for settlement were made.
Complainant is ready and willing to receive
Rs.5,00,000/- in full and final settlement
including alimony from the petitioner. Payment
of Rs.73,000/- has already been made. The
said amount shall be deducted from agreed
amount of Rs.5,00,000/-.
Both the parties
agree that they will move for quashing for FIR
and mutual divorce. Rs.2,27,000/- (Two Lac
Twenty Seven Thousand) will be paid at the
time of conclusion of this bail application. At
the request of the parties adjourned to
30.1.2003 as prayed. Till then interim order to
continue.”
Order dated 5.2.2003 passed by the learned

Additional Sessions Judge reads as under:“Present : APP for State with complainant
and her counsel.
Counsel for applicant/accused.

Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.2 of 26

Heard.
Parties have arrived at
compromise. They are filing petition for divorce
and the matter has been settled for
Rs.5,00,000/-. Out of which sum of Rs.2,98,000/has been paid by cheque of Rs.2,05,000/bearing cheque No.502081-110023036 and cash
of Rs.20,000/- today.
Keeping in view the facts and
circumstances of the case, applicants are
ordered to be released on bail, in the event of
their arrest, on their furnishing a personal bond
in the sum of Rs.20,000/- each with one surety
each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the
concerned IO/SHO subject to the condition that
the applicant shall join investigation as and when
called for by the IO.
Sd/- ASJ
At this stage, counsel for complainant
showed the cheque to the court that there is a
discrepancy in cheque in as much as a sum of
Two lacs Five Thousand has been mentioned in
words and in figures only a sum of Rs.Two lacs
Five thousand (2,00005) has been mentioned.
Let, notice be issued to the accused/applicants
for 6.2.2003. Put up on 6.2.2003. Cheque is
attached.”
5.

Sd/- ASJ
Whereas husband prays that the twin effect of the

orders dated 25.1.2003 and 5.2.2003 is that Anu Gautam
settled all her claims for Rs.5 lakhs and on receipt of the same
consented to the FIR being quashed, since he has paid Rs.3
lakhs and as per the settlement is ready to pay further Rs.2
lakhs, the FIR be quashed.

Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.3 of 26

6.

Case pleaded by Anu Gautam is that she never gave

any such consent. That it is preposterous for any reasonable
person to believe that she gave any such consent considering
that her streedhan illegally retained by her in-laws was valued
at more than Rs.15 lacs coupled with the fact that her husband
was earning nearly Rs.1 lakh per month. Pithly stated, case of
Anu Gautam is that no sane person would receive Rs.5 lakhs as
full and final settlement amount for the claim towards
streedhan, maintenance and permanent alimony.
7.

Fulcrum of submission made by Shri M.C.Bhandare,

learned senior counsel for Anu Gautam was that a settlement
between the parties as per requirement of Order 23 Rule 3 of
the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 has to be evidenced in
writing. It was urged that there being none, mandate of law
not being complied with, it has to be treated that there is no
settlement between the parties.

9.

Learned senior counsel further submitted that the

FIR registered under Section 406/498-A IPC had additionally to
be registered under Section 420 Cr.P.C. inasmuch as the
allegations in the FIR evidence the offence of cheating.
10.

Offence of cheating stated to have been committed

by the husband, as projected by learned senior counsel, was
not disclosing that the husband was a divorcee.
11.

Learned senior counsel urged that the marital status

of a party was a material fact relating to marriage and a
deception with respect thereto would be an act of cheating.
12.

Learned senior counsel raised a grievance that the

learned Additional Sessions Judge held as many as 17
proceedings while considering application for anticipatory bail
sought by the husband.

Learned senior counsel stated that

proceedings for grant of anticipatory bail could not be
converted into a civil proceedings to effect compromise
between the parties. Learned senior counsel urged that such
tendency of Courts was deprecated by the Supreme Court in
the decision reported as (2004) 3 SCC 388 Biman Chatterjee

Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

vs. Sanchita Chatterjee & Anr.
13.

Issues

which

need

consideration

may

be

summarised as under:(1)

Whether it is mandatory that every settlement has

to be recorded in writing before it can be accepted by a
Court and consequential orders passed thereon.
(2)

Whether Anu Gautam never gave any consent to

compromise the matrimonial dispute.

As a limb of this

consideration, it needs to be considered whether Anu
Gautam can plead inadequacy of consideration as a
ground to urge that there was no settlement between the
parties.
(3)

Whether

Courts,

while

considering

grant

of

anticipatory bail can encourage parties to settle their
disputes.
(4)

Whether anticipatory bail granted to the husband

needs to be revoked.
(5)

Whether the FIR in

question

deserves

to

be

cancelled.
14.

Certain admitted facts need to be noted, for the

reason, in my opinion they would throw considerable light on
the issue.

15.

After orders dated 25.1.2003 and 5.2.2003 were

passed, on 26.5.2003, Anu Gautam lodged a caveat under
Section 148-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in the Court
of District and Sessions Judge, Gurgaon in which she pleaded as
under:“8.
That the respondent and his family
members applied for grant of anticipatory bail under
Section 438 Cr.P.C. before the District and Sessions
Judge, Delhi.
On 25.1.2003 on hearing the bail
application on behalf of the respondent Anupam
Sharma, Pramila Sharma, Akriti Sharma, Upma Sharma
and Shri Rajinder Gaur it was settled by the Hon'ble
Court that accused persons will pay an amount of Rs.5
lacs to the caveator and both parties will move petition
for dissolution of marriage by way of mutual consent
and quashing of FIR.
9.
That the respondent and his family
members paid Rs.3 lacs to the caveator upto 6.2.2003
before the Hon'ble Court of Shri T.D.Keshav, ASJ, Delhi
and remaining balance has to be paid to the caveator
by the respondent and his family members at the time
of divorce and quashing of FIR.
10.
That a period of 15 days has passed but no
initiations regarding the compliance of order dated
25.1.2003 and 5.2.2003 have been made by the
respondent.
11.
That the caveator has the apprehension
that respondent in order to get rid off from the
liabilities of balance payment of Rs.2 lacs may file the
suit for dissolution of marriage and get a decree of
divorce by misrepresentation of facts and using unfair
means therein hence this caveat.”
16.

Anu Gautam had filed an application under Section

Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.7 of 26

125 Cr.P.C. at Aligarh.

She had claimed maintenance.

On

5.4.2003, her husband Anupam Gupta filed an objection stating
that having agreed to receive Rs.5 lacs from him in full and
final

satisfaction

of

all

her

claims,

including

claim

for

maintenance, she could not claim any maintenance under
Section 125 Cr.P.C.
17.

In response to the said reply Anu Gautam filed a

rejoinder on 23.4.2003. She pleaded as under:-

18.

“The submission of the respondent is false and
baseless as is evident from the orders enclosed
with the application of the respondent that the
compromise of the petitioner with the respondent
was for quashing FIR under Section 406/498-A/34
IPC and for divorce between the parties. This
Agreement was regarding the FIR No.323/02, U/S
406/498-A/34 IPC, PS Vikaspuri. No compromise
has been done U/S 125 Cr.P.C. between the
parties for maintenance.”
Dealing with the first issue required to be

considered, viz. whether it is imperative in law that a
settlement has to be recorded in writing and if not so recorded,
no settlement can be relied upon, much less made the
foundation of an order passed by the Court, no doubt Order 23
Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires that where
subject matter of a suit is compromised between the parties
and is evidenced in writing and signed by the parties the Court
shall proceed to dispose of the suit as per the compromise.
Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.8 of 26

But, the phrase in said rule 'or where the defendant satisfies
the plaintiff in respect of the whole or any part of the subjectmatter of the Suit, the Court shall order such agreement,
compromise or satisfaction to be recorded' as also to be
considered.
19.

Thus, prima facie the legislative intent is not to

restrict evidence of a compromise to be in the form of a written
agreement. The legislative intent is that it would be desirable
to record a settlement agreement in writing but the same may
even be proved to the satisfaction of the Court by parole
evidence.

What, if during arguments parties arrive at a

settlement which is recorded by the Court in its order? Could it
not be urged that the order of the Court itself records the
settlement in writing.
20.

Prima facie, the answer has to be in the affirmative.

21.

To read Order 23 Rule 3 to mean that unless a

compromise is recorded in writing and signed by the parties it
cannot be accepted by the Court would render otiose the
phrase 'or where the defendant satisfies the plaintiff in respect

Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.9 of 26

of the whole or any part of the subject-matter of the Suit,
the Court shall order such agreement, compromise or
satisfaction to be recorded'.
22.

I eschew from deciding the wider issue whether

an oral compromise recorded outside the Court is capable of
being enforced in a proceedings between the parties for the
reason instant case relates to a compromise effected before
the Court concerned.

The terms of the compromise have

been recorded by the learned Judge in the order dated
25.1.2003 followed by the order dated 5.2.2003.
23.

In the instant case, the compromise stands

recorded in writing in the form of a judicial order.

It has

been arrived at before a senior judicial officer of the rank of
an Additional Session Judge. It has been recorded in writing
in a judicial order. The judicial order has been relied upon
by Anu Guatam in judicial proceedings.

She has received

benefit under the order recording settlement.
24.

That takes me to the second issue which needs to be

determined.

Whether

there

is material on record to

evidence

Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.10 of 26

that Anu Gautam consented to a compromise which was
correctly recorded in the order dated 25.1.2003.
25.

Determination of said issue requires me to visit the

proceedings before the learned Additional Sessions Judge as
evidenced in the orders passed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge while dealing with the application filed by
Anupam Sharma seeking anticipatory bail.

On 2.9.2002

learned ASJ recorded that during course of arguments it
emerged that there are chances of a possible reconciliation.
Matter was thereafter adjourned from time to time.

On

20.9.2002 it was recorded that Rs.73,000/- have been tendered
by Anupam Sharma to Anu Gautam in lieu of part of her dowry
articles.

It was further recorded that parties would try and

arrive at a settlement. Matter was thereafter adjourned from
time to time.
26.

On 26.10.2002 an order was passed recording that

Anu Gautam was willing to settle the dispute if Rs.7 lacs was
paid to her.

Matter was adjourned from time to time noting

that there are chances of a settlement. Ultimately, order dated
25.1.2003 was passed followed by the order dated 5.2.2003.
27.

A perusal of the order dated 25.1.2003 shows that

Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.11 of 26

after recording a settlement where-under Anu Gautam had to
receive Rs.5 lacs from her husband towards full and final
settlement, including alimony, from her husband it was
recorded that part satisfaction of the claim has been made, in
that, Rs.73,000/- has already been received by Anu Gautam.
The order further records that Rs.2,27,000/- would be paid at
the time of conclusion of the application filed by Anupam
Sharma seeking anticipatory bail.
28.

Matter was adjourned.

29.

Order dated 5.2.2003 records that a cheque in sum

of Rs.2,05,000/- has been handed over to Anu Gautam. That
she had further received Rs.20,000/- in cash.
30.

Order dated 5.2.2003 records that a second order

was passed on said date to the effect that the cheque tendered
to the complainant had discrepancy in the same vis-a-vis what
was stated in the words and what was stated in figures.
31.

It is thus evident that Anu Gautam, conscious of a

settlement, received further payment by means of a cheque.
No worthwhile explanation is forthcoming on record as to on
what account Anu Gautam received the cheque in Court on
5.2.2003.
32.

As noted herein above, Anu Gautam lodged a caveat

Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.12 of 26

in the Court of the District and Sessions Judge, Gurgaon
wherein she made detailed averments pertaining to the
settlement recorded vide order dated 25.1.2003.

She stated

that she has received Rs.3 lacs pursuant to the settlement.
She expressed an apprehension that her husband may seek
divorce by relying upon the order dated 25.1.2003 without
complying with his further obligation to pay to her balance sum
of Rs.2 lacs.
33.

Explaining pleadings of Anu Gautam as made in the

caveat, Shri M.C.Bhandare, learned senior counsel for Anu
Gautam submitted that this Court should take judicial notice of
the fact that litigants blindly sign pleadings drafted by their
lawyers.

Thus, counsel urged that pleadings in the caveat

petition could not be treated as pleadings of Anu Gautam.
34.

I am afraid, the explanation is worthy of no

credence.
35.

It is not in dispute that the lawyer who lodged

caveat at Gurgaon was not the counsel who was appearing for
Anu Gautam in the application filed by her husband seeking
anticipatory bail at Delhi.

Therefore, how would a different

counsel know that his client had suffered the order dated
25.1.2003 recording a settlement.
Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.13 of 26

36.

In lighter vein, I may record that Shri M.C.Bhandare,

learned senior counsel for Anu Gautam did not urge that
counsel engaged by her i.e. Anu Gautam at Gurgaon, through
transcendental meditation gathered knowledge about the order
dated 25.1.2003 passed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge at Delhi in the application seeking anticipatory bail by
Anupam Sharma.
37.

The facts stated in the caveat lodged by Anu

Gautam could not have dawned upon her counsel engaged at
Gurgaon save and except from the information provided to the
counsel by Anu Gautam.
38.

Further,

there

is

no

explanation

vis-a-vis

the

pleadings of Anu Gautam as drafted by her counsel at Aligarh
when she responded by way of a rejoinder to the reply filed by
her husband opposing her application for maintenance under
Section 125 Cr.P.C.
39.

Surely, the third counsel engaged at Aligarh could

not have pleaded about the settlement arrived at before the
learned Additional Sessions Judge at Delhi as reflected in the
order dated 25.1.2003 save and except through information
provided to him by Anu Gautam.
40.

I have noted herein above, pleadings of Anu Gautam

Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.14 of 26

in the rejoinder afore referred to.

She has categorically

pleaded that Rs.5 lacs receivable by her as per the settlement
recorded in the order dated 25.1.2003 related to her claim
which was subject matter of the FIR No.323/2002 i.e. recorded
her consent that if she received said amount as finds mention
in the order dated 25.1.2003 she will agree to the FIR being
quashed and marriage be dissolved by mutual consent. She
tried to explain the compromise by pleading that it excluded
right to receive maintenance.
41.

At this stage, I may deal with the submission made

by learned counsel for Anu Gautam that his client had been
writing letters to the police authorities informing that she was
being threatened by her husband.
13.5.2002,

29.5.2002,

The letters are dated

24.6.2002,

4.7.2002,

5.9.2002,

8.9.2002, 26.1.2003 and 9.2.2003.

that

letters

Anu Gautam informed

the ACP, Crime Against Women Cell, Kirti Nagar that her
statement in Court on 25.1.2003 was not voluntary and that
she had received Rs.2.27 lacs in Court on 6.2.2003 under
pressure. It was urged that cumulative effect of all the letters
and in particular letters dated 26.1.2003 and 9.2.2003 clinched
Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.15 of 26

the issue in favour of Anu Gautam.
43.

In respect of the letters it is relevant to note that

Anu Gautam had filed a Transfer Petition No.125/2004 in the
Supreme Court praying that the instant petitions in this Court
be transferred to the Allahabad High Court. In paragraphs 2 (i)
to 2 (xii) she had made a reference to the letters above noted
and in particular her letters dated 26.1.2003 and 9.2.2003
addressed to the ACP, Crime Against Women Cell, Kirti Nagar.
44.

An affidavit was filed before the Supreme Court on

28.3.2005 under the signatures of DCP West District. Claim of
Anu Gautam of having addressed letters to the ACP, Crime
Against Women Cell, Kirti Nagar was denied.

47.

If that was to be so, there is no worthwhile

explanation as to why Anu Gautam did not seek transfer of the
Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.16 of 26

proceedings to some other Judge.

48.

In the connection, it is relevant that the proceedings

before the learned Additional Sessions Judge remained pending
for nearly 5 months. Not a whisper was made by Anu Gautam
that she was being compelled to enter into a settlement. In
decision reported as 2005 (1) JCC 83 Mohd. Shamim Vs. Nahid
Begum pertaining to a settlement before a learned Additional
Sessions Judge where wife alleged that she was not aware of
the settlement, it was held:-

49.

“11.
In view of the fact that the settlement was
arrived at the intervention of a judicial officer of the
rank of the Additional Sessions Judge, we are of the
opinion, the contention of the first respondent herein to
the effect that she was not aware of the contents
thereof and the said agreement as also the affidavit
which were got signed by her by misrepresentation of
facts must be rejected. In the facts and circumstances
of this case, we have no doubt in our mind that the
denial of execution of the said deed of settlement is an
afterthought on the part of the respondent No.1
herein.”
I thus hold that evidence on record conclusively

establishes that Anu Gautam was conscious of the compromise
recorded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge in the order
Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.17 of 26

dated 25.1.2003.

She accepted part payment under the

compromise. She pleaded the compromise in 2 independent
proceedings.
50.

As regards

the

issue

whether the compromise

is

vitiated on account of inadequacy of consideration suffice
would it be to note that Anu Gautam never went back to the
learned Additional Sessions Judge to explain under what
circumstances she gave her consent for the compromise.
51.

More often than not, parties receive under hand

considerations and therefore did not bring the same on record.
May be this has happened in the instant case.
52.

But I refrain from making conjectures or from

surmising. Anu Gautam is an educated girl. She could not be
oblivious of what was going on.

What is conclusive and

relevant is that after 25.1.2003 till as late as April 2003, in 2
independent proceedings before 2 different judges, through 2
different counsel, Anu Gautam relied upon the settlement
recorded in the order dated 25.1.2003.
53.

It is difficult to believe that under threat of harm to

the person of Anu Gautam, she was compelled to continue to
Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.18 of 26

affirm and rely upon the settlement for nearly 3 months.
54.

Under the circumstances I hold that facts on record

would not justify an inquiry by this Court on the adequacy or
inadequacy of the sum settled to be received by Anu Gautam in
satisfaction of her claims and her consent recorded to the
effect that if agreed amount was paid to her she would join in
the quashing of the FIR.
55.

On the question whether Courts should or should not

encourage settlement between the parties when applications
for anticipatory bail or bail are filed by the husband or the inlaws of the complainant, I may note that the decision relied
upon by learned counsel for Anu Gautam relates to an issue of
grant of anticipatory bail and cancellation thereof pertaining to
a stated compromise between the parties.

The Hon'ble

Supreme Court opined that on the facts and circumstances
their Lordships failed to note any compromise. In para 7 of the
decision in Biman Chatterjee's case (supra) their Lordships
have observed:-

56.

“Here we hasten to observe first of all from the
material on record, we do not find that there was
any compromise arrived at between the parties
at all, hence, question of fulfilling the terms of
such compromise does not arise.”
No doubt, thereafter, their Lordships observed that

Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.19 of 26

non-fulfillment of terms of a compromise would by themselves
not constitute a ground to cancel a bail granted to the in-laws.
57.

With the plethora of laws operating in the filed of

domestic disputes, Courts have been choked by multiplicity of
proceedings arising out of a matrimonial dispute.
58.
many

Experience shows that at the drop of the hat as
as

5

substantive

proceedings

are

initiated

simultaneously. The first is a complaint for dowry harassment
and misappropriation of streedhan. It results in registration of
a FIR under Section 498-A/406 IPC. Parties fight pitched battles
whether anticipatory bail should be granted to the in-laws of
the complainant.

Not one but multiple anticipatory bail

applications are filed because of the usual tendency to rope in
virtually every members of the family of the in-laws. Married
sisters of the husband, their husbands and even married
brothers and their wives who are residing separately are
implicated. In some cases as many as 10 to 15 applications for
seeking anticipatory bail are filed. Simultaneous proceedings
under Section 125 Cr.P.C. are initiated. Proceedings are also
initiated under the Protection of Women From Domestic
Violence (Act) 2005. Apart from the said 3 proceedings which
are penal in nature, a divorce proceeding is initiated in which
Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.20 of 26

application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act springs
out. If there is a minor child born to the warring couple, a 5 th
proceeding

gets

initiated

under

Hindu

Adoption

and

Maintenance Act.
59.

From these 5 plenary proceedings spring appeals

and revisions against interlocutory orders.
60.

Currently dealing with criminal matters I notice that

out of 10 fresh applications listed before me seeking bail or
anticipatory bail, 9 relate to matrimonial discords. My previous
roster allocation pertained to appeals, civil revisions and
petitions under Article 227 of the Constitution of India against
interlocutory orders passed by the Civil Judges.

2 out of 10

petitions pertained to interlocutory orders granting interim
maintenance under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act or
interim custody or visitation right pertaining to a minor child.
61.

Choked with matrimonial litigation it is but the

desire of every Judge to try and resolve the matter by amicable

multifarious litigation going to an end.

Energies of the citizens of India is better utilized if

the same is channelized for a constructive purpose and not

Mediation and Conciliation is being encouraged

world over for the reason, world over courts are being choked
on account of not only excessive litigation but, with the spread
of education, greatest awareness of rights by the citizens of the
States.

Order XXXII-A was introduced in the statute book.

Rule 3 thereof enjoins upon every court to endeavour,
wherever it is possible, to assist the parties in arriving at a
settlement where the dispute concerns a family.
65.

Rule 1 of Order XXXII-A encompasses every suit or

proceedings for matrimonial relief.
66.

Although a criminal case is seen as a dispute

between the offender and the State, it would be naïve to
assume that all offences actually concern the State. Quite a
few penal offences, eg. defamation, are of a civil nature.
67.

Several criminal proceedings are initiated with an

intention to bully the opposite party in a civil suit.

Judicial

opinions are replete with decisions where it is noted that
criminal proceedings are being pressed strictly with a view to
settle personal scores.

Compounding of offences, plea bargaining etc. are found in the
criminal justice delivery system in a large number of countries
including India.
69.

'Restorative justice' may be used as a synonym for

mediation. The object and nature of restorative justice aims at
restoring the interest of the victim. Involvement of the victim
in the settlement process is welcome in the process of
restorative justice. It is a process of voluntary negotiation and
concertation, directly or indirectly between the offender and
the victim.
70.

No doubt, while considering an application for grant

of anticipatory bail a court would functionally be exercising a
jurisdiction under a penal statute i.e. a criminal law,

but,

rooted in the said criminal litigation is essentially a matrimonial
discord i.e. a civil dispute.
71.

Thus, it cannot be argued that while dealing with an

application seeking bail or anticipatory bail arising out

of a

matrimonial dispute, a Court cannot encourage settlement
between the parties.
72.

Of course, the Judge has to be alive to the fact that

parties have only to be assisted by the Judge in the form of
councelling or ironing out the creases if otherwise major

substratum of the dispute is resolved by the parties and certain
issues are hampering the finalization of the settlement. Within
the afore-noted limited role, while dealing with an application
seeking bail or an anticipatory bail, pertaining to a matrimonial
dispute, the court concerned would not be outstepping its
jurisdiction if it plays a pro-active role.
73.

On the issue whether the FIR ought to have

registered an offence under Section 420 IPC and whether the
complainant was misled into compromise, oblivious of the fact
that her compromise encompassed the quashing of an offence
of cheating, no doubt, non-disclosure of the status a party at
the pre-marriage stage would be an act of deception for the
reason whether a party is a divorcee or not is a material fact
but the question would arise in the instant case, whether any
such deception existed.
74.

I need not elaborate on the issue save and except to

note the pleadings of Anu Gautam, in Crl.M.C. No.2111/2004.
In ground (h) she has pleaded that notwithstanding it was not
disclosed to her that Anupam Sharma was married, she was not
at all worried because of the said fact.
75.

It means that Anu Gautam was not concerned with

the status of her spouse.
Crl.M.C. Nos.3920/03 & 2111/04

Page No.24 of 26

76.

I may additionally note that it is not the case of Anu

Gautam that Anupam Sharma misrepresented to her or her
parents and claimed to be a bachelor when negotiations were
being held between the family members. No material has been
shown to me that Anu Gautam or her parents asked for the
status of Anupam Sharma i.e. whether he was a bachelor or
not, much less any material to show that Anupam Sharma
made a false statement about himself.
77.

It is apparent that Anu Gautam cannot retrace her

steps and resile from the settlement.
78.

Crl.M.C. No.2111/2004 is dismissed.

79.

In similar circumstances in Mohd.Shamim's case

(supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court quashed the FIR. Thus, Crl.M.C.
No.3920/2003 is disposed of directing petitioner to pay further
sum of Rs.2 lacs to Anu Gautam.

I quash FIR No.323/2002

under Section 498-A/406/34 IPC, PS Vikas Puri.
80.

Before concluding I may record that I have directed

Anupam Sharma to pay Rs.2 lacs to Anu Gautam for the reason
as per the settlement she has received Rs.3 lacs and
notwithstanding that her husband is prepared to pay her
further sum of Rs.2 lacs, she i.e. Anu Gautam did not receive
the said amount as she had resiled from the settlement
