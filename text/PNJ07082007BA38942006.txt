U/s498A/304B/34 IPC
P.S: Dabri.
Archana Devi was married to Rajesh Kumar Singh on

2.

Above captioned FIR was registered pursuant to

statement made by Ravinder Kumar Singh, father of Archana Devi
who stated that at the time of marriage of his daughter he gave
Rs.3 lacs in cash besides goods worth Rs. 1 lakh. That he spent
considerable amount on marriage of his daughter. That he had
also agreed to pay Rs.50,000/- to his son-in-law for purchasing a
motor cycle.

That when his daughter along with her husband

went to the native village at Naini, her mother-in-law, brother-inlaws, sister-in-laws and their children taunted his daughter for
bringing insufficient dowry.

That when mother-in-law of his

daughter was admitted for treatment at Army Hospital, the family
members taunted his daughter on 22.7.2006, asking for more
money to be brought by her from

Page 2 of 5
her father. That on said day her daughter was assaulted by all
aforenoted members of the family.

That on 17.9.2006 his

daughter telephoned him stating that she feared for her life. That
he told his daughter to stay calm as he would be coming to Delhi
during Durga Puja and would bring her back.

That on 21.9.2006

he received a telephone call from the landlord informing that his

Younger brother-in-law

In that view of the matter, there is no impediment in

disposing of bail application No.3798-99/2006 filed by the wife
and daughter of Shailesh Kumar Singh holding that since there
is no threat, much less any apprehension of they being arrested,
no further orders are required. Suffice would it be to state that in
the eventuality of any evidence surfacing against said 2 persons
at the trial before the learned Trial Judge and on orders passed by
the learned Judge directing that said 2 petitioners be arrayed as
accused, would a threat of arrest emanate. In said circumstances,
Manju Devi and Seema Kumari would have appropriate remedies
available to them.
6.

As regards Shailesh, Ram Dev, Lalmati, since challan

has been presented, the 3 have a right to file an appropriate
application before the learned Judge before whom challan has
been presented and thereupon would seek appropriate relief.
7.

Noting that Shailesh, Ram Dev and Lalmati have been

granted interim protection in the petitions filed by them, their
anticipatory bail applications are liable to be disposed of
Page 4 of 5
directing that interim protection granted by this court would
enure for their benefit for a period of 4 weeks from today. Within
said period of 4 weeks, said 3 persons would be entitled to move
appropriate applications seeking regular bail.
8.

The 3 captioned petitions stand disposed of as follows

:(a)

Bail Application No. 3798-99/2006 is disposed of as

infructuous but with the clarificatory observations in para 5
above.
(b)

Bail Application No.3894/2006 and Bail Application No.4601-

02/2006 stand disposed of extending interim protection granted
to the petitioners for a period of further 4 weeks reckoned with
effect from today.

Within said period of 4 weeks, petitioners

would move an appropriate application before the learned Trial
Judge before whom challan has been filed.

Needless to state,

decision would be taken by the learned Trial Judge, if at all a
regular bail application is filed, as per law.
9.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned counsel

for the petitioners.
