In this writ petition a cooperative group housing society

has sought directions to the respondent to provide individual
meters and permanent electricity connection to members of the
petitioner society.

W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 1 of 27

2.

The petitioner is a registered cooperative group housing

society which was registered in 1977. The very name itself shows
that the petitioner society is largely composed of physically
handicapped employees of the railway.

According to the

averments in the writ petition, 60% of the members of the society
are physically handicapped persons who belong to class III and
class IV of the Northern Zone Railways.
3.

It appears that the petitioner society had constructed

flats at Geeta Colony near Shastri Nagar. Apart from the petitioner
society, there were several other societies in the neighborhood
including the KAYMES Cooperative Group Housing Society,
SANMANYA CGHS Taj Sartaj CGHS and the Wakf Board which
had also raised construction in the neighborhood.

After

construction of flats, these societies had approached the then Delhi
Electricity Supply Undertaking (the predecessor in interest of the
erstwhile Delhi Vidyut Board).
The petitioner contends that it had requested for
electrification as back as in the year 1988.

The electrification

scheme of the petitioner society was duly cleared and a demand of
Rs.11,19,714/- was raised upon the petitioner for the purposes of
construction of an electric sub-station. This amount was deposited
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 2 of 27

as demanded on the 4th September, 1995. It is submitted that the
area earmarked for construction of the electric sub-station was
duly handed over and the sub-station constructed thereon soon
thereafter. Despite the huge amount having been deposited by the
petitioner society, no follow up action, either by the Delhi Electric
Supply Undertaking or by its successor in interest i.e. the Delhi
Vidyut Board was taken.
4.

In view of the non-action by the respondents, writ

petitions seeking appropriate reliefs were filed by the different
societies. It is necessary to notice certain order passed by the
Benches of this court in the petitions filed by the KAYMAS CGHS
and the SANMANYA CGHS before this court.
5.

An order dated 22nd March, 1993 was passed in civil writ

petition 41/1993 to the following effect :“We direct the DESU to erect switching station at
the site in question within five months fro today.
We further direct DESU to give to the petitioner
and other societies in the neighbourhood, who
would have served from the Switching Station,
when erected, temporary connection. This
temporary connection shall be given within one
week from today. Sub meters will be installed at the
cost of the petitioner within one week thereafter
because the electricity has not been supplied to the
petitioner and the other societies due to the fault of
the DESU. Even though we are ordering of the
temporary connection to be given the DESU shall
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 3 of 27

charge from the consumers the rate as if
permanent connections haves been given to them.”
Perusal of this order shows that the Delhi Electric
Supply Undertaking was given clear directions to give to the
petitioner in the writ petition and also to the other societies in the
neighborhood temporary electricity connections. The respondents
were directed to install sub-meters and the court recorded a
finding that electricity had not been supplied to the petitioner and
the other societies due to the fault of the Delhi Electricity Supply
Undertaking. In these circumstances, it was specifically directed
that even though the court was directing grant of temporary
connection, however the charges which could be charged by Delhi
Electricity Supply Undertaking from the consumer were to be at
the rate as if permanent connection had been given to them. The
Division Bench had clearly prohibited the respondents from
levying

temporary

electric

connection

charges

upon

the

consumers.
6.

It appears that matters did not end here.

The

respondents duly noted the entitlement of the present petitioner to
the benefits granted by the court in the order dated 22nd March,
1993 when Sh. M.N. Bali, Executive Engineer(PLG East) recorded
a noting on 2nd April, 1993 to the following effect :W.P.(C) 6432/1998

Despite the aforestated, the authorities failed to act in
terms of the order dated 22nd March, 1993.
7.

Even the electric sub-station was not constructed and

W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 5 of 27

matter again had to be placed before the court. On 7th September
1993, the Division Bench passed the following order in civil writ
2681/1992 :“ 7.9.1993
Present : Mr. S.K. Aggarwal, Sr. Adv. with
Mr. Sandeep Aggarwal for the
petitioner.
Mr. Vinod Kumar for DESU
Mr. Usha Kaumar for DDA
CM 2155/93 in CW 2681/92
A new site has been allotted to the
petitioner for construction of the sub-station.
According to Mr. Aggarwal, there are water and
sewage lines beneath the surface and, therefore, it
is not possible to construct a sub-station there.
Counsel for the respondent states that if
plans are filed, the same will be inspected by the
DDA and permission may be granted for changing
the water and sewage lines with the result that the
requisite sub-station can be constructed at the
additional site which has been allotted. The site
plans(revised) should be filed within a week and
the same shall be examined and if in order,
permission be granted within two weeks thereafter.
Alongwith the said site plans, the proposed building
plans should also be furnished to DDA and DESU.
DESU should also give their comments on the
building plans.
Separate meters should be affixed even
with respect to the temporary connection, which
meters will again be used when permanent
connection is theres. In respect of new meters,
applications may be made by all the flat owners
within two weeks and the meters shall thereupon
be installed, on the requisite charges being paid,
within four weeks thereafter. All formalities in
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

regard thereto will be completed by the petitioners.

September 7, 1993”
The court was once again reiterating its earlier directions
to instal the sub-meters against the respondents. This order is
dated 7th September, 1993.
8.

Again directions to energise the electricity to the

premises as well as installment of individual meters were made on
17th December, 1996 and 28th December, 1997 in civil writ
4207/1995 and it was directed as under :“ 17.12.1996: Present : Mr. B.T. Singh for the
petitioner
Mr. B.C. Pandey for
DESU
C.W. 4207 & C.M. 7071/95
Mr. Pandey states that the area has been
electrified in as much as the transformer has been
installed but the same cannot be energised on
account of non removal of deficiency by the
petitioner. Mr. Pandey further submits that vide
letters dated 6th November, 1996 and 3rd December,
1996 the petitioner society has been asked to do the
needful.
Mr. B.T. Singh prays for short
adjournment to look into the matter. If any
deficiencies are required tobe removed by the
petitioner it shall be done expeditiously so that the
electricity can be energised. The DESU shall in the
meantime ensure that individual meters are
installed in the flats. The members of the society
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 7 of 27

would, of course, complete all the formalities.xxxx”
“28.2.1997 Present : Mr. B.T. Singh for the
petitioner
Mr. Jayant Bhushan for
the respondent.
C.W. 4207 & C.M. 7071/95
On 17th December, 1996 this Court had
directed DESU to install individual meters in the
flats. Learned counsel for the parties submit that
only 18 individual meters remain to be installed.
Mr. Nath states that the same would be installed
within a period of one week. Regarding the grant of
permanent connection and energisation of the
transformer as noticed in the order dated 17
December, 1996. Mr. Nath states that the only
deficiency which now remains is about the size of
the meter boards. From the letters of DESU dated 6
November, 1996 and December, 1996 it appears
that the Board installed is marginally smaller than
the one required as per DESU specifications.
Having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case and regarding the
marginal deficiency in the specifications we direct
that on the boards of the specification already
installed, the DESU shall go ahead and energise the
transformer and grant permanent connection
within a period of two weeks.
Regarding excess payment said to have
been made by the petitioner in respect of which the
stand in the reply affidavit is that the petitioner
shall approach the concerned department for
refund, we direct that on petitioners filing the
applications/on writing a letter for the refund the
same shall be refunded, within four weeks of the
request for refund/application in accordance with
the rules and regulations of DESU.
Writ petition is disposed of accordingly.

28 February, 1997”
The petitioner has submitted that despite the orders
dated 2nd April, 1993 of the Executive Engineer and despite deposit
of full amount and completion of all formalities, the petitioner was
not given the benefit of the electric connection or the permanent
electric tariff.
9.

Reliance has been placed on the Office Order no. 2 dated

24th April, 1995 of the respondents in order to support the
submission that the petitioner society was entitled to the benefit of
the tariff and the slab system of computations of the dues of the
flat owners. The petitioner has pointed out that it was granted the
temporary electric connection of 15 KW through meter no. 76177
with effect from 1st October, 1994. It has been pointed out that
between January, 1995 to October, 1996, there was consumption of
about 1,44,280 units of electricity and an amount of Rs.3,89,416/was demanded for the same and deposited by the society. If the
tariff was applied as was applicable for permanent connection as
per the declared policy of the respondents, it could have been
required to deposit at the most a sum of Rs.1.6 lacs only.
10.

Again it has been pointed out that the respondents had

W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 9 of 27

raised a bill in November, 1998 against the petitioner society
claiming dues of Rs.8,50,676.83 upon the petitioner society for a
consumption of 14720 units of electricity. In this way, an amount
of Rs.2,17,148/- has been claimed on account of the surcharge on
account of the temporary connection alone The petitioner has
submitted that it has made full payment for grant of the
permanent electric connection. There are findings of the Division
Benches of this court that the delay and the fault is attributable to
the respondents who have failed to act in accordance with law and
there are directions existing as to why the charges payable for
temporary connection should not be levied upon consumers of the
societies. The petitioner has also pointed out that apart from the
policy letter dated 2nd April, 1995, the Delhi Vidyut Board in its
letter dated 17th August, 1995 had categorically informed the
petitioner that permanent tariff rate in respect of temporary
connection in the domestic category will be made applicable one
year after the receipt of full payments demanded. The demanded
payment

of

Rs.11,19,174/-

was

deposited

immediately on 7th September. 1995.

by

the

society

Vide a letter dated 9th

November, 1995, the society also notified the respondents that out
of a total of 74 flats, 62 flats had been duly occupied by individual
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 10 of 27

allottee. A list of the occupants alongwith the dates of occupancy
was duly furnished to the respondents. Copy of this letter has been
placed on record as Annexure 'P'. The respondent was repeatedly
requested to supply forms for applying for individual meter
connections for the 52 flats to enable these occupants to have
benefit of the slab rates. Revision of the bill to be raised by the
respondent on 25th September, 1995 for the period from
December, 1994 to September, 1995 in accordance with the orders
made by the court on 22nd March, 1993 was requested but no
action was taken by the respondent.
11.

In

these circumstances, the occupants installed

individual meters. The respondent commenced raising bills on
permanent tariff basis with effect from October, 1995 but refused
to give benefit of the slab system to the occupants and allottees of
the petitioner. On the contrary threat to disconnect electricity to
the society was held out.

The petitioner made request for

individual connection vide letters dated 8th/9th September, 1996,
29th January, 1996. Again details of 47 members with possession
slips, applicant details, inspection reports etc were furnished vide
letter dated 24th March, 1996, 23rd May, 1996, 17th June, 1996, 9th
September, 1996, 13th September, 1996, 9th October, 1996, 19th
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 11 of 27

March, 1996, 18th March, 1996 but the respondent failed to do
justice to the petitioner and the occupants of the flat.
12.

It is submitted that despite deposit of full amounts,

orders of the Division Bench with regard to construction and
electrification of the sub-station, and also grant of individual
connections, the respondents have delayed the matter and no
delay is attributable to the petitioners or the occupants and that
from September, 1995 onwards, 52 residents had occupied the flat
and are entitled to the benefit of the slab system.
13.

On these submissions, the petitioners have prayed for

the following reliefs in the writ petition.
“ato provide permanent electric connection
tot he society and occupants of flats on individual
basis and provide electric connection in respect of
each flat within one month from the date of the
order.
bdirect the respondent to work out the
dues payable by the society from January 1995
onwards on account of electricity consumed in
terms of office order no. 2 of 24.4.95 and give
adjustment to the petitioners in respect of excess
amount charged towards the demand for the future
period;
cto direct the respondent Board to work
out the demand for the period subsequent to
October 1996 on the basis of individual meter
connection and on the basis of permanent tariff and
then raise the bill.
dto direct the respondent to write off the
amount of Rs.2,17,148/- being claimed by way of
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 12 of 27

14.

levy of surcharge in view of the fact that there has
been no delay in payment of bill by the petitioners
since the bills were not being accepted by the
respondent board inspite of the repeated requests
which are born out of the record of the respondent
Board or its predecessor D.E.S.U.”
The writ petition has been opposed by the respondent on

the ground that so far prayers 'a' is concerned, the petitioner
society has been provided permanent electric connection to
occupants of flats on individual basis and electric connections to
each flat. It is further submitted that so far prayer 'd' is concerned,
vide orders dated 10th September, 2001 passed in the present writ
petition, the respondents were directed to work out the dues
payable by the society from January, 1995 onwards on account of
electricity consumed in terms of office order no. 2 dated 24th April,
1995 and adjustments was given to the petitioner in respect of he
excess amount charged towards the demand for the future period.
It is further submitted that so far as the demand for the period
subsequent October, 1996 is concerned, it is only such persons
who satisfy the requirement of the ration cards under office order
dated 24th April, 1995 that can be granted the benefit of the
permanent tariff and bills raised on such terms. The respondents
further contend that the amount levied as surcharge to the extent
of Rs.2,17,148/- cannot be impugned inasmuch as there was no
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 13 of 27

demand on the part of the society from 1996 except under orders
of this court.

It is contended that late payment surcharge is

leviable under the tariff, is statutory in nature and the petitioners
are bound to make payment thereof as per the counter affidavit
filed. According to the respondent the petitioner has submitted
only 29 copies of ration cards on 28th November, 1998 for levying
the slab benefit and accordingly the slab benefit has been allowed
to the society with effect from 28th November, 1998. A bill in this
respect is stated to have been served on the society on 5th February,
2000. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent also placed
strong reliance on its letter dated 11th June, 1996 and 15th
November, 1996 to contend that the permanent electric connection
could not be granted because of the fault of the petitioner and that
the petitioner society had failed to remove the defects which were
pointed out to it.
15.

I have considered the rival contentions. The points and

issues raised by the parties have been considered by the court in
the orders noticed hereinabove. So far as the defects stated to
have been pointed out on 11th June, 1996 and 5th November, 1996
are concerned, the same were considered by this court on the 17th
December, 1996 and 28th February, 1997. This court directed the
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 14 of 27

Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking vide order dated 28th
February, 1997 to energise and grant permanent connection within
the period of two weeks including the marginal deficiencies in the
specifications. The court also noticed the failure of the DESU to
install individual meters despite orders of this court in this behalf.
It is evident from the various orders set out hereinabove that the
respondent had failed to take steps for energising the permanent
electric connection to the petitioner society despite receipt of
heavy payment and completion of formalities.
16.

Both parties have placed heavy reliance on the office

order no. 2 dated 24th April, 1995 of the respondent. The material
terms thereof read as under :“1.

DATE OF APPLICABILITY:
The date of applicability of benefit of
permanent domestic rate on temporary connection
for bona fide residential use will be w.e.f. 28.1.94
(i.e. the date of issue of Office Order) and will be
effective after one year of deposit of full society's
payable share i.e. in case where the full payment
has been deposited on/upto 29.1.93, the benefit will
be available only w.e.f. 28.1.94.
2.
HOW TO ALLOW SLAB SYSTEM OF
PERMANENT DOMESTIC RATES:
The number of ration cards of the
occupants with the address of flat under
electrification scheme shall form the basis for
allowing the benefit of slab system. One ration card
per flat shall only be considered. This slab system
will be reviewed after every two months of the
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 15 of 27

release of connection. The society will submit the
copy of ration cards of the additional/new
occupants to AE (PS) concerned, who shall further
intimate AFO (D) for increase in number of slabs
equal to total number of ration cards received. The
society shall certify about continuing of residents of
which ration cards had been submitted earlier.
3.
DELAY
IN
EXECUTION
OF
ELECTRIFICATION SCHEME, AUTHORITY TO
ISSUE CERTIFICATE :
The cases where the delay in execution is
attributed to the society/DDA, registered showcause notice will be issued by XEN (Construction)
concerned to the society/DDA for removal of
deficiencies within two weeks. In case of noncompliances, the benefit of applicability of
permanent tariff rate will be deferred/suspended
till such time the deficiencies are removed. ACE
(T&D) concerned will be the nodal officer to decide
in case of dispute between the society and Constn.
Division regarding rectification of deficiencies etc.
After completion of electrification works,
AE (PS) will inform the society/DDA for advising
its members to avail the permanent connections.
After a period of two months of this intimation, the
temporary connection(s) shall be disconnected.”
17.

The

respondent's

main

submission

is

that

the

applicability of the benefit of the permanent domestic rate on
temporary connection was applicable after one year of deposit of
the societies entire share. It is further submitted that in view of
the fact that the payment was made only in

November,

1995, the society was entitled to the benefit of permanent domestic
rate only one year thereafter.

W.P.(C) 6432/1998

It is further submitted that the

page 16 of 27

requirement of submission of ration cards was essential for
computation on the slab system of permanent domestic rates.
Therefore, it is submitted that inasmuch as ration cards of 29
persons was given, therefore, the slab benefit was given to only
them on 28th November, 1998. But the petitioner's society again
claimed the benefit of the slab system in respect of all the
occupants.
18.

In this behalf, the petitioner has pointed out a letter

dated 26th February, 1997. List of all the persons and the date of
occupation of the flat was communicated therein. As per this list
of persons, 39 persons occupied their flats before 1st October, 1995.
The first occupant in this behalf had occupied the flat on 1st
November, 1994. Some of the submissions made by the petitioner
society to the respondent in this behalf in its letter of 26th
February, 1997 are extremely material which reads as hereunder :“3.
The Honourable judge also directed
DESU to install individual meters and charge the
bill as under :
“Even though we are ordering of
temporary connection to be given, the DESU will
charge from the consumers the rate as if
permanent connections have been given to them.”
The Hon-Judge also directed DESU to
give this facility to the neighbouring societies also.
Our society is nereby to Keymas(Geeta Apartment)
and Sanmaya (Kanchan Apartment).
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 17 of 27

We have deposited our share of
Rs.11,19,714/- towards our share towards the cost
of construction of ESS & Electrification of our site
on 4.9.95. The construction of Electric Sub-Station
has since been completed by DESU.
4.
The society has been requesting
XEN/KRN for installation of individual temporary
meters in
of High Court judgment since
8.1.96 despite reminders 29.1.96, 24.3.96, 23.5.96,
17..96, 9.8.96, 30.9.96 and 9.10.96. It is regretted
no response is coming in writing.
5.
At present 52 flats have been occupied
the date of occupation is shown in the attached
Annexure.
In view of the position explained above it
is requested that you may use your good office to
help the handicapped society as under :
1. Installation of individual meters.
2. Revision of Electric Bills.
3.Early
completion
of
ESS
&
Electrification scheme.”
19.

Despite the above communication, the petitioner

received no justice and was constrained to address repeated
communications in this behalf including letters dated 13th March,
1997. Perusal of this communication shows the manner in which
the respondent have treated the society of physically handicapped
persons.

Some of the material pleaded for mercy in this

connection reads as under :
“1.
That our society was registered as
Northern Zone Physically Handicapped Railway
Employees Co-operative Group Housing Society
in 1977 and even now is consisting of more than
60% handicapped members of belonging to
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 18 of 27

Category Class-III & IV.
2.
As a gesture of goodwill shown by
members all the 14 Ground Floor flats have been
allotted to handicapped members (lower limbs for
which special permission was granted by RCS &
DDA.
3.
On the basis of High Court Judgment
given in case no. CWPN 41/93 & CM 59/93 on
23.3.93 between Kaymes Society (Geeta
Apartments V/s DESU) (copy of judgment
attached at Annexure 'A'), our Society was
allowed two temporary connections of 15 KV for
domestic light nd 10 HP for domestic power for
boosting water on 12.10.94. The extract of High
Court Judgment is reproduced below :“We direct the DESU to erect
Switching Station at the site in
question within fives month from
today. We further direct DESU to
give the petitioner and other
Societies in the neighbourhood,
who would have served from the
Switching Station, when erected,
temporary connection.
This
temporary connection shall be
given within one week from today.
Sub-meters will be installed at the
cost of the petitioner within one
week thereafter because the
electricity has not been supplied to
the Petitioner and the other
societies due to he fault of the
DESU.
Even though we are
ordering
of
the
temporary
connection to be given the DESU
shall charge from the consumers
the rate as if permanent connection
have been given to them”.
4.
On the basis of High Court judgment,
individual temporary meters for each flat has
been installed by DESU in Kaymes Society (Geeta
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 19 of 27

Apartment & Sanmaya (Kanchan Apartment),
whereas this facility is being ignored and step
motherly treatment has been given to our Society.
It is pointed out that our society has approached
XEN/KRN on 9.11.95, 8/9.1.96, 29.1.96, 24.3.96,
23.5.96, 17.6.96, 9.8.96, 30.9.96, 9.10.06 &
26.2.97 to provide individual meters. It is
regretted that no communication from XEN/KRN
has been received so far to our letter cited above
even after lapse of one and a half year.
5.
It is pointed out that being a
handicapped member, myself, I had personally
visited XEN/KRN's office so many times and our
application forms have not been entertained due
to the reasons best known to them.
6.
The scheme for electrification of our
society site and construction of Electric SubStation was released on 17.8.95 and society has
already deposited its share of Rs.11,19,714/- on
4.9.95 as demanded by DESU.
This communication also did not deserve even a reply let
alone any favourable consideration. Yet further communications
and reminders were issued but of no avail.
20.

I may notice the pleas on behalf of the petitioner society

as were addressed to the chairman of the respondent on 21st July,
1987 which reads as under :“ 224/96-97/NZPH Dated 21.7.1997

HONY. SECY.”
Simultaneously the petitioner was pleading

with

the respondent to revise the bills and raise the correct bills keeping
in view the orders passed by the court in this behalf as well as the
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 21 of 27

delays caused by the respondent. Letters dated 4th September,
1997, 10th October, 1997 and 28th November, 1997 in this behalf
have been placed on record. The letter dated 28th November, 1997
sets out in detail as to the request of the petitioner for revision of
the electricity bills as well as installation of individual meters for
each flat in the society as per the directive of this court which are
being set out above.
21.

On the other hand, I notice that the first communication

placed on record whereby the respondent have sought ration cards
is dated 1st June, 1998. It is shocking, to say the least, that despite
court directives and repeated communications, the respondent
failed to take any action in the matter.
22.

The issues with regard to the submission of ration cards

came up for consideration in the present matter on the 10 th
September, 2001. On this issue the court has held as under :“ In my view, the stand of the respondent that
though the members of the petitioner society were
entitled to the benefit of the slab system but that
benefit can be given only to those persons who had
submitted their ration cards, is wholly unjustified.
Copy of the ration card is required only to verify the
genuineness of the members and since the
members were allotted flats after their entitlement
was verified not only by the Delhi Development
authority but also by the Registrar, Co-operative
Societies the respondent could not insist upon the
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 22 of 27

production of ration card by the members. No flat
could have been allotted to the members of the
society in case they were not bona fide members of
the society and since 52 members had already
occupied the flats after they were held entitled to be
allotted the flats, in my opinion, the respondent
ought to have given benefit of the slab system to all
these 52 persons without insisting upon the
production of ration cards by the occupants of the
flats.
I, accordingly, direct the respondent to
provide permanent electric connection to the
members and occupants of the flats of the society
and submit a revised bill working out the benefit of
slab system to 52 flat holders whose names were
forwarded by the society on 9th November, 1995.
The respondent will bring the revised bill in court
on the next date of hearing for each flat giving
benefit of the slab system. The respondent will
separately calculate late surcharge fee, if any,
payable after benefit of slab system is given to the
flat holders and bring the same also in court on the
next date of hearing. The question as to whether or
not the petitioner society would be entitled to the
relief claimed in Para D of the prayer clause or
whether they are not liable to pay late surcharges
fee, if any, will be considered on the next date of
hearing. In the meantime, the petitioner society is
directed to make payment of an amount of
Rs.2,00,000/- to the respondent within two weeks
from today. This order is without prejudice to the
rights and contentions of the parties.”
23.

Apart from the observations made in this order, it is to

be noticed that the petitioner society had informed the respondent
with regard to the occupancy of the flat, the dates on which the
flats were occupied and also given proof of occupation in terms of

W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 23 of 27

possession letters etc. It is the admitted case of the respondent
that individual meters were installed by it during the pendency of
the writ petition and after repeated court orders. Therefore, the
fact of occupation would have been physically verified by the
respondent when these meters were installed. Admittedly, there
has been gross dereliction of statutory duty and violation of the
rights of the society and its occupants to get the electricity
connections. Contributions made by members of the petitioner
society who were even physically handicapped persons were
deposited with the respondent who failed to take action
necessitating filing of writ petitions and running from pillar to
post. Communications from the petitioner do not seem to have
even

deserved

acknowledgment

and

answer,

let

alone

consideration in accordance with applicable rules. Court orders
received scant attention.
24.

It is also necessary to notice that procurement of ration

cards also requires completion of formalities.

It was also not

necessarily contemporaneous with occupancy of the flat and could
be time consuming.
25.

It is noteworthy that after approval of the site of electric

sub-station on 24th November, 1992, the respondent took 20
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 24 of 27

months in taking physical possession of the site from the petitioner
society inspite of several verbal and written requests. Finally, a
plot was taken over by the respondent on 1st August, 1994. After
taking possession of the land for construction of the electric substation, the respondent again slept over the matter and did not
bother to submit the estimate to the petitioner. Vide a letter of
22nd/27th March, 1995, the petitioner called upon the respondent to
give their estimate for construction of the electric sub-station. The
respondent took five months to provide the estimate of
Rs.11,19,174/- which was supplied only on 17th August, 1995.
Without any delay, the petitioner society deposited even this huge
amount on the 7th September, 1995. Despite receipt of the said
amount, the respondent have acted in the aforestated callous
manner.
26.

I may also note herein the communication addressed by

the respondent to the petitioner and the representation made in its
letter of 17th August, 1995 to the following effect.
“1.
Atleast 50% of the cost chargeable to you
at first instance and in such case the scheme shall
be released for tendering purpose only. The society
can, however, avail the facility of two temporary
connections; one for bonafide residential use and
the other for common services i.e. water pump, st.
ltg. Etc. The applicability of permanent tariff rate
W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 25 of 27

to temporary connection in domestic category will
be one year after the receipt of full payment and as
per provisions of C.E. (Comml.)'s O.O. No.
CO.II/Com.26/93-94/18 dated 28.1.94”
27.

It is noteworthy that the Division Bench had already

directed that the respondent would levy permanent domestic tariff
upon the flat owners for the faults of the respondent in respect of
the societies in question.
28.

In my view, therefore, the insistence on the ration cards

was unwarranted. The petitioner has orally submitted before me
that despite the orders of 10th September, 2001 as noticed
hereinabove, the respondents have till date not raised correct bills.
In this view of the matter, the members of the petitioner society
cannot be faulted for non-payment of bills raised in violation of
court orders and directives. The default of the respondent was
noticed by the court as back as on 22nd March, 1993, 7th September,
1996 and 28th February, 1997.

I find that the stand of the

respondent is not only contrary to law but is fully unreasonable in
the facts and circumstances of the aforedetailed.
29.

The petitioner have placed on record the computation of

the bills against them at pages 8 & 9 of the civil writ petition and
the rejoinder. The variation in the bill is computed on permanent

W.P.(C) 6432/1998

page 26 of 27

domestic tariff and the slab basis.
30.

It is, accordingly, directed that the respondent shall raise

bill upon the 52 flat holders whose names were forwarded by the
society on 9th November, 1995 giving the benefit of the slab system.
Such bills shall be raised in respect of the dues of the flats within a
period of four weeks from today. The respondent shall also give the
credit of the amounts directed to be paid and paid by the petitioner
society during the pendency of the writ petition in respect of the
bills raised.
31.

In view of my finding with regard to the default by the

respondent, it is held that the petitioner and its members shall not
be made liable to pay late payment surcharge on the billed
amount.
32.

The writ petition is allowed in the above terms. The

petitioner shall be entitled to costs of the petition which are
quantified at Rs.11,000/-
