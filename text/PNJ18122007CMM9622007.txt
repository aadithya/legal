PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
The petitioner has taken an exception to the order

dated 12.1.2007 disposing of respondent's application under
Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.
2.

The order is prolix.

It runs into 22 pages.

I had

noted similar orders being passed by the Judge concerned and
had set aside a few orders directing that the issue should be
decided with focus and with reference to the pleadings of the
parties and prima facie material brought on record to sustain or
support the alleged income of the opposite spouse.

In spite
page 1 of 6

thereof, I note that repetitive cut and paste orders are
continued to be passed.
3.

In the instant case, the husband alleged that the

wife was running a beauty parlour under the name and style
'M/s. ROMA Beauty Parlour'. The wife denied the same. Qua
the husband, the wife alleged that he was running a STD Booth
wherefrom business of sale and purchase of mobile phones and
accessories was also being conducted by him. Additionally, the
wife alleged that the husband was helping his father in some
dental business. She alleged that her husband was having a
monthly income of Rs.25,000/-.
4.

The impugned order notes the respective stands of

the parties in the first four pages thereof. From page No.5 till
page No.18 a plethora of judgments have been noted. Some
legal principles have been culled out.
5.

The conclusions commence from page 18 onwards

and terminates on page No.22.
6.

Inchoate and contradictory findings have been

arrived at.
7.

In para 18 it is recorded by the learned Matrimonial

Judge that it is revealed to him that the wife is having no source
of income and that her husband has made no provisions for
her. In the next paragraphs i.e. para 29 the learned Judge has
page 2 of 6

opined that the husband was prima facie running a STD Booth
wherefrom mobile phone and accessories were being sold by
him and it could reasonably be estimated that his monthly
income from said business was Rs.10,000/-. In same paragraph
it has been opined that from the assistance given by the
husband to his father pertaining to the dental clinic it could be
assumed that the husband would be having an income of
Rs.25,000/- per month.
8.

But, in total contradictions to what has been

recorded in para 28 pertaining to the income of the wife, in
para 31, the learned Judge has recorded that it is revealed to
him that the wife was a qualified beautician and was running a
beauty parlour in the name and style 'M/s. ROMA Beauty
Parlour' wherefrom she was earning Rs.5,000/- per month.
Thereafter, in para 32 the same findings as have been noted in
para 29 pertaining to the income of the husband have been
reiterated. In para 33 once again, income of the wife which has
been recorded in para 31 has been opined to be the income of
the wife.

But in the same paragraph the learned Judge has

noted that one spouse is exaggerating the income and the
other is understating the same.
9.

Who

was

exaggerating

what

and

who

was

understating what has not been recorded.

10.

After opining conclusively in para 29, reiterated in

para 31 that the income of the husband was Rs.10,000/- per
month from the business of the STD Booth and sale of mobile
phone and accessories and that his income was Rs.25,000/- per
month while assisting his father in the dental clinic, in para 34
the learned Judge has opined that he treats the monthly income
of the husband to be Rs.10,000/-.
11.

Maintenance of Rs.6,000/- per month has been

awarded to the wife who I note is having the custody of two
minor children with her.
12.

I am unable to gather the rationale of the decision.

13.

Is the learned Judge treating the income of the

husband at Rs.10,000/- per month or is it Rs.25,000/- per
month or is it Rs.35,000/- per month.
14.

The orders reveals nothing.

15.

As regards the wife, the order does not clarify

whether the learned Judge is treating that she is having no
income from the business of a beauty parlour or is it that the
learned Judge has treated the income of the wife to be
Rs.5,000/- per month from the business of the stated beauty
parlour.
16.

Since the order has changed tracks repeatedly, as

noted above, I hold that the order does not conform to the
page 4 of 6

requirements of a reasoned decision.
17.

I set aside the impugned order dated 12.1.2007. I

restore the application filed by the wife under Section 24 of the
Hindu Marriage Act.
18.

The

learned

Trial

Judge

would

redecide

the

application by focusing on the issue of the income of the
respective spouse as alleged and prima facie made good with
reference to material brought on record.
19.

Before concluding I may note than as in the instant

case, in virtually every case relating to interim maintenance,
pleadings of the parties are vague.

Exaggerated claims are

made without any basis.
20.

Noting that tax avoidance is the norm followed by

the vast majority of the self employed people in this country
and tax compliance is being followed by the minority, counsel
would be better advised to make specific pleadings relating to
the social status enjoyed by the family and especially when the
husband and wife were in consortium. The school in which the
children were put; the monthly fees which the husband was
paying to the school; whether the family was holidaying and if
yes at what place; what was the social interaction of the couple
with their friends; all could constitute good material wherefrom,
with a firm footing, income of the spouses could be gathered.

21.

The learned Trial Judge is directed to redecide the

matter within 2 months from date of receipt of the instant
order.
22.

No costs.
