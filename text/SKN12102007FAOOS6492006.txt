SANJIV KHANNA, J:
1.

The present appeal is directed against the Order dated 29

th

August, 2006 passed by the learned Single Judge restraining the

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 2

appellant-M/s. Yog Systems India Limited from encashing the bank
guarantee and confirming ex-parte ad-interim injunction dated 6

th

July, 2006 till disposal of the suit. The said suit has been filed by the
respondent-M/s.Su-Kam Power Systems Limited. Learned Single
Judge accepted the case of the respondent that the appellant had
played fraud

inasmuch as he had attempted to invoke the bank

guarantee on a false pretext without supplying the goods.
2.

th

On 26 May, 2006, the appellant had sent quotation to the

respondent for supply of 5000 transformers. The quotation records
that the supply would be made on Free on Board basis at Baddi,
Himachal Pradesh within one week from the date of the purchase
order. The place of delivery mentioned in the purchase order was
Baddi, Himachal Pradesh, where the factory of the respondent is
located. It is further stated in the quotation that local transport at
Baddi, Himachal Pradesh would be on buyer's account. The
quotation required that payment for the material shall be made within
7 days and secured against a bank guarantee.
3.

Thereafter, a purchase order dated 26

th

May, 2006 was

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 3

placed on the appellant by the respondent for supply of 5000
transformers on various dates stipulated therein. The supply order
specifically mentions that the delivery was to be made at Baddi,
Himachal Pradesh and mode and time of payment was stipulated as
against delivery. The total value of the supply order was
Rs.57,20,000/-.

There is also another Purchase Order dated 26

th

May, 2006 for the same number of transformers i.e. 5000 pieces, for
the same value. The said Purchase Order, however, in supplier's
th

reference refers to Rev-01 dated 12 June, 2006. As per the said
Purchase Order delivery was to be made at Baddi, Himachal
Pradesh and the mode and terms of payment as stipulated required
payment within ten days from the date of lorry receipt.
4.

th

A bank guarantee dated 26 May, 2006 for Rs.60,00,000/-

was issued by Standard Chartered Bank at the request of the
respondent in favour of the appellant. The said bank agreed to pay to
the appellant in case of default, refusal, denial, disputes raised due to
failure of the buyer to make the payment as per agreed terms. The
relevant recital in the bank guarantee reads as under:-

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 4

“WHEREAS M/s Yog Systems India
Ltd. having its Registered office at DELHI at
4A, Ramchandra Lane, Civil Lines, Delhi –

the request of the Buyer we Standard
Chartered Bank, H-2, Connaught Place,
New Delhi-110001 (hereinafter referred to as
“THE BANK”) have agreed to issue a
guarantee in favour of the Seller.”

5.

th

It is the case of the appellant that on 12 June, 2006 , 600

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 5

pieces of transformers for value of Rs. 7,13,856/- were dispatched to
the respondent for delivery at Baddi, Himachal Pradesh. Invoice
th

dated 12 June 2006 was issued and terms of delivery was stated as
direct. These goods were dispatched through Jai Kisan Tempo
Transport Association. A lorry receipt (GR) consignment note dated
th

12 June, 2006 was also executed and has been enclosed by the
appellant in the present Appeal.
6.

The appellant raised a Bill of Exchange of Rs. 7,13,856/-

being the value of the goods stating, inter alia, that the said amount
was payable by the respondent within ten days from the date of the
lorry receipt i.e. 22

nd

June, 2006. It was requested that the said

payment be made by the respondent in the name of Canara Bank,
the designated bankers of the appellant-M/s. Yog Systems India Ltd.
7.

nd

On 22 June, 2006, the respondent replied to Canara Bank

stating that they cannot accept the Bill of Exchange as the material
had not been supplied and it appears that the said Bill of Exchange
had been issued erroneously. Another letter with similar averments
rd

was issued on 23 June, 2006. In this letter it was also stated that the

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 6

respondent had investigated into the matter and the transporter had
confirmed that the material was lying with them due to breakdown of
the vehicle. The bank was asked to submit the documents after the
goods were received and accepted.
8.

th

Canara Bank vide letter dated 24 June, 2006 informed the

respondent that payment in terms of the Bill of Exchange was due
and, therefore, should be made.
9.

th

It may be stated here that on 20 June,2006 the appellant had

made supply of 382 transformers, for which payment was made by
the respondent.
10.

th

On 5 July, 2006 the appellant invoked the bank guarantee

and asked the Standard Chartered Bank to make payment of
Rs.60,00,000/-.
11.

th

On 7 July, 2006, the respondent protested pointing out the

correspondence that was exchanged between the parties and
claimed that the bank guarantee had been fraudulently invoked and
stated that the Purchase Order stood cancelled with effect from 24

th

June, 2006. It was reiterated that the material had not been received

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 7

and, therefore, the payment was not due.
12.

Before the bank paid any amount the respondent filed a

civil suit being CS(OS) No.1368/2006 against the appellant and the
Standard Chartered Bank along with an application for interim
th

injunction. By an ex-parte Order dated 6 July, 2006, a restraint order
was passed against the appellant and the respondent-Bank from
encashing the bank guarantee. The appellant appeared in the suit
and filed it's written statement and reply to the application for interim
injunction.
13.

th

On 4 August, 2006, the Court recorded the statements of

Mr. Parakh Gupta, Director of the appellant and one Mr.Bir Singh,
sole proprietor of Jai Kisan Tempo Transport Association, who had
issued the lorry receipt. The statements are relevant for deciding the
present Appeal and are reproduced below :“STATEMENT OF SHRI BIR SINGH , S/O SHRI
MANGE RAM, R/O J-164, SECTOR-41, NOIDA
(U.P.) ON S.A.
CS (OS) No. 1368/2001
I am the sole proprietor of Jai Kisan Tempo
Transport Association. Ex.P-1 was faxed by my

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 8

employee Rajesh to SuKam Power Systems Ltd.
The fax was transmitted from a PCO nearby my
office at Hosiery Complex, NOIDA. The fax
message was sent because some information
was sought by Su-Kam company. One Mr.
Sabharwal had rung up from Su-Kam company.
The goods entrusted to us by Yog Systems India
Ltd., reference whereof has been made in Ex.P1, are lying at Karnal. We had informed the
defendant that the consignment is lying at Karnal.
Information to this effect was given by us to the
defendant on or about 24.6.2006. Defendant has
told me to keep the goods at Karnal till further
instructions.”

“STATEMENT OF SHRI PARAKH GUPTA,
S/SHRI Y.K. GUPTA, R/O 4, RAMCHANDRA
LANE, CIVIL LINES, DELHI ON S.A.
I am a director on the Board of defendant
No. 1. I have brought along with me in court
today Shri Bir Singh who is known to me and I
identify him. Ex.P-1 was not faxed by us to the
plaintiff. I had seen Ex.P-1 for the first time on
23.6.2006 in the office of the plaintiff at Guargaon
as I had gone there in connection with the
purchase orders and the payment. I had asked
Jai Kisan Tempo Transport Assn. as to why
goods in question entrusted to it as a carrier were
not delivered. Mr. Bir Singh told me that the
tempo carrying the goods had broken down.
Letter Ex.P-2 was received by me personally.
Q. In what context plaintiff wrote letter Ex.P-2?
Ans. Su-Kam wanted the bills to be submitted

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 9

again for payment. At my asking Ex.P-2 was
written by the plaintiff to my banker.
It is correct that the written statement filed
by defendant No. 1 has been verified on
22.7.2006. I have signed and verified the written
statement.
Q. You have just admitted that on 23.6.2006 it
came to your knowledge that the carrier to whom
you entrusted the goods for delivery to the
plaintiff did not deliver the goods to plaintiff and
that it came to your knowledge that goods are
lying in Karnal. Why have you not disclosed this
fact in the written statement and what is the basis
on which you have pleaded that having supplied
600 transformers became due and payable on
22.6.2006. What do you have to say in respect
of your pleadings mark 'A' to 'A' in para II of the
preliminary objections.
Ans.
I have no explanation to furnish”.

14.

Mr. Parakh Gupta admitted in his statement that on 23

June, 2006 he came to know that the goods given to

rd

Jai Kisan

Tempo Transport Association had not been delivered to the
respondent and were lying at Karnal. This fact however was not
mentioned in the written statement filed by the appellant. On being
confronted why this fact had not been mentioned in the written
statement, Mr. Parakh Gupta stated that he had no explanation to

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 10

give. Mr. Bir Singh in his statement admitted that he had sent fax
rd

dated 23 June, 2006 to the respondent that due to breakdown of the
vehicle, goods despatched by the appellant vide receipt dated 12

th

June, 2006 had to be unloaded. It would take some time to repair the
vehicle and therefore the goods had not been delivered for which
they were sorry. Mr. Bir Singh also stated that the goods were lying
at Karnal. He admitted that similar information was given on the next
th

date i.e. 24 June, 2006 to the appellant. Thus he confirmed the fact
that the appellant was aware that the goods had not been delivered
to the respondent. However, the last sentence in the statement of
Mr. Bir Singh is most crucial. The appellant had directed Mr. Bir
Singh to keep the goods at Karnal till further instructions. Thus, it is a
clear admission that the appellant had asked the transporter not to
deliver the goods to the respondent. Even otherwise it is
inconceivable that it would take more than 10 days to repair a vehicle
and the transporter would not have informed the appellant. It is also
difficult to conceive that the transporter could not have made alternative
arrangements for delivery. Prima facie,

the

goods were

deliberately

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 11

not delivered to the respondent and this was at the behest and on
instructions of the appellant.
15.

The statements made by the Director of the appellant and

Mr. Bir Singh virtually take out the fire and fundus behind the
argument of Mr. P.N. Lekhi, the learned senior counsel for the
appellant, relying upon Sections 19, 20, 23 and 39 of the Sale of
Goods Act, 1968, on the basis that the contract in question was a
FOB contract. It was submitted that in a FOB contract, title in the
goods passes on to the buyer (i.e. in the present case to the
respondent) once the goods were handed over to the carrier, i.e. Jai
Kisan Tempo Transport Association. If this contention of the
appellant is to be accepted, then the conduct of the appellant and the
direction given by the appellant

to

Jai Kisan Tempo Transport

Association to keep the goods at Karnal till further instructions
amounted to misappropriation of goods by the appellant, though title
had already passed on to the respondent. It will amount to fraud as
understood in law. It is, therefore, apparent and clear that the goods
were retained at Karnal and not transported and delivered to the

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 12

respondent at Baddi, Himachal Pradesh by the transporter- Jai Kisan
Tempo Transport Association, on instructions given by the appellant.
Learned Single Judge was therefore right in holding that a prima
facie case of fraud had been made out. The plea of the appellant that
the goods were appropriated to the account of the respondent, on
delivery to the common carrier as the contract was a FOB contract
are aspects on which we cannot give any final or conclusive opinion.
The said stand of the appellant is contradicted by his conduct and
statement of the appellant that the common carrier was asked by the
appellant-seller not to deliver the goods to the respondent.

The

question whether appropriation of goods had taken place depends
upon the intention of the parties. When a seller exercises right of
disposal or where a seller agrees to deliver goods at their destination,
the carrier is the seller's agent and delivery to the carrier is not a final
appropriation. (See in this regard observations of the Supreme Court
in Mahabir Commercial Company Limited versus CID, West
Bengal, Calcutta, reported in 1972 (2) SCC 704.)
16.

Learned Single Judge has quoted para 2 of the preliminary

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 13

objections in the written statement filed by the appellant. When the
said paragraph is contrasted and compared with the statement made
by Mr. Parakh Gupta on oath before the Court, it is apparent that the
appellant wanted to conceal facts from the Court and had made
wrong averments in the written statement that the goods had been
supplied, yet payment was not made justifying invocation of the bank
guarantee. The appellant was fully aware that the goods were lying
at Karnal and as per the transporter the goods were directed to be
kept at Karnal till further instructions from the appellant.

The

transporter had been asked by the appellant not to supply goods to
the respondent.
17.

In view of the above prima facie findings, we are not

examining the Sections of the Sale of Goods Act, 1968 in detail. We
may, however, state that it is the case of the respondent that the
contract in question is not a FOB contract. It was argued on behalf of
the respondent that the said term finds mention in the quotation but
was not mentioned in the Purchase Orders. It was also stated that
the place of delivery as specified even in the quotation was Baddi,

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 14

Himachal Pradesh and only local transportation was on buyer's
account.
18.

In the written synopsis filed by the appellant it is admitted

that it had asked the transporter to hold the goods at Karnal i.e. at
the place of break down of the goods vehicle. Thus, it is admitted in
the written submission that the goods vehicle by which 600
transformers were being supplied to the respondent had broken
down at Karnal and the goods had not been delivered to the
respondent on instructions of the appellant. It is stated that the
appellant was justified in instructing the transporter as the respondent
had cancelled the contract. The contract was cancelled by the
respondent on 24

th

June,2006 but before the said date 382

transformers were supplied by the appellant and the respondent had
made payment. Moreover, the above statement in the written
submissions is contrary to the averments and the stand taken in the
written statement filed before the learned Single Judge and even the
stand taken in the grounds of appeal. In preliminary objection V in
the written statement, the appellant has stated as under:-

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 15

“That the Plaintiffs have filed the above suit for
mala fide intentions and for ulterior motives in
order to avoid the contract and avoid the
payment to the Defendant No. 1 in respect of
the supplies made by him.
A sum of
Rs.7,13,856/- had become due to the
nd
Defendant No. 1 on 22 June, 2006. The
Plaintiffs have not made any payment
whatsoever in respect of the said supply. On
the one hand, the Plaintiffs engaged the
Defendant No. 1 and its bankers and asked for
re-submission of the Bill of Exchange and, on
th
the other hand, on 24 June, 2006, wrongly
and illegally sought to revoke the Purchase
Order on wholly flimsy grounds.”
19.

Similarly, in preliminary objection VI it is stated that the

respondent herein was not making payment in respect of the supplies
already made. The preliminary objection No. VI reads:“Since the Plaintiffs are not making the
payment in respect of the supplies already
made and also unilaterally revoking the order
and are not willing to accept the goods
manufactured for them, the Defendant No. 1
has incurred huge loss.”
20.

In reply to paragraph 11 of the plaint, on merits it is stated

that the parties had orally agreed that 600 pieces of transformers
th

would be delivered on 12 June, 2006 itself and the balance 4400

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 16

pieces of transformers would be supplied after about a week i.e. from
th

th

19 -20 June, 2006 and the entire order would be completed within
th

4-5 days after 20 June, 2006. It is further stated that these broad
oral terms were accepted, but were not reproduced in writing as the
parties did not feel the necessity of having a formal agreement.
21.

There is no averment in the written statement about break

down of vehicle at Karnal and/or any direction by the appellant herein
to the transporter not to deliver the goods to the respondent because
of cancellation of the contract.
22.

In the grounds of appeal, the appellant has distinctly shifted

it's stand as statement of the Director of the appellant and the
transporter had been recorded before the learned Single Judge. In
th

paragraph 12 of grounds of appeal, it is stated that on 24 June,
2006 the transporter sought to deliver the goods to the respondent
No. 1, but the said respondent refused to take/accept delivery on the
ground that the purchase order stands cancelled. It is further alleged
that thereafter the transporter contacted the appellant for return of
goods, who refused to take delivery of the returned goods. Mr. Bir

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 17

Singh has not made any such statement nor any such averment has
been made in the written statement. The constant shift in the stand
taken by the appellant is a pointer towards fraud. The appellant has
even tried to conceal facts from the Court and when confronted
sought to change and alter its stand but the declension is apparent.
23. Courts normally do not grant injunction against invocation of bank
guaranties/letters of credit. A bank guarantee or a letter of credit is
regarded as an independent and a separate contract between the
bank and the beneficiary and disputes between the two contractual
parties in the underlying/principal contract regardless of the merits,
cannot be a ground for issue of an injunction order. However, the
above general rule is subject to some exceptions. Two well-known
exceptions being fraud of egregious nature, which would vitiate the
very foundation of the bank guarantee/letter of credit and when a
beneficiary seeks to take advantage of his own fraud. The second
ground being irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties.
(Refer recent decision of the Supreme Court in Himadri Chemicals
Industries Limited versus Coal Tar Refining Company , reported

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 18

in 2007 (9) Scale 631, wherein earlier case law has been extensively
considered and principles have been elucidated).
24.

In the present case, we are concerned with the first

exception. Fraud can vitiate any contract or even the most solemn
proceedings in a civilised society. One who indulges in an act of
deceit or trickery,

seeks to undermine rule of law in a civilised

society. In Webster's New International Dictionary, “fraud” has been
defined as an act or omission to act, concealment by which one
person obtains advantage over the other.

In Black's Legal

Dictionary, “fraud” has been defined as intentional perversion of truth
for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it, to part with
valuable thing or surrender a legal right. Fraud may be by words or
by conduct or by concealment or by making false or misleading
allegations, when such conduct is intended to deceive another
person.

Bad faith and fraud are synonyms. It includes false

statement, suppression of truth etc. with the purpose of deceiving
and gaining advantage over another. A false representation or
deception to gain unjust advantage, dishonest artifice or trick

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

amounts to fraud.

Page 19

Section 17 of the Contract Act,1872 defines

“fraud”as
“17. raud
F
defined . raud
F
means
and includes any of the following
acts committed by a party to a
contract, or with his connivance, or
by his agent, with intent to deceive
another party thereto or his agent,
or to induce him to enter into the
contract
(1) the suggestion, as a fact, of that
which is not true, by one who does
not believe it to be true;
(2) the active concealment of a fact
by one having knowledge or belief
of the fact;
(3) a promise made without any
intention of performing it;
(4)any other act fitted to deceive;
(5) any such act or omission as the
law specially declares to be
fraudulent.”

25.

For grant of temporary injunction, fraud should be of

egregious nature, i.e. clear and apparent. The facts stated above

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 20

and the conduct of the appellant prima facie establishes fraud of
egregious nature. The present case cannot be regarded as one of
mere allegation of fraud, but one in which it has been sufficiently
established for the purpose of grant of interim injunction.

The

appellant was aware that the documents had been presented for
payment in respect of goods, which had been directed by them to be
detained at Karnal till further orders. The appellant seeks to gain
advantage of his own wrong. The fact that the goods were detained
at Karnal and physical delivery was not made to the respondent,
though vaguely denied in the written statement by the appellant,
stands admitted in the grounds of appeal and written submissions
filed before us and the statement of the transporter and the Director
of the appellant recorded before the learned Single Judge.
26.

We may refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal in

Edward Owen Engineering Limited versus Barclays Bank
International Limited, reported in (1978) 1 All England Law Reports
976. In the said case, reference was made to an earlier decision in
the case of Sztejn versus J. Henry Schroder Banking Corpn.,

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 21

reported in (1941) 31 NY SUPP 2d 631, wherein the seller had
intentionally failed to ship the goods ordered. When the situation and
the fraud was brought to court's knowledge/attention, the court
granted injunction from encashment of letter of credit to protect the
buyer against the unscrupulous seller. In the said case, the English
Court held that the bank ought not to pay, when it sees that the
documents are forged or request for payment is made fraudulently in
the circumstances when there is no right to payment. Bank is entitled
to refuse payment if it finds out before payment that the beneficiary
has committed a fraud or has acted fraudulently. We have referred
to the correspondence between the respondent and the bank.
Payment is yet to be made by the bank. The bank is also a party to
the proceedings before the learned Single Judge and this Court.
27.

In view of the above facts, we do not find any merit in the

present appeal and the same is dismissed.

It is clarified that the

observations and findings in the impugned Order and the present
Order are for the purpose of deciding the interim application and the
suit will be decided on the basis of evidence led by the parties

FAO (OS) No. 649 OF 2006

Page 22

without being influenced by the aforesaid observations and findings.
No costs.
