ANIL KUMAR, J.(Oral)

1.

This is a petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act, 1996 for the appointment of an arbitrator.

2.

The contention of the petitioner is that respondent No.1 is a

AA No.177/2003

Page 1 of 1

society which had invited bids and had floated a notice inviting
tenders. The petitioner had submitted the bid and its bid was
accepted for the construction and Development in 490 dwelling units
for External Sewerage, Water Supply, Roads and Storm Water Drains
at Plot No.40, Sector 13, Rohini, New Delhi. An agreement dated 6th
May, 1998 was also executed between the petitioner and the
respondent No.1. A separate agreement was executed for construction
490 dwelling units.

3.

According to the petitioner the work for construction of 490

dwelling units was also awarded on 26th February 1988 and that as
on 12th February, 1999 the external development work in respect of
sewerage and water supply lines was completed up to almost 100%,
however, the work of 70 flats could not be completed as the drawings
for the 70 flats were provided only in February, 1999 on account of
change of original design of isolated footing to raft foundation because
of soil condition. The petitioner further stated that the external
development work was also completed by the petitioner except for
roads and storm water drains. As per the petitioner the reason for non
completion of work was because of the acts attributable to the
respondents as the drawings and designs and also the decisions were
not communicated by the architect of the respondents to the
petitioner as a result of which the petitioner was prevented from

AA No.177/2003

Page 2 of 1

completing the work within a stipulated time. Thereafter a show cause
notice dated 23rd December, 1999 issued by the respondents was
served on the petitioner which notice was duly replied by the
petitioner by its letter dated 27th December, 1999 in which the
petitioner, invoking clause 6.54 of the arbitration agreement and
sought

appointment of the arbitrator by the respondents. Despite

this on 18th January, 2000 the work was rescinded by the respondent
no.2, administrator. Aggrieved by the rescission of the work by the
respondents the petitioner approached this court for appointment of
an arbitrator by AA no.40/2000 and an arbitrator, Sh.Y.D. Nagar, was
appointed by this Court. The arbitrator passed an interim award
dated 4th June, 2003 holding that the recession dated 18 th January,
2000 as illegal. Pursuant to the interim award the petitioner was reinducted in the project/works.

4.

According to the petitioner despite re-induction there were

breach of contractual obligations and no periodical payments were
being made to the petitioner.

5.

The petitioner has contended that the disputes and differences

which has arisen between the parties as a result of breach can be
decided by an Arbitrator in terms of clause 6.54 of the agreement
between the parties. Clause 6.54 of the arbitration agreement is as

AA No.177/2003

Page 3 of 1

under:“6.54: ARBITRATION
SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BY ARBITRATOR
Except where otherwise provided in the contract all
questions and disputes relating to the meaning of the
specifications, designs, drawings and instructions
hereinbefore mentioned and as to the quality of
workmanship or materials used on the work or as to any
other questions. Claim right matter or thing whatsoever
in any way arising out of or relating to the contract or the
execution or failure to execute the same whether arising
during the progress of the work or after the completion or
abandonment thereof shall be referred to the arbitration
of the person appointed by the employer. There will be no
objection to any such appointment that the arbitrator so
appointed is a government servant/or employer and that
he has to deal with the matter to which the contract
relates and in the course of his duties he had expressed
views on all or any of the matters in dispute or difference.
The arbitrator to whom the matter is originally referred
being transferred on vacating his office or being unable to
act for any reason, employer on the basis of stipulations
as aforesaid at the time of such transfer, vacation or
inability to act, shall appoint another person to act as
arbitrator in accordance with the terms of the contract
such person shall be entitled to proceed with the
reference from the stage at which it was left by his
predecessor. in all cases where the amount of the claim
in dispute is rs.50,000/- and above. The arbitrator shall
give reason for award.
Subject as aforesaid the provisions of the arbitration act,
1940 or any statutory modification or reenactment
thereof and the rules made there under and for the time
being in force shall apply to the arbitration proceedings
under this clause.
It is also a term of the contract that the party involving
arbitration shall specify that dispute or disputes to be
referred to arbitration under this clause together with the
amount or amounts claimed in respect of each such
dispute.
It is also a term of the contract that if the contractor does
AA No.177/2003

Page 4 of 1

not make any demand for arbitration in respect of any
claim in writing within 30 days of receiving the intimation
from the employer when the bill has been certified for
payment the claim of the contractor will deemed to have
been waived absolutely and the employer shall be
discharged and released of all the liability and released of
all liabilities under the contract in respect of his claims.
the arbitrator may from time to time issue orders and
publish the award.

6.

Since the disputes have arisen, the petitioner prayed for

appointment of an arbitrator for adjudication of disputes which have
arisen between the parties. The petitioner had sought appointment of
arbitrator by letter dated 28th June, 2003, however, within 30 days of
the demand being raised for appointment of the arbitrator and before
the filing of the petition, the respondent No.1 failed to appoint an
arbitrator and thus the respondents lost their right to appoint an
arbitrator in terms of clause 6.54 of the agreement.

7.

The application is contested by the respondents contending

inter-alia that Sh.S.S. Aggarwal, Engineer, was appointed as a sole
arbitrator by the respondents in terms of a letter of appointment
dated 22nd October, 2003 who has proceeded with the arbitration
proceedings and number of hearings has already been held with
notice to the petitioners.

AA No.177/2003

8.

The respondents have also contended that no confidence could

be reposed in Sh.Y.D.Nagar, as the interim award passed by the said
sole arbitrator is already under challenge. The allegation of the
petitioner that the respondents’ society failed in its obligation under
the contract was denied. It was contended that the petitioner is
exploiting the respondent society and its member and extracting
money without doing the construction work and discharging its own
obligation and there has not been any breach of agreement on the
part of the respondent society. The respondents also contended that
letters dated 18.6.2003 and 28.6.2003 do not appear to have been
received by the respondents and, therefore, the respondent No.2 could
not appoint an arbitrator and since now an arbitrator has been
appointed who is holding the arbitration proceedings in accordance
with law, it will not be just and appropriate to appoint another
arbitrator. It is also contended that since the award rendered by
Mr.Y.D.Nagar is already under challenge, therefore, the said person
cannot be appointed as an arbitrator.

9.

This is not disputed that there has been an arbitration

agreement between the parties. Though the respondents have denied
that the letter dated 28.6.2003 demanding the respondents to appoint
an arbitrator was received, however, the postal receipt shows that the
registered article was sent in the ordinary course on 30.6.2003. This

AA No.177/2003

Page 6 of 1

postal receipt has not been denied nor such facts have been disclosed
which will rebut the presumption of service which arises in the facts
and circumstances. The respondents have also not produced anything
to show as to how they could appoint an arbitrator without giving
notice to the petitioner and how they could appoint Sh. Sh.SS
Agarwal, Engineer as a sole arbitrator without notice to the petitioner
and after filing of the present petition. The registered postal article
that is letter dated 28.6.2003 was sent by registered post in the
ordinary course and in the circumstances there is a presumption that
the article must have been served which has not been rebutted
properly by the respondents except for the bare denial. In the
circumstances the probable inference is that the registered article, the
letter dated 28.6.2003, was served on the respondents and they failed
to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days of the notice demanding them
to appoint an arbitrator in terms of arbitration agreement between the
parties and before filing of the present petition. The present petition
under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act was also filed
by the petitioner on 18.8.2003 and admittedly according to the plea of
the respondents, Sh.SS. Aggarwal was appointed as an arbitrator by
communication dated 22.10.2003 after filing of the present petition.

10.

The learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on (2006) 2

SCC 638, Punj Lloyd Ltd Vs.Petronet MHB Ltd; Datar Switchgears Ltd

AA No.177/2003

Page 7 of 1

Vs.Tata Finance Ltd, (2000) 8 SCC 151 and (2007) 5 SCC 304, Ace
Pipeline Contracts (P) Ltd Vs. Bharat Petroleum Corpn. Ltd to contend
that since the respondent failed to appoint an arbitrator within 30
days of the demand and had also failed to appoint an arbitrator before
the petitioner moved the Court under Section 11 of the Arbitrator and
Conciliation Act, 1996, the right for the appointment of an arbitrator
by the respondent was forfeited. According to the petitioner's counsel
the Supreme Court in Punj Lloyd (Supra) had followed the ratio laid
down by the Supreme Court in Datar Switchgear (Supra).

11.

There have been disputes between the parties in respect of

another agreement regarding construction of 490 dwelling units
which was also awarded to the petitioner and the agreement executed
between the petitioner and the respondents also had an arbitration
clause where also the disputes had arisen and the petitioner had
demanded appointment of an arbitrator. Since the respondents failed
to appoint an arbitrator another petition being AA No.194/2003 was
filed by the petitioner which petition was disposed of by an order
dated 13th November, 2003 wherein

Sh.S.S.Aggarwal, 263, Rajouri

Apartments, Rajouri Garden, New Delhi-110064 was appointed as an
arbitrator by this court as the parties agreed to his appointment. The
learned counsel for the petitioner, though he agreed to the
appointment of Sh. SS Aggarwal as an arbitrator, contended that

AA No.177/2003

Page 8 of 1

Sh.S.S.Aggarwal could not proceed with the arbitration unless
appointed by the Court in the present facts and circumstances.
However, considering various facts, the petitioner herein is agreeable
for appointment of Sh.S.S.Aggarwal as an arbitrator provided he
starts the arbitration proceedings afresh pursuant to the appointment
made by this Court.

12.

The respondents had lost their right to appoint an arbitrator as

pursuant to notice dated 28.6.2003 which is held to have been served
on the respondents, they failed to appoint an arbitrator within 30
days and even before filing of the petition which was filed on
18.8.2003. Admittedly the present arbitrator Sh. S.S. Aggarwal was
appointed on 22.10.2003 could not act as an arbitrator and it will be
for this Court to appoint an arbitrator.

13.

This is no more rest Integra that once a party files an

application

under

section

11(6)

of

the

act,

the

other

party

extinguishes its right to appoint an arbitrator in terms of the
arbitration agreement thereafter. The right to appoint an arbitrator
under the arbitration agreement ceases after section 11 (6) petition
has been filed by the other party before the court seeking
appointment of an arbitrator, was held by the Supreme Court in 2007
(3) Arb.L.R 282 (SC), Bharat Battery Manufacturing Co. (P) Ltd Vs

AA No.177/2003

Page 9 of 1

Union of India following the ratio of the decision of three judges bench
in Punj Lloyd Ltd. Vs Petronet MHB Ltd., (2006) 2 SCC 638. The
Supreme Court had held that once the period of 30 days had lapsed,
and the party had moved the chief justice under section 11 (6), the
other party, having right to appoint an arbitrator under an Arbitral
agreement loses the right to do so. In Datar Switchgears Ltd. Vs Tata
Finance Ltd. and anr, (2000) 8 SCC 151 at page 168, para 19, the
Apex Court had held:

“19. So far as cases falling under Section 11(6) are concerned — such as the one before us — no time limit has
been prescribed under the Act, whereas a period of 30
days has been prescribed under Section 11(4) and Section
11(5) of the Act. In our view, therefore, so far as Section
11(6) is concerned , if one party demands the opposite
party to appoint an arbitrator and the opposite party does
not make an appointment within 30 days of the demand,
the right to appointment does not get automatically forfeited after expiry of 30 days. If the opposite party makes
an appointment even after 30 days of the demand, but
before the first party has moved the court under Section 11
, that would be sufficient. In other words, in cases arising
under Section 11(6), if the opposite party has not made
an appointment within 30 days of demand, the right to
make appointment is not forfeited but continues, but an
appointment has to be made before the former files application under Section 11 seeking appointment of an arbitrator. Only then the right of the opposite party ceases.
We do not, therefore, agree with the observation in the
above judgments that if the appointment is not made
within 30 days of demand, the right to appoint an arbitrator under Section 11(6) is forfeited.”

The notice dated 28th June, 2003 was given to the respondents

seeking appointment of the arbitrator. The present petition was filed
on 18th August, 2003 and the arbitrator, Sh. S.S Aggarwal, was
appointed

by

the

respondents

on

22.10.2003.

Therefore,

the

respondents could not appoint an arbitrator and consequently it will
be for this Court to appoint an arbitrator. However, since the
petitioner has now agreed to the appointment of Sh.S.S.Aggarwal,
263,

Rajouri

Apartments,

Rajouri

Garden,

New

Delhi

(Mobile

No.9811239155) as an arbitrator who has also been appointed by this
court as an arbitrator for adjudication of disputes between the parties
in another matter, it will be just and appropriate to appoint him as an
arbitrator.

15.

Consequently,

Sh.S.S.Aggarwal,

263,

Rajouri

Apartments,

Rajouri Garden, New Delhi (Mobile No.9811239155) is appointed as
an arbitrator for adjudication of the disputes between the parties. The
fees of the arbitrator shall be Rs.50,000/- to be paid by the petitioner
in the first instance. The learned arbitrator shall now proceed with the
arbitration afresh pursuant to his appointment by this Court. Parties
are directed to appear before the arbitrator on 3rd December, 2007 at
3 PM. A copy of the order be sent forthwith to the learned arbitrator.
The parties are also directed to produce the copy of the order before

parties.
