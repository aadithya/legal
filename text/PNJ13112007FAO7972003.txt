PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Vide impugned order dated 30.8.2003, holding that

courts at Delhi lacked territorial jurisdiction to entertain the
plaint, the same has been ordered to be returned.
2.

It is urged by learned counsel for the petitioner

(plaintiff) that in view of the specific averments made in para 5
and 6 of the plaint it could not be said that no cause of action
had accrued to the plaintiff to institute the suit at Delhi.

3.

After going through the pleadings of the parties and

admitted documents filed by the plaintiff learned Trial Court
has opined that no part of cause of action has accrued at Delhi.
4.

Para 5 and 6 of the plaint which are relied upon by

learned counsel for the petitioner at the hearing today read as
under :â€œ5. That in the month of August 2000 the
Defendant No.1 approached the Defendant No.2 for
purchase of Filament Yarn manufactured by the
Plaintiff and the Defendant No.1 and 2 placed an
order for supply of 3409.930 Kgs. of Catonic
Polyster Filament Yarn to the Defendant No.1.
6.
That as per the instructions received from the
Defendants, the Plaintiff supplied the material, i.e.
3409.930 kgs. Of 80 x 24 Catonic Polyster Filament
Yarn to the Defendants. The Plaintiff raised its
invoice No.E00/SUR/1103 dated 19th August 2000
for Rs.3,07,754/- and forwarded the same to the
Defendant No.1 with a copy to the Defendant No.2.
5.

A perusal of the plaint shows that in para 1 of the

plaint it has been averred that the plaintiff is a company having
its registered office in District Udham Singh Nagar, Uttar
Pradesh and Head Office at Delhi. In para 2 it is stated that the
plaintiff is a leading manufacturer of polyster yarn. In para 3 it
is stated that plaintiff appointed defendant No.2 as one of its
agent in Surat area. In para 4, salient features of the agency
agreement
been

between

plaintiff

and

defendant

No.2

have

page 2 of 5

stated. Thereafter, averments have been made in paras 5 and
6, contents whereof have been noted here-in-above.
6.

7.

In para 7 of the plaint it is stated as under :7.
That the said material was duly received by
the Defendant No.1 and the amount of the invoice
became due for payment by the Defendant No.1.
The Defendant No.1, however, failed to make the
payment of the said invoice.
As a result, the
amount of Rs.3,07,754/- still remained unpaid.
Thereafter, it is stated that since defendant No.1

failed to pay the money the suit was instituted.
8.

Invoice dated 19.8.2000 referred to in para 6 of the

plaint has been filed by the plaintiff and is at page 217 of the
trial court record. The invoice clearly records that it pertains to
Ester Industries Ltd., i.e. plaintiff and relates to its office at 303,
Shree Shyam Chambers near J.K.Tower, Ring Road, Surat
(Gujarat) and the godown at premises No.56-57, 59-61, UNN
Shopping Estate, District Surat (Gujarat).
9.

A meaningful reading of the plaint reveals and as is

evident from the averments made in para 5 of the plaint that
case projected is that defendant No.1 approached defendant
No.2,

the

agent

of

the

plaintiff

for

purchase

of

yarn

manufactured by the plaintiff.
10.

This obviously had to be in the city of Surat for

the
page 3 of 5

reason both defendant No.1 and defendant No.2 have their
offices

only

in

Surat,

meaning

acceptance was at Gujarat.

thereby,

the

offer

and

Plaintiff's agent, i.e. Defendant

No.2 was acting on behalf of the plaintiff. Averments made in
para 6 to the effect 'that as per instructions received from the
defendants'

have

to

be

understood

with

reference

to

averments made in para 5, meaning thereby, that when
defendant No.1 placed order upon defendant No.2 who was
acting as the agent of the plaintiff, defendant No.2 instructed
the plaintiff to supply the goods.

As stated in para 6 of the

plaint, invoice dated 19.8.2000 was raised when goods were
supplied.
11.

As noted above, the invoice pertains to the office

and godowns of the plaintiff in the State of Gujarat.
12.

No doubt, in the invoice it is stated that disputes

would be subject to jurisdiction of courts at Delhi but since
parties cannot by consent confer jurisdiction upon a court not
otherwise having jurisdiction and the law being that if more
than one court has jurisdiction, by consent, parties can exclude
jurisdiction of a court and exclusively vest jurisdiction in the
other court; relevant clause in the invoice is of no avail to the
plaintiff.

13.

Entire cause of action has accrued in the State of

Gujarat.
14.

I find no infirmity in the impugned order.

15.

The petition is dismissed.

16.

Trial court record be returned forthwith.
