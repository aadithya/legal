ANIL KUMAR, J.
1.

This order shall dispose of objections by the plaintiff, Union of India under

Sections 30 and 33 of Arbitration Act, 1940 against the arbitral award dated 29th
December, 1999 passed by the learned Arbitrator which was filed by the Arbitrator
and which was registered as CS(OS) 1257-A of 2000 and the petition which was filed
by M/s Kundra Shoes under Section14,17 & 29 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 before
the Award was filed by the Arbitrator, seeking direction to the Arbitrator to file the
award and to make the award rule of the Court.

2.

Brief facts to appreciate the controversies are that the plaintiff floated a tender

enquiry and in response defendant offered to supply the stores, namely, shoe canvas,
brown rubber soles of different size by an advance acceptance of tender on 30th July,
1984

followed

by

a

formal

AT

bearing

No.WL-3/101/208/2-6-

81/63/II/776/RP/110/COAD dated 9th August, 1984. The plaintiff had conveyed his
acceptance of tender by letter dated 16th August, 1984 except the Bank guarantee
which was furnished on 31st January, 1985..

3.

That despite the acceptance of the tender, the defendant could not deliver the

stores in accordance with the schedule as set out in clause 10 of ender and therefore,
by letter dated 12th March, 1985 referring to an earlier letter dated 5 th February, 1985,
CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 2 of 23

the defendant requested for an extension of delivery period. Consequent to the request
made by the defendant, the delivery period was extended up to 31st March, 1985
which was agreeable by the defendant unconditionally.

4.

Defendant thereafter sought further extension of time which were allowed up

to 24th July, 1987. Extension thereafter, sought on 18th September, 1987 was, however,
was not considered. As the defendant had failed to supply the stores, a quantity of
89,542 pairs, the contract was cancelled by the plaintiff on 29th December, 1987
treating the date of breach as 30th September, 1987. Consequent to the cancellation of
the contract, the bank guarantee was also sought to be invoked by the plaintiff on 30 th
December, 1987.

5.

That in accordance with the terms of the agreement, a communication dated

11/13th January, 1988 was sent to be the defendant regarding effecting a risk/purchase.

6.

That pursuant to the notice of the risk/purchase, the plaintiff carried out

risk/purchase and claimed amounts from the defendants leading to disputes between
the parties. The defendant claimed that the risk/purchase was not carried out within a
period of six months from the cancellation of the contract, in accordance with the

CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 3 of 23

terms of the agreement. It seems that the defects appeared in the soles of shoes which
were supplied by the defendant. The defendant was served notice to remove the
defects after about seven years of supply which the defendant failed to do, leading to
auction of the same after about 7 years and thus more disputes arose between the
parties.

7.

That since the disputes had arisen on account of demands raised by the

plaintiff, the arbitration agreement in terms of arbitration clause was invoked and
matter was referred for adjudication of the sole arbitrator before whom plaintiff made
six claims and the defendant also made counter claims. Shri Ram Bahadur, Addl.
Legal Advisor to the Government of India, Ministry of Law was appointed as Sole
Arbitrator and on his resignation, Mr. B.L.Nishad, Addl. Legal Advisor to the
Government of India was appointed the sole Arbitrator who gave an award.

The learned arbitrator gave an award dated 29th December, 1999 and rejected

The award was filed in the court for making it rule of the Court. On the

objections filed by the plaintiff, reply was filed and on the pleadings of the parties, the
Court framed the following issues:1. “Whether the award dated 21st December, 1999 is liable to be set
aside as prayed?
2. Relief.”

10.

During the arguments, the learned counsel for the parties have confined their

submissions to the claims No.1 and 2 only of the plaintiff/ UOI which were
disallowed.

11.

The counsel for the plaintiff, Ms. Rekha Palli, contended regarding claim No.1

CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 6 of 23

that the agreement was breached on 30th September, 1987 and since the risk/purchase
could be carried out till 31st March, 1988, therefore, a detailed telegram given on 2nd
March, 1988 for risk/purchase makes the risk/purchase made by the plaintiff within
time. Relying on the formal order made regarding risk/purchase stipulating that the
risk/purchase was in continuance of office advertisement AT telegram of even number
dated 2nd March, 1988, makes it within time and the findings of the arbitrator that the
risk/purchase was not made within time is ex facie incorrect. She also relied on
contract, definition of acceptance of tender to contend that acceptance of tender
includes an advance acceptance of his tender. The relevant definition of acceptance of
tender is extracted as under for reference:“1(a)” “Acceptance of tender” means the letter of memorandum
communicated to the contractor, the acceptance of his tender includes
an advance acceptance of his tender.”

12.

The learned counsel for the plaintiff, therefore, contended that the arbitrator

has mis-conducted in disregarding the telegram dated 2nd March, 1988 and the
definition of `acceptance' of tender and thus holding that the risk purchase was not
made within time under the agreement, is erroneous.

13.

Regarding the second claim, it was contended that the arbitrator exceeded his

jurisdiction by holding that timely action of return of disposal as per notice dated

CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 7 of 23

15/19th May, 1987 would have given the full price and has thus mis-conducted and
therefore, setting aside of the award on account of these claims was prayed.

14.

Per contra the defendant contends that claim No.1 has not been rejected merely

on account of risk/purchase being not made within time but also on account of
deviations between the terms of the contract awarded to the defendant and the terms in
the risk/purchase contract entered by the claimant. The arbitrator relied on different
deviations categorically stipulated by the defendant in his reply which are extracted as
under for reference:-

15.

The defendant contended that the order for risk/purchase was not accepted

unconditionally and on account of various variation, the delivery period was re-fixed
and communicated to the plaintiff vide letter dated 9th April, 1988 and the Arbitrator
has taken all these aspects into consideration before rejecting the claim No.1 of the
plaintiff.

The respondent relied on 1992(2) RAJ 162 (SC) Himachal Pradesh

Electricity Board Vs. R.J. Shah and Co.; AIR 1990 SC 1340, M/s. Hind Builders vs.
Union of India; AIR 1989 SC 890, Sudharshan Trading Co. Vs. Government of
Kerala and Anr; AIR 1989 SC 1263, Food Corporation of India Vs. Joginder Pal
Mohinder Lal and Anr.; AIR 1971 SC 1646, Union of India Vs. Kalinga Construction
Co., AIR 1999 (3) SC 3869, Arosan Enterprises Vs. Union of India, to contend that
the Court cannot substitute its own decision and conclusion in interpretation of a
contract which is a matter for an arbitrator to decide. As appraisement of evidence by
arbitrator is never a matter which the Court questions and considers because the
parties have selected their own forum and the deciding forum must be conceded the
power of the appraisement of the evidence. The defendant contended that there is no
error in exercise of jurisdiction and highlighted the distinction between an error within
the jurisdiction and an error in exercise of the jurisdiction. It was also contended that
mitigation of damages relates to question of facts to which the decision of the
Arbitrator is final. Regarding the plea of the plaintiff that sale of rejected goods could

CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 9 of 23

not be a justification for rejecting the claim of the plaintiff for non-replacement of the
store, it was contended by the defendant that if he had refused to take delivery of the
rejected goods, the plaintiff could dispose of the same and while doing it, plaintiff was
bound to follow the principle of mitigation of damages. Instead of disposing of the
goods within seven days as contemplated under the contract, the plaintiff took seven
years and is still could get such a good price and therefore the conclusion of the
arbitrator that the plaintiff could not take advantage of his own delays, cannot be
faulted by the plaintiff.

16.

I have considered the objections, reply and have heard the counsel for the

parties at length. Under claim No.1, the plaintiff has claimed a sum of Rs.3,09,144.40
on account of risk/purchase clause which has been disallowed by the arbitrator. The
Arbitrator has considered that the date of breach was 30th September, 1987 and
risk/purchase had to be made by 31st March, 1988. The Arbitrator who was an
additional Legal Advisor under the Ministry of Law & Justice and DGS&G has noted
that there were deviations between the terms awarded to the defendant and in the
risk/purchase contract. The Arbitrator has also noted that UOI had ignored low rates
for risk/purchase which were available. The low rates for the risk/purchase were noted
on the basis of official noting of the comparative chart dated 11 th August, 1999 filed
by the plaintiff. The learned Arbitrator also reached his decision on the ground that
the agreement for risk/purchase was not solely based on advance order dated 2nd

CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 10 of 23

March, 1988 as the same was not accepted and the formal order was in terms of the
letter dated 9th April, 1988, copy of which was filed by the UOI himself and the
delivery as offered was required to be re-fixed.

17.

The submission of the learned counsel, Ms. Rekha Palli is mainly based on the

telegram dated 2nd March, 1988 which is extracted as under:-

According to her, the formal order dated 4th April 1988 was in continuation of
this office telegram and as under the terms and under the definition of acceptance of
tender, the advance acceptance of tender is also included, therefore, the acceptance of
same was deemed to have been effected on 2 nd March, 1988 and well before the 31st
March, 1988.
CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000

18.

The learned Arbitrator has considered the terms of the contract and the

telegram dated 2nd March, 1988, formal order dated 4th April, 1988 and deviations
between the contract of defendant and the contract to risk/purchase as well as other
low rates which were not considered by the plaintiff and after due consideration has
disallowed the claim. In the circumstances it cannot be inferred that the arbitrator has
not considered the telegram relied on by the plaintiffs and the definition of acceptance
as referred to by the plaintiff. The learned counsel for the plaintiff is unable to show
any legal proposition considered by the arbitrator being erroneous. An award may be
set aside on the ground of error on the face of the award, but an award is not invalid
merely because by a process of inference and argument it may be demonstrated that
the arbitrator has committed some mistake in arriving at his conclusion. Appraisement
of evidence by the arbitrator is never a matter which the court questions and considers.
If the parties have selected their own forum, the deciding forum must be conceded the
power of appraisement of the evidence. The arbitrator is the sole Judge of the quality
as well as the quantity of evidence and it will not be for the court to take upon itself
the task of being a judge on the evidence before the arbitrator. The Supreme Court in
Sudarsan Trading Vs Govt. of Kerala, (1989) 2 SCC 38 had held at page 54:
29………….Furthermore, in any event, reasonableness of the reasons
given by the arbitrator, cannot be challenged. Appraisement of
evidence by the arbitrator is never a matter which the court questions
and considers. If the parties have selected their own forum, the
deciding forum must be conceded the power of appraisement of the
evidence. The arbitrator is the sole Judge of the quality as well as the
CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 12 of 23

quantity of evidence and it will not be for the court to take upon itself
the task of being a judge on the evidence before the arbitrator. See the
observations of this Court in MCD v. Jagan Nath Ashok Kuma.
30. The same principle has been stated in Alopi Parshad & Sons, Ltd.
v. Union of India. There this Court held that the award was liable to be
set aside because of an error apparent on the face of the award. An
arbitration award might be set aside on the ground of an error on the
face of it when the reasons given for the decision, either in the award
or in any document incorporated with it, are based upon a legal
proposition which is erroneous. But where a specific question is
referred, the award is not liable to be set aside on the ground of an error
on the face of the award even if the answer to the question involves an
erroneous decision on a point of law. But an award which ignores
express terms of the contract, is bad.
In Jivarajbhai Ujamshi Sheth v. Chintamanrao Balaji this Court
reiterated that an award by an arbitrator is conclusive as a judgment
between the parties and the court is entitled to set aside an award if the
arbitrator has mis-conducted himself in the proceeding or when the
award has been made after the issue of an order by the court
superseding the arbitration or after arbitration proceedings have
become invalid under Section 35 of the Arbitration Act or where an
award has been improperly procured or is otherwise invalid under
Section 30 of the Act. An award may be set aside on the ground of
error on the face of the award, but an award is not invalid merely
because by a process of inference and argument it may be demonstrated
that the arbitrator has committed some mistake in arriving at his
conclusion. The court, however, went into the question whether the
arbitrator had included depreciation and appreciation of certain assets
in the value of the goodwill which he was incompetent to include by
virtue of the limits placed upon his authority by the deed of reference.
The court found that that was not a case in which the arbitrator had
committed an error of fact or law in reaching his conclusions on the
disputed questions submitted for adjudication. It was a case of
assumption of jurisdiction not possessed by him and that rendered the
award to the extent to which it was beyond the arbitrators’ jurisdiction,
invalid. This was reiterated by Justice Hidayatullah that if the parties
set limits to action by the arbitrator, then the arbitrator had to follow
the limits set for him and the court can find that he exceeded his
jurisdiction on proof of such excess. In that case the arbitrator in
working out net profits for four years took into account depreciation of
immovable property. For this reason he must be held to have exceeded
his jurisdiction and it is not a question of his having merely interpreted
CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 13 of 23

the partnership agreement for himself as to which the civil court could
have had no say, unless there was an error of law on the face of the
award. Therefore, it appears to us that there are two different and
distinct grounds involved in many of the cases. One is the error
apparent on the face of the award, and the other is that the arbitrator
exceeded his jurisdiction. In the latter case, the courts can look into the
arbitration agreement but in the former, it cannot, unless the agreement
was incorporated or recited in the award.

31. An award may be remitted or set aside on the ground that the
arbitrator in making it, had exceeded his jurisdiction and evidence of
matters not appearing on the face of it, will be admitted in order to
establish whether the jurisdiction had been exceeded or not, because
the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined
outside the award — whatever might be said about it in the award or by
the arbitrator. See in this connection, the observations of Russell on
The Law of Arbitration, 20th Edn., p. 427. Also see the observations of
Christopher Brown Ld. v. Genossenschaft Oesterreichischer and
Dalmia Dairy Industries Ltd. v. National Bank of Pakistan. It has to be
reiterated that an arbitrator acting beyond his jurisdiction — is a
different ground from the error apparent on the face of the award. In
Halsbury’s Laws of England II, 4th Edn., Vol. 2, para 622 one of the
misconducts enumerated, is the decision by the arbitrator on a matter
which is not included in the agreement or reference. But in such a case
one has to determine the distinction between an error within the
jurisdiction and an error in excess of the jurisdiction. See the
observations in Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission
and Regina v. Noseda, Field, Knight & Fitzpatrick. But, in the instant
case the court had examined the different claims not to find out
whether these claims were within the disputes referable to the
arbitrator, but to find out whether in arriving at the decision, the
arbitrator had acted correctly or incorrectly. This, in our opinion, the
court had no jurisdiction to do, namely, substitution of its own
evaluation of the conclusion of law or fact to come to the conclusion
that the arbitrator had acted contrary to the bargain between the parties.
Whether a particular amount was liable to be paid or damages liable to
be sustained, was a decision within the competency of the arbitrator in
this case. By purporting to construe the contract the court could not
take upon itself the burden of saying that this was contrary to the
contract and, as such, beyond jurisdiction. It has to be determined that
there is a distinction between disputes as to the jurisdiction of the
arbitrator and the disputes as to in what way that jurisdiction should be
exercised. There may be a conflict as to the power of the arbitrator to
grant a particular remedy. See Commercial Arbitration by Sir N.J.

2192, Hindustan Construction Co Ltd. Vs State of J & K and (2003) 8 SCC 4,
Continental Construction Ltd. Vs

State of U.P it was held by the Apex Court

regarding interpretation of the terms of the contract that the Court can not substitute
its own interpretation with that of the arbitrator so long as the interpretation of the
arbitrator is a possible one. If an interpretation to a particular clause of agreement is
given by the Arbitrator, such an interpretation although may be erroneous, is final and
binding and Court does not have power to upset the findings. However, if Arbitrator
passes an award by ignoring the stipulation and prohibition contained in the
agreement, then Arbitrator travels beyond his jurisdiction. The arbitrator has
considered the telegram and the definition of acceptance. The claim 1 of the plaintiff
has also been declined on account deviations between the contract of defendant and
the contract of risk/purchase as well as other ground of low rates which were not
considered by the plaintiff. There are limits for judicial reviewability and the Courts
exercise

limited jurisdiction in the proceeding for setting aside an award under

Section 30 of the Act. The Courts do not exercise appellate jurisdiction over the
verdict of an arbitrator and as such cannot go into the merits of the case nor the court
can re-appraise and re-examine the evidence led before the arbitrator. The arbitrator
has given sufficient and cogent reasons for declining the claim 1 of the plaintiff in the
present facts and circumstances. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the
CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 15 of 23

Arbitrator has exceeded in his jurisdiction. There does not seem to be an error in his
inferences. Even if it is presumed that there is an error in his inference, the same shall
be error within his jurisdiction and this Court will not substitute its decision with the
decision of an Arbitrator who has considered all the material which is also relied on
by the plaintiff. Consequently, the objection of the claimant/plaintiff in respect of
claim No.1 is rejected.

19.

In respect of claim No.2 of the plaintiff, the learned Arbitrator has held as

under:“I disallow this claim of the claimant for the following reasons:i)

The claimant had withheld the bills of the defendant and
defendant had filed several letters for return of rejected goods
and defendant also has filed letter dt. 15/19.5.87 (R-13)
demanding a sum of Rs.2,54,489.40 with advice in Clause No.4
of it that rejected goods are lying at depot at risk and cost of the
defendant and defendant may remove or give instructions for its
disposal within two weeks, failing which these will be returned
to defendant on freight to pay basis or dispose of it at contractor
risk on this account. The claimant had not returned it to the
defendant on freight to pay basis. The defendant has themselves
produced letter dt. 18.3.88 and 19.12.88, that they were not
allowed to lift the rejected stores according to claimant they after
7 years of letter dt.15/19.5.87 without any prior notice auctioned
14,957 pairs out of 15,000 on 19.4.94 for Rs.1,42,100.00.

ii)

The failure to act as per notice dt.15/19.5.87 and refusal to
return the rejected goods and selling it in April, 1994 without
notice in 1994 and of delay in taking prior action by claimant for
7 years after notice of 15/19.5.87 is unexplained.
I find that even in auction made after 7 years, shoes still
fetched Rs.1,42,100.00 which is over 50% of price and the
timely action by return of disposal as per notice dt.15/19.5.87
would have given the full price.

CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 16 of 23

iii) The claimant did not take steps as required under clause 4(2)
and 17 of DGS&D-68 (Revised) within proper time.”

The learned Arbitrator has relied on the notice dated 14/19th May, 1987 and the
letters dated 18th March, 1988 and 19th December, 1988.

20.

The counsel for the plaintiff has relied on clause 13(b) of the agreement which

is extracted as under:“13(b) All rejected stores shall in any event and circumstances
remain and always be at the risk of the contractor immediately on
such rejection. If such stores are not removed by the contractor
within the periods aforementioned, the Inspector may remove the
rejected stores and either return the same to the contractor at his risk
and cost by such mode of transport as the Secretary or Inspector
may decide, or dispose of such stores at the contractor's risk and on
his account and retain such portion of the proceeds if any from such
disposals as may be necessary to recover any expense incurred in
connection with such disposals (or any price refundable as a
consequence of such rejection). The purchaser shall, in addition, be
entitled to recover from the contractor handling and storage charges
for the period during which the rejected stores are not
removed/disposed of in accordance with the provisions hereof.”

21.

To contend that once the notice had been given to remove the defective stores

and still the plaintiff did not allow the defendant to remove the stores, it was at the
risk and cost of the defendant and in any case, under 13(a), the plaintiff was entitled to
retain the rejected stores till the price paid for such stores was refunded by the

CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000

contractor, is not tenable in the facts and circumstances. The relevant portion of 13(a)
is extracted for reference:“13(a) On rejection of all stores submitted for inspection at a
place other than the premises of the contractor, such stores
shall be removed by the contractor at his own cost, subject as
hereinafter stipulated, within 14 days of the date of intimation
of such rejection. If the concerned communication is
addressed and posted to the contractor at the address
mentioned in the schedule, it will be deemed to have been
served on him at the time when such communication would in
the course of ordinary post reach the contractor. Provided that
the Inspector may call upon the contractor to remove
dangerous, infected or perishable stores within 48 hours of the
receipt of such communication and the decision of the
Inspector in this behalf shall be final in all respects. Provided
further that where the price or part thereof has been paid the
consignee is entitled without prejudice to his other rights to
retain the rejected stores till the price paid for such stores is
refunded by the contractor say that such retention shall not in
any circumstances be deemed to be acceptance of the stores or
waiver of rejection thereof.”

The failure to act as per notice dt.15/19.5.87 and refusal to return the
rejected goods and selling it in April, 1994 without notice in 1994 and of
delay in taking prior action by claimant for 7 years after notice of 15/19.5.87
is unexplained and the Learned Arbitrator on this basis has rejected the claim
of the plaintiff/UOI.

22.

The plaintiff has also relied on 2003 (67) DRJ 596 , Union of India Vs. U.P.

CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

Upbhokta Sahkari Sangh Limited, Lucknow to contend that if an arbitrator arrives at a
finding which is contrary to the material before him and has arrived at a conclusion
which is capricious on the face of it, the award would be totally perverse, capricious
and contrary to the material available to the Arbitrator and award is liable to be set
aside.

Ms. Rekha Palli, learned counsel, contended that in the matter of U.P.

Upbhokta Sahkari Sangh Ltd. (supra), the Arbitrator had recorded a finding that the
goods were accepted with price variation and were not of the same specification
which the Arbitrator could not have done nor the arbitrator could ask for the proof of
market value because the claimant had not given the proof of market value and thus
the award was set aside, is akin to the present case as merely on the basis of alleged
deviations and all the goods available at low price, the claim could not be disallowed.
Perusal of the judgment shows that the facts are clearly distinguishable as in the case
of the plaintiff, the deviations were categorically stipulated in reply and even the
lower rates of the risk/purchase goods were inferred from the office noting produced
by the claimant himself whereas in the case relied on by the plaintiff such evidence
was not available.

23.

It is settled that this Court should not reverse the findings of facts for the

reason that, in the opinion of the Court, the Arbitrator reached wrong conclusions or
failed to appreciate the facts. In Hindustan Iron Co. v. K. Shashikant & Co., AIR 1987
SC 81 the Apex Court had held that the award of the Arbitrator ought not to be set

CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 19 of 23

aside for the reason that, in the opinion of the Court, the Arbitrator reached wrong
conclusions or failed to appreciate the facts. This well settled proposition of law was
reiterated in the decision of the Apex Court in Coimbatore District Podu Thozillar
Sangam vs. Balasubramania Foundary & Ors., AIR 1987 SC 2045 where it had been
opined that it is only an error of law and not a mistake of fact committed by the
arbitrator which can be adjudicated in the application/objection before the Court. If
there is no legal proposition either in the award or in any document annexed with the
award which is erroneous and the alleged mistakes or alleged errors, are only mistakes
of fact and if the award is made fairly, after giving adequate opportunity to the parties
to place their grievances in the manner provided by the arbitration agreement, the
award is not amenable to corrections of the Court. Similar opinions were expressed in
Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. vs. Indian Carbon Ltd., (1988) 3 SCC 36; Jawahar Lal
Wadhwa & Anr. vs. Haripada Chakroberty, (1989) 1 SCC 76; Puri Construction Pvt.
Ltd. vs. Union of India, (1989) 1 SCC 411; Food Corporation of India vs. Joginderpal
Mohinderpal & Anr., AIR 1989 SC 1263 holding that a plausible view taken by the
Arbitrator was not open to Court interference. In Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs.
M/s. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar & Anr., AIR 1987 SC 2316 the Court held that if the
reasons appear per se to be not unreasonable and irrational the Court ought not to reappreciate the evidence. In Hind Builders vs. Union of India, AIR 1990 SC 1340 the
Court cautioned that where two views were possible it could not be predicated that
there was an error apparent on the face of the award. In Bijendra Nath Srivastava vs.
Mayank Srivastava & Ors. AIR 1994 SC 2562 the view expressed was that the

CS(OS) No.1257-A of 2000
& CS(OS) 516-A of 2000

page 20 of 23

reasonableness of reasons given by the arbitrator was not open to challenge and that
the proper approach would be for the Court to support the award. Similarly, in
Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. vs. Governor of Orissa & Ors., AIR 1995 SC 2189 it
was reiterated that the Court cannot re-appreciate the material on the record. In
Trustees of the Port of Madras vs. Engineering Constructions Corporation Ltd., (1995)
5 SCC 531 the decision of a Division Bench of the High Court of Madras, which had
reversed the Award on a question of fact and not on a question of law, was set aside
by the Supreme Court. After considering its previous decisions, the Apex Court in
B.V. Radha Krishna vs. Sponge Iron India Ltd., (1997) 4 SCC 693 again held that the
Court could not substitute its own view in place of that of the Arbitrator. In Army
Welfare Housing Organisation vs. Gautam Construction & Fisheries Ltd. (1998) 7
SCC 290 the Court declined to vary an award for the reason that without reappreciating evidence it would not be possible to fault the quantum awarded towards
anticipated expenses. In any case, it cannot be said considering all the facts that the
Arbitrator has committed error in excess of jurisdiction. If that be so then this Court
will not substitute its inferences with that of the Arbitrator.

24.

In the circumstances, objections raised by the claimant against the claim No.1

and 2 are rejected as the Arbitrator has taken the material before him into
consideration and has arrived at just inference. The objections are, therefore, without
any merit and are dismissed.

25.

As no other objections were raised and pressed by the parties against the other

claims of the claimant and the counter claims of the defendant, I, therefore dismiss the
objections of the claimant and make the award Rule of the Court. Consequently IA
No.293 of 2001 in CS(OS) 1257-A of 2000 being objections of the Union of India
under section 30 & 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 are dismissed and the CS (OS)
516-A of 2000 for making the award dated 29.12.1999 rule of the Court under section
14, 17 & 19 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 is allowed. Consequently, decree sheet be
drawn in accordance with the award. The defendant is also awarded interest at the rate
of 12% per annum from the date of institution of petition to make the award rule of
the Court till the realization of the decreetal amount. Parties are, however, left to bear
their own costs.
