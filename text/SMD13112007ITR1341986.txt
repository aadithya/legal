1.

The questions of law referred to us under Section 256(1) of the

Income Tax Act, 1961 ('Act') by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi
Bench “A”, New Delhi ('Tribunal') read as under:
“1. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal was correct in
law in observing that the provisions of section 11(2) are
applicable to the Assessee's Trust?
2. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was correct in law in directing that the
accumulation of the trust in previous years prior to the
previous year relevant to the asstt. Year 1980-81 shall
also qualify for deductions of 75% allowable u/s 11(2) of
the Income-tax Act?

3. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the ITAT was correct in law in treating a sum of
Rs.50,000/- deposited with Shriram Centre for Art and
Culture as application of income whereas it was a loan to
the said concern?”
2.

th

The Assessee Trust was created on 15 February, 1978 by the Indian

National Theatre, a society registered under the Societies Registration Act,
1860. The objects of the Trust are, inter alia, to promote artistic and cultural
expression through drama, music and to undertake activities conducive to
the aforesaid objects and purposes.

3.

The Assessee Trust's application for registration under Section 12 of

the Act was granted by the Commissioner of Income Tax ['CIT']. The
Assessee Trust was also recognised as a charitable trust for the purposes of
Section 11 of the Act.

4.

The Assessee placed a sum of Rs.1 lakh in a fixed deposit with the
th

th

Grindlays Bank on 17 May, 1976. On 29 December, 1979 the Assessee
placed another deposit with the same bank in the sum of Rs.80,000/-. On
th

the same day, that is, on 29 December, 1979 the Assessee placed a further
sum of Rs.2 lakhs in a fixed deposit with the State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur
('SBBJ').

th

The accounting period of the Assessee ended on 30 June, 1979 and

the year of assessment with which we are concerned is 1980-81.

The

th

Assessee filed its return of income on 30 June, 1980. Four days prior
th

thereto, that is, on 26 June, 1980 the Assessee wrote to the Income Tax
Officer ('ITO') exercising its option in Form 10 read with Rule 17 of the
Income Tax Rules, 1962 to accumulate a sum of Rs.3,78,397/- for the
purposes of the Trust. It was further pointed out that during the period of six
months commencing from the end of the year, the amount accumulated had
been invested in government securities or with the banks in the form of three
fixed deposits in the total sum of Rs.3,80,000/- including Rs.1 lakh placed
th

with the Grindlays Bank on 17 May, 1996.

6.

The ITO, while computing the assessment for the Assessment Year

1980-81 by his assessment order dated 4

th

August, 1983 rejected the

contention that the accumulated amount had been set apart by way of
investments in the manner indicated in Section 11(2) (b) of the Act. The
ITO held that the Assessee had invested only Rs.2,80,000/- during the period
st

st

1 January, 1979 to 31 December, 1979. He allowed the accumulation only
to that extent while finalising the assessment.

Further he held that

Rs.50,000/- shown as loan to Shriram Centre for Art and Culture cannot be

ITR 134/1986

page 3 of 10

held to be an application of the income of the Trust for the purposes of the
Trust.

7.

The appeal filed by the Assessee was dismissed by the CIT(A) who

concurred with the ITO on this ground. It was held that the reference in
Section 11(2) of the Act to accumulation of income and the condition for
investment of 75% of such income in Government securities could only refer
to income generated during the previous year and would “by definition
preclude

a

consideration

of

investment

made

even

before

the

commencement of such previous year.” Therefore while the CIT(A) was of
the view that the ITO was in error in proceeding on the basis that only
st

st

investments made in between 1 January, 1979 and 31 December, 1979
would fulfill the requirements of proviso (b) to Section 11(2), there was no
th

error in excluding the deposit made on 7 May, 1976 which was two years
st

prior to the commencement of the previous year on 1 July,1978.

8.

The further appeal by the Assessee was allowed by the Tribunal by its
th

judgment dated 16 January, 1985.

The Tribunal referred to the letter

whereby an option was exercised by the Assessee in regard to accumulation
of income.

ITR 134/1986

The Tribunal took the view that the CIT(A) had erred in

page 4 of 10

construing this letter to be vague and imprecise. It was held that the option
exercised by the Assessee should be regarded to have been given with
reference to sum of Rs.1,81,509/- and therefore the requirement of Section
11 should be held to have been complied with. The shortfall computed for
the year in question as regards investment was Rs.81,509/-. The Tribunal
observed as under:
“Without going into the merits whether the fixed deposit
of Rs.1 lakh could be regarded as having accumulated
out of the present year's income or not, if that amount of
Rs.1 lakh also is regarded as a shortfall, then the total
amount of Rs.1,81,509/- should be deemed to be the
amount in respect of which the option was exercised.”

9.

The Tribunal further held that the amount of Rs.50,000/- which was

advanced as a loan to Shriram Centre for Art and Culture, was an application
of the income of the Trust for the purposes of the the Trust and therefore
should be construed as such for the purposes of the exemption under Section
11 of the Act.

10.

The questions as framed for our opinion, which have been set out

hereinabove require us to examine three specific issues. The first is whether
the Assessee had at all exercised an option for accumulation of income
within the meaning of Explanation 1 to Sub-Section 1 of Section 11 of the
Act. The second is whether the deposit made with the Grindlays Bank on
ITR 134/1986

page 5 of 10

th

17 May, 1956 could be treated as part of the accumulation of income for
the Assessment Year 1980-81 and whether it would qualify for the 75%
deduction allowable under Section 11(2) of the Act. Thirdly whether the
sum of Rs.50,000/- loaned to Shriram Centre for Art and Culture could be
construed as an application of the income of the Assessee Trust.

11.

As far as the third question is concerned, on examining the orders

passed by the authorities, in which the objects of both the Assessee Trust as
well as the Shriram Centre for Art and Culture have been discussed, we are
of the considered view that the Tribunal was correct in its conclusion that the
sum of Rs.50,000/- deposited with Shriram Centre for Art and Culture
should be treated as an application of the income of the Trust. The word
“application” has to be given a wider interpretation keeping in view the
purpose for which the provision has been introduced. Also, the tax effect on
this sum is insubstantial. We are therefore not inclined to interfere with this
part of the order of the Tribunal. We accordingly answer question No.3 in
the affirmative, that is, against the Revenue and in favour of the Assessee.

12.

That bring us to the first two questions. As regards the issue whether

the Assessee had in fact exercised its option, we are inclined to agree with

ITR 134/1986

page 6 of 10

th

the Tribunal that the wording of the letter dated 26 June, 1980 cannot be
said to be vague. The letter in fact says that the accumulation was being
made “in order to enable the trustees to accumulate sufficient funds for
carrying out the following purposes of the trust.....”.

However, we are

unable to read the letter to mean that the Assessee had exercised the option
in relation to a sum of Rs.1,81,509. The Tribunal has held that “even though
it was said in the letter that it was only in regard to Rs.81,509”, it should be
construed as if the option had been exercised for accumulation of
Rs.1,81,509. This to our mind is a conjecture unsupported by the record. If
therefore the shortfall was only to the extent of Rs.81,509/- then the question
of construing the deposit of Rs. 1 lakh made in 1976 as meeting such
shortfall cannot arise. Therefore, we answer question No.1 in the negative,
that is, in favour of the Revenue and against the Assessee, in so far as the
Tribunal has held that the option was exercised by the Assessee in relation to
Rs.1,81,509.

13.

The third question concerns the deposit of Rs.1 lakh made with

Grindlays Bank. The relevant portion of Section 11(2) applicable at that
point of time reads as under:
“11(2) Where seventy-five percent of the income referred to
in clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) read with the
ITR 134/1986

page 7 of 10

Explanation to that sub-sections not applied, or is not
deemed to have been applied, to charitable or religious
purposes in India during the previous year but is
accumulated or set apart, either in whole or in part, for
application to such purposes in India, such income so
accumulated or set apart shall not be included in the total
income of the previous year of the person in receipt of the
income provided the following conditions are complied with
namely:
(a) such person specifies, by notice in writing given to the
Income-tax Officer in the prescribed manner, the purpose for
which the income is being accumulated or set apart and the
period for which the income is to be accumulated or set
apart, which shall in no case exceed ten years;
(b) the money so accumulated or set apart is invested or
deposited in the forms or modes specified in sub-section
(5).”

14.

The above portion in turn refers to Section 11(1)(a) and (b) which read

as under:
“11.

Income from property held for charitable or religious

purposes. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 60 to 63, the
following income shall not be included in the total income of the
previous year of the person in receipt of the income[(a) income derived from property held under trust wholly for
charitable or religious purposes, to the extent to which such
income is applied to such purposes in India; and, where any such
income is accumulated or set apart for application to such
purposes in India, to the extent to which the income so
accumulated or set apart is not in excess of [fifteen] per cent of

ITR 134/1986

page 8 of 10

the income from such property;
(b) income derived from property held under trust in part only for
such purposes, the trust having been created before the
commencement of this Act, to the extent to which such income is
applied to such purposes in India; and, where any such income is
finally set apart for application to such purposes in India, to the
extent to which the income so set apart is not in excess of
[fifteen] per cent of the income from such property”

15.

The Tribunal, was of the view that even the deposit of Rs.1 lakh made

with the Grindlays Bank more than two years prior to the previous year in
question could qualify as accumulation of income for the purposes of
availing of the exemption. We are unable to agree with this conclusion. It is
one thing to say that the requirement of investment is deemed to have been
satisfied if the investment was made in the year in which income was
received, although such income was not necessarily received in the very year
in which the accumulation was sought to be made. However to stretch it to
include the investments made in years even earlier to the previous year in
question is not warranted on a plain reading of the Section. There seems to
be considerable force in the submission of the learned for the Revenue that
the express wording of the provision indicates that in order to satisfy the
requirement of Section 11(2) (b), the investment must necessarily come out

ITR 134/1986

page 9 of 10

of the current year's income. An investment made in the past obviously
cannot satisfy this requirement. There is no occasion to take a different view
given the purposes and object of such a provision. It is not the Assessee's
case that the deposit with the Grindlays Bank matured during the
Assessment Year in question and was renewed soon thereafter. It appears
that the fixed deposit already made with the Grindlays Bank more than two
years earlier was simply continued. In those circumstances it cannot be said
that there was an application of the income of the Assessee Trust. In the
circumstances, the Tribunal, in our view, erred in observing that the amount
constituting the deposit with the Grindlays Bank “was free and available for
being invested in the Assessment Year in question.” We are unable to
concur with the view expressed by the Tribunal on question No. 2. Question
No. 2 is answered in the negative, that is, in favour of the Revenue and
against the Assessee.

16.

The reference is disposed of accordingly.
