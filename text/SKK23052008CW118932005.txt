Rule DB.

2.

At the request of the learned counsels for the parties, the
petition is taken up for final disposal.

3.

The husband of the petitioner was enrolled in the Army
on 13.8.1954 and was invalidated out of service on
2.9.1967 on medical grounds on account of ear defect
(CSOM). The husband of the petitioner passed away on
21.5.1996 and till his death was in receipt of disability
pension including service element and the disability
element.

The petitioner is in receipt of ordinary family pension but
claims Special Family Pension (SFP). Such SFP is payable
only in case the death of the service personnel was also
occasioned on account of the disease which resulted in
his invalidation from service. The respondents have also
taken a decision that if the death is within a period of ten
(10) years then a presumption would be raised in favour
of such service personnel that the cause of death is
attributable to the same disease but in case the death is
beyond the period of ten (10) years, then there would be
no such presumption.

This is as per Rule 11 of the

Entitlement Rules for Casualty Pensionary Awards, 1982
and is under the heading of Post Discharge Claims, which
is reproduced as under:
“APPENDIX II
Referred to in Regulation 48, 173 & 185
ENTITLEMENT RULES FOR CASUALTY PENSIONARY
AWARDS, 1982

11.
In cases where an individual in respect of a
disability pension dies at home and it cannot form a
strictly medical point of view, be definitely established
that the death was due to the disablement in respect of
which the disability pension was granted:
(a)

the benefit of doubt in determining the
attributability should go to the family of the
deceased, if death occurs within 10 years from
the date of his invalidment from service unless
there are other factors adversely affecting the
claim; and

5.

if death takes place more than 10 years after
the date of man’s invalidment from service, the
benefit of doubt will go to the State.”

It is, however, not in dispute that even if in case of a
death beyond ten (10) years, medical records can be
produced by the wife of the deceased service personnel
to show that the cause of death was the same disease on
which the person was invalidated out of service and thus
the presumption/benefit of doubt in favour of the
respondents is rebuttable.

6.

The case of the petitioner was examined by the
respondents for grant of SFP and was rejected by the
Record Officer on the advice of the PCDA(P) vide letter
dated 19.8.2003.

The petitioner preferred an appeal

which was considered and dismissed in terms of the
impugned order dated 28.4.2005.

The said order

provides that a second appeal is maintainable to the
Raksha Mantri (Defence Minister).
7.

A perusal of the impugned order shows that the cause of
death is stated to be due to heavy swelling in ear and
neck which prima facie appears to have a direct
connection with the disease on account of which the
petitioner was invalidated out of service.

8.

In the given facts of the case we are, thus, of the
considered view that the impugned order is liable to be

WP (C) No.11893 of 2005

Page 3 of 4

set aside and the matter is remanded back to the first
appellate authority to re-examine this particular case
especially taking into consideration the cause of death on
account of which the petitioner was discharged. In case
the petitioner wants to support his case with any further
medical records and certificates the petitioner may do so
within one (1) month from today. The appeal would be
disposed of within

a period of

three (3) months

thereafter. In case the petitioner is found entitled to the
SFP, the petitioner would be entitled to arrears for a
period of three (3) years prior to the date of the first
representation made by the petitioner.
9.

A writ of mandamus is issued quashing the impugned
order dated 28.4.2005 and directing the appellate
authority to act in terms of the aforesaid directions.

10.

The petition stands allowed in the aforesaid terms
leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
