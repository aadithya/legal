:

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Yet another instance of callous drafting at the trial

court level and an obstinate behaviour to persist with the
wrong. The result is that a valuable right of the client has been
lost in the maze of technicalities of procedures of the law.
2.

Oriental Insurance Company filed a suit against M/s.

Citizen Chemicals & Transport Company.

The said company

was proceeded against ex-parte. The ex-parte decree was
passed on 20.8.2003.

When

the

decree

was

put

into

execution an application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC was filed
but by M/s. Citizen Chemicals & Transport Services. Since no
page 1 of 4

decree was passed against M/s. Citizen Chemicals & Transport
Services in the reply to the application the plaintiff questioned
the locus standi of the applicant pointing out that the decree
was against M/s. Citizen Chemicals & Transport Company and
not against M/s. Citizen Chemicals & Transport Services.
3.

The counsel concerned persisted with the obstinate

pleading. The application was dismissed on 10.12.2003 holding
that since no decree was passed against the applicant the
question of the applicant seeking recall of the decree does not
arise. Another application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC was filed
thereafter.

This application was filed on 2.1.2004.

The

applicant of this application was the judgment debtor, i.e. M/s.
Citizen Chemicals & Transport Company Ltd.
4.

An application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act

was filed praying that delay in filing the application be
condoned. With reference to the application filed under Order 9
Rule 13 CPC at the first instance it was stated that the applicant
was bona fide litigating under a different name.
5.

The

learned

Trial

Judge

dismissed

the

said

application vide impugned order dated 28.9.2004.
6.

Reason given by the learned Trial Judge is that it was

pointed out that M/s. Citizen Chemicals & Transport Services
was not the judgment debtor when earlier application was filed.
page 2 of 4

The learned Trial Judge has noted that in spite thereof the
counsel persisted with the obstinate behaviour. Learned Trial
Judge has opined that under the circumstances M/s.Citizen
Chemicals & Transport Company which was acting through the
living human being who had filed an earlier application would
not be entitled to the delay being condoned.
7.

Technically speaking, the view taken by the learned

Trial Judge is correct. Once the judgment debtor was informed
that the application for recall of the ex-parte decree was not
filed by the judgment debtor but by somebody else the
judgment debtor ought to have taken corrective action. Alas,
nothing was done.
8.

Having wasted judicial time and suffering dismissal

of the application as not maintainable the second application
was filed.
9.

Though second application but would be the first

application by M/s. Citizen Chemicals & Transport Company for
the reason the earlier application was filed by M/s. Citizen
Chemicals & Transport Services.
10.

The obstinate conduct of the counsel should not visit

the client with penalty.
11.

The suit sought recovery of Rs.4,39,809/- with

interest @ 18%. The suit has been decreed on 21.5.2003.
page 3 of 4

12.

I note that Rs.98,603/- is the pre-suit interest.

13.

To do justice to the appellant and cutting through

the maze of the technicalities of the procedural law but at the
same time keeping in view the interest of the plaintiff I dispose
of the appeal setting aside the impugned order and allowing
appellant's application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC but on terms.
14.

Within 6 weeks from today appellant shall deposit

Rs.2 lacs with the learned Trial Judge which would be permitted
to be withdrawn by the plaintiff without any security.
15.

On deposit of Rs.2 lacs the suit would be restored

and decided in accordance with law.
16.

Needless to state, if the suit fails learned Trial Judge

would order restitution.
17.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned

counsel for the parties on payment of usual charges.
