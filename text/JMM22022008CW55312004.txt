1.
This judgment shall decide three above said writ petitions
as these involve same facts and identical questions of law.
2.

All the three above named petitioners applied for the post

of “Cook” in Indian Navy Service(in short I.N.S) where the
minimum educational qualifications required for the said post was
from VIIIth Class to XIIth Class. After the written and medical tests
conducted by the respondents, the names of the petitioners
appeared among the successful candidates for the post of Cooks.
The petitioners received an order of enrollment in the Indian
Navy and they were directed to report before the Commanding
Officer, INS, India on 31.3.2004.

The petitioners appeared before the Commanding Officer,

respondent no. 2 and they were again medically examined. It is
not out of place to mention here that all of them had given their
educational qualifications in their respective application forms as
VIIIth Class.
respondents,

However, during enquiries conducted by the
it

transpired

that

actually

they

had

higher

educational qualifications i.e. upto XIIth pass. On this ground all
the petitioners were discharged. Under these circumstances, all
the petitioners have filed the above said three writ petitions
separately, with the prayer that the verbal order of respondent
no. 2 passed on 2.4.2004 by which the selection of the petitioners
on the post of Cooks was rejected be set aside and the above
said post be restored in their favour.
4.

Respondents have contested the above said writ petitions.

According to them the petitioners were called on 31.3.2004. The
candidates are expected to fill a form IN 441, the information
given in this form becomes part of their service record. In these
forms the petitioners reflected / filled their qualifications as XIIth
pass, thereby clearly indicating their malafide intentions that
they willfully and illegally concealed their higher qualifications in
the NMER entry application forms wherein they mentioned their

WP(C) Nos.5531/2004, 6402/2004 & 20083/2004

Page 3 of 8

educational qualifications as VIIIth pass with malafide intention of
circumventing the possible elimination at the stage of initial
screening process. It was pointed out that the selective amnesia
on the part of candidates is willful, deliberate and amounts to
declaration

of

false

information

in

the

application

forms

notwithstanding the declaration made by the petitioners in the
application forms that any false information rendered by them in
the application would make them liable for disqualification. It is
also pointed out that as stated by the petitioner viz. Deepak in his
petition that he is qualified upto class 12th in Art stream, whereas
during the investigation, he revealed his highest qualifications as
BA(IInd) year.

Again it was also averred that the minimum

educational qualifications for the post of „Cook‟ is Class Vth. The
forms submitted by the office of the respondents contained an
enclosure indicating the minimum qualifications for the post of
Cook is Class Vth. However, during the subsequent investigation
the petitioner viz. Deepak had stated that he had bought the
application form from market and read the qualifications required
for the post from a sign board in the shop.
5.

We have heard the counsel for the parties.

The record

clearly reveals that all the petitioners have indubitably made

WP(C) Nos.5531/2004, 6402/2004 & 20083/2004

Page 4 of 8

false statements in their respective application forms.

The

learned counsel for the petitioner laid emphasis on the point
whether the above said action of the petitioners would entail
extreme action taken by the respondents. He pointed out that a
distinction has to be drawn between the bonafide and malafide
intentions.

He submitted that the petitioners belong to a

backward area with uneducated families‟ background.

Due to

inadvertence and at the instructions of some employee in Indian
Navy Service, the petitioners wrote the minimum qualification as
8th Class which was required for the said post.

They had no

malafide intention to conceal their actual qualifications.

He

prayed that under these circumstances they should be reinstated
in the above said post.
6.

We see no merit in these arguments. Although, it is true

that a criterion which has the effect of denying a candidate his
right to be considered for the post on the principle that he is
having higher qualifications, than prescribed cannot be rational
and the candidates who possessed higher qualifications should
have also been considered, (see the law laid down in Mohd.
Riazul Usman Gani and others Vs. District & Sessions Judge,
Nagpur and others, AIR 2000 SC 919), yet, the controversy in the

WP(C) Nos.5531/2004, 6402/2004 & 20083/2004

Page 5 of 8

present case does not swirl over this question.

The main

question is that the petitioners have made false declarations
about

their

educational

qualifications

in

their

respective

application forms. The application forms clearly, specifically and
unequivocally stated that the following certificate would be filled
in by the petitioners :
“Certificate
1.
I hereby certify that the above information is true
to the best of my knowledge and belief and I
understand that I am liable to be disqualified, if any of
the above is found to be incorrect /incomplete. I also
understand that I will be attending the written,
physical fitness and medical test at my own risk and
will not be entitled to any claim arising thereof. All
documents have been tied up firmly.”
7.

It is, therefore, very easy to cull out mens rea on the part of

all the petitioners. Every violation of truth is not only a sort of
suicide in the liar, but it is a stab at the health of human society.
We clap considerable significance to the argument urged by
counsel for the respondent that the acts of the petitioners
highlight the element of doubtful integrity in their characters, a
trait, totally unacceptable in the ARMED FORCES. When Aristotle
was asked what a man could gain by telling a falsehood, he
replied, “Never to be credited when he speaks the truth.”

In the following authorities the petitioners were removed

from service for making a false statement. In these cases they
had suppressed the facts that the cases against them were
pending before the criminal courts.

In Kendriya Vidyalaya

Sangathan and others Vs. Ram Ratan Yadav, AIR 2003 SC 1709,
the State Government had withdrawn the case against the
petitioner. However, this fact was suppressed. The Apex Court
upheld the order of his termination from the service.

In R.

Radhakrishnan Vs. The Director General of Police and others,
2007 (12) SCALE 539, the petitioner had made a false statement
in his verification roll in regard to the pendency of a case. In that
case he was ultimately acquitted. His termination was upheld by
the Apex Court.
9.

Object of requiring information in various columns and

declaration forms thereafter from the candidate is to ascertain
and verify the character and antecedent to judge his suitability to
enter into or continue in service. When a candidate suppresses
material information and / or gives false information he cannot
claim any right of appointment or continuance in service
thereafter.

In view of the above said discussion all the writ petitions are

hereby dismissed. However, the parties are left to bear their own
costs.
