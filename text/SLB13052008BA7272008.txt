S. L. BHAYANA, J.
This is a petition filed under Section 439 read with
Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail to the
petitioner.
The allegations against the accused are that 600
grams

of

‘Charas’

has

been

recovered

from

his
1

possession.

It is admitted by both the parties that the

CFSL report has confirmed that the contraband received
from the petitioner was found to be ‘Cannabis’ (Charas).
In this case, three witnesses have been examined before
the trial court and nine witnesses have yet to be
examined. The case is likely to be disposed of in the near
future.
Keeping in view the serious allegations against the
petitioner, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner at
this stage.
Dismissed.
