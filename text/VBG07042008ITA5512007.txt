V.B.Gupta, J.
The Revenue has filed the present appeal under
Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short as
‘Act’) against order dated 15th September, 2006 passed
by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (herein after
referred as ‘Tribunal’) Delhi Bench ‘A’ in ITA No.2574
(Del)/2004 relevant for the assessment year 2001-02.
The Tribunal in its order held that there is absolutely
no material to link the Assessee with the sum of
Rs.29,97,000/- deposited in cash in the bank account of
M/s. FBSL.
2.

The facts of this case are that the Assessee is a

Private Limited company. During the previous year, it
had taken an unsecured loan of Rs. 25 lacs from M/s.
Aishwaray Capital Lease Finance Pvt. Ltd. (herein after
referred to as ACL). The Assessing Officer asked the
Assessee to file a copy of income tax return along with
the audited profit and loss account and the balance
sheet with annexures and copy of bank statement for
the period ending 31st March, 2001 of M/s. ACL. The
ITA No.551/2007

Assessee furnished the same accordingly. On perusal
of the bank statement of M/s. ACL, the Assessing
Officer

noticed

that

the

funds

were

transferred

through internal transfer on 28th March, 2001 to M/s.
ACL and then in the same manner in the bank account
of the Assessee company. The Assessing Officer called
for information from the bank under section 133(6) of
the Act to locate the true nature of these internal
transfer transactions and the exact source of funds. It
was revealed on the information furnished by the bank;
(a) that on 28th March, 2001 cash of Rs.22,97,000/- was
deposited in account no.4142 pertaining to M/s. Fair
Business Security and Leasing Pvt. Ltd. (herein after
referred to as FBSL)
(b) from this account no.4142 a sum of Rs.25 lacs was
transferred to account no.4016, which stood in the
name of M/s. Breeze Trade Links Pvt. Ltd. (herein after
referred to as BTL) on the same day

ITA No.551/2007

Page 3 of 8

(c) on the same day, Rs.25 lacs were transferred from
account no.4016 to M/s. ACL, having account no.4144
and
(d) on same day, i.e. 28th March, 2001, Rs.25 lacs were
transferred from account no.4144 from M/s. ACL to the
Assessee.
3.

The Assessing Officer also noticed that all the

three companies referred to above had the same
address, i.e. B-258, Naraina Industrial Area, Phase-I,
New Delhi. Further, no interest was charged by any of
these transferees. The Assessing Officer was thus of
the view that the entire transaction was a sham
transaction and asked the Assessee to show cause as to
why cash deposit of Rs.22,97,000/- made into the
account of M/s. FBSL be not added as the taxable
income

of

consideration.

the

Assessee

for

the

year

under

The Assessee submitted his reply and

filed confirmation from M/s. ACL. The Assessee also
submitted that the cash deposited by M/s. FBSL was

ITA No.551/2007

Page 4 of 8

not its money and that it was from the books of the
said company.
4.

The Assessing Officer however, held that it was

the Assessee’s money of Rs.22,97,000/- which was
deposited in cash into the account of M/s. FBSL and
the same was routed through different accounts and
received as unsecured loan by the Assessee company
and thus made an addition of Rs.25 lacs as unexplained
cash credit under Section 68 of the Act.
5.

On

appeal

filed

by

the

Assessee,

the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) (for short as
‘CIT[A]’) held that the Assessee had discharged its
burden

of

genuineness

proving
of

the

the

identity,

transaction

capacity

and

and

the

in

circumstances the addition made by the Assessing
Officer was not justified. It was also observed by the
CIT(A) that the Assessing Officer had not chosen to
issue summons to M/s. FBSL, M/s. ACL or M/s. BTL
before

coming

ITA No.551/2007

to

the

conclusion

that

all

the

Page 5 of 8

transactions were from and out of the money provided
by the Assessee.
6.

Being aggrieved by the order of CIT(A), the

Revenue preferred an appeal before the Tribunal and
vide impugned order the Tribunal dismissed the appeal
of the Assessee.
7.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

Revenue that the Assessee has used circular route to
receive the loan in its account and the same is merely
a device being used to evade tax and as such, loan is
taxable under Section 68 of the Act.
8.

There is a finding of fact given by the two

authorities namely CIT(A) and the Tribunal to the
effect that:“The confirmation of M/s. ACL has been
filed by the Assessee. The said company
was assessed to tax. The source of ACL
had been explained as out of transfer of
funds from the accounts of M/s. BTL.
Thus, the Assessee discharged its burden
of
proving
identity,
capacity
and
genuineness of the transaction.
The
Assessing Officer has not brought any
ITA No.551/2007

Page 6 of 8

material to show that the funds to ACL
were provided by the Assessee. Under
the circumstances, it cannot be said that
the cash credit in question has remained
unexplained.
There is absolutely no
material to link the Assessee with the
sum of Rs.22,97,000/- deposited in cash
in the bank account of M/s. FBSL.“

9.

In view of the concurrent findings of the fact

given by the two authorities that there is no material to
link the Assessee with a sum of Rs.22,97,000/deposited in cash in the bank account of M/s. FBSL, as
such, no case is made out for making addition under
Section 68 of the Act, since there was no material with
the Assessing Officer to come to the conclusion
regarding any genuineness or fictitious identity of the
entries or non capacity of the lender.
10. Under these circumstances, we do not find any
infirmity or perversity in the order passed by the
Tribunal and in our opinion no substantial question of
law arises in this case.

ITA No.551/2007

With the result, the present

appeal is not maintainable and the same is hereby
dismissed.
