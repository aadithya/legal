JUDGMENT
1.

The Petitioner, who was serving in the CRPF in the rank of

Constable, has been dismissed from service under Rule 5(1) of
Central Civil Services Temporary Service Rules, 1965 on
18.9.2002. This appointment was purely temporary and could
WP(C) 1446/2003

Page 1 of 5

be terminated without assigning any reasons.

2.

The Petitioner had to fill-up a Verification Roll in respect

of which it had been pointedly clarified that if any incorrect
information was furnished that would be sufficient reason for
removal from service. The Verification Roll had been filled-up
on 28.3.2001. In the Verification Roll, in response to the
question - “Have you ever been arrested, prosecuted, kept
under detention or bound down/fined, convicted, by a court of
law for any offense or debarred/disqualified by any Public
Service

Commission

examination/selections,

from
or

appearing

debarred

from

at

its

taking

any

examination/rusticated by any University or any other education
authority/Institution”

the

Petitioner

had

answered

in

the

negative. On clarification this answer was found to be incorrect
as is evident from a perusal of the letter dated 8.2.2002
addressed to the Addl. DIGP, CRPF, Shiv Puri (M.P.) by the Joint
Collector, District Bhind. On enquiry by the said officer it has
been revealed that FIR No. 205/97 u/s 323, 147, 294, 341,
506/B/IPC had been registered in the Police Station Bhind
against the Petitioner, and the Challan had been produced in the
Court. Eventually, the matter was compromised in the Court of
WP(C) 1446/2003

Page 2 of 5

the First Class Magistrate, Mehgaon on 26.9.1999. The Court
accepted the compromise, on the basis of which the accused
was acquitted.

3.

It is not possible to accept that the Petitioner could have

been oblivious of these facts.

4.

In Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan -vs- Ram Ratan Yadav,

2003(3) SCC 437 in the Attestation Form the employee had
stated that he had not been prosecuted or convicted by any
Court of any offence and that no case was pending against him
in any Court at the time of the filing of the Attestation Form.
Since these were found to be incorrect, he was dismissed from
service and this action was upheld by the Supreme Court.

5.

A similar view was taken by the Supreme Court in Ram

Saran -vs- IG of Police, CRPF, (2006) 2 SCC 541 where the
petitioner concealed his correct birth date and it was held thatThis is a case which does not deserve any leniency
otherwise it would be giving premium to a person who
admittedly committed forgery. In the instruction (GO
No.29 of 1993), it has been provided that whenever it is
found that a government servant who was not qualified
WP(C) 1446/2003

Page 3 of 5

or eligible in terms of the recruitment rules, etc. for
initial recruitment in service or had furnished false
information or produced a false certificate in order to
secure appointment should not be retained in service.

6.

An almost identical question had arisen before a Division

Bench of this Court in Yogesh Kumar Singh v. Union of India,
WP(C) No. 11460/2004, decided on 19th October, 2006. Our
learned brothers had dismissed the Petition in view of the
settled law.

We are in respectful agreement with that

Judgment. Where a Verification Roll has been wrongly filled up,
despite the caution contained at its very threshold, it would be
inappropriate for the Writ Court to exercise its extra-ordinary
jurisdiction.

7.

A Notice of Termination was issued on 19.8.2002, received

by the Petitioner on 22.8.2002, informing him that his services
would stand terminated with effect from the date of expiry of a
period of one month from the date on which the Notice was
served on the Petitioner.

8.

The Notice of Termination reads as follows:

WP(C) 1446/2003

Page 4 of 5

In pursuance of sub-rule (1) of Rule 5 of the
Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965
I C.S. Rathore Commandant-75 Bn, CRPF hereby give
notice to No.015281223 CT/GD Harnarain that his
services shall stand terminated with effect from the
date of expiry of a period of one month from the date
on which this notice is served on, or, as the case may
be tendered to him.
9.

A futile and ill-conceived effort has been made by learned

counsel for the Petitioner that the order is punitive and/or
stigmatic in nature and, therefore, would not fall within the
confines of Rule 5(1) (supra). We are unable to find any basis
for such an argument as the Termination Order has no
complexion of stigma or punishment attached thereto.

10.

Petition is without merit and is dismissed.
