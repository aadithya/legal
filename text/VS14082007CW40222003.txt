1.

Petitioner herein was appointed as a Direct Recruit

Assistant of 1985 and joined the Ministry of External Affairs with
effect from 8.1.1988.

He belongs to ST category.

Next

promotion is to the post of Integrated Grades -II and III of IFS (B)
WP(C) No.4022/2003

Page 1 of 5

which is governed by IFS (B) (RCSP) Rules 1964.

For this

promotion 8 years qualifying service is required in the grade of
Assistants.
2.

The petitioner completed 8 years service on 1.7.1996

and therefore became eligible to be considered for promotion to
the aforesaid post.

The cases of promotion to this post were

considered by the respondents in the year 1996 and select list
dated 14.11.1996 was circulated.
was not found in the said list.

The name of the petitioner
He, therefore, made a

representation to the Joint Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs,
and made other representations as well.

The petitioner was

ultimately promoted to this post in the year 1998-99.
3.

The petitioner claims that he was wrongly ignored in

the select list of 14.11.1996, as by the relevant time he had
rendered qualifying service and was therefore eligible to be
considered for promotion.
4.
Central

With this plea he filed the OA No.979/2000 before the
Administrative

Tribunal.

However,

the

Central

Administrative Tribunal vide order dated 26th March, 2001
dismissed the said OA, though on that date counsel for the
petitioner could not appear.

The petitioner, therefore, filed

Review Application No. 36/2001 on 21.12.2001 which has also
WP(C) No.4022/2003

Page 2 of 5

been dismissed by the Tribunal on 4.3.2002.
5.

In these circumstances, feeling aggrieved by the

orders passed in OA as well as in the Review Application, the
present petition has been filed.
6.

There is no dispute about the aforesaid facts on the

basis of which petitioner laid his claim for promotion. However,
as per the respondent, only one person belonging to ST Category
could be accommodated, and since there was another person,
namely, one Mr. R.S. Antil, a ST candidate who was senior to the
petitioner who was available, he was given the promotion and
petitioner could not be accommodated in that year.
7.

This Court had given directions to the respondent to

place on record the vacancy position, as the contention of the
petitioner was that there were 2 vacancies available in that year
(in the ST category).

Pursuant to those directions, the

respondent had filed the table showing the vacancy position in
the reserve categories as well as total posts available and
manned by the incumbents.
8.

It is not disputed by Mr. Suresh Kait, learned Standing

Counsel appearing for the respondent that there were 2
vacancies in the ST category available in the year 1995-96.
However, his submission is that in the meantime, Constitutional
WP(C) No.4022/2003

Page 3 of 5

Bench of Supreme Court had delivered judgment in the case of
R.K. Sabharwal vs. Union of India (1995) 2 SCC 745 as per
which the promotions were to be made on the basis of posts
available and these were not vacancy based. He further points
out that as on that date, i.e., in the year 1996-97 the total
number of vacancies under ST category were 11, and 10 persons
belonging to ST category were already in position and therefore,
as per the mandate of the Supreme Court in R. K. Sabharwal's
case when the promotions were to be post based only, and there
was only one post available in ST category, only one promotion
under that reserved category could be made. This is explained
in the counter affidavit filed by the respondent, operative portion
whereof reads as follows:“ It is submitted that in the present context, the
vacancy based roster and not the post based
roster was applied in respect of STs in year 199697 as there was under representation of STs to
the extent of 1 in this year. This was in line with
directions of the apex court in the Sabharwal
case which stated that in any category where
there is an under representation, vacancy based
rosters will be followed till such time as the
shortfall is met. Now presuming that post based
roster was to be followed in the year 1996-97
going by Shri Mina's line of reasoning, then as
indicated in chart below, only 1 slot could have
been earmarked for STs and no more. In the
subsequent recruitment year, STs were in
occupation of slots earmarked for them and,
therefore, no slot was reserved :WP(C) No.4022/2003

DP – Departmental promotee
Although, STs were in prescribed strength in DP
posts filled through General Assistants Channel,
but there was an overall shortage of 1 ST in the
departmental promotions mode and therefore, 1
vacancy was reserved for ST which was filled by
the petitioner.”
Since the respondents have made the promotions in

accordance with the directions contained in R. K. Sabharwal's
case (supra), we cannot find any fault in this exercise of the
respondent. Therefore, the present petition being devoid of any
merit is hereby dismissed.
