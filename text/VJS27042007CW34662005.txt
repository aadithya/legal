On the hearing held on 22.1.2007 we had, after

hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties, put it
to learned counsel for the Petitioner that the NoticeeDirector of the Company ought to have approached
directly.

Learned

counsel

for

the

Respondent

had

vehemently contended that the Notice is not addressed to
the Petitioner herein but to an individual, namely, Shri V.K.
Modi and adopting of this course was legally competent
rather than take any remedial action. Learned counsel for
the Petitioner has only repeated all the submissions made
by him on the last date of hearing.

3.

In brief, the submission of Shri Sheshagiri, learned

counsel for the Petitioner, is that the Petitioner has
approached the BIFR. As on date its Reference has been
registered.

Reliance has been placed on the decision in

Tata Davy Ltd. -vs- State of Orissa, (1997) 6 SCC 669
which, however, does not advance the case of the Petitioner
since in the present case Notice has not been issued to the
Petitioner but to a third party albeit a Director of the
Company. We also find no justification in Mr. Seshagiri's
CW3466.2005

page 3 of 6

reliance on the views expressed by one of us (Vikramajit
Sen, J.) in Industrial Development Bank of India Ltd. -vs-

Company Law Board, (2006) 5 Comp LJ 444(Del) in respect
of discussion of a person falling within the sweep of the
term 'aggrieved person'. The observations made were in
totally different circumstances.

The simple fact is that

Shri V.K. Modi could have and ought to have approached
this Court directly.

Prima facie, however, we are of the

view that the proper recourse would have been to appear
before the Officer who issued the impugned Notice and
to present to him the stand preferred before us. The Writ
Court should not be used as a device to by-pass the
obvious and logical course of action.

4.

Our attention has correctly been drawn to the

decision in Kailash Nath Agarwal -vs- Pradeshiya Industrial

& Investment Corporation of U.P. Ltd., (2003) 4 SCC 305 in
which it has been opined that the object of the Sick
Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 is the
facilitation

of

rehabilitation

or

winding

up

of

sick

companies and not the protection of any other person or
CW3466.2005

page 4 of 6

body.

Learned counsel for the Respondent has placed

reliance on the following three Judgments of the Division
Bench of the Allahabad High Court:(1)

Naresh

Chander

Gupta

-vs-

The

District

Magistrate, 2003 NTN (Vol.23)-358
(2) Sri Ram Gupta -vs- The Assistant Collector, 2003
NTN (Vol.23)-995
(3) Sri Ram Shyam Shukla -vs- Assistant Collector,

Collection of Trade Tax, 2004 NTN (Vol.25)-768

5.

In all these cases the U.P. Trade Tax Act, 1948 had

been invoked for the recovery of outstanding taxes. The
Bench observed that such cases justify lifting of the
corporate veil; that the concept of the corporate personality
was evolved to encourage trade and business and not for
committing illegality or defrauding the exchequer.

6.

It is trite that the exercise of writ jurisdiction must

always be predicated on equity. In the present case MRL
has collected Sales Tax but has not deposited it with the
State. It is thus guilty of breach of trust since all monies
collected by it towards Sales Tax should have been made
CW3466.2005

page 5 of 6

over to the State. These are not ordinary commercial
dealings. The circumstances of the case, therefore, do not
warrant the exercise of the extraordinary powers vested in
this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
even if MRL is held to be competent of filing the present
Petition.

7.

However, the impugned Notice has been issued to

Shri V.K. Modi.

It is he who should have come forward

either in these proceedings or before the Sales Tax
Department, with the submission that the recoveries cannot
be made personally from him in respect of dues of the
Company. We see no reason to interfere in the matter.

8.

Petition is dismissed.
