The Petitioner has filed this Writ Petition under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India seeking a writ of certiorari for quashing
the order dated 24th September 2007 passed by Appellate
Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, New Delhi
(AAIFR) in Appeal No.194 of 2002 along with MA No. 116/2007
dated 24th September 2007 and the order dated 10th October

2006 passed in MA No.210/2006. The effect of these orders is
that

the

land

of

the

Respondent

No.3

Sick

Company

admeasuring about 205 Acres in Khapoli, Maharashtra as been
permitted to be sold to Respondent No.5 for an amount of Rs.18
crores, and the application of the petitioner for recall of the said
permission has been dismissed. The Petitioner also seeks
direction to the AAIFR to accept the bid of Rs.28 crore or in the
alternative direct the sale of the said land at Khapoli in District
Raigarh, Maharashtra to be carried out in transparent manner by
following the procedure prescribed by law.

2.

To appreciate the controversy raised in this petition the
necessary facts may first be stated. Respondent No. 3, Reliance
Silicones (I) Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as 'the company') is
an industrial company engaged in the business of, inter alia,
manufacture and sale in India and abroad of various chemicals,
generally called 'silicones'. Respondent No. 3 became a sick
company. Its case was referred to Board for Industrial Financial
Reconstruction and was registered as Case No.30/1996. The
AAIFR sanctioned a revival scheme of the company on 29th
August 2000 stipulating the settlement of dues of secured
creditors, i.e. IDBI, UTI and Central Bank of India (CBI) in the
following manner under a one time settlement (OTS) :-

3.

IDBI
:
10.52 crore
UTI
:
1 crore
CBI
:
19.33 crore
The aforesaid three financial institutions had a charge over one
of the assets of the company situated at Vashi, Maharashtra.
The company settled the dues of IDBI and UTI in full and also
paid an amount of Rs.15.72 crore to CBI. However, since the

WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 2 of 24

entire amount under the settlement was not paid to CBI,
disputes emerged regarding the payment terms and settlement.
The CBI proceeded to walk out of the settlement, which was
objected to by the company. The BIFR vide its order dated 5th
April 2002 restrained CBI from canceling the OTS unilaterally
since the company had already made substantial payments.
Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of BIFR dated 5th April 2002,
CBI preferred appeal No.194/2002 before the AAIFR claiming
the entire principal alongwith the interest and damages.
4.

During the pendency of the aforesaid appeal, the company
entered into negotiations with CBI. CBI agreed to accept an
amount of Rs.4.75 crore in full and final settlement of its dues
(apart from the amount of Rs.15.72 crore already received by it).
The company was the owner of vast tracks of land ad-measuring
about 205 acres situated at Khapoli in the State of Maharashtra.
It appears that this land was also given a security to other
secured creditors namely, Bombay Mercantile Cooperative Bank
Ltd., PEN Cooperative Urban Bank Ltd. and UTI Bank Ltd. While
the appeal was pending, the company, while negotiating with
the CBI, as aforesaid, identified a buyer namely M/s. Karma
Infrastructure

&

Development

Company

(KIDC),

who

are

Respondent No. 5 herein, for a sale of its aforesaid asset at
Khapoli for a total sale consideration of Rs.18.45 crore. The
manner of distribution of aforesaid amount of Rs.18.45 crores
was mutually agreed between the company and the respondent
No. 5 was as follows:
CBI, Respondent No. 4

Rs.4.75 crore

Bombay Mercantile Cooperative Bank
Ltd., Respondent No. 8

Rs.5.60 crore

PEN Cooperative Urban Bank Ltd.,
Respondent No. 9
UTI Bank Ltd, Respondent No. 7

5.

Rs.2.75 crore
Rs.4.00 crore

The aforesaid amounts were to be paid to CBI, (Respondent No.
4), Bombay Mercantile Cooperative Bank Ltd., (Respondent No. 8)
and PEN Cooperative Urban Bank Ltd., (Respondent No. 9) in full
and final settlement of their dues, whereas the amount to be
paid to the UTI Bank Ltd. of Rs.4 crore was in settlement of the
dues of UTI Bank Ltd. from out of the said property at Khapoli.
Apart from the aforesaid amounts, Respondent No. 5 had also
advanced a sum of Rs.15 lakhs to the company. The company
and the respondent No.5 entered into a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) dated 7th September 2006, wherein, inter
alia, the aforesaid terms were recorded. This Memorandum of
Understanding was subject to, inter alia, the consent and
permission being granted by AAIFR/BIFR for the sale and
transfer of the said property.

6.

After entering into the aforesaid MOU, the company moved to
AAIFR by filing M.A.No. 210/2006 in the aforesaid appeal of the
CBI, whereby it sought permission from AAIFR to sell its land
situated at Khapoli for making payment of dues to CBI, Bombay
Mercantile Cooperative Bank Ltd. and PEN Cooperative Urban
Bank Ltd. It appears that the aforesaid MOU was not placed
before the AAIFR when the aforesaid application being MA
No.210/2006 was filed by the company. It also

appears that

before the AAIFR Respondent No. 3/company represented that
the land at Khapoli was proposed to be sold to Respondent No.
5 for an amount of Rs.18 crore (as opposed to Rs.18.45 crores
as agreed under the Memo of Understanding). In its order dated
WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 4 of 24

10th October 2006, the AAIFR while allowing the said application
of the company recorded the arrangement proposed by it and
the secured creditors as follows:
“At a result of these simultaneous efforts launched by the
applicant company the following results have taken place:
i)

under its letter dated 25.8.2006 CBI has arrived at
afresh OTS of Rs.475 cr with interest @ BPLR to be
paid within a period of one month from the date of
sanction.

ii)

BMCBL under its letter dated 7.8.2006 have agreed
to:
a)

the sale of Khapoli land;

b)
and settlement of their dues of

Rs.560

iii)

PCBL have agreed to the same and has agreed for
the settlement of its dues of Rs.275 crores.

iv)

UTI Bank under its letter dated 4.9.2006 has:
a)

given its no objection to the sale;

b)
agreed to accept an mount of Rs.4 crores out
of the sale of the land and the creation of a charge
on the Vashi Plant. This new charge will be created
once the charge thereon is released by CBI which
will take place once the above stated payment is
effected.
v)

A company called M/s. Karma Infrastructure and
Development Company has been identified which
will buy the land for an amount of Rs.18 crores.
This 18 crore therefore shall be distributed as

under the settlement to CBI, Bombay Mercantile Cooperative
Bank Ltd., PEN Cooperative Urban Bank Ltd. in full and final
settlement of their respective claims and an amount of Rs.4
crores to UTI in terms of the settlement reflected in the
memorandum of understanding. Respondent No. 5 also paid
further amounts in discharge of liabilities of Sales Tax and dues
of the workman of the company. According to Respondent No. 5,
as opposed to an amount of Rs.18 crores payable by it (as
represented before the AAIFR), it had paid the following further
amounts, thereby making a total amount of Rs.21,80,42,180/- :5.

We may at this stage itself note that as per the impugned order
of the AAIFR, the total amount claimed to have been paid by
Respondent No. 5 for the land came to Rs.23.36 crores, which is
now computed as Rs.21,80,452,180.

9.

While the aforesaid transaction was in the process of being
completed, the Petitioner, it appears, came as a bolt from the
blue and moved the AAIFR by filing M.A.No.116/2007 claiming
itself to be a shareholder of the company to the extent of over
49% shares and seeking recall of the order of the AAIFR dated
10th October 2006 whereby the AAIFR had permitted the sale of
the property of the company at Khapoli to Respondent No. 5.
The Petitioner stated that it had procured an offer for purchase
of the said land at much higher price. While entertaining the

WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 6 of 24

Petitioner's application which was moved on or about 22nd March
2007, the AAIFR did not stay its earlier order dated 10th October
2006 as aforesaid. The Petitioner aggrieved by the refusal to
stay its order dated 10 th October 2006 by the AAIFR filed W.P. (C)
No. 2594/2007 seeking quashing of the said order dated 10th
October 2006 with further directions to AAIFR to consider the
offers made by third parties for the property at Khapoli and for a
hearing before the AAIFR as a shareholder.
10.

The aforesaid Writ Petition came up for hearing on 4th April 2007
and was disposed of on that day. The relevant extract of the
order reads as follows :“The main plank of the submissions of Mr. P.V. Kapur,
learned senior counsel is that the said sale is sought to
be completed without proper valuation of the land in
auction being held and is, therefore, detrimental and
prejudicial to the interests of the company as it does not
secure for the company the realizable value of the
assets. He also questions the jurisdiction of AAIFR to
have passed the impugned order.
Mr. Kapur states that the petitioners have buyers, who
are willing to purchase the said lands for a sum of Rs.28
crores and are willing to make good this offer. Learned
counsel for respondent No.3 Ms.Manisha Dhir raised a
number of objections to this submission and submitted
that it was a malafide attempt to subvert the transaction,
which already stood completed inasmuch that after the
agreement, the entire amount of Rs.18 crores had been
received and paid to the various creditors including the
Central Bank of India (CBI)(Rs.4.77 crores), Bombay
Mercantile Cooperative Bank (BML) (Rs.5.60 crores), Pen
cooperative Bank Ltd. (Rs.2.75 crores), UTI Bank Ltd.
(Rs.4.00 crores) and an additional sum of Rs.4.17 crores
had also been paid to the Sale Tax Authority for
obtaining the 'No Objection Certificate” for the sale.
Another sum of Rs.85-90 lacs has been paid to the
workers.
Therefore, she submits, that the entire sale
consideration has been received and directly paid to the
creditors bank. In these circumstances, the proposal is
a belated one and being made malafide only to subvert
the completion of transaction and the plans of the
respondent No.3 company to come back on rails.
As regards the completion of transaction, counsel for the
petitioner has stated that only possession of about 40
acres appears to have been handed over while
possession of remaining land has not been handed over.

WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 7 of 24

Besides, no Conveyance Deed has been executed till
date. Counsel for the petitioner also places reliance on
“Divya Manufacturing Company (Pvt.) Ltd. Vs. Union Bank
of India & Ors.” reported at (2000) 6 SCC 69 in support
of the contention that intervention by the Court could be
made even at the stage of confirmation of sale or beyond
that when required in the public interest or in the
interests of company. Learned counsel for respondent
No.3 submits that the said authority would not be
applicable and she fully supports the order passed by the
AIIFR. Petitioner, it was contended had deliberately not
impleaded the purchaser M/s Karma Infrastructure
Development Co. The appeal is stated to be pending
before the AAIFR and is listed on 17th April, 2007
including the application for impleadment.
We do not, at this stage, wish to express any opinion on
the rival contentions urged before us. The question
which the Court is presently considering is the prayer
made by the petitioner for preserving and utilization of
the assets, to the advantage of the company in the
meanwhile. Learned counsel for the petitioner has urged
that the offer made by the petitioner is a bona fide one
and there should really be no objection to a higher offer
being accepted in the interests of the company and
which was for the benefit of all. Petitioner states that
within one week from today, they would deposit a sum of
Rs.28 crores vide a bank draft with the AAIFR to
demonstrate the bona fide nature of their offer.
In view of the foregoing and having considered the facts
and circumstances as noted above, we are of the view
that status quo be retained with regard to the sale of the
said lands and assets till 11th April, 2007 when the
petitioner has undertaken to make the deposit of Rs.28
crores with the AAIFR. We make it clear that in case
Rs.28 crores are deposited on or before 4.00 p.m on
11th April 2007, the present order of status quo shall
automatically stand vacated, without reference to the
Court.
The order passed today would not come in the way of the
AAIFR dealing with the matter on merits and passing
appropriate orders after hearing the parties.

11.

The writ petition stands disposed of with the above
directions.”

Consequently, the petitioner was permitted to deposit an
amount of Rs.28 crore with the AAIFR within one week, i.e. by
the 11th of April 2007. On 11th April 2007, the Petitioner
tendered before the AAIFR a Bankers' Draft bearing No.604052
drawn on HDFC Bank for Rs.28 crores, drawn in favour of AAIFR.
The Petitioner in its forwarding letter, inter alia, stated as
follows :-

WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 8 of 24

“It is respectfully submitted that the enclosed Bankers
Draft may be encashed simultaneously with the handing
over of the possession of land and execution and
registration of Conveyance Deed in respect of the total
extent of land (ad measuring approx. 205 acres) owned by
M/s. Reliance Silicones (I) Pvt. Ltd. and situated at Khapoli
in Maharashtra. We would request that the aforesaid
process may be kindly expedited.”

12.

The matter was taken up by the AAIFR on 25th June 2007 when
the following order was passed by it:
“Heard the parties. In pursuance of Hon'ble Delhi High
Court's order dated 4.4.2007 in writ petition 2594 of
2007 filed by M/s.Hargreaves Investment Ltd., a deposit
of Rs.28 crore by a Banker's Draft No.604052 dated
11.4.2007 was received on behalf of the prospective
buyer identified by M/s. Hargreaves Investment Ltd for
the purchase of the Khapoli land (205 acres) owned by
M/s. Reliance Silicones (I) Pvt. Ltd.
2.
AAIFR does not have a Bank Account. Keeping in
view the need to prevent loss of interest by consent of
the parties we return the Bankers Draft dated 11.4.2007
for Rs.28 crore received from Law Consult Advocates of
M/s.Hargreaves Investment Ltd. and direct that the said
amount be kept in HDFC Bank Kailash Building, Delhi in
a separate interest bearing Escrow Account within one
week from the date of this order in the name of M/s.
Hargreaves investment Ltd.: - AAIFR – M/s. Reliance
Silicones (I) Pvt. Ltd. without prejudice to the parties. We
further direct M/s. Hargreaves investment to give an
undertaking while opening the Escrow Account that the
said amount shall not be withdrawn till a final decision is
taken in Appeal 194/02 and MA 116/2007.
3.
M.A. No.20/07 is filed by M/s. Vinod Trading
Corporation, M.A. No. 116/07 is filed by M/s.
Hargreaves investment Ltd. Both these M.A.s were
admitted on 20.4.2007.
4.
M.A. No. 163/07 and M.A. No. 169/07 filed by
Karma Infrastructure and Development Company for
direction/impleadment and M.A. No. 233/07 filed by
M/s. Achintya Exports (P) Ltd. the prospective buyer of
Khapoli Asset are admitted, without prejudice to the
rights and contentions of any of the parties.
5.
The main appeal No.194/02 alongwith M.A. No.
20/07, 116/07, 163/07, M.A. No. 169/07 and M.A.
233/07 will be heard on 24.7.07.”

13.

The Petitioner moved M.A. No.299 of 2007 before the AAIFR to
seek extension of time frame for compliance of AAIFR order
dated 25th June 2007 by further period of two weeks effective

WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 9 of 24

from 2nd July 2007. The Petitioner had sought extension of time
on the ground that on account of the heavy rains in Mumbai, it
had not been possible for the Petitioner to open the Escrow
account as earlier directed by AAIFR. This application was taken
up by AAIFR on 6th July 2007. In the course of the hearing, it was
informed to AAIFR that the amount of Rs.28 crores was now
lying deposited in the account of the proposed buyers and that
there was no loss of interest. The AAIFR consequently, disposed
of M.A.No.299/2007 which, inter alia, read as under :“The Ld. Counsel for the applicant confirmed that the
money is now in the account of the proposed buyer and
that there is no loss of interest. Since the main appeal
194/02 filed by Central Bank of India is listed for
24.7.2007, we do not consider it necessary to pass any
order in the M.A. The M.A.No.299/2007 thus stands
disposed of.”

14.

Thereafter, the appeal was heard by the AAIFR on different dates
and parties also filed written synopsis of their arguments.

The

AAIFR has vide impugned orders dated 24.9.2007 dismissed the
MA No. 116/2007 and disposed of the appeal holding that sine
the High Court in its order dated 4.4.2007 had not set aside the
earlier order dated 10.10.2006 passed by the AAIFR, there was
no question to reconsider the same as AAIFR does not have the
power under SICA to review its own orders. The perusal of the
impugned judgment would further indicate that the AAIFR has,
inter alia, taken the view that – (i) it did not have the power to
review its own orders; (ii) that the applicant/petitioner has failed
to show that the price offered by M/s. Karma Infrastructure &
Development

Company

was

unreasonable;

(iii)

that

the

petitioner, as a shareholder, had no locus to challenge the order
permitting the sale; and (iv) that there was no infirmity in the

WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 10 of 24

order and that the applicant/ petitioner had not deposited the
sum of Rs.28 crores in terms of the orders dated 4.4.2007
passed by this Hon'ble Court. The AAIFR, accordingly, dismissed
MA No. 116/2007 as devoid of merits.

Further, appeal No.

194/2002 was disposed of in terms of the settlement arrived at
between the company and the Central Bank of India.
15.

Assailing this order the present writ petition is preferred by the
petitioner. The main thrust is that the order dated 10.10.2006
was obtained by fraud, suppression of facts and that there was
no transparency as required under SICA for sale of the
properties of the Sick Company. No valuation was carried out;
public auction was not conducted and the offer of M/s. Karma
Infrastructure and Development Company was not the market
value of the property.

It was also contended that the order

dated 10.10.2006 should be reviewed in view of the orders
passed by this Court and in order to secure the highest offer for
the company in order to benefit the revival scheme of the Sick
Company and its creditors. Further, the petitioner's offer being
Rs.10 crores above the offer of the prospective buyer, the same
should have been accepted. It is also stressed that if the sale,
as permitted under the order dated 10.10.2006, is allowed to
take place, the Sick Company would be bound to sell its valuable
assets by way of distress sale which would be detrimental to the
interest of the Sick Company, its creditors and shareholders
thereby affecting the implementation of the Sanctioned Scheme
and causing losses to the Sick Company to the tune of almost
Rs.10 crores, notwithstanding the fact that the petitioner, being
the largest shareholder, would be deprived from participating in
WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 11 of 24

the decision-making of the Sick Company, more particularly with
regard to proper implementation of the rehabilitation scheme,
keeping in mind the interest of the company, its creditors,
shareholders, labour etc.
16.

The respondent Nos. 3 & 5 have contested this writ petition,
whereas respondent No.6, namely, M/s. Achantya Exports Pvt.
Ltd., has supported the case of the petitioner by joining the
prayer for setting aside of the sale in question.

17.

Before addressing the core issue, we may take note of some of
the preliminary submissions raised by the respondent Nos. 3 & 5
to the maintainability of this petition. In the first instance, it is
stated that there was inordinate delay on the part of the
petitioner in approaching the AAIFR for relief, which would show
that the petitioner is not interested in the revival of the
respondent No.3 company and this petition lacks bona fide and
is opportunistic. In this behalf, it is contended that the company
was declared a sick industrial unit on 27.8.1996. The petitioner
who claims to have become a shareholder of the company in or
around the year 2003 did not take any steps for the revival or
the rehabilitation of the company though it had been going
through severe financial crisis and was under liabilities of
several

secured

creditors,

sales-tax

authorities

and

its

employees. It is also pointed out that the respondent No.5 had
issued public notices in Economic Times and Free Press Journal
on 3.1.2007 and in a Marathi newspaper, Ratnagiri Times
(Taigad) on 5.1.2007, but no objections whatsoever were
received from the petitioner in response to those notices.
According to the respondent No.5, this shows that the petitioner
WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 12 of 24

had been waiting behind the scene as a masked phantom for the
respondent no. 5 to work the sanctioned scheme, settle and
clear the dues and the encumbrances affecting the larger land
by holding several rounds of meetings, negotiations and
discussions with banks and financial institutions and expending
considerable time, effort, money and energy.

After that is

achieved with considerable efforts, the petitioner is now trying
to piggy back on the efforts made by the respondent No.5 in
making the title of the larger land clear and marketable and free
from encumbrances.

It is also submitted that the respondent

No.5 is the bona fide purchaser of the land and in the aforesaid
backdrop this Court should not interfere with the order passed
by the AAIFR permitting sale of the said land to the respondent
No.5 at Rs.18 crores after taking into consideration of the
relevant facts.
18.

We may say that there are inter se disputes between the
petitioner and the company about the validity of the petitioner’s
claim to have become the shareholder of the company and the
matter is pending in this behalf in the other forum. Therefore,
we are not required to consider the same or comment
thereupon.

In the present case, we are concerned with the

validity of the order dated 10.10.2006 whereby AAIFR has
permitted sale of 205 acres of land belonging to the company to
the respondent No.5 as well as order dated

24.9.2007

upholding that sale. After the order dated 10.10.2006 passed
in MA 210/2006, the petitioner herein had moved application
No. 194/2002 on 23.2.2007 challenging that sale and making
an offer of Rs.13.65 lacs per acre, i.e. approximately Rs. 28
WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 13 of 24

crores.

Therefore, it cannot be said that there was any

substantial delay in taking steps to challenge the said order
permitting sale of the land of the company to the respondent
No.5. No doubt, the application was filed six months after the
permission to sale was granted and effect thereof shall be
considered by us at the appropriate stage. What is emphasized
at this juncture is that the writ petition cannot be dismissed on
the ground of alleged delay. It is more so when for want of any
orders on the said application, the petitioner had on an earlier
occasion filed Writ Petition No. 2594/2007 challenging orders
dated 10.10.2006, which was disposed of by this Court on
4.4.2007 directing the AAIFR to deal with the matter on merits
after hearing the parties and in view of that order the AAIFR has
now passed orders dated 24.9.2007 which is challenged by filing
the present petition immediately thereafter on 29.9.2007.
Therefore, there is hardly any ground to say that this petition
suffers from delays and laches.

19.

Learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 3 & 5 have also
contended that there was a non-compliance by the petitioner of
orders dated 4.4.2007 passed by this Court in Writ Petition No.
2594/2007 as it failed to deposit a sum of Rs. 28 crores with the
respondent No.1 to demonstrate its bona fide and for this
reason also this petition be not taken up on merits.

20.

We are not persuaded by this argument as well. We are of the
opinion that the petitioner has rightly demonstrated its bona

WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 14 of 24

fides in making its endeavour to comply with the said order and
there is a substantial compliance thereof.

As already noted

above, within one week of the said order, i.e. on 11.4.2007, the
petitioner had tendered before the AAIFR a banker’s draft drawn
on HDFC Bank in the sum of Rs. 28 crores. It was the inability of
the AAIFR to accept the said bank draft, which is clear from the
AAIFR’s own order dated 25.6.2007 recording that it does not
have a bank account and for this reason, with the consent of the
parties, the said draft was returned with direction to keep the
amount in HDFC Bank, Kailash Building, Delhi in a separate
interest bearing escrow account. No doubt, this amount could
not be deposited within the time permitted by the AAIFR and the
petitioner had moved MA seeking extension of time. When the
matter came up before the AAIFR again on 6.7.2007, it was
confirmed that the amount had already been deposited with the
account and there was no loss of interest. Taking note of this
fact, the AAIFR did not consider it necessary to pass any order
on the MA.

In view of this, we also do not agree with the

observation of the AAIFR in its order dated 24.9.2007 that the
petitioner had not deposited the amount in terms of order dated
4.4.2007 passed by this Court in making it one of the reasons to
dismiss the MA filed by the petitioner herein.
21.

It is also argued by learned counsel for the respondent Nos. 3 &
5 that in its MA No. 116/2007 filed before the AAIFR, the
petitioner had failed to disclose its locus; it cannot claim any
rights in the assets of the company; and the conduct of the
petitioner is mala fide. These submissions flow on the premise

WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 15 of 24

that though the petitioner claims to be a shareholder, but no
documents have been annexed by the petitioner in support of
the claim and further that as the petitioner is not a shareholder,
it has no right in the assets of the company as well.
22.

We state at the cost of repetition that these are the issues which
can be adjudicated upon in the appropriate proceedings
pending before the Company Law Board. In the present case, we
are concerned with the validity of the orders of the AAIFR
permitting sale of the land of the company to the respondent
No.5. Even if the petitioner was an outsider and had questioned
the sale on the ground that it was for an insufficient
consideration and the market value of the property was higher,
the AAIFR was duty bound to look into this aspect.

The

company is a sick company and had approached BIFR for its
revival.

The scheme had been sanctioned.

In order to

implement the said scheme and pay up the creditors, need was
felt to sell the aforesaid land of the company. However, when it
is decided to sell the land and permission of the BIFR and/or
AAIFR is required for this purpose, it is the solemn duty and
obligation of these authorities to ensure that sale to the
prospective buyer is done in an appropriate manner and the
property

of

a

sick

company

fetches

price

commensurating with market value thereof. The Supreme Court
has laid down this principle in the case of Divya Manufacturing
Co. (P) Ltd. & Anr. v. Union Bank of India & Ors., (2000) 6 SCC
69, following its earlier judgment in the case of LICA (P) Ltd. v.
The Official Liquidator & Anr. reported in (1995) 4 CCJ 494
(SC).

The principle which would govern the outcome of such

WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 16 of 24

cases is contained in paras 11 to 15 of the Apex Court judgment
in Divya Manufacturing (supra), which are reproduced below :“11. In our view, on facts it is apparent that the Division
Bench of the High Court has considered all the relevant
facts including the fact that at the initial stage, the
appellant “Divya” offered only Rs.37 lakhs to purchase the
properties.
That means, the appellant wanted to
purchase at a throwaway price.
Thereafter, at the
intervention of the Court, the price was increased to Rs.
1.3 crores by the appellant. This indicates that the
appellant was keen to purchase the property, however by
paying only the bare minimal amount and to take
advantage of sale by the Liquidator in the hope that if
there are no other purchasers, it would purchase the
Company at a price which is abnormally below the market
price. It is also true that on 2-7-1998, the offer made by
the appellant was accepted and it was ordered that sale
in its favour be confirmed, but at the same time, before
possession of the property could be handed over, or
before the sale deed could be executed in its favour,
Respondents 7 and 8 pointed out that the assets and
properties could be sold at Rs. 2 crores. For showing
their bona fides, they were directed to deposit Rs. 40
lakhs each and also to pay Rs. 70 thousand each as
damages to the appellant. Further, the application for
setting aside the sale was filed within a few days of the
order accepting the bid of the appellant. In this set of
circumstances, when correct market value of the assets
was not properly known to the Court and the sale was
confirmed at a grossly inadequate price, it was open to
the Court to set it at naught in the interest of the
Company, its secured and unsecured creditors and its
employees. The appellant is also duly compensated by
payment of Rs. 70 thousand each by Respondents 7 and
8.
12. The law on this subject is well settled. In the case
of Navalkha and Sons, (1969) 3 SCC 537 after the
appellant's offer was accepted, a fresh offer from one
Gopaldas Darak for higher amount was received by
setating that he could not offer in time because he came
to know of the sale only 2 days prior to the date of the
application and there was possibility of higher bids.
Instead of directing a fresh auction or calling for fresh
offers, the learned Judge though it proper to arrange an
open bid in the Court itself on that very day as between
M/s. Navalkha and the higher offeror Gopaldas Darak.
M/s. Navalkha thereafter offered higher bid at
Rs.8,82,000 and its bid was accepted and the learned
Judge concluded the sale in its favour with a direction to
pay the balance amount. Thereafter an application was
filed offering Rs.10 lakhs. A contention was raised that
due publicity of the sale of the property was not made,
but that application was rejected by the Court. Hence, an
appeal was filed by the applicant who made an offer of
Rs. 10 lakhs and another by one contributory against the
order of confirmation. Both appeals were allowed by the
Division Bench and the order passed by the learned Judge
WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 17 of 24

was set aside with a direction to take fresh steps for sale
of the property either by calling sealed tenders or by
auction in accordance with law.
That order was
challenged before this Court by M/s. Navalkha. It was
contended that there was no justification for the Division
Bench to interfere with the order of the learned Single
Judge. In that context, after quoting Rule 273 of the
Companies (Court) Rules, 1959, the Court observed :
(SCC pp. 540-41, para 6)
“6.
The
principles
which
should
govern
confirmation of sales are well established. Where
the acceptance of the offer by the Commissioners
is subject to confirmation of the court the offeror
does not by mere acceptance get any vested right
in the property so that he may demand automatic
confirmation of his offer.
The condition of
confirmation by the court operates as a safeguard
against the property being sold at inadequate
price whether or not it is a consequence of any
irregularity or fraud in the conduct of the sale. In
every case it is the duty of the court to satisfy
itself that having regard to the market value of the
property the price offered is reasonable. Unless
the court is satisfied about the adequacy of the
price the act of confirmation of the sale would not
be a proper exercise of judicial discretion. In
Gordhan Das Chuni Lal Dakuwala v. T. Sirman
Kanthimathinatha Pillai, AIR 1921 Mad 286 : 24
MLW 35, it was observed that where the property
is authorised to be sold by private contract or
otherwise it is the duty of the court to satisfy itself
that the price fixed is the best that could be
expected to be offered. That is because the court
is the custodian of the interest of the company
and its creditors and the sanction of the court
required under the Companies Act has to be
exercised with judicial discretion regard being had
to the interests of the company and its creditors
as well. This principle was followed in Ranasami
Pillai v. Sabapathy Pillai, AIR 1925 Mad 318 and
S.Soundararajan v. Khaka Mahomed Ismail Saheb
of Roshan & Co., AIR 1940 Mad 42 : (1939) 2 MLJ
778.
In A. Subbaraya Mudaliar v. K.
Sundararajan, AIR 1951 Mad 986 : (1951) 2 MLJ
353 it was pointed out that the condition of
confirmation by the court being a safeguard
against the property being sold at an inadequate
price, it will be not only proper but necessary that
the court in exercising the discretion which it
undoubtedly has of accepting or refusing the
highest bid at the auction held in pursuance of its
orders, should see that the price fetched at the
auction is an adequate price even though there is
no suggestion of irregularity or fraud.”
(emphasis supplied)
13. From the aforesaid observation, it is abundantly
clear that the court is the custodian of the interests of
the company and its creditors. Hence, it is the duty of
the court to see that the price fetched at the auction is
WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 18 of 24

an adequate price even though there is no suggestion of
irregularity or fraud. As stated above, in the present
case, the sale proceedings have a chequered history. The
appellant started its offer after having an agreement with
the Employees' Samity for Rs.37 lakhs. This was on the
face of it under bidding for taking undue advantage of
court sale. At the intervention of the learned Single
Judge, the bid was increased to Rs.85 lakhs.
Subsequently, before the Division Bench, the appellant
increased it to Rs.1.30 crores. At that stage, Respondent
7 “Sharma” was not permitted to bid because it had not
complied with the requirements of the advertisement. It
is to be stated that on 26-6-1998 the Division Bench has
ordered that offers of Eastern Silk Industries Ltd. and Jay
Prestressed Products Ltd. would only be considered on 27-1998 and confirmation of sale would be made on the
basis of the offers made by the two parties. Further,
despite the fact that the appellant “Divya” had withdrawn
its earlier offer, the Court permitted it to take part in
making further offer as noted in the order dated 2-71998. In this set of circumstances, there was no need to
confine the bid between three offerors only.
14. In LICA (P) Ltd. (1) v. Official Liquidator, ((1996) 85
Comp Cas 788 (SC), this Court dealing with an similar
question observed thus :
“The purpose of an open auction is to get the most
remunerative price and it is the duty of the court
to keep openness of the auction so that the
intending bidders would be free to participate and
offer higher value. If that path is cut down or
closed the possibility of fraud or to secure
inadequate price or underbidding would loom
large. The court would, therefore, have to exercise
its discretion wisely and with circumspection and
keeping in view the facts and circumstances in
each case.”
15. The matter was again brought before this Court
and in LICA (P) Ltd. (2) v. Official Liquidator, (1996) 85
Comp Cas 792, the Court held :
“Proper control of the proceedings and meaningful
intervention by the court would prevent the
formation of a syndicate, underbidding and the
resultant sale of property for an inadequate price.
The order passed by this Court yielded the result
that the property which would have been finalised
at Rs.45 lakhs, fetched Rs.1.10 crores and in this
Court a further offer of Rs.1.25 crores is made. In
other words, the property under sale is capable of
fetching a higher market price.
Under these
circumstances, though there is some force in the
contention of Shri Ramaswamy that the court
auction may not normally be repeatedly disturbed,
since this Court, on the earlier occasion, had
limited the auction between the two bidders, the
impediment will not stand in the way to direct sale
afresh. Even today the parties are prepared to
participate in the bid.”
WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 19 of 24

In other words, the Court was of the opinion that the
guiding principle should be to get the most remunerative price
and it is the duty of the Court to keep the openness of the
auction, meaning thereby the intending bidders would feel free
to offer the higher value. Needless to mention, the aforesaid
principle has public purpose behind it.

When the assets of a

company, which has gone into liquidation, are sold, a Liquidator
is appointed, who takes charge of assets of the company, and he
is to undertake the liquidation process. The duty of the
Liquidator is to invite claims from the secured as well as
unsecured creditors and to ensure that after the disposal of the
assets of the company, these creditors are paid to the maximum
extent possible. It, therefore, necessarily follows that the Court
is to ensure the most remunerative price for the assets that are
being sold.

The Official Liquidator, in fact, is the trustee of

these assets at his hands. Hence, this is the guiding principle
that has to be kept in mind while considering the present case.

Though those cases dealt with liquidation proceedings of a
company wound up, on the facts of the present case, we are of
the opinion that the principles contained therein shall be
applicable. For this reason, the arguments of locus standi et-al
would have no relevance.
23.

The main contention of the petitioner is that it is seeking a
transparent process for getting maximum consideration for the
said land which would be in the interest and benefit of the

WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 20 of 24

company. Mere settlement of the dues of the secured creditors
is not the function of the AAIFR.

It ought to have made an

attempt to generate funds for the rehabilitation of the sick
company, but as a result of the sale, the Company is left with no
funds for rehabilitation.
24.

This, according to us, is the relevant consideration which should
have been the prime consideration before the AAIFR and,
therefore, it is necessary to deal with the present petition on
merits.

25.

We may state at the outset that the approach adopted by the
AAIFR while dismissing the MA of the petitioner herein is hypertechnical and in the facts of this case, it could not have
dismissed the application giving the reason that it did not have
the power to review. It is stated at the cost of repetition that
vide order dated 10.10.2006 the AAIFR had permitted the sale
of the land in question to the respondent No.5 at a specified
rate, i.e. Rs. 18 crores, which was proposed by the company in
its application.

When the petitioner filed the application

alleging legal infirmities therein and contended that the sale
was not valid and the amount of Rs. 18 crores was much less
than the market value, the AAIFR could have gone into this
aspect. However, even if we presume that the AAIFR was correct
in holding so, this Court, definitely, can go into this issue under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India and, therefore, we
propose to deal with the validity of the sale on merits.
26.

It is not in dispute that the AAIFR had permitted the sale by
private treaty between the company and the respondent No.5. It

WP (C) No. 7272/2007

nsk

Page 21 of 24

is also not in dispute that in the application filed seeking
permission to sell the land in question to the respondent No.5,
amount of Rs. 18.45 crores was stated, which was accepted by
the AAIFR without getting the land evaluated and finding as to
whether the price quoted represents the fair market value. Such
a sale, having regard to the principles explained above, is
normally not to be treated as valid.
27.

Having said so, the next question which falls for consideration is
as to what kind of orders are required to be passed in the
present case.

This question has arisen in view of certain

authorities and the employees of the company. In order to make
payment thereof, application in question was moved before the
AAIFR for sale of the land.

This was allowed on 10.10.2006.

Pursuant thereto, the respondent No.5 paid the entire amount
which was not limited to Rs.18.45 crores. As noted above, since
dues ultimately found payable were more than Rs.21 crores, the
respondent No.5 paid a sum of Rs.21.80 crores. The petitioner
waited this to happen before filing MA for setting aside the sale.
In the meantime, the respondent No.5 had admittedly expanded
considerable time, money, efforts and energy in settling the
dues of creditors, statutory authorities and the employees of the
company.

It also took steps for making the title of the land

nsk

Page 22 of 24

clear and marketable.
29.

Normally, once the sale is found to be defective, the Court
should not go in for fresh sale. However, having regard to the
aforesaid facts and more particularly when the steps were taken
after seeking due permission of the competent authority, i.e. the
AAIFR, we are of the opinion that it would not be appropriate to
set aside the sale.

It is more so when considerable time has

elapsed and in the meantime rates of the property have further
risen. At the same time, it would not be appropriate to let the
respondent No.5 take away the land in question at the price
mentioned in the application and approved by the AAIFR in its
order dated 10.10.2006. Since the petitioner in its application
filed in March 2007 had offered the price of Rs. 28 crores, even
as per the petitioner’s valuation, that was the market price of
the land in March 2007 and it was willing to give this
consideration for the land in question. Therefore, we are of the
opinion that the respondent No.5 be allowed to buy this land,
but it should be made to pay Rs.28 crores. We are conscious of
the fact that the offer of Rs.23 crores was quoted six months
after the order dated 10.10.2006 passed by the AAIFR and there
is a possibility that during this period the prices of the land
might have gone up marginally. However, we are of the opinion
that it would be equitable on both sides to allow the sale in
favour of the respondent No.5, but at a consideration of Rs.28
crores since the Company has been deprived of the balance
amount of Rs.6.20 crores for all this period.

30.

This petition is, accordingly, disposed of with the following

observations :Order dated 10.10.2006 read with order dated 24.9.2007
are modified to the extent that the consideration for the sale of
the land in question in favour of the respondent No.5 shall be
Rs.28 crores. The respondent No.5 is also directed to deposit
the balance amount of Rs.6.20 crores with the company (i.e.
after adjusting the amount of Rs.21.80 crores from the amount
of Rs.28 crores, which amount has already been deposited),
within a period of four weeks from today.
No costs.
