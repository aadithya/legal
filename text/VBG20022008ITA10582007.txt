ITA

No.617/D/2003 relevant for the assessment year 19961997.
2.

The short question in this appeal is as to whether the

Tribunal was right in law in holding that the levy of penalty
under Section 271(1)(C) of Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short
as `Act‟) is unjustified.
3.

The brief facts of this case are that the Assessee filed

a return of income on 29th November, 1996 at a total
income of Rs. „Nil‟ after adjusting the

brought forward

unabsorbed depreciation of Rs.13,68,089/- for assessment
year 1994-1995.

The Assessing Officer vide assessment

order dated 19th March, 1999 assessed the total income at
Rs.23,78,397/- after disallowing and adding a sum of Rs.
70,308/- under Section 35 D of the Act and a sum of
Rs.10,40,000/- under Section 68 of the Act.
4.

As

the

Assessee

expressed

his

inability

to

substantiate the genuineness of the transactions or furnish
any proof regarding credit worthiness of the persons
responsible for raising the share application money, the
ITA No.1058/2007

Page 2 of 6

Assessing Officer added a sum of Rs.10,40,000/- to the total
income of the Assessee under Section 68 of the Act and
proceedings under Section 271(1)(C) of the Act for filing
inaccurate particulars and concealment of income were
initiated against the Assessee.
5.

In appeal filed by the Assessee, it was submitted

before Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) that the
identity, genuineness and creditworthiness of the share
applicants had been proved from the fact that transactions
were made through account payee cheque and share had
been allotted to the applicants. The distinctive number of
shares allotted had been filed before the Assessing officer
and thus, there was no material with the Assessing Officer
to say that Assessee filed inaccurate particulars.
6.

The CIT (Appeals) dismissed the appeal of the

Assessee holding that it was not correct to say that no
concealment penalty could be imposed in respect of
addition into section 68 of the Act. It was also observed by
CIT(Appeals) that in terms of Explanation 1 to Section
ITA No.1058/2007

Page 3 of 6

271(1)(C) of the Act, the onus was on the Assessee to prove
that he has not furnished inaccurate particulars and as
such CIT(A) confirmed the order of Assessing Officer
imposing the penalty.
7.

Aggrieved against the decision of CIT(Appeals), the

Assessee filed an appeal before the Tribunal and vide
impugned order the Tribunal allowed the appeal.
8.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

Revenue that the Assessee was required to prove the
identity and creditworthiness of the share applicants and
the Assessee has not even filed confirmation which was
specifically asked for by the Assessing Officer and under
these circumstances, imposition of penalty upon the
Assessee by the Assessing Officer was justified.
9.

The present case has to be decided as per provisions

of Explanation 1 to Section 271(1)(C) of the Act, as per
which the concealment penalty is attracted in case the
Assessee

is

unable

to

offer

any

explanation

substantiated and is not found to be bona fide.
ITA No.1058/2007

is

not

10.

The Tribunal has given a finding that
“the Assessee in respect of share capital
had submitted all the information available
in its possession, that is, copy of share
application
forms
signed
by
the
shareholders which is nothing but a sort of
confirmation and also evidence of receipt
of money by cheque. The Assessing Officer
has not made any enquiry to prove that the
explanation given by the Assessee that the
money had been received as share capital
was false.
It is also not a case that
Assessee
did
not
substantiate
the
explanation.
The Assessee did file the
details and evidence as mentioned earlier
which was in its possession.
In the
absence of any adverse material collected
by the Assessing Officer, the explanation
given by the Assessee has to be taken as
bona fide.
On the basis of material
available, it is not possible to arrive at a
definite conclusion that the Assessee has
concealed any income in respect of share
application money.
The other addition
made is only on the ground of disallowance
of certain expenses which the Assessee
had claimed under bona fide belief. It had
not concealed particulars of any such
income. In our view, on the facts of the
case, it will not be appropriate to impose
penalty for concealment.”

11.

Under these circumstances, since the Assessee has

not concealed any income nor he has given any false
application, so we hold that the Tribunal was justified in
ITA No.1058/2007

Page 5 of 6

cancelling the penalty imposed by the Assessing Officer
and it is a finding of fact given by the Tribunal.
12.

The above being the position, no fault can be found

with the view taken by the Tribunal. Thus, the order of the
Tribunal does not give rise to a question of law, much less
a substantial question of law, to fall within the limited
purview of Section 260-A of the Act, which is confined to
entertaining only such appeals against the order which
involves a substantial question of law.
13.

Accordingly, the present appeal filed by the Revenue

is, hereby, dismissed.
