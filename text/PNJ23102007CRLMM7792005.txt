The 6 captioned petitions center around same issue

of law and save and except

the borrowers

and the sum

borrowed as also the date on which the sums were borrowed,
factual matrix of all the petitions is the same. Hence, the 6
captioned petitions are being disposed of by a common order.

Crl.M(C) 779/05 and Crl.M(C) 2641/05 arise out of a

common transaction.

Crl.M(C) 848/05 and Crl.M(C) 2642/05

arise out of same transaction.

Crl.M(C) 852/05 and Crl.M(C)

2643/05 arise out of the same transaction.

3.

The facts are that M/s Shree Krishna Polyester Ltd.,

petitioner of Crl.M(C) 779/05, Crl.M(C) 848/05 and Crl.M(C)
852/05 had made inter corporate deposits with three group
companies, namely, (a) M/s Lottee Holdings Pvt.Ltd., (b) M/s
Midopa Holdings Pvt. Ltd. and (C) M/s Lotus Finance &
Investment Pvt.Ltd.

in sum of Rs.1.4 crores, Rs.1 crore and

Rs.1.2 crores respectively.

The date of the three inter

corporate deposits are 17.9.1997, 23.9.1997 and 17.5.1998
respectively.
4.

Three identically worded agreements save and

except the amount of deposit and the date were executed
when the deposits were made.
5.

Vide Clause 16 of each agreement it was stipulated

that any dispute relating to the inter corporate deposits would
be a subject of adjudication by a court within the jurisdiction of
the city of Bombay (Mumbai).
6.

The three borrower companies had issued postdated

cheques for repayment of the deposit.

When presented for

encashment, all the cheques were dishonoured by the bankers
of the borrowers on whom the cheques were drawn stating the
reason “insufficient funds”.
7.

M/s Shree Krishna Polyester Ltd., the holder of the

cheques served statutory demand notices required by Section
138 of N.I.Act on payment not being made, criminal complaints
Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 3 of 16

were filed before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai
under Section 138 read with Section 141 of N.I.Act.
8.

In all the complaints, after recording pre-summoning

evidence and being satisfied that their existed a prima facie
case against the accused, the learned ACMM Mumbai, to whom
the complaints were assigned, proceeded to summon the
accused persons to face trial for having committed an offence
under Section 138 read with Section 141 of N.I.Act.
9.

On or about 19.4.2002, the accused in the said

complaints, namely, M/s Lottee Holdings Pvt.Ltd. and its
directors, M/s Midopa Holdings Pvt. Ltd. and its directors as
also M/s Lotus Finance & Investment Pvt.Ltd. and its directors
moved applications before the learned ACMM Mumbai stating
that

during the pendency of the complaints, on 17.9.1999,

agreements were entered into between the complainant and
the accused, namely, the three borrower companies, as per
which on return of the principle sum borrowed, the complainant
was obliged to withdraw the complaints.
10.

In the three applications which were filed in the

three complaints by M/s Shree Krishna Polyester Pvt.Ltd.
against all the borrowing companies and its directors, it was
inter alia pointed out that pertaining to the deposit taken by
M/s Lottee Holdings Pvt.Ltd. Rs.12 lacs had already been paid
and balance amount of Rs.1.28 crores was paid vide bankers
Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 4 of 16

cheque No.004568 dated 16.9.1999.

Pertaining to M/s Midopa

Holdings Pvt. Ltd. it was stated that Rs.14 lacs had already
been paid and balance sum of Rs.86 lacs was paid by means of
bankers cheque No.004570 dated 16.9.1999.

Pertaining to

M/s Lotus Finance & Investment Pvt.Ltd. it was stated that a
sum of Rs.14 lacs had already been paid and balance sum of
Rs.1.06 crores was paid vide bankers cheque No.004569 dated
16.9.1999.

Along with the applications, three agreements

dated 17.9.1999 were annexed.
11.

On behalf of M/s Shree Krishna Polyester Limited,

the agreements were purportedly executed by Pravin Tayal,
the petitioner of Crl.M(C) 2641/05 to Crl.M(C) 2643/05.
12.

Prayer made in the applications made before the

learned ACMM was to drop the proceedings in the complaints
filed by M/s Shree Krishna Polyester Limited under Section 138
read with Section 141 of N.I.Act.
13.

Replies were filed by the complainant denying any

settlement and further inter alia pleading that whether or not a
settlement was arrived at would have to be decided at the final
stage.
14.

By a common order dated 6.11.2001, learned ACMM

Mumbai dismissed the applications filed by the accused
holding that once offence was proved to be committed under
Section 138 of N.I.Act, subsequent payment does not wipe
Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 5 of 16

away the offence; hence it was held that the complaints had to
proceed ahead in accordance with law.
15.

The accused persons filed revision petitions against

the order dated 6.11.2001 passed by the learned ACMM. The
revision petitions were dismissed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge Mumbai on 17.5.2002.
16.

The accused filed Criminal Writ Petitions in the High

Court of Judicature at Mumbai challenging the orders passed by
the learned ACMM and the learned Additional Sessions Judge
Mumbai.
17.

The three writ petitions, being Crl.W.P.No.779/02,

780/02 and 1251/02 are currently pending adjudication before
Mumbai High Court. Rule has been issued in the writ petitions
filed.

Proceedings in the criminal complaints filed by

M/s

Shree Krishna Polyester Limited have been stayed.
18.

On or about 19.8.2002, M/s Lottee Holding Pvt.Ltd.,

M/s Midopa Holdings Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Lotus Finance &
Investment Pvt.Ltd. invoked jurisdiction of learned Metropolitan
Magistrate at Tis Hazari under Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C.
Complaints were filed against M/s Shree Krishna Polyester
Limited and Shri Pravin Tayal alleging that the accused had
committed offence punishable under Section 420 IPC.
19.

In a nutshell, it was stated in the complaints that the

complainant was induced to part with money under the
Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 6 of 16

agreement(s) dated 17.9.1999.

The same was on a clear

understanding that on receipt of balance payment, the
complaints before the ACMM Mumbai under Section 138 read
with Section 141 of N.I.Act would be withdrawn.

That the

accused had a dishonest intention since inception. The accused
never intended to withdraw the complaints.

That withdrawal

of criminal complaints was the allurement to the complainant
to part with valuable money. That the accused had committed
an offence punishable under Section 420 IPC.
20.

Simultaneously, in the month of September,2002,

the three borrower companies filed suits in Mumbai High Court
seeking a declaration that the agreement(s) dated 17.9.1999
was valid, subsisting and binding between the parties.
Declarations were prayed for that on receipt of the payment
under the three agreements, liability of the borrowers under
agreements dated 17.9.1997, 23.9.1997 and 17.5.1998 were
satisfied.

A decree of permanent injunction was prayed for to

restrain the lender from leading any evidence in the criminal
complaints pending before the learned ACMM Mumbai.
21.

In the present proceedings, a challenge has been

laid to the three complaints filed by M/s Lottee Holdings
Pvt.Ltd., M/s Midopa Holdings Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Lotus Finance &
Investment Pvt.Ltd. invoking jurisdiction under Section 156(3)
Cr.P.C. alleging that the petitioners have committed an offence
Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 7 of 16

punishable under Section 420 IPC.
22.

Whereas Pravin Tayal alleges that he has no

concern with M/s Shree Krishna Polyester Limited and has no
role to play

in the transaction, he additionally pleads that

courts at Delhi did not have jurisdiction to entertain the
complaint because the entire cause of action accrued at
Mumbai, if at all. Lastly, he urges that the dispute between
the borrower and the lender is primarily a civil dispute and on
said count also the complaints have to be quashed.
23.

M/s Shree Krishna Polyester Limited, apart from

questioning the validity of the agreements dated 17.9.1999
urged the later two points urged by Pravin Tayal.
24.

I

eschew

any

discussion

on

the

validity

or

authenticity of the agreement dated 17.9.1999 for the reason,
issue would require evidence. I may only note that according
to the petitioners, it was strange that an agreement dated
17.9.1999 was relied upon for the first time in the month of
April,2001 when applications were filed before the learned
ACMM Mumbai for dropping the proceedings in the complaint
under Section 138 r/w Section 141 N.I.Act. It was pointed out
by the learned counsel for the petitioners that Clause 5 of the
alleged agreement required filing of joint application and along
therewith the agreement within 10 days of 17.9.1999, an act
which was never performed by the parties. It was urged that
Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 8 of 16

said fact was sufficient to cloud the agreement dated
17.9.1999.
25.

Rival version projected by the borrowers was that

as the transaction between the parties was a civil transaction,
the borrower waited and waited for

the lender

to join in

moving the requisite application. When cooperation did not
come, they had no option but to unilaterally filed the
applications in question.
26.

As held hereinabove, any rival

version which

requires evidence to be led cannot be summarily accepted or
rejected i.e. cannot be adjudicated finally under Section 482
Cr.P.C.
27.

On the issue of jurisdiction of the Courts at Delhi,

Section 177 and Section 182 of Cr.P.C. are relevant and need
to be noted.
28.

Section 177 Cr.P.C. reads as under :-

29.

“177.
Ordinary place of inquiry and trial.Every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into
and tried by a court within whose local
jurisdiction it was committed.”
Section 182 Cr.P.C. reads as under :“182.
Offences
committed
by
letters, etc.- (1) Any offence which includes
cheating may, if the deception is practised by
means of letters or telecommunication
messages, be inquired into or tried by any
court within whose local jurisdiction such
letters or messages were sent
or were
received; and any offence of cheating and
dishonestly inducing delivery of property may

Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 9 of 16

be inquired into or tried by a court within
whose local jurisdiction the property was
delivered by the person deceived or was
received by the accused person.

30.

(2)
Any offence punishable under
Section 495 or Section 494 of the Indian Penal
Code (45 of 1860) may be inquired into or
tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction
the offence was committed or the offender
last resided with his or her spouse by the first
marriage or the wife by first marriage has
taken up permanent residence after the
commission of offence.”
Section 177 of Cr.P.C. lays down that every offence

would ordinarily be enquired into and tried by a court within
whose local jurisdiction it was committed.
31.

It is a general principle of law that all crimes are

local and justiciable only by courts within whose jurisdiction
they are committed.
32.

The order “ordinarily” has been advisedly used by

the Legislature and since Section 177 embodies the general
rule of jurisdiction, the word “ordinarily” in Section 177 must
be taken to mean that “except in the cases provided
hereinafter to the contrary”. The reason is that Section 177 as
a general rule of jurisdiction has to be read subject to any
special provision of law which may modify Section 177.
33.

In the decision reported as AIR 1961 SC 1589,

Purushottamdass Dalmia Vs. State of West Bengal, in para 15 it
was observed as under :“(15)

It is further significant to notice the

Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 10 of 16

difference in the language of S.177 and S.233.
Section 177 simply says that ordinarily every
offence would be tried by a court within the
local limits of whose jurisdiction it was
committed. It does not say that it would be
tried by such court except in the cases
mentioned in Ss.179 to 185 and 188 or in
cases specially provided by any other
provision of law. It leaves the place of trial
open.
Its provisions are not peremptory.
There is no reason why the provisions of
Sections 233 to 239 may not also provide
exceptions to Section 177, if they do permit
the trial of a particular offence along with
others in one court.
On the other hand,
Section 233, dealing with the trial of offence,
reads :
For every distinct offence of which any person
is accused there shall be a separate charge,
and every such charge shall be tried
separately, except in the cases mentioned in
Sections 234, 235, 236 and 239.

34.

The language is very peremptory. There is a
clear direction that there should be a separate
charge for every distinct offence and that any
deviation from such a course would be only in
cases mentioned in Sections 234, 235, 236
and 239.”
With reference to Section 182 of Cr.P.C., relevant

would it be to note that in the 41st Report of the Law
Commission it was recommended that Section 182 could be
transplanted as sub-section (6) and (7) of Section 181 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure. In para 15.30 to 15.36, the Law
Commission had commented thus :
“15.30.
Controversial
questions
have
frequently arisen in regard to the venue for
the offence of cheating where the fraudulent
or dishonest misrepresentation is made by
post, telegram or long distance telephone and
Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 11 of 16

where the property of which the person
deceived or cheated is delivered to a common
carrier or other agent at one place & received
by the cheat at another place. In the absence
of special provisions similar to those
contained in S.181, such questions have
necessarily to be decided with reference to
the general principles laid down in Sections
177, 179 & 182 (now Ss.177, 178, 179).
Different views have been expressed by the
High Courts applying these principles to the
facts of the particular cases before them.

35.

15.36.
On the strength of this analysis it
might be argued in comparable cases that no
part of the offence of cheating and
dishonestly inducing delivery of property
takes place at the accused person's end. The
application of Section 179 (now S.178) or
S.182 (now S.179) might be regarded as of
doubtful validity. There should, however, be
no objection in principle to the person
accused of cheating from a distance being
triable for the offence not only at the place
where his victim was deceived and/or made to
part with property, but also at the place where
the accused has been carrying on his
dishonest practices and reaping the benefits.”
While dealing with the offence of cheating, sub-

section (1) of Section 182 Cr.P.C. contemplates different
jurisdictions in relation to: where deception is practiced and
where pursuant to the deception which is practiced, property is
delivered and received.
36.

It would be interesting to note that cheating is

defined generally in Section 415 of the Indian Penal Code and
is punishable under Section 417 thereof.

Section 420 IPC

deals with certain specified cases of cheating and includes
where property is delivered

pursuant to cheating.

Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

A higher
page 12 of 16

punishment is prescribed under Section 420 IPC, treating the
same to be an offence distinct from the offence punishable
under Section 417 IPC.
37.

Offence of cheating under Section 420 does not

consist merely in a fraudulent or dishonest representation but
also requires the delivery of property by the victim. In other
words, to sustain a conviction under Section 420 IPC, it has to
be not only established that the accused has cheated the
victim but also that by doing so, the accused has dishonestly
induced the victim who was cheated to deliver the property or
do any other act mentioned in Section 420 IPC.

Thus, where

cheating is unaccompanied by delivery of property etc. as
mentioned in Section 420 IPC, it would be an offence
punishable only under Section 417 IPC. But where the property
has come to be parted with, offence of cheating becomes an
offence punishable under Section 420 IPC.
38.

The later part of sub-section (1) of Section 182

creates the local jurisdiction relating to offence of cheating and
dishonesty inducement of property in the courts within local
jurisdiction whereof the property was delivered by the person
deceived or was received by the accused person. The first limb
of sub-Section (1) of Section 182 relates to offence of cheating
where property is not delivered nor received.
39.

To put it pithly, first limb of sub-section (1) of

Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 13 of 16

Section 182 Cr.P.C. would relate to offence of cheating
punishable under Section 417 of IPC and the second limb
thereof would be referable to offence punishable under Section
420 IPC.
40.

With aforesaid understanding of law, fact pertaining

to jurisdiction in Delhi as alleged in the complaint is holding of
negotiations between Pravin Tayal and a Director of the
complainant i.e. the borrower at Delhi.

Neither of the three

pay orders in sum of Rs.86 lacs, Rs.1.28 crores and Rs.1.6
crores respectively stated to have been parted possession of
pursuant to the inducement are alleged to have been delivered
by the person deceived or received by the accused person at
Delhi.
41.

On the contrary, as pointed out by the learned

counsel for the petitioners, the purported agreements dated
17.9.1999 record that they were executed at Mumbai and that
the pay orders in question were received at Mumbai.
42.

A fact not stated in the purported agreements dated

17.9.1999 but on which parties are not at variance may be
noted. The three pay orders were issued by ANZ Grindlays
Bank, Mumbai branch.
43.

According to the petitioners, the three pay orders

were received towards payment of the principle sum. It was
not pursuant to any agreement.
Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 14 of 16

44.

Be that as it may, since the complainants have

relied upon the three purported agreements dated 17.9.1999
for the purpose of jurisdiction, since the complainants have
invoked the jurisdiction at Delhi, said agreements can be relied
upon to adjudicate on the issue of jurisdiction.
45.

Therefore, the factual scenario would be that the

three pay orders

stand delivered by the complainant to the

accused persons at Mumbai. The complainant relies upon the
agreements dated 17.9.1999 recording that they have been
executed

at

Mumbai.

The

bald

version

that

certain

negotiations took place at Delhi would, in my opinion, not
confer jurisdiction on the courts at Delhi in view of the legal
position

that

where

offence

of

cheating

and

dishonest

inducement results in delivery of property, courts within local
jurisdiction whereof property was delivered by the person
deceived or was received by accused persons would

be the

courts which would have territorial jurisdiction to entertain the
complaint.
46.

In the instant case, the pay orders have been drawn

at ANZ Grindlays Bank, Mumbai. They have been delivered and
received at Mumbai. Evidence pertaining to handing over and
taking over is as per the agreement dated 17.9.1999 executed
at Mumbai.

Thus, courts at Delhi would lack territorial

jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.
Crl.M(C) 779/05, 848/05, 852/05, 2641/05, 2642/05, 2643/05

page 15 of 16

47.

As I have held that courts at Delhi lack territorial

jurisdiction

to

entertain

the

complaints,

expressing any opinion on the second

I

refrain

from

question which was

argued as it does not relate to territorial

jurisdiction

and

relates to substratum of the dispute. In my opinion, the said
issue needs to be decided by the court of competent territorial
jurisdiction.
48.

Since lack of territorial jurisdiction relates not to the

substantive jurisdiction of the court and proceedings in a court
lacking territorial jurisdiction are treated by law as an
irregularity and not an illegality

(see Section 482 Cr.P.C.), I

dispose of the petitions directing the learned ACMM, before
whom complaints have been filed by respondent No.2, to
return the complaints to the respective complainants

who

would be at liberty to file the same in the court of competent
jurisdiction at Mumbai.
49.

No costs.
