On the last date, Mr.P.K. Seth, Advocate appeared for

respondent No.2 insurance company. Complete set of paper book
was supplied to Mr.P.K. Seth, Advocate.

But still nobody has

chosen to appear for the contesting respondent No.2.
The brief facts of the case relevant for deciding the

MAC APP. No.380-81/2006

Page 1 of 4

present appeal are as under:On 4.09.2004, the deceased Mr.Arun Dangi and his
brother were coming back from Nangloi on their motor cycle
bearing

registration No. DL-4S-AG-1977.

At about 3.30 p.m.

whey they crossed the Nilothi More, tempo bearing No. DL-1LB4108 rammed into their motorcycle.

They both fell down and

deceased Mr.Arun Dangi received grevious injuries and died at the
spot.
I have heard learned counsel for the appellant and
have perused the records.
The main grievance raised by counsel for the appellant
is that the Tribunal has not taken into consideration the minimum
wages as are applicable to a boy possessing matriculate
qualification. The contention of counsel for the appellant is that
the Tribunal has wrongly assessed the income of the deceased at
Rs.22,500/- in the presence of academic qualification placed and
proved on record by the appellant.

Counsel for the appellant

contends that the deceased was a very bright student and would
have certainly risen in his life but due to the said tragedy, the life
of the young child came to an end.
Perusal of the award shows that the Tribunal has
MAC APP. No.380-81/2006

Page 2 of 4

taken into consideration notional income of the deceased at
Rs.15,000/- as laid down in the IInd Schedule of the Motor
Vehicles Act and then considering the fact of their being no
revision of the Second Schedule which came into effect in the year
1994, the Tribunal has assessed the income of the deceased at
Rs.22,500/- p.a. It is a settled legal position that under Section
168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, the compensation to be awarded in
favour of the claimants should neither be excessive nor on the
lower side, but the same should be just, fair and equitable. No
amount of compensation can compensate the loss of a life or can
bring back happiness in the lives of the dependant family
members. It is a case of young boy of 18 years whose life was
snatched in the gruesome accident at the threshold of his youth.
The boy was admittedly a very brilliant child. Since the deceased
had already completed his matriculation

therefore, safely the

minimum wages as applicable for a matriculate person can be
taken into consideration. The minimum wages as on the relevant
date of accident for a matriculate person were Rs.3342.90, say
Rs.3343/-. The multiplier of 15 has been applied in the facts of
the present case. Therefore, the increase in the minimum wages
can be taken into consideration. It is generally noticed that under
MAC APP. No.380-81/2006

Page 3 of 4

the Minimum Wages Act due to periodical revision in the minimum
wages, the wages get more than double within a period of 10
years, therefore, the average of the said minimum wages and the
increased wages after making it double can be taken into
consideration.

Deducting 1/3rd towards the personal expenses

and applying the multiplier of 15, the average loss of financial
dependency would come to Rs.6,01,740/-. Therefore, the total
compensation shall come out as Rs.6,41,740/-. The appellant has
already received the award amount, therefore, now appellant
shall be entitled to get the differential of the award amount along
with upto date interest at the rate of 7.5% p.a. from the date of
filing of the petition till final realisation of the same.
With these directions, the appeal is disposed of.
