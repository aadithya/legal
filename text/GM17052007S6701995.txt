After receipt of the summons, the defendant nos.1 & 2 entered

CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.1

appearance and even filed their defence to the case.

However, on the

ground of failure to appear, they were proceeded ex parte on 17 th March,
2004. These defendants filed an application under Order 9 Rule 7 of the
Code of Civil Procedure being IA No.7457/2004 praying for setting aside
of the ex parte proceedings. This application was allowed on 6th October,
2005 subject to payment of costs of Rs.10,000/-. The defendant nos.1 & 2
failed to pay the costs and also did not appear in the matter thereafter.
Consequently, by an order passed on 21st February, 2006, the defendant no.1
& 2 were again directed to be proceeded ex parte. No appearance has been
put on their behalf thereafter.
Thereafter, on 31st May, 2006, the defendant nos.1 & 2 filed yet
another application under Order 9 Rule 7 praying for setting aside of the
orders dated 17th March, 2004 and 21st February, 2006 being IA
No.6672/2006 along with an application seeking condonation of delay
which was registered as IA No.6673/2006.

These applications were

dismissed by an order passed on 31st July, 2006 which has since attained
finality.
3.

So far as defendant nos.3, 4 & 5 are concerned, on account of

inability to effect service by ordinary process, by an order passed on 1st
CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.2

September, 2000, the Joint Registrar directed service upon them by the
alternative mode of publication of citation in the daily newspaper
“Statesman” in addition to display of summons on the notice board of this
court and affixation at the given address of the defendants. The defendants
failed to appear despite service by way of publication and affixation and
consequently by an order passed on 3rd May, 2001, the defendant nos.3 & 4
were ordered to be proceeded ex parte.
4.

The plaintiff has filed its ex parte evidence by affidavit of Mr. Nippon

Kadam, liaison officer and a duly constituted attorney of the plaintiff who
has been authorised by power of attorney dated 2nd July, 2001 (Ext. PW
1/A).
5.

Parties were given time to file written submissions in support of their

oral contentions. Only the plaintiff filed written statement and appeared in
the matter thereafter.
6.

In this background, the undisputed facts established in evidence on

record are noticed hereinafter.
7.

The plaintiff is a public limited company incorporated on 27 th

January, 1926 having its registered office at Construction House, 5,
Walchand Hirachand Marg, Ballard Estate, Bombay – 400 038 duly
CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.3

registered with the Registrar of Companies, Bombay notarized copy
whereof has been marked Ex PW 1/E. The present suit has been filed on
behalf of the plaintiff by Brigadier P.K. Dasgupta who has been authorised
and empowered to sign and verify the plaint and institute the present suit
and swear on affidavit all other things necessary for the conduct of the
present litigation.
8.

Before proceeding any further, it becomes necessary to notice the

persons arrayed as defendants in the present suit and their description. The
defendant no.1 Mr. Ravinder Narain Mathur, was appointed as Junior
Officer (Administration) in the Delhi office of the plaintiff w.e.f. 19th June,
1980 and he continued to serve the plaintiff till termination of the service on
the 7th October, 1993. Ms. Annapurna Mathur, defendant no.2, is the wife
of the defendant no.1 to whom it is alleged that the defendant no.1 paid an
amount of Rs.5,00,000/- out of the plaintiff's funds.

The plaintiff has

pointed out that Ms. Annapurna Sinha is the maiden name of Ms.
Annupama Mathur, wife of the defendant no.1 who has been arrayed as
defendant no.2. Similarly, the defendant no.3, Smt. Preeti Nagar, is the
friend of the defendant no.1 to whom he has allegedly paid an amount of
Rs.1,50,000/-. The defendant no.1 has paid an amount of Rs.5,50,000/CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.4

which belongs to the plaintiff, to the Saraswati Kunj Co-operative Group
Housing Society Ltd., arrayed as defendant no.4, to purchase the flat in the
name of his wife, arrayed as defendant no.2 herein.
9.

The plaintiff is a construction company having 14 branch offices in

different parts of India. The plaintiff company earlier had a representative
office at Delhi being No.B-1, Pusa Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi looked
after by Mr. M.M. Karve, who as then the General Manager, assisted by
about six-seven employees including the defendant no.1.
10.

The plaintiff company had opened a current account being account

no.30230 with the State Bank of India at Kasturba Gandhi Marg Branch,
New Delhi for the purposes of meeting the day-to-day expenses of the
representative office at Delhi. The authority to operate this account was
given by the Board of Directors of the plaintiff by its resolution dated 26th
February, 2002 which has been proved on record as Exh. PW1/S. Thus, the
account would be operated by the joint signatures of any two out of the
following officers:Mr. D.M. Sahoor

- Executive Vice President (H.O. Bombay)

Mr. P.N. Desai

- Vice President (Operations)(H.O. Bombay)

Mr.M.M. Karve

- General Manager (Business Development)

CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.5

New Delhi.
Mr. Venkatasundram - Assistant General Manager, New Delhi.
Mr. R.N. Mathur

- Defendant no.4 herein.

Out of these four persons, the first two namely Mr.D.M. Sahoor and
Mr.P.N. Desai were stationed in Bombay and hardly ever used the account.
Furthermore since Mr. Venkatasundaram, the Assistant General Manager,
the other authorised signatory, was out of Delhi on most of occasions and he
used to sign blank cheques in order to enable defendant no.1 to sign and
draw the cheque. The counterfoil of the cheques used to be under the
charge and custody of defendant no.1. The withdrawals from the bank
account of the plaintiff used to be checked and tallied against these
counterfoils with bank statements maintained by defendant no.1 from time
to time. The said transactions were carried out in good faith and for the
sake of convenience for smooth working of the office.
11.

In August, 1993, the plaintiff observed that the bank statements being

received in the head office at Mumbai from Delhi through defendant no.1,
were hand written and without a statement of bank or authorised signatures
of the officer at most of the pages. In these circumstances, the plaintiff
company wrote to the State Bank of India to send statement of accounts for
CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.6

the period from 1st April, 1992 to 29th July, 1993 directly to it followed by a
reminder.
12.

The defendant no.1, in the meantime, stopped attending the office of

the plaintiff company on the pretext of sickness. His continued absent from
office as also from his residence and non-submission of the bank statement
gave rise to grave suspicion to the plaintiff. The statements sent by the
defendant no.1 for the period from 1st April, 1992 to 29th July, 1993 have
been proved on record and have been marked exhibit PW 1/P. Certified
copies of the statement of cash sent by the Delhi office of the plaintiff to the
head office at Mumbai from July, 1992 to December, 1992, have been
proved on record as exhibit PW1/Q.
13.

The State Bank of India furnished a certified statement of accounts

duly certified in accordance with law to the plaintiff on the 20th August,
2003. (Exhibit PW1/L).
14.

It was then realised that the defendant no.1 had suppressed the

original correct bank statements and sent false and forged bank statement to
the head office of the plaintiff at Mumbai which were prepared by him in
such manner that they were in conformity with such transactions as were
reflected in the books of accounts of the plaintiff company. From the
CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.7

certified copy of the bank statements provided by the bank, it was revealed
that a sum of Rs.54,65,000/- had been deposited in the aforesaid current
account number 30230 without any notice, knowledge or authority of the
plaintiff or information to it.

This amount had been received in the

plaintiff’s account through the following pay orders received from the
Indian Bank, Padam Singh Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi without the
knowledge or authority of the plaintiff:-

The State Bank of India confirmed to the plaintiff that the statement

of accounts which had been furnished by the defendant no.1 to the plaintiff,
were not the genuine statement of accounts of the bank documents.
16.

The plaintiff had no knowledge about the identity of persons who had

deposited these amounts or the pay orders in its account. The plaintiff had
also not dealt with any such persons who were required to make such
payments to the plaintiff. As the defendant no.1 was wholly and solely
looking after this current account of the plaintiff company, it was revealed
that the amount has been deposited in connivance with the defendant no.1.
17.

Matters did not end here. From this deposit of Rs.54,65,000/-, the

defendant no.1 had caused to be withdrawn, directly and indirectly, a total
sum of approximately Rs.23,00,000/- through cheques or by pay orders.
From the bank slips and counterfoils, the following particulars relating to
the withdrawals of the amount by the defendant no.1 can be gathered:a)

It has been contended that the defendant no.1 deposited the afore-

noticed pay order of Rs.5,50,000/- with the defendant no.4 from whom a flat
has been purchased in the name of his wife, defendant no.2 The defendant
no.1 made payment of the amount of Rs.5,50,000/- to his wife, the
defendant no.2, by two pay orders. The two pay orders which were issued,
were one being in the sum of Rs.1,50,000/- and the other in the sum of
Rs.15,000/- which were drawn in the name of Smt. Annapurna Sinha as the
beneficiary. The defendant no.3 also received a pay order for Rs.1,50,000/as detailed hereinabove.

The certified copies of the original bank records and counter foils of
the 23 cheques have been proved on record as PW 1/O while certified
copies of the pay orders have been proved on record as exhibit PW1/N.
19.

The plaintiff has contended that from the position revealed by the

State Bank of India on 20th August, 1993, it was further revealed that the
defendant no.1 as sole signatory had unauthorisedly and illegally made a
request to the State Bank of India to create two STDRs, one for the sum of
Rs.24,50,000/- on the 22nd December, 1992 being Nos.SD/A/92-982189
and another for the sum of Rs.5,25,000/- dated 24th December, 1992 being
no.SD/A/92-982199 which were due for maturity in December, 1994 from
the amount lying in the account of the plaintiff.
20.

This was again in total contravention of the instructions of the

plaintiff and was not authorised by resolution of the Board of Directors. By
a letter dated 24th August, 1993, the plaintiff informed the State Bank of
India that the money in the fixed deposit receipt did not belong to the
plaintiff and that these amounts should be held by the bank and not released
to any person. The plaintiff also advised the bank to investigate the matter.
By a subsequent letter of 2nd September, 1993, the State Bank of India was

CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.11

informed about the decision of the Board of Directors for closure of the
bank account.
21.

The plaintiff also made complaints dated 8th September, 1993 to the

DCP for investigation of the illegal acts complained against the defendant
no.1 which was filed in the Police Station Connaught Place. A report was
also filed with the P.S. Connaught Place complaining about the forgery and
criminal misappropriation of funds of the plaintiff company by the
defendant no.1 and others which was registered as FIR No.641/93 on 13th
September, 1993, 22nd September, 1993 and 29th September, 1993 under
Sections 420, 406, 467, 468, 471/120-B of the IPC based on plaintiff’s
complaint of 8th September, 1993.
22.

Apart from the above illegal acts, the defendant no.1 had also had

even negotiated sale of properties belonging to the plaintiff company.
It was further revealed that the defendant no.1 had even negotiated
the sale of properties belonging to the plaintiff company. The defendant
no.1, purportedly acting on authority of the plaintiff, negotiated in respect of
the plaintiff's premises no.B-1, Block No.9, Northern Extension Area, Pusa
Road, New Delhi.

He illegally and unauthorisedly entered into an

agreement dated 27th October, 1992 with five companies, namely, (i) M/s
CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.12

Elegance International Pvt. Ltd. (ii) Fragrance Overseas Private Ltd. (iii)
Naveen Bharat Nirman Udyog Pvt. Ltd. and (iv) New Age Promoters and
Estate Developers Pvt. Ltd. (v) Ujjwal Bhavishya Nirman Udyog Pvt. Ltd.
in respect of the plaintiff's property. The defendant no.1 further dishonestly
and unauthorisedly entered into an agreement dated 29th October, 1992 in
respect of the property bearing No.B-1, Block 9, Northern Extension
Scheme, Pusa Road, New Delhi with one M/s Eminent Promoters &
Developers Pvt. Ltd. and second with M/s Elite Promoters Pvt. Ltd.
23.

Two suits bearing nos.2038/1993 titled as Eminent Promoters and

Developers & Ors. Vs. Hindustan Construction Company Ltd. and Suit
No.2039/1993 titled Elegance International Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.Vs. Hindustan
Construction Company Ltd. were filed against the plaintiff in this court.
24.

The purported purchasers, when informed of the true state of facts

and the fraud committed by the defendant no.1, readily agreed to settle the
matter provided that the money which had been paid by them to the
defendant no.1 and subsequently deposited in the account of the plaintiff,
was returned to them. Consequently, the plaintiff returned the amounts
which had been paid by these purchasers to the defendant no.1 whereupon
they agreed to give the disclaimer in respect of the amount of
CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.13

Rs.54,65,000/- which was lying deposited in the bank account no.30230.
The statement between the parties was recorded by this court by two orders
both dated 16th November, 1993 passed in the two suits which have been
brought on record as exhibit PW1/F and PW1/F-1. The disclaimer given by
these parties has been proved on record as PW1/U.
25.

The plaintiff has subsequently sold the property no.B-1, Block No.9,

Northern Extension of area, Pusa Road to M/s Phoenix Overseas Limited.
26.

The defendant no.1 had entered into the agreement to sell placing

reliance on the forged and fabricated authorities and general power of
attorney from the plaintiffs. It was also revealed that the amount of
Rs.54,65,000/- which was deposited unauthorisedly in the account of the
plaintiff, was the amount which has been fraudulently received by the
defendant no.1 from the alleged purchasers of the property who have been
noticed hereinabove.
27.

From the foregoing facts, it is evident that from the amount of

Rs.54,65,000/- deposited by the defendant no.1 in the account of the
plaintiff company, he had utilised the amount of Rs.29,00,000/- to make the
fixed deposits. The balance amount had been misappropriated by him by
diverting it to the credit of his wife, the defendant no.2 and others including
CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.14

the defendant nos.3 & 4. The defendant no.1 is facing trial in the criminal
court for the offences of forgery, misappropriation, fraud etc.
28.

In the criminal proceedings against the defendant no.1, by an order

dated 2nd June, 1994 (Exh. PW1/1) passed by Shri D.K. Saini, Metropolitan
Magistrate, New Delhi, the fixed deposits for Rs.24,50,000/- dated 22 nd
December, 1992 & Rs.5,25,000 dated 24th December, 1992 which were due
for maturity in December, 1994, were released in favour of the plaintiff. As
such, the plaintiff company could retrieve a sum of Rs.29,75,000/- from the
defendants.
29.

After receipt of the amount of two fixed deposits, balance amount of

Rs.22,55,89.77 which has been withdrawn illegally and fraudulently by the
defendant no.1 from time to time w.e.f. 19th June, 1992 by way of 130
cheques and the pay orders noticed above, is due and payable by the
defendants.
30.

During the course of investigation, the police was able to recover

some of the cheques which were fraudulently and dishonestly issued by the
defendant no.1. These cheques have been seized by a seizure memo dated
18th November, 1993 in the criminal case being FIR No.385/1993 copy

CS (OS) No.670/1995

In this background, the plaintiff has filed the present suit. The facts

established on record are unrebutted and unchallenged and the plaintiff has
made out a case for entitlement of the amounts claimed. There is no legal
impediment to the grant of the relief to the plaintiff.
33.

From the facts which have been brought on record, it is evident that

out of the sum of Rs.22,55,897.77, the defendant no.1 Shri R.N. Mathur has
advanced to Ms. Annapurna Mathur, defendant no.2, a sum of Rs.5,50,000/, to Ms. Preeti Nagar, defendant no.3, a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- and to
Saraswati Kunj Co-operative Group Housing Society, defendant no.4 a sum

CS (OS) No.670/1995

Page No.19

of Rs.5,50,000/- which they are liable to pay to the plaintiff. Therefore,
each of these defendants with the defendant no.1, are jointly and severally
liable to pay to the extent of these amounts to the plaintiff. At the same
