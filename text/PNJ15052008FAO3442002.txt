PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

Heard learned counsel for the parties.

2.

The appellant is aggrieved by an order dated 1.4.2002

passed by the learned Appellate Judge disposing of RCA
No.386/2000.
3.

Vide impugned order dated 1.4.2002 the learned

Appellate Judge has set aside the judgment and decree dated
1.4.1997 passed by the learned Trial Judge and has remanded the
matter to the learned Trial Judge for fresh adjudication.
4.

The learned Appellate Judge has held that a vital issue

was not framed.

The learned Appellate Judge has framed the

issue and as a consequence has remanded the matter.
5.

The issue framed by the learned Appellate Judge reads

as under:“Whether the plot Nos.172-173 exist in Guru Angad
Nagar, Khureji Khass, Shahdara, Delhi? OPP.”
6.

To appreciate the controversy between the parties and

the legality of the impugned order certain backdrop facts may be
noted.
7.

Respondents filed a suit for perpetual injunction on

12.3.1986 against the appellants seeking a decree of injunction
restraining the appellants from taking forcible possession of plot
No.172 and 173 ad-measuring 50 sq.yds, claiming that the said
plots were carved out of Khasra No.52/6 and were given numbers
172 and 173 in the colony Guru Angad Nagar, Khureji Khass,
Shahdara, Delhi.
8.

The defence taken by the respondents was that no

such plots existed in the colony and that the title deed relied
upon by the appellants did not pertain to the land at site which
was in possession of the respondents.

According

to

the

respondents, the land in question bore No.133, West Guru Angad
Nagar, Gurudwara Road, Khureji Khass, Shahdara, Delhi.
9.

On the pleadings of the parties the learned Trial Judge

framed the following substantive issue:-

“Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief claimed
in the plaint? OPD.”
10.

An issue relating to non-joinder of necessary party was

also framed.
11.

In view of the respective pleadings of the parties,

evidence was led. Title documents were proved. Unfortunately
for the parties the colony is an unauthorized colony and hence
there is no approved layout.

The issue was thus debated with

reference to the location of the land at site and boundaries
thereof with reference to the adjoining lands.
12.

Deciding issue No.2, learned Trial Judge noted the

claim of the respondents that they were the owners in possession
of 50 sq.yds. of land bearing plot No.172-173,

Guru Angad

Nagar, Khureji Khass, Shahdara, Delhi and that the land was
carved out of Khasra No.52/6. The learned Trial Judge also noted
the defence of the appellants that the suit land was actually
bearing Municipal No.133, Guru Angad Nagar, Khureji Khass,
Shahdara, Delhi and that they were in possession thereof.
13.

Discussing the evidence learned Trial Judge has

observed in para 9: “It was for the plaintiffs, to prove that plot
No.172-173 due existed in Khasra No.52/6”.
14.

In para 13 the learned Trial Judge has held that: “It

was for the plaintiffs to establish that they are presently in
possession of plot No.172-173 but they have failed to lead any

evidence on record regarding existence of any such plot........”
15.

Further finding has been returned after discussing the

evidence that: “It cannot be said that any plot No.172-173
existed/exists in the year 1977 or even thereafter”.
16.

The discussion has concluded in para 14 of the

decision by the learned Trial Judge recording a conclusive finding
that the evidence led by the parties did not establish existence of
any plots bearing No.172-173, Guru Angad Nagar, Khureji Khass,
Shahdara, Delhi.
17.

It is obvious that pertaining to issue No.2 framed by

the learned Trial Judge, parties were conscious of the fact that
the debate is on the subject whether the suit land was bearing
plot Nos.133, Guru Angad Nagar, Khureji Khass, Shahdara, Delhi
or plot No.172-173, Guru Angad Nagar, Khureji Khass, Shahdara,
Delhi.
18.

Thus,

the

learned

Appellate

Judge

has

wrongly

concluded that the real issue was not debated between the
parties.
19.

It is settled law that where a specific issue is not

framed but the parties understand that a particular issue, worded
widely, covers the specific issue and have led evidence relatable
thereto, neither party can urge that prejudice has been caused to
the party by not framing a specific issue.
20.

Under the circumstances the appeal is allowed and the

impugned order dated 1.4.2002 is set aside with consequential
directions to the learned Appellate Judge to decide RCA
No.386/2000 on merits.
21.

Before concluding, a submission of learned counsel for

the respondents may be noted.

Learned counsel urges that in

the first appeal, appellants made a statement that they do not
wish to contest the appeal, meaning thereby, the appellants
consented to the suit being decreed.
22.
learned

Needless to state, if there is any material before the
Appellate

Judge

to

support

and

to

sustain

the

submissions made at the Bar today, while considering the appeal,
learned Appellate Judge would take note of such material.
23.

Parties are directed to appear before the learned

District Judge on 3.7.2008.

RCA No.386/2000 disposed of by

Mr.Raj Paul Singh Teji, Additional District Judge shall be restored
and decided as per law.
24.

No costs.
