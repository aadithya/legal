This order shall dispose of an application filed by the applicant
Mr. D.P. Joshi for recalling of order dated 11.09.2007 passed by this
Court on his application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 dismissing his application as having become
infructuous in view of compromise between the parties.
2

The applicant in the instant application has pleaded that no

compromise was arrived at between the parties and the order
OMP No. 76/2006

Page 1 of 7

dismissing the petition as having become infructuous passed on
11.09.2007 need to be recalled. It is stated that on 22.08.2006 also
the Court was told by the respondent that the matter has been
compromised between the parties. According to the applicant, the
respondent had misled the Court regarding compromise on
22.08.2006. On 23.11.2006 when the matter came up for hearing
before this Court, following orders were passed:“It is stated that no settlement has taken place between
the parties. Learned counsel for the respondent seeks time to
file reply to the petition. Let reply be filed within four weeks,
rejoinder within two weeks thereafter.
List on 15th March, 2007. Interim orders to continue.”

After 23.11.2006, the case was adjourned for 15.03.2007,

16.03.2007, 29.05.2007 and lastly for 11.09.2007. It is further stated
that on 11.09.2007, the counsel Mr. Ajay Bansal had to appear
before the Court on behalf of the applicant but he could not appear
on account of the fact that he had to go out of Delhi for some
personal work and therefore he requested one of the junior counsel
namely Mr. Ashish Garg who had just joined the profession to
appear and seek a date. It is contended that Mr. Ashish Garg had
never appeared in this matter earlier and was not aware about the
facts of the case. On 11.09.2007, the counsel for the respondent

OMP No. 76/2006

Page 2 of 7

again misled the Court taking advantage of the situation of non
appearance of the leading counsel Mr. Ajay Bansal and made a
statement that the matter was compromised and the junior counsel
appearing for the applicant could not understand the situation and
remain silent because of which this Court recorded in its order dated
11.09.2007 that the petition has become infructuous in view of
compromise between the parties .
4

The thrust of the applicant's case is that no compromise was in

fact arrived at between the parties and the Court was misled on
behalf of the respondent regarding the purported compromise taking
advantage of absence of the main counsel of the applicant on that
day. Hence the applicant has prayed for recalling of order passed by
this Court on 11.09.2007.
5

This application is opposed on behalf of the respondent on the

ground that a compromise was arrived at between the parties which
was reduced into writing on 15.06.2006. The respondent has placed
copy of compromise agreement dated 15.06.2006 on record to show
that the applicant had settled the matter with the respondent and
had received Rs. 6.5 lacs as compromise amount. The contention of
Mr. Aggarwal, appearing on behalf of the respondent was that after
compromise as mentioned in the compromise agreement dated
OMP No. 76/2006

Page 3 of 7

15.06.2006 no dispute was left to be arbitrated by the Arbitrator in
terms of para 8 contained in the Collaboration Agreement dated
07.08.2004 entered into between the parties in respect of the suit
property bearing No. 142, Hargovind Enclave, Delhi-110092. Mr.
Aggarwal has also relied upon a judgment of this Court in M/s
Saraswati Industrial Syndicate Ltd. Vs. M/s Apollo Tyres
Limited, ILR (1986) I Delhi 382 in support of his arguments that
when the parties to the Collaboration Agreement dated 07.08.2004
which contained an arbitration clause had given a go bye to the said
agreement by arriving at a mutual settlement, the applicant cannot
revert to the original arbitration agreement contained in the
Collaboration

Agreement

referred

above.

In

M/s

Saraswati

Industrial Syndicate Ltd.'s case (Supra), it was held by this Court as
under:“1.

There could be no doubt that where the parties

agreed to refer their disputes and differences to arbitration
but subsequently ignoring the arbitration agreement, the
parties mutually through their representatives agree and
arrive at a settlement and that settlement is acted upon as
well in part, then only the subsequently arrived at
settlement would govern the relations of the parties
thereafter and the parties cannot be permitted to ignore
such a settlement so as to have recourse to the original
arbitration
OMP No. 76/2006

agreement.

In

these

circumstances,

the
Page 4 of 7

arbitration agreement stands discharges, abrogated and
abandoned and the same becomes infructuous and cannot
be revived by any of the parties.
The law requires a subsisting arbitration agreement
and not an arbitration agreement which has been
abrogated, abandoned or waived. In view thereof, an
abrogated, abandoned and waived arbitration agreement
would not be of any consequence so as to help the defendant.

6

In the above referred case, there was no dispute regarding

mutual settlement arrived at between the parties after they had
entered into an arbitration agreement. However, in the present case
the applicant is seriously disputing the genuineness of the
compromise which is evident from the order passed by this Court on
23.11.2006 noting that no compromise was arrived at between the
parties till that date. The respondent/non-applicant is relying upon
the purported compromise allegedly arrived at between the parties
on 15.06.2006 i.e. prior to the date of 23.11.2006 when it was
recorded that no settlement had taken place between the parties. In
case the settlement as alleged had taken place then why the
respondent took time on 23.11.2006 for filing of reply to the
applicant's main application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996. This strengthen the plea of the applicant that
the main application under Section 9 was got dismissed as having
OMP No. 76/2006

Page 5 of 7

become infructuous by the respondent by misleading the Court
taking advantage of the absence of the main counsel for the
applicant. Since in the present case, the genuineness of the
compromise has been disputed, it cannot be said that the parties had
given a go bye to the arbitration agreement contained in the
Collaboration Agreement dated 07.08.2004 entered into between the
applicant and the respondent.
7

In view of the above the order dated 11.09.2007 is recalled and

the main application of the applicant under Section 9 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is restored for hearing on
merits.
8

Since on the date the applicant's main application under

Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 was
dismissed, there was an interim order operating against the
respondent by which she was restrained from creating any third
party interest in respect of the suit property, the said order has also
to be restored. The interim order dated 02.03.2006 which was
operative till 11.09.2007 is therefore revived.
9

The instant application stands disposed of.
