1.
The petitioner was appointed as a Teacher in the
year 1964. During the period of emergency, break in service
was given to the petitioner and many other similarly situated
persons. However, thereafter he was re-employed vide letter
dated 12.11.1976 but in a lower scale. Some similarly situated
employees had approached the Central Administrative Tribunal

W.P. (C) No. 5877/2007

(hereinafter referred to as the 'Tribunal') and orders were
passed by the Tribunal condoning break in service and
directing grant of full pay etc. These orders were passed on
31.5.1988. Subsequently, the respondents passed the order
condoning the break in service in the petitioner's case as well.
After the passing of these orders, the scale of pay, which the
petitioner was earlier enjoying, was restored and his pay was
re-fixed on 28.9.1994. The petitioner continued to enjoy this
pay scale, and correspondingly higher pay scales for the rest of
his career on revision of pay scales from time to time. He
retired on 31.7.2003 and as on that date his basic pay was
Rs.10,900/-.

However,

much

after

his

retirement,

the

respondents refixed his pay by lowering it down on the ground
that in the year 1994 it was wrongly fixed. On the basis of this
re-fixation, the pension of the petitioner has been reduced and
the excess payment made to the petitioner has also been
deducted from the gratuity paid to him.
2.

This action of the respondents was challenged by

the petitioner by filing OA before the Tribunal.

One of the

contentions raised before the Tribunal was that before revising
the pay and reducing the same, no show cause notice was
served upon the petitioner. The learned Tribunal has, however,
W.P. (C) No. 5877/2007

Page 2

of 8

dismissed the petition of the petitioner on the ground that
service of show cause notice would not have served any
purpose as no other conclusion was possible and no prejudice
has been caused to the petitioner.

For this, the Tribunal

referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Aligarh
Muslim University and Others v. Mansoor Ali Khan, 2007 (7)
SCC 529.
3.

We are of the opinion that the Tribunal is not right,

in the facts of this case, in holding that the purported mistake
could be rectified without issuance of show cause notice and
without giving an opportunity to the petitioner of being heard.
4.

A perusal of the basic facts noted above would

indicate that the petitioner had enjoyed the revised pay scale
and drawn salary accordingly from 1994 till the date of his
retirement in July 2003. The pay is now revised downward and
the respondent even have made deductions from the gratuity
payable to the petitioner. How, in these circumstances, it can
be said that no prejudice is caused to the petitioner, more so
when it will have impact on his pension as well, is difficult to
understand or accept.
5.

Learned counsel for the respondent has referred to

Office Order No. 237 dated 12.11.1976 vide which the
W.P. (C) No. 5877/2007

Page 3

petitioner was re-employed and on that basis, he submits that
since the petitioner was earlier rendered surplus and it was a
case of re-employment, in this letter it was categorically
mentioned that his pay would be fixed at the minimum of time
scale and in view of this Office Order, the action of the
respondent was correct in re-fixing the pay inasmuch as pay in
the year 1994 was revised wrongly and by ignoring the
aforesaid

stipulation

contained

in

Office

Order

dated

12.11.1976.
6.

Learned counsel for the petitioner, on the other

hand, has submitted that after this Office Order, on the basis of
which the petitioner was taken back in the employment, a
conscious decision was taken by the respondent to condone
the break in service, the effect whereof was that the petitioner
was treated as in continuous employment. He further states
that many employees had approached the Tribunal and the
Tribunal had given the judgment and it is on the basis of this
judgment that order dated 28.9.1994 was passed re-fixing the
pay by giving benefit of the said judgment to the petitioner as
well, who was similarly situated.
7.

In view of the above, the contention of the

respondent that the conclusion about the re-fixation of lower
W.P. (C) No. 5877/2007

Page 4

of 8

pay, reduction of pension and recovery from the retiral dues of
the petitioner is obvious on the basis of Office Order dated
12.11.1976, does not appear to be correct. It is clear that the
petitioner had much to say against the action of the
respondent. Therefore, in a case like this, we are of the view
that action could not have been taken without serving show
cause notice to the petitioner and giving him opportunity of
being heard.
8.

We have also been shown the order dated 30th April

1992 in O.A. No. 1870/89 “Shri H.K.Anand v. Delhi
Administration & Anr.” and other connected OA's passed by
the Tribunal. The Tribunal in this order has reproduced the
operative part of the orders passed in the various transfer
applications bearing Nos. T-71/86, T-541/86, T-533/86, etc.,
which reads as follows:

9.

“9. In the facts and circumstances, we
decree the suits declaring the order of
termination of the plaintiffs' service in 1976
as illegal and directing that the break in
service between August 1976 and 1978
should be condoned with all consequential
benefits of seniority, pension, back wages,
etc., in full. There will be no order as to
costs.”
Learned counsel for the Petitioner argued that, in

fact, the order dated 28th September 1994 was issued by
adopting the anology of the decision of the Tribunal in the
W.P. (C) No. 5877/2007

Page 5

aforesaid transfer petitions, and with the approval of the
Director, Training and Technical Education, the break in service
in respect of the Petitioner was condoned from 19.8.1976 to
12.11.1976.

The

principal

of

Government

Boys

Senior

Secondary School, Railway Colony, Tughlakabad, New Delhi,
passed an order in pursuance of the order of the Deputy
Director, Technical Education and with the approval of the
Director, Technical Education, whereby the Petitioner's pay was
fixed in the pay scale of Rs.550 - 900.
10.

The submission of the Respondent that the Principal

of the Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Railway
Colony, Tughlakabad, New Delhi wrongly fixed the pay of the
Petitioner at Rs.750/- in the scale of Rs.550-900 and that the
same should have been fixed in the pay scale of Rs.440-750/-,
even if assumed to be correct, in our view would not provide
any justification for effecting recovery, on the basis of their
own pay fixation, which was undertaken about 11 years ago
from the date the recovery was sought to be effected. It is not
the Respondent's case that the Petitioner had any role to play
in the fixation of his pay in the fixation of his pay in a higher
pay scale. It is well settled that in such circumstances, no
recovery could be effected from the employee (see Shyam
W.P. (C) No. 5877/2007

Babu Verma v. UOI, (1994) 2 SCC 521 and Col. B.J. Akkara
(Retd) v. Government of India, (2006) 11 SCC 709,
K.S.R.T.C. v. K.O. Verghese & Others (2003) 12 SCC 293).
11.

The Petitioner had retired on 31.7.2003 and only on

7th October 2005, the Respondent sought to re-fixed the pay of
the Petitioner from the year 1976 onwards and on that basis
effected recovery from the retiral dues and also to reduce the
pension of the Petitioner. This, in our view, would be highly
inequitable and unfair to the petitioner.
12.

Apart from the aforesaid consideration, we also find

force in the Petitioner's submission that the Respondent was
wrong in its contention that the Petitioner was not entitled to
draw salary of Rs.550-900. He has drawn our attention to an
office order dated 28.9.1976, which shows that as per the
increments to which the Petitioner was shown to be entitled as
on 1st September 1975 his revised pay was fixed at Rs.725/which is in the revise pay scale and not in the pre-existing
scale. This shows that the Petitioner was in the revised scale of
Rs.550-900

to

dated 8th January 2007 and allow the Petitioner's aforesaid
original application and quash Respondent's action in revising
the pay of the Petitioner, reducing his pension and withholding
the amount of Rs.1,68,704/- on account of excess pay and
allowance paid to him. We further direct the Respondents to
make payment to the Petitioner all the amounts withheld, as
well as to pay the Petitioner, his full pension as per the salary
last drawn by him and to make the payment of the arrears of
the difference in the pension within four weeks from today.
The petition is allowed in the aforesaid terms, with,
cost.
