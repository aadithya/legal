V.B.Gupta, J.

The following substantial question of law arises in
the present appeal:-

ITA No.532/2007

Page 1 of 13

“Whether
on
the
facts
and
circumstances of the present case,
assessee is eligible for deduction under
Section 80-O of the Income Tax Act,
1961?”

2.

Brief facts of this case are that the assessee

claimed to have rendered technical services out of
India as buying agent and thus claimed to be eligible
for deduction of Rs. 3,20,81,836/- under Section 80-O
of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short as „Act‟).
However,

as

Rs.1,40,50,080/-,

positive
the

income

deduction

was
under

shown
the

provision was restricted to the income shown.

at

above
The

Assessing Officer was however of the view that the
assessee has merely rendered managerial services not
of technical nature and thus requirement of Section
80-O of the Act was not satisfied.

The Assessing

Officer thus denied the deduction claimed by the
assessee.
3.

On appeal filed by the assessee, the CIT(A) held

that services rendered by the assessee are professional

ITA No.532/2007

Page 2 of 13

and / or technical services and view taken by the
Assessing Officer that technical services would be
restricted to services which are purely technical in
nature involving scientific or engineering experience is
taking too narrow view of the matter and held that the
assessee is entitled to deduction under Section 80-O of
the Act.
4.

Being aggrieved with the order passed by the

CIT(A), the revenue filed an appeal before the Tribunal
and vide the impugned order the Tribunal held that
30% of the fees received by the assessee is taken
towards services rendered in India and 70% of fees
received by the assessee is taken to be qualified for
deduction

under

Section

80-O

of

the

Act

and

accordingly directed the Assessing Officer to recompute the deduction.
5.

The assessee has challenged the order of the

Tribunal passed in ITA No.1547/Del/2001 relevant for

ITA No.532/2007

Page 3 of 13

the assessment year 1997-98 by way of the present
appeal.
6.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

Assessee that the assessee company is incorporated in
India with the object of providing buying services from
India to various principals and the services rendered
by the assessee requires knowledge, expertise and
experience and were essentially technical services and
in any case, even if it was to be held that a portion of
the said services were managerial services, the same
would be regarded as technical services as defined in
Explanation (2) to Section 9(i)(vii) of the Act and
therefore, covered under Section 80-O of the Act.
Further, the services rendered to the foreign principal
no doubt originate in India but terminate outside India
only when the foreign client is communicated the
contents and factum of rendition of services. It is also
submitted that even if the benefit of the services was
utilized by the foreign principals to further their
business interest in India, the services rendered by the
ITA No.532/2007

Page 4 of 13

assessee were to be regarded as rendered from India
in the terms of the Circular of Central Board of Direct
Taxes, No.700 dated 23rd March, 1995.
7.

Learned counsel in support of his contentions has

cited a decision of this Court in The Commissioner of

Income Tax vs. Mittal Corporation [2005] 272 ITR
87.
8.

On the other hand, it has been argued by learned

counsel for the revenue that the assessee in this case
was rendering services to foreign buyers in India and
according to Explanation (iii) to Section 80-O of the Act
no deductions are permissible in respect of services
rendered in India.

It is further contended that if

certain portion of the services are rendered outside
India, then the assessee could only be allowed
deduction qua such portion of services. The deduction
could not be allowed on the whole amount and on this
point learned counsel for the revenue has relied upon a

ITA No.532/2007

Page 5 of 13

decision of the Apex Court in the case of Continental

Construction Ltd. vs CIT [1992] 195 ITR 81.
9.

Section 80-O of the Act as applicable during the

relevant assessment year provides for deduction in
respect of consideration received, inter alia, for
rendering professional and technical services from
India. The relevant provisions of this Section read as
under:“Section 80-O- Deduction in respect of
royalties, etc., from certain foreign
enterprises.
Where the gross total income of an
assessee, being an Indian company or a
person (other than a company) who is
resident in India, includes any income by
way of royalty commission, fees or any
similar payment received by the assessee
from the Government of a foreign State or
foreign enterprise....or in consideration of
technical or professional services rendered
or agreed to be rendered outside India to
such Govt. or enterprise by the assessee,
and such income is received in convertible
foreign exchange in India, or having been
received in convertible foreign exchange
outside India, is brought into India, by or
on behalf of the assessee in accordance
with any law for the time being in force for
regulating payments and dealings in

ITA No.532/2007

Page 6 of 13

foreign exchange, there shall be allowed,
in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of this section, a deduction of an
amount equal to fifty percent of the income
so received in, or brought into, India in
computing the total income of the
assessee.
Explanation: For the purposes of this
section………..
(iii) Services rendered or agreed to be
rendered outside India shall include
services rendered from India but shall not
include services rendered in India”.

10. Section 80-O of the Act does not define the term
„technical‟ or „professional services‟.
11. Clause (a) to Explanation to Section 194J of the
Act defines the expression „professional services‟
means services rendered by a person in the course of
carrying

on

architectural
accountancy

legal,

medical,

profession
or

technical

or

the

engineering
profession

consultancy

or

or
of

interior

decoration or advertising or such other profession as is
notified by the Board for the purposes of Section 44AA
or Section 194J of the Act.
ITA No.532/2007

Page 7 of 13

12. Clause (b) of the said explanation defines „fees for
technical services‟ to have the same meaning as in
Explanation 2 to Section 9(I)(vii) of the Act which is as
follows:
13. For the purpose of this Section, „fees for technical
services‟ means any consideration (including any lump
sum

consideration)

managerial,

for

technical

the
or

rendering
consultancy

of

any

services

(including the provision of services of technical or
other personnel) but does not include consideration for
any construction, assembly, mining or like project
undertaken by the recipient or consideration which
would be income of the recipient chargeable under the
head „salaries‟.
14. The word „technical‟ has been defined in the
Oxford Dictionary to mean, inter alia,
“of or involving or concerned with
mechanical arts and applied sciences; of
or relating to a particular subject or craft
etc. or its techniques, requiring special
knowledge to be understood.”

ITA No.532/2007

Page 8 of 13

15. The

Supreme

Court

in

Continental

Construction case (supra) explained the scope of the
term „technical services‟ as follows:
“….the expression „technical services‟ has
a very broad connotation and it has been
used elsewhere in the statue also so
widely as to comprehend professional
services: vide Section 9(1)(vii) referred to
earlier. But we need not digress on this
aspect for two reasons. Firstly, whatever,
may be the position regarding other
„professional services‟, there can hardly be
any
doubt
that
services
involving
specialized knowledge, experience and
skill in the field of constructional
operations are „technical services‟.”
16. In

Mittal

Corporation

case

(supra)

the

assessee received commission income as buying agent
of foreign enterprises. The assessee claimed deduction
under section 80-O of the Act on commission income
which

was

earned

on

providing

commercial

information to the foreign buyers. It was held that:“Thus, it cannot be said that the assessee
must provide “technical services” even
where it receives consideration for only
providing commercial information. The
section is required to be interpreted
accordingly. On the facts, the Tribunal

ITA No.532/2007

Page 9 of 13

clearly held that there is no dispute that it
is commercial information which the
assessee provided to the foreign buyers
and in consideration thereof, the assessee
received commission which was in
convertible foreign exchange. In view of
this, the claim made by the assessee
cannot be denied under section 80-O of
the Act.”
17. Thus, in view of the aforesaid factual situation, it
is clear that the services rendered by the assessee
require knowledge, expertise and experience and fee
received

from

foreign

enterprises

for

supply

of

commercial information sent from India for use outside
India is eligible for deduction under section 80-O of the
Act.
18. Learned counsel for the assessee has also placed
reliance on Central Board of Direct Taxes, Circular
No.700 dated 23.3.1995, which reads as under:“Deduction under section 80-O of the
Income Tax Act, 1961
- clarification regarding.
Section 80-O of the Act, provides for a
deduction of 50 per cent from the
income of an India resident by way of
royalty, commission, fees or any similar

ITA No.532/2007

Page 10 of 13

payment from a foreign Government or
enterprise:(a) in consideration for the use
outside India of
any patent, invention, model, design,
secret formula or process, etc; or
(b) in consideration of technical or
profession services rendered or agreed
to be rendered outside India to such
foreign Government or enterprise.
In either case, the requirement is that
the income should be in convertible
foreign exchange.
It has been clarified in Explanation (iii)
to section 80-O that services rendered
or agreed to be rendered outside India
(i.e. item(b) above) shall include
services rendered from India but shall
not include services rendered in India.
A question has been raised as to
whether the benefit of section 80-O of
the Act would be available if the
technical and professional services,
though rendered outside India, are used
by
the
foreign
Government
or
enterprise in India.
The matter has been considered by the
Board. It is clarified that as long as the
technical and professional services are
rendered from India and are received
by a foreign Government or enterprise
outside India, deduction under section
80-O of the Act would be available to
the person rendering the services even
if the foreign recipient of the services

ITA No.532/2007

Page 11 of 13

utilizes the benefit of such services in
India.”
19. On the facts of the present case, it is clear
that since the contract obliged the assessee to
make available information and render services to
the foreign client of the nature outlined in Section
80-O of the Act and the Circular No.700 dated
23.3.95 and in consideration thereof, the assesse
received the payment which was in convertible
foreign exchange. Therefore, the assesse is to be
given the benefit of the deduction available under
the section to the extent of such consideration.
The claim made by the assessee cannot be denied
under section 80-O of the Act and thus the
Tribunal erred in law in restricting the claim of
deduction under Section 80-O of the Act to 70%.
20. The assessee is allowed to qualify for the
deduction under Section 80-O of the Act.

Thus,

the substantial question of law is decided in the

ITA No.532/2007

Page 12 of 13

affirmative, in favour of the Assessee and against
the Revenue.
21. Accordingly, the appeal stands allowed.
