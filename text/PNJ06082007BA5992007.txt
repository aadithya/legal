approached this court
petitions.

by and under the two captioned

Whereas Sandeep Chopra seeks regular bail, Anjali

Lekhi seeks anticipatory bail.
2.

Both the petitioners are accused in FIR No.39/2007

P.S. Chittaranjan Park attracting Sections 498A/304B IPC.
3.

The complainant is Anita Bhatia whose daughter

Shaifali was married to to Sandeep Chopra on 6.3.2006.
4.

Shaifali gave

birth to a baby boy

on 18.1.2007.

She was found dead on 9.2.2007. Cause of death is asphyxia.
She was found hanging from a ceiling fan.
5.

Since arguments of learned counsel for Sandeep

Chopra centered around the language of the FIR, it would be
useful for me to note relevant part of the FIR whereon would
turn the fate of the two captioned petitions.
6.

Inter alia, FIR records as under :“..........On 6.3.2006 marriage was solemnized
at Faridabad and spent about Rs.30 lakhs.
After some days of marriage one day he
came to our house and told that why you have
not called my
friend Raju @ Raj Kumar
Kashyap mobile No.9873111115, who is my
everything, he should be treated better than
me.
............He is habitual drunker and
gambler. He used to abuse us on phone and
used to fight with our daughter. ............ On
18.1.2007 a child was born to our daughter
on that occasion he was demanding Skoda
car when on the marriage we had given
Page 2 of 6

7.

Ascent car-red colour (HR-29P4907) but he
gave the same to his sister.
...........Before
the marriage it was told that the son-in-law
was Graduage but he was Matric. He had told
us that if you fail to fulfill the demands of my,
my friends and my family I would leave your
daughter in your house. He used to come
home after 11 PM after drinking and used to
address filthy language to our daughter and
used to beat her despite her pregnant
condition.”
It is urged by learned counsel for Sandeep Chopra

that a perusal of the FIR shows that the gravement of the
allegations against the petitioner is his friendship with Raju
leading to fight between the husband and wife. Counsel urges
that the complaint, based whereon FIR has been registered,
evidences that the cause of death of Shaifali was friendship of
her husband with Raju.
8.

As regards Sandeep's sister namely Anjali, learned

counsel urges that only allegation against his client is that
Accent car stated to have been

gifted by the parents of

Shaifali at the time of her marriage was handed over to Anjali
by her parents and her brother. Counsel urges that there is no
assertion in the complaint that Anjali took away the car or
that, Anjali desired a car from the parents of her prospective
sister-in-law.

Counsel urges that Anjali is married and is

residing with her husband in Ludhiana. Her brother along with

Page 3 of 6

the deceased was residing at Chittaranjan Park.
9.

Before dealing with the respective submissions,

I

may additionally note that Sandeep Chopra has predicated
claim for bail on an alternative ground, being that, there is
nobody to look after his son.
10.

Dealing with the case pleaded by Anjali, as noted

above, in the FIR, only allegation pertaining to her is that the
Accent car gifted by the parents of Shaifali was handed over to
her by her brother.

There are no allegations that

Anjali

desired the car.
11.

Learned counsel for the State does not dispute that

the car was recovered from the house at Chittaranjan Park
where Shaifali died. It was in the custody of her husband.
12.
parents.

Anjali is married and is settled in Ludhiana with her
The car not being recovered from her and there

being hardly any allegations against

Anjali

in FIR, case is

made out to grant anticipatory bail to Anjali.
13.

As regards Sandeep, no case is made out to admit

him to bail for the reason, it is an incorrect reading of the FIR
that gravement

of the allegation

against Sandeep is his

friendship with Raju.
14.

The gravement of the allegation against Sandeep
Page 4 of 6

is that he was a habitual drunker and a gambler. He over
stated the qualification to get married to a girl from a decent
background.

To enjoy a luxurious life, he was harassing his

wife compelling her to get more and more from her parents.
As I read the FIR, reference to Raju is in the context of the
mental trauma faced by Anjali for, according to her mother,
Sandeep was bothered more about his prestige in the eyes of
his friend Raju and was least bothered about his wife.
15.

I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that Shaifali could

not even enjoy her motherhood for even a month. No mother
would snuff off her life thereby depriving her new born the love
and affection, care and the blessings of the mother. Trauma of
Anjali speaks for itself.
16.

As regards the alternative plea of mercy, namely

that, the young child has nobody to care for him, I record the
statement made by the counsel for the complainant that the
maternal grand parents of the child are prepared to look after
their grand son.
17.

I further note that in the bail application, in para 1,

Sandeep Chopra has pleaded as under :“1. That the applicant is a law abiding
citizen, is a hard working business man and
had been living in a joint family consisting of
Page 5 of 6

18.

his parents, two elder brothers with their
wives and children. All family members were
living happily with no problem financial or
otherwise.”
If Sandeep's parents and two elder brothers

and

their wives and children are common in mess, where is the
question of Sandeep's presence being fatal to the growth of the
unfortunate young child born to Anjali?
19.

The young child can be brought up by his grant

parents or his uncles or aunty's.
20.

Bail application No.1250/2007 is dismissed.

21.

Bail Application No.599/2007 is disposed of directing

that if required for investigation, Anjali would join the
investigation; and in the event of her being arrested, the I.O.
would release Anjali to bail on her furnishing a personal bond
in the sum of Rs.20,000/- with one surety in the like amount to
the satisfaction of the I.O. In FIR No.39/2007 P.S. Chittaranjan
Park under Section 498A/304 B IPC.
22.

Copy of the order be supplied dasti to counsel for

the petitioners.
