V.B. GUPTA, J.
Appellant has filed the present appeal under Section
260A of Income Tax Act, 1961(hereinafter referred to as
Act) against the impugned order dated 31st January, 2006
ITA No.1291/2006

Page 1 of 7

passed by Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter
referred to as Tribunal) in ITA No.4778/Del/03 for the
assessment year 2000-01.

By the said order the claim

made by the Appellant under Section 32(1)(iii) of the Act
for write off of discarded/obsolete machinery amounting to
Rs.40,83,828/- was disallowed.
2.

The brief facts of the case are that Appellant-company

is engaged in manufacturing and trading of
other computer consumables.

Till the

floppy and

close of the

immediately preceding year relevant to assessment year
1999-2000, it had been manufacturing computer floppies.
The plant and machinery installed

in the financial year

1984-85 and 1994 had been extensively used by it for this
purpose.

As the technology in the field

of computer

consumables had advanced manifold since the installation
of the plant and machinery, the system of electronic
equipment used by the Appellant became obsolete and
commercially un-viable and as such the Board of Directors
of Appellant-company approved the discarding off of the
obsolete plant and machinery and accordingly

Appellant

claimed deduction for write off of the discarded plant and
ITA No.1291/2006

Page 2 of 7

machinery during the period under consideration.
3.

The Assessing Officer denied the claim of such write

off on the grounds that as per the provision of Section
32(1)(iii) of the Act, the machinery should have been used
at least for a part of the accounting year to claim
depreciation in the year in which the same was sold or
otherwise discarded. Since, it was not so used during the
period under consideration, he disallowed the Appellant
claim of Rs.40,83,828/4.
an

Being aggrieved against this order, the Appellant filed
appeal

before

the

Commissioner

of

Income

Tax

(Appeals) who concurred with the finding of the Assessing
Officer. On further appeal, the Tribunal upheld the finding
of the Commissioner of Income Tax(A). Hence the present
appeal.
5.

It has been argued by learned counsel for the

Appellant that sub-clause (iii) of Section 32(1) of the Act
does not deal with the allowance of depreciation but deals
with deduction for discarding, demolition, destruction or
sale of the depreciable assets. All that the Section requires
is that the assets should have been used for the purposes of
ITA No.1291/2006

Page 3 of 7

business in the earlier years on which depreciation should
have been allowed and such assets should form part of the
Block of Assets on which depreciation was claimed in the
earlier years. It does not mandate that such assets should
have been used in the year of discarding, demolition and
sale.

User of machinery in the year of discarding,

demolition and sale etc. is not mandatory condition. The
interpretation given by the Tribunal that, user of machinery
in the year of discarding, demolition or sale etc. is one of
the mandatory condition for allowing deduction under
Section 32(1)(iii) of the Act, is not correct.
6.

On the other hand it has been argued by the learned

counsel for the Revenue that no infirmity can be found with
the order of the Tribunal and in its support learned counsel

7.

The relevant provision for disposal of the present

appeal is Section 32(1)(iii) of Act, which reads as under:ITA No.1291/2006

Page 4 of 7

“Depreciation
Section 32.(1) In respect of depreciation of(i) buildings, machinery, plant
furniture, being tangible assets;

or

(ii)know-how, patents, copyrights, trade
marks, licences, franchises or any other
business or commercial rights of similar
nature, being intangible assets acquired
on or after the 1st day of April, 1998,
owned, wholly or partly, by the assessee and used for the
purposes of the business or profession, the following
deduction shall be allowed(i) xxx xxx

xxx

(ii) xxx xxx

xxx

(iia)xxx xxx

xxx

(iii) in the case of any building, machinery, plant or
furniture in respect of which depreciation is
claimed and allowed under clause (i) and which
is sold, discarded, demolished or destroyed in
the previous year (other than the previous year
in which it is first brought into use), the amount
by which the moneys payable in respect of such
building, machinery, plant or furniture, together
with the amount of scrap value, if any, fail short
of the written down value thereof;”
8.

A bare reading of this provision will show that one of

the conditions for allowing the above deduction is that the
machinery must have been used for the purposes of the
business during the previous year in which the machinery
ITA No.1291/2006

Page 5 of 7

is sold, discarded, demolished or destroyed. There is no
dispute between the parties on this issue. The only dispute
is as to whether the machinery was so, used or not.
9.

There is a concurrent finding of three authorities

below, i.e. the Assessing Officer, Commissioner of Income
Tax (A) and Income Tax Appellate Tribunal to the effect
that the machinery was not put to use at all during the
relevant previous year.
10.

We do not find any reason to differ with the finding of

fact recorded by all these authorities and there is nothing
on record to show that the machinery in question was put
to use during the relevant previous year.
11.

In case of Maharashtra Minerals Corporation

Ltd.(supra) while discussing the provisions of Section
32(1)(iii)

of

the Act, a Division Bench of Bombay High

Court, held that:“Now as regards the legal position,
we are of the view that the asset,
which is sold or discarded or is
demolished and the loss on which is
claimed under section 32(1)(iii) of the
Act, must have been used for the
purpose of the business or profession
of the assessee in the year of
assessment in which it was claimed
ITA No.1291/2006

Page 6 of 7

12.
that

and the fact that the asset may have
been used for the purpose of the
business in the earlier years, will not
entitle the assessee to the allowance
under section 32(1)(iii), if the same
was sold or discarded in a subsequent
assessment year.” “
In view of the above discussion, we are of the opinion
no

substantial

question

of

law

arises

for

our

consideration and we do not find any error in the view that
has been taken by the Tribunal in this regard.
13.

Consequently, the appeal is dismissed.
