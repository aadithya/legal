DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ (oral)
1.

We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties on

these appeals which relate to grant of licence of a Kerosene Oil Depot
by the respondent No.2 and we propose to dispose of both these
appeals by this common judgment and order as they arise from cross
writ petitions.
2.

One of the said writ petitions was filed by the appellant Krishan

Gupta being Writ Petition No.4515/1994 and the other by the appellant
Hari Shankar. The appellant Krishan Gupta as also the respondent No.1
Hari Shankar, one of the respondents in the present appeal and the
appellant in LPA No.2238/2005, are the two aspirants for grant of
licence for the Kerosene Oil Depot in the year 1994. Krishan Gupta,
appellant in LPA No.2595/2005, was not successful and the same was
granted to Hari Shankar which was renewed from time to time and said
Hari Shankar was enjoying the said benefit on the basis of the renewal
granted.

The writ petition was, therefore, filed challenging the

LPA No.2595/2005 & 2238/2005

page No.2 of

allotment of the licence in favour of Hari Shankar.

The said writ

petition was heard and disposed of by the learned Single Judge by
passing an order dated 23rd August, 2005. In paragraph Nos. 9 & 10,
the following order/direction was issued by the learned Single judge:“9.
During the pendency of this writ petition for over
one decade, the licence issued to respondent No.2 has
been renewed from time to time. The course that
commends itself, therefore, is that this licence shall
not be renewed on the expiry of its present term.
Fresh applications will be invited by the respondent
No.1, Government of NCT of Delhi and the decision
whom to grant the KOD licence shall thereafter be
taken in accordance with law.
10. Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed and a
direction is hereby issued to respondent No.1 not to
renew the licence granted to respondent No.2 on the
expiry of its current tenure. A grievous violation of law
has occurred for which there would be no alternative
but to conclude that the impugned decision was taken
by the Commissioner instead of the Assistant
Commissioner on the dictates of the Minister and the
MLA concerned.
Respondent No.1 shall take
immediate steps inviting fresh applications within
thirty days from today for grant of a licence of the
subject KOD.”
3.

The appellant is aggrieved by the aforesaid findings recorded by

the learned Single Judge only to the extent that instead of quashing the
licence granted by the respondent No.2 to the respondent No.1 Hari
Shankar, the direction which is sought to be issued is that the licence
which was granted in 1994 and renewed from time to time, should not
be further renewed on the expiry of the present term. Needless to

LPA No.2595/2005 & 2238/2005

page No.3 of

state, the said Hari Shankar is also aggrieved by the aforesaid
directions contained in para 9 and 10 of the impugned order.
4.

The original licence was granted in favour of

Hari Shankar in

1994 and thereafter it was renewed from time to time.

In the

meantime the policy and the terms and conditions of allotment of
licence have also changed and, therefore, it is necessary to call for
fresh licences in accordance with law. We are informed by the counsel
appearing for the respondent No.2, that advertisement has already
been issued calling for fresh applications for grant of licence of a
Kerosene Oil Depot pursuant to which applications have been received.
In that view of the matter, we find no reason to interfere with the order
passed by the learned Single Judge for we also believe that fresh
licence is to be issued by calling for fresh applications.

All the persons

who are eligible can submit their applications as against the aforesaid
advertisement for allotment of such Kerosine Oil Depot.
5.

At this stage we are informed that there was a subsequent

development pursuant to which the matter is now pending for
consideration before the selection board. It is, however, submitted by
the counsel for the respondent No.2 that the licence has already been
issued.

These facts are not part of our records.

We accordingly

dispose of these appeals holding that it shall be open to the parties to
approach the Competent Authority with an appropriate application,

LPA No.2595/2005 & 2238/2005

which when filed shall be considered by the respondent No.2 in
accordance with law.
