MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
This judgment is in respect of two writ petitions. The first is
Writ Petition (Civil) No.17423 of 2006 in which the prayer of the
Petitioner is for quashing Order No.449 dated 7th November, 2006
passed by the Joint Commissioner of Sales Tax under the provisions of
Section 46 of the Delhi Sales Tax Act, 1975 (for short the DST Act) in
respect of the assessment years 1997-98 to 1999-2000 (three years).
Section 46 of the DST Act deals with the suo motu revisionary powers
of the Commissioner of Sales Tax and according to the Petitioner,
neither the Commissioner nor his delegate, the Joint Commissioner, had
any jurisdiction to pass the order since the DST Act was repealed by the
Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004 (the VAT Act) which came into force
with effect from 1st April, 2005.

2.

The second is Writ Petition (Civil) No.17391 of 2006 in

which the prayer of the Petitioner is for setting aside Order No.437
dated 20th October, 2006 issued by the Joint Commissioner of Sales Tax
under the provisions of Rule 29 of the Delhi Sales Tax Rules, 1975 (for
short the Rules) in respect of the assessment years 1997-98 to 1999-

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 2 of 23

2000 (three years). According to the Petitioner, it was entitled to a
refund of sales tax erroneously levied and demanded but that was
declined by the impugned order.

3.

Broadly speaking, the Petitioner is a limited company

engaged in the manufacture, sale and purchase of electronic items. It
has a chain of distributors and dealers through whom its goods are sold
to ultimate consumers. The Petitioner does not, by itself, sell any goods
directly to the consumers – sales are effected only through the
distributors/dealers.

4.

According to the Petitioner, it had floated schemes by virtue

of which it offered trade discounts against the catalogue price of the
goods for the benefit of the distributors and dealers. The Petitioner also
gave cash discounts on immediate payments. Contracts were entered
into by the Petitioner with its distributors and dealers and the discounts
were offered through credit notes issued to them. According to the
Petitioner, the credit notes included the tax amount.

5.

In respect of the assessment year 1997-98, the Assessing

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 3 of 23

Officer under the DST Act framed an assessment on 29th September,
2000 whereby it disallowed the claim of the Petitioner for trade
discounts said to have been given to its distributors and dealers.

6.

Feeling aggrieved by the assessment order dated 29 th

September, 2000, the Petitioner preferred an appeal before the
concerned Deputy Commissioner who set aside the assessment order
and remanded the matter for a fresh consideration by the Assessing
Officer under the DST Act. This was on 16th April, 2001.

7.

The only issue before the Deputy Commissioner/Appellate

Authority was whether the trade discount given by the Petitioner to its
distributors and dealers through credit notes has rightly been disallowed
and tax imposed thereon.

8.

During

the

course

of

hearing

before

the

Deputy

Commissioner/Appellate Authority, the Petitioner placed reliance on
The Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax (Law) v. Advani Oerlikon (P)
Ltd., [1980] 45 STC 32. In this decision, the Supreme Court made a
distinction between a cash discount and a trade discount. It was held as

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 4 of 23

follows:
“Cash discount is allowed when the purchaser makes
payment promptly or within the period of credit allowed. It
is a discount granted in consideration of expeditious
payment. A trade discount is a deduction from the catalogue
price of goods allowed by wholesalers to retailers engaged in
the trade. The allowance enables the retailer to sell the goods
at the catalogue price and yet make a reasonable margin of
profit after taking into account his business expense. The
outward invoice sent by a wholesale dealer to a retailer
shows the catalogue price and against that a deduction of the
trade discount is shown. The net amount is the sale price,
and it is that net amount which is entered in the books of the
respective parties as the amount realisable.”

In view of the decision of the Supreme Court, since a trade
discount does not enter into the composition of the sale price but exists
apart from and outside it and prior to it, it cannot be included in the
taxable turnover.

Therefore, according to the Petitioner, the trade

discount offered by it to its distributors and dealers could not be
included in its taxable turnover. Following the decision of the Supreme
Court, the Deputy Commissioner/Appellate Authority decided in favour
of the Petitioner and required the Assessing Officer to have a fresh look
at the matter.

9.

On 7th April, 2003, the Assessing Officer reconsidered the

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 5 of 23

case of the Petitioner and for the assessment year 1997-98, he granted a
refund of Rs.5,15,656/-. The Assessing Officer noted that the Assessee
had filed a complete set of credit notes showing credit of sales tax to the
respective parties. One of the issues canvassed by learned counsel
appearing before the Assessing Officer was that the sales tax had
already been returned by issuing credit notes and this was examined by
the Deputy Commissioner/Appellate Authority who accepted the
contention of the Petitioner. Based on the facts of the case as well as the
submissions made by the Petitioner, the Assessing Officer examined the
record and allowed the claim made by the Assessee.

10.

In respect of the assessment year 1998-99, the assessment of

the Petitioner went through the same fate and on remand by the Deputy
Commissioner, the Assessing Officer passed an order on 8th December,
2003 accepting the claim of the Petitioner and he granted a refund of
Rs.3,68,601/-.

11.

In respect of the assessment year 1999-2000, since the earlier

appellate order was already available, the Assessing Officer considered
the matter on merits and by an order dated 28th December, 2001 he

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 6 of 23

granted a refund of Rs.86,73,349/- to the Petitioner.

12.

The situation, therefore, was that in respect of all the three

assessment years that we are concerned with, the claim of the Petitioner
for allowing trade discount in respect of the sales made to its
distributors and dealers was allowed by the Assessing Officer.

13.

On this basis, the Petitioner filed refund claims on different

dates in respect of all the three assessment years with the Assessing
Officer under Section 30 of the DST Act.

14.

Unfortunately, instead of granting the refund claimed by the

Petitioner in terms of the orders passed by the Assessing Officer, the
Petitioner was issued a show cause notice on 14 th June, 2004 under
Section 24 of the DST Act for reopening its assessment for all the three
assessment years. The Petitioner contested the notice but in respect of
the assessment year 1999-2000 (where the refund amount was quite
considerable), an order was passed on 16 th July, 2004 denying the
benefit of trade discount to the Petitioner and, therefore, denying the
refund claim.

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 7 of 23

15.

Feeling aggrieved, the Petitioner filed two writ petitions in

this Court being Writ Petition (Civil) No.15217 of 2004 and Writ
Petition (Civil) No.15285 of 2004. In these writ petitions, the Petitioner
challenged the notices seeking to reopen the completed assessments and
also the reassessment order dated 16 th July, 2004 passed in respect of the
assessment year 1999-2000.

16.

When both these writ petitions came up for hearing on 22nd

September, 2006, learned counsel for the Revenue informed this Court
that the Commissioner of Sales Tax had taken a decision to withdraw
the reassessment order for the year 1999-2000 as well as the show cause
notices for the assessment years 1997-98 and 1998-99.

17.

Noting this, the following order was passed by this Court on

22nd September, 2006:“Learned counsel for the Revenue states that an instruction
has been sought from Shri Subhash Chander, Sales Tax
Officer that the Commissioner of Sales Tax had taken a
decision to withdraw the reassessment for the year 19992000 and show cause notices for the year 1997-98 and
1989-99.

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 8 of 23

The only question that now remain pertains to refund. The
final decision has to be taken under Rule 29 of the Delhi
Sales Tax Rules, 1975. The Assistant Commissioner has
observed that since the refund amount is substantial, a
verification of the records to examine whether refund is
rightly due to the dealer, should be made.
In the circumstances of the case, we direct the Assistant
Commissioner to pass a reasoned order on the application
for refund within 4 weeks from today.
With these observations, the Writ Petition is disposed of.
Order be given dasti to both the parties.”

18.

It may be mentioned that in the meanwhile, the VAT Act

came to be enacted and was brought into force with effect from 1 st April,
2005.

19.

Significantly, the VAT Act did not provide for any power of

revision such as the one which existed under the repealed DST Act.
This is of considerable importance as will be apparent a little later.

20.

In any event, after the order dated 22nd September, 2006

passed by this Court, the assessment orders became final since the show
cause notices were withdrawn and the chapter of “reassessment” was
closed and the reassessment order was also withdrawn. What, therefore,
WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 9 of 23

remained to be considered was the entitlement of the Petitioner for a
refund. At this stage, it may be noted that a refund claim can only be
rejected under certain conditions mentioned in Section 30 of the DST
Act.

21.

Be that as it may, since the order passed by this Court on 22 nd

September, 2006 gave the Assistant Commissioner four weeks time to
pass a reasoned order on the application for refund moved by the
Petitioner in respect of all the three assessment years that we are
concerned with, he issued a notice on 18 th October, 2006 asking the
Petitioner to show cause why the refund applications be not rejected.
This was virtually on the last day of the expiry of the period of four
weeks.

22.

Almost immediately thereafter on 20th October, 2006 the

concerned Joint Commissioner rejected all the three refund applications
filed by the Petitioner in respect of the three assessment years. On the
same day, the Joint Commissioner issued notices to the Petitioner to
show cause why the assessment orders passed in its favour (on the basis
of which the claims for refund were made) be not revised suo motu. The

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 10 of 23

notices for suo motu revision of the assessment orders for the
assessment years 1997-98 to 1999-2000 were issued by the Joint
Commissioner of Sales Tax under Section 46 of the repealed DST Act.

23.

Pursuant to the show cause notice dated 20 th October, 2006,

the Joint Commissioner passed an order on 7 th November, 2006 suo
motu revising the assessment orders passed in favour of the Petitioner
for the three assessment years that we are concerned with and then
remanded the matter to the Assessing Officer for a fresh assessment. It
is against this order dated 7th November, 2006 that the Petitioner has
filed Writ Petition (Civil) No.17423 of 2006.

24.

As we have already mentioned above, the DST Act was

repealed and the VAT Act was brought into force with effect from 1 st
April, 2005. The VAT Act had no provision for suo motu exercise of
revisionary power by the Commissioner.

The power to revise an

assessment order was conferred upon the Commissioner for the first
time by an amendment to the VAT Act which incorporated Section 74A
therein with effect from 16th November, 2005.

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 11 of 23

25.

One of the questions canvassed before us was whether the

Commissioner or his delegate (the Joint Commissioner) could exercise
powers under Section 46 of the DST Act which had been repealed by
the VAT Act. In continuation of this, another question canvassed before
us was that in the absence of an appropriate savings clause, coupled
with the fact that the revisionary power was deliberately not conferred
upon the Commissioner under the VAT Act, could the Commissioner
exercise powers conferred by Section 46 of the repealed DST Act.
26.

This very issue had arisen before us in Writ Petition (Civil)

No.5828 of 2007 (M/s International Metro Civil Contractors v.
Commissioner of Sales Tax/VAT, Delhi & Anr.) decided on 14th
March, 2008 and we had expressed the opinion that after 1st April,
2005, the Commissioner of Sales Tax had no power to revise an order
passed under Section 46 of the repealed DST Act, since such a power
was deliberately not conferred upon him.

The repeal and savings

section (Section 106) of the VAT Act did not save the power under
Section 46 of the DST Act.

27.

We were told by learned counsel for the Revenue that the

decision rendered by us in M/s International Metro Civil Contractors

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 12 of 23

was the subject matter of a Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil)
No.7470 of 2008 (Commissioner, Value Added Tax, New Delhi & Anr.
v. M/s International Metro Civil Contractor) and by an order dated 31 st
March, 2008 passed by the Supreme Court, it was made clear that the
larger issue regarding the applicability of the VAT Act as also the
question of repeal of the DST Act and related issues discussed in our
judgment were kept open. This is what the Supreme Court said:
“Having regard to the facts of the present case we are of the
view that the Commissioner ought not to have interfered with
the Assessment Order under Sec.46 of the Delhi Sales Tax
Act particularly when the requirements of that Section do not
stand complied with. We make it clear that the larger issue
regarding the applicability of Delhi Value Added Tax Act
2004 as also question of repeal of Delhi Sales Tax Act and
related issues discussed in the impugned judgment of the
High Court are kept open.
As far as the cost is concerned we are of the view that in the
facts and circumstances of the case it would not be proper to
impose the cost of rupees twenty six lakhs on the
Department. Ultimately it is the tax payer who has to bear
the burden. The order passed by the High Court as far as
cost is concerned stands cancelled.
The special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.”

28.

Consequently, the view expressed by us in M/s International

Metro Civil Contractors has not been upset by the Supreme Court and,
therefore, following the decision rendered by us, for which neither
WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 13 of 23

learned counsel has given us reason to depart from, we conclude that the
Commissioner (and, therefore, his delegate the Joint Commissioner) had
no power under Section 46 of the repealed DST Act to revise an
assessment order. Section 106 of the VAT Act dealing with repeal and
savings does not come to the rescue of the Revenue as we have held in
that decision.

29.

On this short ground itself, Writ Petition (Civil) No.17423 of

2006 is allowed and the impugned Order No.449 dated 7th November,
2006 is quashed.

30.

To complete the record, we may note that learned counsel for

the Petitioner contended that the exercise of power to suo motu revise
the assessment orders was mala fide and a clear attempt to overturn the
earlier decision of the Commissioner to withdraw reassessment
proceedings. It was also said to be a blatant attempt to overreach this
Court which was already seized of the issue regarding the correctness of
the procedure adopted by the Revenue and which made it clear in its
order of 22nd September, 2006 that the only question that remained was
of granting a refund to the Petitioner. We are not going into these issues

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 14 of 23

because it is not necessary to do so particularly since we have held that
the exercise of power by the Commissioner was without jurisdiction.

31.

The next question that arises for consideration is whether the

claim for refund was rightly rejected. This is the subject matter of Writ
Petition (Civil) No. 17391 of 2006. Our answer to this question is in the
negative and there are two reasons for it.

32.

Firstly, since the suo motu revision of the assessment orders

has been held to be bad in law, the natural consequence is that the
assessment orders sought to be revised must be held to have been
validly passed. That being so, there is no impediment in accepting, in
principle, the claim for refund subject to any legal obstacle. Is there any
legal obstacle?

33.

The claim for refund was made by the Petitioner under

Section 30 of the DST Act. Ordinarily, the claim must be allowed in
view of the provisions of Section 30 (1) of the DST Act, but it may be
rejected only on the grounds mentioned in Section 30 (3) and Section 30
(6) of the DST Act. These provisions read as follows: -

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 15 of 23

“30. Refund. – (1) If any person satisfies the Commissioner
that the amount of tax paid by him or on his behalf for any
year exceeds the amount payable by him under this Act for
that year, he shall, on making a claim in the prescribed form
and verified in the prescribed manner, be entitled to refund
of the excess either by cash payment or at his option by
deduction of such excess from the amount of tax and
penalty (if any) due in respect of any other period:
Provided that the Commissioner shall first apply such
excess towards the recovery of any amount in respect of
which a notice under Section 25 has been issued and shall
then refund the balance, if any.
Explanation. – When no assessment is made, the due tax
paid under section 21 by the dealer shall be deemed to be
the tax payable under this Act.
(2)

(3)
No claim for refund under sub-section (1) shall be
allowed unless it is made within a period of twelve months
from the date of the order giving rise to a claim for such
refund and the Commissioner shall, except as otherwise
provided in this Act, refund any amount which becomes
due to a dealer in the prescribed manner:
Provided that the Commissioner may allow a claim for
refund to be made after the expiry of the said period but not
later than twelve months from such expiry, if he is satisfied
that there was sufficient cause for not making such claim
within that period.
(4) & (5)

xxx

xxx

xxx

(6)
Where an order giving rise to a refund is the
subject-matter of an appeal or further proceeding or where
any other proceeding under this Act is pending and the
Commissioner is of opinion that the grant of the refund is
likely to adversely affect the revenue, the Commissioner
WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 16 of 23

may withhold the refund till such time as the Commissioner
may determine.”

34.

It is nobody’s case that any of the conditions specified in

Section 30(3) or Section 30(6) of the DST Act exist so as to deny the
claim for refund. As far as Section 30(3) of the DST Act is concerned,
there is no doubt that the claim for refund was made within a period of
twelve months from the date of the order giving rise to the claim. As far
as Section 30(6) of the DST Act is concerned, the revisionary
proceedings suo motu initiated by the Commissioner having been
quashed by us today, no proceeding in respect of the subject matter of
the claim for refund is pending. The assessment order on the basis of
which the refund claim was made is not the subject matter of any appeal
or any other proceeding.

Consequently, the refund claim must be

allowed in favour of the Petitioner since no legal bar exists.

35.

We may also note that what the Revenue is effectively

attempting to do is to reopen a closed assessment while considering the
application for refund. Clearly, this is not permissible. On the facts of
the present case, this is all the more so because the Revenue had earlier
tried to reopen the completed assessment but when that was challenged
WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 17 of 23

by the Petitioner by filing a writ petition in this Court, the Revenue
decided to withdraw the show cause notices issued to the Petitioner for
reassessment.

To make matters worse for the Revenue, even the

reassessment order that had been passed for the assessment year 19992000 was withdrawn by the Revenue. It is, therefore, quite clear that the
Revenue is trying to do collaterally and in a roundabout manner is what
it could not succeed in doing on an earlier occasion. In the garb of
examining the claim for refund, which can be rejected only under the
conditions specified in Section 30 of the DST Act, the Revenue is
wanting to reopen and reassess all the completed assessments which, in
our opinion, is certainly not permissible.

36.

However, it is necessary to recall that when this Court

disposed of the earlier two writ petitions filed by the Petitioner on 22 nd
September, 2006, a submission was made by the Revenue that since the
refund amount is substantial it is necessary to verify the records of the
Petitioner to decide whether a refund should be made or not. Liberty as
prayed for was implicitly granted by this Court because a direction was
given to the Revenue to pass a reasoned order on the application for
refund within four weeks. Therefore, it would be correct on the part of

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 18 of 23

the Revenue to contend that they were entitled to take a fresh look at the
applications for refund in view of the earlier order passed by this Court.
This has in fact been done but we find that notwithstanding this there
was no occasion, in law, for the Revenue to have rejected the refund
claims since the conditions mentioned in Section 30 of the DST Act
were not applicable.

37.

Having said this, we may note that it is mentioned in the

order rejecting the claim for refund that the claim is rejected by applying
the principles of unjust enrichment. In this regard, reliance is placed
upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. &
others v. Union of India & others, (1997) 5 SCC 536. It appears to us
that the decision rendered by the Supreme Court is not quite applicable.
It is mentioned in the majority judgment written by Justice B.P. Jeevan
Reddy (with whom Chief Justice Ahmadi agreed) in the opening
paragraph that a significant question concerning the refund of excise
and customs duties collected contrary to law arises for consideration.
The question arose as a result of certain amendments made to the
Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 and the Customs Act, 1962. The
decision of the Supreme Court, therefore, did not concern itself with the

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 19 of 23

question of unjust enrichment in respect of other statutes. Therefore,
Mafatlal Industries would not help the Revenue in this case.

38.

Learned counsel for the Revenue, however, relied upon an

unreported decision of this Court in M/s Mafat Lal Dyes and Chemicals
Ltd. v. Sales Tax Officer, Writ Petition (C) No.3716/1992 decided on
29th September, 2005. In that case, a Division Bench of this Court
relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court being Entry Tax Officer,
Bangalore v. Chandanmal Champalal & Co., [1994] 95 STC 5 in
which the Supreme Court applied the principle of unjust enrichment and
denied a claim for refund. While referring to that decision as well as
Mafatlal Industries, the Division Bench declined to grant refund of
sales tax on the ground that the tax was in fact collected by the assessee
therein which was then passed on to the customers. It was held that a
direction for refund of the sales tax passed on would amount to unjustly
enriching the assessee therein.

39.

In our opinion, the decision rendered by a Division Bench of

this Court would be applicable to the facts of this case. In view of the
Division Bench decision, the principle of unjust enrichment would apply

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 20 of 23

to a case such as the present which pertains to a refund of sales tax.

40.

However, what needs to be determined is whether the

Petitioner had passed on the benefit of the trade discount to its dealers
and distributors. We feel handicapped in making such a determination
on the existing paperbook because the facts of the case in this regard are
not at all clear.

41.

In the impugned order rejecting the claim for refund, the

Joint Commissioner has been critical of the credit notes and the manner
in which they have been prepared and kept by the Petitioner but
unfortunately he does not deal with the question whether the benefit of
the trade discount was passed on by the Petitioner to its dealers and
distributors. On the basis of his conclusion that the credit notes were
not kept in a proper manner, the Joint Commissioner has presumed that
the burden of sales tax was passed on by the Petitioner to its dealers and
distributors who in turn have passed it on to the ultimate consumers.
We are of the opinion that this is a rather unsatisfactory way of dealing
with the factual position but we do agree that in case the Petitioner has
passed on the sales tax burden despite giving a trade discount, it would

WP (C) No.17423/2006

Page 21 of 23

not be entitled to a refund to that extent on the principles of unjust
enrichment.

42.

Consequently, we are of the opinion that since the facts in

this regard at not at all clear, it will be appropriate if the matter is
dispassionately re-examined by the Joint Commissioner limited only to
the question whether the Petitioner has passed on the tax burden to its
dealers and distributors or not. If it is found that the Petitioner has
passed on the tax burden, then on the principles of unjust enrichment the
Petitioner will not be entitled to a refund for that amount. But if it has
not passed on the tax burden then, of course, the Petitioner will be
entitled to a refund. To this extent, while we quash the Order No.437
dated 20th October, 2006 we direct the Joint Commissioner to take a
decision within six weeks from today limited to the question whether,
despite the trade discounts given by the Petitioner, it has passed on the
tax burden to its dealers and distributors or not.

Of course, the

Petitioner will be entitled to produce all its documents to show that the
tax burden has not been passed on to the dealers and distributors.
