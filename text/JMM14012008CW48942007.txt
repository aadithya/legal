1.
The petitioner in this petition was enrolled in the Indian
Army as a Sepoy – Sapper on 24.05.1980. He was promoted as
Naik while working in that capacity. He had committed an offence

WP(C) No.4894/2007

Page 1 of 7

of “absent without leave” for six days and was given 'severe
reprimand' on 10.10.1985. The petitioner, however, got further
promotions from time to time and in the year 2004 he was
working as Naib Subedar. The case of the petitioner for extension
was considered and vide letter dated 30.04.2004 screening board
granted extension of two years of service from 23.05.2006 to
23.05.2008. However, before that the respondent amended the
aforesaid policy vide circular dated 22.11.2005 and clarified
therein that even in those cases where the official was convicted
or given red entry in a lower rank than JCO, same would act as bar
and the official would not be entitled to extension. In view of this
policy the order dated 30.04.2004 passed in case of the petitioner
which was to take effect on 24.05.2006 was revoked vide orders
dated 19.04.2006.

Challenging this order petitioner filed writ

petition 9263/2006 inter alia submitting that this policy could not
have been given retrospective effect. The writ petition came up
for hearing along with other connected petition raising same issue
and came to be dismissed by the Division Bench of this court vide
judgment dated 31.05.2007 whereby the aforesaid policy dated
22.11.2005 was upheld. Before that the petitioner's filed a writ
petition. In the said writ petition petitioner was granted stay of

revocation

order

dated

19.04.2006

and

therefore

he

continued in service even after 24.05.2006 on a strength of
earlier extension granted to him vide orders dated 30.04.2004.
However, any action could be taken on the basis of this judgment,
the respondents once again revised their policy after reviewing
the same vide communication circular dated 13.06.2007.
2.

The respondents have the policy for giving such extensions

which is contained in policy letter no. B/33098/AG/PS 2(C) dt.
21.09.1998 which has been amended from time to time. In the
policy letter dated 21.09.1998 as it originally stood, procedure
and criteria for screening of the officers in the Army for extension
is laid down. It enumerates certain offences and stipulates that if
an officer is convicted of any of those offences then he would be
debarred from extension. The respondents themselves clarified
their policy dated 21.09.1998 by issuing letter dated 13.06.2007.
The relevant paras of this letter read as under :“2. As per the existing policy, a JCO who has been
convicted any time during his entire service for an
offence under AA Sec 39(a), (b) and AA Sec 45 is
permanently debarred for two years extn of service.
The same was clarified vide letter of even No dated 22 nd
Nov 2005. The aspect has been reviewed and details
are explained in succeeding paragraphs.
3.
As per the revised policy, JCOs who are convicted
under these offences during service as JCOs only will be
WP(C) No.4894/2007

Page 3 of 7

debarred for extn. Thus any conviction in the lower
rank under the above mentioned offences will not debar
an extn in the rank of the JCO provided other requisite
criteria are met. In view of this change note under Ser
No 8 (a), (b) and Ser No. 14 of Annexure to Appendix 'A'
of the letter dt. 21 Sep 98 is amended as under :For : Ser 8 (a) Sec 39 (a) - Absence without
(for JCOs only)

leave

Ser 8(b)

Sec 39 (b) - Overstayal of leave (for
JCOs only)

Ser 14

Sec 45 -

Unbecoming conduct (for
JCOs only)

Read: Ser 8(a) Sec 39 (a) - Absence without leave
(offence
committed
during service at JCO)
Ser 8(b) Sec 39 (b) - Overstayal
of
leave
(offence
committed
during service at JCO)
Ser 14

3.

Sec 45 -

Unbecoming
conduct
(offence
committed
during service at JCO)

4.
The revised policy will be effective from the date
of issue of this letter. It is also clarified that no past
cases will be reopened.
You are requested to
disseminate the revised policy down to the unit level.”
As far as petitioner is concerned he was issued letter dated

21.06.2007, on the basis of judgment dated 31.05.2007 to hand
over the charge by 28.06.2007 and complete other formalities by
09.07.2007 for further submission to record offence. It is clear
that even after the judgment of 31.05.2007, the petitioner was
not discharged from service and was continuing in service when
WP(C) No.4894/2007

Page 4 of 7

circular dated 13.06.2007 reviewing the policy was issued and as
per which punishment imposed in a lower rank and not as JCO
was not to be considered or as a bar for granting extension. This
according to the petitioner has revised fresh life into his case, as
in his case he was given red entry / severe reprimand on
10.10.1985 as a Naik, it is not to be taken into consideration.
4.

Once this is the objective of the clarification given and the

provision is of beneficial nature interpretation to para no. 4 would
relate to only those cases where the discharge order has already
come into the effect and the official is eased out from the service.
It would not apply to cases where the discharge order is merely
passed which is to take effect from a future date and that date
happens to be after 13.06.2007.

It is a matter of common

knowledge that such discharge orders are generally passed in
advance so that the necessary formalities for computation of
pension and other retirement benefits are completed in time and
the incumbent is given those benefits on the date of retirement
that would not mean that the discharge order became effective
on the date when it was issued.
5.

We have to consider as to whether the petitioner's case falls

into category of 'past cases'. No doubt it by quick of fate that
WP(C) No.4894/2007

Page 5 of 7

petitioner has continued in service in as much as. Had it case
been considered in terms of policy dated 22.11.2005, which has
been upheld by this court, the petitioner would have deemed to
be in service on 24.05.2007. Fact remains that in terms of earlier
policy dated 21.09.1998 when there was no such clarification like
circular dated 22.11.2005, petitioner was granted extension vide
orders dated 30.04.2004 and he could get the advantage of these
orders in the aforesaid writ petition by virtue of the stay orders
granted by this court.

A reading of circular dated 22.11.2005

makes it clear that the respondents at that time took the view
that even if red entry has taken place in the rank of JCO or other
rank, the same has to act as a bar for further extension.
However, respondents realise this harshness of such a provision
themselves

and

therefore

soon

thereafter

issue

another

clarification circular dated 13.06.2007 after reviewing the position
and making it more humane which appeals to reason as well.
When entire matter is viewed from this angle and the petitioner
was still in service and is granted benefit of extension from
24.05.2006 to 23.05.2008, we are of the opinion that he should
be allowed to complete his tenure and it should not be snatched
in the middle.

More particularly when the respondents have

WP(C) No.4894/2007

Page 6 of 7

themselves taken the view that such a glut of red entry in other
rank is not to come in the way of grant of extension.

We

therefore allow this writ petition and make the review absolute
and direct the respondents to allow the petitioner to continue in
service till 23.05.2008.
6.

The petitioner is due for promotion as Subedar w.e.f.

February 2007.

The case of the petitioner shall accordingly be

considered appropriately within a period of two months in
accordance with rules.

Needless to mention if petitioner earns

this promotion his case for further extension shall also be
considered accordingly.
