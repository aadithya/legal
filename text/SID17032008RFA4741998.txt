This appeal arises out of an order dated 3rd February,
1998 passed by the Reference Court in LAC No. 233/1982
whereby the said Court has while enhancing the amount of
compensation payable to the respondent - land owners directed
payment of interest under Section 4(3) of the Land Acquisition
(Amendment and validation) Act, 1967 @ 6% per annum w.e.f.
24th October, 1964, subject to the condition that there is no

RFA No. 474/1998

Page No.1 of 8

overlapping in the payment of the said interest with other
interest payable under the provisions of the Land Acquisition
Act. The Court has also directed that interest for the period 19th
January,

1984

to

7th

February,

1995

during

which

the

proceedings were adjourned sine die by the Reference Court at
the request of the land owners shall not be payable to them
under Section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act. While RFA No.
474/1998 challenges the order passed by the Reference Court to
the extent interest under Section 4(3) of the Land Acquisition
(Amendment and validation) Act, 1967 has been awarded, cross
objections No. 782/2002 filed by the respondent - land owners
challenge the order passed by the Reference Court to the extent
the same has denied interest to them for the period between
19th January, 1984 to 7th February, 1995.
Appearing for the appellant Mr. Poddar, drew our
attention to an order passed by the Supreme Court in Delhi
Colonizers vs. Union of India, Civil Appeal No. 4668/1998
disposed of on 5th December, 2001 to urge that the legal
position regarding award of interest under Section 4(3) of the

RFA No. 474/1998

Page No.2 of 8

Land Acquisition (Amendment and validation) Act, 1967 stands
settled by the said decision.

That too was a case where the

High Court had held the land owners entitled to interest under
Section

4(3)

of

the

Land

Acquisition

(Amendment

and

validation) Act, 1967, provided there was no overlapping of
interest awarded under Section 28 of the Act.

The Supreme

Court, declared the said view to be incorrect, in the light of an
earlier decision rendered by their lordships in Mamleshwar
Prasad (d) by Lrs. & Another vs. Union of India and Others
decided on 24th August, 1995.

The Court declared that the

claimants are entitled to interest under Section 4(3) of the Land
Acquisition (Amendment and validation) Act, 1967, in addition
to other interest payable under the provisions of the Land
Acquisition Act. The Court observed as under:“The appellants also claimed interest under
Section 4(3) of the Land Acquisition (Amendment &
Validation) Act, 1967. The High Court was of the
view that the appellants are entitled to interest
under Section4 (3) of the Land Acquisition
(Amendment & Validation) Act, 1967, but the same
shall be granted provided there is no overlapping of
interest awarded under Section2 8 of the Act. This
view of the High Court is not correct.
In
Mamleshwar Prasad (D) by Lrs. & Anr. vs.

RFA No. 474/1998

Page No.3 of 8

Union of India & Ors. decided on August 24, 1995
(Civil Appeal arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.
10567/1985), it was held that the claimants are
entitled to interest under Section 4(3) of the Land
Acquisition (Amendment and validation) Act, 1967,
in addition to other interest which is payable under
the provisions of the Act.
Following the said
decision, we direct that the appellants shall be
entitled to interest under sub-section (3) of Section
4 of the Land Acquisition
(Amendment and
validation) Act, 1967 from the date on which the
three-year period from the date of Section 4
notification expired upto the date of tender or
payment of compensation awarded by the Collector
for the acquisition of their land, even if any interest
is paid to the appellants under any other provisions
of the Act.”
In the light of the above authoritative pronouncement we
have no hesitation in holding that the respondent – land owners
shall be entitled to simple interest @ 6% per annum under
Section

4(3)

of

the

Land

Acquisition

(Amendment

and

validation) Act, 1967 commencing from the date of expiry of
three years period to be reckoned from the date of issue of the
Section 4 of the notification till the date of the tender or
payment of the compensation awarded by the Land Acquisition
Collector.
That leaves us with the only other question, namely,

RFA No. 474/1998

Page No.4 of 8

whether the Reference Court was justified in declining interest
to the respondent-land owners for the period during which the
proceedings

in

the

reference

had

remained

suspended/adjourned sine die. The reference Court has taken
the view that since the proceedings were adjourned at the
request of the land owners on a specific statement made on
their behalf that they would not claim any interest during the
period of stay, there was no question of awarding interest to
them for that period. The legal position even in regard to the
waiver of interest under Section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act
by

the land

owners in

the

above circumstances stands

concluded by an authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme
Court in Union of India vs. Pramod Gupta (2005) 12 SCC 1.
The Court in that case reviewed the legal position by reference
to the decisions by their Lordships earlier and observed as
under:“111. It is, therefore, not correct to contend that
there cannot be any waiver of the right to claim
interest. Statutory provisions are made for payment
of interest with a view to compensate a party which
had suffered damages owing to a positive action or
inaction of the other resulting in blockade of money

RFA No. 474/1998

Page No.5 of 8

which he would otherwise have received. A party
which itself represents before the court of law that
it would not claim interest with a view to obtain an
order of stay which would be for its own benefit, in
our opinion, could not be permitted to take
advantage of its own wrong. (See Sushil Kumar v.
Rakesh Kumar: (2003) 8 SCC 673 and Laxminarayan
R. Bhattad v. State of Maharashtra: (2003) 5 SCC
413).
112. Even otherwise it is now well settled that a
person cannot be made to suffer owing to an action
by the court (actus curiae neminem gravabit). (See
Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi: (2003) 8 SCC
319 and Board of Control for Cricket in India v.
Netaji Cricket Club: (2005 4 SCC 741.)
113. We, therefore, are of the view that the High
Court committed a manifest error in allowing
interest for the said period. In fact, Mr.
Ramamoorthy, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for the respondents frankly conceded that interest
for the said period shall not be payable.”

It is in the light of the above pronouncement, no longer
open to the land owners to contend that the right to claim
interest under Section 28 of the Act could not be waived. That
such waiver had indeed taken place in the instant case cannot
be disputed by the owners. We say so because the adjournment
of the proceedings had taken place at the instance of the land
owners and on a specific statement made by them to the effect

RFA No. 474/1998

Page No.6 of 8

that they would not claim any interest during the period the
proceedings remain suspended.

In that view, therefore, the

Reference Court was justified in holding that the interest for the
period mentioned above was not due and recoverable from the
land owners.
Learned counsel for the land owners all the same argued
that the land owners would be entitled to claim interest on the
amount of solatium for the period excluding the period between
19th January, 1984 to 7th February, 1995. Mr. Poddar did not
dispute that position and submitted that although the interest
for the period mentioned above is not payable, the owners
would be entitled to recover such interest for the rest of the
period in terms of decision of the Supreme Court in Sunder vs.
Union of India 93 DLT (2001) 579.
In the result the order passed by the Reference Court shall
stand modified to the extent that the land owners shall be
entitled to interest under Section 4(3) of the Land Acquisition
(Amendment and validation) Act, 1967 from the date the period
of three years expired reckoned from the date of issue of the

RFA No. 474/1998

Page No.7 of 8

preliminary notification till the date of tender/payment of
compensation awarded by the Collector.
Cross objections filed by the respondent–land owners,
however, fail and are dismissed. No costs.
