JUDGMENT
03.03.2008
DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ. (ORAL)

FAO(OS) 512/2007 and 516/2007

1.

Both the appeals are being disposed of by this common judgment and

order as they are between the same parties.
2.

This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 06.07.2007

passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing the application filed by the
appellants praying for setting aside the ex parte decree.

The aforesaid

application being IA No.7157/07 was filed by the appellants herein in the suit,
being CS(OS) No.2318/1990 filed by the respondent Corporation seeking for a
decree of recovery of about Rs.46 lakhs along with interest both pendentelite
and future.
3.

In order to counterblast the aforesaid suit filed by the respondent, the

appellants filed a cross-suit against the respondent seeking for a decree of
recovery of about Rs.26,68,561/-, which was registered as CS(OS)
No.2300/1991. The suit filed by the respondent was instituted in 1990 and the
cross-suit filed by the appellant was instituted in 1991 and they were being
taken up together. As stated by the counsel appearing for the appellants, the
suit filed by the appellants came to be dismissed for non-prosecution and in
default by an order dated 13.09.2004. Despite the said fact, no application was
filed seeking for restoration of the said suit. The trial in the other suit, being
CS(OS) No.2318/1990, however, is continuing, but the appellant failed to
appear in the said suit also, consequent upon which, an order was passed for
proceeding in the suit ex parte as against the defendants No.1 and 2. The said
FAO(OS) 512/2007 and 516/2007

Page 2 of 5

order was passed on 14.12.2005. Subsequent thereto, an ex parte decree came
to be passed in the said suit on 17.03.2006. After the aforesaid ex parte decree
was passed in the suit filed by the respondent, an application seeking for setting
aside the ex parte decree was filed on 17.04.2007 contending, inter alia, that the
appellant was ill and was unwell and, therefore, he was not in a position to
pursue the matter diligently.
4.

The aforesaid contention of the appellant was considered by the learned

Single Judge. The learned Single Judge has appreciated the averments made in
the application and found the ground stated therein for non-appearance to be
vague.

In the said application, the only statement that was made by the

appellants is that despite due diligence, both the defendants No.1 and 2 could
not put in appearance.

However, the documents filed in support of the

contention in the said application were in the nature of some medical records.
The said medical records which are filed by the appellants in support of the
averments made in the application are of the period prior to the year 1992. The
suit was directed to be proceeded ex parte by an order dated 14.12.2005
whereas the suit filed by the appellants was dismissed for non-prosecution on
13.09.2004. There is only one medical certificate after the year 1992, which is
of the year December, 1999 to the effect that Mr. Vijay Kumar Bhatia has
angina problem. Persons with such problems are also prosecuting their cases
effectively in Courts and, therefore, the learned Single Judge did not find
FAO(OS) 512/2007 and 516/2007

Page 3 of 5

sufficient cause either to recall the order dated 13.09.2004 or to set aside the ex
parte decree passed in the suit.
5.

The grounds given are assailed before us by the counsel appearing for

the appellants very vehemently contending, inter alia, that if the appellant was
unwell, in that event the learned Single Judge should have set aside the ex parte
decree and also should have recalled the order dated 13.09.2004 dismissing the
suit filed by the appellants for non-prosecution and given opportunity to the
appellants to proceed with both the suits.
6.

We are, however, unable to accept the aforesaid contention of the

counsel appearing for the appellants for the simple reason that it appears the suit
was coming up to a close as it was at the stage of recording of evidence. The
appellant, at least in the suit filed by the respondent, should not have defaulted
in making appearance and thereby allowed the suit to be proceeded ex parte.
Even thereafter, no steps were taken by him to get the said order vacated. The
record shows that after the suit was directed to be proceeded ex parte and the
same proceeded accordingly, and an ex parte decree was passed after about a
year of the said date, for the first time an application was filed for setting aside
the decree.

That also on the ground of medical reasons, which is again

unsupported by the documents on records for the relevant period during which
the aforesaid default was committed by the appellants.

There are some further documents sought to be placed on record which

we are not inclined to look into at this stage. They were not placed before the
learned Single Judge, and appear to have been placed on our record as an after
thought. Since those were not placed before the learned Single Judge, we are
not inclined to look at the said documents.
8.

We find no merit in the appeals and both the appeals are accordingly

dismissed. CM Nos.17659/2007 and 17693/2007 also stand disposed of
accordingly.
