FIR

No.625/2003

dated

22.12.2003 under Section 302/34 IPC has been registered on the
statement of Smt. Sudha Rani, wife of Ramji Lal. She stated that
her husband was an active worker of Bhartiya Janta Party and at a
function held on 10.12.2003 Harinder, Jasbir (Jashvir), Banwari,
Suresh Pehalwan and Manish were present.

That on said day at

the asking of Harinder, Jashvir, Banwari and Suresh Pehelwan
Manish gave beating to her husband.

That at 11:00 PM on

22.10.2003 she along with her husband, son Vikrant and daughter
Devyani were coming down from their house when Harinder,
Jashvir, Banwari, Suresh Pehelwan and Manish came from Central
Market side near their house. One of them fired at her husband.
That her husband was hit on the chest.

After shooting her

husband all accused persons left the site.
4.

Ramji Lal was taken to the hospital by a PCR van. He

was declared brought dead.
5.

In their statements recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C.,

Vikrant and Devyani made statements identical to the statements
made by their mother.

After a few days 2 purported eyewitnesses surfaced.

They were Suresh Kumar and Raj Kumar.

stated that Manish and Neeraj came to the house of the deceased
on a motor cycle and fired a shot at him from a pistol.

is simple.

Argument of learned senior counsel for the petitioners
There cannot be 2 versions of the same incident.

Counsels argue that either as per statement made by the wife of

the deceased the attackers came in a car and one out of them
shot the deceased or the version could be that Manish and Neeraj
came to the spot on a motor cycle and Manish fired the shot at
the deceased.
11.

Whereas learned counsel for Neeraj relied upon the

statements of the widow and children of the deceased to urge
that there was no basis to summon him as an accused, learned
counsel for Jasbeer and others relied upon subsequent statements
made by Suresh Kumar and Raj Kumar to urge that his clients
could not be summoned to face trial as accused persons.
12.

The summoning order being allowed to stand would

result in the obvious. The case of the prosecution would collapse
like nine pins.
13.

In my opinion the summoning order to all accused

persons needs to be quashed at this stage but simultaneously
directions need to be issued for further investigation to be carried
out.
14.

Needless to state, under Sections 173(8) of the Code

of Criminal Procedure, 1973 further investigations can be
directed.
15.

Matter needs a thorough probe.

Who is the truthful

witness of the prosecution needs to be sorted out. In my opinion

further investigation needs to be entrusted to the Crime Branch of
Delhi Police. Further, the investigation needs to be carried out by
an officer not below the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police.
16.

Both

petitions

of

quashing

the

summoning order passed by the learned Trial Judge summoning
the petitioners to face trial in the above captioned FIR. Directions
are issued to the Commissioner, Police to transfer above noted FIR
to the Crime Branch of Delhi Police. Further directions are issued
that further investigations would be conducted by an officer not
below the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police. The
supplementary report would be submitted to the learned Trial
Judge who would thereupon pass fresh orders as per the
supplementary report and as required by law.
17.

LCR be returned.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned counsel

for parties.
