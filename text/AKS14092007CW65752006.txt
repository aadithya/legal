A.K. SIKRI, J.
:
1. Firstly, facts in brief:2. Respondent No.2, M/s. Wings Wear (P) Ltd., was allotted
property bearing No. B II/18, Mohan Co-operative Industrial

WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 1 of 18

Estate, Badarpur, Delhi, by the DDA on leasehold basis.
Such a property cannot be transferred without permission
of the DDA and while according such a permission, the
DDA is entitled to charge 50% of the unearned increase.
Said M/s. Wings Wear (P) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as
the 'judgment debtor') needed certain financial assistance
for which it approached the respondent No.1, Canara Bank
(hereinafter referred to as the 'Bank').

Loans were

sanctioned against which the aforesaid property was
mortgaged with the bank after taking permission of the
DDA.

Since the judgment debtor did not make the

payment, the bank filed the application before the Debt
Recovery Tribunal (in short the 'DRT') for payment of its
dues, which was allowed and vide order dated 21.2.2004,
the judgment debtor was directed to pay the bank a sum
of Rs.55,47,819.91P. along with pendente lite and future
interest at the rate of 21.75% per annum with quarterly
rests as well as costs. The judgment debtor failed to make
the payment and thus, recovery certificate was drawn in
favour of the bank on 30.4.2002.

The Recovery Officer

took up the execution proceedings. In the meantime, the
judgment debtor had gone into liquidation as winding up
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 2 of 18

orders were passed against it by the Company Judge of
this Court and the Official Liquidator was also appointed.
The Recovery Officer initiated the move to sell the
mortgaged property. The reserved price of Rs.77.60 lakhs
was fixed and other terms of sale were settled.

Sale

proclamation was issued on 19.4.2004 fixing the date of
auction

as

28.5.2004.

The

petitioner

herein

also

participated in the said auction and his bid of Rs.78 lakhs
being the highest was accepted and he was declared as
the successful bidder.

This sale was confirmed on

22.7.2004.
3. The petitioner filed application on 1.6.2004 seeking a
direction against the bank to pay the unearned increase
payable to the DDA, the ground rent and the composition
fee.

It may be mentioned that since the mortgaged

property was governed by the terms and covenants
contained in the lease deed dated 18.4.1980 and on the
sale of the property, as mentioned above, 50% unearned
increase was payable to the DDA, the question had arisen
as to who would pay the said unearned increase as well as
the ground rent and the composition fee. The SDM, Model
Town, has also attached this property on account of
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 3 of 18

certain dues payable to the workmen.

The petitioner,

therefore, in the said application dated 1.6.2004 also
prayed for withdrawing of the said attachment.
Recovery

Officer

passed

an

order

dated

The

22.7.2004

confirming the sale but rejecting the other prayers of the
petitioner herein, namely, direction to the bank to pay the
aforesaid amounts.

The petitioner challenged this order

under Section 30 of the Recovery of Debts due to Banks
and Financial Institutions before the DRT.

The DRT

accepted the contention of the petitioner and ordered that
the aforesaid dues shall be paid by the bank from the sale
proceeds. The bank challenged that order by filing appeal
before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (in short the
'DRAT'). The DRAT has passed the impugned order dated
4.4.2006. The case set up by the bank was that since the
property in question was sold on “as is where is basis”, all
the encumbrances with regard to the property had to be
borne by the auction purchaser.
4. The petitioner herein, on the other hand, contended that
he was not informed of any such dues or liabilities and he
could not be made to suffer due to lack of proper and clear
indication in the auction notice issued by the Recovery
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 4 of 18

Officer about the encumbrances on the property.
5. The learned DRAT in these circumstances opined that
neither the petitioner nor the bank could be blamed since
the property was sold on “as is where is basis”, normally
such a liability would be on the petitioner. But as there
was no proper and clear indication in the notice, he could
not be fastened with such a liability. On the other hand,
the bank, which had given substantial loan to the
judgment debtor and was legally entitled to recover more
than Rs.3 crores and, therefore, it was not justifiable to call
upon the bank to part with another Rs.2.90 crores towards
liability on the property in the form of unearned increase,
ground rent and composition fee etc. The learned DRAT,
in these circumstances, though that the appropriate
course was to set aside the sale itself and gave the
following directions:“In this scenario, having regard to
the facts and circumstances of the
case, the only course appears to be
set aside the sale and direct the
Recovery Officer to hold fresh
auction
giving
details
of
encumbrances on the property in the
sale
notification
and
sale
proclamation so as to enable the
willing purchaser to know about the
correct position with regard to the
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 5 of 18

property. The Recovery Officer shall
be entitled to seek such other
information from all concerned. The
petitioner-bank shall also render
necessary
assistance
which
is
required for the auctioning of the
property. Accordingly, the sale held
on 28.05.2004 in favour of the 4th
respondent herein is set aside
paving way for fresh steps to be
taken by the Recovery Officer, as
indicated above.”
6. This order is impugned in the present writ petition filed by
the petitioner under Article 226 of the Constitution. The
submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that
the DRAT exceeded the jurisdiction inasmuch as, the only
prayer in the appeal filed by the bank was to fasten the
liability of payment of the aforesaid dues and the bank's
case was that it was the liability of the petitioner, whereas
the petitioner was contending that it was the bank which
was under obligation to pay the dues.

The DRAT,

therefore, could have only decided this issue and could not
have set aside the sale itself.

His submission was that

once the auction has been confirmed by the DRT, there
was no question of setting aside such a sale by the DRAT,
more so when this was not even the prayer of the
respondent bank in its appeal against the order of the
DRT.

He also referred to the judgment of the Supreme

WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 6 of 18

Court in the case of Allahabad Bank Vs. Canara Bank and
Another, (2000) 4 SCC 406 to contend that the Recovery of
Debts

Due

to

Banks

and

Financial

Institutions

Act

(hereinafter referred to as the 'Recovery of Debts Act') was
a special enactment and even if the Companies Act is also
to be treated as a special Act, the proceedings before the
DRT will have overriding effect and the machinery
provided under the Recovery of Debts Act for recovery of
money due to bank by sale of mortgaged property will
prevail over the winding up proceedings under the
Companies Act.

He referred to the following passages

from the said judgment laying down this principle of law:“50. For the aforesaid reasons, we hold
that at the stage of adjudication under
Section 17 and execution of the certificate
under Section 25 etc., the provisions of the
RDB Act, 1993 confer exclusive jurisdiction
in the Tribunal and the Recovery Officer in
respect of debts payable to Banks and
Financial Institutions and there can be no
interference by the Company Court under
Section 422 read with Section 537 or under
Section 446 of the Companies Act, 1956. In
respect of the monies realised under the
ROB Act, the question of priorities among
the Banks and Financial Institutions and
other creditors can be decided only by the
Tribunal under the RDB Act and in
accordance with Section 19(19) read with
Section 529A of the Companies Act and in
no other manner. The provisions of the RDB
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 7 of 18

Act, 1993 are to the above extent
inconsistent with the provisions of the
Companies Act, 1956 and the latter Act has
to yield to the provisions of the former. This
position holds good during the pendency of
the winding up petition against the debtorcompany and also after a winding up order
is passed. No leave of the Company Court
is necessary for initiating or continuing the
proceedings under the RDB Act, 1993.
Points 2 and 3 are decided accordingly in
favour of the appellant and against the
respondents.
Points 4 and 5:
51. We have already held that the
adjudication,
execution
and
distribution of the sale-proceeds and
working out priorities as between
Banking and Financial Institutions and
other creditors of the defendant
company-so far as the monies realised
under the RDB Act are concerned-has
to be done only by the Tribunal and
not by the Company Court. The next
question is as to the manner of
distribution of these monies between
the Banks or Financial Institutions on
the one hand and the other creditors,
secured or unsecured of the company
under winding up.
This question
depends upon the effect of Section
19(19) of the RDB Act as introduced
by Ordinance 1/2000.”
7. Without prejudice to this contention, he submitted that the
petitioner was still ready to bear the liability of DDA qua
unearned increase and composition charges and was also
ready to pay the ground rent, but not the dues of labour,

WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 8 of 18

which had to be paid out of the sale proceeds by the
Recovery Officer to the bank as well as workers having
regard

to

the

provisions

of

Section

529(a)

of

the

Companies Act.
8. Thus, he submitted that instead of canceling the auction,
the DRAT should have given the petitioner opportunity to
meet the said liability. He further submitted that since in
the auction notice there was no clear stipulation in this
behalf, after ascertaining the liability for which the
petitioner be given right to contest the exact amount
payable as unearned increase etc., choice be given to the
petitioner to decide as to whether the petitioner wants to
purchase this property or not.
9. Notice in this petition was issued to the DDA also to
ascertain the dues payable to it.

DDA has filed the

affidavit computing the dues as per which, the amount
payable as on 2nd November 2006 was Rs.2,19,81,344/-.
This amount is worked out in the following manner:1. Plot No. B-11/18 Mohan Cooperative
Indl Estate
2. Size of plot as per lease deed (P-6/c)
(Market Rate)

1937.02. sq. yds.
1619.58 sq. mtrs.

Total amount A + B = 2,19,81,343.12
say Rs.2,19,81,344.00

10.Learned counsel for the DDA submitted that if updation
charges are calculated till date, the total amount as on
30.9.2007 works out to Rs.2,99,49,621/-.
11.Learned counsel for the bank submitted that the order of
the DRAT was proper and justified inasmuch as, the
property was under-valued and the petitioner's bid of
Rs.78.05 lakhs is much below the market value.

He

pointed out that the dues of the bank with upto date
interest itself works out to approximately Rs.5.4 crores.
Counsel for the workmen informs that dues of the
workmen are approximately Rs.5 crores, which is on the
basis of adjudication by the Labour Court for which
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 10 of 18

recovery certificates have also been issued and the SDM
had attached the property in question much before it was
to be put to auction.
12.We have considered the respective submissions of the
counsel for the parties and have minutely gone through
the impugned order dated 4.4.2006 passed by the DRAT.
The relevant facts have already been noted above. After
the auction, dispute arose as to whether it is the
petitioner, who is to pay the aforesaid dues or the liability
is that of the respondent bank.

We may note that the

Recovery Officer while deciding the applications of the
petitioner herein vide his order dated 22.7.2004 confirmed
the sale also by the same order.
13.The submission of the respondent was that since the
property in question was sold on “as is where is basis”, all
the encumbrances with regard to the property are to be
borne by the auction purchaser and the DRT should not
have fastened the liability on the respondent bank, who
lent the money to M/s. Wings Wear Pvt. Ltd..
14.The submission of the petitioner, on the other hand, was
that he was not aware of any such liability at the time
when the auction took place.
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Taking note of these
Page 11 of 18

contentions the learned Appellate Tribunal found that in
the notice as well as in the sale proclamation, known and
unknown liabilities attached to the said properties were
not disclosed and had that been done, the petitioner or the
respondent bank would not have faced anxious moments.
In these circumstances, the Appellate Tribunal thought
that the proper course of action was to cancel the sale
itself and take fresh steps for auctioning the property. The
exact discussion by the Tribunal runs as follows:“10. In the light of these submissions
on considering various orders I am of the
view that the appellant as well as the 4th
respondent cannot be made to suffer due to
lack of proper and clear indication in the
auction notice issued by the Recovery
Officer about the encumbrance on the
property. It was though indicated in the
auction notification that other details
regarding liabilities is not forthcoming, the
Recovery Officer should have categorically
mentioned in the notice as well as in the
sale proclamation that the property does
not have known and unknown liabilities
which have to be borne by the auction
purchaser. Had that course been taken by
the Recovery Officer, in my considered
view, the appellant and the auction
purchaser perhaps would not have faced
anxious moments. The appellant having
lent a substantial amount to the 1st
respondent-company to set up an industrial
unit and as on the date of sale of the
property the appellant was legally entitled
to recover more than Rs.3 crores, it will not
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 12 of 18

be justifiable to call upon the appellant to
part with another Rs.2.90 crores towards
the liability on the property which was
purchased by the 4th respondent. Nor in the
absence of a clear-cut indication regarding
the liabilities on the property being put to
auction, either in the sale notification or in
the
sale
proclamation,
the
auction
purchaser be asked to make good all the
encumbrances which go along with the
property.
It is also noticed that the
Presiding Officer of the SRT has recorded
that the details of liabilities have not been
indicated in the proclamation of sale issued
by the Recovery Officer. Apart from the
dues of Delhi Development Authority, the
Official Liquidator has also come forward
with a plea that the salaries of the
employees of the 1st respondent-company
are also dues and that these dues are also
to be recovered from the sale proceeds.
11. In this scenario, having regard to the
facts and circumstances of the case, the
only course appears to be set aside the sale
and direct the Recovery Officer to hold fresh
auction giving details of encumbrances of
the property in the sale notification and sale
proclamation so as to enable the willing
purchaser to know about the correct
position with regard to the property. The
Recovery Officer shall be entitled to seek
such other information from all concerned.
The appellant-bank shall also render
necessary assistance which is required for
the auctioning of the property. Accordingly,
the sale held on 28.05.2004 in favour of the
4th respondent herein is set aside paving
way for fresh steps to be taken by the
Recovery Officer, as indicated above.”
15.The question, therefore, is as to whether we should
confirm the aforesaid order whereby sale is cancelled or
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 13 of 18

give a chance to the petitioner to pay up the dues of DDA
and allow the auction to remain in his favour. In order to
take a particular view, some important facts, though
already taken note of, may be emphasised here.

The

company M/s.Wings Wear Pvt. Ltd. is already wound up
and is in liquidation.

The main asset is the property in

question. Liability of the secured creditor, namely, the
respondent bank and the workmen is approximately Rs.9
cores. There may be liabilities of unsecured creditors as
well. However, what is important is that the property was
valued at Rs.77 lakhs by the Recovery Officer and the bid
of the petitioner was Rs.78.05 lakhs.

The property is

located at Mohan Co-operative Industrial Estate and the
size of the plot over which the property is constructed is
1937.02 sq. yards (1619.58 sq. mtrs.).

As per the

calculations given by the DDA for the purpose of
calculating unearned increase, the circle rate of the land in
question is mentioned at Rs.26,080/- per sq. mtr. for the
year 2003-04. The property was sold in the year 2005 and
as per the practice, 2% of the above rate is to be added
and in this manner, the rate comes to Rs.26,602/-.

The

value of the plot, thus, calculated would come to
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 14 of 18

Rs.4,30,84,067.16P. It is a matter of common knowledge
that the market rates are generally higher than even the
circle rates. Thus, the value of the property in question at
the time when it was put to auction was in any case
Rs.4.30 crores or even more.

How such property was

valued at Rs.77 lakhs and then put to auction is puzzling.
It reflects adversely on the manner in which the office of
the Recovery Officer attached to the DRT functions. The
property is sought to be frittered away at a much lower
price by accepting the bid of Rs.78.05 lakhs of the
petitioner. Even if the petitioner is permitted to pay the
demands

raised

by

the

DDA

to

the

tune

of

Rs.2,99,49,621/- as on 30.9.2007, with this amount, the
share of the respondent bank as well as the workmen
would be negligible as compared to the total dues payable
to them. Such a course of auction is clearly not in public
interest. We are also amazed to see the conduct of the
respondent bank, which did not object to this valuation
and allowed the auction to take place and did not object
even when the highest bid of the petitioner at a meagre
amount of Rs.78.00 lakhs was accepted.

It is not

surprising that the petitioner has agreed to pay the
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 15 of 18

aforesaid dues as the property is sought to be given to him
for Rs.78.00 lakhs, worth whereof is manifold.
16.As held by the Supreme Court in Divya Manufacturing Co.
(P) Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Union Bank of India and Ors., (2000) 6
SCC 69 and LICA (P) Ltd. Vs. Official Liquidator and Anr.,
1995 (4) Com. Law Journal 494(SC), the guiding principle
in such auctions is to get the most remunerative price and
it is the duty of the Court to keep the openness of the
auction, so that the intending bidders would feel free to
offer the higher value. Needless to mention, this principle
has public purpose behind it. The assets being sold are of
a company, which has gone into liquidation.

There are

various creditors-secured and unsecured, lined up in the
queue, who are waiting for retrieval of their dues to the
maximum extent possible.

There are workers also, who

are to be paid their wages and their claims rank pari passu
with that of secured creditors.

It, therefore, necessarily

follows that the Court it to ensure that the assets are sold
at most remunerative price. No doubt, the aforesaid two
judgments were in respect of companies, which were in
liquidation and where the auction was held under the
supervision of the Company Judge. However, we are of the
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 16 of 18

opinion that this principle shall apply to the auction by the
Recovery Officer attached to the DRT as well.

In the

present case, not only the company is in liquidation, the
sale proceeds have to be distributed between the bank, a
secured creditor and the workers.

Even otherwise, the

property in question is mortgaged with the bank and on
the basis of orders passed in the OA filed by the bank, this
mortgaged property is put to sale by the Recovery Officer.
In that sense, he is the trustee of the property, who is
selling the same for the benefit of the mortgagee bank as
well as the workers. Therefore, the public purpose, which
was seen by the Apex Court while laying down the
principle in the aforesaid judgments, should be in the
forefront in such sales conducted by the Recovery Officer
as well, more particularly when the company has gone into
liquidation and the liquidation proceedings are pending
before the Company Judge as well.
17.We are in judicial review of the order passed by the
Appellate

Tribunal

and

exercising

our

discretionary

jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
when we find that such an action was in any case not in
public interest, we see no reason to interfere with the
WP(C) No.6575/2006

Page 17 of 18

order of the Appellate Tribunal cancelling the auction and
directing the Recovery Officer to put the property to sale
by taking fresh measures. There shall be proper valuation
of the property taking into consideration not only the circle
rates but also the market rates prevailing in that area.
18.The respondent bank shall also be within its right to get
the property auctioned through the Company Judge of this
Court before whom winding up proceedings are, pending if
so advised.
With these observations, we dismiss the writ petition.
