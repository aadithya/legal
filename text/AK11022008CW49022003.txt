CM No.2506/2006 in W.P(C) No.4902/2003

1.

This is an application filed by the respondent no.1/workman

under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking
direction to the petitioner to make payment of wages to the
respondent no.1 as per the minimum wages with effect from the date
of the award being 23rd May, 2002 till date.
2.

The

respondent

no.1/applicant

contended

that

he

was

appointed with the petitioner firm on the consolidated salary of
CM No.2506/2006
in W.P(C) No.4902/2003

Page 1 of 8

Rs.1300/- per month and his services were terminated on 14th March,
1992 and that despite best of his efforts he has remained unemployed
since the date of his termination. The respondent no.1 further pleaded
that the factum of his unemployment was also proved during his
evidence before the Labor Court and that the petitioner has failed to
prove the gainful employment of the respondent no.2 during trial. In
the circumstances the respondent no.2 has claimed relief under
section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
3.

A reply has been filed by the petitioner/non-applicant that as

the applicant has not worked for over 240 days immediately preceding
the date of termination with the petitioner, therefore the provisions of
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 would not be applicable and once this
court reaches such a conclusion then the impugned award passed by
the Labor Court would be a nullity and therefore the applicant is not
entitled for any relief under section 17B of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947. Reliance was also placed on the cross examination of the
respondent no.1 during trial to contend that the applicant has not
worked for 240 days with the petitioner as in terms of his own
statement no wages were received by the respondent no.1 till April
1991 and after 23rd December, 1991. The petitioner further contended
that the applicant is not entitled for any relief under section 17 B
since there is a delay of almost two years in filing the application, as
the writ petition was filed on 4th August, 2003 and the application
CM No.2506/2006
in W.P(C) No.4902/2003

Page 2 of 8

under section 17B was filed on 5th December, 2005. Regarding the
unemployment of the respondent no.1 since the date of termination of
his services the petitioner contended that being a computer expert it
is not possible that the applicant has remained unemployed despite
his best efforts as there is no dearth of employment. The petitioner
argued that the respondent has suppressed the fact of his gainful
employment. It is also contended that no proper valid affidavit has
been filed in terms of section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act and
thus the application under section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 is not maintainable.
4.

Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 comes into

operation when an Award directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in further proceedings by the employer. Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act is as under:"17-B. Payment of full wages to workman pending proceedings in Higher Courts. - Where in any case a Labour
Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal by its award directs
reinstatement of any workman and the employer prefers
any proceedings against such award in a High Court or
the Supreme Court, the employer shall be liable to pay
such workman, during the period of pendency of such
proceedings in the High Court or the Supreme Court, full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance
allowance admissible to him under any rule if the workman had not been employed in any establishment during
such period and an affidavit by such workman had been
filed to that effect in such court :
Provided that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the
High Court or the Supreme Court that such workman
had been employed and had been receiving adequate remuneration during any such period or part thereof, the
CM No.2506/2006
in W.P(C) No.4902/2003

Page 3 of 8

Court shall order that no wages hall be payable under
this section for such period or part, as the case may be."
5.

The statute, therefore, requires satisfaction of the following four

conditions for granting relief under section under section 17B of the
Act:
(i)

(ii)

during the pendency of such proceedings, employer
is required to pay full wages to the workman;

(iii)

the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any
maintenance allowance admissible to him under
any Rule;

(iv)

6.

an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in proceedings in a High Court or the
Supreme Court;

such wages would be admissible only if the
workman had not been employed in any
establishment during such period and an affidavit
had been filed to such effect.

On satisfaction of the requisites as laid down under section

17B, the court is bound to grant relief to the workman in terms of the
provision as laid down under section 17B of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947. The Court cannot go into the merits of the case/writ petition while deciding an application under section 17B of the Act as was
held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v.
Jagdish Chander. In para 7 of the said case, it was held as under:
“7. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that respondent was never employed by the petitioner, that
CM No.2506/2006
in W.P(C) No.4902/2003

Page 4 of 8

there was no employer-employee relation-ship between
them, that the management was proceeded ex parte in
the labour court due to the fault of its counsel, that the
petitioner was a victim of some fraud and that the petitioner has a very good case in the writ petition and
therefore the petitioner should not be directed to pay
wages payable under Section 17-B. But while considering an application under Section 17-B of the I.D.
Act this Court cannot go into the merits of the case
in the writ petition. The application has to be considered strictly in terms of Section 17-B, irrespective of the
merit of the writ petition. This Court can only consider
whether the requirements mentioned in Section 17-B
have been satisfied or not. If those requirements have
been satisfied and if it has not been proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the workman had been employed and had been receiving adequate remuneration
during the period of pendency of the writ petition, this
Court has no option but to direct the employer to pay
wages to the workman in terms of Section 17B, irrespective of the merit of the writ petition. As pointed out by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dena Bank Vs. Kritikumar T. Patel (supra) this Court cannot pass an order in
exercise of the power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to deny to the workman the benefit granted
under Section 17B of the I.D. Act, if he is entitled to such
benefit in terms of the said section. The only favour
that the employer can ask for is to expedite the disposal
of the writ petition.
Further granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the
rule; refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the
relief could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional error where there is no relationship of employer and employee
between the parties.
7.

The object underlying section 17B of the Industrial Disputes

Act, 1947 is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship
CM No.2506/2006
in W.P(C) No.4902/2003

Page 5 of 8

which would be caused to a workman due to delay in the
implementation of an award directing reinstatement of his services on
account of the challenge made to it by the employer.

Section 17B

recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body
and soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award
directing his reinstatement as the statutory provisions provides no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal.
8.

In the present case, by award dated 23rd May, 2002 the relief of

reinstatement was granted to the workman which award has been
assailed by the employer/petitioner and the operation of the same has
been stayed by this Court. The workman has categorically averred in
the application that he has not been employed since the date of
termination of his services being 14th March, 1992 and has also filed
affidavit deposing the same. Apart from bald denial the petitioner/non
applicant has placed nothing on record to negate the factum of
unemployment

of the respondent/workman

since

the

date

of

termination of their services. Merely on the presumption that there is
no dearth of employment and being a computer expert the respondent
no.1 could have easily got a job, the relief under section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 cannot be denied. The plea of the
petitioner that the respondent has not filed a valid and proper
affidavit is also unsustainable as no defect in the affidavit has been
CM No.2506/2006
in W.P(C) No.4902/2003

Page 6 of 8

pointed out.
9.

Whether the workman has worked with the petitioner for 240

days preceding the date of his termination and whether the award
passed by the Labor Court is nullity and whether the provisions of
Industrial disputes Act, 1947 are applicable, are issues which are to
be adjudicated. Merely on the basis of submissions of the petitioner
and on the ground that the petitioner has a good case on merit, the
relief under section 17B cannot be denied to the workman. Also an
application under Section 17B is to be disposed of expeditiously,
before deciding the writ petition without going into the merits of the
same. The Court while considering an application under Section 17B
of the Industrial disputes Act, 1947 has only to consider whether the
requisites mentioned therein have been satisfied. Adjudicating on
these pleas would tantamount to deciding the petition on merits
which is beyond the purview of section 17B of the Act. No limitation is
provided for filing an application by the workman under secton 17B of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Therefore the relief under section
17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 cannot be denied to the
petitioner on the ground that the application was filed two years after
the writ petition was filed by the petitioner.
10.

The applicants/workmen, in the facts and circumstances,

fulfills the criteria for availing the benefit under section 17B of the Act
CM No.2506/2006
in W.P(C) No.4902/2003

Page 7 of 8

and in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, if the
requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are
satisfied, no order can be passed denying the workman the benefit of
statutory provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947.
11.

For the foregoing reasons, the application is allowed and the

petitioner is directed to pay to the workman/applicant/respondent
the last drawn wages or the minimum wages whichever is higher from
the date of the award, i.e., 23rd May, 2002. Arrears of back wages or
the minimum wages, whichever is higher, be paid within eight weeks.
The management shall continue to pay last drawn or minimum
wages, whichever is higher, by 10th of every month. The respondent is
directed to file an undertaking that in case the writ petition is allowed,
difference between the last drawn wages and the minimum wages
shall be returned/repaid by the respondent within such time as may
be given by this Court. The undertaking to this effect be filed within 2
weeks.
With these directions the application is disposed of.
