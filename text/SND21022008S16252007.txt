1.

The plaintiff filed this suit claiming therein that the plaintiff had

video Copyright of 66 South Indian Films given in paragraph 3 of the
plaint. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants, who were having their
offices in Chennai were infringing copyright of the plaintiff. The
defendant No.1 was a company duly registered under the Companies Act
and defendants No.2 to 6 were retail shopkeepers who were selling the
films provided by defendant No.1. Plaintiff claimed that its valuable and
exclusive video rights in respect of 53 South Indian Films acquired from
M/s West Top Investment India Pvt. Ltd. by virtue of an agreement dated
28th July 2006 for consideration of Rs.25.3 million were being infringed
by the defendants. The plaintiff also claimed that it had acquired video
rights in respect of 10 films from M/s. Shree Devi Video Corporation by
virtue of an agreement dated 29th July 2006 for a consideration of Rs.9.5
million. The plaintiff pleaded that it also acquired video rights for film
Ullam Ketkume from G.V. Films by virtue of an agreement dated 26th
December 2006 for a sum of Rs.3 lac and in respect of the film Mouna
Geethagal from M/s N.S. Enterprises by virtue of an agreement dated
25.7.2006. It is stated that the plaintiff was having video rights in respect

IA Nos.10052/2007 & 10722/2007 in CS(OS) No. 1625/2007

Page No.1 of 5

of all 66 South Indian Films and the defendants by selling video
tapes/CDs/DVDs

of the above films were infringing the rights of the

plaintiff.
2.

The plaintiff by the above two applications under Order 39 Rule 1

& 2 CPC has prayed the Court for issuing interim injunction restraining
the defendants, servants, officers, distributors from manufacturing,
selling, circulating or distributing the video cassettes, VCDs/DVDs/LCDs
of 66 South Indian Films as mentioned by the plaintiff, during pendency
of suit.
3.

Defendant No.1 in its reply stated that defendant No.1 was dealing

in manufacturing and distributors of VCDs and DVDs in Chennai.
Defendant No.1 purchased copyrights of more than 1450 Tamil Films.
Defendant No.1 purchased copyrights and negatives of the films either
from the original producers of the films or from copyrights holders for
VCDs and DVDs. Defendant No.1 had released more than 570 Tamil
Films on VCDs and more than 230 films on DVDs. Defendant No.1 had
purchased copyrights of all such Films from the respective copyrights
holders before starting Manufacturing DVDs and VCDs of the films.
Defendant No.1 vide an agreement dated 4.12.1998 between Defendant
No. 1 and M/s O.K. Films purchased the copyrights of 100 titles of films.
Vide agreement dated 27th December, 2002, between defendant O.K.
Films copyrights of 74 titles of films were purchased, vide agreement
dated 15th October 2003 between M/s Thruvalla Kallakodam and M/s
Movieland he purchased

copyrights of 4 titles of the films, vide lease

agreement dated 6.5.2005 between Meta Audio and defendant No.1
copyrights of one title was purchased. Copies of all these agreements
have been placed on record. It is stated that due to business rivalry, one
rival company M/s West Top Investment India Pvt. Ltd and Shree Devi
Corporation sold the copyrights of even those title of films which
belonged to defendant No.1, to the plaintiff and to some other
companies. After coming to know of such sale, defendant No.1 filed a suit

IA Nos.10052/2007 & 10722/2007 in CS(OS) No. 1625/2007

Page No.2 of 5

in the High Court of Judicature at Madras being Suit No. 474 of 2007. It
is stated that defendant No.1 also found that another firm Modern
Cinema based in Madras was producing and selling DVDs of the films
copyrights of which was with the defendant so defendant No.1 filed a suit
against Modern Cinema being Suit No. CS No.213 of 2005 at High Court
of Judicature at Madras. Defendant No.1 also filed a suit against M/s
Modern Cinema at Madras being CS No. 333 of 2007 seeking injunction
from exploitation and infringement of copyrights of about 100 films held
by defendant No.1 and vide an order dated 19 th April, 2007, an interim
injunction was granted by the High Court of Judicature at Madras from
exploitation and infringement of copyrights of defendant No.1 in respect
of titles as mentioned in the order. Defendant No.1 filed another suit
under Section 52 and 65 of Indian Copyrights Act before the High Court
of Judicature at Madras seeking declaration of its absolute ownership of
the copyright and VCDs and DVDs and LCDs rights for entire India in
respect of films mentioned in the schedule and seeking permanent
injunction against defendants and their agents from infringing the
copyrights. It is submitted that huge litigation was going on between
plaintiff and defendant No.1 and other parties before the High Court of
Judicature at Madras. Defendant No.1 enumerated the various litigations
pending between the parties in an application under Order 10 CPC, made
by the defendant No.1 for stay of proceedings. Defendant No.1 submitted
that though the plaintiff was litigating at Chennai, in order to harass the
defendant No.1, plaintiff filed the instant suit in Delhi seeking injunction
initially against defendant No.1 and, thereafter, plaintiff, in order to
pressurize, made the shopkeepers and distributors also as parties to the
suit by way of amendment. It is submitted that defendant No.1 was
holding valid copyrights in respect of the films being distributed by
defendant No.1 and which have been listed by the plaintiff in the plaint
as its own copyrights. Defendant No.1 placed on record various
agreements in respect of the films of which defendant No.1 had

IA Nos.10052/2007 & 10722/2007 in CS(OS) No. 1625/2007

Page No.3 of 5

copyrights.
4.

A perusal of agreements filed by the defendant No.1 would show

that these agreements were prior in time than that of the plaintiff. The
agreements were entered into by defendant No.1 with the original
copyrights holders or their assignees. Defendant No.1 also placed on
record the copies of plaints and suits and applications filed at High Court
of Judicature at Madras.
5.

I have perused the various agreements filed by the plaintiff and

defendant No.1. I find that except for the following films, the defendant
No.1 was having copyrights assigned to it by the original copyrights
holder in respect of all other films:
1. Karagattakaran,
2. Puthiya Paravai,
3. Ullam Ketkume,
4. Meera
5. Villupaatukkaran

Except these five films, defendant No.1 was prima facie the lawful
holder of copyrights and rights to release VCDs, DVDs, LCDs.
6.

It is also apparent that the plaintiff has not approached the Court

with clean hands. The plaintiff did not state in its plaint about the
previous litigations pending between the plaintiff and defendant No.1 at
High Court of Judicature at Madras. It is also apparent that the plaintiff,
prima faice, in order to affect the business of defendant No.1,
subsequently

made the distributors and shopkeepers, who were

distributing the films of defendant No.1 as party, while initially they were
not made parties to the suit. Later on plaintiff filed an application under
Order 23 Rule 3 that plaintiff had entered into a compromise with these
shopkeepers. I find that plaintiff has failed to show that prima facie it had
better rights than defendant No.1 or that defendant No.1 was infringing
the rights of the plaintiff. Despite the fact that defendant was located in

IA Nos.10052/2007 & 10722/2007 in CS(OS) No. 1625/2007

Page No.4 of 5

Chennai and litigation was already going on between plaintiff and
defendant No1 in Chennai, all the films are Tamil or Telgu Films, the
plaintiff chose to file the instant suit before this Court without disclosing
about the earlier litigation going on with the defendant No.1.
7.

The plaintiff has also failed to show that it was going to suffer an

irreparable loss or injuries in case the interim injunction is refused to the
plaintiff. If plaintiff suffers a monetary loss, the plaintiff can always claim
damages. Moreover, whether the rights of plaintiff were superior to the
rights of the defendant No.1 since both claim that they were holding
valid copyrights, can be adjudicated only after evidence. The Court
cannot outrightly reject the claim of defendant No.1 without evidence
that defendant No.1's copyrights are invalid or bad.
8.

The applications of the plaintiff are dismissed in respect of the

films listed by it in the plaint except for films:
1. Karagattakaran,
2. Puthiya Paravai,
3. Ullam Ketkume,
4. Meera
5. Villupaatukkaran
The

defendant

No.1

is

restrained

from

distributing

or

manufacturing DVDs/VCDs of above five films during the pendency of
instant suit.
