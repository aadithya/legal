Sh. Mahesha Nand joined the defence organization as Civil
Cleaner on 9.8.1947.

WP(C) No.15556/2004

On 20.9.1957 he was boarded out

medically from service. He expired on 15.2.1958. The petitioner
Bhodra Devi, who is widow of Mahesha Nand, was given family
pension w.e.f. 14.1.1988. However, the Family Pension Scheme
was launched by the respondents w.e.f. 22.9.1977.

The

petitioner was not given pension for the period September 1977
to January 1988. The petitioner was informed that she was not
granted the pensionary benefit w.e.f. 1977 because the medical
and other record of her late husband were not traceable as the
same were destroyed by the concerned department.

The

petitioner sent legal notice dated 19.6.2004 calling upon the
respondents to take necessary measures to ensure that the
petitioner is provided pensionary benefits w.e.f. September 1977
to 14.1.1988.

Consequently, she filed the present writ petition

with the following prayers :
“(a) to issue necessary writ/orders/directions to the
respondent thereby directing the respondent to family
pension to the petitioners w.e.f. September 1977
instead of 14.1.1988.
(b) to direct the respondents to provide the
petitioner the pension/other pensionary benefits for
which the late husband of petitioner was entitled from
the date of his retirement upto his death.
(c) to issue necessary directions to the respondents
in the nature of appropriate writ/orders thereby
directing the respondents to do the needful at the
earliest.

WP(C) No.15556/2004

(d) to direct the respondent to pay the damages to
the tune of Rs.5 lacs to the petitioner on account of
their negligence and not performing their statutory
obligation in petitioner’s favour which has resulted
into mental pain, agony and further hardship
inconvenience.
(e) to issue/pass any other writ/order/directions to
the respondent in the fitness of circumstances of the
case.”
2.

The respondents have contested the present petition.

3.

We have heard the counsel for the parties.

The learned

counsel for the respondent strenuously argued that as per Family
Pension Scheme, which was introduced on 22.9.1977, the
petitioner became entitled to get the pension. He also drew the
attention of the court towards the fact that as per Rule 54 of CCS
Pension Rules, 1972 the petitioner was entitled for pension w.e.f.
22.9.77.

Again vide its letter dated 8.12.1999 the respondent

assigned the reason of granting pension w.e.f. 14.1.1988 as per
Government of India order Dept. of P&P.W. O.M. No. 1/75/87P&P.W. dated 14.1.1988. It is pointed out that the said order was
only applicable on temporary / quasi permanent employees
whereas the petitioner’s husband was a permanent employee
and therefore the petitioner should have been granted pension
w.e.f. 22.9.1977. It was explained that the cause of action arose

WP(C) No.15556/2004

Page 3 of 7

in favour of the petitioner on 18.9.2003 when the petitioner’s
request for grant of pension was declined and she was asked not
to make further correspondence.
4.

The counsel for the petitioner kept on veering from the

main topic but did not come to grips with the real problem. It is
pertinent to note that the petitioner is receiving the said pension
w.e.f. 14.1.1988 till the filing of the instant petition without any
demur or objection.
3.8.1994.

She made the first representation on

She went on accepting the pension for 16 years

without raising any objection.

It provoked not even an iota of

action or whimper of protest. The documents of a non-pensioner
is required to be retained for a period of 25 years as per para 595
of Regulation for the Army, 1987(revised edition). On expiry of
the said mandatory detention period, the said documents are
destroyed.

Vide letter dated 8.12.1999 the petitioner was

informed that “it is verified from our records that as per the ASC
Records (MT) Bangalore letter No. 1033/Sub/11/47/FT(Pre 64) dt.
28.8.1991, the records of the individual were destroyed being
time barred. However, it was clearly mentioned in the said letter
that the individual was medically boarded out of service without
any pensionary benefits. In such cases family pension benefits

5.

Moreover, what is to be borne in mind that petitioner is

getting family pension from 14.1.1988. The claim in the petition
is to grant pension for the period from September 1977 to
13.1.1988.

Thus, the pension for a particular period is

demanded. This cannot be a case of continuous cause of action
and the consideration for laches and delays would come into play
for a relief like this. Viewed from this angle, we are of the opinion
that the petition suffers from unexplained delays and laches.

another, 1995 IV AD (Delhi) 177, the facts were these, the
petitioner had retired in 1956.
rejected in 1957.

His claim for pension was also

Writ petition under Article 226 of the

Constitution of India challenging rejection of claim for pension
was filed in the year 1993. It was held :
“5. It is true that ordinarily in matters relating to
pension the writ courts do not deny the relief on
account of delay merely. A sympathetic and liberal
view is always taken. Indulgence is invariably shown.
In the case of Bachan Kaur v. Union of India, (W.P. 621
of 1989) decided on 13.4.1985, a Division Bench of
this court has taken the view that a writ petition
claiming pension if the claim be otherwise just and

WP(C) No.15556/2004

Page 5 of 7

legal may be entertained and allowed limiting the
same to a period of three years before the date of
filing of the petition. In the present case the petitioner
has on account of culpable delay and laches extending
over a period of 25 years himself created a situation
which disentitles him to any relief. The service record
of the petitioner is not available. It is not known as to
why and in what circumstances the petitioner was
paid merely the gratuity and yet felt satisfied
therewith though no pension was allowed. If only the
petitioner would have approached the court within a
reasonable time, the respondents could have been
directed to search and produce the relevant service
record of the petitioner enabling a just decision of the
petitioner’s claim, which is not possible in the present
case. The entire fault is of the petitioner. Howsoever
sympathetic we may be with the petitioner, sitting as
a writ court, we cannot grant relief of pension, to the
petitioner merely as a charity of bounty in the absence
of relevant facts being determinable and relevant
documents available.”
7.

Similar view was taken by a Division Bench of this court in

case reported in Shri Bhagwan Vs. Union of India, 2003 (1) AD
(Delhi) 185.
8.

In a recent authority reported in Shiv Dass Vs. Union of India

and others, AIR 2007 SC 1330, it was held :
“9. In the case of pension the cause of action
actually continues from month to month.
That,
however, cannot be a ground to overlook delay in
filing the petition. It would depend upon the fact of
each case. If petition is filed beyond a reasonable
period say three years normally the court would reject
the same or restrict the relief which could be granted
to a reasonable period of about three years. The High
Court did not examine whether on merit appellant had
a case. If on merits it would have found that there

WP(C) No.15556/2004

Page 6 of 7

was no scope for interference, it would have dismissed
the writ petition on that score alone.
10. In the peculiar circumstances, we remit the
matter to the High Court to hear the writ petition on
merits. If it is found that the claim for disability
pension is sustainable in law, then it would mould the
relief but in no event grant any relief for a period
exceeding three years from the date of presentation of
the writ petition. We make it clear that we have not
expressed any opinion on the merits as to whether
appellant’s claim for disability pension is maintainable
or not. If it is sans merit, the High Court naturally
would dismiss the writ petition.”
(Emphasis added)
9.

In the light of the discussion it is clear that the stale claim

made by the petitioner cannot be granted in favour of the
petitioner after inordinate delay of so much time and due to the
destruction of the record in question.

The court can grant her

pension for the last three years only. The court has no power to
grant her pension pertaining to the years 1977 to 1988 i.e. after
the lapse of 16 years from 2004. The writ petition is therefore
dismissed but there shall be no orders as to costs.
