1.

This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner on the

allegation that it was the owner of certain machinery which it had
hired to M/s You One-Maharia(JV) (respondent no. 2 herein) vide an
agreement dated 23rd February, 2004. It is further submitted that

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 1 of 37

the respondent no. 2 had entered into a contract with the National
Highway Authority of India (Respondent no. 1 herein) for a project
relating to the eight of Km 16.500 to Km 29.295 of the National
Highway 1 in the State of Delhi.
2.

The petitioner has submitted that it has been constrained to

file the present writ petition inasmuch as the respondent no. 1 has
confined the machinery of the present petitioner by deputing security
guards at the tenanted premises of the petitioner. The petitioner
seeks the following prayers by way of the present writ petition :-

3.

“(a) to issue Writ of Mandamus commanding the
Respondent No. 1 to remove their Security Guards
from the petitioner's Office Premises and release
the machineries of the Petitioner which have been
illegally seized by respondent No. 1 as mentioned
in the Annexure-P.7(Colly) annexed along with the
present petition;
(b) pass any such or further order, as this
Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the
facts and circumstances of the instant case.”
The writ petition has been filed by the petitioner on the specific

plea that it had purchased machinery in the nature of Tippers-Tata II
YYA(10 numbers), Tandem Roller-1R make(2 Numbers), Vibratory
Compactors MOMAG - Greaves(2 Numbers), Mechanical PaverApollo(1 Number), Sensor Paver- IR make(1 Number), Wheel

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 2 of 37

Loader-TATA(1 Number), 500 KVA Genset-Greaves(1 Number),
Bitumen Sprayer-Apollo(1 Number), Misc Machinery Viz. Mixers,
Weigh Batchwers, Pumps Tools Tackles, Lab Items, Furniture Etc.,”.
This machinery was purchased against bank loans over a period
commencing from November, 2002 till February, 2003. Invoices in
this behalf have been placed on record from page 60 to 69 of the
paper book. This machinery was delivered to the premises of the
petitioner at Salem, Tamilnadu. The machines were registered in the
name of the petitioner by the competent authority and the certificates
of registration have been placed before this court from page 70 of the
paper book. The documentation reflects that purchase of some of the
machines was financed by the Citi Corporation and HDFC and such
machines are hypothecated to these institutions.
4.

The respondent no. 2 entered into the aforestated contract with

the National Highway Authority of India on the 31st May, 2001 at a
contract price of Rs.60,68,53,375.80.

In the year 2003, the

respondent no. 2 started hiring the machinery of the petitioner from
time to time.

On disputes arising inter se the respondents, the

respondent no. 1 terminated the contract with the respondent no. 2

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 3 of 37

on 11th December, 2004 on the purported ground of the respondent
no.2 having produced forged bank guarantees.
On 18th December, 2004, the respondent no. 1 is alleged to have
trespassed into the petitioner's camp office and placed security
guards on the petitioner's machines without any lawful authority and
without assigning any reasons. These security guards have prevented
the petitioner from accessing its machines without any valid reasons.
Accordingly, the petitioner is alleged to have made a police
complaint on 19th December, 2004 to the SHO, Police Station Alipur,
Delhi. On 20th December, 2004, the petitioner represented to the
project director of the respondent no. 1 protesting in writing that its
machines lying in its offices were not connected with either of the
respondents and that the same were exclusively owned by and vested
with the petitioner. The petitioner represented to the respondent no.
1 again on 21st December, 2004 and upon the failure of the
respondent

no.

1 to

remove

the

security

guards,

claimed

compensation at the rate of Rs.2 lakhs per day.
It is alleged that the respondent no. 1 has not removed the
security guards and the machinery of the petitioner is being confined

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 4 of 37

without any justification, resulting in damage to the machinery and
huge loss of hire charges every day to the petitioner.

It is further

contended that the petitioner is not a party to any agreement
between the respondent no. 1 and respondent no. 2 and that no
liability can be fastened upon it for any breach of liability of the
respondent no. 2 to the respondent no. 1.

The action of the

respondent no. 1 in confining and seizing the machinery of the
petitioner has been impugned as being illegal and without
jurisdiction. It has further been submitted that the machinery is not
located at any site or temporary works or works which form the
subject matter of the contract dated 31st May, 2001 between the
respondent no. 1 and respondent no. 2. The office of the petitioner
whereof machinery was located and has been confined, is stated to be
a tenanted premises of the petitioner located far away from the site of
the project.
5.

The writ petition is opposed by the respondent no. 1 primarily

on the submission that respondent no. 1 was empowered under
clause 61.1 of the contract dated 31st May, 2001 to seize the entire
machinery. It is contended that as per this clause, all materials on

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 5 of 37

the site, plant equipment, temporary works and works are deemed to
be the property of the employer (respondent no. 1 herein) if the
contract is terminated because of the fault of the respondent no. 2.
The respondent no. 1 has submitted that the machinery was utilised
for the purpose of the project and as such would be covered under
clause 61.1. According to the respondent no. 1, the respondent no. 2
having committed a fraud by submitting forged bank guarantees has
defaulted in discharge of its contractual liabilities and as such the
respondent no. 1 is justified in seizing the plant and machinery. It
has further been stated that the respondent no. 2 was required to
inform the respondent no. 1 with regard to the title of the machinery
being utilised for the purposes of the project. Reliance has been
placed on certain stipulations in the invitation to bid especially clause
4.5 whereby the bidder was require to demonstrate availability,
whether owned or leased or by procurement, of all the key and
critical equipment for this work as per annexure 1 which gave the list
of major equipment which would be required for completion of the
works. The list of plant and machinery has been set out in anenxure 1
thereto. Respondent no. 1 has relied upon clause 1.5 of the format

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 6 of 37

whereby the bidder was required to list information relating to the
machines as per his own planning. One of the columns required a
statement to be made as to whether the machinery was owned or
leased or was to be procured by the bidder.
6.

The principal submission of Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned senior

counsel appearing for respondent no. 1 is based on the plea that the
National Highway Authority of India was undertaking a project of a
national importance and that it had advanced Rs.14.10 crores to the
respondent no. 2 which it was required to secure by bank guarantees.
Such bank guarantees being found forged, the contract was
terminated in terms of clause 69.2 of its agreement with the
respondent no. 2 and seizure of the property in question was effected
in terms of clause 61.1.

It has further been contended that the

respondent no. 2 has made no challenge to either the termination of
the contract or the seizure of the material and that the petitioner has
been set up as an afterthought.

The contention is that despite

termination having been effected on the 11th December, 2004, no
claim was laid by the respondent no. 2 that it was not the owner of
the plant and machinery. The first communication informing the

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 7 of 37

NHAI-respondent no. 1 of the fact that the equipment was in fact not
owned by the contractor was by way of the communication from
respondent no. 2 sent vide a letter dated 7th December, 2004 which is
stated to have been received by the respondent no. 1 only on 21st
December, 2004. Learned senior counsel contends that even by this
letter, the respondent no. 2 was seeking permission to shift the
machineries.
7.

It has been vehemently urged on behalf of the respondent no. 1

that the contract of the respondent no. 2 and the manner in which the
petitioners and the respondent no. 2 have acted in the present matter
disentitles them to exercise of discretion under the extraordinary
jurisdiction of this court under Article 226. It is contended that the
respondent no. 2 has acted dishonestly and fraudulently and that the
petitioner is hand in glove with the respondent no. 2.
8.

It is further contended that the respondent no. 1 has filed a

petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
when the respondent no. 2 was removing the machines seeking the
following prayers :“(a) By way of ex-parte ad interim order restrain
the Respondents or its agents, officers, assigns,
W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 8 of 37

9.

transferees, executors, administrators or any other
person from removing, tampering, alienating,
parting away or in any way disposing off or
creating any third party interest in any manner
whatsoever all materials i.e. any Plant, Equipment,
Machinery, Temporary works and works existing at
the Site i.e. the stretch of National Highway from
Km 464.00 to Km. 474.00 of Hyderabad - Nagpur
Section and Km. 9/400 to 22/300 of Hyderabad
Bangalore Section of the National Highway No.7;
and/or
(b) direct the concerned Police authorities i.e.
Commissioner of Police, Cyberabad and concerned
Police Station of Shamshabad and Alwal to provide
security to the machinery, equipment more clearly
mentioned in the Schedule annexed.
(c) to award the costs of the petition; and
(d) to pass such other order or orders as this
Hon'ble Court feels just and necessary in the
circumstances of the case.”
By an ex parte order dated 15th April, 2005 passed on the

original side of this court in this petition registered as OMP No.
120/2005, the respondent no. 2, its agents, officers,

executaries,

administrators or any other person have being restrained from
removing a tempting or parting or in any manner disposing of or
creating any third party interest whatsoever in all materials in plant,
equipment, machinery, temporary works and work existing at the site
office and stretch of national highway from Km 44.300 to Km 66.00
of National Highway 1 in the State of Haryana.

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

On behalf of

page 9 of 37

respondent no. 1 it is objected that in view of these proceedings, the
only course available to the petitioner is to file an application seeking
variation of the interim order of stay.
An objection has also been taken that the writ petition raises
disputed questions of fact which cannot be adjudicated upon in the
present matter. It has been contended that the basic issue as to
whether the plant and machinery is located at the site itself is an
issue of fact and that the same cannot be decided without recording
of evidence.
10.

Mr. Ravikesh Sinha, learned counsel appearing on behalf of

respondent no. 2 has pointed out that it has informed the respondent
no. 1 with regard to the machinery which it was proposing to use for
the project and also machinery which was being purchased out of the
mobilisation advance received by this respondent from the
respondent no. 1 and that the machinery claimed by the petitioner
was not part of either of these two lists.

It is admitted by this

respondent no. 2 that it had hired the machinery of the petitioner and
that the respondent no. 1 had no authority whatsoever to seize such
machinery.

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 10 of 37

11.

Learned counsel appearing for respondent no. 2 submitted that

this writ petition was filed as back as on 7th April, 2004 after service
of advance copy on the respondent no. 1 on 8th April, 2005. It has
been pointed out that the writ petition was listed on 13th April, 2005
when notice was accepted on behalf of the National Highway
Authority of India by counsel in court. OMP No. 120/2005 is stated
to have been filed thereafter and it is contended that the respondent
no. 1 has not disclosed therein the factum of pendency of the present
writ petition before this court. It was aware of the claim being made
by the petitioner yet did not implead the petitioner as a party and did
not even mention the pendency of the present writ petition or its
particulars in its petition.
12.

It has further been contended by Mr. Sinha, learned counsel

appearing for respondent no. 1 that the issues raised in the present
writ petition have been the subject matter of adjudication in a
judgment dated 4th April, 2005 passed IA Nos. 973/2005 and
950/2005 in OMP No. 342/2004 and that in view of the law laid
down by this court, the objections of the respondent no. 1 to the writ
petition are wholly unwarranted and misconceived.

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 11 of 37

13.

There can be no dispute that it is only parties to the contract

who would be bound by the terms of the contract dated 31st May,
2001. So far as clause 61.1 contained therein and relied upon by
respondent no. 1 is concerned, the same reads as under :“61.1 All materials on the Site, Plant, Equipment,
Temporary Works and Works are deemed to be the
property of the Employer, if the Contract is
terminated because of a Contractor's default.”
The contract in the instant case was terminated on 11th
December, 2004 on the ground that the bank guarantees submitted
by the respondent no. 2 were forged without there being any
allegation of any other default against the respondent no. 2. The
respondent no. 2 has submitted an explanation in respect of the
allegations against it. However, inasmuch as the same is not relevant
for the purposes of the present case, there is no reason to dwell on
the same any further.
14.

I find that a similar issue was placed before this court

exercising jurisdiction on the original side in OMP No. 342/2004
entitled National Highway Authority of India vs M/s You OneMaharia (JV) & Ors. relating to a project of four laning from Km 464
to Km 474 of the Nagpur Highway and Km 9.4 to Km 22.3 of the

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 12 of 37

Hyderabad Bangalore section. In this case, as in the present matter,
for the reason that the bank guarantees submitted by the respondent
no. 2 were found to be forged, the respondent no. 1 terminated the
agreement with it and seized the machinery stated to be on the
project site in terms of clause 61.1.
It is to be noted that in this petition being OMP No. 342/2004
under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, an ex parte
interim order dated 1st October, 2004 had been made restraining the
respondent no. 2 from removing any equipment or machinery from
the site.
15.

Thereafter, two applications were filed in OMP No. 342/2004,

one being IA No. 973/2005 by M/s Hycon Infrastructure Limited
(formerly known as M/s AMR Project) and the second IA No.
950/2005 by another third party. Both the applicants stated that
they had respectively leased out certain equipment to M/s You OneMaharia (JV) & Ors. (respondent no. 2 herein) at a monthly rental for
a contracted period. As contended by the petitioner in the present
case, it was contended by the applicants that their machines had been
wrongly seized by the National Highway Authority of India. The

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 13 of 37

applicants sought release of their equipment and variation of the ex
parte interim order dated 1st October, 2004 passed in favour of the
National Highway Authority of India in these proceedings.
16.

The propositions in law and fact urged in support of and

against the IA Nos. 973/2005 and 950/2005 were identical to those
urged before this court. After hearing detailed submissions vide a
judgment dated 4th April, 2005, the court allowed the Nos. 973/2005
and 950/2005.

To the extent

that the judgment decides issues

raised before me, it would be appropriate to reproduce the relevant
portions of the judgment in extenso :“20. Clause 51 of the contract deals with advance
payment towards mobilization, its repayment and
guarantee to be issued at the time of advance
payments. The clause reads as under :“51. Advance payment
51.1 The Employer shall make
advance payment to the Contractor of
the amounts stated in the Contract
Data by the date stated in the Contract
Data, against provision by the
Contractor of an Unconditional Bank
Guarantee in a form and by a bank
acceptable to the Employer in amounts
and currencies equal to the advance
payment. The guarantee shall remain
effective until the advance payment has
been repaid, but the amount of the
guarantee shall be progressively
W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 14 of 37

reduced by the amounts repaid by the
Contractor.
Interest will not be
charged on the advance payment.
51.2 The Contractor is to use the
advance payment only to pay for
Equipment, Plant and Mobilization
expenses required specifically for
execution of the Works.
The
Contractor shall demonstrate that
advance payment has been used in this
way by supplying copies of invoices or
other documents to the Engineer.
51.3 The advance payment shall be
repaid by deducting proportionate
amounts from payments otherwise due
to the Contractor, following the
schedule of completed percentages of
the Works on a payment basis. No
account shall be taken of the advance
payment or its repayment in assessing
valuations of work done, Variations,
price
adjustments,
Compensation
Events, or Liquidated Damages.”
21. Clause 51.4 deals with secured advance in
respect of materials. Clause reads as under :
“51.4 Secured Advance:
The Engineer shall make advance
payment in respect of materials
intended for but not yet incorporated in
the Works in accordance with
conditions stipulated in the Contract
Data.”
22. Clause 61 of the Contract which was relied
upon by counsel for the petitioner reads as under :“61. Property
61.1 All materials on the Site, Plant,
Equipment, Temporary Works and
Works are deemed to be the property
W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 15 of 37

of the Employer, if the Contract is
terminated because of a Contractor's
default.”
23. xxxxx
24. xxxxx
25. xxxxx
26. Sh. A.K. Bajpai, learned counsel for the
applicant urged that its machinery should be
released for the reason said machinery was not
purchased from the mobilization advance paid by
the petitioner to the first respondent.
27. A perusal of clause 51.1 of the contract shows
that the first respondent was to secure the advance
payment received from the petitioner by
submitting unconditional bank guarantees. The
bank guarantees were to remain effective till the
advance payment was repaid; guarantee to be
progressively reduced by the amounts repaid by
the first respondent. Clause 51.2 enjoins upon the
first respondent to use the advance payment to
purchase equipment, plant and mobilization
expenses required for execution of the works.
Further, first respondent has to demonstrate that
advance payment has been used by supplying
copies of invoices or other documents to the
engineer of the petitioner.
28. Clause 61.1 has to be read in harmony
with clause 51.1 and clause 51.2. Only such
plant and equipment can be deemed to be
the property of the employer which are
covered by clause 51.1 and 51.2.
29. Any other construction would mean that
equipment on hire would vest in the petitioner
without liability to pay lease-rental to the third
party concerned. Further, plant and equipment
which has been purchased from out of the advance
paid by the petitioner requires to be secured to the
petitioner till it recovers the advance. Thus, the
W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 16 of 37

charge cannot extend to any other material or
equipment.
30. At best, petitioner would be entitled to
injunction only in respect of the plant and
equipment which was purchased by the
respondents from the advance received by
the respondents from the petitioner and for
which invoices or other documents were
submitted to the petitioner in terms of
clause 51.2 of the contract.

17.

Learned senior counsel appearing for respondent no. 1, on

instructions informs that this judgment was not assailed in appeal
and has become final between the parties.
It is however contended that the respondent no. 1 was protected
in the aforestated judgment in the following terms :
“37. Value of the machinery would have
depreciated. Bank guarantees have been found to
be forged. Petitioner has been held by this court as
not entitled to any interim relief against the
equipments of the applicant of IAs No. 973/2005
and 950/2005. Petitioner has been held to be
entitled to an injunctive relief only in respect of
such machinery which has been purchased by
respondent No. 1 from out of the mobilization
advance. Petitioner remains unsecured in the sum
of Rs.56 lacs, assuming that the value of the
machinery continues to be the same, a fact which
this court can safely presume as not in the realm of
likelihood.”

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 17 of 37

18.

I find that after recording the findings noticed above the court

ordered thus :
“40. IAs No. 973/2005 and 950/2005 and OMP
No. 342/2004 are accordingly disposed of
modifying the ex-parte ad interim order
dated 1.10.2004 by restricting its operation
to such of the plant and equipment which
has been brought to site by the first
respondent by purchasing the same from
out of the mobilization advance received
and continuing the said interim order as
modified, till the arbitral tribunal decides on the
merits of the controversy. Ordered accordingly.
41. Further, mandatory directions are issued to
the first respondent to furnish a bank guarantee in
sum of Rupees 2 crores (two crores) in favour of
the petitioner and as per the format of the
guarantees which have been found to be forged.
Said bank guarantee to be kept alive till decision
on the disputes between the parties by the arbitral
tribunal.”

19.

Before this court, all the parties have read several clauses in the

agreement dated 31st May , 2001 executed inter se the respondents.
The material clause to be considered for this adjudication reads as
under:-

“51. Advance Payment

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 18 of 37

51.1 The employer shall make advance
payment to the Contractor of the amounts stated in
the Contract Data by the date stated in the
Contract Data, against provision by the Contractor
of an Unconditional Bank Guarantee in a form and
by a bank acceptable to the Employer in amounts
and currencies equal to the advance payment. The
guarantee shall remain effective until the advance
payment has been repaid, but the amount of the
guarantee shall be progressively reduced by the
amounts repaid by the Contractor. Interest will
not be charged on the advance payment.
51.2 The Contractor is to use the advance
payment only to pay for Equipment, Plant and
Mobilization expenses required specifically for
execution of the Works. The Contractor shall
demonstrate that advance payment has been used
in this way by supplying copies of invoices or other
documents to the Engineer.
51.3 The advance payment shall be repaid by
deducting proportionate amounts from payments
otherwise due to the Contractor, following the
schedule of completed percentages of the Works
on a payment basis. No account shall be taken of
the advance payment or its repayment in assessing
valuations of work done, Variations, price
adjustments compensation Events, or Liquidated
Damages.
51.4 Secured Advance
The Engineer shall make advance payment in
respect of materials intended for but not yet
incorporated in the Works in accordance with
conditions stipulated in the Contract Data.
(c) the Employer or the Contractor is made
bankrupt or goes into liquidation other than for a
reconstruction or amalgamation;
(d) a payment certified by the Engineer is not
paid by the Employer to the Contractor within 56
W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 19 of 37

days of the date of the Engineer's certificate.
(e) the Engineer gives Notice that failure to
correct a particular Defect is a fundamental breach
of Contract and the Contractor fails to correct it
within a reasonable period of time determined by
the Engineer.
(f) the Contractor does not maintain a security
which is required.
(g) the Contractor has delayed the completion of
works by the number of days for which the
maximum amount of liquidated damages becomes
payable as defined in the Contract data; and
(h) if the Contractor, in the judgment of the
Employer has engaged in corrupt or fraudulent
practices in competing for or in the executing the
Contract.
For the purpose of this paragraph: : “corrupt
practice” means the offering, giving, receiving or
soliciting of any thing of value to influence the
action of a public official in the procurement
process or in contract execution. “Fraudulent
practice” means a misrepresentation of facts in
order to influence a procurement process or the
execution of a contract to the detriment of the
Borrower, and includes collusive practice among
Bidders (prior to or after bid submission)

designed to establish bid prices at artificial noncompetitive levels and to deprive the Borrower of
the
benefits of free and open completion.”
59.4 Notwithstanding the above, the Employer
may terminate the Contract for convenience.
59.5 If the Contract is terminated the Contractor
shall stop work immediately, make the Site saea nd
secure and leave the Site as soon as reasonably
W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 20 of 37

possible.”
20.

These stipulations are identical to the stipulations in the clause

51 and 61.1 which were considered by the court in OMP No.
342/2004. The findings returned by the court on consideration of
these covenants was that by virtue of clause 61.1, respondent no. 1
could claim entitlement only in respect of plant and machinery which
was purchased by the respondent no. 2 from the advances received
by the respondent no. 2 from the National Highway Authority of
India and for which invoices and other documents were submitted to
it in terms of clause 51.2 of the contract.
21.

There is yet another angle from which the issues raised have to

be examined. It is noteworthy that the Anenxure-1 to the invitation
to bid (placed at page 137 of the record) which sets out the major
plant and equipment required to be deployed on the contract works
gives a list of 13

items which was as hereunder :-

This document would lose

significance upon the parties formalising the contract. It may be
noticed that it is not necessary to examine this particular issue in
such detail for the purposes of the present writ petition. However,
the same has been dealt with at such length only on account of the
stress places by both parties on this issue.
24.

The respondent no. 1 has further admitted that the respondent

no. 2 did not claim that it would be utilising the machinery
(ownership whereof has been claimed by the petitioner) for carrying
out the work in its bid form. It is an admitted position that this
machinery was not listed in the machinery disclosed by the
respondent no. 2 in clause B 1.5 of its bid form.
W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 23 of 37

It is also admitted by the respondent no. 1 that there was no bar
to the respondent no. 2 utilising machinery other than what had been
disclosed in its bid form. No contractual or other provision can be
pointed out by learned senior counsel appearing for respondent no. 1
requiring the respondent no. 2 to keep the respondent no. 1 informed
about other machinery and equipment acquired by it or utilised for
the purposes of the contract.
25.

There is no claim by the respondent no. 1 before me that the

machines being claimed by the petitioner were purchased by
respondent no. 2 out of the mobilization advance given by it.
It is therefore apparent that the petitioner did not own or have
access to the machinery which has been claimed by the petitioner as
belonging to it nor was the same utilised for carrying out the works at
the inception of the contract.
26.

My attention has been drawn to the averments made by the

petitioner and the respondent no.2 with regard to the ownership of
the machinery. In this behalf, it would be useful to read the relevant

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 24 of 37

portions of the writ petition against the respondent of NHAI
juxtaposed against each other:-

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 25 of 37

3. That the present Writ Petition
has been filed being aggrieved by
the illegal and arbitrary approach
adopted by the Respondent No. 1
i.e. without any authority or
assigning any reasons, the
respondent no. 1 seized the
machineries of the petitioner at
the petitioner's office premises
and who is stranger to the
contract.

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

2. That the contents of para 3 of
the
writ
petition
are
misconceived and in view o the
aforesaid
preliminary
submission, it is respectfully
submitted that the remedy for the
breach of contracts, the petitioner
is free to claim compensation
from Respondent no. 2 with
whom it had entered into a
contract.
The
answering
respondent did not have any
privity of contract with the
petitioner. The respondent no. 1
acted in accordance with the
contractual stipulations entered
into
between
itself
and
respondent no. 2. The petitioner
consequent upon the termination
of the contract vide letter dated
11.12.2004 became the owner of
all the plant and machinery and
other materials and temporary
and other works which were lying
at site. It is pertinent to mention
that no disclosure whatsoever
was made by either the petitioner
or respondent no. 2 about any
agreement whatsoever entered
into so as to mobilize the plant
and machinery in order to
execute the project for which
answering
respondent
had
entered into the contract with
respondent
no.
2.
The
respondent no. 2 in order to
cause wrongful loss and to gain
undue enrichment wrote a letter
dated 07.12.2004 received by the
page 26 of 37

Vehicles Act and requested the
respondent no. 1 to remove their
Security Guards before the end of
the day and give the physical
possession over his machineries.
A copy of the letter dt.
20.12.2004 submitted by the
petitioner to the respondent no. 1
is
annexed
herewith
as
Annexure P.6.
The copies of the List of
documents and corresponding
relevant Ownership Documents
namely, Purchase Invoices and
Ownership Papers under Motor
Vehicles
Act
are
annexed
herewith
as
ANNEXUREp.7(Colly).
27.

In the pleadings of respondent no. 1 there is therefore no denial

in law to the claim of the petitioner to the effect that it is the owner
entitled to these machines and equipment.

Even in the oral

submissions before me, the only assertion made was to the effect that
since the machinery was used for the purposes of the project and
hence would fall within the ambit of clause 61.1. To say the least,
such a submission is wholly misconceived in law and cannot be
accepted inasmuch as an agreement between the respondents cannot
bind the property of a person who is not a party to the same. The
findings of the court to this effect in OMP No. 342/2004 have been
W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 27 of 37

accepted by the respondent no. 1.
28.

At this stage it would also be appropriate to notice an order

passed by this court on the 11th May, 2005 which is in the following
terms :“Learned counsel appearing for respondent no. 2
prays for a short adjournment to enable him to file
the counter affidavit. Let the same be filed within
three days. Rejoinder, if any, may be filed before
the next date of hearing. Let this matter be listed
on 16th May, 2005.
It is submitted that the respondent no. 1
would be taking a final decision on the
representations of the petitioner within the next
two days. Let this decision be also brought to
court.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that he has only yesterday received advance copy of
the counter affidavit on behalf of respondent no. 1
which is yet to be filed on the court record. It is
pointed out that despite the categorical submission
of the petitioner to the effect that the seized
machines were located at the camp office of the
petitioner within its rented premises which is
located at a distance of around 200 mtrs from the
national highway, the respondent no. 1 has illegally
posted its security guards at such office who are
controlling the machinery within the premises of
the petitioner. It is submitted that this action is
wholly illegal and is resulting in an unwarranted
damage to the machinery and properties of the
petitioner. The petitioner is stated to be possessed
of all the necessary records relating to registration
of the machinery including invoices, insurance etc
and the respondents had not answered these
W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 28 of 37

categorical pleas in the counter affidavit.
Copy of the counter affidavit has been placed
before me which shows that the respondent no. 1
has merely stated that it has seized such plant and
machinery which was within the project or of the
stretch of the road of the 16.5 kms of the national
highway which was the subject matter of its
contract with the respondent no. 1. There is no
denial whatsoever to this specific plea that the
machinery is even on date lying within the office
precincts of the petitioner. Learned counsel is
unable to answer the query as to the jurisdiction of
the respondent no. 1 over the rented premises of
the petitioner. It is, however, admitted that as per
the provisions of the National Highway Authority
of India Act, the prescribed statutory limits of
jurisdiction of the respondent no. 1 are confined to
60 mtrs on either side of the median of the
national highway.
In this view of the matter, the respondent no.
1 is directed to place a specific reply to the issues
which have been raised in the writ petition noticed
in the order passed today.”
29.

In purported compliance of the directions made, the

respondent filed an affidavit dated 16th May, 2005. The questions
raised in the order passed by this court were answered thus :“7. That the particulars of the premises/site of
which possession had been taken by the answering
respondent, pursuant to the termination of the
contracts vide termination order dated 11.12.2004
are as follows :
a.
Nangli Punaon Km 19.500 located on
National Highway Authority of India land.
b.
Budhpur on Km 20.725 located on NHAI
W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 29 of 37

land on which material has been kept by
Respondent No. 2 and also the private land
arranged by Respondent no. 2, which is
abutting/touching the right of way on the National
Higway. In this respect it is pertinent to mention
that
the
private
land
on
which
the
machinery/equipment, used in the execution of the
contract/project have been kept by Respondent no.
2 of which possession has been taken over by the
answering respondent and which is alleged to be
under the control of the petitioner is
abutting/touching the right of way of National
Highway -1 and is within construction reach of the
project ie Km 16.500 to Km 29.300.
c.
Burari situated on private land arranged by
respondent no. 2 for parking of equipments used
for the execution of the contract at 7 Km away from
Km 21.00 of National Highway -1.
d.
Main Camp Rai situated on private land
arranged by respondent no. 2 for parking of
equipments, storage of materials and used as a site
office of respondent no. 2, situated 700 Mtr. Away
from Km 36.500 of National Highway-1.
e.
Kalimata Mandir situated on NHAI land
within right of way used for parking of equipments
at Km 59.400 of National Highway 1, by
Respondent No. 2.
f.
Navarangpur, Gurgaon situated on private
land arranged by respondent no. 2 for the
installation of crusher situated in Gurgaon
district.”
Therefore, there is clear and unequivocal deposition by the
respondent no. 1 that the machinery ownership whereof was claimed
by the present petitioner, was located on private land and which was
W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 30 of 37

not part of the project.
30.

It has been pointed out by Mr. M.N. Krishnamani, learned

senior counsel appearing for the petitioner, that in IA Nos. 973/2005
and 950/2005 filed in OMP No. 342/2004, the machinery was
found on the project site itself and yet the court held that the
National Highway Authority of India had no right over the same as
they have not been purchased out of the mobilisation advance
(reference para 30 of the judgment dated 4th April, 2005 supra).
It is urged that in the case of the petitioner, it has ownership
over the machines and the same were also not located at a site or
temporary office of the respondent no. 1 to which the deeming clause
61.1 could not apply.
31.

Before me there is no dispute that the machinery claimed by

the petitioner has not been purchased out of the mobilisation
advance given by the respondent no. 1 to respondent no. 2. There is
no despite that the machinery was not located on the project site.
There are therefore no disputed questions of fact raised in the
present petition which would require evidence for the purposes of
adjudication and render it improper for this court to entertain the

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 31 of 37

present petition.
32.

Identical terms in the contract contained in Clause 51 and 61.1

stand interpreted and finally adjudicated by the aforestated judgment
dated 4th April, 2005. The respondent is bound by the findings of the
court in identical facts and circumstances.
33.
it has

I see no reason to take a different view. For this reason as well
to be held that the respondent no. 1 can claim rights under

clause 61.1, if any, with regard to only such plant and machinery
which has been brought to the site by the second respondent by
purchasing the same out of the mobilisation advance received by it
from the respondent no. 1.
34.

So far as the objection raised by the respondent no. 1 to the

maintainability of the writ petition on the ground that the issues
raised are in the realm of contract and that the petitioner has
available an alternative efficacious remedy to it, it is settled law that
there is no absolute prohibition to the maintainability of a writ
petition on the ground of availability of an alternative remedy and
that the same is a rule of convenience and discretion. It has been
held by the Apex Court that a writ court may still exercise jurisdiction

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 32 of 37

even in matters arising out of contract in the event of three
contingencies :(i)

where the writ petition seeks enforcement of any of the

Fundamental Rights ;
(ii)

where there is failure of principles of natural justice or,

(iii) where the orders or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction
or the vires of an Act and is challenged.
Reference in this behalf may be made appropriately to the law
laid down by the Apex Court in the judgment reported at (1998) 7
SCC 11 entitled Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade marks,
Mumbai & Ors. and 2002 (9) SCALE 724 entitled Harbans Lal Sahnia
vs Indian Oil Corporation.

35.

In view of the adjudication in the earlier case, it has to be held

that the action of the respondent no. 1 in seizing the machines of the
petitioner is completely without authority of law and jurisdiction and
in these circumstances, there would be no bar to the maintainability
of a writ petition.

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 33 of 37

36.

In the instant case, there can be no manner of doubt that there

is no privity of contract whatsoever between the petitioner and the
respondent no. 1 and that the petitioner has no remedy by way of
arbitration available to it against the respondent no. 1. The objection
of the respondent no. 1 to this petition on the ground of availability of
an alternative remedy is therefore untenable and misconceived.
37.

There is no dispute that the present writ petition was filed and

listed prior to the filing of OMP No. 120/2005. The respondent no. 1
has not arrayed the present petitioner as a party to the same. I have
been taken through the copy of OMP NO. 120/2005 filed in these
proceedings. I find that there is not a whisper of an averment about
the present petitioner or this writ petition in the petition filed by
respondent no. 1. The machinery being
claimed by the petitioner is not mentioned anywhere.

It cannot

therefore be contended that the issues and rights being adjudicated
by this court are the subject matter of consideration on the original
side of this court in OMP No. 120/2005.
38.

In this background, the invocation of the jurisdiction of the

learned Single Judge on the original side of this court in OMP No.

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 34 of 37

120/2005 by the respondent no.1 after filing of the present writ
petition assumes significance. The respondent no. 1 did not disclose
the judgment dated 4th April, 2005 passed by the court in the petition
filed by it under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, and
no copy thereof was enclosed. On the contrary, the respondent no. 1
filed a copy of the ex-parte interim order dated 1st October, 2004
which stood vacated so far as the machineries of the third parties
were concerned vide the judgment dated 4th April, 2005.

The

respondent no. 1 was dutibound to have fairly disclosed the final
adjudication as well as the pendency of the present writ petition in
the proceedings (OMP No. 120/2005) filed by it and there has been
apparent concealment of material facts on its part so far as the rights
of third parties as the petitioner are concerned.
39.

It is been contended with all the vehemence at his command by

learned senior counsel for the respondent no. 1, that on
considerations of propriety, the petitioner requires to be relegated to
seeking his remedy by way of an application in OMP No. 120/2005. I
have already held that the subject matter of this writ petition is not in
issue in OMP NO. 120/2005. So far as propriety is concerned, in my

W.P.(C) 6065/2005

page 35 of 37

view such a plea does not lie in the mouth of the respondent no. 1
which is a statutory authority. It was already before this court in
these proceedings. Nothing prevented it from seeking a prohibitory
relief against the petitioner by merely filing an application in these
proceedings or making complete disclosure of the facts in its petition.
40.

So far as the other issues regarding the allegation of breaches

and claims of the respondents against each other and those of the
petitioner against the respondent(s) are concerned, it is made clear
that there is no adjudication thereon in the present proceedings and
the parties shall be at liberty to take such actions and remedies as
may be available to them in accordance with law.
This writ petition is accordingly allowed.
The respondent no. 1 is directed to remove its security guards
from the petitioner's office premises and release the machines of the
petitioner detailed in annexure P-7 to the writ petition which have
been seized by it.
The petitioner shall be entitled to costs which are quantified at
Rs.10,000/Dasti
