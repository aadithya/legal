S.N. AGGARWAL, J.
The plaintiff is none other than a practicing Advocate. He
proclaims himself to be a whistle blower. Is he really so? Let us
see.

The plaintiff has filed this suit against the defendants for

recovery of Rs.16,20,000/- as damages for the pain and insult
allegedly suffered by him in the incident that took place on
02.05.2003 in PCO booth located at New Lawyers' Chamber
Block, opposite to Supreme Court of India.
3

There are seven defendants in the case. Defendant No. 1

is the Registrar General (Court Administrator-cum-Secretary
General) of the Supreme Court, defendant No. 2 is the
Commissioner of Police, defendant No. 3 is the Secretary,
Ministry of Home Affairs, defendant No. 4 is the Chairman,
MTNL, defendant No. 5 is the Secretary of Ministry of
Telecommunication, defendant No. 6 Vishal Gupta is the owner
of PCO booth and defendant No. 7 Punit Khurana was an
employee of defendant No. 6 working in the PCO booth at the
time of incident on 02.05.2003. The plaintiff has claimed
damages of Rs.20 lacs against defendant No. 1, Rs. 20 lacs
against defendants No. 2 & 3, Rs. 20 lacs against defendants

CS(OS) No. 782/2006

Page2 of 16

No. 4 & 5 and Rs.20,000/- against defendants No. 6 & 7.

The genesis of the alleged cause of action against the

defendants in the present suit is the incident that took place
on 02.05.2003 in the PCO booth located at the New Lawyers'
Chamber Block opposite to

the Supreme Court of India.

According to the plaintiff, on 02.05.2003 he had gone to make
a phone call from the phone booth located in the New Lawyers'
Chamber Block opposite to Hon'ble Supreme Court on the
Bhagwan Das Road. He made a phone call from the PCO booth
to mobile No.9810270253 and after the phone was made,
defendant No. 7 who was present at the booth at that time
asked the plaintiff to pay Rs.6/- for the call which he had made.
This led to an altercation between the plaintiff and defendant
No. 7 and during altercation between them, defendant No. 7 is
alleged to had snatched a currency note of Rs.10/- from the
hand of the plaintiff and when plaintiff tried to take back
Rs.10/- currency note from defendant No. 7, defendant No. 7
allegedly slapped the plaintiff with his right hand on his left
cheek. This is the incident that had taken place with the
plaintiff in the PCO booth on 02.05.2003 for which the plaintiff
had got a criminal complaint registered against the owner of

CS(OS) No. 782/2006

Page3 of 16

the booth and his employee Punit Khurana (defendants No. 6 &
7) with the Police of Police Station Tilak Marg. The plaintiff
also made complaints regarding the alleged incident
of

02.05.2003

to

the

defendants

on

various

dates

between the date of said incident till filing of the
present suit filed on 02.05.2006 and insisted on them
to

terminate

the

license

of

defendant

No.6

for

running the telephone booth. The inquiry was held by
defendants No. 1 to 5 against the booth operator on
the basis of complaint received by them from the
plaintiff

regarding

the

alleged

incident.

During

inquiry, it was found by defendants No. 1 to 5 that
defendant No.6 has already removed defendant No.7 who
allegedly misbehaved with the plaintiff on the date of
incident.
5

The

license

to

run

the

telephone

booth

was

granted to defendant No.6 by the order of Hon'ble
Chief

Justice

of

India

and

the

license

deed

was

executed by the Registrar, Supreme Court, for and on
behalf of Hon'ble Chief Justice of India. Defendant
No.1

being

the

Administrator-cum-Secretary

General of the Supreme Court of India has already
warned

the

operator

(defendant

No.6)

to

be

careful in future so that the incident as allegedly
happened on 02.05.2003 do not take place in future.
The Police has also conducted investigation into the
complaint

regarding

the

incident

alleged

by

the

plaintiff with the Police of Police Station Tilak Marg
and after investigation filed a Closure Report before
the

concerned

Court

of

Metropolitan

Magistrate.

However, since the plaintiff was not satisfied with the
action taken on his complaint by the defendants, he
has filed the present suit for recovery of damages
against

them

for

non-performance

of

their

public

duties in accordance with law.

that

The plaintiff has alleged against the defendants
the

defendants No. 1

5 being

the

public

servants were under an obligation to terminate the
license of the booth operator on account of breach of
conditions of the license on his part and according
to the plaintiff since the defendants have failed to
terminate the license of the booth operator, they

CS(OS) No. 782/2006

Page5 of 16

have rendered themselves liable to pay damages to the
tune of Rs.60,20,000/- to him.
7

The defendants have resisted this suit on the

ground of its maintainability and they have filed
four

separate

applications

for

rejection

of

the

present suit under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC as disclosing
no

cause

of

I have heard the arguments of the plaintiff and

also of counsels for all the defendants on all these
applications and have also gone through the entire
record of the case. I have also gone through the
written submissions filed by the plaintiff.
9

All the counsels who have appeared on behalf of

the defendants had argued that the present suit is

CS(OS) No. 782/2006

Page6 of 16

liable to be rejected

because according to them it

does not disclose any cause of action against any of
the

defendants.

They

had

further

argued

that

the

present suit is also barred by limitation and cannot
be entertained by this Court. It was submitted on
behalf

of

filing

of

the
the

defendants
present

that

suit

the
is

limitation

governed

by

for
the

provisions of Articles 72 & 79 of the Limitation Act,
1963 according to which the suit could have been
filed by the plaintiff within a period of one year to
be reckoned from the date of incident. The contention
of the defendants was that since the incident had
taken place on 02.05.2003, the present suit filed by
the plaintiff on 02.05.2006 was beyond the period of
one year prescribed for filing of the said suit in
Articles 72 & 79 of the Limitation Act and therefore
they urged that the present suit should be dismissed
as barred by limitation.
10

On the other hand, the plaintiff who argued his

case in person had submitted that the cause of action
for filing of the present suit is continuous one and

CS(OS) No. 782/2006

Page7 of 16

in

the

alternative,

he

also

argued

that

when

limitation and cause of justice are pitted against
each other, then the limitation must pave way for
doing justice in the facts and circumstances of a
given case. The plaintiff, however, did not dispute the
applicability of the provisions of Articles 72 & 79
of the Limitation Act, 1963 referred and relied upon
by the defendants.
11

It shall be relevant to refer to the provisions

of Articles 72 & 79 of the Limitation Act, 1963 which
are extracted below:-

CS(OS) No. 782/2006

Page8 of 16

12

A plain reading of the above two Articles of the

Limitation Act would show that the law prescribes a
period

of

one

year

for

filing

a

suit

for

compensation/damages for distress and the said period
of one year prescribed by law is to be reckoned from
the

date

of

incident

giving

cause

for

alleged

distress.
13

The incident in the present case that gave rise

to alleged cause of action to the plaintiff had taken
place on 02.05.2003. The present suit for recovery of
damages/compensation

was

filed

by

the

plaintiff

on

02.05.2006 i.e after three years of the date of the
incident. This suit on the face of it is barred by
limitation.
cause

of

The

action

argument
is

of

the

continuous

plaintiff

cannot

be

that

the

accepted

because in case his said argument is accepted then a
litigant can file a suit at his whims and fancies may
be after 20 years, 50 years or even after 100 years.
The objective of law of limitation is to provide
certainty and peace in the society. The cause of
action alleged by the plaintiff against the defendants

CS(OS) No. 782/2006

Page9 of 16

is

non-performance

of

their

public

duties

in

not

terminating the license of the booth operator for the
alleged breach of terms of the license on his part.
It is beyond my comprehension how the plaintiff can
claim

damages/compensation

against

the

defendants

only because the license of the booth operator was
not terminated by them as desired by the plaintiff. The
cause, if any, for the plaintiff to have filed the
present

suit

could

only

be

distress

allegedly

suffered by him on account of alleged misbehavior by
the employee of the booth operator. The limitation
for suing in relation to such a cause is one year
from the date of distress which expired long ago
prior to filing of the present suit. The argument of
the plaintiff that the Court should prefer course of
justice

to

accepted

the

law

because

cannot
confer

be
any

discretion on the Court to condone the delay and
extend the limitation prescribed for filing a suit.
Section 5 of the Limitation Act does not apply to
suits.

Hence

the

suit

of

the

provisions

contained in Section 3 of the Limitation Act. Since
the present suit filed by the plaintiff against the
defendants

is

in

of

the

law

of

limitation, the said suit is liable to be rejected
under

Order

7

Rule

11

(d)

of

the

Code

of

Civil

Procedure, 1908.
14

Even if it is assumed that the suit filed by the

plaintiff against the defendants is within limitation,
still the said suit is liable to be rejected under
Order 7 Rule 11 CPC because it does not disclose any
cause of action against any of them.
15

Paras 26 to 29 of the plaint deals with the

cause of liability which is sought to be enforced by
the

plaintiff

against

the

defendants

in

the

present

suit and it will be relevant to refer to these paras
and the same are extracted below:“CAUSE OF LIABILITY
26. Defendant No.1:- That the license deed in
its Clause had specified that the licensee/
defendant No.6 will not employ any one as the
Telephone Operator or charge more than the rate
fixed by the Government or behave in any unruly
CS(OS) No. 782/2006

Page11 of 16

manner. The license deed also specified that the
Registry of the Hon'ble Supreme Court have the
right
to
terminate
the
agreement
without
assigning any reason. That the Registrar of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court had not acted in the
manner it was suppose to act, by not terminating
the license of defendant No.6, though the
defendant No.6
had gone against the clause of
the
license
by
employing
another
person/
defendant No.7; by charging more that what was
fixed rate of the call charge and plaintiff being
slapping by the defendant No.7. The plaintiff has
sent the letter to the Registrar on 19.08.2003
(nineteenth day of August two though three). The
Registrar had not taken any kind of appropriate
action on the demand notice where the plaintiff had
specifically written that the plaintiff is going to
sue for the damages. The said booth is still run
by the defendant No.6 in the same premises of the
New Lawyer's Chamber as on 01.05.2006 (first
date of May two thousand six) and nothing can by
more insulting than this for the plaintiff and for
the law abiding citizens of this nation and for
the rule of law that the law and rules failed to
take action against the defendant No.6 in the
very premises of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the
Sanctum Santorum of the justice. The defendant
No.1 is a paid servant of the Government and his
salary is paid by the Government which the
Government collect through the public and where
the public money involves the public interest
get involves and by not taking care of the
public interest is a civil wrong and also
criminal act of negligence.
27. Defendant No. 2 and Defendant No. 3:- That
the police department had not fulfilled their
duty cast under law as per the Section 154 (01)
or 154(03) of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 by
not registering the case on 02.05.2003 (second
day of May two thousand three); by filing the
wrong,
malicious,
perverted,
diabolic,
outrageous, outlandish, obnoxious and outrightly
third rate rotten Final report on 01.05.2005
(fifteenth day of November, two though four) in
the wrong Section of 382 of Indian Penal Code
1860, as in year 1866 it was decided by the
Hon'ble Court that the moment hurt is caused,
the Section 392 will apply, not the Section 382
CS(OS) No. 782/2006

Page12 of 16

of Indian Penal Code; by not mentioning the
Medical Report in the charge sheet filed by the
Investigation Officer on 28.05.2005 (twenty
eight day of May, two though five); by not
mentioning the source of information for the
allegation stated in the charge sheet that the
complainant/ plaintiff had spoken for more than two
minutes. The Police department is meant to
protect the general public and to punish the
wrong doer who goes against the law and for
doing same the Police personal are paid by the
Government which the Government collect through
the public and where the public money involves
the public interest get involves and by not
taking care of the public interest is a civil
wrong and also criminal act of negligence. The
defendant No.2 and defendant No.3 are the
responsible authority for the deed of their
department, the same department which failed to
give any solace to the plaintiff, though around
three year had over.
28. Defendant No.4 and defendant No.5:- By not
responding at all in any form or manner to the
plaintiff who sent the registered letter to
Assistant Vigilance Officer of MTNL in CGO
Complex, New Delhi on 19.08.2003 (nineteenth day
of August two thousand three) regarding the
whole incident and for the action to be taken
against the defendant No.6 as he is running the
telephone service of the MTNL and not only
overcharging in the very premises of the highest
temple
of
Justice
but
also
his
employee
manhandled the customer. The whole incident was
informed by the plaintiff earlier in two occasions
through the phone, one by making the mobile call
from the mobile of Mr. Deepak Sharma, Advocate,
Tis Hazari Courts (mobile No.9891144454) to the
Assistant Vigilance Officer of MTNL in CGO
Complex, New Delhi and once from the Phone booth
near the Tis Hazari Courts. The defendant No. 4
department had advertized also, by calling upon
the public to complain if public call booth
licensees
are
overcharging
and
on
their
direction the plaintiff sent the complaint. The
Telecom
department is meant to provide the
telecom service to the general public and for
same the public is charged with the service tax
and the same tax goes on to give the salary and
CS(OS) No. 782/2006

Page13 of 16

other amenities and perks to the department
personal, including the defendant No.4 and
defendant No.5. The defendant No.6 is still
running the phone booth at same premises of the
New Lawyer's Chamber as on 01.05.2006(first day
of May two thousand six).
29. Defendant No.6 and Defendant No.7:- The
defendant No.6 had given the undertaking in the
license deed with Registrar who signed it on
behalf of the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India
that he will not employ any one as employee and
not to charge more than what is that fixed rate.
The defendant No.6 acted in contravention of the
Deed and because of that the plaintiff got slapped.
The defendant No.7 is responsible for slapping
the plaintiff and asking for more charge.”

A meaningful reading of the plaint, particularly

paras

referred

above,

would

show

that

the

only

grievance raised by the plaintiff in the present suit
is non-cancellation of license of the booth operator

This

Court

obligation

is

of

the

statutory,

contractual or otherwise on the part of the licensor
or the authorities to terminate the license merely on
the asking of the plaintiff. It is within the absolute
jurisdiction and discretion of the licensor whether
to terminate the license or not, even in case of
breach of any term or condition of the license. In
case

the

licensor

CS(OS) No. 782/2006

is

satisfied

that

the

act

Page14 of 16

complained of does not warrant termination of the
license,

the

plaintiff

cannot

compel

termination

thereof. In view of the same, I am of the considered
view that the plaint does not disclose a clear right
to sue and no real cause of action has been set out
in the plaint or even disclosed against any of the
defendants. I am satisfied that this suit filed by
the

plaintiff

against

the

defendants

is

inspired

by

vexatious motives and is altogether groundless.
17

In view of the above facts, I have no hesitation

in holding that the plaintiff is making mountain out
of

a

molehill

by

blowing

the

incident

out

of

proportion. He who claims himself to be a whistleblower is in fact a black mailer. I say so for the
reason that he has dragged into this litigation such
authorities

like

the

Registrar

General

(Court

Administrator-cum-Secretary General), Supreme Court of India,
the Commissioner of Police, the Secretary, Ministry of Home
Affairs, the Chairman, MTNL & the Secretary, Ministry of
Telecommunication only with a view to sensualize the issue,
when as noticed by me above no cause of action arose against

CS(OS) No. 782/2006

Page15 of 16

them. I, therefore, deem it proper to nip this frivolous
and

vexatious

harassment

of

suit

in

protracted

the

bud

to

litigation

avoid

to

undue

them.

This

suit deserves to be dismissed with exemplary costs
looking into the conduct of the plaintiff that he
being an Advocate has misused the legal machinery
only to satisfy his personal egos.
18

In

view

of

the

above,

all

the

IAs

filed

on

behalf of the defendants for rejection of the present
suit are allowed and the present suit is dismissed
both on the ground of limitation and also for want of
cause of action under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC

with costs

quantified at Rs. 50,000/- to be deposited in the
Lawyers' Welfare Fund of Bar Council of Delhi.
