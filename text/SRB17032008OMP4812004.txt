2.

The Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Ltd, the petitioner here, and J.M. Baxi &
Co. the Respondent entered into two agreements dated 8th June, 1995 and
dated 26th June, 1995, pursuant to a Notice inviting Tender (NIT) and work
order for stevedoring, clearing, forwarding and handling of imported
fertilizers at Navalakhi and Paradeep ports for 1995-96. During the tenancy
of the above agreements/work orders, the Respondent handled five imported
urea vessels, namely “Nicolai Pogadin”, at Navalakhi port.

Similarly,

Respondent’s was appointed for handling of five vessels namely “Hiderby”,
“Maratha Deep”, “Jalatapi”, “Jagrahat” and “Rosaleen” at Paradeep port. The
parties referred certain disputes to arbitration, since they were to be decided
by an arbitration, in accordance with the stipulation in the contract.
3.

The petitioner alleged it suffered loss of Rs.3,84,22,355.29 including interest
up to 31.10.1999 mainly on account of short delivery, damaged cargo,
demurrage to the ships, cyclone damage, excess utilization of empty bags,
standardization loss, etc. due to improper handling at Navalakhi port.
Further, it claimed interest 20 per annum on the said amount from 1.11.1999
till payment. However, the Respondent’s statement was that in accordance
with the agreed terms and conditions, no amount was payable and also
denied that any interest was payable to the Claimant’s.

4.

The Respondent preferred a counter claim of Rs.55,81,088.75 with interest @

OMP No.481/2004

2 of 9

21% per annum from 10.5.2000 until payment/realization of the above
amounts. The interest on Rs.40000/00, which is the part of the counter claim
has also been claimed from 31.12.1996 until 10.5.2000.
5.

The relevant findings in the Award for the purposes of deciding the present
petition, are as follows :-

“Counter Claim of the Respondents-Counter Claimant (J.M.
Baxi)
Counter Claimants (J.M. Baxi) handled four vessels i.e. Hidirbey,
Jagraksha, Maratha Deep and Jalatapi of Paradeep port during the
contractual

period

and

raised

invoices

on

each

vessel

for

Rs.1,30,45,326.48, rs.96,99,687.25 Rs.1,25,01,837.36 and Rs.86,48,699.00,
aggregating to Rs.4,38,95,550.09.

As against this amount of

Rs.4,38,95,550.09, the Respondent’s (HFC) has paid a sum of
Rs.4,06,56,326.63 leaving a balance of Rs.32,39,223.45 towards
stevedoring charges to the Counter Claimant (J.M. Baxi).

The

Respondent’s in its statement of claim has admitted a sum of
Rs.13,07,012.09 is payable to the Counter claimant and that it is
withholding this amount because to adjust claims against the counter
claimant.

It according to the Respondent’s, only this amount of

Rs.13,07,012.09 was payable to the counter claimant and not
Rs.32,39,223.45, then it is for the Respondent’s (HFC) to produce
documents to prove that it has paid more money to the counter claimant
than what it acknowledged. In the circumstances, the entire amount of
OMP No.481/2004

3 of 9

Rs.32,39,223.45 is due and payable to the counter claimant.
The Respondent’s (HFC) in his reply to the counter claim however
denied that they have to pay Rs.32,39,223.45 to the counter claimant but
net, amount of only Rs.12,19,873.13 is payable to the counter claimant.
According to the Respondents, against the bills of counter claimant, they
paid an advance of Rs.10 lakhs for four vessels handled at Paradeep Port.
Thus, the Respondent has to pay to the counter claimant the balance sum
of Rs.2,19,873.13,.

The Respondent also recovered further TDS of

Rs.23000.00 from their bills in respect of four vessels in question handled
at Paradeep port totaling to Rs.9,65,519.00. The amount payable to the
counter claimant as stated above has been withheld by the Respondent’s
to recover demurrage charges of Rs.30,28,996.00 as levied and recovered
by the Department of Fertilizers towards pre-berthing demurrage
charges on M.V. Rosaleen from the Respondent. Thus, after adjustment of
Rs.2,19,873.13 of the counter claimant has to pay sum of Rs.28,09,122.87
to the Respondent (HFC) with interest @ 20% per annum amounting to
Rs.16,99,870.00 till July, 2001 and further pendent lit interest.

Findings

The Respondent (HFC) in their Statement of Claim dated
10.12.1999 has admitted that a sum of Rs.13,07,012.09 is due to the
counter claimant . Further, against this it has been claimed on amount
of Rs.10 lakhs as on advance as there was no pleading to this effect in the
OMP No.481/2004

4 of 9

Statement of Claim. Thus, the admitted claim, of the counter claimant of
Rs.23,94,141.39 against their claim of Rs.32,39,223.45, have been
awarded in favour of the counter claimant.”

6.

In the present petition the Objector, M/s Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation
Ltd. challenges the Award mainly on two grounds; the first is a mistake in
relation to calculation.

It is claimed that instead of the sum of

Rs.68,99,080.60 the Arbitrator wrongly awarded the sum of Rs.68,90,073.60.
The Petitioner is thus entitled to Rs.9007.00.

7.

The main ground for challenge, however, is that the Arbitrator committed a
fundamental error in rejecting the Petitioner’s plea about its having paid
Rs.10 lakhs as advance, while dealing with the Respondents counter claim. It
is averred by Petitioner and urged on behalf of Sh. Sanjay Poddar that the
respondent had admitted to payment of Rs.10 lakhs with a tax deduction of
Rs.23,000/- on 15.10.1996. According to counsel in spite of this admission
the Arbitrator awarded Rs.23,94,141.39 which has no factual foundation.
Counsel contended that the Arbitrator recorded about an admission by the
Petitioner that the sum of Rs.13,07,012.09 was due and later its changed
stand in the counter claim that actually a net amount of Rs.12,98,873.13 was

OMP No.481/2004

5 of 9

payable to the Respondent against which a set up of Rs.10 lakhs was further
sought.

Thus the admission was only to the extent of Rs.2,19,873.13.

However, the arbitrator awarded Rs.23,94,141.39 which is not supported by
any reasons or founded on any material on the record.

8.

It was urged on behalf of the Respondent, on the basis of the materials, the
pleadings as well as the counter claim that according to the calculations
placed before the Arbitrator, the total

billing was to the extent of

Rs.4,38,95,550.10 against which the sum of Rs.3,96,79,326.63 was admittedly
paid. The balance payable was Rs.42,16,223.45. The Respondent adjusted an
ad-hoc payment received on 24.9.1996 to the extent of Rs.9,77,000/- and was
thus entitled to Rs.32,39,223.45. After adding other miscellaneous charges
and the value of bank guarantee wrongly encashed, the earnest money
wrongly retained, the total claim made was Rs.52,30,875.20.
9.

Counsel contended that the Arbitrator, apparently only basis of the
Petitioner’s representation further adjusted a sum of Rs.9 lakhs and odd from
the amount of Rs.32,39,223.45 to award Rs. Rs.23,94,141.39. This discloses
that the Respondent is actually aggrieved in that regard. Counsel submitted
that on an overall conspectus of the facts there is enough material to justify
the award to the extent of Rs.23,94,141.39 and that mere not furnishing of

OMP No.481/2004

6 of 9

reasons does not amount to a fundamental error that would warrant an
interference with it.
10.

It is apparent from the above factual narration that the real dispute between
the parties relates to the sum of Rs.23,94,141.39 awarded against the
Petitioner, on the Respondents’ counter claim. The above extracts of the
Award in that regard would show that the Arbitrator recorded the
contentions of the respective parties in detail about the various sums due.
The Arbitrator also noticed that the Petitioner had recovered TDS to the tune
of Rs.23,000/- from the bills in respect of the four vessels. He even noticed
the offer of adjustment of Rs.2,19,873.19 of the respondent counter claimant
which agreed to accept Rs.28,09,122.87.

However, in the findings, the

Arbitrator after noticing the Petitioner’s initial admission on 10.12.1999 that
the Respondent was entitled to Rs.13,07,012.09, and later reducing that
amount

on

30.8.2001

to

Rs.12,19,873.13,

proceeded

to

award

Rs.23,94,141.39. There is no reason in support of this finding or award.
11.

Section 31(3) of the Act mandates that the arbitrator has to furnish reasons
for his findings, in the award, unless the parties to the arbitration agreement,
contract otherwise. In the present case, the arbitration clause contained in
the agreement between the parties was as follows :

OMP No.481/2004

7 of 9

"(31)(3) The arbitral award shall state the reasons upon
which it is based, unless-(a)
(b)

12.

the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be
given, or
the award is an arbitral award on agreed terms
under section 30."

One of the grounds for a public policy challenge, under Section 34, by the
Supreme Court, in the decision reported as ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes, 2003(5) SCC
705 is non-disclosure of reasons in the award. The Court had in the said
judgment, outlined four grounds for successful challenge to an award. The
Court further held (Paras 26 and 28 of the judgment, SCC reports) that not
furnishing reasons would also be a valid ground for setting aside the award.

13.

In this case, as noticed earlier, no reasons are forthcoming as to why the sum
of Rs.23,94,141.39 has been awarded or why the respondents' admission for
Rs.2,19,873.17 is unacceptable. In the circumstances, the findings and award
on the counter claim are unsustainable.

14.

For the above reasons, the Petition has to succeed. In the judgment reported
as Mc Dermott Interna tional Vs. Burn Standard Co.Ltd., 2006(11) SCC 181,
(Para 52) it was hled the Court, under Section 34, can only set aside an award;
it cannot remit the matter for fresh proceedings. The parties will have to seek
recourse to arbitration on the portion, set aside in accordance with the

OMP No.481/2004

8 of 9

arbitration agreement.
15.

The Petition, therefore, is partly allowed; the award, to the extent it allows the
counter claim for the sum of Rs.23,94,141.39 is hereby set aside. No costs.
