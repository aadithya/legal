2.

To be referred to the Reporter or not? Y

3.
:

Whether judgment should be reported in Digest? Y
PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Mr.Ansari seeks an adjournment which is opposed by

counsel for the respondent on the ground that a public street has
been encroached upon. Thus adjournment has been denied.
2.

The appellant has suffered 2 concurrent findings

against him.
3.

Appellant had filed a suit for permanent injunction

claiming to be owner in possession of shop No.3 in Khasra
No.290-293, Lal Kuan, Badarpur, Delhi.

He stated that the

earstwhile owner inducted him as a tenant but later on sold the
page 1 of 5

shop to him. He claimed that he purchased the property under
general power of attorney, will and an agreement to sell.

He

stated that MCD had no authority to dispossess him from the site.
4.

In the written statement filed it was stated that the

shop in question was an encroachment on a public street. That
neither the plaintiff nor anyone else had a right over the public
street.
5.

On the pleadings of parties following issues were

framed :(i)

Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of
permanent injunction as prayed for?

(ii)

Whether the plaintiff has no locus standi to file the
suit?

(iii) Whether the plaintiff has not come to court with
clean hands and has concealed the material facts?
(iv) Relief.
6.

Needless to state, all issues had to be decided with

reference to the central point whether plaintiff owned the shop
and the land comprised thereunder.
7.

On 25.5.2007 following substantial question of law was

framed :
“Whether the appellant who is
having valid
registered sale deed can be thrown out from the
premises in dispute?”
8.

When he stepped in the witness box appellant proved

the photocopies of the following documents :page 2 of 5

i)

A general power of attorney executed by Raj Kumar
Khurana, Anil Kumar, Jasvinder Kumar, Subhash Chand
and Rajesh Kumar.

The same has been exhibited as

PW-1/1.
ii)

An affidavit deposed to by the said persons. Same has
been exhibited as PW-2/2.

Iii)

A receipt issued by same persons. Photocopy of the
receipt has been exhibited as PW-3/3.

iv)

Agreement to sell executed by said persons.

Same

has been exhibited as PW-1/4.
v)

Copy of a joint will executed by said persons. Same
has been exhibited as PW-1/5.

8.

Additionally

a

certified

copy

of

the

sale

deed

purportedly in favour of previous owner has been proved as
Ex.PW-1/6.
9.

Suffice would it be to note that the general power of

attorney Ex.PW-1/1 is not a registered document. Similarly none
of the other proved documents save and except Ex.PW-1/6 are
registered.
10.

I note that the originals were not produced.

11.

Be that as it may, treating the documents to be duly

proved, question which arises for consideration is whether the
chain of title is complete.
page 3 of 5

12.

The shop in question is stated in the plaint to be on

land comprised in Khasra No.290-293, Lal Kuan, Badarpur.
13.

Revenue record to evidence title to the agricultural

land on which shop was constructed was not summoned by the
plaintiff.

No title document of the previous sellers has been

produced i.e. title of the executants of PW-1/6 has also not been
brought on record.
14.

The road in question is Badarpur Mehrauli road.

15.

Encroachment on public land and public streets is

rampant all over the city of Delhi.
16.

To succeed, appellant had to prove the complete chain

of title in respect of the land. A solitary sale deed is neither here
not there.
17.

I note that the question of law framed was with

reference to a statement made by counsel for the appellant that
the appellant was the registered owner of the property vide
registered sale deed proved as Ex.PW-1/6.
18.

This statement is wrong.

Ex.PW-1/6 is the certified

copy of the sale deed in favour of the so called previous owners.
19.

Learned counsel for the appellant states that the issue

of title has not to be gone into. Counsel urges that so long the
appellant proved settled position, the appellant was entitled to
the relief of injunction.

Counsel states that at best respondent
page 4 of 5

could evict the appellant by following due process of law.
20.

For encroachers of public street no process of law is

prescribed. Encroachers of public street are not entitled to any
statutory notices to be served to be evicted.
21.

The appeal is dismissed.

22.

LCR be returned forthwith.

23.
