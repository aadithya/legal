V.B. GUPTA, J.
The present petition has been filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
vide which the petitioners have challenged the summoning order
dated 14th August, 2003 passed by the learned Matropolitan
Magistrate, in complaint case No.315/1/03 (Manish Industries vs.
Hindustan Cables Limited and Others) under Section 138/141 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act (for short as „Act‟) and also for setting
aside the order dated 24th August, 2004 passed by the learned
Magistrate rejecting the prayer and application of the petitioners for
dropping the proceedings and also for setting aside of the order
dated 19th January, 2005 passed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, dismissing the Criminal Revision Petition filed by the
petitioners.
2.

Brief facts of this case are that Petitioner Company, M/S.

Hindustan Cables Ltd., Calcutta (for short as HCL) is a Govt.
Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 4 of 19

company. Petitioner Company issued a cheque in favour of the
Respondent No.2 towards the supply of goods on 20.4.02. At the
request of Respondent No.2, the aforesaid cheque was revalidated
on 19.10.02 for six months. At the request and insistence of the
Respondent No.2, the aforesaid cheque was once again revalidated
on 18.4.03, subject to the condition that the same will be presented
after confirmation from Petitioner Company. When the aforesaid
cheque was presented for payment, the same was dishonoured by
the banker of the petitioner on the ground of “exceeds arrangement”
in the account of the petitioner and the same was communicated to
the Respondent No.2 by their banker on 29.5.03. Then Respondent
No.2 sent statutory legal notice under Section 138 read with Section
141 of the Act to the petitioner company informing about the
dishonour of the cheque in question and demanding payment of the
amount covered by the cheque within fifteen days from the date of
receipt of the said notice.

Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

3.

In response to the aforesaid statutory legal notice, petitioner

company replied that the respondent no.2 suppressed the material
fact that the cheque was issued subject to the condition that same
would be presented after getting confirmation from HCL and BIFR
had declared petitioner company as sick unit vide order dated
21.3.2003 and hence if the Respondent No.2 would proceed further,
he would do so at his own cost risk.
4.

Respondent no. 2, thereafter filed the complaint u/ss. 138/

141 of the Act read with Ss.420/120B I.P.C. against the HCL and 13
others in the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi. The
Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and issued summons
against the accused persons.
5.

The Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate vide order dated 24.8.2004

held that the accused is a company incorporated under the
Companies Act and the accused no.2 to 5 were public servants
within the meaning of Sec. 21 of the Indian Penal Code, their

Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 6 of 19

prosecution was not maintainable without the written sanction as
required u/s.197, Cr.P.C. Thus, the Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate
dropped the proceedings against accused no.2 to 5 for want of
sanction. However, he rejected the application in respect of the
remaining accused persons (Petitioners) and directed them to
appear in person on the next date of hearing on 27.10.04.
6.

Aggrieved thereby the Petitioners filed a Revision Petition

before the Sessions Judge. The Ld. Additional Sessions Judge
observed that in view of the judgment passed by the Supreme Court
in Adalat Prasad v. Rooplal Jindal & Others, 113 (2004) DLT 356
(SC) and Subramanium Sethuraman v. State of Maharashtra &
Another, 2004 (4) Crimes 78 (SC), the only course of action available
to the accused/petitioners by way of filing a Petition u/s.482, Cr.P.C
before this Court against the order of the Ld. Metropolitan
Magistrate relating to the summoning order. Accused persons have
got no right to ask recalling of the summoning order either
directly/indirectly by way of filing the Revision Petition; hence,
Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 7 of 19

dismissed the said Revision Petition being not maintainable in the
eyes of law, without entering into the merits of the case.
7.

On 21.4.05, the Petitioners filed the petition u/s.482 before this

Court and the Court vide order dated 25.4.05 directed stay of the
further proceedings in the Trial Court. The aforesaid petition was
disposed off by this Court with liberty granted to the Petitioners to
file fresh petition to challenge the summoning order to face trial for
the offence u/ss.138/141 of the Act within 3 weeks challenging the
summoning order dated 14.8.03 and granted stay of further
proceedings.
8.

Hence, the petitioners have filed the present petition

u/s.482,Cr.P.C before this Court.
9.

The Petitioner Company seek quashing of the complaint filed

u/s.138 of the Act on the ground that since the offending company
has been declared sick by the BIFR, no steps could be taken by the
respondent no.2 (complainant) for realization of the amounts said to
Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 8 of 19

be due to them and therefore the criminal proceedings initiated
against the petitioner company and its directors on the allegation
that the cheque drawn in favour of the respondent no.2 was
dishonoured by the bank is misconceived and should be quashed.
Reliance has been placed on Sections 22 and 22A of SICA.
10.

The main thrust of the arguments of the Ld. Counsel for the

Petitioner Company is that the Petitioner Company is a govt.
company. Directors and Person-in-Charge are responsible only for
day-to-day affairs. There is no material gain to connect the
petitioners with the alleged offence.
11.

Further, on 21.3.03, the BIFR had declared the petitioner

company as a “Sick Industrial Company” in terms of Section 3 (1)(o)
of the SICA and the company/ promoters were restrained u/s. 22A
of SICA not to dispose of any fixed or current assets without the
consent of the secured creditors and the BIFR. Because of the said

Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 9 of 19

restraint order passed by the BIFR, Petitioner Company had no
authority to entertain the claim made by respondent no.2.
Moreover, when the cheque was drawn, the restraint order was in
force. Hence the instant criminal proceeding against the petitioners
is not maintainable. Reference is made regarding the judgment of
Supreme Court in Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd. v. Pennar Peterson
Securities Ltd. (2000) 2 SCC 745.
12.

It is also contended that in view of the written undertaking,

the Respondent No.2 had no authority to present the said cheque in
the bank for encashment and the said written undertaking by the
respondent no.2 amounts to an agreement and failure or refusal to
abide by the stipulations contained in the said written undertaking
amounts to a breach/violation which has rendered the said cheque
an invalid instrument in the eyes of law.
13.

In view of decision in Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd. case

(supra), if before the date on which the cheque was drawn on or

Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 10 of 19

before expiry of the statutory period of 15 days after notice, restraint
order passed by the BIFR u/s.22A then it cannot be said that the
offence was completed. In such case, dishonouring of the cheque by
the

bank

and

failure

to

make

payment

by

the

company/management is for reason beyond the control of the
petitioners as the cheque amount due to respondent no.2 is not
recoverable from the assets in view of the ban orders. Therefore, it
would be unfair and unjust and against the intent and purpose of
the statute to hold that the directors should be compelled to face trial
in a criminal case.
14.

Thus, by presenting the said cheque in the bank for

encashment

without

obtaining

the consent of the petitioner

company, the respondent no.2 acted illegally in utter violation of the
condition of the agreement entered between him and the petitioner
company. Hence it did not give rise to any cause of action to
institute a prosecution against the petitioner company and its
director or executive Director in accordance with law.
Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 11 of 19

15.

The Ld. Counsel for the Respondent No. 2 on the other hand

contends that on 21.3.03 the order was passed by the BIFR which
finds mention of the reference made earlier by petitioners based on
balance sheet as on 31.3.01 and the same was rejected as time barred
on 26.7.02 and despite that they placed an order with the respondent
no.2 for supply of goods by concealing these facts from the
respondent no.2.
16.

It is further stated that the cheque were issued on 20.4.02

which was revalidated on 19.10.02 and lastly on 18.4.03. Again these
facts were concealed by the petitioner company from the respondent
no.2.
17.

It is further contended that the BIFR passed directions to the

petitioner company to make the payments for the running of the
day-to-day business of the petitioner company.

Therefore, a

complete restraint was not placed upon the petitioner company for
making the payment. The petitioner company is a running company

Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 12 of 19

and the raw material was supplied by the respondent no.2 for the
running of the day-to-day business of the company. The cheque in
question was issued by the petitioners for liability which is legally
enforceable liability and was not issued for any loan and therefore,
Sec.22A of the SICA is not applicable in the facts and circumstances
of the case.
18.

The petitioners have deliberately concealed the material facts

that the operation of the bank accounts of the petitioner company
has not been restrained by any order of BIFR. Other payments were
made by petitioner company to Respondent no.2 and M/s. Shakun
Polymers Ltd., shows that there was no restraint order by BIFR for
payment of their liability to the customers/suppliers for day-to-day
business.
19.

Section 22A of SICA, does not bar the criminal prosecution

and payment of legally enforceable dues.

Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 13 of 19

20.

Even if the said order of BIFR was passed on 21.3.03, it was

not in accordance with law as it apparent from the said order that
there was no scheme u/s.18 during the period of preparation of
consideration or during the period beginning with the recording of
opinion by the board or for winding up that the board under Section
20(1) and up to the commencement of the proceedings relating to the
winding up before the High Court concerned, in the absence of both
the conditions, the order under section22A of SICA is not in
accordance with law.
21.

The judgment in Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd. v. Pennar

Peterson Securities Ltd. (2000) 2 SCC 745, is not applicable in the
facts and circumstances of the case as much as the Supreme Court
has laid down that if the company is sick and a restraint order has
been passed by the BIFR, it would be open to the aggrieved party to
place relevant material in this regard before Ld. Magistrate before
whom the case is pending and the said Magistrate will examine the
matter.
Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 14 of 19

22.

The offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments

Act stood completed when there was a default and non-payment
subsequent to the receipt of the statutory legal notice under section
138. It is the admitted case of both the parties that the amount is
payable but the contention raised by petitioner company in its
defence is that company is not in a position to pay.
23.

As regards the argument that the petitioner company has been

declared sick by the BIFR and the company/ promoters were
restrained u/s. 22A of SICA not to dispose of any fixed or current
assets without the consent of the secured creditors and the BIFR, the
facts of the present case show that despite that restraint order, the
BIFR passed directions to the petitioner company to make the
payments for the running of the day-to-day business of the
petitioner company. The payment made by the petitioner company
to the Respondent No.2 and M/s Shakun Polymers Ltd. also
establish that there was no restraint order passed against the
petitioner company by BIFR barring the payment of its liability to its
Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 15 of 19

customers/suppliers for the running of day-today business. In the
explanation to the section clarification is made that the phrase “debt
or other liability” means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.
24.

Further, the petitioner company had taken a written

undertaking from the respondent no.2 that the cheque in question
would not be presented for encashment in the bank without the
consent of the petitioner company yet the revalidation letter has
concealed about the restraint order made by the BIFR. Furthermore,
there is no dispute that the present cheque was with respect to
supply of the goods on 13.2.02, i.e. subsequent to the reference made
by the petitioner company to the BIFR. These transactions were not
restrained by BIFR.
25.

In these facts and circumstances, the purported undertaking

was voidable under section 19 of Indian Contract Act since there
was concealment of facts on the part of the petitioner company.
Keeping in mind the above discussions, the matter in dispute is a

Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 16 of 19

triable issue and can only be decided after placing the evidence
before the Trial Court and the complaint cannot be quashed under
section 482, Cr.P.C.
26.

As observed by the Supreme Court in Kusum Ingots & Alloys

Ltd. v. Pennar Peterson Securities Ltd. (2000) 2 SCC 745, if the
company is sick and a restraint order has been passed by the BIFR, it
would be open to the aggrieved party to place relevant material in
this regard before Ld. Magistrate before whom the case is pending
and the said Magistrate will examine the matter. Analyzing the
scope and ambit of the provisions of Sections 22 and 22A of the
SICA, their Lordships have held that Section 22 of the SICA does not
create any legal impediment for instituting and proceeding with the
criminal case on the allegations of an offence u/s. 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act against a company or its director.
However, Apex Court observed that it will depend on the facts and
circumstances of the case whether in such circumstances the
proceedings could be initiated or not.
Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 17 of 19

27.

Therefore, no exception can be taken against the order of the

Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence u/s. 138, against the
Petitioners.

Undisputedly the cheques were drawn by the

petitioners for payment of certain amount of money due to
respondent no.2, from the account in the Bank and the said cheque
was dishonored by the Bank and the amount remained unpaid even
after lapse of 15 days from the date of notice issued by respondent
no.2 after the cheque was dishonored. Therefore, the ingredients of
Sec.138 of the Act being prima facie, established from the complaint
and the documents filed it with, the Magistrate rightly took
cognizance of the offence and issued summons to the petitioners.
28.

A question as to whether a magistrate after issuing process

could recall it. It is now settled in Adalat Prasad v. Rooplal Jindal
(supra), that he cannot recall the process. The Supreme Court in
Subramanium Sethuraman v. State of Maharashtra (supra), held
that the only course available to an aggrieved person to challenge

Crl.M.C.No.3633/2007

Page 18 of 19

the issuance of process under S.204 is by way of a petition under
S.482 Cr.P.C.
29.

So, in view of the above discussion it is held that present

petition is not maintainable and the same is accordingly dismissed.
