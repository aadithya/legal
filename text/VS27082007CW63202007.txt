1.
The petitioner was appointed as Steno-Typist in the
Office of Sales Tax on 29.11.1965. Thereafter, in the year 1969
he joined the office of District and Sessions Judge, Delhi as

WPC6320.07

page 1 of 4

Stenographer.

In this capacity, petitioner worked till 3.10.1979

whereafter, he resigned from the services and enrolled himself as
an Advocate with the Bar Council of Delhi.

Since then he is a

practicing lawyer. Petitioner thus worked first in Sales Tax Office,
attached to Government of NCT, Delhi for few months and
thereafter for about 10 years with District and Sessions Judge,
Delhi.
2.

Normally, with this 10 years' service, petitioner is not

entitled to any pension. However, he made a request for grant of
prorata pension on the ground that after leaving the Government
job he started his own practice as a lawyer which is in “public
interest” and therefore he is entitled to prorata pension. For this
submission, he relies upon OM dated 3rd January, 1995 issued by
Government of India, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances &
Pensions (Department of Pension and Pensioners Welfare). The
said OM, which was issued pursuant to the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the Case of T.S. Thiruvengadam vs.
Secretary to Government of India (1993) 2 SCC 174 entitles a
Government Servant to get prorata pension on such Government
servant being absorbed in the Central Public Sector Undertaking,
where such an absorption is in public interest. Therefore, as per
WPC6320.07

page 2 of 4

this office memorandum 2 conditions are to be satisfied, namely,
1) the concerned employee is absorbed in the Central Public
Sector Undertaking & 2) such a absorption is treated as one in
“Public Interest”.
3.

In the present case neither of the 2 conditions are

satisfied.

Petitioner, did not join any Central Public Sector

Undertaking and instead started his own private practice as an
advocate. Thus, it is the private profession which the petitioner
undertook as his vocation.

The concept of “Public Interest” is

contextual and is to be seen in the facts of a specific case. In the
context of office memorandum dated 3rd January, 1995 it would
have

relevance

Undertaking

and

only
thus

when
the

a

person

question

joins
that

Public
would

Sector
call

for

consideration is whether such an absorption in Public Sector
Undertaking is in public Interest or not.

It would not apply to

those who started there own profession or business after leaving
the Government job.
4.

Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

experience of the petitioner at the Bar should be counted as
service rendered in public Interest and on counting of this
experience he would be entitled to pension.
WPC6320.07

This is a totally

misconceived contention on behalf of the learned counsel for the
petitioner.
5.

We do not find any merit in this petition which is

accordingly dismissed.
