% Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat :
1. These proceedings seek review of the judgment and order of this Court dated 9.5.2005.
2. The writ petitioner had challenged a demand issued by the DDA (hereinafter “DDA”)
on 20.11.2002 and also sought for directions to restore his lease-hold rights and
convert them into freehold. He had purchased a 375 sq.mtr. plot (hereafter called the
“property”) on perpetual lease hold basis. The lease deed was executed on 30.1.1979.
He completed construction on the plot an occupation certificate was issued on
20.12.1986. According to his case a portion of the premises being basement was let

out on 9.3.1990. The purposes of tenancy was storage of finished furniture; the
duration of the arrangement was 17 months. It was alleged that the tenant misused the
premises.

The writ petitioner terminated the arrangement and filed a suit for

possession in this Court, in 1992. He also took further action and disconnected
electricity supply to the premises on 23.7.1993. Apparently, the writ petitioner had
intimated the DDA and the Zonal Assistant Commissioner which led to filing of
complaint under Section 29(2) of the Delhi Development Act. That alleged
commission of the offence, on 9.11.1992. The tenant i.e T.H. Naqvi was convicted on
26.4.1996. After a great deal of effort the writ petitioner/lessee obtained possession of
the premises on 20.4.2000. He also faced further proceedings by the tenant, who filed
an injunction suit impleading him as the defendant.
3. After all the events the writ petitioner sought for conversion of the property into
freehold when he was informed that the lease had been cancelled. The DDA expressed
willingness to restore the lease upon payment by him of the sum of Rs.27,000/-. After
payment of the restoration charges, on 1st May, 2001, the DDA demanded “misuse”
charges, for the sum of Rs.15,87,480/-. Despite his entreaties, the DDA insisted that
the amount ought to be paid as a condition for conversion of the property. That action
was impugned.
4. The DDA filed a counter affidavit to the writ petition on 19.8.2003. It did not dispute
or specifically deny the case set up by the petitioner about filing of proceedings by
him, to evict his tenant as well as other legal proceedings in that connection. It also
admitted that at the writ petitioner's request the Enforcements Branch of DDA had
RA294/05 & CM13132/05

2 of 6

lodged a complaint, under Section 29(2) of the Delhi Development Act which
culminated for the conviction of the tenant, (who was found to have misused the
premises), on 24.6.1996. It did not disclose as to the existence of any other document
or advert to any circumstance which preceded the misuse alleged against the property
in 1991-92.
5. The review petition is premised mainly on the ground that when the writ petition was
heard, the DDA went unrepresented and could not present its point of view. Besides
applying for condonation of delay of 111 days in filing the review, the DDA has
placed reliance on copies of notices dated 20.10.1986, 6.4.1987, 12.4.1989 and
11.11.1991 to submit that the premises were misused even before the incident in
question.
6.

Ms. Sangeeta Chandra, learned counsel relied upon the notices and particularly the
one dated 20.10.1986 to submit that for this five years period, the petitioner was guilty
of misusing the premises and not disclose the facts to the Court. Learned counsel
contended that omission to bring these facts to the notice of the Court at the time of
hearing, occasioned prejudice and failure to justice and, therefore, the Court should
review the order and hear the petition again on merits.

7. The writ petitioner denied the allegations in the review petition. The review petition
was resisted on the ground of delay. It was contended that the review petition has
sought to introduce the materials which were not only untrue but were never part of the
record and in any case could have been included in the counter affidavit. The DDA
consciously decided to refrain from adverting to those facts. Therefore, inclusion of
RA294/05 & CM13132/05

such facts is not permissible. It was also contended that the entire case about the show
cause notices alleging misuse was untrue. According to the writ petitioner the show
cause notice dated 20.10.1986 regarding use of the basement for a venture called “Fun
and Frolic” was discontinued, even before end of the notice period. The garage in
question had been used for storing some goods of the petitioner's relative and that such
use had been discontinued immediately. It was contended that the terms of tenancy
with Mr. T.H. Naqvi were a matter of record and contained in an agreement dated
9.3.1990.

The premises were misused by that tenant.

This caused considerable

hardship to the writ petitioner who had to fight for about a decade to evict that tenant.
Instead of seeing these facts, the DDA was trying to inject life into issues that had been
discarded long ago and in any case were not relevant.
8. This Court in the judgment proceeded to hold as follows :
“7. In support of the averments, the petitioner has
relied upon copies of the complaints written to the DDA
and the police intimating them about unauthorized use of
the premises and seeking action; the complaints also rely
on copies of the order in the injunction suit and the
orders passed in the eviction proceedings etc.
8.
The DDA in its reply has not disputed the facts
relating to the history of the proceedings eventually
culminating in the vacation of premises after the tenant
had been prosecuted and found guilty. It has, however,
stated that since there was misuse, the petitioner had to
pay the charges. The representation of the petitioner for
waiver of those charges was declined and it is averred
that the petitioner was requested to deposit the amounts.
9.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
impugned demand by the DDA is arbitrary and
unreasonable. He states that no fault could be attributed
RA294/05 & CM13132/05

4 of 6

to the petitioner. He merely let out the premises, via
basement, for storage purposes, which was permissible.
He has relied upon conditions in the rent agreement,
which stipulated that the tenancy was to cease if the
DDA or any other authority commenced any action
against the tenant. A condition in the tenancy agreement
was that vacant possession had to hand over possession
upon the expiration of its term. His tenant however
misused the property by using it as a shop. The
petitioner had to spend considerable effort, and fight
three litigations with the tenant. Ultimately, he secured
vacant possession after being forced to settle with the
tenant. The DDA itself prosecuted the tenant, which
resulted in conviction. It was never the case of DDA that
the petitioner was culpable or guilty of misuse. In the
light of these facts, it is submitted, that the DDA's action
is unreasonable. Hence, it could not claim that the
petitioner was guilty of misuse and raise astronomical
demands as misuse charges.”
9.

The above discussion would show that the writ petition was disposed of on the basis
of rival pleadings as is evident from the above discussion as also from Paras 11 to 13
of the judgment sought to be reviewed. The DDA had not mentioned anything about
misuse prior to the period 1991-1992 by the writ petitioner. That might have been on
the basis of a conscious decision not to do so or it may be by inadvertence. Whatever
be the reason, the DDA had the relevant materials (which it bases for re-opening of the
decision of the Court), with it when the counter affidavit was filed. Having elected not
to use it, in my opinion it is not open for me to rely upon those documents. In any
case, nothing has been shown or adverted to in these proceedings indicative of the
DDA's contemporaneous thinking that period i.e 1986-90 of the lease had to be
determined. It is not its case that the 11.11.1991 order determining the sub-lease was
ever communicated; much less acted upon. On the contrary possession of the premises

RA294/05 & CM13132/05

5 of 6

continued with the writ petitioner. He filed a suit for eviction and eventually secured
possession in 2000. In the meanwhile, at his behest, the DDA prosecuted the tenant.
Had the DDA felt that the writ petitioner too was guilty of the misuse, it could have
prosecuted him. That option too was not exercised. In these circumstances, the stand
sought to be projected after a lapse of such a length of time that misuse of the premises
started prior to 1990 and that the writ petitioner ought to pay misuse charges, is utterly
unwarranted and in any case unjustified.
10. In view of the above reasons, no ground for reviewing the judgment of this Court
dated 9.5.2005 has been made out. The review petition and CM No.13132/2005 are
hereby dismissed without any order as to costs.
