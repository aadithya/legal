1.

This petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1966,
seeks orders for setting aside an Award of the Arbitrator dated 30.1.207.

2.

The facts necessary for deciding the controversy in the present case are that
the Plaintiff, which engages itself in the business of transportation of bulk
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) using trucks for such purpose answered a
tender enquiry issued by the Respondent on 14.5.1999.

OMP 299/07

The respondent
1 to 13

sought for tenders in a two bid system i.e credential and price bid for award
of transportation contract for two years with an option for extending it by one
year. The petitioner had agreed to the tender conditions. Clause 4 of the
Standard Terms and Conditions, contained an escalation clause which
stipulated that revisions in the contracted freight rate would be applicable
subsequent to the issue of the offer letter against the tender.
3.

It is not in dispute that the Petitioner was declared successful and its offer of
Rs.1.32 per k.m. M.T., was accepted by the Respondent. The Respondent was
unable to finalise the rates and, therefore, not in a position to enter into final
and formal contract within the stipulated 240 days.

It, therefore, sought

extension of validity of the offer through letters dated 5.11.1999, 24.1.2000,
29.4.2000 and 31.5.2000, from the Petitioner, which granted it.
4.

When the Respondent was considering the offers and before issuance of
formal contract documents of 5.10.1999 there was an increase in the cost of
High Speed Diesel Oil (HSD).The Respondent later issued a Letter of Intent
to the Petitioner on 5.7.2000.

5.

The contract between the parties subsisted for the period 1.11.1999 to
31.10.2002, in terms of the Letter of Intent dated 5.7.2000. The Petitioner

OMP 299/07

2 to 13

claimed benefit of Clause 4(b) of the tender

conditions and consequent

increase of the rates, on application of the escalation clause. The Respondent
did not accede to it. It, therefore, sought a reference of the controversies and
disputes between the parties for decision to a Sole Arbitrator. The Sole
Arbitrator, after considering the pleadings and materials on record and
contentions of the parties, framed the impugned award rejecting the
Petitioner's claims.

The findings have been now challenged in the present

proceedings.
6.

The Petitioner avers, and its senior counsel Sh. Rajeev Shakdhar contends that
the award cannot be sustained as the Arbitrator has not rendered any findings
on the main issue even after acknowledging that it was bound to be decided.
Counsel relied upon the said issue formulated in Paragraph 1 of the Award i.e
whether the claimant was entitled to revision in transportation rates in terms of
Clause 4(a) and 4(b) of the standard terms and conditions of the agreement on
account of hike in the price of high speed diesel on 5.10.1999.

It was

contended that having formulated the question correctly, the arbitrator fell
into grave error in not deciding the issue. Learned counsel relied upon on the
stipulation to contend that the rates in this case were recommended on
OMP 299/07

3 to 13

5.10.1999 and thus

after the offer was submitted by the Petitioner (on

8.5.1999, which was opened on 14.5.1999) though benefit of the rates were to
be given with effect from 1.1.1999 i.e. when the contract became effective.
The Petitioner therefore could not be deprived of this revision in view of the
express terms in Clause 4(a) and 4(b). Learned counsel submitted in this
regard that the un-articulated premise of the award, while rejecting this claim
was that the offer was in fact made on 5.7.2000, the date when the LOI was
issued, which is clearly a wrong assumption. A plain reading of clause 4(a)
and 4(b) of the terms can leave no room for doubt that the offer letter intended
to be taken into consideration is the one given by the contractor, in response to
the tender and not the Letter of Intent, issued by the Respondent after
receiving the response to the tender. If the latter's contentions were to be
accepted, the contractor/transporter would be bound by unrealistic rates and
left at the mercy of the Respondent which could accept the offer even a year
later, ignoring previous revisions that would undermine the Sub-stratum of
the offer itself.
7.

Learned counsel next contended that the Arbitrator ignored a letter dated
19.11.1999 written by the Petitioner to the Respondent requesting the latter to

OMP 299/07

4 to 13

revise the transportation rates, this letter could not have been overlooked as it
contained a seal of the receipt of the Respondent. The latter did not produce
any evidence to rebut this fact. The Arbitrator therefore should have accepted
on the probability of evidence and held that the rates were revised on
5.10.1999 and effective from 1.11.1999 and therefore bound the parties.
8.

Learned counsel next contended that the findings recorded in Para 5 of the
Award that the escalation in rates was below 0.13 P, were unsustainable; the
arbitrator overlooked the revision in rates made on 5.10.1999 which should
have been taken into account. It was not open to the Respondents to contend
that the later increase in HSD by Rs.2.51P had absorbed the intervening
increase on that account. Learned counsel also adverted to subsequent letters
after 19.11.1999 written by the Petitioner to the Respondent and submitted
that they supported the former's case about its claiming escalation at all
relevant times.

9.

Learned counsel lastly contended that the Arbitrator fell into error and thus
mis-conducted himself in distinguishing the award in the case of M/s
Aggarwal Automobiles where the respondent's nominee arbitrator found that
an identical claim was admissible.

OMP 299/07

Learned counsel contended that the
5 to 13

findings of the arbitrator in this case about the facts and circumstances in that
award being peculiar and atypical were not based on records and hence
unfounded.
10.

Learned counsel submitted that this Court should exercise its jurisdiction
under Section 34 and set aside the award, in terms of the judgments of the
Supreme Court reported as Oil and Natural Gas Commission Vs. Saw Pipes,
2003(5) SCC 705, Mecdermott International Inc. Vs. Burn Standard Co. Ltd.
and Ors., 2006 (11) SCC 181. Learned counsel relied upon the decision of
the Supreme Court in Bank of India Vs. O.P. Swarnakar 2003 4 SCC 721, in
support of the submission that the offer made on 8.5.1999 was binding upon
the Respondent, under Clauses 4(a) and clause 4(b).

11.

Mr. Devashish Moira, learned counsel for the Respondent contended that the
Award does not disclose any error to enable this Court to interfere with it
award or set aside any of findings recorded as the Petitioner is unable to
demonstrate that any of the factors which vitiate an award in terms of Section
34 and the law declared in that regard attach to it. It was contended that the
objection about the arbitrator not rendering any finding on the issue of the
relevant date of offer, is without substance. Learned counsel pointed that the

OMP 299/07

6 to 13

issue as framed was not so much as the date of submission of the tender or
offer as much as the entitlement of the Petitioner to the amounts claimed by it.
He relied upon the findings to the effect that the Petitioner never, during the
subsistence of the agreement between 1.11.1999 and 31.10.2002 sought for
any increase in the price of high speed diesel. It was submitted that the
arbitrator noticed that in none of the tenders or documents submitted did the
Petitioner ever seek recourse to clause 4(a) or 4(b) or claim that the price
fixation made on 5.10.1999 should be applicable. The arbitration in this case
was invoked on 20.5.2004 much after the validity period of the contract.
12.

Counsel contended that even if the Court were not to agree with the
interpretation placed by the arbitrator or find that some materials were ignored
by him, unless the award disclosed any of the elements spelt out in the Saw
Pipes decision, i.e it was opposed to public policy in India, or was opposed to
national interest or was contrary to the express provisions of the Arbitration
Act, and/or patently illegal, the Court would desist from interfering with the
findings.

13.

Clause 4 of the Tender Conditions upon which the Petitioner has placed
considerable reliance reads as follows :-

OMP 299/07

7 to 13

“ESCALATION/ DE-ESCALATION OF RATES
a)

b)

c)

d)

Upward/ downward revision in the contracted freight rates shall be
allowed by the contracting Corporation/s, in case of revision/s in the
prices of High Speed Diesel, automotive Diesel Lubricants, and Tyres,
as per the contracting Corporation’s norms as applicable norms as
applicable from time to time.
These revisions in the contracted freight rate will be applicable only
for case/s of revision/s in the prices of High Speed Diesel, Automotive
Diesel Lubricants, and Tyres, notified by the Government/ contracting
Oil co./Tyre Manufacturers subsequent to the issue of the offer letters
against these tender/s.
These revisions in the contracting freight rates will be applicable
uniformly irrespective of the make, model and loading capacity of the
Tank – Trucks.
Frequently for permitting escalation, de-escalation of the rates will be
as under :

For HSD & Lube consumed: As and when the increased/decrease in rates
works out as 1.0 paisa or more PKM/ PMT on account of increase/ decrease
in the price of diesel/ lubes.
Increase/ decrease in the price of HSD will be based on RSP of one litre of
HSD sold ex-regional/ Zonal Head Quarters )Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta and
Madras).
Increase/ decrease in the price of the lubes will be based on RSP of one litre
of lube grade 30/40/50 (sold in loose) at the regional Head Quarters
(Mumbai, Delhi, Madras and Calcutta)”.

OMP 299/07

8 to 13

14.

In this case undeniably the Petitioner gave its offer pursuant to the tender
enquiry on 8.5.1999. The offer was to be valid for 240 days. The Respondent
was unable to finalize its decision and consequently it is an admitted fact that
the Petitioner extended the period of validity of the offer on two occasions, the
last one being upto 31.5.2000. The Letter of Intent was granted on 5.7.2000.
No doubt the Petitioner has placed reliance on two letters dated 19.11.1999 –
one stating that the Respondent should consider allowing justifiable escalation
in the rate quoted in the tender, yet what cannot be ignored is that the receipt
of this letter was disputed.

The arbitrator, however, did not accept the

claimants contentions in this regard and proceeded to hold that the offer as
made on 8.5.1999 was accepted.

This in turn led him to find that the

Petitioner was not entitled to the revision effected on 5.10.1999 in the HSD
rates. Though there can be two views on this issue – since there is no
explanation about the seal of the Respondent on that letter, nevertheless the
question is one of appreciation of facts. The Arbitrator was not convinced that
the letter was received by the Respondent, at any rate. He distinquished this
from the other case i.e. Aggarwal Automobiles where another letter phrased
somewhat differently making acceptance without prejudice to right to claim
OMP 299/07

9 to 13

rates, was given. If the Court's jurisdiction were an appellate one, the Court
should have perhaps considered and appreciated the evidence.

However,

judicial scrutiny cannot be expanded to substitution of such findings. In the
absence of any infirmity or unreasonableness in appreciation of facts the
Court should desist from interfering with the Award, on this ground.
15.

The Arbitrator in Paras 4,5 & 6 of the Award noticed that the claims for
increase of price in HSD due to revision dated 5.10.199 had never been
stressed upon at any time during finalisation of tender nor during the
contractual period, except for the letter dated 19.11.199 set up by the
Petitioner. He further held that during the contractual period, escalation took
place on two occasions i.e 16.1.200 and 30.9.2000. The first escalation was to
the extent of 0.13P. The interpretation given by him on this was that clause
4(d) entitled the contractor to increase rates only if the escalation was more
than one paise. He concluded that since the increase at that stage did not
correspond to the parameters, it was later absorbed in the subsequent increase
on 30.9.2000. This cumulative increase to the extent of 5.03 was duly granted
to all transporters including the present Petitioner. He, therefore, held as
follows :

OMP 299/07

10 to 13

“
In view of this the Claimants stand is unwarranted and
unsustainable as the escalation which took place during the period
from 01.11.99 to 05.07.2000 was only to the extent of Rs.0.13
paisa, which the Claimant was not entitled to as per terms of the
contract. However, subsequently the cumulative increase in rates
due to prices of HSD not only between 01.11.1999 to 05.07.2000
but also during the entire contractual period were duly awarded to
the Claimant by the Respondent. It is noted that claimant has
admittedly confirmed the aforesaid during his cross examination
on 22nd April, 2006.”
During Arbitration proceedings the letter 19.11.1999
which the claimant say was issued by them has been strongly
contested by the Respondent. During the proceedings the
Claimants could not prove that this letter was served on the
Respondent. Further there is no mention of this letter in their
various extension letters of 19.11.1999, 27.01.2000 and
31.05.2000 issued to the Respondent from time to time. The
Claimant should have endeavoured to get their letter accepted and
acknowledged by Respondent as was clearly done for their other
correspondence exchanged with the Respondent. I cannot but
come to the conclusion that the letter is an after thought. Thus
letter of 19.11.1999 which the claimant submits was issued
regarding revision of rates cannot be considered to be a part of
the finalized contract. Further except in the letter dated
19.11.1999 wherein revision of rates was allegedly sought by the
claimant there is no correspondence in any manner whatsoever
from the Claimant with the Respondent on this subject till as late
as year 2003. It is also relevant to note that the all payments
under the contract were duly and unconditionally accepted by the
Claimant and without any protest whatsoever. Under these
circumstances their claim to revision in rate is evidently
unjustified.”

OMP 299/07

11 to 13

16.

The reliance placed by the Petitioner on the award in M/s Aggarwal
Automobiles case was held not to be tenable on the ground that the contractor
there had categorically stated that signing of its contract was without prejudice
to its rights and contentions and that the was only for Kandla and LPG. These
two factors were deemed sufficient to distinguish the facts of this case.

17.

This Court has examined that Award which is a part of the record having been
produced and relied upon by the Petitioner in the arbitral proceedings. The
objection to the approach of the arbitrator in the present case, in not following
the other award, in the opinion of the Court is without foundation. Firstly, it
could not be shown as to how the award drawn pursuant to the claims of
another contractor, for transactions unrelated to the present Petitioner were
revision in these arbitration proceedings. Even if for some reason such award
were to be examined, it was well within the arbitrators domain to distinguish
the reasoning in that case from the present one. Another aspect which cannot
be lost-sight of (as observed by the Arbitrator) is that the claimant did not
demand the escalation, declared on 5.10.1999 during the substance of the
contract. It admittedly sought reference on 24.5.2003. The award in M/s
Aggarwal Automobiles was made on 1.3.2003.

OMP 299/07

These facts though not
12 to 13

noticed show that it appears that the present Petitioner was inspired by the
award in M/s Aggarwal Automobiles to make a claim – the only difference
being that in this case the claim was made more than a year after the contract
itself ended.
18.

Having considered the entire conspectus of the case the Court is unpersuaded
by the grounds urged in support of these petitions. They do not constitute
reasons for setting aside the award under Section 34, as interpreted in the Saw
Pipes decision (supra). The award does not disclose any infirmity it can be
characterized as findings that are opposed to public policy, national interest,
patent legality or contrary to express provisions of the Act.

19.

As a result of the above discussion, the Petition has to fail. It is accordingly
dismissed without any order as to costs.
