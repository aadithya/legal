BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.

This petition has been filed under Sections 14 and 15 of the

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as ‗the
said Act‘) seeking an order from this court terminating the mandate of
the sole arbitrator and appointment of a substitute arbitrator.

On

23.01.2008, when this petition came up for hearing for the first time,
notice was issued to the respondents. The learned counsel for the
respondents was present and accepted the notice and sought time to file
a reply. Thereafter, the respondents 1 to 3 filed their reply and the
petitioner filed its rejoinder to the said reply. Nobody has appeared on
OMP 45/08

Page No.1 of 11

behalf of the respondents today. The petition has been heard in the
absence of the counsel for the respondents.

2.

The facts leading to the filing of the present petition are that

on 23.10.2003, the respondent awarded the work of erection of, inter
alia, the HRSG Boiler at the Indian Oil Corporation Limited Refinery
at Mathura, U.P.

The contract was terminated by the respondent

(BHEL) before the expiry of the contract term. Disputes had arisen
between the parties and the petitioner had invoked the arbitration
clause. Since the respondent did not appoint the arbitrator within the
30-day period given in the notice, the petitioner filed an application
under Section 11 (6) of the said Act for appointment of an arbitrator
(i.e., Arbitration Application No.281/2004).

In the meanwhile, the

respondent had appointed Mr Jitendra Kumar, AGM, as the sole
arbitrator.

He held the first, second and third proceedings on

05.01.2005, 27.01.2005 and 23.02.2005. Thereafter, there was a stay
of proceedings by this court. However, by an order dated 26.07.2005,
the said petition was disposed of by directing that since the delay in
appointment was of only 4 to 5 days, the arbitrator who had already
been appointed would continue with the proceedings.

3.

Being aggrieved by the said order dated 26.07.2005, the

petitioner filed a writ petition being WP(C) 12721/2005 before a

OMP 45/08

Page No.2 of 11

Division Bench of this court. In the meanwhile, the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of S.B.P. and Company v. Patel
Engineering Ltd & Another: 2005 (8) SCC 618 was pronounced
wherein the Supreme Court, inter alia, held that the order passed under
Section 11 (6) of the said Act is a judicial order and not an
administrative order. Consequently, the Division Bench, by its order
dated 25.11.2005 dismissed the writ petition on this ground.
Thereafter, the petitioner filed a Special Leave Petition [SLP (C)
No.655/2006] before the Supreme Court against the order passed on
26.07.2005 under Section 11(6) of the said Act. On 30.01.2006, the
Special Leave Petition was also dismissed by the Supreme Court. It is,
therefore, clear that the appointment of Mr Jitendra Kumar as the sole
arbitrator became final.

4.

On 31.01.2006, the fourth proceedings were held before the

sole arbitrator.

The petitioner filed its statement of claims on

01.04.2006. The fifth proceedings were held on 13.04.2006 and the
respondents were directed to file their reply to the statement of claim as
also their counter-claim by 12.05.2006 and the next proceedings were
scheduled to be held on 28.06.2006. However, on 27.06.2006, the
learned arbitrator issued a letter postponing the proceedings till the first
week of September, 2006.

It is alleged by the petitioner that the

arbitrator simultaneously and unilaterally extended time to the

OMP 45/08

Page No.3 of 11

respondents till 31.07.2006 for filing the counter-claim without there
being any request made by the respondent/BHEL.

Thereafter, the

proceedings were again postponed and by a letter dated 12.07.2007 the
arbitrator fixed 31.08.2007 as the date for the sixth proceeding. The
arbitrator once again extended time to the respondents for filing the
counter-claim.

This date was also cancelled and by a letter dated

28.08.2007, the arbitrator rescheduled the proceedings for 25.09.2007
on account of his pre-occupation. Again on 21.09.2007, the arbitrator
sent a letter stating that due to his non-availability and pre-occupation,
the proceedings scheduled for 25.09.2007 stands cancelled and the said
proceedings would be held on 09.10.2007.

5.

Faced with the situation of repeated cancellations and

adjournments granted unilaterally by the learned arbitrator and without
there being any request or application from the respondents, the
petitioner protested against the same through its letter to the arbitrator
dated 30.09.2007. In this letter, the petitioner submitted as under:―The statement of claims was submitted on 1st April
2006 and thereafter the reply was to be filed on or
before 12th May 2006. However, two adjournments
were granted unilaterally. And subsequently there
were no proceedings held for a period of over 14
months. Ultimately the proceedings were scheduled to
be held on 31st August 2007 which were once again
cancelled by the Ld. Arbitrator without affording the
claimants
an
opportunity
for
submissions.
Subsequently the proceedings were to be held on 25 th
September 2007, which has now been cancelled and
rescheduled for 9th October 2007 again without
OMP 45/08

Page No.4 of 11

complying with prescribed norms or procedure. The
purpose of arbitration is to expeditiously decide on
disputes. But the manner in which the ld. Arbitrator is
repeatedly granting time after time to the respondents
in every letter even when notice of counter claims not
issued, requesting the respondent to file counter claims
is not only resulting in delay but also apprehension in
our mind that the present arbitrator is working as an
officer of BHEL than an independent, impartial and
qualified arbitrator.
It is for this reason necessary that the
arbitrator complies with the procedure under section 12
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

We reserve to ourselves the right to

event after receipt of documents before the date of next
hearing and on their perusal they reveal undue
accommodation and leniency towards respondents.‖

6.

However, the arbitrator sent a letter dated 06.10.2007 once

again cancelling the proceedings of 09.10.2007. In this letter, the
arbitrator stated that the date fixed for 09.10.2007 was being postponed
/ adjourned as requested by the claimant (the petitioner herein). The
petitioner was asked to propose a suitable date after 24.10.2007 for
holding the proceedings in order to fix a date suiting the petitioner.
This was protested to by the petitioner through its e-mail dated
06.10.2007 wherein the petitioner stated categorically that it had not
sought any postponement of the date of arbitration and no such request
had been made from its side. It is also indicated that the petitioner had,
in fact, booked air tickets and engaged the counsel for attending the

OMP 45/08

Page No.5 of 11

arbitration meeting on 09.10.2007 and that the postponement of
arbitration meeting would result in further losses to the petitioner.

7.

Thereafter, on 10.10.2007, the petitioner sent another protest

letter in which it was categorically stated that the arbitrator‘s order is
not correct nor is it based on facts and is misleading. The petitioner
specifically stated that it had never asked for any adjournment or
postponement of the arbitration proceedings scheduled to be held on
09.10.2007. The letter also contained the following submissions:―According to the turn of events we have
reason to believe that the postponement is at the behest
of the respondents. The Ld. Arbitrator is not directing
the respondents to submit the copy of postponement
request and has been unilaterally initiating cancellation
and postponement of proceedings indicating bias and
has created an apprehension in the mind of my client
that the Honourable Ld. Arbitrator is acting like AGM
(BHEL) than an independent impartial arbitrator.
On account of the untrue statements made in
the fax / email message of postponement of scheduled
meeting dated 09.10.2007 for which we were in all
readiness to participate and which now has been
postponed indefinitely on false pretexts. We therefore
now require the arbitrator to submit information as
contemplated under section (12) of Arbitration &
Reconciliation Act 1996 relating to independence,
qualification and competence of the arbitrator.

Kindly let us know the date on which the

postponement of filing of reply from April 2006
onwards and further clarify whether such applications
were oral or were in writing. We may also be
informed the inward and outward numbers of register

to avoid possibility of ante dating of correspondence.
Further we demand inspection of arbitral records of
this arbitrator and be permitted to take copies thereof.
Please do the needful and oblige.‖

8.

No replies to the protest letters were received from the

arbitrator. Subsequently, by a letter dated 27.11.2007, the arbitrator
informed that the next proceedings would be held on 18.12.2007.
However, the arbitrator, while fixing 18.12.2007 as the next date of
holding the proceedings denied the contents of the petitioner‘s letter
dated 10.10.2007. The learned arbitrator ostensibly was of the view
that entering into the controversy raised by the petitioner in its letter
dated 10.10.2007 would further delay the arbitration proceedings and
he ―advised‖ the parties to participate in the arbitration proceedings.
Consequently, he fixed 18.12.2007 as the next date and directed the
parties to attend the arbitration proceedings on the date, time and place
fixed as per the said notice. This was also not to be so. The learned
arbitrator sent a letter dated 14.12.2007 cancelling the proceedings to
be held on 18.12.2007 on the ground that he would be busy due to
―urgent official work‖. Once again, the arbitrator directed the parties to
attend the arbitration proceedings on the next date, i.e., 28.01.2008 and
―made it clear‖ that the above said date would not be changed. But
even that date was cancelled by the learned arbitrator and the 6 th
meeting was rescheduled for 08.03.2008.

In the meanwhile, the petitioner had filed the present petition

on 22.01.2008. The grievance of the petitioner is that the arbitrator has
failed to act without undue delay and, therefore, his mandate stands
terminated. Of course, the petitioner also took the grounds of bias and
the fact that the arbitrator became the General Manager of the very
department which had cancelled the contract of the petitioner and that
this fact had not been disclosed by him as was required to be disclosed
under the provisions of Section 12 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996. The main ground, however, for seeking directions under
this application is that the arbitrator has failed to act without undue
delay. Sections 14 and 15 of the said Act are relevant and they read as
under:―14.
Failure or impossibility to act.—(1) The
mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate if—
(a) he becomes de jure or de facto unable
to perform his functions or for other
reasons fails to act without undue delay;
and
(b) he withdraws from his office or the
parties agree to the termination of his
mandate.
(2)
If a controversy remains concerning any of
the grounds referred to in clause
(a) of sub-section (1), a party may, unless
otherwise agreed by the parties, apply to
the Court to decide on the termination
of the mandate.
(3)
If, under this section or sub-section (3) of
section 13, an arbitrator withdraws from his office or a
party agrees to the termination of the mandate of an
arbitrator, it shall not imply acceptance of the validity
of any ground referred to in this section or sub-section
(3) of section 12.
OMP 45/08

Page No.8 of 11

15. Termination of mandate and substitution of
arbitrator. –
(1)
In addition to the circumstances referred to
in section 13 or section 14, the mandate of an
arbitrator shall terminate(a) Where he withdraws from office for
any reason; or
(b) By or pursuant to agreement of the
parties.
(2)
Where the mandate of an arbitrator
terminates, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed
according to the rules that were applicable to the
appointment of the arbitrator being replaced.
(3)
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties,
where an arbitrator is replaced under subsection (2),
any hearings previously held may be repeated at the
discretion of the arbitral tribunal.
(4)
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an
order or ruling of the arbitral tribunal made prior to
the replacement of an arbitrator under this section
shall not be invalid solely because there has been a
change in the composition of the arbitral tribunal.‖

10.

It is apparent that the mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate

if he, inter alia, fails to act without undue delay. It is also apparent that
by virtue of Section 14(2) of the said Act, if there is a controversy with
regard to this, a party may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties,
apply to the court to decide on the termination of the mandate. No
contrary agreement between the parties has been brought to the notice
of the court. Therefore, the petitioner is well within his rights to
approach this court for a decision on the question of termination of the
OMP 45/08

Page No.9 of 11

mandate of the arbitrator. The facts and circumstances as narrated
above amply demonstrate that the arbitrator has not been able to act and
the 5th proceedings which were held on 05.01.2005 could not be
followed by a 6th proceeding till the filing of the petition on
22.01.2008. If this is not undue delay, then nothing could be. The only
ostensible reason for the delay is that the arbitrator has been busy with
his other official duties. It is abundantly clear that the arbitrator is so
busy with his official duties that he cannot conduct the arbitration
proceedings without undue delay. The numerous occasions on which
dates have been fixed and cancelled unilaterally by the arbitrator
clearly demonstrate that the said arbitrator has failed to act without
undue delay and, if I may add, act at all. The whole purpose of
arbitration is to provide a quick remedy to the parties to have their
disputes adjudicated upon.

This objective has been completely

obviated by the manner in which the present proceedings have been
conducted by the learned arbitrator. In fact, the learned arbitrator has
been most unfair in adjourning one of the proceedings on the ground
that the petitioner had sought an adjournment when, in fact, the
petitioner had sought no such adjournment.

11.

All these circumstances lead me to only one conclusion and

that is that the mandate of the arbitrator has terminated inasmuch as he
has failed to act without undue delay.

OMP 45/08

This being the position, a

Page No.10 of 11

substitute arbitrator has to be appointed in terms of Section 15 (2) of
the said Act according to the rules that were applicable to the
appointment of the arbitrator who is being replaced. Consequently, the
arbitration shall now be conducted by the General Manager, BHEL or
his nominee in terms of clause 33 of the agreement between the parties.
The General Manager, BHEL is directed to take up the arbitration
himself or nominate another arbitrator within four weeks.
This petition is allowed and disposed of accordingly.
