1.

The petitioner was enrolled in the CISF on 8.5.1990 and
during the tenure of his service was posted with IOC
(Mathura) w.e.f. 14.6.2002.

The petitioner sustained

certain injuries in November 2003 and was advised
lighter duties. The petitioner was, thus, posted on duty
at the Watch Tower No.14.

WP (C) No.1135 of 2007

2.

The date of the incident which resulted in disciplinary
proceedings against the petitioner is dated 5.6.2004
when the petitioner was posted on the said duty tower
between 5:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. The petitioner claimed
that he received an anonymous call at about 7:50 a.m.
on the said date informing him about some goods hidden
in the nearby Fire Practice Yard. The petitioner went to
look to the same but did not find anything and thus came
back to the tower.

3.

The petitioner was served with the Memorandum dated
21.6.2004 alleging indiscipline and carelessness towards
his duties as he was found wandering while holding some
goods in his hands which goods were thrown in a nearby
bush.

On search being conducted, the goods thrown

were found to be some copper pipes of some 2.00 kg
weight.

In another place at the Fire Practice Yard on

further search 20.00 kg of copper pipes bundled in a
gunny bag and hidden in the grass were found. Thus a
proposal was laid under Rule 37 of the Central Industrial
Security Force Rules, 2001 (hereinafter referred to as the
said Rules) for action against the petitioner for minor
penalty. The petitioner sent a reply to the Memorandum
but the petitioner was found guilty in terms of final order
dated 21.7.2004 and was imposed a punishment of

WP (C) No.1135 of 2007

Page 2 of 14

deduction of salary equivalent to three (3) days in terms
of Rule 34 of the said Rules.
4.

The petitioner was aggrieved by the said finding and
penalty and thus preferred an appeal under Rule 52 of
the said Rules.

The appeal was considered by the

Commandant who set aside the order dated 21.7.2004,
cancelled

the

charge

sheet

dated

21.6.2004

and

proceeded to direct the issuance of a fresh charge sheet
under Rule 36 of the said Rules for imposition of a major
penalty.

The aforesaid was done without issuing any

show cause notice to the petitioner.
5.

In

pursuance

Memorandum

to
was

the

aforesaid

issued

to

the

direction

a

fresh

petitioner

dated

18.1.2005 alleging that the petitioner was guilty of moral
turpitude and fallacy in performing his duties.

A

departmental inquiry was held and the department
recorded testimonies of six witnesses. It is the grievance
of the petitioner that none of the six defence witnesses
whom the petitioner wanted to examine were called for
deposition.
6.

The petitioner was served with the final order dated
20.6.2005 holding him guilty of the charges and a
penalty was imposed of reduction of nine stages in the
pay-scale of the petitioner from 3,725.00 to Rs.3,050.00
for five years with a further direction that the petitioner

WP (C) No.1135 of 2007

Page 3 of 14

would not earn any annual increments during the period
of penalty.
7.

The petitioner aggrieved by the said order again filed an
appeal which was decided vide order dated 10.2.2006 by
the Deputy Inspector General.

The findings of the

disciplinary authority were affirmed but insofar as the
punishment was concerned, the order states that in
exercise of Rule 52 of the said Rules the punishment was
cancelled and replaced by the punishment of removal
from service.
8.

The petitioner thereafter filed a revision under Rule 54 of
the said Rules, which was dismissed vide order dated
21.11.2006.

The petitioner has thereafter filed the

present writ petition.
9.

Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the
order passed on 11.12.2004 by the appellate authority
under Rule 52 of the said Rules was illegal and without
jurisdiction as no direction could have been passed for
cancelling the charge sheet and the proceedings in
pursuance thereto and ordering a fresh charge sheet. In
this behalf Rule 52 of the said Rules has been referred to
which reads as under:
“52. Consideration of appeals. – (1) In the case of
an appeal against an order of suspension, the
appellate authority shall consider whether in the light
of the provisions of rule 33 and having regard to the
circumstances of the case, the order of suspension is

WP (C) No.1135 of 2007

Page 4 of 14

justified or not and confirm or revoke the order
accordingly.
(2) In the case of an appeal against the order
imposing any of the penalties specified in rule 34, or
enhancing any penalty imposed under the said rules,
the appellate authority shall consider –
(a) whether the procedure laid down in these rules has
been complied with and if not whether such noncompliance has resulted in the violation of any
provisions of the Constitution of India or in the failure
of justice;
(b) whether the findings of the disciplinary authority are
warranted on the basis of the evidence on the
record; and
(c) whether the penalty or the enhanced penalty
imposed is excessive, or adequate, or inadequate
and pass orders –
(i)

confirming, enhancing, reducing or setting
aside the penalty; or

(ii)

remitting the case to the authority which
imposed or enhanced the penalty, or to any
other authority with such directions it may
deem fit in the circumstances of the case;

[(iii) No order imposing enhanced penalty shall be
made in any other case unless the appellant
has been given a reasonable opportunity, as
far as may be in accordance with the
provisions of
rule
37,
of
making
a
representation
against
such
enhanced
penalty.]
Provided that –
(i)

If such enhanced penalty which the appellate
authority proposes to impose is one of the
penalties specified in clauses (i) to (v) of rule 34
and an inquiry under rule 36 has not already been
held in the case; the appellate authority shall,
subject to the provisions of rule 39, itself hold
such an inquiry or direct that such inquiry be held
in accordance with rule 36 and thereafter on a
consideration of the proceedings of such inquiry
make such orders as it may deem fit; and

(ii)

If the enhanced penalty which the appellate
authority proposes to impose is one of the

WP (C) No.1135 of 2007

Page 5 of 14

penalties specified in clauses (i) to (v) of rule 34
and an inquiry under rule 36 has already been
held in the case, the appellate authority shall
make such orders as it may deem fit.”

10.

Learned counsel for the petitioner thus submits that it is
sub-rule 2 of Rule 52 where an appeal is directed against
imposition of any of the penalties specified in Rule 34 of
the said Rules and that the appellate authority is
empowered to either set aside the order and the
sentence or even enhance any penalty under the Rules.
Thus, it is submitted that the appellate authority only had
the option if it was of such opinion to enhance the
sentence and not to direct de novo proceedings.

In

support of the plea learned counsel has referred to the
judgement of the Apex Court in Kanailal Bera Vs. Union of
India & Ors. (2007) 10 SCC 612 wherein it was observed
as under:
“….Once a disciplinary proceeding has been initiated,
the same must be brought to its logical end meaning
thereby a finding is required to be arrived at as to
whether the delinquent officer is guilty of charges
leveled against him or not. In a given situation
further evidences may be directed to be adduced but
the same would not mean that despite holding a
delinquent officer to be partially guilty of the charges
leveled against him another inquiry would be directed
to be initiated on the self same charges which could
not be proved in the first inquiry.”
11.

Learned counsel for the petitioner also pleaded that
there were inconsistencies in the evidence recorded and
that despite the allegation of such heavy recoveries

being made neither any property certificate nor seizure
certificate or IOC challan was prepared.

that

petitioner

had

unblemished record of sixteen (16) years of service
which was sought to be put at naught in terms of the
impugned order.
13.

Learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand,
defended the action taken against the petitioner by the
respondents. The records have also been produced. It is
submitted that at the stage when the appeal of the
petitioner was pending, the then DIG carried out an
inspection of the CISF Unit IOC (Mathura) from 5.10.2004
to 6.10.2004 and reviewed the disciplinary cases.

On

such review it was found that the misconduct of the
petitioner was a grave one and warranted institution of a

The following observations were made by

the DIG:
“No.904523566 Const RS Shekhawat was found
collecting brass wire and scrap around his duty on
5.6.04. He has been punished for 03 days pay fine
only on 21.7.04.
No PE in this case has been
conducted. The allegation against him is of serious
nature. I have directed Commandant to immediately
place him under suspension and review his case.”
WP (C) No.1135 of 2007

Page 7 of 14

14.

It is in pursuance to the aforesaid that the appellate
authority exercised the powers under Rule 52 of the said
Rules and passed an order dated 11.12.2004.

15.

Learned counsel for the respondents contended that
under Rule 54 of the said Rules a superior authority on its
own motion or otherwise can call for the records of any
inquiry and revise any order made under the said Rules.
Thus reliance has also been placed on Rule 54 of the said
Rules, which reads as under:
“[54. Revision. – (1) Any authority superior to the
authority making the order may either on his own
motion or otherwise call for the records of any
inquiry and revise any order made unless these
rules, and may –
(a)

Confirm, modify or set aside the order; or

(b)

Confirm, reduce, enhance or set aside the
penalty imposed by the order, or impose any
penalty where no penalty has been imposed; or

(c)

Remit the case to the authority which made
the order or to any other authority directing
such authority to make such further enquiry as
it may consider proper in the circumstances of
the case; or

(d)

Pass such order as it may deem fit, within six
months of the date of communication of the
order proposed to be revised:

Provided that no order imposing or enhancing
any penalty shall be made by any revisioning
authority unless the enrolled member of the Force
concerned has been given a reasonable opportunity
of making a representation against the penalty
proposed and where it is proposed to impose any of
the penalties specified in clauses (i) to (v) of rule 34
or to enhance the penalty imposed by the order
sought to be revised to any of the penalties specified
in those clauses, and if any, inquiry under rule 36 of
Central Industrial Security Force Rules, 2001 has not
WP (C) No.1135 of 2007

Page 8 of 14

already been held in the case no such penalty shall
be imposed except after an enquiry in the manner
laid down in the aforesaid rules.
(2)
The provisions of rule 52 relating to appeals
shall apply so far as may be to such orders in
revision.
(3)
Orders and instructions issued by the Central
Government on this subject from time to time shall
be applicable mutatis mutandis as applicable under
Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and
Appeal) Rules, 1965.]”

16.

It is, thus, submitted that under the revisionary power
the

superior

authority

can

confirm/modify/set

aside/reduce or enhance the penalty imposed by the
order or impose any penalty where no penalty has been
imposed or remit the case to the authority which made
the order or any other authority directing such authority
to make such further enquiry as may be considered
proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.
17.

Learned counsel submits that the nature of charge
remained the same in the fresh Memorandum issued and
there was no occasion for the petitioner to leave the
tower on an anonymous call. It is also pleaded that there
have been prior occasions where the petitioner had been
punished

for

various

misdemeanor

which

included

censure, fine and stoppage of increment without punitive
effect.

18.

We have examined the submissions made by learned
counsels for the parties and in our considered view the
matter in controversy falls within a very narrow compass.

19.

This Court does not sit as a court of appeal to re-examine
the evidence and the testimony recorded and thus it is
not necessary to weigh the evidence again to reach a
conclusion whether the findings arrived at by the
disciplinary authority were correct or not. However, the
material aspect is that the Memorandum issued to the
petitioner was for a minor penalty under Rule 37 of the
said Rules which resulted in the order dated 21.7.2004
whereby the petitioner was held guilty and the penalty of
deduction of three (3) days salary was imposed.

The

petitioner was within his rights to file the appeal and the
Commandant was liable to consider the appeal within the
parameters of Rule 52 of the said Rules.

In fact, the

order of the Commandant dated 11.12.2004 itself states
that the exercise of the power is under Rule 52.
20.

Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 52 of the said Rules provides for the
exercise of power by the appellate authority against the
order imposing any of the penalties specified in Rule 34
of the said Rules (Rule 34 contains both major and minor
penalties). It was, thus, open for the appellate authority
to consider whether the procedure laid down in the Rules
has been complied with or not, whether the finding of the

WP (C) No.1135 of 2007

Page 10 of 14

disciplinary authority were warranted on the basis of the
evidence on record and whether the penalty imposed
was excessive, adequate or inadequate. As a sequitur to
that the appellate authority could confirm, enhance,
reduce or set aside the penalty or remit the case to the
authority which imposed the punishment or enhance the
penalty

with proper directions,

but after giving a

reasonable opportunity of hearing to the petitioner.
21.

The appellate authority in the present case could, thus,
have been justified in upholding the finding of guilt and
imposing a more severe punishment instead of a minor
penalty in view of the proceedings itself being initiated
for such a minor penalty.

The power conferred under

Rule 52 of the said Rules on the appellate authority
nowhere authorizes such authority to set aside the
impugned order and direct issuing a fresh Memorandum
or charge sheet to the petitioner as was sought to be
done by the appellate authority.
22.

It is not open to the respondents to plead that the
provisions of Rule 54 of the said Rules would apply in the
present case since the power being exercised by the
authority was an appeal power and not a revision power.
Not only that even the reading of Rule 54 of the said
Rules itself shows that what is envisaged is for an
authority to make an order either on its own motion or

WP (C) No.1135 of 2007

Page 11 of 14

otherwise call for records of any inquiry and revise any
order made under the said Rules and in doing so confirm,
modify or set aside the order or sentence or remit the
case to the authority to make further inquiry.
23.

The facts set out in the present case, in fact, show that
what

precipitated

the

extreme

action

against

the

petitioner without any reference to the powers confirmed
under Rule 52 of the said Rules was the observations of
the DIG, CISF on his visit to the concerned CISF Unit. It is
apparent that the appellate authority has acted totally
under the diktat of the note made by the DIG, CISF and
thus thrown to the wind the procedure envisaged under
Rule 52 of the said Rules. The appellate authority, thus,
proceeded to act much beyond the powers conferred
under Rule 52 of the said Rules to direct a de novo
inquiry

against

the

petitioner

on

a

fresh

Memorandum/charge sheet being issued.
24.

Another aspect relevant is that the appellate authority is
the designated authority to consider the appeal.

The

appellate authority must put its mind to decide the
appeal

uninfluenced

by

any

extraneous

factor

or

extraneous diktat in a sense the appellate authority is
the

persona

designata.

The

appellate

authority

apparently did not apply its own mind to the facts of the
case and on the basis of the notings made by the DIG
WP (C) No.1135 of 2007

Page 12 of 14

proceeded to pass an order under the said diktat. This
was not permissible.

It is such a diktat which has

resulted in an illegal and irregular order being passed by
the appellate authority.
25.

We are fortified in our view by the decision of the
Supreme Court in Kanailal Bera case (supra) holding that
once a disciplinary proceedings have been initiated the
same must be brought to a logical end where the
delinquent officer may be held guilty of a charge or not,
the sentence may be varied, fresh evidence may be
directed to be adduced but no fresh inquiry can be
directed on the same charges.

26.

We have, thus, no hesitation in holding that the
impugned

order

of

the

appellate

authority

dated

11.12.2004 directing a fresh charge sheet to be issued is
not sustainable and is liable to be quashed.

The

consequence thereof is that all proceedings taken
thereafter would necessarily have to be quashed and
thus the fresh orders passed by the disciplinary authority
on 20.6.2005, by the appellate authority on 10.2.2006
and the revisionary authority on 21.11.2006 are also
liable to be quashed.

We may note that even in the

second round the disciplinary authority did not find it
appropriate to impose the punishment of dismissal from

WP (C) No.1135 of 2007

Page 13 of 14

service but it is the appellate authority which imposed
the said punishment.
27.

The result of the aforesaid is that the appeal of the
petitioner would have to be heard afresh against the
order dated 21.7.2004 and a reasoned order passed
within the ambit of Rule 52 of the said Rules.

28.

A writ of mandamus is issued quashing the order dated
11.12.2004, the fresh Memorandum dated 18.1.2005, the
order dated 20.6.2005 of the disciplinary authority, the
order dated 10.2.2006 of the appellate authority and the
order dated 21.11.2006 of the revision authority with the
direction that the appellate authority should hear the
appeal of the petitioner afresh against the order dated
21.7.2004 to be confined within the parameters of Rule
52 of the said Rules as set out hereinabove.

In these

circumstances the petitioner shall have to be reinstated
in service from the date of his removal with all
consequential benefits to be remitted to him within three
(3) months from today.
29.

The petition is allowed leaving the parties to bear their
own costs.
