1.

The issues raised in this batch of seven petitions pertain to the

various letters of demand of punitive charges raised by the Railway Authorities
in respect of alleged overloading of wagons. According to the petitioners, the
demand for punitive charges must be made before the delivery of goods,
otherwise they would not be in a position to challenge any weighment made by
the Railways and would be obliged to pay any sum that is demanded by them.
In these petitions, the demands have been raised after delivery of goods. The
petitioners placed reliance on Sections 73 and 79 of the Railways Act, 1989.

2.

The petitioners have also challenged para 1744 of the Indian

Railways Commercial Manual as being violative of Section 79 of the Railways
Act, 1989 inasmuch as it virtually takes away the statutory right of reweighment. The said Indian Railway Commercial Manual has been formulated
by the Railway Board constituted under the Indian Railway Board Act, 1905.

3.

The petitioners have, therefore, essentially prayed for the quashing

of the demand for punitive charges as well as for quashing of para 1744 of the
Indian Railway Commercial Manual. On the other hand, the respondents have
taken a strong objection to the maintainability of the present petitions on the
ground that this Court lacks territorial jurisdiction to entertain these petitions.
It is for this reason that the issue with regard to the territorial jurisdiction of this

WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.3 of 44

court in these matters was heard as a preliminary issue and the same is being
disposed of by the present judgment.

4.

Ms Geetanjali Mohan, appearing on behalf of the respondents 2 to

4 (viz. the Railway authorities), referred to the jurisdiction paragraph in
WP(C)2103/2007 to indicate as to how the petitioners sought to invoke the
jurisdiction of this court. The paragraph in all the petitions is identical. The
said paragraph reads as under:“72.
This Hon'ble Court has the jurisdiction to entertain
this Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. The
impugned demands have been issued, inter alia, by the
Respondents from their offices situated within as well as
outside the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. The bills have
been raised by the South East Central Railway, which is one
of sixteen Railway zones constituted by the Central
Government under Section 3 of the Railways Act, 1989. The
general superintendence and control of a Zonal Railway is
exercised by the Central Government. Thus, even on that
score, this Hon'ble Court would possess the territorial
jurisdiction to entertain the instant Writ Petition. In particular,
it may be submitted that Respondent No.1 has framed
paragraph 1744 of the IRCM within the jurisdiction and which
has been challenged by the Petitioners herein. It may be
submitted that the said paragraph is mandatorily required to be
followed by all zonal Railways, including South East
Railways. The said paragraphs admittedly having been
framed by the Respondent No.1 within the jurisdiction of this
Hon'ble Court, the present Writ Petition is maintainable.”
(underlining added)
5.

Ms Mohan submitted that all the demands of punitive charges have

been raised by the Chief Station Manager, South East Central Railway,
Mandhar, Chattisgarh. She submitted that not a single demand has been raised
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.4 of 44

in Delhi. She further submitted that the petitioners' registered office is situated
in Nagpur, Maharashtra.

Its integrated steel plant is at Sintara, Mandhar,

Chattisgarh. The goods booked in all cases were at Noamundi (Jharkhand),
Badampahar (Orissa), Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh), Barbil (Orissa),
Banspani (Orissa) and Jaroli (Orissa). The re-weighment of the goods en-route
have been done at the Champa Weigh-Bridge (Chattisgarh) or at Simhachalam
(Andhra Pradesh).

The point of delivery of all the goods was Mandhar,

Chattisgarh.

6.

Ms Mohan, therefore, submitted that neither have the punitive

demands been raised in Delhi nor have the goods been booked, re-weighed or
delivered at Delhi. According to her, nothing has happened in Delhi in respect
of the goods and, therefore, no part of the cause of action has arisen within the
territorial limits of this court.

7.

With regard to the challenge to para 1744 of the Indian Railway

Commercial Manual, she submitted that although the same has been framed in
Delhi by the Railway Board, this in itself would not give rise to a cause of
action.

The cause of action would arise only when and where the said

paragraph effects a person. In other words, where the civil consequences are
felt. Ms Mohan referred to the Supreme Court decision in the case of Union of
India and Others v. Adani Exports Ltd and Another: 2002 (1) SCC 567. With
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.5 of 44

reference to para 17 of the said decision, she submitted that for the purposes of
determining its jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition, a High Court must be
satisfied from the entire facts pleaded in support of the cause of action that
those facts do constitute a cause so as to empower the court to decide a dispute
which has, at least in part, arisen within its jurisdiction. The Supreme Court
also held that each and every fact pleaded in the petition does not ipso facto
lead to the conclusion that those facts give rise to a cause of action within the
court's territorial limits unless the facts pleaded are such that they have a nexus
or relevance with the lis that is involved in the case. The facts which have no
bearing with the lis or the dispute involved in the case, do not give rise to a
cause of action so as to confer territorial jurisdiction on the court concerned.
Based on these observations of the Supreme Court, Ms Mohan submitted that
nothing has happened in Delhi with regard to the booking, weighment or
delivery of the goods. In fact, even the demands for punitive charges have been
raised outside Delhi. The petitioner's registered office is also not in Delhi and
its integrated steel plant is at Mandhar, Chattisgarh. The dispute is with regard
to the demands for punitive charges. None of the facts which have a nexus
with this dispute have any relation to Delhi. Therefore, she pleaded that the
writ petitions are not maintainable before this court.

8.

She continued her submissions and placed strong reliance on the

decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd v.
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.6 of 44

Union of India and Another: 2004 (6) SCC 254.

In the context of the

challenge to para 1744 of the Indian Railway Commercial Manual, she referred
to paragraphs 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the said decision to submit that the passing
of a legislation by itself does not confer any right to file a writ petition unless a
cause of action arises therefor, as observed in the said decision of the Supreme
Court, “if passing of a legislation gives rise to a cause of action, a writ petition
questioning the constitutionality thereof can be filed in any High Court of the
country, but it is not so done because the cause of action will arise only when
the provisions of the Act or some of them which were implemented shall give
rise to civil or evil consequences to the petitioner”.

The Supreme Court

observed that “a writ court would not determine a constitutional question in a
vacuum and that the court must have the requisite territorial jurisdiction”.
With further reference to the decision in Kusum Ingots (supra), Ms Mohan
submitted that a writ petition questioning the constitutionality of a
Parliamentary Act shall not be maintainable in the High Court of Delhi “only”
because the seat of the Union of India is in Delhi. Drawing analogy from this,
she submitted that para 1744 of the Indian Railway Commercial Manual cannot
be questioned in a writ petition in this High Court only because the seat of the
Railway Board which formulated the said Manual is in Delhi. She finally
referred to para 26 of the decision in Kusum Ingots (supra) wherein it is
observed as under:-

WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.7 of 44

“.... In fact, a legislation, it is trite, is not confined to a
statute enacted by Parliament or the Legislature of a State,
which would include delegated legislation and subordinate
legislation or an executive order made by the Union of India,
State or any other statutory authority. In a case where the
field is not covered by any statutory rule, executive
instructions issued in this behalf shall also come with within
the purview thereof. Situs of office of the Parliament,
Legislature of a State or authorities empowered to make
subordinate legislation would not by itself constitute any
cause of action or cases arising. In other words, framing of a
statute, statutory rule or issue of an executive order or
instruction would not confer jurisdiction upon a court only
because of the situs of the office of the maker thereof. ”
(underlining added)
9.

She also made a passing reference to the decision of the Supreme

Court in the case of M/s Patel Roadways Limited v. M/s Prasad Trading
Company: AIR 1992 SC 1514 which pertains to Section 20 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, 1908. However, since Section 20 CPC is not applicable, that
need not be elaborated upon.
10.

Lastly, she referred to a decision of a Division Bench of this court

in the case of Ex. Rect./GD Vinod Kumar v. Union of India and Others: 2007
(I) AD (Delhi) 284. She referred to paragraphs 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the said
decision. She placed particular emphasis on the following passages from the
said decision:“14.
However, in the later judgments, the Supreme
Court has unambiguously taken the view that even if the seat
of the Government or the concerned department is located
within the territorial jurisdiction of the court, but no cause of
action or any fraction or part thereof has arisen within the
jurisdiction of that court, the court may not answer the issue
of jurisdiction in favour of the petitioner. Constitutional
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.8 of 44

mandate is that the High Court would exercise jurisdiction in
relation to the territories of which it is the High Court.
Clauses (1) and (2) of Article 226 have to be read and
construed in conjunction with each other but none of them
would be capable of extending jurisdiction of the court
normally beyond its prescribed territorial jurisdiction. To
take benefit of this enlarged jurisdiction, it would be
obligatory upon a petitioner to show that any cause of action
or part thereof had arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of
that court.
15.
We are dealing with the cases where the Forces
are operating under Special Statues like Army Act, CRPF
Act, CISF Act & BSF Acts. These Acts have an inbuilt
remedial system. They provide for statutory appeal
provisions and representations. In fact, any order passed can
be complained of to the higher authorities under the
provisions of the Act. In the event, all these authorities are
located beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the court and the
petitioner has exhausted such remedies, then he can hardly
invoke the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the
central or main office or seat of the department is located
within the jurisdiction of this Court. Such an interpretation
would result in prolongation of cases and also cause
prejudice to the parties. The records of all the authorities
whose jurisdiction the petitioner might have invoked during
the pendency of departmental action or proceedings would
be available in the offices of the authorities beyond the local
limits of the court. We have already noticed that expeditious
disposal is one of the underlining features of the amended
provisions of Article 226 and to ensure balancing of
convenience between the parties to the lis, it may be
appropriate that the courts determine the question of
jurisdiction at the very threshold of the proceedings. Proper
exercise of jurisdiction would ex facie take in its ambit
remedies which are effective and efficacious. If both or any
of these ingredients are not satisfied, it would be a factor
which will tilt the view of the court against exercising its
jurisdiction. The court is expected to deal with the issue of
jurisdiction right at the initial stages and normally while
taking the petition as framed to be correct. Article 226 (2)
opens with the words “The power conferred by Clause (1) to
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.9 of 44

issue directions...” which clearly indicates amplification of
jurisdiction and that the provision is meant to aid the powers
vested in the High Court for issuance of writ, order or
direction located within their territorial jurisdiction. The
expression 'may also' would have to be given their true
meaning while ensuring that such connotations are in
consonance with the law enunciated by the Supreme Court
and also spirit of constitutional territorial jurisdiction of a
High Court.”
(underlining added)

11.

Mr Neeraj Kishan Kaul, the learned senior counsel appearing on

behalf of the petitioner, submitted that till date the Constitution Bench decision
in the case of Lt. Col. Khajoor Singh v. Union of India & Another: AIR 1961
SC 532 = 1961 (2) SCR 828 with regard to Article 226 (1) is good law. He
submitted that in Khajoor Singh's case, it has been held that the High Court
within whose limits the order is passed will have jurisdiction to entertain a writ
petition de hors the question of where the cause of action arose. He submitted
that the focus in Article 226 (1) of the Constitution is on the location of the
authority or person or government to whom the writ is to be issued. He further
submitted that Article 226 (2) which was introduced as sub-Article (1A) by
virtue of the 15th amendment to the Constitution in 1963 and was subsequently
renumbered as sub-Article (2) by virtue of the 42nd Amendment, is not a
curtailment of the territorial jurisdiction of the High Courts, but an
amplification of the same. The introduction of cause of action provides the
High Courts with a sort of an extension of their territorial jurisdiction insofar as
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.10 of 44

writ petitions are concerned. He submitted that the decisions relied upon by Ms
Mohan in the case of Adani Exports (supra), Kusum Ingots (supra) and Ex.
Rect. Vinod Kumar (supra) all relate to Article 226 (2) and not to Article 226
(1) which has not been effaced.

12.

Mr Kaul submitted that the issue has been dealt with succinctly by a

learned single Judge of this court (B.N. Kirpal, J, as he then was) in the case of
Girwar v. Union of India and Others: 1982 (2) All India Service Law
Journal 56. It was observed by the learned single Judge that Article 226 (2) is
in addition to Article 226 (1). Para 12 of the said decision is relevant and the
same is reproduced hereinbelow:“12.
At the time of arguments Mr. Dhir has raised a
contention that this Court has no territorial jurisdiction. His
contention is that the cause of action arose in Rajasthan and,
therefore, by virtue of sub-Article (2) of Article 226 it is only
that Court which has the jurisdiction. I am unable to agree
with this contention. Under Article 226 (1) this Court has
jurisdiction to issue writ against the Union of India. Prior to
the insertion of sub-Article (2) it was only the Punjab High
Court, at that time, which had the jurisdiction to issue writs
to Union of India as had been held by the Supreme Court in
the case of Election Commission, India, v. Saka Venkata
Subba Rao: 1953 S.C.R. 1144 and K.S. Rashid and Son v.
The Income-tax Investigation Commission, etc.: 1954 S.C.R.
738. At that time some of the High Courts were of the
opinion that where the cause of action arose writ petition
could be filed in those High Courts also. This view was not
approved by the Supreme Court. Subsequently Article 226
was amended and sub-Article (2) was inserted. In the
statement of objects and reasons as well as in the notes on
clauses it was stated that the amendment was being made so
that when any relief sought against any Government the High
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.11 of 44

Court within whose jurisdiction the cause of action arose
may also have jurisdiction to issue appropriate directions,
writs or orders. It is for this reason that in sub-Article (2) the
word used is “also” which clearly shows that the jurisdiction
conferred by sub-Article (2) in addition to the jurisdiction
conferred on the Courts under Article 226(1). In other
words, with regard to writ petitions against the Union of
India it is not only the High Court within whose jurisdiction
the cause of action arose which would have jurisdiction to
entertain the petition but this Court would also have
jurisdiction to entertain such a petition under Article 226 (1).
The jurisdiction of this Court is not ousted by reason of the
insertion of sub-Article (2) of Article 226.”
(underlining added)

13.

Mr Kaul then referred to the Supreme Court decision in the case of

Navinchandra N. Majithia v. State of Maharashtra and Others: 2000 (7)
SCC 640 to submit that Article 226 (2) widened the width of the area for
issuance of writs by different High Courts. He referred to paragraphs 34 to 37
thereof which chronicle the events leading to the introduction of Article 226
(2).

14.

Mr Kaul then referred to the decision in the case of Khajoor Singh

(supra) to submit that the seat of the Government of India is in Delhi as it is
located in Delhi and that so far as an authority is concerned, there can be no
doubt that if its office is located within the territory of the court, then, since the
writ is to be issued to such an authority, that court would have jurisdiction.
Jurisdiction depends only on the location of the person or authority against
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.12 of 44

whom the writ is sought. It must be remembered that Khajoor Singh's decision
was rendered at a time when Article 226 (2) in its present form was not there
and was based on an interpretation of Article 226 (1) alone in the absence of the
extended meaning given by Article 226 (2) by the introduction of the concept of
cause of action. It is in this context that the Supreme Court, in Khajoor Singh
(supra), held that the view taken in Election Commission, India v. Saka
Venkata Subba Rao: 1953 SCR 1144 and K.S. Rashid & Son v. The Income
Tax Investigation Commission, etc.: 1954 SCR 738 was correct.

The

Supreme Court had held in those decisions that there is a two-fold limitation on
the power of High Courts to issue writs under Article 226, namely, (i) the
power is to be exercised 'throughout the territories in relation to which it
exercises jurisdiction', that is to say, the writs issued by the court cannot run
beyond the territories subject to its jurisdiction and; (ii) the person or authority
to whom the High Court is empowered to issue such writs must be “within
those territories” which clearly implies that they must be amenable to its
jurisdiction either by residence or location within those territories. Mr Kaul
submitted that the first limitation has been done away with, subsequently, by
the introduction of Article 226 (2) which introduces the element of cause of
action. He submitted that prior to the 15th Amendment to the Constitution, the
High Court could only issue writs to persons or authorities or Governments
which were located within the territories of those High Courts, but after the 15 th
Amendment to the Constitution, High Courts could even issue writs to persons,
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.13 of 44

authorities or governments which were not located within their territories
provided the cause of action, in whole or in part, arose within the territory over
which the High Courts normally exercised jurisdiction. He submitted that there
is an apparent conflict between the decisions of the Supreme Court in the case
of Kusum Ingots (supra) and Khajoor Singh (supra) but, this can be easily
reconciled by reference to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
Navinchandra Majithia (supra) which has clarified that the introduction of
Article 226 (2) is to be regarded as a widening of the arena of territorial
jurisdiction of the High Courts. He further submitted that the decision in
Kusum Ingots (supra) was entirely with reference to Article 226 (2), whereas
the decision in Khajoor Singh's case would have bearing only on Article 226
(1).

15.

Mr Kaul, with reference to the Division Bench decision of this

court in the case of Vinod Kumar (supra), submitted that the said decision was
contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court and, in any event, was on
different facts. He submitted that there has been some confusion with regard to
the concept of cause of action. The question of cause of action, according to
Mr Kaul, arises only in the context of Article 226 (2) and has no relevance
under Article 226 (1). If the person, authority or government to whom the writ
is to be issued is located within the territory of a High Court, then the question
of where the cause of action arose is irrelevant. The High Court would have
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.14 of 44

jurisdiction to entertain such writ petitions. However, if the person, authority
or government to whom the writ is to be issued is located outside the normal
territorial limits over which the High Court exercises jurisdiction, then the
question of where the cause of action arose comes into prominence. If the
whole or part of cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the High Court,
then, even if the person, authority or government to whom the writ is to be
issued was outside the jurisdictional territory of the State over which the High
Court presides, a writ could still be issued and a writ petition seeking such a
writ would be maintainable.

16.

On a pointed question as to whom is the writ to be issued in the

present petitions, Mr Kaul replied that insofar as the question of challenge to
para 1744 of the Indian Railways Commercial Manual is concerned, the writ is
to be issued to the Railway Board / Union of India, both of which are located in
Delhi. Insofar as the demands for punitive charges are concerned, the writs are
to be issued to the South East Central Railway which, of course, is not located
in Delhi, but since the demands are based on para 1744 of the Indian Railways
Commercial Manual which have been framed by the Railway Board, this court
would have jurisdiction.

17.

In rejoinder, Ms Mohan reiterated her earlier submissions and also

referred to para 30 of the decision in the case of Kusum Ingots (supra) which
pertains to forum conveniens and the same reads as under:“30. We must, however, remind ourselves that even if a
small part of cause of action arises within the territorial
jurisdiction of the High Court, the same by itself may not be
considered to be a determinative factor compelling the High
Court to decide the matter on merit. In appropriate cases, the
Court may refuse to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction by
invoking the doctrine of forum conveniens. (See Bhagar
Singh Bagga v. Dewan Jagbir Sawhany, AIR 1941 Cal;
Mandal Jalan v. Madanlal,; Bharat Coking Coal Limited v.
Jharia Talkies & Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd.; S.S. Jain & Co. and
Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. (1994) CHN 445; New
Horizon Ltd. v. Union of India, AIR 1994 Del 126).”

In this context, she submitted that the entire record is with the South East
Central Railway, the Headquarters of which are at Bilaspur, Chattisgarh. To
this, Mr Kaul immediately retorted that the concept of forum conveniens is also
relatable to the situs of cause of action and Article 226 (2), whereas he is
invoking the jurisdiction of this court on the basis of Article 226 (1).

18.

In the context of the arguments advanced by the counsel for the

parties, it would be appropriate if the genesis of the High Courts' territorial
jurisdiction under Article 226 is traced from its inception. Article 226 of the
Constitution originally read as under:“226.
(1)
Notwithstanding anything in article
32, every High Court shall have power, throughout the
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.16 of 44

territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction to
issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate
cases any Government, within those territories directions,
orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas
corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and
certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the
rights conferred by part III and for any other purpose.
(2)
The power conferred on a High Court by clause
(1) shall not be in derogation of the power conferred on the
Supreme Court by clause (2) of article 32.”
(underlining added)
This came up for consideration in the case of Election Commission, India v.
Saka Venkata Subba Rao (supra). In that case, the Madras High Court had
issued a writ of prohibition restraining the Election Commission, a statutory
authority located at New Delhi, from enquiring into the alleged disqualification
of the respondent for membership to the Madras Legislative Assembly. The
Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court held that the Madras High Court did
not have the power to issue such a writ. The court observed that “the rule that
cause of action attracts jurisdiction in suits is based on a statutory enactment
and cannot apply to writs issuable under Article 226 which makes no reference
to any cause of action or where it arises, but insists on the presence of the
person or authority 'within the territories' in relation to which the High Court
exercises jurisdiction”. The argument of inconvenience was also not accepted
because the plain meaning of Article 226 was clear. In Hari Vishnu Kamath v.
Syed Ahmed Ishaque & Others: 1955 (1) SCR 1104, a 7 Judge Bench of the
Supreme Court observed that:WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

“jurisdiction to issue writ is co-extensive with the territorial
jurisdiction of the court.”
19.

Two questions were raised before the Supreme Court in the case of

Khajoor Singh (supra) in the following terms:“The two main questions which arise, therefore, are : (i)
whether the Government of India as such can be said to have
a location in a particular place, viz., New Delhi, irrespective
of the fact that its authority extends over all the States and its
officers function throughout India, and (ii) whether there is
any scope for introducing the concept of cause of action as
the basis of exercise of jurisdiction under Art.226.”
The Supreme Court in respect of the first question observed as under:“This brings us to the first question, namely, whether the
Government of India as such can be said to be located at one
place, namely, New Delhi. The main argument in this
connection is that the Government of India is all-pervasive
and is functioning throughout the territory of India and
therefore every High Court has power to issue a writ against
it, as it must be presumed to be located within the territorial
jurisdiction of all State High Courts. This argument in our
opinion confuses the concept of location of a Government
with the concept of its functioning. A Government may be
functioning all over a State or all over India; but it certainly
is not located all over the State or all over India. It is true that
the Constitution has not provided that the seat of the
Government of India will be at New Delhi. That, however,
does not mean that the Government of India as such has no
seat where it is located. It is common knowledge that the seat
of the Government of India is in New Delhi and the
Government as such is located in New Delhi. The absence of
a provision in the Constitution can make no difference to this
fact. What we have to see, therefore, is whether the words of
Art.226 mean that the person or authority to whom a writ is
to be issued has to be resident in or located within the
territories of the High Court issuing the writ ? The relevant
words of Art.226 are these WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.18 of 44

"Every High Court shall have power... to issue to any person
or authority... within those territories....". So far as a natural
person is concerned, there can be no doubt that he can be
within those territories only if he resides therein either
permanently or temporarily. So far as an authority is
concerned, there can be no doubt that if its office is located
therein it must be within the territory. But do these words
mean with respect to an authority that even though its office
is not located within those territories it will be within those
territories because its order may affect persons living in
those territories ? Now it is clear that the jurisdiction
conferred on the High Court by Art. 226 does not depend
upon the residence or location of the person applying to it for
relief; it depends only on the person or authority against
whom a writ is sought being within those territories. It
seems to us therefore that it is not permissible to read in Art.
226 the residence or location of the person affected by the
order passed in order to determine the jurisdiction of the
High Court. That jurisdiction depends on the person or
authority passing the order being within those territories and
the residence or location of the person affected can have no
relevance on the question of the High Court's jurisdiction.
Thus if a person residing or located in Bombay, for example,
is aggrieved by an order passed by an authority located, say,
in Calcutta, the forum in which he has to seek relief is not
the Bombay High Court though the order may affect him in
Bombay but the Calcutta High Court where the authority
passing the order is located. It would, therefore, in our
opinion be wrong to introduce in Art. 226 the concept of the
place where the order passed has effect in order to determine
the jurisdiction of the High Court which can give relief under
Art. 226. The introduction of such a concept may give rise
to confusion and conflict of jurisdictions. ....”
(underlining added)
The Supreme Court also observed as under:“Therefore, the effect of an order by whomsoever it is passed
can have no relevance in determining the jurisdiction of the
High Court which can take action under Art. 226. Now,
functioning of a Government is really nothing other than
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.19 of 44

giving effect to the orders passed by it. Therefore it would
not be right to introduce in Art. 226 the concept of the
functioning of Government when determining the meaning
of the words "any person or authority within those
territories". By introducing the concept of functioning in
these words we shall be creating the same conflict which
would arise if the concept of the place where the order is to
have effect is introduced in Art. 226. There can, therefore,
be no escape from the conclusion that these words in Art.
226 refer not to the place where the Government may be
functioning but only to the place where the person or
authority is either resident or is located. So far therefore as a
natural person is concerned, he is within those territories if
he resides there permanently or temporarily. So far as an
authority (other than a Government) is concerned, it is within
the territories if its office is located there. So far as a
Government is concerned it is within the territories only if its
seat is within those territories.”
(underlining added)
The first question was, therefore, conclusively answered by the Supreme Court
in the following manner:“The seat of a Government is sometimes mentioned in the
Constitutions of various countries but many a time the seat
is not so mentioned. But whether the seat of a Government
is mentioned in the Constitution or not, there is undoubtedly
a seat from which the Government as such functions as a
fact. What Art. 226 requires is residence or location as a
fact and if therefore there is a seat from which the
Government functions as a fact even though that seat is not
mentioned in the Constitution the High Court within whose
territories that seat is located will be the High Court having
jurisdiction under Art. 226 so far as the orders of the
Government as such are concerned. Therefore, the view
taken in Election Commission, India v. Saka Venkata
Subba Rao ([1953] S.C.R. 1144.) and K. S. Rashid and Son
v. The Income-tax Investigation Commission ([1954]
S.C.R. 738.) that there is two-fold limitation on the power
of the High Court to issue writs etc. under Art. 226, namely,
(i) the power is to be exercised 'throughout the territories in
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.20 of 44

relation to which it exercises jurisdiction', that is to say, the
writs issued by the Court cannot run beyond the territories
subject to its jurisdiction, and (ii) the person or authority to
whom the High Court is empowered to issue such writs
must be "within those territories" which clearly implies that
they must be amenable to its jurisdiction either by residence
or location within those territories, is the correct one.”
(underlining added)
As regards the second question in respect of cause of action, the Supreme Court
held:“Article 226 as it stands does not refer anywhere to the
accrual of cause of action and to the jurisdiction of the
High Court depending on the place where the cause of
action accrues being within its territorial jurisdiction.
Proceedings under Art. 226 are not suits; they provide for
extraordinary remedies by a special procedure and give
powers of correction to the High Court over persons and
authorities and these special powers have to be exercised
within the limits set for them. These two limitations have
already been indicated by us above and one of them is that
the person or authority concerned must be within the
territories over which the High Court exercises jurisdiction.
Is it possible then to overlook this constitutional limitation
and say that the High Court can issue a writ against a
person or authority even though it may not be within its
territories simply because the cause of action has arisen
within those territories ? It seems to us that it would be
going in the face of the express provision in Art. 226 and
doing away with an express limitation contained therein if
the concept of cause of action were to be introduced in
it......
....The concept of cause of action cannot in our opinion be
introduced in Art. 226, for by doing so we shall be doing
away with the express provision contained therein which
requires that the person or authority to whom the writ is to
be issued should be resident in or located within the
territories over which the High Court has jurisdiction. It is
true that this may result in some inconvenience to person
residing far away from New Delhi who are aggrieved by
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.21 of 44

some order of the Government of India as such, and that
may be a reason for making a suitable constitutional
amendment in Art. 226. But the argument of
inconvenience, in our opinion, cannot affect the plain
language of Art. 226, nor can the concept of the place of
cause of action be introduced into it for that would do away
with the two limitations on the powers of the High Court
contained in it.”
(underlining added)
The position of law as obtaining after the decision of the Supreme Court in
Khajoor Singh (supra) was that the place where the cause of action arose had
no relevance for determining the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court. The
only thing that was relevant was where the person, authority or government to
whom the writ was to be issued was located. If the location was within the
territory over which the High Court exercised jurisdiction, then such High
Court would have territorial jurisdiction, but if the person, authority or
government was located outside the territory over which the High Court had the
jurisdiction, then a writ petition in respect of such person, authority or
government was not maintainable before such High Court. It is interesting to
observe that there was an indication given in the decision in Khajoor Singh
(supra) with regard to the inconvenience argument that “if any inconvenience
is felt on account of this interpretation of Article 226, the remedy seems to be a
constitutional amendment.”

20.

After the decision in the case of Khajoor Singh (supra), the 15th

Amendment to the Constitution introduced clause (1-A) to Article 226 which
was subsequently renumbered as clause (2) by the Constitution 42nd
Amendment and which now reads as under:“226 (2). The power conferred by Clause (1) to issue
directions, orders or writs to any Government authority or
person may also be exercised by any High Court exercising
jurisdiction in relation to the territories within which the
cause of action, wholly or in part, arises for the exercise of
such power, notwithstanding that the seat of such
Government or authority or the residence of such person is
not within those territories.”
(underlining added)
This amendment introduced the concept of cause of action which the Supreme
Court had earlier refused to read into Article 226 (1). However, this does not
mean that the concept of territorial jurisdiction under Article 226 (1) was
supplanted by Article 226 (2). The decision of the Supreme Court in Election
Commission, India v. Saka Venkata Subba Rao (supra) and Khajoor Singh
(supra) were rendered in the context of Article 226 (1) and in the absence of
any provisions of the nature of Article 226 (2). The introduction of Article 226
(2), as observed in the case of Navinchandra N. Majithia (supra) widened the
width of the area in respect of writs issued by different High Courts. In fact,
Article 226(2) can be construed as an exception to the limitations mentioned in
Election Commission, India (supra) and approved in Khajoor Singh (supra).
The power conferred on the High Courts under Article 226 could now be as

WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

well exercised by any High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to the
territories within which the cause of action, in whole or in part, arose and it was
no matter that the seat of the authority concerned was outside the territorial
limits of the jurisdiction of that High Court. This distinction between the
provisions of Article 226 (1) and 226 (2) has to be maintained. While Article
226 (1) empowers a High Court to issue writs to a person, authority or
government within its territorial limits de hors the question of where the cause
of action arose, Article 226 (2) enables High Courts to issue writs to persons,
authorities or governments located beyond its territorial limits provided a cause
of action arises (in whole or in part) within the territorial extent of the said High
Court. What Article 226 (2) has done is to extend the jurisdiction of the High
Courts beyond their territories in cases where part of the cause of action arises
within its territories. Therefore, Article 226 (2) extends and does not supplant
Article 226 (1). The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of State of
Rajasthan and Ors. v. Swaika Properties and Anr.:1985 (3) SCC 217, Oil and
Natural Gas Commission v. Utpal Kumar Basu and Ors.: 1994 (4) SCC 711
as well as Adani Exports (supra) and Kusum Ingots (supra) all pertain to
Article 226 (2) of the Constitution and have reference to the question of cause
of action. It is true, as observed in Kusum Ingots (supra), that the decision in
Khajoor Singh (supra) would not be relevant insofar as the argument of cause
of action is concerned inasmuch as Khajoor Singh (supra) was a decision
rendered prior to the 15th Amendment of the Constitution. But, this does not

19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.24 of 44

mean that what Khajoor Singh (supra) has decided in respect of Article 226 (1)
can be whittled down or ignored. That is a decision of seven judges of the
Supreme Court and, with regard to the provisions of Article 226 (1), it is
definitive.

An explanation of the above table is necessary.

For the purpose of

demonstrating the territorial jurisdiction of two High Courts in State 'A' and

WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.25 of 44

State 'B', there are four possible situations2 which have been set out in the table
above. At S.No. 1, the person, authority or government to whom the writ is to
be issued is located in State 'A'. The cause of action has also arisen in whole or
in part in State 'A'. Therefore, it is the High Court of State 'A' alone which has
jurisdiction both under Article 226 (1) as well as under Article 226 (2). In the
case of S.No.2, the person, authority or government is located in State 'A', but
the cause of action has arisen (in whole or in part) in State 'B', the territorial
jurisdiction for the filing of a writ petition would lie both with the High Court
of State 'A' and of State 'B'.

The High Court of State 'A' would have

jurisdiction by virtue of Article 226 (1) inasmuch as the location of the person,
authority or government to whom the writ is to be issued is within that State.
The High Court of State 'B' would have jurisdiction because, although the
location of the person, authority or government is in State 'A', the cause of
action (in whole or in part) has arisen in State 'B'. The next case is given under
S.No.3. Here the location of the person, authority or government is in State 'B',
but the cause of action has arisen in State 'A'. In such a situation, both the High
Courts of State 'A' and 'B' would have jurisdiction. But the High Court of State
'A' would have jurisdiction under Article 226 (2) on account of cause of action
and the High Court of State 'B' would have jurisdiction by virtue of Article 226
(1) on account of location. Lastly, at S.No.4 is a case which is the inverse of
2 On the assumption that there are two States 'A' and 'B' and that the seat of Government or location of
the Authority or the residence of the person to whom the writ is to be issued is in either State 'A' or
State 'B'. It is also assumed that cause of action also arises either in State 'A' or State 'B'.
Relaxation of these assumptions would not make any difference to the analysis.

19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.26 of 44

the situation in S.No.1, both the location and the cause of action arise in State
'B'. Therefore, it would be the High Court of State 'B' alone which would have
jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition both under Article 226 (1) and 226 (2).

22.

This clarifies the position with regard to the territorial jurisdiction

of a High Court in respect of a writ petition.

23.

In Kusum Ingots (supra), the Supreme Court was considering the

question whether the seat of Parliament or the Legislature of a State would be a
relevant factor for determining the territorial jurisdiction of the High Court to
entertain a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The
facts of the case were that a company registered under the Indian Companies
Act having its registered office at Mumbai obtained a loan from the Bhopal
Branch of the State Bank of India. A notice for repayment of the said loan was
issued from Bhopal in terms of the provisions of the Securitisation and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act,
2002. Questioning the vires of the said Act, the writ petition was filed before
the Delhi High Court by the said company which was dismissed by the High
Court on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction. It was contended on
behalf of the company that the High Court at Delhi had the requisite
jurisdiction because the constitutionality of a Parliamentary Act was in

WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.27 of 44

question.

While repelling this argument, the Supreme Court made the

following observations:“19.
Passing of a legislation by itself in our opinion
do not confer any such right to file a writ petition unless a
cause of action arises therefor.
20.
A distinction between a legislation and
executive action should be borne in mind while determining
the said question.
21.
A parliamentary legislation when receives the
assent of the President of India and published in an Official
Gazette, unless specifically excluded, will apply to the
entire territory of India. If passing of a legislation gives
rise to a cause of action, a writ petition questioning the
constitutionality thereof can be filed in any High Court of
the country. It is not so done because a cause of action will
arise only when the provisions of the Act or some of them
which were implemented shall give rise to civil or evil
consequences to the petitioner. A writ court, it is well
settled would not determine a constitutional question in
vacuum.
22.
The court must have the requisite territorial
jurisdiction. An order passed on writ petition questioning
the constitutionality of a Parliamentary Act whether interim
or final keeping in view the provisions contained in Clause
(2) of Article 226 of the Constitution of India, will have
effect throughout the territory of India subject of course to
the applicability of the Act.”
(underlining added)
24.

The above observations indicate three things. Firstly, the passing

of a legislation does not in itself give rise to a cause of action. Secondly, no
writ can be entertained and no constitutional question can be determined in a
vacuum, that is to say, in the absence of a cause of action. Thirdly, an order
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.28 of 44

passed in a writ petition questioning the constitutionality of a Parliamentary Act
will have effect throughout the territory of India. No exception can be taken to
these observations. But, they must be understood in the proper context. The
first two observations indicate that before a petitioner approaches a High Court
for the issuance of a writ, he must have a cause of action. The mere passing of
a legislation does not provide a cause of action in itself. Unless the effect of
the legislation is felt by the petitioner in the form of some consequences
personal to him, he would not have a cause of action to challenge the
legislation. And, unless the petition is founded on a cause of action, the High
Court would not entertain the petition in a “vacuum”. This is all that is said in
paragraphs 19 to 22 of the decision in Kusum Ingots (supra). In my respectful
view, so far as these observations go, nothing is said about the place where the
cause of action arises. They relate merely to the circumstance that there must
be “a” cause of action before a legislation can be questioned in Court.

25.

However, the Supreme Court also made the following observations

with regard to the situs of office of the respondents:“23. A writ petition, however, questioning the
constitutionality of a Parliamentary Act shall not be
maintainable in the High Court of Delhi only because the
seat of the Union of India is in Delhi. (See Abdul Kafi Khan
v. Union of India and Ors.:AIR 1979 Cal 354)

State or authorities empowered to make subordinate

19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.29 of 44

legislation would not by itself constitute any cause of action
or cases arising. In other words, framing of a statute,
statutory rule or issue of an executive order or instruction
would not confer jurisdiction upon a court only because of
the situs of the office of the maker thereof.”
(underlining added)
The observation that 'a writ petition questioning the constitutionality of a
Parliamentary Act shall not be maintainable in the High Court of Delhi only
because the seat of the Union of India is in Delhi' is apparently based upon the
decision of a single judge of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Abdul Kafi
Khan (supra). Though the constitutional validity of a Parliamentary Act was
not in challenge in that case, an examination of the said decision reveals that
the petitioner therein had impeached the charge-sheet, enquiry report and show
cause notice issued to him by Railway authorities in Bihar in the course of
disciplinary proceedings. The court held that it would not have territorial
jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition merely because the head office of the
Railway was located in Calcutta when the cause of action (in whole or in part)
did not arise within its territorial jurisdiction.

26.

Furthermore, the observation must be construed as meaning that

merely because the seat of the Union of India is in Delhi, a writ petition cannot
be filed in the Delhi High Court challenging the constitutionality of a Central
Act unless a cause of action has arisen for the same. As I see it, it does not
matter where the cause of action arises. Once it arises, Delhi High Court would
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.30 of 44

have territorial jurisdiction. It is of course true that if the cause of action arises
(in whole or in part) in another State, the Central Act could be challenged in the
High Court of that State also.

27.

With regard to the 'conflict', as Mr Kaul termed it, between Kusum

Ingots (supra) and Khajoor Singh (supra), there is no doubt that if there were
such a 'conflict', the decision in Khajoor Singh (supra) would prevail as it was
of a larger bench. But, it must be remembered that what Khajoor Singh
(supra) held with regard to the place where an order has effect was in the
context of the 'cause of action' argument. Clearly, the place where the cause of
action arose was not a relevant consideration then (i.e., prior to the 15th
Amendment). That part of Khajoor Singh (supra) with regard 'the place of
cause of action' argument has no relevance now in view of Article 226 (2)
introduced subsequently. But, this does not mean that what the Supreme Court
held in Khajoor Singh (supra) and the earlier decisions with regard to Article
226 (1) has been washed away.

The only difference made by the 15th

Amendment is that location of the seat of Government or authority or residence
of the person to whom the writ is to be issued, is not the sole criterion for
conferring territorial jurisdiction and writs may also issue to governments,
authorities or persons outside the territory of a High Court provided the cause
of action (in whole or in part) arises within the limits of the normal territorial
extent of the High Court. Not a single decision of the Supreme Court has been

19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.31 of 44

pointed out which goes to the extent of saying that Khajoor Singh (supra) has
been superseded in its entirety by the 15th Amendment. The change, as pointed
out above, is that location is not the sole criterion and place of cause of action
may also confer jurisdiction. It cannot be construed that place of cause of
action alone will confer territorial jurisdiction. If it were to be so construed, it
would mean that Article 226 (2) was not in extension of the powers under
Article 226 (1) but in annihilation thereof. That was certainly not the intent.

28.

It would be fruitful to refer to the Statement of Objects and

Reasons appended to the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Bill, 1962. With
regard to the amendment in Article 226, the following statement is relevant:“Under the existing Article 226 of the Constitution, the
only High Court which has jurisdiction with respect to the
Central Government is the Punjab High Court. This
involves considerable hardship to litigants from distant
places. It is, therefore, proposed to amend Article 226 so
that when any relief is sought against any Government,
authority or person for any action taken, the High Court
within whose jurisdiction the cause of action arise may also
have jurisdiction to issue appropriate directions, orders or
writs.”
(underlining added)
The crucial words are “only” and “may also”. The object was not to take away
the jurisdiction of the High Courts which they had prior to the introduction of
the amendment but, to enable other High Courts to also have jurisdiction
provided the cause of action arose within their normal jurisdictional precincts.

The same view is taken in the celebrated text—Constitutional Law

of India: H.M. Seervai: Fourth Edition: Volume 2, pages 1598:“The newly added sub-Article (1A) to Article 226 226
introduces an additional basis of jurisdiction, namely, the
whole or in part of a cause of action arising within the
jurisdiction of a court. This is clear from the use of the
words, 'the power conferred by clause (1) ... may also be
exercised...' Therefore jurisdiction to issue writs can be
exercised (i) by a court within whose jurisdiction a person
or authority (including, in appropriate cases, any
government) resides or is located, and (ii) also by a court
within whose jurisdiction the cause of action wholly or in
part arises, notwithstanding that the seat of such
government or authority or the residence of such person is
not within those territories.”

Recently in Alchemist Limited and Another v. State Bank of

Sikkim and Others: JT 2007 (4) SC 474, the Supreme Court traced the
legislative history of Article 226 (2) of the Constitution. It observed that the
effect of the decisions in the case of Election Commission, India v. Saka
Venkata Rao (supra) and Khajoor Singh v. Union of India (supra) was that no
High Court other than the High Court of Punjab (before the establishment of
the High Court of Delhi) had jurisdiction to issue any direction, order or writ to
the Union of India, because the seat of the Government of India was located in
New Delhi. Cause of action was a concept totally irrelevant and alien for
conferring jurisdiction on High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution.
The Court further observed that the earlier decisions had repelled the attempt to
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.33 of 44

import such a concept.

It is in these circumstances that Article 226 was

amended by the Constitution (15th amendment) Act, 1963. In Alchemist Ltd.
(supra), the Supreme Court also referred to the Statement of Objects and
Reasons and highlighted and emphasised the following words:“.......... the High Court within whose jurisdiction the cause
of action arise may also have jurisdiction to issue
appropriate directions, orders or writs.”
In this background the Supreme Court held:“22.
The effect of the amendment was that the
accrual of cause of action was made an additional ground to
confer jurisdiction on a High Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution.”
(underlining added)
Thus, it is clear that Article 226 (2) is in addition to Article 226 (1), implying
thereby that the High Court within whose territorial limits the person, authority
or government is located would have jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition
directed against any of them irrespective of the fact as to where cause of action
arose, provided that there was a cause of action for filing a writ petition.
Additionally, High Courts within whose limits the person, authority or
government to whom the writ is to be issued, is not located can also issue writs
to such person, authority or government provided the cause of action, in whole
or in part, arose within their territories.

Furthermore, in Mosaraf Hossain Khan v. Bhageeratha Engg.

Ltd: (2006) 3 SCC 658, the Supreme Court explained what was held by them in
Kusum Ingots (supra) in the following words:“In that case it was clearly held that only because the High
Court within whose jurisdiction a legislation is passed, it
would not have the sole territorial jurisdiction but all the
High Courts where cause of action arises, will have
jurisdiction.”
(underlining added)
By the use of the word 'sole', the Supreme Court clearly meant that the High
Court within whose jurisdiction a legislation is passed would have jurisdiction
though not necessarily the sole jurisdiction as other High Courts where the
cause of action arose would also have jurisdiction. So, Navinchandra N.
Majithia (supra), Kusum Ingots (supra), Mosaraf Hossain Khan (supra) and
Alchemist Limited (supra) all say that Article 226 (2) is an extension of or in
addition to the jurisdiction conferred under Article 226(1). The “discordant”
note that was sought to be highlighted by counsel in the case of Kusum Ingots
(supra) is only virtual, not real. Its true meaning having been explained in
Mosaraf Hossain Khan (supra).

The decision of a Division Bench of this Court in the Case of GD

Vinod Kumar (supra) has to be read in the light of the interpretation of Article
226 (1) and 226 (2) as given by the Supreme Court. That interpretation has
already been explained above. It may also be pointed out that Mr Kaul was
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.35 of 44

right in submitting that the said decision turned on its own facts and was
inapplicable to the situation at hand. This would be clear from examining para
15 of the said decision which has been extracted earlier in this judgment
wherein the Division Bench observed that they were dealing with cases where
the forces were operating under special statutes like the Army Act, CRPF Act,
CISF Act and BSF Act and that these Acts had inbuilt remedial systems as they
provide for statutory appeal provisions and representations. Any order passed
could be complained of before a higher / appellate authority under the
provisions of the said Acts. As such, it was held, in the event such authorities
were located beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the Court and the petitioner
had exhausted such remedies, then he could hardly invoke the jurisdiction of
the Court on the ground that the central or main office or seat of the department
was located within the jurisdiction of the Court.

This finding clearly

demonstrates that the case before the Division Bench was decided on its special
facts, which have no application to the present petitions.

It may be also

mentioned that the decision in Mosaraf Hossain Khan (supra) and Alchemist
Ltd. (supra) were not noticed by the Division Bench.

Ms Mohan had placed reliance on the concept of forum conveniens

to submit that, in any event, the Delhi High Court was not a 'convenient' forum.
This is an argument different and distinct from the 'competency' argument. The
application of the principle of forum conveniens assumes that the Court has
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

jurisdiction. In Kusum Ingots (supra), the Supreme Court also underlined the
use of the doctrine of forum conveniens and observed that “in appropriate
cases, the court may refuse to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction by invoking
the doctrine of forum conveniens”.3 It is apparent that forum conveniens was
one of the factors which was taken into account by the Supreme Court in
Kusum Ingots (supra) with regard to upholding the decision of the Delhi High
Court in dismissing the writ petition. But, invocation of the doctrine of forum
conveniens or forum non conveniens (as it is more common and
interchangeably referred to) presupposes that the court refusing to entertain a
case on the basis of this doctrine, otherwise has jurisdiction. This is another
indication that in Kusum Ingots (supra), the Supreme Court did not take the
view that the Delhi High Court did not at all have any jurisdiction to entertain
the writ petition. But, that it was not an appropriate forum inasmuch as nothing
had happened in Delhi apart from the passing of the legislation by Parliament.

34.

On the basis of the above discussion, it can be safely said that

Kusum Ingots (supra), was definitive with regard to the following:-

3 A similar observation is to be found in Mosaraf Hossain Khan v. Bhageeratha Engg. Ltd: (2006) 3
SCC 658. The Supreme Court observed:“The High Courts, however, must remind themselves about the doctrine of forum
non conveniens also.”

(1)

Passing of a legislation by itself does not confer any right to file a
writ petition unless a cause of action arises therefor.4

[See:

Kusum Ingots (supra): para 19].
(2)

Situs of office of Parliament, legislature of a State or authorities
empowered to make subordinate legislation would not by itself
constitute any cause of action.5 [See Kusum Ingots (supra): para
26].

(3)

The High Court within whose jurisdiction a legislation is passed,
would not have the sole territorial jurisdiction but all the High
Courts where cause of action arises, will have jurisdiction. [See:
Mosaraf Hossain Khan (supra): para 26].

(4)

The question as to whether the court has a territorial jurisdiction
to entertain a writ petition, must be arrived at on the basis of
averments made in the petition, the truth or otherwise thereof
being immaterial. [See: Kusum Ingots (supra): para 12 with
reference to ONGC v. Utpal Kumar Basu: 1994 (4) SCC 711].

4 Accrual of a cause of action is a pre-condition for filing a writ petition. But, this has nothing to do
with where the cause of action arose. With regard to both sub-Article (1) and sub-Article (2) of
Article 226, accrual of a cause of action is a relevant and essential factor. However, where Article
226(1) is applicable, the place where the cause of action arose is irrelevant. It is relevant only in the
case of Article 226 (2) because that is an exception to the limitations under Article 226(1).

When a part of the cause of action arises within one or the other
High Court, it will be for the petitioner to choose his forum.

In appropriate cases, the court may refuse to exercise its
discretionary jurisdiction by invoking the doctrine of forum
conveniens. [See: Kusum Ingots (supra): para 30].

35.

Some comment is called for on the issue of forum conveniens (or

forum non conveniens as it is more commonly known). The principle was
stated by Lord Kinnear in Sim v. Robinow: (1892) 19 K. 665 thus:“The general rule was stated by the late Lord President in
Clements v. Macaulay, 4 Macph. 593, in the following
terms: 'In cases in which jurisdiction is competently
founded, a court has no discretion whether it shall exercise
its jurisdiction or not, but is bound to award the justice
which a suiter comes to ask. Judex tenetur impertiri
judicium suum;6and the plea7 under consideration must not
be stretched so as to interfere with the general principle of
jurisprudence.' And therefore the plea can never be
sustained unless the court is satisfied that there is some
other tribunal, having competent jurisdiction, in which the
case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the
parties and for the ends of justice... In all these cases there
was one indispensable element present when the court gave
effect to the plea of forum non conveniens, namely, that the
court was satisfied that there was another court in which the
action ought to be tried as being more convenient for all the
parties, and more suitable for the ends of justice.”
6 a judge must exercise jurisdiction in every case in which he is seized of it.

36.

In a recent decision of the House of Lords [Tehrani v. Secy of

State for the Home Department: [2006] UKHL 47] it was observed:“The doctrine of forum non conveniens is a good example
of a reason, established by judicial authority, why a court
should not exercise a jurisdiction that (in the strict sense) it
possesses. Issues of forum non conveniens do not arise
unless there are competing courts each of which has
jurisdiction (in the strict sense) to deal with the subject
matter of the dispute. It seems to me plain that if one of the
two competing courts lacks jurisdiction (in the strict sense)
a plea of forum on conveniens could never be a bar to the
exercise by the other court of its jurisdiction.”
Thus, the doctrine of forum non conveniens can only be invoked where the
court deciding not to exercise jurisdiction, has jurisdiction to decide the case.
The U.S. Supreme Court also held in Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert: 330 U.S. 501
that “[I] ndeed, the doctrine of forum non conveniens can never apply if there
is absence of jurisdiction or mistake of venue”.

In this very decision (viz. Gulf Oil Corp.) the doctrine is stated as follows:“The principle of forum non conveniens is simply that a
court may resist imposition upon its jurisdiction even where
jurisdiction is authorised by the letter of a general venue
statute.
These statutes are drawn with a necessary
generality and usually give a plaintiff a choice of courts, so
that he may be quite sure of some place in which to pursue
his remedy. But the open door may admit those who seek
not simply justice but perhaps justice blended with some
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,

harassment. A plaintiff sometimes is under temptation to
resort to a strategy of forcing the trial at a most
inconvenient place for an adversary, even at some
inconvenience to himself.”
37.

From the above discussion, it is clear that the doctrine of forum non

conveniens can only be invoked where the court deciding not to exercise
jurisdiction, has jurisdiction in the strict sense. So, if the Supreme Court directs
the High Courts as it did in the case of Kusum Ingots (supra) and Mosaraf
Hossain Khan (supra) to be mindful of the doctrine of forum non conveniens,
the same would clearly be applicable only in cases where the High Court
otherwise has jurisdiction. The argument of forum non conveniens cannot be
raised in conjunction with the argument of lack of jurisdiction. It is also
worthwhile to note that in Om Prakash Srivastava v. Union of India and
Another: (2006) 6 SCC 207, the Supreme Court did not find favour with the
approach of the High Court in not dealing with the question as to whether it had
or did not have jurisdiction and by merely observing that the Court may have
jurisdiction but the issues could be more effectively dealt with by another High
Court. The Supreme Court while remanding the matter to the High Court made
the following observations:“18.
In the instant case the High Court has not dealt
with the question as to whether it had jurisdiction to deal
with the writ petitioners. It only observed that the Delhi
High Court may have jurisdiction, but the issues relating to
conditions of prisoners in the State of U. P. can be more
effectively dealt with by the Allahabad High Court. As
noted supra, there were two grievances by the appellant. But
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

Page No.41 of 44

only one of them i.e the alleged lack of medical facilities has
been referred to by the High Court. It was open to the Delhi
high Court to say that no part of the cause of action arose
within the territorial jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court.
The High Court in the impugned order does not say so. On
the contrary, it says that jurisdiction may be there, but the
Allahabad High Court can deal with the matter more
effectively. That is certainly not a correct way to deal with
the writ petition. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned
order of the High Court and remit the matter to it for fresh
hearing on merits. .........”
38.

It must also be kept in mind that the doctrine of forum non

conveniens is essentially a common law doctrine originating from admiralty
cases have trans-national implications. It is clear that the doctrine of forum non
conveniens is only available when a Court has the jurisdiction but the
respondent is able to establish the existence of an adequate alternative forum.
In this context, the doctrine of forum non conveniens would be appropriate only
when an adequate alternative forum is available but again this doctrine is a
common law doctrine which cannot override statutory or constitutional
provisions.

39.

In the light of the discussion above, it has now to be determined as

to whether in the present case this Court has territorial jurisdiction to entertain
the writ petitions. As noticed above, the question as to whether the Court has
territorial jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition has to be arrived at on the basis
of the averments made in the petition, the truth or otherwise thereof being
WP(C)2103/07, 10480/2005, 10930/2005, 13144/2005,
19958/2005, 20189/2005, 2177/2007

immaterial. [see Kusum Ingots (supra) and ONGC v. Utpal Kumar Basu
(supra)]. It has been averred in the petitions that paragraph 1744 of the Indian
Railways Commercial Manual, which is an executive instruction issued by the
Railway Board, is the root cause for the raising of the punitive demands, which
are challenged in this petition. Mr Kaul submitted that if paragraph 1744 had
not existed then the demands challenged herein would not have been raised. He
submits that paragraph 1744 is violative of Section 73 and 79 of the Railways
Act, 1989. Without going into the question of truth or otherwise of these
averments and without examining the merits of the challenge to paragraph 1744
of the Indian Railways Commercial Manual, it is clear that the challenge exists
and that the said paragraph 1744 forms part of the Indian Railways Commercial
Manual, which was issued by the Railway Board at New Delhi. A writ striking
down the said paragraph would have to be issued to the Railway Board which is
in New Delhi.

Therefore, from the standpoint of Article 226 (1) of the

Constitution, this Court would have jurisdiction inasmuch as the authority to
whom the writ is to be issued is located within the normal territorial limits of
this Court. It is true that if the case rested only on a challenge to the demands
de hors the question of validity of para 1744 then, only Article 226(2) would be
applicable and this Court would not have territorial jurisdiction as no part of the
cause of action has arisen in Delhi. But, that is not the case.

to entertain the writ petitions. A separate order is being passed for proceeding
with the petitions on merits.
