Page No.1 of 9

Singh stated that his daughter was being continuously harassed
for dowry. That his daughter came under mental stress due to
persistent harassment. That his daughter used to be beaten.
4.

The statement is in question answer form. It reads as

under :“Q.

What is your name?

Ans. Devender Pal Singh.
Q.

What's your relation with deceased Manisha?

Ans. She was my elder daughter.
Q.
When was Manisha married?
Ans. She was married on 10.12.2000. Manisha has a
daughter aged about 3 years.
Q.

Was the marriage of Anil and Manisha arranged

or love marriage?
Ans. It was an arranged marriage which took place
with the approval of both the families.

Q.

How and when you received the information of

this incident?
Ans. Today evening at about 3.30 p.m we all went to
Ram Mandir near our house when my son-in-law Amit
called my son Gaurav on mobile and

found that

Manisha is no more and that you should come.
Q.

What happened later on?

Ans. Within 8-10 minutes of said call we reached the
house of her in-laws. Till that time police had
Bail Application No.1239/2007

also
Page No.2 of 9

reached. Manisha was lying on bed in the bedroom
and she was dead. Manisha's in-laws were also
present in the house at that time in other room.
Q.

Were Manisha's in-laws used to harass her for

dowry?
Ans. Yes, they used to demand cash every time and
we used to give according to our competence. About
10-15 days ago, Rs.5 lakhs was demanded, which we
could not pay.

These people used to harass her in

every manner and used to threaten that we will turn
you out of the home.
Q.

Were they used to fight and beat her?

Ans. Yes, they used to beat Manisha every time.
About 20-22 days ago, next day to Holi, Manisha's
husband slapped her, which was reported to police
also.

Besides, this information was given to police

which should be in the records of Local Police.
Q.

Do you think that Manisha committed suicide?

Ans: Manisha was a brave girl.

Therfore I think that

she had not committed suicide but was killed.
Q.

Who do you think were involved in the said

incident?
Ans. I am suspicious that Manisha's husband (Amit
Wadhwa),

Father-in-law

Mother-in-law

(Beena

neighbour.

All

these

people

in

collusion with each other have killed Manisha.
Q.

Do you want any action?

Ans. Yes I want that strict action be taken against
them.
Q.

Do you want to say anything?

Ans. Manisha was kept in immense mental pressure
due to which she used to suffer paralytic attack. I do
not want to say any thing.”
5.

Supplementary statement of Devender Pal Singh was

recorded on 26.4.2007. On said date statement of the brother of
the deceased as also her mother was recorded by the police.
6.

As per the version put forth by the petitioners it is

stated that their son married Manisha as the two had decided to
get married. That the petitioners had no objection to the
marriage.

That immediately after marriage, Manisha started

compelling her husband to reside separately from his parents.
That she started demanding partition of the family property so
that she and her husband could separate. That she and their son

Bail Application No.1239/2007

Page No.4 of 9

shifted out to an independent flat after 3 months of the marriage.
That after 10-11 months the couple came back and apologized for
leaving the petitioners. But soon thereafter she, i.e. Manisha as
also their son started demanding their share in the family
property.

That Manisha used to extend threat that if her

demands were not satisfied she would commit suicide.

7.

Petitioners relied upon a communication sent by them

to various police officials on 25.2.2005. Petitioners produced for
perusal of the court a copy of the communication sent by them on
25.2.2005 evidencing either receipt thereof by different police
departments or posting thereof by registered post.
8.

Petitioners further relied upon a letter dated 5.3.2007

addressed by Manisha to the SHO, P.S. Vasant Vihar wherein she
wrote as under :“ SHO,
Vasant vihar
New Delhi.

Date: 5/3/2007

Dear Sir,
With reference to our talk with SI, Sh.Randhir Singh Ji,
I would like to say that we will settle the issue/dispute
among us, and please no further action or report need
to be taken. The telephone call was made by my
Father-in-law.
Thanking you,
Your's Faithfully,

Petitioners

further

relied

upon

a

supplementary

statement made by Devender Pal Singh to the police on
26.4.2007 as also statements recorded by the police under
Section 161 Cr.P.C. as made by the brother and the mother of the
deceased.
10.

Petitioners relied upon the 3 statements wherein

parents and brother of the deceased told the police that in-laws of
Manisha used to taunt her of being a dark complexioned girl (kali
kaluti).
11.

In a nutshell, Shri R.N.Mittal, learned senior counsel for

the petitioners urged that the statements made by the father,
mother and the brother of the deceased to the police on
26.4.2007 evidenced that real grievance was that Manisha was
being ill treated due to her physical features and not on account
of dowry demand. Learned counsel further submitted that letter
dated 25.2.2005 written by the petitioner to various police
authorities

was

proof

that

Manisha

was

blackmailing

the

petitioners to part company with her husband's share in the
family property. According to learned counsel for the petitioners,
far from being aggressors, petitioners were on the receiving end.
12.

Advancing the argument further, by placing reliance

upon letter dated 5.3.2007 addressed to the SHO by Manisha,
counsel stated that a few days prior to 5.3.2007, their son and
Manisha had a fight.

Since petitioners were troubled by the

conduct of their son and their daughter-in-law, first petitioner

Bail Application No.1239/2007

Page No.6 of 9

gave information to the local police about the fight between his
son and his daughter-in-law. Therefrom, an inference could be
drawn as to what was the state of affairs in the house.
13.

Learned counsel for the State has not disputed that the

incident in respect whereof police was summoned and Manisha
vide her letter dated 5.3.2007 had requested police to close the
issue, was reported to the police by the first petitioner.
14.

Before proceeding to analyse the submissions made by

learned counsel for the petitioners, a fact needs to be noted.
15.

11 persons have been named by the father of the

complainant as the perpetrators of the crime. They are :16.

i) Husband, ii)

Father-in-law, iii) Mother-in-law, iv)

Paternal grandmother, v) 4 Paternal aunts, vi) sister, vii) brotherin-law and even a neighbour Smt. Malhotra.
17.

Virtually the entire extended family of the in laws of

deceased Manisha has been implicated.
18.

In the decision reported as AIR 2000 SC 2324 Kans Raj

Vs. State of Punjab the Supreme Court noted and also deprecated
the tendency of falsely roping in all relations of the in-laws of the
deceased in matters of dowry death. Their Lordships cautioned
that if this trend was not discouraged it would affect the case of
the prosecution even against the real culprits.
19.

It is unfortunate that the police continues to encourage

naming of all and sundry while recording statements.
20.

As would be evidenced from the questions put by the

Bail Application No.1239/2007

Page No.7 of 9

learned SDM to the father of the deceased, suggestions have
been put to the father of the deceased while eliciting information.
21.

Where was the need to specifically put questions

whether Manishsa was being harassed for dowry and whether she
was being beaten up.
22.

The job of the SDM was to record a statement

voluntarily made and not to lead the maker of the statement into
giving pre-determined and designed statements.
23.

What would a neighbour gain by dowry harassment?

Prima facie, nothing.
24.

Yet in spite thereof, even a poor neighbour has been

dragged into the controversy.
25.

Letter dated 5.3.2007 written by Manisha as also the

admitted fact that police was summoned by first petitioner
evidences that Manisha and her husband had a fight which
required police to be summoned. This shows the anxiety of the
petitioners to stay clear of the possible consequences of the
discord between their son and their daughter-in-law. This, read
co-jointly with the letter dated 25.2.2005 written to the police
authorities by the petitioners further reinforces the claim of the
petitioners that they wanted to stay clear of any involvement on
account of they being the father-in-law and mother-in-law of
Manisha.
26.

I find force in the lament made by learned counsel for

the petitioners who while concluding submissions, posed a

Bail Application No.1239/2007

Page No.8 of 9

question : what else can the parents of a boy do if they find
matrimonial problems created when daughter-in-law comes to the
house, other than to fore warn the police authorities?
27.

No doubt, an unnatural death is always a cause for

concern and if proved that the daughter-in-law of the family was
compelled to take her own life as it was rendered not worth living
by the in-laws, they must suffer. But personal liberties have to be
preserved, meaning thereby, in an appropriate case, accused has
to be set free till trial concludes.
28.

Instant case falls in the exception; requiring bail to be

granted.

29.

Petition stands disposed of directing learned Trial

Judge to release petitioners on bail on petitioners furnishing a
personal bond in sum of Rs.25,000/- with one surety each in the
like amount to the satisfaction of the learned Trial Judge in the
above captioned FIR.
30.

Needless to state, if they hold a pass port, petitioners

would surrender their pass ports and would not threaten or even
get in touch with any witness of the prosecution.
31.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned counsel

for the petitioners.
