1.

The defendant in Suit No. 120/04/98 is the Appellant in both these

FAO No. 193/2006

1 of 14

appeals. In FAO No. 193 of 2006, the challenge is to an Order dated
11.7.2006 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Delhi (ADJ),
dismissing the defendant's application, M-28/05, under Order IX Rule 13 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (`CPC') seeking the setting aside of ex
parte decree dated 3.9.2004 passed by the ADJ in the suit.

2.

The Respondent plaintiff filed Suit No. 1315 of 1998 in this Court

against the Appellant defendant for recovery of Rs. 8,67,074/- which
included a sum of Rs. 3,19,188/- being the price of a fourth set of rings
which were supplied by the defendant to the plaintiff against certain
purchase orders placed with it. The amount claimed included interest, the
refund of illegally encashed security and certain other charges. During the
period the suit was pending in this Court, pleadings were completed,
exhibits were marked and affidavits of evidence were filed by the parties.

3.

The record of the case shows that on 13.2.2003, the following order

was passed by this Court :
“13.2.2003
Present : Mr.Shiv Khurana for the plaintiff.
Mr.S.C.Nigam for the defendant.

FAO No. 193/2006

2 of 14

S. No. 1315/98

Since the plaintiff has filed the affidavits of his
witnesses in examination-in-chief, let the defendant also
file the affidavits of his witnesses in examination-inchief within six weeks. However the witnesses who are
officials and whose affidavits cannot be filed may be
summoned by the parties for examination. Mr. Amit
Bansal, Advocate, N-8, Greater Kailash-I, New Delhi110 048 (Tel. No. 26488021, 26488022) as Local
Commissioner for recording of examination/crossexamination of witnesses of the parties. His fees is fixed
at Rs.500/- per witness payable by the respective party.
The Dealing Clerk shall ensure the availability of the file
before the Local Commissioner at the time of crossexamination of the witnesses and shall be paid Rs. 250/for each day on which the file is made available to the
Local Commissioner, to be shared by both the parties
and both the parties may file list of witnesses within two
weeks.”

It requires to be noted that while directing examination of the witnesses by a
Local Commissioner, this Court did not set down the matter for further
hearing on any assigned date.

4.

On 19.2.2004 the matter was placed before the Joint Registrar of this

Court on the basis of an office note. The Joint Registrar noted that the value
of the suit for the purposes of pecuniary jurisdiction was less than Rs. 20
lakhs and that in view of Section 2 of the Delhi High Court (Amendment)
Act, 2003 [`Act'], the matter was being transferred to the Court of District
FAO No. 193/2006

3 of 14

Judge, District Courts, Tis Hazari, Delhi. The Joint Registrar then directed
that the parties and/or their counsel to appear before the District Judge, Delhi
on 15.4.2004. A perusal of this order indicates that there was no appearance
on behalf of either of the parties to the suit. Clearly, the matter was taken up
by the Joint Registrar only on the basis of an internal office note prepared on
the basis of the change in the pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court brought
about by the Act.

5.

Thereafter when the suit was renumbered as Suit No. 120/04/98 and

listed before the learned ADJ on 15.4.2004 again none appeared for the
parties. On the subsequent two dates, i.e., 21.5.2004 and 29.5.2004 none
appeared for the parties.

6.

On 21.5.2004, when none appeared for the parties, the learned ADJ

directed notice to issue to the counsel for the parties for 29.5.2004. The
record of the Trial Court indicates that the process server submitted a report
to the Court pursuant to the aforementioned order. In his report, the process
server stated that on 28.5.2004 he visited the address of Shri S.C. Nigam,
Advocate for the Defendant. He asked for Mr. Nigam. There was a lady at
the premises who informed the process server that Mr. Nigam was not
FAO No. 193/2006

4 of 14

available. She did not disclose her identity. The process server had to return
without serving the notice.

7.

After perusing this report, the learned ADJ on 29.5.2004 passed the

following order :
“29/5/04
Pr : None
Court notice not served. Let Court notice upon
counsel for parties be served through affixation for
3/7/04.
Sd/ADJ : Delhi

8.

Pursuant to the above order, the process server again visited the

premises of Mr. S.C. Nigam, Advocate on 17.6.2004. This time again he
did not find Mr. Nigam in the premises. He states in his report dated
17.6.2004 that he affixed the notice on the gate of the premises.

9.

Thereafter when the matter was listed on 3.7.2004, the learned ADJ

noted that counsel for the defendant had been served through affixation. He
concluded that “it amounts to due service upon defendant.” The record of
the proceedings show that on this date of hearing the plaintiff was
represented by learned counsel but the defendant was not.
FAO No. 193/2006

10.

At the subsequent hearing, i.e., on 20.8.2004, when none appeared

for the defendant, the defendant was proceeded ex parte. Thereafter, the
matter was set down for evidence of the plaintiff and by a judgment and
decree dated 3.9.2004, the suit was decreed in favour of the plaintiff. It
may be mentioned here that against the judgment and decree dated 3.9.2004
the defendant appellant has filed the companion appeal RFA No. 458 of
2006 which is being disposed of by this common judgment.

11.

According to the defendant it first came to know of the judgment and

decree dated 3.9.2004 and the Order dated 20.8.2004 setting the defendant
ex parte for the first time on 26.7.2005 when an attachment order was
received by M/s Punjab and Sind Bank from this Court which was said to
be in satisfaction of Execution Petition No. 6 of 2005 titled M/s Rathi Ispat
Ltd. v. Indicon Project & Equipments Ltd. It is stated that immediately
upon receiving this information, the Director of the Defendant/Appellant,
Shri P.N. Mishra contacted his lawyers and thereafter the Court record was
inspected from where these details were obtained.

12.

th

The Defendant then filed on the 9 of August 2005 an application

being M-28/05 under Order IX Rule 13 CPC seeking setting the aside of the
FAO No. 193/2006

6 of 14

ex parte judgment and decree passed by the ADJ on 3.9.2004. In support of
the application, the defendant filed an affidavit dated 9.8.2005 of Shri S.C.
Nigam to the effect that no service of the notice issued by the Court had
been effected upon him and that the Report of the process server of having
affixed the court notice at his residence was false. An affidavit was also
filed of Mr. P.N. Mishra explaining circumstances under which he came to
learn of the ex parte decree on 26.7.2005.

13.

In the impugned order dated 11.7.2006, dismissing the application,

the learned ADJ has referred to three specific circumstances which led him
to conclude that the application was without merit. First, the learned ADJ
concluded that the affixation of the court notice was as per the proper
procedure since the report of the process server indicated that “counsel was
not available being out of station”. The learned ADJ noted from the
previous report dated 28.5.2004 of the process server that the lady present
at the premises who had stated that Shri Nigam was not available, did not
disclose her name, and that, therefore, “this was (sic) amounted to refusal.”
The Court concluded that the procedure by which affixation was directed
and carried out was proper. The second reason that weighed with the Court
was that there was no reason to disbelieve the process server's report about

FAO No. 193/2006

7 of 14

the affixation of the notice. Thirdly, that a notice by speed post was sent on
19.8.2004 by counsel for the plaintiff to both the defendant as well as the
counsel for the defendant in support of which a photocopy of the plaintiff's
despatch register had also been produced.

14.

Learned counsel for the Appellant assails the impugned order of the

learned ADJ by contending that the report of the process server in fact
nowhere discloses that there was refusal of service by any one in the
premises of the counsel for the defendant. He submits that there was no
occasion for the Court to direct affixation of the notice at the premises of
the counsel for the defendant. He submits that the procedure adopted by the
learned Trial Court, after concluding that there was service of notice upon
counsel for the defendant, was improper and in the circumstances there was
no occasion for the Court to have set the defendant ex parte. Although at
one stage the learned counsel for the Appellant sought to contend that it was
mandatory for the defendant also to be served separately about the date of
hearing of the case in the Trial Court, he did not press this point in view of
the settled position that service through counsel would tantamount to
service on the party. He also did not dispute that Shri Nigam in any event
continued to represent the defendant.

15.

In reply, learned counsel for the Respondent plaintiff first submitted

that the contract between the parties subsisted even as on 19.7.1994.
According to him, when the case got transferred from this Court to the
District Court as a result of the change in pecuniary jurisdiction brought
about by Section 2 of the Act, there was no need in law for a notice to be
served either on counsel for the parties or the parties. He placed reliance
upon the judgment of the Orissa High Court in Kanhu Charan v.
Banambar Pradhan AIR 1986 Orissa 213 in support of this contention.
He further submitted that the report of the process server indicated that the
person available at the premises of Shri S.C. Nigam did not disclose her
identity and although the express wording of the report may not indicate
that there was refusal of service, the procedure adopted by the trial court for
service through affixation on the basis of such report was proper. He
sought to contend that the defendant had deliberately stayed away from the
court proceedings and that the learned trial court was fully justified in
disbelieving the version of the defendant and in therefore dismissing the
application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC.

16.

We find from the perusal of the record of the case that in the first

place even when the matter was pending in this Court, the order dated

FAO No. 193/2006

9 of 14

13.2.2003 did not fix the date of further hearing of the case. It is unlikely
therefore that the counsel for either of the parties could have anticipated
when the matter would be listed next. Secondly, as already noticed, when
the order was passed by the Joint Registrar of this Court on 19.2.2004
neither of the parties was present and the matter came to be placed before
the Joint Registrar only upon the basis of an office note. It is, therefore,
unlikely that the date date assigned by the Joint Registrar, i.e., 15.4.2004
could have been in the knowledge of either of the counsel for the parties,
and therefore the parties. This explains how on at least three dates of the
hearing thereafter before the Trial Court, none appeared for the parties.

17.

We then come to the two reports of the process server. Neither of

the reports in our view lead to a conclusion that there was a refusal of
service by any one or that the process server had somehow concluded that it
was not possible to serve the learned counsel for the defendant through the
regular method. There is also nothing to show that counsel for the defendant
was avoiding service of notice. The two reports of the process server are not
unequivocal on this aspect. We are of the view that only after the Court
comes to a definite conclusion that it is not possible to have the notice
served on a party through the regular process should it direct service by way

FAO No. 193/2006

10 of 14

of affixation of notice. In its order dated 29.5.2004 no such conclusion is
recorded by the Trial Court. Upon a perusal of the Report dated 17.6.2004
of the process server we are unable to come to a conclusion, in the manner
the learned ADJ did, that there was a refusal of service and that service by
way of affixation was, therefore, inevitable. It appears to us that having
resorted to the procedure of directing service of notice upon counsel for the
parties, the Trial Court erred, in the circumstances narrated, in directing
affixation of notice. We do believe that the Trial Court should have directed
fresh notice to the counsel for the defendant before deciding to set the
defendant ex parte. Nothing really turned on the notice sent by speed post
by the counsel for the plaintiff on 19.8.2004, one day prior to the hearing, to
the counsel for the defendant (and not the defendant as wrongly noted by
the Trial Court). Also, there is nothing to prove the despatch of such notice
by speed post.

18.

The decision of the Orissa High Court in Kanhu Charan, cited by the

learned counsel for the plaintiff Respondent, turned on its own facts. There
cannot be any hard and fast rule that notice has in all circumstances to be
issued on both parties as well as counsel. Nevertheless, we cannot be
unmindful of the fact that in view of the transfer of cases from this Court to

FAO No. 193/2006

11 of 14

the subordinate court as a result of the change of the pecuniary jurisdiction,
it is possible that the parties may not have known the precise dates when
the cases were listed before the Trial Court. Unfortunately the record of the
case shows that even counsel for the parties in this Court were not aware of
and could not have been aware of the date when the matter was fixed for
hearing before the Trial Court. Further, the Trial Court did not in its
impugned order explain why it did not find the explanation offered by the
defendant for its non-appearance to be acceptable.

19.

In the circumstances, it appears to us that the explanation offered by

the defendant for its failure to appear before the Trial Court on 3.7.2004 and
thereafter on 20.8.2004 is reasonable and merits acceptance. There was
sufficient cause shown by the Appellant defendant to persuade the Trial
Court to allow the application filed by the Appellant defendant under Order
IX Rule 13 CPC.

20.

Accordingly, the impugned Order dated 11.7.2006 is set aside.

Consequently the application, M-28 of 2005, filed by the defendant under
Order IX Rule 13 CPC is allowed. The appeal FAO No. 193 of 2006 is
allowed and CM 10439 of 2006 is disposed of.
FAO No. 193/2006

12 of 14

21.

The further consequence is that the ex parte judgment and decree

dated 3.9.2004 which was based upon the Order dated 20.8.2004 by which
the Trial Court set the defendant ex parte cannot be sustained in law and is
accordingly hereby set aside. RFA No. 458 of 2006 is accordingly allowed
and CM No. 10106 of 2006 is disposed of.

22.

The Suit No. 120/04/98 will now get restored to the file of the trial

court. The trial court's records will be returned by the Registry of this
Court to the Trial Court within two weeks from today. The parties will
appear before the Trial Court on 28.1.2008.

23.

Pursuant to the Order dated 12.8.2007 passed by this Court, the

Appellant had deposited the entire decretal amount in this Court. As a result
of the order passed by us today, the amount together any interest accrued
thereon will be returned to Appellant by the Registry of this Court within a
period of two weeks from today. The Appellant will satisfy the Registrar as
to the proper identification of its representative and the payment of the
amount will be made in accordance with rules.

With the above directions, both

appeals stand allowed and the

applications stand disposed of accordingly.
