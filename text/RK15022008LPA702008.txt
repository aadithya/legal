1.

The present appeal is filed by the appellant being aggreived

by the order dated 27th July, 2006 passed by the learned Single
Judge. The main grievance which is raised by the appellant in this
appeal is that the learned Single Judge was not justified in directing
for payment of only 6% as interest instead of 10%, which is interest
due and payable in terms of the respondent's own circular dated
20th July, 1999.

2.

It is submitted by the counsel appearing for the appellant

that in view of the aforesaid mandate of the circular issued by the
respondent themselves, the learned Single Judge was not justified in
allowing only 6% interest on the late payment of the arrears of
gratuity whereas it should have been 10%. Our attention was also
drawn to the relevant guidelines regarding terminal benefits, which
state as follows:
“As per provisions of the payment of Gratuity Act 1972,
the bank has to pay full amount of gratuity within 30
days from the date it becomes payable to the person
to whom gratuity is payable. If the amount of gratuity
payable is not paid by the bank within the specified
period (30 days), the bank has to pay from the date
on which the gratuity becomes payable to the date
on which it is paid, simple interest @ 10% p.a. Provided
that no such interest shall be payable for delay in the
payment due to the fault of the employee.”
3.

In the present appeal, the order passed by the learned Single

Judge dated 10th January, 2008 on the review application is also
under challenge as the said review application was dismissed.
Although appellant has claimed 12% interest on the aforesaid late
payment of gratuity, yet, in our considered opinion, in terms of the
aforesaid provision contained in the circular issued by the
respondent and the guidelines regarding terminal benefits, the
appellant would be entitled to simple interest @ 10% per annum as
the respondent has not been able to prove and establish that there
was any delay in the payment of the aforesaid amount due to the
fault of the appellant.
4.

The only issue, therefore, arising in this appeal is regarding

LPA 70/2008

payment of simple interest @ 10% on the delayed payment of
gratuity. The said plea of the appellant has force and we allow the
said prayer, directing the respondent to pay 10% simple interest on
the delayed payment of the gratuity, which shall be paid within a
period of eight weeks from today. In terms of the aforesaid order,
the appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent and LPA 70/2008 and
CM No.2309/2008 stand disposed of accordingly.
