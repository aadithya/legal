JUDGMENT
MANMOHAN, J:
1.

The present application being CM No. 10153/2007 has

been filed by Respondent No. 3 in a disposed off petition under
Section 151 CPC seeking appropriate direction to the Cooperative
Society to accept payment on such terms and conditions as this
Court may deem fit and proper.

The facts of this case are that this Hon’ble Court while

disposing off the present petition on August 17, 2005 held that the
Financial Commissioner had erred in restoring the Applicant’s
membership of the Cooperative Society as a society cannot
function in the absence of prompt and timely contribution by its
members. In the said judgment, there is a specific finding that the
Applicant had failed to make payment to the Cooperative Society
in time. However, as the FAR of the Society had been increased
and further as the learned counsel for the Applicant assured that
he would make payment as ordered by this Court within four
weeks along with interest at reasonable rate, this Court directed
the Applicant to pay a sum of Rs. 5,50,000/- plus Rs. 1,50,000/along with simple interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum.
This Hon’ble Court further directed in the said order that the
aforesaid amounts should be paid by the Applicant within four
weeks and on the said amount being deposited the Cooperative
Society would construct the additional flat for the Applicant. It
was made clear in the said order that if there was default in
payment of the said amount, the Cooperative Society would be
under no obligation to construct the additional flat.

Instead of depositing the amount within the time bound

period as agreed to by the Applicant’s counsel, the Applicant on
15th September, 2005 filed a review petition being RP No.
277/2005 on the ground that the statement of dues as recorded in
the order dated 17th August, 2005 was erroneous. However, on
30th March, 2007, this Hon’ble Court dismissed the said review
petition on the ground that the Applicant by way of a review
petition could not be allowed to make out a new case and more
so as the order dated 17th August, 2005 had been passed in the
presence of the Applicant’s counsel. However, this Court gave
liberty to the Applicant to approach the Society with regard to
payment of dues. In view of the aforesaid liberty, the Applicant on
13th June, 2007 sent belatedly three cheques totaling to Rs.
8,27,300/-. But the Society on 23rd June, 2007 returned the said
cheques on the ground that the same were not in accordance with
law. This led the Applicant to file the present application being
CM No. 10153/2007.

4.

We are of the view that the Applicant is not entitled to any

relief as his conduct is not fair and honest. Despite this Court on
17th August, 2005 finding that the Applicant was not entitled to be

restored as a member of the Cooperative Society, yet this court
had shown leniency provided Applicant tendered the outstanding
amounts within a strict time bound schedule of four weeks.
However, subsequently the Applicant tried to wriggle out of his
own admission in Court. A Cooperative Society to our mind can
only function if its members make prompt and timely contribution.
Persistent defaults in making payment – like the Applicant has
done in the present case – will only ensure that the Cooperative
movement fails.

We are of the opinion that the present

application has been filed just to take benefit of the phenomenal
increase in prices of flats in Delhi by offering payment belatedly
after more than two and a half years. We also deprecate the
tendency of litigants filing repeated applications in a disposed off
matter.

Consequently we find that the present application is

without any merit and we dismiss it with costs of Rs. 5000/- to be
paid to the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee.
