PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Present second appeal is preferred against the

judgment and decree dated 15.12.2005 passed by the learned
Additional District Judge Delhi whereby the appeal filed by the
respondent against the judgment and decree dated 18.11.2003
and order dated 23.3.2005 passed by the learned Civil Judge
Delhi was allowed.
2.

Appellant was plaintiff and respondent was the

defendant No.2 before the Trial Court. I shall be referring to
RSA No.106/2006

Page No.1 of 13

the parties by their nomenclature in the Trial Court.
3.

Plaintiff Mr. Surender.J.Sud through his attorney Mr.

Sudhir Sud filed a suit for possession and mesne profits in
respect of the property bearing No. B-6/69, Ground Floor,
Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the
suit property) against the defendant No.1 M/s. Foremost
Ceramics Ltd. and defendant No.2 Mr. R.R.Bhandari.
4.

In the plaint it was inter alia pleaded that the

plaintiff is the owner of the suit property. That the lease deed
dated 20.9.1990 was executed between the plaintiff and the
defendant No.1 whereby with effect from 1.10.1990 the suit
property was let out to the defendant No.1 at a monthly rent of
Rs.4,000/- for a period of 3 years. That the suit property was
given on lease to the defendant No.1 for the use and
occupation of defendant No.2 who was an employee of
defendant No.1.

That vide legal notice dated 21.9.2003

tenancy of defendant No.1 was duly terminated.

That since

the defendants failed to deliver vacant possession of the suit
property, a suit bearing No.897/1994 was filed in this court
against the defendants. Vide order dated 9.12.1994 passed by
this court, the defendant No.2 agreed to pay rent @ Rs.4,000/per month to the plaintiff till the disposal of the suit. That the
said suit was withdrawn on 28.3.2001 with liberty to file a fresh
RSA No.106/2006

Page No.2 of 13

suit.

Thereafter plaintiff issued another legal notice dated

5.4.2001 terminating the tenancy of the defendants.

Since

defendants again failed to deliver vacant possession of the suit
property, the plaintiff was constrained to file the present suit
before the learned Civil Judge.
5.

In the written statement filed by the defendant No.2

he took a defence that there is no landlord tenant relationship
between him and the plaintiff and that the present suit is
barred by Section 50 of the Delhi Rent Control Act 1958 for the
reason the rent of the suit property is less than Rs.3,500/- per
month.
6.

It was inter alia pleaded in the written statement

that the defendant No.2 has been occupying the suit property
as a tenant under Smt. Gian Kaur Sud ever since 15.9.1987
and that he was paying rent to her in respect of the suit
property. That the defendant No.2 joined the services of the
defendant No.1 in January 1988 and one of the terms of the
employment was that defendant No.1 was to make payment of
the rent of the premises where the defendant No.2 was to
reside.

Consequently defendant No.1 started to make

payment of rent for and on behalf of defendant No.2. That in
November 1991 defendant No.2 left the employment of
defendant No.1 and thereafter defendant No.2 has been
RSA No.106/2006

Page No.3 of 13

paying rent of the suit property to Smt. Gian Kaur Sud. That
lease deed dated 29.9.1990 was never executed between the
plaintiff and the defendant No.1 in respect of the suit property.
That the rate of rent of the suit property was Rs.2,000/- per
month.

A sum of Rs.1,000/- each was being paid by the

defendant No.2 towards fitting charges and taxes respectively
and these sums cannot be included within the meaning of the
term “rent”.
7.

In the replication to the written statement of

defendant No.2, plaintiff pleaded that Smt. Gian Kaur Sud was
accepting payment of rent from the defendant No.2 in her
capacity as attorney of the plaintiff.
8.

Plaintiff filed an application under Order 12 Rule 6

CPC praying for a decree on admission on the grounds that the
written statement filed by the defendant No.2 as also order
dated 9.12.1994 passed by this court in suit No.897/1994
shows that the defendant No.2 has admitted that he was a
tenant in the suit property under the plaintiff and that the rate
of the rent of the suit property was Rs.4,000/- per month.
9.

Vide

judgment

and

decree

dated

18.11.2003

learned Trial Court allowed the application under Order 12 Rule
6 CPC filed by the plaintiff and thus decreed the suit of the
plaintiff.

10.

Against

the

said

judgment

and

decree

dated

18.11.2003 defendant No.2 preferred a review which was
dismissed by the learned Trial Court vide order dated
23.3.2005.
11.

Against the judgment and decree dated 18.11.2003

and the order dated 23.3.2005 passed by the learned Trial
Court the defendant No.2 preferred an appeal before the Court
of Additional District Judge.
12.

After noting respective contentions of the parties

the learned Appellate Court allowed the appeal preferred by
the defendant No.2. The reason for so doing is that in a suit
for possession of immovable property the court has to consider
three things, firstly whether the relationship of landlord and
tenant subsists between the parties; secondly whether the rate
of the rent is more than Rs.3,500/- per month; thirdly whether
the tenancy has been duly terminated or not. In case all the
three things are admitted by a tenant, courts are under the
duty/empowered to pass the decree of possession under Order
12 Rule 6 CPC. It has been held that it is clear from the bare
reading of the pleadings of the parties that defendant No.2 has
neither admitted to be a tenant in the suit property under the
plaintiff nor has admitted the rate of the rent of the suit
property as Rs.4,000/- per month.
RSA No.106/2006

13.

It may be noted at the outset, a fact conceded by

Shri V.P.Singh, learned senior counsel for the appellant that no
Second Appeal lies against the impugned order. However, as
conceded by Shri Valmiki Mehta, learned senior counsel for the
respondent, an appeal would lie against the impugned order
under Order XLIII Rule 1 Clause u.

Thus, instant appeal is

treated as an Appeal against an order and not a Regular
Second Appeal.
14.

It is settled law that in Delhi, in a suit for ejectment,

only 3 issues arise for consideration:(a)

Whether there exists a landlord-tenant relationship
between the parties?

(b)

Whether the tenancy has expired by efflux of time
or stands determined by a valid notice to quit or the
tenant has otherwise forfeited the right under the
lease agreement? and

(c)

Since

Delhi

Rent

Control

Act

1958

prohibits

ejectment of a tenant paying rent up to Rs.3,500/per month save and except by an order passed by a
Rent Controller on the grounds specified under
Section 14 of the Delhi Rent Control Act 1958,
whether the rent of the leased premises is more
than Rs.3,500/- per month?
RSA No.106/2006

Page No.6 of 13

15.

At the hearing of the appeal, Shri Valmiki Mehta,

learned senior counsel for the respondent urged that the
respondent is not taking any defence pertaining to the rent of
the suit premises being less than Rs.3,500/- per month.
Learned senior counsel urged that in the instant case his client
has never admitted that the appellant was his landlord. That
the consistent case of his client has been that appellant's
mother Smt.Gian Kaur Sud was the landlady since 15.9.1987
and that his client had been paying rent to her. Learned senior
counsel additionally urged that there is no valid determination
of the tenancy inasmuch Smt.Gian Kaur Sud has never
determined the tenancy.
16.

Per contra, Shri V.P.Singh, learned senior counsel for

the appellant urged that initially Smt.Gian Kaur Sud, acting on
behalf of the appellant, had let out the property to the
respondent in the year 1987 but the land being demised under
a leasehold tenure by DDA a conveyance deed was executed
by DDA in favour of the appellant on 9th June 2003. Thus, the
appellant, as owner is the landlord of the respondent. Learned
senior counsel further urged that the initial tenancy came to
an end and status of the respondent came to be governed by a
lease

agreement

dated

29th

September

1990

executed

between the appellant through his mother Smt.Gian Kaur Sud
RSA No.106/2006

Page No.7 of 13

and M/s.Foremost Ceramics Ltd. of which the respondent was
an employee. The said lease agreement clearly recorded that
Smt.Gian Kaur Sud was acting as the attorney of the appellant
and that the company was the tenant with a condition that the
respondent, the employee of the company would reside in the
premises.
17.

Shri V.P.Singh, learned senior counsel for the

appellant further submitted that on 5th April 2001, appellant
determined the lease calling upon the respondent as also the
company M/s.Formost Ceramics Ltd. to vacate the suit
premises clearly stating that with effect from the midnight of
30th April 2001, on tenancy being determined, possession
retained by the respondent would be unauthorized. Learned
senior counsel submitted that the said legal notice was duly
replied to by the respondent on 22nd May 2001 meaning
thereby receipt of notice determining the tenancy was
admitted by the respondent.
18.

It was lastly urged by learned senior counsel for the

appellant that the MCD had attached the rent on account of
arrears of property tax and that vide letter dated 27th February
2007 addressed to the Assistant Assessor and Collector the
respondent clearly admitted that the appellant was the owner
of the premises.
RSA No.106/2006

Page No.8 of 13

19.

Responding to the aforesaid pleas of the appellant,

Shri Valmiki Mehta, learned senior counsel urged that the
respondent was not a party to the lease agreement dated 29 th
September 1990.

Counsel submitted that as a service

condition under M/s.Foremost Ceramics Ltd. the employer had
agreed to pay actual house rent to his client and that if his
employer had executed some document with the appellant,
the same did not bind his client. More so, counsel urged, since
his client was admittedly in possession of the suit premises
much prior to the lease agreement dated 29.9.1990. In respect
of the notice determining tenancy referred to by Shri
V.P.Singh, learned senior counsel for the appellant, Shri
Valmiki Mehta, learned senior counsel for the respondent
submitted that in response his client categorically stated that
the appellant was not the landlord and hence the notice
determining the tenancy was meaningless.
20.

In

response

to

the

submission

predicated

on

respondent's letter dated 27.2.2007 addressed to the Assistant
Assessor and Collector referred to by Shri V.P.Singh, learned
senior counsel for the appellant, Shri Valmiki Mehta, learned
senior counsel for the respondent urged that since MCD had
referred to the appellant as the person primarily liable to pay
property tax, respondent's response was to inform the MCD
RSA No.106/2006

Page No.9 of 13

the address of the appellant.

Counsel submitted that the

context in which said letter was written is relevant. It related
to a notice by the MCD treating appellant to be the owner and
respondent's response providing the appellant's address to
MCD.
21.

It is settled law that to be entitled to a decree on

admission, the admission has to be unequivocal. Further, the
admission need not necessarily be in the substantive pleadings
of the parties. The admission may be contained in pleadings
pertaining to interim applications. Additionally, the admission
may be contained even in a document admitted by the
respondent.
22.

Having

considered

the

submissions

made

by

learned counsel for the parties it would be useful to note that
admittedly even as per the appellant his mother had let out
the suit premises to the respondent on 15th September 1987.
She had been receiving the rent in her own name. Though, it
was sought to be projected on behalf of the appellant that
Smt.Gian Kaur Sud acted as the attorney of the appellant but
unfortunately for the appellant she did not do so.

While

executing the lease agreement in question, Smt.Gian Kaur Sud
never stated that she was acting as the attorney of the
appellant. No doubt, under the conveyance deed relied upon
RSA No.106/2006

Page No.10 of 13

by the appellant, being the conveyance deed dated 9.6.2003,
executed by DDA in his favour he is shown as the owner of the
suit premises but the fact of the matter remains that there is
no reference to said conveyance deed in any pleading.

No

document has been shown to this Court containing an
admission from the side of the respondent pertaining to the
said conveyance deed.

To compound the problem for the

appellant the conveyance deed nor certified copy nor even the
photocopy thereof has been filed before the learned Trial
Judge.

There is thus no admission of the respondent qua

appellant's title.
23.

Even the lease deed dated 29.9.1990 does not

come to the rescue of the appellant for the reason admittedly
the respondent is not a signatory thereto. As noted above, the
respondent has made pleadings with respect thereto by stating
that the respondent was in occupation of the suit premises
since 15th September 1987 under Smt.Gian Kaur Sud and that
in the year 1990 respondent's employer had agreed to
reimburse the rent and that if executed, the document cannot
bind the respondent who is not a signatory thereto and cannot
be in derogation of the tenancy rights of the respondent which
enured since September 1987.
24.

I may only state that evidence would be required to

RSA No.106/2006

Page No.11 of 13

be led on this issue i.e. what is the effect of the lease
agreement dated 29.9.1990. Evidence would come in the form
of who paid the rent? For purposes of tax laws, how was the
same accounted for? Etc. etc.
25.

Short of virtually conceding, Shri V.P.Singh, learned

senior counsel for the appellant tacitly conceded that it
appears to be a case where the land was initially alloted by
DDA in favour of Smt. Gian Kaur Sood who voluntarily
requested DDA to convey the title in favour of her son i.e. the
appellant.

Transfers amongst blood relations are normally

acceded to by DDA. This is the reason why the conveyance
deed was ultimately executed in favour of the appellant.
Unfortunately for the appellant a better legal advice could
have solved his problem only if Smt.Gian Kaur Sud was advised
to serve a notice of attornment upon the respondent intimating
that her son had become the owner of the suit premises with a
direction to the respondent to henceforth pay the rent to the
appellant. Admittedly, no such notice of attornment has been
issued or served upon the respondent.
26.

Pertaining to the notice determining the tenancy

referred to by Shri V.P.Singh, learned senior counsel for the
appellant suffice would it be to note that the respondent
responded

thereto

RSA No.106/2006

vide

reply

dated

22.5.2001.

The

Page No.12 of 13

respondent categorically denied being a tenant under the
appellant. The respondent categorically stated that he was a
tenant in the premises since 1987.

That his landlady was

Smt.Gian Kaur Sud.
27.

Indeed, Shri V.P.Singh, learned senior counsel for

the appellant could not point out any admission of the
respondent admitting that the appellant was his landlord.
28.

I concur with the view taken by the learned

Appellate Judge that there is no admission made by the
respondent which entitles the appellant to a decree on
admission.
29.

The appeal fails. The same is dismissed.

30.

No costs.

31.

TCR be returned forthwith.
