PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

FIR No.224/07 dated 3.4.2007
under Section 498-A/406/34 IPC
PS Patel Nagar.
Petitioners are the father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband,

younger brother of the husband and the younger married sister of
the husband of the complainant. They seek pre-arrest bail in the
afore-noted FIR.
2.

On 23.7.2007 parties were referred for mediation.

Unfortunately, mediation has failed due to the non-cooperative
attitude of the petitioners.
3.

The complainant has been thrown out of her matrimonial

house with 2 children. All petitioners are present in Court. I have
specifically asked petitioner No.3, the husband of the complainant

and petitioner No.1, the father-in-law of the complainant whether
they are prepared to give some monthly maintenance to the
complainant. They have refused.
4.

The investigating officer informs that the petitioners own

a residential house in Delhi, though in an unauthorized colony. The
house has 5 rooms on the ground floor and 4 rooms on the first
floor. Out of 9 rooms, 5 have been let out to tenants.
5.

Petitioner No.1 and 3 admit that the 5 rooms have been

let out to the tenants but state that the house in question is the
joint property of the first petitioner and his brother.
6.

No istreedhan or dowry article of the complainant has

been recovered probably for the reason nothing is available in the
matrimonial house of the complainant.
7.

Petitioners state that whatever jewellery was possessed

by the complainant has been taken away by her.
8.

But, in respect of household articles, admitting that the

complainant never brought a public goods carrier to the matrimonial
house and could not have removed the household articles,
petitioners No.1 and 3 respond to the Court by stating that come
what may they are not ready to give anything to the complainant.
9.

The obstructive attitude of the petitioners does not

entitle them to any discretionary relief.
10.

But, noting that petitioner No.2 is a housewife and that

petitioner No.5 is married outside the family and that petitioner
No.4 appears not to be having any say in the matter, I am of the

opinion that only petitioners No.2, 4 and 5 would be entitled to
anticipatory bail.
11.

I thus dismiss the petition vis-a-vis petitioners No.1 and 3

i.e. Ram Dass and Om Prakash.
12.

I grant anticipatory bail to petitioners No.2, 4 and 5.

13.

Subject

to

said

petitioners

cooperating

with

the

investigating officer, in the event of the said petitioners being
arrested by the investigating officer they would be released on bail
by the investigating officer on their furnishing a personal bond in
sum of Rs.10,000/- each with one surety each in the like amount to
the satisfaction of the investigating officer in the afore-noted FIR.
14.

Copy of the order be supplied dasti to learned counsel

for the petitioner.
