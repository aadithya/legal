1.

The petitioner was serving in the Army as a Ambulance

Driver in Army Medical Corps under command of Commanding
Officer Military Hospital Mathura since November 2002.

A

tentative charge sheet was prepared by Lt. Col. P.S. Santosh,
Offg. Commanding Officer 4001 Field Ambulance under Section
69 of the Army Act (hereinafter referred to as said Act) on
14.7.2004. On that day itself, the petitioner was informed that
Summary of Evidence has to be recorded shortly and was asked
WP (C) No.1376/2006

Page 1 of 10

to submit full particulars of the DWs. This ROE was on account of
a complaint lodged against the petitioner by the husband of Mrs.
Boby Chaudhary alleging that on 27.4.2004, the petitioner
committed an offence of using criminal force on her with intent to
outrage her modesty.

Court of enquiry was held by recording

statement of 10 witnesses `on 21.8.2004.

On that basis, a

conclusion was derived against the petitioner and it was that he
should be tried for an offence on 27.4.2004 as lodged against him
and therefore an order was passed by the third respondent for the
trial of the petitioner by GCM vide order dated 28.8.2004.
2.

On 8.1.2005, a charge-sheet was framed against the

petitioner under Section 69 of the Army Act i.e., to say
“committing a civil offence”.

An order was passed by the

Commander 1 Corps Arty Bde i.e., sixth respondent,

that the

petitioner be tried by Summary Court Martial; the petitioner was
tried

by

Summary

Court

Martial

held

on

3.2.2005

which

commenced at 900 hours and concluded at 1300 hours on the
same day and the petitioner was sentenced “to be dismissed from
service”.
3.

A statutory appeal in terms of section 164(2) of the said Act

was filed by the petitioner against the aforesaid order which was
also dismissed vide order dated 20.10.2005 after directions were
given in a Civil Writ Petition bearing No. 5008/2005 filed by the
petitioner on 15.7.2005 vide order dt. 18.10.2005. It is against

WP (C) No.1376/2006

Page 2 of 10

the order of dismissal of the appeal, the petitioner has filed the
present writ petition.
4.

The petitioner has challenged his sentence and the order in

appeal mainly on the grounds that Col. K.K. Sharma (C.O of 4001
Field Ambulance) was not his Commanding Officer; hence he was
not empowered to proceed against the petitioner. He was neither
entitled to record Summary of Evidence nor he was entitled to
hold Summary Court Martial in view of the provisions of Section
116 of the Army Act which reads as under:“116.
Summary Court martial (1) A
summary court martial may be held by the
Commanding Officer of any corps,
department of detachment of the regular
army, and he shall alone constitute the
court.
5.

A bare perusal of this provision does not show that only the

Commanding Officer of the Command in which the petitioner is
posted alone is empowered to hold the Summary Court Martial.
However, the petitioner also wishes to take benefit of Note 5
appended to Section 120 F of the Act which stood deleted at the
time when the offence was allegedly committed. The said Note
which was earlier in existence has been appended to sub-Section
120 of the Army Act and reads as under:120 Powers of Summary Court Martial—(1)
Subject to the provisions of Sub-section (2), a
Summary Court martial may try any offence
punishable under this Act.
(2) When there is no grave reason for
immediate action and reference can without
detriment to discipline be made to the officer
empowered to convene a District Court
WP (C) No.1376/2006

Page 3 of 10

Martial or an active service a Summary
General Court Martial for the trial of the
alleged offender, an officer holding a
Summary Court Martial shall not try without
such reference any offence punishable under
any of the Sections 34, 37 and 69 or any
offence against the officer holding the Court.
(3) A summary Court martial may try any
person subject to this Act and under the
command of the officer holding the Court,
except an officer, junior commissioned officer
or warrant officer.
(4) A Summary Court Martial may pass any
sentence which may be passed under this
Act, except a sentence of death or
(imprisonment for life) or of imprisonment for
a term exceeding the limit specified in Subsection(5).
(5) The limit referred to in Sub-section (4)
shall be one year if the officer holding the
Summary Court martial is of the rank of
Lieutenant-Colonel and upwards, and three
months if such officer is below that rank.
Note 5 A NCO or a sepoy can not be
attached to another unit for the purpose of
his trial by SCM except as provided in Regs
Army para 381.

Regulation 381 of Army Regulation Act reads as under:381. Trial of Deserters.- Under normal
circumstances trial by Summary Court
Martial for desertion will be held by the CO of
the unit of the deserter. However, when a
deserter or an absentee from a unit shown in
column one of table below surrenders to, or
is taken over by, the unit shown opposite in
column two and is properly attached to and
taken on the strength of the latter unit he
may,
provided
evidence,
particularly
evidence of identification, is available with
the latter unit, be tried by Summary Court
Martial by the CO of that unit when the unit
shown in column one is serving in high
altitude area or overseas or engaged in
counter insurgency operation or active
hostilities or Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
In no circumstances will a man be tried by
Summary Court martial held by a CO other

the CO of the unit to which the man properly
belongs; a unit to which the man may be
attached subsequent to commission of the
offence by him will also be a unit to which
the man properly belongs.

It is submitted that in November 2002, the petitioner was

posted on permanent strength of Commanding Officer, Military
Hospital Mathura. On 27.4.2004 at about 1330 hrs the petitioner
was put under the Duty Medical Officer as a Driver of Ambulance,
when Smt. Bobby Chaudhary wife of another Army Personnel
visited the Duty Medical Officer to take the medicine, as the said
lady was under family way. Despite the fact that no complaint
was made by that lady, the petitioner was still proceeded with
Summary Court Martial and in fact the Commanding Officer failed
to exercise his powers under Rule 22(1) and Rule 180 of the Army
Rules, 1954.

It is also submitted that the proceedings taken

against him were contrary to the judgment delivered in the case
Ex.-Hav. Mahipal Singh Vs. Union of India and Others
reported in 55(1994) Delhi Law Times 176.

Relying

upon

Regulations 401 to 406, it was also contended that since the
WP (C) No.1376/2006

Page 5 of 10

petitioner was taken into Military custody with effect from
27.4.2004, he was denied a fair opportunity to defend the case
which is violative of Rule 33(7) of the Army Rule, 1954.
7.

It is also stated that justification given by the respondent by

attaching the petitioner to some other unit by relying upon the
Army order 7/2000 and also the plea of deletion of Note 5 is
appreciated by the Division Bench of this Court in L/Nk. Vishav
Priva Singh Vs. UOI & Ors. reported in 147(2008) DLT 208. It
is submitted that the plea of deleting Note 5 vide circular dated
28.8.2001 issued by the respondent was not accepted in the
aforesaid writ petition as also in Writ Petitions Nos. 6185/2002,
2433/2003, and 20233/2005. It may be observed that Judgment
in of Ex. Hav. Mahipal’s case(supra) raises a similar point.
8.

On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the

respondent submitted that the Judgment delivered by the Division
Bench of this court is not applicable to the facts of this case as
the offence committed by the accused/petitioner was after the
deletion of Note 5 of which reference has been made in
paragraph 10 of the judgment. It is submitted that once the said
Note 5 was no more in existence in the Statute Book when the
offence was committed by the petitioner he cannot take benefit of
the said Note and as such the bar contained in Note 5 that a
Sepoy cannot be attached to another unit for the purpose of trial
does not hold water. As regard the plea of the petitioner that in
the aforesaid Judgment an observation was also made that
WP (C) No.1376/2006

Page 6 of 10

deletion of Note 5 without issuing a gazette notification could not
be considered as deleted is again of no consequence

because

when note 5 was added in the statute board, it was not done by
way of gazette notification and, therefore, the question of
deleting the same by issuing a Gazette Notification was not
relevant. It is the matter of record that Note 5 appended Section
120 stood deleted on 28.7.2008 as per Annexure R 1 filed by the
respondents whereas the offence in this case was committed by
the petitioner on 27.4.2004.
9.

It is thus submitted that only point taken by the petitioner

that the Commanding Officer who held Summary Court Martial
against the petitioner was not competent is of no consequence.
Once the Army authorities were empowered to attach the
petitioner to a different unit for the purpose of holding a Summary
Court martial and the Summary Court martial is held in
accordance with the law,

no grievance can be made by the

petitioner that he was not tried by the Commanding Officer of the
unit to which he was attached.
10.

Before the Appellate Authority, the petitioner primarily

contended that the (Commanding Officer of 4001 Fd. Amb) had
no jurisdiction to order Summary of Evidence as he was posted in
Military hospital Mathura and could not be attached to any other
unit that the provision of Army Rule 22 to 24 were not complied
with and that the copy of the complaint made by the prosecutrix
was not attached. Moreover, a circular as required under Section
WP (C) No.1376/2006

Page 7 of 10

23(3) read with Army order 256/72with regard to the confession
allegedly made by the petitioner was also not given and further
none of the prosecution witness including Medical Officer
corroborated commission of the alleged offence and as such it
was a case of no evidence.

Moreover, the petitioner ought to

have been tried by DCM. The petitioner was also not provided
required document thereby denying him an opportunity to
prepare his defence. Thus, it was contended that petitioner was
deprived of the services of preparing his defence properly.

He

was also deprived of service of the defence counsel. The friend of
the accused provided to the petitioner was disqualified. The
petitioner was also not explained the consequences of pleading
guilty.
11.

We have perused the original record and find that the

petitioner was attached with C.O. 4001 Fd. Amb under provisions
of Section 116 of the Act for taking disciplinary action against
him. Hearing of the charge was carried out by the Commanding
Officer who also recorded Summary of Evidence presence of the
accused as per Rule 180 of the Army Rules.

He was also given

opportunity to lead his evidence. After perusal of the Summary of
Evidence, the Commanding Officer under Army Rule 24 satisfied
himself as to the prima facie nature of the case and then decided
to deal with the case by SCM.

Smt. Bobby Chowdhary, the

prosecutrix was also examined during the Court of Inquiry and
her statement forms part of Summary of Evidence which reflects
WP (C) No.1376/2006

Page 8 of 10

serious allegations leveled against the petitioner.

A complaint

was made by the husband of the lady to the Commanding Officer
Mathura Cantt which has been produced before the court of
enquiry.

The petitioner was given an opportunity to cross-

examine her which he exercised. He also pleaded guilty to the
charge. The required certificate under Army 115 (2A) was duly
signed by the petitioner and is attached to the Summary Court
Martial proceedings which shows that petitioner pleaded guilty to
the charges levelled against him.

The order of the appellate

authority goes to show that all procedural formalities were
complied with including grant of friend of petitioner to remain
present during the course of inquiry.
12.

Taking all these facts into consideration and the factum of

the deletion of Note 5 on which very strong reliance was placed
by the petitioner, we find that the petitioner has no legs to stand
and in fact the Judgment cited by the petitioner either in the case
of Ex.-Hav. Mahipal Singh (Supra) and in the case of L/Nk.
Vishav Priva Singh (Supra) has no application to the facts of
this case.

Moreover, in the facts of this case, taking into

consideration the seriousness of the charges levelled against the
accused to which he pleaded guilty and the manner in which the
Summary Court Martial was conducted after recording the
summary of evidence by a competent Officer and deletion of Note
5 from the Statute Book before the offence was committed, we do
not find any reason to interfere in the order passed by the
WP (C) No.1376/2006

Page 9 of 10

Appellate Authority or by the Summary Court Martial, dismissing
the petitioner from service.
12.

Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed with no order as

to costs.
