1.

These writ petitions all pertain to admissions to the two

year Elementary Teacher Education(diploma course) (hereinafter
referred as ETE for brevity) run by the State Council of
Educational Research and Training(hereinafter referred as
SCERT).
As the scheme for reservation as was applied in all the
four writ petitions is the same and questions raised are
overlapping. These writ petitions are being disposed of by this
common judgment.
2.

In order to appreciate the issues raised it is necessary to

W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 2 of 38

set out the scheme under which admissions are effected to the
course by the respondents. All the petitioners belong to different
reserved categories and are seeking entitlement to admission
under said categories. Therefore before addressing the individual
writ petitions, I propose to consider the scheme and manner of
admissions to the course in the question.
It is noteworthy that the SCERT, Delhi is an autonomous
body of the Government of NCT of Delhi stated to have been
established in 1988.

It is the nodal agency recognised by the

National Council of Teachers Education(NCTE) for admission,
curriculum constructions, course conduct guidance, examination
and certification of the pre-service training programme for
elementary school teachers. The two year diploma in ETE is being
offered

in

nine

District

Institutes

of

Education

and

Training(DIETs) which are wholly state owned and run as well as
in four recognised private institutes in Delhi. The programme is
based on NCTE guidelines to prepare teachers at elementary level
for the schools of Delhi.
So far as the content of the course, method of admission
and selection and allocation of institutes is concerned, the same
was duly notified to all candidates in the prospectus issued for the
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 3 of 38

session 2004-2006 by the SCERT in April, 2004. It was clearly
notified in this prospectus that the four private institutes that offer
the ETE course are restricted to female candidates only and are
recognised by the Government of NCT of Delhi as well as NCTE.
3.

The prospectus also provided that the ETE is a

professional programme

and that candidates selected for

admissions are required to take the programme with seriousness
and to undergo two years of rigorous educational experience
requiring a commitment to become teachers of young children.
4.

The schedule for admission in the ETE course inter alia

provide as under :-

5.

Inasmuch as these writ petitions are concerned with one

or the other of the reserved category, it is necessary to examine the
scheme of reservation as was notified in the prospectus. It would
be beneficial to set out herein the details provided in the
prospectus itself. Reservation was provided under clause 3 which
read thus:“3. Reservation
There is provision for reservation of seats for
following categories. In case candidates are not

It is noteworthy that the institutes which have been
abbreviated from RN to RKP were Government run DIETs
whereas the names of four private institutes were abbreviated as
RK, VT, LT, GR.
6.

The respondents have considered a total number of 1050

seats which are available for allocation in both the Government
DIETs as well as the private institutes. Out of these 800 seats
were in the nine DIETs and 250 seats for female candidates in the
four private ETE institutions.

It is to be borne in mind that

reservations have been effected of the prescribed percentages of
seats out of the total number of seats and had not been restricted
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 8 of 38

to only the seats available in Government DIETs.
On this basis, the following number of seats have been
provided in the reserved category :Total no. of seats

ST (7.5%)

It has been pointed out on behalf of the respondents in

all the writ petitions that only 1% reservation was provided in the
NCC category and ex-servicemen category which amounts to a
total of 10 seats in each category out of the total seats. In case
reservation was restricted to Government institutions, there being
nine DIETs, only nine NCC seats and ex-servicemen seats would
be allocated to the nine Government DIETs. Therefore one seat
would remain for all admission.
It is also noticed that only six Government DIETs have a
total capacity of 100 seats whereas the others had 80 or 50 seats.
In case reservation of one percent was effected in either of these

W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 9 of 38

categories in these institutes, only a fraction of a seat would be
permissible to be reserved. For this reason, it was decided that the
reservation of 1% quota would be distributed only in those DIETs
where there was a total strength of 100 students. Therefore, six of
these reserved category seats were allocated and distributed
between the six State run DIETs. For this reason four seats out of
the ten reserved seats in the NCC/Ex-servicemen quota would go
to private DIETs.
8.

Three of the private institutes namely RK, LT and GR

had a total capacity of only 50 seats.

Therefore, in order to

maintain reservation of 1% of seats even at the institute level, it
would be found that the Institute with 50 seats would get only half
a seat in either of the NCC or the ex-servicemen category.
9.

In order to ensure that no injustice was done either to

the students or to the institutes, inasmuch as there cannot be half
seat allocation, therefore in order to ensure that even institutes
having 50 seats only provided for reserved categories, the
respondents distributed the seat so that an institute having a total
of 50 seats only would grant reservation of one per cent seat to the
NCC category for one year and to the ex-servicemen category in
the second year. Thereby reservation and the 1% stipulation were
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 10 of 38

both maintained.
10.

It is noteworthy that 1% reservation is provided in both

the NCC category and the Ex-servicemen category which comes to
a total of ten seats in each category. In order to ensure that no
injustice results, the respondents have had to evolve a formula of
rotation of these seats. In the current year, that is the academic
session 2004, there being nine DIETs, nine seats out of the ten
NCC reserved category seats would go to them and one seat would
go to a private institution having 100 students.
11.

To provide for the distribution of the ex-servicemen, six

seats have been given to Government DIETs with the strength of
100 students and four seats have been allocated to private DIETs.
Out of the four private institutes, only one institute has a strength
of about 100 students. The other three have a strength of 50 seats
each only. Since the three private institutes having 50 seats did
not get any seat in the NCC category, they have been given one full
seat in the ex-service men category.
12.

The scheme evolved by the respondents is that this will

be followed by a rotation in the next academic year to the effect
that the NCC reserved category will have a bifurcation of 6 seats in
DIETs and 4 seats in the private institutions. The ex-service men
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 11 of 38

will have 9 seats in DIETs and only one reserved seat in the private
institutes where the total strength is 100 in the next academic
session.
13.

This scheme and seat availability was provided for in the

prospectus which was available to all the petitioners as back as in
April, 2004 and this is the manner in which the reservation has
been given effect to and admissions have been effected to the ETE
course in these reserved categories.
14.

Addressing the facts of each case in the light of the

aforestated scheme, I may deal with the individual cases on the
individual pleas as have been raised.

Writ Petition(civil) 12272/2004 entitled Sandeep

Rana vs SCERT and Writ petition 12272/2004 entitled
Sh. Rakesh Kumar Mann vs SCERT.
(i)

These two candidates had applied for admission in the

ex-servicemen quota and were declared successful having secured
merit rank 1071. It has been pointed out that in this reserved
category, three candidates secured merit rank 540, two candidates
secured 840 and six candidates got 1071 rank. The result of the
candidates was published in newspapers.

As per the notified

scheme, counselling was held on 21st July, 2004.

(iv)

Perusal of the aforestated list shows that a candidate

namely Shankar Guliya who also secured an overall rank 1071 was
at serial number 6 of the merit list in the Ex Servicemen category.
As per the scheme notified for allocation of the reserved
category seats, six seats in the ex-servicemen category were
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 13 of 38

reserved in the Government DIETs. These were exhausted with
the grant of admission to Shanker Guliya who was also at rank
1071.
(v)

The remaining four reserved category seats were

available only in private institutes which had been notified to be
admitting female candidates alone. Even though the petitioner
Sandeep Rana was at merit rank nine and Rakesh Kumar Mann
was at serial number eight, however being males they could not be
granted admission to the only seats available in this reserved
category which were in the private DIETs restricted to female
candidates.
(vi)

The respondents have contended that the first available

girl candidate in the merit list had secured merit rank 1570. It was
in these circumstances alone that candidates below rank 1071 were
granted admission. These candidates were girl candidates and the
petitioner

cannot

in

any

circumstance

contend

that

the

respondents have not effectuated the merit list.
The challenge made by the petitioners to the scheme of
reservation at this highly belated stage has been objected to by the
respondents contending that there was no challenge to the scheme
which was duly notified in the prospectus. The petitioners had
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 14 of 38

accepted the validity, submitted application forms, participated in
the examination, accepted the result and for this reason alone
participated in the counselling and as such cannot contend any
illegality in the scheme of reservation merely because they could
not get admission.
(vii)

The petitioners have challenged the action of the

respondents on three main grounds which are firstly, that the
respondents have no power to effect reservation for private
institutions, secondly, the respondents cannot effect reservation in
institutions which are restricted to female candidates as thereby
the male candidates in the reserved categories are being
discriminated

against

and

the

same

amounts

to

double

reservation; thirdly, even assuming that there are more
meritorious candidates than the petitioners, such candidates not
having come to court, their claims have to be ignored and only
claims of such candidates who have approached this court have to
be considered.
In support of the aforestated submissions, reliance has
been placed on behalf of the petitioners on the judgments of the
Apex Court reported at AIR 2003 SC 3724 (para 122-126) entitled
Islamic Academy of Education Vs. State of Karnataka; 2001(93)
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

Vijay Kumar Aggarwal.
16.

I have considered the rival contentions and the law

relied upon by the parties. It is noteworthy that as per the scheme
of admissions, the prospectus was made available to the
petitioners as back as in April, 2004.

The petitioners laid no

grievance whatsoever to the scheme of admissions notified in the
brochure. Full particulars of the quota available in the reserved
category was duly notified. The percentage quota distribution was
also informed to the public at large and even the specific number
of seats available for reservation as well as the institutes where
such reserved seats was available was notified by the respondents
in the brochure itself. The respondents had repeatedly notified in
the brochure in several places that the private institutes were
available for admission only to female candidates.
17.

No petitioner at any point of time raised any objection

either to the respondents giving effect to the reservation in the
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 16 of 38

private institutes or the fact that such reserved seats were available
only to female candidates in such private institutes. I have noticed
in a judgment pronounced by me earlier in the WP(C) 15132/04
Vivek Dabas Vs. SCERT to the effect that the respondents are
effecting reservation out of the total number of 1050 seats and not
out of only 800 seats available in the Government DIETs. It is
noteworthy that the number of seats available in the reserved
category considerably goes up if reservation is effected out of 1050
seats and not out of 800 seats only.

Assuming that the

contentions made by the petitioners were accepted, then
reservation was to be effected out of 800 seats available in the
Government DIETs alone. One per cent of such 800 seats would
amount to eight seats only against the ten seats which have been
provided for by the respondents. Only seven Government DIETs
have 100 total number of seats. If reservation was restricted to
Govt. DIETs, then necessarily only seven seats would be available
in this reserved category.
18.

From the foregoing, neither the petitioners namely

Sandeep Rana or Rakesh Kumar Mann could possibly get
admission in the order of merit inasmuch as one Sh. Ajay
Brahmraj Singh who was at roll number 24410 had also secured
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 17 of 38

1071 rank but was placed above the petitioners at serial number 7
in the order of merit of the ex-servicemen category who would be
entitled to such admission.
It has been repeatedly held by the Apex Court and by
this court that merit cannot be ignored while granting admission.
Even claims of meritorious candidates who had not come to court
has to be protected by courts while effecting admissions.
19.

I am unable to agree with the submission on behalf of

the petitioners that reservation ought not to have been granted in
private institutes. This scheme has been accepted by not only the
students but by the private institutes as well and there is no
objection from any quarter to the same. The scheme for
reservation is intended to effectuate the constitutional mandate
and to provide for an opportunity for social upliftment of what has
been considered hitherto as such categories of society which
needed to be encouraged and facilitated.
The considerations proposed would be different if the
scheme was being considered from perspective of objections raised
by the institutes. In the present case the implementation of the
scheme of reservation has been accepted by the private institutes
and the same has resulted in furthering the laudable objectives of
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 18 of 38

ensuring social justice and has ensured availability of a larger
number of seats to the reserved categories and such action cannot
be faulted for any reason.
20.

In any case, even assuming that the objection of the

petitioners was to be upheld, there would be no difference in the
result inasmuch as the petitioners would still not have been able
to secure admission.
21.

In this view of the matter, the judgment of the Apex

Court in the Islamic Academy case has no applicability in the facts
of this case. Learned counsel appearing for the respondents has
pointed out that the petitioner is placing reliance on the
observations of the Apex Court

(para 122).

It is however

noteworthy that the court was concerned with objections raised on
behalf of the institutes which is not so in the present case.
So far as judgment of the Division Bench of this court in
1993 (2001) DLT 831 is concerned, the matter related to
reservation of posts for employment for persons with disability
and the court had held that reservation of 3% of the posts for
persons with disability in accordance with the applicable
enactment

was

permissible

in

Government

educational

institutions or aided institutions. None of the issues which arise
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 19 of 38

for consideration in the present case had arisen for consideration
before the Division Bench and as such the judgment has no
bearing on the issues raised.
Similarly in the judgment of the learned Single Judge of
this court in 112(2004) DLT 725 entitled Dr. B.R. Ambedkar vs
Union of India, the court had held that inasmuch as there was no
notification notifying the scheduled tribe categories for Delhi, the
Government could not by way of executive instruction direct filling
up of posts in such category. Again in 59 (1995) DLT 803, the
court had held that reservation would be post based and not
vacancy based.
22.

In the instant case, in any case, the respondents have

effected reservation out of the total number of seats and as such it
cannot possibly be contended that the respondents have in any
manner flouted the principles laid down by the courts. So far as
the objection with regard to reservation being effected in private
institutes is concerned, in view of the discussion aforestated it is
noteworthy that effect of reservation being effected in private
institutes had resulted in more seats being available for private
categories. In case reservation was to be restricted in Government
DIETs alone, the effect would be that the seat availability would
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 20 of 38

have to be computed out of the total number of 800 seats available
for admission in the Government DIETs.
23.

It has been pointed out that this policy has been in place

since 1988 and the challenge raised could have at best been raised,
if at all, by the private institutes which have not only accepted the
seat allocation but have given full effect to the policy of the
respondents.
In acceptance of the legality and validity of the policy,
the petitioner submitted the application form, undertook the
entrance exam and participated in the counselling. As such the
judgment reported at AIR 2001 Rajasthan 105 would not be
applicable to the facts of the instant case.
Similarly in the judgment reported at AIR 1996 Gurarat
170, the court was concerned with the Government decision that
no reservation would be made in the payment seats and such
policy was upheld. There is no challenge to that effect in the
instant case. The respondents have contended that there is no
pronouncement stating that there can be no reservation
whatsoever in private institutions or in paid seats.
24.

Therefore, looked at from any angle assuming that

reservation was to be effected only in the Government DIET, there
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

is no seat available for allocation to the petitioners at the merit
position secured by them.

W.P.13655/2004 -Anuradha Vs. Govt. of NCT of

Delhi & Ors
(i)

This petitioner had applied for admission under the

reserved category for NCC cadets.
(ii)

The petitioner is stated to have secured rank number

1573. The petitioner has contended that the result for the DIETs
was declared on 14th July, 2004 for 800 seats. Only thereafter on
1st August 2004 the result for the admission to the 250 seats in the
private institutions was declared.
(iii)

The submission on behalf of the petitioner is that

keeping in view the stipulation in the brochure that the reservation
etc is the same for government DIETs and the private institutes.
Therefore

the respondents should have

effected

identical

reservation for the nine Government and four private institutes.
(iv)

According to learned

inasmuch as

counsel

for the petitioner

there were 250 seats in private institutions, the

W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 22 of 38

respondents were bound to have effected reservation of 1% of the
250 seats which should be 2.5 seats, rounded off to either two
seats or three seats. Similarly reservation in the private institutes
for the ex-servicemen category having been stipulated as being 1%
of the seats would be either two seats or three seats.
(v)

The petitioner contends that against this reservation

stipulation, the action of the respondents in reserving only one
seat in one private institute for the NCC quota candidate and four
seats for the ex-servicemen quota in this session is wholly illegal.
(vi)

As per the Brochure, the respondents have provided

reservation of one percent being 10 seats in the NCC reserved
category out of the total number of 1050 seats. As per the seats
allocation notified in the brochure and as noticed above, for the
academic session 2004 for the current session, the respondents
have provided that nine NCC seats would go to all the nine
Government DIETs and one seat would go to a private institution
having 100 seats this year. For the academic session 2005-2007, 6
seats for the NCC category candidates would be in the Govt. DIETs
having total intake strength of 100 students each and four in the
private institutions.
(vii)

The petitioner has challenged this policy and seat

W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 23 of 38

allocation on the ground that according to the stipulation
contained in the brochure, it was clearly provided that the
reservation for Government DIETs and private institutions were
the same. Reliance has been placed on the following stipulation
which is mentioned in the brochure:“The Course of Study, eligibility conditions,
reservation, selection procedure etc. for
recognised unaided Institutions will be same as
given in the prospectus for admission to ETE
Course at DIETs.”
(viii)

This stipulation is the whole basis of the petitioner's

challenge in this writ petition.
(ix)

The respondents have explained that reservation is not

effected institution-wise. If this was the scheme of reservation,
then reservation of 1% of the seats would not be possible in
institutions having less than 100 seats as one per cent of a number
less than 100 comes to a fraction of a seat which cannot be
allocated. In order to give effect to the complete purpose and
intendment of the scheme, the reservation has been effected out of
the total number of seats and thereafter distribution has been
made bearing in mind the requirement of ensuring fairness to
candidates as well as the institution and hence the reservation
being rotated between the two categories where in the 1%
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 24 of 38

reservation is possible i.e. the ex-servicemen and the NCC quota.
For this reason, the respondents have ensured that 1% of the total
number of seats is reserved and rotated between the institutions to
ensure that their total reserved quota is maintained at 1% out of
their individual seat allocation as well.
27.

I find that the scheme of respondents was not faulted by

the petitioner at any time hitherto. It was notified when she has
participated in the examination as well as the counselling and has
opted to litigate after the respondents have implemented the
scheme of admissions notified in the brochure. Even classes are
stated to have commenced on or around 1st August, 2004. This
writ petition has been filed thereafter on the 10th August, 2004.
28.

The petitioner has submitted that if the respondents had

effected the 1% reservation in the 250 seats available in the private
institutions, then two seats would have been available and the
petitioner would have got admission to the course under the NCC
quota.
The respondents have handed over the merit list of
selected candidates under the NCC category which reads as under

It is noteworthy that according to the respondents, the
petitioner was at serial number 11 of this list. Admittedly, she had
secured rank 1573 in the NCC quota. The candidate above the
petitioner namely Preeti Gehlawat had also secured rank 1573 but
was more meritorious than the petitioner.
29.

It is contended that the respondents have effected

admissions to 10 seats in the NCC quota and cannot be directed to
give admission to the petitioner in this reserved category as well as
inasmuch as the respondents would thereby exceed the 1%
reservation quota prescribed in the brochure. The respondents
contend that in any case, the petitioner was at serial number 11 in
the order of merit in this reserved category and only the first ten

W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 26 of 38

candidates were entitled to get seats, irrespective of whether they
were in the Government DIET or in the private institutions.
30.

I do not find any reason to hold that the method evolved

by the respondents is either arbitrary or illegal. Even assuming
that the contention of the petitioner that two or three seats were to
be reserved in the private DIETs out of the 250 seats, it is
noteworthy that there are four female candidates above the
petitioner in the order of merit. Assuming that serial numbers 1 to
9 were exhausted in the Government DIETs,the petitioner would
not have secured admission in the reserved category in the private
DIET.
31.

Furthermore, for so holding that the respondents were

required to effect 1% reservation out of the private institutions, it
has to be borne in mind that in three of the institutes, the total
permitted intake is only fifty candidates. One per cent of such fifty
candidates comes to a fraction i.e. 0.5 or a half seat. For this
reason also, there could not have been allocation of one seat in
these institutes. It is only in the private institute which has 100
seats that one seat could be allotted to meet the 1% reservation
quota.
32.

The petitioner in any case has challenged the policy and

W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 27 of 38

the seat allocation by the respondents after the commencement of
the admission process. Even the course had commenced on the
date of filing of the writ petition.
unsustainable.

The very

scheme

of admissions being

implemented is in place since 1988. I find no illegality in the
action of the respondents.
For all these reasons, I have no reason for holding in
favour of this petitioner in WP (C) No.13655/2004.
33.
W.P.(C) 17093/2004 entitled Daljeet Kaur Vs.
Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Ors.
(i)

This petitioner has contended that her mother was a

teacher in a school run by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and
therefore she had applied under two quotas. Firstly, in the general
quota and secondly, as a ward of a school teacher. The petitioner
has contended that she had participated in the common entrance
examination for the ETE course for the academic session
commencing in 2004. The examination was held on 20th June,
2004 and results were declared on 14th July, 2004. It is contended
that the petitioner's result was declared only in the general
category where she was shown as having secured merit rank 458.
(ii)

As per the public notice, 82 candidates had secured 458

W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 28 of 38

rank. Out of these students the respondent had admitted only 15
candidates.
(iii)

The petitioner submits that she had reached the Moti

Bagh site for counselling on the 20th July, 2004 which was the
notified date. The petitioner has contended that the Secretary of
the SCERT, respondent no. 3, told the petitioner to come for
counselling on the 2nd August, 2004.
On the 2nd August, 2004 the petitioner was not
considered and was not granted admission. Consequently, the
petitioner had sent a legal notice on 11th August, 2004 to the
respondents stating that she was entitled to admission.

Prior

it

is

contended

that

the

petitioner

had

representations on the 9th August, 2004, 10th August, 2004 and 11th
August, 2004.
(iv)

The petitioner has contended that only 15 students who

had secured rank 458 were given admission on 20th July, 2004 and
the rest were told to report at the Defence Colony office of the
respondents on 2nd August, 2004 for deposit of fees and
submission of forms. However when the petitioner reached the
office on 2nd August, 2004 to deposit fees and documents she was
denied admission on the ground that admission to all categories
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 29 of 38

were over and closed on 20th July, 2004.
(v)

The petitioner submitted that her mother suffered

poisoning in suspicious circumstances on the 28th August, 2004
and was hospitalised thereafter. The mother of the petitioner was
undergoing severe depression and had not resumed her duty as
well and in these circumstances the petitioner was prevented from
agitating her right by way of the instant writ petition.
In these circumstances, it is contended that the
petitioner has filed the writ petition on the first available
opportunity and that there is just cause for the delay in her
approaching this court by way of the present writ petition. On
behalf of the petitioner it has been contended that the explanation
given for the petitioner invoking the writ jurisdiction of this court
long after classes for the course had commenced in August, 2004
should be accepted and the writ petition considered on merits.
(vi)

The respondents have appeared in answer to the notice

to show cause and placed on record their counter affidavit. It is
submitted by the respondents that the petitioner did not appear in
the counselling deliberately. It is submitted that as per the notice
notified in the newspaper, the candidates were fully aware that
admissions to the reserved category were to be effected on 21st
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 30 of 38

July,2004. The respondents had also prepared the merit list as
per the scheme notified in the public notice of all the candidates
who had secured merit rank 458. The petitioner was placed at
serial no. 46 of such list. It is submitted that irrespective of the
reserved category, the candidates are first arranged in the order of
merit. All such candidates are considered for allocation against
the general quota seats.
It is pointed out by the respondents that the total
number of seats available for allotment in the general category
were 385. The respondents were able to effect admissions to 370
seats up to merit rank 393, leaving a balance of 15 seats.
According to the respondents, 15 candidates who had
secured 458 rank were filled up out of the merit list prepared of
the candidates who had secured such rank. These candidates were
admitted to Government DIETs. As such, in all 385 seats are
stated to be filled up in the general category on the 20th July, 2004.
(vii)

According to the respondents, out of the 82 candidates

who secured rank 458, only 61 candidates had appeared for
counselling on 20th July, 2004.

The petitioner's name had

appeared at serial no. 46 of the merit list of these candidates.
On 21st July, 2004 counselling for the reserved
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 31 of 38

categories was taken up. If the petitioner had participated in the
counselling on this date, she would have been admitted under the
category for which she was also entitled but unfortunately, for
reasons best known to herself she did not appear.
(viii)

The

respondents

have

submitted

that

all

those

candidates who were present and had secured 458 rank and had
the requisite certificate of their respective category in which they
were seeking admission, were granted admission. The only reason
that the petitioner did not secure the admission was because she
did not appear on this date.
It has been stated on affidavit that when counselling was
held for the reserved category candidates, 24 candidates who were
eligible for admission in various reserved categories were granted
admission. The respondents have denied that any announcement
was made that counselling for other category candidates would be
undertaken on 2nd August, 2004.
It has also been pointed out that after completion of the
counselling for the Government DIETs, the respondents held
counselling for private institutions on 28th July, 2004.

The

petitioner could have been considered for admission even in the
private institutions as her name appeared on the merit list. But as
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 32 of 38

the petitioner did not report, such candidates who were present
and wanted to take admissions to the private institutions were
granted admissions.
(ix)

The respondents submit that the petitioner did not care

to turn up for the counselling even on 2nd August, 2004 and that,
had she appeared on such date, the petitioner would have been
granted admission to the private institutions. It was submitted
that the fault being fastened for her non-appearance upon the
respondents is without basis and unjustified.
(x)

The respondents have also disputed the receipt of any

letter from the petitioner on 2nd August, 2004. It is submitted that
the only letters received were dated 9th August, 2004 and 10th
August, 2004 when she was informed that she had been denied
admission as she had failed to appear on the requisite dates and
that nothing could be done to assist her.
(xi)

The respondents have challenged the maintainability of

the writ petition on ground of delay and laches and submitted that
admissions to all the Government DIETs were full on 30 th July,
2004 and that the course having commenced she cannot be
granted admission even if vacancies are available.
34.

The issues raised in Daljit Kaur's petition are purely in

W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 33 of 38

the realm of facts. There is no dispute whatsoever to the merit
position of the petitioner. On the contrary, the respondents have
fairly stated that the petitioner was eligible and entitled for
admission to the reserved category in the Government DIET. The
only reason that she could not be granted admission is her nonappearance.

It was disputed that the petitioner appeared for

counselling on the 2nd August, 2004. The respondents have made
deposition on affidavit with regard to her non-appearance on the
date of counselling.
35.

I find no reason to disbelieve the statement made by the

respondents. The petitioner ought to have been vigilant inasmuch
as the public notice itself stated that a candidate should see
his/her result in the general as well as the reserved list. The
instruction no. 1 set out in the public notice clearly stipulated that
provisionally selected candidate were required to report for
allotment and admission in DIETs and private institutions on 20th
and 21st July, 2004 as per the schedule given in the notice. The
respondents have notified that any candidate who did not appear
for counselling on the specified date and time, shall forfeit his/her
right for admission to the ETE course and that no request for
change in counselling date would be entertained.

The public

W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 34 of 38

notice stipulated that on 20th July, 2004, counselling for general
category candidates from rank 1 to 233 would be held from 9 a.m.
and that counselling for candidates who had secured merit rank
283 to 458 would be held at 1 p.m.

The public notice also

stipulated that the counselling for candidates in the OBC/SC and
ST ward categories would be held from 9 a.m. on the 21st July,
2004.
36.

Assuming that the petitioner could not be admitted to

the general category list on 20th July, 2004, the petitioner was
aware that she has applied under the School Teacher Ward
Category as well and as such ought to have appeared for the
counselling on 21st July, 2004. The petitioner had been put to
notice with regard to the requirement of certificates which she had
to produce.
37.

I am unable to believe that the petitioner was told to

appear on 2nd August, 2004.

The petitioner ought to have

appeared on the date and time stipulated alongwith the requisite
documents as were notified in the public notice itself.

The

respondents have given the explanation as to the manner in which
the list is taken out. In case the petitioner was entertaining doubts
of any kind, the same could have been clarified by her immediately
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 35 of 38

when the result was published.
38.

The petitioner has placed reliance on a judgment of this

court reported at 2003 IV AD Delhi 206 entitled Manju vs Lt.
Governor & Ors., I find that the issue raised in this case related to
the validity and genuineness of the certificate of participation in
the Education For All Programme conducted by the respondents.
Inasmuch as there were doubts expressed in respect of the same,
the court had directed inquiry and in this circumstance
entertained the writ petition and admission was granted.

The

order made in the petitioner's favour in the decision has

no

bearing on the issues raised in the present case.
The petitioner also relied on the judgment reported by
the Apex Court at 2000 AIR 2004 SC 5043 entitled Dolly Cha vs
Chairman JEE to contend that the court should not apply strict
rules of proof and the submission of the petitioner should be
believed. This judgment is also of no benefit inasmuch as this
court is not being called upon to effect relaxation in rules or
procedure in the instant case.
39.

The main opposition to the writ petition is based on the

fact that the course had commenced on the 30th July, 2004 and the
petitioner approached this court only in October, 2004. In these
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 36 of 38

circumstances, the issue which has to be considered relates to the
permissibility of effecting mid-session admissions.
In this behalf, the respondents have placed reliance on
the observations of this court in the judgment reported at 2003 IV
AD (Delhi) 477 entitled Smt. Tarawati vs. SCERT. It would be
useful to reproduce the observations of the court in para 19 of the
petitioner which are to the following effect :“19. Principles of laches, to my mind, impeded
the grant of any relief in these Writ Petition.
These petitioners would have to be
accommodated either midway the course or in
the academic year 2003-2004, in respect of
which third parties will be affected. In the
former course such an approach would run
counter to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Medical Council of India Vs.
Madhu Singh and others, (2002) 7 SCC
258: 2002(6) SCALE 332, in which a Two
Judge bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
deprecated midsession admission.”
40.

The petitioner, therefore, cannot possibly be granted

admission at this stage. I have however already held that the
petitioner had been put to notice in the public notice published by
the respondents to the effect that counselling would be held in the
reserved categories on 21st July, 2004 and that the petitioner ought
to have made herself available for counselling alongwith the
requisite certificates.
W.P.(C) 12272, 12287, 13655 & 17093/2004

page 37 of 38

41.

In this view of the matter, the petitioner in the instant

case cannot be granted any relief on any equitable considerations
as well even if her contention that she was directed to report on 2 nd
August, 2004 was to be believed.
I, therefore, find no merit in the writ petition.
42.

In view of the foregoing observations, the writ petitions

are hereby dismissed.
There shall be no order as to costs.
