1.

This application has been filed by the plaintiff under the

provisions of Order 9 Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying
for setting aside of the order dated 23rd February, 2004
dismissing the suit of the plaintiff for default of appearance. The
plaintiff has contended that the matter was listed before the Joint
Registrar under orders of the court on 6th January, 2004 and the
CS(OS) No. 441/2003

page 1 of 9

same was renotified to 28th April, 2004. The plaintiff/applicant
did not have notice or information regarding the listing of case on
23rd February, 2004 and consequently had not appeared in the
matter.
2.

The plaintiff has further pointed out that the present case

was being listed alongwith CS(OS) No. 446/2003.

On 6th

January, 2004 the suit had been renotified by the Joint Registrar
for admission/denial of documents on 28th April, 2004.
It is asserted that none appeared on behalf of the plaintiff in
these circumstances on 23rd February, 2004 and for this reason
this court has dismissed the suit on this date.
3.

So far as information with regard to the dismissal of the case

is concerned, learned counsel for the applicant has pointed out
that CS(OS) No. 446/2003 was listed for hearing on 13th April,
2004. On this date, the plaintiff found that the present suit being
CS(OS) No. 441/2003 was not listed. Consequently, counsel for
the plaintiff moved an urgent application for inspection of the
record of the present case on 15th April, 2004. On inspection of
the record of this case, it was revealed that the suit had been
dismissed for default of appearance.

This application was

consequently drafted immediately thereafter and was filed in this
CS(OS) No. 441/2003

page 2 of 9

court on 27th April, 2004.
It is further contended that the application has been filed
within 30 days of the knowledge of the dismissal of the suit which
was obtained on 15th April, 2004.
4.

The application has been strongly opposed on behalf of the

defendants. Mr. Neeraj Kaul, learned senior counsel representing
the defendant no. 1- Institute has submitted that the application is
malafide and deserves to be dismissed on grounds of the
fraudulent conduct on the part of the plaintiff. It is pointed out
that alongwith the application, the plaintiff has enclosed what
according to it is a true copy of the order dated 6th January, 2004.
However the order enclosed as an annexure with the application is
an incomplete reproduction of the correct order. According to
learned senior counsel the defendant is guilty of fraud and
deliberate concealment of material facts inasmuch as the portion
of the order dated 6th January, 2004 which has not been typed is
the part which records that the plaintiff had been absenting
himself from the proceedings for the last two dates and this fact
was noticed in the order dated 6th January, 2004.

Placing

reliance on the pronouncement of the Apex Court in AIR 1994
SC 853 S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (dead) by L.Rs. v.
CS(OS) No. 441/2003

page 3 of 9

Jagannath (dead) by L.Rs. & Ors., it has been urged that the
present application deserves to be rejected on this short ground
alone inasmuch as the Apex Court has held that fraud and
concealment of material facts disentitle a party to any relief and
that the plaintiff who is guilty of such conduct is required to be
non-suited at the earliest.

It is further contended that the

application does not show sufficient cause for setting aside of the
order dated 23rd February, 2004.
5.

I have heard learned counsel for the parties and given my

considered thought to the respective contentions.
6.

From a close perusal of the record, I find that on the 6th

January, 2004, the Joint Registrar had placed IA No. 8577/2003
before the court on 23rd February, 2004 for the reason hat the
plaintiff had failed to file a reply thereto.
So far as the further proceedings in the suit are concerned,
on 6th January, 2004 the Joint Registrar had given time to the
plaintiff to file its replication to the written statement of the
defendants within a period of two weeks. The parties were also
directed to file original documents within a period of four weeks
and the matter was directed to be renotified for completion of
pleadings and admission/denial of documents for 28th April,
CS(OS) No. 441/2003

page 4 of 9

2004. Thus the suit was adjourned for further proceedings to 28th
April, 2004.

IA No. 2245/2003 was also listed on 6th January,

2004 and it was directed that pleadings in this application be
completed. There was no date fixed in this application.
7.

When the matter was listed before the court on 23rd

February, 2004 for hearing of IA NO. 8577/2003 only defendant
nos. 1, 3 and 4 who were the applicants in this application were
represented before the court. The matter was taken up after being
passed over once. However none appeared for the plaintiff on
both calls. It was not pointed out to the court on this date that the
suit stood adjourned for further proceedings to 28th April, 2004
before the Joint Registrar.

In these circumstances, the court

under an erroneous impression that the suit itself was listed for
hearing, noticed the non-appearance on behalf of the plaintiff and
also the fact that there had been no appearance for the plaintiff
before the Joint Registrar on previous dates and dismissed the suit
in default.
IA Nos. 8577/2003 and 2245/2003 were consequently
dismissed as infructuous.
8.

It is evident that the suit having been adjourned to 28th

April, 2004, could not have been taken up for hearing on 23rd
CS(OS) No. 441/2003

page 5 of 9

February, 2004. The absence of the plaintiff in the proceedings in
the suit on 23rd February, 2004 cannot therefore be faulted. The
court had every jurisdiction to proceed on the application which
was listed for hearing on that date. However, in view of the order
of dismissal being passed in the suit, the application was dismissed
as infructuous.
9.

It is trite that no act of the court should prejudice a party.

This error in taking up the suit for hearing on 23rd February, 2004
and dismissing the same is the consequence of an erroneous
impression that the suit was listed. Therefore in view of the order
passed on 6th January, 2004, the order dated 23rd February,
2004 dismissing the suit cannot be sustained.
10.

Mr. Neeraj Kaul, learned senior counsel appearing for the

defendant has urged at great length that the plaintiff's application
for restoration of the suit deserves to be dismissed for the reason
that the plaintiff has deliberately and fraudulently enclosed an
incomplete copy of the order with the application and that the
same amounts to material misrepresentation and fraud.
11.

I find that undoubtedly the copy of the order dated 6th

January, 2004 which has been enclosed as an annexure with the
application is incomplete.

However I find that Mr. Subodh

CS(OS) No. 441/2003

page 6 of 9

Pathak, learned counsel representing the plaintiff has filed an
affidavit dated 12th December, 2005 explaining that the copy of the
order which was enclosed with IA No. 2888/2004 was incomplete
and came to be filed on account of a bonafide error. It has been
submitted that what came to be filed as a copy of the order, was
actually notes of inspection of learned counsel which was not a
complete copy. It is pointed out that the complete proceedings
were on record before this court in the original record.
12.

I have carefully considered the explanation given on behalf

of the plaintiff. Perusal of the application shows that the same was
drafted shortly after the stated date of inspection.

Learned

counsel for the plaintiff has sworn an affidavit that the error in
enclosing a written copy of the order has occurred on account of
the haste in the application was drafted and in any case he has
expressed regret for the error. Having regard to the complete
conspectus of the facts noticed hereinabove, I am inclined to
accept the bonafide of learned counsel for the plaintiff and the
explanation which has been rendered for inclusion of such
incomplete copy of the order as an annexure in the form in which
it has been done. Counsel has stated that the same is only a note
of the inspection of the orders passed by this court and that
CS(OS) No. 441/2003

page 7 of 9

reliance is placed on the order which exist on the file.
13.

There can be no dispute with the principles laid down by the

Apex Court in AIR 1994 SC 853 S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu
(dead) by L.Rs. v. Jagannath (dead) by L.Rs. & Ors. and
the same bind this court. However, the same have to be applied in
the facts and circumstances of each case.
14.

Having considered the rival contentions and having perused

the record, I find force in the explanation rendered by counsel for
the plaintiff so far as the filing of the incomplete order is
concerned.

Learned counsel has expressed a regret for the

mistake and I am inclined to accept the explanation rendered.
There is no requirement in law for filing of a copy of the relevant
order in support of an application under Order 9 of the Code of
Civil Procedure wherein a prayer is made for setting aside of the
ex-parte proceedings.
15.

In view of the above discussion, I am further of the view that

the suit was not listed on 23rd February, 2004 and stood
adjourned to 28th April, 2004. As such the same could not have
been taken up for hearing and dismissed for default of appearance
on 23rd February, 2004. In the instant case, I have accepted the
explanation given by the counsel for the plaintiff regarding the
CS(OS) No. 441/2003

page 8 of 9

annexure which was filed.

However, undoubtedly more care

should have been taken at the time of filing of the application and
the same ought not to have been filed in such casual manner.
Furthermore, I find from the record that the present case is being
pursued casually by the plaintiff who has not cared to even
complete the pleadings so far. Consequently, while allowing the
application, in my view the plaintiff deserves to pay costs which
are quantified at Rs.20,000/- which shall be apportioned equally
between the defendant no. 1 and the Delhi High Court Legal
Services Committee.
Subject to the payment of costs, the order dated 23rd
February, 2004 is therefore set aside.
Costs shall be paid within two weeks from today.
