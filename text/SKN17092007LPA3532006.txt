SANJIV KHANNA, J:
1.

The present Letters Patent Appeal is directed against order

dated 2

nd

December, 2005 passed by the learned Single Judge

dismissing the writ petition of the appellant. In the said writ petition, the
appellant no.1 had challenged orders dated 9

th

May, 2002, 29

th

LPA NOS. 353-54 OF 2006
September, 2003 and 16

th

Page No. 2
August, 2004 passed by the National

Commission constituted under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986
(hereinafter referred to as the Act, for short).
th

2.

The appellant, who appeared in person, argued that on 9 May,

2002, the National Commission had while reserving its order in First
Appeal No. 49/1995 titled Ravinder Kumar versus Surender Kumar Mittal
granted time to the parties to file their written synopsis and these were
subsequently filed but the National Commission proceeded to dispose of
th

the appeal itself on 9 May, 2002 by dictating an order in chamber. It was
also stated by the appellant that no arguments were heard and
th

addressed by parties on 9 May, 2002. Thus there has been violation of
principles of natural justice. The subsequent orders also made subject
th

matter of the writ petition, being orders dated 29 September, 2003 and
16

th

August, 2004, are passed by the National Commission on the

review/recall applications filed by the appellant.
3.

The appellant had entered into an agreement with the respondent

No. 2, Mr. Ravinder Kumar for purchase of the second floor of property
No. D-44/6, East of Kailash, New Delhi for a total cost of Rs.7,00,000/-.

LPA NOS. 353-54 OF 2006

Page No. 3

The second floor was to be constructed by the respondent no.2. The
construction was to start in November, 1991 and was to be completed by
end of April, 1992.

The possession was however delivered to the

appellant-claimant in August, 1992 after the respondent No.2-contractor
had received the final payment in July, 1992. The appellant was not
satisfied with the quality of construction and claimed Rs.1,00,000/- as
devaluation of the work done with interest as well as damages for the
delay in construction.
4.

The appellant succeeded before the State Commission, pursuant to

which the appeal was filed before the National Commission by the
respondent No.2.
5.

By the impugned order dated 9

th

May, 2002, learned National

Commission allowed the appeal of the respondent setting out reasons in
detail.
6.

Learned counsel for the respondent No.2 has disputed and

contested the submissions of the appellant that oral arguments were not
th

addressed before the National Commission on 9 May, 2002. It was
stated that both the parties were given full opportunity to present and

LPA NOS. 353-54 OF 2006

Page No. 4

urge their cases on the said date. Thus, it is a case of the respondent
th

No.2 that proper hearing was held before the order dated 9 May, 2002
was passed.
7.

There is no method by which this Court can verify whether
th

arguments were addressed by both the parties on 9 May, 2002. Under
Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, there is a statutory presumption
that official acts have been validly done and performed as per law. Ills.
(e) to Section 114 elucidates that when an official act is proved to have
been done, it will be presumed that the official or judicial act has been
regularly done. The presumption about validity and regularity is rebutable
and not conclusive, but onus to prove to the contrary is on the person
who seeks to rebut the presumption. The presumption can be rebuted by
cogent and relevant material. (See, Devinder Pal Singh versus State
of NCT of Delhi reported in (2002) 5 SCC 234; State of Himachal
Pradesh versus Narender Kumar reported in (2004) 4 SCC 567 and
Hari Singh versus State of U.P. reported in (1984) 2 SCC 624).
8.

We do not think that appellant has been able to dispel and rebut the
th

said presumption. Order dated 9 May, 2002 is a detailed order dealing

LPA NOS. 353-54 OF 2006

Page No. 5

with various aspects and contentions raised by the parties. It specifically
records that the learned counsel for the appellants had raised three
arguments on the basis of which it was contended that the State
Commission had gone wrong. It further records that the appellant, who is
also an advocate, had argued to the contrary and had stated that the
respondent was guilty of delay in giving possession and the material used
in the construction of the house was of poor quality. Learned Members of
the National Commission have specifically observed that they had heard
the arguments and perused the material on record.

Thereafter, the

Members had given their reasons which elaborately deal with various
contentions of the parties. In these circumstances, we do not see any
reason not to agree and accept the contention of the respondent No.2
that arguments were addressed by the parties before the National
th

Commission on 9 May, 2002.
9.

It is a fact that the parties had filed their written synopsis after 9

th

May, 2002. However, it has not been pointed out and shown to us that
th

the order dated 9 May, 2002 does not deal with the contentions and
arguments raised and mentioned in the written synopsis.

Written

LPA NOS. 353-54 OF 2006

Page No. 6

synopsis can only record in writing, the arguments raised orally and the
contentions made at the time of hearing. Written synopsis/arguments
cannot go beyond what is argued orally. It may be relevant to state here
that the National Commission in it's subsequent orders had taken care to
examine the contentions on merits raised by the appellant in the written
submission and found that no ground was made out to take a different
view that what had been taken earlier.
10.

An order passed by the National Commission in a first appeal

can be made subject matter of Special Leave Petition before the
Supreme Court but not in an appeal before the Supreme Court. Even if
it is conceded and accepted that an order passed by the National
Commission in a first appeal can be made subject matter of challenge in
a writ court, power of judicial review by its very nature is limited.
Interference is required and desirable when there is grave miscarriage of
justice, a palpably wrong order contrary to law and principles of natural
justice has been passed, or there is lack of jurisdiction. These principles
are well established and need no further elaboration. It would suffice to
refer to the observations made by Supreme Court in the cases of Tata

LPA NOS. 353-54 OF 2006

Page No. 7

Cellular versus Union of India reported in (1994) 6 SCC 651; New
Horizons Limited and Another versus Union of India and Others
reported in (1995) 1 SCC 478 and Govt. of A. P. versus Mohd.
Nasrullah Khan reported in (2006) 2 SCC 373. Further a relief under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India is always discretionary and it has
to be normally shown and established that prejudice has been caused. In
the present case contentions raised by the parties have been considered
th

and dealt with by the National Commission in the order dated 9 May,
2002, even though the written synopsis were filed later on. Nonavailability of written synopsis before the National Commission has not
made any difference as contentions raised and argued were considered
and decided by the National Commission. The appellant has not been
able to prove and show that any prejudice has been caused to him (See,
Om Prakash Mann versus Director of Education (basic) and Others
reported in (2006) 7 SCC 558 and P.D. Agrawal versus State Bank of
India and Others reported in (2006) 8 SCC 776;). National Commission
has also examined the written synopsis and taken the same into
consideration while dismissing the review applications.

In this view of the matter, we uphold the order of the learned

Single Judge holding, inter alia, that no case has been made out for
exercising of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. No
costs.
