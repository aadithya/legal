PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of

India lays a challenge to the order dated 28.7.2007 passed by the
learned Additional District Judge, Delhi whereby w.e.f. 08.03.2007
interim monthly

maintenance granted to Ms. Ms.Geetika was

enhanced from Rs,3500/- to Rs.11,000/-.
2.

Back drop facts leading to the filing of the present

petition are that on 06.03.1987 the marriage between the petitioner
Shri N.P.Kaushik and the respondent Smt. Suman Kaushik was
solemnized

as per Hindu rites and ceremonies. On 15.1.1988 a

daughter Ms.Geetika was born out of the said wedlock.

Unfortunately, the marriage turned sour and the parties

started living separately.

Their daughter Ms.Geetika

started

residing with her mother i.e. the respondent.
4.
Section 33

In the year 1995 Ms.Geetika filed a civil suit under
CPC

and Section 20 of the Hindu Adoption &

Maintenance Act,1956 against her father i.e. the petitioner claiming
a maintenance of Rs.2,000/- per month from him. Since Ms.Geetika
was a minor the respondent being her mother was prosecuting the
said suit on her behalf.
5.

In the afore-noted suit, an application dated 4.10.1995

was filed by the respondent seeking interim maintenance at
Rs.2,000/- per month from the petitioner. Thereafter, an application
for amendment of the plaint was moved by the respondent which
was allowed by the learned Trial Court vide order dated 13.9.2004.
As per the amended plaint, maintenance in sum of Rs.3,500/- per
month was claimed from the petitioner.
6.

Consequent to the filing of the afore-noted suit, in the

year 1997, the petitioner filed a divorce petition under Section
13(1)(ia)(ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 against the respondent.
7.

During the pendency of the said divorce petition, the

respondent filed an application under Sections 24 & 26 of the Hindu
Marriage Act,1955 claiming interim maintenance for Ms.Geetika
from the petitioner.
8.

Vide order dated 28.10.1999 the learned Trial Court

before whom the divorce petition was pending awarded interim
CM(M) No.1535/07

page 2 of 9

maintenance in sum of Rs.3,000/- per month in favour of Ms.Geetika.
The amount of interim maintenance was directed to be shared
equally by the petitioner and the respondent.
9.

Against the order dated 28.10.1999 passed by the

learned Trial Court, a revision petition was filed before this court.
10.

Vide order dated 27.11.2001 this court enhanced the

amount of interim maintenance from Rs.3,000/- per to Rs.3,500/- per
month.

Further in order to secure the future of Ms.Geetika, this

court directed the parties to invest a

sum of Rs.5 lacs in

an

insurance policy.
11.

Pursuant to order dated 27.11.2001 passed by this court

the petitioner and the respondent purchased insurance policies in
the name of Ms.Geetika in sum of Rs.3 lacs and Rs.2 lacs
respectively.
12.

Thereafter, the respondent filed various applications

seeking enhancement of interim maintenance granted by order
dated 27.11.2001. The applications are pending adjudication.
13.

On 19.9.2005,

two applications were filed by the

respondent in the suit by her under Section 33 CPC and Section 20
of Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act,1956.
14.

First application was under Order VII Rule 14 CPC

seeking to file additional documents namely fee slips of Ms.Geetika
for the Class-VI, Class-XII and B.Tech Course.
15.

Second application was under Section 151 CPC seeking

enhancement of interim maintenance from Rs.2,000/- per month to
CM(M) No.1535/07

page 3 of 9

Rs.3,500/- per month.

In the said application it was pleaded that

Ms.Geetika had turned 17 years of age and that her expenses have
increased to more than Rs.15,000/- per month.
16.
allowed.

Vide order dated 02.05.2006 both the applications were
Relevant portion of the order of learned Trial Court reads

under :
“So for copies of fee receipts of classes are
concerned the same pertains to the year 1999
and 1998 and other receipts of class XII and BTech pertains to the period for the year 2004 and
2005 respectively and apparently the same are
beyond the original petition. It is a fact that this
case has been pending since the year 1995 either
because in between the judicial proceedings there
were chances of
compromise or during the
proceedings pending before the Hon'ble High
Court of Delhi, the proceedings in other court were
under stay as compromise was in progress and in
between the period the applicant progressed her
academic career year after year from one class to
other class.
There is a situation that if the
documents are permitted to be allowed it would
be
beyond the original plaint/application,
however,
considering
the
continuity
of
proceedings and in the larger interest of justice,
the application is allowed to file record of fee
receipts of class VI, class XII, B-Tech course
subject to formal proof in evidence as well as with
liberty to the respondent to raise appropriate
objections, tenable under the law.
x x x x
Therefore, considering totality of circumstances
that the applicant's mother Smt. Suman Kaushik
and
applicant's
father
Sh.N.P.Kaushik
are
employed gainfully and they both are required to
maintain the child/ applicant Ms.Geetika during
the pendency of main petition U/S 20 of the Act.
Hence an interim maintenance of Rs.3,500/- is
allowed to the applicant to be contributed equally
by applicant's parents i.e. the mother and the
father till the disposal of the main application. The
CM(M) No.1535/07

page 4 of 9

applicant request for such maintenance from the
date of application i.e. 19.09.1995, however,
considering the facts that the applicant is getting
interim maintenance w.e.f. May,1997 @ Rs.3,500/PM from her parents in the proceedings U/S 26
r/w 24 of Hindu Marriage Act in other courts,
therefore, without prejudice to her legal rights,
the maintenance would be payable w.e.f. the date
of order i.e. 02.05.2006.
It is a settled preposition of law that an interim
maintenance can be received once and there is no
provision of law to claim separate interim
maintenance in different proceedings, therefore,
the interim maintenance @ Rs.3,500/- PM will be
received by the applicant from either of the court
i.e. either from the present court or from the other
court where proceedings U/S 26 r/w 24 are
pending, since rate of interim maintenance is
Rs.3,500/-. Any observation made in the present
order would not tantamount to be final opinion on
the merits of the case and same is without
prejudice to the rights of both parties.
The applicant requests that there are expenses
more than Rs.15,000/- p.m., however the interim
maintenance amount cannot exceed the amount
prayed in the main application. . . . .”
17.

Meanwhile Ms.Geetika attained majority and appointed

the respondent as her attorney for the purposes of prosecuting the
suit filed on her behalf under Section 33 CPC and Section 20 of the
Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act.
18.

Pursuant

to

the

order

dated

02.05.2006,

the

respondent moved an application under Order VI Rule 17 CPC
seeking amendment of the plaint which was allowed by the learned
Trial Court vide order dated 15.5.2007. As per the amended plaint,
maintenance in sum of Rs.15,000/- per month was claimed by the
petitioner.

CM(M) No.1535/07

19.

On 08.03.2007 another application under Section 151

CPC was filed by the respondent seeking enhancement of interim
maintenance from Rs.3,500/- per month to Rs.15,000/- per month.
Enhanced maintenance was claimed on the ground that the salary
of the petitioner has increased, educational expenses of Ms.Geetika
have increased and price index of essential commodities has gone
up due to inflation.
20.

Vide impugned order dated 28.07.2007 the application

filed by the respondent was allowed and interim maintenance was
enhanced from Rs.3,500/- per month to to Rs.11,000/- per month.
Relevant portion of the order reads as under :“12. In my humble opinion, the dispute between
mother and the father should not effect the
study of the children. Since the plaintiff i an only
daughter, she has every right to be brought up
as a daughter of affluent parents. At the same
time, Rs.24,000/- per annum as tuition charges
(computer) and Rs.24,000/- per annum as the
tuition charges (Math) can be easily avoided. As
if the student is attentive in classes and do
her/his homework regularly and
sincerely at
home, no tuition is required, Hence, I am of the
considered opinion that Rs.24,000/- per annum as
tuition charges (Math) can be saved by the
plaintiff. After excluding Rs.24,000/- per month
as tuition charges (computer) and Rs.24,000/- per
annum per annum as tuition charges (Math), the
average
monthly
expenditure
comes
to
Rs.11,000/- approximately. . . . . . . Needless to
say in such like situation, the welfare and future of
the child was to be considered as paramount
consideration.
13. Consequently, the application of the plaintiff
under Section 151 CPC
for enhancement/
modification of the order dated 02.05.2006
granting interim maintenance to the plaintiff is
liable to be allowed and the same is allowed. The
CM(M) No.1535/07

page 6 of 9

interim monthly maintenance of the plaintiff is
enhanced from, Rs.3500/- to Rs.11,000/- (eleven
thousand only) per month to be shared equally
by the mother of the plaintiff and the father of
the plaintiff from the date of filing of the
application i.e. 08.03.2007 onwards. Ordered
accordingly.
21.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has challenged the

impugned order dated 28.07.07 on following four counts:i)

The petitioner is under no obligation to maintain his

daughter Ms.Geetika for the reason she has attained majority.
ii)

Order dated 27.11.01 passed by this court granting

interim maintenance in sum of Rs.3,500/- per month to Ms.Geetika
has attained finality and therefore the trial court was not justified in
awarding a maintenance higher than what is awarded by this court.
iii)

Learned Trial Court has based its decision on the

premise that Ms.Geetika is pursuing B.Tech course and her
educational expenses have increased. This fact was well pleaded by
the respondent in the application dated 19.09.95 wherein interim
maintenance in sum of Rs.3,500/- per month was claimed from the
petitioner. This fact was duly considered in the order dated
02.05.06. Thus, the learned Trial Court has committed an error in
holding this fact as a changed circumstance and enhancing the
interim maintenance from Rs.3,500/- per month to Rs.11,000/- per
month.
iv)

Order

awarding

Rs.3,500/-

per

month

as

interim

maintenance to Ms.Geetika is dated 02.05.06. The application
seeking enhancement of maintenance awarded under order dated
CM(M) No.1535/07

page 7 of 9

02.05.06 is 08.03.07. It is highly improbable that the circumstances
would change so much between the interregnum period of ten
months to justify enhancement of maintenance from Rs.3,500/- per
month to Rs.11,000/- per month.
22.

As regards first contention, suffice would it be to note

the judgment of the Supreme Court in the decision reported as
Jagdish Jugtawat v Manjulata & Ors. (2002) 5 SCC 422 wherein it
was held that the right of a major girl for maintenance from parents
after attaining majority till her marriage is recognized in Section 20
(3) of the Hindu Adoptions & Maintenance Act. Therefore, the
petitioner cannot escape from his obligation to maintain his
daughter on the ground that she has attained majority.
23.

Order dated 27.11.2001 passed by this court related to

the proceedings under Sections 24 and 26 of the Hindu Marriage
Act, 1955 whereas the impugned order dated 28.07.07 relate to the
proceedings

under

Section

20

of

the

Hindu

Adoption

and

Maintenance Act, 1956. Proceedings under Section 20 of the Hindu
Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 are independent and have no
correlation with the proceedings under Section 24 and 26 of the
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
24.

Even otherwise, much water has flown the Yamuna since

the order dated 27.11.01 of this court awarding a sum of Rs.3,500/per month as interim maintenance in favour of Ms.Geetika.
25.

A perusal of the order dated 02.05.06, as noted in para

16 above, shows that the fact of Ms.Geetika pursuing B.Tech course
CM(M) No.1535/07

page 8 of 9

was only noted and not considered by the learned Trial Court while
awarding interim maintenance in sum of Rs.3,500/- per month for
the reason the amount of maintenance claimed in the plaint from
the petitioner was limited to Rs.3,500/- per month.
26.

As already noted, this defect in the plaint was removed

by the respondent by effecting amendment in the plaint and
claiming a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month as maintenance from the
petitioner. Therefore, learned counsel for the petitioner was not
justified in arguing that the fact of Ms.Geetika pursuing B.Tech
course was considered in the order dated 02.05.06
27.

I find no substance in the last contention advanced by

the learned counsel for the petitioner that period of ten months is
too less for the circumstances to be changed. Circumstances can
change overnight. A person who is unemployed on a given day
might get a job next morning and starts earning good amount.
28.

Changed circumstances which justify enhancement of

interim maintenance are clearly spelt out in the impugned order
dated 28.07.07. I find no reasons to differ with the decision of the
learned Trial Court.
29.

The petition is dismissed.

30.

No costs.
