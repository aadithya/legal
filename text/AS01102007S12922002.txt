ARUNA SURESH, J.
Plaintiff filed the present suit under Order 37 of
the Code of Civil Procedure for recovery of Rs.36,92,300/claiming to be the liquidated sum on the basis of contract i.e.
Agreement to sell dated 9.12.2000 in respect of property
bearing No.11/105 Subhash Nagar, Delhi. The plaintiff had
paid earnest money of Rs.3,21,000/- and also paid an advance
of Rs.22,00,000/- to the defendants on different dates.
CS(OS) No.1292/2002

On

Page 1 of 5

persistent refusal of the defendants to show the title
documents,

the

plaintiff

was

forced

to

sign

another

agreement in order to get his amount which he had already
paid to the defendants. The original consideration was
reduced by Rs.2.25 lacs in the subsequent agreement dated
13.9.2001.

Since

plaintiff

found

the

defendants

had

defrauded him by fabricating false documents in order to get
the property converted from leasehold to freehold, he
demanded back his money given for the purchase of the
property to which the defendants agreed and sought three
months time to refund the same. Since defendants failed to
return back the money, plaintiff lodged First Information
Report being FIR No.301/2002 under Sections 420 and
120(b) IPC against the defendant and filed the present suit
for recovery of Rs.26,01,000/- the amount paid as advance
and the earnest money. Plaintiff also claimed interest at the
rate of 24% amounting to Rs.7,70,300/- and Rs.3,21,000/double

the

earnest

money,

in

all

a

total

sum

of

Rs.36,92,300/-.

2.

Defendants contested this suit and filed an

application for leave to defend. Vide detailed judgment dated
2.5.2006 the Court was pleased to decree the suit of the
plaintiff

for

total

sum

of

Rs.29,22,000/-

with

interest

pendente lite and future at the rate of 9% p.a.

However,

defendants were granted unconditional leave to defend and
contest the suit of the plaintiff for a sum of Rs.7,70,300/-, the
amount of interest claimed by the plaintiff against the
defendants at the rate of 24% p.a. till the filing of the suit.

3.

In view of this judgment dated 2.5.2006 following

issue was framed for trial:-

1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover
interest @ 24% p.a. amounting to Rs.7,70,300/- or at
any other rate till the filing of the suit?
4.

Since the claim of interest did not arise out of any

contract and it is a legal issue, the arguments have been
heard on this issue as there was no need to deal with any oral
evidence.

5.

I have heard learned counsel for both the parties

and have carefully perused the record.
dated 9.12.2000

and

the

Agreement to sell

subsequent agreement dated

13.9.2001 do not stipulate any interest clause.

In case the

defendants failed to perform their part of the contract,
plaintiff was entitled to claim double the amount of earnest
money of Rs.3,21,000/- i.e. In all a sum of Rs.6,42,000/-.
While decreeing the suit the Court awarded pendente lite and

CS(OS) No.1292/2002

Page 3 of 5

future interest at the rate of 9% p.a.

6.

Though there is no stipulation for payment of interest

on double the amount of earnest money to meet the interest
of justice, in my view the plaintiff is entitled to claim interest
on the amount so claimed by him till the filing of the suit. I
am supported in my view by the following judgments.

7.

In (2000) 7 SCC 379 Surjit Kaur Vs. Naurata

Singh & Anr. where the agreement to sell contained the
following clause: “Due to any reason, if I don't get sale deed
executed then purchaser can get it done through court of law
or he can claim double the advance amount paid to me.” In
the said case the earnest money paid was Rs.20,000/-. The
plaintiff in the said case was entitled to a sum of Rs.40,000/being double the advance amount paid by him. While
granting the said amount of Rs.40,000/-, interest at the rate
of 12% p.a. was also awarded on the said amount of
Rs.40,000/- from the date when the sale deed was to be
executed till payment.

8.

In RFA No.584/2002, Harbans Lal Vs. Daulat Ram

under similar circumstances the Division Bench of this court
in its judgment dated 6th December, 2006 was pleased to

CS(OS) No.1292/2002

Page 4 of 5

award interest at the rate of 6% per annum with effect from
the date when the sale had is to be completed till the filing of
the suit besides interest pendente lite and future interest.

9.

Keeping in mind the rate of interest awarded to the

plaintiff during the pendency of the suit till realisation of the
decree, since there is no agreement to pay interest, I am of
the view that plaintiff is also entitled to interest at the rate of
9% p.a. on the earnest money of Rs.3,21,000/- from 9.12.2000
till the filing of the suit i.e. 9.8.2002.

This issue is

accordingly decided in favour of the plaintiff and against the
defendants.

Decree be prepared accordingly. File be

consigned.
