VIPIN SANGHI, J.
1.

By this order, I propose to consider whether any issues

arise that require to be framed for deciding the present suit in the light
of the statement of the defendant, Shri Sashi Mohan Garg recorded by
this Court on 4.8.2006.
2.

According to the plaintiff, in view of the statement made

CS(OS)No.1376/2002 & I.A. No. 1048/2004

Page 1 of 14

by the defendant on 4.8.2006 no issues arise which require to be
framed and that the suit could be decreed forthwith while its is the
submission of the defendant that various triable issues arise in the suit
which require to be framed to determine the real controversy in the
suit and unless such issues are framed and the matter set for trial, the
present suit cannot be disposed of.
3.

I heard detailed arguments addressed by both counsels on

the merits of the controversy. I may first state the factual background
of this case.
4.

The plaintiff has filed the present suit for recovery of an

amount of Rs.45,75,045/-. The basis of its claim is that the plaintiff
was in need of an imported Toyota Land Cruiser Jeep. Defendant no.2
namely Ms. Dhillon, wife of Mr. N.S.Dhillon approached the plaintiff for
sale of Toyota bearing registration DL-5-CB-3180, Vehicle Class- Motor
Vehicle (Imp.), Chasis No.HDJ 101-0013354, Engine No.1 HDF 7E, Type
of Body- Jeep, Horse Power 4200 CC, Diesel, Makers Name- Toyota,
Colour – P White. Defendant no.2 had represented to the plaintiff that
she was the registered owner of the said vehicle which had been duly
cleared by the customs authorities after payment of customs duty. It
is further stated that defendant no.2 offered to sell the said vehicle to
the plaintiff for an amount of Rs.40,40,000/-. However the deal did not
materialise since the plaintiff demanded that registration be effected
first in their name before they made payment. After about a week,

CS(OS)No.1376/2002 & I.A. No. 1048/2004

Page 2 of 14

defendant no.3, Mr. S.K. Mishra, proprietor of M/s. Miglani Motors
approached the plaintiff and offered to sell the same vehicle vide his
letter dated 17.10.2000 at a price of Rs.38 lakhs.
5.

It was represented by defendant no.3 that defendant no.1,

Mr. Sashi Mohan Garg was the registered owner of the said vehicle.
Defendant no.3 introduced defendant no.1 to the plaintiff to produce
the registration certificate bearing no.468925 in the name of
defendant no.2 as well as registration certificate bearing no.529616 in
the name of defendant no.1 issued by the registering authority under
the Motor Vehicles Act.

He also produced the import documents

including the customs clearance certificate bearing IMP. Dept. S.No. &
Date as 22.12.99- IMP-D-004124 which disclosed that customs duty to
the tune of Rs.10,44,430/- had been paid and the vehicle had been
released by the customs authorities.
6.

The plaintiff states that bona fide believing the documents

produced by defendants 1 and 3 and on the bona fide assumption that
the registration certificate and import documents are genuine, the
plaintiff agreed to produce the said vehicle for a sum of Rs.37,90,000/with the condition that the vehicle shall be transferred in their name
by defendant no.1 and thereafter payment of the vehicle would be
released in his favour. Accordingly the said vehicle was transferred in
the name of the plaintiff by defendant no.1 on 13.11.2000 and
documents to complete the sale were executed by defendant no.1 in

CS(OS)No.1376/2002 & I.A. No. 1048/2004

Page 3 of 14

the presence of defendant no.3. Defendant no.1 also indicated and
represented that the vehicle is free from all sorts of encumbrances.
The plaintiff paid the entire consideration for the vehicle to defendant
no.1 vide banker's cheque no.678918 dated 15.11.2000 for a sum of
Rs.37,90,000 drawn on ICICI Bank, New Delhi and the vehicle was
delivered to the plaintiff on the same date by defendant no.1.
7.

After a few months on 8.8.2001, the plaintiff was

approached by an Inspector of Maharashtra Police, Yellow Gate P.S.,
Mumbai who produced one FIR NO.19/2001 dated 2.5.2001 under
Section 461/380/2001/34 IPC registered by the Police Station Yellow
Gate, Mumbai on the complaint of the Superintendent of Customs, CIO
Department, Mumbai. As to the allegations in the said FIR, the vehicle
had been sold by defendant no.1 to the plaintiff in collusion with
defendant nos 2 and 3 and it was alleged to have been stolen from the
warehouse at Indira Dock, Mumbai. It was stated that it was removed
from the container without making any payment towards customs
duty.

It was further revealed that the documents of customs

clearance given by defendant no.1 to the plaintiff were forged and the
sale of those papers were also forged.

Mumbai police took the

custody of the said vehicle from the plaintiff on 8.8.2001 in regard to
the investigations into the offence as described in the said FIR. Upon
the plaintiff approaching Mumbai police and the customs authorities
for release of the said vehicle, the customs authorities offered to

CS(OS)No.1376/2002 & I.A. No. 1048/2004

Page 4 of 14

release the vehicle provisionally on payment of customs duty
amounting to Rs.22,62,954/- and penalty amounting to Rs.54,789/- by
furnishing bank guarantee as the vehicle was illegally imported and no
customs duty had been paid at the time of taking out the vehicle from
the customs warehouse.
8.

The plaintiff states that it is therefore evident that the

vehicle sold by defendant no.1 to the plaintiff was a stolen vehicle.
Plaintiff contends that defendant no.1 conspired with the other
defendants to cheat the plaintiff by selling his stolen vehicle by selling
the forged documents and the defendants were apparently aware of
the forgery. Despite having knowledge about the forged documents
they used the said documents for inducing the plaintiff to purchase the
vehicle and to part with the amount of Rs.39,90,000/-. In response to
the legal notice served by the plaintiffs upon the defendant, defendant
no.3 did not respond at all. While defendants 1 and 2 in their reply
admitted that the vehicle sold to the plaintiff was stolen from the
customs warehouse and the documents in relation to the customs duty
furnished by defendant no.1 to the plaintiff were forged documents,
plaintiff asserts that the defendant no.1 is responsible for the loss
caused to the plaintiff due to the sale of the stolen vehicle on the basis
of forged documents to the plaintiff.
9.

In para 13 of the plaint, the plaintiff has computed what it

claims as the financial loss suffered by it in the following manner:-

Rs. 40,000/Rs.45,75,045/-

Plaintiff claims that defendant no.1 is liable to pay the

aforesaid amounts to the plaintiff as it is defendant no.1 who has sold
the vehicle in question to the plaintiff and has taken the entire
consideration amount on the assurance that the vehicle is free from all
sorts of encumbrances and that defendant no.1 is the true and lawful
owner of the vehicle. The claim in the suit is made against defendant
no.1 while
defendants.

defendants 2 and 3 have been impleaded as proforma
The plaintiff has prayed for a decree for recovery of

Rs.45,75,045/- against defendant no.1 along with interest at the rate
of 18% pendente lite in future till its realisation.

Defendant no.1

raised preliminary objections on the ground that the plaintiff is not a
juristic person, that it has not been filed by a duly constituted attorney
and that Shri V.N.Taneja is not the constituted attorney of the plaintiff.
The Power of Attorney filed with the plaint on the basis of which the

CS(OS)No.1376/2002 & I.A. No. 1048/2004

Page 6 of 14

attorney has signed and instituted the suit has been questioned. In
the resolution of the Board of Directors dated 5.8.1998 in pursuance of
which the Power of Attorney was executed has also been questioned.
On merits the stand of defendant no.1 is that the plaintiff had satisfied
itself about the ownership and possession of the said vehicle with
defendant no.2. After being satisfied that Ms. Dhillon, defendant no.2
was the registered owner of the vehicle in question and had the
authority to sell the same, defendant No. 1 entered into a deal with
Ms. Dhillon for purchase of the said vehicle.
11.

It is also claimed that defendant no. 3 and her husband

represented, assured and confirmed to defendant no. 1 that the said
vehicle had been registered at New Delhi in the name of defendant no.
2 after full compliance of all import formalities and that a clear,
absolute, un-encumbered and lawful title would be given to defendant
no. 1. He states that he had no reason to doubt the representations
made by defendant no. 2 and her husband and defendant no. 3.
Defendant no. 1 acted on the representations and assurances given by
the said persons. Accordingly, he purchased the said vehicle for an
amount of Rs. 28 lacs paid by him vide bank draft in favour of
defendant no. 2. It is stated that defendant no. 2 and her husband
were residing in a posh locality, namely, Sainik Farm and enjoy a
reasonable reputation. There was no reason for the defendant no. 1 to
distrust the personality of the said persons.

Defendant no. 1

CS(OS)No.1376/2002 & I.A. No. 1048/2004

Page 7 of 14

purchased the said vehicle trusting upon the representations of
defendant no. 2, her husband and defendant no. 3. It is stated that
defendant no. 1 did not have any knowledge that the vehicle in
question was a stolen one.
12.

The statement of defendant no. 1 recorded by this Court

under Order 10 Rule 2 CPC on 4th August, 2006 reads as follows:“It is correct that I sold Car Toyota Land Cruiser
bearing registration No. DL5CB-3180 to the plaintiff/
MC Dowell and company Ltd. for a consideration of
Rs.37,90,000/- I have received the full amount from
the plaintiff. However, car was registered in their
name prior to receiving this consideration as per
their desire. I never knew that the car in question
was stolen car. After about a year in the month of
August, 2001, I was informed by the Manager of the
plaintiff company that there was some problem with
regard to the ownership of the car and the Bombay
police had arrived to take possession of the car
because of non-payment of custom duty.
It is
correct that I have already filed a suit for recovery
against Mrs. D. Dhillon, Mr. Dhillon and Mr. S. K.
Miglani from whom I had purchased this Car. ”
13.

Admittedly, defendant no. 1 received the entire sale

consideration of Rs.37,90,000/- from the plaintiff towards the sale of
the vehicle in question. It is the case of defendant no. 1 itself that he
did not know that the car in question was a stolen vehicle. Admittedly,
Defendant no.1 has knowledge of and does not deny the fact that
Bombay Police had arrived to take possession of the car because of
non-payment of customs duty. Admittedly, defendant no. 1 has in turn
filed a suit for recovery against defendant no. 2, her husband and
defendant no. 3.
CS(OS)No.1376/2002 & I.A. No. 1048/2004

14.

The suit field by defendant no. 1 and the present suit are

founded upon Sections 14 and 27 of The Sale of Goods Act which read
as follows:
“14. Implied undertaking as to title, etc. - In a
contract of sale unless the circumstances of the
contract are such as to show a different intention
there is (a) an implied condition on the part of the seller
that, in the case of a sale, he has a right to sell the
goods and that, in the case of an agreement to sell,
he will have a right to sell the goods at the time
when the property is to pass;
(b) an implied warranty that the buyer shall have
and enjoy quiet possession of the goods;
(c) an implied warranty that the gods shall be free
from any charge or encumbrance in favour of any
third party not declared or known to the buyer
before or at the time when the contract is made.”
“27. Subject to the provisions of this Act and any
other law for the time being in force, where goods
are sold by a person who is not the owner thereof
and who does not sell them under the authority or
with the consent of the owner, the buyer acquires no
better title to the goods than the seller had, unless
the owner of the goods is by his conduct precluded
from denying the seller's authority to sell....”
15.

Consequently, there is no merit in the submission of

defendant no. 1 that the plaintiff had satisfied itself of the ownership
of of the vehicle as that of defendant No. 1 as also the fact that the
vehicle had been duly imported and registered in the name of
defendant no. 2 prior to its purchase by defendant no. 1. The plea
based on the rule of caveat empter is also of no avail. To adjudicate

CS(OS)No.1376/2002 & I.A. No. 1048/2004

Page 9 of 14

the claim of the plaintiff for recovery of the sale consideration is
concerned, it is not relevant whether the defendant no. 1 himself was
a bonafide purchaser from defendant no. 2 or not, and whether or not
the defendants conspired with each other to sell a stolen vehicle to
the plaintiff. I may quote from Ramaiya's Goods Act, 4 th Edition, page
342:
“In Eichholz v. Bannister the plaintiff bought from
the defendant certain goods, but they were stolen
property, and the buyer was compelled to restore
them to the true owner. It was held that in the case
of goods sold in an open shop, or a warehouse, there
is an implied warranty on the part of the seller that
he is the owner of the goods, and if it turns out
otherwise, as where the goods are claimed by the
true owner, from whom they have been stolen, the
buyer may recover back the price as money paid
upon a consideration which has failed. Erle C.J. said
:
“..... If the vendor of a chattel by words or by
his conduct give the purchaser to understand
that he is the owner, then it forms part of the
contract, and if it turn out that in fact he is not
the owner, the consideration fails, and the
money so paid by the purchaser can be
recovered
back..............
where
at
the
sale................ the shopkeeper does by his
conduct affirm that he is the owner of the
article sold, and he therefore contracts that he
is such owner, and if he be not in fact the
owner, the price paid for the purchase can be
recovered back from him .......... in all ordinary
sales the party who undertakes to sell
exercises thereby the strongest act of
dominion over the chattel which he proposes
to sell, and would, therefore, I think, commonly
lead a purchaser to believe that he was the
owner of the chattel.”

CS(OS)No.1376/2002 & I.A. No. 1048/2004

Page 10 of 14

16.

On page 529 of the same book, in respect of section 27,

the learned Author comments:
“The section in the first place gives effect to
the general principle of law that no man can pass a
better title than he possesses nemo dat quod non
habet. In other words, a person buying goods from
another, who is not owner thereof, and who does
not sell them with the consent of the owner
acquires no better title to the goods than the seller
himself. This is indeed, as it should be, otherwise
the title of the true owner would stand imperiled on
account of the act of the impostor.”
17.

Reference may now be made to section 61 of the Sale of

Goods Act, which, in so far as it is relevant reads as follows:
“Nothing in this Act shall affect the right of the
seller or the buyer to recover interest or special
damages in any case where by law interest or
special damages may be recoverable, or to recover
the money paid where the consideration for the
payment of it has failed.”
18.

Consequently, subject to the preliminary issue with regard

to the competence and authorization of the attorney to file the present
suit being decided in favour of the plaintiff, it is clear that so far as the
claim for an amount of Rs. 37,90,000/- paid towards consideration of
amount of vehicle in question to the defendant is concerned, the same
appear to be totally justified.
19.

Counsel for the defendant no. 1 has relied on various

decisions to contend that a decree under Order 12 Rule 6 CPC cannot
be passed in a case like present where triable issues are raised and
there is no clear, unambiguous and unequivocal admission made by

CS(OS)No.1376/2002 & I.A. No. 1048/2004

Page 11 of 14

the defendant in the written statement.
20.

It is contended by the defendant no. 1 that various triable

issues arise.

From the preliminary objections of the defendants, it

appears that the defendant has even sought to question the
incorporation of the plaintiff as a limited company under Companies
Act, 1956. Apart from this, objections have been raised with regard to
the constitution of a valid attorney in favour of the signatory of the
plaintiff, Mr. V. N. Taneja. So far as the challenge to the incorporation
of the plaintiff company is concerned, in my view, the same is not
permissible in view of the fact that defendant no. 1 had itself dealt
with the plaintiff which constitutes recognition by defendant no. 1 of
the existence of defendant no. 1 as a juristic entity. Defendant no. 1 is
therefore estopped from now challenging the very incorporation of the
plaintiff. So far as the other objections raised by the defendant no. 1
are concerned, in my view, the following preliminary issue arises and
is accordingly framed.

However, it is made clear that in case the

plaintiff succeeds in proving the following preliminary issue, the costs
thereof, shall be to the account of defendant no. 1;
1.
21.

Whether the suit has been signed, verified and
instituted by a duly authorized person ? OPP

Apart from the aforesaid, the following other issues arise

and are framed;
2.

Whether the plaintiff is entitled to claim the following
amounts from defendant no. 1 ?

22.

Whether the plaintiff is entitled to interest ? If so at
what amount and at what rate?
Relief.

Let the plaintiff file its list of witnesses in relation to issue

no. 1 in ten days and file its affidavits by way of evidence towards
examination in chief in relation to issue no. 1 within 3 weeks.

In case

the plaintiff wishes to summon any witnesses, the plaintiff should take
steps for the same within 3 weeks.
23.

List the matter before the Court for examination of

plaintiff's witnesses in relation to issue no. 1 on 26.11.2007.
I.A. No. 1048/2004
24.

The above I.A. has been filed by the defendant seeking

liberty to file additional written statement to the replication filed by
the plaintiff. The grievance of the defendant is that the plaintiff has set
up an entirely new case in his replication and if the same remained

CS(OS)No.1376/2002 & I.A. No. 1048/2004

Page 13 of 14

unrebutted, grave injury/irreparable loss would result.
25.

The above contention of the defendant in my view is sans

any merit inasmuch as a replication is not a part of the pleadings. If an
entirely new case is being set up in the replication, the same cannot
be treated as a plaint. The only way to incorporate an additional or
alternate plea is by way of an amendment to the plaint and not by way
of replication. It is for the court to see at the final stage whether a
completely new case has been set up in the replication, if so, to ignore
the same.
26.

The application is dismissed.
