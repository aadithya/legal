PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
Petitioners are the plaintiffs in a suit for declaration

and perpetual injunction. They are aggrieved by the order dated
17.2.2000 passed by the learned Civil Judge allowing an
application of Raghubans Singh and Balbir Singh under Order 1
Rule 10. They have been impleaded as defendants.
2.

Suit of the plaintiffs i.e. the petitioners seeking

declaration and perpetual injunction is based on the claim that
they are owners of the suit

property

by

adverse

possession.

They claimed that defendants 3 to 5 are their tenants.

They

claimed that defendants 1 & 2 entered into some conspiracy with
page 1 of 3

defendants 3 to 5. They claimed that because of the conspiracy
their title by adverse possession came under cloud.
3.

In the written statement filed by defendants 1 & 2 it

was pleaded that defendant No. 1 is the owner of the suit
property by virtue of his being a recorded non occupancy tenant
to the extent of 1/3rd share.
4.

Raghubans Singh and Balbir Singh stated in their

application under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC that they are the real
brothers of defendant No. 1 and are the co-owners of the suit
property along with defendant No.1.
5.

Learned Trial Judge has therefore opined that since the

issue of title by adverse possession against the recorded owners
was a subject matter of the suit and that defendant No.1 was the
recorded co-owner with 2/3rd share in the suit property and since
the applicants were claiming to be the co-owners to the extent of
the remaining 1/3rd share in the suit property they would be
affected by a decision in the suit and hence were a necessary
party.
6.

I concur.

7.

Suffice would it be to state that

the

issue

of

title

arose for consideration in the suit. Petitioners impleaded only one
of the recorded co-owner having 1/3rd undivided share in the suit
land as per the revenue record. Thus, the persons who claimed to
page 2 of 3

be the owners of the remaining 2/3rd undivided share along with
defendant No.1 were a necessary party.
8.

Neither has the nature of the suit changed by the fact

of impleadment nor has the controversy been widened.
9.

There is no merits in the petition.

10.

Dismissed.
