1.

The petitioners were engaged on casual basis through

Employment

Exchange.

The

respondents

sent

another

requisition to the Employment Exchange with the intention to
replace the petitioners with other casual workers.
2.

Grievance of the petitioners was that they should not

be replaced by other casual workers as they had preferential
right to continue as casual workers till the time regular
appointments are made and there is need for engaging the
workers by the respondent on casual basis. The OA filed by the
petitioners was disposed of on 3rd April, 2007 with the following
directions:

3.

“It is clear from the above that applicants
were appointed as casual labourers for short
period and were issued I-Cards to facilitate
their entry into the government Buildings. It
is also true that they have not exhausted
the departmental remedy available to them.
In the facts of circumstances of the present
case, the applicants may represent to the
respondents setting out their claim. The
respondents may consider their claim in
preference to freshers an outsiders, in
accordance with law.”
The
petitioners
understood
these
abovesaid

observations

of

the

Tribunal

to

mean

that

on

making
WP(C) No. 6042/2007

representations,

the

Page 2 of 4

respondents

were

directed

to

give

preference to them over freshers and outsiders. According to the
petitioners since respondents engaged some other persons,
namely, freshers and outsiders, they filed Contempt Petition.
This Contempt Petition was dismissed as withdrawn observing
that petitioners had not made representations which they were
directed to make, and which was to be considered by the
respondents in a time-bound manner.
4.

Petitioners,

dated 8.6.2007.

thereafter,

made

the

representation

Learned counsel for petitioners submits that

this representation was ignored and juniors/freshers engaged.
5.

In these circumstances, Miscellaneous Application

was filed by the petitioner for clarification of order dated
3.4.2007 which has been dismissed by the Tribunal on 8.6.2007
holding that no clarification is required.

Another Contempt

Petition filed by the petitioner has also been dismissed on
25.7.2007 on the ground that there were no specific directions to
the respondents.

6.

Since the petitioners have now made representation

on 8.6.2007, which is submitted pursuant to order dated
3.4.2007
WP(C) No. 6042/2007

and the said order is interpreted to mean that respondent shall
consider the claim of the petitioners, i.e. to engage them in
preference to freshers and outsiders in accordance with law, and
as according to the petitioners, the respondents are not
considering this claim, this furnishes fresh cause of action to the
petitioners.
7.

In these circumstances, it would be open to the

petitioners to approach the Tribunal again with the aforesaid
grievance.

On moving such an application, the same shall be

decided by the Tribunal on merits.
8.

With these observations, this petition is disposed of.
