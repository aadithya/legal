Prosecution case traces its origin to a report
registered

on an information by one Jai Prakash

Pandey as DD No.40 dated 21st September, 1997 at
PP Inderlok, PS Sarai Rohilla, Delhi.

Jai Prakash

Pandey worked as a night watchman on the relevant
date. In the course of his duty, at about 2.30 am, on
the intervening night of 20th and 21st of September,
2007, he heard some groaning sound emanating
from the first floor of House No.313/40 Inderlok,
Delhi whereupon he rushed to PP Inderlok to inform
the police about the same.

After recording the

information given by Jai Prakash Pandey, the duty
officer passed on a copy of DD No.40/1997 dated 21 st
September, 1997 to Head Constable Azad Singh for
necessary

action.

on the person of Sanjiv Kumar @ Sunni, aged about
15/16 years, who happened to be the son of his elder
brother Madan Lal PW-6. They also noticed body of
an aged person with extensive injuries, lying in a pool
of blood. He was Ram Das, deceased, father of the

went

On reaching the hospital, Inspector

T.R. Mongia came to know that Ram Das was
declared brought dead and Sanjiv @ Sunni was unfit
to make his statement. Since he did not come across
with any eye witness of the incident, Inspector T.R.
Mongia returned to the spot.

He recorded the

statement of Head Constable Azad Singh and sent
the same through Constable Dharmender

to Police

Station Sarai Rohilla, Delhi for registration of a FIR.
Constable Dharmender, after sometime, came back to
the spot with

a copy of FIR and the

handed over the same to Inspector T.R. Mongia. The
khanjar which was snatched from the appellant was
produced by Head Constable Azad Singh before
Inspector T.R. Mongia who after preparing the sketch
thereof, packed and sealed it and took the same in
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 4 of 34

his possession. The appellant was formally arrested
and subjected to interrogation at the spot. On his
disclosure, the appellant got a blood stained piece of
iron rod, used as a weapon of offence, in addition to
khanjar, recovered.

That saria was also taken into

possession by Inspector T.R. Mongia. Photographs of
the scene of crime were taken by the crime team. The
Investigating Officer seized blood stained T-Shirt and
a pair of trousers, which the appellant was wearing
at the time of commission of crime.

He also

completed other formalities at the spot as detailed in
the impugned judgment.
3.

The appellant was charged under Section 302
IPC for committing murder of Ram Das and Sanjiv @
Sunni as also under Section 27 of Arms Act. On his
pleading not guilty to the charges, he was put to trial.

4.

Besides

documentary evidence, prosecution

evidence comprises oral testimony of 21 witnesses in
all. Out of the witnesses so examined, the statements
of Head Constable Azad Singh (PW-7) and Constable
Dharmender (PW-8) stand out inasmuch as they are
the ones who are stated to have had witnessed the
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

the person of Sanjiv @ Sunni and had apprehended
him with blood stained khanjar in his hand.

are

and

corroborative nature. Learned Trial Court based its
finding of conviction against the appellant primarily
on the oral testimony of Head Constable Azad Singh
(PW-7) and Constable Dharmender (PW-8).

Not

related to the account of incident as it took place, the
deposition of Madan Lal, PW-6, elder

brother of

appellant, assumes relevance to prove motive on the
part of the appellant in committing the murder of his
father and nephew. He is also stated to have
witnessed recovery/seizure at the spot of weapons of
offence and appellant's blood stained clothes etc.

the oral testimony of three witnesses examined by
him in his defence who spoke of an oral family

at the residence of Jagdish Arora DW-2 where his

being peeved at denial of any share in the properties
owned by his father, Ram Das deceased. The learned
Trial Court of course, for the reasons recorded in its
judgment, did not accept the defence plea of any such
oral family settlement, as deposed by

the three

defence witnesses, having actually been arrived at
before 15 days of commission of murder of Ram Das.
6.

The

appellant

on

his

examination

under

Section 313 Cr.P.C. denied his presence at the spot
and stated that he was falsely implicated in the case
at the instance of his brother Madan Lal PW-6 when
he went to the police station Sarai Rohilla in the
morning.

He denied that the blood stained T-shirt

and a pair of trousers belonged to him.

He stated

that no blood stained khanjar was ever seized from
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 7 of 34

him nor he made any disclosure statement leading to
the recovery of iron rod. According to him property
disputes with his father

were compromised in the

presence of Surinder Kumar DW-1, Jagdish Arora
DW-2, Madan Lal PW-6 and his son Praveen Kumar.
7.

Assailing the impugned conviction,
counsel for the appellant

learned

contended that the

statements of Head Constable Azad Singh-PW 7 and
Constable Dharmender-PW 8 being riddled with
contradictions,

ocular

account

of

the

incident

presented by them in the course of their statements
including the factum of appellant being apprehended
red handed at the scene of crime with blood smeared
khanjar in his hand could not have been safely acted
upon to hold

the appellant guilty of the charge of

murder. The learned counsel argued that inspite of
alleged presence of Jai Prakash Pandey(PW-1), who
was instrumental in setting the police officials in
motion, at the time when Head Constable Azad singh
PW-7 and Constable Dharmender PW-8 visited the
scene of crime, the Investigating Officer preferred to
get the FIR registered on the
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

statement of a police
Page 8 of 34

official, namely, Head Constable Azad Singh, PW-7
thereby adversely

impacting at the authenticity

thereof. Further, referring to a part of statement of
Jai Prakash Pandey (PW-1) in his cross examination
that he had noticed a person fleeing the place of
occurrence and disappearing in darkness, the learned
counsel contended that it is not beyond the realm of
possibility

that instead of the appellant it was that

person who would have fatally assaulted both the
deceased. It was further argued that the appellant
had no motive to kill Sanjiv @ Sunni as he is not
shown to have had any personal grudge of any sort
against him.

Acceptability of the dying declaration

allegedly made by Sanjiv @ Sunny was assailed on
the

plea

that

when

Inspector

T.R.

Mongia,

Investigating Officer visited the hospital, Sanjiv @
Sunni was declared by the doctor concerned as unfit
to make a statement and in such a situation it was
highly improbable that the deceased boy would have
made any dying declaration against the appellant as
deposed by Head Constable Bal Kishan (PW-11).

deceased had passed on to Madan Lal PW-6, father of
Sanjiv @ Sunni, and his two other sons, the appellant

proceeded to kill his son Sanjiv @ Sunni. Regarding
contradictions in the statements of Head Constable
Azad Singh, PW-7 and Constable Dharmender, PW-8
it was argued

that the same being not of a nature

which could be said to shake the basic version of the
prosecution case, their entire statements would not
stand discredited.

It was submitted that the same

very arguments as in appeal were raised before the
learned Trial Court also and the learned Trial Judge
having overruled such contentions for valid reasons
recorded in the impugned judgment, no fault can be
found with the impugned conviction and sentence
warranting any interference therewith in appeal.
9.

The fact that the appellant had property
disputes with his father, Ram Das, deceased, is
evident from the appellant's own statement under
Section 313 Cr.P.C.

However, according to him

disputes stood amicably settled and thus no disputes
survived on the day of occurrence. Madan Lal, PW-6,
who was, in terms of the statement of the appellant
and his defence witnesses party to such family
settlement, though, denied appellant's claim in this

10.

A public notice in Punjab Kesari newspaper

dated 10th July, 1993 vide Ex. PW-20/A was issued
on behalf of Ram Das, deceased through his counsel
Sh. S.P. Minocha, Advocate notifying to the general
public that he had divested his sons namely Yoginder
Kumar (appellant), Rajender Kumar and Surender
Kumar of their right to inherit his properties and
business and that he had severed all his connections
with his said sons. In terms of testimony of Madan
Lal PW-6, the appellant had filed some cases in the
court in respect of properties owned by Ram Das,
deceased and one of such civil suits was decided in
favour of Ram Das, deceased. A suit for permanent
injunction vide Ex. PW-18/A in respect of a portion of
property No.312/48 plot No.6B Inderlok, Delhi filed
by the appellant against his deceased father as also
against Madan Lal, PW-6 and his two sons was still
pending and it was being contested by appellant's
deceased father as well as Madan Lal PW-6 and his
sons vide their written statement Ex. PW 18/C.

The

appellant

Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

examined

his

brother

Page 12 of 34

Sh.

Surinder Kumar, DW-1, Sh. Jagdish Arora, DW-2 and
Sh. Ram Pal, DW-3, both relatives, to prove that all
property disputes stood settled and no dispute of any
sort in that respect survived on the date of incident.
On a close scrutiny of statements of these witnesses it
would however, appear that they are simply procured
ones. Like appellant, Surender Kumar DW-1 had also
been disinherited from his properties and business by
Ram Das, deceased. He was thus equally aggrieved
as the appellant. Surender Kumar, DW-1 states that
he rushed to Inderlok on a two wheeler scooter on
being informed on phone at about 7.30/7.40 a.m. by
the appellant that a quarrel had taken place and that
he should reach Inderlok immediately.

Noticeably

Ram Das, deceased and Sanjiv Kumar @ Sunni had
been

badly injured and removed to Hindu Rao

Hospital by 3.25/3.30 a.m. on 21st September, 1997
and Ram Das was declared brought dead

on being

taken to the hospital at 3.30 a.m. while Sanjiv Kumar
@ Sunni died at about 4.55 a.m. By 7.30/7.45 a.m.
thus

everybody including the appellant would have

known that Ram Das and Sanjiv Kumar @ Sunni had
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 13 of 34

succumbed to their injuries.

In that event it would

sound strange that instead of informing

Surinder

Kumar, DW-1 about the death of Ram Das and
Snajeev Kumar @ Sunni, the appellant would have
simply asked him to come to Inderlok stating that a
quarrel had taken place.

Surender Kumar, DW-1

further states that on reaching Inderlok he came to
know that his father and Sanjiv Kumar @ Sunni had
been taken to Hindu Rao Hospital.

He thereupon

claims to have reached Hindu Rao Hospital where,
according to him, his father and nephew Sanjiv @
Sunni were taken to emergency ward. When both the
injured had died much before, there was really no
question of their being taken to emergency ward when
Surinder Kumar, DW-1 claims to have had reached
the hospital sometime after 7.30 a.m. or 7.45 a.m.
Surprisingly even though this witness claims to have
stayed in the hospital for about 1/1.5 hours before
leaving for PS Sarai Rohilla, he does not

speak of

having come to know about the death of the injured
persons.

Surely, his statement as aforesaid, is just

unacceptable.
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

12.

Surinder Kumar DW-1, goes on to testify that

an oral family settlement was effected during the
course of

a meeting

with all concerned including

Ram Das, deceased and Madan Lal, PW-6 about 15
days prior to the date of occurrence.

All the three

defence witnesses affirm in unison that such a family
settlement was reached at the house of Jagdish Arora,
DW-2.

Jagdish Arora, DW-2 himself was, however,

unsure of timing of such settlement. He in the first
instance stated that it was about 7 years ago that
Ram Das, deceased had requested him to get the
property disputes among his family members settled.
As the witness astrayed, the learned defence counsel
had to seek permission to cross examine him with
respect

to the point of time when

the family

settlement was arrived at and it was only on a leading
question being put that he stated that the settlement
was reached only 10/15 days before the
occurrence.

date of

Fumbling on the part of this witness

regarding time of reaching such a settlement clearly
makes his statement unsafe to act upon.
13.

Ram Pal, DW-3, brother in law (Sadhu) of the

Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 15 of 34

appellant, deposed that on 21st September, 1997 at
about 7/7.30 a.m. he was

informed by Surinder

Kumar, DW-1 that a quarrel had taken place between
Ram Das and some person and that

he (Surinder

Kumar) was going to Hindu Rao Hospital. According
to the witness he was asked by Surinder Kumar, DW1 to reach the hospital with Madan Lal, PW-6.

prosecution witness deposed that he had reached
Inderlok soon after being informed of the incident at
6.00 a.m.

It is difficult to believe that where the

incident took place around 2.40 a.m. or so and both
the injured had died, Surinder Kuamar DW-1 and
other relatives including Jagdish Arora, DW-2 and
Ram Pal, DW-3 continued to be unaware of their
death until 7/7.30 a.m. While two of the defence
witnesses deposed that in the settlement second floor
of the house at Inderlok and a guest house were
agreed to fall to the share of the appellant, according
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 16 of 34

to Ram Pal, DW-3 it was first floor of the house at
Inderlok and the guest house which were decided to
go to the share of the appellant. It is noteworthy here
that the appellant in his statement under Section 313
Cr.P.C. does not name Ram Pal DW-3 being one of
those who were present at the time of so called
compromise. Thus, the statement of none of the three
defence witnesses, in the light of above, would appear
to be worthy of credence. It cannot be lost sight of
that the suit for permanent injunction against Ram
Das, deceased and others, filed by the appellant,
remained

pending

until

he was murdered, which

leads to infer that the relationship between the
appellant and his deceased father as well as Madan
Lal PW-6 and his sons continued to be as strained as
ever before.

Keeping in view the history of strained

relationship between the parties, had there been any
family settlement, as pleaded on behalf of the
appellant,

in normal course the same would have

either been reduced into writing or a joint application
would have been made before the court in the
pending suit reporting thereby such a settlement to
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 17 of 34

seek disposal thereof. Absence of any such course
being adopted, uninspiring statements of defence
witnesses are not good enough to constitute a basis
to find that property disputes between the appellant
and his deceased father had come to an end in view
of any oral settlement as pleaded. The learned Trial
Court was thus justified in discarding the testimony
of defence witnesses, though

and holding

against existence of any family settlement prior to the
date of occurrence. In the face of clear documentary
as well as oral evidence in the nature of statement of
Madan Lal PW-6, the appellant, being denied any
share

in the properties and business owned by his

deceased father

had a strong motive to act in

reprisal.
14.

Adverting to the merits of the case,

though

the statements of Head Constable Azad Singh, PW-7
and Constable Dharmender, PW-8 are not free from
vice of contradictions on certain aspects, the same do
not lose their

over all credibility content, given the

nature of discripancies. Both the witnesses state that
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 18 of 34

when they went upstairs to the first floor of the
building they noticed the appellant inflicting stab
injuries on the person of Sanjiv @ Sunni. Body of an
aged person was found lying in a pool of blood in the
same very room where the boy was being assaulted.
The exact place in the room where body of such aged
person was lying

is however, testified differently by

Head Constable Azad Singh, PW-7 and Constable
Dharmender, PW-8.

While Constable Dharmender,

PW-8 states that the body of Ram Das was lying on
the floor, Head Constable Azad Singh, PW-7 stated
that it was partly positioned on the double bed and
part thereof was in hanging

state.

Both these

witnesses also contradict each other in regard to the
manner in which both the

deceased were removed

from the room to the two PCR vans to take them to
Hindu Rao Hospital.

Head Constable Azad Singh,

PW-7 stated that he or Constable Dharmender, PW8 did not go down stairs when both the injured were
removed to the PCR vans. On the contrary Constable
Dharmender, PW-8 affirmed that he, as also Head
Constable Azad Singh, PW-7 helped the PCR staff in
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 19 of 34

removing respective injured to the PCR vans. It is to
be kept in mind that there was a gap of more than
three years from the date of incident when Constable
Dharmender, PW-8 appeared to depose in the case.
Similarly,

memory causes minute details of a past event turn

even for genuine

eye witnesses of an incident to respond in describing
the same with compatible accuracy. Thus conflicting
statements of aforesaid two witnesses, as pointed out
by learned defence counsel, cannot be held to mean
that they were actually not present at the scene of
crime at the given point of time. Noticeably both the
witnesses corroborate each others' statement in all
material

respects.

15.

The appellant strived hard to take advantage

of a part of statement

of Jai Narain Pandey, PW-1

where he in the course of cross examination affirmed
that at the time he heard groaning sound from the
first floor of the house, he had noticed a person
running away

from

there.

From this, learned

defence counsel sought to develop an argument that
instead of the appellant it was rather that unknown
person

who was

responsible

for causing

fatal

injuries on the person of both the deceased. While
raising such an argument learned defence counsel
perhaps

lost sight of deposition of Head Constable

Azad Singh, PW-7 and Constable Dharmender, PW-8,
who affirmed that when they reached the spot they
noticed the appellant still in the process of causing
stab injuries on the person of deceased boy. Thus,
even if another assailant had been present
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

at the

Page 21 of 34

spot prior to the said police officials reaching there,
it would

in no way affect the culpability of the

appellant.
16.

Another argument raised by learned defence

counsel was that in view of the fact that Jai Prakash

the police

officials had reached the spot, was also present

the

authenticity

of

the

FIR

In this context, while referring to the

statement of Head Constable Azad Singh, PW-7 it is
gathered that according to him on reaching the house
in question he had left behind Jai Prakash Pandey,
PW-1 in the lane/at the stairs. Jai Prakash Pandey,
PW-1 however, in his cross examination told that he
had also gone upstairs where he saw blood splattered
over and the appellant standing at a distance of about
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 22 of 34

10 steps from the place where the blood was lying.
This part of statement of Jai Prakash Pandey, PW-1
however, does not clearly indicate that he had gone
upstairs simultaneously with the two police officials.
Even after being left behind

as deposed

by Head

Constable Azad Singh PW-7, Jai Prakash Pandey, PW1 could have gone upstairs at some later point of time
after the appellant had already been overpowered by
the said police witnesses and made to stand there in
the room after being disarmed.

Even though Jai

Prakash Pandey, PW-1 does not corroborate the
statements of Head Constable Azad Singh, PW-7 and
Constable Dharmender, PW-8 in regard

to the

appellant being caught red handed while in the
process of assaulting Sanjiv @ Sunni, he in any case ,
supports their statements as far as presence of the
appellant

at

the

scene

of

crime

is

concerned.

Obviously, as Jai Prakash Pandey, PW-1 does not
state as having witnessed the appellant causing stab
injuries on the person of Sanjiv @ Sunni, he could not
be taken to have had seen the occurrence actually
taking place.

Head Constable Azad Singh, PW-7 on

Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 23 of 34

the other hand having witnessed the crime being
committed by the appellant was the one who was an
eye witness to the incident and thus in getting the
FIR registered on his statement, there was

nothing

wrong in it which could cause doubt in regard to the
correctness of the FIR.
17.

From the statement of Madan Lal, PW-6 it is

gathered that Ram Das deceased while depriving the
appellant of his share in the properties and business
owned by him gave some property to him and some
properties to his other two sons by way of a Will. The
appellant thus had every reason to turn inimical to
Madan Lal, PW-6 and his family members.
18.

Hostility on the part of appellant towards

Madan Lal, PW-6 and his family members apart,
being a witness to a savagely homicidal

(Ram

Das),

assault on

possibility

of the

deceased boy offering resistance in order to save him
and in the process becoming a victim of appellant's
fury can also be not ruled out. Extreme hostility and
deep hatred towards both the deceased is

in clear

evidence in the face of nature and number of injuries
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 24 of 34

found on the body of the deceased. Ram Das, the old
man,

suffered as many as 37 lacerated and stab

wounds, apart from 9 abrasions and the boy, in his
teens, 18 stab injuries, excluding

four abrasions.

Both were thus fatally attacked with enormous
vengeance which

could not be without a strong

motive accompanying the treacherous act.

In any

case intention to kill the old man and the boy is very
much

evident

and

in

the

given

situation,

the

appellant's plea of lack of motive to commit the
murder of the boy cannot secure an escape route for
him.

doing so though the learned trial judge negatived the
defence plea that given the precarious condition

of

the deceased boy on account of extensive injuries on
his person and the fact that he was declared unfit for
statement at 4.00 a.m. by the doctor concerned,

it

was highly improbable that he would have made any
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 25 of 34

such statement as deposed by Head Constable Bal
Kishan, PW-11, we find the plea could not be brushed
aside as totally devoid of substance.

According to

Dharmveer Singh, PW-16 when he reached the scene
of crime the deceased boy was alive. He was trying to
say something but was unable to speak. At the time
of his admission in the hospital at 3.25 a.m.

vide

MLC Ex. PW-13/A though the doctor concerned found
him conscious, there is no mention that he was well
oriented.

His pulse beat was quite fast and blood

pressure alarmingly low.

Keeping in mind his

condition at the spot and later at the time of his
admission in the hospital, it appears quite doubtful if
there would have been

any improvement in his

condition on way to the hospital as surmised by the
learned Trial Judge. The dying declaration has thus
to be left apart in adjudging the culpability

of the

appellant.

Serological

reports from forensic science

laboratory vide Ex. PW 21/L, PW 20/L reveal that the
blood stained dagger Ex. P 2 seized from the appellant
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

Page 26 of 34

and blood stained iron rod Ex. P-1 recovered at his
instance

were found to bear human blood of AB

group. Banian and underwear of respective deceased
were also detected to bear human blood of AB group.
Same group of human blood was detected on the Tshirt,

Ex. P-3 and trousers, Ex. P-4 which the

appellant was stated to have had been wearing while
committing the crime. The daggar Ex. P-2 was shown
to Doctor C.B. Dabas PW-12 and he opined vide his
report Ex. P-12/G that incised wounds found on
the

dead bodies of

both the deceased could have

been caused by a sharp edged weapon like Ex. P-1.
Thus ocular account of incident as testified by Head
Constable

Azad

Singh,

PW-7

and

Constable

Dharmender, PW-8 find sufficient corroboration from
the reports Ex. PW 20/M, PW-21/L and PW-12/G to
connect the appellant with the commission of crimes
in question, beyond reasonable doubt.

In the

circumstances, even if the dying declaration of Sanjiv
@ Sunni as deposed by Head Constable Bal Kishan,
PW-11 is left

out of

consideration,

sufficient

evidence would still be available to sustain the finding
Crl. Appeal No.498/2004

of guilty against

the appellant recorded by the

learned Trial Court.

21.

In ultimate view,

we find no merit, hence

dismiss the appeal.
