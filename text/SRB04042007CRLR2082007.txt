MR. JUSTICE S. RAVINDRA BHAT (Open Court)

1. In all these cases identical orders made by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate on
30.3.2007 dismissing the complaints preferred, have been impugned. The petitions
involve identical questions of fact and law. Since the complaints were dismissed
CRL.REV.P.208/2007

5 of 10

without further proceeding, on the first date of hearing, by the trial court, these
revision petitions are being disposed off finally at the admission stage.
2. The impugned order reads as follows :
“Heard : The perusal of the averments made in
the complaint of the complainant is beyond statutory
period and the same has already been observed by Ld.
ACCM. More over no application for condonation of
delay has been filed. Therefore, the case is hereby
dismissed.
File be consigned to record room.”
3. The complaints in all the proceedings filed by the common petitioner-Bank were
identically phrased; they alleged commission of offences under Section 138/141 of
Negotiable Instruments Act. It was alleged that the cheques in question were
dishonoured upon presentation; as a consequence legal notices under Section 138(b) of
the Act were issued on 15.12.2006. Since the notices went unheeded and according to
the complainant the accused did not comply with their terms and pay the amounts, the
complaints were filed.
4. Learned counsel contended that the Magistrate fell into error in concluding that the
complaints were filed beyond the statutory period.
Magistrate was

It was submitted that the

unduly influenced by the observations of the Additional Chief

Metropolitan Magistrate, who appears to have made a noting to such an effect while
marking the cases to the trial court.
5. Counsel submitted that the notices in that sense were issued on 15.12.2006 and in
terms of Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (hereafter “the 1897 Act”)
service would be deemed to be completed in the ordinary course at least one week
CRL.REV.P.208/2007

6 of 10

after their issuance. Counsel contended that neither the undelivered letters nor A.D.
cards were received by the complainants.
6. Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in
M/s. Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd. Vs. M/s Galazy Traders & Agencies Ltd. & Ors.,
2001 DCR 198. It was contended that the court had taken note of Section 27 of the
1897 Act and observed that the sender of notice enjoys benefit of a presumption.
Counsel contended that in these circumstances the filing of the complaints on the 48th
day after the issuance of the legal notice could not be construed as beyond the time
prescribed as it would lead to an obvious anomaly, i.e. time being reckoned from the
date of the notice.
7. Section 138, to the extent it is material is extracted below :
“138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of
funds in the account – Where any cheque drawn by a
person on an account maintained by him with a banker
for payment of any amount of money to another person
from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in
part, of any debt or other liability, is returned by the
bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money
standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to
honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount
arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement
made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to
have committed an offence and shall, without prejudice
to any other provision of this Act, be punished with
imprisonment for [a term which may be extended to two
years], or with fine which may extend to twice the
amount of the cheque, or with both:
Provided that nothing contained in this section shall
apply unless(a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a
period of six months from the date on which it is drawn
or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier;
CRL.REV.P.208/2007

7 of 10

(b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque,
as the case may be, makes a demand for the payment of
the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing,
to the drawer of the cheque, [within thirty days] of the
receipt of information by him from the bank regarding
the return of the cheque as unpaid.”
8. The pre-conditions for filing a valid complaint which can be entertained

are as

follows :
1) Receipt by the payee about dishonour of the instrument from the drawer's banker;
2) Issuance of legal notice within 30 days of receipt of such information;
3) Filing of a complaint within 15 days of receipt of the notice, by the drawer.
9. The object behind enacting these pre-conditions was to ensure that drawers of the
instrument are afforded opportunity to make good the payment, after being called upon
to do so. At the same time however Parliamentary intention was clear; once notice is
issued in a given case, the payee has to necessarily, in order to avail of the summary
procedure, approach the court within the stipulated period.
10.The notices here were despatched on 15.12.2006. The trial court appears to have
proceeded on a footing that the 45 days period i.e. the 30 days for the legal notice and
further period of 15 days for the filing of the complaint, commenced from the date of
the issuance of the legal notice. This in my opinion was not only fallacy, but a
palpable error. In this context it will be useful to extract the observations of the
Supreme Court in K.Bhaskaran Vs. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan and Another, (1999) 7
SCC 510.
“If a strict interpretation is given that the drawer
CRL.REV.P.208/2007

8 of 10

should have actually received the notice for the period
of 15 days to start running no matter that the payee sent
the notice on the correct address, a trickster cheque
drawer would get the premium to avoid receiving the
notice by different strategies and he could escape from
the legal consequences of Section 138 of the Act. It
must be borne in mind that the court should not adopt
as interpretation which helps a dishonest evader and
clips an honest payee as that would defeat the very
legislative measure.”

11.Section 27 which was noticed by the Supreme Court reads as follows :
“27. Meaning of service by post :Where any Central Act
or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act
authorises or requires any document to be served by
post, whether the expression `serve' or either of the
expression `give' or `send' or any other expression is
used, then, unless a different intention appears, the
service shall be deemed to be effected by properly
addressing, prepaying and posting by registered post, a
letter containing the document, and unless the contrary
is proved, to have been effected at the time at which the
letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.”
12. In these cases the trial court has given no allowance for service of the notice and
the time which would ordinarily have been taken, for the purpose. The key expression
in Section 27, which was held applicable by the Supreme Court (in cases arising out of
complaints alleging commission of offences under Section 138 of the Act) are that the
notice would be deemed to have been effected at the time when the letter would be
delivered in the “ordinary course of post”. This aspect has escaped the attention of the
court which reckoned time from the date when the legal notice was issued giving no

CRL.REV.P.208/2007

9 of 10

allowance for the presumption to operate. I am of the opinion that the benefit of at
least a week is admissible in this regard. So reckoned; the limitation in this case
would have expired on 5.2.2007 and the bar under Section 142 would have operated
thereafter. However, the complaints were filed within that time, on 2.2.2007, and
therefore could not have been rejected on that ground.
13. For the above reasons, the impugned orders cannot be sustained. They are hereby
set aside.

The matter is remitted to the trial court for further proceedings in

accordance with law. The petitioner shall appear before the trial court for further
proceedings/directions on 24.4.2007. Order dasti.
