Allowed subject to just exceptions.
Crl. REV. P. 377/2007
1.

The petitioner placed an offer on the respondent vide its
letter dated 23.3.2005 for supply of Back Pressure Turbo
Generating Sets.

There is stated to be a subsequent

amendment dated 17.5.2005 whereby it was agreed that
the erection and commissioning of the equipment was to be
Crl.Rev.P.377/07 & Crl.M.A.6248-49/07

completed latest by first week of November, 2005. The
petitioner had given two post-dated cheques to the
respondent in May, 2005; dated 8.11.2005 for Rs.5,75,000/and dated 26.12.2005 for Rs.11,50,000/-.

There are

disputes which have arisen in respect of implementation of
the purchase order. It is not necessary to go into that issue.
Suffice to say that the petitioner did not want the
respondent

to

present

the

cheques.

However,

the

respondent presented the cheque for Rs.11,50,000/-, which
was not honored in view of the stop payment instructions of
the petitioner.
2.

The respondent sent a letter dated 1.3.2006 to the
petitioner in the following terms:
“We regret to inform you that your cheque
No.000510 dtd. 26.12.05 for
Rs.11,50,000.00
towards commissioning of the TG Set when
presented to our bankers has returned unpaid due
to your stop payment instructions (copy enclosed)
We have been requesting you to release the above
payment though various letters including our last
letter to you dated
21.2.06. But, it is regretted
that you have not done so. Under these
circumstances we will be compelled to refer the
matter to our legal department for suitable steps if
the above payment of Rs.11,50,000.00 is not
received by us within 72 hours of receipt of this
letter at your end by D.D. payable at Delhi.
We still hope that you will make arrangements to
release the above payment without recourse to other
steps.”

3.

In response to the said letter, the petitioner sent a reply

Crl.Rev.P.377/07 & Crl.M.A.6248-49/07

Page 2/10

dated 10.3.2006 disputing the liability and raising issues
about performance by the respondent.

The petitioner

addressed another letter dated 20.3.2006 through advocate
to the respondent whereafter a complaint was filed u/s 138
of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1821 (hereinafter referred
to as the said Act).
4.

It may be relevant to note that the legal notice was also
replied to by the petitioner and the petitioner has filed a suit
for recovery of Rs.1.77 crores at Kolkatta on account of
breach of the obligation of the respondent and both these
instances happened in April, 2006. The complaint filed was
on 3.6.2006 along with an application for condonation of
delay in filing the complaint of 28 days. This 28 days delay
has been reckoned on the basis of the legal notice dated
20.3.2006.

5.

The trial court in terms of the order dated 13.9.2006
condoned the delay in filing the complaint without issuing
any notice to the petitioner and thereafter summoning order
was passed against the petitioner with notice returnable on
20.3.2007. The petitioner entered appearance on 20.3.2007
whereafter the impugned notice u/s 251 Cr.P.C. has been
framed.

6.

Learned senior counsel for the petitioner contends that the
application filed by the petitioner for condonation of delay
could not have been allowed without notice to the petitioner

Crl.Rev.P.377/07 & Crl.M.A.6248-49/07

Page 3/10

and in that behalf has referred to the judgment of the
learned single Judge of this Court in Prashant Goel Vs. State
and Another, 134 (2006) DLT 221 wherein it has been held
that the principles of audi alteram partem applied to even
administrative
proceedings.

proceedings,

leave

aside

judicial

The rules of natural justice was held to be

important parameters of fairness of procedure and, thus,
when a complaint was time-barred, the other side got
valuable rights inasmuch as time-barred complaint could
not be considered on merits unless the delay is condoned.
Thus, the accused had a right to argue that in given
circumstances delay be not condoned. The accused, thus,
could not be deprived of such a valuable right and it was
held that this principle would be applicable whether the
case originates on the lodging of the FIR as a State case or
it is on the basis of the complaint filed by the complainant.
These observations

were also made in view of the

pronouncement of the Apex Court in State of Maharashtra
Vs. Sharadchandra Vinayak Dongre, (1995) 1 SCC 42.
7.

A reading of the aforesaid judgment makes the issue no
more res integra and, thus, the order of the trial court
condoning the delay in issuing summoning and passing the
summoning order cannot be sustained.

The petitioner

ought to have been granted an opportunity first while
issuing the notice on the application for condonation of

Crl.Rev.P.377/07 & Crl.M.A.6248-49/07

Page 4/10

delay before proceeding to the next stage, which did not
happen.
8.

The matter does not rest at this since if this was the only
issue, the impugned order condoning the delay dated
13.9.2006 could have been set aside giving an opportunity
to the petitioner to argue the case before the trial court.

9.

An important aspect which arises in the facts of the present
case is on account of the respondent having relied only on
the notice sent through a counsel on 20.3.2006 even for
seeking condonation of delay. Surprisingly there is not even
a mention in the complaint and the earlier notice dated
1.3.2006.

It is this notice which is material since if the

notice issued on 1.3.2006 can be said to be a notice within
the meaning of Section 138 of the said Act, then it would
not be permissible to issue a second notice on 20.3.2006
and claim the right to file a complaint within the stipulated
period of the said date.
10.

In Krishna Exports Vs. Raju Das, (2004) 13 SC 498, the Apex
Court reiterated the observation made in Sadanandan
Bhandran Vs. Madhvan Sunil Kumar, (1998) 6 SCC 514
where it was held that the two apparent conflicting
provisions of the N.I. Act, one enabling the payee to
repeatedly present the cheque and the other giving him
only one opportunity to file a complaint for its dishonour
have to be harmoniously read with the interpretation that

Crl.Rev.P.377/07 & Crl.M.A.6248-49/07

Page 5/10

on each presentation of the cheque and its dishonour, a
fresh right and not cause of action accrues in his favour.
Where on failure of drawer of cheque to make payment
within 15 days of receipt of the first notice the complaint
was filed beyond the period of one month thereafter, the
same was barred by limitation.

The contention that the

period of one month should be reckoned with reference to
the expiry of the period of 15 days after the second notice
was issued, is not sustainable. The complaint has to be filed
within one month from the day immediately following the
day on which the period of 15 days from the date of receipt
of the first notice by the drawer expires.
11.

Learned senior counsel for the petitioner relied upon the
judgment of the Apex Court in Central Bank of India & Anr.
Vs. Saxons Farms and Ors., (1999) 8 SCC 221 to contend
that there is no form of notice prescribed in clause (b) of the
proviso to Section 138 of the said Act and the requirement
is only that the notice shall be given in writing within 15
days of the receipt of information from the bank regarding
return of the cheque as unpaid and in the notice there
should be a demand for payment of the amount of the
cheque. The factual matrix is also similar in terms of the
nature of the notice sent and the notice ended with the
words “kindly arrange to make the payment to avoid the
unpleasant action of my client”. This notice was held to be

Crl.Rev.P.377/07 & Crl.M.A.6248-49/07

Page 6/10

a notice within the meaning of clause (b) of Section 138 of
the said Act.
12.

There is no specific time period prescribed for the payment
of the amount by the drawer in pursuance to the notice u/s
138 of the said Act but what is required is an intimation of
dishonour to be given to the drawer of the cheque and the
payee or holder in due course of the cheque becomes
entitled to file a complaint in case drawer of the cheque fails
to make the payment within 15 days of the receipt of the
notice. This legal position is made abundantly clear in view
of the judgment of this Court in Puri International (P) Ltd. &
Anr. Vs. Ram Lal Bansiwal & Sons, 135 (2006) DLT 103.

13.

Learned senior counsel for the respondent sought to rely on
the judgment of the Apex Court in D. Vinod Shivappa Vs.
Nanda Belliappa, AIR 2006 SC 2179 to advance the
proposition that a discretion is given to the Court to take
cognizance of a complaint even after prescribed period if
the complainant satisfies the Court that he has sufficient
cause for not making the complaint within such period. The
object of the proviso to Section 138 of the said Act was held
to provide an opportunity to an honest drawer of the cheque
to make the payments but not to protect unscrupulous
drawers who never intended to honour the cheques issued
by them.

14.

In my considered view, the said judgment would have no

Crl.Rev.P.377/07 & Crl.M.A.6248-49/07

Page 7/10

application to the facts of the present case since the two
aspects which have arisen for consideration is whether such
an application for condonation of delay could have been
allowed without notice to the accused and the factum of the
earlier notice dated 1.3.2006 issued by the respondent
which meets the parameters of Section 138 of the said Act
and, thus, dis-entitles the complaint from being based on a
subsequent notice dated 20.3.2007.
15.

If the notice issued on 1.3.2006 is perused (which is
reproduced above), it refers to the intimation received from
the bankers of the respondent about the cheque not being
honored.

Thereafter it proceeds to refer to the request

made by the respondent for release of the payment which
had not been so made and makes a demand for payment of
the amount of Rs.11,50,000/- within 72 hours failing which
the matter would be referred to the legal department of the
respondent for suitable steps. Thus, all the ingredients of a
notice under sub-clause (b) of Section 138 of the said Act
are satisfied, which reads as under:“138. Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency,
etc, of funds in the account.__
Where any cheque drawn by a person on an
account maintained by him with a banker for
payment of any amount of money to another
person from out of that account for the
discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or
other liability, is returned by the bank
unpaid, either because of the amount of
money standing to the credit of that account
is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it
exceeds the amount arranged to be paid
Crl.Rev.P.377/07 & Crl.M.A.6248-49/07

Page 8/10

from that account by an agreement made
with that bank, such person shall be deemed
to have committed an offence and shall,
without prejudice to any other provision of
this Act, be punished with imprisonment for
a term which may be extended to two years,
or with fine which may be extended to two
years, or with fine which may extend to
twice the amount of the cheque, or with
both:
Provided that nothing contained in this
section shall apply unless_
(a)..............
(b) the payee or the holder in due course of
the cheque, as the case may be, makes a
demand for the payment of the said amount
of money by giving a notice in writing, to the
drawer of the cheque, within thirty days of the
receipt of information by him from the bank
regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid.”

16.

It is not possible to accept the contention of learned senior
counsel for the respondent that the said notice was only
informal having been sent by the respondent without legal
assistance.

It is not relevant as to whether it is a notice

through counsel or is sent by the party but what is relevant
is that the essential ingredients of a notice u/s 138 of the
said Act are satisfied. The notice dated 1.3.2006 meets the
said requirement and ignorance of law can be no defence.
17.

Learned senior counsel for the respondent tried to canvass
the proposition that the respondent should be given an
opportunity to move another application for condonation of
delay assuming that the relevant notice is dated 1.3.2006.
Such a prayer cannot be allowed for the reason that there is

Crl.Rev.P.377/07 & Crl.M.A.6248-49/07

Page 9/10

no such application filed along with the complaint and the
complainant has not even cared to refer to the notice in the
complaint and, thus, has made out no cause of action on the
basis of the notice dated 1.3.2006.

There is, in fact,

concealment of this material notice in the complaint.
18.

Learned senior counsel for the petitioner contends that
there are serious disputes between the parties in respect of
their rights and obligations to supply the machinery and the
petitioner has even filed a civil suit in which not even a
counter claim has been filed by the respondent. The said
fact would, in my considered view, be not material at this
stage of the proceeding to return a finding whether the
complaint is maintainable.

19.

The result of the aforesaid is that the impugned order dated
20.3.2007 framing notice against the petitioner and the
criminal complaint filed by the petitioner is quashed, the
petitioner is discharged and the petition is allowed, leaving
the parties to bear their own costs.
Crl.M.A.6248/2007

20.

The application has become infructuous and is disposed of.
