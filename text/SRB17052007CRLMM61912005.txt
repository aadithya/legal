Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat:
1.

The petitioner has invoked the inherent jurisdiction of this Court for

quashing of an order made by the Metropolitan Magistrate on 6.4.2005, and all
further criminal proceedings.

2.

Briefly the facts of the case are that the Respondent (hereinafter referred to

as "complainant"), in a complaint under Section 190 Criminal Procedure Code
CRL.M.C 6191-94/2005

1 of 7

filed on 31.3.2005 alleged that the petitioner was guilty of having committed
offences under Sections 420/467/468/471 & 501 read with 120-B/34 IPC. It was
alleged that the complainant was dishonestly induced by the accused persons to
deliver valuable goods namely, textile yarn. It was alleged that the accused had
approached the complainant to deliver goods to M/s Fisba Enterprises Pvt. Ltd.
alleged to be registered with Sales Tax Authorities. It was alleged by the
complainant that the accused also held out that goods could be purchased without
payment of tax, against ST-1 Forms. According to the complainant a copy of the
registration certificate of Fisba Enterprises was handed over, to the latter.
Apparently on the strength of the representations, goods were delivered and some
payments were made.

3.

In the course of the transactions Rs.14,15,000/- was paid through cheques

but upon presentation, they were dishonoured. The complainant alleged that the
petitioner induced him to present the cheques again; upon doing so they were
dishonoured. The complaint further alleged that in spite of requests ST-1 Forms
were not released and the Sales Tax Officer levied tax @ 4% on the goods
supplied. It was also averred that during February/March, 2005 the registration
certificate issued, was verified and found to be false; according to the allegation
the sales tax authorities informed the complainant that no certificate evidencing

CRL.M.C 6191-94/2005

2 of 7

sales tax registration in favour of Fisba Enterprises was in existence. It was,
therefore, alleged that the certificate was forged and used with dishonest intent, to
induce the complainant to part with valuable property. The complainant further
alleged that he was threatened and intimidated on 31.3.2005.

4.

Upon receiving the complaint the Court directed it to be checked and

registered. Counsel for the complainant was heard and the SHO, P.S. Defence
Colony was directed to get the case registered and investigate the matter under
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C; a further direction to file complaint registered on 31.5.2005
was made. On 7.12.2005 this Court while issuing notice, directed the stay of
further orders of the Magistrate even while granting liberty to act upon the FIR
lodged by the police.

5.

Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned senior counsel urged that the complaint is an

abuse of process of Court and should be quashed in exercise of the powers of the
Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. It was urged that the complainant intentionally
and with malice chose to approach the Court under Section 156(3) even though, in
respect of several cheques which are the bone of contention, he instituted separate
complaint proceedings on allegations of commission of offences under Section
138/14 Cr.P.C. It was urged that the complainant, Surinder Patwa impleaded M/s

CRL.M.C 6191-94/2005

3 of 7

Fisba Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. as well as the present petitioners, the Directors in each
of those proceedings concerning the 16 cheques in dispute.

In these

circumstances, the filing of an application under Section 156 and issuance of the
impugned order amounted to multiplicity of proceedings and harassment.

6.

Counsel contended that what is essentially a civil dispute is sought to be

imparted cloak of a criminal offence which cannot be countenanced. He placed
reliance upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in G.Sagar Suri Vs. State of U.P.
2000 (2) SCC 636 as well as similar judgments. Learned counsel relied upon
copies of several documents said to be invoices, raised upon M/s Fisba Enterprises
to state that sales-tax in fact had been collected and, therefore, the allegations
levelled were completely unfounded; no loss much less wrongful loss to the tune
of Rs.79,44,230.26 as alleged in the complaint aver arose. Counsel submitted that
on these grounds the Court ought to invoke its inherent jurisdiction to further the
ends of justice and quash the impugned order as well as First Information Report
(FIR) lodged on 7.4.2005.
7.

Learned counsel for the respondents opposed the petition and submitted that

the petitioner has no locus standi to question the impugned order since in the
absence of an order issuing process, or taking cognizance of the offence, the Court
has been virtually called upon to interdict and stall the investigation process, thus

CRL.M.C 6191-94/2005

4 of 7

hampering the machinery provided under Criminal Procedure Code.

8.

Learned counsel urged that the power under Section 482 to quash criminal

proceedings cannot be resorted to specially when the allegations such as cheating,
intimidation and forgery are made, without allowing the police authorities to carry
out investigation in accordance with law. Counsel submitted that the principles
governing exercise of exceptional jurisdiction under Section 482 are well
established; it can be resorted when taken as a whole, the complaint/FIR does not
disclose a cognizable offence; when the complaint/FIR is motivated by malice and
where the Court is of the opinion that the allegations are so absurd or unreasonable
that the alleged offence could not have occurred.
9.

The above factual matrix would show that the petitioner purports to be

aggrieved by an order under Section 156(3) and the subsequent follow up action
taken by the police, in lodging the FIR. The complaint lodged by the respondents
is clear - it levels some serious allegations concerning the petitioners conduct, in
dishonestly inducing him to supply goods, and later not making payments; there
are also allegations of using forged documents such as fabricated as well as tax
registration certificate. Prima facie, the contents of the complaint, a copy of which
has been produced and is a part of the present record, disclose the allegations
which point to ingredients of the offences mentioned.

10.

It has been often held by the Supreme Court in judgments (Refer: T.

Vengama Naidu Vs. T. Doraswamy Naidu) (Crl.No.274/2007 decided on
27.2.2007) that the High Court should not, at the stage of investigation examine
the nature of transaction to scrutinize as to whether any offence is actually made
against accused persons. The only scope of judicial scrutiny, possible at that stage
is to see whether the complaint or FIR contained allegations of any offence. (Ref:
State of Karnataka Vs. Pastor P. Raju 2006(3) JCC 1398) A Division Bench of
this Court in Daulat Radhu Bhatija Vs. State 1994(2) CCC 433 held that an order
under Section 156(3) directing investigation and filing of a status report does not
amount to taking cognizance and that even a direction to register a case, though
seemingly irregular, is of no consequence, and cannot be held to be illegal.
11.

As mentioned in the preceding part of this order, three distinct allegations

about dishonest inducement to part with goods on the strength of existence of sales
tax certificate and there being no need to pay sales tax; the withholding of monies
due and use of alleged fabricated documents point to ingredients of the offences.
Therefore, the Court cannot conclude that there are no allegations. The Court has
not even considered the investigation by the police. Having regard to the nature of
the allegations, and the scope of this proceeding, this is neither an appropriate nor
a proper case where invocation of inherent jurisdiction is called for. This view is
also strengthened by the order of this Court on 22.8.2005 when writ petitions (Crl.)

CRL.M.C 6191-94/2005

6 of 7

No.1281 -1285/2005, in respect of the First Information Report were dismissed.
12.

In view of the above conclusions and after having considered all the

materials on record, I am satisfied that no case for quashing the order of the trial
court, or the complaint has been made out. The petition, therefore, fails and is
hereby dismissed without any order as to costs.
