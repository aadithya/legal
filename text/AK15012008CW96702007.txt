The petitioner has impugned the award dated 13th December,
2006 holding that the petitioner has not been able to prove that he
worked continuously for 240 days in the preceding 12 months from
the date of termination as contemplated under Section 25B of
Industrial Disputes Act and, therefore, his services has not been
terminated illegally.

The Court relied on the facts that the claimant for the first time
alleged in his cross examination that the signatures were obtained
from the petitioner on blank papers though no such plea was taken in
the claim petition and no complaint was made to any of the
authorities. The complaint which was filed against the management
was only regarding grade of wages and that apart from that he had
demanded his earned wages.

The Court also relied on the facts that three ESIC identity cards
were issued to the petitioner bearing three different numbers on
which he admitted his signatures. It was inferred that the petitioner
had been employed at different times and there had been full and
final settlement with him. The petitioner also admitted that had he
joined duties with the respondent once only, then only one ESIC card

WP(C) No.9670/2007

Page 2 of 7

would have been issued to him. He was unable to explain as to how
three ESIC cards were issued to him, if he worked continuously.

The Court also drew an inference that the petitioner was not
employed for 240 days in preceding 12 months from the date of
termination, on the ground that he never made any complaint before
the minimum wage authority. The complaints which were filed by him
were only in respect of grade of wages and his demand for earned
wages.

The

testimony

of

WW2

Sh.Kamalbas

Chaudhary

was

disbelieved. Reliance was also placed on MW1/A which is in the
following terms:“We have not terminated service of Sh. Shyam Sunder.
Rather he is absenting from duty without any information
or approval since 10.06.95. He may be directed to join his
duties immediately as our work is suffering.”

The management also proved that the petitioner

joined

management first on 24th July, 1988 and worked up to December,
1988 and left his job by resignation letter dated 3rd January, 1989.
The management proved the letter of appointment and letter of
resignation. On the verbal request of the workman he was allowed to
join again with effect from 11th November, 1989 and he worked up to
31st May, 1990. The workman again left and came to Delhi third time
and joined the management from 17th July, 1990 and worked up to 3rd

May, 1992 and left after collecting his dues. Lastly he joined
management with effect from 12th May, 1995 and abandoned his
services with effect from 10th June, 1995. The muster rolls and other
relevant

documents

have

been

produced

and

proved

by

the

management which has been believed.

Considering all these factors and relying on (2004) SCC 161,
Rajasthan State Ganganagar S.Mills Ltd Vs. State of Rajasthan and
Delhi (2004) SLT 566, Municipal Corporation, Faridabad Vs.Shriniwas
it has been held that the petitioner has failed to prove that he worked
continuously for 240 days in the preceding 12 months from the date
of his alleged termination.

In AIR 1979 Supreme Court 582, G.T.Lad and others vs.
Chemicals and Fibers India Limited Supreme Court had held that
whether there has been a voluntary abandonment of services or not is
a question of fact which is to be determined in the light of
surrounding circumstances. While exercising powers of judicial review
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, this Court is not to reappreciate the evidence and reach a different inference and substitute
the inferences drawn by the Labor Court with its own inferences. It is
a settled position of law that in exercise of jurisdiction under Article

WP(C) No.9670/2007

Page 4 of 7

226 of the Constitution of India, the Court should not interfere with
factual findings of the lower courts and should restrain itself from reappreciating evidence while exercising powers of judicial review.
Reliance for this proposition can be placed on the judgment of the
Supreme Court, Government of A.P. and Ors. v. Mohd. Nasrullah
Khan reported as (2006) 2 SCC 373. Reliance may also be placed on
the following judgments rendered by the Supreme Court and this
Court concerning the scope of judicial review by a writ court: Harbans
Lal v. Jagmohan Saran (1985) 4 SCC 333; B.C. Chaturvedi v. Union of
India (1995) 6 SCC 749; Indian Overseas Bank v. I.O.B. staff Canteen
Workers' Union AIR 2000 SC 1508 ; Municipal Corporation of Delhi v.
Asha Ram and Anr.117 (2005) DLT 63 and Filmistan Exhibitors Ltd.
v. N.C.T. Secy. Labour and Ors. 131 (2006) DLT. In all the above
judgments, it has been held that a writ court should refrain from
interfering with the orders of an inferior tribunal or subordinate court
unless it suffers from an error of jurisdiction, or from a breach of the
principles of natural justice or is vitiated by a manifest or apparent
error of law.

The objective of judicial review is that a person receives a fair
treatment and objective is not to re-appreciate the entire pleas and
evidence and draw inferences again. The Apex Court in (1995) 6 SCC

WP(C) No.9670/2007

Page 5 of 7

749 B.C.Chaturvedi Vs Union of India at page 759 in para 12 had
held as under:
“ 12 . Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision
but a review of the manner in which the decision is made.
Power of judicial review is meant to ensure that the
individual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that
the conclusion which the authority reaches is necessarily
correct in the eye of the court. When an inquiry is
conducted on charges of misconduct by a public servant,
the Court/Tribunal is concerned to determine whether
the inquiry was held by a competent officer or whether
rules of natural justice are complied with. Whether
the findings or conclusions are based on some
evidence, the authority entrusted with the power to
hold inquiry has jurisdiction, power and authority to
reach a finding of fact or conclusion. But that finding
must be based on some evidence. Neither the technical
rules of Evidence Act nor of proof of fact or evidence
as defined therein, apply to disciplinary proceeding.
When the authority accepts that evidence and conclusion
receives support therefrom, the disciplinary authority is
entitled to hold that the delinquent officer is guilty of the
charge. The Court/Tribunal in its power of judicial
review does not act as Appellate Authority to reappreciate the evidence and to arrive at its own
independent findings on the evidence. The Court/
Tribunal may interfere where the authority held the
proceedings against the delinquent officer in a manner
inconsistent with the rules of natural justice or in
violation of statutory rules prescribing the mode of
inquiry or where the conclusion or finding reached by the
disciplinary authority is based on no evidence. If the
conclusion or finding be such as no reasonable person
would have ever reached, the Court/Tribunal may
interfere with the conclusion or the finding, and
mould the relief so as to make it appropriate to the
facts of each case.”

The learned counsel for the petitioner is unable to point out any
perversity or manifest error in the order of the Labor Court. There is
WP(C) No.9670/2007

Page 6 of 7

no denial of principle of natural justice nor any such plea has been
taken or argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner. There are
no grounds to interfere with the order dated 13th December, 2006 in
the facts and circumstances and the writ petition is dismissed.
