PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

S.N.Sapra has challenged 2 orders passed by the

learned Executing Court. Firstly, he challenges the order dated
6.11.2006 under which his objection to the enforceability of the
judgment and decree dated 2.9.2004 has been repelled. The
second order under challenge is dated 2.12.2006 wherein
similar objections filed by him laying a challenge to the decree
CRP No.360/2006

Page No.1 of 10

itself has been repelled by the learned Executing Court. The
reason which principally flows in both the orders is that earlier
on also, S.N.Sapra had filed objections to the execution of the
decree which were dismissed vide order dated 27.5.2005. An
additional reason is to be found to the effect that similar pleas
were negated when his application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC
was dismissed vide order dated 20.5.2005.
2.

Respondents hereinafter collectively referred to as

'Janas' and S.N.Sapra are at loggerheads with each other since
the year 1994.
3.

Property No.M-38, Chittranjan Park, New Delhi was

owned by P.K.Jana and his wife Usha Jana on whose death her
share in the property was inherited by her 2 children, Sandeep
and Saurav.

Janas filed a suit for ejectment of S.N.Sapra

alleging that he was a tenant under them in respect of the
second floor of the property.

They alleged that the tenancy

stood determined and hence they were entitled to possession
thereof. In the said suit S.N.Sapra filed a counter claim. He
relied upon a memorandum dated 5.1.1994 and pleaded that
the same was an agreement to sell. He pleaded that under the
memorandum dated 5.1.1994 he was put in possession of the
second floor and that total sale consideration agreed to was
Rs.3 lacs. That he paid Rs.30,000/- when memorandum was
CRP No.360/2006

Page No.2 of 10

executed. He pleaded that from time to time he made further
payments.

He prayed that a decree may be passed in his

favour as under :“I.
That the counter claim be accepted, the
decree/order be passed in favour of the
defendants directing the plaintiffs to execute
the transfer deeds in respect of the flat No.M38, Chittaranjan Park, New Delhi.
II.
A decree for permanent injunction be
passed in favour of the defendants restraining
the plaintiffs from alienating, transferring,
disposing off creating any third party interest
and also from interfering with the supply of
water and electricity in the said flat.
III.

Cost of counter claim be allowed.

Any other and further relief which this Hon'ble
Court may deem fit and proper in the
circumstances of the case including the
dismissal of plaint may also be granted.”
4.

S.N.Sapra failed to contest the suit filed by Janas.

He failed to prosecute his counter claim. Result was that his
counter claim was dismissed and Janas obtained an ex-parte
decree for possession against him on 4.9.2004.
5.

S.N.Sapra filed an application under Order 9 Rule 13

CPC for setting aside of the ex-parte decree.

In the said

application he pleaded that since the suit for ejectment was
based on the premise that he was a tenant but the facts were
otherwise, being that, under the memorandum dated 5.1.1994
he was a bona fide purchaser of the second floor, the decree
CRP No.360/2006

Page No.3 of 10

ought to be recalled.
6.

Needless to state, scope of Order 9 Rule 13 CPC was

restricted to sufficiency of the cause shown for non-appearance
when suit was decreed ex-parte.

Finding none, vide order

dated 20.5.2005 S.N.Sapra's application under Order 9 Rule 13
CPC was dismissed.
7.

S.N.Sapra fought the battle right up to the Hon'ble

Supreme Court but failed in his endeavour to have the ex-parte
decree set aside.
8.

It is this decree which is the subject matter of

repeated objections filed by S.N.Sapra from time to time as and
when Janas obtain warrants for possession of the property.
9.

Simultaneously while prosecuting his application

under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC, on 16.12.2004, S.N.Sapra filed a
suit

for

declaration,

permanent

performance against Janas.

injunction

and

specific

The basis of the suit was the

memorandum dated 5.1.1994. Relying thereon, S.N.Sapra
pleaded that he was in possession of the second floor of the
property in question under the memorandum and that from
time to time he had paid Janas a total sum of Rs.1,23,600/-.
That since total sale consideration was Rs.3 lacs, he pleaded
that he was ready and willing to pay the balance sale
consideration in sum of Rs.1,76,400/-. He pleaded that he was
CRP No.360/2006

Page No.4 of 10

entitled to the specific performance of the memorandum dated
5.1.1994.
10.

Prayers made in the suit are as under :“I) To pass a decree of declaration in favour
of the plaintiff and against the defendants
whereby declaring that the plaintiff alone is
entitled to get the regular sale deed executed
from the defendants No.1 and 2 under the
terms and conditions of Memorandum of
Understanding dated 1-5-94 of second floor

Chittranjan Park, New Delhi more fully shown
and described in the site plan annexed with

justice.
II.

Park, New Delhi to any other person to meet

plaintiff to meet the ends of justice.
IV. Costs of suit be also awarded in favour of
the plaintiff to meet the ends of justice.
V.
Any other and further orders/directions
which this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and
proper into the circumstances of the case be
also passed in favour of th plaintiff to meet
the ends of justice.”
11.

It may be noted that S.N.Sapra did not mention in

the said suit that he had raised a counter claim in the suit filed
by Janas for his ejectment. He did not disclose that the said
counter claim was dismissed in default.

It also suffered dismissal in default.

No

application for restoration has been filed till date.
13.

When the decree dated 2.9.1994 was put into

execution S.N.Sapra filed objections to the execution of the
decree. Vide order dated 27.5.2005 the said objections were
dismissed. It be noted that the objection filed by S.N.Sapra was
to the effect that the decree for ejectment being based on the
CRP No.360/2006

Page No.6 of 10

premise that he was a tenant, he was entitled to protect his
possession under the memorandum dated 5.1.1994.
14.

Since order dated 27.5.2005 is not under challenge

and has attained finality, I need not go into the legality or
otherwise of the said order dated 27.5.2005.
15.

S.N.Sapra thereafter resorted to a third action. He

filed a civil suit on the original side of this Court praying that
the decree dated 2.9.2004 was a result of fraud and it be
declared a nullity.

Fraud pleaded was that Janas had not

disclosed to the Court that they had entered into the
memorandum dated 5.1.1994.
16.

The said suit registered as CS(OS) No.2202/2006

was dismissed as withdrawn stating that S.N.Sapra intended to
raise objections permissible in law to resist execution of the
decree.
17.

He once again, and as noted above, repeatedly filed

objections to the execution of the decree.

The first objection

(in fact the second for the reason the first was dismissed vide
order dated 27.5.2005) was dismissed vide order dated
6.11.2006.

The second (in fact the third) objection was

dismissed vide order dated 2.12.2006.
18.

The conduct of S.N.Sapra is to be deprecated. He is

resorting to successive litigation.
CRP No.360/2006

He is guilty of not
Page No.7 of 10

prosecuting his remedies as per law.

He cannot keep on

flogging a dead horse.
19.

The submission made by learned senior counsel for

S.N.Sapra that the decree for ejectment obtained by Janas is on
the premise that S.N.Sapra's possession was that of a tenant
can be successfully resisted to by S.N.Sapra by pleading and
proving independent title is neither here nor there for the
simple reason S.N.Sapra has lost his right to raise the said plea
in as much as his right to specifically enforce the memorandum
dated 5.1.1994 on which relies is no longer available to him for
the reason firstly his counter claim wherein a decree as prayed
for in para 3 above stands dismissed, though in default.
Secondly, the suit for specific performance filed by him in
which prayers made were as noted in para 10 above stands
dismissed, though in default.

His remedies to specifically

enforce the agreement to sell as of today is barred by
limitation.
20.

Further, the so called fraud alleged by S.N.Sapara is

not of the kind which vitiates the decree dated 2.9.2004.
21.

The reason thereof is that admittedly, a fact

admitted by S.N.Sapra, he had executed a rent agreement with
the Janas.

In his counter claim and in his suit, S.N.Sapra

pleaded that the rent agreement was a part of various
CRP No.360/2006

Page No.8 of 10

documents which included the memorandum dated 5.1.1994
executed between the parties.

He pleaded that the real

transaction was an agreement to sell and not a lease. In other
words, S.N.Sapra required the Court to consider and decide as
to what was the true nature of the transaction between the
parties. All relevant documents were placed before the Court.
Pleadings in relation thereto were made by the parties.

If

S.N.Sapra chose to suffer ex-parte decrees and also chose to
abandon the counter claim filed by him as also the subsequent
suit seeking decree for specific performance, he must suffer
the consequences.
22.

Besides, S.N.Sapra cannot keep on filing same set of

objections as and when decree holder applies for warrants for
possession. As noted hereinabove, the first set of objections
filed by him were dismissed vide order dated 27.5.2005. He
did not challenge the said order. It was thus impermissible for
him to have filed the subsequent 2 objections on similar lines
which were dismissed vide impugned orders dated 6.11.2006
and 2.12.2006.
23.

I find no merits in the petition.

24.

The same is dismissed with costs in sum of

Rs.25,000/- imposed upon the petitioner and granted in favour
of the respondents.
