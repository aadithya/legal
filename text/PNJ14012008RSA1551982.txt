1.

The appeal was dismissed in default on 13.3.2003.

Vide CM 12785/2005 restoration of the appeal has been prayed
for. Vide CM No. 12787/2005 delay in filing CM No.12785/2005
is prayed for.
2.

The second appeal was filed in the year 1982. This
Page 1 of 5

court could not decide the same for 21 years. That by itself is
a ground to condone the delay for the reason having made to
stand in the queue for 21 years it would be a travesty of justice
if this court were to persist with the order dated 13.3.2003. 21
years wait is enough to put any person into slumber.
3.

Delay in filing CM No. 12785/2005 is accordingly

condoned.
4.

The application is allowed.

+CM No.12785/2005

in filing CM No.12785/2005 the application needs to be allowed
and order dated 13.3.2003 needs to be recalled.

The application is allowed. Order dated 13.3.2003 is

recalled.

+RSA No.155/1982
1.

With consent of parties the appeal is heard for

disposal.
2.

On 2.6.1982 apart from two other questions one

question of law framed was:“Whether statutory tenancy of commercial premises
is inheritable?”
3.

The issue is no longer res integra being covered by

a Constitution Bench decision of the Supreme Court reported
as 1985 (2) SCC 683 Gyan Devi Anand Vs. Jeevan Kumari as
explained by a Division Bench of the Supreme Court reported
as

AIR 2003 SC 1475 Swaran Kumar Vs. Madan Kumar

Aggarwal.
4.

When the impugned judgments and decrees were

pronounced law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

Page 3 of 5

decision reported as Ganpath Laddha Vs. Shashi Kant Vishnu
AIR 1976 SC 955 was in vogue. View taken was that statutory
tenancies are not inheritable.
aforesaid view was overruled.

In Gyan Devi's case (supra)
It was held that statutory

tenancies are inheritable.
5.

The amendment to the Delhi Rent Control Act was

also noted. Since the amendment related to the definition of
tenant pertaining to residential properties it was explained that
in view of the legislative amendment as far as residential
properties were concerned, statutory tenancies would be
inherited limited as per the statute, but for commercial
properties, contractual as well as statutory tenancies would be
inherited as per the general law.
6.

In Swaran Kumar's case it was held that the decision

in Gyan Devi's case was not to be applied prospectively. It had
to be applied retrospectively.
7.

Instant case is admittedly that of a commercial

tenancy. It relates to a shop at a property in Hauz Qazi.
8.

Holding that Sarabjit Singh was a statutory tenant, it

has held that on his death the tenancy came to an end.
9.

Thus, the appeal has to be allowed.

10.

Impugned judgments and decrees passed by the

learned Trial Judge as affirmed by the first Appellate Judge are
Page 4 of 5

set aside.
11.

Suit for ejectment filed by the respondents is

dismissed.
12.

No costs.
