The plaintiff had instituted the suit in respect of its trademarks

“KUNDAN” and “KUNDAN CAB” in respect of electric accessories and
fittings including electric switch gears, main switches, fuse unit wires and
cables. The defendant had adopted the mark “KHUMAN CAB” in respect of
the same goods.

Now, the parties have settled the disputes whereby the

defendant has acknowledged that the plaintiff is the proprietor of the
trademarks “KUNDAN” and “KUNDAN CAB” in respect of the said goods.
The defendant has also undertaken not to directly or indirectly manufacture any
of the goods in question under or using the imitation labels or any other
packaging material and /or wrapper bearing the trade marks “KUNDAN CAB”,
“KHUMAN CAB” and “KHUMAN CAB LABEL” or any other deceptively
similar trademark as that of the plaintiff. It has also been agreed that the
defendant shall not use any artistic work, colour scheme, getup or layout which
is similar to that of the plaintiff's artistic work, colour scheme, getup or layout
in respect of the said goods. The defendant has also undertaken to withdraw
the application for registration of the trademark “KHUMAN CAB” which she
had filed before the Trade Mark Registry. The parties have agreed that the suit
may be decreed in terms of paragraph 26 (i) (a), (b) and (c) of the plaint. The
plaintiff has agreed to give up all the other reliefs claimed by it in the plaint.
The parties have also agreed that they shall be bound by the terms of this
settlement and that it also binds their agents, representatives, legal heirs and all
other persons claiming under them.
