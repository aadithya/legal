ANIL KUMAR, J.
1.

The applicants, Shri Tilak Raj, Shri A.R. Rahman, Shri Suresh

Chand, Shri Vijender Kumar and Shri Raj Kumar, have sought
directions against the petitioner/management to pay them last drawn
wages from the date of award or minimum wages prescribed by the
Government of NCT, whichever is higher, under Section 17-B of
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

The applicants contended that an award dated 28th February,

2003 was passed in ID No.571 of 1997 by the Labor Court IV,
Karkardooma Courts, holding their termination illegal and directing the
petitioner to reinstate the applicants with full back wages and
continuity of service.

3.

The award dated 28th February, 2003 has been challenged by the

petitioner/management in the present petition. The

operation of the

award was stayed by order dated 22nd September, 2006.

4.

The applicants Shri Tilakraj, Shri Suresh Chand, Shri Raj Kumar

and Shri Vijender Kumar contended that they were drawing a salary of
Rs.3,000/- per month whereas applicant Shri A.R. Rahman was getting
a salary of Rs.3,500/- per month. The services of the applicants were
terminated by the management/petitioner on 19th May, 1997 which has
been held to be illegal and thus directing the petitioner to reinstate the
applicants/workmen which order has been stayed in the present writ
petition.

5.

The applicants have contended categorically that they have not

been able to get any regular employment in any establishment since the
date of their termination on 19th May, 1997 and they are undergoing
acute financial crisis on account of their unemployment.
CM 11831/2007 in WP (C) 14981 of 2006

6.

The applicants have filed affidavits deposing categorically that

they were terminated on 19th May, 1997 and by award dated 28th
February, 2003 their termination has been held to be illegal and the
petitioner had been directed to reinstate them.

The applicants have

also contended that they have remained unemployed since their illegal
termination on 19th May, 1997 except Shri Suresh Chand who has
deposed that he had worked on casual basis for two months from
January 2001 with M/s. Citadel Protection & Security and from
November 2002 to March 2003 with M/s.Alert Protection & Security as
casual driver on daily basis. Shri Suresh Chand/applicant contended
that he remained unemployed after his termination of service except
short employment on daily basis.

The said applicant, Shri Suresh

Chand, had deposed that he has not been able to get any alternative
employment despite his best efforts on his part.

7.

The application is contested by the petitioner/management. It is

contended that the affidavits filed by the workmen are false and,
therefore, the application requires no consideration. It is stated that
the award passed against the petitioner is ex parte and when the award
dated 28th February, 2003 was passed, the applicants were gainfully
employed and they had abandoned the work of the petitioner herein.

8.

In support of the contention of the petitioner that the applicants

had abandoned their jobs, it is contended that the services of the
applicant were never terminated and it is evident from the fact that only
10 workmen out of a large number of workmen had abandoned their
jobs without assigning any reason. It is further pleaded that out of 10
drivers who had abandoned their jobs, seven entered into witness box
and an ex parte award was passed in favor of seven workmen. The
present application, according to the petitioner/ management, has been
filed only by seven workman.

9.

Regarding applicant, Shri Suresh Chand, it is contended that he

is gainfully employed with M/s Alert Protection & Security and the
allegation of the said workman that he was employed casually was not
admitted.

An undated certificate has also been produced from M/s.

Alert Protection & Security stipulating that the said workman, Shri
Suresh Chand, was in their employment from July 2001 to March
2003.

10.

Refuting the claim of the applicant, Shri Suresh Chand, it is also

asserted that he was employed since 2001 and he was deriving
handsome wages from one M/s Citadel Protection & Security.
According to the petitioner, Shri Suresh Chand is still employed and he
was never employed on casual basis either with M/s Citadel Protection
& Security or with M/s Alert Protection & Security. Reliance has also
CM 11831/2007 in WP (C) 14981 of 2006

Page 4 of 12

been placed on a complaint filed by Shri Suresh Chand against M/s
Asia Protection & Security Services that his services were terminated
and he was not paid any arrears.

11.

Regarding other applicants, it is contended that Shri Tilakraj is

actively running a private bus and is thus gainfully employed.

In

respect of Mr. A.R. Rahman, Shri Vijender Kumar and Shri Raj Kumar,
it is stated that right from the date of abandoning, they never reported
to the petitioner to resume their work and the petitioner has
information that they are also gainfully employed. The petitioner has
also alleged that an ex parte award was passed on 28th February, 2003
and published on 30th June, 2003, however, they never preferred any
execution petition and the reason for this is stated to be that the
applicants were gainfully employed. The application is also opposed on
the ground that five workmen are drivers and, therefore, it is
unimaginable, that they are not gainfully employed after allegedly
abandoning their work.

12.

The petitioner also contended that it was engaged in the business

of providing car rental services and on account of the recovery suit filed
against the petitioner company by the financial institutions, the
company had to stop its entire business.

Since all the cars were

hypothecated and charged to TFCI, a financial institution, no business
at all is carried on for the last few years and the petitioner is in great
CM 11831/2007 in WP (C) 14981 of 2006

Page 5 of 12

financial crunch.

13.

The grant of last drawn wages and minimum wages, whichever is

higher, is also opposed on the ground that the applicants have not
disclosed the correct facts nor they have deposed that they had
completed 240 days of services and no demand notice was given by the
applicants.

14.

Perusal of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

reveals that it comes into operation when an Award directing
reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further proceedings by the
employer. The preliminary consideration for making available such a
relief under Section 17B to a workman is to be found in the benevolent
purpose of the enactment, its spirit, intendment and object underlying,
which is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship which
would be caused to a workman due to delay in the implementation of an
award directing reinstatement of his services on account of the
challenge made to it by the employer. Section 17B recognizes a
workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body and soul
together when a challenge has been made to an Award directing his
reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no inherent right of
assailing an order or an award by an industrial adjudicator by way of
an appeal. The payment which is required to be made by the employer
to the workman has been held to be akin to a subsistence allowance
CM 11831/2007 in WP (C) 14981 of 2006

Page 6 of 12

which is neither refundable nor recoverable from a workman even if the
Award in his favor is set aside by the High Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106
(para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex Court was of the
view that the object under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the hardship that is caused to
the workman due to the delay in implementation of the Award.

15.

Moreover granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing

orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule;
refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the relief
could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional
error where there is no relationship of employer and employee between
the parties.

16.

Thus if the requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes

Act, 1947 are satisfied then no order can be passed denying the
workman the benefit of statutory provisions of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The statute requires satisfaction of the
following four conditions:
(i) an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed
in proceedings in a High Court or the Supreme Court;
(ii) during the pendency of such proceedings, employer is
required to pay full wages to the workman;
(iii) the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full wages
last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance
CM 11831/2007 in WP (C) 14981 of 2006

Page 7 of 12

admissible to him under any Rule;
(iv) such wages would be admissible only if the workman
had not been employed in any establishment during such
period and an affidavit had been filed to such effect

17.

The practice of disposal of the petition as well as the application

under Section 17B of the Act contemporaneously was deprecated by the
Apex Court and the High Court was directed to first expeditiously
dispose of the application under Section 17B by the Supreme Court by
its decision reported at VII (2000) SLT 70=JT 2000 (8) SC 501,
Workmen Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Hindustan
Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. & Ors. While considering an application
under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Court cannot go
into the merits of the case in the writ petition. It was so held in 86
(2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.

18.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 entitled Town Municipal, Athani v.
P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman has
a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot
be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act for
enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was concerned with
the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the Court would have a

CM 11831/2007 in WP (C) 14981 of 2006

Page 8 of 12

bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well. From the
authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court, the right of a
workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified under the
Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the
constitutional mandate. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean
all the wages that have fallen due at least from the date of the Award.

19.

This cannot be disputed that an award has been passed in favor

of the applicants and against the petitioner directing reinstatement of
applicants with full back wages. Even if it is an ex parte award, the
order under Section 17 B is a beneficial legislation and no distinction
can be carved out between an award which is passed after hearing the
contention of the management and an award which has been passed ex
parte on the basis of the evidence on record. What emerges from the
various

decisions

referred

to

hereinabove

is

that

the

relevant

consideration for passing an order under section 17 B is that the
workman had an order in his favor for reinstatement which has been
stayed and the workman in unemployed having failed to get any
employment in any establishment. Consequently, the ground that an
ex parte award has been passed against the petitioner/management
cannot be a ground to deny them the relief under Section 17 B of
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

20.

The allegations against the applicants other than Shri Suresh

Chand are that they are gainfully employed, however, no particulars as
to where the other applicants are gainfully employed have been given.
Merely on the ground that they are the driver and they could have got
the employment, the relief to them under Section 17 B cannot be
denied, especially because they have deposed on affidavits that they are
unemployed since the date of the termination of their services.

The

allegation against Shri Tilak raj is that he is actively running a private
bus and is thus gainfully employed. Again no particulars as to which
bus and in what manner and where it is being run by the applicant,
Shri Tilakraj, has been given.

21

In respect of applicant, Shri Suresh Chand, it is stated that he is

gainfully employed and a certificate of M/s Alert Protection & Security
has also been produced by the petitioner.

The perusal of undated

certificate produced by the petitioner from M/s Alert Protection &
Security, however, reveals that it is only for employment of the
applicant, Shri Suresh Chand, from July 2001 upto March 2003 as he
was employed from July 2001 to March 2003.

On the basis of this

certificate, it cannot be inferred that the petitioner/applicant, Shri
Suresh Chand, has been employed after March 2003.

As far as non

disclosure of employment by the applicant, Shri Suresh Chand, before
the Labour Court before the award dated 28th February, 2003 was
passed with arrears of full back wages, the same shall be considered
CM 11831/2007 in WP (C) 14981 of 2006

Page 10 of 12

while considering the merits of directing reinstatement with full back
wages. On the ground that the employment after termination on 19th
May, 1997 from July 2001 to March 2003 was not disclosed, the relief
under Section 17 B of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 cannot be denied
to said applicant in the present facts and circumstances. Learned
counsel for the petitioner is also unable to show any precedent or any
rule whereby the relief which is in the nature of a beneficial legislation
to unemployed workman can be denied.

22.

In the circumstances, the petitioner has not been able to make

out any cogent reason for denying the relief claimed by the applicants.
Consequently, for the foregoing reasons, the application is allowed. The
petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or minimum wages
whichever is higher to the respondent/applicant from the date of award
i.e. 28th February, 2003, however, the applicant Sh.Suresh Chand shall
be entitled for last drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher
from 1st April, 2003. Arrears be paid to the applicants within eight
weeks. The petitioner shall continue to pay the last drawn wages or
minimum wages whichever is higher by the 15th day of every English
Calendar month during the pendency of the present writ petition unless
this order is set aside or modified. The respondents/applicants are also
directed to give an undertaking that in case the petition is allowed, they
shall refund/repay the different of amount of last drawn wages and the
minimum wages within such time which may be permitted by this
CM 11831/2007 in WP (C) 14981 of 2006

Court. The undertakings be filed by the respondents/applicants within
four weeks.
