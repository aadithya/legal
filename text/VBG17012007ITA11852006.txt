1.
By this common Judgment, four appeals being ITA Nos.
1184/06, 1185/06, 1186/06 and 1191/06 filed by the Appellant
are disposed of, as all these appeals have common ground.
2.

These appeals arise out of a decision dated 24th February,

ITA No. 1184-91/2006

Page 1 of 5

2006 passed by learned Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.
3.

Appellant is the owner of the premises bearing Municipal

No. 50/1, Ist Floor, Janpath, New Delhi which have been let out.
The rent of this premises was increased retrospectively with
effect from 1-4-94 by way of an agreement and as a result
thereof, the appellant received a sum of Rs. 38,55,827.40/during the financial year 1999-2000 on account of arrears of
rent for the period 1-4-94 to 31-03-99.

The appellant did not

offer this rental income in the year relevant to the assessment
year of receipt nor offered the same in the relevant assessment
years.
4.

Appellant's case is that he received the arrears of rent

during the financial year 1999-2000 on account of arrears of
rent for the period 1-4-94 to 31-3-99 which, in fact, was
damages and mesne profits received by the appellant in the
compromise settlement arrived in the suit filed by the appellant
against the insurance company for vacating the premises. The
same though measured in terms of arrears of rent was not rent
at all. It was only damages and mesne profits which cannot be
taxed being in the nature of capital receipt.

Further, the

arrears of rent cannot be taxed as it was received after the end
of the financial year relevant to the assessment year and the

ITA No. 1184-91/2006

Page 2 of 5

appellant has relied upon a decision of our own High Court in
the case of Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Ms Sadhna

Chadha, 270 ITR 534 as well as the decision of Calcutta High
Court in the case of Hamilton & Co. Pvt. Ltd. Vs. CIT, 194
ITR 391.
5.

The Commissioner of Income Tax as well as Income Tax

Appellate Tribunal did not agree with the contentions of the
Appellant and hence the present appeals.
6.

The contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that

the sum of arrears was in the nature of mesne profits and not
arrears of rent and as such the same cannot brought to tax
under the head “income from house property”.

The tribunal

failed to appreciate that rent not relating to the relevant
previous years cannot form part of the annual rent for the
previous year for determining the annual value of the property.
The tribunal also failed to appreciate that Section 25(B) of the
Income Tax Act did not apply to the assessment year under
consideration and the provision being prospective in nature it
could not apply to any earlier assessment year.
7.

On the other hand, it has been argued by learned counsel

for the respondent that the income becomes taxable on the
footing of accrual only after the right of tax payer to the income
ITA No. 1184-91/2006

accrues or arises, and in the case of an agreement which makes
profits receivable at or on the happening of a contingency. In
the present case, by virtue of the agreement between the
parties, the appellant not only acquired right to additional
income, but, in fact, received the arrears of rent during the
financial year 1999-2000 attracting provisions of Section 5(1)(a)
of the Income Tax Act 1961. The insertion of Section 25(B) of
the Act by Finance Act, 2000 is more clarificatory in nature. It
only clarifies the position that if any arrears of rent are received
in a subsequent year, the same will be taxed in the year of
receipt.

It is also contended that the case of CIT Vs. Ms.

Sadhna Chadha (supra), in fact, support the case of the
Department and not that of the appellant.
8.

Appellant has placed on record copy of order dated

23.8.99 passed by learned Additional District Judge, Delhi in the
suit filed by him against his tenant as well as application under
Order 23 Rule 1 C.P.C. According to it, it was agreed that the
tenant shall pay rent as well as arrears of rent to the appellant.
So, this plea of the appellant that it was “damages and mesne
profit” and not `rent' is thus unfounded.
9.

Since, these are arrears of rent, it would attract the

provision of Section 5 (1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
ITA No. 1184-91/2006

Page 4 of 5

10.

As per decision of CIT Vs. Ms. Sadhna Chadha (supra),

the arrears of rent are to be assessed in the year to which they
relate and not in the year of actual receipt.

This judgment

nowhere lays down that the arrears of rent are not taxable at
all.
11.

The above being the position, no fault can be found with

the view taken by the appellate authorities below.

Thus, the

order of Tribunal does not give rise to a question of law, much
less a substantial question of law, to fall within the limited
purview of Section 260-A of the Income Tax Act, which is
confined to entertaining only such appeals against the order
which involves a substantial question of law.
12.

Accordingly, present appeals are hereby dismissed.
