CS (OS) 1396/2001

3 of 13

Branch, opened letters of credit, favouring a foreign supplier of cans M/s. Emirates
Can Company Ltd., Jebel AW Free Zone, Dubai, it also had placed orders for
importing aluminium cans with easy open ends (330 ml) of a quantity of 14,78,200
sets through Invoice No.5750, dated 25.5.98 shipped under Bill of Lading NSAUFGO71-JJJ N001, dated 25.5.98 to value of Rs.49,07,624/-. It is averred that the Firm
transferred the title to said goods under High seas Sales Contract, to the defendant
which was confirmed by the letter under its letter dated 8.6.98. The defendant had
agreed for payment of a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- towards charges for transfer of the
Import licence over and above the value of the goods imported, namely
Rs.49,07,624/-. The goods were landed, cleared and stored in the defendant’s
godown in its factory premises, according to the terms and conditions of the MOU.
5.

It is averred that though the defendant agreed not to utilize the

materials/goods imported, without the permission and consent of the Firm and
without making payment on supplying beer (for the equivalent value), it
unauthorizedly and illegally utilized the goods and raw materials. Neither was
payment made, nor was any the equivalent quantity of beer supplied to the firm.
6.

The firm as C & F Agent for the defendant in the State of Andhra Pradesh,

had applied for and obtained all licenses required market the beer in that state in
its (defendants) name. The latter had sent only nine truck loads containing a
quantity of 2,16,000 cans of beer which was supplied by the firm to the Andhra
Pradesh Bewerages Corporation Ltd. However, a portion of payments for such
supplies was received by the defendant itself and the remaining portion, payable by
APBCL was attached by M/s. EICHER Span Financial Services Ltd., (in C.S.
No.519/97 on the file of the Madras High Court) against the defendant; the said
amount was also appropriated by that company. There was no repayment either in
the form of cash or in the form of goods by the defendant to the firm. But at the same
CS (OS) 1396/2001

time, the entire materials imported were illegally used or consumed by the
defendant.
7.

The plaintiff avers that apart from the aforesaid transfer of the cans, the firm

had also opened an inland letter of credit for the purchase of shrink film/malt which
was also required as raw material for the manufacture of beer. Orders were placed
with M/s. Compac Systems for supply of 2000 Kgs. of shrink film and with M/s.
Barmalt India Ltd., for 60 mts of malt. Payment was made for such material by the
Firm through letter of credit. Those materials were given by the firm to the
defendant for the manufacture of beer, in terms of the MOU. The materials were
also used by the defendant without the consent or permission of the firm and
without effecting supply for the said value as agreed. Accordingly the plaintiff bases
its claims in the present suit. The amounts claimed towards aluminium cans are as

The defendant’s case, in its written statement, is one of general denial. It

avers that the general terms as contained in Para 7 the MOU stipulated that it is
under the obligation to supply a minimum of 25000 cases per month from 15th April,
CS (OS) 1396/2001

6 of 13

1998. In order to meet this obligation, the defendant took the necessary steps to
enhance the production capacity of its plant. It invested a huge amount of money on
account of enhancing the capacity. However, the plaintiff was to get the necessary
permits for sale of beer in its state. The defendant had also entered into another
agreement dated 30th May, 1998 with the Plaintiff where it was agreed that it would
receive the aluminium cans imported by the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant and
would be sent to their factory for storage and bonding in their factory premises for
the plaintiff under its charge and hypothecation, after customs clearance, to be
supplied to Andhra Pradesh Corporation. It is alleged that the plaintiff defaulted in
this regard and the defendant cannot be found fault with.
10.

The defendant avers that the plaintiff is under an obligation to pay damages

to the defendant for its negligence. It avers that the calculation made by the plaintiff
for recovery against the defendant is baseless and has no sanctity in the eyes of law.
Due to the acts of omission and commission of the plaintiff, the defendant suffered
huge losses. The defendant denies that it was ever evasive and did not fulfil its
obligations under the MOU, after utilizing the materials made available to it. It
submits that in terms of the agreement signed between the plaintiff and the
defendant as on 28.03.1998 the forever was obliged to arrange permits for APBCL,
to remit excise duty amounts and import fees to the State Government.
11.

The defendant alleges that the plaintiff failed to arrange required permits for

the supply of beer causing thereby serious loss to it. Further according to Clause 9 of
part –1 of the MOU the plaintiff had to maintain an office at Hyderabad and to
appoint Sales Manager/Representative and other staff required but plaintiff failed to
do so against its market. It was further agreed that the materials would be taken out
only on condition that the defendant would fill those cans with Stroh’s beer and
deliver the cans to the plaintiff for distribution within the territory of Andhra

CS (OS) 1396/2001

7 of 13

Pradesh. It was also agreed that the defendant was not to sell or deliver the said
sealed cans of Stroh’s beer to a third party without prior permission from the
plaintiff in writing except Andhra Pradesh Market. The plaintiff failed in all its
obligations stipulated in the said agreement thereby causing severe loss to the
defendant and instead of admitting their fault, the plaintiff

chose to demand

erroneous amounts which is inadmissible. The plaintiff had to procure permits for
the supply of beer within the territory of Andhra Pradesh but it could not arrange
for those permits; it never informed the defendant about its inability to do so. The
plaintiff did not take care to make arrangements in view of the fact that the goods
imported by it on behalf of the defendant for manufacture of beer, had limited shelf
life, in spite of their knowledge that if the goods were not consumed within the
period, it would become useless.
12.

The defendant, which was initially represented and had filed its written

statement, later defaulted in the prosecution of its case. It was consequently, set
down ex-parte by the court, on 4-1-2008. The court noted, on that date, that the
defendant was unrepresented on four previous dates, i.e 27-8-2007, 24-9-2007, 410-2007 and 1-11-2007.
13.

The plaintiff filed affidavit through evidence of its Manager, R. Sam Raj Daniel,

who deposed to being authorized to sign and verify the affidavit and other
documents through a Board resolution dated 21st January 2008 of the Plaintiff
Company, marked as Ex. PW1/1. PW-1 verified that Shri Albert Chakkaravarthy S/o
Mr. S. Albert one of the directors of the Plaintiff Company had signed the plaint
before him; it was identified at Point A, of Ex. PW 3/2. The witness deposed that the
Plaintiff was incorporated on 16.11.1998 with the Registrar of Companies, Tamil
Nadu, and had taken over the entire business, assets and liabilities of the Firm. The
Certificate of Incorporation of the Plaintiff Company was exhibited as Ex. PW1/2.

CS (OS) 1396/2001

8 of 13

The Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of the Plaintiff
Company were exhibited as Ex. PW1/3. He also deposed about being personally
acquainted with the facts.
14.

According to PW-1, the Defendant was engaged in the business of

manufacturing beer under the brand name ‘STROHS’, for which it needed finance.
The Defendant approached the firm, which was its cost and freight agent for the
territory of Andhra Pradesh, for the purpose of obtaining such finance and the firm
agreed to provide it subject to certain terms and conditions. The MOU dated
22.05.1998 was accordingly executed; it was marked in evidence as Ex. PW1/4. In
terms of the said document, the Firm was to open letters of Credit to the maximum
sum of Rs.1.5 crore for and on account of the defendant in favour of suppliers of raw
materials to the Defendant, to be used for production at its factory. The firm was to
have exclusive charge, control and possession of the raw materials and they could
not to be used for any purpose other than manufacture of beer at the Defendant’s
factory. The witness also deposed about the conditions in the agreement, and the
defendant, in its terms having issued issued two Powers of Attorney in favour of the
Firm which were received by the Firm; they were exhibited as Ex. PW 1/5.
15.

The witness also deposed that the Firm had opened Letters of Credit from

M/s. Bank of Ceylon, Chennai Branch, in favour of a foreign supplier of cans M/s.
Emirates Can Company Ltd., Jebel AW Free Zone, Dubai, and the Firm had placed
orders for importing 14, 78, 200 sets of aluminium cans withy easy open ends (and
capacity of 330 ml). These were purchased under invoice No.5750 dated
25.05.1998, and were shipped under Bill of Lading NSAUFGO-71-JJJ N001, dated
25.05.1998 at a value of Rs.51,70,820/-. They were paid for by the Firm through its
letter of credit. The original Bank receipts were exhibited as Ex. PW1/7
(Collectively). The Firm had then entered into a High Seas Sales Contract with the

CS (OS) 1396/2001

9 of 13

Defendant for the sale of the above mentioned aluminium cans to it. The High Seas
Sales Contract was sought to be exhibited as Ex. PW1/8; however, it could not be
marked, since its original was not produced. The witness deposed that Defendant
was bound to make payment for the sale of cans to it. In addition, the Defendant was
bound to pay a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- towards charges for the transfer of the import
licence effected by the firm. These liabilities were sought to be established through
the defendant’s letter to the firm, dated 08.06.1998, exhibited as Ex. PW1/9. A
hypothecation agreement dated 30th May 1998 was also entered into between the
Defendant and the Firm; it was marked as Ex. PW1/10.
16.

According to PW-1, on landing, the cans were stored at the godown

earmarked for the Firm, in the defendant’s factory premises, in terms of the
agreement. Yet, in violation of the agreed terms of the MOU and the hypothecation
agreement, the Defendant utilized the goods without either the consent of the Firm,
or making any payment to it, or supplying equivalent amount of beer. PW-1 also
stated that in addition, in its capacity as C & F Agent of the Defendant for the
territory of State of Andhra Pradesh, the firm had obtained licenses for the
marketing of the Defendant’s beer in that State. Nine truck loads of beer containing
2,16,000 cans were supplied by the Firm to the Andhra Pradesh Beverages
Corporation Ltd., but a portion of the payment for such supplies was received by the
Defendant and the remaining portion payable by APBCL was attached by M/s.
BICHER Span Financial Services Ltd., in C.S. No. 519/1997 in the High Court of
Madras, and was appropriated by the APBCL. Thus, the firm received no payment
for services rendered by it.
17.

PW-1 deposed that the Firm had opened an inland Letter of Credit for the

purchase of shrink film/ malt (raw materials in the manufacture of beer). An order
was placed by the Defendant on M/s Compac Systems for the supply of 2000 Kg. Of

CS (OS) 1396/2001

10 of 13

shrink film and another order was placed by it on M/s. Bar Malt India Ltd., for 60
mts of malt, and payment was made by the Firm through its letter of Credit. The
original Bank receipts in this regard were marked as Ex. PW1/11. However, these
materials were also wrongly utilized by the Defendant without the Firm’s
permission and without any payment to it. He deposed that despite repeated
requests and reminders from the firm, the Defendant failed to make payment in
respect of its liabilities towards the firm in relation to the supply of 14,78,200
aluminium cans, sale of 2,16,000 cans to APBCL and the supply of shrink film dated
04.10.2000 and five debit notes raised on the Defendant by the Firm, in respect of its
liability towards supply of shrink film/malt. The debit notes were exhibited as Ex.
PW1/12, Ex.PW1/13, Ex. PW1/14, Ex. PW 1/15, Ex. PW1/16, Ex. PW1/17, Ex.
PW1/18. PW-1 exhibited, a letter dated 30.09.1999 and a letter dated 04.10.2000
along with five debit notes raised on the Defendant by the firm, in respect of its
liability towards supply of aluminium cans as Ex. PW1/19, Ex. PW1/20, Ex. PW1/21,
Ex. PW1/22, Ex. PW1/23, Ex. PW1/24, Ex. PW1/25.
18.

According to PW-1, a letter dated 04.12.1999 was also sent to the defendant

by the Firm demanding payment for its various liabilities but instead a response
was received vide letter of the defendant dated 14.12.1999 denying its liability on
untenable grounds. A copy of the letter dated 14.12.1999 was exhibited as Ex.
PW1/26. A legal notice dated 01.06.2000 was then sent to the Defendant by the
Firm, demanding payment towards supply of aluminium cans to it, which is
exhibited as Ex. PW1/27.
19.

The above factual narrative shows that the plaintiff’s claims for the sum of Rs.

1,27,57,362/- are divided into two parts; one concerns the amounts payable by the
defendant towards the credit extended for importing cans. This is premised on the
basic sum of Rs.51,70,820.00. To this, the plaintiff has added L/C Opening Charges/

CS (OS) 1396/2001

11 of 13

amendment charges etc. being Rs. 36,408,00 to arrive at the figure of
Rs.52,07,228.00. It has then claimed service charges at 10% which is
Rs. 5,20,722.00, leading to a figure of Rs. 57,27,590.00. It thereafter claims special
import license charges at the rate of 6.5% on Rs.50,00,000/-, i.e. Rs. 3,25,000.00;
special import license charges for Rs.90,00,000/- at 3.20%, working out to Rs.
2,79,000.00 and claims an overall interest from 1.9.98 to 30.9.99 at 18% p.a
( Rs.13,17,092.00). The grand total on this head of claims is thus worked out at Rs.
76,49,042.00 (Rupees seventy six lakhs, forty nine thousand, and forty two only).
The plaintiff has been able to establish that Rs. 51,70,820 was credited under advice
of the Bank of Ceylon; it has relied upon Ex. PW-1/7. However, the claims as far as
service charges at 10%, and special import license for Rs. 50,00,000/- and Rs.
90,00,000/- have not been established through any documentary or credible
evidence. The agreement between parties does not mention that the plaintiff was
entitled to charge such 10% amount. Its claim for a percentage of the value of
import, as import license fees could have been sustained, if some materials had been
disclosed to the court, that such sums were actually paid, or incurred. As far as Rs.
36,408/- being bank charges for the letter of credit are concerned, although no
account is shown, yet the amounts can be accepted as a reasonable expense for the
credit made available to the defendant. The plaintiff has therefore, been able to
establish its entitlement to Rs. Rs.52,07,228/-.
20.

As regards the other heads of claim, the plaintiff has shown the value of 2000

kgs. of shrink film supplied by M/s. Compac Systems as Rs. 1,66,324/-; this too is
part of Ex.PW-1/7. The L/C opening charges/amendment charges/Bank
commission/Insurance on this head is Rs. 8,522/-. Similarly, the value of 60 MTS of
malt supplied by M/s. Marmalt India Ltd. is Rs. 8,07,803/-. The L/C opening charges
on this head are Rs.4,4791/-. The total of these amounts claimed is Rs. 9,87,440/-.

CS (OS) 1396/2001

12 of 13

The plaintiff has proved this through Ex.PW-1/7. However, other amounts such as
10% service charges; Rs. 5,00,000/- paid to APBCL towards Earnest Money Deposit
on behalf of the Defendant; Label Registration fees paid to APBCL on behalf of the
defendant, (Rs. 50,000/-) and the sum of Rs. 24,000/- paid to the defendant’s
representative, Mr. Kannan are unsupported by any evidence.

21.

From the above discussion, it is apparent that the plaintiff has proved its case,

to the extent of Rs. 61, 94,628/- (Rupees sixty one lakhs, ninety four thousand six
hundred and twenty eight only). The defendant has not denied the nature of
transaction, or even that the amounts were spent for its purpose, by the plaintiff. Its
defense is to level unspecific general allegations against the plaintiff, in the
performance of the other contract. That contract has not been placed on record. The
defendant does not show how its terms were interrelated with the conditions spelt
out in the MOU or the other arrangements, brought on record by the plaintiff. There
is no doubt that the transaction between the parties was a commercial one. The
plaintiff’s amounts were blocked, and the defendant has made no attempt to return
them all these years. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to 15% interest on the said
amounts.
22.

The plaintiff is therefore entitled to succeed against the defendant, to the

extent of Rs. 61, 94,628/- (Rupees sixty one lakhs, ninety four thousand six hundred
and twenty eight only). The defendant, in addition, is liable to pay pendente lite and
future interest @ 15% on the said amount, till its realization.
23.

The suit is accordingly decreed in favour of the plaintiff, in the above terms,

against the defendant, with costs. Advocate’s fee is quantified at Rs. 30,000/-.
