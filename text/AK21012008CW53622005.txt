1.

This is an application filed by the respondent no.1/workman

under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking
direction to the petitioner to pay full back wages last drawn by the
respondent no.1 or the minimum wages whichever is higher from the
date of the award to the applicant/respondent no.1 during the

CM No.15166/2005 in W.P(C) No.5362/2005

Page 1 of 6

pendency of the writ petition.
2.

The respondent no.1/applicant contended that he has not been

in employment anywhere since termination of his services nor he has
been working in any establishment since the date of his termination
and that he has been facing acute financial hardship. In the
circumstances the applicant has prayed for payment of full back
wages last drawn by him with effect from the date of award that is 2nd
September, 2004.
3.

A reply has been filed on behalf of petitioner/non applicant

contending that as the award passed in favor of the respondent no.1
is unsustainable and that the operation of the same has been stayed
by this court, thus, the application of the respondent no.1 under
section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is not maintainable
and the relief prayed therein cannot be granted. The petitioner has
also denied the factum of unemployment of the respondent no.1. The
petitioner

also

contended

that

the

respondent

no.1

was

not

terminated/dismissed from the services in fact the appointment was
contractual one and came to an end on the expiry of the said date and
thus the applicant is not entitled to any relief under section 17B of
the Industrial Disputes Act.
4.

It is no more res integra that the provisions of Section 17 B of

the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 comes into operation when an
CM No.15166/2005 in W.P(C) No.5362/2005

Page 2 of 6

Award directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further
proceedings. The statute requires satisfaction of the following four
conditions:
(i)

(ii)
(iii)

(iv)

5.

an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in proceedings in a High Court or the
Supreme Court;
during the pendency of such proceedings, employer
is required to pay full wages to the workman;
the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any
maintenance allowance admissible to him under
any Rule;
such wages would be admissible only if the
workman had not been employed in any
establishment during such period and an affidavit
had been filed to such effect

While considering an application under this provision it is

necessary to bear in mind that the spirit, intendment and object
underlying the statutory provision of Section 17B is to mitigate and
relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship resulting to a workman due
to delay in the implementation of an award directing reinstatement of
his services on account of the challenge made to it by the employer.
The preliminary consideration for making available such a relief to a
workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment.
It recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body
and soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award
directing his reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial

CM No.15166/2005 in W.P(C) No.5362/2005

Page 3 of 6

adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment which is required to be
made by the employer to the workman has been held to be akin to a
subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor recoverable
from a workman even if the Award in his favor is set aside by the High
Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T.
Patel the Apex Court was of the view that the object under Section
17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain
extent, the hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay
in implementation of the Award.
6.

While considering an application under Section 17B of the

Industrial Disputes Act, the Court cannot go into the merits of the
case in the writ petition. It was so held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5)
AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.

7.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 entitled Town Municipal, Athani v.
P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman
has a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and
cannot be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum
Wages Act for enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was
concerned with the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the
Court would have a bearing on the issues raised before this Court as
CM No.15166/2005 in W.P(C) No.5362/2005

Page 4 of 6

well. From a conspectus of the authoritative pronouncements of the
Apex Court, the right of a workman to an amount equivalent to the
wages notified under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact,
recognition of the constitutional mandate and nothing more. It is
undoubtedly, the bare minimum which is required by the workman to
subsist and is nothing more. Full wages last drawn can therefore only
mean all the wages that have fallen due atleast from the date of the
Award.
8.

This also cannot be disputed that granting relief under Section

17B of the Act and passing orders directing payment of wages last
drawn, is generally the rule; refusing to grant relief under Section 17B
is an exception, as it could be passed only in the rarest of the rare
cases of jurisdictional error where there is no relationship between the
parties.
9.

In the present case the applicant has contended that he is not

employed in any establishment since the date of termination of his
services. The petitioner apart from bald denial of the same has not
disclosed any material facts to show that the applicant is gainfully
employed and that he is not entitled for last drawn back wages from
the date of the award. In the facts and circumstances, the applicant
fulfills the criteria for availing the benefit under section 17B of the Act
and in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, if the

CM No.15166/2005 in W.P(C) No.5362/2005

Page 5 of 6

requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are
satisfied, order cannot be denied to the workman granting benefit
under the statutory provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947.
10.

Consequently, the application of the workman/respondent no.1

under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is allowed and
the petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or the minimum
wages whichever is higher from the date of the award dated 2nd
September, 2004 to the respondent/workman. The arrears of the last
drawn wages or the minimum wages, whichever is higher, be paid
within eight weeks.

The last drawn wages or the minimum wages in

future be paid on 10th day of every month. However, if the writ petition
is subsequently

allowed

and it is held

that the

respondent

no.1/applicant is not entitled for minimum wages, the respondent
no.1 shall refund the difference of the last drawn wages and the
minimum wages within such time as shall be allowed by this Court.
