1.

This petition has been filed by the petitioner under Section 11

of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking appointment of
an independent arbitrator in accordance with law.
2.

The petitioner has asserted that its tender the work named

â€œReplacement of overhead water storage tank at RPJ and CDG
Arb.P. 335/2005

page 1 of 9

stations and tube wells at CDG Stations was accepted by the
competent authority of the respondent subject to terms and
conditions as embodied in the tender conditions for the work,
general conditions of the contract, regulation and instructions to
the tenderer and those contained in the standard form of contract,
1999 Ed and N.R. Engineering Department

SOR 1996

Ed.(Corrected up to date) vide a letter dated 16th February, 2004
from the respondent.

The contract was for the total value of

Rs.31,42,238/- while the expected date of completion of the work
was 15th July, 2004. The petitioner deposited a sum of Rs.31,500/vide a fixed deposit receipt dated 15th December, 2003 at the time
of submission of the tender towards the earnest money.
3.

The petitioner has contended that despite arranging required

shuttering material, labour and soil testing teams etc, the
respondent failed to provide site plans, drawings, details of the
work despite repeated requests, details of the site were also not
provided and it was rendered impossible for the petitioner to start
the work.

Despite such conditions, the respondent illegally

terminated the contract on 6th December, 2004 and floated a fresh

tender at the risk and cost of the petitioner despite its protest. In
these circumstances, the petitioner has contended that the
contract was illegally terminated and floating of the fresh tender
was also unwarranted and illegal resulting in huge losses to the
petitioner and disputes and claims between the parties.
petitioner consequently

The

invoked the arbitration agreement

contained in clause 64 of the General Conditions of contract which
governed the parties. By a legal notice dated 5th December, 2005
the petitioner requested the claims of the petitioner which were
mentioned therein to be referred to arbitration in terms thereof.
4.

The respondent failed to appoint an arbitrator within the

period of 30 days as statutorily envisaged.

Consequently, the

petitioner filed the present petition under Section 11 of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, on the 20th October, 2005 seeking
appointment of an arbitrator. This petition was originally filed
before the Court of The District Judge.

However, on the

pronouncement of the law by the Apex Court in SBP & Co. v.
Patel Engineering Limited (2005) 8 SCC 618, this petition
was transferred to this court.
Arb.P. 335/2005

5.

The respondents have appeared in answer to the petition and

contested the matter. The respondents have contested the claim of
the petitioner on the merits of the matter and have attributed fault
for failure to start the work and completing the contract upon the
petitioner. Apart from this contention on merits, the respondents
have placed before this court a letter dated 21st February, 2006
whereby according to the respondents, in terms of clause 64 of the
General Conditions of Contract, the General Manager, Northern
Railway has appointed Shri Surya Prakash, Deputy Chief
Engineer/Construction/PTG, Northern Raiwlay, Kashmiri Gate,
Delhi as a sole arbitrator to decide upon the disputes. On these
pleas, the respondents have sought dismissal of the present
petition.
6.

Having heard learned counsels for the parties and having

perused the available record, I find that there is no dispute so far
as the existence of a valid and binding arbitration agreement is
concerned. The respondents have themselves acted thereunder
and appointed an arbitrator vide the letter dated 21st February,
2006. There is also no disputes that disputes have arisen between
Arb.P. 335/2005

page 4 of 9

the parties and they are respectively apportioning fault to each
other. There is no submission on behalf of the respondent that the
disputes which have been raised by the petitioner are not covered
within the purview the arbitration agreement between the parities
contained in clause 64 of the General Conditions of Contract.
There is thus no impediment tot he exercise of jurisdiction by this
court under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 which would be clearly in consonance with the applicable
principles laid down by the Apex Court in SBP & Co. v. Patel
Engineering Limited (2005) 8 SCC 618 (supra).
7.

However, the fact remains that by a letter dated 21st

February, 2006, the respondents have appointed an arbitrator.
This appointment is beyond the period of 30 days statutorily
permitted and has been effected after the petitioner has filed the
petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration & Conciliation act,
1996. Such appointment, would be in the teeth of the statutorily
provisions and the principles laid down in several judicial
pronouncements.
8.

In this behalf, reference can be usefully made to the

Arb.P. 335/2005

page 5 of 9

pronouncement of the Apex Court reported in (2006) 2 SCC
638 Punj Lloyd Ltd. Vs. Petronet MHB Ltd. and the
pronouncement of this court reported at 137 (2007) DLT 47
Gurdeep Singh Vs. NDMC.
9.

In (2006) 2 SCC 638 Punj Lloyd Ltd. Vs. Petronet

MHB Ltd., the Apex Court had placed reliance on its earlier
pronouncement reported at (2000) 8 SCC 151 Datar
Switchgears Ltd. Vs. Tata Finance Ltd. and held that upon
failure to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days of the demand, the
right to appointment would not get automatically forfeited even
after 30 days, if the opposite party makes an appointment after 30
days of demand, but before the first party had moved the court
under Section 11. This would sufficiently meet the legal
requirements of an appointment under Section 11 (6). However, if
no appointment is made even till such time as the first party
moves the court under Section 11, the opposite party would forfeit
its right to make the appointment.
10.

On these principles, this court in its pronouncement

reported at 137 (2007) DLT 47 Gurdeep Singh Vs. NDMC
Arb.P. 335/2005

page 6 of 9

held that the respondent would lose its right to appoint an
arbitrator if it had not so appointed till this period. In this view of
the matter, the present petition has to be allowed.
11.

Therefore the appointment of the sole arbitrator by the

communication dated 21st February, 2006 is contrary to law.
12.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted before this

court that the petitioner has no objection if this court refers all
disputes raised by him to the arbitrator appointed by the
respondents. It is pointed out by the communication dated 21st
February, 2006, the respondent has only referred the claim of the
petitioner/contractor with regard to refund of the earnest money
which was deposited and none of the other claims which have been
detailed in the legal notice dated 5th September, 2005. Perusal of
the communication shows that this position is correct. The denial
on the part of the respondent to these claims of the petitioner is
not based on any averment that the same are contrary to any
statutory provision or that they are not covered under the
arbitration agreement between the parties. The challenge is based
on pleas on merit that the petitioner was responsible for the delays
Arb.P. 335/2005

page 7 of 9

and therefore is not entitled to any of the amounts claimed.
In my view, consideration of such pleas is wholly within the
jurisdiction of the arbitrator having regard to the spirit,
intendment and purpose of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,
1996 and the well settled principles in the several judicial
pronouncements especially the principles laid down by the Apex
Court in SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering Limited (2005) 8
SCC 618 (supra).
In this view of the matter, this petition is allowed. I hereby
appoint Shri Surya Prakash, Deputy Chief Engineer/Const./PLG,
N.R., Kashmiri Gate, Delhi as a sole arbitrator to arbitrate upon
the disputes raised by the petitioner in its legal notice dated 5th
September, 2005. The respondent shall also be at liberty to make
such counter claim which shall also be examined by the arbitrator
who shall give his award on the respective claims and counter
claims of the parties.
The petition is allowed in the above terms.
