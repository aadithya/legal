IA No.9243/2007

1.

This application has been filed by the plaintiff under Order 39

Rule 1 & 2 CPC seeking an injunction that the defendants be restrained
from parting with possession of immovable property No. F-24/4, Okhla
Industrial Area, Phase-II, New Delhi or any portion thereof during the
pendency of the suit and also seeking an injunction against altering,
varying or changing the shareholding pattern of defendant no.1 company
during pendency of the suit.
2.

Plaintiff and defendant no.2 are real sisters. Defendant no. 3

is mother of the plaintiff and the defendant no.2. Defendant no. 1 is a
company in which plaintiff and defendant no. 2 both have shares. Plaintiff
has claimed that she was carrying on the business of export of garments
under the name of 'Indian Summer'. This was her sole proprietorship firm
in 1989. Defendant no. 1 company was incorporated in December, 1986
with paid-up share capital of Rs.2,000/- and got engaged in business of
manufacturing and export of readymade garments. She and her sister
Smt. Uma Khosla were the initial shareholders.

The authorized share

capital of the company was increased to 5,25,000/- in 1989 and apart

IA No.9243/2007 in CS(OS) No.1481/07

Page 1 of 7

from the 2 sisters 3 more shareholders namely, Captain R.K. Khosla, Smt.
S.V. Khosla and Sh. H.M. Khosla held its shares. The shareholding changed
from time to time. On 17th December, 1998, Sh. H.M. Khosla, father of the
plaintiff died. She claimed that he died intestate.

However, defendant

no.2 in her reply claimed that he left behind a ‘Will’. At the time of his
death, Sh.H.M. khosla was having 3200 shares in defendant no. 1
company. It is stated by the plaintiff that her sister, defendant no. 2
approached her and proposed a re-arrangement of the affairs of 'Indian
Summer' and defendant no. 1 company, so that the businesses of two
concerns could be conducted together and in tandem. This proposal was
made in presence of other family members and it was proposed that
'Indian Summer' be converted into a partnership firm and defendant no. 2
should be inducted as a partner with 50-50 ratio and in consideration of
the same, the defendant no. 2 stated that the shares in defendant no.1
company would stand transferred between the family members in such a
manner that the shareholding of plaintiff/her nominees on one hand and
defendant no.2 on the other hand would ultimately be in the ratio of 5050. Defendant no. 2 proposed that in order to make this transaction
effective, plaintiff should pay certain sum of money to defendant no.1
company and defendant no.2 so that the share of parties be equalized and
the other shareholders and legal heirs of Sh.H.M. Khosla be duly
compensated by defendant no. 2 for relinquishing and giving up their
claims. According to plaintiff, this agreement was oral and she bonafidly
acted on it. Plaintiff claimed that in view of agreement she transferred
Rs.85 lacs from her personal account to the personal account of defendant
no. 2 so that the defendant no. 2 may contribute to the capital of 'Indian
Summer' under her capital account and become a partner to the extent of
50-50. Plaintiff further transferred from her personal account a sum of
Rs.40 lacs and 65 lacs into the personal account of defendant no. 2 which
was again inducted as capital into the account of partnership firm of
'Indian Summer' by defendant no. 2 and these payments were made with

IA No.9243/2007 in CS(OS) No.1481/07

Page 2 of 7

a view to ensure that capital contribution in proposed partnership firm
should be 50-50.
3.

It is also stated that after the understanding arrived at

between the plaintiff and defendant no. 2, defendant no. 1 company
commenced work of extension and construction of the office and factory
building at F-24/4, Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-II, New Delhi in the year
2000 and 'Indian Summer' contributed a sum of Rs. 68,56,000/- to this
reconstruction of the building of defendant no.1 company. 'Indian
Summer' was a tenant in the building and this tenancy was extended from
time to time. It is stated that the plaintiff performed all the actions

in

terms of agreement and inducted defendant no. 2 as an equal partner, but
defendant no. 2 avoided, on one pretext or the other, to honour her part
of understanding and effect the transfer of shares required for making the
plaintiff a 50 per cent shareholder in defendant no. 1 company. The
plaintiff learnt in the year 2004 from the Chartered Accountant of the
defendant no. 1 company that defendant no. 2 had surreptitiously
transferred,unto herself, 3200 shares standing in the name of Late
H.M.Khosla, without any intimation to the plaintiff.
It is submitted that defendant no. 2 and 3 were the directors
of the defendant no. 1 company along with the plaintiff but defendant no.
2 and 3 took undue advantage of being majority directors and passed
certain resolutions by completing the quorum of Board meetings, behind
the back of the plaintiff. The transfer of 3200 shares belonging to Late
H.M.Khosla in the name of defendant no. 2 was illegal. However, the
plaintiff reminded defendant no 2 of the understanding and defendant no.
2 agreed to re-transfer such number of shares to the plaintiff which would
enable the plaintiff to hold the 50 per cent of shareholding in the
defendant no. 1 company. Defendant no.2 unjustly demanded a further
sum of Rs.19 lacs to effect the said transfer in favour of the plaintiff and
since plaintiff had already invested a huge amount towards fulfillment of
agreement, she agreed to pay this sum of Rs.19 lacs. The plaintiff paid

IA No.9243/2007 in CS(OS) No.1481/07

Page 3 of 7

this amount vide cheque no.00418749 drawn on State Bank of Mysore,
Nehru Place Branch on 20.8.2004 and asked defendant no. 2 to do the
needful.
4.

Defendant no. 2 executed a receipt-cum-agreement on

20.8.2004 agreeing thereby to transfer 2000 shares out of shares held by
her in the name of the plaintiff. It is stated that this agreement was
witnessed by one of the sisters and a family friend. However, despite
executing agreement for transfer of shares, defendant no. 2 did not fulfill
this agreement. In March, 2007, plaintiff again approached the defendant
no. 2 for transfer of the 2000 shares in accordance with receipt-cumagreement dated 20th August, 2004 but to no effect. Plaintiff thus filed
this suit seeking specific performance of the agreement dated 20th
August, 2004 and seeking an injunction against the defendant for
transferring 2000 shares in the name of the plaintiff.
5.

The version put forward by the plaintiff has been denied by

the defendant. It is submitted that while plaintiff was holding 3000 shares,
Late H.M.Khosla was holding 3200 shares and defendant no. 3 was holding
800 shares in 1998. Even if the father had died intestate, the shares of
father would have gone by inheritance to all the legal heirs and defendant
no. 2 could not have promised to transfer the shares of father to the
plaintiff. Moreover, defendant no. 3 was also having shares in the
company. Defendant no. 2 could not have made any promise on behalf of
the defendant no. 3 that she would give up her shares in favour of
anyone. It is further submitted by the defendant’s counsel that the
agreement which is sought to be relied upon by the plaintiff is stated to
have been arrived at in 1998 after death of the father. The receipt-cumagreement dated 20th August, 2004 is, in fact, only an acknowledgment of
the family agreement which was earlier arrived at. Unless the terms and
conditions of earlier agreement arrived at between the parties are known,
the receipt-cum-agreement dated 20th August, 2004 has no value. The

IA No.9243/2007 in CS(OS) No.1481/07

Page 4 of 7

receipt-cum-agreement dated 20th August, 2004 reads as under :“Indian Summer

factory : f-24/4, okhla phase-II,
new delhi-110020

dated............................
As per our family agreement received final payment of 19
lacs from Mrs. Ramma Sahni vide cheque no.00418749
dated 20.08.2004 drawn from State Bank of Mysore,
Nehru Place Branch, New Delhi- 19 for the transfer of
2,000 equity shares of Digit Exports Pvt. Ltd. held by me.
Thus the share holding will be as under:1. Ms. Uma Khosla – 4200 shares
2. Mrs. S.V. Khosla – 800 shares
3. Mrs. Ramma Sahni – 5000 shares
Ms. Uma Khosla
6.

Mrs. Ramma Shani”

It is argued that this receipt-cum-agreement is executed by

Smt. Uma Khosla and Rama Shani whereas if it had been a receipt-cumagreement, it should have only been signed by Smt. Uma Khosla since she
was the recipient of the cheque and she was to transfer 2000 equity
shares.

A receipt is signed by the person who receives the money.

Receipt is not signed by the person who pays the money.
7.

Defendant has denied entering into any such agreement and

stated that since she was partner of the Indian Summer, her signed
letterheads had been used by the plaintiff to forge the agreement.
8.

There is no denial of the fact by the defendant that huge

amounts/funds moved from plaintiff’s account to the defendant no. 2’s
personal account after 1998 and defendant no. 2 was inducted as a
partner in 'Indian Summer' to the extent of 50%. In fact, defendant’s
counsel himself relied upon the documents filed by the plaintiff to plead
that these were gifts as shown by the Chartered Accountant in the Income
Tax Return. I am informed by plaintiff’s counsel that the Income Tax
Returns of defendant no. 2 came under security of ITO, and these gifts
were later on shown as loan by defendant no.2.

9.

Defendant no.2 has failed to explain as to why huge amounts

as pleaded were transferred by plaintiff to defendant no. 2, without any
consideration. Both are business women. Plaintiff was running firm 'Indian
Summer' and had transferred above two crores of money into the account
of defendant no. 2 so that the defendant no. 2 may invest the same into
her capital account and become partner of Indian Summer. If there was no
understanding between the parties, no other reason has been given by
the defendant no.2 for this act and alleged magnanimity of the plaintiff.
The stand taken by the defendant no. 2 is that last payment of Rs. 19 lacs
by way of cheque was made by the plaintiff towards the share of the rent
of defendant no. 2 of the premises held by the company. Plaintiff has
placed on record documents showing that the defendant no. 2 had no
separate share in the premises No. F-24/4 Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-II
and the company was the owner of the premises and the building thereon.
It is clear that prima facie defendant no. 2 has no separate share in the
premises no. F-24/4, Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-II. It has also not been
denied that 'Indian Summer' spent huge amount on construction of this
building over the premises.
10.

Considering that more than 2 crores was paid and spent by

plaintiff together to defendant no. 1 company and defendant no. 2 by way
of cheques for construction or given by defendant no. 2, over a number of
years, there seems to be force in the arguments of the plaintiff that
defendant no. 2 had agreed for transferring 2000 shares in the name of
the plaintiff. Plaintiff prima facie has a case against defendants.

The

agreement was arrived at between the parties in the presence of family
members and the agreement dated 20.8.2004 is signed by witnesses. The
evidence of family members is yet to be recorded. The terms of
agreement though not reduced in writing in 1998 but were reduced in
writing in 2004 and signed by defendant no.2 and she agreed for transfer
of her 2000 shares in defendant no. 1 company to plaintiff. The plaintiff
has already created 50 per cent shareholding of defendant No. 2 in the

IA No.9243/2007 in CS(OS) No.1481/07

Page 6 of 7

partnership firm by making payments of huge funds to be invested in firm
to defendant no. 2. Admittedly, defendant no. 2 has not transferred any
shares.
11.

I consider that if during the pendency of the suit, the

plaintiff’s interests are not protected so that the corpus of the suit
remains intact she would suffer irreparable loss. I, therefore, allow the
application under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC to the extent that the
shareholding pattern of defendant no. 1 shall not be changed unilaterally
by defendant no. 2 and other shareholders without leave of the Court and
the Premises no. F-24/4, Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-II, New Delhi or any
portion thereof shall not be alienated or transferred to a third party
without leave of the Court.
Application is allowed in above terms.
