order

dated

23rd

September,

2005

passed

in

ITA

No.2468/Delhi/2002 for the assessment year 1995-96.
2.

We have framed the following substantial question of

law for consideration:-

3.

“Whether the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal was correct in law in upholding
the order of the Commissioner of Income
Tax (Appeals) deleting the addition of
Rs.20 lacs on account of gifts alleged to
have been received by the Assessee?“
Brief facts of the case are that the Assessee in the

present

case

filed

the

Income

Tax

Return

for

the

assessment year 1995-96 on 31st October, 1995 declaring
an income of Rs.1,04,249/-.

This assessment was made

under Section 143(3) of the Act on 2nd March, 1998
accepting

the

declared

income

of

the

Assessee.

Subsequently, this assessment order was examined by
CIT(Central-2), New Delhi under Section 263 of the Act
who set aside the assessment on 2nd August, 1999 with
direction

to

examine

the

identity,

genuineness

and

creditworthiness of two donors.
4.

The Assessee filed a written reply on 5th November,

2001 but the Assessing Officer wanted further details as
well as the attendance of the Assessee. The Assessee did
ITA No. 875/2006

Page 2 of

8

not appear and sought adjournments.

After giving

sufficient opportunities, the Assessing Officer completed
the assessment under Section 144 of the Act. The Assessee
neither appeared personally nor furnished the requisite
information to the Assessing Officer and accordingly,
Assessing Officer completed

the assessment on merits.

The Assessing Officer observed that the Assessee had
received two gifts of Rs.10 lacs each from N.R.E. accounts
of two donors namely Sh.Vinod Kumar Ghai and Sh.David
Paramjit Gill.

The Assessing Officer observed that the

Assessee had filed no evidence to prove the capacity of the
donors for giving these substantial gifts, though the
Assessee in his reply dated 5th November, 2001 had stated
that he has also submitted form of Gift Deeds, affidavits of
two donors, passport of two donors as well as bank
certificates relating to these gifts by means of A/C Payee
cheques from NRE accounts from these two donors.
However, the Assessing Officer was not satisfied with the
reply of the Assessee and observed that the Assessee could
not discharge his onus of proving the creditworthiness of
the donors and held that the amount of Rs.20 lacs which
ITA No. 875/2006

Page 3 of

8

has been declared by the Assessee as gift, was in fact his
income

and same was added to his total income under

Section 68 of the Act.
5.

Aggrieved by the order of the Assessing Officer, the

Assessee filed an appeal before the Commissioner of the
Income Tax (Appeals) who held that these two gifts made
are genuine and as such the addition made was deleted.
6.

Being

dissatisfied

with

the

orders

of

the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), Revenue filed
appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and vide
impugned order the appeal of the Revenue was dismissed.
7.

It has been argued by the learned counsel for the

Revenue that the Assessee failed to furnish financial
capacity and creditworthiness of the donors and there was
no natural love and affection between the Assessee and the
donors. The Assessee did not appear before the Assessing
Officer nor he furnished the requisite information and thus,
the Assessee has failed to discharge its onus and in support
of his contention, the learned counsel cited a decision of
our own High Court reported as Sajan Dass and Sons vs.

Commissioner of Income Tax (2003) 264 ITR 435.
ITA No. 875/2006

8.

On the other hand, it has been argued by learned

counsel for the Assessee that the Assessee duly declared
these two gifts in his capital account at the time of original
assessment and he submitted necessary evidence in the
form of gift deeds, affidavits of donors, copies of the
passport of the two donors and bank certificate confirming
the payment by pay order from the NRE accounts of the
two donors and in support of his contention, learned
counsel cited two decisions of our own High Court,

Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Sunita Vachani
(1990) 184 ITR 121 and Commissioner of Income Tax
vs.R.S.Sibal (2004) 269 ITR 429.
9.

The question to be seen here is as to whether the

identity of donors has been established and whether they
had the capacity to make such a gift or not.

In

Commissioner of Income Tax vs.R.S.Sibbal (supra), it has
been laid down:
“ There is no quarrel with the preposition
that a mere identification of the donor
and showing the movement of the gift
amount through banking channels is not
sufficient to prove the genuineness of the
gift and since the claim of a gift is made
by the assessee the onus lies on him not
ITA No. 875/2006

Page 5 of

8

only to establish the identity of the donor
but his capacity to make such a gift. But,
in the instant case, we find that though
the assessee had admittedly produced the
bank statements, the Assessing Officer
did not raise any query with regard to the
capacity of the donors to make the gift.
From the assessment order, we find that
the only ground on which the genuineness
of the gifts has been doubted is the
alleged failure on the part of the assessee
to establish relationship between the
donor and the donee”
10.

Similarly in Sajan Dass and Sons (supra), it has been

laid down that:
“A mere identification of the donor and
showing the movement of the gift amount
through banking channels is not sufficient to
prove the genuineness of the gift. Since the
claim of gift is made by the assessee, the onus
lies on him not only to establish the identity of
the person making the gift but also his
capacity to make a gift and that it has actually
been received as a gift from the donor.
Having regard to the inquiries conducted by
the Assessing Officer from the bank, with
which the assessee was admittedly confronted
and bearing in mind the fact that admittedly
said Subhash Sethi was not related to the
assessee, we are of the view that the findings
recorded by the Tribunal are pure findings of
fact warranting no interference. We find it
difficult to hold that on the facts of the instant
case proper opportunity had not been granted
to the assessee to prove the gift.”
11.

So, from the aforesaid judgments, the position which

ITA No. 875/2006

Page 6 of

8

emerges is as under:(i)Mere identification
the

movement

of

of donor and showing
gift

amount

through

banking channels is not sufficient to prove
the genuineness of the gift.
(ii)Since the claim of the gift is made by the
Assessee, the onus lies on him not only to
establish the identity of the person making
the gift but also his capacity to make such a
gift.
12.

Here in the present case, there is nothing on record

to show as to what was the financial capacity of the donors;
what was the creditworthiness of the donors; what kind of
relationship the donors had with the Assessee; what are
the sources of funds gifted to the Assessee and whether
they had the capacity of giving large amount of gift to the
Assessee.

Further, the Assessee was asked to appear in

person before the Assessing Officer, however, he never
appeared.
13.

Since, the Assessee did not prove the genuineness of

the transaction nor he established the identity of the donor,
ITA No. 875/2006

Page 7 of

8

nor the capacity of donor to make gift, as such the Income
Tax Appellate Tribunal was wrong in deleting the addition
of Rs.20 lacs on account of gift alleged to have been
received by the Assessee.
14.

Accordingly, the present appeal filed by the Revenue

is accepted and impugned order passed by the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal is set aside.
15.

The substantial question of law is answered in the

negative, in favour of the Revenue and against the
Assessee.
