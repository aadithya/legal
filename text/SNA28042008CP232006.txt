The High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad has already

approved the scheme proposed for the amalgamation of the
transferor company with the transferee company vide its order
dated 29.09.2006 passed in Company Petition No. 62/2006
subject to the approval of the said scheme by the High Court
having jurisdiction over the transferor company.
4

The transferor company has now approached this Court for

sanction of the proposed scheme of its amalgamation with the
transferee company. The proposed scheme of amalgamation has
been filed along with the present petition and the same has been
perused by me.
5

The transferor company had earlier filed an application being

Company Application (M) No. 10/2006 for dispensing with the
requirement of convening and holding of meeting by the equity
COMPANY PETITION NO.23 OF 2006

Page No. 2 Of 7

shareholders, secured and unsecured creditors of the transferor
company. This application was allowed by this Court vide its
order passed on 10.01.2006. The transferor company was
exempted from convening and holding the statutory meetings of
its equity shareholders because they have already given their
consent to the proposed scheme of amalgamation.
6

Vide order passed by this Court on 23.01.2006, notices of

the present petition were directed to be issued to the Official
Liquidator and also to the the Regional Director (Northern Region).
The citation of the present petition was also got published in the
newspapers 'The Statesman' (English edition) and 'Jansata' (Hindi
edition) in terms of Companies (Court) Rules, 1959. An affidavit
dated March 1, 2006 has been filed stating that the publication as
directed was effected on February 22, 2006. The paper cuttings
containing the publication of the said citations were also filed
along with the affidavit.
7

In response to notices issued to the Official Liquidator and to

the Regional Director (Northern Region), they have filed their
separate

reports

in

regard

to

the

proposed

scheme

of

amalgamation. These reports along with the response of the
transferor company thereto have been perused by me. During
arguments, neither the counsel for the official liquidator nor the
counsel for the ROC has opposed the proposed scheme of
COMPANY PETITION NO.23 OF 2006

Page No. 3 Of 7

amalgamation which provides for amalgamation of the transferor
company with the transferee company. However, the proposed
amalgamation has been opposed by an ex-workman Mr. Rajiv Puri
on the ground that the transferor company has not paid his
alleged

admitted

dues

of

Rs.

4,48,040/-.

Mr.

Rajiv

Puri,

ex-workman of the transferor company has opposed the scheme
by filing an application being Co. App. No. 571/2006. The
transferor company in response to the aforesaid application of the
ex-workman has set out the facts and circumstances to show that
there is a bonafide dispute between the company and the
ex-workman regarding payment of his alleged dues. The Court
was appraised that the transferor company has filed a civil suit
against the ex-workman Mr. Rajiv Puri for recovery of certain dues
recoverable from him and in the said recovery suit, the
ex-workman Mr. Rajiv Puri has also filed a counter claim. The suit
as well as the counter claim of the ex-workman is admittedly
pending adjudication before the trial court. The transferor
company in order to show its bonafide on the asking of the Court
has deposited an amount of Rs. 4,48,040/- with the Registrar
General of this Court on 22.04.2008 so that in case the
ex-workman is found entitled to the said amount, he may get it
with interest without any difficultly or anticipated delay.

The

Registrar General is directed that he should keep the said amount

deposited by the transferor company in a fixed deposit initially for
a period of one year and get the FDR renewed from time to time
till the disposal of the civil suit pending before the trial court. In
this view of the matter, I am of the considered opinion that no
prejudice is likely to be caused to the ex-workman Mr. Rajiv Puri
by grant of sanction to the proposed scheme of amalgamation.
8

It appears that the proposed scheme of amalgamation, if

accepted, would eliminate the multiple companies engaged in the
similar activities as both the transferor company as well as the
transferee company are engaged in the similar activities. The
proposed scheme will result in reduction of the overhead
expenses and also the administrative and procedural work. It will
also result in elimination of duplication of work and improve
efficiency

and

utilization

of

the

existing

resources,

more

productively and the same would benefit the shareholders as well
as the employees and the public at large. The transferor company
as well as the transferee company at their respective Board
meetings held on 19th and 26th December, 2005 are stated to have
already approved the scheme as proposed.
9

A perusal of the proposed scheme of amalgamation would

show that from the appointed date, if the scheme is approved, all
the assets of the transferor company with its claims and liabilities
would vest in the transferee company and it is for the transferee

well as to make a claim with reference to the rights on behalf of

would

The

employees

of

the

transferor

become

the

employees

of

the

transferee

company from the appointed date without affecting the terms and
conditions of their services they were enjoying as on the
appointed date, in any manner. The scheme of amalgamation also
provides that on approval of the said scheme and its becoming
effective, the transferor company shall stands dissolved without
winding up and all the shareholders of the transferor company
would get allotted one equity share of Rs. 10/- each for every one
equity share of Rs. 10/- held as on the appointed date.
10

In view of the above and having regard to the facts and

circumstances of the case there does not appear to be any legal
impediment

in

sanctioning

the

proposed

scheme

of

amalgamation. Consequently, sanction is hereby granted to the
proposed scheme of amalgamation under Section 391 and 394 of
the Companies Act, 1956 for amalgamation of the transferor
company with the transferee company. The certified copy of this
order shall be filed with the Registrar of Companies within five
weeks. It is clarified that this order should not be construed as an
order granting exemption from payment of stamp duty if payable
in accordance with law in regard to increase in the share capital of

COMPANY PETITION NO.23 OF 2006

Page No. 6 Of 7

the transferee company. Upon sanction becoming effective and
from the appointed date, the transferor Company shall stands
dissolved without its formal winding up.
11

The transferor company is directed to deposit Rs.20,000/-

towards costs in the Common Pool Fund of the Official Liquidator
within a period of three weeks from today.
12

In view of the above, this petition stands disposed of.
