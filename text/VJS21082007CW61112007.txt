ORDER
21.08.2007
It is not in dispute that while the Petitioner was

discharging his duties at Out-Post Phobrang at Laddaq in 1998-99
he suffered from frostbite. The Petitioner was placed in medical
category EEE due to “Pheripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) both

amputation”.

By

Memorandum dated 30.4.2001, keeping in view the type of job
for which the Petitioner was recruited in the Indo- Tibetan Border
Police Force the Board had opined that he is completely and
permanently

incapacitated

for

the

job

and

hence

was

recommended to be boarded out of service. Notwithstanding this
recommendation the Director General, ITBP had passed Orders
for the retention of the Petitioner in service. Keeping in view
that the Petitioner has passed the XIIth class pass he was
assigned duties of clerical nature which he has been performing
since then.

By means of the impugned Order, after making a

reference of his medical category EEE a decision has been taken
to terminate the service of the Petitioner by invalidating him on
the recommendation of the Board with effect from 27.8.2007, by
Office Memorandum dated 28.7.2007.

However, it is relevant

that the medical condition of the Petitioner has not deteriorated.
Mr.Ashwani Bhardwaj, learned counsel appearing for
the Respondents has raised a preliminary objection that this
Court ought not to exercise territorial jurisdiction over the
dispute as the impugned Order has been passed in Sonepat,

Haryana. Mr.R.K.Anand, learned Senior Counsel appearing for
the Petitioner, however, draws our attention to the previous
Order of the Director General passed in New Delhi, which
retained his services as a Clerk.

We do not think this case

warrants that we should decline exercising our writ jurisdiction.
Mr.Anand has also drawn our attention to Section 47
of The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection
of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, and the decision
rendered thereon by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kunal

Singh

-vs-

Union of India, (2003)

4 SCC 524.

Kunal

Singh was serving in the Special Service Board (SSB) and while
performing his duties he suffered an injury to his left leg. The
medical aid given to him was improper as a result of which his
left leg was amputated on account of gangrene which had
developed from the injury.

Even in those circumstances, their

Lordships had opined that it is “well settled that in the same
enactment if two distinct definitions are given defining a word/
expression, they must be understood accordingly in terms of the
definition. It must be remembered that a person does not acquire
or suffer disability by choice. An employee, who acquires
disability during his service, is sought to be protected under
W.P.(C) 6111/2007                                                                          Page   3 of 8

Section 47 of the Act specifically.

Such employee, acquiring

disability, if not protected, would not only suffer

himself, but

possibly all those depending on him would also suffer.”

The

Order of termination of Kunal Singh's service was set aside and
the Respondents were directed to give relief in terms of Section
47 of the Act.
In this regard learned counsel for the Respondents
submits that the Central Government has, having regard to the
type of work carried on, exempted all categories of post of
combatant personnel of the Armed Forces from the provisions of
Section 47, vide Government of India, Ministry of Social Justice
and Empowerment, Notification No. 16-27/2001-N 1.1, dated 28th
March, 2002. This Notification reads thus:-

[No. 16-27/2001-N1.1]

We also note that the Central Government has – in
exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Section 47 of
The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of
Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (1 of 1996) exempted all
categories of posts of 'combatant personnel' only of the Special
Service Bureau (SSB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs from
the provisions of section 47 Vide S.O.947 (E), dated 16th August,
2004.

This Notification is palpably a result of the decision in

Kunal's case.
We may also reproduce the following Notification
which has a direct bearing on the dispute before us.

Counsel

for

the

Respondent contends that the

Petitioner remains a combatant personnel even though he has
been assigned clerical duties. The Notifications, however, use the

W.P.(C) 6111/2007                                                                          Page   6 of 8

word 'combatant personnel' only the Forces in question.

It

assumes, therefore, that there are personnel of the Armed Forces
and Central Para Military Forces who are non-combatants.

At

this stage of the proceedings, we are prima facie of the view that
a person posted as a Clerk would not fall within the category of
'combatant personnel'.

Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition

defines the word 'combat' as forcible encounter

between two

or more persons; battle, a duel. The Concise Oxford Dictionary
defines 'combatant' as a
during the war.

person or nation engaged in fighting

The Collins Cobuild, English Dictionary for

Advanced Learners states 'combatant' is a person, group or
country that takes part in fighting in a war. At this stage, we
cannot accept the contention on behalf of the Respondents that
even a person who is assigned clerical duties would nevertheless
fall within the category of 'combatant personnel'.
We are not a little concerned that the decision to
terminate the service of the Petitioner has been taken without a
contemporaneous
