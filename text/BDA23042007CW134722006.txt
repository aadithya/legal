1.

In this writ petition, the Office Memorandum issued by the

Directorate General of Works, Central Public Works Department, CSQ
Organisation, Contract & Manual Unit, Nirman Bhawan, New Delhi, is
impugned. Ms. Salwan, who appears on behalf of the petitioner submits that in
identical circumstances in the case of M/s Alcon Builders & Engineers Pvt.
Ltd., which is a Class-I electrical contractor like the present petitioner, this

WPC13472/2006

Page No.1 of 3

Court had set aside a similar impugned order and directed the respondent to
revalidate the enlistment of the petitioner.

2.

She submits that the reason given in the Office Memorandum dated

27.07.2006 for non-grant of revalidation of enlistment as a Class-I electrical
contractor is identical to the reason given in the case of M/s Alcon Builders &
Engineers Pvt. Ltd. The said reason reads as under:“....................The competent authority is not fit
for further revalidation as the contractor had
failed to secure any work of appropriate nature
and amount as required as per Enlistment Rules
2001 under Para 21(1), (ii) & (iii) during the
revalidation of enlistment & provisional extension
granted to the contractor.”
With reference to the aforesaid reasons, she submitted that revalidation has
been denied on the ground that even during the provisional extension granted to
the petitioner, the petitioner has been unable to secure any work of an
appropriate nature and amount as required under the Enlistment Rules 2001
under Para 21(1), (ii) & (iii).

She submits that this is factually incorrect

inasmuch as the enlistment of the petitioner was revalidated up to 30.01.2005
and thereafter provisionally extended up to 31.07.2005. The petitioner had
submitted tenders for works which were accepted on 29.03.2005, i.e, during the
period of provisional extension. The quantum of the work was to the extent of
Rs.35 lacs, which is far in excess of the requirement of Rs.10 lacs.

3.

The learned counsel for the respondent could not controvert the

factual position. He, however, sought to justify the Office Memorandum on
some other reasons as indicated in their counter-affidavit. However, it is well
settled that an order, which is passed on certain reasons, would stand or fall on
those very reasons and not any other reasons.

4.

I have considered the arguments advanced by the counsel for the

parties. It is clear that this matter is entirely covered by the decision in the case
of M/s Alcon Builders & Engineers Pvt. Ltd v. Union of India : WP (C)
13002/2006, which was decided on 23.02.2007.

The impugned Office

Memorandum dated 27.07.2006 cannot stand and, therefore, the same is set
aside.

The respondents are directed to revalidate the enlistment of the

petitioner within two weeks.
This writ petition stands disposed of. No order as to costs.
