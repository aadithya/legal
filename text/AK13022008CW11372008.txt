1.

The grievance of the petitioner is that the workman Ganesh was

never employed by the petitioner who was carrying on business as a
sole proprietor in the name of M/s.A.V.Industries, 212, Okhla
Industrial Estate, Phase-III, New Delhi-110020 and the award was
passed against his brother Mr.P.D.Khanna who was also carrying on
another

business

as

a

sole

proprietor

under

the

name

of

M/s.A.V.Industries from the same premises, however, the award is
implemented against him though the respondent no.3 was never

employed by him.

to

The learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn my attention
order

dated

representative
adjournment

4th

December,

2002

where

the

authorized

of the management Sh.Anand Jha had
due

to

death

of

Sh.P.D.Khanna,

owner

sought
of

the

management. The petitioner contends that Sh.Anand Jha was never
appointed by him as an authorized representative. The petitioner also
contends that his brother had shifted his business which was carried
on by him under the name and style of M/s.A.V.Industries (P) Ltd in
1999 and under a family settlement the entire premises is under the
possession of the petitioner who is carrying on business under the
name and style of M/s A.V.Industries (P) Ltd where respondent no.3
was never employed nor the award is passed against his business.
3.

The award dated 20th March, 2006 is passed against M/s

A.V.Industries, 212, Okhla Industrial Estate, Phase-III, New Delhi110020 without specifying as to who is the proprietor of the said firm
pursuant to the claim filed by the respondent on 5th April, 1999.
4.

The

petitioner

contends

that

though

he

has

made

a

representation dated 13th December, 2007 that the award dated 20th
March, 2006 has not been passed against the petitioner’s firm as the
respondent No.3 workman was allegedly an employee of M/s
A.V.Industries whose sole proprietor was Sh.P.D.Khanna but it is

WP(C) No.1137/2008

enforced against him without deciding his pleas and contentions and
objections.
5.

From the orders of the Labor Court which has been relied on by

the petitioner, prima facie it appears that the owner of the
management was Shri P.D.Khanna and not the petitioner. Therefore,
unless it is decided that the claim of the workman was against the
petitioner or not, it will not be appropriate to enforce the award
against the petitioner, in the facts and circumstances of the present
case.
6.

In the facts and circumstances it will be just and appropriate

and in the interest of justice for the respondent Nos.1 & 2 to decide
the representation/objections of the petitioner that the respondent
no.3 was not his employee and not employed by him and the award
dated 20th March, 2006 was not passed against him before enforcing
and executing the award against the petitioner.
7.

In the circumstances the writ petition is disposed of with a

direction

to

the

respondent

Nos.1

&

2

to

dispose

of

the

representation/objections dated 13th December, 2007 of the petitioner
within four weeks. In case it is decided after hearing the petitioner
and considering his pleas and contentions that the award was passed
against his firm/business, only then the award 20th March, 2006 be
enforced against the petitioner. In the circumstances, till the

Page 3 of 4

representation/objections dated 13th December, 2007 of the petitioner
are adjudicated, the award dated 20th March, 2006 be not executed
against the petitioner. With these directions the writ petition and
application in the writ petition are disposed of.
Dasti to the parties.
