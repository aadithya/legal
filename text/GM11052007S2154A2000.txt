1.

The award dated 16th July, 2000 made and published by Justice S.B.

Sanyal, retired sole arbitrator in a reference made by this court, arises for
consideration in the present matter.

The Metallurgical & Engineering

Consultants (India) Ltd. ("MECON" for brevity) agreed to render detailed
CS (OS) No.2154A/2000

Page No.1

engineering, inspection and site supervision services by an agreement dated
5th August, 1985 to M/s Munak Gulva Sheets Ltd. MECON was entitled to
receive the fee detailed in the agreement. An amount of Rs.5,00,000/- was
to be paid by M/s Munak Gulva Sheets Pvt. Ltd. at the time of signing the
agreement and Rs.4,450,000/- was to be paid by the owner in equal
quarterly instalment commencing from the date of disbursement of financial
assistance by the financial institution to the respondent or by the 30th month
of the signing of the agreement.
2.

These parties had also entered into an agreement dated 19th

September, 1985 with CLESIN, a foreign contractor. By this agreement,
MECON was to execute the supplies and services for installation of a
galvanising line plant at the site of M/s Munak Gulva Sheets Pvt. Limited at
Alwar. Except for certain specific items to be supplied by the foreign
contractor according to their design, the rest of the supplies were to be
effected according to the design made by MECON.

The indigenous

supplies were to be effected by MECON at the price of Rs.38,00,000/which was payable by M/s Munak Gulva Sheets Pvt. Ltd. to MECON.
3.

On receipt of a request dated 24th April, 1986 from M/s Munak Gulva

Sheets Pvt. Ltd., MECON reduced its fee towards consultancy from
CS (OS) No.2154A/2000

Page No.2

Rs.56,00,000/- to Rs.46,00,000/-.

MECON rendered the services and

supplies in compliance of their obligation under the agreement dated 5 th
August, 1985 but M/s Munak Gulva Sheets Pvt. Ltd. failed to honour its
agreement.

On account of certain troubles faced by the respondent, it

desired stoppage of work. As a result MECON could not proceed further
even though it had to maintain idle labour and establishment at the factory
site of M/s Munak Gulva Sheets Pvt. Ltd. for an indefinite period.
4.

In this background, there were disputes between the parties resulting

in invocation of the arbitration clause contained in the agreements between
the parties on the 12th March, 1990. MECON appointed Mr. S.R. Grover,
the then Director (Law) of the Steel Authority of India Limited, as its
nominee while m/s Munak Gulva Sheets Pvt. Limited appointed one Shri
Raja Ram Singh, Director of m/s V.K. Construction Works as its nominee
arbitrator. These arbitrators entered upon the reference on 21st March, 1992.
On 4th May, 1992 MECON submitted statement of claim.

However, by the

time M/s Munak Gulva Sheets Private Limited had to file its reply, the
statutory period for making of the arbitral award was over. M/s Munak
Gulva Sheets Pvt. Limited initially consented to extension of time but it
failed to file its reply within the extended period.

Sheets Pvt. Limited thereafter refused to extend the time by consent.
5.

In these circumstances, MECON filed a petition being OMP

No.113/1995 in this court on the 4th September, 1995. By an order dated 2nd
February, 1999, OMP No.113/1995 was allowed and Hon'ble Mr. Justice
S.B. Sanyal (Retired) was appointed as sole arbitrator to adjudicate upon the
disputes.
6.

Both agreements contained an arbitration clause which provided that

the parties would be entitled to nominate their respective nominees to act as
an arbitrator and in the case of any dispute between the nominees, an umpire
was to be appointed in writing in the proceeding reference.
7.

The learned arbitrator appointed by this court issued notices to the

parties. The petitioner participated in the matter but the respondent avoided
taking service of notice. Ultimately, the respondent could be served in the
matter only by publication of a citation in the national daily “The Times of
India” (Delhi edition) dated 4th September, 1999.

The arbitrator had

recorded in its order that in case the respondent failed to appear on 11th
September, 1999, the arbitration proceedings would proceed ex parte. Steps
for service through registered cover were also undertaken.
8.

The respondent still failed to appear before the arbitrator on the date

CS (OS) No.2154A/2000

Page No.4

fixed on 11th September, 1999 despite service.
9.

In these circumstances, the matter was heard ex parte. The petitioner

had submitted a claim with interest to the tune of Rs.2,02,80,418/- towards
the consultancy contract dated 5th August, 1985 and Rs.2,80,000/- towards
the value of the material supplied as per the supply and services contract
dated 19th September, 1985. The petitioner had, thus, raised a total claim of
Rs.2,05,60,418/-.

The arbitrator permitted ex parte evidence of the

claimant by way of affidavit. Accordingly, the MECON filed an affidavit of
Shri P.A. Chary, Senior Manager (Administration) on behalf of the
petitioner.

Even thereafter, I find from the record that the arbitration

proceedings were set down for hearing on 11 th December, 1999, 12-13
February, 2000, 8th April, 2000 and 13th May, 2000. The arbitrator had even
given permission to the respondent to file response to the claims and to
cross-examine the claimants witnesses in case of their appearance in the
matter. None put in appearance however. I find that the learned arbitrator
has considered the agreement dated 5th August, 1985 for providing detailed
consultancy services and the agreement dated 19th September, 1985 known
as the supply contract entered into between the parties.

There was no

rebuttal to the contentions and claims of the MECON resulting in making
CS (OS) No.2154A/2000

Page No.5

and publishing of the award dated 16th July, 2000. The arbitrator found the
claimant MECON entitled to total sum of Rs.2,05,60,418/- in the two
contracts. So far as the interest is concerned, the learned arbitrator awarded
simple interest at the rate of 12% per annum on this amount w.e.f. 19th
December, 1991 till 20th March, 1992. Thereafter, the claimant was held
entitled to pendente lite interest w.e.f. 21st March, 1992 till the date of the
award at the rate of 9% per annum simple interest. So far as the period post
award is concerned, the learned arbitrator has awarded 6% per annum
simple interest till the date of decree or realisation. The claimant MECON
has been held entitled to fees and charges of hearing which has been
quantified at Rs.25,000/-.
The award is based on the contract between the parties and the claim
and the evidence led before the arbitrator which was not disputed.
I find that the award has been made and published after due
application of mind towards the relevant circumstances and material placed
before it.
10.

No objections to the award have been filed by any party. In exercise

of jurisdiction under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, there is no
impediment to the award dated 16th July, 2000 being made rule of the court.
CS (OS) No.2154A/2000

Accordingly, the arbitral award dated 16th July, 2000 is made rule of
the court.
The Registry shall draw up the decree thereon in accordance with law.
