Hon'ble Mr.Justice Pradeep Nandrajog

1.

to see the judgment?

2.

To be referred to the Reporter or not?

3.
:

Whether judgment should be reported in Digest?
PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 15.2.2005

passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge allowing Criminal
Revision Petition No.75/2004 filed by the respondent and as a
consequence setting aside the order dated 1.8.2004 passed by
the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi.
2.

To appreciate the rival contentions of the parties, brief

pen profile of the relevant facts needs to be noted which are to
the effect that the respondent filed a petition under
Page 1 of 5

Section 125 Cr.P.C. claiming maintenance against the petitioner
inter alia alleging that the two contracted a marriage on
19.3.1996 (should actually read 19.3.1995). She stated that she
was abandoned by the petitioner and had no means to sustain
herself.
3.

The petitioner opposed the said petition inter alia

pointing out that the parties had divorced as per a talaknama duly
signed by both parties. He stated that professing Islamic faith till
husband did not give the requisite consent as required by Muslim
Women's Protection of Rights on Divorce Act 1986, respondent
could not lay a claim to any maintenance under Section 125
Cr.P.C.
4.

Unfortunately for the respondent she did not file a

rejoinder to the reply filed by the petitioner. The result was that
vide order dated 2.11.1996 respondent's application under
Section 125 Cr.P.C. was dismissed.
5.

A fact may be noted.

Though no evidence was led,

learned Judge recorded that he had compared the signatures of
the respondent on the talaknama with her admitted signatures on
the court file as contained in her pleadings and was prima facie
satisfied

that

respondent.

the

the

Page 2 of 5
6.

Order dated 2.11.1996 has admittedly not been

challenged till date. It has attained finality.
7.

Thereafter, in the year 2001, petitioner filed another

application under Section 125 Cr.P.C. and also prayed for interim
maintenance.
8.

Petitioner opposed the same by inter alia pointing out

that in view of the order dated 2.11.1996, issue having attained
finality, respondent could not seek any maintenance from him.
9.

Dealing with the application for interim maintenance

learned Metropolitan Magistrate, vide order dated 11.8.2004 held
that in view of the order dated 2.11.1996 interim maintenance
could not be granted to the respondent. Her application seeking
interim maintenance was dismissed.

As regards main petition,

matter was listed for evidence.
10.

Respondent challenged the order dated 11.8.2004.

Learned Additional Sessions Judge held that till it was established
that the matrimonial bond between the parties had snapped,
application for interim maintenance was maintainable.

Thus,

allowing criminal revision petition No.75/2004 learned Additional
Sessions Judge has directed
Page 3 of 5

petitioner to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs.500/- to the
respondent.
11.

The legal issue which arises for consideration in the

context of the facts afore-noted lies within a narrow compass.
12.

Whether interim maintenance could be awarded? Is the

question which needs answer.
13.

While it may be true that order dated 2.11.1996 did not

adjudicate the issue on merits as noted above, said order was the
result of respondent not filing a replication to the reply filed by the
petitioner to her application seeking interim maintenance and to
that extent it cannot be said that the said order would operate as
res judicata.
14.

Reason

being

that

sine

qua

non

for

a

judicial

adjudication to operate as res judicata is a decision on merits.
But, at the same time, impact of the order dated 2.11.1996
cannot be nullified without a further inquiry.
15.

The petitioner has a prima facie finding in his favour as

noted in the same order.
16.

Thus, at the second stage proceedings till evidence

was led, question of awarding any maintenance to the respondent
does not arise.
Page 4 of 5

17.

Indeed, the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, vide her

order dated 11.8.2004 while declining interim maintenance has
rightly held that matter has to be tried and for said reason notified
a date for recording evidence.
18.

Thus, impugned order dated 15.2.2005 cannot be

sustained.
19.

Petition stands disposed of quashing the impugned

order dated 15.2.2005.
20.

Noting that respondent's petition for maintenance

under Section 125 Cr.P.C. is still pending and the fact that it was
filed in the year 2001, I direct the learned Metropolitan Magistrate
to expeditiously record evidence and dispose of the said petition
in accordance with law.
21.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned counsel

for the parties.
