SANJIV KHANNA, J :
1.

Fraud and justice never dwell together (fraus et jus nunquam

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

2

cohabitant) and fraud and deceit defend or excuse no man (fraus et
dolus nemini patrocinari debent) are two doctrines which are applied by
the Courts to recall earlier orders/judgments.
2.

Since fraud strikes at the very root of an Order/judgment and effects

solemnity, and the Rule of Law, Courts have exercised their inherent
power whenever it is brought to their notice that fraud has been practiced.
The above principles have been recently reiterated by the Supreme Court
in the case of Hamza Haji versus State of Kerala and another reported in
(2006) 7 SCC 416, wherein the entire case law on the subject has been
extensively examined and considered. In the said case, it has been held
that a second review application in law is not maintainable but a Court
can exercise it's power as a court of record to nullify a decision procured
by playing a fraud. A decision procured by fraud must be set at naught
and no person who is guilty of having come to Court with unclean hands
and practising fraud should be allowed to take advantage and benefit of
an order/judgment obtained and tainted by fraud. Power to recall is
somewhat different and distinct from power of review. Power of recall is
an inherent power, whereas power of review must be specifically

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

3

conferred on the authorities/Court (Refer Budhiya Swain versus Gopinath
Deb reported in (1994) 4 SCC 396 for the distinction between the two and
when power to recall can be exercised).
3.

The petitioner/non-applicant has succeeded before this Court in the

th
judgment dated 7 October, 2005. The Writ Petition was allowed and it
was held that there was no concluded contract as the petitioner's/ nonapplicant's proposal for voluntary retirement was withdrawn before
acceptance. Accordingly, the petitioner/non-applicant had continued in
service of the applicant-respondent. In these circumstances, option was
given to the petitioner/non-applicant to refund the amount received under
the Voluntary Retirement Scheme to the applicant-respondent with
interest and thereafter the applicant-respondent was directed to pay
salary, allowances and other retirement benefits to the petitioner/nonapplicant with interest calculated on pro-rata basis. It was left open to the
respondent-applicant to take action in accordance with law on the
question whether the departmental proceedings should be initiated.
4.

In the application under consideration, the respondent-applicant has

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

4

brought on record documents and material to show that the
petitioner/non-applicant had taken employment with RITES after the
petitioner/non-applicant was relieved and paid under the Voluntary
Retirement Scheme. This fact came to the knowledge of the respondent-

applicant only when letter dated 19/23

rd

May, 2006 was received from

RITES. In these circumstances, it is stated that the judgment dated 7

th

October, 2005 should be recalled.
5.

In the reply filed by the petitioner/non-applicant, it is admitted that

he had worked with RITES after being relieved. It is also admitted that
this fact was not informed to this Court. However, it is denied that the
petitioner/non-applicant had obtuse motive and was guilty of concealment
of facts. It is stated that the Court was not misled and the petitioner/non
-applicant had not tried to derive undue, inadmissible monetary benefit by
illegal or fraudulent means. It is also stated that at best, principle of

mitigation of damages should be applied but the judgment dated 7

th

October, 2005 should not be recalled. It is also vaguely averred that the

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006
respondent-applicant

was

5
aware

about

the

employment

of

the

petitioner/non-applicant with RITES as vigilance clearance was obtained
before employment with 'no objection certificate' being issued.
6.

Some more facts/dates may be noted. The Writ Petition was filed

on 21

st

September, 1993 and was dismissed vide Order dated 20

th

July,

1994 on the ground that the petitioner/non-applicant had obtained
monetary benefits payable under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme. This

Order dated 20

th

July, 1994 was taken in appeal before the Supreme

Court. The Supreme Court by its Order dated 31

the Order dated 20

th

st

March, 1999 set aside

July, 1994 and remitted the matter to this Court for

being heard and disposed of on merits. In terms of the directions issued
by the Supreme Court, the matter was head and disposed of vide

judgment dated 7

7.

th

October, 2005.

From the documents placed on record and admitted before this

Court, the petitioner/non-applicant had during the period 16.61995 –

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

6

15.12.1998 and thereafter from 8.3.1999 – 8.9.1999 had worked in
RITES. It is obvious that the petitioner could not have mentioned these

facts in the Writ Petition which was filed on 22

nd

September, 1993.

However, these facts relating to the employment of the petitioner/nonapplicant with RITES should have been brought to the notice of this Court
when the matter was heard. It is also apparent that the petitioner/nonapplicant did not bring these facts to the notice of the Supreme Court

when the appeal was disposed of vide Order dated 31

st

March, 1999.

Even after the judgment was passed and specific directions for payment
of arrears of salary was made for the entire period w.e.f September 1993,
the petitioner/non-applicant did not move any application or inform this
Court about the employment. There is no doubt that the petitioner/nonapplicant had deliberately and intentionally concealed facts about his
employment that were very much in his knowledge. The petitioner/nonapplicant was conscious and aware that these facts were material and
vital as he was claiming arrears of salary from the date he was relieved
till superannuation. It is sheer good fortune of the respondent-applicant

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

7

that by chance they came to know at the very last moment about the
employment of the petitioner/non-applicant with RITES. It is certain that if
these facts were brought to the notice of the Court before the judgment

dated 7

th

October, 2005 was passed or even thereafter, the direction to

pay the arrears of salary and allowances for the entire period after 23

rd

September, 1993 till superannuation would have been modified and the
pay and allowances payable for the period from 16.6.1995 – 15.12.1998
and from 8.3.1999 – 8.9.1999 when the petitioner/non-applicant had
remained employed with RITES, would have been excluded or
proportionately the pay and allowances payable for this period would
have been reduced by applying the principle of mitigation. It is not a mere
case of negligence on the part of the petitioner/non-applicant or
ignorance with lack of knowledge. The petitioner/non-applicant was fully
conscious of the relief he had prayed for and claimed and the order that
the Court was likely to pass if he succeeds. There was nothing that
prevented the petitioner/non-applicant from informing true and correct
facts before this Court at the time of arguments or even thereafter by

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

8

filing an affidavit when the judgment was reserved for pronouncement or

after the judgment dated 7

th

October, 2005 was passed. It was pre-

meditated and intentional contrivance to keep the Court and the
respondent-applicant in ignorance of the real facts to procure
judgment/order for payment of arrears for the entire period.
8.

We are conscious of the fact that there is difference between a

mere mistake and even negligence which by itself is not fraud but merely
evidence of fraud. However, the present case is one in which the
petitioner/non-applicant made a false representation deliberately and
intentionally concealing facts to mislead the Court. In the present facts,
the motive to mislead and the intention to do so is writ large. Fraud is
proved when it is shown that false representation was intentionally and
recklessly made without caring to know whether it is true or false. In the
present matter, vital and relevant material facts were concealed. The
Petitioner/non-applicant was fully aware that true facts were not brought
to the notice of the Court. Thus actual fraud has been established and it
is not a case of mere constructive fraud.

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006
9.

Failure to point out the factum of employment cannot be regarded

as a mere secondary fact that was immaterial or irrelevant for granting
relief. The facts concealed were not collateral or extraneous. In Story's

Equity Jurisprudence, 14

th

Edition, Vol.1, as quoted in Hamza Haji

(supra) it has been observed :“Fraud indeed, in the sense of a Court of Equity,
properly includes all acts, omissions, and
concealments which involve a breach of legal or
equitable duty, trust, or confidence, justly reposed,
and are injurious to another, or by which an undue
and unconscientious advantage is taken of
another.”

10.

Thus omission and concealment which involves breach of legal or

equitable duty and confidence justly reposed, is equal to fraud. Similarly,
the Supreme Court in Bharau Dadu versus State of Maharashtra reported
in (2005) 7 SCC 605 has held that suppression of a material document
would amount to fraud on a Court. In another case S.P. Chengalvaraya
Naidu (decd) thr. LRs versus Jagannath and others reported in (1994) 1
SCC 1, the Supreme Court was critical and did not agree with the High

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

10

Court that there is no legal duty cast upon a party to come to the Court
with a true case and prove it by true evidence. It was held that fraud is an
act of deliberate deception with a design to secure something by taking
unfair advantage. Deception to gain by another's loss is fraud. Failure to
disclose relevant and material facts and non-mentioning of even a
document can tantamount to playing a fraud on the Court, if it is done
with the intention to gain advantage with a view to procure an order or an
advantage from the Court without disclosing all facts. Obtaining relief by
deliberately suppressing facts, which were fundamental to entitlement of
relief and foundation of the claim amounts to practising fraud.
11.

The only question which now survives is whether we entirely recall

our order/judgment dated 7

th

October, 2005 or suitably modified it in view

of the admitted position that the petitioner/non-applicant had worked
during the period 16.6.1995 – 15.12.1998 and from 8.3.1999 – 8.9.1999.
To follow the second option will be to put the petitioner/non-applicant in
the same position in which he would have been if the true facts were

informed to this Court before the Judgment dated 7

th

October, 2005 was

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

11

passed. This would not meet the ends of justice. By doing so, the
petitioner/non-applicant would be let off lightly and will send a wrong
signal to litigants that they can conceal material and true facts and then
get away with relief even after the fraud is revealed. This will result in
miscarriage of justice. Much harsher and stricter order is required in such
matters. Confidence of the court is betrayed. A writ court is a court of
equity and exercise of jurisdiction is discretionary. Parties must approach
the Court with clean hands by disclosing true and relevant facts. A party
concealing facts to obtain relief, which he does not deserve cannot be let
off. Accordingly, we feel that this is a fit case in which while recalling our

Order dated 7

th

October, 2005, we should entirely withdraw the relief

which otherwise the petitioner/non-applicant would be entitled to, inspite
of the fact that he had worked during the period 16.6.1995 – 15.12.1998
and 8.3.1999 – 8.9.1999. The first option is the only option that we, with
some dolour and anguish, adopt.
12. In Rajabhai Abdul Rehman Munshi versus Vasudev Dhanjibhai Mody
reported in (1964) 3 SCR 481 it has been observed (at p. 488):

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

12

“Exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court under Article
136 of the Constitution is discretionary: it is
exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases, when
a substantial question of law falls to be determined
or where it appears to the Court that interference by
this Court is necessary to remedy serious injustice. A
party who approaches this Court invoking the
exercise of this overriding discretion of the Court
must come with clean hands. If there appears on his
part any attempt to overreach or mislead the Court
by false or untrue statements or by withholding true
information which would have a bearing on the
question of exercise of the discretion, the Court
would be justified in refusing to exercise the
discretion or if the discretion has been exercised in
revoking the leave to appeal granted even at the
time of hearing of the appeal.”

The observations made above, equally apply when a party files a writ
petition but conceals true, correct and relevant facts.

13.

Supreme Court in case of Vijay Syal versus State of Punjab

reported in (2003) 9 SCC 401 has held as under:

“24. In order to sustain and maintain the sanctity and
solemnity of the proceedings in law courts it is
necessary that parties should not make false or
knowingly,
inaccurate
statements
or
misrepresentation and/or should not conceal
material facts with a design to gain some advantage
or benefit at the hands of the court, when a court is
considered as a place where truth and justice are
the solemn pursuits. If any party attempts to pollute
such a place by adopting recourse to make
misrepresentation and is concealing material facts it
does so at its risk and cost. Such party must be

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

13

ready to take the consequences that follow on
account of its own making. At times lenient or liberal
or generous treatment by courts in dealing with such
matters is either mistaken or lightly taken instead of
learning a proper lesson. Hence there is a
compelling need to take a serious view in such
matters to ensure expected purity and grace in the
administration of justice.”
14.

We may mention here that we have exercised our power and

inherent right with a Court to recall an order and not merely exercised
right to review an order/judgment under Order XLVII of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908. Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
applies

when

new

and

important

evidence/facts

come

to

the

knowledge/notice of one of the parties, which were not known earlier.
There is nothing on record to show that any clearance was obtained by
RITES from the applicant-respondent. Police verification does not imply
knowledge of employment to the past employer.No document or material
is on record to establish that the applicant-respondent was aware and/or
had knowledge of the employment of the petitioner-non applicant. It has
not been alleged that the respondent applicant was not diligent. Thus
requirements of Order XLVII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 are

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

14

satisfied in the present case. Therefore, we could have also exercised
our power to review under the aforesaid provision. Mere dismissal of an
SLP before it is admitted/granted, does not bar a High Court from
entertaining a review application.(Refer Kunhayammed versus State of
Kerala reported in (2000) 6 SCC 359 and National Housing Cooperative
Society Limited versus State of Rajasthan reported in (2005) 12 SCC
149). Therefore, we do not find any merit in the contention raised by the
petitioner/non-applicant that the respondent-applicant had filed a SLP

against the judgment dated 7

th

October, 2005 and the same was

dismissed. Admittedly, the SLP was dismissed in January, 2006 and the
fact that the petitioner/non-applicant had taken employment in RITES
came to the knowledge of the respondent-applicant only in May, 2006.
15.

In the facts and circumstances of the case, we allow the application

and recall our order/judgment

dated 7

th

October, 2005. Writ Petition

filed by the petitioner/non-applicant will be treated as dismissed. The
cheques given by the petitioner/non-applicant will be returned by the
respondent-applicant and will not be encashed. In view of the Order

CM Nos.7456 & 8605/2006

15

passed above, we are not passing a specific order imposing costs on the
petitioner/non-applicant though the facts require imposition of exemplary
costs.
CM NO. 7456 OF 2006 IN WP(C) NO.4458 OF 1993
In view of the order passed above, the application has become
infructuous and is accordingly dismissed.
