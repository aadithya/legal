Ten of the twelve Charges were held to have been

proved.

The Sentence passed by the Court Martial reads as

follows:-

3.

“The court having found the accused guilty of
offences charged under section 13 (2) of Prevention
of Corruption Act, 1988, r/w Section 77(2) of Navy
Act, 1957, under section 60(d) of Navy Act, 1957,
U/s. 54(2) of Navy Act, 1957, adjudges the said
Commodore NM Pandit (60219-K), Indian Navy, of
Indian Naval Ship Angre, to undergo Rigorous
Imprisonment of 18 (eighteen) calendar months, to
be dismissed from naval service, to forfeit 36 (thirty
six) calendar months seniority in the rank of
substantive Captain, and to pay a fine of Rupees
Three Lakhs and to suffer consequential penalties
involved”
Learned counsel for the Petitioner contends that

since no sentence of dismissal with disgrace under Section 82(3)
of the Navy Act, 1957 had been passed, the Petitioner is entitled
to pension.

In this connection reliance is placed by him on

Section 82(3) of the Navy Act which stipulates that the
punishment of imprisonment for a term extending to two years
shall

in all cases be accompanied by a sentence of dismissal

with disgrace from the naval service.

The provision leaves no

room for discretion in such circumstances. In our view it does
W.P. (C) 9317 of 2007

Page 7 of 11

not logically follow

where punishment of imprisonment for a

term below two years has been awarded a sentence of dismissal
with disgrace cannot be prescribed. All that happens in such
cases is that

a

specific decision regarding dismissal with

disgrace has to be articulated.

The contention which is

thereafter raised is that the sentence must be imposed by a
Court

Martial.

Reliance

has

(T.S.)Harbans Singh Sandhu -vs- Union of India,

on

Lt.Col.

which was

decided on November 22, 1978 but was reported almost two
decades later as (2002) 1 SCC 427. The editorial comments in
the reporting draw attention to the decision of Supreme Court
in Union of India -vs- P.D.Yadav (2002) 1 SCC 405.

The

relevant portion of Yadav are extracted below:“15.It is useful to look at the position of law
emerging from various decisions. The facts of the
case in Lt.Col. (T.S.) Harbans Singh Sandhu v. Union
of India, W.P.No.553/1972, decided on 22.22.1978
were that a General Court Martial tried the
petitioner and imposed a punishment of cashiering
under Section 71(d) of the Army Act and no further
punishment was imposed under Section 71(h) of the
Army Act for forfeiture of service for the purpose of
increased pay, pension or any other prescribed
purpose; he applied for grant of pensionary benefits;
the authorities did not respond: hence, he filed writ
petition seeking direction to the authorities for
granting gratuity and pension due. Both the sides
pointed to Regulation 16(a). From the records, it
was found that no order had been passed under the
said Regulation. In the absence of passing any order
under Section 16 (a), the Court directed the
W.P. (C) 9317 of 2007

Page 8 of 11

respondent to pay the sum due towards gratuity and
pension.
Under Section 71(h) a punishment of
forfeiture of service for the purpose of pension could
be passed but neither that punishment was imposed
on the petitioner nor order was passed under
Regulation 16(a) forfeiting his pensionary benefits.
In those circumstances, the Court gave direction as
stated above.”
........
24. The argument that since no punishment was
imposed under clause (k) by the authorities,
although it could have been done, then there is no
warrant to pass an order forfeiting pension under
the Army Pension Regulations in respect of the same
offence cannot be accepted. As already noticed
above, the provisions relating to punishments under
the Acts and the Pension Regulations operate in
different fields. Clause (k) refers to forfeiture of
arrears of pay and allowances and other public
money due to a person at the time of cashiering or
dismissal.
Pension is one, which becomes due
subsequent to retirement or termination of service
subject
to
satisfying
certain
conditions
of
satisfactory qualifying service and if not otherwise
disentitled from claiming pension.
Firstly, clause
(k) does not speak of pension as such; it speaks of all
arrears, pay, allowances and other public money due
to a person. It cannot be said that on the date of
cashiering or dismissal there could be any arrears
of pension. Section 73 of the Army Act enables the
authorities to impose punishments in combination.
Merely because punishment is not imposed under
clause (h) or (k) of Section 71 and other
punishments are imposed, it does not mean that the
President is deprived of his power and jurisdiction to
pass order under Regulation 16(a); so also the
Central Government under Regulation 15(2) of the
Navy Pension Regulations taking note of the
punishment imposed under Section 81 of the Navy
Act. In a case where punishment is imposed under
Section 81(m) of the Navy Act forfeiting pension
and/or gratuity, need for passing an order forfeiting
pension under Regulation 15(2) of the Navy
W.P. (C) 9317 of 2007

Page 9 of 11

(Pension) Regulations may not arise. But that does
not mean that in cases of punishments imposed,
which are covered by Regulation 15 of the Central
Government is deprived of its power to pass
appropriate orders under the said Regulation, when
such power is specifically conferred on the Central
Government under the very Regulations, which
enables granting of pension and/or gratuity. It is
rather not possible to accept the contention that a
General Court Martial and confirming authorities
imposing punishments can debar the President or
the Central Government from passing orders as
provided for specifically and expressly under the
Pension Regulations.”
4.

These

observations

are

unequivocal

authority

against the Petitioner's contention. Accordingly, the concerned
Authority is competent to decide or decline that notwithstanding
that a punishment of imprisonment for only eighteen months has
been prescribed,

the dismissal can be treated as “with

dishonour”, leading to the consequence of forfeiture of pension.

Annexure P-17 to the Petition is a letter dated 29th

December, 2006 authored by the Commander, Joint Director,
Pay and Pension (P & P). It refers to the Petitioner's
representation

It informs the Petitioner that a competent authority

has rejected the request for grant of pensionary benefits under
powers delegated by the Government of India, Ministry of
Defence letter dated 14.8.2001.

W.P. (C) 9317 of 2007

The said Order has been

Page 10 of 11

annexed as Annexure P.19. Perusal of the Order discloses that
Raksha Mantri had indicated the Approving Authority in the
Service Headquarters in respect of the subjects covered by the
Order.

Pensionary Award to officers dismissed from service

otherwise than with disgrace/cashiering is specifically itemized
in the Order.

It is these powers which have been exercised

against the Petitioner.
6.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner now contends

that in view of the definition given to Central Government in the
General Clauses Act it is only the President who could have
delegated these powers.

We are unable to accept this

argument. In view of the decision in Yadav reliance on Rule 15
is of no avail to the Petitioner.
7.

The Petition is without merit and hence dismissed.
