Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat (Open Court)
1.

This petition is for quashing of criminal proceedings i.e. complaint filed by the

respondent for alleged commission of offences under Sections 138/141 Negotiable
Instruments Act (hereafter referred to as “the Act”).
2.

The complainant had alleged that the petitioner accused issued a cheque for Rs.

25482/- on 14.6.2000. It was dishonoured upon presentation in the normal course of
business. It was again presented on 28.6.2000 but not honoured. On the third occasion, it
was presented on 5.9.2000 and dishonoured on 7.9.2000. The dishonour memo was

crlmc-957/05

1 of 4

issued on 14.9.2000 and the complainant issued a legal notice in terms of Section 138 on
21.9.2000. It is also undisputed fact that on 16.11.2000, after issuance of the notice and
non-compliance with its terms, the complainant presented the cheque a fourth time
allegedly on request of the accused petitioner. This time too the cheque was returned and
a second notice was issued before the complaint was filed.
3.

After process was issued by the trial court, the petitioner filed an application

enclosing the copy of the previous notice issued on 21.9.2000. That was admitted by the
complainant. The present petition is premised on the ground that after having issued
legal notice issued on 21.9.2000, the complaint ought to have been filed within the
stipulated period, namely, 30 days from the date of receipt. It is contended that the notice
was received on 23.9.2000. It is contended that the cause of action was lost and that the
fourth presentation of the cheque and the subsequent notice did not permit the filing of
the complaint.
4.

Learned counsel has placed reliance upon the judgments of the Supreme Court

reported as Sadanandan Bhadran vs. Madhavan Sunil Kumar, (1998) 6 SCC 514 as
explained in Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd. vs. Galazy Traders & Agencies Ltd. and Ors.
and the latest judgment of the Court in

Prem Chand Vijay Kumar vs. Yaspal Singh,

(2005) 4 SCC 417. It was contended that once notice under Section 138(b) is received by
the drawer of the cheque, the complaint has to be preferred within the stipulated period,
or else the payee forfeits the right to present the cheque again and the cause of action in
such case is lost even though the right to sue and recover the amount through other
processes may be reserved, if available in accordance with law.

5.

Learned counsel for the respondent complainant opposed the petition and

submitted that the judgment in Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd.(supra) is more apt to the
circumstances of this case. He placed reliance on para 10 of the judgment to say that the
Court should desist from quashing the criminal proceedings after notice has been issued
to the petitioner accused. The more appropriate course would be for the parties to contest
the merits of the case. It was contended that a fresh right had in fact accrued after the
presentation of the cheque on 16.11.2000 and its dishonour which led to issuance of a
second legal notice.
6.

The line of reasoning indicated in Sadanandan Bhadran's case and reiterated/re-

cited in Prem Chand Vijay Kumar's case admits no room for further debate. The
Supreme Court has ruled that the cause of action for the purpose of initiating a complaint
under the Act accrues but once, i. e. the dishonour of the cheque, issuance of the legal
notice which will lead to the filing of the complaint. The ratio of these decisions does not
admit of a second cause of action whereby the payee is permitted to repeatedly present
cheque (after issuance of a notice) and yet claim the right to approach and seek remedy
under the Act. The position, post 2006 amendment might be different. However, that is
not an issue which the Court has to engage itself in these proceedings since admittedly the
cheque in question was issued in the year 2000. The proper course in this case should
have been that after issuance of the notice on 21.9.2000, the complainant could have
approached the court within the stipulated period; he instead presented the cheque yet
again on 16.11.2000, issued a notice thereafter and then filed the complaint much later
on 18th December, 2000. This was clearly way beyond the period of limitation and the
crlmc-957/05

3 of 4

Court could not have taken cognizance under Section 142.
7.

In view of the above findings, the petition is entitled to succeed. Accordingly, the

criminal proceedings arising out of the Complaint Case No. 4203/1/2003 pending in the
court of M/s. Anuradha Shukla, MM, Patiala House, New Delhi and all further
proceedings are hereby quashed. Nothing stated here shall be construed as an expression
on the right of the complainant to initiate such proceedings, as may be available in
accordance with law.
