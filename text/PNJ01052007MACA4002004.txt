PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

On 08.02.1996, deceased aged 40 years died in a road

accident involving bus No.DEP-6261.

He was survived by his

wife, 2 minor sons, a minor daughter and father.
2.

Dependents filed a claim petition under Section 140

read with Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 claiming a
compensation of Rs.10 lacs on account of death of the deceased
in the said vehicular accident.

Father of the deceased died

during the pendency of the claim petition.
3.

After holding driver of the offending bus guilty of rash

and negligent driving, learned Tribunal proceeded to determine
compensation to the dependents.
4.

Wife of the deceased, Santosh Kumari stepped into the

witness box as PW-5 and deposed that her husband was a
MAC.APP.No.400/2004

Page No.1 of 6

transporter and was earning Rs.20,000/- per month at the time
of the accident. She further deposed that deceased had bought
a tempo under the hire purchase agreement from M/s. Singh
Finance Company and was paying an installment of Rs.12,000/per month and that he was earning his livelihood by plying the
said tempo. She placed on record

receipts (Ex.PW5/2 to Ex.

PW5/21) which showed that deceased was paying Rs.11,000/- or
Rs.12,000/- per month as installments. She further deposed that
after death of her husband she sold the said tempo. Delivery
receipt (Ex.PW5/1) showing the sale of said tempo was placed
on record.
5.

Tribunal disbelieved the testimony of the wife of the

deceased that the deceased was a transporter and was earning
Rs.20,000/- per month at the time of the accident. Tribunal did
not place any reliance on the aforenoted receipts for the reason
same were not proved by the person who had issued them.
6.

Relying upon the driving licence of the deceased

(Ex.PW5/22), learned Tribunal held that the deceased was a
tempo driver.

Aid of minimum wages notified under the

Minimum Wages Act was taken by the Tribunal to determine the
monthly income of the deceased at the time of the accident.
Deceased was placed in the category of skilled labourer.
Minimum wages for skilled labourer as on 1.2.1996 was
Rs.2101/- per month.

The same has been adopted as the

monthly income of the deceased at the time of the accident.
7.

Giving benefit of future increase in the income of the

deceased, mean average income of the deceased has been
MAC.APP.No.400/2004

Page No.2 of 6

determined as Rs.3151.50 per month. (Rs.2101 + Rs.4202 ÷2 =
Rs.3151.50). Annual income has been taken as Rs.37,818/-.
8.

Deducting 1/3rd for the personal spending of the

deceased, average loss of dependence has been determined at
Rs.25,212/-.
9.

Wife of the deceased had deposed that deceased was

aged 35 years at the time of the accident. In absence of cogent
evidence showing the age of the deceased, learned Tribunal has
taken the age of the deceased as 40 years on the basis of the
post mortem report (Ex.P-6). Applying multiplier of 16, total loss
of dependence has been determined as Rs.4,03,392/-.
10.

Adding thereto a sum of Rs.10,000/- for loss of love

and affection, Rs.10,000/- for expectancy of the life of the
deceased

and

Rs.2000/-

for

funeral

expenses,

total

compensation awarded to the dependents is Rs.4,35,392/-.
11.

Aggrieved

by

the

amount

of

compensation,

dependents/appellants have filed the present appeal praying for
enhancement of compensation.
12.

Learned counsel for the appellants has challenged the

award on only one count.

Counsel contended that while

determining loss of dependence, Tribunal erred in determining
income of the deceased at the time of the accident on the basis
of minimum wages.
13.

Learned counsel for the appellants contended that

there was ample evidence before the Tribunal showing the
income of the deceased at the time of the accident. He further
contended that the testimony of the wife of the deceased as
MAC.APP.No.400/2004

Page No.3 of 6

also installment receipts, delivery receipt

produced by her

clearly established that deceased was the owner of a tempo and
was earning his livelihood by plying the said tempo.
14.

I agree with the learned counsel for the appellant

inasmuch as the aforenoted installment receipts and delivery
receipt (noted in para 4 above) establish that the deceased had
purchased a tempo under a hire purchase agreement.
15.

Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is a beneficial legislation

intended to provide monetary solace to the dependents of the
victims of the vehicular accident.

Standard of proof required

under this legislation is a liberal one.

The aforenoted

installment receipts and delivery receipt appear to be genuine
documents.

A perusal of the record shows that installment

receipt for each and every month has been placed on record. It
is

proved

beyond

doubt

that

deceased

was

paying

an

installment of Rs.12,000/- per month.
16.

It could reasonably be assumed that deceased was

earning such amount from which he was paying monthly
installment of Rs.12,000/- and was also sustaining himself and
his family. Thus, I consider it reasonable to take income of the
deceased as Rs.18,000/- per month at the time of the accident.
How else could he repay monthly installments of Rs.11,000/-?
17.

However, the fact that deceased was paying an

installment of Rs.12,000/- per month is a relevant fact.
Therefore, his net income at the time of the accident is taken as
Rs.6,000/- per month.
18.

It is relevant to note that source of livelihood of

MAC.APP.No.400/2004

Page No.4 of 6

deceased was an asset which was being depreciated. Surely,
the earnings of the deceased would have risen in the future but
at the same time deceased would have spent a major portions
of his earnings for reinvesting in the capital asset. Thus, I take
net income of the deceased as Rs.6,000/- per month.
19.

Noting the extended family of the deceased and also

the fact that children of the deceased were aged 12 years , 10
years and 8 years respectively at the time of the accident, I
consider deduction of 1/4th for the personal spending of the
deceased as appropriate.

Thus, average loss of dependence

comes to Rs.4500/- per month.
20.

Noting that the deceased was aged 40 years at the

time of the accident, Tribunal has applied multiplier of 16 on the
basis of Second Schedule appended to the Motor Vehicles Act,
1988. Multiplier of 16 applied by the Tribunal is on the higher
side.
21.

In my opinion, multiplier of 11 is reasonable.

Thus,

total loss of dependence comes to Rs.5,94,000/- (Rs.4500 x 12 x
11).
22.

Tribunal has awarded

'loss of dependence'.
enhanced by a

Rs.4,03,392/- under the head

Thus, compensation under this head is

further sum of Rs.1,90,608/- (Rounded of to

Rs.1,90,600/-).
23.

Appeal

stands

disposed

of

by

enhancing

the

compensation by a further sum of Rs.1,90,600/-.
24.

Enhanced compensation shall be paid together with

interest @ 6% p.a. from date of claim petition till date of
