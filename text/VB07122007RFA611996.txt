T.S.THAKUR, J. (oral)
We have heard learned counsel for the parties at some
length and perused the record.

Learned counsel for the

parties agree that the fact situation in which the present
appeal has been filed is similar to the one in RFA No.
745/1995 Smt.

Parkashwati

vs.

Union

of India and

connected matters, disposed of on 17.09.2007. A copy of the
said order has been placed on record by Mr. Poddar, counsel

appearing for the respondent, a perusal whereof shows that
for land acquired in terms of notification dated 31.12.1981 the
amount of compensation payable to land owners
enhanced

to

Rs.27,000/-

statutory benefits.

has been

proportionate

The land of the appellant in the instant

case was also acquired in terms of the very same notification.
It is, therefore, submitted by counsel for the parties that in
terms of the view taken by this Court in Jas Rath v. Union of
India's case 130 (2006) DLT 700 and the reasons set out by
this Court in its order dated 27.04.2006 passed in Smt.
Parkashwati vs. Union of India (supra), this appeal could
be allowed with the direction that the appellant shall also be
entitled

to

compensation

@

27,000/-

per

bigha

with

proportionate statutory benefits in modification of the order
passed by the Reference Court.
We, accordingly, allow this appeal to the limited extent
that instead of Rs.21,000/- per bigha awarded by the
Reference

Court

the

appellant

shall

be

entitled

to

compensation @ Rs.27,000/- per bigha with all proportionate
statutory benefits. Needless to say that the appellants shall
also be entitled to interest on the additional amount in terms
of Section 23(1A) of the Act and the solatium in terms of
decision of the Supreme Court in Sunder v. Union of India

2001 (93) DLT 569, apart from proportionate costs.
