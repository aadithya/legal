SANJIV KHANNA, J:
1.

The appellant Mr. Abdul Qadar has challenged judgment

dated 10th May, 2007 passed by the learned Single Judge
dismissing his W.P. (C) No. 11988/2006. By the said writ petition,
the appellant had prayed for setting aside order dated 15

th

June,

LPA No. 1070/2007

Page 2

2006 passed by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi denying him
allotment of alternative commercial plot.
2.

Properties in Sarai Khalil, Delhi underwent demolition in

1975-76.

Under a policy framed by the respondent-Municipal

Corporation of Delhi, alternative residential/commercial space was
allotted to

persons whose properties were demolished.

For this

purpose, allotments were made on the basis of CID Survey Report.
3.

As per the policy of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi,

persons who were in occupation of area between 41-60 square
metres, were allotted plots of 60 square meters and persons who
were in occupation of area of 61-80 square metres, were allotted
plots of 80 square metres. The CID Survey Report indicated that the
appellant was in occupation of an area of 13”x6” as per serial No.
160 of CID Report, which was being used for commercial purpose.
Similarly, at serial No. 161 of the CID Survey Report, it is recorded
that the appellant was in occupation of three separate tin sheds each
with an occupied area of 13”x22”, which were being used for

LPA No. 1070/2007

Page 3

commercial-cum-residential purposes. On the basis of CID Survey
Report in respect of serial Nos. 160 and 161, the appellant has been
allotted two residential flats Nos. B-5/33-B and B-6/44 at Inderlok, as
he had a large family consisting of 12 members. In addition, he has
been allotted a commercial plot of 40 square metres bearing No. 393
at Shahzada Bagh.

The appellant, admits that additionally another

commercial plot of 40 square metres bearing No. 164, Phase II,
Shahzada Bagh stands allotted to the appellant by the respondent
Corporation vide it's letter dated 12th August, 2004 on payment of
consideration of Rs.20,992/-. Thus, in all, the appellant has been
allotted two residential flats and two commercial plots of 40 square
metres each, totalling 80 square metres.
4.

The appellant is, however, not satisfied. He claims further

allotment should be made to him as he was also in occupation of
property mentioned at CID Survey No. 159. As per the said Survey
Report, the said property was in occupation of Mr. Abdul Wahab, the
brother of the appellant.

The said property was being used for

LPA No. 1070/2007

Page 4

residential purpose. Mr. Abdul Wahab has been allotted residential
flat bearing No. A-10/77-C, Inderlok on the basis of entry No. 159 in
the Survey Report.
5.

The principal and main basis of the claim of the appellant is
th

based upon order dated 13 October, 2003, which was passed in
W.P. (C) No. 4496/2001. A reading of the said order shows that the
learned Judge had referred to the claim of the appellant that he was
entitled to a plot of 120 square metres but had been allotted a
commercial plot of 40 square metres and there was no reason
available on record why the claim of the appellant was rejected. The
learned Single Judge noticed that initially it appeared that the
department had noted that the entitlement of the appellant was 120
square meters.

In these circumstances, learned Single Judge

directed as under:“In my considered view, the Committee must
examine the case of the Petitioner on merits
and the policy making the alternative allotment
shall be uniformly applied to all cases. The
Petitioner cannot be prejudice by the mere
pendency of the case for a longer period of

LPA No. 1070/2007

Page 5

time and that cannot be a ground to reject the
case of the petitioner.”

6.

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi examined the claim of

the appellant again and has admittedly now made further allotment of
commercial plot of 40 square metres in terms of their policy. In other
words plots of 80 square meters have been alloted. While doing so,
MCD has now given reasons and explained that as per the CID
Survey Report at serial No. 159, it was specifically mentioned that the
property mentioned therein was occupied by Mr. Abdul Wahab and
was being used for residential purpose. On this basis, Mr. Abdul
Wahab was allotted a separate property. The appellant therefore
cannot claim allotment on basis of entry at serial No. 159 of the CID
Survey Report. The Committee also noticed that the appellant had
been allotted two residential flats and this allotment was made taking
into consideration the residential component of 13”x22” and the exact
commercial entitlement was worked out after excluding the
residential entitlement, which had been granted to the appellant. CID

LPA No. 1070/2007

Page 6

Survey Report has been acted upon and allotments have been made
in terms thereof.
7.

In view of the facts and circumstances stated above, we find

no merit in the present appeal and the same is dismissed. No Costs.
