1. The present petition has been filed challenging the order

short, ‘MM’), Delhi dismissing the complaint cases (being CC

876/01)

Crl. Rev. P. No. 423/2007

Page No. 1 of 7

petitioner has challenged this order only in respect of the
dismissal of CC 875/01.
2. The petitioner claims to have purchased small plants of
Safaida trees from Mehta Nursery and Mahavir Nursery in the
year 1986 and planted the same on his plots in Khasra nos.
539/01 and 539/02 at Mahipalpur, New Delhi stated to be
owned by his wife. The plants over time grew into trees. The
petitioner filed a criminal complaint (being CC 875/01)
alleging that the respondents cut down safaida trees on the
night of 11/12-07-1999. It was also claimed that the Forest
Department had issued a show cause notice to all the
respondents (respondents 2-6 herein).
3. Pursuant to the said complaint, the learned MM ordered an
inquiry under s. 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
(hereinafter referred to as ‘Cr. P.C’). The petitioner alleges
that although the report stated that the trees had been felled
and taken away, process was not issued. It is also claimed
that CW 2 being the Assistant Conservation Officer, Forest
Department found that the trees had been cut and held the
respondents guilty of so doing.
4. The learned MM directed a status report by the SHO, Vasant
Kunj with regard to the persons informing the complainant of
the cutting down of the trees; the proceedings conducted by
the forest department; enquiries made by the metrological
department regarding the occurrence of a storm and the
intensity thereof on the night of the alleged cutting of trees
or on 17.06.99, 06.07.99 and 19.07.1999 and; in case of the
occurrence of a storm, whether the same of sufficient

Crl. Rev. P. No. 423/2007

Page No. 2 of 7

intensity to uproot the trees. The report was also to mention
whether any trees had been seized, and whether according to
the forest department, the same had been uprooted or cut
down.
5. The petitioner alleges that the report of the metrological
department shows that there was no storm of such intensity
to cause uprooting/falling of the trees. It is further claimed
that the forest department has penalized the accused and
directed them to any a fine of Rs. 2700/-. The Petitioner
submitted that the statements of Sh. Mahender Singh, Sh.
Mahabir Singh, Smt. Shakuntala Devi and HC Vijay Pal
supported his case. The petitioner has thus prayed for the
setting aside of the impugned order.
6. A perusal of the impugned order shows that the learned MM
had noted that the information collected by the Metrological
Department shows that there was a dust storm of a speed of
41Km/ hr occurred on 11.07.1999 but it gave no opinion on
whether the same was sufficient to uproot any tree. It was
however admitted that there was no expertise with the
department to ascertain the wind speed required to uproot
13-14 year old Eucalyptus trees.
7. The order also takes note of the statement of HC Vijaypal
who has visited the spot on 15-07-1999 and found that some
trees had fallen down of which 10-15 trees were in cut
position and that local inquiry revealed that because of rains
and storm some trees had fallen on the electric cables as a
result of which electric cables snapped.

8. A letter dated 29.09.2004 of the Deputy Conservator of
Forests noted that on an inspection of the site of the offence
by the forest guard on 06.08.1999, it was found that four
Eucalyptus trees were broken from the upper side and two
had been cut.
9. The learned MM was of the view that the findings of the
forest guard and the statement of the Head Constable
indicated a situation where the trees may have broken or fell
due to strong winds and that the trees had to be cut in order
to restore the electricity. Another aspect taken note of by the
learned MM is that the pre summoning Complainant’s
Evidence brought to light that there were about 180
Eucalyptus trees but neither of the reports indicated that
those numbers of trees were cut down.

Also, nothing has

been placed on record to show that the trees were sold or
transported to some place or were found lying at the site.
10. It was thus found that there is nothing on record to show
that

theft

was

committed

by

the

accused

persons.

Proceedings by the tree officer under s. 21 of the Delhi
Preservation of Trees Act, 1994 in respect of the limited
number of trees alleged to have been cut down were
pending. The evidence for summoning the accused persons
under ss. 379/452 IPC was found to be grossly deficient.
11. The impugned order has also dealt with CC 876/01 alleging
that three bills (nos. 460,396 and 376) of Mehta Nursery as
well as other bills had been forged/manipulated by the
petitioner and used as evidence in CC 875/01. The order
notes that the affidavit of CW-1, manager of Mehta nursery

Crl. Rev. P. No. 423/2007

Page No. 4 of 7

shows that the bills were neither issued by him or his staff
but it had not been stated as to whether he was the manager
at the time when the plants were stated to have been
purchased or whether the format of the letterhead of the
Nursery in that year was the same as CW1/B. This evidence
was thus found by the learned MM to be grossly deficient.
The learned MM has noted that several cases were pending
between the parties in respect of the said khasra numbers.
12. The aforesaid shows that the learned MM has thoroughly
examined the evidence on record. The statements of the HC
Vijaypal and the inspection report of the forest guard, as
noted by the learned MM indicate that a few trees had fallen
down and some appeared to be cut. Both reports however
mention a different number of trees as having been cut or
having fallen. The complainants’ evidence on the other hand
is to the effect that there were about 180 trees on the said
plots and that trees had been cut. While the statements of
the complainant and Sh. Mahender Singh do not mention the
number of trees alleged to have been cut, the statements of
CW1 (20.11.2000) and Sh. Mahabir Singh are to the effect
that 159 trees had been cut by the accused persons. The
reports of HC Vijaypal and the Forest Guard, as noted by the
learned MM do not indicate that such a large number of trees
had been cut or had even fallen down. The proceedings
before the assistant conservator of forests are also in respect
of a small number of trees (i.e., two four trees alleged to be
fallen and two trees alleged to have been cut).

Crl. Rev. P. No. 423/2007

Page No. 5 of 7

13. The evidence placed on record does not show that the trees
were removed from the premises. The evidence on record
also does not show that any number of trees had been
recovered from the property in question or elsewhere.
14. Insofar as the reports of the Metrological department in
respect of the storm are concerned, the reports state that the
storms stated to have occurred on 11.07.1999 was of a speed
of 41 Km per hr but they were unable to give an opinion on
whether the same was sufficient to uproot the trees or the
wind speed required for trees to have been cut. The
inspection reports of HC Vijaypal and the forest guard
however mention both trees that had fallen as well as trees
that had been cut.
15. Another factor to be taken note of is that the evidence on
record does not show that the trees had been stolen by the
accused persons.
16. This Court, while exercising revisional jurisdiction merely
conserves the power to see that justice is done in accordance
with the recognized rules of criminal jurisprudence and that
its subordinate courts do not exceed their jurisdiction or
abuse the power vested in them under the Cr. P.C. or to
prevent miscarriage of justice. The revisional power of the
High Court cannot be exercised as a second appellate court.
17. There are also several disputes noted to be pending
between parties in respect of the property (being khasra nos.
539/01 and 539/02). In fact the respondents had also filed a
criminal complaint against the petitioner alleging forging by
the petitioner of the receipts issued by Mehta Nursery which

Crl. Rev. P. No. 423/2007

Page No. 6 of 7

complaint was also dismissed by the impugned order dated
15-03-2008 for want of evidence. It appears, as the learned
MM has also noted that the criminal complaints by the
petitioner and respondents arose as a result of the disputes
already pending between them. The Apex Court in All Cargo
Movers (I) Pvt. Ltd & Ors v. Dhanesh Badarmal Jain and Anr.
AIR 2008 SC 247, relying on the decisions in Indian Oil
Corporation v. NEPC India Ltd. & Ors. (2006) 6 SCC 736 and
G. Sagar Suri v. State of U.P. AIR 2000 SC 754, has frowned
upon criminal proceedings being used as an arm twisting
technique where the matters are purely civil in nature.
18. The evidence before the learned MM was insufficient for
summons to be issued and the learned MM has been mindful
of the fact that at the pre-trial stage of framing of notice in a
private complaint, the Court only has to see that from the
evidence and material placed on record, there is a prima
facie case made out against the accused. It does not have to
make a roving inquiry into the pros and cons of the matter
and weigh the evidence as if conducting a trial. In my
considered view, the trial court has discharged its function of
sifting through the material on record to come to the
conclusion that there was insufficient material on record to
issue summons and thus I find no error in the impugned order
for this court to interfere with the same.
19. Dismissed.
