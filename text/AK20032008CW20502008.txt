1.

The petitioner has impugned the award dated 4th December, 2002

dismissing the claim of the petitioner/workman on the ground of

WP(C) No.2050/2008

Page 1 of 6

abandonment of the proceedings by the workman with effect from 2nd
December, 2002.

2.

The petitioner/workman alleged that he was employed with the

management since July 1986 as a general worker with the last drawn
salary of Rs.1800/- per month. He pleaded that he was not rendered
normal legal facilities and on demand being raised, his salary was
withheld and his services were terminated on 30th July, 1996 without
any charge sheet.

The petitioner issued a demand notice dated 31st

July, 1996 but the same was not replied.

The petitioner raised

conciliation proceedings and thereafter the reference in the following
terms was made by the appropriate Government:
“Whether the services of Sh.Laxmi Kant Yadav have been
terminated
illegally
and/or
unjustifiably
by
the
management and if so, to what relief is he entitled and what
directions are necessary in this?”

3.

The respondent/management was served after the claim was filed

by the workman, however, no one had appeared and therefore an exparte

award

was

passed

against

the

respondent.

The

respondent/management thereafter filed an application dated 27th May,
2000 seeking setting aside of the award dated 10th December, 1999. On
behalf of the workman, his authorized representative appeared and filed
a reply.

The Labour Court after considering the application of the

respondent/management for setting aside the ex parte award and the
WP(C) No.2050/2008

Page 2 of 6

reply filed on behalf of the petitioner/workman set aside the award
dated 10th December, 1999.

4.

After the ex parte award was set aside, the management was

again proceeded ex parte in the proceedings before the Labor Court on
3rd September, 2002 as no one had appeared on behalf of management
and the case was adjourned to 2nd December, 2002.

After the

management was proceeded ex parte on 3rd September, 2002, an
application was filed on behalf of management on 9th September, 2002
for setting aside the ex parte award which application was fixed for 2nd
December, 2002.

Since no one appeared on 2nd December, 2002 on

behalf of the petitioner, it was held that the petitioner is not interested
in agitating his claim and, therefore, it was held that the petitioner is
not entitled for any relief and consequently the award dated 4th
December, 2002 was passed.

5.

From 4th

December, 2002, no steps were taken by the

petitioner/workman till 2007 when a notice dated 5th February, 2007
was given for implementation of award dated 10th December, 1999
which had already been set aside on 4th May, 2002.

Thereafter an

application for setting aside the award dated 4th December, 2002 was
filed which was withdrawn by the petitioner on 31st May, 2007 and
thereafter the present petition has been filed on 5th March, 2008.

6.

The award dated 4th December, 2004 was passed as no one had

appeared on behalf of petitioner and it was held that the petitioner is
not interested in agitating his claim. The petitioner in the writ petition
has not given any cogent or sufficient reasons for not taking any steps
from 4th December, 2002 till February, 2007 when the alleged notice
was given on behalf of petitioner for implementation of the award dated
10th December, 1999 which had already been set aside by order dated
4th May, 2002.

7.

The petitioner has contended that he was totally ignorant about

setting aside of the award dated 10th December, 1999 and he used to
contact his authorized representative from time to time. The petitioner
has contended that he remained unemployed.

8.

It is unbelievable that for almost five years the petitioner did not

come to know that no proceedings were pending in the Court despite
the fact that the petitioner remained unemployed. In the circumstances
not taking any steps in the proceedings and merely relying on the
alleged statement of the authorized representative will not constitute
sufficient cause.

9.

The petitioner had filed an application under Order IX Rule 13 in

May 2007 which was withdrawn on 31st May, 2007. The writ petition,
thereafter, has been filed almost after nine months and no cogent
WP(C) No.2050/2008

Page 4 of 6

reason or explanation has been given by the petitioner for filing the writ
petition after about nine months.

10.

When an application was filed by the management for setting

aside the award dated 10th December, 1999, a reply was filed on behalf
of the petitioner. The averment of the petitioner that he had not filed
the reply also seems to be a bald allegation without any further
particulars.

In case the reply was not filed by the petitioner to the

application of the management for setting aside the ex parte award
dated 10th December, 1999, and the reply was fabricated by the
authorized representative, the petitioner ought to have taken some
steps against his authorized representative. From the writ petition and
the averments made therein, it is apparent that there are no averments
and pleas regarding any action being taken by the petitioner against his
authorized representative for allegedly filing a reply without consent of
the petitioner and misleading him. In any case, it is unbelievable that
the petitioner shall not ascertain the stage of proceedings and will not
appear in the court for almost six years.

In the circumstances, the

petitioner has not been able to make out sufficient cause for his nonappearance on 2nd December, 2002 which led to passing of an award
dated 4th October, 2002 dismissing the claim of the petitioner and not
taking any steps thereafter for such a long time.

11.

While exercising its powers of judicial review under Article 226 of

the Constitution of India this Court is not to re-appreciate the evidence.
It is a settled position of law that in exercise of jurisdiction under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, the Court does not interfere with
factual findings of the lower courts and restrain itself from reappreciating evidence while exercising powers of judicial review. The
objective of judicial review is to ascertain that a person received a fair
treatment and objective is not to re-appreciate the entire pleas and
evidence and draw inferences again. The findings and inferences of the
Labor Court are based on evidence and documents on record and there
does not appear to be any manifest errors in them. Judicial review is
not an appeal from a decision but a review of the manner in which the
decision is made. Power of judicial review is meant to ensure that the
individual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that the conclusion
which the authority reaches is necessarily correct in the eye of the
Court.

12.

The petitioner in the facts and circumstances, is not entitled for

invocation of jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India and the writ petition is, therefore, without any
merit and it is dismissed.
