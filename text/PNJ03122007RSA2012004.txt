1.

In the appeal, following substantial questions of law

have been framed by the appellant :“A. What amount of damages and for how much
period can be awarded to any employee
whose probation period of six months was not
completed and his services were terminated?
B.

Can the damages of more than Rs.1,56,000/be awarded in favour of a probationer
employee whose services were terminated
during the probation period?

C.

Whether the employee is entitled to grant of
damages for unlimited period?

D.

2.

Whether the employee is entitled to damages
w.e.f. the date of his termination of service
despite the facts that the suit for grant of
damages was instituted after more than two
and a half years?”
As would be noted from the facts here-in-after noted,

none of the questions framed arises for consideration. In fact
the appellant has been roaming in the corridors of this Court in
a most cavalier fashion.

The order which is impugned, i.e.

order dated 19.2.2004 has declined to condone the delay in
filing a regular first appeal against the judgment dated
26.3.2001 and decree dated 1.6.2001 passed by the learned
Civil Judge. As a consequence of not condoning the delay in
filing the appeal, the appeal has been dismissed as time
barred. Thus, even to a layman it would be apparent that issue
which has to be decided

in the second appeal is whether

learned Appellate Judge was correct in holding that no sufficient
cause was shown entitling the appellant to have the delay
condoned.
3.

In view of the fact that in the appeal no substantial

question of law has been framed relating to the real issue which
arises for consideration, I would have dismissed the appeal on
this short ground but since consequences of not condoning
delay is deprivation of a substantive right, I considered it
appropriate to peruse the record and independently satisfy
RSA No.201/2004

Page No.2 of 8

myself whether sufficient cause was shown to the learned
Appellate Judge when a belated appeal was filed, entitling
appellant to have the delay condoned in filing the first appeal.
Appellant had suffered a money decree passed by a learned
Civil Judge vide judgment dated 26.3.2001.

The decree was

drawn up on 1.6.2001.
4.

Appeal therefrom was to be filed before the learned

Senior Civil Judge. The appellant filed an appeal in the Delhi
High Court which was returned informing appellant that the
appeal had to be filed before the learned Senior Civil Judge.
5.

Appellant took back the appeal and filed the same in

the appropriate court and along there with sought delay to be
condoned in filing the appeal. It was stated in the application
that pertaining to the judgment dated 23.1.2001 the decree
was drawn up on 1.6.2001. That the appellant thought that the
appeal had to be filed in the High Court. He thought that period
of limitation was 90 days and accordingly applied for a certified
copy of the judgment and decree on 10.7.2001. Certified copy
of judgment and decree was made available on 12.7.2001.
Appeal was filed in the Delhi High Court on 10.8.2001. It was
listed for hearing on 20.8.2001 but was returned to be filed
before the learned Senior Civil Judge. The appeal was filed on
27.8.2001.
RSA No.201/2004

6.

The learned Appellate Court noted that the judgment

was delivered on 26.3.2001 but the decree was prepared on
1.6.2001.

Thus it was held that for purposes of appeal

limitation would commence with effect from 2.6.2001.
7.

Noting that in the application seeking delay to be

condoned there was no averment as to what led the appellant
to believe that the appeal could be filed in Delhi High Court,
learned Appellate Court held that no case was made out to
condone the delay in filing the appeal.
8.

Before I deal with the reasoning of the first Appellate

Court certain more facts pertaining to conduct of the appellant
in the present appeal needs to be noted.
9.

The instant appeal was filed on 26.5.2004.

The

appeal was returned by the registry with as many as 8
objections. Appellant was granted a week's time to re-file the
appeal. Far from re-filing the appeal within a week, the appeal
was re-filed on 20.8.2004.

Not all objections were removed.

The appeal was returned the very same day, i.e. 20.8.2004
informing appellant that all objections were not removed. The
appeal was taken back and re-filed on 28.8.2004. Once again,
all objections were not removed. Continued deficiencies which
existed were pointed out to the appellant on 28.8.2004 itself.
The appeal was thereafter properly filed on 3.9.2004. Thus, for
RSA No.201/2004

Page No.4 of 8

purposes of proper filing the instant appeal could well be taken
to have filed on 3.9.2004.
10.

Not only that.

Reckoned as having been filed on

26.5.2004 the appeal in this court is admittedly delayed by 4
days.
11.

In the month of August 2005 when said fact was

brought to the notice of counsel for the appellant he filed an
application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act praying that
delay in filing the instant appeal be condoned. The said
application was defective. It was returned by the registry for refiling after removing objections. Till date, the appellant has not
bothered to re-file the said application.
12.

Afore-noted facts reveal a most callous approach.

The negligence of the appellant borders on culpability.

The

conduct of the appellant does not show that the appellant is a
bona fide litigant.
13.

Further, as noted above the draftsman of the appeal

is just not aware of the issue which has to be urged in the
appeal.

As noted above, questions of law sought to be

projected relate to the merits of the judgment and decree
passed by the learned Trial Judge whereas issue which has to
be decided is whether appellant was entitled to have the delay
condoned in filing the first appeal before the first Appellate
RSA No.201/2004

Judge.
14.

The hierarchy of courts in Delhi is as under :-

(A)

At the lowest level are civil Courts. The pecuniary
jurisdiction of civil courts is upto Rs.3 lacs.

(B)

Next above are the courts presided over by District
and Additional District Judges.

(C)

Next above is the High Court.

15.

Appeals against judgment and decrees passed by

Civil Judges are filed before the learned Senior Civil Judge which
are assigned to different Additional District Judges for hearing.
16.

This hierarchy of courts is known to one and all

practitioners of law in Delhi.
17.

On what basis was the appellant and/or its counsel

misdirected in thinking that the first appeal against the
judgment dated 26.3.2001 and the decree dated 1.6.2001 was
to be filed in Delhi High Court has just not been explained
either in the application filed by the appellant under Section 5
of the Limitation Act before the learned Additional District Judge
or even in the instant appeal.
18.

In the decision reported as AIR 1933 Lahore 568

Uttam Chand Vs. Vishan Dass it was held that a legal advisor's
mistake to justify extension of limitation must be a bona fide
one, i.e., it must be done with due care and attention. In the
RSA No.201/2004

Page No.6 of 8

decision reported as AIR 1938 Lahore Shri Amrit Lal Vs. Phool
Chand a similar view was taken. It was held that a mistaken
advice of counsel is not sufficient to justify extension of time
being granted under Section 5 of the Limitation Act unless the
advice was given in good faith, i.e. with due care and attention.
Hon'ble Supreme Court expressed its view in the report
published as AIR 1970 SC 1953 Mata Din. V. A. Narayanan be
observed as under :-

19.

“The law is settled that mistake of counsel may in
certain circumstances be taken into account in
condoning delay although there is no general
proposition that mistake of counsel by itself is
always a sufficient ground. It is always a question
whether the mistake was bona fide or was merely a
device to cover an ulterior purpose such as laches
on the part of the litigant or an attempt to save
limitation in an underhand way.”
In the absence of any explanation or a statement

either in the application seeking delay to be condoned or even
in the instant appeal as to what misled the appellant or the
counsel in filing the first appeal in this Court whereas the same
ought to have been filed in the District Courts, an inevitable
consequence has to be that the finding returned by the learned
Appellate Judge has to be confirmed.
20.

Before concluding I may express my anguish at the

way in which appellant has conducted itself in the present
appeal. As noted above, a defective appeal was filed in May,
2004. As against a week's time granted for delay to be
RSA No.201/2004

Page No.7 of 8

condoned in filing the appeal the appeal was re-filed after
nearly 4 months and that too defective. Twice further it had to
be returned for removing objections.

The appellant has

persisted with a callous approach towards the procedure of the
law. Such a litigant is not entitled to any indulgence.
21.

I am conscious of the fact that law requires every

attempt to be made to interpret procedural laws in a manner
that substantive rights are not nullified on technicalities but at
the same time where it is apparent that a party repeatedly
breaches procedural laws it forfeits the right to an equitable
consideration for the reason delay itself defeats equity.
22.

The appeal is dismissed.

23.

No costs.

24.

LCR be returned.
