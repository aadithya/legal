GITA MITTAL, J.
1.

By this judgment, I propose to dispose of a bunch of writ

petitions all laying a challenge to a decision taken by the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi (referred to as MCD hereafter) to transfer all
Community Toilet Complexes (hereinafter referred to as CTCs) constructed
by it and under its jurisdiction for operation and maintenance to the Sulabh
International Social Service Organisations (referred to as Sulabh for
brevity) and cancellation of the agreements with the petitioners and other
Non-Governmental Agencies (referred to as NGOs) to whom they were
handed over for operation and maintenance. The challenge has been laid
primarily on grounds of violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India
so far as the decision to hand over the CTCs to Sulabh is concerned while
the cancellation of the allotments of the NGOs is challenged on grounds of
arbitrariness, malafide, illegality and violation of principles of natural
3

WP(C) No.10685/2004

justice.

Sanitation is undoubtedly a basic service which is a right which

must be ensured to every citizen, be it an adult or a child.

Sanitation is a

felt need while hygiene is important to health. This is a service which needs
to be imperatively maintained at the community level. While those who are
poor cannot pay for the provision and maintenance of the basic service
provided to them, a completely free service runs the risk of the service not
being valued at all and even be misused.

Community participation in

planning, construction and maintenance of such like services ensures that
the community values it and will use it. Contribution to creation of such
facilities may be by dispensation of finance, real estate, labour or service.
When people do not have the time to contribute labour or otherwise to the
construction, operation and maintenance, they are required to pay a charge
for the service. A small contribution, no matter how small, is often a
confirmation of the value of a service to the people and their willingness to
maintain it.

In developing nations, the problem is more aggravated,

inasmuch as it is necessary even to educate and inculcate the habit of using
a toilet in people who have never seen the facility. This lack of information
and knowledge however exacerbates the problems which are faced by
metropolitan cities to which people from remote corners of the country
migrate without any idea of sanitation facilities or basic hygiene.
In certain countries, much has been done to generate
enlightenment about private toilets even in remote villages. My attention

4

WP(C) No.10685/2004

has been drawn to a good practice example which is to be found from
Bangladesh where large NGOs provide the material for constructing a
latrine but the beneficiary family, however poor, finds the time to construct
the soak pit and the walls (often of thatch material and bamboo). BRAC, an
NGO in Bangladesh has created an entire movement for sanitising entire
villages based on this type of participation by the users of the service
themselves. Some other agencies even give material on credit, of about 600
taka and recover it slowly over several years. This is not a significant
burden on the family, but works as a mechanism through which people
actually demand and value basic services.
3.

The pressure on this city has been always in tremendous. Large

numbers from all over the country descend in droves upon Delhi in search
of employment or other opportunities and never leave. It is to address the
basic needs of such persons who have no permanent abodes that the civic
authorities including the Municipal Corporation of Delhi have had to
concentrate, conceptualise and develop common toilet complexes which
provides both toilet and bathroom facilities for the community.
4.

Over the years, several modules of the operation and

maintenance of these common toilet complexes (hereinafter referred to as
'CTCs') have been tested by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi which is
the primary body concerned with health, sanitation, sewerage and other
areas relating to provision of civic amenities and facilities to the citizens of
Delhi. As the present matter impugns the actions of this body, consideration

5

WP(C) No.10685/2004

is confined to this civic authority, which for brevity is referred to as the
`MCD'.

Perspective
5.

In order to appreciate the issues raised in the present writ

petition, it becomes necessary to see the historical perspective of the
experience of the corporation in this behalf. These can be divided into six
stages and modules which briefly put, would be as hereunder:(a) Between 1988 to 1994, CTCs numbering 124 were got constructed by
MCD from Sulabh at the cost of the MCD.

This non-governmental

organisation was paid the estimated cost of the construction on market rate;
cost of boring the tubewell; and 12.5% of the implementation charges.
They were given to Sulabh on pay and use basis for a period of 30 years.
Electricity, water charges and cleaning of the septic tank of the CTC was the
responsibility of the MCD.

The salient features of the operation and

maintenance terms of these CTCs were that the NGO was to run them on the
'pay and use basis' for a period of thirty years. These complexes were
known as the 'Sulabh Shauchalya's'.
Sulabh was thus responsible for 124 CTCs on these terms.
(b).

Between 1994-2000, the Slum & JJ Department has delegated

207 CTCs to other NGOs on the same terms. These 207 CTCs were known
as the 'Jan Suvidha Complexes'.
It is noteworthy that no complaint in respect of either the

6

WP(C) No.10685/2004

operation or the maintenance or the management by either Sulabh of these
124 Sulabh Sauchalayas or the other NGOs who are running operating
maintaining and managing the 207 Jan Suvidha Complexes has been
brought to the notice of the MCD or has been placed before this Court.
(ii)

Between 1975 and 1980 construction of 66 CTCs was carried out

by the MCD as per usual contract procedures through contractors and
handed

over for further maintenance to the Conservation & Sanitation

Engineering Department for further maintenance with effect from 1992
onwards.

These toilets have been called as the 'Jan Suvidha Toilet

Complexes'. In the year 1990, these 66 CTCs were handed over to Sulabh
for a contract of one year which was to be extendable upto 5 years. As per
the agreement between the MCD and M/s Sulabh, the MCD was required to
make annual payment of Rs.1000/- per WC seat per bathroom plus per bath
room on account of annual repairs to Sulabh in respect of these toilets. The
MCD was also responsible for payment of electricity and water
consumption as well as cleaning of the septic tanks. They were to be
operated by Sulabh on pay and use basis.
(iii).

The third category consists of the 84 CTCs constructed by the

Slum & JJ Department, then of the DDA, during the period 1984 to 1990 in
Jhuggi Jhompri Clusters and were transferred in 1992 from the DDA to the
Conservation & Sanitation Engineering Department of the MCD for further
maintenance. Eighty four such CTCs were handed over to Sulabh for a
period of 30 years on the same terms as the earlier 66 CTCs. MCD also

7

WP(C) No.10685/2004

undertook to pay Rs.1000/- per WC seat plus per bathroom annually on
account of annual repairs to the NGO.

In addition, the MCD was

responsible for bearing electricity and water consumption charges and
cleaning of the septic tank was also the responsibility of the MCD.
The MCD has not placed the expenditure that it has incurred on
the payments which were effected to Sulabh on these agreements or the
electricity, water and cleaning of the septic tank. However the petitioners
have placed information before this Court to the effect that the MCD was
allegedly paying an amount of Rs.97,66,000/- each year to Sulabh towards
the Rs.1000/- per seat per WC per bathroom amount.

Even these

agreements were for a period of thirty years in favour of Sulabh and the user
was on 'pay and use' basis.
(iv).

The fourth category of CTCs was constructed by the Slum & JJ

Department through contractors during the period 1994 onwards. 166 CTCs
were so constructed. MCD had decided to hand over their operation and
maintenance to NGOs on a licence fee basis. Consequently allocation was
made by tenders for a period of one to three years on licence fee basis to
NGOs, CBOs and local residents etc. As per the agreement entered into by
the MCD and the allottees for the operation and maintenance of these CTCs,
they were to be operated on 'pay and use basis'. Additionally the
NGO/allottee was responsible for all repairs including the day to day
maintenance upkeep; the annual repairs as well as maintenance etc. The
NGO was also responsible for payment of the electricity and water

8

WP(C) No.10685/2004

consumption charges as well as the maintenance and cleaning of the septic
tank.
Thus the MCD had clearly abdicated all responsibilities of
running and maintenance of these CTCs to the NGOs.
The petitioners have pointed out that so far as these 166 CTCs
are concerned, 30 NGOs were successful in securing contracts with the
MCD for the operation and maintenance of these CTCs. These 30 NGOs
included 7 organisations which, according to the petitioners, are sister
concerns of Sulabh. The petitioners have contended that the MCD has
collected substantial amount as licence fee from these NGOs. Additionally,
there is no complaint whatsoever in respect of the running and operation
and maintenance of these CTCs ever since they were allotted and handed
over to the NGOs.
The MCD however is silent in all its assertions with regard to the
amount that it had earned from these CTCs and no information in this behalf
has been placed even before this Court.
(v).

The fifth category of the CTCs are the 357 complexes which are

being operated, managed and maintained by the MCD itself. There is no
dispute that the MCD has a large infrastructure of personnel as well as the
requisite infrastructure and has been successfully operating these CTCs
through its own staff. The benefit to the citizens is that these CTCs were
being operated on a free of charge basis.

The MCD has the total

responsibility for these complexes. Obviously there is no complaint with

9

WP(C) No.10685/2004

regard to the operation and maintenance of these 357 CTCs.
6.

In the year 1999, the Commissioner MCD asked the Additional

Commissioner Engineering to prepare a white paper on the management and
maintenance of the Jan Suvidha Complexes. He joined in consultation, the
Additional Commissioner(S&JJ), Additional Commissioner(HQ), Engineerin-Chief and the Director(Sanitation)-I.

This matter also came up for

discussion in the meeting of the Standing Committee on 15.09.1999.
Thereafter the Commissioner also issued some instructions recording that in
the last Standing Committee meeting, services provided by Sulabh were
discussed at length where after a three member committee was decided to be
constituted which was to be headed by Shri Vishnu Swaroop Sharma,
Additional Commissioner(Engineering). In addition, Shri Manjeet Singh,
Additional Commissioner(S&JJ) and Shri K.S.Sandhu, Director(Sanitation)I were to be the members of the Committee to go into the entire functioning
of

the

system

including

the

agreement

signed

with

Sulabh,

maintenance/services provided by them, offers by NGOs etc. and to submit
a comprehensive report so that the future course of action could be
discussed.
7.

This Vishnu Swaroop Sharma Committee visited eight Jan

Suvidha Complex for inspection on 13.10.1999.
8.

Incidently five of the complexes visited by the Committee were

being maintained by Sulabh for which the MCD was paying the amount of
Rs.1000/- per WC per bathroom per annum for the maintenance.

10

WP(C) No.10685/2004

All

aspects of the matter including the status of these complexes, agreements
concerning the CTCs, offers received from other social service
organisations, objections and explanations rendered by Sulabh to the
objections raised by the committee and the comments of the sanitation
department of the MCD on the explanation rendered by Sulabh were taken
into consideration. After a detailed consideration, several recommendations
were given by this committee and a model agreement was also suggested.
The committee took into consideration the following basics while preparing
its report :“(a) Status of Sulabh Shauchalayas and Jan Suvidha
Complexes.
(b) Terms and conditions of the agreements executed with
NGOs for the maintenance of these complexes.
(c) Shortcomings noted in these agreements.
(d) Drafting of a model agreement recommended to be
executed with the NGOs in future.
(e) Inspection of certain complexes/shauchalayas in order
to ascertain how far the terms and conditions of the
agreements are being adhered to.

9.

(f) The statement of M/s. Sulabh International appeared in
the press commenting on the discussion held in the
meeting of the Standing Committee and the department's
report thereon.”
The findings of the committee as given in its report read thus:“1. In all the Jan Suvidha Complexes the caretakers were
found collecting “Use Charges” @ Rs.1/- per use from
the users. At the counter it was displayed on the wall
“USE CHARGES-Re.1/-”. This is against the terms and
conditions of the agreements.
2. Live electric wires were lying loose and at some places
11

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the wires were naked causing chances of electrocution.
Wiring at the meter and switch box was also seen in a
dangerous condition.
3. Several toilets were without doors. Many doors were
broken and in most of the doors there was no bolt from
inside. A person using the toilet cannot close the door
from inside and as such there was no privacy.
4. Structural maintenance was very poor. Plaster of the
walls was seen damaged and peeled at several places.
5. It appeared that the complexes have not been white
washed for years together.
6. On interrogation the caretakers of the complexes
informed that they had been requesting the persons who
come to collect money on behalf of the maintenance
agency for carrying out necessary repairs but nobody
bothered.
7. Troughs made for washing hands were without taps.
8. Drains were found choked.
9. The sanitation condition was also not found upto the
mark as a number of seats were found choked emitting
stinking smell.
10. The environment of the complexes was not healthy.
The open set-back area was found generally dirty. No
plantation was seen there.
11. In one Jan Suvidha Complex, on interrogation, the
ladies told that they were allowed to wash their clothes in
bathrooms on payment of Rs.2-3 depending upon the
number of clothes to be washed. This is, as a matter of
fact, misuse of water.
12. The caretakers informed that they were being paid
Rs.900/- p.m. by the maintenance agency apart from daily
expenses varying from Rs.10/- to Rs.30/-.
Some photographs were taken during the
course of inspection. These photographs can be seen in
the following pages which tell about the poor
maintenance of these Jan Suvidha Complexes.”
12

WP(C) No.10685/2004

10.

This committee considered and compared various provisions/

clauses of the other agreements which had been entered into by Sulabh.
After a detailed consideration the Committee proposed a “model
agreement”.

Amongst others, the terms and conditions included the

allocation of the CTCs for management operation and maintenance to
different parties for a period of three years which could be extended with
the mutual consent of parties by adopting the open tender process. The
committee proposed a deposit of earnest money @ 2.5% of the tender
amount to be worked out for a contract period of one year @ Rs.150 per
WC per bath per urinal per month at the time of purchase of tender. This
amount was required to be adjusted as a security deposit for the tenderer
whose tender is ultimately accepted by the MCD. In the event of inability to
carry out the work, this amount was liable to be forfeited. The proposed
terms included the right to black list and to debar an agency for failure to
carry out the terms and conditions.
11.

In the event of an offer being approved and the work order

issued to a party, it would also be required to deposit the security amount of
10% of the total amount calculated @ Rs.150 per WC per bathroom per
urinal per month for a period of one year which would be refundable after
due inspection of the complex after completing the maintenance period.
Loss caused to the complex was required to be assessed by an officer not
below the rank of the Executive Engineer(Civil/Electrical) and the amount
of the loss to be deducted from the security amount. The licence fee which

13

WP(C) No.10685/2004

was to be fixed was required to be paid in advance on quarterly basis at a
rate accepted by the MCD within 15 days of the award of the work.

In

case of delay in payment, after 15 days of the next quarter, interest would be
payable by the tenderer @ 18% per year which could be recovered from the
security deposit.
12.

The committee had also suggested an insurance cover to be

undertaken by the organisation which was taking over the CTC to cover the
risk of theft, riots, natural calamities etc. at his own cost. The water and
electricity charges were also to be the responsibility of the operating agency
while obtaining the connections would be the responsibility of the MCD.
The electricity was to be supplied through a generator, the diesel
consumption expenditure on its procurement as per actual consumption was
to be borne by the operating agency while the generator set etc. would be
provided by the MCD. Again MCD would reserve the right to adjust unpaid
bills against the security deposit. The Committee was of the firm view that
the CTCs would be operated, managed and maintained on “pay and use
basis”and had suggested a charge of 50 paisa per use from all users except
children below the age of 12 years who would be allowed to use the WC
free of charge. A user would require to be supplied a teaspoonful of soap
powder for washing hands after defecation without additional charges.
13.

Apart from suggesting the ideal maintenance staff ratio, the

Committee

had

emphasised

the

requirement

to

increase

public

consciousness of the use of the CTCs by giving due publicity by the

14

WP(C) No.10685/2004

agencies and also maintenance of close liason with the local public and
public representatives in the clusters where the CTC was operating. The
social welfare requirement of abiding by the provisions of the Minimum
Wages Act, 1948 and the Contract Labour(Regulation and Abolition) Act,
1970 and other labour laws was also emphasised.
14.

So far as recommendations were concerned, the Vishnu Swaroop

Sharma Committee made the following recommendations:“

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. The C.S.E. Department should exercise effective
control and supervision over the functioning of these Jan
Suvidha Complexes being maintained by NGOs so as to
ensure that the terms and conditions as contained in the
agreements executed with them are being adhered to
properly. The field staff should visit the Jan Suvidha
Complexes from time to time and submit their reports to
the senior officers of the department.
2. An unified authority which is statutorily C.S.E.
Department should be made responsible for monitoring
and exercising effective control/supervision over the
functioning of all toilet complexes whether constructed
by the Ceneral Wing of the Slum Wing of the M.C.D.
3. The proposed model agreement given at preceding
pages of this report. If approved by the Commissioner,
should be placed before the Standing Committee in the
form of a preamble for approval and hereinafter this
should be executed in respect of the Jan Suvidha
Complexes to be handed over to the NGOs/Community
based Organisations/Basti Co-operative Societies. The
Department may consider giving preference to Basti Cooperative Societies/Community based Organisations (duly
registered under the Societies Registration Act) consisting
of local community people themselves in the allotment to
public toilet blocks for the respective basti itself.
4. As reported by the C.S.E. Department the period of
agreement executed with M/s. Sulabh International in
15

WP(C) No.10685/2004

respect of certain Jan Suvidha Complexes has already
expired. In all such cases the department should process
the matter for calling bids for their allotment on the
proposed model terms and conditions and till the time
such allotments are made, present arrangement may be
allowed to continue.

15.

5. Since after conducting a sample survey of certain Jan
Suvidha Complexes it has been noted that M/s. Sulabh
International are not maintaining the complexes in
accordance with the agreed terms and conditions, the
agreements executed with them for thirty years may be
terminated after giving show cause notice etc. and the
complexes may be handed over to other NGOs etc.
prepared to maintain them on the terms and conditions of
proposed model agreement.”
These recommendations of Shri Vishnu Swaroop Sharma

Committee were considered by Shri V.K.Duggal, the then Commissioner of
the MCD who recorded the following order on 22.3.2000 thereon:-

16.

“The mater regarding maintenance of 164 Jan Suvidha
Complexes now with Sulabh International was discussed
at length in the Standing Committee meeting and a
decision was taken that we should take over the
complexes back from Sulabh International in view of the
recommendations made in the report of three senior
officers
headed
by
Shri
V.S.Sharma,
Addl.
Commissioner(Engg.). It was also decided that a three
member committee should be constituted to prepare an
action plan in this respect so that these complexes can be
taken over in a phased manner starting from April, 2000.
Shri Manjit Singh, Addl. Commissioner(S&JJ) will head
this
committee
and
Shri
K.S.Sandhu,
Director(Sanitation)-I and Shri O.P.Garg, B&FO will be
the members.
Fortnightly progress report may be
submitted to the undersigned.”
(Emphasis
supplied)
The further Committee consisting of the Additional

Commissioner(S&JJ), Director(Sanitation)-I MCD and the B&FO, MCD
held various deliberations for finalising the terms and conditions for
maintenance and management annually on lines which were followed in the
16

WP(C) No.10685/2004

S&JJ Department. Attention was paid to the difference in the method
adopted by the S&JJ Department and the practice in the General Wing of
the MCD. It appears that the S& JJ department was generating revenue
from the NGOs for the maintenance of the toilet complexes instead of
paying to them. This was contrary to the practice in the General Wing. The
Standing Committee of the MCD was also of the view that there should a
uniform system in the MCD and such comprehensive exercise was required
to be undertaken in view of the concerns expressed.
17.

This Committee which had been appointed pursuant to the

decision taken by the Commissioner MCD on 22.3.2000 invited
applications from the NGOs by placing public advertisements twice in
leading newspapers. 174 NGOs who were registered under the Societies
Act had applied pursuant to these advertisements. These applications were
categorised into four categories.

The first category consisted of 43

applicants who met all the eligibility requirements which were suggested in
the advertisement including registration under the Societies Act, possessing
the requisite experience and had displayed good performance through
documentary evidence thereof. The three member committee appointed
pursuant to the order dated 22.3.2000 recommended that initially, the work
may be given to those NGOs who fell in this first category and tenders be
called from them. So far as the others were concerned, they would be
considered for assignment of work upon production of documentary proof
of their claimed registration and experience. The method which was being

17

WP(C) No.10685/2004

followed was allotment of the Jan Suvidha Toilet Complexes to the NGOs
for operation and maintenance in a phased manner so that a uniform
management system was followed.
Another consideration which weighed with this committee was
that there could be clubbing of five Jan Suvidha Toilet Complexes or even
more with a view to ensure that remunerative as well as less remunerative
Jan Suvidha Toilet Complexes are covered for award of work in the
package to one NGO so that the interest of the NGO also does not suffer.
The terms and conditions for allotment of the operation, maintenance and
management of these complexes on pay and use basis were suggested. The
Commissioner vide his letter dated 8.9.2000 required these to be placed
before the Standing Committee of the Corporation for approval thereof.
18.

The proposal of the Commissioner was considered by the

Standing Committee which, vide its resolution no.262 dated 20.9.2000,
recommended to the Corporation that the proposal of the Commissioner as
contained in the letter dated 8.9.2000 be approved.
The Full House of the Corporation by its resolution no.445 in the
meeting held on 8.11.2000 approved the recommendations of the Standing
Committee as contained in resolution no.262 dated 20.9.2000.
19.

It is an admitted position that pursuant to this decision of the

MCD, 66 CTCs which had been awarded to Sulabh were withdrawn from it.
After advertisement and consideration, five NGOs were awarded the work
of operation and maintenance. However, there was non-payment of the

18

WP(C) No.10685/2004

licence fee by the NGOs and MCD has contended that action has been
initiated for debarring these NGOs for a period of three to five years.
20.

So far as the 1004 CTCs which form part of the five categories

noted above, at the time of filing the writ petition, the responsibility for the
operation maintenance and management of these CTCs can thus be summed
up as hereunder:(i)With Sulabh under different agreements

Undoubtedly there was no complaint with regard to the

experience of the MCD so far as operation, maintenance and management
of these 1004 CTCs was concerned.
Yamuna Action Plan
21.

This brings us to the sixth category of CTCs wherein the

petitioners were involved. Much concern has been expressed in the last two
decades with regard to the state of River Yamuna as it flows through Delhi.
Its pollution levels have engaged the attention of not only the
conservationists, ecologists, town planners, the civic authorities but have
engaged serious consideration by the Apex Court as well. One of the major
pollutants of the river Yamuna has been the untreated sewage which flows
directly into the river Yamuna on account of the jhuggi clusters and

19

WP(C) No.10685/2004

unauthorised colonies.
22.

At the same time, concerned with the state of the River Yamuna

as it flows through Delhi and agitated by the fact that it has been reduced to
almost a major drain, the authorities were of the view that large scale
multiple intervention was necessary to facilitate reduction of the sources of
its pollution. Untreated sewage was found to be a major contributory factor
to the pollution in the river and lack of toilet facilities and lack of proper
sewage disposal systems in slum areas, re-location settlements and other
low income settlements was found to be a major source of the untreated
sewage. One of the measures which was identified was construction of
large number of toilet complexes with all proper facilities including a round
the clock water supply from an independent tubewell with back up
generating sets so that the lakhs of people who are still defecating in the
open areas in the city of Delhi are discouraged from so doing. Apart from
creating unhygienic and unsanitary public conditions, this results in the
carriage of the discharge to public drains and through them, ultimately
reaching the river Yamuna. Notified areas under the Slums Act also have
inadequate toilet facilities in highly populated areas. It was realised that
hence there was a dire need of toilet complexes in such areas in Old Delhi.
Resettlement colonies numbering forty six were also identified as lacking
in adequate public toilets.
23.

In the matter of cleaning up of the river Yamuna, a “Yamuna

Action Plan” ('YAP' for brevity)was conceived after detailed interaction by

20

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the Ministry of Environment & Forest, Government of India, in conjunction
with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi with a Japanese team pertaining to
various sanitation related issues such as:(i)public toilet facilities alongwith maintenance and management;
(ii)low cost sanitation
(iii)maintenance and management by NGOs and CBOs
(iv)de-centralised sewage disposal system in the slum areas, relocation
settlements and other low income settlements including walled city areas.
24.

Taking the totality of the population requiring reasonable access

to organised/institutionalised toilet arrangements, it was planned that
community toilet complexes be constructed. The Yamuna Action Plan also
provided for de-centralised mini sewage treatment plants as pilot projects in
various relocation colonies such as Holambi Kalan, Tikri Khurd, Bhalasva,
Bakkarwala, Molarbandh, where there is no possibility of sewer lines in the
near future.

In addition 10 micro sewage treatment plants were also

provided in place of septic tanks. A provision of Rs.16 crores had been
made in the Yamuna Action Plan which envisaged four module
components.
25.

In order to provide reasonable access to toilets to the population

and to organise/institutionalise arrangements for toilet facilities, it was
estimated that 1150 community toilet complexes comprising of 30,000 WC
seats in the module of 20, 30 and 40 WC seats were required. Based on the
information gathered from different quarters, a project report for an

21

WP(C) No.10685/2004

estimated expenditure of Rs.250 crores was sent by the MCD to the
Advisors/Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and Forest through
the Commissioner, MCD vide a letter no. PSC/672/2000 dated 28th July,
2000 for consideration and the necessary approval from the Government of
India. Several meetings thereafter were held between the representatives of
this Ministry; the Japan Bank for international cooperation and the
consultant-TEC-DCL consortium. After detailed deliberations, the Ministry
vide its letter dated 5th June, 2001 agreed to provide Rs.164.82 crores to the
MCD only for provision of the following :
i.

Module 1 - Construction of 1146 community toilet complexes at

a cost of Rs.149.96 corres
ii

Module II - Construction of Mini/Micro sewage treatment plan

cost of Rs.9181 crores.
iii

Module III - Procurement of Sanitation equipments costs of

Rs.2.89 crores.
iv

Module IV Public Participation & Awareness Programme

-

costs Rs.216 crores - total Rs.164.82 crores.
26.
MCD.

These 1146 CTCs were to be constructed in 12 zones under the
Anticipating water and electricity shortages as well as lack of

adequate area, the proposal therefore included provision of tube wells for
round the clock water supply; generating sets to provide for electricity
failures as well as multi storeyed toilet facilities where there was no
adequate land available.
22

WP(C) No.10685/2004

The project was required to be completed before the 31st March,
2002 in all respects as per the loan agreement of the Government of India
with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.

The Ministry of

Environment and Forest had clearly stipulated that no extension of time
would be permitted. Therefore, a monitoring management and information
control room was established at the Slum Wing headquarters under the
overall administrative control of the additional commissioner(S&JJ)/YAP
with the requisite manpower and communication networking.
27.

In view of the allegations by the respective parties before this

Court with regard to the nature of the construction and non-utility of the
CTCs it is necessary to consider the monitoring of this project as well as its
implementation in some detail. A control room was specially established
for monitoring the Yamuna Action Plan project.

For monitoring the

progress of the work on daily basis, 10 field monitors were employed by the
authorities who reported back to the control room. These reports were
being submitted to the Commissioner in the weekly review meetings under
his

Chairmanship

where

the

Engineer-in-Chief,

Chief

Engineers,

Superintending Engineers, Director CSE-I/II, Director(Hort.), Zonal
Development

Commissioners,

representatives

of

the

Ministry

of

Environment & Forest, TEC-DCL Consortium, JBIC, ACORD etc. were
present. In these meetings, the physical and financial progress of various
stages of the construction of CTCs and other modules under the Yamuna
Action Plan were allegedly reviewed.

23

WP(C) No.10685/2004

28.

In addition to the CTCs, where new toilet complexes were being

constructed after demolishing the old dilapidated ones which were in use,
174 mobile toilet vans were provided as an alternative temporary
arrangement with the stipulated cost of Rs.4.10 crores out of the total
provision of Rs.149.38 crores The operation, maintenance and management
of the toilet complexes constructed under the Yamuna Action Plan were to
be entrusted to NGOs who were to operate and maintain these complexes on
'pay and use' culture.
29.

The construction of these CTCs was apparently carried out by

the MCD by inviting tenders from amongst the class I contractors registered
with the DDA, CPWD and other Government departments. The tender was
a composite tender covering civil work, sanitary works and water supply
and drainage work; electrical works; tubewells; submersible pumps; DG
sets etc. thereby avoiding division of responsibility. Tenders were invited
for 984 complexes which are stated to have been awarded after detailed
negotiations with various contracting agencies. The works were divided
amongst the 20 divisions of the General Wing of the MCD and 8 divisions
of the Slum & Jhuggi Jhompri Wing also of the MCD who were the
executing agencies under the project to get the work executed through
contractors. The MCD, undoubtedly to maintain a tight control over the
work, had appointed 70 temporary work supervisors specially for carrying
out the supervision of the execution of the project. In order to ensure that
effective and timely execution was undertaken, for each contracting agency,

24

WP(C) No.10685/2004

4 to 8 complexes of varying seat capacities of 20, 30 and 40 seaters were
grouped to form one contract. A period of six months was granted in the
tender for completion of the CTC and a special bonus clause was included
to the effect that those contractors who complete the work before the six
months period would be paid a bonus of 1% of the contract value and ½ per
cent of the value if the work is completed before 15 days of the contract
period. Since tenders were floated during the month of June to September,
2001 and works actually commenced at the site in 2001 itself onwards, the
six month period was to end around February to March,2002. According to
the MCD, 90% of the works were completed by the 31 st March, 2002 which
was the final date of the completion of the project.
These facts were stated in a detailed project report which was
based on a revised completion cost estimate for the Yamuna Action Plan
Project Phase-I which was forwarded by the MCD vide its letter dated
24.12.2002 to the Additional Director NRCD, Ministry of Environment &
Forest. The final date for completion of the project was also the 31st March,
2002.
30.

In the light of the above, it is obvious that tight control and

supervision of the MCD was envisaged and its officials were required to
maintain a close vigil over the construction. This was reinforced through
the field monitors and supervisors who it had appointed against payment of
charges.
It would appear that the construction which is stated to have

25

WP(C) No.10685/2004

been effected by class-I contractors ought to have been first class in nature
and impeccable. There can be no reason or justification for any CTC to be
deficient in construction or functioning.
31.

In the report which the MCD submitted with its letter dated

24.12.2002, it expressed some problems faced during the construction
period. These related to public resistance in certain areas; objections raised
by land owning agencies; requirement of permission at 134 sites specially in
the South and South West areas to be given by the Central Ground Water
Authority for digging of tubewells and the need for finding alternative
sources including direct water supply from municipal mains; the failure of
the Delhi Vidyut Board Authorities to provide permanent electrical
connections to certain CTCs which stood constructed and difficulty in
getting permission for sewerage connections from the Delhi Jal Board
Authorities. Even at the time of submission of the report, on 24.12.2002,
the MCD has stated that “even though CTCs have been constructed for 52
sites permission for boring of tubewells from the Central Ground Water
Authority is still to be obtained with the result even though CTCs are
constructed, they are not put into operation.” It was stated that work at 10
sites had to be abandoned due to non-availability of boring permission.
Finally, the MCD constructed 952 CTCs under the Yamuna
Action Plan in this manner.
Allocation of CTCs
32.

So far as the operation, maintenance and management of the

26

WP(C) No.10685/2004

CTCs in areas within the jurisdiction of the MCD for the 952 complexes
finally constructed under the YAP was concerned, the issue was addressed
in a letter dated 19th August, 2002 by the Commissioner. It had been
considered that the contract for the same be awarded by auction amongst
identified/shortlisted NGOs on the already considered and stipulated terms
and conditions. The allotment was to be through a transparent and open
process amongst the identified/shortlisted NGOs.
This proposal was got approved on 20th March, 2002 through a
process of anticipatory approval by the Chairman of the Standing
Committee and the Mayor of the city. The programme for auction was thus
fixed for 28th March, 2002, 30th March, 2002 and 1st April, 2002. However
the NGOs who were being considered for the allotment had suggested
several valid changes in the terms and conditions of allotment. Detailed
deliberations were held on the suggestions made. The modified preamble
was got cleared on 10th May, 2002 by the Chairman of the Standing
Committee and the Mayor in anticipation of approval of the Corporation.
Accordingly, new dates for the auction programme were fixed as
21st May, 2002, 22nd May, 2002 and 23rd May, 2002 and one week notice
thereof was given through publication in leading newspapers.
The 952 toilet complexes which consisted of 25231 WC seats
excluding children seats and bathers were clustered into 103 groups.
33.

Fairness in the action of the MCD was further underlined by the

restrictions in the allocations to the effect that an NGO who had

27

WP(C) No.10685/2004

successfully bid in two groups would not be allowed to participate in any
further auction and would have to leave the auction hall immediately. This
condition was also announced at the time of conduct of the auction
programme. Thereby the MCD ensured that a single NGO was not able to
unfairly successfully bid for a large number of CTCs and that more than one
NGO was successful in the bidding. Thereby, MCD was able to ensure
provision of facilities to the users in the event that any one or the other
NGO was unable to perform its duties, the MCD had options/alternatives to
fall back upon.
34.

So far as the terms and conditions for allotment of the operation,

management and maintenance of the community toilet complexes was
concerned, perusal thereof would show that the same showed due
consideration and were based on the past experience of the MCD in having
allotted CTCs on different basis to different persons. Each eligible shortlisted NGO was required to deposit Rs.15,000/- by a demand draft in favour
of the Commissioner, MCD for participating in the auction programme. It
was also mandated that only two groups of CTCs (ranging from 8 -10
complexes in one group and number of seats varying from 240 to 300 WC
seats) would be entrusted to one agency/NGO. The terms and conditions
had clearly stated that the successful agency/NGO would not be allowed to
participate in any further auction, if he had successfully taken two groups
by auction. A minimum reserve price per seat had been fixed at the rate of
Rs.20/- per month. As per clause 4(a) of the terms and conditions of

28

WP(C) No.10685/2004

licence, the NGO who offered the maximum rate per seat of the group of
complexes, was required to deposit 25% of the total finalised auction
licence fee for each group, calculated on quarterly basis immediately after
the auction was decided in his favour, either in cash or by way of a demand
draft in favour of the Commissioner, MCD.
35.

In the auctions held, 80 groups comprising of 749 toilet

complexes with 19065 WC seats were successfully auctioned.
In 23 groups, there was no response and the MCD proposed to
initiate separate auction programme for disposal of the same.
36.

So far as the distribution of the CTCs between the NGOs is

concerned, as noticed above 87 NGOs had been shortlisted. However only
53 NGOs participated in the auction programme while 34 NGOs did not
participate in the process to offer a bid or remained absent. Twenty seven
NGOs had each taken two number of groups or clusters while 26 NGOs had
taken only one group.
37.

As per the terms and conditions on which these CTCs were

auctioned, in respect of the 80 groups for which the auction was successful,
the MCD was to receive a sum of Rs. 40 lakhs as security deposit. So far as
the other amounts which were payable by the NGOs towards the licence fee
was concerned, the MCD would receive an amount of Rs.28,60,246.00 per
month in respect of the 80 groups alone. The MCD proposed to place the
same in a separate Escrow Account in the name of the Commissioner, MCD
having joint signatories, one from the Finance Department, another from the

29

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Slum Department and the third from the General Wing.
38.

A proposal was placed as item no. 496 for consideration by the

Standing Committee for the allotment of the remaining 23 groups in respect
of which there was no response in the auctions. It was proposed that
instead of the restriction of confining the NGOs to only two groups, they
may be allowed to take up three groups so as to dispose of the 23 remaining
groups. It is noteworthy that, out of these 23 groups, 22 belonged to the
general wing of the MCD while one belonged to the slum wing. All the 87
shortlisted NGOs were to be called for participation in the auction bid to be
held for disposing of the remaining 23 groups. This was placed as item no.
496 for consideration of the Standing Committee in its meeting dated 13th
December, 2002 and was approved by Resolution No. 770 dated 13th
December, 2002 by the Standing Committee.
The same was thereafter was approved as Resolution No. 769
dated 13th December, 2002 of the MCD.
39.

An auction programme was thereafter fixed for 25th June, 2002

in respect of the remaining 23 groups which could not be earlier auctioned
and were successfully auctioned on this date.
40.

It is noteworthy that so far as these 23 groups were concerned, it

was anticipated that the MCD would receive an annual licence fee amount
of Rs.3,00,149.00 per month in addition to the amount of Rs.28,60,246/- per
month in respect of the earlier 80 groups auctioned earlier. So far as
security deposit was concerned, from these 23 groups, a sum of Rs.51.51

30

WP(C) No.10685/2004

lakh would be received as a security deposit.
41.

Approval of the highest bids received in respect of these 23

groups of CTCs was sought from the Standing Committee of the MCD
which was granted vide a Resolution No. 769 dated 13th December, 2002.
42.

By Resolution No. 424 dated 30th December, 2002, the house of

the Municipal Corporation of Delhi accorded its formal approval for the
empanelment and shortlisting of the 87 NGOs and the proposed changes in
the terms and conditions of operation and maintenance work of the
community toilet complexes under the Yamuna Action Plan.
43.

It is necessary to consider certain material changes in the terms

and conditions which were observed and objected to by the Finance
Department of the MCD and replies thereto which were approved by the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi read as hereunder:“ Observations raised by finance and replies thereto:
(1)
Under Clause 2, the period of
contract has been enhanced from one year to 3 year
without giving any rational for change. Finance is of the
view that it should be initially for a period of one year and
renewed thereafter.
Earlier terms and conditions were
finalised for one year maintenance, but majority of O&M
agencies insisted that period of operation & maintenance
should not be less than 5 years and after detailed
deliberations it was considered necessary to raise it from 1
year to 3 years.
In earlier terms & conditions approved by
Corporation vide Resolution No. 445 dated 8.11.2000 the
term of O&M work was for 3 years.
(ii)
Under Clause 4(a), rationale for deleting the
“'B aths' from the original proposal has not been given.
Since, the change of Re.1/- is for each entry to
the complex and coupon entry besides are of WC. Bath
31

WP(C) No.10685/2004

can also be used and nothing extra on account to be
charged and, hence, it was decided in return we may
accept suggestion of O&M agencies. However, it does
not affect the revenue aspect of the assignment of O&M
work of CTC is to be determined by auction process.
(iii)
Under Clause 5, security amount has been
reduced from Rs.60,000/- to Rs.50,000/- without giving
any reasons. The security amount should be proportional
to the cost of infrastructure to be handed over to the
second party and tentative Licence Fee to be recovered
from the complexes awarded to the agency.
The security amount reduction was considered
as all these necessary, O&M agencies insisted for this and
was agreed to.
(iv)
Under Clause 10, it should be clearly stipulated
that in no case, NGO will be allowed to put any
advertisement board, bill board, kiosk or banner etc. at the
toilet complex. Any breach of this clause shall be liable to
termination of contract.
Accepted and incorporated in the modified
terms and conditions.

44.

(v)
Under Clause 14.8, the department shall insert
after 3 months notice - except in case of serious violation
of any clause of contract to be determined by the first
party in which case contract will be terminated by the first
party immediately and security forfeited. This part may be
go verified from CLO again.
Accepted and incorporated in the modified
terms & conditions.”
So far as the modification which was proposed with regard to the

advertisement rights and financial viability of the CTCs is concerned, clause
10 of the terms and conditions and the proposed change as was considered
and approved by the Corporation read as follows :-

Suggestion

32

Approved clause

10. Financial Viability of CTCs :

10. Financial Viability of CTCs :

10.1
The first party can invite
various companies or organisations
to put up the advertisements of their
products, services on CTCs as per
guidelines.

45.

10.1
The first party can invite
various companies or organisations
to put up the advertisements of their
products services on CTCs as per
guidelines. Advertisement revenue
may be shared as per mutual consent
between first and second party on
complex-to-complex basis to be
decided by the competent authority.
Further second party shall extend
full cooperation and shall bear
necessary charges for the watch and
ward and other expenses like
electricity charges etc. However,
any motivational public concern
slogans and advertisements write ups
by the first party shall be put up on
site on complimentary basis and
NGO's shall extend full requisite
cooperation and care. No case, NGO
will be allowed to put any
advertisement board, bill board,
kiosk or banner etc. at the toilet
complex. Any breach of this clause
shall be liable to termination of
contract.
In the event of a default by a successful NGO, the terms and

conditions stipulated a forfeiture clause of the amount of Rs.15,000/- earlier
deposited as well as the 25% amount deposited after the bidder was
successful. The NGO/agency was also required to deposit licence fee for
the next quarter in advance and within 15 days before the completion of the
quarter. In case of default in payment of the licence fee after 15 days of the
next quarter, it was stipulated that interest would be charged at the rate of
18% per year which would be recoverable from the security deposit. In
case of failure to deposit licence fees for two consecutive quarters, licence

33

WP(C) No.10685/2004

fees would be recovered from the security deposit and the MCD had the
authority to take action to rescind the agreement and withdraw the CTCs
from the NGO for further operation, maintenance and management after a
seven day notice.
46.

The agency/NGO was required to deposit a further amount of

Rs.35,000/- which, together with the amount of Rs.15,000/- deposited
earlier to participate in the auction, was to constitute the security deposit
which amounted to a total of Rs.50,000/- for each group of the CTC.
47.

Assessment of loss caused to the CTC was to be at the instance

of an officer not below the rank of executive engineer (civil/electrical) and
the MCD was entitled to deduct this amount also from the security deposit.
48.

The terms and conditions stipulated that the CTC was required to

be comprehensively insured for several contingencies.

Initially,

comprehensive insurance was required to be effected by the MCD for which
the requisite amount of premium was to be debited to the NGO/agency.
49.

In view of the vehement submissions made on either side in

respect of the operation worthiness of the CTCs, it becomes necessary to
notice the stipulations with regard to the handing over and mobilisation
period of the CTC.

This was provided in clause 6 of the terms and

conditions of allotment which reads as under :“6.

Handing over and mobilisation period
The first party shall hand over possession of
the complex along with inventories to the Second party
after deposit of entire Security Deposit and licence fee
according to the availability of the complex within the
group & balance complexes to be handed over by
34

WP(C) No.10685/2004

50.

25.06.2002. The second party shall be given 7 days
time by the first party to mobilise his resources for
starting the operation, management and maintenance.
The obligation of the Second party for the maintenance
shall be reckoned after 3 days from the date of handing
over the complexes by the first party to the second
party.”
The terms and conditions further contained certain “Special

Conditions”. These included Special Condition no. 14.4 which reads as
under :-

51.

“14.4.
The second party shall hand over the units in
the operational condition to the first party at the time of
completion/termination of the agreement. For any
defects and deficiency at the time of transfer, the cost
shall be recovered from the Security deposit of the
Second party.”
It would therefore appear that the use of the expression

“availability of the complex” would show that the complex was to be
handed over in a condition which would have enabled the NGO/agency to
commence operation, management and maintenance of the same.
52.

The CTCs were required to be operated and maintained on “pay

and use” basis by utilising the money collected by the NGO/agency by way
of collection on a monthly payment as per the following slab system if any
family wanted a family coupon :“(i)
Single user : Rs.25/(ii)
Family of 2 adults : Rs.50/(iii)
Family of 3-4 adults : Rs.75/(iv)
Family of 5 & above adults : Rs.100/-”
In case of any adult user not availing the monthly payment
system, the user charges were fixed at Rs.1/- while children below the age
of 12 years were permitted free use of the WC and the bath facility. Each
user was required to be supplied a teaspoonful of soap powder for washing
35

WP(C) No.10685/2004

after defecation without any additional charge.
The NGOs/agencies were completely prohibited from putting up
any advertisement on the CTC complex by clause 10 of the terms and
conditions which has been reproduced above.
53.

Day to day repairs of the fittings and fixtures and other systems

at the CTC was also the responsibility of the agency.

MCD

was

specifically authorised and empowered to inspect the CTCs at any time.
Additionally, as per clause 17, MCD was mandated to nominate an agency
to monitor the functioning efficiency of the CTC managed by the NGO
which would also have the right to inspect the premises at any point of time.
54.

So far as its satisfaction with the performance by any of the

NGOs/agencies was concerned, condition 15.5 provided that in case of
unsatisfactory condition prevailing for more than 7 days, a 7 days notice
shall be served upon the NGO for maintaining satisfactory improvement
failing which the contract was liable to be rescinded.

The MCD also

reserved the right to effect the necessary improvement at the risk and cost of
the second party.
It is therefore apparent that the MCD had taken care of every
aspect of the operation and maintenance of the CTCs while notifying the
terms and conditions.
Operation & utilisation of the CTCs, interaction with MCD officers
55.

The importance of this sixth category of CTCs cannot be

adequately emphasised. It was as one of the prime measures to contain the

36

WP(C) No.10685/2004

level of pollution in the River Yamuna, that the MCD constructed these 959
CTCs under the what has been called as the “Yamuna Action Plan” through
private contractors and carefully decided to allot the same through
competitive bidding on terms and conditions decided after detailed and
cautious deliberations which also involved revenue generation and
monitoring in public interest.
56.

What transpired thereafter has to be examined in the light of this

background. All the petitioners have made a grievance that the MCD did
not appoint any agency in terms of clause 17 for monitoring the operation
and maintenance. They only continued with the Field Monitors who had
been nominated prior to the construction of the CTCs being undertaken.
MCD also did not serve any kind of notice in terms of clause 15.5 upon any
of the NGOs/agencies.
57.

It now becomes necessary now to examine as to the manner in

which some of the petitioners who participated in the auction were treated
and their experience.
M/s Bhagwati Foundation, writ petitioners in W.P.(C) No.
10685/2004 participated in the auction which was held in May, 2002. By a
letter of 10th June, 2002, M/s Bhagwati Foundation was informed that it was
successful in being alloted group no. 69 of CTC in the Civil Line Zone
which consisted of 180 WCs and 9 CTC complexes and 180 WCs at
different locations for a period of three years. One Mr. Rahul Priyadarshi
had been nominated as the Field Monitor.

37

WP(C) No.10685/2004

It made the deposit of Rs.51,300/- and Rs.1,88,900/- towards the
security and the licence fee, by the letter dated 10th June, 2002.
Upon an inspection of the group 69 CTCs which were alloted to
it, M/s Bhagwati Foundation informed the MCD by a letter received by it on
21st June, 2002, that it had deposited the security deposit as well as the
licence fee at the place of the auction and that MCD was bound to hand
over the CTCs to M/s Bhagwati Foundation up to 26th June, 2002 in
complete condition. The CTCs of group no. 69 were stated to be full of
deficiencies on the civil and electrical side and M/s Bhagwati Foundation
had informed MCD even prior to the receipt of the possession that the
material used in construction of the CTCs was not up to mark and would not
stand or be durable even for a period of one year.
58.

There does not appear to have been any response to this

communication by the MCD but by a letter dated 13th August, 2002, MCD
informed M/s Bhagwati Foundation that 9 CTCs which were covered under
group 69 were handed over to it and called upon the successful bidder to
execute the agreement within seven days of the communication.

M/s

Bhagwati Foundation addressed a letter dated 25th September, 2002
reminding MCD about the joint inspection which was conducted on 8th
August, 2002 in the presence of the local councilor and the engineering
department of the MCD.

This letter was addressed to the Executive

Engineer(CSC)/XII/CLZ of the MCD and it clearly stated that the joint
inspection committee had found defects in the civil and electrical works

38

WP(C) No.10685/2004

which were not even complete and most of the work was still pending. All
the nine toilet complexes could not be commissioned and the Bhagwati
Foundation could not undertake the maintenance work in these CTCs which
were still closed on account of the deficiencies. According to the Bhagwati
Foundation, it had taken possession subject to rectification, renovation and
repair which were pointed out during the inspection.

The petitioner

requested the MCD to direct the concerned contractor in this behalf. The
petitioner had pointed out that the engineering department of the MCD had
participated in the joint inspection. Even as late as on 24th December, 2002,
no steps had been taken by the MCD and M/s Bhagwati Foundation pointed
out that several joint inspections had been organized together with the field
monitor but of no avail.

This communication was addressed by the

petitioner to the deputy commissioner of the zone with copies to the OSD,
YAP, Executive Engineer as well as the concerned superintending
engineering. The petitioner thereafter wrote a letter dated 23rd January, 2003
to the OSD, YAP and a letter dated 10th March, 2003 to the Additional
Commissioner, Slum and JJ Department of the MCD pointing out the
defects and the urgency in effecting the repairs in the civil and electrical
work which was essential for the maintenance and operation of the CTCs.
The petitioner undertook that he would deposit the licence fee as soon as
the electrical and civil work was complete and the CTCs were rendered
functional.
Despite the MCD not paying any heed to these requests, M/s

39

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Bhagwati Foundation contended that it deposited a further amount of
Rs.91200/- towards the licence fee by a letter dated 13 th August, 2003 again
pointing out detailed deficiencies in the 9 CTCs and that both the electrical
and civil work was totally incomplete. The petitioner wrote that the civil
work has not been done and the septic tank was found full of malba, electric
meter was not provided and where it had been provided, the meter was
defective. The caretakers room had not been constructed and therefore the
contractor had refused to hand over keys of the CTCs to the petitioner. As
such the CTCs remained closed and non-functional. Other old dilapidated
CTCs in the vicinity of the petitioner CTCs had to be demolished as the
public continued to be utilizing these CTCs illegally and unauthorisedly.
However, the MCD has taken no steps to remove these old and dilapidated
CTCs.
59.

In its writ petition, the petitioner has also pointed out the minutes

of several meetings which were held and assurances were given by the
MCD and its officials that licence fee would be charged not from the date
when the CTCs were provided but from the date the defects were removed
and the complexes rendered functional. In the meeting which was held on
9th July, 2003, the petitioner had pointed out that the flooring in two
complexes of the CTCs in group no. 69 had settled besides other defects
and deficiencies. In the complex at Lalbagh, only one room had been
provided in which the generator had been installed while there was no place
for the caretaker or the safai karamchari. No ventilation system has been

40

WP(C) No.10685/2004

provided while the efflux from the bathroom and the toilet had not been
connected to the septic tank as a result of which this tank was choked.
Other CTCs allocated to the petitioner were also situated in institutional
areas in respect of which the MCD had taken a decision to hand over the
same to the institutions.
60.

As noticed above, the field monitors who were appointed by the

MCD had been specifically assigned to the CTC complexes for facilitating
the communication between the NGO operator and the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi.
61.

On 23rd January, 2003, Bhagwati Foundation addressed yet

another communication emphasisng the urgency to remove the deficiencies
and pointing out a complex wise position with regard to the works
necessary in the civil and electrical areas.

This time, the Bhagwati

Foundation addressed the letter to the OSD(YAP) of the S & JJ Department
of the MCD with copies to the Deputy Commissioner, Executive Engineer
(Project) Civil and the Executive Engineer(Project) Electrical of the MCD.
Bhagwati Foundation also made a request for an agreement incorporating
the objections of the petitioner with regard to the deficiencies and pointed
out that different executive engineers in the MCD were furnishing different
conditional agreements with different NGOs.

Yet another letter

dated 10th March, 2003 was addressed this time to the Additional
Commissioner of the Slum & JJ Department of the MCD pointing out that
despite repeated requests and intimations, the initial deficiencies in the

41

WP(C) No.10685/2004

CTCs were still pending and that the same had not been removed. Bhagwati
Foundation pointed out that this was despite deposit of the licence fee for
the quarter and that the CTCs were non-functional.
62.

Noteworthy is the course of events thereafter wherein the MCD

appears to have admitted several aspects of the situation. A meting was
held on the 2nd July, 2003 in the office of the Additional Commissioner,
Slum & JJ under his chairmanship with officers of the General Wing, Slum
& JJ Wing and the operating and maintenance agencies that is the NGOs
wherein the field monitors also appear to have participated. These minutes

problems can be crystallised and necessary
recommendations could be forwarded as found

retrospective effect.”
It is noteworthy that even till the commencement of hearing, the

So far as the payment of the licence fee was concerned, the
minutes of this meeting which were circulated recorded thus :“ (10)
It was mentioned by the NGOs that in the
earlier meetings convened by former Addl.
Commissioner (S&JJ), Sh. Ramesh Negi and Sh. V.K.
Singh, it was assured that the licence fees will be
charged from the date on which all the facilities like
permanent electric connections, tube-wells are provided,
53

WP(C) No.10685/2004

defects/deficiencies are removed and the complexes are
made functional. Addl. Commissioner (S&JJ) mentioned
that he is not the Competent Authority for giving
moratorium/concession in the licence fees and
Commissioner/Chairman, Standing Committee is the
Competent Authority and he will send his
recommendations to the Competent Authority and
mentioned that if these recommendations are approved
then also it will be applicable from that date and not
from the back date.”
A stipulation was noticed as a conclusion wherein it was
mentioned so :“ Conclusion

69.

Addl. Commissioner (S&JJ) clearly mentioned that these
meetings are being arranged with the NGOs in groups
along with Executive Engineers to understand the actual
situations so that the problems can be crystallised and
necessary recommendations could be forwarded as found
suitable to the Competent Authority before
implementation is carried out. He also mentioned very
clearly that the discussions during these meetings should
not be construed as decisions taken, since the Competent
Authority for this is Commissioner/Hon'ble Standing
Committee of MCD. He further reiterated that whatever
decisions taken will not be applicable with retrospective
effect.”
There appears to have been no change whatsoever in the ground

position and the minutes of the meeting held on 17th July, 2003 again under
the chairmanship of the Additional Commissioner (Slum & JJ) noticed all
the above including the directions by the Additional Commissioner (Slum &
JJ) to deposit the licence fees except for complexes where water connection
have not been provided from the date on which the complexes were
rendered functional. The meeting notices that toilet complexes had been
constructed at places as the Tihar Jail, Samshan Ghat where there was no
requirement; at locations as at Mangol Puri, Sultan Puri etc. It was noticed
54

WP(C) No.10685/2004

that these CTCs were constructed in such clusters for which there were no
users beside the defects and deficiencies which were not being removed
despite regular letters to the concerned Executive Engineer. The minutes
record that the executive engineer would report on the matter and that
action would be taken against defaulting executive engineers.
70.

Despite the specific responsibility imposed on the executive

engineers, not a single report from any official of the MCD with regard to
any step taken to remove any of the deficiencies pointed out has been
placed before this court.

In addition to the above, the following specific

instances have also been noticed in these minutes :“10.

16.

these complexes.

19.
xxxx
20.
It was mentioned by one of the NGO that 1
complex of his group has been captured by the local
councilor. Addl. Commissioner ( S&JJ) asked the
executive Engineer/Field Monitor concerned to give the
report of this complex.”
72.

The petitioners have placed before this court even minutes of the

review meeting of the Yamuna Action Plan which was held on 22nd January,
2004 under the chairmanship of Shri Naresh Sharma, Additional Secretary,
Project Director which was circulated by the MCD along with its letter
59

WP(C) No.10685/2004

dated 30th January, 2004. These minutes' record the concern expressed by
the Chairman about the non-submission of the audit report even for the year
2002 by the MCD till the date of the meeting on 22 nd January, 2004. In the
meeting, it was decided that MCD submit the audit report for the year 2002
by 15th February, 2004 and for the year 2003 by 31st March, 2004.
73.

This fact by itself speak volumes about the conduct of the

officials of the MCD. As late as in January, 2004, even accounts of the year
2002 and 2003 had not been prepared. Obviously, MCD was not in a
position to label anyone as a defaulter or to take any kind of action against
them up to this date with regard to the CTCs under the Yamuna Action
Plan.
74.

So far as the other CTCs were concerned, other than 164 CTCs

which were the subject matter of the report of the Vishnu Sharma
Committee dated 16th September, 1999 and in respect of which the decision
dated 23rd March, 2000 had been taken by the then Commissioner, there was
no complaint with regard to their operation, worthiness and maintenance.
75.

It is noteworthy that there is no answer by the Municipal

Corporation of Delhi to any of these issues which were raised by the NGOs.
The fact that these problems existed is evident from the very presence of the
executive engineers and the field monitors who participated in these
meetings. Every meeting records that the executive engineer would report
with regard to the position as to the removal of the deficiencies and also
take immediate steps. Apart from repeatedly urging that the NGOs were

60

WP(C) No.10685/2004

defaulters, no material has been placed by the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi before this court to show that any of the decisions taken during these
meetings were implemented. The caution at the end of the record of the
minutes appears to have been intended only as a cosmetic protection for the
MCD, in the event that the NGOs resorted to any legal action against the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi.
76.

The MCD has not placed even iota of material before this court

to show that anything was done despite the specific problems which were
pointed out in the repeated meetings or action which was to be taken by the
executive engineers. No action has been pointed out as having been taken
even against the executive engineers who appear to have taken no action in
respect of these CTCs or against the contractors despite the specific
complaints. Defects admittedly existed. The NGOs were clamouring for
their removal. Despite repeated directions by the officials, the concerned
Executive Engineers do not appear to have moved an inch.
77.

In this behalf, it would be useful to refer to a status report of

operation and maintenance submitted by the field monitor appointed by the
NGO so far as M/s Bhagwati Foundation, (petitioner in W.P.(C) No.
10685/2004) is concerned. This report has been placed before the court
alongwith the rejoinder wherein the field monitor has pointed out that the
CTC bearing the site code no. 104 was closed due to the septic tank being
filled; the CTC at code no. 111 was not functional as Delhi Vidyut Board
electricity connection had not been provided; the floor had collapsed in the

61

WP(C) No.10685/2004

ladies section; there was no window in the caretaker room; the septic tank
was full and had not been connected with the sewer line. The position at
the CTC bearing code no. 112 was similar. This report even points out that
despite defects in other CTC bearing code no. 997, M/s Bhagwati
Foundation was still using it. The defects pointed out by the field monitor
in this CTC included seepage in the caretaker room, there was no boundary
wall in the back of the complex and there was seepage in the connection
between the complex and the septic tank.
What could be the utility of a CTC in which the septic tank was
full or of a toilet which was not connected to a sewer line?
78.

It is noteworthy that M/s. Bhagwati Foundation has further

complained that three complexes which were auctioned and allotted to it,
were located in hospitals.

Therefore as late as on 3rd January, 2004

problems relating to want of electricity and boring of tube wells for
provision of water in the CTCs was still being considered. These minutes
were circulated by the letter dated 21st January, 2004 to all concerned.
79.

So far as some of the other writ petitions are concerned, W.P.(C)

NO. 11865/2004 has been filed by the Himalayan Institute of Pollution
Control and Social and Economic Development. This institute successfully
bid for 19 CTCs, 9 under the Yamuna Action Plan and 10 under the Slum &
JJ Department. According to this writ petitioner, all the 9 CTCs which it
had successfully bid for under the Yamuna Action Plan were non-functional
when the allocation was made.

62

Out of these CTCs, 8 CTCs were made

WP(C) No.10685/2004

functional by the Himalayan Institute by spending its own funds. As on 27th
January, 2005 out of the 19 CTCs, 18 CTCs were functional, the one CTC
which was non-functional was due to non-user and its being situated in an
open area in the village. The writ petitioner has contended that the CTCs
were made functional by expenditure of substantial funds which was the
responsibility of the MCD.
The Himalayan Institute of Pollution Control & Social and
Economic Development has contended that the first letter addressed by the
MCD to it is on 3rd July, 2004. The petitioner addressed a detailed reply
dated 18th August, 2004 giving the status and pointing out that in the
minutes dated 11th July, 2003, noticed hereinabove, the MCD had agreed
that the payment of licence fee would be made after the CTCs are
functional.
80.

W.P.(C) 11857/2005 has been filed by the Dalit Manav Uthan

Sansthan which successfully bid for 18 CTCs under the Yamuna Action
Plan.

Nine were in a group which was numbered as no. 1 while the

remaining 9 were in group no. 50. The petitioner has claimed that all these
CTCs were non-functional when allocation was made. The petitioner has
made 6 CTCs in each group functional by spending its own funds. As on
27th January, 2005, 11 CTCs are functional while 7 of these are nonfunctional. The explanation given by the petitioner is that the site of the
Rajiv Gandhi Smriti Van became non-functional from 17th August, 2004
due to non-availability of electricity, choking of sewer line and failure of

63

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the tube well bore. The zoo site CTC which was alloted to the petitioner
was not available at all which has been included in the non-functional CTCs
while 5 of the CTCs are non-functional due to there being no sewer line
connection, electricity short circuiting and failure of the tube well bore etc.
81.

Writ petition being W.P.(C) NO. 12142/2004 has been filed by

the Akhil Bhartiya Manav Seva Sansthan which successfully bid for 20
CTCs. Nine of these CTCs formed part of group no. 2, while eleven formed
part of group no. 95. At the time when the CTCs were allocated, twenty
CTCs were non-functional.

The petitioner has claimed that it has

successfully made six CTCs in group no. 2 and eight CTCs in group no. 95
functional which brings the total to only thirteen. Therefore, 9 CTCs out of
the total of 20 allocated to this petitioner are non-functional. The reason
given by the petitioner for the CTCs still being non-functional are for the
reason that in three of the CTCs, there is failure of boring in the tube well;
one CTC stands encroached upon by the villagers, in one CTC the sewer
line is choked apart from other reasons and in two CTCs, no electricity has
been provided. Out of these two, it has been stated by the petitioner, that
one has still not been handed over.
Therefore, according to the petitioner, none of these causes for
the CTCs being non-functional can be attributed to the petitioner.
82.

In W.P.(C) 12944/2004 Rajya Jan Vikas Samiti v Commissioner,

MCD & Ors. with an affidavit dated 6th September, 2004, the MCD has
filed such handing over, taking over notes wherein in each of these notes, it

64

WP(C) No.10685/2004

has been recorded that the power connection and gensets have not been
provided as yet. The water sources in these CTCs was a tubewell.
It is for the MCD to explain as to how these CTCs could be
operated and maintained without electricity to run the tubewell. Rightly
none has been given.
83.

In W.P.(C) 13389/2004 Shakti Jan Sudhar Samiti v. The

Commissioner, MCD & Ors., the petitioner has placed reliance on a report
of a field monitor to the effect that the MCD had constructed the CTCs
behind the slaughters house. There was no water connection the borewell
had been provided which when started, instead of water, blood was coming
out.
The MCD has failed to reply to these submissions.

The

petitioner has also placed reliance on the handing over and taking over
reports placed before the court.

So far as 6 CTCs are concerned, the

petitioners have submitted that the survey report dated 6th July, 2004
prepared by Sulabh and MCD deserves to be scrutinized which supports the
case of the petitioner.
84.

Appearing for the petitioner, Mrs. Avnish Ahlawat, learned

counsel in W.P.(C) 7622/2005 Akhil Bhartiya Jan Rachnatmak Karya
Sansthan v. MCD submitted that though nine CTCs were allotted to this
petitioner, only six were actually handed over. The petitioner has been
repeatedly protesting to the MCD with regard to the CTCs allotted to it and
their misrable state. In this behalf, several letters have been placed on

65

WP(C) No.10685/2004

record several letters pointing out that there is no water supply in urinals, no
over flow pipe, no generator connections, several electric current problems,
water collection on the roof, choked sewers, broken toilet seats, etc. in all
the toilet complexes alloted to it. In this behalf, letters have been placed on
record from pages 151 to 167 which are amongst others dated 29 th October,
2002, 28th November, 2002, 10th May, 2003, 5th January, 2004 and the letter
dated 20th January, 2004.

This organisation wrote that inspite of the

repeated requests to correct the problems to the MCD in writing and orally,
the same were not being rectified and that possession of five toilet
complexes be taken back because this petitioner was bearing heavy
financial loss on looking after these toilet complexes. It was even stated
that these complexes could not be used on account of the problems which
were notified to the MCD since the time they were allotted. This petitioner
repeatedly further protested even thereafter by a communication dated 25th
February, 2004. In this letter, the petitioner even wrote that it had taken
possession of the toilet only on the assurance and pressure of the MCD that
the problems would be sorted out. In the letter dated 28th November, 2002,
the petitioner pointed out the deficiencies sitewise. The petitioner submits
that the MCD addressed a show cause notice to it on 25th February, 2004.
The petitioner responded by a letter dated 12th March, 2004

calling upon

the MCD to take back possession of the CTCs. The petitioner has also
pointed out that despite its licence from the MCD, the CTCs allotted to it
have been taken over by Metro. Again on 24th March, 2005, the petitioner

66

WP(C) No.10685/2004

wrote a letter informing the MCD that DDA has demolished the CTCs.
This petitioner had also placed reliance on a joint survey
conducted

by

the

Executive

Engineer(Electrical)

and

Executive

Engineer(CSE) conforming the defects in the CTCs. The petitioner has
complained that it is till date awaiting a response from the MCD on all these
issues.
85.

Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for the

petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos. 7855/2005 S.A.V.E.R.A. Thr. Secy. Mritun Vs.
Commissioner OF M.C.D. & Ors. and WP (C) No.8067/2005 M/S Rajya
Jan Vikas Samiti Vs. MCD & Ors. has also urged that in the instant case,
the decision to award the CTCs to Sulabh was not taken because the NGOs
had committed breaches of any agreement.On the other hand, it was because
the MCD had decided to award the CTCs to Sulabh that the contracts with
the NGO were cancelled. In this behalf, it is urged that the decision of the
MCD to rescind the agreement with the petitioners and cancel the same is in
violation of not only the terms of the contract which provided a notice but is
also in violation of the principles of natural justice inasmuch as grave
allegations having been levelled against the petitioners without giving them
an opportunity to meet the same.
Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the Apex Court in
(1974) 4 SCC 3 E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu it is urged that the
MCD cannot act at its whim and caprice. In fact the petitioners were
entitled to an equal opportunity to operate and maintain the CTCs on the

67

WP(C) No.10685/2004

terms as those on which the same have been offered to Sulabh. Thereby, the
MCD has denied the petitioners the right to consideration for the award of
work without consideration of the expertise and capability.
86.

In W.P.(C) 6945 - 48/2005 filed by Slum & Environment

Improvement Society & Ors. V MCD. on 19th April, 2005, the petitioner
has comprehensively challenged all the guidelines and decisions of the
MCD and sought the following prayer :
“a.
Call for the records of Municipal
Corporation of Delhi and quashed/set-aside the
proposal given in letter No. F.33/CSD/1047/C&C
dated 19.07.2004 and the resolution No. 400 dated
25.10.2004 of the Standing Committee of MCD hereby
the standing committee has approved the proposal of
commissioner, MCD vide his letter dated 19.7.2004
and also the consequent actions taken including the
letter dated 4.3.2005 and 16.3.2005 or proposed to be
taken by the respondents on the basis of said resolution
No. 400 of the Standing Committee; and/or
b.
Direct the respondent MCD not to hand
over all 1963 CTCs to Sulabh International Social
Service Organisation or any other agency without
inviting tenders or competitive bids and without
providing an opportunity to participate in the said
allocation of the work; and/or
c.
Direct the respondent MCD not to hand
over the Jan Suvidha Complexes (JSCs) allotted to the
petitioners as per the details given in para no. 7 of the
writ petition to Sulabh International Social Service
Organisation or any other agency without following
tender process; and/or
d.
Pass any other or further order/s as this
Hon'ble Court deems fit and proper in the facts and
circumstances of the case.”
This writ petition was filed by four NGOs who successfully
participated in the auctions of the CTCs. They have set out in a tabulation
the dates with effect from which they have maintained the CTCs and state

68

WP(C) No.10685/2004

that upto date licence fees stand paid by them. The copies of the receipts
issued by the MCD have been enclosed. It is noteworthy that no counter
affidavit has been filed and there is also no denial to the claims made by the
petitioner.
87.

Other writ petitions also relate similar difficulties. In any event,

the record of the meetings noticed hereinbefore are testimony to the
unfortunate saga and the appalling state of affairs.
88.

It is noteworthy that there is no dispute to these assertions by the

MCD.
89.

Mr. V.P. Choudhary, learned senior counsel appearing for the

petitioner in W.P.(C) 11865/2004 Himalayan Institute of Pollution Control
and Social Economic Development

has submitted that the MCD had

evolved the process of allotment of the CTCs to the NGOs after a detailed
report of the committee and deliberations thereon. The MCD, as a result of
its decision, had issued advertisements in national dailies having a wide
circulation and also displayed the same on the notice boards at relevant
places, besides informing the shortlisted NGOs by speed post, with regard
to the applicability of the terms and conditions alongwith the group list of
the CTCs as well as the auction schedule thereof. The NGOs were advised
by this advertisement also to visit the groups of community toilet complexes
constructed under the Yamuna Action Plan and collect such requisite
information as may be deemed fit before participating in the auction
programme. The notices clearly stated that the auction was being held for

69

WP(C) No.10685/2004

assignment of the complexes for purposes of operation and maintenance. It
has been vehemently urged that inherent in this stipulation was that the
CTCs were operable and maintainable, that is to say, that they were free of
defects and were in a ready to use condition. It has also been urged that the
petitioner was required to inspect these CTCs from the point of view of
financial viability of the group as it was not possible to inspect the same for
the purposes of assessment of the construction that is civil and electrical
defects which could have been revealed only after commissioning of the
CTCs.

No NGO was permitted to run the CTCs to ascertain their

operability. It is pointed out that the auctions were being held even prior to
the date of completion which was given to the contractors for construction
of the CTCs. There is force in the submission of learned senior counsel that
this clearly established the contention of the petitioner that the inspection
envisaged in the terms of auction was only to enable an inspection as to
whether the CTCs comprising a group were financially viable on the terms
and conditions on which the allotment was proposed.
Consideration afresh & changes in decisions
90.

In the meantime, an agenda item no. 348 captioned as “Free of

Cost Use of all Toilet Blocks Constructed Under Yamuna Action Plan” was
placed before the Standing Committee in its meeting held on 17 th December,
2003. By its resolution no. 673 passed on this date, the Standing Committee
recorded that 50% of these toilet blocks are either lying closed or not being
used due to their dilapidated condition and that the Corporation had given

70

WP(C) No.10685/2004

these toilet blocks on lease to various NGOs and these organisations are
charging Rs.1 to 2 per person for defecating facility while the abovesaid
organisation is contributing no amount to the corporation. For this reason,
the Standing Committee on 17th December, 2003 by the resolution no. 673
resolved that free of charge service to Delhites be provided by abolishing
the lease on all toilet blocks being run under the aforesaid scheme.
91.

On this resolution no. 673, the Commissioner of the MCD

recorded a noting in respect of the different measures which would be
required to be taken if the CTCs were to be operated on day to day basis by
either the MCD itself or by engaging any other agency with different terms
and conditions. It was noticed that in case the CTCs have to be run as free
of charge service to Delhites, an expenditure of Rs.12,000/- per CTC per
month which included caretaker, safai karamchari, electricity consumption,
cleaning material, maintenance of pumps/generating sets, site/building etc
was required.

Further, for running and maintaining all the 959 CTCs

constructed under the Yamuna Action Plan, the amount worked out to
Rs.10.2 crores approximately per month i.e. Rs.14 to 15 crores per year and
that the same would require allocation of funds in the yearly budget. The
Commissioner noticed that this would have an adverse effect on other toilet
complexes constructed by the MCD which are being maintained by various
NGOs on pay and use basis which would add a burden of Rs. 10 to 15
crores on the MCD to run the same.
The other alternative which was pointed out was that the CTCs

71

WP(C) No.10685/2004

were to be operated and maintained by appointing any other agency. In this
eventuality, the Commissioner noticed that such agency would demand
payment for operation and maintenance of these toilets on complex/seat
basis since the agency would have to pay the charges of electricity,
caretaker etc and it was to provide free of charge service. A problem with
regard to taking over the CTCs from the existing NGO and their operation
and maintenance in the period between taking over the CTCs from the
NGOs and handing over to other agencies was also required to be provided
for.

Terms and conditions on which operation and maintenance of the

CTCs would be given to the outside agency were to be examined and it was
also noticed that it would take four to five months in the transaction.
92.

It appears that the Commissioner of the MCD convened a

meeting on 3rd January, 2004 to discuss issues related to utilisation of the
CTCs and submission of the audit report as well as other pending issues
under the Yamuna Action Plan. In this meeting, upon discussion of the
issues, certain decisions were taken. It was noticed that the Central Ground
Water Authority had given permission for boring of tube wells for CTCs in
South and South West Delhi to the Delhi Jal Board. The position of boring
of the tube wells was reviewed. The OSD of the Yamuna Action Plan
informed the meeting that at two sites, boring was not done in the S Block,
Okhla and the Sangam Vihar Turning Point despite repeated reminders. A
direction was given to effect the boring be undertaken within 15 days. So
far as permanent electric connections at the CTC sites were concerned, it

72

WP(C) No.10685/2004

was reported that even as on 3rd January, 2004, permanent electric
connection at 85 sites had not been obtained due to the areas being
unelectrified and that some of the NGOs were running some of the CTCs
with the help of generating sets.

The issue which required a decision

related to consideration of a subsidy i.e. a difference between the running
cost of the generating sets compared to running of the CTCs with electricity
which had been recommended. The recommendation was that these
subsidies be adjusted in the respective licence fees payable by the operating
agencies i.e. the NGOs as the petitioners. This recommendation was
rejected by the Commissioner, MCD on the ground that the operating and
maintenance agencies were not paying their licence fees and not operating
all the CTCs.
In this meeting on 3rd of January, 2004, the Commissioner thus
decided as follows :“(2).
Commissioner MCD revised the position of
permanent electric connections at CTC sites. It was
reported by OSD (YAP) that till today permanent
electric connections at 85 sites have not been obtained
due to unelectrified area and mentioned that DG sets at
all the sites have been provided and some of the O&M
Agencies (NGOs) are already running the CTCs with
the help of these DG sets. However, some
consideration of subsidy (difference in running cost of
DG sets compared to running of the CTCs with
electricity) were included in the recommendations
forwarded. These subsidies have to be adjusted in
their respective licence fees payable by the O&M
Agencies. However Commissioner, MCD mentioned
that O&M Agencies are not paying their licence fees
and are not operative all the CTCs hence this kind of
subsidy cannot be considered. It was decided by
Commissioner MCD that CTCs which are not
73

WP(C) No.10685/2004

functioning shall be handed over to M/s. Sulabh
International for operation and maintenance without
levy of any charges because M/s.Sulabh International
is highly professional and experienced Agency and can
make these CTCs functional. It was decided to prepare
the list of CTCs which are not functional and which
can be considered for handing over to M/s.Sulabh
International is to be contacted by Addl.Commissioner
(S&JJ) to conduct the survey of these CTCs and then
submit their proposal.
(3).
It was mentioned by OSD (YAP) that some
complexes have been constructed in the Institutional
Areas like Tihar Jail, Delhi Zoo, Hindu Rao Hospital
etc., and it was decided by Commissioner, MCD to
hand over these CTCs which have been constructed in
Institutional Areas to the concerned Institution and
asked to put the file before him for taking decision in
the matter.
(4).
It was mentioned by OSD (YAP that audit
report for the financial year ending March, 2002 has
still not been submitted to Ministry of environment &
Forest, GOI and JBIC Commissioner, MCD asked the
CA, MCD to look into the matter and submit the audit
report to the JBIC through ministry of Environment &
Forest.
(5).
It was mentioned by the Chief Engineers of
MCD
General Wing present in the meeting that payments
have still not been made to the Contractors for
construction of CTCs under Yamuna Action Plan
Commissioner, MCD asked OSD (YAP) about the
pending amount of Rs.16 crores (approx.) OSD (YAP)
explained that ministry of Environment & Forest has
already cleared their position in respect of this
payment in the meeting held on 16th July 2003 and they
have also mentioned this amount can be released now,
as the entire account of the Yamuna Action Plan
Phase-I have already been closed and the Loan
Agreement with JBIC in respect of Yamuna Action
Plan Phase-I have already been finalised and further
funds will not be available. Further while releasing the
entire amount by the Ministry of Environment &
Forest it was clearly mentioned that this amount were
not allowed due to the reasons (a) DG sets and (b)
Construction of CTCs in clusters in Mangolpur,
Sultanpuri, Gokulpuri & Jwalapuri by the MCD
74

WP(C) No.10685/2004

93.

General Wing Commissioner, MCD has desired to
identify some commercial plots, which can be sold and
payment can be made to the Contractors.
(6).
OSD (YAP) mentioned that decision for
appointment of M/s.TERI for continuing with the
Public Participation & Public Awareness programme
is still pending and the funds of Rs.45 lacs (Approx.)
under the Module-IV are still available with the
Department.
Commissioner, MCD mentioned that
there is no need for appointment of M/s.TERI to
continue with the Pubic Awareness Programme and the
funds available under this Module can be utilized for
making payments to the Contractors and asked OSD
(YAP) to put up the case before him for taking
decision in the matter.
(7)
Commissioner, MCD also mentioned that
no further meeting will be taken by him in respect of
construction of CTCs under Yamuna Action Plan
Phase-I and that any decisions that are required to be
taken on any pending issue, the Addl.Commissioner
(S&JJ) should put up the concerned file for necessary
approval and orders.”
It appears that there was a change of thought as on 3rd January,

2004. Despite noticing that several sites of the CTCs had not been handed
over to the NGOs and also subsidies had to be approved with regard to
certain running costs, boring of wells for the water supply had not be
undertaken at several sites and several others were without electric
connections, the Commissioner decided that CTCs which are not
functioning would be handed over to Sulabh for operation and maintenance
without levy of any charges because Sulabh is highly professional and
experiences agency and can make these functional. A list of such 346 CTCs
was prepared which was handed over to Sulabh.
94.

On 22nd January, 2004, a Review meeting of the Yamuna Action

Plan in Delhi was held under the chairmanship of Shri Naresh Dayal,

75

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Additional Secretary and Project Director, NRCD, Ministry of Environment
and Forest at the Paryavaran Bhawan, New Delhi.
95.

The petitioners in these writ petitions ie. the NGOs have

complained that they were not called for this meeting while Shri
Bindeshwari Pathak, Chairman of Sulabh International Social Service
Organisation was called for this meeting.
96.

So far as CTCs are concerned in this meeting, the following

decisions were taken :“(1). Status of utilization of CTCs:_ MCD officials
informed that the proposed action plan and measures for
increasing the utilization level of CTCs have not been
agreed by the Mayor/Standing Committee, MCD
officials also informed that the CTCs, which are locked
and not being run by NGOs for want of their running.
The representative of M/s.Sulabh informed that a
decision to take over such CTCs will be taken after
proper field survey in the light of their location and
scope of utilization.

97.

The Chairman directed that since in original plan all the
CTCs were proposed to be run on “pay and use” basis to
make them self sustainable, MCD should again take up
the matter with Mayor/Standing Committee for
implementation of action plan and other measures for
increasing the utilization level of CTCs as discussed in
the last review meeting.
xxx”
The petitioners have pointed out that at this stage the Field

Monitors appointed by the MCD were all giving reports which clearly
evidenced that no fault was attributable to the NGOs for the CTCs not being
in operational condition.
98.

It appears that the MCD was required to submit a status report to

the Ministry of Environment and Forest inasmuch as funding for the CTCs
76

WP(C) No.10685/2004

was provided by it. One such background note on the Yamuna Action Plan
prepared for MCD for the Ministry has been placed by M/s Bhagwati
Foundation before this court. This document is undated. However, there is
no dispute to the same by the MCD. In this background note of the MCD,
it has been noticed that MCD has received an amount of Rs.51,50,000/- as
security deposit in the auction process conducted and Rs.94,81,185/- as
licence fees for the first quarter alone and that the same has been kept in the
Escrow Account as noticed above. This background note also records the
following :“Although all out efforts have been made to recover
the licence fees for the subsequent quarters, but the
same could not be realised due to various reasons
enumerated below :1)
Permission for boring of tube-wells from
CGWA
2)
Permanent electric connections
3)
Permission for sewer connections from DJB
4)
Non-shifting of population in new
settlement colonies due to Hon'ble High Court Orders
5)
Peoples habit of open defecation and hence
not utilising the CTCs
A decision was taken in the meting chaired
by Sh. K.C. Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of
Environment & Forest, GOI in December, 2002 to
review the operationalisation of CTCs constructed
under Yamuna Action Plan.
The proposal based on recommendations
given by the Committee headed by FA(S&JJ) along
with other Officers duly constituted by Commissioner,
MCD to conduct a detailed review of functioning of all
the CTCs constructed under Yamuna Action Plan were
approved by Hon'ble Standing Committee through
Commissioner, MCD in principal.
Regular review meetings were again held by
Add. Commissioner (S&JJ) with the NGOs (O&M
Agencies) & concerned Executive Engineers
(Civil/Electrical) of General Wing and Slum & JJ
77

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Wing, MCD where the Chief Engineer (S) & FA(S)
also participated.
The O&M Agencies also expressed their
difficulties and problems in respect of (a) water, (b)
electricity, © defects/deficiencies in certain complexes,
(d) CTCs constructed in clusters & institutional areas,
(e) public not ready to pay the user charges of Rs. 1/as per the term and agreement, (f) insufficient number
of users, (g) old Jan Suvidha Complexes existed in
dilapidated condition not demolished etc.
The O&M Agencies also suggested the
following solutions :(a)
Reduction in the pay & use
charges from Rs.1/- to Rs. 0.50 paise and in certain
cases free use of toilets.
(b)
Consideration in giving subsidy
to O&M Agencies where the O&M Agencies are
running the CTCs with DG Sets where no permanent
electric connections are obtained .
(c)
Exemption from licence fees
where tube-wells are not bored.
(d)
Demolition of the dilapidated
Jan Suvidha Complexes existing near the new CTCs so
as to prevent the public to use the old dilapidated
complexes.
(e)
CTCs constructed in the
Institutional areas to be made operational and to be
handed over to O&M Agencies.
(f)
licence fees to be charged from
the actual date of functioning of the CTCs including
payment of electricity bills.
(g)
O&M Agencies were prepared
to pay the full licence fees for the complexes, which
are running properly and concessions in the licence
fees for such complexes where no users are coming
forward or in resettlement colonies where the
population has not been shifted.
Further detailed deliberations with O&M
Agencies and Officers of Slum & JJ Department and
General Wing, MCD the following problems are being
faced in the real functioning of the CTCs and they
seem to be quite genuine.
a)
Non-availability of water due to
delay in obtaining permission for boring of tube-wells
in South & South-West Delhi from CGWA.
b)
Non-obtaining of permanent
78

WP(C) No.10685/2004

99.

electric connections for CTCs and CTCs constructed in
un-electrified areas.
c)
CTCs constructed in clusters in
certain localities with the result sufficient number of
users do not exist and the some of the CTCs are kept
locked.
d)
Public do not want to pay the
usage charges of Rs.1/- which they consider high,
especially in resettlement colonies and in residential
areas where slum population exist.
e)
CTCs constructed in the
resettlement areas like Cremation Ground, CRPF
Camp. Delhi Zoo, Red Fort, etc. are not being utilised.
f)
Non-availability of sewerage
connections in certain areas.
g)
The O&M Agencies are facing
difficulties in running of the CTCs, payment of licence
fees to MCD, payment of electricity bills and insurance
premium, since the O&M Agencies have bid very high
rates for some groups of CTCs, at the time of auction
due to which they are finding it not economically
viable. Due to this some of the NGOs have gone to the
extent of surrendering their group of toilet complex.”
(emphasis supplied)
Upon consideration of these difficulties, the then Additional

Commissioner, Slum & JJ forwarded certain recommendations to the
competent authorities to streamline the proper functioning of the CTCs.
The background note records that the approval was still awaited on these
aspects. Inter alia, these recommendations included the following :“( i)
The date from which the licence fee
should be charged maybe reckoned from the date of
functioning and not from the date of handing over.
In such cases where the functioning was held up
mainly because of incomplete Community Toilet
Complexes, the date of actual functioning should be
authenticated by the concerned Executive Engineers
with adequate reasons.
(ii)
Electricity bills in all such cases shall be
paid by the NGO from the date of functioning only.
However, the minimum electricity
charges shall be payable from the date of handing
79

WP(C) No.10685/2004

over.
(iii)
The electricity charges prior to the date of
handing over shall be borne by the Deptt. and a
certificate from the Executive Engineer (Electrical)
shall be obtained to this effect.
(iv)
No Licence fee be charged for the
complexes located in Re-location colonies, where the
population has not been shifted due to High Court
Orders, which are not put to use but are locked up.
(vi)
No licence fee of CTCs shall be charged
where tubewell are not bored.
(vii)
Where permanent electric connection are
not obtained and in Un Electrified Areas where the
NGO is running the CTCs with DG set, concession
may be granted on case to case basis, on the
difference in cost to run the CTCs with DG sets and
with electricity.
(ix)
Immediate measures should be taken to
demolish the dilapidated Jan Suvidha Complexes
existing near the Community Toilet Complexes so
that the public do not use the old & dilapidated
complexes/prefab Community Toilet Complexes.
This has to be done by CSE Deptt. of MCD.
(x)
The CTCs constructed in institutional
areas like Red Fort, Cremation ground, CRPF,
Horticulture Deptt., Zoo, etc. should be handed over
to the respective institution for operation &
maintenance of CTCs without levying any charges
and the NGOs should also be not charged the licence
fee.
(xi)
These concessions have to be worked out
on case-to-case basis and it will be applicable only to
the NGOs who are :a)
Paying the licence fee for
every quarter, and who have cleared the entire
licence fee up to date, especially of those, which are
running properly.
b)
Payment of all the electricity
bills.
c)
Payment
of
Insurance
premium as per the terms of agreement.
d)
NGO's who have signed the
formal agreement with the concerned Executive
Engineer (Civil)
e)
For NGO's who are making all
efforts for conducting Public Awareness programs as
80

required by them, providing of proper display
boards, maintaining all records etc. as per the terms
of agreement.”
Thereafter, a meeting was held on 30th April, 2004 minutes of

which were circulated on 11th May, 2004 and make very interesting reading
as they disclose decision making at the highest level in the MCD. Apart
from senior officers of the MCD, Sulabh was represented and participated.
None of the other NGOs were called. They are also evidence of the manner
in which public property constructed by expending Rs.7 crores granted by
the Japanese Bank with Central Government participation is dealt with
`Decisions' are taken because Sulabh `submitted' & `mentioned', the
Additional Commissioner informed and it was `impressed upon by the
Commissioner, MCD'. The minutes of the meeting dated 30th April, 2004
record thus:“It was informed by Addl. Commissioner
(CSE) that as per the decision taken in the meeting held
on 03-01-04, a meeting was convened by her on 20-0104 wherein the issue regarding handing over of nonfunctional CTCs was discussed with the Representatives
of M/s Sulabh International and it was agreed by them
to do the detailed survey of all the non-functional CTCs
and submit the detailed survey report along with their
proposal. The list of 346 non-functional CTCs was
handed over to M/s Sulabh International in the meeting
held on 22-01-04 under the Chairmanship of Addl.
Commissioner (S&JJ) on 22-01-04 to complete the
survey within 15 days time, but they submitted the
report after a lapse of 2 months.
M/s Sulabh International after conducting
the detailed survey, submitted their detailed report vide
letter No.SISSO/5239/2004 dated 24th March, 04 vide
which they have mentioned that most of the toilet
complexes are locked or closed and majority of them are
made in clusters or are very near to each other and
hence most of them are non-functional as there are not
81

WP(C) No.10685/2004

many users. The basic structures of most of the
complexes are sound but their electrical fittings, WCs,
GI pipes, etc. are stolen or damaged and in some cases
doors have also been damaged or stolen.
M/s Sulabh International have mentioned
that taking over of 346 toilet complexes would not be a
viable propositions, as large number of toilet complexes
are in bad condition, the principle of cross subsidisation
will not work. It would not, therefore, be possible to
take over them. They have also proposed as an
alternative, if all 959 toilet complexes constructed under
Yamuna Action Plan including these 346 CTCs are
handed over to them, they will be able to operate,
maintain and run them on `pay and use' basis on cross
subsidisation basis for a period of 30 years along with
advertisement rights on these complexes.
It was further informed by Addl.
Commissioner (CSE) that in the light of above, another
meeting was convened by her wherein it was decided
that all the complexes, which are at present functional
under the charge of CSE Department should also be
handed over to M/s Sulabh International for operation
and maintenance. It was agreed by M/s Sulabh
International to do survey of all these CTCs and submit
the detailed report along with the proposals of each of
the complex within one month i.e. by 30th April, 2004,
which is still awaited.
In the meeting, it was impressed upon by the
Commissioner, MCD that the idea of getting licence
fees from the NGOs to operate and maintain CTCs is
not working out well as most of the NGOs after taking
initially at some bid/tender rate defaults in making
payments of the due licence fees and other related
charges and thereby jeopardising the whole purpose of
giving it to NGOs and he also shown his dis-satisfaction
regarding operation and maintenance of CTCs by the
existing 70 NGOs and also non-payment of due licence
fees, insurance premium, electricity bills, etc. However,
various communications have already been sent to all
the Executive Engineer by the Addl. Commissioner
(S&JJ) to take immediate necessary action against the
defaulting NGOs for recovery of licence fees, insurance
premium, electricity bills, etc.
This matter was further discussed with the
Representative of M/s Sulabh International present in
the meeting wherein they have reiterated their stand that
82

WP(C) No.10685/2004

101.

“if all 959 toilet complexes constructed under Yamuna
Action Plan including these 346 CTCs are handed over
to them, they will be able to operate, maintain and run
them on `pay & use' basis on cross subsidisation basis
for a period of 30 years along with advertisement rights
on these complexes”.
In the meeting, it was decided by
Commissioner, MCD to rescind all the present contract
of operation & maintenance of CTCs with the NGOs as
most of them are defaulting in making payment of
licence fees and other related charges, etc. Engineer-inChief, MCD has to convene a meeting of all the
concerned Executive Engineers to impress upon them
for taking immediate action against the defaulting
NGOs.
It was decided to hand over all the 959 CTCs
constructed under Yamuna Action Plan and 413 CTCs
under the charge of CSE Department as reported by Jt.
Director V (CSE) to M/s Sulabh International for
operation & maintenance by the end of June, 2004 for a
period of 30 years on lease basis with a facility of
advertisement right on these complexes, on the terms &
conditions to be finalised by Addl. Commissioner
(S&JJ) and Addl. Commissioner (CSE). The operation
& maintenance of CTCs will be done by M/s Sulabh
International on no profit no loss basis and all the
maintenance such as annual repairs & maintenance,
day-to-day maintenance, wages of Caretaker and Safai
Karamchari, electricity charges, etc. will be done by
them and Department will not have any liability to that
effect. These complexes will be taken over by them on
as is where is basis.”
Thus, the decision to rescind all present contracts of operation

and maintenance of all the CTCs with the NGOs and to hand over the 413
toilet complexes under the CSD department, Slum & JJ Department and the
959 CTCs under Yamuna Action Plan to Sulabh. Sulabh had demanded
only the 959 complexes. The decision included a decision to hand over
operation and maintenance to it for a period of 30 years on lease basis with
the facility of advertisement rights on these complexes. These CTCs were

83

WP(C) No.10685/2004

to be handed over on an 'as is where is basis'.
The decision to rescind all the contracts with the NGOs was
taken as “most of them are defaulting in making payment of the licence
fees”. Thus, admittedly, all the NGOs were not defaulting in payment of the
licence fees. So far as other 413 CTCs which were functional under the
charge of CSE department of the MCD were concerned, there was no reason
whatsoever for the decision taken.
There was also no assessment as to what would be the cost of the
operation and maintenance, financial implications of a lease of 30 years,
assessment of the revenue which would be generated by the advertisement
right on a single complex, on the cluster or on all the complexes. The
meeting held on 30th April, 2004 uses expressions as “most of them are
defaulting”; “payments of other related charges etc.”
Therefore, the decision of the Commissioner, MCD on 3rd
January, 2004, that only such CTCs as were not functional would be handed
over to Sulabh, it was widened on 30th April, 2004. According to Sulabh, it
had not even undertaken the inspection of the 346 CTCs which were not
operational as most were lying locked.
Interestingly, no other person was called to these meetings.
There was certainly no material before the Commissioner or the MCD as to
which of the NGOs has been performing and which is non-performing.
There was no assessment or record with regard to payments which have
been received and made and as to whether these are dues of any of the

84

WP(C) No.10685/2004

NGOs. No decision was taken on the repeated recommendations of the
Addl. Commissioner, Slum & JJ with regard to the factors which needed to
be considered prior to imposition of liabilities upon the NGOs. Not a
single notice as contemplated under Clause 15.5 of the licence agreements
had been issued or had been placed before the Commissioner either on 3rd
January, 2004 or 30th April, 2004.
102.

Thereafter, on 7th June, 2004, in a meeting held under the

Chairmanship of the Additional Commissioner (CSE) the decision was
reiterated to hand over all the 2066 CTC complexes (i.e. 1042 CTCs under
the General Wing; 413 under the CSE Department and 611 CTCs under the
Slum & JJ Wing) to Sulabh for operation and maintenance on a 30 year
lease period with the facility of advertisement rights. These complexes
were to be taken over by Sulabh on an 'as is where is' basis.
103.

It is noteworthy that despite prolonged hearing in the matter,

even at the time the matter was reserved for judgment, nothing was placed
before this court with regard to the consideration or any decision taken on
these recommendations by the competent authorities in the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi.
104.

My attention has been drawn to minutes of a meeting held on 7 th

of June, 2004 under the Chairmanship of the Additional Commissioner
(CSE) again attended by officials of the MCD & Sulabh. From these
minutes, it is disclosed that:(i)

the MCD had sent a copy of the draft terms & conditions to

85

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Sulabh for their comments.
(ii)

MCD had proposed a condition on Sulabh to deposit Rs.5 crores

on account of security.
Sulabh had objected on the ground that in the other complexes
being maintained by them, no such condition was imposed.
So this condition was also abandoned.
(iii)

the decision was taken that “all the present contracts either

with NGOs or with Sulabh International should be rescinded and all the
2066 complexes constructed by general wing/CSE Department/Slum & JJ
Department should be handed over to Sulabh International for operation and
maintenance on the uniform terms and conditions to be decided mutually.”
There is not a whit of a reason for the above decisions. No
material or basis for the above is disclosed to this court nor forth coming
from the records which were called for.
Most important is the question raised in the last para of these
minutes which reads thus:“In the meeting, Addl. Commissioner (CSE) mentioned
that a decision is required to be taken that whether first
present contracts should be rescind or first Agreement
with M/s Sulabh International is to be signed. It was
decided that this decision will be taken by CLO (MCD).”
A decision on this aspect has not been placed before this court
till date.
105.

It is noteworthy that so far as 1004 CTCs were concerned, there

was no complaint by the MCD or by any user so far as their operation,
maintenance and management is concerned. Out of these, 373 CTCs were
86

WP(C) No.10685/2004

under

the

operation,

maintenance

and

management

of

other

NGOs(including some of the petitioners for several years prior to 2004).
Three hundred and fifty seven CTCs were under the direct operation,
management and maintenance of the MCD, which the citizens were
permitted to use on a free of charge basis.
106.

Matters did not stop here.

On the 21st June, 2004 another

meeting was held under the Chairmanship of the Commissioner, MCD. In
this meeting, Sulabh mentions that some of the complexes are in a very bad
condition where major repair is required and taking over of complexes on
“as is where is basis” will not be possible for them.
On 21st June, 2004, itself the Commissioner decided that each
CTC would be inspected by a joint team of MCD and representatives of
Sulabh to assess and record the condition of each CTC and make an
assessment of the expenditure required for renovation, rectification and
removal of major defects/structural defects, provision of missing articles
etc. It was further decided that the work would be done by Sulabh while the
cost was to be borne by the MCD so that “quality work” is done and Sulabh
does the work to its own satisfaction after receipt of the estimated cost
involved from the MCD. The duration of this inspection was to be from 1st
July, 2004 to be completed by 31st July, 2004.
Legal proceedings and MCDs action thereafter
107.

On the 8th July, 2004, M/s Bhagwati Foundation which was

successful in being allocated operation and maintenance of nine CTCs, filed

87

WP(C) No.10685/2004

a Writ Petition (C) 10685/2004. This petitioner has contended that after the
allocation, it found that the CTCs could, in no situation, be operated or
maintained provided initial deficiencies/defects in the construction work
were rectified, removal of malba from septic tank, repairing of electric lines,
electric meter and construction of care taker room, removal of seepage etc.
was effected. Innumerable letters at regular intervals were addressed to the
MCD and its officers apart from the defects being confirmed in joint
inspections. Even though, the officials of the MCD accepted the existence
of these defects in the CTCs. However, in the meanwhile, it kept sending
letters to the petitioners demanding lincence fee.

The MCD did not

consider the request of the petitioner for incorporating the defects etc. in the
agreement. The petitioner throughout was willing to deposit the charges for
the CTCs which were functional.

Various complexex in dilapidated

conditions were unauthorisedly permitted to function in the minimum
vicinity of the new complexes, constructed under the Yamuna Action Plan
which were to be demolished but not done so. Placing reliance on the
minutes of the meetings held on 2nd, 9th, 10th, 15th, 17 & 18th July, 2003, it
was asserted that the MCD was bound by the representation made in these
meetings. However, without taking any action, a decision was taken to
hand over the CTCs to Sulabh without levy of any charges. The petitioner
has placed before this court copy of the minutes of the meeting dated 21 st
January, 2004 and official memorandum dated 30th January, 2004 wherein
this position was accepted. The petitioner has challenged the claim of the

88

WP(C) No.10685/2004

MCD that Sulabh was a highly professional and experienced agency and
placed reliance on instances cited in the petition.
The petitioner was compelled to file a writ petition on the ground
that it had made payment of huge amount towards licence fee including the
amount of Rs.1,14,000/- even on 1st July, 2004 yet the MCD had illegally
issued a letter dated 10th March, 2004 demanding an exorbitant amount of
Rs.16,26,024/-.

This communication was also in the nature of a show

cause notice issued to the petitioner and it was stated that if no cause was
shown then action would be taken by the MCD. M/s Bhagwati Foundation
has contended that it had also addressed a detailed communication to the
MCD and the decision stated therein was confirmed by it. It also sent a
letter dated 1st July, 2004 to the executive engineer giving the position CTCwise. It was averred that in the light of the above, there was no dues of this
petitioner and the proposed action of the MCD was bad in law.
As the MCD appeared to be proceeding with the decision taken
to allot the CTC to Sulabh, the petitioner filed this writ petition.
108.

M/s Bhagwati Foundation has challenged the action of the MCD

on grounds of arbitrariness and discrimination hence being violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. It has further been urged that the
decision to allocate is without following due process of law and amounts to
creation of a monopoly unreasonably and illegally in favour of one person.
The decision is without taking into consideration any of the relevant factors
and is based on misconception. The petitioner has urged at length that the

89

WP(C) No.10685/2004

officials of the MCD are bound by the assurances and representations to the
petitioner to rectify the defects and deficiencies which were their obligation
which they have failed to do despite innumerable requests. It is further
contended that CTCs allocated were incapable of being operated and
maintained. It was also urged that the petitioner was an organisation of
repute and doing commendable social work and that the demand raised
upon it was arbitrary.
109.

M/s Bhagwati Foundation has dwelt at length about the conduct

of the officials of the MCD, who issued routine letters to it requiring it to
enter into the agreement and chose not to discharge their statutory functions
and public law obligations in any manner. The petitioner has also pointed
out that an arbitrary and malafide decision was taken by the MCD to hand
over the CTCs to Sulabh International without levy of any charges. This
decision was taken by the MCD without discharging its obligations. Details
of allegations against Sulabh which have been noticed herein were pointed
out in the writ petition and it was averred that the MCD ought not to
undertake handing over the CTCs to Sulabh International without following
due process of law and undertaking the process of inviting tenders and
permitting all other persons to participate. The petitioner contended that the
MCD had squandered the amount of Rs. 7 crores given by the Japanese
Bank of International Cooperation towards promoting hygiene and
sanitation for the protection of the environment involved in the Yamuna
Action Plan, primarily on the ground that its officials had displayed non-

90

WP(C) No.10685/2004

professionalism and incompetence and who were following arbitrary
practices and frittering away valuable aid. Bulky annexures were enclosed
with the writ petition and the following prayers were made by the
petitioners:

110.

“1)
call for the records of the respondent and
quash the letter dated 10.3.2004 whereby the
respondent MCD has raised an illegal demand of
Rs.16,26,024/- and direct the respondents to charge
license fee from the date on which the CTC become
functional and not from the date of handing over of
CTC; or
2)
direct the respondent MCD not
to take any coercive measures and withdraw the CTCs
allocated tot he petitioner; or
3)
direct the respondent MCD to remove
initial civil, electric and other deficiencies and offer
full cooperation to make the CTCs operational;
4)
direct the respondent MCD not to hand
over the CTCs allocated to the petitioner to Sulabh
International Social Service Organisation or any other
agency without following due process of law; and
5)
pass any other or further order/s as this
Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper.”
Alongwith this writ petition, the petitioner filed an application

seeking interim relief. When the matter came up for hearing on 9th July,
2004 while issuing notice to the respondent to show cause as to why rule
nisi be not issued, this court on 9th of July, 2004 passed interim orders of
status quo in respect of the nine CTCs allocated to the petitioner.
111.

It is therefore noteworthy that on service of the advance copy of

the writ petition being WP (C) No.10685/2004 Bhagwati Foundation v.
MCD, the respondents including the MCD were aware of the nature of the
challenge to its action being made by the NGOs.
112.

Mr. V.P. Choudhary, learned senior counsel appearing for the
91

WP(C) No.10685/2004

petitioners in W.P.(C) 11865/2004, M/s Himalayan Institute of Pollution
Control & Social and Economic Development has pointed out that this writ
petition was also filed in the middle of July, 2004 and an interim order had
been passed in this matter on 27th July, 2004 in favour of the petitioner.
This petitioner had categorically taken the stand that it had not received any
notice whatsoever of any kind of a breach from the MCD at any point of
time. It has been contended that on or around the 3rd August, 2004, the
petitioner received a notice from the MCD which had been ante dated as
23rd July, 2004 (Annexure P21 at page 301) wherein the MCD had only
raised a financial demand without making any allegation that the CTCs
were not functioning. The petitioner has given a detailed reply thereto on
18th August, 2004 wherein details of the defects in every single CTC were
pointed out.
113.

Significantly, it is after only after the filing of the writ petition

by Bhagwati Foundation and passing of the orders therein, that the
Commissioner of the MCD addressed a communication dated 19th July,
2004 and efforts were made to put together a semblance of application of
mind to the decisions making by the respondents.
In this letter dated 19th July, 2004, the Commissioner set out his
aforenoticed recommendation to hand over the CTCs to Sulabh and
requested that this proposal alongwith the draft memorandum of
understanding be placed before the corporation through the Standing
Committee for according approval for handing over the 1963 community

92

WP(C) No.10685/2004

toilet complexes to Sulabh for operation and maintenance on lease basis for
a period of 30 years with the facility of advertisement rights on these
complexes.
114.

Upon considering the proposal of the Commissioner as

contained in his letter dated 19th July, 2004, the Standing Committee by a
resolution no. 202 dated 21st July, 2004 resolved to constitute a SubCommittee of 5 members to submit its report.
115.

The Sub-committee submitted its report wherein it recorded that

the NGOs after taking over complexes started collection of money from
such of the public toilet complexes which gave good returns profits and
closed down and shut those of the CTCs which were proving to be
unprofitable. It was stated that simultaneously they started writing to the
MCD justifying closure of such complexes with a view to evade depositing
further the bid amounts due from them resulting in arrears and loss of
reveune. Names of 15 NGOs were mentioned which includes only such
NGOs who had filed writ petitions. It was stated that loss of revenue was to
the tune of Rs.45-60 crores which was taken by loan from the Japan Bank
of International Cooperation and that further that the purpose of the
Yamuna Action Plan, which was reduction of pollution from sewage of the
river Yamuna, stood defeated. It was alleged that the dual responsibility in
the maintenance of the toilet was responsible for the lack of maintenance.
The Sub-committee placed strong reliance on the recommendation of the
Commissioner, MCD which, according to it, had taken into consideration

93

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the past experience of construction and maintenance of public toilets by the
MCD itself and that by Sulabh as well as by other NGOs. It noticed that the
Commissioner's view was based on the fact that “the organisation has
greater credibility and trust worthiness than enjoyed at present by any other
NGO working with the MCD”.
116.

The Sub-committee also noted that handing over of the toilet

complex to Sulabh would be in public interest and that the organisation had
been awarded works on nomination basis by almost all the states and union
territories of India. It noticed that even High Courts of Rajasthan and
Himachal Pradesh have accepted the decision so taken by the state
government. It recorded that no dispute had arisen between MCD and
Sulabh in respect of toilet complexes which were constructed by Sulabh i.e.
about 100 toilet and their maintenance for 30 years because the sole
responsibility lay with Sulabh except as regard supply of electricity, water
and septic tank cleaning.

Comparing this experience with 700 toilets

constructed during 1989 to 1992 for the MCD by contractors which
allegedly developed defects, it was also noticed that out of 166 of these
toilet complexes handed over to Sulabh, they maintained them for 12 years
while in 2001 MCD withdrew the maintenance of 66 of such complexes
giving them to different NGOs. Within two to three years, about 30 of these
66 CTCs became dysfunctional while the remaining 36 were in a state of
total dis-repair. Thus, according to the Committee, out of 700, only 83
CTCs looked after by Sulabh were well maintained while NGOs which took

94

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the toilets on bids are not paying the amounts payable by them. On this
basis, it was concluded that toilets built under the Yamuna Action Plan
“will meet the same fate as that of 700 toilets built by the contractors.
The MCD did not learn the lesson from its past experience of getting
toilets constructed by contractors and again committed the same
mistake.”
117.

On these considerations, the five member committee made the

following recommendations :-

118.

“After examining everything in detail and taking all
aspects of the matter into consideration, the Committee
has arrived at the conclusion that construction, repair
and maintenance of Public Toilets in MCD area by
Sulabh International Social Service Organisation will
be in public interest and that this arrangement be made
for the first time to ensure that responsibility is not
divided and the public Toilets are maintained for
public use without putting any financial burden on the
MCD.
Therefore, the Committee is in favour of the
proposal put before the Standing Committee by the
Commissioner, MCD to hand over in public interest
the maintenance to Sulabh International Social Service
Organisation.”
Unfortunately, this report is also replete with generalisations.

'Public interest' is cited as a justification without any consideration as to
how the decision was for the benefit of the public. It does not even consider
which elements of public interest were satisfied.

Furthermore, the

committee has based its decision on the “past experience” of construction of
toilets. The proposal under consideration does not entail construction. The
NGOs could not operate the defective toilets taken back from Sulabh as
admittedly there were defects in these.
95

So far as the CTCs under the
WP(C) No.10685/2004

Yamuna Action Plan were concerned, the Committee based its
recommendation on an apprehension that they “will meet the same fate”.
This sub-committee has completely overlooked the costs which were to
enure to the MCD in effecting the repairs before handing over the CTCs to
Sulabh which were running into several crores. The revenue which could
be earned by MCD from advertising and the revenue loss from the return of
the security amounts to the NGOs running the 959 CTCs under the Yamuna
Action Plan as well as the loss of the license fee which they were to pay.
The sub-committee has completely ignored the fact that several NGOs were
successfully operating and maintaining CTCs without complaints.
Therefore, so far as Delhi was concerned, Sulabh was not the only option
available to operate and maintain the CTCs and consequently reliance on
the allocations of CTCs to Sulabh without public tendering by other states
and cities was misconceived. Additionally, it failed to consider the material
fact that several NGOs were regularly paying the license fee and running
the toilets.
119.

During the course of submissions on behalf of the petitioners,

Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned senior counsel has pointed out that Mr.
Vijender Kumar Gupta, who was one of the members of the Sub-Committee
appointed on 21st July, 2004, raised several pertinent questions in writing by
a letter dated 28th July, 2004. The MCD had sent a reply to the queries
raised by the aforesaid Mr. Gupta which would establish beyond any doubt
the fact that the MCD had not taken any of the relevant material into

96

WP(C) No.10685/2004

consideration and had placed reliance on wholly extraneous and irrelevant
considerations in its decision making which also displayed blatant nonapplication of mind.
120.

On the other hand, Mr. Valmiki Mehta, learned senior counsel

for the MCD has sought to brush aside the reliance placed on behalf of the
petitioners on the dissent of Mr. Vijender Kumar Gupta who was the
member of the sub-committee appointed on 21st July, 2004 by the Standing
Committee of the MCD. It has been contended that Mr. Vijender Kumar
Gupta was the member of the political party which was in opposition in the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The political party to which this member
belonged is of no importance so far as the present case is concerned.
However, it is necessary to consider some of the questions which were
raised by this member of the sub-committee and the answers given by the
MCD to the same.
121.

In this behalf, it would be useful to set down some of the

questions raised by this member and the answer given by the Corporation to
them along side. Shri Vijender Kumar Gupta upon examination of the
matter, addressed the communication dated 28th July, 2004 to the
Commissioner of the MCD which were answered by the MCD. These
answers have also been placed by the petitioner before this court in W.P.(C)
10046/2005. Some of the questions raised in the letter dated 28th July, 2004
which deserve to be noticed and the answers thereto by the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi are therefore placed below in extenso and read as

97

WP(C) No.10685/2004

follows:

“Q3.

What is the annually estimated advertisement income from all the

CTCs to be transferred to Sulabh International?
Answer - Not explored yet.

Q4.

What is the justification for 30 years agreement with Sulabh

International, as recommended under the proposal?
Answer - The earlier agreements with various NGOs along with Sulabh
International are for a period of 30 years and accordingly on the same lines
it was offered to Sulabh International for 30 years.
Q 5.

What is the area for advertisement will be made available to Sulabh

International at 1963 CTCs? What are the conditions/terms of the present
agreements with the NGOs in respect of Advertisemesnt rights as CTCs?
Answer - There is no fixed area for advertisement, which can be made
available, it is only the complexes which are coming in the commercial
areas can be exploited for advertisement purposes.

Whereas CTCs are

located all over Delhi and most of them in Harijan Basties, Balmiki Basties,
urbanized villages, unauthorized colonies, etc.
Q 6.

Why the conditions on which the CTCs are to be given to Sulabh

International were not made part of the earlier tenders?
Answer - In order to rationalize the above situation and also to avoid duality
of control in certain contracts, it was thought of to modify the certain terms
and conditions to make non-functional complexes viable and put to use for
common public.

98

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Q7. What are the reasons for inserting new conditions in the agreement for
Sulabh International ? Why these were not inserted in the earlier agreement?
Answer - The certain modifications were proposed in the terms and
conditions with Sulabh International keeping in views the economic
viability of large number of complexes, which are non-functional. Reason
why could not be inserted in the earlier agreement as explained in Para 6
above.
Q 8.

Why not open tenders on the terms and conditions agreed to with

the Sulabh International have been called?
Answer - As per the past practice Sulabh International has been
awarded works without call of tenders.
Q9. How the Corporation can rescind the contract of the present NGOs who
have not violated the terms/conditions of their agreement?
Answer - As already explained in Para 6 the contracts covered under
Yamuna Action Plan can be terminated by giving three months notice on
either side.
As regard to 30 years maintenance contract there is no direct clause to
terminate the contract, but in case of default by the NGO action can be
taken against him after giving due notice and on consistent default his
contract can be terminated.
Q 10.

When the Corporation has already deleted the name of non-

functional CTCs for which the contracts were given to the NGOs earlier,
than how these NGOs are responsible for not operating of non-functional
CTCs ?
Answer - It is wrong to say that Corporation has deleted the name of nonfunctional CTCs for which the contracts were given to the NGOs. Out of
959 Community Toilet Complxes (CTCs) constructed under Yamuna Action
Plan, 952 CTCs were put to auction and around 30-35% complexes are non99

WP(C) No.10685/2004

functional due to various reasons attributable to the NGOs.
Q 11.

The properties and income to be received from the properties of the

Slum & JJ Department cannot be clubbed with the properties and income of
General Wing. Also, the officer of the General Wing has no powers to enter
into contract on behalf of the JJ and Slums Wing.
Answer - This is more a technicality and will be looked into accordingly.
Q. 12.

The CTCs are to be operated upon by the Sulabh International on

“no profit no loss basis”. What is the operational cost to be incurred by the
Sulabh International and the estimated income from the advertisement rights
plus the pay and use charges?
Answer - No comments can be offered on this as the estimated income and
operational cost to be incurred by Sulabh International cannot be computed
at this stage.
Q 13. When the CTCs are to be handed over to the Sulabh International on
“As is where is basis” than what is the justification of making the nonfunctional CTCs into functional at the cost of the Corporation? What is the
estimated cost for making functional the CTCs covered under the conditions
of the recommended proposal?
Answer - Out of the CTCs, which are proposed to be handed over to Sulabh
International there are certain complexes, which are more than 15-20 years
old and require major repairs before they can be put to public use. However
the estimated cost of making these CTCs functional is yet to be worked out.
Q.18.

The Commissioner can only appoint mutually agreed arbitrator with

the Sulabh International.

It does not give absolute power to the

Commissioner to appoint arbitrator.

However in all the contracts

Commissioner has such powers. Why this preferential treatment in this
particular case?
100

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Answer - ‘This clause can be reviewed to safeguard the interest of the
Department.
Q.19.

What is the justification of 10% enhancement in the Pay & Use

charges per year?
Answer-

To cover up the increasing cost of operation, maintenance and

other aspects of these CTCs the provision of 10% enhancement in the user
charges was made with a view to revise the users charge with reasonability
as the contract given under this case is for a period of 30 years.
Q22.

What is the justification for keeping the JJ & Slum Department

outside the scope of the Contract ? As per the agreement the present
contract with the Sulabh International for the CTCs already maintained by
them will be ceased and covered under the new agreement. How much
comparatively financial benefit will incur to the Sulabh International under
this condition?
Answer - This is a mere technicality and will be looked into accordingly.
122.

From a perusal of the above, it appears that all works relating to

financial benefits which would occur to Sulabh were considered to be ‘mere
technicality’. There is an admission so far as dispute redressal is concerned
that the interest of the MCD required to be looked at. It is also admitted that
the MCD has qualified staff to do the renovation and rectification. The
estimated cost of making the CTCs functional had not still been worked out.
Yet, a decision is taken without even working out the financial implications
of the exercise, when even the estimated income and operational cost of the
CTCs had also not been worked out and had not been computed. The
decision to hand over the 1963 CTCs without calling of tenders to Sulabh
was based on ‘as per past practice’ and nothing more.
123.

The MCD had also not explored what would be the annual

101

WP(C) No.10685/2004

estimated advertisement income from 1963 CTCs which were to be
transferred to Sulabh.

In the same breath, it has been asserted that

modifications in terms and conditions which Sulabh were proposed keeping
in view the economic viability of a large number of complexes which are
non-functional.
The answers given to the questions are in contradiction to each
other. The CTCs which are non-functional were to be handed over to Sulabh
after effecting repairs of crores of rupees and rendering them functional.
124.

The petitioners have vehemently protested to the answers given

by the MCD. Question no. 9 raised by Vijender Kumar Gupta relates to the
jurisdiction of the corporation whereby it could rescind the contract of the
present NGOs who have not violated the terms and conditions of their
agreement. It had been submitted that the stand of the MCD was that the
contracts covered under the Yamuna Action Plan could be terminated by
giving three months notice on either side. It has further been submitted that
as regards the thirty year contract, there is no clause to terminate the
contract but action could be taken only in the case of default by the NGOs.
Therefore, in the light of what has been noticed hereinabove, it is
evident that there is no material to show any default by the NGOs who was
maintaining the CTCs under the thirty year contract. There is also an
admission in the answers given to the member of the committee that even in
respect of the CTCs under the Yamuna Action Plan, there were persons who
were not defaulters. This is evident even from the stand of the

102

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Commissioner taken on 3rd January, 2004 when he noticed that only nonfunctional CTCs be given to Sulabh. Again, from the answer given to
question no. 8 noted above, it is evident that MCD had not taken any
considered or conscious decision not to invite tenders because there was no
person who was competent to operate and maintain the CTCs other than
Sulabh International but because of MCD's‘past practice’in relation to its
dealings with Sulabh. Again from the answer to question no. 9, it is
evident that termination of the agreement was not because of the advanced
reason of the NGOs being defaulters but because the MCD has power under
the contract to do so.
125.

From the above it is evident that there is no justification even for

the 10% enhancement in the pay and use charges per year.

Without

knowing what would be the cost of operation and maintenance and other
aspects of the CTCs, an answer has been given to the member of the
Committee that this clause has been provided to cover up the increasing cost
of operation, maintenance and other aspects of the CTCs.
126.

It would be useful to also notice that in the thirty year

agreements for maintenance of the CTCs, in respect of those CTCs which
were being operated by Sulabh International, the usage charges were only
0.50 paise per use. In the new agreement, Rs.1 has been provided for as a
usage charge in some areas while Rs.2 in other areas with the increase. The
admitted position is that these CTCs have been constructed to address the
needs of the poorest of the poor in the city of Delhi. It is the respondent’s

103

WP(C) No.10685/2004

case that the allocation, operation and maintenance is based on sheer
altruism and philanthropy of Sulabh which is stated to be an organization
which does not participate in any competitive bidding processes for
allocation of CTCs for maintenance to it nor is in such occupation for any
motive of profit. If the allotment of the CTCs to Sulabh was truly only in
public interest, then where would be the questions of an incorporating such
a clause in the agreement which substantially increased the usage charge in
respect of CTCs being run without a complaint from free use (in respect of
those run by the MCD itself) or from Rs. 0.50 in those under the earlier 30
year agreements to usage charges Rs.1 or Rs. 2 with the right to enhance the
cost? Is it in public interest that a user of a community toilet complex be
required to ultimately have to pay Rs. 16/- per use in respect of a toilet in
the slum area or Rs.32/- in the non-slum area in view of the permissible
enhancement?

Where is MCD’s consideration that the users of such

facilities would have the means or the ability to use these community toilets
if the charges were raised to these exorbitant limits? What is the element of
public interest in such charges?
127.

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has filed an affidavit of Mr.

S.K. Mahajan of the Officer on Special Duty (Yamuna Action Plan) which
is dated 12th August, 2005 (at page 948 in W.P.(C) No. 10685/2004). It is
admitted therein that the letter dated 28th July, 2004 was received from Mr.
Vijender Kumar Gupta and that the aforenoticed answers thereto were sent
only to the member and that they were not placed before the sub-committee

104

WP(C) No.10685/2004

of the standing committee even though the said Mr. Gupta had specifically
asked for the same.
In this behalf, the MCD has stated thus :“2.
That I have been able to locate the file No.
CE(S)/4100(309)CRY/Vol.IV/OSD/2004
of
the
Department. As per the record a letter dated 9.8.04 was
received in the Slum & J.J. Department from the
Commissioner MCD, forwarding the letter No.
VK/04/42/1729 dated 28.7.04 of Sh. Vijender Kumar
Gupta, Municipal Councilor vide which certain queries
had been raised by Sh. Vijender Kumar Gupta who was
also the Member Standing Committee with regard to the
Community Toilet Complex. A copy of the said letter
dated 9.8.04 received from the Commissioner alongwith
a copy of the letter dated 28.7.04 of Sh. Vijender Kumar
Gupta is collectively annexed as Annexure A1 hereto.
3.
I state that the queries by Sh. Vijender Kumar
Gupta were duly examined by the Department and
appropriate reply was duly sent to him vide covering
letter dated 13.9.04 by the then Addl. Commissioner
(S&JJ). Copy of the said reply alongwith covering letter
is collectively annexed as Annexure AII hereto.”
Can it be said that the issues raised in the aforenoticed queries
were not relevant in taking a decision? The answer clearly has to be in the
affirmative i.e. they were relevant factors which deserves to be considered.
128.

The Sub-Committee was formed after these issued raised by the

petitioners were before this court and interim orders of stay had been
passed. The sub-committee has attempted to give some details of dues of
licence fees of the different NGOs. Interestingly, only the 15 NGOs who
had come to the court have been considered while other NGOs have not
been dealt with or considered at all.
129.

This report of the Sub-Committee, were accepted by the

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Resolution No. 229 of Standing Committee on the 22nd September, 2004.
So far as the decision to award the CTCs to Sulabh as contained
in the resolution of 22nd September, 2004 is concerned, it is noteworthy that
only such NGOs who were in court are set out in this resolution.
130.

The recommendation of the Standing Committee by its resolution

no. 229 was placed before the Corporation as item no. 25 in its meeting held
on 25th October, 2004. By a resolution no. 400 passed on 25th October,
2004, the Corporation resolved that the proposal of the Commissioner
contained as contained in his letter dated 19th July, 2004 be approved.
131.

It

is

also

noteworthy

that

a

draft

memorandum

of

understanding('MOU') was prepared and enclosed with the letter of the
Commissioner dated 19th July, 2004. This MOU was also approved and
finalised in this meeting without consideration of any of the financial and
revenue implications and finalised in this meeting.

The other liability of

Sulabh was with regard to payment of advertisement tax to the MCD.
Though there is no computation placed before the court, however the
revenue which Sulabh was to generate from the advertisement can be
envisaged from the stipulation which was made by the MCD in the meeting
on 26th June, 2004 which was to the following effect :“10% service tax will be levied on the
advertisement tax to be received from Sulabh
International, will be kept in a separate account subject to
a ceiling Rs.1 crore to meet out any unforeseen
expenditure/default by Sulabh International”
All these terms and conditions were incorporated in the

106

WP(C) No.10685/2004

memorandum of understanding. Thus on the premise that Rs. 1 crore was
also not even 10% of the total, it would appear that the revenue which the
MCD expected Sulabh to generate and earn from the advertising ran into
several crores.
132.

The petitioners have pointed out that on the terms and conditions

on which the CTCs were allotted to the petitioner there were substantial
revenue drawings by the MCD from the operation and maintenance of the
CTCs and the NGOs. As per the terms and conditions of the auction, the
NGOs were required to: (i) deposit security of Rs.50,000/- at the time of
participation in the auction; (ii) deposit 10% of the licence fee for the first
quarter of the year;

(iii) The NGOs were also required to meet the

expenditure of electricity, water and the cleaning of the septic tank. Under
the terms and conditions of the auction, repairs were also the responsibility
of the NGOs. MCD itself recognized that usage charges alone would not be
sufficient to make the scheme viable. However clause 10 of the terms and
conditions of auction prohibited the NGOs from undertaking any
advertisement or any revenue generating expenses.
133.

As against this, so far as Sulabh was concerned, a decision was

taken to allot all the CTCs to it without it part taking in any competitive
bidding. Sulabh was not required to furnish any security nor was it required
to pay any licence fee. On the contrary, in clear admission and acceptance
of the fact that the CTCs were structurally and technically defective and
required extensive repairs, the memorandum of understanding proposed

107

WP(C) No.10685/2004

with Sulabh contained the following recital:

134.

“Where as the MCD is the absolute owner of 959
Community Toilet Complexes (741 CTCs by
General Wing and 218 CTCs by Slum & JJ Wing,
MCD) constructed under Yamuna Action Plan
(Extended Phase). 611 Toilet Complexes of CSE
Department and 393 CTCs of Slum & JJ
Wing(including 141 prefab) which is being given to
Second party by the First party for operation,
maintenance and management on lease basis for a
period of 30 years.”
Relevant clauses in the terms and conditions at which the CTCs

were to be given to Sulabh require to be considered in extenso and read as
hereunder :

135.

“1)
That the CTCs have been constructed by
and on behalf of MCD at its own cost and as such
MCD is the Absolute Owner of these CTCs. That the
little of interest, ownership and rights with regard to
CTCs shall rest with the First party except that these
will be operated and maintained by the Second party
as agreed to in this Agreement.
(i)
Before taking over CTCs, each CTC
would be inspected by a joint team consisting of
MCD Officials' and the representatives of Sulabh
International Social Service Organisation to assess
and record the condition of each CTC and
(ii)
estimate the expenditure required for
renovation/rectification
and
removing
major
defects/structural defects and providing of missing
articles including water pumps, electric motors,
metres and electric generators etc. will be borne by
First Party. However the above work will be done by
Second Party so that quality work is done and the
second party does the work to its own satisfaction
after the receipt of estimated cost involved from
MCD.
(iii)
Thereafter Sulabh International Social
Service Organisation will not claim any expenditure
for operation and maintenance of these CTCs.
However, this clause will not be applicable in respect
of CTCs already being maintained by Second Party.”
Against the two year allocation to the other NGOs, the MCD
108

WP(C) No.10685/2004

agreed to hand over the CTCs to Sulabh for a period of thirty years.

Not

only was Sulabh not required to furnish any security or licence fee, but
under clause 7 of the memorandum of understanding, Sulabh had the
following rights :
“Advertisement rights on all these CTCs will be given to
the Second Party and the advertisement tax will be given
by the Second Party. In addition a sinking fund equal to
10% of the advertisement tax up to a maximum of
Rs.100 lacs would be deposited with MCD to pay any
electricity and water charges, in case the same are
required to be met from outstanding amount. This
amount shall be no way over and above Rs. 100 lacs, if
any balance is remaining at the end of the contract
period, the same shall be returned without interest to the
Second Party.”
No reason or justification for grant of these advertisement rights
has been given by the respondents. No material or reason for the same is to
be found anywhere on the record of the MCD.

As to why the terms

suggested as Model Agreement barely two years prior, required to be
departed from has not been even touched upon by the MCD. The amount
which would be earned from such rights is left to imagination by the MCD.
136.

Against the liability of the NGOs to bear the charges of

electricity and water connections, the MCD undertook the responsibility of
providing permanent electricity connection as well as to arrange the
borewells so far as Sulabh was concerned:“8)(a)
While
the
expenses
of
monthly
consumption charges for electricity and water shall be
borne by the Second Party, the First Party shall assist
Second Party in getting connections from concerned
departments where these are not available as the CTCs
are in the name of the First Party. Past liabilities in
respect of water, electricity or any other item shall be
109

WP(C) No.10685/2004

137.

exclusive liability of the First Party and the Second
Party shall not be liable on any account.
(b)
MCD will arrange permission of the
appropriate authority for deep borewells wherever
required. However, the expenses for the same will be
borne by the Second Party.”
So far as the NGOs were concerned, they were permitted to take

only fixed charges only from the users. On the other hand, Sulabh was
permitted to charges Rs.1 for use of the toilets in the slum areas and Rs.2
from toilet users in other areas with a right to increase the charges by 10%
every year. Sulabh was also given the right to charge for “other purposes”.
It has been pointed out that by the time the 30 year period is
over, if the clause permitting enhancement of usage charges is implemented,
so far as toilets in slum areas are concerned, Sulabh will be able to charge
Rs.16 per use while for usage of he CTCs in non-slum areas, it will be
charging Rs.32 for each toilet usage. The MCD has not even bothered to
effect any assessment or calculation of the revenue which would be
generated from such charges in respect of the CTCs in the slum and nonslum areas over the years. There is no quantification or calculation of even
the numbers of the CTCs which are respectively located in the slum and the
non-slum areas. No such information is forthcoming in any of the records
placed before this court not has been filed on any of the replies or affidavit
even. There is force in the submission on behalf of the petitioners that the
MCD has not considered any of these material factors before taking a
decision which is stated to be in public interest.
138.

As against the terms and conditions of allotment to the NGOs

110

WP(C) No.10685/2004

which underwent the scrutiny by a committee which considered all the pros
and cons of the various modes of allotment prior to recommending the
'model agreement', no such exercise was undertaken in finalizing the
memorandum of understanding with Sulabh. No enquiry was undertaken
nor estimation arrived at of the costs of suggesting and implementing of the
proposed repair. There was no assessment of the loss of revenue which
would occur on account of deprivation of the security amount as well as the
licence fees. No estimation or assessment undertaken with regard to the
revenue which could be earned from permitting advertisement on the CTCs.
Certainly the decision to change the terms and conditions for
allotment to Sulabh is not a considered decision based on any relevant
material.
139.

The petitioners have also pointed out that the MCD itself drew a

distinction between day to day repairs and annual repairs in clause 15 of the
terms and conditions wherein it was so stated :
“It is noteworthy that the nature of repairs pointed out relates to
toilets being without doors, lack of tubewells and lack of boring, septic tank
were also in certain places not connected to the toilets.”
140.

MCD has also strongly relied on its submission that under the

previous modes of allocation and agreements, the responsibility towards the
maintaining and operating the CTCs was dual and divided between the
MCD and the operating and maintaining agency. Even though there was
contracting out of the operation and maintenance work, yet some part of the

111

WP(C) No.10685/2004

responsibility continued to have been retained by the MCD such as cleaning
of septic tank and the responsibility to supply electricity and water. It has
been submitted that even the report of the Vishnu Sharma Committee
constituted in September, 1999 identified this division of responsibilities as
a key shortcoming in the existing agreements. It is submitted that this
Committee gave suggestions regarding the model contract which was
proposed to be entered into by the MCD in the future. MCD has clarified
that dual responsibility is not what has been construed by the petitioners as
that constituting construction being undertaken by one agency, while the
operating and maintaining agency being another.
141.

Even accepting the submission of the MCD, it is noteworthy that

the MCD accepts that the model agreements proposed by the Vishnu
Sharma Committee were so proposed after deliberations and consideration
of the entire historical experience. Against this, the proposed MOU with
Sulabh has been carved out on the basis of the demands made by the NGO
alone without any assessment of the respective cost benefit analysis or the
recommendations, based whereon the model agreement had been earlier
suggested by the Vishnu Sharma Committee. There is not a whisper of an
explanation for giving up its recommendations and putting up the draft
agreement alongwith the Commissioner's letter of 19th July, 2004.
Contentions raised on behalf of MCD
142.

Defending the action of the MCD, Mr.Valmiki Mehta, learned

senior counsel, has vehemently urged that the petitioners were all defaulters

112

WP(C) No.10685/2004

and had committed breaches of the terms and conditions of the licence.
Adverting to the specific stipulations in the licence it has been contended
that the assertions of the petitioners to the effect that the maintenance and
repairs was to be effected by the MCD or that it committed any default of its
responsibility are wholly incorrect. The MCD placed reliance on clause 15,
15.1, 16.1, 16.2 and 14.8 of the terms and conditions of the three years
licence given to the petitioners to operate the CTCs. It is contended that the
petitioners miserably failed to pay the licence fee and as such were gross
defaulters.

The MCD had, therefore, decided to terminate the same.

Reliance was placed on Section 62 & 63 of the Contract Act in this behalf.
Based on these statutory provisions it is also contended by learned senior
counsel that the rights of the parties are governed by specific written
contract and cannot be altered.
143.

It has also been vehemently contended that the NGOs who were

alloted the CTCs failed to point out any specific defects in the CTCs and
that while some of the NGOs did point out general defects however no
specific grievance was made by any NGO. It is in this behalf it has become
necessary to notice the detailed submissions which were made in the joint
meetings which were conducted under the chairmanship of the Additional
Commissioner of the Slum & JJ Wing wherein specific deficiencies were
pointed out. The concerned executive engineers and the field monitors
appointed by the MCD were required to look at the individual toilet
complexes. These engineers expressed difficulties with regard to the refusal

113

WP(C) No.10685/2004

of the contractors to remove the deficiencies.
144.

The other submission is that the contract was entered into by the

petitioners with open eyes. The MCD could not be held bound to ensure
profits to the contractors. In the event of dis-satisfaction with any situation
it was open to the contractor to terminate the agreement and it cannot be
permitted to contend that MCD was at fault yet they want to continue and
still not to pay the contracted licence fees. In this behalf reliance was
placed on AIR 1956 SC 593(para 21) Nagubai Ammal and others vs.
B.Sharma Rao and others;

AIR 1968 SC 596(Para 4) Ningawwa vs.

Byrappa Shiddappa Hirenkrabar and others; (1981)1 SCC 537 (at page 540)
entitled M/s New Bihar Bidi Leaves Co. and others vs. State of Bihar and
others and 1994(4) SCC 104(paras 21 to 25 at page 108) Assistant Excise
Commissioner and others vs. Issac Peter and others.
145.

Mr. Mehta further submitted that where a contract, as in the

instant case, is not specifically enforceable no injunction can be granted.
(Re: AIR 2000 Delhi 450 Rajasthan Breweries Limited vs. Stroh Brewery
Company; 1994(4) SCC 104(paras 21 to 25 at page 108) Assistant Excise
Commissioner and others vs. Issac Peter and others.)
Having accepted the terms of the contract, it is submitted that
there can be no unilateral novation of a contract of the petitioners. 2004(1)
SCC 12( at page 16) entitled City Bank N.A vs. Standard Chartered Bank
and others; 1976(2) SCC 416; (2001)7 SCC 549 Pallav Sheth vs. Custodian
and others.

114

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Learned senior counsel for the MCD has contended that the
petitioners had never objected to or pointed out any discrepancy in the
CTCs.

In this behalf it was argued that the petitioner in the W.P.(C)

No.12378/2004

being

the

Centre

for

Environmental

and

Social

Development v. Commissioner of MCD & Ors. did not point out any civil
or other deficiencies and did not pay any licence fee whatsoever. Reference
was made to the letter dated 6th August, 2002 written by this petitioner to
MCD.

It is alleged that the petitioner did not point out any civil or

electrical deficiencies and a huge amount was due on account of licence fee.
Similarly in WP(C) 14690/2004 Balmiki Development Society
of India v. Commissioner, MCD & Anr., it is contended that none of the
reasons for closure of the CTC were attributable to the MCD and that 100%
of the licence fee was due and payable.
In

WP(C)

17123/2004

the

petitioner,

Delhi

Sanitation

Improvement Society, it is pointed out by learned senior counsel that out of
the 20 CTCs allotted, 13 of the CTCs are functional and yet 100% of the
licence fee is due and payable.
146.

Defending the decision taken by the MCD to allot all the CTCs

to Sulabh, Mr. Valmiki Mehta learned senior counsel appearing for the
MCD also placed reliance on the Sections 44, 45 and 65 of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act. It is contended that the Standing Committee of
the MCD is a statutory body and that it was empowered to appoint a Sub
Committee in exercise of powers under Section 65 of the DMC Act.

115

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Troubled by the failure of the petitioners who were allotted the CTCs and
faced with the responsibility to the Asian Development Bank which had
advanced funds for construction of the CTCs, bearing in mind the
imperative duty to ensure that open defaecation is brought to an end so that
the River Yamuna is saved from further pollution, the MCD was
constrained to explore an alternative for effective management and
operation of the CTCs. It was thus contended that a Sub Committee was
appointed which took extreme pains to collect material and examine the
issue in detail. It examined the difficulties being faced by the MCD in the
four types of contracts on which the operation and maintenance of CTCs
had been given to different bodies. The problems being faced from duality
of responsibility in operating and maintaining these CTCs in terms of
repairs, maintenance etc. were

examined in great detail by the sub

committee which made several recommendations. The proposal received
from the Commissioner

of the MCD was also

examined

and

recommendations were made to the Standing Committee of the MCD. It has
further been pointed out that the MCD had adopted an identical procedure
prior to award of the contracts for operation of the CTCs when they were
allotted to the petitioners.

On that occasion, the Vishnu Sharma Sub-

Committee had made a recommendation whose recommendations were
adopted and the same procedure has been followed in taking the decision
which has been impugned before this Court.
147.

Learned senior counsel appearing for the MCD was at pains to

116

WP(C) No.10685/2004

point out that the decision taken by the MCD was an administrative decision
and a policy matter and that the limits of judicial review into such a decision
were circumscribed within narrow limits. It has been pointed out that the
actual decision was not open to judicial review and this Court would
examine only the decision making process. The same required this Court to
satisfy its judicial conscience that the decision of the MCD was not arbitrary
and that some material existed on the record to justify such decision on its
part. It is contended that the quantum of the material or its merit was not
open to judicial scrutiny. It is further contended that the MCD was bound to
debar the defendants from the tendering process in the facts and
circumstances of the instant case. The MCD was justified in taking a
decision not to make commercial profits from its duty of sewage and
salvage collection and provision of toilet facilities. In this behalf reliance
was placed on the pronouncement of the Apex Court in 1995(Supp) 2 SCC
512(para 34) GD Zalani and another Vs. Union of India and others; (1980)
4 SCC 1 M/s Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy and others vs. State of Jammu and
Kashmir and another (para 14, 21 to 24) ; (2003) 8 SCC 100(102) (para 15
and 16 at page 115) 5 M & T Consultants, Secunderabad vs. S.Y.Nawab and
another.
Contentions raised on behalf of Sulabh
148.

Mr. P.N. Lekhi, learned senior counsel, appearing for Sulabh has

urged that the pleadings of the petitioners and the annexures enclosed
clearly show that the petitioners have attempted to make out a case of

117

WP(C) No.10685/2004

contractual violations and that it is not for this Court in exercise of its
extraordinary jurisdiction to go into the finer points of deficiencies and
compliance of contractual matters. The judicial pronouncements in (1989) 2
SCC 116 Bareilly Development Authority and another vs. Ajay Pal Singh
and others and 7 Moore's Indian Appeal 7 Ishaan Chander Singh vs. Sham
Charan were relied upon in this behalf.
149.

Adverting to the facts in the instant case it has been pointed out

that the allocation of the CTCs was based on tenders. The petitioners were
successful in their bidding and were awarded the CTCs after entering into
contracts.

The entire writ petition is stated to be based on alleged

deficiencies in the CTCs. It is further pointed out that the petitioners are
avoiding to pay the contractual licence fee on the allegation that the MCD
had failed to abide by its contractual commitments. Therefore, it is urged
that there is no element of public law and the matter is purely in the realm of
private law. My attention has been drawn also to the provisions of Section
201 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act which provides the manner in
which contracts shall be entered into by the MCD.
150.

According to Mr. P.N. Lekhi, learned senior counsel for Sulabh,

the petitioners have failed to make out any case against Sulabh.

It is

contended that the allegations against this organisation are totally malafide
and baseless and deserve to be ignored for the purposes of adjudication of
the present writ petition. It has been argued at length that Sulabh was not
interested in award of the work and that it was in a class of its own. Placing

118

WP(C) No.10685/2004

reliance on its years of experience and standing in the area of provision of
common toilet facilities, it is contended that there is no other organisation
which is as experienced or possessed of the expertise as has been attained
by Sulabh. It has also been urged that this organisation has developed its
own engineering and that, as a matter of its policy and principle, Sulabh
does not participate in any competitive bidding. It has further been urged
that it is contesting the present writ petitions only for the reason that the
petitioners have made wild and baseless allegations against this organisation
and it is interested only in protecting its name.
151.

Mr. P.N. Lekhi, learned senior counsel further contended that

Section 42 of the DMC Act, 1947 sets out the obligatory functions of the
MCD and that the provision of public latrines, urinals and similar
conveniences is one of the obligatory functions of the MCD. It is, therefore,
a statutory duty and any arrangement made for discharge of such obligatory
function and statutory duty cannot be faulted on the grounds urged by the
petitioners. Learned senior counsel placed reliance on the definition of “
largesse”as given in the Oxford English Dictionary to read that the same
means “liberality, bountifullness, munifesence.”
It was urged at great length that therefore the decision impugned
before this Court to award the operation and maintenance of the CTCs to
Sulabh is not dispensation of “ largesse” by the MCD or even in the realm
of award of a contract by the MCD but is a policy decision taken by a
statutory authority which is in the nature of a local self-governance. Placing

119

WP(C) No.10685/2004

reliance on Pearlman vs. Keepers and Governors of Harrow School at
1979(1) All ER 365 (at page 372), it was urged that no court or tribunal has
any jurisdiction to make any error of law on which the case decision
depends and that a writ of certiorari would lie to correct such error if made.
Mr. Lekhi, learned senior counsel also placed reliance on
1974(II) All ER 156 Asher and Ors. v. Secretary of State for the
Reinforcement & Anr. to urge that the Court should not interfere in
decisions taken by authorities without good reason. Further placing reliance
on the definition of 'policy' as given in the US Supreme Court report 115
Lawyers Edition 2nd Edition 410(at page 438), it was urged that the Court
could not even examine the issue as to whether an authority had deviated
from its own policy. Further elaborating this submission it was contended
that the decision of the MCD had been taken in the paramount interest of
the public at large and, therefore, it was in the larger interest of the country.
In this behalf reliance was placed on the pronouncement in Usha Mehta and
others vs. State of Maharashtra (2004) 6 SCC 264 ( at page 273 and 279).
It is, therefore, settled law that the Courts could interfere even in
a matter relating to policy or a policy decision if the same has been taken
malafide or has been taken arbitrarily or is discriminatory.
152.

According to the learned senior counsel a policy decision can

only be challenged on grounds of procedural impropriety, illegality or
proportionality. It has been pointed out that all the petitions are similar in
pleadings and that there are no statements of facts in the writ petitions as to

120

WP(C) No.10685/2004

how the Wednesbury principles have been violated. It is contended that
none of the conditions laid down in (2003) 4 SCC 579 entitled Indian
Railway Construction Co. Ltd. vs. Ajay Kumar have been satisfied in the
instant case.
In this behalf reliance was also placed on 2005(2) All ER 192
(paras 28 & 29) Hall v. Wandsworth London Borough Council; 2005(1) All
ER 53 (para 59) National Car Parks Limited vs Baird (Valuation Officer)
and another; and 2004 (4) All ER 162 Mabkshad v. Howard De Walden
Estates.
153.

Objecting to the maintainability of the instant writ petitions,

impugning the decision of the MCD, placing reliance on (1997) 7 SCC 592
M.P. Oil Extraction v. State of M.P., AIR 2002 SC 350 Balco Employees
Union Vs. Union of India and others, AIR 1974 Delhi 119 Sudershan
Kumar v. UOI (128 para 28) and AIR 1966 Cal. 601 (603 para 8) , it was
urged that the executive authority of the State has to be held to be within its
competence to frame a policy for the administration of the State unless the
policy framed is absolutely capricious and not being informed by any reason
whatsoever, it can be clearly held to be arbitrary and founded on the mere
ipsi dixit of the executive functionaries thereby violating Article 14 of the
Constitution or if such policy offends other constitutional provisions or
comes into conflict with any statutory provision.

Mr. Lekhi submits that

this was not so in the present case.
154.

It has been pointed out that Section 42(6) of the Delhi Municipal

121

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Corporation Act, 1957 requires the MCD to perform scavenging functions.
On the other hand Section 43 sets out the discretionary functions of the
MCD.
Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the Apex Court in
(2004) 2 SCC 150 Union of India Vs. S.B.Vohra, Mr. Lekhi learned senior
counsel has contended that the Apex Court has recognised the distinction
between discretionary power and obligatory duties and that, exercise of
discretion in matters relating to policy, will depend upon the law which
governs the field that is to say as to whether it is fundamental or ordinary
law which is to be considered and that, at the first instance, the Courts
would allow the statutory authorities to freely perform their functions.
155.

It was contended that the MCD is an elected body elected by the

representatives of the people.

Article 243(R) of the Constitution was

referred to and it was urged with all the vehemence at the command of
learned senior counsel that interference by this Court in a policy decision of
the MCD amounts to interference in the constitutional scheme.
It is contended that decisions are taken by majority of votes cast
by members the MCD. In the instant case there can be no interference with
a decision arrived at in a democratic manner in accordance with law by an
elected body.
156.

Mr. P.N. Lekhi, learned senior counsel has further urged that in

view of the pronouncement of the Apex Court reported at 2004(5) SCC 409
Ramesh Mehta Vs. Sanwal Chand Singhvi and others democracy at the

122

WP(C) No.10685/2004

grass root level was sought to be introduced by the 74th Constitutional
Amendment in terms of Article 243 R which was inserted to include the
municipalities in the constitutional scheme. It has been contended that once
the grass root democracy has been accepted, a pragmatic and purposive
meaning to the provisions of the municipal enactment has to be given.
157.

It is further submitted that the freedom of the action of the local

authority cannot be curtailed and this principle was further recognised by
the Court in AIR 1992 Allahbad 62 Anugrah Narain Singh Vs. State of UP ;
2000(8) SCC 655 Lorry Owners Association vs. State of Bihar and 2003(2)
All ER 497 Sheldrake vs. Director of Public Prosecution.
158.

It was urged that under Section 487-488 of the DMC Act, 1957,

only the Central Government has the power of superintendence over the
wrong actions of the MCD. In this behalf reliance was placed on the
pronouncement of the Apex Court in AIR 1968 SC 1232 entitled MCD vs.
Birla Cotton and Spinning Mills.
159.

The principal argument urged on behalf of Sulabh however was

to the effect that none of the writ petitions contained any pleading
establishing any of the ingredients necessary for laying a legally tenable
challenge to the decision of the MCD. It was urged that there was no
pleading or submission making out a case of bias or animus in the MCD or
its Commissioner in taking the decision. Placing reliance on 2004(8) SCC
788 (para 14) MP Special Police Establishment vs. State of MP, it is urged
that there were no grounds whatsoever for holding that there is likelihood or

123

WP(C) No.10685/2004

apparent bias or that the decision maker had any interest in the out come of
the decision taken.
It has been contended that there is nothing in the pleadings of
any of the petitioners making out any illegality, statutory or constitutional;
procedural irregularity or dis-proportionality to support a case of a taint
being attached to the MCD.
160.

It has been vehemently urged that the petitioners have placed no

pleadings whatsoever on record to show as to how the public law remedy is
available to them. Placing reliance on (1988) 4 SCC 544 Bharat Singh v.
State of Haryana, it is submitted that the petitioners have not laid any
pleadings to bring out a case on violations of Article 14.
161.

Before this court, learned counsel appearing for MCD and

Sulabh have argued at great length that no fault can be found and the
decision to allot the CTCs to Sulabh cannot be challenged for the reason
that the decision-making process involved consideration of the entire
relevant material; that the process was identical to the process involved in
taking the decision to hand over the CTCs to the NGOs including the
petitioner; and that the Committee appointed by the MCD as also the Full
House of the MCD consisting of the elected representative examined the
issues thread bare. Substantial case law on these issues has been cited.
162.

Answering the allegations of mala fide, learned senior counsel

cited the pronouncement of the Apex Court in Dharam Dutt vs. Union of
India AIR 2004 SC 1294 (para 16) to urge that motive is irrelevant. The

124

WP(C) No.10685/2004

observations of the Apex Court in AIR 1953 SC 375(para 9) entitled
K.C.Gajapati Narayan Deo and others vs. State of Orissa are also to the
same effect.

It is urged that the action of the MCD in awarding the

operation and maintenance of the CTCs to Sulabh is not malafide and no
motive can be attributed to it.
163.

It has been contended that the decision taken to award the work

of operation and maintenance of toilets to the Sulabh is with the consent of
Union of India and has been taken under the supervision and control of the
Central Government in accordance with the provisions of Section 485 &
490 of the DMC Act. The decision cannot be impugned merely because
MCD opted to get rid of the responsibility and that there is no malafide,
irrationality or bias in the decision. The choice has been made by the MCD
based on past performance and reputation which was after consideration of
all relevant inputs and no direction can be given to change the decision.
The principles laid down in the Wednesbury Corporation case are not
attracted inasmuch as the decision under challenge is taken after detailed
consideration by the sub-committee and all competent authorities and a
decision of the Full House of the Delhi Municipal Corporation.
164.

Appearing for Sulabh-respondent no.4 in WP(C) 11865/2004

Himalayan Institute of Pollution Control & Social Economic Development
vs. Commissioner, MCD & Ors. Dr.A.M.Singhvi, learned senior counsel
additionally urged that the conduct of the petitioners does not entitle them to
exercise of any discretion in their favour. According to learned senior

125

WP(C) No.10685/2004

counsel, the petitioners participated in an open bid after inspection of the
sites. Such a condition was incorporated in the advertisements dated 22nd
November, 2001 and 22nd March 2002 issued by the MCD inviting
applications. The petitioner in this writ petition quoted a price of Rs.16/per WC per month against a reserve price of Rs.20/- per month. Such a bid
was artificially exaggerated and, on the face of it, was not commercially
viable. The petitioners submitted an unconditional bid without any caveat
or reservation and having got allotment of the CTCs , the petitioners opted
to selectively run only those toilets which were profit making and not to run
those which were not profitable.
The petitioners reserved the CTCs by such exaggerated bids and
thereby excluded other deserving parties. It is pointed out that the MCD,
vide letter dated 22nd March, 2002, required the applicant to visit the CTCs.
The petitioners in the writ petition have stated that they have opted to
inspect the CTCs only after their allocation.
Learned senior counsel submits that the petitioners had an option
to elect to run the CTCs shortly after the bid. The petitioners have no right
whatsoever to elect not to operate the bad toilets and to operate only the
good toilets.
On these facts Dr. Singhvi has submitted that the MCD invited
tenders to which the petitioners responded. The tenders were accepted and
CTCs allotted to the petitioner. Such an exercise miserably failed and that,
the award to respondent no.4 is a remedial measure in public interest and as

126

WP(C) No.10685/2004

such the argument of the petitioners of arbitrariness in the action of the
MCD rendering it violative of Article 14 is not available to them. It is
contended that the present matter not being a case of threshold tendering,
cannot be challenged on grounds of violation of Article 14.
However justifying the choice of allotting the CTCs to Sulabh, it
is contended that the MCD having tried the other NGOs, had miserably
failed in their attempt to operate and maintain the CTCs; that Sulabh as a
policy does not participate in bidding and all other awards in its favour by
the MCD were not by tender.
165.

Justifying the award of the contract for the period of thirty years,

Dr. A.M. Singhvi learned senior counsel contended that by virtue of the
terms on which the CTCs were decided to be awarded to Sulabh, the MCD
stood absolved of all repairs, maintenance, staff expenses etc. Sulabh alone
was to ensure functional toilets. MCD was placed in a situation where it
was unable to provide civic amenities and as such, the decision to award the
toilets to it could not be impugned on any legally justifiable grounds.
It has further been pointed out that under the scheme of allotment
to the other NGOs, MCD was required to incur expenses of running into
huge amounts of maintenance every three years; provide for loss of fixtures
by theft or damage and it is submitted that the sub-committee appointed by
the MCD had examined this matter in great detail. It was pointed out that
all aspects of building maintenance, boosters, tubewells, gardening,
rectification etc. were to be done by Sulabh.

127

WP(C) No.10685/2004

As to why Sulabh had to be singled out, the justification placed
before this court is that this organisation had impeccable credentials and
there was no history of any dispute in the 30 years contracts which MCD
had entered into with Sulabh which was never black listed and all
operational costs were to devolve on Sulabh.
Urging that Sulabh is an All India Level Organisation which has
provided and is providing exemplary services in the arena of toilet facilities
to the common man all over the country.

Dr. Singhvi, learned senior

counsel has submitted that its choice to operate and maintain the CTCs is
the best and only option available to the MCD. Answering allegations of
black listing and court proceedings in different High Courts against it, it
was urged that an incorrect facts situation was placed before this Court and
that the allegations against Sulabh were unjustified.
166.

According to Dr.Singhvi, the decision to award the operation and

maintenance of CTCs to Sulabh is a transparent and reasoned decision
arrived at after application of mind to all relevant considerations. Irrelevant
considerations were eschewed and there was no unreasonableness or
perversity in such decision and, therefore, the principles on which the
decision making process is to be tested as laid down by the Apex Court in
1994 (6) SCC 651 entitled Tata Cellular vs. Union of India were not
violated.
167.

It was further contended that by the resolution no.400, the

motion to award the CTCs to Sulabh was carried by the Full House of the

128

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Corporation. There was no malafide in the collective decision. In answer to
the argument that Sulabh had been given a favourable treatment by grant of
the advertisement rights, it is contended that the contract was for 30 years
and all operational and maintenance costs were to be incurred by Sulabh as
such the grant of advertisement rights was not unfair.
168.

According to Dr. Singhvi learned senior counsel, Sulabh has no

sister concerns whatsoever; that Sulabh does not control any other NGO and
has no responsibility for any of their actions.

Merely because some

organisations have adopted names similar to its name cannot by any means
create any nexus or connection between them.
169.

The principal submission was to the effect that the norm of a

tender in a given situation can be departed from in public interest; to get rid
of vested interests or to provide for inaccessible areas in public functions.
Learned senior counsel has contended that in the instant case it cannot be
disputed that the MCD had an unmitigated need for the best services.
Repeated failure in the past in its object to provide public amenities,
necessitated a departure from the norm of inviting open tenders and the
MCD cannot be faulted for having taken a considered decision in this
behalf. Reliance was placed on the pronouncements of the Apex Court in
(1980) 4 SCC M/s Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy Vs. State of Jammu &
Kashmir and another; (1987)2 SCC 295 Sachidanand Pandey vs. State of
West Bengal and others; 2000(8) SCC 262 Netai Bagh and others vs. State
of West Bengal and others; (1997) 7 SCC 592 M.P.Oil Extraction and

129

WP(C) No.10685/2004

another vs. State of M.P and others and 1995(supp. 2) SCC 512 G.D.Zalani
and another vs. Union of India and others; and 1994(3) SCC 552 State of
Gujarat and others vs. Meghji Pethraj Shah Charitable Trust and others in
support of these submissions.
170.

On the other hand, on behalf of the respondents, placing reliance

on (1985) 1 SCC 523 (para 36) K. Nagraj v. State of Andhra Pradesh &
Ors.; (2001) 2 SCC 330 State of Punjab v. V.K. Khanna; (2003) 4 SCC 579
Indian Railway Construction Company v. Ajay Kumar, it is urged that the
burden of proof in matters of malafide is very high and that in the light of
the vague assertions of the petitioners in the various writ petitions, the
grounds for urging malafide had not been made out.
171.

I have heard learned senior counsels on both sides at great length

and have been carefully taken through the record and judicial
pronouncements covering the different issues raised.
172.

Article 14 of the Constitution of India imposes upon the State,

the duty to act fairly, justly and reasonably.

Before this court lengthy

arguments have been addressed on the objection that the petitioner are
urging breach of contractual duties by the MCD while the MCD is alleging
contractual violations by the petitioners. The respondents have challenged
the maintainability of the writ petition urging that the petitioners have an
alternate efficacious remedy available that the questions raised being in the
nature of a policy decision and in the realm of contract, are wholly beyond
the scope of consideration in writ proceedings. These issues overlap and

130

WP(C) No.10685/2004

deserve to be considered together.

It is necessary to consider these

objections first.
Maintainability of writ petition on issues of contract, policy decision
and availability of alternative remedy.
173.

An objection was taken on behalf of the respondents that the

relationship between the parties and the contract between the parties was in
the private law field and that there was no scope for applying the doctrine of
arbitrariness or mala fides. It is submitted that the decision to allot to
Sulabh is a policy decision of the MCD and hence beyond the scope of
judicial review by way of a writ petition. It was urged that the validity of
the respondent's action had to be tested on the basis of 'right' and not
'power'. The plea of arbitrariness/mala fides as being so gross cannot shift a
matter falling in the private law field to the public law field. On behalf of
the respondents, it was contended that permitting the same would result in
an anomalous situation that whenever the state is involved, it would always
be the public law field and that all redress against the state would fall in writ
jurisdiction and not in suits before the civil courts.
Inasmuch as, before this court as well, the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi has so contended, it is necessary to consider in extenso
the principles laid down by the Apex Court which directly rule the matter in
issue.
174.

It has been urged at great length by the respondents that the

matters being raised by the petitioners arise out of contract and that they

131

WP(C) No.10685/2004

have more efficacious alternative remedies available which should be
exhausted. The parameters within which the court will interfere in a writ
petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in matters relating to
contractual obligations of the state or its instrumentality or in matters
relating to policy of the state or a statutory authority are well settled. In a
plethora of judicial pronouncements, the Apex Court has laid down the
parameters within which the High Courts shall entertain writ petitions
raising such challenges and also the nature of the review by the court when
administrative action is challenged under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India.

So far as the permissible limits within which

the courts shall

entertain writ petitions wherein such challenges have been laid are
concerned, it would be useful to notice the principles laid down by the Apex
Court in some of the celebrated pronouncements. Such judgments which
have a bearing on the issues raised in the present case and have been
referred to by both sides.

Such binding judicial precedents are being

noticed hereafter and the principles laid down reproduced in extenso.
175.

Such a contention was rejected by the Apex Court in A.V.

Venkateswaran v. Ramchand Sobhraj Wadhwani,(1962) 1 SCR 753=AIR
1961 SC 1506 when it pithily laid down the applicable principles and stated
them thus :-

“ 9. xxx We must, however, point out that the Rule that
the party who applies for the issue of a high prerogative
writ should, before he approaches the Court, have
exhausted other remedies open to him under the law, is
132

WP(C) No.10685/2004

not one which bars the jurisdiction of the High Court to
entertain the petition or to deal with it, but is rather a
Rule which Courts have laid down for the exercise of
their discretion.
10. The passages in the judgments of this Court we have
extracted would indicate (1) that the two exceptions
which the learned Solicitor-General formulated to the
normal Rule as to the effect of the existence of an
adequate alternative remedy were by no means
exhaustive, and (2) that even beyond them a discretion
vested in the High Court to have entertained the petition
and granted the petitioner relief notwithstanding the
existence of an alternative remedy. We need only add
that the broad lines of the general principles on which
the Court should act having been clearly laid down, their
application to the facts of each particular case must
necessarily be dependent on a variety of individual facts
which must govern the proper exercise of the discretion
of the Court, and that in a matter which is thus preeminently one of discretion, it is not possible or even if it
were, it would not be desirable to lay down inflexible
Rules which should be applied with rigidity in every
case which comes up before the Court.”
176.

Learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners have

strongly relied on AIR 1989 SC 1607 Shri Anadi Mukta Sadguru Shree
Muktajee Vandasjiswami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust &
Ors. v. V.R. Rudani & Ors. In this case, the court was concerned with an
objection raised by the respondents in a writ petition to the effect that the
respondent was a trust which was not a statutory body and subject to writ
jurisdiction of the High Court. In this behalf, the court observed thus :-

“14.
If the rights are purely of a private
character no mandamus can issue.
If the
management of the college is purely a private body
with no public duty mandamus will not lie. These
are two exceptions to Mandamus. But once these
are absent and when the party has no other equally
133

WP(C) No.10685/2004

convenient remedy, mandamus cannot be denied. It
has to be appreciated that the appellants-trust was
manging the affiliated college to which public
money is paid as Government aid. Public money
paid as Government aid plays a major role in the
control, maintenance and working of educational
institutions.
The aided institutions like
Govoernment institutions discharge public function
by way of imparting eduction to students. They are
subject to the rules and regulations of the affiliating
University. Their activities are closely supervised
by the University authorities. m Employment in
such institutions, therefore, is not devoid of any
public character.
(see The evolving Indian
Administrative Law by M.P.Jain (1983) p.266). So
are the service condititions of the academic staff.
When the University takes a decision regarding
their pay scales, it will be binding on the
management.
The service condititons of the
academic staff are, therefore, not purely of a private
character.
It has super-added protection by
University decisions creating a legal right-duty
relationship between the staff and the management.
When there is existence of this relationship,
mandamus cannot be refused to the aggrieved
party.”
After so observing, the court considered the scope of Article 226
of the Constitution and further observed thus :“19.
The term “authority” used in Article 226, in
the context, must receive a liberal meaning unlike the
term in Article 12. Article 12 is relevant only for the
purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights under
Art. 32. Article 226 confers power on the High Courts
to issue writs for enforcement of the fundamental rights
as well as non-fundamental rights. The words “Any
person or authority” used in Article 226 are, therefore,
not to be confined only to statutory authorities and
instrumentalities of the State. They may cover and
other person or body performing public duty. The form
of the body concerned is not very much relevant. What
is relevant is the nature of the duty imposed on the
body. The duty must be judged in the light of positive
obligation owed by the person or authority to the
affected party. No matter by what means the duty is
134

WP(C) No.10685/2004

imposed. If a positive obligation exists mandamus
cannot be denied.
21.
Here again we may point out that mandamus
cannot be denied on the ground that the duty to be
enforced is not imposed by the statute. Commenting on
the development of this law, professor De Smith states:
“To be enforceable by mandamus a public duty does
not necessarily have to be one imposed by statute. It
may be sufficient for the duty to have been imposed by
charter,
common
law,
custom
or
even
contract.”(Judicial Review of Adminstrative Act 4th
Ed.P.540). We share this view. The judicial control
over the fast expanding maze of bodies affectiving the
rights of the people should not be put into water-tight
compartment. It should remain flexible to meet the
requirements of variable circumstances. mandamus is a
very wide remedy which must be easily available 'to
reach injustice wherever it is found'. Technicalities
should not come in the way of granting that relief under
Article 226. We, therefore, reject the contention urged
for the appellants on the maintainability of the writ
petition.”
The Apex Court also explained the scope of mandamus in this
judgment and had stated thus :
“15.
The law relating to mandamus has made the
most spectacular advance. It may be recalled that the
remedy by prerogative writs in England started with
very limited scope and suffered from many procedural
disadvantages. To overcome the difficulties, Lord
Gardiner (the Lord Chancellor) in pursuance of Section
3(1)(e) of the LawCommission Act, 1965, requested the
“Commission”to review the existing remedies for the
judicial control of adminstrative acts and commissions
with a view to evolving a simpler and more effective
procedure.” The Law Commission made their report in
March 1976 (Law Com No.73). It was implemented by
Rules of Court (o0rder 53) in 1977 and given statutory
force in 1981 by Section 31 of the Supreme Court Act
1981. It combined all the former remedies into one
proceeding called judicial review. Lord Denning
explains the scope of this “judicial review”:
“At one stroke the courts could grant whatever
relief was appropriate. Not only certiorari and
135

WP(C) No.10685/2004

mandamus, but also declaration and injunction.
Even damages. The procedure was much more
simple and expeditious. Just a summons instead
of a writ. NO formal pleadings. The evidence
was given by affidavit. As a rule no crossexamination, no discovery, and so forth. But
there were important safeguards. In particular,
in order to qualify, the applicant had to get the
leave of a judge.
The statute is phrased in flexible terms. It
gives scope for development. It uses the words “having
regard to”. Those words are very indefinite. The result is
that the courts are not bound hand and foot by the
previous law. They are to 'have regard to' it. So the
previous law as to who are - and who are not - public
authorities, is not absolutely binding. Nor is the previous
law as to the matters in respect of which relief may as to
the matters in respect of which relief may be granted.
This means that the judges can develop the public law as
they think best. That they have done and are doing.” (seeThe Closing Chapter - by Rt.Hon Lord Denning p. 122).”
177.

In AIR 1990 SC 1031 Mahavir Auto Stores & Ors. v. Indian

Oil Corporation & Ors., the appellant had been carrying on business of sale
and distribution of lubricants for 18 years. The respondent Indian Oil
Corporation abruptly stopped supply of lubricants to the firm without any
notice of the intimation. No query or clarification even was sought for and
there was no adjudication as such. The petitioner impeached the action of
the respondents contending that its decision was in exercise of
administrative jurisdiction and impeachable on ground of arbitrariness and
violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India on any of the grounds
available in the public law field. In this behalf, the court observed thus :“12.
It is well settled that every action of the State
or an instrumentality of the State in exercise of its
executive power, must be informed by reason. In
appropriate cases, actions uninformed by reason may be
136

WP(C) No.10685/2004

questioned as arbitrary in proceedings under Article
226 or Article 32 of the Constitution. Reliance in this
connection may be placed on the observations of this
Court in M/s Radha Krishna Agarwal Vs. State of
Bihar, (1977) 3 SCC 457 : (AIR 1977 SC 1496). It
appears to us, at the outset, that in the facts and
circumstances of the case, the respondent-company IOC
is an organ of the state or an instrumentality of the State
as contemplated under Article 12 of the Constitution.
The State acts in its executive power under Article 298
of the Constitution in entering or not entering in
contracts with individual parties. Article 14 of the
Constitution would be applicable to those exercises of
power. Therefore, the action of State organ under
Article 14 can be checked. See M/s Radha Krishna
Agarwal V. State of Bihar at p. 462 (at SCC) : (at p.
1499-1500 of AIR) (supra), but Article 14 of the
Constitution cannot and has not been construed as a
charter for judicial review of State action after the
contract has been entered into, to call upon the State to
account for its actions in its manifold activities by
stating reasons for such actions. In a situation of this
nature certain activities of the respondent company
which constituted State under Article 12 of the
Constitution may be in certain circumstances subject to
Article 14 of the Constitution in entering or not entering
into contracts and must be reasonable and taken only
upon lawful and relevant consideration, it depends upon
facts and circumstances of a particular transaction
whether hearing is necessary and reasons have to be
stated. In case any right conferred on the citizens which
is sought to be interfered, such action is subject to
Article 14 of the Constitution, and must be reasonable
and can be taken only upon lawful and relevant grounds
of public interest. Where there is arbitrariness in State
action of this type of entering or not entering into
contracts, Article 14 springs up and judicial review
strikes such an action down. Every action of the State
executive authority must be subject to rule of law and
must be informed by reason. So, whatever be the
activity of the public authority, in such monopoly or
semi-monopoly dealings, it should meet the test of
Article 14 of the Constitution. If a Governmental
action even in the matters of entering or not entering
into contracts, fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness,
the same would be unreasonable. In this connection
137

WP(C) No.10685/2004

reference may be made to E.P. Royappa V. State of
Tamil Nadu, (1974) 4 SCC 3 : (AIR 1974 SC 555);
Maneka Gandhi V. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248 :
(AIR 1978 SC 597), Ajay Hasia V. Khalid Mujib
Sehravardi, (1981) 1 SCC 722 : (AIR 1981 SC 487) :
R.D. Shetty vs. International Airport Authority of India,
(1979) 3 SCC 489. It appears to us that rule of reason
and rule against arbitrariness and discrimination, rules
of fair play and natural justice are part of the rule of law
applicable in situation or action by State instrumentality
in dealing with citizens in a situation like the present
one. Even though the rights of the citizens are in the
nature of contractual rights, the manner, the method and
motive of a decision of entering or not entering into a
contract, are subject to judicial review on the
touchstone of relevance and reasonableness, fair play,
natural justice, equality and non-discrimination in the
type of the transactions and nature of the dealings as in
the present case.
13.
The existence of the power of judicial
review however depends upon the natural (of) and the
right involved in the facts and circumstances of the
particualr case, it is well settled that there can be
“malice in law”. Existence of such “malice in law” is
part of the critical apparatus of a particular action in
administrative law. Indeed “malice in law” is part of
the dimension of the rule of relevance and reason as
well as the rule of fair play in action.”
178.

The Apex Court in Mahavir Auto Store(supra) further held :“17.
We are of the opinion that in all such cases
whether public law or private law rights are involved,
depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case.
The dichotomy between rights and remedies cannot be
obliterated by any straight jacket formula. It has to be
examined in each particular case. Mr. Salve sought to
urge that there are certain cases under Article 14 of
arbitrary exercise of such “power” and not cases of
exercise of a “right” arising either under a contract or
under a Statute. We are of the opinion that that would
depend upon the factual matrix.
18. Having considered the facts and circumstances of
the case and the nature of the contentions and the
dealing between the parties and in view of the present
state of law, we are of the opinion that decision of the
State/public authority under Article 298 of the
Constitution, is an administrative decision and can be
138

WP(C) No.10685/2004

179.

impeached on the ground that the decision is arbitrary
or violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India on
any of the grounds available in public law field. It
appears to us that in respect of corporation like IOC
when without informing the parties concerned, as in the
case of the appellant-firm herein on alleged change of
policy and on that basis action to seek to bring to an
end to course of transaction over 18 years involving
large amounts of money is not fair action, especially in
view of the monopolistic nature of the power of the
respondent in this field. Therefore, it is necessary to
reiterate that even in the field of public law, the
relevant persons concerned or to be affected, should be
taken into confidence. Whether and in what
circumstances that confidence should be taken into
consideration cannot be laid down on any strait-jacket
basis. It depends on the nature of the right involved and
nature of the power sought to be exercised in a
particular situation. It is true that there is discrimination
between power and right but whether the State or the
instrumentality of a State has the right to function in
public field or private field is a matter which, in our
opinion, depends upon the facts and circumstances of
the situation, but such exercise of power cannot be
dealt with by the State or the instrumentality of the
State without informing and taking into confidence, the
party whose rights and powers are affected or sought to
be affected, into confidence. In such situations most
often people feel aggrieved by exclusion of knowledge
if not taken into confidence.”
So far as the termination of the relationship between the parties

was concerned, the court in para 19 observed that in a situation of the
transactions between the parties for nearly two decades, such procedure
should be followed, which will be reasonable, fair and just, i.e., the
procedure which normally be expected to be followed by an organ of the
state and that process must be conscious and all those effected should be
taken into confidence. Equality and fairness at least demands this much
from an instrumentality of the state dealing with a right of the state not to
treat the contract as subsisting.
In this background, the court directed that the case of the

139

WP(C) No.10685/2004

respondent put up to the appellant and the respondents considered the
submissions made by the appellant formed afresh.
Thus, the Apex Court clearly held that even in matters relating to
contract, the state or its instrumentality are required to satisfy the test of
their action not being arbitrary or unreasonable.
180.

In Shrilekha Vidyarthi (Kumari) v. State of U.P. (1991) 1 SCC

212 it was clearly held by the Supreme Court that such requirement extends
even in the sphere of contractual matters in which the state is concerned
which would be amenable to judicial review :-

“20. xxx We have no hesitation in saying that the
personality of the State, requiring regulation of its
conduct in all spheres by requirements of Article 14, does
not undergo such a radical change after the making of a
contract merely because some contractual rights accrue to
the other party in addition. It is not as if the requirements
of Article 14 and contractual obligations are alien
concepts, which cannot co-exist.
21. The Preamble of the Constitution of India resolves to
secure to all its citizens Justice, social, economic and
political; and Equality of status and opportunity. Every
State action must be aimed at achieving this goal. Part IV
of the Constitution contains ‘Directives Principles of
State Policy’ which are fundamental in the governance of
the country and are aimed at securing social and
economic freedoms by appropriate State action which is
complementary to individual fundamental rights
guaranteed in Part III for protection against excesses of
State action, to realise the vision in the Preamble. This
being the philosophy of the Constitution, can it be said
that it contemplates exclusion of Article 14 - nonarbitrariness which is basic to rule of law — from State
actions in contractual field when all actions of the State
are meant for public good and expected to be fair and
just? We have no doubt that the Constitution does not
envisage or permit unfairness or unreasonableness in
State actions in any sphere of its activity contrary to the
professed ideals in the Preamble. In our opinion, it would
be alien to the constitutional scheme to accept the
argument of exclusion of Article 14 in contractual
matters. The scope and permissible grounds of judicial
140

WP(C) No.10685/2004

review in such matters and the relief which may be
available are different matters but that does not justify the
view of its total exclusion. This is more so when the
modern trend is also to examine the unreasonableness of
a term in such contracts where the bargaining power is
unequal so that these are not negotiated contracts but
standard form contracts between unequals.
22. There is an obvious difference in the contracts
between private parties and contracts to which the State is
a party. Private parties are concerned only with their
personal interest whereas the State while exercising its
powers and discharging its functions, acts indubitably, as
is expected of it, for public good and in public interest.
The impact of every State action is also on public
interest. This factor alone is sufficient to import at least
the minimal requirements of public law obligations and
impress with this character the contracts made by the
State or its instrumentality. It is a different matter that the
scope of judicial review in respect of disputes falling
within the domain of contractual obligations may be more
limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be relegated
to adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies
provided for adjudication of purely contractual disputes.
However, to the extent, challenge is made on the ground
of violation of Article 14 by alleging that the impugned
act is arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, the fact that the
dispute also falls within the domain of contractual
obligations would not relieve the State of its obligation to
comply with the basic requirements of Article 14. To this
extent, the obligation is of a public character invariably in
every case irrespective of there being any other right or
obligation in addition thereto. An additional contractual
obligation cannot divest the claimant of the guarantee
under Article 14 of non-arbitrariness at the hands of the
State in any of its actions.

24. The State cannot be attributed the split personality of
Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the contractual field so as to
impress on it all the characteristics of the State at the
threshold while making a contract requiring it to fulfil the
obligation of Article 14 of the Constitution and thereafter
permitting it to cast off its garb of State to adorn the new
robe of a private body during the subsistence of the
contract enabling it to act arbitrarily subject only to the
contractual obligations and remedies flowing from it. It is
really the nature of its personality as State which is
significant and must characterize all its actions, in
whatever field, and not the nature of function, contractual
or otherwise, which is decisive of the nature of scrutiny
permitted for examining the validity of its act. The
141

WP(C) No.10685/2004

requirement of Article 14 being the duty to act fairly,
justly and reasonably, there is nothing which militates
against the concept of requiring the State always to so
act, even in contractual matters. There is a basic
difference between the acts of the State which must
invariably be in pubic interest and those of a private
individual, engaged in similar activities, being primarily
for personal gain, which may or may not promote public
interest. Viewed in this manner, in which we find no
conceptual difficulty or anachronism, we find no reason
why the requirement of Article 14 should not extend even
in the sphere of contractual matters for regulating the
conduct of the State activity.
xxxx
xxxx

27. Unlike a private party whose acts uninformed by
reason and influenced by personal predilections in
contractual matters may result in adverse consequences to
it alone without affecting the public interest, any such act
of the State or a public body even in this field would
adversely affect the public interest. Every holder of a
public office by virtue of which he acts on behalf of the
State or public body is ultimately accountable to the
people in whom the sovereignty vests. As such, all
powers so vested in him are meant to be exercised for
public good and promoting the public interest. This is
equally true of all actions even in the field of contract.
Thus, every holder of a public office is a trustee whose
highest duty is to the people of the country and, therefore,
every act of the holder of a public office, irrespective of
the label classifying that act, is in discharge of public
duty meant ultimately for public good. With the
diversification of State activity in a Welfare State
requiring the State to discharge its wide ranging functions
even through its several instrumentalities, which requires
entering into contracts also, it would be unreal and not
pragmatic, apart from being unjustified to exclude
contractual matters from the sphere of State actions
required to be non-arbitrary and justified on the
touchstone of Article 14.
xxxx
xxxx
xxxx
29. It can no longer be doubted at this point of time that
Article 14 of the Constitution of India applies also to
matters of governmental policy and if the policy or any
action of the government, even in contractual matters,
fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness, it would be
unconstitutional. (See Ramana Dayaram Shetty v.
International Airport Authority of India and Kasturi Lal
Lakshmi Reddy v. State of Jammu and Kashmir). In Col.
A.S. Sangwan v. Union of India while the discretion to
change the policy in exercise of the executive power,
when not trammelled by the statute or rule, was held to be
wide, it was emphasised as imperative and implicit in
Article 14 of the Constitution that a change in policy
142

WP(C) No.10685/2004

must be made fairly and should not give the impression
that it was so done arbitrarily or by any ulterior criteria.
The wide sweep of Article 14 and the requirement of
every State action qualifying for its validity on this
touchstone, irrespective of the field of activity of the
State, has long been settled. Later decisions of this Court
have reinforced the foundation of this tenet and it would
be sufficient to refer only to two recent decisions of this
Court for this purpose.
30. xxx In view of the wide ranging and, in essence, allpervading sphere of State activity in discharge of its
welfare functions, the question assumes considerable
importance and cannot be shelved. The basic requirement
of Article 14 is fairness in action by the State and we find
it difficult to accept that the State can be permitted to act
otherwise in any field of its activity, irrespective of the
nature of its functions when it has the uppermost duty to
be governed by the rule of law. Non-arbitrariness, in
substance, is only fair play in action. We have no doubt
that this obvious requirement must be satisfied by every
action of the State or its instrumentality in order to satisfy
the test of validity.
xxxxx

35. It is now too well settled that every State action, in
order to survive, must not be susceptible to the vice of
arbitrariness which is the crux of Article 14 of the
Constitution and basic to the rule of law, the system
which governs us. Arbitrariness is the very negation of
the rule of law. Satisfaction of this basic test in every
State action is sine qua non to its validity and in this
respect, the State cannot claim comparison with a private
individual even in the field of contract. This distinction
between the State and a private individual in the field of
contract has to be borne in the mind.”
181.

An objection to the maintainability of the writ petition on the

ground of availability of the arbitration clause in the contract fell for
consideration before the Apex Court in Harbanslal Sahnia v. Indian Oil
Corpn. Ltd. (2003) 2 SCC 107
“ xxx
xxxx
xxxx
7. So far as the view taken by the High Court that
the remedy by way of recourse to arbitration clause
was available to the appellants and therefore the
writ petition filed by the appellants was liable to be
dismissed is concerned, suffice it to observe that
143

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the rule of exclusion of writ jurisdiction by
availability of an alternative remedy is a rule of
discretion and not one of compulsion. In an
appropriate case, in spite of availability of the
alternative remedy, the High Court may still
exercise its writ jurisdiction in at least three
contingencies: (i) where the writ petition seeks
enforcement of any of the fundamental rights; (ii)
where there is failure of principles of natural
justice; or (iii) where the orders or proceedings are
wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is
challenged. (See Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of
Trade Marks). The present case attracts
applicability of the first two contingencies.
Moreover, as noted, the petitioners’ dealership,
which is their bread and butter, came to be
terminated for an irrelevant and non-existent cause.
In such circumstances, we feel that the appellants
should have been allowed relief by the High Court
itself instead of driving them to the need of
initiating arbitration proceedings.”
182.

The same question was raised before the Apex Court in JT 2003

(10) SC 300 ABL International Ltd. & Anr. v. Export Credit Guarantee
Corporation of India Limited & Ors. Placing reliance on the principles laid
down in the earlier judgments the court held that the Article 226 of the
Constitution, depending on the fact situation is adequately empowered to
grant the relief. The principles were so enunciated by the court :“8.
As could be seen from the arguments
addressed in this appeal and as also from the divergent
views of the two courts below one of the questions that
falls for our consideration is whether a writ petition
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is
maintainable to enforce a contractual obligation of the
State or its instrumentality, by an aggrieved party.
9.
In our opinion this question is no more res
integra and is settled by a large number of judicial
pronouncements of this Court. In K.N. Guruswamy v.
The State of Mysore and Others, 1955 (1) SCR 305 this
Court held :
“The next question is whether the
appellant can complain of this by way of a
writ. In our opinion, he could have done so in
an ordinary case. The appellant is interested in
these contracts and has a right under the laws
of the State to receive the same treatment and
144

WP(C) No.10685/2004

be given the same chance as anybody else.
.........We would therefore in the ordinary
course have given the appellant the writ he
seeks. But owing to the time which this matter
has taken to reach us (a consequence for which
the appellant is in no way to blame, for he has
done all he could to have an early hearing),
there is barely a fortnight of the contract left to
go ..... A writ would therefore be ineffective
and as it is not our practice to issue
meaningless writs we must dismiss this appeal
and leave the appellant content with an
enunciation of the law.”
10.
It is clear from the above observations of this
Court in the said case though a writ was not issued on
the facts of that case, this Court has held that on a given
set of facts if a State acts in an arbitrary manner even in
a matter of contract, an aggrieved party can approach
the court by way of writ under Article 226 of the
Constitution and the court depending on facts of the said
case is empowered to grant the relief. This judgment in
K.N. Gurusway v. The State of Mysore and Others
(supra) was followed subsequently by this Court in the
case of The D.F.O, South Kheri & Ors. v. Ram Sanehi
Singh, 1971 (3) SCC 864 wherein this Court held :
“By that order he has deprived the
respondent of a valuable right. We are unable
to hold that merely because the source of the
right which the respondent claims was initially
in a contract, for obtaining relief against any
arbitrary and unlawful action on the part of a
public authority he must resort to a suit and
not to a petition by way of a writ. In view of
the judgment of this Court in K.N.
Guruswamy's case [1955 (1) SCR 305], there
can be no doubt that the petition was
maintainable, even if the right to relief arose
out of an alleged breach of contract, where the
action challenged was of a public authority
invested with statutory power.” (Emphasis
supplied)
11.
In the case of Gujarat State Financial
Corporation v. M/s. Lotus Hotels Pvt. Ltd., 1983 AIR
SC 848 this Court following an earlier judgment in R.D.
Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India held :
“The instrumentality of the State
145

WP(C) No.10685/2004

which would be 'other authority' under
Article 12 cannot commit breach of a solemn
undertaking to the prejudice of the other
party which acted on that undertaking or
promise and put itself in a disadvantageous
position. The appellant Corporation, created
under the State Financial Corporation Act,
falls within the expression of 'other authority'
in Article 12 and if it backs out from such a
promise, it cannot be said that the only
remedy for the aggrieved party would be
suing for damages for breach and that it
could not compel the Corporation for
specific performance of the contract under
Article 226.”
xxx

17.
The above judgment of Smt. Gunwant Kaur
& Ors. v. Municipal Committee Bhatinda & Ors. 1970
AIR SC 802 finds support from another judgment of this
Court in the case of Century Spinning and
Manufacturing Company Ltd. & Anr. v. The Ulhasnagar
Municipal Council & Anr. 1970 (3) SCR 854 wherein
this Court held :
“Merely because a question of fact
is raised, the High Court will not be justified
in requiring the party to seek relief by the
somewhat lengthy, dilatory and expensive
process by a civil suit against a public body.
The questions of fact raised by the petition in
this case are elementary.”
18.
This observation of the Court was made
while negating a contention advanced on behalf of the
respondent-Municipality which contended that the
petition filed by the appellant-company therein
apparently raised questions of fact which argument of
the Municipality was accepted by the High Court
holding that such disputed question of fact cannot be
tried in the exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction
under Article 226 of the Constitution. But this Court
held otherwise.
19.
Therefore, it is clear from the above
enunciation of law that merely because one of the
parties to the litigation raises a dispute in regard to the
facts of the case, the court entertaining such petition
146

WP(C) No.10685/2004

under Article 226 of the Constitution is not always
bound to relegate the parties to a suit. In the above case
of Smt. Gunwant Kaur (supra), this Court even went
to the extent of holding that in a writ petition, if facts
required, even oral evidence can be taken. This clearly
shows that in an appropriate case, the writ court has the
jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition involving
disputed questions of fact and there is no absolute bar
for entertaining a writ petition even if the same arises
out of a contractual obligation and or involves some
disputed questions of fact.
xxxx

22.
We do not think the above judgment in VST
Industries Ltd. (supra) supports the argument of the
learned counsel on the question of maintainability of the
present writ petition. It is to be noted that VST
Industries Ltd. against whom the writ petition was filed
was not a State or an instrumentality of a State as
contemplated under Article 12 of the Constitution,
hence, in the normal course, no writ could have been
issued against the said industry. But it was the
contention of the writ petitioner in that case that the said
industry was obligated under the concerned statute to
perform certain public functions, failure to do so would
give rise to a complaint under Article 226 against a
private body. While considering such argument, this
Court held that when an authority has to perform a
public function or a public duty if there is a failure a
writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is
maintainable. In the instant case, as to the fact that the
respondent is an instrumentality of a State, there is no
dispute but the question is : Was first respondent
discharging a public duty or a public function while
repudiating the claim of the appellants arising out of a
contract ? Answer to this question, in our opinion, is
found in the judgment of this Court in the case of
Kumari Shri Lekha Vidyarthi & Ors. v. State of U.P.
& Ors. JT 1990 (4) SC 211
xxx
xxx
23.
It is clear from the above observations of this
Court, once State or an instrumentality of State is a party
to the contract, it has an obligation in law to act fairly,
justly and reasonably which is the requirement of
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, if by
147

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the impugned repudiation of the claim of the appellants
the first respondent as an instrumentality of the State has
acted in contravention of the above said requirement of
article 14 then we have no hesitation that a writ court
can issue suitable directions to set right the arbitrary
actions of the first respondent.
xxxx

xxxx

28.
However, while entertaining an objection as
to the maintainability of a writ petition under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, the court should bear in
mind the fact that the power to issue prerogative writs
under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in
nature and is not limited by any other provisions of the
Constitution. The High Court having regard to the facts
of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to
entertain a writ petition. The Court has imposed upon
itself certain restrictions in the exercise of this power
[See : Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade
Marks, Mumbai & Ors, JT 1998 (7) SC 243]. And this
plenary right of the High Court to issue a prerogative
writ will not normally be exercised by the Court to the
exclusion of other available remedies unless such action
of the State or its instrumentality is arbitrary and
unreasonable so as to violate the constitutional mandate
of Article 14 or for other valid and legitimate reasons,
for which the court thinks it necessary to exercise the
said jurisdiction.
xxxx

xxxx

52.
On the basis of the above conclusion of ours,
the question still remains why should we grant the
reliefs sought for by the appellant in a writ petition
when a suitable efficacious alternate remedy is available
by way of a suit. The answer to this question in our
opinion, lies squarely in the decision of this Court in the
case of Shri Lekha Vidyarthi xxx”
53.
From the above, it is clear that when an
instrumentality of the State acts contrary to public
interest, unfairly, unjustly and unreasonably, in its
contractual, constitutional or statutory obligations, it
really acts contrary to the constitutional guarantee found
in Article 14 of the Constitution.”
183.

The scope of judicial review on these grounds in matters which

148

WP(C) No.10685/2004

may be in the realm of contract is best described by the Apex Court in its
recent pronouncement reported at (2006) 2 SCC 364 Union of India v.
Flight Cadet Ashish Rai :“6. There should be judicial restraint while making
judicial review in administrative matters. Where
irrelevant aspects have been eschewed from
consideration and no relevant aspect has been ignored
and the administrative decisions have nexus with the
facts on record, there is no scope for interference. The
duty of the court is (a) to confine itself to the question of
legality; (b) to decide whether the decision-making
authority exceeded its powers; (c) committed an error of
law; (d) committed breach of the rules of natural justice;
and (e) reached a decision which no reasonable tribunal
would have reached; or (f) abused its powers.
Administrative action is subject to control by judicial
review in the following manner:
(i) Illegality: this means the decision-maker must
understand correctly the law that regulates his decisionmaking power and must give effect to it.
(ii) Irrationality, namely, Wednesbury unreasonableness.
(iii) Procedural impropriety.
11. The principles which have to be applied in judicial
review of administrative decisions, especially those
relating to acceptance of tender and award of contract,
have been considered in great detail by a three-Judge
Bench in Tata Cellular v. Union of India1. It was
observed that the principles of judicial review would
apply to the exercise of contractual powers by
government bodies in order to prevent arbitrariness or
favouritism. However, it must be clearly stated that there
are inherent limitations in exercise of that power of
judicial review. Government is the guardian of the
finances of the State. It is expected to protect the
financial interest of the State. The right to refuse the
lowest or any other tender is always available to the
Government. But, the principles laid down in Article 14
of the Constitution have to be kept in view while
accepting or refusing a tender. There can be no question
of infringement of Article 14 if the Government tries to
get the best person or the best quotation. The right to
choose cannot be considered to be an arbitrary power.
Of course, if the said power is exercised for any
collateral purpose the exercise of that power will be
struck down. (See para 85 of the Report, SCC para 70.)

149

WP(C) No.10685/2004

12. After an exhaustive consideration of a large number
of decisions and standard books on administrative law,
the Court enunciated the principle that the modern trend
points to judicial restraint in administrative action. The
court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely
reviews the manner in which the decision was made.
The court does not have the expertise to correct the
administrative decision. If a review of the administrative
decision is permitted it will be substituting its own
decision, without the necessary expertise, which itself
may be fallible. The Government must have freedom of
contract. In other words, fair play in the joints is a
necessary concomitant for an administrative body
functioning in an administrative sphere or quasiadministrative sphere. However, the decision must not
only be tested by the application of Wednesbury
principles of reasonableness but also must be free from
arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated by mala
fides. It was also pointed out that quashing decisions
may impose heavy administrative burden on the
administration and lead to increased and unbudgeted
expenditure. (See para 113 of the Report, SCC para 94.)
13. In Sterling Computers Ltd. v. M & N Publications
Ltd.2 it was held as under: (SCC p.
458, paras
18-19)
“18. While exercising the power of judicial review, in
respect of contracts entered into on behalf of the State,
the court is concerned primarily as to whether there has
been any infirmity in the ‘decision-making process’. …
By way of judicial review the court cannot examine the
details of the terms of the contract which have been
entered into by the public bodies or the State. Courts
have inherent limitations on the scope of any such
enquiry. But at the same time … the courts can certainly
examine whether ‘decision-making process’ was
reasonable, rational, not arbitrary and violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution.
19. If the contract has been entered into without
ignoring the procedure which can be said to be basic in
nature and after an objective consideration of different
options available taking into account the interest of the
State and the public, then court cannot act as an
appellate authority by substituting its opinion in respect
of selection made for entering into such contract.”
14. In Raunaq International Ltd. v. I.V.R. Construction
Ltd.3 it was observed that the award of a contract,
whether it is by a private party or by a public body or the
State, is essentially a commercial transaction. In arriving
at a commercial decision, considerations which are of
paramount importance are commercial considerations,
150

WP(C) No.10685/2004

which would include, inter alia, the price at which the
party is willing to work, whether the goods or services
offered are of the requisite specifications and whether
the person tendering is of the ability to deliver the goods
or services as per specifications.

184.

15. The law relating to award of contract by the State
and public sector corporations was reviewed in Air India
Ltd. v. Cochin International Airport Ltd.4 and it was
held that the award of a contract, whether by a private
party or by a State, is essentially a commercial
transaction. It can choose its own method to arrive at a
decision and it is free to grant any relaxation for bona
fide reasons, if the tender conditions permit such a
relaxation. It was further held that the State, its
corporations, instrumentalities and agencies have the
public duty to be fair to all concerned. Even when some
defect is found in the decision-making process, the court
must exercise its discretionary powers under Article 226
with great caution and should exercise it only in
furtherance of public interest and not merely on the
making out of a legal point. The court should always
keep the larger public interest in mind in order to decide
whether its intervention is called for or not. Only when
it comes to a conclusion that overwhelming public
interest requires interference, the court should interfere.”
From the foregoing, it is well settled that even in matters relating

to award of contracts, there is no absolute prohibition to the maintainability
of the writ petition. The action of the authority is amenable to judicial
review and is to be tested on the touchstone of arbitrariness on the
principles laid down above. It now become necessary to examine the next
question which has also been urged at great length. The principles which
can be culled out from these decisions are set down thereafter.
Scope of challenge on grounds of violation under Article 14 of the
Constitution
185.

Learned senior counsels on both sides have placed arguments

and extensive case law on the parameters for testing the action of the
authority on the touchstone of arbitrariness under Article 14 of the
Constitution. This issue has arisen before the Apex Court repeatedly in a
151

WP(C) No.10685/2004

variety of situations and the principles which would govern its
consideration are well settled. Amongst the several pronouncements on this
aspects, the judgment in (1969) 1 SCC 414 Rashbehari Panda v. State of
Orissa authoritatively lays down the applicable principles. The Government
of Orissa was concerned with a scheme of sale of Kendu leaves. It took a
decision to invite only those individuals who had carried out the contracts
satisfactorily in the previous year without default.

This action was

challenged by those left out. In its judgment, the court laid down the
principles as follows :
“17. Validity of the schemes adopted by the Government
of Orissa for sale of Kendu leaves must be adjudged in
the light of Article 19(1)(g) and Article 14. Instead of
inviting tenders the Government offered to certain old
contractors the option to purchase Kendu leaves for the
year 1968 on terms mentioned therein. The reason
suggested by the Government that these offers were
made because the purchasers had carried out their
obligations in the previous year to the satisfaction of the
Government is not of any significance. From the affidavit
filed by the State Government it appears that the price
fetched at public auctions before and after January 1968,
were much higher than the prices at which Kendu leaves
were offered to the old contractors. The Government
realised that the scheme of offering to enter into contracts
with the old licencees and to renew their terms was open
to grave objection, since it sought arbitrarily to exclude
many persons interested in the trade. The Government
then decided to invite offers for advance purchases of
Kendu leaves but restricted the invitation to those
individuals who had carried out the contracts in the
previous year without default and to the satisfaction of
the Government. By the new scheme instead of the
Government making an offer, the existing contractors
were given the exclusive right to make offers to purchase
Kendu leaves. But insofar as the right to make tenders for
the purchase of Kendu leaves was restricted to those
persons who had obtained contracts in the previous year
152

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the scheme was open to the same objection. The right to
make offers being open to a limited class of persons it
effectively shut out all other persons carrying on trade in
Kendu leaves and also new entrants into that business. It
was ex facie discriminatory, and imposed unreasonable
restrictions upon the right of persons other than existing
contractors to carry on business. In our view, both the
schemes evolved by the Government were violative of
the fundamental right of the petitioners under Article
19(1)(g) and Article 14 because the schemes gave rise to
a monopoly in the trade in Kendu leaves to certain
traders, and singled out other traders for discriminatory
treatment.
18. The classification based on the circumstance that
certain existing contractors had carried out their
obligations in the previous year regularly and to the
satisfaction of the Government is not based on any real
and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable
relation to the object sought to be achieved i.e. effective
execution of the monopoly in the public interest.
Exclusion of all persons interested in the trade, who were
not in the previous year licencees is ex facie arbitrary, it
had no direct relation to the object of preventing
exploitation of pluckers and growers of Kendu leaves,
nor had it any just or reasonable relation to the securing
of the full benefit from the trade to the State.
19. Validity of the law by which the State assumed the
monopoly to trade in a given commodity has to be judged
by the test whether the entire benefit arising therefrom is
to enure to the State, and the monopoly is not used as a
cloak for conferring private benefit upon a limited class
of persons. The scheme adopted by the Government first
of offering to enter into contracts with certain named
licencees, and later inviting tenders from licencees who
had in the previous year carried out their contracts
satisfactorily is liable to be adjudged void on the ground
that it unreasonably excludes traders in Kendu leaves
from carrying on their business. The scheme of selling
Kendu leaves to selected purchasers or of accepting
tenders only from a specified class of purchasers was not
“integrally and essentially” connected with the creation
of the monopoly and was not on the view taken by this
Court in Akadasi Padhan case protected by Article
19(6)(ii): it had therefore to satisfy the requirement of
153

WP(C) No.10685/2004

reasonableness under the first part of Article 19(6). No
attempt was made to support the scheme on the ground
that it imposed reasonable restrictions on the
fundamental rights of the traders to carry on business in
Kendu leaves. The High Court also did not consider
whether the restrictions imposed upon persons excluded
from the benefit of trading satisfied the test of
reasonableness under the first part of Article 19(6). The
High Court examined the problem from the angle
whether the action of the State Government was vitiated
on account of any oblique motive, and whether it was
such as a prudent person carrying on business may
adopt.”
186.

The same issue arose and a challenge was laid to the manner in

which the Government dispensed its largesse on grounds of violation of
Article 14 in Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority
of India (1979) 3 SCC 489. The oft quoted findings of the Apex Court
upon an elaborate consideration of the matter read thus:“ 10.
xxx It is indeed unthinkable that in a
democracy governed by the rule of law the executive
Government or any of its officers should possess
arbitrary power over the interests of the individual.
Every action of the executive Government must be
informed with reason and should be free from
arbitrariness. That is the very essence of the rule of law
and its bare minimal requirement. And to the application
of this principle it makes no difference whether the
exercise of the power involves affectation of some right
or denial of some privilege.
11.
xxxThe discretion of the Government has
been held to be not unlimited in that the Government
cannot give or withhold largessee in its arbitrary
discretion or at its sweet will. It is insisted, as pointed
out by Prof. Reich in an especially stimulating article on
“The New Property” in 73 Yale Law Journal 733, “that
Government action be based on standards that are not
arbitrary or unauthorised”. The Government cannot be
permitted to say that it will give jobs or enter into
contracts or issue quotas or licences only in favour of
those having grey hair or belonging to a particular
political party or professing a particular religious faith.
The Government is still the Government when it acts in
the matter of granting largessee and it cannot act
154

WP(C) No.10685/2004

arbitrarily. It does not stand in the same position as a
private individual.
12. We agree with the observations of Mathew, J., in V.
Punnan Thomas v. State of Kerala that:
“The Government, is not and should not be as free as an
individual in selecting the recipients for its largessee.
Whatever its activity, the Government is still the
Government and will be subject to restraints, inherent in
its position in a democratic society. A democratic
Government cannot lay down arbitrary and capricious
standards for the choice of persons with whom alone it
will deal.”
The same point was made by this Court in Erusian
Equipment and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of West Bengal
where the question was whether blacklisting of a person
without giving him an opportunity to be heard was bad?
Ray, C.J., speaking on behalf of himself and his
colleagues on the Bench pointed out that blacklisting of
a person not only affects his reputation which is, in
Poundian terms, an interest both of personality and
substance, but also denies him equality in the matter of
entering into contract with the Government and it
cannot, therefore, be supported without fair hearing. It
was argued for the Government that no person has a
right to enter into contractual relationship with the
Government and the Government, like any other private
individual, has the absolute right to enter into contract
with any one it pleases. But the Court, speaking through
the learned Chief, Justice, responded that the
Government is not like a private individual who can pick
and choose the person with whom it will deal, but the
Government is still a Government when it enters into
contract or when it is administering largessee and it
cannot, without adequate reason, exclude any person
from dealing with it or take away largessee arbitrarily.
The learned Chief Justice said that when the government
is trading with the public, “the democratic form of
Government demands equality and absence of
arbitrariness and discrimination in such transactions. . .
The activities of the Government have a public element
and, therefore, there should be fairness and equality. The
State need not enter into any contract with anyone, but if
it does so, it must do so fairly without discrimination and
without unfair procedure”. This proposition would hold
good in all cases of dealing by the Government with the
155

WP(C) No.10685/2004

public, where the interest sought to be protected is a
privilege. It must, therefore, be taken to be the law that
where the Government is dealing with the public,
whether by way of giving jobs or entering into contracts
or issuing quotas or licences or granting other forms of
largessee, the Government cannot act arbitrarily at its
sweet will and, like a private individual, deal with any
person it pleases, but its action must be in conformity
with standard or norms which is not arbitrary, irrational
or irrelevant. The power or discretion of the Government
in the matter of grant of largessee including award of
jobs, contracts, quotas, licences, etc. must be confined
and structured by rational, relevant and nondiscriminatory standard or norm and if the Government
departs from such standard or norm in any particular
case or cases, the action of the Government would be
liable to be struck down, unless it can be shown by the
Government that the departure was not arbitrary, but was
based on some valid principle which in itself was not
irrational, unreasonable or discriminatory.

20. Now, obviously where a corporation is an
instrumentality or agency of Government, it would, in
the exercise of its power or discretion, be subject to the
same constitutional or public law limitations as
Government. The rule inhibiting arbitrary action by
Government which we have discussed above must apply
equally where such corporation is dealing with the
public, whether by way of giving jobs or entering into
contracts or otherwise, and it cannot act arbitrarily and
enter into relationship with any person it likes at its
sweet will, but its action must be in conformity with
some principle which meets the test of reason and
relevance.
24.
xxxx
We fail to see how this
observation can help the contention of the respondents.
It does not say that the Government can enter into
contract with anyone it likes arbitrarily and without
reason. On the contrary, it postulates that the
Government may reject a higher tender and accept a
lower one only when there is valid reason to do so, as for
example, where it is satisfied that the person offering the
lower tender is on an overall consideration preferable to
the higher tenderer. There must be some relevant reason
for preferring one tenderer to another, and if there is, the
Government can certainly enter into contract with the
former even though his tender may be lower but it
cannot do so arbitrarily or for extraneous reasons.

34. It is, therefore, obvious that both having regard to
the constitutional mandate of Article 14 as also the
judicially evolved rule of administrative law,
Respondent 1 was not entitled to act arbitrarily in
accepting the tender of Respondents 4, but was bound to
conform to the standard or norm laid down in para 1 of
the notice inviting tenders which required that only a
person running a registered IInd Class hotel or restaurant
and having at least 5 years’ experience as such should be
eligible to tender. It was not the contention of the
appellant that this standard or norm prescribed by
Respondent 1 was discriminatory having no just or
reasonable relation to the object of inviting tenders,
namely, to award the contract to a sufficiently
experienced person who would be able to run efficiently
a IInd Class restaurant at the airport. Admittedly the
standard or norm was reasonable and non-discriminatory
and once such a standard or norm for running a IInd
Class restaurant should be awarded was laid down,
Respondent 1 was not entitled to depart from it and to
award the contract to Respondents 4 who did not satisfy
the condition of eligibility prescribed by the standard or
norm. If there was no acceptable tender from a person
who satisfied the condition of eligibility, Respondent 1
could have rejected the tenders and invited fresh tenders
on the basis of a less stringent standard or norm, but it
could not depart from the standard or norm prescribed
by it and arbitrarily accept the tender of Respondents 4.
When Respondent 1 entertained the tender of
Respondents 4 even though they did not have 5 years’
experience of running a IInd Class restaurant or hotel, it
denied equality of opportunity to others similarly situate
in the matter of tendering for the contract. There might
have been many other persons, in fact the appellant
himself claimed to be one such person, who did not have
5 years’ experience of running a IInd Class restaurant,
but who were otherwise competent to run such a
restaurant and they might also have competed with
Respondents 4 for obtaining the contract, but they were
precluded from doing so by the condition of eligibility
requiring five years’ experience. The action of
Respondent 1 in accepting the tender of Respondents 4,
even though they did not satisfy the prescribed condition
of eligibility, was clearly discriminatory, since it
157

WP(C) No.10685/2004

187.

excluded other persons similarly situate from tendering
for the contract and it was also arbitrary and without
reason. The acceptance of the tender of Respondents 4
was, in the circumstances, invalid as being violative of
the equality clause of the Constitution as also of the rule
of administrative law inhibiting arbitrary action.”
In (2001) 8 SCC 491 Union of India & Ors. v. Dinesh

Engineering Corporation & Ors., the court was called upon to consider the
decision by the railway boards to procure certain spare parts from a
particular supplier on the assumption that there was no other party to supply
such spare with the requisite degree of sophistication, complexity and
decision. In this case, it is noteworthy that only the writ petitioner, a
supplier of such parts to railways for 17 long years and only competitor to
its rival being EDC, had submitted its tenders. The court found that the
policy of the board proceeded on the hypothesis that there was no other
supplier competent enough to supply the required spares which hypothesis
was arrived at without taking into consideration the facts that the petitioners
had been supplying these spare parts for the last 17 years to various
divisions of the Indian Railways which would established by the writ
petitioner from the material before the courts. It was held that this clearly
established the fact that the decision of the board suffer from vice of nonapplication of mind.
188.

The courts have noticed that in matters relating to policy, the

court would not ordinarily interfere. But this did not mean that the courts
have to abrogate their rights to scrutinise whether the policy in question is
formulated keeping in mind the relevant facts and whether the said policy

158

WP(C) No.10685/2004

can be held to be beyond the pale of discrimination or unreasonableness on
the basis of material on record.

Any decision, be it an administrative

decision or a policy decision, if taken without considering the relevant facts
can only be termed as an arbitrary decision and violative of the mandate of
Article 14 of the Constitution. It was held that it was open to the railways,
if it comes to a genuine conclusion that the spare parts manufactured by the
writ petitioner are not acceptable on the grounds of the sophistication,
complexity and high degree of decision then certainly it is for the railways
of that matter, if the terms of offer are not acceptable for any justifiable
reason, it was open to the railways to reject the offer of the writ petitioner.
But none of the above form the basis for creating the monopoly in favour of
the EDC which was thus unreasonable and arbitrary.
So far as the absolute power of the railways to reject a tender in
its absolute discretion was concerned, in the Dinesh Engineering case
(supra) the court held thus :-

“16.
But then as has been held by
this Court in the very same judgment that a public
authority even in contractual matters should not have
unfettered discretion and in contracts having
commercial element even though some extra
discretion is to be conceded in such authorities, they
are bound to follow the norms recognised by courts
while dealing with public property. This requirement
is necessary to avoid unreasonable and arbitrary
decisions being taken by public authorities whose
actions are amenable to judicial review. Therefore,
merely because the authority has certain elbow room
available for use of discretion in accepting offer in
contracts, the same will have to be done within the
159

WP(C) No.10685/2004

189.

four corners of the requirements of law, especially
Article 14 of the Constitution. In the instant case, we
have noticed that apart from rejecting the offer of the
writ petitioner arbitrarily, the writ petitioner has now
been virtually debarred from competing with EDC in
the supply of spare parts to be used in the governors
by the Railways, ever since the year 1992, and during
all this while, we are told the Railways are making
purchases without any tender on a proprietary basis
only from EDC which, in our opinion, is in flagrant
violation of the constitutional mandate of Article 14.
We are also of the opinion that the so-called policy of
the Board creating monopoly of EDC suffers from the
vice of non-application of mind, hence, it has to be
quashed as has been done by the High Court.”
Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned senior Advocate appearing for some

of the petitioners has placed reliance on a judgment dated 6th August, 2004
of the Division Bench of this court referred in Writ Petition(Civil)
4466/2003 titled PSJ Communications Limited v. Bharat Sanchar Nigam
Limited.

In this case, a challenge had been laid to a new eligibility

condition which had been incorporated in a tender enquiry by the Bharat
Sanchar Nigam Limited on ground of irrationality and arbitrariness. After a
close examination of the record which was produced before the court, the
court held thus :“21.
From the above narration of material notings
on the file, it is evident that the entire emphasis was on
the quality of the cable to be supplied. We are unable
to appreciate the co-relation or the nexus between the
quality and the quantum of the commercial order,
particularly when to ensure quality the twin conditions
of valid Type Approval Certificate from Department of
Telecom and possession of ISO Certificate have been
retained as a pre-requisite for a valid tender. It is also
pertinent to note that though the afore-noted
criteria/condition was finalised on the basis of the
recommendations of the Board of Management of
BSNL but a further condition of being an established
160

WP(C) No.10685/2004

190.

supplier, as suggested in the note dated 16th June 2003
and the impugned criteria of successful execution of
commercial order of Rs.One Crore, not even suggested
in any of the notes, was added, without referring the
same to the Board of Management. It is also pertinent
to note that the reason for insertion of the impugned
eligibility condition as stated in the reply affidavit of
the BSNL, namely, non-fulfillment of contractual
obligations by several manufacturers, is not borne out
from the record, wherein, as noticed above, the reason
is the quality of the cable. There is no material or any
discussion as to how and why the impugned criteria
would be in the larger public interest, or subserve the
objects of BSNL. Likewise, in the records no objective
material is available to support such a criteria. Hence,
the explanations offered by BSNL in their affidavits
cannot be accepted. As observed by their Lordships of
the Supreme Court in Mohinder Singh Gill & Anr. Vs.
The Chief Election Commissioner & Ors., AIR 1978
SC 851, the validity of the imugned insertion has to be
judged by the reasoning in the afore-mentioned notes
and this cannot be supplemented by fresh reasons in the
shape of an affidavit or otherwise.”
On the other hand, Mr. P.N. Lekhi, learned senior counsel

appearing for Sulabh International placing reliance on the pronouncement
of the Apex Court in AIR 2001 SC 1447 Uggar Sugar Works Limited v.
Delhi Administration has urged that no writ petition would lie to examine
or adjudicate on the nature of the challenge laid in the instant case.
It was submitted that it was not for the court to enter into the
province of policy and that the Government was entitled to take its own
decisions including the decision to enter into a contract with a particular
party only. This case relates to a challenge to the policy of the Government
in fixing a lower MSF requirement stands in the previous years.

The

challenge was laid on the ground that the policy suffered from injustice,
unfairness or unreasonability and amounted to an invitation to the court to
161

WP(C) No.10685/2004

prescribe MSF requirements in exercise of its powers of judicial review. In
view of the well settled principles of the parameters of permissible judicial
review into executive policy, the court held that the challenge was not
within the parameters of the courts jurisdiction. In this behalf, the Apex
Court observed thus :-

“14. In Har Shankar v. Dy. Excise and Taxation Commr.
Chandrachud, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was)
in para 53 of the judgment opined: (SCC p. 758)
“53. In our opinion, the true position governing dealings
in intoxicants is as stated and reflected in the
Constitution Bench decisions of this Court in Balsara
case, Cooverjee case, Kidwai case, Nagendra Nath case,
Amar Chakraborty case and the R.M.D.C. case, as
interpreted in Harinarayan Jaiswal case and Nashirwar
case. There is no fundamental right to do trade or
business in intoxicants. The State, under its regulatory
powers, has the right to prohibit absolutely every form
of activity in relation to intoxicants - its manufacture,
storage, export, import, sale and possession. In all their
manifestations, these rights are vested in the State and
indeed without such vesting there can be no effective
regulation of various forms of activities in relation to
intoxicants. In American Jurisprudence, Vol. 30 it is
stated that while engaging in liquor traffic is not
inherently unlawful, nevertheless it is a privilege and not
a right, subject to governmental control (p. 538). This
power of control is an incident of the society’s right to
self-protection and it rests upon the right of the State to
care for the health, morals and welfare of the people.
Liquor traffic is a source of pauperism and crime (pp.
539, 540, 541).”
(emphasis supplied)

19. In T.N. Education Deptt. Ministerial and General
Subordinate Services Assn. v. State of T.N. noticing the
jurisdictional limitations to analyse and fault a policy,
this Court opined that: (SCC p. 102, para 16)
“The court cannot strike down a GO, or a policy merely
162

WP(C) No.10685/2004

because there is a variation or contradiction. Life is
sometimes contradiction and even consistency is not
always a virtue. What is important is to know whether
mala fides vitiates or irrational and extraneous factor
fouls.”

24. The argument that since MSF laid down for the
year 1994-1995 were not changed till 1998-99, there
was no need to increase MSF requirements in 19992000 or to further increase the same in the year
2000-2001 for the lowest price tag brand of liquor
from 60,000 cases (7.2 lakh bottles) to 75,000 cases
(9 lakh bottles) for the current year, suffers from the
basic infirmity that it invites the court to enter into
an area of testing the executive policy, not on
grounds whether it is “just, fair and reasonable”, but
whether the object could not have been achieved by
fixing a lower MSF requirement. In other words the
court is being invited to prescribe MSF
requirements in exercise of its power of judicial
review. That is not permissible and we must decline
the invitation to enter that area. It is not within the
province of this Court to lay down that the
executive policy must always remain static, even if
its revision is “just, fair and reasonable”. What is
relevant is to find out whether the executive action
is mala fide, unreasonable or irrational as a
criterion. As already observed the court in exercise
of its power of judicial review cannot sit in
judgment over the policy of administration except
on the limited grounds already noted. Each State is
empowered to formulate its own liquor policy
keeping in view the interest of its citizens.
Determination of wide-scale acceptability of a
particular brand of liquor, on the basis of National
Sales Figures, does not strike us as being
unreasonable, much less irrational. The basis for
determination is not only relevant but also fair. No
direction can be given or expected from the court
regarding the “correctness” of an executive policy
unless while implementing such policies, there is
infringement or violation of any constitutional or
statutory provision. In the present case, not only is
there no such violation but on the other hand, the
State in formulating its policy has exercised its
statutory powers and applied them uniformly.”

191.

On behalf of the respondent, reliance is also placed on (2005) 1

SCC 679 Association of Registration Plates v. Union of India. In this
case, the respondent had effected selection of a single manufacturer through
an open tendering process. Elaborate reasons were also given by the state
authority for justification of selection of such manufacturer as well as for
the length of the duration of the contract. The court noticed the reasons
given observing thus :“26. The learned counsel appearing for the Union of
India, the State authorities and counsel appearing for the
contesting manufacturers, in their replies, have tried to
justify the manner and implementation of the policy
contained in Rule 50. On behalf of the Union of India,
learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that
under Rule 50 read with the statutory Order of 2001
issued under Section 109(3) of the Act, the State
Governments are legally competent to formulate an
appropriate policy for choosing a sole or more
manufacturers in order to fulfil the object of affixation of
security plates. The registration plates have to be issued
and affixed on the premises of the registering authority
and with its permission. It is submitted that the scheme
contained in Rule 50 read with the statutory Order of
2001 leaves it to the discretion of the State concerned to
even choose a single manufacturer for the entire State or
more than one manufacturer regionwise. Such a selection
cannot be said to confer any monopoly right by the State
on any private individual or concern. It is just like
selection of an appropriate person for grant of a contract
or largessee by the State on laid-down criteria of
experience and technical qualifications. A fair process of
selection may eliminate persons or parties who may not
be found technically, financially, and on the basis of past
experience sound, to be awarded the contract. Reliance is
placed on Krishnan Kakkanth v. Govt. of Kerala, Ugar
Sugar Works Ltd. v. Delhi Admn. and M.R.F. Ltd. v.
Inspector Kerala Govt.

28. It is submitted that the tender conditions are
formulated keeping in account the public interest
consideration and aspects of high security. The States do
not possess the requisite resources of their own to
implement the scheme. Each State has, therefore, to
search and select a dependable manufacturer. It is
submitted that the tender conditions specifically require
the manufacturer to conform to the technical
specifications of high security registration plates. It
should be able to prove existence of requisite financial
resources to integrate a large number of RTOs in the
State on an on-line platform. The manufacturer should
have a permanent technical partner to the venture so that
technology support is assured for the entire period of
contract. The manufacturer to be selected should have
access to the requisite technology and should be in a
position to upgrade, expand and upscale the operation on
a continuous and sustainable basis. It is necessary to
have a long-term contractual relationship so that the
State can fix liability on the manufacturer and make him
answerable for damages or any defects in the registration
plates or for improper implementation of the project. The
requirement of the Rule that registration number and
plates will be issued on the premises of the RTO, is to
maintain secrecy and security. For the above purpose,
selection of one single manufacturer would ensure
security aspects instead of more than one manufacturers
operating from different points.
29. With regard to 15 years’ long-term contract, it is
submitted that it is also in public interest. The
manufacturer who has to stake the money would have to
make huge investment by installing high-technologybased networking at each RTO’s office. A short-term
contract would not, therefore, attract an experienced and
reliable manufacturer. Long-term contracts with a fixed
price for the entire 15 years’ period is beneficial to the
customers as there would be no price increase for the
stipulated period, irrespective of inflation. Fifteen years’
period has been chosen in proportion to the average
roadworthy life of a vehicle in India.
30. Looking to the huge vehicular population of the
country, the capacity of the manufacturer has to be as
165

WP(C) No.10685/2004

great because plates are to be fitted to a very large
number of existing vehicles within the first two years.
Thereafter, every year about one lakh vehicles in each
State would be required to be fitted with the plates. If the
bulk of the contract is exhausted in the first two years,
fresh manufacturers would not come forward to
undertake the remaining work as it would not be costeffective. A long-term contract was necessitated for
various reasons such as necessity of huge investment for
building infrastructure, uninterrupted supply of plates in
the first two years and thereafter every year and the
investment of such infrastructure requiring recovery over
a long duration by way of supply. If the contract period
is lowered, the cost of plate might go up as the huge
investment will have to be recovered in a shorter period.
31. Justifying the selection of a single manufacturer for a
region or an entire State, to ensure security
considerations, the following factors have been
highlighted as subserving the public interest:
1. That it would not be possible to implement the scheme
since the scheme provides that the approved
manufacturer would use the premises of the State RTO
and lay down V-Sat links so that the entire State is
networked on a common platform.
2. It would be impossible for the State to provide all the
TAC-holders space and infrastructure in the RTO
premises.
3. It would be difficult for the State to identify the source
of any counterfeiting in case there are multiple
manufacturers. This would severely compromise the
security considerations involved in the scheme.
4. Different manufacturers would lead to variations in
price between different manufacturers.
5. The State is at a disadvantage since all the
manufacturers would prefer to concentrate on supplying
only in Kolkata and would not go to the other far-flung
RTOs where he would not recover the returns on his
investment.
6. In case more than one manufacturer operates within
the State, it will lead to discrepancy and non-uniformity
in price structure prevailing in different regions.
7. Difficulty in assimilation of data from more than one
166

WP(C) No.10685/2004

manufacturer would lead to disaggregated and confusing
database signals. Such sensitive and security-related
business must be governed by uniform database
management processes and unified standardised coding
practices.
8. Different manufacturers would mean that there would
be variation in quality of the material and in terms of
workmanship.
9. Possible duplication of registration plates due to
competition between manufacturers of different regions
and lack of aggregated security-controlled database
management systems.
10. Non-conformity of data of different manufacturers
would lead to confusion and integration of data from the
State RTOs.
11. Difficulty in fixing up the answerability on any one
manufacturer for not following the prescribed procedure.
12. Confidentiality of the public database would be
severely compromised.
13. Provision of training of RTO personnel by each
manufacturer would be a logistic nightmare and would
lead to confusion and further lead to the system being
compromised severely.
14. It is also important to note that each registration plate
has a unique number, and consequently, all the RTOs are
required to be electronically connected to each other; if
the vendors are allowed to proliferate, this connection
would not be possible, and would lead to complete
chaos.
32. By highlighting the above factors, it is submitted that
if multiple manufacturers are involved in implementation
of the policy, it is not likely to work satisfactorily. It is
submitted that a single selected manufacturer would not
just be marketing, servicing and providing a new product
but would engage in assisting the State in fulfilment of
statutory obligations to grant the high security
registrations to owners of motor vehicles in accordance
with the provisions of the Act and the Rules. It is
submitted that tender conditions are suitably formulated
for
performance
guarantee,
experience
and
understanding of business, financial strength, and
capacity of creating and installing the entire
167

WP(C) No.10685/2004

infrastructure and networking. Finally, it is submitted
that the eligibility criteria prescribed by the State is
commensurate not only with the scale of operation and
size of network to be created by the operator but also
with the statutory requirement of the States’ continued
delivery of its obligations to vehicle-owners without any
interruption. It is contended that through open tender,
identifying and selecting an approved manufacturer to
discharge statutory duty of RTO is not an act of the State
creating any monopoly in favour of any private party.
The grievance of infringement of the fundamental rights
under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution is
misconceived. Reliance is placed on Air India Ltd. v.
Cochin International Airport Ltd. and Asia Foundation
& Construction Ltd. v. Trafalgar House Construction (I)
Ltd.

43. Certain preconditions or qualifications for tenders
have to be laid down to ensure that the contractor has the
capacity and the resources to successfully execute the
work. Article 14 of the Constitution prohibits the
Government from arbitrarily choosing a contractor at its
will and pleasure. It has to act reasonably, fairly and in
public interest in awarding contract. At the same time, no
person can claim a fundamental right to carry on
business with the Government. All that he can claim is
that in competing for the contract, he should not be
unfairly treated and discriminated, to the detriment of
public interest. Undisputedly, the legal position which
has been firmly established from various decisions of
this Court, cited at the Bar (supra) is that government
contracts are highly valuable assets and the court should
be prepared to enforce standards of fairness on the
Government in its dealings with tenderers and
contractors.”
It was in these circumstances that the court held that the process

and selection of the manufacturer did not suffer from arbitrariness and that
there was any violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. It is
certainly not so in the instant case.
193.

In the Association of Registration Plates (supra), the selected
168

WP(C) No.10685/2004

manufacturers had to undertake large scale investments in addition, the
respondent had given an opportunity to other persons to participate in the
tendering process. None of the criterion which were before the Apex Court
in this case are satisfied in the present matter. In the judgment, the Apex
Court also noticed thus :“41.
The fifteen years' contract period has also
been supported by the Union of India and State
authorities.
We find great substance in the
submissions made on the data supplied as a
justification for awarding the contract for a long
period of 15 years. There would be a huge investment
required towards the infrastructure by the selected
manufacturer and the major return would be expected
in initial period of two years although he would be
bound down to render his services for future vehicles
periodically for a long period. Looking to the huge
investment required and the nature of the job which is
most
sophisticated,
requiring
network
and
infrastructure, a long-term contract, if thought viable
and feasible, cannot be faulted by the court. If there
are two alternatives available of giving a short-term or
a long-term contract, it is not for the court to suggest
that the short-term contract should be given. On the
subject of business management, expertise is
available with the State authorities. The policy has
been chalked out and the tender conditions have been
formulated after joint deliberations between
authorities of the State and the intending
manufacturers. A contract providing for technical
expertise, financial capability and experience
qualifications with a long term of 15 years would
serve the dual purpose of attracting sound parties to
stake their money in undertaking the job of supply
and safeguard the public interest by ensuring that for
a long period the work of affixation of security plates
would continue uninterrupted in fulfilment of the
object of the scheme contained in Rule 50. Our
considered opinion, therefore, is that none of the
impugned clauses in the tender conditions can be held
to be arbitrary or discriminatory deserving their
striking down as prayed for on behalf of the
169

WP(C) No.10685/2004

petitioners.
42.
There is no material on record to infer any
mala fide design on the part of the tendering authority
to favour parties having foreign collaborations and to
keep out of the fray indigenous manufacturers. The
high security plate is a sophisticated article - new for
a manufacturer in India. It is being introduced for the
first time under the scheme contained in Rule 50 of
the Rules and the Act. At the time of issuance of
notices of tender, technical know-how for
manufacture of plates and its further development was
undoubtedly outside the country.
Only a few
concerns in India having collaboration with foreign
parties possessed the expertise and were available in
the market. The terms of the notice inviting tender
were formulated after joint deliberations of Central
and State authorities and the available manufacturers
in the field. The terms of the tender prescribing
quantum of turnover of its business and business in
plates with fixation of long-term period of the
contract are said to have been incorporated to ensure
uninterrupted supply of plates to a large number of
existing vehicles within a period of two years and
new vehicles for a long period in the coming years. It
is easy to allege but difficult to accept that terms of
the notices inviting tenders which were fixed after
joint deliberations between State authorities and
intending tenderers were so tailored as to benefit only
a certain identified manufacturers having foreign
collaboration. Merely because a few manufacturers
like the petitioners do not qualify to submit the
tender, being not in a position to satisfy the terms and
conditions laid down, the tender conditions cannot be
held to be discriminatory.”
194.

The judicial pronouncement reported at (2004) 4 SCC 19 Director of

Education & Ors. Vs. Educomp Datamatics Ltd., was placed by the respondent
before this court. Perusal of this judgment shows that even in this case, the

court also recognised the existence and limitations on the power of judicial
review in the matters relating to award of contracts by the Government or its
genuineness.
170

The limitation thereon were reiterated when the court
WP(C) No.10685/2004

observed as follows :“9. It is well settled now that the courts can scrutinise the
award of the contracts by the Government or its agencies
in exercise of their powers of judicial review to prevent
arbitrariness or favouritism. However, there are inherent
limitations in the exercise of the power of judicial review
in such matters. The point as to the extent of judicial
review permissible in contractual matters while inviting
bids by issuing tenders has been examined in depth by
this Court in Tata Cellular v. Union of India. After
examining the entire case-law the following principles
have been deduced: (SCC pp. 687-88, para 94)
“94. The principles deducible from the above are:
(1) The modern trend points to judicial restraint in
administrative action.
(2) The court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely
reviews the manner in which the decision was made.
(3) The court does not have the expertise to correct the
administrative decision. If a review of the administrative
decision is permitted it will be substituting its own
decision, without the necessary expertise which itself
may be fallible.
(4) The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open
to judicial scrutiny because the invitation to tender is in
the realm of contract. Normally speaking, the decision to
accept the tender or award the contract is reached by
process of negotiations through several tiers. More often
than not, such decisions are made qualitatively by
experts.
(5) The Government must have freedom of contract. In
other words, a fair play in the joints is a necessary
concomitant for an administrative body functioning in
an administrative sphere or quasi-administrative sphere.
However, the decision must not only be tested by the
application of Wednesbury principle of reasonableness
(including its other facts pointed out above) but must be
free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated
by mala fides.
(6) Quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative
burden on the administration and lead to increased and
unbudgeted expenditure.”
(emphasis supplied)
In this judgment also, the court recognised that the court would
interfere in judicial review if the decision of the Government was actuated
171

WP(C) No.10685/2004

by mala fide, was arbitrary or discriminatory.
195.

The Apex Court had occasion to consider the nature of a review

by a court when administrative action is challenged before it. The nature of
the challenge and the principles thereof were considered in a judgment
reported at (2001) 2 SCC 386 Om Kumar v. Union of India wherein the
court noticed that the challenge to the action could be either on grounds of
discrimination or on grounds of arbitrariness. The Supreme Court held that
a challenge to the administrative action on the ground of discrimination is
tested on the touchstone of proportionality as a primary review. Here the
courts deals with the balancing act of the administrator as a primary
reviewing authority to consider the correctness of the level of discrimination
applied and whether it is excessive and does it have a nexus with the
objective intended to be achieved by the administrator. However if the
challenge is on grounds of arbitrariness, i.e. as to whether the action of the
administrative authority is rational or reasonable, the courts are then
confined to a secondary role and have to apply the Wednesbury test. In
such role, the courts have to be confined to the secondary role to see
whether the administrator discharged his primary role or not.
In this behalf, the court held thus :“58. Initially, our courts, while testing legislation as well
as administrative action which was challenged as being
discriminatory under Article 14, were examining
whether the classification was discriminatory, in the
sense whether the criteria for differentiation were
intelligible and whether there was a rational relation
between the classification and the object sought to be
achieved by the classification. It is not necessary to give
172

WP(C) No.10685/2004

citation of cases decided by this Court where
administrative action was struck down as being
discriminative. These are numerous.
(ii) Arbitrariness test under Article 14
59. But, in E.P. Royappa v. State of T. N. Bhagwati, J
laid down another test for purposes of Article 14. It was
stated that if the administrative action was “arbitrary”, it
could be struck down under Article 14. This principle is
now uniformly followed in all courts more rigorously
than the one based on classification. Arbitrary action by
the administrator is described as one that is irrational and
not based on sound reason. It is also described as one
that is unreasonable.
(b) If, under Article 14, administrative action is to be
struck down as discriminative, proportionality applies
and it is primary review. If it is held arbitrary,
Wednesbury applies and it is secondary review
xxx

61. When does the court apply, under Article 14, the
proportionality test as a primary reviewing authority and
when does the court apply the Wednesbury rule as a
secondary reviewing authority? From the earlier review
of basic principles, the answer becomes simple. In fact,
we have further guidance in this behalf.
62. In the European Court, it appears that administrative
action can be challenged under Article 14 of the
Convention (corresponding to Article 14 of our
Constitution) as being discriminatory and be tested by
applying the principle of “proportionality”. Prof. Craig
refers to the judgment of the European Court under
Article 14 in Lithgow v. UK as follows:
“The differential treatment must not only pursue a
legitimate aim. It had to be proportionate. There had to
be relationship of proportionality between the means
employed and the aim sought to be realised”
63. Similarly, in the European law, in relation to
173

WP(C) No.10685/2004

discrimination on ground of sex, the principle of
proportionality has been applied and it has been held that
the State has to justify its action. In EU Law and Human
Rights by Lammy Betten and Nicholas Grief, (1998 at p.
98), it is stated:
“If indirect discrimination were established, the
Government would have to show ‘very weighty reasons’
by way of objective justification, bearing in mind that
derogations from fundamental rights must be construed
strictly and in accordance with the principle of
proportionality.” [Johnston v. Chief Constable of the
RUC ECR (para 38.51)].
64. In the context of Article 14 of the English Act, 1998,
(which is similar to our Article 14) Prof. Craig refers to
the above principle. (See Administrative Law, Craig 4th
Edn. 1999, p. 652.) Thus, it would appear that under
Article 14 of the European Convention, principle of
proportionality is invoked where questions of
discrimination are involved and the court is a primary
reviewing authority. According to Prof. Craig, this is
likely to be the position under Article 14 of the English
Act, 1998.
xxx

66. It is clear from the above discussion that in India
where administrative action is challenged under Article
14 as being discriminatory, equals are treated unequally
or unequals are treated equally, the question is for the
Constitutional Courts as primary reviewing courts to
consider correctness of the level of discrimination
applied and whether it is excessive and whether it has a
nexus with the objective intended to be achieved by the
administrator. Here the court deals with the merits of the
balancing action of the administrator and is, in essence,
applying “proportionality” and is a primary reviewing
authority.
67. But where an administrative action is challenged as
“arbitrary” under Article 14 on the basis of Royappa (as
in cases where punishments in disciplinary cases are
challenged), the question will be whether the
administrative order is “rational” or “reasonable” and the
174

WP(C) No.10685/2004

test then is the Wednesbury test. The courts would then
be confined only to a secondary role and will only have
to see whether the administrator has done well in his
primary role, whether he has acted illegally or has
omitted relevant factors from consideration or has taken
irrelevant factors into consideration or whether his view
is one which no reasonable person could have taken. If
his action does not satisfy these rules, it is to be treated
as arbitrary. [In G.B. Mahajan v. Jalgaon Municipal
Council (SCC at p. 111).] Venkatachaliah, J. (as he then
was) pointed out that “reasonableness” of the
administrator under Article 14 in the context of
administrative law has to be judged from the stand point
of Wednesbury rules. In Tata Cellular v. Union of India
(SCC at pp. 679-80), Indian Express Newspapers
Bombay (P) Ltd. v. Union of India (SCC at p. 691),
Supreme Court Employees’ Welfare Assn. v. Union of
India (SCC at p. 241) and U.P. Financial Corpn. v. Gem
Cap (India) (P). Ltd. (SCC at p. 307) while judging
whether the administrative action is “arbitrary” under
Article 14 (i.e. otherwise then being discriminatory), this
Court has confined itself to a Wednesbury review
always.
68. Thus, when administrative action is attacked as
discriminatory under Article 14, the principle of primary
review is for the courts by applying proportionality.
However, where administrative action is questioned as
“arbitrary” under Article 14, the principle of secondary
review based on Wednesbury principles applies.”
Thus, the action of an authority may be challenged on grounds of
discrimination, intelligible criterion and purpose sought to be achieved. If
these fail, then the challenge to the action would lie on ground of
arbitrariness.

The last challenge would be on the test of Wednesbury

reasonableness.
196.

Article 226 of the Constitution provides for the power of the

High Courts to issue certain writs. It enables the High Court to issue to any
person or authority (including in appropriate cases any govt) orders or writs

175

WP(C) No.10685/2004

for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by part 3 of the
constitution and “for any other purpose” i.e. for the enforcement of any
other legal right. Thus, all the High Courts have very wide powers under
Article 226 and these powers confer discretion of a most extensive nature
on the High Courts.
The scope of this article has been explained by Subba Rao, J., in
(1965) 3 SCR 536 Dwarkanath v. ITO thus :-

197.

“This article is couched in comprehensive
phraseology and it exfacie confers a wide powers on the
High Courts to reach injustice wherever it is found. The
Constitution designedly used a wide language in
describing the nature of the power, the purpose for which
and the person or authority against whom it can be
exercised. It can issue writs in the nature of prerogative
writs as understood in England; but the scope of those
writs also is widened by the use of the expression
“nature”, for the said expression does not equate the writs
that can be issued in India with those in England, but only
draws an analogy from them. That apart, High Courts can
also issue directions, orders or writs other than the
prerogative writs. It enables the High Court to mould the
reliefs to meet the peculiar and complicated requirements
of this country. Any attempt to equate the scope of the
power of the High Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution with that of the English courts to issue
prerogative writs is to introduce the unnecessary
procedural restrictions grown over the years in a
comparatively small country like England with a unitary
form of government into a vast country like India
functioning under a federal structure.
Such a
construction defeats the purpose of the article itself.”
The scope of proceedings before the writ court also fell for

consideration before the Apex Court in 1966 II Company Law Journal 151
(at page 157), Barium Chemicals Limited and Anr. v. The Company Law
Board & Ors., the court held thus :-

176

WP(C) No.10685/2004

198.

“In our opinion in a proceeding under Article 226 of
the Constitution the normal rule is , as pointed out by
this Court in The State of Bombay v. Purshottam Jog
Naik, to decide disputed questions on the basis of
affidavits and that it is within the discretion of the High
Court whether to allow a person who has sworn an
affidavit before it-as indeed Mr.Krishnamachari and
Mr.Dutt have-to be cross-examined or not to permit it.
In exercise of its discretion the High Court has refused
permission to cross-examine them. In such a case it
would not be appropriate for this Court while hearing
an appeal by Special Leave to interfere lightly with the
exercise of that discretion.”
In (1969) 3 SCC 769 Smt. Gunwant Kaur & Ors. v. Municipal

Committee, Bhatinda & Ors., the Supreme Court held that the High Court
is not deprived of its jurisdiction to entertain a petition under Article 226
merely because in considering the petitioner's right to relief, disputed
questions of fact may fall to be determined. In a petition under Article 226,
the High Court has jurisdiction to try issues, both of fact and law. The
exercise of the jurisdiction is, it is true, discriminatory but the discretion
must be exercised on sound judicial principles.
199.

These judgments were cited with approval in a recent

pronouncement of the Apex Court reported in 109(2004) DLT 415 (SC)
ABL International Ltd. v. Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India
Ltd. & Ors. wherein the court held thus :“17.
The above judgment of Smt.Gunwant Kaur
(supra), finds support from another judgment of this Court
in the case of Century Spinning and Manufacturing
Company Ltd. and Anr. v. The Ulhasnagar Municipal
Council and Anr., 1970(1) SCC 582, wherein this Court
held:
“Merely because a question of fact is raised,
the High Court will not be justified in
177

WP(C) No.10685/2004

requiring the party to seek relief by the
somewhat lengthy, dilatory and expensive
process by a civil suit against a public body.
The questions of fact raised by the petition in
this case are elementary.”
18.
This observation of the Court was made while
negating a contention advanced on behalf of the
respondent-Municipality which contended that the petition
filed by the appellant-company therein apparently raised
questions of fact which argument of the Municipality was
accepted by the High Court holding that such disputed
question of fact cannot be tried in the exercise of the
extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution. But this Court held otherwise.
19.
Therefore, it is clear from the above
enunciation of law that merely because one of the parties
to the litigation raises a dispute in regard to the facts of
the case, the Court entertaining such petition under Article
226 of the Constitution is not always bound to relegate the
parties to a suit. In the above case of Smt.Gunwant Kaur
(supra), this Court even went to the extent of holding that
in a writ petition, if facts required, even oral evidence can
be taken. This clearly shows that in an appropriate case,
the writ Court has the jurisdiction to entertain a Writ
petition involving disputed questions of fact and there is
no absolute bar for entertaining a writ petition even if the
same arises out of a contractual obligation and/or involves
some disputed questions of fact.”
Policy decision not amenable to Judicial Review
200.

It has been argued by Mr. P.N. Lekhi, learned senior counsel that

the decision to allot the CTCs to Sulabh was a policy decision which was
not amenable to judicial review. My attention has been drawn to 115 L. Ed.
2D 410, 438 wherein“Policy” is defined as “define course or method
selected (as by a Government institution, group or individual) from among
alternatives and in the light of given conditions to meet and usually
determine present and future decisions”.
201.

The Supreme Court was called upon to consider the industrial
178

WP(C) No.10685/2004

policy of 1979 in its judgment M.P.Oil Extraction vs. State of M.P 1997(7)
SCC 592. In para 41 at page 610, the Apex Court held that the executive
authority of the State must be held to be within its competence to frame a
policy for the administration of the State. Unless the policy framed is
absolutely capricious and not being informed by any reason whatsoever, can
be clearly held to be arbitrary and founded on the mere ipse dixit of the
executive functionaries thereby offending Article 14 of the Constitution or

other constitutional provisions or comes into conflict with any statutory
provision, the Court cannot and should not out step its limit and tinker with
the policy decision. The caution and restraint in exercise of the power of
judicial review by the Courts was reiterated so that the supremacy of three
organs of the State i.e. the legislature, executive and the judiciary in their
respective areas of operation is maintained.
202.

It is settled law that Courts are not experts in policy and public

administration and hence should not step beyond their institutional capacity.
In 2004(1) SCC 15(para 31) Union of India vs. S.P.Vohra, the court again
emphasised the need for restraint. It was observed that it is if courts step
out side the area of their institutional competence, the Government may
react by getting the Parliament to legislate to oust the jurisdiction of the
courts altogether.
203.

Strong reliance was placed on the decision of the Apex Court in

AIR 2002 SC 350 Balco Employees Union v. Union of India. There can

179

WP(C) No.10685/2004

be no dispute that the proposition of law laid down binds this court. I find
that the Apex Court also drew a distinction between a policy decision which
formed the economic policy of the country to disinvest from certain public
sector undertakings which was implemented by the Government and the
decision taken pursuant to such policy.

It was an exercise of its

administrative power to effectuate such economic policy which resulted in
the decision to disinvest in Balco.
204.

In the instant case the MCD had evolved a policy of requiring

NGOs to assist it in the operation and maintenance of the CTCs and
administrative decisions were taken as to the manner in which these
obligatory functions were to be assigned to these NGOs. The MCD took the
decision not to maintain or operate the CTCs by itself. This decision on its
part is the decision which falls clearly in the realm of “policy” making by
the Corporation. This part of MCD's decision is akin to the policy decision
of the Government of India to disinvest from certain public sector
undertakings.
Having so decided, the MCD took several decisions including
the decision to initially award CTCs to such NGOs by entering into 30 year
contracts and then decided to allot the CTCs by auctioning the same and
awarding the same by contracts for three years period to different NGOs. It
is the last decision taken by MCD to withdraw all the CTCs from all the
NGOs and to assign the same to the only one NGO i.e. SISSO which has
been impugned before this Court.

180

WP(C) No.10685/2004

In my view, the judgment of the Apex Court in Balco's case
(supra) is of no assistance. The MCD had taken a decision not to operate
and maintain the CTCs by itself but to contract them out to provide
operators i.e. the NGOs. It is this decision which would constitute a policy
decision. This decision is not in challenge in these writ petitions. It is the
decision taken pursuant to such policy, to withdraw the CTCs from different
private parties i.e. several NGOs and to award the same to only one NGO
i.e. Sulabh which is in issue. Such decision is clearly outside the realm of
policy making.
There is no dispute with the proposition that courts are not expert
in matters of policy or public administration and should not step beyond
their institutional capacity and it needs no elaboration. In my view, there is
no challenge in these writ petitions on any such ground which could be
considered as an attempt to tinker with any policy of the authorities.
205.

Thus, the legal position in regard to the maintainability of writ

petitions under Article 226 despite availability of an alternative remedy and
in contractual matters or on the ground that it lays a challenge to a policy
decision is no longer res integra as has been concisely stated in the aforenoticed decisions where the law laid down emerges as follows:(i)Rule of exclusion of writ jurisdiction by availability of an alternative
remedy is a rule of discretion and not one of compulsion.
(ii)Rule that the party who applies for the issue of a writ should, before he
approaches the Court, have exhausted other remedies open to him under the

181

WP(C) No.10685/2004

law, is not a rule which bars the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain
the petition, but is a rule which Courts have laid down for the exercise of
their discretion.
(iii)In spite of availability of the alternative remedy, the High Court may
still exercise its writ jurisdiction in at least three contingencies:
(a)Where the writ petition seeks enforcement of any of the
fundamental rights:
(b)Where there is failure of principles of natural justice; or
(c)Where the orders of proceedings are wholly without
jurisdiction of the vires of an Act is challenged.
(iv)The requirement of Article 14 being the duty to act fairly, justly and
reasonably, there is nothing that militates against the concept of requiring
the State always to so act, even in contractual matters. There is no reason
why the requirement of Article 14 should not extend even in the sphere of
contractual matters for regulating the conduct of the State activity.
(v)If a State acts in an arbitrary manner even in a matter of contract or is a
policy decision, an aggrieved party can approach the court by way of writ
under Article 226 of the Constitution and the court depending on facts of
the said case is empowered to grant the relief.
(vi)Merely because the source of the right which the respondent claims was
initially in a contract, does not mean that for obtaining relief against any
arbitrary and unlawful action on the part of a public authority he must resort
to a suit and not to a petition by way of a writ.

182

WP(C) No.10685/2004

(vii)Once the State or an instrumentality of the State is a party of the
contract, it has an obligation in law to act fairly, justly and reasonably,
which is the requirement of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
Therefore in case of contravention of Article 14 a writ court can
issue suitable directions to set right the arbitrary actions.
(viii).

So far as the objection as to the maintainability of the instant writ

petition on the ground of availability of an alternative remedy is concerned,
it is well settled that diverting a party to an alternative remedy is a rule of
convenience and is not an absolute power to the maintainability of the writ
petition.
206.

In the present case the petitioners have challenged the decisions

and action of the MCD on grounds of discrimination as well as on the
grounds that they are arbitrary, unreasonable and in violation of principles
of natural justice.
In my view, therefore, all objections to the maintainability of the
writ petition on the grounds of availability of an alternative remedy; that the
same relate to contractual disputes or for the reason that they raise disputed
questions of fact must fail.
207.

Before this court, on behalf of the petitioners, Mr. Jayant

Bhushan, senior advocate has contended that the case raises two aspects.
The first relates to cancellation of the contracts of the NGOs while the
second related to award of the same to Sulabh International. These two
issues are inseparably and inextricably linked. A decision to rescind the

183

WP(C) No.10685/2004

contracts of the petitioner and award the same to Sulabh was a composite
one and no challenge can be laid to the second issue without challenging the
first.
208.

Both parties have placed strong reliance on the landmark

pronouncement in Associated Provincial pictures vs Wednesbury
Corporation reported at 1947 All England Report 680.
The principles laid down in this judgment have been followed in
several pronouncements of the Supreme Court.

The oft cited

pronouncement and most relied judgment of the Supreme Court in this
behalf has been reported at 1994(6) SCC 651 entitled Tata Cellular vs.
Union of India which has been noticed hereinabove.
209.

It is trite therefore that the decision to award contracts by the

state and statutory authority are subject to judicial review. The parameters
of judicial review are, however, narrow. The decision must be free from the
vice of discrimination and malafide and must be just, fair and reasonable.
The decision would be tested on the principles of Wednesbury
unreasonableness. The decision making process would require to withstand
judicial scrutiny. The decision must be based on relevant criterion, rational
considerations and not on any extraneous considerations.
However, there is no absolute prohibition as has been urged on
behalf of the respondents before this court to judicial scrutiny of a policy
decision or to award of a contract by the state or the statutory authority.
Whether the action of the MCD in allotting CTCs amounted to

184

WP(C) No.10685/2004

dispensation of largesee?
210.

An objection has been taken by Mr. P.N. Lekhi, learned senior

counsel, that construction, operation and maintenance of CTCs was an
obligatory function of the MCD and hence their allotment was not
dispensation of largesse. It is urged that, therefore, the decisions of MCD
could not be tested on the tests laid down for violation of Article 14 or on
ground of unreasonableness.
211.

The expression “largesse” is not defined by any statute. The

same has been used in connection with dispensation of several kinds by the
Government and by statutory authorities.
212.

As per 'The New Oxford American Dictionary'

the word

'largesse' has been defined as “generosity in bestowing money or gifts upon
others; money or gifts given generously”
In Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary 'largesse' means “liberal
giving to or as if to an inferior; excessive or ostentatious gratitutes; an
inmate generosity of mind or spirit”
In Chamber's Dictionary 'largesse' is defined as “bestowal or
distibution of gifts; generosity”
In New Websters Dictionary and Thesaurus 'largesse' means “the
giving of bounty by a suprerior to an inferior; generosity on a big scale”
Wikepedia Encyclopedia online defines 'largesse' as “liberality in
bestowing gifts, especially in a lofty or condescending manner; generosity
of spirit or attitude”

185

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Rogets The New Thesaurus defines 'largesse' as “a

material

favour or gift, usually money, given in return for service”
Mr. Lekhi, learned senior counsel, has pointed out that “largesse”
is defined as “bountifulness, munifesence”
213.

Some light is thrown as to what would constitute largesse in the

observations of the Apex Court in various pronouncements. In (2005) 1
SCC 679 Association of Registration Plates Manufacturers v. Union of
India, while observing on the contemplated contract observed that “it is just
like selection of an appropriate person for award of a contract or largesse by
the state on laid down criteria of experience and technical qualifications.”
214.

In (1979) 3 SCC 489 Ramanna Daya Ram Shetty v.

International Airport Authority of India, the Apex Court held thus :“11. Today the Government in a welfare State, is the
regulator and dispenser of special services and provider
of a large number of benefits, including jobs, contracts,
licences, quotas, mineral rights, etc. The Government
pours forth wealth, money, benefits, services, contracts,
quotas and licences. The valuables dispensed by
Government take many forms, but they all share one
characteristic. They are steadily taking the place of
traditional forms of wealth.
These valuables which derive from relationships to
Government are of many kinds. They comprise social
security benefits, cash grants for political sufferers and
the whole scheme of State and local welfare. Then again,
thousands of people are employed in the State and the
Central Governments and local authorities. Licences are
required before one can engage in many kinds of
businesses or work. The power of giving licences means
power to withhold them and this gives control to the
Government or to the agents of Government on the lives
of many people. Many individuals and many more
businesses enjoy largessee in the form of Government
contracts. These contracts often resemble subsidies. It is
186

WP(C) No.10685/2004

virtually impossible to lose money on them and many
enterprises are set up primarily to do business with
Government. Government owns and controls hundreds of
acres of public land valuable for mining and other
purposes. These resources are available for utilisation by
private corporations and individuals by way of lease or
licence. All these mean growth in the Government
largessee and with the increasing magnitude and range of
governmental functions as we move closer to a welfare
State, more and more of our wealth consists of these new
forms. Some of these forms of wealth may be in the
nature of legal rights but the large majority of them are in
the nature of privileges. But on that account, can it be
said that they do not enjoy any legal protection? Can they
be regarded as gratuity furnished by the State so that the
State may withhold, grant or revoke it at its pleasure? Is
the position of the Government in this respect the same
as that of a private giver? We do not think so. The law
has not been slow to recognise the importance of this
new kind of wealth and the need to protect individual
interest in it and with that end in view, it has developed
new forms of protection. Some interests in Government
largesse, formerly regarded as privileges, have been
recognised as rights while others have been given legal
protection not only by forging procedural safeguards but
also by confining/structuring and checking Government
discretion in the matter of grant of such largesse.”
215.

In this country, the involvement of the state and the statutory

authorities is all pervasive. The same is to be found in areas imperative for
development of the community which include infrastructure as roads,
highways, tele-communications etc as also in areas of health, education etc.
Contracts running into huge amounts are awarded by the Government and
authorities.
216.

Therefore even grant of largesse as munifescence on the part of

the State as has been urged by Mr. P.N. Lekhi, learned senior counsel
however the grounds thereof would have to satisfy the test of non187

WP(C) No.10685/2004

arbitrariness, non-discrimination and reasoning and its award can only be by
the procedure which is just and fair.
217.

In the instant case, undoubtedly while providing the facility of

the CTCs may be these prime reason for construction of these CTCs and
provision of the facilities, however, the MCD itself had carved out an area
where it could expect to generate and make reasonable profits which was by
advertisement on the CTCs. Apart from such a source of revenue, the MCD
was aware and had generated funds from the usercharges even while
running the CTCs on a `no profit no loss basis'. Conscious of such source,
MCD had permitted Sulabh the right to periodically enhance these charges
of the CTCs. The MCD itself had given a go by to the decision of the
Standing Committee that the CTCs should be permitted to be used on a free
of charge basis while permitting Sulabh to charge for the same.
Consequently, the submission that allotment of the CTCs was
not in the nature of dispensation of largesse by the MCD and that it could
deal with it in its absolute discretion therefore has to be rejected.
218.

The CTCs are public property urged to have been constructed in

discharge of an obligation, statutory duty. The same are to be alloted by
MCD to private parties, that is, the NGOs.
219.

Therefore, it cannot possibly be urged that award of such

contracts, because they include an element of essentials in society are not
dispensation of largesse by the authorities. This is more so, as has been
pointed out by Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel that where many

188

WP(C) No.10685/2004

parties are interested in undertaking the work and some method of selection
is to be adopted to select one or several persons from amongst those
interested in doing the duty and function of the corporation, there is a huge
element of profits and revenue in the nature of advertising rights.
220.

Grave responsibility is conferred on an authority which is

administering public money. Certainly, the revenue which is generated and
enured to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi is public money. In the light
of the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the ONGC matter, it is
evident that the MCD is bound to multiply generation of its revenue which
is utilized for the social and public justice and good and such funds have to
be expended carefully. The MCD was bound to take into consideration the
amounts which it was earning from the licence fee from the existing
arrangement with the NGOs including the petitioners.
221.

It was equally important for it to consider the revenues which

could have been generated from the advertisements which it could permit on
the CTCs. It would be useful to advert to the following passage in Wade's
Administrative Law (6th Edition) Page 426 wherein the learned author says:“.....The idea that runs through these cases is that public
money must be administered with responsibility and
without extravagance. This appears to mean that it is not
available for charity.
The generosity of local authorities, in particular, is
restrained by the doctrine that they owe a fiduciary duty
to their ratepayers analogous to that of trustees. This
means that, in deciding upon the expenditure, they must
hold a balance fairly between the recipients of the
benefit and the ratepayers who have to bear the costs.”
222.

At this stage, it is necessary to notice the contradiction in the
189

WP(C) No.10685/2004

stand taken by MCD before this court. W.P.(C) NO.16106/2004 was filed
by Urbo Rural Integrated Development v. MCD and
16108/2004 was filed by Rural Development Environment.

W.P.(C) No.
It is pointed

out that these petitioners were allotted CTCs to operate and maintain them
under the thirty year contracts which commenced from different dates in
1993 and therefore would end in or around the year 2018. No licence fee
was payable by the NGOs who were operating and maintaining these CTCs
and consequently there was no question of any default by these persons.
These CTCs were also constructed by the MCD and no complaint
whatsoever have been made by any of the user.

No illegality by the

petitioner in working these contracts was brought to the notice of any
authority and there was no material to this effect before either the
Commissioner or any of the authorities who took the decision noticed
herein.
223.

In these proceedings, on a statement made behalf of MCD, the

following orders were recorded on 9th March, 2005 :“Learned senior counsel for the respondents on
instructions submitted that so far no action has been
taken or is proposed against the petitioner in this
petition. It is submitted that in the event of the
respondents contemplating any action against the
petitioner, it shall act in accordance with the terms of the
contract between the parties and in accordance with law.
It is, therefore, submitted that the
apprehension of the petitioner that the MCD can take
coercive measures or withdraw the CTC allotted to the
petitioner is without basis.
In view of the statement made by the
respondents, counsel for the petitioner does not press
this petition.
190

WP(C) No.10685/2004

The petition is, accordingly, dismissed as
withdrawn. It shall be open to the petitioner to impugn
any action taken by the respondents against it, if it is
aggrieved in future, in accordance with law.”
Again on 22nd August, 2005, the following statement made on

224.

behalf of MCD in the remaining petitions:“Learned counsel for the respondent/MCD, on
instructions, submits that so far as NGOs, who have been
awarded CTCs for 30 years are concerned, MCD does not
propose to take action till the expiry of this period. It is
further submitted that the event of the respondents
contemplating any action against the NGO, it shall act in
accordance with the terms of the contract between the
parties and in accordance with law. It is, therefore,
submitted that the apprehension of such NGOs that the
MCD can take coercive measures or withdraw the CTC
allotted to them is without basis. Needless to say it shall
be open to NGO concerned to impugn any action taken by
the respondents against it, if it is aggrieved thereby in
future, in accordance with law.”
225.

It is noteworthy that in the answer given by MCD to a query by

Mr. Vijendra Gupta, member of the Sub-committee, the reason given by
MCD for effecting repairs was that certain complexes were more than 15-20
years old and hence required repairs.
Before this court, in answer to the challenge of cancellation of
their contract which was for 30 years by the petitioners in W.P.(C)
NO.16106/2004 Urbo Rural Integrated Development & W.P.(C) No.
16108/2004, the MCD has urged that it did not propose to cancel these
contracts.
The petitioners point out that though these statements have been
made in court however the decisions taken by MCD have not been varied or
modified and no decision by a competent authority modifying the impugned
191

WP(C) No.10685/2004

decisions has been placed before this court.
Thus a mutually destructive and contradictory stand has been
adopted by the MCD. Just as adhoc and piecemeal measures have been
taken, self defeating pleas have been advanced to serve the purpose of the
moment.
226.

Both Mr. V.P. Choudhary and Mr. Jayant Bhushan,

learned

senior counsels representing some of the writ petitioners before this court
have submitted that actually the decision already stood taken by the MCD
on 3rd January, 2004, the scope whereof was widened on 30 th April, 2004.
These decisions crystalised in the letter dated 19th July, 2004 written by the
Commissioner, MCD and even the terms and conditions on which Sulabh
International Social Service Organisation was to take over the operation and
maintenance of the CTCs had been arrived at and a Memorandum of
Understanding drawn up. It is only reasons to support these decisions which
were carved out in the later action of the MCD after the writ petitions were
filed. Thus, though the MCD may appear to have technically complied with
the prescribed procedure in decision making, however the decision was
clearly already taken before such procedure followed.
227.

Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for the

petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos. 7855/2005 & 8067/2005, has also urged that in
the instant case, the decision to award the CTCs to Sulabh was not taken
because the NGOs had committed breaches of any agreement. On the other
hand, it was because the MCD had decided to award the CTCs to Sulabh

192

WP(C) No.10685/2004

that the contracts with the NGO were cancelled. In this behalf, it is urged
that the decision of the MCD to rescind the agreement with the petitioners
and cancel the same is in violation of not only the terms of the contract
which provided a notice but is also in violation of the principles of natural
justice inasmuch as grave allegations having been levelled against the
petitioners without giving them an opportunity to meet the same.
Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the Apex Court in
(1974) 4 SCC 3 E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu it is urged that the
MCD cannot act at its whim and caprice. In fact the petitioners were
entitled to an equal opportunity to operate and maintain the CTCs on the
terms as those on which the same have been offered to Sulabh. Thereby, the
MCD has denied the petitioners the right to consideration for the award of
work without consideration of the expertise and capability.
Whether the MCD could have allotted the CTCs without adopting an
open competitive process
228.

The petitioners have assailed the action of the respondents on

grounds of unfairness and unreasonableness for the reason that the MCD
did not adopt the accepted method of allocation of the CTCs by open
competitive bidding.

However, justifying the action on behalf of the

respondents, both the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Sulabh
International have contended that failure to call a public tender before
allocating all the CTCs of Sulabh International does not invalidate the
action of the MCD and that an authority is adequately empowered to not

193

WP(C) No.10685/2004

call public tenders in a given case. It has been contended that the CTCs
were required to be urgently operated and maintained efficiently and the
decision to allot the CTCs to Sulabh without open tendering was wholly in
public interest. Several pronouncements of the Apex Court have been relied
upon in support of this contention which deserve to be noticed.
229.

Strong reliance was placed by learned senior counsel for the

respondents on the principles laid down by the Apex Court as back as in
(1980) 4 SCC 1 M/s Kasturilal Laxmi Reddy represented by its official
Shri Kasturilal v State of Jammu and Kashmir and Anr. In this case, the
Government of Jammu and Kashmir by its impugned order awarded a
contract to the second respondents for tapping of 10 to 12 blazes annually
for extract of resin from inaccessible chir forests in the state for a period of
10 years. In accordance with the Government policy of industrialisation of
the State, it was agreed upon that a part of the resin so extracted would be
delivered to the state for running a state owned industry and the rest would
be retained by the second respondents for establishing and running of its
own factory in the state. There was a prohibition on the second respondent
that the extracted resin which was allowed to remain with them shall be
utilised only in the plant set up by them in the state and shall not be
removed outside the state. There were other restrictions which were of
benefit to the state including a clause for delivery of the resin to the state
factory, no transportation charges were allowed. The order placed on the
second respondent was the subject matter of the Supreme Court under

194

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Article 32 of the Constitution. The Court rejected the following challenge :“ 9.
There were in the main three grounds on
which the validity of the order was assailed on behalf
of the petitioners. They were as follows :
(A)
That the order is arbitrary, mala
fide and not in public interest, inasmuch as a huge
benefit has been conferred on the 2nd respondents at
the cost of the State.
(B)
The order creates monopoly in
favour of the 2nd respondents who are a private party
and constitutes unreasonable restriction on the right of
the petitioners to carry on tapping contract business
under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution.
(C)
The State has acted arbitrarily in
selecting the 2nd respondents for awarding tapping
contract, without affording any opportunity to others to
compete for obtaining such contract and this action of
the State is not based on any rational or relevant
principle and is, therefore, violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution as also of the rule of administrative law
which inhibits arbitrary action by the State.
We shall examine these grounds in the order
in which we have set them out, but, before we do so,
we may preface what we have to say by making a few
preliminary observations in regard to the law on the
subject.
xxxx
230.

xxxx

In this judgment, the Apex Court examined the entire case law

on the subject including the principles laid down in the Ramanna Daya Ram
Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India (supra). It was noticed
that with the growth of the welfare state, new forms of property in the shape
of Government largessee are developing since the Government was
increasingly assuming the role of regulator and dispenser of social services
and proprietor of a large number of benefits which included contracts,
licences etc and that more and more of our wealth consists of these new
firms of property in order to protect recognised the importance of this new
kind of wealth that new forms of protection have been evolved. Some
interest in Government largessee, which were formerly regarded as
privileges, have been recognised as rights, while others have been given
195

WP(C) No.10685/2004

legal protection not only by forging procedural safeguards, also by
confining, structuring and checking government discretion in the matter of
grant of such largess. It was held that the limitation which structures and
control the discretion of the government in regard to grant of largesse by it
is in the terms at which the largesse may be granted and the other is in
regard to the person who may be recipients of such largesse.
As regards the first limitation, it is imperative that if the
government awards a contract or leases out or otherwise deals with its
property or grants any other largesse, it would be liable to be tested for the
validity of its action on the touchstone of reasonableness and public interest
and if it fails to satisfy either test, it would be unconstitutional and invalid.
The state action can arbitrarily capriciously or in an unprincipled manner.
Thus, though ordinarily, a private individual would be guided by
economic considerations of self gain in any action taken by him, it is always
open to him under the law to act contrary to his self interest or to oblige
another in entering into a contract or dealing with his property. But the
Government is certainly not free to and as it likes in granting largesse such
as awarding a contract. It has thus been repeatedly held that whatever be its
activity, the government is still the government and is subject to restraints
inherent in its position. An award of a contract by a government would be
liable to be tested for its validity on the touchstone of unreasonableness and
pubic interest and if it fails to satisfy either test, it would be unconstitutional
and invalid.

196

WP(C) No.10685/2004

So far as the concept of reasonableness is concerned, it was laid
down by the Apex Court that the interaction of Article 14, 19 and 21 shows
that the requirement of reasonableness runs like a golden thread through the
entire fabric of fundamental rights in the constitution.
The directive principles concretise and give shape to the concept
of unreasonableness envisaged under Article 14, 19 and 21 and other
articles enumerating the fundamental rights.

Any action taken by the

Government with a view to giving effect to anyone or more of the directive
principles would ordinarily, subject to any constitutional or legal inhibitions
or other overriding considerations, qualify for being regarded as
unreasonable while an action which is inconsistent with or runs counter to a
directive principle would

prima facie incur the reproach of being

unreasonable.
231.

So far as the concept of public interest is concerned, the Apex

Court clearly stated in principle that it must, as far as possible receive its
orientation from the directive principles. If, therefore, any governmental
action is calculated to implement or give effect to a directive principle, it
would ordinarily, subject to any other overriding considerations be equated
with public interest.
“14.
Where any governmental action fails to
satisfy the test of reasonableness and public interest
discussed above and is found to be wanting in the
quality of reasonableness or lacking in the element of
public interest, it would be liable to be struck down as
invalid. It must follow as a necessary corollary from
this proposition that the government cannot act in a
manner which would benefit a private party at the cost
of the State; such an action would be both unreasonable
and contrary to public interest. The government,
therefore, cannot, for example, give a contract or sell or
197

WP(C) No.10685/2004

lease out its property for a consideration less than the
highest that can be obtained for it, unless of course
there are other considerations which render it
reasonable and in public interest to do so. such
considerations may be that some directive principle is
sought to be advanced or implemented or that the
contract or the property is given not with a view to
earning revenue but for the purpose of carrying ut a
welfare scheme for the benefit of a particular group or
section of people deserving it or that the person who
has offered a higher consideration is not otherwise fit to
be given the contract or the property. We have referred
to these considerations only illustratively, for there may
be an infinite variety of considerations which may have
to be taken into account by the government in
formulating its policies and it is on a total evaluation of
various considerations which have weighed with the
government in taking a particular action, that the court
would have to decide whether the action of the
government is reasonable and in public interest. But
one basic principle which must guide the court in
arriving at its determination on this question is that
there is always a presumption that the governmental
action is reasonable and in public interest and it is for
the party challenging its validity to show that it is
wanting in reasonableness or is not informed with
public interest. This burden is a heavy one and it has to
be discharged to the satisfaction of the court by proper
and adequate material. The court cannot lightly assume
that the action taken by the government is unreasonable
or without public interest because, as we said above,
,there are a large number of policy considerations
which must necessarily weigh with the government jin
taking action and therefore the court would not strike
down governmental action as invalid on this ground,
unless it is clearly satisfied that the action is
unreasonable or not in public interest. But there it is so
satisfied, it would be the plainest duty of the court
under the Constitution to invalidate the governmental
action. This is one of the ;most important functions of
the court and also one of the most essential for
preservation of the rule of law. It is imperative in a
democracy governed by the rule of law that
governmental action must be kept within the limits of
the law and if there is any transgression, the court must
be ready to condemn it. It is a matter of more and more
powers and since it is not an uncommon phenomenon
in some countries that the legislative check is getting
diluted, it is left to the court as the only other reviewing
authority ;under the Constitution to be increasingly
vigilant to ensure observance with the rule of law and
in this task, the court must not flinch or falter. It may
be pointed out that this ground of invalidity, namely,
that the governmental action is unreasonable or lacking
in the quality of public interest, is different from that of
mala fides though it may, in a given case, furnish
evidence of mala fides.
15.
The second limitation on the discretion of
the government in grant of largesse is in regard to the
persons to whom such largesse may be granted. It is
now well settled as a result of the decision of this Court
in Ramana D. Shetty v. International Airport Authority
of India, that the government is not Shetty v.
198

WP(C) No.10685/2004

International Airport Authority of India, that the
government is not free like an ordinary individual, in
selecting the recipients for its largesse and it cannot
choose to deal with any person it pleases in its absolute
and unfettered discretion. The law is now well
established that the government need not deal with
anyone, but if it does so, it must do so fairly without
discrimination and without unfair procedure. Where
the government is dealing with the public whether by
way of giving jobs or entering into contracts or
granting other forms of largesse, the government
cannot act arbitrarily at its sweet will and, like a private
individual, deal with any person it pleases, but its
action must be in conformity with some standard or
norm which is not arbitrary, irrational or irrelevant.
The governmental action must not be arbitrary or
capricious, but must be based on some principle which
meets the test of reason and relevance. This rule was
enunciated by the court as a rule of administrative law
and it was also validated by the court as an emanation
flowing directly from the doctrine of equality embodied
in Article 14. The court referred to the activist
magnitude of Article 14 as evolved in E.P. Royappa v.
State of Tamil Nadu and Maneka Gandhi case and
observed that it must follow as a necessary corollary
from the principle of equality enshrined in Article 14
that though the State is entitled to refuse to enter into
relationship with anyone, yet if it does so, it cannot
arbitrarily choose any person it likes for entering into
such relationship and discriminate between persons
similarly circumstanced, but it must act in conformity
with some standard or principle which meets that test
of reasonableness and non-discrimination and any
departure from such standard or principle would be
invalid unless it can be supported or justified on some
rational and non-discriminatory ground. (SCC p. 512,
para 21)
This decision has reaffirmed the principle of
reasonableness and non-arbitrariness in governmental
action which lies at the core of our entire constitutional
scheme and structure.

232.

In this background the Apex Court considered the reasons

disclosed by the State for passing the impugned order thus :19.
It is clear from the backdrop of the facts and
circumstances in which the impugned Order came to be
made and the terms and conditions set out in the
impugned Order that it was not a tapping contract
simpliciter which was intended to be given tot he
second respondents. The second respondents wanted to
be assured of regular supply of raw material in the
shape of resin before they could decide to set up a
factory within the State and it was for the purpose of
ensuring supply of such raw material that the impugned
Order was made giving tapping contract to the second
respondents. It was really by way of allocation of raw
material for running the factory that the impugned
Order was passed. The terms of the impugned Order
199

WP(C) No.10685/2004

show beyond doubt that the second respondents were
under an obligation to set up a factory within the State
and that 3500 metric tonnes of resin which was
permitted to be retained by the second respondents out
of the resin extracted by them was required to be
utilised in the factory to be set up by them and it was
provided that no part of the resin extracted should be
allowed to be re3moved outside the4 States. The whole
object of the impugned Order was to make available
3500 metric tonnes of resin to the second respondents
for the purpose of running the factory to be set up by
them. The advantage to the State was that a new
factory for manufacture of rosin, turpentine oil and
other derivatives would come up within its territories
offering more job opportunities to the people of the
Stat4e increasing their prosperity and augmenting the
State revenues and in addition the State would be
assured of a definite supply of at least 1500 metric
tonnes of resin for itself without any financial
involvement or risk and with this additional quantity of
resin available to it, it would be able to set up another
factory creating more employment opportunities and, in
fact, as the counter affidavit of Ghulam Rasul, UnderSecretary to the Government filed on behalf of the State
shows the government lost no time in taking steps to
set up a public sector resin distillation plant in a farflung area of the State, namely, Sundarbani, in Rajouri
District. Moreover, the State would be able to secure
extraction of resin from these inaccessible areas on the
best possible terms instead of allowing them to remain
unexploited or given over at ridiculously low royalty.
We cannot accept the contention of the petitioners that
under the impugned Order a buge benefit was conferred
on the second respondents at the cost of the State. It is
clear from the terms of the impugned Order that the
second respondents would have to extract at least 5000
metric tonnes of resin from the blazes allotted to them
in order to be entitled to retain 3500 metric tonnes. The
counter-affidavit of Ghulam Rasul on behalf of the first
respondent and Guran Devaya on behalf of the second
respondents show that the estimated cost of extraction
and collection of resin from these inaccessible areas
would be at the least Rs.175 per quintal, though
according to Guran Devaya it would be in doubt that
the State must endeavour to obtain the highest price
subject, of course, to any other overriding
considerations of public interest and in that event, its
action in giving resin to a private individual at a lesser
price would be arbitrary and contrary to public interest.
But, where the State has, as a matter of policy, stopped
selling resin to outsiders and decided to allot it only to
industries set up within the State for the purpose of
encouraging industrialisation, there can be no scope for
complaint that the State is giving resin at a lesser price
than that which could be obtained in the open market.
The yardstick of price in the open market would be
wholly inept, because in view of the State policy, there
would be no question of any resin being sold in the
open market. The object of the State in such a case is
not to earn revenue from sales of resin, but to promote
the setting up of industries within the State. Moreover,
the prices realised at the auctions held in December
1978, January 1979 and April 1979 did not reflect the
correct and genuine price of resin, because by the time
200

WP(C) No.10685/2004

these auctions came to be held, it had become known
that the State had taken a policy decision to ban export
of resin from its territories with effect from 1979-80
and the prices realised at the auctions were therefore
scarcity prices. In fact, the auction held in April 1979
was the last auction in the State and since it was known
that in future no resin would be available for sale by
auction in the open market to outsiders, an unduly high
price of Rs.700 per quintal was offered by the factory
owners having their factories outside the State, so that
they would get as much resin for the purpose of feeding
their industrial units for some time. The counteraffidavits show that, in fact,t he average sale price of
resin realised during the year 1978-79 was only Rs.433
per quintal and as compared to this price, the 2nd
respondents were required to pay price or royalty at a
higher rate of Rs.474 per quintal for 3500 metric tonnes
of resin to be retained by them ;under the impugned
Order. It is in the circumstances impossible to see how
it can at all be said that any benefit was conferred on
the second respondents at the cost of the State. The
first head of challenge against the impugned Order
must, therefore, be rejected.
xxxx

xxxx

21.
The third and last ground of challenge is
also difficult to sustain. We fail to see how the action
of the State in making the impugned Order in favour of
the 2nd respondents could be said to be arbitrary or
unreasonable. It is clear from the facts we have
narrated above and we need not repeat those facts
again, that the States was not unjustified in excluding
11,85,414 blazes situate in the inaccessible areas of
Reasi, Ramban and Poonch divisions from the auctions,
since the past experience showed that even on the basis
of royalty without load, it was difficult to attract
bidders and the maximum that could be obtained, and
that too only in one solitary year, was Rs.2.55 per blaze
without load, which was an absurdly low return and it
was, therefore, felt quite justifiably, that it would be
futile to include these blazes in the auctions for tapping
on wage-contract basis. The State royalty with or
without ;load, because, as a matter of policy, with a
view to encouraging industrialisation, the State did not
want resin to go outside its encouraging
industrialisation, the State did not want resin to go
outside its territories but wanted it to be used only for
the purpose of feeding industries set up within the State
and even if a condition could legitimately be imposed
on the contractor that he should sell the resin extracted
and retained by him only to industries within the State,
it would be difficult to ensure observance of such
condition and moreover the object of the State to make
resin available to the local industries at a reasonable
prices might be frustrated, because the contractor
taking advance of scarcity in supply of resin, might,
and in all probability would, try to extract a must
higher price from the industries needing resin. It was
thus found to be an impracticable proposition to tap
these blazes either on wages-contract basis or on the
basis of royalty with or without load.
22.
Now the 2nd respondents had made an offer
for putting up a modern plant for manufacture of rosin,
201

WP(C) No.10685/2004

turpentine oil and other derivatives within the State
provided they were assured a definite supply of resin
every year. But having regard to the commitments
already made by it, it was not possible for the State to
make any definite allocation of resin to the 2nd
respondents and a proposal was therefore mooted that
11,85,414 blazes in inaccessible areas of Reasi,
Ramban and Poonch Devisions could be allocated to
the 2nd respondents for tapping on certain terms and
conditions so that the 2nd respondents could tap these
blazes and out of the resin extracted, obtain for
themselves an assured supply for running the factory to
be set up by them and make the balance quantity
available to the State for its own purpose. The 2 nd
respondents were agreeable to this proposal and they
accordingly put forward an alternative proposal on
these lines for the consideration of the State and
eventually, the impugned Order came to be made in
favour of the 2nd respondents. We have already
discussed that the impugned Order was unquestionable
and without doubt, in the interest of the State and even
with a microscopic examination we fail to see anything
in it which could possibly incur the reproach of being
condemned as arbitrary or irrational. It is true that no
advertisements were issued by the State inviting
tenders for award of tapping contract in respect of these
blazes or stating that tapping contract would be given
to any party who is prepared to put up a factory for
manufacture of rosin, turpentine oil and other
derivatives within the State, but it must be remembered
that it was not a tapping contract simpliciter which was
being given by the State. The tapping contract was
being given by way of allocation of raw material for
feeding the factory to be set up by the 2nd respondents.
The predominant purpose of the transaction was to
ensure setting up of a factory bu the 2nd respondents as
part of the process of industrialisation of the State and
since the 2nd respondents wanted assurance of a definite
supply of resin as a condition of putting up the factory,
the State awarded the tapping contract to the 2nd
respondents for this purpose. If the State were giving
tapping contract simpliciter there can be no doubt that
the State would have to auction or invite tenders for
securing the highest price, subject, of course, to any
other relevant overriding considerations of public weal
or interest, but in a case like this where the State is
allocating resources such as water, power, raw
materials etc. for the purpose of encouraging setting up
of industries within the State we do not think the State
is bound to advertise and tell the people that it wants a
particular industry to be set up within the State and
invite those interested to come up with proposals for
the purpose. The State may choose to do so, if it thinks
fit and in a given situation, it may even turn out to be
advantageous for the State to do so, but if any private
party comes before the State and offers to set up an
industry, the State would not be committing breach of
any constitutional or legal obligation if it negotiates
with such party and agrees to provide resources and
other facilities for the purpose of setting up the
industry. The State is not obliged to tell such party :
“Please wait I will first advertise, see whether any other
offers are forthcoming and then after considering all
efforts, decided whether I should let you set up the
202

WP(C) No.10685/2004

industry stop.”It would be most unrealistic to insist on
such a procedure, particularly in an area like Jummu &
Kashmir which on account of historical, political and
other reasons, is not yet industrially developed and
where entrepreneurs have to be offered attractive terms
in order to persuade them to set up an industry. The
State must be free in such a case to negotiate with a
private entrepreneur with a view to inducing him to set
up an industry within the State and if the State enters
into a contract with such entrepreneur for providing
resources and other facilities for setting up an industry,
the contract cannot be assailed as invalid so long as the
State has acted bona fide, reasonably and in public
interest. If the terms and conditions of the contract or
the surrounding circumstances show that the State has
acted mala fide or out of improper or corrupt motive or
in order to promote the private interests of someone at
the cost of the State, the court will undoubtedly
interfere and strike down State action as arbitrary,
unreasonable or contrary to public interest. But so long
as the State action is bona fide and reasonable, the
court will not interfere merely on the ground that no
advertisement was given or publicity made or tenders
invited. Here, the 2nd respondents approached the State
for the purpose of setting up a modern factory for
manufacture of rosin, turpentine oil and other
derivatives and asked for allocation of resin and the
State, with a view to offering an incentive to the 2nd
respondents to set up the factory, made the impugned
Order awarding the tapping contract in respect of these
blazes to the 2nd respondents as a part of package deal.
We have already pointed out and we need not repeat
again, that the impugned Order was reasonable and in
the interest of the State and in the circumstances, we
are clearly of the view that it cannot be assailed as
invalid merely because no advertisements were issued
inviting offers for setting up a factory and taking the
tapping contract as an integral part of the transaction.”
233.

From the perusal of the above, it is apparent that the court held

that if a contract simplicit for mere tapping of resin was being given, then
undoubtedly, recourse to invitation of tenders or a public auction to secure a
highest price would be essential.

However, in the light of the given

situation and for the factors explained by the State, it was necessary and
advantageous for the state to adopt the procedure which had been adopted.
In the instant case, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi had not
only allocated all the CTCs to Sulabh International but had enabled it to
derive commercial profits therefrom by advertisement and had also agreed
203

WP(C) No.10685/2004

to bear the huge cost and investment of moulding the CTCs to the
requirements of Sulabh International. The action of the MCD, therefore
would not draw any parity or comparison with the action of the state of
Jammu and Kashmir which was concerned with considerations of public
interest, involving allocation of resources such as water, power, raw
materials etc for the purposes of encouraging setting up of industries within
the state. The allocation involved considerations of providing employment
opportunities as well and also entrepreneurs were required to be offered
directive terms in order to persuade them to set up industry in admittedly
hard and inaccessible terrain. The Apex Court also noticed that the sole
reason for assailing the action of the state was the fact that no
advertisements were issued for the purposes of inviting tenders.
234.

Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing

for the Sulabh International has placed strong reliance on the
pronouncement of the Apex Court in (1987) 2 SCC 295 Sachidanand
Pandey & Anr. v. State of West Bengal.

In this case, the court was

concerned with a public interest litigation challenging the construction of a
five star hotel in the vicinity of the zoological garden. The petitioners had
challenged the cabinet decision of the State Government to lease part of the
zoo land so far used for fodder cultivation, burial ground, hospital etc for
animals, to a leading hotel company. After a close examination of the entire
matter, the court found that the decision was taken openly after due
application of mind to all relevant considerations including the ecology,

204

WP(C) No.10685/2004

providing of alternative facilities to the zoo and all other implications etc. It
was found that the decision, which was of a commercial nature, was taken
by the State Government after a process of protected discussions,
consultations, negotiations and consideration of various aspects, covering
about 2 years and that the same was taken openly after a consideration of
also all objections raised against the project, the public interest litigation at
the instance of some persons having vested interest was frivolous and did
not deserve to be entertained.

The court also considered any such

background as to when negotiation, interest of public auction or tender was
more appropriate and the principles for determination thereof. The court
found that the present case was not one of those cases where the evidence is
first gathered and a decision is later arrived at which is incorporated in a
recent order but was a case where discussions had necessarily stretched over
a long period of time, several factors were independently and separately
made out and considered and the decision and the reasons therefore could
be gathered by looking at the entire course of events and circumstances
stretching over the period from the initiation of the proposal to the taking of
the final objection. The decision of the Government was not one of those
misleading decisions taken in the shrouded secrecy of the procedural
chamber but was taken openly without any attempt at secrecy. The court
found that the Government was alive to the various considerations requiring
thought and deliberations. The court had arrived at a conscious decision
after taken them into account which was bereft of any malafide.

205

WP(C) No.10685/2004

The

transaction bore a commercial though public character which could be
settled only after such prolonged discussion, clarification and consultations
with all concerned persons. Reiterating that state owned or public owned
property is not to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the executive,
the court emphasised that public interest is the paramount consideration.
One of the methods of securing the public interest, when it is considered
necessary to dispose of a property, is to sell it off by public auction or by
inviting tenders. Though this is the ordinary rule, it is not an invariable
rule.

There may be situations where there are compelling reasons

necessitating departure from the rule but then the reason for the departure
have to be rational and not suggestive of discrimination. Appearance of
public justice is as important as doing justice. Nothing should be done
which gives an appearance of bias, jobbery or nepotism.
In this case, the very location of the land, nature of the required
construction and the establishment of the five star hotel was indicative of
the requirement of expertise and sound financial position on the part of
those who might offer to construct and establish them. It was in the absence
of any other leading hoteliers apart from the ITDC and the Taj group
coming forward, that direct negotiations were held with those who had
come forward with the proposal and that the same was without doubt, the
most reasonable and rational way of proceeding in the matter rather than
inviting tenders or holding public auction. Tenders and auction were most
impractical in the circumstances. It is noteworthy that the Taj group had

206

WP(C) No.10685/2004

agreed to keep the hotel as a low rise structure so that the building would
not come within the trajectory of birds flying into the lake in the zoo as well
as special care in the matter of illumination of the hotel so that the birds and
the animals in the zoo are not effected or disturbed in any manner.

The

group had also undertaken to construct the alternative facilities for the zoo
under provision of the committee of the state.
In these circumstances, the court noticed the submissions on
behalf of the writ petitioner and answered the same thus :“31.
One of the arguments strenuously pressed by
Dr. Singhvi was that, even if it was assumed that the
government had the power to transfer the land, the
government did not have the power to deal with the land
in any manner that they liked. Certain norms and
procedures had to be observed and nothing could be
done which would result in loss to the public exchequer.
the Bengal Land Manual prescribed the procedure to be
followed in the matter of transferring land belonging to
the government. That procedure had to be observed. In
any case, it was necessary either to hold a public auction
or to invite tenders at least from the limited class of
persons interested in utilising the land for the purpose
for which the land was proposed to be transferred. The
learned counsel invited our attention to several
decisions of the court : Rashbihari Panda v. State of
Orissa, R.D. Shetty v. International Airport Authority,
Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v. State of J. & K., State of
Haryana v. Jage Ram, Ram & Shyam Co. v. State of
Haryana, and Chenchu Rami Reddy v. Government of
A.P.”
XXXX

40.
On a consideration of the relevant cases cited
at the bar the following propositions may be taken as
well established : State-owned or public-owned property
is not to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the
executive. Certain precepts and principles have to be
observed.
Public interest is the paramount
consideration. One of the methods of securing the
public interest, when it is considered necessary to
dispose of a property, is to sell the property by public
auction or by inviting tenders. Though that is the
ordinary rule, it is not an invariable rule. There may be
situations wheres there are compelling reasons
necessitating departure from the rule but then the reason
for the departure must be rational and should not be
suggestive of discrimination. Appearance of public
justice is as important as doing justice. Nothing should
207

WP(C) No.10685/2004

235.

be done which gives an appearances of bias, jobbery or
nepotism.”
At this stage, it would be useful to consider the pronouncement

of the Apex Court reported at 1995 (Supp. 2) SCC 512 G.D. Zalani & Anr.
v. Union of India & Ors. In this case, the court was concerned with a
challenge to the

method adopted by the respondents in respect of

acquisition of advance technology by a Government of India company
(Hindustan Antibiotics Limited) for improvement of its production.
Negotiations were made with leading foreign companies and a
memorandum of understanding for technological tie up of the Indian
company with a foreign company, being a world leader of leasing out its
plant for an annual rental to a proposed joint venture company which was to
be formed by the two companies was entered into.

This MOU was

challenged on grounds inter alia of malafide or extraneous considerations on
the part of the managing director; promotion of the facilities being unfair of
and violative of Article 14 and failure to resort to auction or tender
rendering the same illegal as well as on grounds of violation of principles of
natural justice. In this behalf, the court noticed thus:“30.
There is yet another fact. Most of these
companies keep their processes and technology a
guarded secret. More better the technology, more
fervently it is guarded.
And HAL needed a
technology superior to the one it was already having.
Not only was it producing only 55% of its installed
capacity, its cost of production was far higher than
what it ought to be. It is true, cost of production
could have been reduced to some extent by
rationalising and streamlining the working methods
(as pointed out by the Sub-Committee in its report)
but the more important need was to increase the
208

WP(C) No.10685/2004

yield from the strains and achieve full capacity
production. On account of efforts made over the
years, production had increased to some extent but it
was till way behind its installed capacity, i.e., full
capacity production. Thus, it was not a case of
merely leasing out a government company but a case
where the government company was trying to obtain
the best possible technology. In such matters, sights
have to be set far into the future and arrive at a
reasonable prognosis keeping in mind the best
interests of the Company. Floating of tenders may
not have been a proper method to adopt in these
circumstances. In any event, among the available
technologies, not only has the GB the best
technology, it was the only source available, the
other having been rejected as already stated.
Probably it is for this reason that the Government of
India gave the directive on 20-6-1994. In the above
circumstances and, on the present material, we
cannot say that Shri Basu was either actuated by
mala fides or that he was acting out of extraneous
reasons.
34.
We must reiterate that this was not a
simple cse of granting of lease of a government
company, in which case the court would have been
justified in insisting upon the authorities following a
fair method consistent with Article 14, i.e. by calling
for tenders. We agree that while selling public
property or granting its lease, the normal method is
auction or calling for tenders so that all intending
purchasers/lessees should have an equal opportunity
of submitting their bids/tenders. Even there, there
may be exceptional situations where adopting such a
course may not be insisted upon. Be that as it may,
the case here is altogether different. HAL was trying
to improve not only the quantum of production but
also its quality and for that purpose looking for an
appropriate partner. They went in for the best. It
must be remembered that this technology is not there
for the mere asking of it. All the leading drug
companies keep their processes and technology a
guarded secret. Bing businessman, they like to
derive maximum profit for themselves.
It is
ultimately a matter of bargain. In such cases, all that
need be ensured is that the Government or the
authority, as the case may be, has acted fairly and
209

WP(C) No.10685/2004

has arrived at the best available arrangement in the
circumstances.”
Again, this judgment was rendered in the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case. After a close consideration of the reasons, the
court held that the deviation from the normal rule of adopting the process of
public auction and tender was valid.
236.

The judgment of the Apex Court in M.P. Oil Extraction v State

of M.P. (1997) 7 SCC 592 was also rendered in the peculiar facts of the
case. The State Government of Madhya Pradesh framed an industrial policy
in 1979 and thereafter revised the same from time to time to the felt need.
The Apex Court found that there was no material on record on which it
could be reasonably held that the same was not informed by any reason
whatsoever. In any case, the policy had been considered on an earlier
occasion by not only the Apex Court but also the High Court of M.P. in a
legal proceeding and the industrial policy had not been found to be arbitrary
or capricious. The State of M.P. took a policy decision with regard to
distribution of state largesse in the form of sal seeds and thereby adopted a
protective measure for selected industrial units. Thereby, the State decided
to give different treatment to unequals. An agreement was entered into by
the State with selected industrial units who were commissioned on the
invitation of the state to undertake oil extraction operations, for an assured
supply of sal seeds at concessional rates to them. Such agreement was made
as a protective measure based on an industrial policy. One of the units
selected was on the basis of its geographical situation as it was situated in a

210

WP(C) No.10685/2004

backward tribal area and the other was selected on the basis of a review by a
high powered committee during pendency of arbitration proceedings
initiated by it on termination of its agreement by the State.
The appellants who challenged these agreements with the
selected industries were old industrial units within the state and having not
been selected for the agreement, challenged the same on grounds of the
same being violative of Article 14. In this behalf, the Apex Court held that
distinctive features between the industrial units set up at the instance of the
State Government with whom the agreement had been entered into and the
old existing units as the appellants were based on an objective criteria. The
industrial units who were commissioned on the invitation of the state to
undertake oil extraction operations on the assurance of the supply of sal
seeds by the state stood on a separate footing. Therefore, the said two
classes of industries were not similarly circumstanced. Article 14 prohibits
discrimination amongst equals but it had an inbuilt flexibility and also
permitted different treatment to unequals.

The classification of the

industries on the basis of geographical situation has a rational basis and has
been recognised by the Apex Court. Consequently, the agreement could not
be per se held to be illegal or arbitrary.
So far as the challenge to the renewal clause in the agreement
was concerned, the court held that it was a matter of decision by the State
Government and unless such decision is patently arbitrary, interference by
the court is not called of. The court held that in the case in hand, keeping in

211

WP(C) No.10685/2004

view these facts, the decision of the State Government to extend the
protection for a further period could not be held to be per se irrational,
arbitrary or capricious warranting judicial review of such policy decision.
In this background, the court observed thus :“41.
After giving our careful
consideration to the facts and circumstances of the
case and to the submissions made by the learned
counsel for the parties, it appears to us that the
Industrial Policy of 1979 which was subsequently
revised from time to time cannot be held to be
arbitrary and based on no reason whatsoever but
founded on mere ipse dixit of the State Government
of M.P. The executive authority of the State must be
held to be within its competence to frame a policy for
the administration of the State. Unless the policy
framed is absolutely capricious and, not being
informed by any reason whatsoever, can be clearly
held to be arbitrary and founded on mere ipse dixit of
the executive functionaries thereby offending Article
14 of the Constitution or such policy offends other
constitutional provisions or comes into conflict with
any statutory provision, the Court cannot and should
not outstep its limit and tinker with the policy
decision of the executive functionary of the State.
This Court, in no uncertain terms, has sounded a note
of caution by indicating that policy decision is in the
domain of the executive authority of the State and the
Court should not embark on the unchartered ocean of
public policy and should not question the efficacy or
otherwise of such policy so long the same does not
offend any provision of the statute or the Constitution
of India. The supremacy of each of the three organs
of the State i.e. legislature, executive and judiciary in
their respective fields of operation needs to be
emphasised. The power of judicial review of the
executive and legislative action must be kept within
the bounds of constitutional scheme so that there may
not be any occasion to entertain misgivings about the
role of judiciary in out stepping its limit by
unwarranted judicial activism being very often talked
of in these days. The democratic set-up to which the
policy is so deeply committed cannot function
212

WP(C) No.10685/2004

237.

property unless each of the three organs appreciate
the need for mutual respect and supremacy in their
respective fields.”
Even the decision of the Supreme Court in (2000) 8 SCC 262

Netai Bag & Ors. v. State of West Bengal was rendered in the facts and
circumstances of the case. In this case, certain lands were acquired by the
state after compliance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act,
1894 for a public purpose. An unutilised surplus portion of such land was
sold to the respondents.

This land was sold to the respondents for

constructing the abattoir. The sale was challenged by the appellants, four of
whom were stated to be the erstwhile owners interested only to get back the
lands legally acquired from them, while some others were those who were
advocating vegetarianism.

The appellants challenged the action of the

respondents solely on the ground of arbitrariness and violation of Article 14
and also though no allegations of mala fides had been made against anyone
of the respondents, however before the Supreme Court, the appellants
contended that though not actual but legal mala fides were discernible from
the pleadings of the parties and the record produced by them.
Noticing that despite best efforts, the State Government could
not set up any project on the surplus land and being unsuccessful in
securing any buyer for the abattoir which had been set up at Durgapur; on
being invited by the State Government, the respondent no. 5 had agreed to
take over the Durgapur project and also to set up the abattoir on the surplus
land. It was found that amongst the considerations which weighed with the
Government in giving the lease of the surplus land to respondent no. 5 was
213

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the object of setting up an industry in the state of West Bengal which was
likely to generate employment to more than 300 persons and earned foreign
exchange worth more than Rs.50 crores. After the government had failed in
its efforts for the purposes of transferring the Durgapur project, and
establishment of Mourigam, the State Government wrote to some Bombay
based firms, reputed in the field, to salvage the two projects. Positive
response was received from some firms of which respondent no. 5 was
found, on merits, to be preferable to others.
In these circumstances, the court held that in the absence of any
pleadings in the writ petition before the High Court or any specific
allegations of mala fides against any of the respondents, it could not be said
that mere violation of some alleged statutory provisions which safeguards
has felt out by the Apex Court would render the state action to be arbitrary
in all cases. In these facts, the court held thus :“ 19.
Though the State cannot escape its liability to
show its actions to be fair, reasonable and in accordance
with law, yet wherever challenge is thrown to any of such
action, initial burden of showing the prima facie
existence of violation of the mandate of the Constitution
lies upon the person approaching the court. We have
found in this case, that the appellants have miserably
failed to place on record or to point out to any alleged
constitutional vice or illegality. Neither the High Court
nor this Court would have ventured to make a rowing
inquiry particularly in a writ petition filed at the instances
of the erstwhile owners of the land, whose main object
appeared to get the land back by any means as,
admittedly, with the passage of time and development of
the area, the value of the land had appreciated manifold.
It may be noticed that in the year 1961 the erstwhile
owners were paid about Rs.5.5 lakhs and the State
Government assessed the market value of the property
which was paid by Respondent 5 at Rs.71,59,820. The
appellants have themselves stated that the value of the
land round about the time, when it was leased to
Respondent 5 was about Rs. 11 crores. There cannot be
any dispute with the proposition that generally when any
State land is intended to be transferred or the State
largesse decided to be conferred, resort should be had to
214

WP(C) No.10685/2004

public auction or transfer by way of inviting tenders from
the people. That would be a sure method of guaranteeing
compliance with the mandate of Article 14 of the
Constitution. Non-floating of tenders or not holding of
public auction would not in all cases be deemed to be the
result of the exercise of the executive power in an
arbitrary manner. Making an exception to the general
rule could be justified by the State executive, if
challenged in appropriate proceedings.
The
constitutional courts cannot be expected to presume the
alleged irregularities, illegalities or unconstitutionality
nor the courts can substitute their opinion for the bona
fide opinion of the State executive. The Courts are not
concerned with the ultimate decision but only with the
fairness of the decision-making process.
20.
The Government is entitled to make pragmatic
adjustments and policy decision which may be necessary
or called for under the prevalent peculiar circumstances.
The court cannot strike down a policy decision taken by
the Government merely because it feels that another
decision would have been fairer or wiser or more
scientific or logical. In State of M.P;.v. Nandlal Jaiswal
it was held that the policy decision can be interfered with
by the court only if such decision is shown to be patently
arbitrary, discriminatory or mala fide. In the matter of
different modes, under the rule of general application
made under the M.P. Excise Act, the Court found that the
four different modes, namely, tender, auction, fixed
licence fee or such other manner were alternative to one
another and any one of them could be resorted to. In
Sachidanand Pandey v. State of W.B, it was held that as
regards the question of propriety of private negotiation
with an individual or corporation, it should be borne in
mind that State-owned or public-owned property is not to
be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the executive.
Certain percepts and principles have to be observed,
public interest being the paramount consideration. One
of the methods of securing the public interest when it is
considered necessary to dispose of the property is to sell
the property by public auction or by inviting tenders. But
such a rule is not an invariable rule. there may be
situations where there are compelling reasons
necessitating departure from the rule. As and when a
departure is made from the general rule, it must be shown
that such an action was rational and not suggestive of
discrimination.”
Thereupon the court considered the facts of the case to ascertain
as to whether the action of the State Government was illegal, arbitrary or
mala fide. The lease to the respondent no. 5 was for setting up an integrated
food processing unit with an abattoir in a semi rural area which was a low
lying land where the Government was unable to set up any project despite
best efforts. Its newspaper advertisement had failed to get buyers for the

215

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Durgapur project. The State Government had considered the standing of the
respondent no. 5 and the work it had already done in the field in question.
In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the court held that it was
not possible to held that the action of the respondent no. 5 was
unreasonable, legal, arbitrary or actuated by extraneous consideration. The
challenge was negated in these circumstances.
238.

Similarly in (2003) 8 SCC 100 5 M.T. Consultants

Secundarabad v. S.Y. Nawab, the Apex Court had occasion to consider the
decision of the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad to allot as a pilot
project on experimental basis permission to the appellant for erecting street
sign boards at certain specified places.

The Municipal Corporation of

Hyderabad had an idea for erecting for the use and benefit of the public,
road direction boards on various thorough fares in the twin cities of
Hyderabad and Secundarabad for some time. But due to financial restraints,
it could not take any step for its realisation.

In September, 1993, the

appellant approached the corporation with a proposal formulated by on an
in-depth study, in the form of a scheme and project for rationalisation of the
house numbering in the twin cities. Other details and also erection of the
street sign boards indicating the name of the locality, the street number,
details of house numbers etc. were also suggested and it offered to take up
that project.

It was after detailed re-inspection of the samples of the

appellant's work, the examination of the various design and revised design
etc and after satisfaction of the corporation authorities the corporation

216

WP(C) No.10685/2004

decided to undertake the work as a pilot project on experimental basis and
gave permission in September, 1994 to the appellant for erecting the street
sign boards at certain specified places. The terms and conditions of the
work had been specified. The entire cost of the work was to be borne by the
appellant and not by the corporation which was to pay only a nominal cost
of Rs.5/- and it was open to the corporation to impose on the appellant
advertising fee and ground rent if the maintenance was poor or advertising
space was more than what the stipulation in the agreement or any other
terms and conditions were not violated. The letter permitted the appellant to
lay out the space provided for advertising purpose to any of the appellants
client at the appellant's terms and conditions for 15 years from the date of
the letter. Ultimately, the installations had to be left at the property of the
corporation. The corporation also published in several newspapers a notice
calling upon private advertisers to participate in a meeting to be held at a
specified time and place and to avail of an opportunity to undertake project
of a similar nature. No private advertisers evinced any interest to give any
concrete proposal. The respondent who was the writ petitioner did not even
attend the meeting called by the corporation. The respondent filed a writ
petition before the High Court challenging the permission granted to the
appellant by the corporation as an ultravires of the Hyderabad Municipal
Corporation Act and Article 14 of the Constitution inter alia alleging that he
had approached the corporation for the permission to erect arches on main
roads and junctions at his own cost and to display thereon as per the rules

217

WP(C) No.10685/2004

but the corporation had refused such permission.

The respondent laid

several other such unproved allegations as well before the court. The single
Judge dismissed the writ petition however the Division Bench, in the appeal
assailing the order of the Single Judge, directed termination of the contract
and making of an exercise afresh for the purpose. In the appeal, assailing
the decision of the Division Bench after a detailed consideration of the
facts, the court held thus :“16.
The materials on record substantiated the
absolute need and necessity to undertake works of the
nature executed by the appellant, in furtherance of
great public interest and for larger public and common
good. The admitted dire financial position of the
Corporation and their inability to undertake such a
project at the cost of the Corporation and the fact that
the venture was long overdue apparently made the
Corporation authorities to avail of the project as
unfolded and volunteered by the appellant, subject, of
course, to further revisions, modifications and
suggestions in the best interests of the Corporation.
When it was undertaken as a pilot project on a trial
basis there might not have been much certainty about
the profitability of the scheme as a business venture for
the private party concerned and the appellant was
prepared to undertake the said risk and executed the
works to the satisfaction of the authorities and
appreciation of the public as well. The risk involved is
not only in recouping the investments to be made for
installations and constructions but to maintain them in
good, proper and working condition without also
sacrificing the beauty of the installations throughout
the duration of 15 years. Conditions imposed on the
appellants involve great responsibilities and
obligations and necessarily certain concessions had to
be shown to keep the project working and maintain
them in good shape.
Not only the Municipal
Corporation had no financial commitments in getting
such works by any expenditure therefor, which were to
be executed by the appellant only on self-financing
basis generating the required funds for installation and
218

WP(C) No.10685/2004

continued maintenance and their upkeep from sponsors
by collecting premiums for giving them the privilege
to avail of the space permitted by the Corporation for
advertisements but ultimately the whole works have to
be left with the Corporation and it is not to be removed
by the appellant. As rightly observed by the learned
Single Judge the venture cannot be considered to be
the grant of a largessees or lease or contract in the
conventional sense. The provisions in the Municipal
Corporation Act cannot be said to envisages situations
of the nature, when enacted. This appears to be a
project more akin to the one considered by this Court
in G.B. Mahajan case. The fact that no other private
advertising agencies, including the writ petitioner
could offer to undertake such a venture in the other
available areas when their participation was sought for
belies the tall claims of the writ petitioner now made,
after finding the project to have become successful and
apparently fruitful – more perhaps than it could have
been thought of initially by everyone. Perhaps irked
by this only the interests of the writ petitioner seem to
have gained momentum, to try in desperateness for the
“Shylock's pound of flesh”, to ruin the very project,
unmindful of any concern for the Corporation, the
public good and the appellant.
“17.
A careful and dispassionate
assessment and consideration of the materials placed
on record does not leave any reasonable impression,
on the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case,
that anything obnoxious which requires either public
criticism or condemnation by courts of law had
taken place. It is by now well settled that nonfloating of tenders or absence of public auction or
invitation alone is no sufficient reason to castigate
the move or an action of a public authority as either
arbitrary or unreasonable or amounting to mala fide
or improper exercise or improper abuse of power by
the authority concerned. Courts have always leaned
in favour of sufficient latitude being left with the
authorities to adopt their own techniques of
management of projects with concomitant economic
expediencies depending upon the exigencies of a
situation guided by appropriate financial policy in
the best interests of the authority motivated by
public interest as well as in undertaking such
ventures.

The Commissioner or other authorities of the
Corporation, who seem to have undertaken this at a
point of time when there is no concrete
scheme/project or sufficient funds with the
Corporation, appear to have embarked upon this
venture in good faith, keeping in view not only the
public good but also in an earnest endeavour to
secure such a novel project executed without any
financial commitments or expenditure whatsoever
either for the installations or subsequent upkeep and
maintenance for at least 15 years. Merely because
as an ultimate outcome in the long range, the
appellant is able to make some more profit than
what was envisaged itself could not render the
exercise undertaken or scheme executed vulnerable
for being challenged to be either as one in improper
abuse of powers or by means of any
reprehensible/condemnable conduct, calling for
interference at the hands of court of law.”
So far as the judgments relied upon by the petitioners are

concerned, in AIR 1983 SC 1207 State of Haryana & Ors. v. Jageram, the
court was concerned with a re-auction of liqour vends which was to be
conducted under the provisions of the Punjab Liqour Licence Rules, 1956
and non-compliance thereof. Therefore, strictly this judgment would have
no application in the instant case.
240.

Similarly, in AIR 1985 SC 1147 Ram and Shyam Company v.

State of Haryana & Ors., the court was concerned with grant of lease to a
person other than the highest bidder i.e. the respondent no. 4 under the
Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act. This grant was
challenged by the appellant who was the highest bidder. It was noticed by
the court that respondent no. 4 was not selected for any special purpose or to
satisfy any directive principle of state policy. He surreptitiously ingratiated

220

WP(C) No.10685/2004

himself by a back door entry giving a minor raise in the bid and in the
process usurped the most undeserved benefit which was exposed to the hilt
in the court. The court observed that only the blind could refuse to perceive
such action. In this case, an objection was raised to the writ petition that the
appellant had an alternative remedy of the normal statutory appeal available
to him.
Rejecting this contention, the Apex Court observed thus :“9.
Before we deal with the larger issue, let me
put out of the way the contention that found favour
with the High Court in rejecting the writ petition. The
learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench
recalling the observations of this court in Assistant
Collector of Central Excise Vs. Jainson Hosiery
Industries (1979) 4 SCC 22 : (AIR 1979 SC 1889)
rejected the writ petition observing that 'the petitioner
who invokes the extraordinary jurisdiction of the court
under Art. 226 of the Constitution must have exhausted
the normal statutory remedies available to him.' We
remain unimpressed. Ordinary it is true that the court
has imposed a restraint in its own wisdom on its
exercise of jurisdiction under Art. 226 where the party
invoking the jurisdiction has an effective, adequate
alternative remedy. More often, it has been expressly
stated that the rule which requires the exhaustion of
alternative remedies is a rule of convenience and
discretion rather than rule of law. At any rate it does
not oust the jurisdiction of the Court. In fact in the very
decision relied upon by the High Court in the State of
Uttar Pradesh V. Mohammad Nooh 1958 SCR 595 :
(AIR 1958 SC 86) it is observed 'that there is no rule,
with regard to certiorari as there is with mandamus, that
it will lie only where there is no other equally effective
remedy.' It should be made specifically clear that
where the order complained against is alleged to be
illegal or invalid as being contrary to law, a petition at
the instance of person adversely affected by it, would
lie to the High Court under Art. 226 and such a petition
cannot be rejected on the ground that an appeal lies to
the higher officer or the State Government. An appeal
221

WP(C) No.10685/2004

241.

in all cases cannot be said to provide in all situations an
alternative effective remedy keeping aside the nice
distinction between jurisdiction and merits. Look at the
fact situation in this case. Power was exercised
formally by the authority set up under the Rules to
grant contract but effectively and for all practical
purposes by the Chief Minister of the State. To whom
do you appeal in a State administration against the
decision of the Chief Minister? The cliché of appeal
from Caesor to Caesor's wife can only be bettered by
appeal from one's own order to oneself. Therefore this
is a case in which the High Court was not at all justified
in throwing out the petition on the untenable ground
that the appellant had an effective alternative remedy.
The High Court did not pose to itself the question, who
would grant relief when the impugned order is passed
at the instanced of the Chief Minister of the State. To
whom did the High Court want the appeal to be filed
over the decision of the Chief Minister? There was no
answer and that by itself without anything more would
be sufficient to set aside the judgment of the High
Court.”
The other main contention relating to the merits of the

controversy with regard to grant of the lease to a person who was not the
highest bidder is concerned, the court placing reliance on the earlier
pronouncement in Ramanna Daya Ram Shetty (supra) and Kasturi Lal
Laxmi Reddy v State of Jammu & Kashmir (supra) held thus :“12.
Let us put into focus the clearly
demarcated approach that distinguishes the use and
disposal of private property and socialist property.
Owner of private property may deal with it in any
manner he likes without causing injury to any one
else. But the socialist or if that word is jarring to
some, the community or further the public property
has to be dealt with for public purpose and in public
interest. The marked difference lies in this that while
the owner of private property may have a number of
considerations which may permit him to dispose of
his property for a song. On the other hand, disposal
of public property partakes the character of a trust in
that in its disposal there should be nothing hanky
222

WP(C) No.10685/2004

panky and that it must be done at the best price so
that larger revenue coming into the coffers of the
State administration would serve public purpose viz.
The welfare State may be able to expand its
beneficent activities by the availability of larger
funds. This is subject to one important limitation that
socialist property may be disposed at a price lower
than the market price or even for a token price to
achieve some defined constitutionally recognised
public purpose, one such being to achieve the goals
set out in Part IV of the Constitution. But where
disposal is for augmentation of revenue and nothing
else, the State is under an obligation to secure the
best market price available in a market economy. An
owner of private property need not auction it nor is
he bound to dispose it of at a current market price.
Factors such as personal attachment, or affinity,
kinship, empathy, religious sentiment or limiting the
choice to whom he may be willing to sell, may permit
him to sell the property at a song and without demur.
A welfare State as the owner of the public property
has no such freedom while disposing of the public
property. A welfare State exists for the largest good
of the largest number more so when it proclaims to be
a socialist State dedicated to eradication of poverty.
All its attempt must be to obtain the best available
price while disposing of its property because the
greater the revenue, the welfare activities will get a
fillip and shot in the arm. Financial constraint may
weaken the tempo of activities. Such an approach
serves the larger public purpose of expanding welfare
activities primarily for which the Constitution
envisages the setting up of a welfare State. In this
connection we may profitably refer to Ramana
Dayaram Shetty v. The International Airport
Authority of India (1979) 3 SCR 1014 : (AIR 1979
SC 1628)
13.
Approaching the matter from this angle,
can there be any doubt that the appellant whose
highest bid was rejected by the Government should
have no opportunity to improve uponhis bid more so
when his bid was rejected on the ground that it did
not represent adequate market consideration for the
concession to extract minor mineral. A unilateral
offer, secretly made, not correlated to any reserved
price made by the fourth respondent after making
223

WP(C) No.10685/2004

false statement in the letter was accepted without
giving any opportunity to the appellant either to raise
the bid or to point out the falsity of the allegations
made by the fourth respondent in the letter as also the
inadequacy of his bid. The appellant suffered an
unfair treatment by the State in discharging its
administrative functions thereby violating the
fundamental principle of fairplay in action. When we
gave the highest bid, he could not have been
expected to raise his own bid in the absence of a
competitor. Any expectation to the contrary betrays a
woeful lack of knowledge of auction process. And
then some one surreptitiously by a secret offer scored
a march over him. No opportunity was given to him
either to raise the bid or to controvert and correct the
erroneous statement.
14. What happened in this case must open the eyes
both of the Government as well as the people at large.
How an uncontrolled exercise of executive power to
deal with socialist property in which entire
community’s interest was sacrificed so as to cause
huge loss to the public exchequer would have gone
unnoticed but for the vigilance of the appellant who
no doubt is not altruistic in its approach but its
business interests goaded it to expose the unsavoury
deal. Conceding that on weighty and valid
considerations, the highest bid can be rejected by the
State, one such consideration which can be foreseen
is that the highest bid does not represent the adequate
market price of the concession, yet before giving up
the auction process and accepting a private bid
secretly offered, the authority must be satisfied that
such an offer if given in open would not be
outmatched by the highest bidder. In the absence of
such satisfaction, acceptance of an offer secretly
made and sought to be substantiated on the
allegations without the verification of the truth,
which was not undertaken, would certainly amount to
arbitrary action in the matter of distribution of State
largessee which by the decisions of this Court is
impermissible. Even though repeatedly, this Court
has said that the State is not bound to accept the
highest bid, this proposition of law has to be read
subject to the observation that it can be rejected on
relevant and valid considerations, one such being that
the concession is to be given to a weaker section of
the society who could not outbid the highest bidder.”
242.

It is noteworthy that the court noticed that the government would

be under no obligation to accept the highest bid and that no right accrued to
224

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the bidder merely because his bid happened to be the highest. The court
also observed that the government had the right, for good and sufficient
reason, not to accept the highest bid but even to prefer a tenderer other than
the highest bidder (Ref Trilochan Mishra v. State of Orissa 1971(3) SCC
153 = AIR 1971 SC 733; AIR 1982 SC 1234 = 1982 2 SCC 365 State of
Uttar Pradesh v. Vijay Bahadur Singh; State of Orissa v. Hari Narayan
Jaiswal 1972 (3) SCR 784 = AIR 1972 SC 1816) but held that the rejection
of the highest bid can only be on grounds that are neither irrelevant nor
extraneous.
243.

In Ram and Shyam Company v. State of Haryana(supra), the

court further held that the respondents had placed reliance on the letter by
the 4th respondent who had indulged in levelling allegations, the truth of
which was not verified or asserted. The highest bidder whose bid was
rejected on the ground that the bid did not represent the marked price, was
not given an opportunity to raise his own bid when privately the higher offer
was received. The court held that if the allegations made in the letter
influenced the jurisdiction of the Chief Minister, fair play in action
demanded that the appellant should have been given an opportunity to
counter and correct the same. It was held that application of the minimum
principles of natural justice in such a situation must be read in the statute
and held to be obligatory. When it is said that “even in administrative
action, the authority must act fairly, it ordinarily open in accordance with
the principles of natural justice variously describe as fairplay in action.

225

WP(C) No.10685/2004

That having not been done, the grant in favour of the 4 th respondent must be
quashed.
244.

In a Constitutional Bench pronouncement of the Apex Court

reported at AIR 1954 SC 592 = 1955 SCR 305 K.N. Guruswamy v. State of
Mysore, commenting on the maintainability of the writ petition at the
instance of the highest bidder, the court noticed that the case, there was no
notification and the furtive method was adopted of settling a matter of this
moment, behind the backs of those interested and anxious to compete was
unjustified. Apart from the interest of the petitioner who challenged such
action, deeper considerations were also at stake, namely, the elimination of
favourtism and nepotism and corruption him to permit what had occurred in
the case would leave the door wide open to the very evils which the
legislature in its wisdom had endeavoured to avoid.
245.

In this behalf, the approach to be taken by the state must follow

the principles laid down in K.N. Guruswamy v. State of Mysore. In that
case, the appellant and the fourth respondent were rival liquor contractors
for the sale of the liquor contract for the year 1953-54 in the State of
Mysore. The contract was auctioned by the Deputy Commissioner under the
authority conferred upon him by the Mysore Excise Act, 1901. The
appellant’s bid was the highest and the contract was knocked down in his
favour subject to formal confirmation by the Deputy Commissioner. The
fourth respondent was present at the auction but did not bid. Instead of that
he went direct to the Excise Commissioner and made a higher offer. The

226

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Excise Commissioner cancelled the sale in favour of the appellant and
directed the Deputy Commissioner to take action under the relevant rule.
The latter accepted the tender of the respondent. The appellant moved the
High Court for a writ of mandamus which was dismissed. In appeal by the
certificate, it was urged on behalf of the State that the Deputy
Commissioner acted within the ambit of his powers under the relevant rule
which gave him an absolute discretion either to re-auction or to act
otherwise and no fetters are placed upon the “otherwise” method. The court
negatived this contention observing that arbitrary improvisation of an ad
hoc procedure to meet the exigencies of a particular case is ruled out.
Therefore, the grant of the contract to the fourth respondent was wrong. The
Constitutional Bench repelling the contention that a writ petition at the
instance of the appellant would not be maintainable, the Constitution Bench
observed as under:
“The next question is whether the appellant can
complain of this by way of a writ. In our opinion, he
could have done so in an ordinary case. The appellant
is interested in these contracts and has a right under
the laws of the State to receive the same treatment
and be given the same chance as anybody else. Here
we have Thimmappa who was present at the auction
and who did not bid — not that it would make any
difference if he had, for the fact remains that he made
no attempt to outbid the appellant. If he had done so
it is evident that the appellant would have raised his
own bid. The procedure of tender was not open here
because there was no notification and the furtive
method adopted of setting a matter of this moment
behind the back of those interested and anxious to
compete is unjustified. Apart from all else, that in
itself would in this case have resulted in a loss to the
State because, as we have said, the mere fact that the
appellant has pursued this writ with such vigour
shows that he would have bid higher. But deeper
considerations are also at stake, namely, the
elimination of favouratism and nepotism and
227

WP(C) No.10685/2004

corruption: not that we suggest that that occurred
here, but to permit what has occurred in this case
would leave the door wide open to the very evils
which the legislature in its wisdom has endeavoured
to avoid. All that is part and parcel of the policy of
the legislature. None of it can be ignored. We would
therefore in the ordinary course have given the
appellant the writ he seeks.”
So far as the action of the state to reject the highest bid and give

246.

the benefit of the concession to someone else is concerned, in AIR 1965
SC 1992 = 1965 (3) SCR 173 Nand Kishore Sarah v. State of Rajasthan,
the court has held that the benefit of the concession was given to a
cooperative society formed by the weaker sections of the society thereby
serving the public purpose as set out in Article 41 of the directive principles
of state policy. For this reason the grant of the concession was held to be
justifying.
247.

Pressing the issue of judicial interference in administrative action

and its scope, in AIR 1981 SC 344 = 1981 1 SCC 568 Fertilizer
Corporation Kamgar Union (Registered) Sindri v. Union of India, Krishna
Iyer, J speaking for himself and Bhagwati, J observed thus :- (at page 353)
“we
certainly agree that judicial
interference with the administration cannot be
meticulous in a montesquien system of separation of
powers. The court cannot usurp or abdicate and the
parameters of judicial review must be clearly defined
and never exceeded.
If the directorate of a
Government company has acted fairly, even if it has
faltered in its wisdom, the court cannot, as a super
auditor take he board of directors to task. This
function is limited to testing whether the
administrative action has been fair and free from the
taint of unreasonableness and has substantially
complied with the norms of procedure set for it by
rules of public administration.”

228

WP(C) No.10685/2004

In a concurring opinion Chandrachud, CJ observed that sales of
public property, when the intention is to get the best price, ought to take
place publically.
248.

Again in AIR 1986 SC 1158 Chenchu Rani Reddy & Anr. v.

Government of Andhra Pradesh & Anr., the court was considering a
challenge to the permission of the government of the sale of land belonging
to a charitable endowment by private negotiations instead of public auction.
In this case the action of the government was deprecated.

The court

observed thus :“6.
We cannot conclude without observing that
property of such institutions or endowments must be
jealously protected. It must be protected, for, a large
segment of the community has been beneficial interest
in it (that is the raison d'etre of the Act itself). The
authorities exercising the powers under the Act must
not only be most alert and vigilant in such matters but
also show awareness of the ways of the present day
world as also the ugly realities of the world of today.
They cannot afford to take things at their face value or
make a less than the closest and best attention approach
to guard against all pitfalls. The approving authority
must be aware that in such matters the trustees, or
persons authorized to sell by private negotiations, can,
in a given case, enter into a secret or invisible
underhand deal or understanding with the purchasers at
the cost of the concerned institution. Those who are
willing to purchase by private negotiations can also bid
at a public auction. Why would they feel shy or be
deterred from bidding at a public auction? Why then
permit sale by private negotiations which will not be
visible to the public eye and may even give rise to
public suspicion unless there are special reasons to
justify doing so? And care must be taken to fix a
reserve price after ascertaining the market value for the
sake of safeguarding the interest of the endowment.
With these words of caution we close the matter.”

229

WP(C) No.10685/2004

249.

In AIR 1988 SC 157 Haji T.M. S. Rawther v. Kerela Financial

Corporation, the court rejected the challenge to a sale of the property of a
debtor by the financial corporation. The court noticed the principle laid
down in the various judicial pronouncements and reiterated the principles
already laid down. It was noticed that the Apex Court has been insisting
upon the rule that not only to get the highest price for property but also to
ensure fairness in the activities of the state and public authorities, that the
public property owned by the state or instrumentalities of the state should be
generally sold by public auction or by inviting tenders.

The authority

should undoubtedly act fairly and their action should be legitimate, their
dealings should be above board. Their transactions should be without
aversion or affection and nothing should be suggestive of discrimination.
Nothing should be done by them which gives the impression of bias,
favouritism or nepotism. These factors would ordinarily be absent if the
matter is brought to public auction or sale by tenders and for this reason it
has been repeatedly reiterated that the state owned properties are required to
be disposed of publically. However, the court also observed that “though it
is the ordinary rule it is not an invariable rule”. There may be situations
necessitating departure from the rule, but then such instances must be
justified by compulsions and not by compromise. It must be justified by
compelling reasons and not by just convenience.
250.

These principles were reiterated by the Apex Court in AIR 1993

SC 1601 Food Corporation of India v. M/s Kamdhenu Cattle Food

230

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Industries.
In this case,the court was concerned with a challenge to the
action of the petitioners who had invited tenders for sale of damaged food
grains. The tenders received were highly deficient and inadequate. The
respondents tender was conditional and the full amount of the earnest
money required by the terms was also not deposited. The respondents bid
was admittedly the highest as was found on opening the tenders but the
appellant was not satisfied about the adequacy of the amount offered in the
highest tender for purchase of the stocks. Therefore, instead of accepting
any of the tender submitted, it invited all the tenderers to participate in
negotiations which were held on 9th June, 1998. The respondent refused to
revise the rates offered in its tender which was Rs.245/- per quintal for
sending lots of the stock. The highest offer received by the appellant during
the course of negotiation was Rs.275.72 per quintal. In these circumstances,
the appellant decided to award the contract to the person who had made the
highest offer in the negotiations to which even the respondent had been
invited.
This action was impugned by the respondent byway of a writ
petition before the High Court contending that the action of the appellant in
rejecting the highest tender was arbitrary and not subsistence, therefore
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Inasmuch as the words of the
Apex Court are extremely instructive, it becomes necessary to notice them
in extenso :-

231

WP(C) No.10685/2004

“7. In contractual sphere as in all other State actions,
the State and all its instrumentalities have to conform
to Article 14 of the Constitution of which nonarbitrariness is a significant facet. There is no
unfettered discretion in public law: A public authority
possesses powers only to use them for public good.
This imposes the duty to act fairly and to adopt a
procedure which is ‘fairplay in action’. Due
observance of this obligation as a part of good
administration raises a reasonable or legitimate
expectation in every citizen to be treated fairly in his
interaction with the State and its instrumentalities,
with this element forming a necessary component of
the decision-making process in all State actions. To
satisfy this requirement of non-arbitrariness in a State
action, it is, therefore, necessary to consider and give
due weight to the reasonable or legitimate
expectations of the persons likely to be affected by
the decision or else that unfairness in the exercise of
the power may amount to an abuse or excess of power
apart from affecting the bona fides of the decision in
a given case. The decision so made would be exposed
to challenge on the ground of arbitrariness. Rule of
law does not completely eliminate discretion in the
exercise of power, as it is unrealistic, but provides for
control of its exercise by judicial review.
8. The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a
citizen, in such a situation, may not by itself be a
distinct enforceable right, but failure to consider and
give due weight to it may render the decision
arbitrary, and this is how the requirement of due
consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part
of the principle of non-arbitrariness, a necessary
concomitant of the rule of law. Every legitimate
expectation is a relevant factor requiring due
consideration in a fair decision-making process.
Whether the expectation of the claimant is reasonable
or legitimate in the context is a question of fact in
each case. Whenever the question arises, it is to be
determined not according to the claimant’s perception
but in larger public interest wherein other more
important considerations may outweigh what would
otherwise have been the legitimate expectation of the
claimant. A bona fide decision of the public authority
reached in this manner would satisfy the requirement
of non-arbitrariness and withstand judicial scrutiny.
The doctrine of legitimate expectation gets
assimilated in the rule of law and operates in our legal
system in this manner and to this extent.

10. From the above, it is clear that even though the
highest tenderer can claim no right to have his tender
accepted, there being a power while inviting tenders
to reject all the tenders, yet the power to reject all the
tenders cannot be exercised arbitrarily and must
depend for its validity on the existence of cogent
reasons for such action. The object of inviting tenders
for disposal of a commodity is to procure the highest
price while giving equal opportunity to all the
intending bidders to compete. Procuring the highest
price for the commodity is undoubtedly in public
interest since the amount so collected goes to the
public fund. Accordingly, inadequacy of the price
offered in the highest tender would be a cogent
ground for negotiating with the tenderers giving them
equal opportunity to revise their bids with a view to
obtain the highest available price. The inadequacy
may be for several reasons known in the commercial
field. Inadequacy of the price quoted in the highest
tender would be a question of fact in each case.
Retaining the option to accept the highest tender, in
case the negotiations do not yield a significantly
higher offer would be fair to the tenderers besides
protecting the public interest. A procedure wherein
resort is had to negotiations with the tenderers for
obtaining a significantly higher bid during the period
when the offers in the tenders remain open for
acceptance and rejection of the tenders only in the
event of a significant higher bid being obtained
during negotiations would ordinarily satisfy this
requirement. This procedure involves giving due
weight to the legitimate expectation of the highest
bidder to have his tender accepted unless outbid by a
higher offer, in which case acceptance of the highest
offer within the time the offers remain open would be
a reasonable exercise of power for public good.
After so observing, the court held that the respondents highest
tender was superceded only by a significantly higher bid made during
negotiation with all tenderers giving them equal opportunity to compete by
revising their bids. The fact that it was a significantly higher bid obtained
by adopting this course is sufficient in the facts of the present case to
demonstrate that the action of the appellant was requirement of nonarbitrariness and it was taken for the cogent reason of inadequacy of the

233

WP(C) No.10685/2004

price offered in the highest tender, which reason was evident to all tenderers
invited to participate in the negotiation and to revise their bids.
In these circumstances, the action of the appellant was proved by
the Apex Court.
251.

In AIR 1996 SC 51 Sterling Computers Limited v. M.N.

Publications Limited & Ors., the court once again emphasised the
restriction on the court while exercising the power of judicial review in
respect of contracts entered into on behalf of the state. The Apex Court
reiterated that in judicial review the court was concerned primarily as to
whether there had been any infirmity in the jurisdiction making process. By
way of judicial review, the court cannot examine the details of the terms of
the contract which had been entered into by the public bodies or the state.
The court had inherent limits on the scope of such enquiry. The court held
that the scope of enquiry could relate to examination as to whether “decision
making process” was reasonable, rational not arbitrary and violative of
article 14 of the Constitution. If the contract had been entered into without
ignoring the basic procedure which can be said to be basic in industry and
after an objective consideration of different options available, taking into
account the interest of the state and the public, then the court cannot act as a
appellate authority by substituting its opinion in respect of selection made
for entering into such a contract. But, once the procedure adopted by an
authority for the purpose of entering into the contract is held to be against
the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution, the court cannot ignore such

234

WP(C) No.10685/2004

action saying that the authorities concerned must be such latitude or liberty
in contractual matters and non-interference by the court amounts to
encouragement on the exclusive right of the executive to take such decision.
In this case, the MTNL had awarded a contract to the contractors
to print directories who had the right to collect the revenue from the
advertisement in the directory. The contractor was to print the directories
and supply the same from all cost to the MTNL for its subscribers and had
to pay royalty to the MTNL in connection with the printing of such
directories. Tenders for publication of the directories were invited and the
contract was granted for publication of directories for five years (1987 1991). the royalty to be paid by the contractor to the MTNL was fixed at
Rs.20.16 crores. The contractor miserably failed to publish the directories.
The board of MTNL considered the default made by the contractor in
publishing the directories, took the note of the fact that the contractor
(difficulties relating to finances) into financial and cash flow. The banks
who had advanced the loans to them had not yet receive back the payments.
Paper mills were not willing to supply paper on credit. The printing presses
were also not prepared to print the directories without getting advance
payments. In these circumstances, the board of directors considered the
three options as follows:
“The Board considered the three options
(i) to invoke the penalty clause and print the
Directory by the MTNL at the risk and cost of the
contractor, (ii) to provide the necessary loan secured
or unsecured to print the directories, (iii) to terminate
the contract and award the work to some other
235

WP(C) No.10685/2004

contractor. However considering the fact that if the
contract was terminated and a decision was taken to
go in for a fresh tender the following problems may
arise (i) contractor may put legal obstacles in
retendering, (ii) the response for printing and
delivering the directories free of cost and also paying
royalty may be poor from the parties, considering the
failure of the present experiment and prohibitive
increase in the cost of paper and printing,(iii) the
concept of the yellow pages may suffer a big set back
and may make it unattractive to the advertisers
because of the loss of confidence the Board entered
into a supplemental agreement with the contractor.
Under the supplemental agreement the original
contract was extended and work of publishing
directories for 5 more years was given to the
contractor. The additional royalty to be paid by the
contractor was only Rs.10 crores.”
In these facts, the court held that the supplement agreement was
really a fresh agreement with fresh terms and conditions which has been
entered to benefit the parties who are admittedly defaulters. The MTNL has
applied the “irrelevant considerations” doctrtine while granting a fresh
contract for a period of five years through the supplemntal agreement
because it has failed to observe the rule of inviting tenders while granting
the contract for a further period of five years on fresh terms and conditions
and has for executing supplemental agreement taken into account irrelevant
considerations. The “decision making process” before the supplemental
agreement was entered into canot be said to be consistent with the
requirement of Art. 14 of the Constitution. In such a situation there is no
scope for argument that any interference by Court shall amount to an
intervention like a Court of appeal. Once the process, through which the
supplemental agreement was executed, is held to be against the mandate of

236

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Art. 14 of the Constitution, the supplemental agreement shall be deemed to
be void. It would be useful to notice the observations of the Apex Court in
para 29 of the judgment which went into the consideration of the
constitutional validity of the action of the MTNL which reads thus :-

252.

“29.
Philanthropy is no part of the management of
an undertaking, while dealing with contractor entrusted
with the execution of a contract. The supply of the
directories to public in time, was a public service which
was being affected by the liberal attitude of the MTNL
and due to the condonation of delay on the part of he
MTNL to become benevolent by entering into the
supplemental agreement with no apparent benefit to the
MTNL, without inviting fresh tenders from intending
persons to perform the same job for the next five yars.
Public authorities are essentially different from those of
private persons. Even while taking decision in respect
of commercial transactions a public authority mut be
guided by relevant considerations and not by irrelevant
ones. If such decision is influenced by extraneous
considerations which it ought not to have taken into
account the ultimate decision is bound to be vitiated,
even if it is established that such decision had been
taken without bias. The contract awarded for the
publication of the directories had not only a commercial
object but had a public element at the same time, i.e. to
supply the directories to lacs of subscribers of
telephones in Delhi and Bombay, every year within the
stipulated time free of cost. In such a situation MTNL
could not exdrcise an unfettered discretion after the
repeated breaches committed by UIP/UDI, by entering
into a supplemental agreement with the Sterling for a
fresh period of more than five years on terms which
were only beneficial to UIP/UDI/Sterling with
corresponding no benefit to MTNL, which they have
realised only after the High Court went into the matter
in detail in its judgment under appeal.”
Therefore, from a close reading of the foregoing judgments it is

well settled that open competitive bidding has been mandated in compliance
of the requirement to ensure non-arbitrariness, fairness, reasonableness and

237

WP(C) No.10685/2004

transparency in procedure of award of contracts.
However, this ordinary rule is not an invariable rule.

It is

permissible to depart therefrom only for compelling reasons, considerations
of public interest and in furtherance of the directive principles as enshrined
in the Constitution.
253.

In the instant case, there is no dispute that the CTCs are property

of the MCD. In their allotment, therefore, the MCD is concerned with a
decision to allot public property. It therefore, is necessary to examine the
manner in which public property can be disposed of or dealt with.
254.

So far as the disposal of public property is concerned, there are

several enactments which confer the power on authorities to dispose of
property which is taken over from its debtors. The principles laid down by
the Apex Court upon the manner in which the financial corporation will
exercise jurisdiction to dispose of the property, would throw some light on
the issues raised before this court.

The Apex Court had occasion to

consider the manner in which the Corporation ought to act under Section 29
of the State Financial Corporation Act.
255.

The Apex Court in its pronouncement reported at (2005) 4 SCC

456 Karnataka State Industrial Investment and Development Corporation
Limited v. Cavetel India Limited inter alia held thus :“19.
From the aforesaid, the legal
principles that emerge are:
i) The High Court while exercising its jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution dos not sit as an
appellate authority over the acts and deeds of the
Financial Corporation and seek to correct them. The
238

WP(C) No.10685/2004

doctrine of fairness does not convert the writ courts
into appellate authorities over administrative
authorities.
ii) In a matter between the Corporation and its debtor, a
writ court has no say except in two situations:
(a)
there is a statutory violation on the part of the
Corporation, or
(b)
Where the Corporation acts unfairly i.e.
unreasonably.
iii)In commercial matters, the courts should not risk
their judgments for the judgments of the bodies to
which that task is assigned.
iv)Unless the action of the Financial Corporation is mala
fide, even a wrong decision taken by it is not open to
challenge. It is not for the courts or a third party to
substitute its decision, however, more prudent,
commercial or businesslike it may be, for the decision
of the Financial Corporation. Hence, whatever the
wisdom (or the lack of it) of the conduct of the
Corporation , the same cannot be assailed for making
the Corporation liable.
v) In the matter of sale of public property, the dominant
consideration is to secure the best price for the
property to be sold and this could be achieved only
when there is maximum public participation in the
process of sale and everybody has an opportunity of
making an offer.
vi)Public auction is not the only mode to secure the best
price by inviting maximum public participation,
tender and negotiation could also be adopted.
vii)The Financial Corporation is always expected to try
and realise the maximum sale price by selling the
assets by following a procedure which is transparent
and acceptable, after due publicity, wherever possible
and if any reason is indicated or cause shown for the
default, the same has to be considered in its proper
perspective and a conscious decision has to be taken
as to whether action under Section 29 of the Act is
called for. Thereafter, the modalities for disposal of
the seized unit have to be worked out.
viii)Fairness cannot be a one-way street. The fairness
required of the Financial Corporations cannot be
carried to the extent of disabling them form
recovering what is due to them. While not insisting
upon the borrower to honour the commitments
undertaken by him, the Financial Corporation alone
239

WP(C) No.10685/2004

256.

cannot be shackled hand and foot in the name of
fairness.
Reasonableness is to be tested against the dominant
consideration to secure the best price.”
The following observations of the Apex Court in (2004) 11 SCC

485 Jasper I. Slong v. State of Meghalaya & Ors. are topical and also
instructive :-

257.

“19.
It goes without saying that the Government
while entertaining into contracts is expected not to act
like a private individual but should act in conformity
with certain healthy standards and norms. Such
actions should not be arbitrary, irrational or irrelevant.
The awarding of contracts by inviting tenders is
considered to be one of the fair methods. If there are
any reservations or restrictions then they should not
be arbitrary and must be justifiable on the basis of
some policy or valid principles which by themselves
should be reasonable and not discriminatory. (See
para 7 of Hindustan Development case.). The said
judgment also states that any act which excluded
competition from any part of the trade or commerce
by forming cartels should not be permitted.”
Mr. Valmiki Mehta, learned senior counsel appearing for MCD

has forcefully argued that this court in exercise of its jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India can examine the challenge to MCD's
action only from the angle of scrutinising as whether the decision was based
on relevant material or whether it irrelevant considerations had gone into
the same. There can be no dispute that so long as there is some material in
existence before the authority which took the decision in its support, then
the same cannot be assailed.
This court has been called upon to examine a decision to allot all
CTCs to a single organisation without taking recourse to the open
competitive bidding process. At the same time, the decision to rescind all
240

WP(C) No.10685/2004

contracts with the CTCs is under challenge.
The MCD has taken an absolute position to the effect that all the
NGOs are defaulters and incapable and only Sulabh is capable of providing
the service.
For these reasons, it has become necessary to examine the factual
matrix and the material on record in some detail.
258.

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi before this court has failed

to inform the petitioners of their deficiencies. No notice or show cause
notice has been issued to them. No intimation of their default in respect of
payment of the licence fee has been intimated. Even at the time, the matter
went to hearing, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi was not in a position to
state as to which petitioner was defaulting in which CTC or the exact
amount which was due and payable. The petitioners had no intimation of
the action which was being contemplated agaisnt them. They were not
given any opportunity or information with regard to the proposal of the
MCD to hand over the CTCs to Sulabh. No petitioner was put to notice of
the terms and basis on which the allotment was contemplated to Sulabh nor
was any offer sought from them on this basis. The MCD has not paid any
attention as to the functioning and conduct of those NGOs who were not
defaulters. It has not been urged that the action of the MCD was motivated
by any of the directive principle or any of the provisions of the Constitution
in varying the normal rule of the allocation of the CTCs by public auction or
tender which procedure was adopted on the earlier occasion after a detailed

241

WP(C) No.10685/2004

situation of the functioning of the CTCs. Apart from a bald assertion that
the action of the MCD was reasonable and fair inasmuch as it was based on
past experience and the reputation of Sulabh, no other justification for the
deviation from the general rule and a tenable reason for procedure adopted
has been placed before this court.
259.

MCD has sought to strongly defend its action and has urged that

the writ petitions are mala fide. It has been submitted that the CTCs has
been recently constructed and there could have been practical/teething
difficulties in not more than which ‘each of the complexes’. It is further
urged that the ‘defects, if any were of such a nature that they would have
rendered functioning of the CTC impossible’.

MCD admits that the

‘petitioner took over the possession after writing ‘taken over subject to
rectification of deficiency’ on the handing over taking over of possession
notes.’ It also accepts that there was, ‘fair recording of minutes’ in the
various meetings.
260.

However, writ large in the face of these submissions is the fact

that even at the time when the matter was being argued, MCD could not pin
point as to which were the CTCs which were non-functional on the date
possession thereof was handed over to the NGOs or when it was decided to
cancel the contracts. It cannot be disputed that the MCD had sent special
staff to execute of the Yamuna Action Plan and also had a huge
infrastructure of engineering staff. MCD had also appointed field monitors
in respect of specific community toilet complexes. Yet even at the time

242

WP(C) No.10685/2004

when the writ petition was in the final stages of hearing, it has no material
in its power and possession in support of its case. Perusal of the report of
the Sub-Committee appointed by the standing committee shows that it has
really endorsed the proposal of the Commissioner as contained in the letter
dated 19th July, 2004 without any further material placed before it.
261.

The principal stand on behalf of the respondent-MCD is that the

Standing Committee; the statutory sub-committee and the Full House of the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi are statutory authorities and their decision
is not open to judicial review by this court. It is vehemently urged that the
sub-committee approved handing over of only the non-functional CTCs and
the executive wing enlarged the scope of the decision to 1963 CTCs.
However, as noticed hereinabove, this is not so.
262.

On 3rd January, 2004, without any material on record and without

the MCD taking any of the series of steps required to be taken as per
meetings held in 2003, the Commissioner of the MCD decided to hand over
the non-functional CTCs to Sulabh. Sulabh demanded all the CTCs under
the YAP. On 30th April, 2004, the MCD decided to hand additional CTCs
to it on as is where is basis. On 21st June, 2004, a decision was taken to
conduct a joint inspection from 1st July, 2004 to 31st July, 2004 and that
MCD would bear the cost of repairs to be conducted by Sulabh.
263.

From the above discussion, it is evident that therefore, the reason

for cancellation of the contracts of the petitioners and handing over of the
1963 CTCs to Sulabh is not based on any consideration of defaults on the

243

WP(C) No.10685/2004

part of the petitioners or of efficacy or reputation of Sulabh or on the basis
of default of the operating agencies or past experience of the MCD, but on
the pure dictate of Sulabh that taking over only 349 non-functional CTCs on
as is where is basis was not viable.
264.

While considering the decisions being taken, it is necessary to

bear in mind that the construction of the CTCs under the Yamuna Action
plan was undertaken as late as in 2002 only under the explicit, close
supervision and monitoring by the MCD. Yet even in 2004, the MCD is
considering major defects and structural defects as well as rectification.
265.

As per the figures brought on record, MCD incurred a total cost

of construction of 959 CTCs of approximately Rs.145 crores. Against
these, after a period of not even of two years, upon the joint inspection
conducted by the MCD and Sulabh, an estimate has been arrived at for
effecting repair and maintenance of the 325 complexes is to the tune of
between Rs.45 to 60 crores. It must be noted that this amount is not to be
spent by Sulabh but to be paid by MCD to Sulabh as per the decision
noticed hereinabove.
This huge amount of money is to be expended out of public
funds on effecting repairs and rectifications including “structural defects” in
CTCs which are not even two years old and some of which have not been
even admittedly operated.
266.

It is also necessary to note that the provision of sanitation and

the toilet facilities has been urged to be an obligatory duty of the Municipal

244

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Corporation of Delhi.

Therefore, on the showing of the respondents

themselves, by this decision, the MCD has completely abdicated its
obligatory duty to Sulabh.
267.

The Standing Committee had suggested that the CTCs be made

operated on free of charge basis. Three hundred and fifty seven CTCs were
being operated and maintained by the MCD on free of charge basis which
were purely in public interest. There is no complaint in respect of these
CTCs from either the public or from the MCD. None of the authorities
involved in the decision making either the Commissioner or the Standing
committee or the Full house of the Corporation even considered this aspect
of the matter let alone dwelt on it at any length.
268.

Before this court, the principal plea urged in support of the

decision taken is the fact that the earlier mode of allotment envisaged a dual
responsibility. The second principle ground which has been urged more
forcibly is that all the other NGOs were fly by night operators who were all
defaulters. The default in their functioning and lack of financial discipline is
stated to be one of the principle reason that MCD took the decision to hand
over all the CTCs to Sulabh. It has been vehemently and repeatedly urged
that because of their default, public interest was suffering and the purpose
for having constructed these CTCs was not being achieved.
Such an argument can only be supported by material which was
placed before the decision making authority. Even though, the MCD was
aware of the challenge having been made and the action taken by it, still no

245

WP(C) No.10685/2004

material was placed before the authorities to support this reason which has
been urged before this court.
269.

The Sub-Committee also did not even bother to take the

assistance of the services of any expert agency or appoint any monitoring
agency to ascertain the ground realities and the factual position. Even the
report of the field monitors which ought to have been in the power and
possession of the MCD does not appear to have been taken into
consideration. The Sub-Committee, unlike the previous Sub-Committee,
did not inspect any of the CTCs prior to submission of its report.
270.

Along with the letter dated 19th July, 2004, of the Commissioner

of the MCD, even a draft memorandum of understanding was forwarded.
Therefore, the entire exercise of appointment of the sub-committee and to
obtain some type of a report appears to have been undertaken only with the
intention of creating a semblance of application of mind and due regard to
the relevant facts on the part of the MCD. This was clearly a crude exercise
consciously undertaken with knowledge that this court was in seisin of the
matter and show cause notice had been issued.
271.

The MCD maintained a huge staff under what was known as the

sanitation wing. For the purposes of discharge of its duty in operating and
maintaining the CTCs which were under its control. Undoubtedly, the MCD
would be maintaining a huge paraphernalia of engineering staff as well as
workers including sweepers, cleaners etc. Such employees of the MCD
deployed at the CTCs would be rendered without a posting and assignment

246

WP(C) No.10685/2004

once Sulabh had taken over the running the CTCs. This work force would
be rendered redundant and the MCD would be compelled to bear the
expense of salary of such work force without any work being performed by
them.
272.

Thus the decision changed at the stage of the consideration of

the Commissioner as on 3rd January, 2004 and 30th April, 2004. No SubCommittee examined the proposed change in the model agreement
suggested by the previous sub-committee.

No financial parameters or

quantification of expenses or examination thereof by any financial and
technical experts was undertaken. The Memorandum of Understanding was
also drafted without any examination of the earlier agreement and put forth
with the letter dated 19th July, 2004.

This was approved without

consideration of any of the financial and revenue implications. Without
assessing the liability in undertaking repairs, the MCD has taken on such
tremendous responsibility.
273.

It has been further vehemently contended that the decision to

hand over all the CTCs to a single agency is a new policy decision of the
MCD which involves no dual responsibility and no expenditure of the
MCD. According to Mr. Valmiki Mehta, learned senior counsel for the
MCD, it has only total administration control with a no fault termination
clause.
274.

Unfortunately, this submission is based on a pure mis-

conception as to what would amount to a ‘policy decision’. As discussed

247

WP(C) No.10685/2004

above, the policy decision involved engagement of private agencies for the
operation and maintenance of CTCs as against their operation and
maintenance by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.

The considered

decision which was taken was that the allocation of the CTCs must be by a
competitive biding process resulting in invitation of tenders after vide
publicity in the newspapers.
However,

decision

was

taken

at

the

instance

of

the

Commissioner of the MCD initially to hand over non-functional CTCs to
Sulabh which was expanded at the instance of Sulabh to handing over of the
CTCs under the Yamuna Action Plan. It is noteworthy that even Sulabh
merely demanded handing over of only the 959 CTCs under the Yamuna
Action Plan which was extended by the MCD to 1963 CTCs.

These

included CTCs in respect of which there was no complaint and which were
running smoothly without any default. These also included such CTCs
which were being run by the MCD itself without any default. Such decision
cannot be termed as a `policy decision' which cannot be examined by the
court in exercise of its powers of judicial review.
275.

It also emerges from the aforenoticed facts and circumstances

that MCD has all along accepted that large number of the CTCs were nonfunctional; that they were non-functional because of basic structural defects;
that the civil contractors who constructed the CTCs were responsible in a
big way for the faults in the CTCs; that this position was admitted by the
MCD even in the background note sent by it to the central government

248

WP(C) No.10685/2004

giving an explanation as to why CTCs were not functioning; this fact was
also accepted in the various joint meetings as well as the various
communications thereto and therefore in the reply sent by MCD to the
queries raised by Mr. Vijender Kumar Gupta in his letter of 28 th July, 2004.
This position was also accepted by the Commissioner of the MCD when he
recorded the note on 3rd January, 2004. It is in court for the first time that
all the NGOs to whom the CTCs were allotted have been labled as
defaulters and fly by night operators.
276.

It would be useful to also examine the licence fee payment

position of some of the petitioners. The petitioners have placed a tabulation
before this court in the course of hearing on 2 nd February, 2005 with regard
to the licence fee which has been paid by them. M/s Himalayan Institute of
Pollution Control & Social and Economic Development, petitioner in
W.P.(C). 11865/2004, has submitted that it was allotted a total of 19 CTCs.
Out of these, 103 were under the Slum & JJ Department while nine were
under the Yamuna Action Plan. The petitioners contends that nine of the
CTCs were non-functional when the allocation was made. The petitioner
has contended that it has rendered eight of the CTCs functional by spending
Rs. 3 lakhs approximately and as on 22nd January, 2005, 18 of the CTCs are
functional, only 1 CTC was non-functional due to non user and it being
situated in a field in a village. This petitioner contends that approximately
16 lakhs would be the total licence fee payable in respect of the CTCs
allocated to it. The petitioner has admittedly paid Rs.11 lakhs and is entitled

249

WP(C) No.10685/2004

to adjustment of the expenditure incurred in making the CTCs functional. It
has invoked arbitration proceedings in respect of 2 of the CTCs. It has
therefore been urged that there are no dues against the CTCs which have
been allocated to it.
M/s Dalit Manav Uthan Sansthan, petitioner in W.P.(C) No.
11857/2004 has submitted that it was allocated 18 CTCs all under the
Yamuna Action Plan. All the 18 CTCs were non-functional when the
allocation was made. The petitioner contends that it has expended
approximately Rs.9,71,161/- and had thereby made 12 of the

CTCs

However on 27th January, 2005, only 11 CTCs were non-

functional.

functional while 7 were not. Some of the reasons which have been set out
include the admitted position that the site of the Rajiv Gandhi Smiriti Van
became non-functional from 17th August, 2000 due to non-availability of
electricity, choking of sewer lines and failure of the tubewell bore. The
CTC at the Zoo site was not available. Five CTCs were non-functional due
to non-functioning of the sewer line, electric short-circuiting and failure of
the tubewell bore. According to this petitioner, the total licence fee payable
in respect of the functional CTCs would be Rs. 19,99,192/- The petitioner
has actually paid a sum of RS.13,27,452/- It is entitled to the expenditure
which it has incurred on the non-functional CTCs which are to the tune of
RS.9,71,161/- According to the petitioner, as on 27th January, 2005, it has a
credit balanace of Rs.2,99,461/- with the MCD.
Akhil Bhartiya Manav Seva Sansthan, has filed W.P.(C) No.

250

WP(C) No.10685/2004

12142/2004.

It was allocated twenty CTCs.

All twenty were non-

functional at the time of allocation. The petitioner has spent approximately
Rs.6,42,800/- in making 14 of the CTCs functional. As on 27th January,
2005, only 13 of the CTCs were functional. It has given the reason for the 7
CTCs being non-functional. Three of the CTCs were non-functional due to
failure of the boring in the tubewell; one CTC stood encroached by the
villagers; in one CTC the sever line was completely choked apart from other
reasons and in two CTCs no electricity has been provided out of which one
was not even handed over. This petitioner has claimed that it has made
payment of licence fee to the MCD to the tune of approximately Rs.7 lakhs
and after adjustments of the expenditure incurred by it in making the CTCs
functional, the MCD has a credit balance of Rs.42,800/- in favour of this
petitioner.
277.

This information was furnished in court after service of a copy

thereof to the other side. The MCD has not placed before this court any
information or record as to what has been received by it from the various
allottees.
278.
court.

The other petitioners have also placed such facts before the
The several joint meetings held in 2003 and heretofore noticed

several issues relating to postponement of the dates from which payments
were to commence. Certain issues relating to reduction in the amounts
which were to be payable towards electricity etc were also pending decision
by the competent authority. More importantly, not a single notice under

251

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Clause 15.5 to any NGO had been issued.
279.

If the facts stated by the petitioners on record are correct, then it

certainly cannot be contended that the petitioners were 'fly by night'
operators as they have been labled by the respondents or that the experience
of the MCD with the petitioners was such as to render them unfit to operate
or maintain the CTCs. The MCD has not placed a single complaint from
any user on record. There is not even a single complaint by its field
monitors or the executive engineers or the other engineers of the MCD
against any of these petitioners on court record. There is not a single letter
communicated to these petitioners that they are defaulters in making
payment of the licence fee disentitling them to operate or maintain the CTC.
There was no material to such effect before the Commissioner of the MCD
when the decision was taken on 3rd June, 2004 or when the communication
dated 19th July, 2004 was addressed by him or before the standing
committee. Even the sub committee appointed by the MCD on 22nd July,
2004, did not have any such material before it. There was even no material
to any such effect even before the Full House of the MCD when it
considered the matter on 25th October, 2004.
On the contrary the admitted position is that as late in 2004, the
accounts of the MCD for the years 2002, 2003 were not ready.
280.

So far as complaints made by some of the petitioners to the MCD

regarding the non-functional CTCs are concerned, the petitioners M/s
Himalayan Institute of Pollution Control & Social and Economic

252

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Development has placed before this court its letters dated 31st July, 2002,
dated 6th August, 2002, dated 9th October, 2002, 18th December, 2002, 10th
December, 2002, 20th December, 2002, December 2000 and even as late as
on 3rd April, 2003. This letter records that the petitioners have knocked at
every door in the MCD for completion of the project which included both
civil and electrical components and handing over the complex for operation
for the use of public. No steps have been taken even though the petitioner
had deposited the security amount and the licence fee in advance as
required. The communications of MCD placed on record show general
letters making vague assertions without dealing with the specific
deficiencies pointed out by the petitioner.
281.

M/s Dalit Manav Seva Sansthan, petitioner in W.P.(C) No.

11875/2004 also similarly addressed letters to the MCD dated 17th July,
2002, 30th July, 2002, 6th January, 2004 which have been placed before this
court.
Similarly, M/s Akhil Bhartiya Manav Seva Sansthan, petitioner
in W.P.(C) No. 12142/2004 had made repeated complaints to the MCD inter
alia dated 7th July, 2002, 26th July, 2002, 13th May, 2003 and 20th May, 2004
which have been annexed by the writ petition. The communications of the
MCD, again, are general circulars, which do not address the specific
complaints of the petitioners.
282.

In the written submissions filed by MCD, it has been pointed out

that it has filed three affidavits, two written submissions, one status report,

253

WP(C) No.10685/2004

three charts showing what according to it are the licence fee dues. It is
noteworthy that none of these affidavits show any details or quantification
of either amounts paid by the petitioner in terms of the dates on which they
were due or the dates on which they were paid. There is no assessment or
quantification with regard to the expenditure incurred on construction of
CTCs other than the 959 CTCs or the cost being incurred by the MCD
thereon. No material has been placed before this court with regard to the
revenue which was being generated from many of the CTCs. There is no
figure placed before this court by the MCD of the total amount received as
security from the various NGOs to whom the 959 CTCs of the Yamuna
Action Plan were allocated. The MCD admits receipt of some amounts
running into lakhs of rupees from the other CTCs. However, no decision in
terms of the proposals made in the meetings placed on record herein have
been placed before this court. No official from the MCD has bothered to
verify or rectify the defects which were being pointed out by the NGOs
which were admittedly in existence for a long period of almost two years
since the same were allocated to the NGOs. Even the note dated 3rd January,
2004 of the Commissioner of the MCD, whereby it was decided to hand
over non-functioning CTCs to Sulabh records that they suffer from several
defects.
283.

It is noteworthy that the MCD in the writ petitions has placed

reliance on the survey which it has conducted with Sulabh International in
July, 2004 to contend that the CTCs were functional and that the petitioners

254

WP(C) No.10685/2004

were earning revenue from the CTCs. Such a submission completely ignores
the principle contention of the petitioners that they have spent moneys on
the non-functional CTCs and have rendered them functional. The reliance
of the MCD on the survey conducted in July, 2004 with Sulabh supports the
contentions of the petitioners that the large number of the CTCs were nonfunctional and suffering from structural defects. It is an admitted position
in the various meetings which have been placed on record by the petitioners
wherein the senior officers of the MCD accepted the fact that there were
several structural defects and other reasons for the CTCs were not
functional. Infact this was even accepted by the

Commissioner of the

MCD when he recorded the minutes dated 3rd January, 2004 and took the
decision to hand over 389 non-functional CTCs to Sulabh International.
Perusal of the handing over notes relied upon by the MCD to submit that the
CTCs were in working condition in fact shows that in most of these notes,
the NGOs have recorded the defects including the fact that power
connections and gensets were not provided as yet.
284.

So far as the payment of security amount and licence fee is

concerned, MCD does not dispute that it has received the security deposit
from the NGOs/agencies to whom the CTCs were allocated. So far as the
payment of licence fee is concerned, the MCD does appear to have received
some amounts. Some of the petitioners have placed, what according to
them stands paid.
Writ petitioner Himalayan Institute of Pollution Control and

255

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Social and Economic Development (W.P.(C) No. 11865/2004) has
contended that out of the total 19 CTCs allotted to it, nine of which were
under the Yamuna Action Plan, all these CTCs were non-functional at the
time of allocation. Eight have been made functional by it by spending its
own moneys. The total licence fee payable according to it in respect of the
functional CTCs was 16 lakhs. It claims to have spent an amount of Rs. 3
lakhs in making the CTC functional and claims to have paid an amount of
Rs.11 lakhs approximately towards licence fee to the MCD.
285.

Dalit Manav Uthan Sansthan, petitioner in W.P.(C) 11857/2004

similarly has contended that all the 18 CTCs allocated to it under the
Yamuna Action Plan, were non-functional when allocation was made. This
petitioner contends that it had made 12 of the CTCs functional out of its
own funds. It contends that total licence fee payable by it in respect of the
functional CTCs was to the tune of Rs.19,99,152/- This petitioner has
submitted that it has made an expenditure of Rs.9,71,161/- in making the
CTCs functional. According to it, it has paid an amount of Rs.13,27,452/to the MCD. It repudiates all liability to bear the expense of rendering the
CTCs functional and has claimed that in fact it had a credit balance with the
MCD of Rs.2,99,461/- If the expenditure incurred by it on making the
CTCs functional is excluded.
286.

Akhil Bhartiya Manav Sewa Sansthan, writ petitioner in W.P.(C)

12142/2004 has contended that out of the 20 CTCs allotted to it, all 20 were
non-functional at the time of allocation.

256

By spending an amount of

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Rs.6,42,800/-, it has been able to make 14 of the CTCs functional. Total
licence fee payable in respect of the functional CTCs came to Rs.13 lakh
and it has paid an amount of Rs. 7 lakh to the MCD. Claiming entitlement
to adjustment of the expenditure incurred by it in making the CTCs
functional, it has claimed that it is entitled to arrears of Rs.42,800/- from the
MCD.
287.

This information was furnished in court after service of a copy

thereof to the other side. The MCD has not placed before this court record
as to what has been received by it from the various allottees.
288.

During the course of hearing, bald total figures of what is stated

to be allegedly due to the MCD in respect of the petitioners have been
placed in a tabulation without a reflection as to the date on which the
amount became due, the CTCs in respect of which they were due and the
dates on which the payments were made.
The petitioners have challenged these figures and have placed
their own calculation enclosing receipts issued by MCD in respect of the
payments actually made by them.
289.

Against this, even in the submissions placed before this court on

22nd August, 2005, the MCD points out that it has clarified that “there are
clerical errors as to the computation (as bills/receipts may not have been
received from the concerned department from the engineers at the time of
the computation) the same would be corrected on an individual basis as and
when pointed out”. The MCD has further stated that “Even assuming that

257

WP(C) No.10685/2004

there is a margin of error at the time of preparation of the status report, the
total arrears due are to the tune of 8.5 crores”’ ; “financial computation of
arrears for all may have been done from the initial date of handing over of
the 18 complexes”’ ; “computational errors would be corrected as and when
brought to the notice of the corporation”’. The MCD has thus levelled nonspecific allegations of generalities and contradictions to the cases of the
petitioners completely losing sight of the fact that

it is a statutory

organization with a huge infrastructure of engineering staff, accounting staff
and legal assistance. In todays era of computing, accounting systems reduce
complicated figures and accounting to child's play and accessible by the
mere pressing of a key on a keyboard. This is more so when payments of a
determinate sum of money are to be made periodically, so that dues and
payments are merely not to be reflected in three columns, one containing a
debit; the other the credit entries and the third column, the balance, without
any further application of mind. There is no question of ‘computational
errors’ on the part of a statutory authority. The submissions on behalf of the
MCD are preposterous more so when it has taken such pleas to support a
contention that relevant material was placed before the Commissioner, the
Standing Committee, the Sub-committee and the Full House of the MCD so
as to enable them to term and lable all the NGOs as defaulters. These
figures thus would relate to the period from around the end of December,
2003 till October, 2004 while it has been filing these tabulations and charts
till August, 2005 in court. To say the least, conveyance of information

258

WP(C) No.10685/2004

today does not require manual handing over of the same but can be
transmitted on computers from the various zones where the engineering
staff is located to the accounting section where the same had to be compiled.
Therefore, the computation errors of nominal, trivial or of insignificant
magnitude would be left based in the realm of conjectures. The position
however assumes significance when the tabulations placed by the MCD
before this court were, on its own showing, wholly incorrect and certainly
insufficient to enable MCD to label each and every NGO, which had
participated in the tendering process and was operating and maintaining the
CTCs, as a defaulter. Certainly, it would be most improper to tarnish or
paint all the NGOs black merely because some of the NGOs were defaulting
in the payment.
290.

Undoubtedly, financial discipline was to be maintained.

However, bearing in mind the purpose for which the CTCs had been
constructed and the agreements entered into, their operation and
maintenance assumes even greater importance bearing in mind the larger
public interest. It is MCD’s case itself that the CTCs were not revenue
generating. Then the question as to why the CTCs were not being operated
and maintained required to be examined more closely. It was MCD’s case
in all the meetings held after the possession of the CTCs were handed over
to the NGOs, that large number of CTCs were suffering from structural
defects. So much so, there were recommendations that the security deposit
of the contractors who constructed the CTCs and were not coming forward

259

WP(C) No.10685/2004

to rectify the same, be not paid. Further there were admissions that there
were several CTCs where the septic tanks were not connected to the toilet;
water connections were not available and there was no provision for
electricity as noticed above. These facts were confined by the MCD when it
effected the inspection with Sulabh and agreed to play crores to it for
effecting the repairs. For this reason, the Commissioner without going into
anything more had suggested that non-functioning CTCs be handed over to
Sulabh.
291.

Perhaps

a justification can be found for the fact that the

engineers of the MCD did not notify any of the NGOs nor considered nonpayment as breach in these very reasons and also as several issues including
subsidization towards the charges of electricity; rebate towards the payment
of the licence fee with effect from the date on which the CTCs were
rendered operational were still pending final decision with the competent
authority.
292.

It is also a fact that so far as the CTCs under the MCD's

operation and maintenances are concerned, there was no defect or problem
at all. The public had a larger advantage of these CTCs being available for
usage, free of any charge. Therefore, all the arguments laid in favour of the
handing over of all the CTCs to Sulabh are negated as they are not
supported by the factual matrix. There was neither dual control nor default
in the payments by the MCD in respect of CTCs run by it.

Certainly,

MCD's contention that all the NGOs were defaulters and an inexperienced

260

WP(C) No.10685/2004

'fly by night operator' cannot be accepted.
The CTCs have been constructed on government land and
property. They have been constructed by expending public money. There
can be no manner of dispute that the CTCs are public property constructed
in public interest for the use of public at large.
293.

At this stage, it becomes necessary to deal with the contention

raised by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi which has supported its
decision to enter into a 30 year contract with Sulabh contending that this
was not the first time that the MCD was so doing. Reliance has been placed
on the earlier policy in this behalf. According to the MCD, the earlier CTCs
were constructed by the NGOs at the cost of the MCD. In these contracts,
the maintenance was with the NGOs on pay per use basis while MCD paid
for electricity, water and cleaning of the septic tank.

In the written

submissions which have been handed over to the court which are dated 22 nd
August, 2005, the MCD has submitted that it proposed to hand over to
Sulabh not only those CTCs constructed under the Yamuna Action Plan
which had been constructed by Class I Contractors and handed over to the
NGOs but MCD also proposed to hand over CTCs which were ‘constructed
as early as in 1984’. It has been stated that the only reason why MCD
accepted the condition of one time repair before handing over all CTCs to
Sulabh was that after taking possession, the NGO tried to escape its
obligations by complaining that the CTCs which were handed over to it was
non-functional in the first place and thereby defeat the purpose of the entire

261

WP(C) No.10685/2004

exercise. The MCD has contended that the survey carried away by it with
Sulabh revealed that most of the CTCs were in a functional stage contrary to
the allegation of the NGOs maintaining them.
294.

In so urging, MCD failed to consider that it has agreed to pay

over Rs.45 crores for effecting repairs of the CTCs. In the various minutes
of the meetings which were held between the MCD and NGOs, the Field
Monitors and all the stake holders even in the beginning of 2003 and on 9 th,
10th, 11th, 15th, 17th and 18th of July, 2003, the MCD has noted defects and
the fact that 359 CTCs were non-functional has been admitted even in the
decision taken by the Commissioner on 3rd January, 2004 and in the note
submitted by the MCD to the Central Government. Yet again, MCD is
drawing vague generalizations without reference to any specifics. No such
specific facts or figures were placed before any of the decision making
authorities at the relevant points of time when the decisions were taken.
The submission now made is belied by the exorbitant amount which was
agreed to be paid towards the repairs as also the submissions made through
out the year 2003 and the admissions that structural defects had to be
removed in the CTCs on the part of the MCD officials.

The same is also

amply borne out from the fact that not a single notice to this effect was
addressed by any of the engineers who were in the field and would have
been aware of the actual position. On the contrary the minutes noticed that
security deposit of the contractors should not be paid for the reason that
they were not completing the jobs.

262

WP(C) No.10685/2004

295.

Again there is no consideration or explanation whatsoever in the

records of the MCD as to why those CTCs under the 30 year contract, in
respect of which there was neither any complaint nor could there have been
any default of payment for the reason that no licence fee was payable, were
to be taken over from the persons or organization maning the same and
handed over to Sulabh.
More importantly, there is no explanation as to where was the
occasion or need for cancelling such agreements in respect of which there
was no difficulty, no default and no complaint whatsoever. The MCD has
opted not to take into consideration the loss of revenue which would result
to it by cancellation of such agreements and in view of the expenditure
which was envisaged under the new terms which had been proposed by
Sulabh and which were being agreed by it. The only party benefiting out of
the new agreements would have been Sulabh.
296.

For operating and maintaining these CTCs, Sulabh gets the full

expenditure for effecting such repairs as it deems fit and usage charges from
the public as well as revenue from the advertisement without having to pay
any amount to the MCD for either as security or as licence fee or as any part
of revenue sharing from the advertisements.
The MCD has taken a decision to allot all the CTCs to Sulabh. It
has taken a further decision to cancel the allotment of all the NGOs to
whom the CTCs were allotted. Thereby the MCD has excluded all other
from consideration.

263

WP(C) No.10685/2004

It has also thereby taken a decision not to take recourse to the
method of allotment of the CTCs to Sulabh by open competitive method of
bidding.
297.

Sulabh has filed an affidavit dated 1st August, 2005 contending

that it is the pioneer in the field of provision of community toilet complexes.
It has been submitted that the Sulabh movement was founded in the year
1974 by Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak in the state of Bihar for the liberation of
scavengers and for provision of better sanitation facilities for the general
public. It has been vehemently contended that by adopting the Sulabh
model, the state has been able to effectively discharge its fundamental duty
of providing dignified and hygienic public conveniences to the public at low
cost. Being a public welfare activity and not a commercial profit making
venture, this work has been awarded to Sulabh International by all States
and State agencies on the basis of its experience and parity to complete the
work on the basis of direct negotiation.

Sulabh has contended that it was

invited by the MCD in the year 1986 to Delhi when it was awarded the work
of construction and maintenance of two complexes on the basis of the Patna
model. It was in view of the good engineering and operational services
rendered by Sulabh that MCD allotted more work on 16th August, 1990
resulting in by the year 1992 a total of 126 CTCs which were constructed
and maintained by Sulabh without any complaint.
So far as the complaints against Sulabh are concerned, it has
been contended that the complaints relate to Jan Suvidha Complexes which

264

WP(C) No.10685/2004

were constructed by MCD or other municipal authorities wherein the work
was not properly executed and the same were also not maintained by the
MCD which was responsible for the same. Despite request of the Sulabh to
MCD, no steps to rectify the matter were taken. Sulabh has disputed the
accuracy of the report of the three member committee against it. It has been
submitted that there is no complaint against Sulabh in respect of 206 CTCs
which it is maintaining and operating for the MCD on a thirty year contract
without any license fees.
So far as the credentials of Sulabh are concerned, it has been
urged at great length that Sulabh has a reputation not only on a national
level but is internationally recognised for the work which it is doing, it has
been urged that the works which it is conducting have all been awarded to it
without participating in any tender and it is performing various projects
only by invitation.
298.

On behalf of the Sulabh Organisation, it has been urged that it

is
even operating and maintaining CTC complexes in court complexes in
Delhi and that frivolous, baseless and malicious public interest litigation
which were filed against it in different high courts including Patna,
Himachal Pradesh stand dismissed. Hence, the allegations of the petitioners
against Sulabh as an organisation are without any basis and are wholly
unjustified. Sulabh has placed before this court copies of the decisions
rendered by High courts. The allegations which have been levelled by the

265

WP(C) No.10685/2004

petitioners with regard to the functioning by Sulabh have been vehemently
disputed. It has also been urged that the organisation has no sister concerns
and that the entities being projected as sister concerns of Sulabh are not so.
It has been urged that Sulabh International has given financial aid to sister
concerns of even some of the petitioners including M/s Himalayan Institute
of Pollution Control and Social and Economic Development.

Merely

because Sulabh could have facilitated the functioning of some of the
organisations, financially or technically, it is not in any manner responsible
to or under the control of Sulabh over the functioning of such an
organisation.
299.

Based on a letter dated 16th May, 2002 from the Municipal

Administration and Water Supply Department, Govt. of Tamil Nadu, it is
asserted that a ban was imposed on dealings with Sulabh as they indulged in
sub-standard work.
As per the statement of Sulabh a ban imposed by the
Government of Tamil Nadu in the year 1991 which ban had not been lifted
in May, 2002. There could be no doubt that the allegations of the petitioner
related to the Thiruputhur Town Panchayats and from the averments in the
writ petition and the documents enclosed.
It is noteworthy that while there is a denial by Sulabh with regard
to the allegation of blacklisting, by the Govt. of U.P., however Sulabh does
not deny that recovery of Rs. 3.40 crores alongwith interest was directed to
be effected from Sulabh International.

266

This fact does not support the

WP(C) No.10685/2004

petitioners so far as their contention with regard to inefficiency in Sulabh's
functioning is concerned.
The petitioners have further contended that the Market
Federation of Lucknow blacklisted Sulabh and that the revocation order
dated 25th July, 1994 relied upon by Sulabh did not relate to the same case
which was referred in the newspaper report and that in any case, the order
dated 25th July, 1994 does not say that the blacklisting was by mistake.
The Patna City Corporation by its order dated 25 th January, 1996
took back all toilet and bath complexes from Sulabh.
In this context, the petitioners have also pointed out that there is
no denial by it to the allegation whereby Rs. 3.40 crores alongwith interest
which was paid to Sulabh was not utilized by it under the scavengers
liberation programme and was required to be recovered with interest.
The petitioners has placed material before this court that the
Patna City Corporation by an order dated 25th January, 1996 has actually
withdrawn toilets from Sulabh. The petitioners have also placed some other
document of the State Government requiring CBI to probe into Sulabh's
malfunctioning.
Sulabh has contended that it is still working at the Patna Railway
Station and in other parts of the Bihar under orders of the State
Government.
It is noteworthy that infact there is no material placed on record
after the order dated 5th May, 1999 which reproduces the order dated 28 th

267

WP(C) No.10685/2004

April, 1999. There is no material to support that there was any variation in
the order dated 5th May, 1999.
The petitioners have placed an order passed by the Government
of Bihar on 14th March, 1997 directing a CBI enquiry into allegations of
irregularities into utilization of Rs. 200 crores by Sulabh. This amount was
granted for welfare scheme which has not been explained by Sulabh in any
manner. The documents relied upon by the respondent pertained to the year
1990 whereas the order of the Government of Bihar is dated 14 th March,
1997. Furthermore, the PIL which was filed against Sulabh was dismissed
on the ground that the petitioners were attempting to settle personal grudges
and enmities which is not permissible in public interest litigation. In any
case, the PIL has no consequence inasmuch as the Government of Bihar had
ordered a CBI inquiry as back as on 14th March, 1997.

Sulabh has

contended that no CBI enquiry was conducted.
The petitioners have also strongly contended that in Delhi, the
MCD itself has held against Sulabh. It is an admitted position by all
concerned that the report of the committee dated 16th January, 1999 was
accepted by the MCD and a decision was taken on the basis of that report to
withdraw the operation and maintenance of the CTCs from Sulabh. In fact,
pursuant to this report, 66 CTCs were actually withdrawn from Sulabh and
to give to other NGOs by auction or tender.
From the above, certain complaints made against Sulabh are
admitted, others stand corroborated and established. This is not to detract

268

WP(C) No.10685/2004

from the submission that Sulabh was the pioneer in the field of public toilets
and has made a commendable contribution to the area it is addressing.
Several publications of the work undertaken by it have been placed before
the court.

It has made a mark nationally and achieved international

recognition for its expertise at the same time.
300.

But this matter cannot rest on Sulabh laurels alone. There is

another side to this aspect. From the foregoing, it is evidenced that several
persons have the experience and the necessary ability to operate and
maintain the CTCs. Several persons who were awarded the CTCs are not
defaulters. The construction of the CTCs does not involve construction of
new CTCs or new buildings or any new technology. The contract involves
only running and maintenance of the toilets which have been constructed by
the MCD. At the most, certain repairs are necessary or defects which were
never provided initially have to be supplied. There was no material before
the MCD or placed before the court to the effect that any person, authority
or committee made a complaint that the NGOs who were running the CTCs
had created a problem. The petitioners and the other NGOs have objected
that the MCD has by its decision created an unfair monopoly in
maintenance and operation of the CTCs at the instance of Sulabh while
exercising hostile discrimination against the petitioners.

Therefore, the

action of the MCD must fail even at the stage of primary review of its action
in the light of the principles laid down by Apex Court in Om Kumar's case
(supra).

269

WP(C) No.10685/2004

301.

The submissions regarding the ability and virtues of Sulabh's

functioning and its reputation diminish in significance in the light of the
considerations which must go into decision making of the kind involved in
the instant case. In my view such consideration is only one out of the
various other factors involved as noticed above. In any case, the MCD has
been unable to make out a case that Sulabh was the only NGO who was
capable of efficiently operating and maintaining the CTCs. MCD has also
been unable to support its decision in making the exception it drew in
allotting the CTCs enbloc to Sulabh without inviting competitive bidding
and for carving out a one sided agreement, totally loaded in favour of the
NGO. It has been unable to support its action in ignoring the revenue with
was being generated as also opportunity cost and payment of Rs.45 crores
and more to Sulabh for “repairs”.
302.

Another contention which has been vehemently urged on behalf

of the petitioners that the defaults attributed to the petitioner were in fact
contrived defaults for which Sulabh was responsible. According to the
petitioners, Sulabh participated in the bidding for the CTCs indirectly
through its sister concerns who did not pay licence fees to the MCD. The
submission is that it is the default of these 27 sister concerns of Sulabh
which has been attributed to the petitioners by MCD.
303.

The petitioners have pointed out that Sulabh was registered in

Patna as Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan and its name was changed later as
Sulabh International and again to Sulabh International Social Service

270

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Organisation by which name it is known even today. Ninety seven NGOs
were awarded 339 CTCs under the Yamuna Action Plan. 160 CTCs out of
the 339 CTCs allocated to these 27 NGOs, have remained non-functional
and up to September, 2004, a sum of more than Rs.1crore was due from
them towards the licence fee. The petitioner has pointed out, out of these
27 NGOs, those at serial numbers 3,4,6 to 8, 10, 11, 13 to 16, 18 to 22 and
24 (annexure P 23 at page 392 and 393 of W.P.(C) 11865/2005) also carry
the suffix “Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan”. The only change in the name is
to the extent that the name of a district in Bihar has been also prefixed. For
instance, they are known as the Aurangabad District Sulabh Sauchalaya
Sansthan; Bhagalpur District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan, Chapra District
Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan; Darbhanga

district Sulabh Sauchalaya

Sansthan ; Dhanbad District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan and are to be
found at serial nos. 3,4, 6, 7 and 8 of the list. At serial no. 9 the organistion
which is now known as Gautam Budh Paryavaran Umnavan Sansthan was
earlier known as Gaya District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan (at page 463 of
W.P.(C) 11865/2005).
So far the names of the NGOs at serial nos. 9, 23, 25 and 26 is
concerned, the same also carries the suffix Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan and
again only the name of a district was prefixed. Later the names of these
organisations have been changed.
304.

Yet another organisation namely International Institute of Sulabh

Systems is mentioned at serial no. 12 of this list which was registered under

271

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the Societies Registration Act as a society on 29th August, 1985. At the
time of its registration, Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak founder chairman of Sulabh
was the chairman of the society and his wife was the vice-chairman of that
institute.

The copy of the original registration certificate and the

memorandum of association of the International Insitute of Sulabh System
has been placed before this court by the petitioner, M/s Himalayan Institute
of Pollution Control & Social and Economic Development.
305.

The petitioners have submitted that these 27 NGOs are engaged

in similar work as Sulabh and there is commonality of interest and finances
between them. According to the petitioners, Sulabh in its affidavit dated
21st February, 2005 has admitted that the NGOs are nurtured and aided by it
and that financial, infrastructural assistance and necessary training are also
given to them by it.
306.

The petitioners have placed on record several documents in order

to indicate a close relationship the 27 NGOs with Sulabh. Inter alia, these
include :
(i) letter dated 7th January, 1993 (page 491 of W.P.(C) 11865/2005) signed
by Shri Subodh Kumar Jha, as honorary chairman of Sulabh International,
referring to “most of our complexes in the trans-Yamuna area”. The
letterhead mentions state branches in different states;
(ii) letter dated 4th May, 1993 sent by Ajay Kumar as honorary chairman of
Sulabh to the International Institute of Sulabh Systems (one of the 27 NGOs
above referred) to deduct some amount payable to a party and to remit the
amount to Sulabh International;
(iii) letter dated 19th September, 1994 from the Commissioner, MCD to the
Municipal Secretary of the MCD which deals with the construction and
subsequent maintenance of the Jan Suvidha Complexes on “pay and use
basis” in the JJ Clusters/slum areas in Delhi pursuant to the advertisement
272

WP(C) No.10685/2004

in July, 1993. This letter notices that by a resolution dated 10th March, 1994
the works were allocated to 9 agencies including Sulabh International and
refers to the meetings with Dr. Pathak, founder of Sulabh International.
During these discussions, it transpired that these agencies which had earlier
applied to organisations in July, 1993 had at one or the other point of time
some association with Sulabh International and Dr. Pathak assured that
these agencies will also be able to take the works on smaller scale and on
the same rates, terms and conditions as approved by the standing committee.
This was reiterated by Dr. Pathak in a meeting with Hon'ble Chief Minister,
Delhi on 14th September, 1994.
(iv) It is noteworthy that finally it was decided that work be awarded at 25
locations to Sulabh and simultaneously the case be submitted for award of
work on the above lines to the other agencies which included Vaishali
District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan; G Sauchalaya Sansthan; Begusarai
District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan and all other agencies which had a
similar name;
(v) Circular dated 31st March, 1995 signed by Shri Ajay Kumar as honorary

(vi) a letter dated 11th October, 1995 was addressed by Shri Subodh Kumar
as advisor of the Ranchi District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan. In this letter,
Shir Subodh Kumar refers to the fact that this organisation is already
engaged in construction and maintenance work from the Slum Wing of the
MCD;
(vii) a letter dated 13th February, 1996 was written by Shri Akhilesh Kumar
Jha as vice chairman of the Akhil Bhartiya Paryavaran and Gramin Vikas

Cluster and Slum area in the NCT of Delhi.
(ix).
Strong reliance has been placed on the minutes of a meeting
th
dated 4 May, 1996 which was held under the chairmanship of Shri Subodh
Kumar Jha and Shri Ajay Kumar to review the works relating to the
construction of the Jan Suvidha Complexes. The chairman directed that
review meetings would be held on 2nd of every month at 11 a.m.
Representatives of Madhubani, Chapra, Katihar, Bhojpur, Vaishali and
Darbhanga were asked to attend the meeting on every Saturday alongwith
273

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the meeting of projects at 2.30 p.m. All NGOs were requested to submit
their monthly trial balance and progress report before the meeting of the 2nd
of Saturday every month to Shri Manoj Kumar Jha for discussion. Action
was directed to be taken by all the NGOs in this meeting. Mr. Manoj
Kumar Jha was entrusted with the task of inspection of the physical
progress of the works in the different districts. The trial balances and
schedules were required to be checked up by Mr. M.C. Jha, while
representatives of Begu Sarai; ABP Gramin Vikas Sansthan and IISS,
Madhopura, Samastipur, Gaya and Sarasa were required to attend the
meetings regularly and copies of the minutes were required to be circulated
to all NGOs within one week. Amongst those who participated in the
meeting and have signed the minutes include Shri Subodh Kumar Jha of the
Ranchi District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan, Shri Ajay Kumar from the
Siwn District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan. The representatives of 24 of the
district Sauchalayas have attended this meeting. It refers to the Bhojpur,
Bojpur District, Aurangabad District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan,
Palanou, Dhanbad, Khangwan District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan;
(x) By a letter dated 1st August, 1996, issued by the Administrative
Executive to the honorary chairman of Sulabh, a meeting of the
representatives of 10 districts was called on 7th August, 1996 to review the
project implementation. Ten of the NGOs who were invited were those
which are included in the 27 NGOs to whom the CTCs were allocated in
Delhi.
(xi) A meeting was held on 2nd August, 1996 to review the progress of the
works relating to the construction of the Jan Suvidha Complex with the
Slum & JJ Department of the MCD. This was held under the chairmanship
of the Chairman, DSIB. Amongst the various persons who attended the
meeting, Shri Subodh Kumar Jha and Shri Ajay Kumar represented Sulabh
International while the other NGOs who were participating in the meetings
which were conducted by Sulabh International as noticed above were also
present.
307.
Apart from the above M/s Himalayan Institute of Pollution
Control & Social and Economic Development has placed voluminous
documentation before this court in order to establish that 27 of the NGOs
who participated in the auctions conducted by the MCD and successfully
bid for allocation of the CTCs have a close relationship and actually are part
of Sulabh. The petitioners have vehemently urged that not only do these
organisations maintain close financial interaction with Sulabh but they all
274

WP(C) No.10685/2004

maintain a bank account in State Bank of Indore at Janakpuri branch, New
Delhi. It has been stated that SISSO also maintains a bank account with the
same bank as these organisations. In support of the submission of close
financial interaction between Sulabh International and the other NGOs and
commonality of intent and functioning, the following correspondence has
been placed before the court :“(i)
copy of a letter dated 29th May, 1990 on behalf of
Executive Chairman, Sulabh to the Akhil Bhartiya Paryavaran Evam
Gramin Vikas Sansthan, Ahmedabad(ABPEGVS for brevity);
(ii)
copy of a letter dated 22nd September, 1995 from
Akhilesh Kumar Jha, Vice Chairman, ABPEGVS to the chairman, Sulabh
International enclosing demand draft of Rs.1 lakh;
(iii)
copy of a letter dated 13th February, 1996 from
Akhilesh Kumar Jha, Vice Chairman, ABPEGVS to the founder Sulabh
International enclosing demand draft of Rs. 1 lakh;
(iv)
copy of a letter dated 10th August, 1996 from
Akhilesh Kumar Jha, Vice chairman, ABPEGVS to founder Sulabh
International with a draft of Rs. 1 lakh;
(v)
copy of a letter dated 24th January, 1997 again from
Akhilesh Kumar Jha, VC, ABPEGVS to founder Sulabh International with
a demand draft of Rs. 1 lkah;
(vi)
copy of a letter dated 10th June, 1997 from Akhilesh
Kumar Jha, VC, ABPEGVS to founder Sulabh International with a demand
draft of Rs. 1 lkah;
(vii)
copy of a letter dated 15th April, 1995 from Mr. J.K.
Jha, Chairman(M), Sulabh International to the advisor Ranchi District
Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan wherein it has been noted that the Ranchi
District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan has not paid the contribution for the
months of January to March, 1995 and a reminder has been issued to make
payment of Rs.12,782/- immediately (at page 609 of the paper book).”
308.

In order to show the close working and the control exercise by

Sulabh over the functioning of the other NGOs, the petitioners have placed
before this court a letter from Shri S.P. Singh on behalf of the Bhagalpur
District

Sulabh

Sauchalaya

Sansthan

to

Shri

J.K.

Jha,

Chairman(Maintenance) of Sulabh with copies inter alia to Shri Mulkhraj,
275

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Ajay Kumar, Damodar Bhartiya and Subodh Kumar Jha giving a detailed
account and status of the rejuvenation of four toilet complexes of the
Kalkaji Zone. It has been pointed out that this has been effected from the
amount of Rs.1,55,000/- given to it and he sought reimbursement of the
amount of Rs.13,258/- further put into the project account amongst other
amounts. By this letter Shir S.P. Singh has informed that formal handing
over of the charge of maintenance of 21 toilet complexes is handed over to
Sulabh.
Shri Subodh Kumar Jha as Treasurer of the Bhagalpur District
Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan at the time of its registration in 1983-84, has
addressed a letter dated 10th April, 1990 on behalf of the Ranchi District
Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan to the Addl. Commissioner, MCD Slum Wing
with regard to the construction and maintenance of the Jan Suvidha
Complexes on pay and use basis and has filed an affidavit dated 23rd
October, 2004 before this court as Chairman of Sulabh in W.P.(C)
11865/2004.
A letter which is similar in content with regard to other accounts
dated 4th April, 1995 has been also filed and a letter dated 3 rd May, 1995
giving final accounts in respect of the repair work of toilet complexes of the
Kalkaji Zone has been placed before this court.
309.

The closeness of the relationship between the Ranchi District

Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan and Sulabh is evidenced also by the fact that
Shri Subodh Kumar Jha was the decision maker in both the organisations.

276

WP(C) No.10685/2004

In this behalf, Shri Subodh Kumar Jha addressed a letter dated 22nd
December, 1995 on behalf of Ranchi District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan
to the NDMC regarding taking over of urinal cum toilets of the NDMC.
Similarly, Shri Akhilesh Kumar Jha, a senior functionary of Sulabh has
addressed a letter dated 10th April, 1997 on behalf of ABPEVS to the
founder of Sulabh forwarding a demand draft of Rs. 1 lakh.
Further, copies of letters dated 29th November, 1997 and 1st
December, 1997 from the ABPEGVS to Chairman, Sulabh International
Social Service Organisation regarding the statement of account has been
placed before this court. Information with regard to the status of the
auditing of the account books have been also placed before the court.
It is further pointed out that on 10th January, 1994, 9 NGOs were
selected by the MCD for allotment of CTCs to Sulabh. Sulabh International
Social Service Organisation was one of these nine and did not accept the
terms of allotment. Consequently, the CTCs were allotted to the remaining
eight. Work at 44 locations was so allotted. Material has been placed
before the court to show that work was allotted to other agencies in respect
of whom Sulabh gave assurance. There were 29 such agencies. Again in
1995, CTCs were so allotted to 5 NGOs.
310.

According to the petitioners, Sulabh International was shortlisted

and called to participate in the auction of the CTCs. It did not do so and
had taken the high stand that it only accepts work on nomination basis and
does not participate in tenders and auctions. This was merely a ruse while

277

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Sulabh actually participated in the auction through its sister organisations as
a shield, 27 of whom were actually awarded the 321 CTCs. The petitioners
have pointed out that 160 CTCs which were allocated to these sister
organisations remain non-functional even on date. It is further pointed out
that according to the MCD, these 27 NGOs owe a sum of Rs.1,10,13,494/to the corporation.

According to the petitioners, these are contrived

defaulters created by Sulabh in order to create a situation so that the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi awards all the CTCs to it in the manner in
which it has done.
311.

Neither the Municipal Corporation of Delhi nor Sulabh have

opted to deny the specific allegations with have been raised in this behalf
against the 27 NGOs.
312.

The respondent Sulabh International Social Service Organisation

has filed a reply dated 21st February, 2005 in W.P.(C) 11865/2004
Himalayan Institute of Pollution Control and Social Economic Development
vs Commissioner, MCD to contend that it is an accepted mother NGO and
is so recognised also by the National Institute of Urban Affairs which is
intended to nurture other NGOs engaged in similar work. According to
Sulabh, these nurtured NGOs retained their own individual identities except
to the extent that they had to refund to Sulabh, the financial assistance
received by them from it during their teething period. According to Sulabh,
its pioneering role in a guiding and aiding the activities of other NGOs has
received national and international recognition. The National Institute of

278

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Urban Affairs which is the implementing agency for the Government of
India United Nations Development Programme on “National Strategy for
the Urban Poors”has designated Sulabh as one of the 'Mother NGOs'.
It is stated that it has 50000 volunteers and that amongst the
NGOs who are beneficiaries of the training and help extended by Sulabh,
the Himalayan Institute of Pollution and Economic Development (the
petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 11865/2004); Akhil Bhartiya Manav Sewa
Sansthan (the petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 12142/2004) have received
substantial aid and assistance from it.

Shri Krishan Kumar Jha, Secretary

General of the Indian Bhoomi Paryavaran Vikas Sansthan, (petitioner in
W.P.(C) 12948/2004) is stated to have been a volunteer of Sulabh who
received an honorarium for his voluntary service till July, 2001 and he last
drew honorarium in January, 2003.
The explanation given for not approaching the MCD for
allotment of the work of operation, maintenance and management of the
CTCs is because Sulabh International is not in this service for commercial
or profit motive. It has agreed to take over the CTCs only as this work
would benefit a large section of slum dwellers and underprivileged classes
of Delhi. All the other allegations made by the petitioners are denied by a
bald assertion that the allegations made by the petitioners were unfortunate,
unnecessary and false and intended only to damage Sulabh's reputation.
Counter allegations have been made against the petitioners.
313.

In order to establish that Sulabh International Social Service

279

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Organisation has a bank account with the State Bank of Indore, Janakpuri,
New Delhi, the petitioners have placed on record photocopies of three
cheques which are dated 30th November, 2009 for Rs.32,93,750/-, 30th
November, 2010 and 30th November, 2011 each for the same amount as well
as 30th November, 2005 for Rs.32,93,750/- in favour of the Addl.
Commissioner (Slum & JJ) of the MCD. These cheques are signed by the
Chairman,

Administration,

Honorary

Financial

Advisor,

Honorary

Secretary, Honorary Assistant Accountant for Sulabh International Social
Service Organisation.
Also placed on record is the photocopy of a cheque dated 13 th
March, 1995 drawn on the State Bank of Indore, Janakpuri, New Delhi in
the sum of Rs.24,230/- by Ranchi District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan in
favour of a third party M/s Venus Engineering (at page 612).
M/s Bhagalpur Sarai District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan passed
a resolution in a meeting held by it on 27th October, 1994 whereby it
unanimously resolved that the current account with the State Bank of
Indore, Janakpuri, New Delhi under its name would be operated under the
joint signatures of two of the three persons who were named in this
resolution.
To the same effect is a resolution passed by the Begusarai
District Sulabh Sauchalaya Sansthan on 16th March, 2001 with regard to
operation of the bank account in its name with the State Bank of Indore,
Janakpuri Branch, New Delhi.

280

WP(C) No.10685/2004

In any case, in the light of the specific allegation that these 27
NGOs are having an account in the State Bank of Indore, Janakpuri Branch,
New Delhi and are having interse and financial dealings with Sulabh
through the same, it was easy for the MCD to rebut the same in as much as
it was possessed of the documents and records relating to the payments of
security and the licence fees which was paid to it by these NGOs and hence
was aware of their bankers. Yet no information regarding this aspect was
made available even though the MCD had ample opportunity to provide the
same.
314.

So far as the assertion that 27 of the NGOs who successfully bid

and were allocated 321 CTCs is concerned, the petitioners have placed
substantial material before this court to show that these organisations have
some kind of a connection with Sulabh. The documents which have been
placed on record show bank transactions and a close control over the
functioning of several of these NGOs by Sulabh so much so that these
NGOs have to submit reports to Sulabh. Several lakhs of rupees have been
transacted by a single NGO and paid to Sulabh. Other NGOs have been
reporting regularly to Sulabh with regard to the work being done on the
CTCs. Regular review meetings have been held and it would appear that
Sulabh substantially controls and calls for explanation also from the NGOs.
Senior officials of these NGOs are also occupying senior positions with
Sulabh. It would therefore appear that Sulabh has some kind of control and
involvement in the functioning of these NGOs or in any case some

281

WP(C) No.10685/2004

commonality of interest.
315.

According to the petitioners, as on 30th June, 2005, each of these

27 organisations who were allotted 347 CTCs out of the total of 959 CTCs
under the Yamuna Action Plan were owing to a huge amount of
Rs.1,27,05,252.00 to the MCD.
In the face of these allegations, the MCD was required to
examine the same more closely to arrive at a firm finding in respect thereof.
If the allegations of the petitioners are to be believed, then these 27 NGOs
would have contributed in a large way to the situation which was created.
Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak of Sulabh had given personal assurance to the Chief
Minister, Delhi as noticed above which was noted in the letter dated 19 th
September, 1994 of the MCD. Therefore, the MCD cannot possibly simply
brush aside the averments of the petitioner on the bald pleas that they were
malafide, frivolous or without any basis.
316.

Despite the respondents being called upon to produce the record

relating to the allegations of the petitioners with regard to the respondent
Sulabh maintaining an account in the same bank as the other concerns or
statement of the payments which have been received from these persons, no
such information was placed. Sulabh has also not denied specifically the
allegations made and there is no explanation with regard to the close
financial and functional control exercise by it.
317.

So far as the instant case is concerned, it is necessary to examine

these allegations only in view of the assertion on behalf of the petitioner of

282

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the impact that Sulabh has had on the allegations of breach of the terms of
auction by the NGOs necessitating decisions to cancel the contracts with the
NGOs and handing over all the CTCs to itself. The main justification in
court in supp decisions is that all the NGOs were gross defaulters. The
aspect of matter certainly then assumes significance and has been
completely ignored.
Decision in Public Interest
318.

There is one more facet to the issue of the decision being based

on relevant facts. In the light of the foregoing discussion, amongst the
exceptions which have been held by the Apex Court as justifying a decision
to not to take a recourse to the method of open auction or tendering for
grants of a contract, primary are considerations of public interest. Before
this court forceful arguments have been also advanced that MCD has acted
in public interest as the issue involved is the interests of public hygiene and
health; environmental pollution etc.

Even the ultimate decision of the

Corporation to allot to Sulabh notices that it was in `public interest' to do
so.
319.

Public interest is not statutorily defined, however the same used

in several statutes.

This expression has received expansion in judicial

pronouncements and applies to almost all activity of the state and statutory
authorities. In fact the courts have gone to the extent of holding that public
interest would override all considerations of individual or private interest.
In Words & Phrases, Permanent Addition, Vol. 35, public

283

WP(C) No.10685/2004

interest is defined thus :“Public interest” means more than a mere curiosity; it means
something in which the public, the community at large, has some peculiary
interest, or some interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are
affected.

It does not mean anything so narrow as the interests of the

particular localities, which may be affected by the matters in question. (Ref.
State v. Crockettt, 206 P. 816, 817, 86 Olk. 124).
Further, it would be useful to consider the rights of the public
which have been defined thus :“Public interest” means 'of public right', and the word 'public' in
this sense means 'pertaining to the people', or affecting the community at
large; that which concerns a multitude of people.' and the word 'right' as so
used, means 'a well-founded claim; an interest; concern; advantage; benefit,'
and the term 'public interest' means more than a mere curiosity, and means
something in which the public has some pecuniary interest, or some interest
by which their legal rights or liabilities are affected (Ref. State v. Lyon, 165
P.419, 420, 63 Okl. 285).
320.

It is stated that property becomes clothed with a public interest

when used in a manner to make it or public consequence, and affect the
community at large.
The circumstances which clothe a particular kind of business
with a 'public interest' as to be subject to regulation, must be such as to
create a peculiarly close relation between the public and those engaged in it

284

WP(C) No.10685/2004

and raise implications of an affirmative obligation on their part to be
reasonable in dealing with the public. One does not devote this property or
business to a public use, or clothe it with a public interest, merely because
he makes commodities for an sells to the public in common callings, such as
those of the butcher, baker, tailor, etc. (Ref.: Chas Wolff Packing Co. v.
Court of Industrieal Realtions of State of Kansas, Kan., 43 S.Ct. 630, 633,
262 U.S. 522, 67 L.Ed. 1103, 27 A.L.R. 1280.)
321.

However, it has further been stated that the expression 'public

interest' and 'public use' are not synonymous in determining whether a use is
public, we must look not only to the character of the business to be done but
also as to the proposed mode of doing it. If the use is merely optional with
the owners, or the public benefit merely incidental, it is not a public use
authorising the power of eminent domain. There must be in general a right
to the definite use of the property, a right which the law compels the owner
to give to the general public. It is not enough that the general prosperity of
the public is promoted (Ref Niagara Falls & W. .Ry.Co., 15 N.E. 429, 108
N.Y. 376). The true criterion by which to judge the character of the use is
whether the public may enjoyed by right or only by permission. (Ref. Great
Western Natural Gas & Oil Co., v. Hawkins, 66 N.E., 765, 768, 30
Ind.App. 557). The test whether the use is public or not is whether a public
trust is imposed upon the property; whether the public has a legal right to
the use, which cannot be gainsaid or denied or withdrawn at the pleasure of
the owner.

285

The expressions 'public interest' and 'public use' are not

WP(C) No.10685/2004

synonymous.
Thus, where a railroad condemned land for public use and rented
it to a wholesale grocery company, the use of the land by the grocery
company was not a public use, for, while it might be a public benefit or
public interest, no obligation rested upon the grocery company to conduct
its business for the benefit of the public; the true criterion of a public use
being whether the public may enjoy it by right or by permission only, and
the terms 'public interest' and 'public use' not being synonymous. (Ref.
Neitzel v. Spokane International Ry.Co., 117 P. 864, 869, 65 Wash, 100,
36 L.R.A., N.S., 522).
Similarly, expending money in caring for streets which are so
narrow that the village cannot accept them as streets is not a 'public use' of
money. (Ref: Smith v. Smythe, 90 N.E. 1121, 1123, 197 N.Y. 457, 35
L.R.A., N.S., 524, citing In Re Niagara Falls & W.R. Co., 15 N.E. 429,
432, 108 N.Y. 375, 385.)
Therefore the expression 'public interest' and 'public use' are not
synonymous. The establishment of furnaces, mills, and manufactures, the
building of churches and hotels, and other similar enterprises, are more or
less matters of public concern, and promote in a general sense the public
welfare, but they lie without the domain of public uses for which private
ownership may be displaced by compulsory proceedings.
322.

The expression public interest finds place in the Constitution. It

has also been noted by the Apex Court in various decisions. The expression

286

WP(C) No.10685/2004

is therefore a word of definite concept and not nebulous. Public interest in
relation to public administration means that only honest and efficient
persons are to be retained in service while services of dishonest or corrupt
or those whoa re almost dead wood are to be dispensed with (Re : State of
Gujarat & Anr. v. Suryakant Chunilal Shah (1999) 1 SCC 529).

Any

action in the interest of the security of the state is clearly in public interest
(Re : Abdul Ghani v. State of J&K (1973) SCC 525).
323.

Under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, the State Government may

issue directions of general nature in public interest under Section 43A.
Such interest is not restricted to the interest of the operators or of the
passengers. It takes in two fold general factors such as the route or the area
issuance of permits which may be issued on a route area or having regards
to the needs and convenience of the travelling public; non-availability of
sufficient number of other services; problems of law and order, availability
of fuel, impact of atmospheric pollution caused by vehicles; condition of
roads; considerations of economics of running the services etc. (Re : (1983)
2 SCC 195 Rameshwar Prasad v. State of U.P.)
Administrative decisions in public interest may require
consideration of maintenance of standards of efficient competence utility
and the requirement of the citizens.
324.

The Apex Court had occasion to consider a challenge to an

award of tender by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board for design,
manufacture, supply, erection and commissioning of pipes and steel tanks

287

WP(C) No.10685/2004

for two units of a thermal power station. The challenge to the action was
laid on a contention of relaxation of the qualifying criterion in favour of the
person to whom the contract was awarded. In its judgment reported at
(1999) 1 SCC 492 Raunaq International Ltd. v. I.V.R. Construction Ltd.,
the Supreme Court laid down that the consideration in the award of the
contract would be commercial considerations. In this behalf, it was held
thus :“9. The award of a contract, whether it is by a private
party or by a public body or the State, is essentially a
commercial transaction. In arriving at a commercial
decision, considerations which are of paramount
importance are commercial considerations. These
would be:
(1) the price at which the other side is willing to do the
work;
(2) whether the goods or services offered are of the
requisite specifications;
(3) whether the person tendering has the ability to
deliver the goods or services as per specifications.
When large works contracts involving engagement of
substantial manpower or requiring specific skills are to
be offered, the financial ability of the tenderer to fulfil
the requirements of the job is also important;
(4) the ability of the tenderer to deliver goods or
services or to do the work of the requisite standard and
quality;
(5) past experience of the tenderer and whether he has
successfully completed similar work earlier;
(6) time which will be taken to deliver the goods or
services; and often
(7) the ability of the tenderer to take follow-up action,
rectify defects or to give post-contract services.
Even when the State or a public body enters into a
commercial transaction, considerations which would
prevail in its decision to award the contract to a given
party would be the same. However, because the State
or a public body or an agency of the State enters into
such a contract, there could be, in a given case, an
element of public law or public interest involved even
288

WP(C) No.10685/2004

325.

in such a commercial transaction.
10. What are these elements of public interest? (1)
Public money would be expended for the purposes of
the contract. (2) The goods or services which are being
commissioned could be for a public purpose, such as,
construction of roads, public buildings, power plants
or other public utilities. (3) The public would be
directly interested in the timely fulfilment of the
contract so that the services become available to the
public expeditiously. (4) The public would also be
interested in the quality of the work undertaken or
goods supplied by the tenderer. Poor quality of work
or goods can lead to tremendous public hardship and
substantial financial outlay either in correcting
mistakes or in rectifying defects or even at times in
redoing the entire work — thus involving larger
outlays of public money and delaying the availability
of services, facilities or goods, e.g., a delay in
commissioning a power project, as in the present case,
could lead to power shortages, retardation of industrial
development, hardship to the general public and
substantial cost escalation.”
According to the MCD, its decision has been taken in public

interest.
326.

It has been urged at great length by Mr. P.N. Lekhi, learned

senior counsel appearing for Sulabh. It has been urged that the issue
in this case relates only to a matter of hygiene and public health
which does not entail any element of commerce or profit making. It
has been urged that Sulabh is the pioneer in the field and does not
participate in public auctions and tenders. The MCD has recognised the
ability of this organisation and it is in order to provide the best service to the
public at large that the MCD has decided to allot all the CTCs to Sulabh.
Such a decision cannot be faulted as it has been taken purely for reasons of
public interest.

289

WP(C) No.10685/2004

327.

This submission has been vehemently disputed on the other side

which has pointed out that when the MCD took the considered decision to
allot the CTCs by a process of public auction, it had taken into
consideration other aspects of the matter as well. The terms and conditions
on which the allotment was to be made was effected after a deliberation and
consideration of the experience of several decades. In public interest, while
a notional cost to be recovered from the user was envisaged, however, the
MCD had taken into consideration the expenditure which it incurred in
construction of the CTCs and it had also imposed a requirement of deposit
of security as well as a periodic license fee on the NGOs. It has been
pointed out that MCD was conscious of the fact that certain income could
be derived from the CTCs which was beyond the amounts received from the
users of the toilets.

Such revenue could be generated by permitting

advertisement on the CTCs which were the property of the statutory
authority.

While allotting the CTCs to the petitioners, the MCD had

prohibited advertisement by the NGOs and had consequently reserved the
right absolutely to itself, however while making the allocation of the CTCs
to Sulabh, it has completely abdicated its right and conferred the same on
Sulabh without any reservation. A notional amount towards advertisement
tax has been reserved while there is no element of revenue sharing. The
action of the MCD is to be faulted for this reason as well inasmuch as
without any assessment of the revenue which is to be generated, MCD has
taken the decision to permit advertising on the CTCs which it decided to

290

WP(C) No.10685/2004

hand over the CTCs to Sulabh.
328.

Having regard to the transaction in the instant case, there are two

facet to the award of CTCs.

One is the business of operation and

maintenance of the CTCs to render public toilets available to the public at a
cost. The other aspect relates to derivation of any revenue therefrom. There
is no dispute that in the instant case, there were two sources of revenue
which were generated on the CTCs. One is from the charges which are to
be paid by the users of the toilet while the second aspect of the revenue
which is generated from the commercial exploitation of advertising thereon.
So far as the provision of the facilities of the toilets to the
citizens is concerned, it is to be borne in mind that the CTCs are state
property intended for public use. Public interest gets interfaced because of
the public hygiene and public health which use of the toilet is intended to
promote. There is also an unavoidable aspect relating to the prevention of
untreated sewage flowing into the river Yamuna which has tremendous
environmental consequences and impact on the health of the city. Thus, the
use of the CTCs renders the same essential for the community and the city
in public interest.
329.

The explanation which has been elaborately placed before this

court for taking the decision to hand over all the CTCs to Sulabh is cross
subsidisation. The MCD has placed reliance on the request of the Sulabh
to hand over all the CTCs to compensate it for CTCs wherefrom adequate
revenue was not being generated.

291

It is in order to effectuate such an

WP(C) No.10685/2004

intention that, according to MCD, the decision has been taken to award all
the CTCs to Sulabh apart from considerations of efficient running by this
organisation. To this extent, the MCD could possibly urge that it has taken
a decision for reasons of public interest.
However, so far as the decision to promote advertising rights to
Sulabh is concerned, it is nobody's case before this court that the decision
was taken because of any element of public interest.

There is no

explanation at all for the same not a whisper of a consideration of the
revenue which would be generated therefrom. Such a decision in the light
of the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the various judgments
which have been cited by the respondents themselves, had to be guided by
sound principles of maximising revenue and nothing else.

The

advertisement rights are clearly outside the domain of public interest and
public use inasmuch as Sulabh would exploit the same for its private
commercial benefits.
330.

MCD has received the amount of Rs.51,50,000/- as security

deposit in the auction process conducted and Rs.94,81,181/- as licence fees
for the first quarter alone under the licenses to the NGOs. The MCD would
have thus had a recurring income of at least Rs.94,81,185/- per quarter from
the licence fees which was payable by the NGOs if it implemented all the
decisions taken by it. From the records produced by the MCD before this
court, it is apparent that no official of the MCD performed their statutory
duty.

None bothered to even inspect the CTCs let alone effect the

292

WP(C) No.10685/2004

rectifications which they were bound to do so. This money was public
money and could have been done away with only for good and justifiable
reasons in public interest. Such public interest would have been the
consideration justifying the decision by the MCD to depart from all ordinary
rules of allotting public property by open competitive bidding and also
ignoring the profit element in entering into contracts. Unfortunately, it is
not so in the instant case. This was not done and the impugned decision
cannot be permitted to stand for this reason alone.
331.

As noticed hereinabove CTCs which were also constructed and

given to Sulabh and other NGOs in the years 1994 for maintenance for the
thirty year period on ‘pay and use basis’, the permissible rate which could
be charged from the user was 30 paise per entry and the user could avail
both facility of toilet and bath by this facility. There was no complaint with
regard to the operation and maintenance of these CTCs. Yet the MCD has
stated that the lease of these CTCs be cancelled and all these CTCs be
handed over to Sulabh on the new proposed terms and conditions.
332.

About 373 CTCs stood allotted to NGOs outside of the CTCs

constructed under the Yamuna Action Plan. There is no allegation that
these NGOs

had committed any default with regard to operation,

maintenance or any payment in respect of these CTCs. There was also no
complaint in respect of these CTCs till the MCD took the decision to
withdraw these CTCs from the NGOs and hand over to Sulabh for operation
and maintenance.

293

WP(C) No.10685/2004

333.

No objective assessment nor any cost benefit analysis was made

prior to 3rd January, 2004 or even till 25th October, 2004, to assess the
benefit or expense which would enure to the MCD in effectuating and
implementing the proposed terms on which the CTSs were proposed to be
handed over to Sulabh. There is no objective evaluation of even public
interest which is stated to have motivated the decision making. Therefore,
there is no objective justification for the decision which has been taken by
the MCD in respect of public property and with regard to an obligatory
statutory function. The facility is essential and imperative, not only in terms
of the hygiene of persons for whom it is intended but also towards the
health of the city as a whole inasmuch as open defecation effects public
health which has serious environmental impact in terms of the effect on
pollution in the river Yamuna are a matter of such concern. Apart from a
bald assertion that the decision is in public interest, none of these facets
have been taken into account while taking the impugned decision.
334.

Sulabh has been given unconditional advertisement rights with

regard to the CTCs. There is no dispute that advertisements would generate
substantial revenue. There is not even a semblance of an assessment or
consideration to the quantum of revenue which would be generated by
giving advertisement rights on 1963 CTCs to Sulabh. There can be no
quarrel or dispute that the CTCs are public property. Therefore, there must
to be good reason as to why the entire revenue generated from the public
property is permitted to go into the coffers of a private party. While the fact

294

WP(C) No.10685/2004

that the private party was going to bear the running cost of operation and
maintenance of the CTC, however all expenditure thereon including repairs,
electricity, water, septic tank etc is to be borne by the MCD.
335.

The entire thrust of the argument on behalf of Sulabh has been

that it is engaged in developing the hygienic toilet habit in the poor people,
not for any reason of self-promotion or profit, but on account of reasons of
upholding the dignity of the individual, sheer altruism and philanthropy.
On this high moral ground, it has taken a stand that it does not participate in
commercial or competitive methods of allocation of toilet complexes in the
nature of auctions and tenders. The MCD has stated that it has taken this
action of cancelling the licences and leases of all NGOs and handing over
the CTCs to Sulabh on grounds of public interest. This being the position,
there is no reason as to why the entire advertisement rights and the revenue
therefrom should be permitted to go to Sulabh unless there is good reason
for the MCD. It is more so, when the same is to be generated from property
of the MCD. It is not as if Sulabh would not be recovering the usage cost
from the toilet users. Sulabh has been permitted a variable rate in respect of
slums and non-slums areas as well as the right to enhance the usage charges
annually.
336.

In this behalf, it would be useful to consider the principles for

the functioning of public sector undertakings as laid down by the Apex
Court in 1990 (Supp.) SCC 397 Oil and Natural Gas Commission & Anr.
v. Assn. Of Natural Gas Consuming Industries of Gujarat & Ors. which

295

WP(C) No.10685/2004

in my view, hold good for statutory authorities as the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi. In this case, the Supreme Court was concerned with a
challenge to price fixation by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission. The
High Court held that the ONGC (ONGC for short) “is a public utility
undertaking” which was bound to supply gas at the request of any member
of the public at large and had directed that it should continue to supply gas
to the respondents at an uncertain price till the price is fixed in accordance
with the procedure derived by it notwithstanding that the contracts under
which the respondents had agreed to effect such supplies had expired long
ago. Before the Apex Courts, the correctness of the High Court conclusion
that the price of gas must be determined on the basis of cost of production
supplies a reasonable return for the investments made (which was referred
to by the Apex Court as the 'cost plus basis'). The Apex Court considered
several aspects of the principles which are required to be kept in mind for
price fixation of essential commodities basic to public need.
The ONGC did not dispute that it is an instrumentality of the
state. However, it refuted the suggestion that it had become a public utility
undertaking with an obligation to supply goods to any consumer on
reasonable conditions. So far as the contention that the cost plus basis
would be the only basis for fixation of prices of essential commodities or
services rendered by a public utility undertaking is concerned, the court held
thus :“28.
While the cost plus basis in a recognised
basis for fixation of prices of essential commodities or
296

WP(C) No.10685/2004

for the services rendered by a public utility undertaking,
it would not, in our view, be correct to treat it as the
only permissible basis in all situations. On behalf of the
ONGC it has been pointed out that even in the fixation
of prices of essential commodities like levy sugar, the
concept of cost plus is not necessarily the only method
of fixing the price for the commodity. In considering
the question whether the price fixation in that case was
based on proper principles and by following correct
methods in accordance with Section 3(3-C) of the
Essential Commodities Act, this Court observed in the
Anakapalle case p.899 : (SCC p.450, para 28)
'While examining question no. 3 learned
Solicitor General has reminded us that 'cost plus' cannot
always be the proper basis for price fixation. Even if
there is no price control each unit will have to compete
in the market and those units which are uneconomic and
whose cost is unduly high will have to compete with
others which are more efficient and the cost of which is
much lower. It may be that uneconomic units may
suffer losses but what they cannot achieve in the open
market they cannot insist on where price has to be fixed
by the government. The Sugar Enquiry Commission in
its 1965 report expressed the vies that 'cost plus' basis
for price fixation perpetuates inefficiency in the
industry and is, therefore, against the long term interest
of the country.”
29.
The court quoted from a study prepared in
collaboration with the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India : (quoted at SCC pp. 450-51, para
30)
“[C]osts alone do not determine the
prices. Cost is only one of the many complex
factors which together determine prices. The
only general principle that can be stated is that
in the end there must be some margin in prices
over total costs, if capital is to be unimpaired
and production maximised by the utilisation of
internal surpluses...while the 'cost plus' pricing
method is the most common, it may be argued
that it is not the best available method because it
ignores demand or fails to adequately reflect
competition or is based upon a concept of cost
which is not solely relevant for pricing decision
in all cases. What is essential is not so much of
current or past costs but forecast of future cost
297

WP(C) No.10685/2004

with accuracy...Generally pricing should be
such as to increase production and sales and
secure an adequate return on capital employed.”
Again, in a somewhat different context in
relation to a State transport undertaking, this Court
observed, in D.R. Venkatachalam v. Deputy Transport
Commissioner: (SCC p. 279, para 9)
“..... the special status of a
governemnt owned transport undertaking in a
welfare State is obvious... Its functional motto
is not more profits at any cost but service to
citizens first and in a far larger measure than
private companies and individuals, although
profitability is also a factor even in public
utilities.” (emphasis added).”
After so noticing, the court finally laid down the following
principles :“30.
These passages indicate that
cost plus is not a satisfactory basis in all situations.
The basis may need to be made more stringent in
some situations and more broad-based in others.
May be the cost plus is an ideal basis where the
commodity supplied is the product of a monopoly
vital to human needs. In that context the price fixed
should be minimum possible as the customer or
consumer must have the commodity for his survival
and cannot afford more than the minimum. The
producer should not, therefore, be allowed to get
back more than a minimum profit. Indeed, in certain
situations, it may even be inequitable to fix varying
prices on the basis of the cost of each individual
manufacturer and thus encourage inefficiency; it
may be necessary to base it uniformly for a whole
industry on the cost of the most efficient
manufacturer as has been done in the case of drugs
(vide Cynamide case). It was so vital that the goods
should be available to the common man that the
prices were statutorily fixed so low as to drive away
inefficient producers and so as to make it possible
only for the most efficient manufacturers to survive.
Per contra, there can be situations where the need of
the consumer is not so vital and the requirements of
the economic scene are such that the needs of the
298

WP(C) No.10685/2004

336.

producer should be given greater consideration. In
such situations, the “plus” element in the cost plus
basis (namely, the allowable profit margin) should
not be confined to “a reasonable return on the
capital” but should be allowed to have a much larger
content depending on the circumstances.
31.
The notion that the cost plus basis can be
the only criterion for fixation of prices in the case of
public enterprises stems basically from a concept
that such enterprises should function either on a no
profit - no loss basis or on a minimum profit basis.
This is not a correct approach. In the case of vital
commodities or services, while private concerns
must be allowed a minimal return on capital
invested, public undertakings or utilities may even
have to run at losses, if need be and even a minimal
return may not be assured. In the case of less vital,
but still basic, commodities, they may be required to
cater to needs with a minimal profit margin for
themselves.
But given a favourable area of
operation, “commercial profits” need not be either
anathema or forbidden fruit even to public sector
enterprises.”
In this judgment, the court noticed the publication on Public

Enterprise by the Indian Institute of Public Administration, which pointed
out that profits earned by state undertakings, whether operated by the
Central or state undertakings directly or through corporation or companies
which formed part of the surplus of public enterprise play an increasing part
in financing economic development under the various national plans.
Public enterprises in the under-developed areas are to break grounds in
projects which are the core of development. If such projects are to be
financed on an increasing scale, the price policies have to be so designed
that significant surpluses are left with the projects to be employed either for
their own expansion or for financing the expansion of other projects. In
other words, there should be an element of profit in the process of their
299

WP(C) No.10685/2004

products or in the cost of their services to the public.
The court also quoted from the Krishna Menon Committee on
State Undertakings (November, 1959) wherein Dr. V.K.R.V. Rao was
quoted as saying thus :“As regards profits, it should be pointed
out that contrary to same popular notions on the
subject, profits have an important place in a socialist
society, the difference between the economic price
and the social price would be what may be called the
planned profit and this would largely correspond to
the excise duties and sales tax and other indirect
taxes that are imposed in a capitalist society. These
planned profits being no more than a way of
mobilising resources and making them available to
the community for purposes both of investment and
maintenance expenditure. .......
A quotation from an article on “The Public Sector in India” in
'Issues in Public Enterprises' by Shri K.R. Gupta citing Dr. V.K.R.V. Rao,
(at page 84)” was also relied upon by the Apex Court wherein he had stated
thus:“....
the pricing policy should be
such as to promote the growth of national income and
the rate of this growth...public enterprises must make
profits and the larger the share of public enterprises in
all enterprises, the greater is their need for making
profits. Profits constitute the surplus available for
saving and investment on the one hand and
contribution to national social welfare programme on
the other; and if public enterprises do not make profits
the national surplus available for stepping up the rate
of investment and the increase of social welfare will
suffer a corresponding reduction;... Hence the need for
giving up the irrational belief that public enterprise
should, by definition, be run on a no-profit basis.”
337.

The Supreme Court has also had occasion to consider such areas

where instrumentalities of state are occupying a monopoly position in areas
300

WP(C) No.10685/2004

of essentialities for the citizens. This is so amongst others in the case of
electricity boards. The court also drew a distinction between `reasonable
profits' and `undue profits' in an earlier judgment of the Apex Court (which
was also cited in ONGC v. Assn. of Natural Gas Consuming Industries
(supra) reported at (1986) 4 SCC 198 Kerela State Electricity Board v. S.N.
Govinda Prabhu & Bros., the court observed thus :“8.
Shri Potti, learned counsel for the consumers
placed great reliance on the observations of this Court in
Kerala State Electricity Board v. Indian Aluminium Co.,
Bihar State Electricity Board v. Workmen and P. Nalla
Thampy Thera v. Union of India to contend that the
Electricity Board was barred from conducting its
operations on commercial lines so as to earn a profit. In
the first case, the observations relied upon were: (SCC p.
483, para 19)
“Furthermore, Electricity Boards are not trading
corporations. They are public service corporations. They
have to function without any profit motive. Their duty is
to promote coordinated development of the generation,
supply and distribution of electricity in the most efficient
and economical manner with particular reference to such
development in areas not for the time being served or
adequately served by any licensee (Section 18). The only
injunction is that as far as practicable they shall not carry
on their operations at a loss (Section 59). They get
subventions from the State Governments (Section 63). In
the discharge of their functions they are guided by
directions on questions of policy given by the State
Governments (Section 78-A). There are no shareholders
and there is no distribution of profits.”
(emphasis
supplied)
In the second case the Court observed: (SCC p. 234, para
4)
“The Electricity Board it not an ordinary commercial
concern. It is a public service institution. It is not
expected to make any profit. It is expected to extend the
supply of electricity to unserved areas without reference
to considerations of loss that might be incurred as a result
of such extension.
In the third case where the Court was considering the
position of the Indian Railways it was observed: (SCC pp.
604-05, para 14 and p. 609, para 25)
301

WP(C) No.10685/2004

The Indian Railways are a socialised public utility
undertaking. There is at present a general agreement
among writers of repute, that the price policy of such a
public corporation should neither make a loss nor a profit
after meeting all capital charges and this is expressed by
covering all costs or breaking even; and secondly, the
price it charges for the services should correspond to
relative costs. Keeping the history of the growth of the
Railways and their functioning in view, the commendable
view to accept may be that the rates and fares should
cover the total cost of service which would be equal to
operational expenses, interest on investment, depreciation
and payment of public obligation, if any. We need not,
however, express any opinion about it . . . .
We have said earlier that the Railways are public utility
service run on monopoly basis. Since it is a public utility,
there is no justification to run it merely as a commercial
venture with a view to making profits. We do not know —
at any rate it does not fall for consideration here — if a
monopoly based public utility should ever be a
commercial venture geared to support the general revenue
of the State but there is not an iota of hesitation in us to
say that the common man’s mode of transport closely
connected with the free play of this fundamental right
should not be. We agree that the Union Government
should be free to collect the entire operational cost which
would include the interest on the capital outlay out of the
national exchequer. Small marginal profits cannot be
ruled out. The massive operation will require a margin of
adjustment and, therefore, marginal profits should be
admissible.”
We do not think that any of these observations is in
conflict with what we have said. Pure profit motive,
unjustifiable according to us even in the case of a private
trading concern, can never be the sole guiding factor in
the case of a public enterprise. If profit is made not for
profit’s sake but for the purpose of fulfilling, better and
more extensively, the obligation of the services expected
of it, it cannot be said that the public enterprise acted
beyond its authority. The observations in the first case
which were referred to us merely emphasised the fact that
the Electricity Board is not an ordinary trading
corporation and that as a public utility undertaking its
emphasis should be on service and not profit. In the
second case, for example, the Court said that it is not
expected to make any profit and proceeded to explain why
it is not expected to make a profit by saying that it is
expected to extend the supply of electricity to unserved
areas without reference to considerations of loss. It is of
interest that in the second case4, dealing with the question
whether interest cannot be taken into account in working
out profits, the Court observed. (SCC p. 235, para 5)
302

WP(C) No.10685/2004

“The facile assumption by the Tribunal that the interest
should not be taken into account in working out the
profits is not borne out by the provisions of the statute.”
In the third case, the Court appeared to take the view that
the railway rates and fares should cover operational
expenses, interest on investment, depreciation and
payment of public obligations. It was stated more than
once that the total operational cost would include the
interest on the capital outlay out of the national
exchequer. While the Court expressed the view that there
was no justification to run a public utility monopoly
service undertaking merely as a commercial venture with
a view to make profits, the Court did not rule out but
refrained from expressing any opinion on the question
whether a public utility monopoly service undertaking
should ever be geared to earn profits to support the
general revenue of the State.
338.

The clear principle which has been laid down by the Apex Court

thus is that making of profits is not an anathema to public enterprise. Even
in areas of essentialities and obligatory duties and facilities, the State and its
instrumentalities may make reasonable profits which support the general
revenue of the state. It is not necessary for the authority to function on a 'no
profit and no loss' basis or on a mere 'cost plus' basis.
339.

So far as the provision of toilet complexes is concerned, the

same is in the nature of provision of an essential facility to the general
public. In ONGC v. Association of Natural Gas Consuming Industries of
Kerala, 1990 Supp. SCC 317, the Apex Court upheld disparity in principles
between supplies effected to public sector undertakings and public utilities.
The court defined a public utility in para 20 at page 416 of the report thus:“Public Utility - A privately owned and operated
business whose services are so essential to the general
public as to justify the grant of special franchises for the
use of public property or of the right of eminent
303

WP(C) No.10685/2004

domain, in consideration of which the owners must
serve all persons who apply, without discrimination. It
is always a virtual monopoly.”
340.

In (2006) 3 SCC 581 K.K. Bhalla v. State of M.P. & Ors., a

challenge was laid to the allotment of land by the State of M.P. in favour of
the proprietor of a newspaper and a charitable organisation inter alia on the
ground that the grant of rebate in the premium and the ground are violated
on the statutory norms, hence was violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution. The private respondents urged that the allotment was as per
the policy of the respondents and hence amenable to judicial review.
The court held that the State and the development agencies being
creatures of the statute were bound to act within the four corners thereof.
Procedures for disposal of land having been laid down in the rules, power in
that behalf was required to be exercised strictly in conformity thereof and
not de hors the same. The court further held that the policy decision relied
upon by the respondents was ultra vires being contrary to the statutory rules
and consequently no direction for allotment could be made pursuant to such
a policy. Any action by way of a policy decision or otherwise at the hands
of the statutory authority must be in consonance with the statutory rules and
not de hors the same.
341.

For this reason as well, the objection on the part of the MCD that

in the instant case, the contract required the petitioners to perform certain
functions and consequently was in the nature of a contract of service and
hence not enforceable would not apply inasmuch as it failed in handing over

304

WP(C) No.10685/2004

CTCs fit to be operated.
342.

In (1999) 6 SCC 464 M.I. Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. Radhey Shyam

Sahu, the court has occasion to consider the obligatory duties of the U.P.
Municipal Corporation to maintain parks.

The court observed that the

decision to construct an underground shopping complex by M.I. Builders
Pvt. Ltd. was in contravention of the provisions of the U.P. Municipal
Corporation Act and the agreement which was entered with the builder was
against two settled norms and wholly illegal. It was held by the Apex Court
that the boggie of congestion being the reason for justifying the construction
in public interest was introduced only to justify the action of the
mahapalika. The entire exercise was gone into to confer undue benefit on
M.I. Builders, smacked of arbitrariness unreasonableness and irrationality
justifying interference in exercise of powers of judicial review. The court
upon consideration of the manner in which the decision making evolved and
the nature of the agreement which was entered into with the builder held
thus :“57. We may now examine some of the terms of the
agreement dated 4-11-1993. There are six recitals to the
agreements which cannot be correlated to any discussion
in any of the meetings of the Mahapalika, the Executive
Committee or the High Power Committee. Under clause
(2) of the agreement it is for the builder to make a
construction at its own cost and then to realise the cost
with profit not exceeding more than 10% of the
investment in respect of each shop.
Nobody
knows how much cost the builder is likely to incur and
how long it will continue to be in possession of the
shopping complex. Full freedom has been given to the
builder to lease out the shops as per its own terms and
conditions to persons of its choice on behalf of the
305

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Mahapalika and the Mahapalika shall be bound by these
terms and conditions. The builder has also been given
the right to sign the agreement on behalf of the
Mahapalika on the terms and conditions which the
builder may deem fit and proper. The builder is only
required to give a copy of the agreement to the
Mahapalika after its execution and both the Mahapalika
and the builder shall remain bound by the terms of that
agreement. Since there is no project report nobody
knows how many shops the builder would construct and
of what sizes. The Mahapalika is allowed to charge Rs
5000 per shop for every second and subsequent transfer
of shops by the builder but what amount is to be charged
for the first transfer or subsequent transfers is left to the
sole discretion of the builder. A bare glance at the terms
of the agreement shows that not only the clauses of the
agreement are unreasonable for the Mahapalika but they
are atrocious. No person of ordinary prudence shall ever
enter into such an agreement. A trustee, which the
Mahapalika is, has to be more cautious in dealing with
its properties. Valuable land in the heart of a commercial
area has been handed on a platter to the builder for it to
exploit and to make runaway profits. As a matter of fact
on examining the terms of the agreement we find that the
Mahapalika has been completely ousted from the
underground shopping complex for an indefinite period.
It has completely abdicated its functions.
58. To repeat, the agreement is completely one-sided
favouring the builder. A land of immense value has been
handed over to it to construct an underground shopping
complex in violation of the public trust doctrine and the
Master Plan for the city of Lucknow. The Mahapalika
has no right to step in even if there is any violation by
the builder of the terms of the agreement or otherwise.
The Mahapalika, though considered to be the owner of
the land, is completely ousted and divested of the land
for a period which is not definite and which depends
wholly on the discretion of the builder. On the question
of reasonableness reference may be made to Wade on
Administrative Law, 7th Edn., p. 399. The learned author
observed that:
“The court must strive to apply an objective standard
which leaves to the deciding authority the full range of
choices which the legislature is presumed to have
306

WP(C) No.10685/2004

intended. Decisions which are extravagant or capricious
cannot be legitimate.”
Quoting Lord Hailsham, L.C. in W. (an infant), Re where
he said:
“Two reasonable persons can perfectly reasonably come
to opposite conclusions on the same set of facts without
forfeiting their title to be regarded as reasonable.”
The following passage from the treatise would be
relevant:
“This is not therefore the standard of ‘the man on the
Clapham omnibus’. It is the standard indicated by a true
construction of the Act which distinguishes between
what the statutory authority may or may not be
authorised to do. It distinguishes between proper use and
improper abuse of power. It is often expressed by saying
that the decision is unlawful if it is one to which no
reasonable authority could have come. This is the
essence of what is now commonly called ‘Wednesbury
unreasonableness’, after the now famous case in which
Lord Greene, M.R. expounded it as follows:
‘It is true that discretion must be exercised reasonably.
Now what does that mean? Lawyers familiar with the
phraseology used in relation to exercise of statutory
discretions often use the word ‘unreasonable’ in a rather
comprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is
frequently used as a general description of the things that
must not be done. For instance, a person entrusted with a
discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in
law. He must call his own attention to the matters which
he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his
consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has
to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly
be said, and often is said, to be acting ‘unreasonably’.
Similarly, there may be something so absurd that no
sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the
powers of the authority. Warrington, L.J. in Short v.
Poole Corpn. gave the example of the red-haired
teacher, dismissed because she had red hair. This is
unreasonable in one sense. In another it is taking into
consideration extraneous matters. It is so unreasonable
that it might almost be described as being done in bad
faith; and, in fact, all these things run into one another.’
This has become the most frequently cited passage
(though most commonly cited only by its nickname) in
307

WP(C) No.10685/2004

administrative law. It explains how ‘unreasonableness’,
in its classic formulation, covers a multitude of sins.
These various errors commonly result from paying too
much attention to the mere words of the Act and too
little to its general scheme and purpose, and from the
fallacy that unrestricted language naturally confers
unfettered discretion.
Unreasonableness has thus become a generalised rubric
covering not only sheer absurdity or caprice, but
merging into illegitimate motives and purposes, a wide
category or errors commonly described as ‘irrelevant
considerations’, and mistakes and misunderstandings
which can be classed as self-misdirection, or addressing
oneself to the wrong question. But the language used in
the cases shows that, while the abuse of discretion has
this variety of differing legal facets, in practice the
courts often treat them as distinct. When several of them
will fit the case, the court is often inclined to invoke
them all. The one principle that unites them is that
powers must be confined within the true scope and
policy of the Act.
Taken by itself, the standard of unreasonableness is
nominally pitched very high: ‘so absurd that no sensible
person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of
the authority’ (Lord Greene, M.R.); ‘so wrong that no
reasonable person could sensibly take that view’ (Lord
Denning, M.R.); ‘so outrageous in its defiance of logic
or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person
who had applied his mind to the question to be decided
could have arrived at it’ (Lord Diplock). It might seem
from such language that the deliberate decisions of
ministers and other responsible public authorities could
almost never be found wanting. But, as may be seen in
the following pages, there are abundant instances of
legally unreasonable decisions and actions at all levels.
This is not because ministers and public authorities take
leave of their senses, but because the courts in deciding
cases tend to lower the threshold of unreasonableness to
fit their more exacting ideas of administrative good
behaviour.”
59. When we keep in view the principles laid by this
Court in its various judgments and which we have
noticed above, it has to be held that the agreement dated
308

WP(C) No.10685/2004

4-11-1993 is not a valid one. The agreement defies logic.
It is outrageous. It crosses all limits of rationality. The
Mahapalika has certainly acted in a fatuous manner in
entering into such an agreement. It is a case where the
High Court rightly interfered in exercise of its powers of
judicial review keeping in view the principles laid down
by this Court in Tata Cellular v. Union of India. Every
decision of the authority except the judicial decision is
amenable to judicial review and reviewability of such a
decision cannot now be questioned. However, a judicial
review is permissible if the impugned action is against
law or in violation of the prescribed procedure or is
unreasonable, irrational or mala fide. On the principle of
good governance reference was made to a decision of the
Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in State of
Bombay v. Laxmidas Ranchhoddas (AIR Bom at p. 475)
(para 12). It was submitted that bad governance sets a
bad example. That is what exactly happened in the
present case.
60. In State of Bombay v. Laxmidas Ranchhoddas a
Division Bench of the High Court was considering the
argument that the writ of mandamus being discretionary,
the Court should consider whether it should not put a
limitation upon its own powers and jurisdiction. It was
submitted that it was impossible for any State to function
if there was a constant interference by the High Court in
the executive acts performed by the officers of the State.
Chagla, C.J., speaking for the Court, said:
“It may be that interference by the High Court may result
in inconvenience or difficulty in administration. But
what we have to guard against is a much greater evil.
When we find in the modern State wide powers
entrusted to Government, powers which affect the
property and person of the citizen, it is the duty of the
courts to see that those wide powers are exercised in
conformity with what the legislature has prescribed. We
are not oblivious of the fact that in order that the modern
State should function the Government must be armed
with very large powers. But the High Court does not
interfere with the exercise of those powers. The High
Court only interferes when it finds that those powers are
not exercised in accordance with the mandate of the
legislature. Therefore, far from interfering with the good
governance of the State, the Court helps the good
309

WP(C) No.10685/2004

governance by constantly reminding the Government
and its officers that they should act within the four
corners of the statute and not contravene any of the
conditions laid down as a limitation upon their
undoubtedly wide powers. Therefore, even from a
practical point of view, even from the point of view of
the good governance of the State, we think that the High
Court should not be reluctant to issue its prerogative writ
whenever it finds that the sovereign legislature has not
been obeyed and powers have been assumed which the
legislature never conferred upon the executive.”

72. The High Court in its impugned judgment has not
doubted the capacity of M.I. Builders to undertake the
project but then that is not the issue. The question is why
was it not necessary to invite tenders for the project of
such a high cost? Why was it thought that it was only
M.I. Builders in the country who could undertake the
job? Why was the project report not obtained to know
the cost of the project? Why could it not be thought that
there could be any other person who could undertake the
job at a lesser cost and in an equally competent manner?
Public interest has certainly been given a go-by. There
was some undercurrent flowing to award the contract to
M.I. Builders. The High Court said “lest we are taken
amiss we wish to make it clear that we do not doubt
either the bona fides of the authorities or the competence
of the respondents M/s M.I. Builders to enter into the
impugned agreement but we are of the view....” The
competence of M/s M.I. Builders to undertake the
project is not doubted when now it is seen that proper
construction has been made but before taking the
decision to award the contract to it nobody knew its
credentials. No attempt was made whatsoever to
consider if there was any other person more competent
for the job or if of equal competence could offer better
terms. In these circumstances, the dictum contained in
the case of Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v. State of J&K
becomes inapplicable. No advantage can be drawn by
the builder from the decision of this Court in G.B.
Mahajan case as here the whole process of awarding
contract to M.I. Builders has been gone through in an
unabashed manner and in flagrant violation of law with
the sole purpose of conferring benefit on it. All said and
done, we fail to understand the certificate given by the
310

WP(C) No.10685/2004

High Court about the bona fides of the authorities in
awarding the contract to M/s M.I. Builders. The officers
of the Mahapalika, who were impleaded as the
respondents by name, did not file any replies to
contradict the allegations made against them. Rather it
appears that it was a fit case where the High Court
should have directed an enquiry to be made as to how
the project came to be awarded to M.I. Builders
including the conduct of the lawyers.”
343.

The entire proposal to hand over the CTCs to Sulabh commenced

from the certification of its standing and credibility by the Commissioner in
the decision taken on 3rd January, 2004.

This certification received

endorsement in all subsequent decisions. The petitioners have pointed out
that on account of the performance of Sulabh, by an order dated 22nd March,
2000 of the then commissioner of the MCD, out of 164 Jan Suvidha
Complexes given to Sulabh, 66 have been taken back from it. The report
dated 16th November, 1999 was given by a committee appointed by the
MCD on the operation and maintenance of the CTCs which were earlier
allocated to Sulabh on lease basis without charging any licence fee. There
was no material whatsoever contrary to the report of the committee dated
16th November, 1999 before the Commissioner of the MCD on 3 rd January,
2004 or any of the authority. This report on the performance of Sulabh and
the decision of the then Commissioner of the MCD on 22 nd March, 2000 do
not even find mention in the entire decision making when it commenced
from the note dated 3rd January, 2004 and crystalised into the letter dated
19th July, 2004 which forms the basis of the decision taken by the MCD on
25th October, 2004.
311

Even in respect of claim of Sulabh regarding
WP(C) No.10685/2004

exceptional work in other states, several doubts had been created.
344.

Neither the Commissioner nor any authority involved in the

decision making undertook any assessment of the reputation, credibility and
performance of any of the NGOs.

Admittedly large number of these

organizations were successfully operating and maintaining the CTCs
allocated to them. Several of the NGOs were not defaulters in payment of
licence fee even according to the MCD. Some of these NGOs may even be
better than Sulabh in terms of performance. But since no material on this
aspect is available on the records, the same is left in the realm of
speculation.
345.

The MCD is precluded from dealing with the property or

allocating the same to third parties without following due and such process
which is free from the taints of unfairness, arbitrariness and mala fide. A
conscious and considered decision after taking into consideration all
relevant factors including revenue which could possibly be earned is
necessarily to be taken before the CTCs can be allocated or handed over to
any party by entering into a lease or a licence.
346.

As per the principles laid down by the Apex Court, it is open to

the State to carve out an exception or a reasonable classification. Even
preference of a particular institution is permissible on grounds of public
interest. Furtherance of directive principles also permit the authority to
make such preference. However, it is well settled that if assailed, such a
decision would required to withstand judicial scrutiny. In the light of the

312

WP(C) No.10685/2004

above, existence of material in support of the administrative decision of the
authority is also mandatory.
347.

From the above discussion certain imperative facts can be called

out which can be enumerated thus :(i).
A considered and conscious decision was taken by the
Corporation to allot CTCs by inviting tenders or by auction in 1999-2000
“A model form of agreement” was prepared and approved in this behalf.
The decision included a limit that no NGO would be allotted more than two
groups out of the 103 groups formed for allotting 959 CTCs under the
Yamuna Action Plan.
(ii).
Sulabh was one of the short listed NGOs for participating in the
auction programme but opted not to participate in the auction for allotment
of the 959 CTCs under the Yamuna Action Plan.
(iii).
The petitioners have asserted that Sulabh has some kind of
relationship or in any case, commonality of interest and a large measure of
control with the 27 other NGOs who were allotted as many as 309 CTCs out
of the 959 CTCs under the Yamuna ActionPlan. The admitted position is
that 160 CTCs out of these have remained non-functional. These 27 NGOs
owing approximately Rs.1,10,13,494/- towards the licence fee.
(iv).
No objective assessment was undertaken with regard to the work
of operation and maintenance of the CTCs that were auctioned to different
NGOs. The auctions were held in the year 2002 while possession appear to
have been handed over to these CTCs up to June, 2002. In 2004, the
proposal was being mooted to rescind the agreement with these NGOs
without any objective assessment as to the reason for why the CTCs had
remained non-functional and whether the same was solely for the fault of
the NGOs.
(v).
Not a single notice of default was issued by the Municipal
Corporation to any of the NGOs who defaulted in payment of licence fee or
did not operate and maintain the CTCs till hearing in the present matter had
commenced.
(vi)
Clasue 15.5 provided for a seven day notice to the NGOs
where no notice of any kind has been given to the petitioners. Under clause
17, a monitoring, operating and maintenance agency was to be appointed
which has not been done.
(vii)

Most of the NGOs claimed that they had made large number of
313

WP(C) No.10685/2004

CTCs functional by spending out of their own resources. The licence with
the NGOs did not contain any such covenent whereby the NGOs were so
required to do so.
(viii).
In the meetings dated 9th, 10th, 11th, 15th, 17th, 18th July, 2003 and
even the Review Meeting under the Yamuna Action Plan dated 22nd
January, 2004, the defects in the CTCs rendering them non-functional were
noticed and several decisions were taken which were not implemented.
These defects were not attributable to the NGOs.
(ix)
As late as in December, 2002, the MCD submitted a report to the
Ministry of Environment and Forest of the Union of India to the effect that
all the CTCs under the Yamuna Action Plan had not been handed over to
NGOs for operation and maintenance. It has been stated that out of 959
CTCs under the Yamuna Action Plan, only 872 had been handed over to
NGOs and out of these only 633 were functional. This status report
submitted by the MCD also recorded that 289 CTCs were non-functional
due to non-availability of power connection, boring defects etc.
(x)
In the minutes recorded in the several meetings noticed herein,
the engineers have complained that the contractors who built the CTCs have
not been paid. It is noteworthy that the MCD has admitted that the CTCs
suffered from structural and other defects which required rectification
before the Sulabh can operate them in terms of the decision taken on 25th
October, 2004. These structural defects are obviously for the fault of the
contractors who built the CTCs. No action whatsoever has been taken
against the contractors who constructed the CTCs or handed over nonfunctional CTCs to the engineers. It cannot be emphasized enough that the
MCD had in its power and possession the complete record in respect of each
CTC and each NGO. It had with it every detail of the dates from which the
NGOs were liable to pay the licence fees and other charges; the amounts,
which were actually paid, and the dates of the payment as also the defaults.
These complete particulars been withheld from this court.
Not a single letter of cancellation of contract for any breach of
the licence has been placed on record. By a unilateral decision taken on 25 th
October, 2004, it was decided to cancel all the licences without quantifying
the dues of the NGOs or the extent of the default and without any kind of
notice to the NGO.
(xi)
The NGOs to whom the CTCs were allocated under the Yamuna
Action Plan had from the very first opportunity indicated major defects and
shortcomings that existed in the CTCs. The MCD had accepted and
admitted the existence of these shortcomings and several proposals were
mooted with regard to postponement of the date from which the licence fee
was to commenced, subsidy in the rates at which electricity charges would
be payable and other similar proposals. No final decision was taken on
314

WP(C) No.10685/2004

these matters.
(xii)
There are several NGOs other than Sulabh which have been
maintaining CTCs on pay and use basis either for a period of thirty years or
on tender basis in respect of which there is no complaint whatsoever. MCD
is also operating a large number of CTCs without complaint. Yet a blanket
decision was taken to cancel all leases and to hand over the CTCs to Sulabh
on a thirty year lease on totally one sided terms and conditions.
(xiii)
Under the model agreement and the licence which was executed
with the petitioners and the other NGOs, huge amounts were recovered by
the MCD towards security as well as the licence fee. The MCD has
received an amount of RS.51,50,000/- as security deposit under the auction
process and Rs.94,81,185/- as licence fee for the first quarter alone. This
has been stated in a background note on the Yamuna Action Plan which has
been placed before this court by M/s Bhagwati Foundation. The background
note has been prepared by the MCD and not disputed before this court. This
was the kind of revenue which was generated.
(xiv)
The amount of revenue which was being generated or could
have been recovered if the agreements were implemented in right, earnest
and in the correct spirit, is not a relevant factor or a material factor while
taking a decision in respect of public property worth crores of rupees
wherefrom revenue of several crores could be generated which may be put
to use for the benefit of the public at large.
(xv)
The MCD had prohibited advertising rights to those NGOs who
were also responsible for payment of the electricity and water charges and
also had the responsibility of cleaning of septic tank and effecting all
repairs.
(xvi)
So far as dual responsibility which has been cited as a major
reason for cancellation of the contracts with the NGOs is concerned, such
dual responsibility existed in respect of toilets which were given for the
period of thirty years on the thirty year leases which are admittedly working
successfully without any complaint. In the thirty year leases, while the
entire maintenance was done by the NGOs, it remained the responsibility of
the MCD to provide water and electricity and to clean the septic tank.
Therefore, there appears to be no basis for the contention that “dual
responsibility” under the agreement with the NGOs was not successful and
necessitated the change of method of allocation in handing over CTCs to
Sulabh.
(xvii)
As late as on 10th July, 2003, in the minutes of the joint meeting
held on 30th January, 2004 in the note of the Commissioner MCD and the
background note submitted tot he Government of India, there was
315

WP(C) No.10685/2004

acceptance by the MCD that the deficiencies in the CTCs were not removed.
The Assistant Engineer had stated that the contractors was not turning up
and the decision was taken that security to the contractor would not be
released. Several minutes noted that the NGOs were facing difficulty and
that CTCs were not .
It is therefore an admitted position on the part of MCD that all
the NGOs were not defaulters in payment.
(xviii).
The terms and conditions of the auction in which the CTCs were
allocated to the NGOs envisaged deposit of security amount as well as
licence fee. Admittedly, MCD had earned huge amounts running into
several lakhs of rupees towards the security amount and as licence fee.
(xix)
Without any analysis as to what would be the total sum which
would be earned towards the licence fee in respect of all the CTCs in terms
of the agreement entered into between the MCD and the NGOs and also
giving a complete go bye to the model agreement which had been proposed
after a detailed analysis of the experience of the MCD over several decades,
all the prohibitions, terms and conditions stipulated therein were given a go
bye. The MCD proposed and decided not to charge any amount on account
of security or as licence fee from Sulabh. The decision was taken to lease
all the CTCs to Sulabh for a thirty year lease period. Apart from the fact
that Sulabh was not to pay any amount to the MCD, it was still permitted to
charge the users for the toilet use. This was contrary to the very basis from
which the decision of the Standing Committee dated 17th of December, 2003
stemmed whereby the Standing Committee by Resolution No. 673 had
resolved to provide “free of charge” service to Delhites. Against the rupee
one which the NGOs could charge, Sulabh was permitted to charge rupees
one for toilet use only. In small areas and in areas other than slums, it was
increased four times by prescribing the rate of Rs.2 per toilet, Sulabh was
permitted to increase the user charge at the rate of 10% per year. The
petitioner has placed a calculation before this court that by the time, the
thirty year lease is over, the users would be paying Rs.16 for using the toilet
in slum areas and Rs.32 for users in non-slum areas.
348.

From the records produced before this court, it is evident that

there has been neither appropriate consideration of these facts nor the
grounds which have been laid before this court justifying the decision made
out. A semblance of application of mind and a patch work explanation has
been put together to justify a decision.

316

WP(C) No.10685/2004

349.

While the respondents did hold out that certain formal decisions

with regard to payment of licence fee subsidisation of electricity dues etc
and steps to render all the CTCs functional would be taken as noticed
hereinabove, however, the same did not culminate any formal decisions on
the basis of the recommendations by the authorities in the MCD who were
dealing with the matter.
350.

It is also to be noted that the MCD had entered into individual

agreements with the NGOs. Each person was facing different difficulties
and reasons for non-payment of the licence fee. There were individuals
who had paid full payment of the dues as well. As noticed hereinabove,
there were also NGOs who were requesting the MCD to take back
possession of certain CTCs. Certainly, the requirement in law and public
interest was not justified by taking a blanket decision. The MCD was
required to take a considered and comprehensive decision in respect of the
individual NGOs before they could be labeled as defaulters.
351.

No material had been placed before the MCD with regard to the

expenditure which was to be entailed in effecting the repairs of the CTCs
before the decision to bear the same was taken by it. Equally so, even till
the hearing in the case, there is no material with regard to revenue which it
would earn from the advertisement which it could retain. The respondents
had admittedly not assessed, evaluated or considered the economic factors
which could have permitted it to depart from the normal rule of public
auction and pubic tender.

317

WP(C) No.10685/2004

352.

It is important to notice here that this withdrawal of the 66 CTCs from

Sulabh was certainly an important fact which would deserve to be considered by
the MCD before arriving at a decision to award CTCs to Sulabh. There is nothing
on record which could be considered as a circumstance in favour of Sulabh for its
failure to properly operate or manage the CTCs which were earlier allotted to it for
which it was receiving payment from the MCD in fact and the entire costing and
responsibility was also that of the MCD.

Certainly, the decisions of the MCD

cannot be said to be guided by public interest or based on relevant considerations.

353.

From the above, it is amply borne out that certainly the

justification urged before this court was not made out from the facts before
the authorities. It is also apparent from the record that material and relevant
facts which required consideration were ignored.
354.

So far as the present case is concerned, a blanket decision has

been taken by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to the effect that all the
CTCs would be handed over to Sulabh and that all the contracts with the
NGOs would be cancelled. In Shrilekha Vidyarthi (Kumari) v. State of
U.P. (1991) 1 SCC 212, the challenge laid to a circular dated 6th February,
1990 State of Uttar Pradesh terminating the engagement of all the
Government counsel engaged throughout the State of U.P. for civilrevenue/Criminal and urban sealing work on and from 28th February, 1990
and to make new appointment in their place. This decision was challenged
on grounds of arbitrariness.
The challenge before this court is to a similar decision of the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi which took the decision to allot the CTCs
318

WP(C) No.10685/2004

without regards to the accepted method of allotment by way of a
competitive process and to one person and decided to enbloc terminate the
contracts of the petitioners and other NGOs to whom it has been allotted
after competitive bidding. As noticed above, such omnibus decision could
not be supported by the MCD to any relevant material which was before the
authorities at the time of their decision making.
355.

There is no dispute that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi is

exercising jurisdiction from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi Act, 1957.
All discretion has to be exercised in accordance with the discretion
conferred by the statute. It has been urged on behalf of both the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi as well as Sulabh that the exercise of discretion by the
MCD is not amenable to judicial review. It would be useful to refer to the
principles laid down by the Apex Court with regard to exercise of discretion
under statutory provisions.

In this behalf, the judicial pronouncement

reported in (1991) 4 SCC 54 Bangalore Medical Trust Vs. B.S. Muddappa
& Ors. is both topical and constructive. The court held thus:“48. Much was attempted to be made out of exercise of
discretion in converting a site reserved for amenity as a
civic amenity. Discretion is an effective tool in
administration. But wrong notions about it results in illconceived consequences. In law it provides an option to
the authority concerned to adopt one or the other
alternative. But a better, proper and legal exercise of
discretion is one where the authority examines the fact,
is aware of law and then decides objectively and
rationally what serves the interest better. When a statute
either provides guidance or rules or regulations are
framed for exercise of discretion then the action should
be in accordance with it. Even where statutes are silent
319

WP(C) No.10685/2004

356.

and only power is conferred to act in one or the other
manner, the Authority cannot act whimsically or
arbitrarily. It should be guided by reasonableness and
fairness. The legislature never intends its authorities to
abuse the law or use it unfairly.”
The submissions made in the affidavits of the Municipal

Corporation of Delhi could not be substantiated by it nor has it been able to
establish that either the Commissioner or the Sub-committee, or the Full
House of the Corporation took into consideration all relevant factors noticed
hereinabove.
In fact, having taken a decision to allot the CTCs to Sulabh, a
crude effort was made to support the executive action. Such action was
undoubtedly destructive of forthrightness and fairness.

On all relevant

dates MCD was conscious that its decision had been challenged by way o
fthe present writ petition and has to be tested on the anvil of law
establishing the interest of members of the society was involved.
357.

I may also deal with the submission made by Mr. P.N. Lekhi,

learned senior counsel for the petitioner to the effect that the petitioners
have not laid any pleadings which they were bound to do so in support of
their writ petition and that the writ petitions deserve to be rejected on this
sole ground alone.

In this behalf, reliance has been placed on the

pronouncement of the Supreme Court in (1988) 4 SCC 534 Bharat Singh v.
State of Haryana.
It is pointed out that in para 13 of its pronouncement reported at
(1988) 4 SCC 534 entitled Bharat Singh vs. State of Haryana the Apex
Court held that merely pleadings as to profiteering by the State in a writ
320

WP(C) No.10685/2004

petition was a pleading in abstract without any reference to any material in
support thereof. No particulars or facts were laid even before the Apex
Court but the point was sought to be substantiated at the time of hearing
while referring to certain facts stated in the application of the respondentHSIDC. The Apex Court in these circumstances held thus:-

358.

“13. As has been already noticed, although the point as
to profiteering by the State was pleaded in the writ
petitions before the High Court as an abstract point of
law, there was no reference to any material in support
thereof nor was the point argued at the hearing of the
writ petitions. Before us also, no particulars and no facts
have been given in the special leave petitions or in the
writ petitions or in any affidavit, but the point has been
sought to be substantiated at the time of hearing by
referring to certain facts stated in the said application by
HSIDC. In our opinion, when a point which is ostensibly
a point of law is required to be substantiated by facts, the
party raising the point, if he is the writ petitioner, must
plead and prove such facts by evidence which must
appear from the writ petition and if he is the respondent,
from the counter-affidavit. If the facts are not pleaded or
the evidence in support of such facts is not annexed to
the writ petition or to the counter-affidavit, as the case
may be, the court will not entertain the point. In this
context, it will not be out of place to point out that in
this regard there is a distinction between a pleading
under the Code of Civil Procedure and a writ petition or
a counter-affidavit. While in a pleading, that is, a plaint
or a written statement, the facts and not evidence are
required to be pleaded, in a writ petition or in the
counter-affidavit not only the facts but also the evidence
in proof of such facts have to be pleaded and annexed to
it. So, the point that has been raised before us by the
appellants is not entertainable. But, in spite of that, we
have entertained it to show that it is devoid of any merit.
It was urged that the petitioners have laid no factual basis for

their arguments and reliance was placed on AIR 1962 SC 458 entitled

321

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Board of Trustees, Ayurvedic and Unani College, Delhi vs. State of
Delhi(para 21) wherein the court held thus:“In our view the petitioners have not made out any basis
for the contention that (1) there were other institutions
similarly situated, and (2) petitioner no.1 was picked out
for unequal treatment. The names of no other institutions
similarly situated have been disclosed. In the first
Sholapur case Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri vs. Union of
India, 1950 SCR 869: (AIR 1951 SC 41), it was held by a
majority of Judges of this Court that even one corporation,
(in our case one society) or a group of persons can be
taken as a class by itself for the purpose of legislation,
provided it exhibits some exceptional features which are
not possessed by others.

359.

The Courts should prima facie lean in favour
of constitutionality and should support the
legislation if it is possible to do so on any
reasonable ground, and it is for the party who
attacks the validity of the legislation to place
all materials before the court which would go
to show that the selection is arbitrary and
unsupportable. Throwing out of vague hints
that there may be other instances of similar
nature is not enough for this purpose.”
I have dwelt at length with the case set up by the petitioners. In

this regard, the assertions of some of the petitioners are noticed in several
paras hereinabove.

Several representations of the writ petitioners and

minutes of joint meetings as annexed to the petitions, have been dwelt at
length above. and elsewhere are necessary. Similar assertions have been
made in all other writ petitions. Before this court, the petitioners have
enclosed as annexures, their various representations and complaints to the
MCD. Reports of field monitors have been annexed with the writ petition
and placed before the court as also the minutes of the joint meetings held by
the officials of the MCD. The petitioners have assailed the action of the
322

WP(C) No.10685/2004

MCD to allot all the CTCs to Sulabh the allegations of arbitrariness,
discrimination on the ground that the same is opposed to public interest. At
the same time, a challenge has been laid to the consequent decision taken by
the MCD to cancel the allocations of the CTCs to the petitioners. In the
light of what is noticed above and the principles on which such a challenge
has to be examined, it cannot be contended that the necessary averments
and the material has not been laid before this court.
Challenge on the ground that the decision results in creation of a
monopoly
360.

The decision taken by MCD has been challenged on another

grounds by the petitioners. It has been asserted that by the impugned
action, the respondents have created a monopoly in favour of Sulabh which
is in violation of Article 14 and 19(1) of the Constitution of India.
It is further asserted that the MCD has appointed Sulabh by an
executive order which, being not a law, is opposed to the provisions of
Article 19(6) of the Constitution.
361.

Such an issue has arisen for consideration before the Apex Court

on several occasions. I find that again this is legally permissible only as an
exception. The Apex Court has held that the monopoly as contemplated
under Article 19(6) of the Constitution is something which leads to the total
exclusion of others. Creation of a small captive market in favour of a state
owned undertaking out of a larger market has been held to not create a
monopoly as contemplated under Article 19(6) of the Constitution, when the

323

WP(C) No.10685/2004

captive market has been found to consist of only state owned institutions.
Thus, in AIR 1955 SC 549 Rai Sahib Ram Java v. State of
Punjab, the court was considering a restriction imposed by the state on
purchase of text books and held that a publisher did not have the right to
insist on any of his books being accept as text books.
In (1974) 4 SCC 788 Narain Das Indurkhya v. State of M.P.,
the court also followed the principles laid down in Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya
Kapur's case.
Again in (1981) 4 SCC 471 Sarkari Sasta Anaj Vikreta Sangh
v. State of M.P., the court was concerned with the right of the state to give
preference to cooperative societies in the matter of allotment of fair price
shops. In this case, the court observed that cooperative societies play a
positive and progressive role in the economy of our country and most surely
in the fair and effective distribution of essential articles of food.
Consequently, it was held that “there

certainly was a reasonable

classification and a nexus with the object intended to be achieved, which
was a fair and assured supply of rations to the consumers. The fundamental
right of traders like the petitioners to carry on business and foodstuffs was
in no way effected.

They could carry on trade in foodstuffs without

hinderance as dealers, only, they could not run fair price shops as agents of
the Government. No one could claim a right to run a fair price shop as an
agent of the Government.

All that he could claim was a right to be

considered to be appointed as an agent of the Government to run a fair price

324

WP(C) No.10685/2004

shop.

If the Government took a policy decision to prefer consumers'

cooperative societies for appointment as their agents to run fair price shops,
in the light of the frustrating and unfortunate experience gathered in the last
two decades, there can be no discrimination.”
362.

In (1986) 3 SC 398 Hindustan Paper Corpn. Ltd. v.

Government of Kerala, the Supreme Court held that in appropriate cases in
order to place an industry owned by the Government on an enduring basis in
the national interest, some concessions could be shown to it. It was further
held that the preference shown to government companies cannot be
considered to be discriminatory as they stand in a different class altogether
and the classification made between government companies and the others
for the purpose of the statute in question was a valid one.
363.

Again while dealing with the preference given by the

Government of Kerala to the institutions run by the cooperative societies in
supply of pump sets, the Supreme Court in (1997) 9 SCC 495 Krishnan
Kakkanth v. Government of Kerala cited with approval the principles laid
down by the Supreme Court in an earlier judgment rendered in Saghir
Ahmad v. State of U.P. reported at AIR 1954 SC 728.

In Krishnan

Kakkanth's case (supra), the court cited with approval the following
principles from the earlier case :“28.
Under clause (1)(g) of Article 19, every
citizen has a freedom and right to choose his own
employment or take up any trade or calling subject only
to the limits as may be imposed by the State in the
interests of public welfare and the other grounds
mentioned in clause (6) of Article 19. But it may be
325

WP(C) No.10685/2004

emphasised that the Constitution does not recognise
franchise or rights to business which are dependent on
grants by the State or business affected by public
interest.”
Disparities in price which were permitted between supplies to

364.

public sector undertakings and private industries was upheld in the 1990
Supp SCC 397 Oil & Natural Gas Commission v. Assn. Of Natural Gas
Consuming Industries of Gujarat. The Apex Court held that a favourable
treatment of public sector organisations, particularly the ones dealing with
essential commodities or services, would not be discriminatory.
365.

From the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the

aforenoticed decisions, it is clear that such decision which would partially
affect the sale prospects of a company, cannot be equated with creation of a
monopoly.

In each of the cases above, the decision was based on

considerations of public interest and furtherance of interest of the State.
Thus, it has been held that preference shown to cooperative institutions or
public sector undertakings being in public interest, would not be construed
as arbitrary so as to give rise to a contention of violation of Article 14 of the
Constitution as the same is in public interest.
366.

The aforenoticed principles of the Apex Court were reiterated in

(1999) 6 SCC 247 entitled Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd. & Ors.
v. Punjab Drugs Manufacturers Association & Ors. wherein the court
rejected a challenge to the decision of the State Government to purchase
certain medicines for government hospitals and dispensaries only from
public sector companies or companies in which the State had substantial

326

WP(C) No.10685/2004

interest. The Supreme Court had held that such a policy neither created a
monopoly in favour of public sector undertakings nor was discriminatory.
Such a policy merely created a small captive market in favour of State
owned undertakings out of a larger market and consequently could hardly
be termed as creation of a monopoly.
367.

These principles however shall not arise in a case as the present

where the court is concerned with the action of the state with reference to
picking and choosing of private individuals to award contracts as the court
was not dealing with a case in which the State chose to make a classification
between a private manufacturer and a public sector undertaking. In such a
case, the principles laid down by the Apex Court in Ramana Dayaram
Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India AIR 1979 SC 1628 :
(1979) 3 SCC 489 would apply.
368.

In the case in hand, the MCD has made a choice not between a

cooperative society, public sector undertaking or an undertaking in which
the state or a statutory authority had substantial interest on the one hand and
private organisations on the other. The MCD has made a choice between
different non-governmental organisations concerned with the work of
running, operating and maintaining toilet complexes.

Therefore, the

considerations which weighed with the Apex Court in holding that it was
permissible for the authority to choose or create a “captive market” in
respect of the services may not apply.
The question which remains to be answered is whether such a

327

WP(C) No.10685/2004

choice can be effected even if a monopoly is created, having regard to the
nature of service or facility which was to be provided to the public at large?
369.

It has been pointed out that without undertaking any survey or

inspection or even examining as to on whom fault was attributable, on the
submission of Sulabh that taking only 364 CTCs was not a viable
proposition and that all 959 CTCs be given to it on the thirty year lease
without any licence fee, the decision was taken by the MCD to allocate all
1963 CTCs to Sulabh.
In respect of most of these CTCs, MCD was not complaining of
any difficulty whatsoever.
370.

Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned senior counsel for some of the

petitioners has also pointed out that the MCD by its decision has completely
abdicated what are stated to be the obligatory function of the MCD.
Allotment based on cross subsidization was introduced at the instance of
Sulabh. No assessment of the expenditure involved in undertaking the
repairs and provision of the electricity, water, septic tank was undertaken
nor the revenue which could be earned from advertising calculated or
estimated. A blanket decision was taken to grant of these rights to Sulabh at
the demand of the same raised by the organization. Sulabh was required to
conduct the survey and inspection. After the decision was taken to cancel
the contract, then steps taken to undertake a survey and to issue notices to
the petitioners as noticed hereinabove.
371.

A stand has been taken on behalf of the Municipal Corporation

328

WP(C) No.10685/2004

of Delhi that under clause 10 of the agreement with the NGOs; the NGO
was required to ask for advertising rights in respect of the CTCs and that
since no NGO asked for such right, none was permitted to advertisement.
In this behalf, the Jan Sudhar Committee, petitioner in W.P.(C)
13389/2004 has submitted that it asked for advertisement rights but its
request were completely ignored by the MCD.
372.

Exercise of power is tested before the courts on whether relevant

considerations have gone in and irrelevant considerations kept out of
determination. It is equally well settled that reasonableness for purposes of
judging whether there was an 'excess of power' or an 'arbitrary' exercise of
it, is really the demonstration of a reasonable nexus between the matters
which are taken into account in exercising a power and the purposes of
exercise of that power (Ref: (1974) 2 SCC 630 at para 13, Saraswati
Industries Syndicate Ltd. Vs. Union of India).
373.

In (1989) 4 SCC 187 Supreme Court Employees' Welfare

Association Vs. Union of India & Anr., it was held that an act is ultra vires
either because the authority has acted in excess of its power in the narrow
sense, or because it has abused its power by acting in bad faith or for an
inadmissible purpose or on irrelevant grounds or without regard to relevant
considerations or with gross unreasonableness. These principles were laid
down by Lord Greene M.R. in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd.
Vs. Wednesbury Corporation in (1947) 2 All ER 680.
Power is exercised in bad faith where its repository is motivated

329

WP(C) No.10685/2004

by personal animosity towards those who are directly affected by its
exercise. Power is no less abused even when it is exercised in good faith
but for an unauthorized purpose or on irrelevant grounds etc. It was so
stated by Lord Macnaghten in Westminster Corporation Vs. London and
North Western Railway Co. in 1905 AC 426.
374.

The principles were restated by the Apex Court in AIR 1967 SC

295 at 323, Barium Chemicals Ltd. Vs. Company Law Board thus:“Even if (the statutory order) is passed in good faith and
with the best of intention to further the purpose of the
legislation which confers the powers, since the Authority
has to act in accordance with and within the limits of that
legislation, its order can also be challenged if it is
beyond those limits or is passed on grounds extraneous
to the legislation or if there are no grounds at all for
passing it or if the grounds are such that no one can
reasonably arrive at the opinion or satisfaction it can
well be said that the authority did not honestly form its
opinion or that in forming it, it did not apply its mind to
the relevant facts.”
375.

The power of judicial review can be exercised suo moto if an

illegality is brought to the notice of the court. It was so held in (2006) 3
SCC 581 K.K. Bhalla v. State of M.P.(para 74); (1987) 1 SCC 222 Sham
Lal v. Atme Nand Jain Sabha (Retd.); (2003) 8 SCC 567 Chairman &
M.D., BPL Ltd. v. S.P. Gururaja; (2003) 7 SCC 546 Guruvayoor
Devaswom Managing Committee v. C.K. Rajan.
376.

The position of the MCD therefore has to be tested in the light of

these well settled and binding principles of law. In (2003) 8 SCC 5 M & T
Consultants, Secunderabad Vs. S.Y. Nawab, the court held thus:“17.
330

A careful and dispassionate assessment and
WP(C) No.10685/2004

377.

consideration of the materials placed on record does not
leave any reasonable impression, on the peculiar facts
and circumstances of this case, that anything obnoxious
which requires either public criticism or condemnation
by courts of law had taken place. It is by now well
settled that non-floating of tenders or absence of public
auction or invitation alone is no sufficient reasons to
castigate the move or an action of a public authority as
either arbitrary or unreasonable or amounting to mala
fide or improper exercise or improper abuse of power by
the authority concerned. Courts have always leaned in
favour of sufficient latitude being left
with the
authorities to adopt their own techniques of management
of projects with concomitant economic expediencies
depending upon the exigencies of a situation guided by
appropriate financial policy in the best interests of the
authority motivated by public interest as well in
undertaking such ventures.”
So far as the provision of toilet complexes is concerned, the

same is in the nature of provision of an essential facility to the general
public. In ONGC v. Association of Natural Gas Consuming Industries of
Kerala, 1990 Supp. SCC 317, the Apex Court upheld disparity in principles
between supplies effected to public sector undertakings and public utilities.
The court defined a public utility in para 20 at page 416 of the report thus:-

378.

“Public Utility - A privately owned and operated
business whose services are so essential to the general
public as to justify the grant of special franchises for the
use of public property or of the right of eminent
domain, in consideration of which the owners must
serve all persons who apply, without discrimination. It
is always a virtual monopoly.”
In (2006) 3 SCC 581 K.K. Bhalla v. State of M.P. & Ors., a

challenge was laid to the allotment of land by the State of M.P. in favour of
the proprietor of a newspaper and a charitable organisation inter alia on the
ground that the grant of rebate in the premium and the ground are violated
on the statutory norms, hence was violative of Article 14 of the
331

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Constitution. The private respondents urged that the allotment was as per
the policy of the respondents and hence amenable to judicial review.
The court held that the State and the development agencies being
creators of the statute were bound to act within the four corners thereof.
Procedures for disposal of land having been laid down in the rules, power in
that behalf was required to be exercised strictly in conformity thereof and
not de hors the same. The court further held that the policy decision relied
upon by the respondents was ultra vires being contrary to the statutory rules
and consequently no direction for allotment could be made pursuant to such
a policy. Any action by way of a policy decision or otherwise at the hands
of the statutory authority must be in consonance with the statutory rules and
not de hors the same.
379.

It is well settled that public orders, publically made in exercise of

a statutory authority cannot be construed in the light of explanations
subsequently given by the officers making the order of what he meant, or
what was in his mind; or what he intended to do. Public orders made by
public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect
the actions and conduct of those to whom they are addressed and must be
construed objectively with reference to the language in the order itself. It
was so held in (1952) SCR 135 = AIR 1952 SC 16 Commissioner of Police
v. Gordhandas Bhanji.
In (1978) 1 SCC 405 Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election
Commissioner, the court further observed that “orders are not like old wine

332

WP(C) No.10685/2004

becoming better as they grow older” and held thus:“8.
The second equally relevant
matter is that when a statutory functionary makes an
order based on certain grounds, its validity must be
judged by the reasons so mentioned and cannot be
supplemented by fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit
or otherwise.
Otherwise, an order bad in the
beginning may, by the time it comes to court on
account of a challenge, get validated by additional
grounds later brought out. We may here draw
attention to the observations of Bose, J. in
Gordhandas Bhanji.”
These principles were followed by the Apex Court in (2004) 2
SCC 65 Bahadursinh Lakhubhai Gohil v. Jagdishbhai M. Kamalia and
(2005) 7 SCC 627 (at p. 639) Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. v. Darius
Shapur Chenai.
380.

From the foregoing discussion, there was nothing before the

Commissioner, MCD on 3rd January, 2004 or 30th April, 2004 to the effect
that all the NGOs were incapable of providing the necessary service or were
defaulters, there was no material to this effect even before the SubCommittee which submitted its report in July, 2004 or before the Full House
of the Corporation when it took the decision in October, 2004.

Two

questions required to be answered which were : firstly, whether all the
NGOs were incapable of operating and maintaining the CTCs and were
defaulters? Secondly, whether Sulabh was the best suited and the only
organisation capable of providing the requisite services? In the light of the
material which has been placed before this court and the reasoning given in
the decisions placed before this Committee, the answer to both these

333

WP(C) No.10685/2004

questions is clearly in the negative and has to be an emphatic no. In view
of the principles laid down by the Apex Court, so far as material supporting
decision is concerned, therefore, it is apparent that the MCD cannot support
its decisions with its assessments, reasons and tabulations given in the
counter affidavits or the written submissions filed before this court.
381.

Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned senior counsel appearing for the

petitioner has urged that in view of the respondents stand that the decision
was a collective decision, it is not the petitioner's case that personal
malafides are attributable to any person. It is urged that in the instant case,
the decision to take away the CTCs from all the NGOs and hand them over
to Sulabh suffers from gross legal malafides.
382.

In (2006) 3 SCC 581 K.K. Bhalla v. State of M.P., the court

further held that malice may either be on fact or in law. Passing of an order
for unauthorised purpose constitutes malice in law (see (2005) 6 SCC 776
Punjab SEB Ltd. v. Zora Singh ; (2005) 8 SCC 394 Union of India v. V.
Ramakrishnan).
383.

It would be useful to consider the principles laid down by the

Apex Court in AIR 1979 SC 49 Smt. S.R. Venkataraman Vs. Union of
India & Another wherein the court stated thus:
“5.
We have made a mention of the plea of malice
which the appellant had taken in her writ petition.
Although she made an allegation of malice against V.D.
Vyas under whom she served for a very short period and
got an adverse report, there is nothing on the record to
show that Vyas was able to influence the Central
Government in making the order of premature retirement
dated March 26, 1976. It is not therefore the case of the
334

WP(C) No.10685/2004

appellant that there was actual malicious intention on the
part of the Government in making the alleged wrongful
order of her premature retirement so as to amount to malice
in fact. Malice in law is, however, quite different.
Viscount Haldane described it as follows in Shearer V.
Shields, (1914) AC 808 at p. 813:“A person who inflicts an injury upon another person in
contravention of the law is not allowed to say that he did
so with an innocent mind; he is taken to know the law, and
he must at within the law. He may, therefore, be guilty of
malice in law, although, so far the state of his mind is
concerned, he acts ignorantly, and in that sense
innocently”.
Thus, malice in its legal sense means malice
such as may be assumed from the doing of a wrongful act
intentionally but without just cause or excuse, or for want
of reasonable or probable cause.
6.
It is however not necessary to examine the
question of malice in law in this case, for it is trite law that
if a discretionary power has been exercised for an
unauthorised purpose, it is generally immaterial whether its
repository was acting in good faith or in bad faith. As was
stated by Lord Goddard C.J., in Pilling Vs. Abergele Urban
District Council, (1950) 1 KB 636 where a duty to
determine a question is conferred on an authority which
state their reasons for the decision, “and the reasons which
they state show that they have taken into account matters
which they ought not to have taken into account, or that
they have failed to take matters into account which they
ought to have taken into account, the court to which an
appeal lies can and ought to adjudicate on the matter.”
7.
The principle which is applicable in such cases
has thus been stated by Lord Esher M.R. in The Queen on
the Prosecution of Richard Westbrook Vs. The Vestry of
St. Pancras, (1890) 24 QBD 371 at p. 375:“If people who have to exercise a public duty by exercising
their discretion take into account matters which the Courts
consider not to be proper for the guidance of their
discretion then in the eye of the law they have not
exercised their discretion.”
This view has been followed in Sedler Vs. Sheffield
Corporation, (1924) 1 Ch 483.

335

WP(C) No.10685/2004

384.

8.
We are in agreement with this view. It is
equally true that there will be an error of fact when a
public body is prompted by a mistaken belief in the
existence of a non-existing fact or circumstance. This is
so clearly unreasonable that what is done under such a
mistaken belief might almost be said to have been done in
bad faith; and in actual experience, and as things go, these
may well be said to run into one another.”
In AIR 1985 SC 1622 The Collector (District Magistrate)

Allahabad & Anr. Vs. Raja Ram Jaiswal, court held that:“26. Where power is conferred to achieve a purpose has been
repeatedly reiterated that the power must be exercised reasonably
and in good faith to effectuate a purpose. And in this context 'in
good faith' means 'for legitimate reasons'! Where power is
exercised for extraneous or irrelevant considerations or reasons, it
is unquestionably a colourable exercise of power or fraud on
power and the exercise of power is vitiated. If the power to
acquire land is to be exercised, it must be exercised bona fide for
the statutory purpose and for none other. If it is exercised for an
extraneous, irrelevant or non-germane consideration, the
acquiring authority can be charged with legal mala fides. In such
a situation there is no question of any personal ill-will or motive.
In Municipal Council of Sydney Vs. Campbell, 1925 AC 338 at
p. 375 it was observed that irrelevant considerations on which
power to acquire land is exercised, would vitiate compulsory
purchase orders or scheme depending on them. In State of Punjab
Vs. Gurdial Singh, (1980) 1 SCR 1071: (AIR 1980 SC 319)
acquisition of land for constructing a grain market was
challenged on the ground of legal mala fides. Upholding the
challenge of this Court speaking through Krishna Iyer, J.
explained the concept of legal mala fides in his hitherto
inimitable language, diction and style and observed as under (at
page 321 of AIR):
“Pithily put, bad faith which invalidates the
exercise of power – sometimes called colourable
exercise or fraud on power and oftentimes
overlaps motive, passions and satisfactions – is
the attainment of ends beyond the sanctioned
purposes of power by simulation or pretension of
gaining a legitimate goal. If the use of the power
is for the fulfilment of a legitimate object the
actuation or catalysation by malice is not
legicidal. The action is bad where the true object
is to reach an end different from the one for which
336

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the power is entrusted, goaded by extraneous
considerations, good or bad, but irrelevant to the
entrustment. When the custodian of power is
influenced in its exercise by considerations
outside those for promotion of which the power is
vested the court calls it a colourable exercise and
is undeceived by illusion. In a broad, blurred
sense Benjamin Disraeli was not of the mark even
in Law when he stated: “I repeat.....that all power
is a trust – that, from the people, and for the
people, all springs, and all must exist.”

385.

After analysing the factual matrix, it was concluded that
the land was not needed for a Mandi which was the
ostensible purpose for which the land was sought to be
acquired but in truth and reality, the Mandi need was
hijacked to reach the private destination of depriving an
enemy of his land through backseat driving of the
statutory engine. The notification was declared invalid
on the ground that it suffers from legal mala fides. The
case before us is much stronger, for more disturbing and
unparalleled in influencing official decision by sheer
weight of personal clout. The District Magistrate was
chagrined to swallow the bitter pill that he was forced to
acquire land even though he was personally convinced
there was no need but a pretence.
therefore,
disagreeing with the High Court, we are of the opinion,
that the power to acquire land was exercised for an
extraneous and irrelevant purpose and it was colourable
exercise of power, namely, to satisfy the chagrin and
anguish of the Sammelan at the coming up of cinema
theater in the vicinity of its campus, which it vowed to
destroy. Therefore, the impugned notification has to be
declared illegal and invalid for this additional ground.
It has been urged at great length by Mr. P.N. Lekhi, learned

senior counsel that in view of the provisions of Article 243 R of the
Constitution of India, the MCD acquires the status of a local self
government and its policy decision is not amenable to judicial review. It
has been alleged that the policy decision has been taken by a duly elected
representative opted which is not amenable to judicial review.

337

WP(C) No.10685/2004

In this

behalf, reliance has been placed on the pronouncement of the Apex Court in
(2005) 5 SCC 409 (paras 18 to 25) Ramesh Mehta v. Sanwal Chand
Singhvi.
It has been urged that in view of the constitutional provision
after the 74th Amendment Act of 1994, the panchayats and corporation
became authorities under the Constitution and a policy decision taken by
them could not be impugned.
In this case, the Apex Court had occasion to examine a challenge
to the elections to the municipal board. This judgment has no application in
the facts and circumstances of the present case. Furthermore, the decision is
no where akin to legislation or quasi-legislation or even a policy decision as
has been noticed hereinabove.
386.

As per the constitutional scheme, and the binding principles of

law laid down by the Apex Court, even an Act of Parliament in effectuating
legislation is open to judicial review on grounds of violation of Article 14.
This being the position in law, it certainly cannot be urged that the decision
of the MCD to award to the contract of running and maintenance of CTCs
to a particular person is not amenable to judicial review in the light of the
position of the MCD by virtue of Article 243 R of the Constitution.
For the same reason, the principles laid down in AIR 1992
Allahabad 62 A. Narain Singh v. State of U.P. and 2003 2 All.E.R. 497
Sheldrake v. Directorate of Public Prosecution would have no application.
387.

This contention must fail for yet another reason. Learned senior

338

WP(C) No.10685/2004

counsel appearing for the MCD had submitted that it does not support the
submission on behalf of Sulabh in this behalf. It was urged that the decision
urged on behalf of the MCD was an administrative decision and amenable
to limited scrutiny by the courts as has been noticed in the judgments relied
upon on behalf of the MCD. The members of the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi even though they are elected, while taking decision as in the instant
case, certainly are not rendered as legislators and have not made any laws
which have been impugned before this court.
In this behalf, even in the pronouncement relied upon by Mr.
P.N. Lekhi, learned senior counsel appearing for Sulabh in AIR 1968 SC
1232 Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Birla Cotton & Spinning Mills, the
Apex Court noticed that it is only in Chapter VIII of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act that the corporation has powers to frame rights etc which
amount to subordinate legislation.
388.

Mr. P.N. Lekhi, learned senior counsel has urged that the

decision of the Commissioner of the MCD was dispassionate and made in
the facts and circumstances on record in public interest. It has been urged
that the same cannot be impugned even on grounds of bias. In this behalf
reliance was placed on (2004) 8 SCC 788 M.P. Special Police
Establishments v. State of M.P. No such argument has been laid before this
court by the petitioners.
389.

It now becomes necessary to examine the position of law in

respect of the last contention urged on behalf of the Sulabh Sauchalya. It

339

WP(C) No.10685/2004

has been urged that even if this Court was to hold against the respondents
on all the other contentions, even then the present case is not a fit case for
exercise of the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article
226 of the Constitution of India.

Undoubtedly, there is a distinction

between writs which are issued as a matter of right, such as a writ of habeas
corpus and those issued in its exercise of discretion such as certiorari and
mandamus. The jurisdiction to do so has been conferred upon the High
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India whereby the High
Court exercises control over, inter alia, Government functioning and
enforces obedience of laws and rules by enforcing proper, fair and just good
of it. Where the Government or any authority passes an order which is
contrary to rules or law, it becomes amenable to correction by the courts in
exercise of writ jurisdiction. But one of the principles inherent in it is that
the exercise of power should be for the sake of justice.
390.

In 1994(2) SCC 481 State of Maharashtra and others vs.

Prabhu, the Apex Court held that one of the principles inherent in the
exercise of the High Court powers under Article 226 should be for the sake
of justice. One of the yard sticks for it is, if the quashing of the orders
results in greater harm of the society then the Court may restrain from
exercising the power.
On this test the Apex Court in Prabhu's case(supra) held that the
social injury by appointing the respondent to an office of responsibility as a
member of the Board, when he had been found responsible for mass

340

WP(C) No.10685/2004

copying at the examination centre of which he was a supervisor, would be
more harmful to the society. The social injury by nominating or appointing
the respondent to an office of such responsibility would not only have raised
eyebrows in the educational circles but would have created an unhealthy
atmosphere and shaken the confidence and faith of the society in the system
and was prone to encouraging even the honest and sincere to deviate from
their path. As a custodian of the Constitution, it is the responsibility of the
High Court to maintain a social balance by interfering where necessary for
the sake of justice and refusal to do so where it is against the social interest
and the public good.
391.

It would be appropriate to notice the observations of the Apex

Court in 1997 (1) SCC 134 Ramnik Lal Butta's & Anr. Vs. State of
Maharashtra wherein the Apex Court laid down the principle that it is not
necessary for a court exercising jurisdiction in equity to grant a relief prayed
for merely on the making out of a legal point, if the larger interests of the
public so require. It was held that public interest would over ride any
considerations of individual interest. In the judgment of the court reported
at 1997(1) SCC 134 Ramniklal N. Bhutta & Anr. v. State of Maharashtra
& Ors., the Supreme Court observed thus :“10. Before parting with the case, we think it
necessary to make a few observations relevant to land
acquisition proceedings. Our country is now launched
upon an ambitious programme of all-round economic
advancement to make our economy competitive in the
world market. We are anxious to attract foreign direct
investment to the maximum extent. We propose to
compete with China economically. We wish to attain the
341

WP(C) No.10685/2004

pace of progress achieved by some of the Asian
countries, referred to as “Asian Tigers”, e.g., South
Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. It is, however, recognised
on all hands that the infrastructure necessary for
sustaining such a pace of progress is woefully lacking in
our country. The means of transportation, power and
communications are in dire need of substantial
improvement, expansion and modernisation. These
things very often call for acquisition of land and that too
without any delay. It is, however, natural that in most
cases, the persons affected challenge the acquisition
proceedings in courts. These challenges are generally in
the shape of writ petitions filed in High Courts.
Invariably, stay of acquisition is asked for and in some
cases, orders by way of stay or injunction are also made.
Whatever may have been the practices in the past, a time
has come where the courts should keep the larger public
interest in mind while exercising their power of granting
stay/injunction. The power under Article 226 is
discretionary. It will be exercised only in furtherance of
interests of justice and not merely on the making out of a
legal point. And in the matter of land acquisition for
public purposes, the interests of justice and public
interest coalesce. They are very often one and the same.
Even in a civil suit, granting of injunction or other
similar orders, more particularly of an interlocutory
nature, is equally discretionary. The courts have to
weigh the public interest vis a vis the private interest
while exercising the power under Article 226 – indeed
any of their discretionary powers. It may even be open
to the High Court to direct, in case it finds finally that
the acquisition was vitiated on account of noncompliance with some legal requirements that the
persons interested shall also be entitled to a particular
amount of damages to be awarded as a lump sum or
calculated at a certain percentage of compensation
payable. There are many ways of affording appropriate
relief and redressing a wrong; quashing the acquisition
proceedings is not the only mode to redress. To wit, it is
ultimately a matter of balancing the competing interests.
Beyond this, it is neither possible nor advisable to say.
We hope and trust that these considerations will be duly
borne in mind by the courts while dealing with
challenges to acquisition proceedings.”
In the instant case, public interest requires intervention by this
342

WP(C) No.10685/2004

court.
392.

It is well settled that a writ shall not be issued where writ

jurisdiction has been invoked to secure a dishonest advantage or to
perpetuate an unjust gain (Re: (1984) 4 SCC 371 M.P. Mittal v. State of
Haryana).
393.

In (2004) 2 SCC 150 Union of India Vs. SB Vohra (para 28 &

30), the Apex Court noticed that the broad principles of judicial review into
administrative actions as were stated by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil
Services Unions vs. Minister for the Civil Services 1984(3) All ER 935
being legality, irrationality and procedural impropriety have greatly been
over taken by other developments generally as, for example, not only in
relation to proper and human rights but also in the direction of principles of
legal certainty notably legitimate expectations.
Thus the parameters, scope and efficiency of judicial review,
which has roots long back as a highly complex and constantly developing
subject, has expanded from case to case. It is settled law that courts in
exercise of its powers in judicial review would zealously guard human
rights, fundamental rights and the citizens rights of life and liberty as also
many non-statutory powers of governmental bodies as regard their control
over property and assets of various kinds which can be extended to other
hostile rights and the like or overseas aid or compensating victims of crime.
The power of judicial review has been circumscribed by the
restraint which courts would exercise in ensuring that they do not step

343

WP(C) No.10685/2004

outside the area of their institutional competence.
394.

So far as the decision in AIR 1968 SCC 1232 MCD vs. Birla

Cotton, Spinning and Weaving Mills (supra) relied upon on behalf of
Sulabh is concerned, the Apex Court was examining the constitutionality of
Section 150 of the DMC Act 1957. It was held that by Section 150 of the
DMC Act, the power was conferred on the MCD to levy any of the optional
taxes by prescribing the maximum rights of tax to be levied and to fix class
of persons and description of articles/properties to be taxed etc. It was held
that such power was not unguided and could not be said to amount to
excessive delegation. The legislative policy was found to be provided with
sufficient safeguards and controls and that therefore the courts should not
interfere.
395.

In the instant case there is no such challenge and the issues

which were raised before the Apex Court do not arise for consideration
before this court.

It was only observed by the Court that in order to

discharge its obligatory functions the MCD had the legal competence to
raise funds to discharge the same.
396.

I find that in MCD vs. Birla Cotton Spinning & Weaving Mills

(supra), the Apex Court held that in the matter of fixing of rates by the
Corporation, the legislature had made the government the watch dog to
control the actions of the Corporation in the matter of fixing rates and other
instances of taxes as a check to see that reasonable rates are fixed by the
Corporation when it proceeds to impose taxes under Section 150.

344

WP(C) No.10685/2004

The Supreme Court held that finally there is another check on the
power of the Corporation which is inherent in the matter of exercise of
powers by subordinate public representative bodies such as municipal
boards. In such cases if the act of such a body in the exercise of the power
conferred on it by the law is unreasonable, the Courts can hold that such
exercise is void for unreasonableness. It was held that an unreasonable tax
can be considered by the courts but it must clearly be an exorbitant tax
which goes so high as to be extortionate.
In my view, therefore, this judgment also does not further the
proposition urged on behalf of the Sulabh to the effect that a decision such
as the one impugned in these proceedings taken by the MCD would be
totally beyond the pale of judicial review.
In view of this position in law, the judgments in 2004(5) SCC
409; AIR 1992 Allahabad 62: 2000(8) SCC 655; 2003(2) All ER 497 also
do not support any of the contentions urged on behalf of M/s Sulabh
International Social Services Organisation.
397.

It has also been argued on behalf of the MCD that the petitioners

cannot approbate and reprobate at the same time and MCD had a right under
the Contract to terminate the same.
398.

Placing reliance on the principles of Section 62 and 63 of the

Contract Act, it has been urged that the petitioners had no right to approbate
and reprobate at the same time. Having accepted the terms and conditions
of allotment of the CTCs, it was not open for the petitioners to avoid their

345

WP(C) No.10685/2004

liabilities thereunder or assert that the agreements were void for the
purposes of securing some other benefit or advantage. In support of this
submission, reliance has been placed by Mr. Valmiki Mehta, learned senior
counsel on the pronouncement of the Apex Court in AIR 1956 SC 593
Nagubai Ammal v. B. Shama Rao.
399.

From a reading of this pronouncement, it is apparent that what is

prohibited is having elected to take benefit of a transaction, it is not open to
the same party to assert that the same was void in order to secure some other
advantage. In the instant case, the petitioners have contended that they were
the recipients of the allotments by the MCD, but on account of certain
action and deficiencies, the MCD had itself proposed to vary the liabilities
of the petitioners. In this behalf, reliance has been placed on minutes of
certain meetings between the parties and communications of the officers of
the MCD. It is not the petitioner's contention that the contracts between
them were void for any reason.
400.

For the same reason, the pronouncement of the Apex Court in

AIR 1968 SC 956 Ningava v. Virappa Shitappa relied upon by the MCD
would have no application.

In the judgment before the Apex Court a

challenge to a gift deed on the ground that the same was the result of
perpetration of fraud was under consideration. It is well established that a
contract or other transaction induced or tainted by fraud is not void but only
voidable at the option of the party defrauded. It was held that until the
transaction is avoided, it is valid, so that third parties without notice of the

346

WP(C) No.10685/2004

fraud may in the meantime acquire rights and interest in the matter, which
they may enforce against the parties defrauded. There is no such contention
in the instant case on behalf of the petitioners.
401.

In (1981) 1 SCC 537 M/s New Bihar Bidi Leaves Company &

Ors. v. State of Bihar & Ors., a challenge was laid to the constitutional
validity of certain rules framed by the State of Bihar under the Bihar Kendu
Leaves(Control of Trade) Act, 1973; clause 13 and clause 4(bb) of the
tender notice and of the statutory agreement notified by the Bihar
Government in the Bihar Government Gazzette and also the notices of
demand issued under the impugned provisions demanding royalty from the
petitioners in respect of the undelivered quantity of Kendu leaves.
At the time of inviting tenders in the prescribed form inviting
purchasers to bid at the public auction, all tenderers or bidders are treated
equally when they offered their rates or bids subject to statutory conditions
including the impugned provision. It was not possible to classify purchases
as was being contended by the petitioners between those whose offer/bids
has been accepted into 'honest' purchasers or 'dishonest' purchasers. It was
secondly held that if a person with his eyes open tenders and gives the
highest bid at a public auction, of his own accord, it will be assumed that it
is so because in his own estimation, the acceptance of the contract at those
rates and subject to the notified terms and conditions, would afford him a
reasonable scope for making profit.
It was lastly held that it is the fundamental principle of general

347

WP(C) No.10685/2004

application that if a person of his own accord, accepted a contract on certain
terms and works out the contract, he cannot be allowed to adhere to and
abide by some of the terms of the contract which prove advantageous to
him and repudiate the other terms of the same contract which might be
disadvantageous to him. The court applied the maxim qui approbat non
reprobat i.e. to say that one who approbates, cannot reprobate.
Applying this principle, the court noticed that when the
petitioners who had all offered highest bids by participation in the public
auctions or by tenders, had accepted and worked out the contracts in the
past but who were now resisting the demands or other actions arising out of
impugned condition contained in clause 13 on the ground that the same was
violative of Article 19 (1) g and Article 14.
402.

The respondents have also placed reliance on the pronouncement

of the Apex Court in (1976) 2 SCC 416 Bhagat Ram Batra v. Union of
India & Ors. In this case, the petitioner who was the auction purchaser
repudiated the action on the ground that the area of the property was less
than that represented at the time of the sale. At his instance, the respondents
cancelled the auction sale in his favour. Subsequently, realising that the
value of the property had appreciated and he should not have asked for
cancellation of the sale in his favour, the appellant made an offer that he
was prepared to accept the property in dispute if rehabilitation authorities
allow proportionate reduction in the price offered by him on account of the
fact that the area of the property had been found to be less than what had

348

WP(C) No.10685/2004

been represented at the time of the auction sale. By this time, the property
had been resold and fetched a price of Rs.10,1000/- against the price of
Rs.72,700/- offered by the appellant. It was in these facts, that the Apex
Court held that it was open to the state to refuse to accept the conditional
offer and cancel the sale and order resale.
The Apex Court has thus noticed that as per this maxim a party
to an instrument or transaction cannot take advantage of one part of the
document or transaction and reject the rest i.e. to say no party can accept
and reject the same instrument or transaction. In this case, the Apex Court
also noticed that a person cannot be debarred from enforcing his
fundamental rights on the grounds of estoppel or waiver.
No principles of law has been laid down in this pronouncement
and the same are clearly distinguishable from the facts of the instant case. It
has been pointed out by Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned senior for the
petitioners that the petitioners could not and did not give up or abandon the
contracts on account of the MCD's representation that the defects in the
toilets would be repaired and removed.
403.

It is to be noticed that in the present case, the petitioners are not

contending that any term in the transaction is void. They are also not
seeking to avoid the contract. On the contrary, their contention is that the
MCD had agreed to relieve them of certain obligations which they had
undertaken under the agreement on account of certain ground realities and
existing facts. In my view, for this reason, the principle laid down by the

349

WP(C) No.10685/2004

Apex Court in these cases would have no application to the facts and
circumstances of the present case which have been detailed at length above.
The petitioners have also not contended that any of the condition of the
agreement are violative of Article 19(1)g or Article 14 of the Constitution of
India. There is no challenge to the terms and conditions of either the
auction or the licence agreement.
404.

In (1994) 4 SCC 104 Assistant Excise Commissioner & Ors. v

ISSAC Peter & Ors., the court was concerned with the attempt of the
contractors to wriggle out of contractual obligations on pleas of promissory
estoppel and based on the rule of legitimate expectation with regard to
possible profits which they could make. In these circumstances, the court
had observed thus :“21.
There is yet another reason which militates
against the licencees herein. Even according to them
there was scarcity of arrack during the months of
February and March 1981, i.e., towards the end of the
previous excise year. It is also their case that auctions
had to be postponed repeatedly half the shops in the
State could not be sold during that excise year for the
very same reason. It is equally clear that the intending
bidders were not prepared to implicitly believe the
statement of the Minister for Excise made on March
19, which is evident from the fact that no bidders were
present on the adjourned date of auction, viz., March
26, 1981. We do not know what circumstances
weighed with the respondent in offering his bids on
the third date of auction March 27, 1981. The
respondent attributes it to the assurance held out by
the auctioning authorities. If he was not prepared to
act upon the statement of the Minister for Excise, it is
rather curious that he claims to have believed and
acted upon the alleged assurance of the auctioning
authorities. Having regard to the number of shops and
the amounts of bids offered by the respondent, we
350

WP(C) No.10685/2004

would be justified in presuming that the respondent
was an experienced businessman. It is unlikely that he
– or for that matter, other licencees – believed
implicitly the alleged assurance of the Excise Officers.
As experienced businessmen they must have
anticipated that there would be problems in supply
since things cannot be rectified overnight. In any
event, the only assurance was that the authorities
would take steps to ensure additional supplies as in
the previous year. It cannot be understood as a firm
promise - assuming for the sake of argument that they
were competent to hold out such promise (which we
have found,t hey were not competent to). As a matter
of fact, they did whatever they could. Whatever they
could supply, they did supply. It is not a case where
any essential term of contract was kept back or kept
undisclosed. The Government had placed all their
bids with their eyes open in the above circumstances
they cannot blame anyone else for the loss, if any,
sustained by them, nor are they entitled to say that
licence fee should be reduced proportionate to the
actual supplies made. Question may arise,
proportionate to what? Proportionate to their demand,
proportionate to previous year's supply or
proportionate to the average of previous three years'
supplies?
22.
xxx
23.
Maybe these are cases where the licencees
took a calculated risk. Maybe they were not wise in
offering their bids. But in law there is no basis upon
which they can be relieved of the obligations
undertaken by them under the contract. It is well
known that in such contracts - which may be called
executory contracts - there is always an element of
risk. Many an unexpected development may occur
which may either cause loss to the contractor or result
in large profit. Take the very case of arrack
contractors. In one year, there may be abundance of
supplies accompanied by good crops induced by
favourable weather conditions; the contractor will
make substantial profits during the year. In another
year, the conditions may be unfavourable and supplies
scarce. He may incur loss. Such contracts do not
imply a warranty – or a guarantee - of profit to the
contractor. It is a business for him – profit and loss
being normal incidents of a business. There is no
351

WP(C) No.10685/2004

room for invoking the doctrine of unjust enrichment in
such a situation. The said doctrine has never been
invoked in such business transactions. the remedy
provided by Article 226, or for that matter, suits,
cannot be resorted to wriggle out of the contractual
obligations entered into by the licencees.”
Again this pronouncement has no application to the present case.
The petitioners before this court have merely placed reliance on the
acceptance on the part of the respondents to the effect that there were CTCs
which were not functional for reasons which were not attributable to the
NGOs. The officers of the MCD had also accepted this position and had
stated that the same dues which were payable by the NGOs would be
postponed. It is this issue which has to be considered by this court. The
present case is thus clearly distinguishable from Isac Peter's case.
405.

Mr. Valmiki Mehta, learned senior counsel representing the

MCD has urged vehemently that the petitioners had no rights to unilaterally
alter their obligations under the contract. In this behalf, reliance has been
placed on (2004) 1 SCC 12 City Bank NA v. Standard Chartered Bank &
Ors. to urge that novation, decision and alteration of contract can be done
only with the agreement of both parties and not unilaternally under Section
62 of the Indian Contract Act. Both parties have to agree to substitute the
original contract with a contract or resent or alter the same. It was urged
that however, under Section 63, unlike Section 62, a promisee can
unilaterally and may
(i)

dispense with wholly or in part or

(ii)

remit wholly or in part,

352

WP(C) No.10685/2004

(iii)

the performance of the promise made to him or

(iv)

may extend the time for said performance or

(v)

may accept instead of it in satisfaction which he thinks fit.
Again this submission has to be tested in the light of the

contention of the petitioners who have contended that the admitted position
was that the large number of CTCs were not functional and it was not the
petitioners who were responsible for novation or recessation or alteration of
the contract but it was the representation of the respondent themselves.
406.

So far as the pronouncement of Asia Foundation and Contract

Limited v Trafalgar House Construction Limited & Ors., 1997 1 SCC 738
is concerned, the Apex Court was examining the permissible limits of
interference by a court of law in a matter relating to award of contract. In
this context, recognising the well established parameters of judicial review,
in matters relating to grant of contracts, the court held thus :“9.
The Asian Development Bank came into
existence under an Act called the Asian
Development Act, 1966, in pursuance of an
international agreement to which India was a
signatory. This new financial institution was
established for accelerating the economic
development of Asia and the Far East. Under the
Act the Bank and its officers have been granted
certain immunities, exemption and privileges. It is
well known that it is difficult for the country to go
ahead with such high cost projects unless the
financial institutions like the World Bank or the
Asian Development Bank grant loan or subsidy, as
the case may be. When such financial institutions
grant such huge loans they always insist that any
project for which loan has been sanctioned must be
carried out in accordance with the specification and
within the scheduled time and the procedure for
353

WP(C) No.10685/2004

granting the award must be duly adhered to. In the
aforesaid premises on getting the evaluation bids of
the appellant and Respondent 1 together with the
consultant's opinion after the so-called corrections
made the conclusion of the Bank to the effect “the
lowest evaluated substantially responsive bidder is
consequently AFCONS” cannot be said to be either
arbitrary or capricious or illegal requiring Court's
interference in the matter of an award of contract.
There was some dispute between the Bank on one
hand and the consultant who was called upon to
evaluate on the other on the question whether there
is any power of making any correction tot he bid
documents after a specified period. The High Court
in construing certain clauses of the bid documents
has come to the conclusion that such a correction
was permissible and, therefore, the Bank could not
have insisted upon granting the contract in favour
of the appellant. We are of the considered opinion
that it was not within the permissible limits of
interference for a court of law, particularly when
there has been no allegation of malice or ulterior
motive and particularly when the court has not
found any mala fides or favouritism in the grant of
contract in favour of the appellant. In Tata
Cellular v. Union of India this Court has held that :
“The duty of the court is to confine itself
to the question of legality. Its concern should be :
1.
Whether a decision-making
authority exceeded its powers,
2.
committed an error of law,
3.
committed a breach of the
rules of natural justice,
4.
reached a decision which no
reasonable tribunal would have reached or,
5.
abused its powers.
Therefore, it is not for the Court to
determine whether a particular policy or particular
decision taken in the fulfilment of that policy is
fair. It is only concerned with the manner in which
those decisions have been taken. the extent of the
duty to act fairly will vary from case to case.
Shortly put, the grounds upon which an
administrative action is subject to control by
judicial review can be classified as under :
(i)
Illegality: This means the
354

WP(C) No.10685/2004

407.

decision-maker must understand correctly the law
that regulates his decision-making power and must
give effect to it;
(ii)
Irrationality,
namely,
Wednesbury unreasonableness.
(iii)
Procedural impropriety.
The above are only the broad grounds
but it does not rule out addition of further grounds
in course of time.”
It is these well established principles which were to be applied to

be facts of the instant case which I am required to examine.
408.

The respondents have also placed strong reliance on the

pronouncement of the Apex Court in (2003) 12 SCC 91 Ganga Retreat
Limited v. State of Rajasthan & Ors. to submit that the petitioners were
wrong in urging that there were misrepresentations on the part of the
respondent with regard to the possession of the CTCc. It has been urged
that assuming, without admitting, that there was any misrepresentation, the
petitioners had the option to either rescind the contract or seek restitution or
to form the contract without prejudice to their right to seek damages by way
of restitution for loss caused by the alleged misrepresentation.

The

petitioners conduct in proceeding to take over possession of the CTCs
amounts to affirmation of the contract which clearly evidences the fact that
the petitioners did not rescind the contract nor reserved their right to seek
restitution by award of damages or seek restitution.

Rather they affirmed

the contract and went ahead with it. Even at the time of initiating the legal
proceedings in this court, it was still open to the petitioners to either affirm
the contract without prejudice to their right to seek damages by way of
restitution for the loss caused by the alleged misrepresentation or to rescind
355

WP(C) No.10685/2004

the contract by getting a declaration that the contract was not binding on the
petitioners. In this behalf, the respondents have placed reliance on the
following observations of the Apex Court in Ganga Retreat & Towers
Limited (supra) :“24.
It was then contended on behalf of the
appellants that in the conveyance deed the FAR was
again mentioned as 2.0 at that stage there was a clear
misrepresentation by the respondent. To establish
misrepresentation on this count reliance was placed
on the provisions of the Indian Contract Act. There
is no force in this submission. Statement about the
existing state of the law innocently made cannot
constitute misrepresentation if it is later found that
the statement was erroneous.
This would be
particularly so where the other party to whom the
statement is made is aware of or has the ability to
conveniently apprise itself of the correct state of the
facts and the law applicable. Assuming (but without
holding) that there was some misrepresentation, the
appellants had a couple of remedies i.e. to either
rescind the contract or seek restitution or to affirm the
contract without prejudice to their right to seek
damages by way of restitution for the loss caused by
the misrepresentation.
It is apparent that the
appellants did not rescind the contract or seek
restitution by way of damages. Instead, they affirmed
the contract which is clear from the fact that they
immediately commenced construction on the land
even though the building plans were on FAR 1.75.
Affirmation of the contract and proceeding with the
construction clearly indicates that the appellants did
not rescind the contract nor reserved their right to
seek restitution by award of damages; or seek
restitution, rather they affirmed the contract and went
ahead with it.
25.
It was then argued that the appellants had
to start construction immediately as a very strict
stipulation was contained in the auction notice
(Condition 9). It was also represented in the sale
deed that construction work on the plot should be
commenced within one year from the date of handing

409.

over of the possession of the land and the
construction of building should be completed within
three years. The extension beyond three years was to
be given subject to payment of a penalty of
Rs.20,000/- per month but in no case the period
would be extended beyond two years. Clause 13 of
the terms of the auction also provided that any
violation of any terms and conditions would lead to
forfeiture of purchase of right of the property and the
property would stand reverted to the Government
without paying any compensation for the property.
Because of the condition contained in clauses 9 and
13 of the terms of auction, the appellants in spite of
having knocked the doors of the court had to start
with the construction otherwise they ran the risk of
their right to the property being forfeited. We do not
find any merit in this submission. At the time of
initiating the legal proceedings in the court, it was
open to the appellants to either affirm the contract
without prejudice to their right seeking damages by
way of restitution for loss caused by alleged
misrepresentation or to rescind the contract by getting
the declaration that the contract was not binding on
the appellants. The appellants elected the first
option. Had the appellants rescinded the contract and
prayed for declaration that the contract was not
binding on them, then, on its being so declared,
Terms 9 and 13 of the auction notice would not have
bound the appellants in any way. The court while
granting the relief could have moulded the relief
according tot he facts and situation prevalent. It
would not have in any way affected the appellants.
The appellants cannot be permitted to sit on the fence
in indecision and take a chance. By putting up the
construction of basement and the other floors above
the appellants have encumbered the property. The
respondent cannot be fastened with the liability to
pay for the construction put up by the appellants with
full knowledge of true facts.”
In the light of these submissions, on behalf of the MCD, Mr.

Jayant Bhushan, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners has
stated that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi is a statutory authority and
that there is an obligation on it to act reasonably and fairly in all its actions.
357

WP(C) No.10685/2004

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi fairly and honestly, accepted the faults
in the CTCs and the default on the part of the construction agencies. In fact
senior officers of the MCD called upon the executive engineers who
admitted the faults in the CTCs and said the same would be got rectified
from the private contractor and that the petitioners would be required to
make payments from the date of the rectification.

It has been also

vehemently urged that none of the petitioners were considered defaulter till
after the MCD decided to hand over all the CTCs to Sulabh International.
The admitted position is that the petitioners took over the CTCs with
deficiencies in the civil construction as well as default on the part of the
electrical constructions and deficiencies in the electrical work.
410.

In fact, it has been pointed out that the writ petitioner in W.P.(C)

8517/2005 namely M/s Arya Gram Udyog Vikas Samiti v. MCD in fact
wrote to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to take the CTCs back. In this
behalf, this petitioner had addressed a letter dated 6 th August, 2003 and
other communications. The petitioners have contended that let alone take
any action on the repeated requests of the petitioner which was made in the
light of the deficiencies in the CTCs, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi till
date has not bothered to even sent a reply to these communications of the
petitioners.
On the contrary, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi after having
taken the decision to arbitrarily and illegally hand over the CTCs to Sulabh
International, addressed demand letter dated 1st April, 2005 and 8th April,

358

WP(C) No.10685/2004

2005 raising demands towards the licence fees.
In this background, the petitioner has certainly urged a relevant
question as to how it could possibly be termed as a 'defaulter' when the
MCD had itself failed to take back the possession of the CTCs despite a
communication made as back as on 6th August, 2003 to it.
411.

The petitioners have placed reliance also on the pronouncement

of a single Bench of this court in 103 (2003) DLT 776 Manju Gupta &
Anr. v. The Delhi Development Authority.

In this case, the Delhi

Development Authority had conducted the auction of shops and offices on
'as is where is basis'. The respondent took more than three months to
confirm the exact area of the shop for which they had successfully bid
despite repeated letters to the DDA informing it that on inspection at the
site, the area of the stall in question was comparatively much less than the
area scheduled for the auction. The respondents contended that it was the
duty of the petitioner to have inspected the premises before participating in
the auction or could have sought clarification at the stage of the auction and
it is not open to the petitioner to thereafter resile from the auction. The
petitioner was not willing to accept such shop and sought refund of the
amount deposited. The respondent DDA however cancelled the allotment
and forfeited the earnest money resulting in ultimately the petitioner filing a
writ petition seeking a direction to the DDA to refund the earnest money
deposited by him alongwith interest. In this regard, this court held thus :“12.
There is no doubt that as per the general
terms and conditions the shops and stalls were
359

WP(C) No.10685/2004

auctioned on as is where is basis and it was stipulated
that the petitioner shall be presumed to have inspected
the shop in question. There was thus an obligation on
the part of the petitioner to verify the position of the
shop before participating in the bid. However, there is
simultaneously an obligation on the part of the
respondent to have given the correct description in
question. Thus if there is some minor defect in the shop
the auction purchaser should not wriggle out of the
auction on the said ground since he is presumed to have
inspected the shop in question. However, the area of
the shop in question is certainly an aspect which cannot
fall within the said category. An auction purchaser
must know correctly the space sought to be auctioned.
The details given by the respondent will be presumed to
be correct. Thus it is not permissible for the respondent
to contend that even if there is such a large difference in
area the respondent is not concerned with the sames.
The respondent is a public body and must act in a fair
and reasonable manner. Thus form the basis of the
judgment in Anis-ur-Reluna and Anr. v. DDA(supra).
In the case of Vardhman Properties Limited (supra), the
auction purchaser had not only paid the bid amount but
also deposited the balance amount and it is two ;months
later that the issues dof the areas was raised. It was in
these circumstances that the observations were made by
the learned Single Judge of this Court that the auction
purchaser should have verified the correct facts at site
specially when the bid is on as is where is basis. The
petitioner in the present case immediately after the
successful bid inspected the shop and even addressed a
letter to the respondent to confirm the exact area of the
shop. It took more than three months for the respondent
to respond tot he same and justify the same on ground
of inclusion of 50% of the basement. I am unable to
accept the contention of learned Counsel for the
respondent that there is no obligation on the part of the
respondent in this behalf and that such details which are
given in certain other auctions would have no material
bearing. It is relevant to note that one of the auctions
held on 9.8.1996 which is prior to the auction in
question while the other auction dated 13.2.1999 which
is subsequent to the said auction, details have been
given wherever the basement has been included or
terrace has been so included. Thus it is necessary to
give correct description before an auction takes place.
13.
The auction purchaser must know what is
360

WP(C) No.10685/2004

sought to be auctioned. The expression “as is where is”
cannot be extended to include even large discrepancies
area which is sought to be made good by inclusion of
the basement area. It was obligatory on the part of the
respondent to have specified that the area includes the
basement area.”
In the light of these findings, the court held that the forfeiture of the
earnest money of the petitioner could not be sustained and the same was
quashed. The Delhi Development Authority was required to refund the same
with interest. Based on the principles laid down in this judgment, I find force
in the contention of the petitioners that the respondent MCD was required to
act fairly in the instant case especially in the light of the admitted position that

several of the CTCs were faulty and incapable of being utilised.
412.

It is noteworthy that the MCD had fairly accepted the several

faults which were pointed out by the various NGOs. Even at the time of
awarding the contract to Sulabh, it was noticed that there were several
structural and other defects which required rectification. Electricity and
water connections had not been obtained in several CTCs even at the time
the petitioners contract were rescinded. Not a single instance has been
pointed out where there was a default in payment of the security deposit or
the licence fee for the initial quarter. In the meetings conducted at the level
of the Addl. Commissioner, Slum & JJ, it was agreed that subject to the
approval from the competent authority, the NGOs would be required to pay
the licence fee with effect from the date when the CTCs were rendered
functional. Not a word has been uttered as to what steps were taken for
removal of the defects. Executive Engineers of the MCD admitted the fault

361

WP(C) No.10685/2004

as also the field monitors. It is an admitted position that the NGOs were
handed over possession with several deficiencies in several CTCs.
413.

There is no consideration as to what was the outcome of the

minutes and the recommendations. The petitioners were all informed that
they would be required to pay the licence fees with effect from the date the
CTCs were rendered functional.

No decision to the contrary was

communicated to the petitioner. Undoubtedly, the MCD did not seek to
enforce the licence fee till after it took the decision to rescind the contract
with the petitioners without either a tracing the issue as to the CTCs having
been rendered functional or the date from which the petitioners or the NGOs
would be required to pay the licence fee.
The petitioner was never given an opportunity to return the CTCs
which were non-functional. Each time, the MCD had told the NGOs to pay
from the date when the CTCs became functional and also that the work
would be got done by the Executive Engineers and the contractors. The
petitioner never had the situation where they could have handed back the
CTCs. On the contrary, according to the petitioners, it was indicated to
them that if they made the CTCs functional, they would be reimbursed. In
these circumstances, it is not open to the MCD to contend that there was any
unilateral decision on the part of the NGOs or any novation of the contract.
The petitioners have pointed out the failure of the MCD to abide by their
statutory and public law duty as well as the representation which was
inherent in the very scheme of the award of CTCs that the functional CTCs

362

WP(C) No.10685/2004

would be handed over for operation and maintenance to the NGOs.
414.

Addressing the arguments that all the NGOs were not defaulters,

the petitioners have pointed out that the MCD in the third list which it
handed over in court on 17th August, 2005 has pointed out that even as per
its own records, several NGOs were not defaulters. In this list, the Delhi
Jan Sudhar Samiti has been shown as not being a defaulter.

On the

contrary, there is a credit balance in its favour.
All the petitioners dispute the correctness of the list submitted by
the MCD before this court. However it is contended that even as per the list
submitted by the MCD the decision to hand over the CTCs to Sulabh was
unfair and was not based on any finding that the NGOs were defaulters.
415.

There is an absolute obligation on the state to add reasonably and

fairly. The petitioners were expected to take over CTCs for operation and
maintenance. It is inherent in this function which the petitioner were to
discharge that the CTCs which were handed over to them were in an
operational condition.

Even if the petitioners were required to take

possession on an as is where is basis, the obligation on the state to act
reasonably would not be mitigated by any other consideration.
416.

Mr. Valmiki Mehta, learned senior counsel appearing for the

MCD has urged that the writ sought by the petitioners in the instant case,
amounts to a direction to the MCD to act in violation of the law and cannot
be granted. In this behalf, reliance was placed on 1997 10 SCC 264 Vice
Chancellor, University of Allahabad & Ors. v. Dr. Anant Prakash Mishra

363

WP(C) No.10685/2004

& Ors., wherein the court held that a mandamus cannot be issued to violate
the law or to act in violation of the law.

In this case, the court was

concerned with the recruitment process and selection for the post of readers
in the University of Allahabad. The process of selection to various posts
including the post of readers in the University of Allahabad had been
initiated prior to 12th December, 1993. On 22nd March, 1994, the U.P.
Public Services (Reservation of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and
Backward Classes) Act, 1994, came into force with effect from 11th
December, 1993. On the basis of the implementation of the provisions of
this Act, a fresh advertisement was issued for the appointment of two
readers in Chemistry, in
February, 1995.

The action of the Vice Chancellor in directing the

selection process in compliance with the new statute was challenged. It was
thus held that the statutory provisions having come into force, the University
was bound to comply with the statutory mandate. In this background, the
Apex Court had observed that a mandamus cannot be issued to violate the law
or to act in violation of the law.
No such issue or question has been raised or arises in the instant
case.
417.

To the same effect are the observations of the Apex Court in 2004

IV FLT 542 = AIR 2004 SC 2336 Textile Labour Association & Anr. v. OL
& Anr. also relied upon by the respondents. In this case, the Apex Court had
observed that the Supreme Court in exercise of its powers under Article 142,

364

WP(C) No.10685/2004

cannot ignore any substantive statutory provision dealing with the subject and
that it was only exercising a residuary power, which was supplementary and
complementary to the powers specifically conferred on the Apex Court by
statutes, exercisable to do complete justice between the parties wherever it is
just and equitable to do so. The power under Article 142 was intended to
prevent any obstruction in the stream of justice.

The order of the court, in

respect of which review was sought, was required to be read as though having
been made pursuant to exercise of powers under Article 142 of the
Constitution, till the same would have to be read in the light of the law laid
down by the Apex Court in the Supreme Court Board Association v Union of
India & Anr.
There is nothing in the instant case which can support the
submission that this Court is being required to issue a writ which is in violation
of a statutory provision or any principle of law.
418.

Again in 1995 (Supp. 1) SCC 304 Dental Council of India v.

Harpreet Kaur & Ors., the Apex Court was considering a challenge to an
order by the High Court directing the University to hold the first professional
examination for students of an unvalidated and unrecognised dental college at
the risk of such students. The Apex Court had held that such relief was not
permissible in law and was not based on any legally recognised principles.
Consequently, the Apex Court held that it would be preposterous to direct the
University to hold examinations for the benefit of such students and that the
order was unjustified.
Again, no such direction is being sought or being given in the
365

WP(C) No.10685/2004

instant case. While the dicta of the Apex Court is binding on this court,
however the pronouncement has to be read and applied in the facts of the
instant case.
419.

Again in AIR 2000 Delhi 450 Rajasthan Breweries Limited v.

Stroh Breweries Company, the Division Bench of this court was concerned
with an appeal filed against an order passed by the learned Single Judge on an
application under Section 9 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
seeking an ad-interim temporary injunction in the nature of stay of the two
notices of termination issued by the respondent terminating a technical
knowhow agreement as well as technical assistance agreement executed
between the parties.

The court placed reliance on the well settled legal

principle that no injunction can be granted of which could not be specifically
enforced. The court relied on the specific statutory provisions of Section 16 (c)
read with Section 41 (e) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 in this behalf.

This

judgment has no application to the issues raised before this court.
420.

Utilising the shield of the laudatory Yamuna Action Plan,

imperative for the cause of not only the users of the community toilets, but
for the restoration of glory of the river Yamuna, the lifeline of the
community and the city, the MCD launched an ambitious proposal.
Unfortunately, it has got embroiled in legal wrangles. The blame for the
travails squarely lies on its officials who have really failed to perform their
statutory duty and public law obligations. Defective construction has been
permitted to come up on which crores of rupees including international
funding was expended. This was not possible if those engineers in the field
366

WP(C) No.10685/2004

discharged their duties in right earnest. Perhaps they could have been
motivated if their superiors were persuaded to leave the confines of their
narrow offices to perform their public duty in its truest sense to conduct
field visits; routine and surprise checks. Only then the city would have got
959 functional CTCs. Several decisions of the MCD discussed herein have
dealt with publicity activity essential to inculcate the hygienic toilet habit in
the populace. I do not find even the semblance of effort on the part of any
official of the MCD to have touched on this aspect. It is agonising to note
decision making steeped in file pushing, adhocism and sheer impressions
despite the importance of the issues involved. Thus, it is not attitudes of the
public alone which need to change. Certainly the approach to a public duty
requires a greater commitment from those who are required to perform it.
421.

Before parting with the case, from the foregoing, it would be

permissible for the MCD to identify a single party for allocation of the
CTCs.

In this behalf, the words of the Apex Court in Raunaq

International (supra) which are relevant read thus:“16.
It is also necessary to remember that price may
not always be the sole criterion for awarding a contract.
Often when an evaluation committee of experts is appointed
to evaluate offers, the expert committee's special knowledge
plays a decisive role in deciding which is the best offer.
Price offered is only one of the criteria. The past record of
the tenderers, the quality of the goods or services which are
offered, assessing such quality on the basis of the past
performance of the tenderers, its market reputation and so
on, all play an important role in deciding to whom the
contract should be awarded. At times, a higher price for a
much better quality of work can be legitimately paid in
order to secure proper performance of the contract and good
quality of work – which is as much in public interest as a
367

WP(C) No.10685/2004

low price. The court should not substitute its own decision
for the decision of an expert evaluation committee.”
However, the same must be for good reasons in public interest

and upon consideration of the relevant material which must be borne out
from its records.

Irrelevant considerations required to be eschewed.

Unfortunately the decisions were first taken and then steps taken to look for
reasons to justify them.
The petitioners were admittedly clamouring and competing with
the advocated interests of Sulabh. Even at the time of taking of the
impugned decisions, the matter was already before this court. Undoubtedly,
the respondent MCD failed to abide by the legislative mandate. Its action
was certainly not backed by rationality, public interest, general good or
social betterment and cannot withstand judicial scrutiny even as per the
legislative standards and the weight of judicial authority noticed
hereinabove.

The decisions have to be held to be unreasonable and

arbitrarory and not based on relevant material, hence the decisions are
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.

Certainly no nexus or

connection can be drawn between the decision taken, the reasons put forth
for the same and the purpose for which the MCD has exercised the power.
The NGOs to say the least were entitled to the notice, if not as per Clause
15.5, then in compliance with the principles of natural justice.
For all the foregoing reasons, the writ petitions are allowed.
422.

Some of the writ petitioners have assailed the monetary demands

made by the MCD against them. Certainly, the petitioners have a legal right

368

WP(C) No.10685/2004

to contest the imposition and demands.

However, in the light of the

foregoing discussion, it is not possible to adjudicate upon the same in the
present proceedings for the scanty material which has been placed before
this court by the MCD and the stand taken that it is not possessed of the
complete records relating to payments by the petitioners.
It is noteworthy that so far as the allotment of the petitioners
were concerned, some allotments lapsed during the pendency of the writ
petition and the MCD even took possession of several CTCs on the ground
that the contract period was over.
423.

From the present cases, it appears that as the MCD was

proceeding to implement the impugned decisions and applications were
filed by the petitioner seeking interim stay, CM 7737/2005 was filed by
Bhagwati Foundation in WP(C) 10685/2004. When it came up for hearing
before the Vacation Bench on 22nd day of June, 2005 the following order
was recorded:“It is not in dispute that the contractual period
under which the petitioner was operating has expired in
June, 2005. Mr.P.N. Lekhi, learned Senior Advocate on
instructions from Mr.Anurag Dubey states that Sulabh
International is being handed over CTCs with an expressed
stipulation that the arrangement between the MCD and
Sulabh International would be subject to orders in the writ
petition.
Mr.Valmiki Mehta, learned Senior Advocate
appearing for MCD on instructions from Mr.Amit Paul,
Advocate and Mr.O.P.Verma, Superintending Engineer,
Slum & JJ Department, MCD states that before possession
is resumed on the completion of the contract period,
inventory of the fittings and fixtures installed at the CTCs
would be prepared.
List the CM before the regular Bench on 8th
369

WP(C) No.10685/2004

July, 2005.”

424.

Thereafter Bhagwati Foundation filed CM No.8533/2005 for

similar reliefs. This application was listed on 19th July, 2005 when it was
dismissed. This Court had observed thus :
“

xxx

xxx

xxx

19.
It is settled law that no interim relief can be granted
which is beyond the main writ petition. In the instant case,
admittedly by way of the present application, the petitioners are
seeking relief with regard to action which has been taken by the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi on 14 th June, 2005
which is a cause which has arisen subsequent to the filing of the
writ petition and does not form part of the writ petition.
20.
There is yet another aspect of the matter. Perusal of
CM 7493/2004 shows that in para 4 of the application,the
petitioner itself had contended that most of the community toilet
complexes are lying closed due to the fault of the respondents.
There can be possibly no dispute to the fact that these community
toilet complexes are intended for user by the lower income group
who do not have the benefit of individual toilet facilities.
21.
The contract with the petitioners has come to an end.
The petitioner admittedly has no legal right to retain charge over
the toilets. It is an admitted position that most of the community
toilet complexes are lying closed. Prohibitory interim injunction
orders are based in equity. In the instant case, there is no
individual interest as the petitioner's have no legal right which is
being sought to be enforced or violated. Judicial notice can be
taken of the implication of non-availability of such toilet
complexes which would add not only to the woes of the users for
whom they are intended but also aggravates the problems of the
community and the city. Untreated sullage flowing into public
drains and defaecation in open add to public health problems,
especially in the current season.
22.
In any case, I find that M/s SISSO is being permitted to
operate and maintain the toilet complexes subject to orders which
shall be passed in the writ petition. The same therefore is in the
nature of an interim arrangement pending orders in the writ
petition. Having regard to the nature of the utility which is
imperatively required to be operated and made available for daily
use by the public at large, public interest demands an interim
370

WP(C) No.10685/2004

arrangement for such purpose be made in order to ensure
continuity of the service and hygiene of not only individuals but of
the community and the city.
26.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has objected to the
manner in which the respondents are taking over the community
toilet complexes. It is being stated that no inventories are being
prepared. He submits that his client would be willing to join in the
preparation of the inventory so that the correct facts are brought on
record and that the rights of the petitioner so far as its installations
are concerned, are not prejudiced.
xxx

xxx

xxx

In this view of the matter, it is directed that the
respondent MCD shall give a spot notice to representative of
the petitioner who shall accept the same and join in the inventory
of the fittings and fixtures which shall be prepared before
possession is resumed.”
425.
In view of the foregoing discussion, the writ petitions are

allowed. I hold that the impugned orders dated 3rd January, 2004, 30th April,
2004, 21st June, 2004, proposal contained in letter dated 19th July, 2004 and
the Resolution dated 25th October, 2004 of the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi making allotment of all the Community Toilet Complexes to Sulabh
International Social Service Organisation are arbitrary, unreasonable,
illegal, void and without jurisdiction. The same are, consequently, hereby
quashed.
426.

In view of the foregoing and in order to prevent any

inconvenience to the public at large, it is directed that further action for
allotment of Community Toilet Complexes in accordance with law as per
the principles noticed hereinabove, shall be taken and effectuated within
two months. The MCD may continue with the current arrangement for
operation and maintenance of such toilet complexes possession whereof
371

WP(C) No.10685/2004

stands handed over to Sulabh pursuant to the decision dated 25 th October,
2004 of the MCD for a period of two months.
427.

It is made clear that these directions shall not effect the

agreements which were entered into by MCD with Sulabh International
Social Organisation prior to the decisions impugned in these writ petitions.
428.

It is directed that MCD shall remain bound by the statements

made in court on 9th March, 2005 in WP (C) No.16106/2004 & WP (C)
No.16108/2004.
429.

In the foregoing circumstances, it is also directed that the

impugned communications whereby the MCD has raised monetary demands
upon the petitioners, shall be treated as a notice to the petitioners to show
cause against the notice demand.
The petitioners shall be at liberty to place such material which is
in its power and possession including the reasons as to why it is not liable to
pay the amounts claimed in the impugned letters of demand within six
weeks. In case hearing is sought by the petitioners, the same shall be
granted after reasonable notice. The replies shall be considered by the
MCD and a reasoned decision thereon be taken and communicated to the
writ petitioners.
The petitioners shall be at liberty to take action in accordance
with law in respect thereof.
The writ petitions are allowed in the above terms.
There shall be no order as to costs.
