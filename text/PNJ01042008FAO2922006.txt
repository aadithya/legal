PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

The question which I am called upon to answer, for the

FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.1 of 31

moment, in the instant appeals is :- 'Whether the appeals are
maintainable and if yes, whether the same require to be
transmitted to the Appellate Board established under Section
83 of the T.M. Act, 1999?'
2.

The question of law afore-noted has arisen due to the

amendments incorporated in the Patents Act, 1970 by the
Patents Amendment Act, 2002 notified on 25th June, 2002 but
various

provisions

thereof

brought

into

force

firstly

on

20.5.2003 and the remaining by and under a notification
issued in the year 2007 as also the further amendment to the
Patents Act, 1970 by the Patents Amendment Act, 2005, again
bringing into effect the provisions of the said Amendment Act
on 2 different dates.
3.

As I would be referring to the date with effect wherefrom

the provisions of the Amendment Act, 2002 and 2005 were
brought into effect, I would be noting the amended provisions
as in force with effect from the notified dates and their impact.
Thereafter, I propose to consider the rival submissions.
4.

At the outset it may be noted that the appeals were filed

on 17.10.2006.
5.

Proceedings commenced before the Controller of Patents

in the year 2000 when the respondent sought a patent of a
device which was opposed to by the appellant in the year
FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.2 of 31

2000.

By then, the Patents Amendment Act, 1999 had

amended the Patents Act, 1970 with effect from 26.3.1999.
Section 25 of the Patents Act, 1970 as existing in the statute
book as of the year 2000 (i.e. after promulgation of the Patents
Amendment Act, 1999) dealt with opposition to a patent.
Appeals against decisions passed by the Controller of Patents
pertaining to oppositions under Section 25 were maintainable
before the High Court under Sub-Section 2 of Section 116 of
the Act.
6.

The 2 provisions i.e. Section 25 and Section 116 as

existing in the statute book and operative in the year 2000
read as under :Section 25. Opposition to grant of patent:
(1) At any time within four months from the
date of advertisement of the acceptance of a
complete specification under this Act (or
within such further period not exceeding one
month in the aggregate as the Controller may
allow on application made to him in the
prescribed manner before the expiry of the
four months aforesaid) any person interested
may give notice to the Controller of opposition
to the grant of the patent on any of the
following grounds, namely:
a.
that the applicant for the patent or the
person under or through whom he claims,
wrongfully obtained the invention or any part
thereof from him or from a person under or
through whom he claims;
FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.3 of 31

b.
that the invention so far as claimed in
any claim of the complete specification has
been published before the priority date of the
claim –
i.

in
any
specification
filed
in
pursuance of an application for a
patent made in India on or after the
1st day of January, 1912; or

ii.

in India or elsewhere, in any other
document:

Provided that the ground specified in subclause (ii) shall not be available where such
publication does not constitute an anticipation
of the invention by virtue of sub-section (2) or
sub-section (3) of section 29;
that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification is claimed
in a claim of a complete specification
published on or after the priority date of the
applicant’s claim and filed in pursuance of an
application for a patent in India, being a claim
of which the priority date is earlier than that of
the applicant’s claim;
a. that the invention so far as claimed in
any claim of the complete specification
was publicly known or publicly used in
India before the priority date of that
claim.
Explanation – For the purposes of this clause,
an invention relating to a process for which a
patent is claimed shall be deemed to have
been publicly known or publicly used in India
before the priority date of the claim if a
product made by that process had already
been imported into India before that date
except where such importation has been for
the purpose of reasonable trial or experiment
FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.4 of 31

only;
b. that the invention so far as claimed in
any claim of the complete specification is
obvious and clearly does not involve any
inventive step, having regard to the
matter published as mentioned in clause
(b) or having regard to what was used in
India before the priority date of the
applicant’s claim;
c. that the subject of any claim of the
complete specification is not an invention
within the meaning of this Act, or is not
patentable under this Act;
d. that the complete specification does not
sufficiently and clearly describe the
invention or the method by which it is to
be performed;
e. that the applicant has failed to disclose
to the Controller the information required
by section 8 or has furnished the
information which in any material
particular was false to his knowledge;
f. that in the case of a convention
application, the application was not
made within twelve months from the
date of the first application for protection
for the invention made in a convention
country by the applicant or a person
from whom he derives title;
but on no other ground.
(2) Where any such notice of opposition is
duly given, the Controller shall notify the
applicant and shall give to the applicant and
the opponent an opportunity to be heard
before deciding the case.

FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.5 of 31

(3) The grant of a patent shall not be refused
on the ground stated in clause (c) of subsection (1) if no patent has been granted in
pursuance of the application mentioned in that
clause; and for the purpose of any inquiry
under clause (d) or clause (e) of that subsection, no account shall be taken of any
secret use.
Section 116. Appeals
(1) No appeal shall lie from any decision, order or
correction made of issued under this Act by the
Central Government, or from any act or order of the
Controller for the purpose of giving effect to any
such decision, order or direction.
(2) Save as otherwise expressly provided in subsection (1), an appeal shall lie to a High Court from
any decision, order or direction of the Controller
under any of the following provisions, that is to say,
section 15, section 16, section 17, section 18,
section 19, section 20, section 25, section 27,
section 28, section 51, section 54, section 57,
section 60, section 61, section 63, sub-section (3) of
section 69, section 78, section 84, section 86,
section 88 (3), section 89, section 93, section 96 and
section 97.
(3) Every appeal under this section shall be in
writing and shall be made within three months from
the date of the decision, order or direction, as the
case may be, of the Controller, or within such further
time as the High Court may in accordance with the
rules made by it under section 158 allow”.
7.

Suffice would it be to note that as existing in the statute

book as of the year 2000 and in force, vide Section 25 only one
right was granted to a person interested to oppose the grant of
a patent by filing objections at the pre-grant stage. Further,

FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.6 of 31

vide Sub-Section 2 of Section 116 a right of appeal was
available to the aggrieved party against orders passed under
Section 25.

The said appellate remedy was by way of an

appeal to a High Court.
8.

The legislature desired an amendment to the law and

intended to create an appellate forum to hear appeals against
orders passed by the Controller of Patents.

Certain other

amendments were also desired in the law with which I am not
concerned in the instant appeals.

The Patents Amendment

Act, 2002 was promulgated on 25.6.2002.

But, it was not

brought into force immediately. Sub-Section 2 of Section 1 of
the Patents Amendment Act, 2002 reads as under :Section 1. (1)........
(2). It shall come into force on such date as the
Central Government may, by notification in the
Official Gazette, appoint; and different dates may
be appointed for different provisions of this Act and
any reference in any such provision to the
commencement of this Act shall be construed as a
reference to the coming into force of that provision.
9.

It is thus apparent that for a legal affect of any provision

of the Patent Amendment Act, 2002 the relevant date was the
date on which a particular provision thereof came into force.
10.

Relevant for my decision would be to note that vide

Section 18 of the Patent Amendment Act 2002, Section 25 of
the Principal Act was amended by introducing clauses 'j' and 'k'
FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.7 of 31

after existing clause 'i' as also substituting certain words in
Sub-Section 2 and Sub-Section 3 of Section 25.

However,

pertaining to an opposition to an application for grant of a
patent no amendment was incorporated in Section 25; existing
provisions whereof were retained as they were in the statute
book.
11.

Vide Section 47 of the Amendment Act, 2002 entire

Chapter XIX in the existing statute was substituted.

Section

116 and Section 117A were reworded.
12.

The amended Section 25 and Section 116 and 117A (as

per the Amendment Act of 2002) read as under :'Section 25. Opposition to grant of patent:
(1) At any time within four months from the date
of advertisement of the acceptance of a
complete specification under this Act (or within
such further period not exceeding one month in
the aggregate as the Controller may allow on
application made to him in the prescribed
manner before the expiry of the four months
aforesaid) any person interested may give
notice to the Controller of opposition to the
grant of the patent on any of the following
grounds, namely:
a.
that the applicant for the patent or the
person under or through whom he claims,
wrongfully obtained the invention or any part
thereof from him or from a person under or
through whom he claims;

FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.8 of 31

b.
that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification has been
published before the priority date of the claim –
i.
in any specification filed in pursuance of an
application for a patent made in India on or after
the 1st day of January, 1912; or
ii. in India or elsewhere, in any other document:
Provided that the ground specified in sub-clause
(ii) shall not be available where such publication
does not constitute an anticipation of the
invention by virtue of sub-section (2) or subsection (3) of section 29;
c. that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification is
claimed in a claim of a complete
specification published on or after the
priority date of the applicant’s claim and
filed in pursuance of an application for a
patent in India, being a claim of which the
priority date is earlier than that of the
applicant’s claim;
d. that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification was
publicly known or publicly used in India
before the priority date of that claim.
Explanation – For the purposes of this clause, an
invention relating to a process for which a
patent is claimed shall be deemed to have been
publicly known or publicly used in India before
the priority date of the claim if a product made
by that process had already been imported into
India before that date except where such
importation has been for the purpose of
reasonable trial or experiment only;
FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.9 of 31

e. that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification is
obvious and clearly does not involve any
inventive step, having regard to the matter
published as mentioned in clause (b) or
having regard to what was used in India
before the priority date of the applicant’s
claim;
f. that the subject of any claim of the
complete specification is not an invention
within the meaning of this Act, or is not
patentable under this Act;
g. that the complete specification does not
sufficiently and clearly describe the
invention or the method by which it is to
be performed;
h. that the applicant has failed to disclose to
the Controller the information required by
section 8 or has furnished the information
which in any material particular was false
to his knowledge;
i. that in the case of a convention
application, the application was not made
within twelve months from the date of the
first application for protection for the
invention made in a convention country by
the applicant or a person from whom he
derives title;
j. that the complete specification does not
disclose or wrongly mentions the source or
geographical origin of biological material
used for the invention;
k. that the invention so far as claimed in any
claim of the complete specification is
anticipated
having
regard
to
the
knowledge, oral or otherwise, available
within any local or indigenous community
in India or elsewhere;
FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.10 of 31

but on no other ground.
(2) Where any such notice of opposition is duly
given, the Controller shall notify the applicant
and may, if so desired, give to the applicant and
the opponent an opportunity to be heard before
deciding the case.
(3) The grant of a patent shall not be refused on
the ground stated in clause (c) of sub-section (1)
if no patent has been granted in pursuance of
the application mentioned in that clause; and for
the purpose of any inquiry under clause (d) or
clause (e) of that sub-section, no account
personal document or secret trial or secret use.
Section 116. (1) Subject to the provisions of
this Act, the Appellate Board established under
section 83 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 shall be
the Appellate Board for the purposes of this Act
and the said Appellate Board shall exercise the
jurisdiction, power and authority conferred on it
by or under this Act:
Provided that the Technical Member of the
Appellate Board for the purposes of this Act shall
have the qualifications specified in sub-section
(2).
(2) A person shall not be qualified for
appointment as a Technical Member for the
purposes of this Act unless he(a) has, at least five years, hold the post of
Controller under this Act or has exercised the
functions of the Controller under t his Act for at
least five years; or
(b) has, for at least ten years, functioned as a
Registered Patent Agent and possesses a degree
in engineering or technology or a masters
degree in science from any University
established under law for the time being in force
or equivalent; or
FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.11 of 31

(c) has, for at least ten years, been an
advocate of a proven specialized experience in
practising law relating to patents and designs.
Section 117A.(1) Save as otherwise expressly
provided in sub-section (2), no appeal shall lie
from any decision, order or direction made or
issued under this Act by the Central
Government, or from any act or order of the

months from the date of the decision, order or
direction, as the case may be, of the Controller
or the Central Government or within such further
time as the Appellate Board may, in accordance
with the rules made by it, allow.'
13.

Even to a lay man it would be apparent that if brought

into force immediately when the Amendment Act of 2002 was
FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.12 of 31

promulgated there existed only one right to challenge a patent
i.e. at the pre-grant stage and against orders passed by the
Controller of Patents a remedy of appeal was available before
the Appellate Board by virtue of Sub-Section 2 of Section 117A.
Relevant would it be to note that by virtue of Section 116(1)
the Appellate Board established under Section 83 of the
T.M.Act, 1999 was the Appellate Board for the purposes of the
Patents Act.

14.

The provisions of the Patent Amendment Act, 2002 were

not simultaneously brought into force.

On 20.5.2003 a

notification No.SO561E was notified notifying certain provisions
of the Amendment Act to be brought into force. Suffice would
it be to note that Section 18 of the Amendment Act of 2002
which was amending Section 25 of the principal Act was
brought into force under the notification. Section 47 of the
Amendment Act, 2002 which substituted the entire Chapter
XIX (which included Section 116, 117 and 117A) was not
brought into force.

15.

If the Patent Act, 1970 as amended from time to time and

as in force as of 20.5.2003 had to be considered pertaining to
a challenge to a patent the legal position would that

FAO No.292-293/2006

under

Page No.13 of 31

Section 25 only one right to oppose a patent at the pre-grant
stage was available and appeal against an order passed by the
Controller of Patents was available before the High Court under
Section 116 of the Patents Act for the reason by not bringing
into force Section 47 of the Amendment Act, 2002, Chapter XIX
as existing in the statute book minus the amendments to be
incorporated as per Section 47 of the Amendment Act of 2002
continued to remain in the statute book.

16.

Without promulgating the date to bring into effect the

remaining provisions of the Patent Amendment Act, 2002 i.e.
the provisions which were not brought into force by virtue of
the notification dated 20.5.2003, on 4.5.2005 the legislature
promulgated the Patents Amendment Act, 2005.

Even

pertaining to the Amendment Act of 2005, not all provisions
thereof were simultaneously brought into force. Only certain
Sections of the Amendment Act of 2005 were brought into
force.

17.

Sub-Section 2 of Section 1 of the Patents Amendment

Act, 2005 reads as under :-

'Section 1(1)..........

FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.14 of 31

(2) (ii) (a), and clause (b), of Section 37, Sections
41, 42, 47, 59 to 63 (both inclusive and Section 74
shall come into force on such date as the Central
Government may, by notification in the Official
Gazette, appoint; and the remaining provisions of
this Act shall be deemed to have come into force
on the first date of January, 2005.'
18.

Vide Section 23 of the Patents Amendment Act 2005

existing Section 25 was substituted. The substituted Section
25 reads as under :-

Further, vide Section 60 of the Amendment Act of 2005,

Clause 'c' of Sub-Section 2 of Section 116 of the Principal Act
as substituted by Section 47 of the Patents Amendment Act,
2002 was omitted. Further, vide Section 61 of the Amendment
Act of 2005, Section 117A of the principal Act as inserted by
Section 47 of the Patents Amendment Act, 2002 was also
amended, in that, in Sub-Section 2 of Section 117A the words

were to be substituted by the figures and words 'Section 20,
Sub-Section 4 of Section 25, Section 28'.

20.

Section 61 of the Patents Amendment Act, 2005 reads as

under :-

'Section 61. In Section 117A of the principal
Act [as inserted by section 47 of the Patents
(Amendment) Act, 2002], in sub-section (2), for
the words and figures “section 20, section 25,
section 27, section 28,”, the words, figures and
brackets “section 20, sub-section (4) of section
25, section 28” shall be substituted.'
21.

It would be interesting to note that the Amendment Act of

2005 amended certain provisions of the Amendment Act, 2002
which were not even brought into force by the time the
Amendment Act of 2005 was enacted. It is also interesting to
note that save and except some provisions of the Amendment
Act of 2005 which were simultaneously brought into force
when the Amendment Act of 2005 was promulgated other
provisions were to be brought into force as and when a
notification was published in the Official Gazette.

22.

On the date when the instant appeals were filed, Chapter

XIX of the principal Act, i.e. the Patents Act, 1970 as amended
FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.21 of 31

vide Amendment Act of 1999 continued to be operative
notwithstanding the enactment of the Patent Amendment Act,
2002 and the Patent Amendment Act, 2005 since Section 47 of
the Amendment Act of 2002 which replaced Chapter XIX was
being brought into force.

23.

2 notifications were published in the Official Gazette on

2.4.2007.

Vide notification No.SO.510(E), exercising power

under Sub-Section 2 of Section 1 of the Patents Amendment
Act, 2002 the Central Government notified the remaining
provisions of the Amendment Act of 2002 to come into force
with effect from the date of the notification. Vide another
notification of even date, exercising power under Sub-Section 2
of Section 1 of the Patents Amendment Act, 2005 i.e.
notification SO.509(E) the remaining provisions of the Patent
Amendment Act, 2005 were also brought into force by the
Central Government.

24.

Needless to state, Section 47 of the Amendment Act of

2002 as amended by the Amendment Act of 2005 was brought
into force w.e.f. 2.4.2007. Meaning thereby existing Chapter
XIX was brought into force.

In other words, the forum of

appeal was the Appellate Board and the right of appeal was

FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.22 of 31

restricted to an order passed by the Controller under SubSection 4 of Section 25 of the Patent Act, 1970 as amended
from time to time. No appeal lay against an order passed by
the Controller
maintainable

under Section 25(1)
against

an

order

i.e. no appeal was

passed

relatable

to

an

opposition to a grant of a patent at the pre-grant stage.

25.

To put it pithily, the legislative intent evidenced by the

Patent Amendment Act, 2002 and the Patent Amendment Act,
2005 is to give a right to every person to oppose the grant of a
patent i.e. file a pre-grant opposition. A second stage right is
also granted, but limited to a person interested to file a post
grant opposition. Orders pertaining to a pre-grant opposition
are not appealable orders. Orders pertaining to the post-grant
opposition are appealable orders. The appellate forum is the
Appellate Board and not the High Court.

26.

But the manner in which the legislative provisions were

brought into force have resulted in a problem. The original Act
contemplated only one stage of opposition to an application
seeking grant of a patent i.e. opposition at the pre-grant stage.
Section 25 as enacted so stipulates. Further, a remedy by way
of an appeal was available under Section 116 i.e. before the

FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.23 of 31

High Court.

Vide Section 23 of the Patent Amendment Act,

2005 existing Section 25 was amended.

Whereas only one

right of opposition at the pre-grant stage was given to any
person; to a person interested a second right of opposition was
given at the post grant stage.

Further, no appeal was

contemplated against an order passed by the Controller of
Patents pertaining to a pre-grant opposition but against an
order passed at the post grant opposition which right of
opposition was restricted to a person interested a right of
appeal was given before the Appellate Tribunal.

27.

It is settled law that a right of appeal is a vested right.

Further, the availability of a remedy to an aggrieved person
has to be determined with reference to the legislative
provisions in force on the date when the aggrieved person
alleges that a wrong has been committed.

28.

There can be no doubt that the legislative intent under

the Patent Amendment Act, 2002 as well as the Patent
Amendment Act, 2005 was to do away with the right to appeal
against an order passed by the Controller of Patents at the pregrant opposition stage and that the only right of appeal was
intended to be against orders passed by the Controller at the

FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.24 of 31

post opposition stage.

Further, the legislative intent was to

substitute the forum of appeal being the High Court with the
Appellate Tribunal. But

due to not bringing into force

the

relevant sections of the Amendment Act, 2002 and the
Amendment Act, 2005 the inevitable legal consequence has to
be that the existing rights and remedies remained available as
per the statutory provisions in force till the notifications above
noted were issued on 2.4.2007.

29.

Ms.Pratibha Singh, learned counsel for the respondent

urged that the statutory provisions have to be construed with
reference to the legislative intention. Learned counsel urged
that the legislative intention was to take away the right of
appeal against orders passed by the Controller under SubSection 1 of Section 25. Thus, counsel urged that the appeals
should be held to be not maintainable.

Learned counsel,

Ms.Pratibha Singh, highlighted analomous situations arising if
right of appeal curtailed under Section 117A (2) was not given
full effect to. With reference to Sections 27, 86, 88(3), 89, 93,
96 and 97, learned counsel pointed out that a laughable
situation would arise if right of appeal had to be construed with
reference to Section 116 forming part of Chapter XIX ignoring
the replacement of said Chapter vide Section 47 of the Patent
FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.25 of 31

Amendment Act, 2002.

30.

I may highlight the argument with reference to Section 96

of the Patents Act which was deleted when some provisions of
the Patent Amendment Act, 2002 were brought into force w.e.f
20.5.2003.

Counsel pointed out that under existing Section

116 an appeal was maintainable against an order passed
under Section 96 of the Patent Act, 1970. Counsel wondered
as to how could an appeal lie against an order relatable to a
Section which was not even in the statute book?

31.

No doubt, the submission made by learned counsel for

the respondent does bring out a fairly laughable situation, in
that, as of 20.5.2003 due to promulgation of a notification on
said date bringing into force certain provisions of the Patents
Amendment Act, 2002 but not bringing into effect the
proposed amendment vide Section 47 of the Amendment Act
of 2002 provision relating to appeal i.e. Section 116 as existing
pre-amendment

continued

to

remain

as

the

legislative

provision in force but certain Sections, orders whereto were
made appealable were deleted from the statute book.

The

laughable situation is that a right of appeal existed against
orders passed under a Section which did not exist.

FAO No.292-293/2006

In other

Page No.26 of 31

words, against non-existing substantive orders the ghost
remedy of appeal continued to be available.

32.

In my opinion I need not look to anamolies which may be

highlighted with reference to other provisions of the Act which
are not relatable to Section 25 and the remedy of appeal
provided under the Act for the reason there is no conflict with
the said other provisions vis-a-vis Section 25 and the remedy
of appeal under Section 116 pertaining to orders passed under
Section 25.

An anomaly vis-a-vis the right of appeal and

substantive orders passed under other provisions of the Act
would have to be looked into and resolved in an appropriate
case, should one come up before this Court.

33.

It is settled law that when enacting a Statute the

legislature can delegate the power to the executive to bring
into effect and notify the date on which the legislative
provision would come into force. It is also settled law that the
right of appeal is a substantive and a vested right and cannot
be taken away by implication. It is also settled law that it is
not permissible to supply a casus omissus. Only if the words
are general, in a case within the mischief of the Act, a court
may adopt a construction, if reasonably possible, to cover the

FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.27 of 31

case.

34.

The instant case highlights a rather grim picture of those

in the executive to whom the legislature has entrusted the
pious

duty

of

giving

effect

to

the

legislative

intent.

Conventionally understood, rights and remedies go hand in
hand and thus it is imperative that where substantive rights
are proposed to be amended with simultaneous amendments
relating to the remedy, both should be notified together lest
there is a hiatus in the changed substantive right vis-a-vis the
changed appellate remedy. Had the executive been conscious
of this simple rule and had paid heed to it the problem at hand
would never had arisen.

35.

But noting no conflict in the right and the remedy, in the

facts and the circumstances of the instant case, it has to be
held that the date on which the impugned order was passed,
Section 25 which existed in the statute book and in force did
not provide for a post grant opposition to a patent. Only one
right at the pre-grant stage was in force.

The remedy of

appeal was before the High Court. The amended Section 25
was brought into force on 2.4.2007.

Simultaneously, the

change in the appellate forum with right restricted to challenge

FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.28 of 31

an order only at the post grant stage came into force on
2.4.2007.

As noted above, the orders impugned have been

passed on 28.8.2006.
17.10.2006.

The appeals have been lodged on

The legislative provisions in force render the

appeals clearly maintainable. The forum of appeal has to be
the High Court.

36.

Before concluding I may note that Sh.N.K.Kaul, learned

senior counsel for the appellant urged that in view of the
notification dated 3.4.2007 the appeals have to be transferred
to the appellate board. The notification in question reads as
under :-

'S.O.514(E)-In exercise of the powers conferred
by Section 117G of the Patents Act, 1970 (39 of
1970), the Central Government hereby appoints
the 2nd day of April, 2007 as the date on which all
cases of appeals against any order or decision of
the Controller and all cases pertaining to
revocation of patent other than on a counter-claim
in a suit for infringement and rectification of
register pending before any High Court, shall
transferred to the appellate board.'
37.

Section 117G reads as under :-

'117G. Transfer of pending proceedings to
Appellate Board.- All cases of appeals against
any order or decision of the Controller and all cases
pertaining to revocation of patent other than on a
FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.29 of 31

counter-claim in a suit for infringement and
rectification of register pending before any High
Court, shall be transferred to the Appellate Board
from such date as may be notified by the Central
Government in the Official Gazette and the
Appellate Board may proceed with the matter either
de novo or from the stage it was so transferred.'
38.

Ms. Pratibha Singh, learned counsel for the respondent

urged that the tribunals can hear an appeal only against orders
passed under Sub-Section 4 of Section 25 of the Patent
Amendment Act, 1970 as amended by the Patent Amendment
Act of 2002 read with the Patent Amendment Act, 2005.
Counsel urged that the amended provisions came into force on
2.4.2007. Counsel wondered as to how can a board hear an
appeal against an order passed at the pre-grant opposition
stage.

39.

The language of Section 117G makes it clear that all

appeals against

decision of a Controller other than on a

counter claim on a suit for infringement or a rectification of a
register pending before any High Court shall be transferred to
the Appellate Board.

In other words, the plain and simple

language of the statute requires the instant appeals to be
transferred to the Appellate Board.

40.

Holding that the appeals are maintainable and also

FAO No.292-293/2006

Page No.30 of 31

holding that under Section 117G read with the notification
dated 3.4.2007 the appeals require to be transferred to the
Appellate

Board,

I

direct

the

registry

to

forthwith

remit/transfer the appeals to the Appellate Board constituted
under Section 83 of the T.M. Act, 1999.

41.

No costs.
