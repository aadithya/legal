PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
Appellant was awarded

the

work

of

external

electrification and erection of sub-station at the plot allotted to
the respondent society. The work was awarded pursuant to a
tender floated by the society. The tender documents were as
framed by the society.

In terms of the tender documents

formal agreement was executed between the parties on
26.6.1998. Clause 4 whereof reads as under :“4. The written plans, agreement and
documents above mentioned shall form the
basis of this contract and the decision of the
page 1 of 7

2.

said Archgitects or employer for the time
being as mentioned in the conditions of the
contract in reference to all matters of disputes
as to the material, workmanship or account
and as to the intened interpretation or the
clause
of this agreement
to any other
documents attached hereto shall be final and
binding on both the parties and may be made
a Rule of Court.”
According to the contractor, having successfully

completed the work and final bill being certified for payment
notwithstanding cheque No.484239 dated 30.3.2000 in sum of
Rs.11,12,886/-

being issued, the society did not make

available the requisite funds with the bank resulting in the
cheque being dishonoured.

The contractor's pleas

to the

society to make good the said payment and also return the
security deposit was not accepted by the society necessitating
invocation of the

clause afore-noted which according to the

contractor constitutes a valid

and a binding arbitration

agreement between the parties.
3.

It is not in dispute that the society engaged

Aggarwal Arora Architects Pvt.Ltd. as their architect.

The

contractor wrote a letter to Aggarwal Arora Architects Pvt.Ltd.
with a copy to the society calling upon that

that a juristic person cannot

function as an

arbitrator.
4.

Learned arbitrator dismissed the said application on
page 3 of 7

15.7.2003 and notified 30.7.2003 as the last date by which
reply had to be filed.

On 30.7.2003 counsel for the society

sought an adjournment. He stated that the society wanted to
challenge

the

order

passed

by

the

learned

arbitrator

dismissing the application under Section 16 of Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Learned arbitrator informed the counsel for
the society that the said order could not be challenged at the
interim stage of the arbitration proceedings and the society had
to await the award.

Yet inspite thereof the society chose not

to file a response to the claim petition. The society chose to
absent itself from further

hearings resulting in award being

published on 18.8.2003.
5.

In

the

award

learned

arbitrator

has

awarded

Rs.11.12,886/- the amount covered by the dishonoured cheque
as also the refund of security deposit in sum of Rs.1,00,000/and money deducted from the running bills in sum of
Rs.2,58,140/-. Interest @ 12% per annum has been allowed on
both the claims allowed.
6.

The society filed objections to the award inter alia

alleging that the clause in question does not constitute an
arbitration clause.

Alternatively it was submitted that a juristic

person cannot act as an arbitrator.
7.

Learned Judge who considered the objections of the
page 4 of 7

society has concurred.
8.

The contractor is in an appeal under Section 37 of

the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,1996.
9.

In respect of the first ground held in favour of the

society by the learned Judge, I note the decision of the
Supreme Court reported as 2003 (3) Arb.LR 579 Mallikarjun V.
Gulbarga University.

Clause 30 of the agreement which was

considered by their Lordships of the Supreme Court reads as
under :-

10.

“The decision of the Superintending Engineer
of the Gulbarga Circle for the time being shall
be final, conclusive and binding on all parties to
the contract upon all questions relating to the
meaning of the specifications, designs,
drawings and instructions herein before
mentioned and as to the
quality of
workmanship or material used on the work, or
as to any other question, claim, right, matter,
or thing whatsoever, in any way arising out of,
or relating to the contract, designs, drawings,
specifications, estimate, instructions, orders or
those conditions, or otherwise concerning the
works or the execution, or failure to execute
the same, whether arising during the progress
of the work, or after the completion or
abandonment thereof in case of dispute arising
between
the
contractor
and
Gulbarga
University.”
It was held that the clause was sufficiently worded to

be interpreted as an arbitration clause.
11.

I need note no further other than to record that

clause 4 of the arbitration between the parties is worded in
language fairly akin to clause 30 of the agreement which was
page 5 of 7

subject matter of the decision in Mallikarjun's case.
12.

Thus, objection taken

that the clause in question

does not constitute a valid arbitration clause is over ruled.
13.

Pertaining to the second objection, suffice would it

be to note that the architect

has been appointed by the

society. Clause 3 of the agreement between the parties reads
as under :“3. The term “Architect/Consultants” in the
said conditions shall mean the said M/s
Aggarwal Arora Architects (P) Ltd. or in the
event of their death or ceasing to be the
Architects for the purpose of this contract,
such other person as shall be nominated for
that purpose by the employer, not being a
person to whom the contractor shall object
for reason considered to be sufficiently
appointed to be Architects under this contract
shall be entitled to disregard or over-rule any
decision or approval or direction given or
expressed in writing by the Architects for the
time being.”
The contra preferential rules may come into force.

14.

The society which is the author of the document must suffer the
consequences of vagueness in the contract.

That apart, the

society chose to make its architect as the arbitrator.
architect happens to be a private limited company.
the

The
Thus,

company had to act through a live human being.

The

arbitrator could not be other than the managing director
thereof.
15.

In my opinion it does not lie in the mouth of the
page 6 of 7

society

to

turn

around

and

challenge

the

award

on

technicalities which has been published by its own architect.
16.

In equity, I may note that claim No.1 pertained to

the dishonoured cheque which the society has issued. Claim
No.2 related to the return of earnest money and security
deposit deducted from the running bills.
17.

Indeed, the contractor proved entitlement.

18.

Interest awarded @ 12% p.a. is fair and reasonable.

19.

I allow the appeal.

The impugned order dated

7.9.2005 is set aside. Appellant would be entitled to costs in
sum of Rs.10,000/- against the respondent.
