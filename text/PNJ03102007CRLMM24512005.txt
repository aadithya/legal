PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

M/s.Ritesh Enterprises is a partnership firm. Rakesh

Gondal, Rajesh Sood and Ms.Santwanter Gondal are its 3
partners.

By way of the above 4 captioned petitions, the

partnership firm and its 3 partners pray that the complaint filed
against them by the Enforcement Directorate under Section 57
FERA and Section 49(3)(4) of FEMA pending before the learned
Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi be quashed.
2.

It is stated in the complaint that on 28.4.1995 the

Enforcement Directorate imposed a penalty of Rs.2,50,000/- on
accused persons which was recoverable from them jointly and
that the penalty was not deposited.

It was stated that the

adjudication order dated 28.4.1995 was passed inasmuch as
the accused persons had contravened provisions of the Foreign
Exchange Regulation Act 1973.

Crl.M.C. Nos.2451, 2462, 2488 & 2569/05

Page No.2 of 9

3.

As per the adjudication order it stands recorded that

the accused persons have contravened Sections 18(2)(3) of the
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1973.
4.

The

adjudication

M/s.Ritesh Enterprises

had

order

records

outstanding

that

the

export

firm

unrealized

proceeds in sum of Rs.6,35,400/- and as per letter issued on
31.7.1989 received from the Reserve Bank of India the firm had
applied for a right-off/extension of time to the Reserve Bank of
India for realizing the outstanding export proceeds and that in
respect

of

outstanding

realizable

amount

in

sum

of

Rs.3,82,857.50 out of Rs.6,35,400/- the Reserve Bank of India
had sought certain information from the firm which was not
supplied.
5.

The adjudication order further records that on

19.11.1990, with reference to the information received by the
department from the Reserve Bank of India pertaining to export
proceeds in sum of Rs.3,82,857/- vide memorandum No.T
4/288/DZ/90/DD show cause notice was issued to the firm and
its 3 partners. A reply was received to the memorandum dated
19.11.1990

on

13.2.1991

from

the

firm

informing

that

pertaining to the pending realization of Rs.3,82,857/- only
Rs.14,441/- was balance because in the record wrong amount

Crl.M.C. Nos.2451, 2462, 2488 & 2569/05

Page No.3 of 9

was noted.

Even freight part was reflected as amount

realizable.
6.

The order records that in support of the stand taken

in the reply and pertaining to a certification from the banker
that Rs.3,68,416/- had been received, the department wanted a
clarification

for

which

adjudicating

authority

granted

opportunities to the firm to give the necessary clarifications on
25.2.1992, 27.11.1992, 17.12.1993, 31.10.1994, 29.10.1994
and 28.2.1994. The adjudication order further records that on
no date was any clarification given.
7.

The adjudication order records that the clarification

wanted was in light of the fact that certificate of the banker was
not clear and that the department had wanted to know as to
against which GRI form, what payment was received.
8.

The adjudication order concludes by noting that

since the firm and its partners have not submitted GRI
realization certificate and in respect of repeated opportunities
have failed to clarify with respect to the ambiguous certificate
issued by the banker, there was enough material to hold that
there was a contravention of Section 18(2)(3) of FERA 1973. So
holding, penalty in sum of Rs.2,50,000/- was imposed.
9.

Challenging the complaint which has been filed it is

Crl.M.C. Nos.2451, 2462, 2488 & 2569/05

Page No.4 of 9

urged in the petition that the adjudication order is contrary to
law. 5 grounds have been urged in all petitions. The same are
as under:A.

That the order of the Adjudicating Authority is
based on surmises and conjectures and despite
the fact that the petitioner had realized the entire
sale

proceeds

and

had

submitted

all

the

documents pertaining thereof, the Adjudicating
Authority imposed the penalty, which is absolutely
illegal and in contravention of the statute.
B.

That

the

Adjudicating

Authority

failed

to

appreciate the facts mentioned in letters dated
10.12.90

and

13.2.91

addressed

to

the

Enforcement Department, where by it was clear
that the petitioner had realized sufficient sale
proceed

leaving

balance

only

in

thousands.

Copies of the letters are Annexure C and D.
C.

That

the

Adjudicating

Authority

failed

to

appreciate the fact that even out of the balance
amount of Rs.14,441/- an amount of Rs.14,000/was also realized, and this fact is quite clear from
the certificate dated 6.3.92 of the Bank, and the

Crl.M.C. Nos.2451, 2462, 2488 & 2569/05

Page No.5 of 9

petitioner's letter dated 6.3.92.

Copy of the

letters are annexed as Annexure E & F.
D.

That the petitioner vide letter dated 16.11.92
finally also informed the Enforcement Directorate
that the payments have already been clear, and
the required bank certificates have already been
submitted

about

8

months

back,

still

the

Adjudicating Authority failed to appreciate the
correctness of the facts.

Copy of the letter is

annexed herewith as Annexure G.
E.

That all the pending outstanding sale proceeds
were realized as under:-

Total outstanding

:

Rs.3,82,857.50

Amounts realized
:
Rs,3,68,416.00
(Banker's certificate dt.13.2.91)
Amount realized
:
(Banker's certificate dt.6.3.92)
Total amount realized
:

Rs.14,000.00

Balance outstanding

Rs.441.50

:

Rs.3,82,416.00

Here it is pertinent to mention that even the
Reserve Bank of India allows realization of 10% of
the

total

export

amount,

and

the

balance

unrealized amount is even less than 1% of the
total outstanding.
Crl.M.C. Nos.2451, 2462, 2488 & 2569/05

Page No.6 of 9

10.

It is not in dispute that the adjudication order has

not been challenged by way of further proceedings by the
petitioners. It has attained finality.
11.

Thus,

it

is

impermissible

to

challenge

the

adjudication order in the instant petitions.
12.

Of course, at the trial it would be open to the

petitioners to prove whatever facts they intend to prove.
13.

It would be relevant to note that the complaint in

question is not on account of the same facts which have
constituted the gravement of the allegations in the adjudication
proceedings but is based on the fact that the penalty imposed
pursuant to the adjudication order has not been paid.
14.

I have my doubts whether in view of the fact that the

adjudication order has attained finality, petitioners can question
the legality of the adjudication order before the learned Trial
Judge.
15.

But I hasten to add that this is my prima facie view

and not a conclusive finding.

Needless to state, the learned

Metropolitan Magistrate would decide the issue in view of the
evidence led.
16.

Though not urged

in the petition, much less

predicated as a ground, an oral plea was urged that the

Crl.M.C. Nos.2451, 2462, 2488 & 2569/05

Page No.7 of 9

adjudication order has not been served upon the appellants.
Counsel stated that in that view of the matter, where was the
occasion for the appellants to challenge the adjudication order
under the statute.
17.

I am afraid, said submission lost its punch for the

reason when summoning order was received by the petitioners
pursuant to the complaint lodged before the learned Additional
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, since adjudication order has
been referred to in the complaint, obviously, petitioners gained
knowledge that an adjudication order has been passed against
them. Indeed, along with the petition, copy of the adjudication
order has been filed.

Thus, at that stage, stating that

petitioners gained knowledge of the adjudication order when
summoning order was received by them, seeking condonation
of delay or otherwise pleading that limitation would commence
when adjudication order is served upon them, the adjudication
order could be challenged by the petitioners by way of
remedies under the statute, but they have not done so.
18.

I

may

incidentally

note,

as

recorded

in

the

adjudication order, petitioners had failed to give the necessary
clarifications spread over 3 years when matter was being
adjourned by the adjudicating officer.

Crl.M.C. Nos.2451, 2462, 2488 & 2569/05

Page No.8 of 9

19.

It reveals the utter carelessness of the petitioners.

20.

I find no merits in the petitions.

The same are

dismissed.
21.

LCR be returned.
