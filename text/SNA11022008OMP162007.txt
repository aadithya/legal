The

petitioner

has

filed

this

petition

against

the

respondent seeking to challenge the arbitral award dated
24.08.2005 under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996.
A panel of three Arbitrators comprising Hon'ble Mr. Justice

OMP No. 16/2007

Page Number 1 of 7

S.S. Chadha and Hon'ble Mr. Justice J.K. Mehra, former judges of
this Court and Mr. P.B. Menon, Sr. Advocate had passed an
award against the petitioner on 24.08.2005 in the sum of Rs. 16
lacs with interest @ 9% per annum till realization.
The objections against the arbitral award were filed by the
petitioner on 08.01.2007. The petitioner has alleged that he
had received the copy of the award for the first time on
11.12.2006 through a communication dated 08.12.2006 sent
by M/s Punj Sons Pvt. Ltd. Mr. Oberoi, the learned counsel for
the respondent has raised a preliminary objection to the
maintainability of the present petition. He has argued that the
petition is hopelessly barred by limitation and according to him
the letter dated 11.12.2006 purported to had been received by
the petitioner from M/s Punj Sons Pvt. Ltd. is a fabricated
document and was fabricated by the petitioner to cook up a
false story of having received the arbitral award on 11.12.006
to bring his objection within limitation. Mr. Oberoi, has
contended that the copy of the arbitral award dated 24.08.2005
was sent to the petitioner not only by the Arbitrators but also
by

the

respondent

OMP No. 16/2007

immediately

after

the

award

was

Page Number 2 of 7

pronounced on 24.08.2005. The respondent had sent a notice
to the petitioner on 06.09.2005 by registered A.D. Post and had
annexed the copy of the arbitral award dated 24.08.2005 along
with the said notice. This notice sent by the respondent to the
petitioner was addressed at its last known address of Kalkaji
Industrial Area, Kalkaji, New Delhi. The respondent has filed
A.D. card along with its reply to show service of notice dated
06.09.2005 upon the petitioner. A perusal of the notice dated
06.09.2005 filed by the respondent along with its reply would
clearly show that the copy of the arbitral award was sent by the
respondent to the petitioner way back in September, 2005. In
order to bring the present objection petition within limitation,
the petitioner seeks to rely upon a communication dated
08.12.2006 purported to had been received by the petitioner
from M/s Punj Sons Pvt. Ltd. on 11.12.2006. The contents of the
said communication are extracted below:-

Lapinus Rockwool Private Limited,
OMP No. 16/2007

Page Number 3 of 7

Kalkaji Industrial Area,
Kalkaji, New Delhi-110019
Dear Sir,
While going through old records in the office of the
Company, we found an Arbitration award in the
matter of MRF Vs Lapinus Rockwool Private
Limited. On contacting office of Lapinus at New
Delhi, we were informed by Mr. Deep Chand that
this matter relates to you. Hence, we are sending
you the documents found in the office.
Kindly acknowledge the receipt,
Thanking you,
Yours faithfully,
for Punj Sons Pvt. Ltd.
Authorized Signatory”

Mr. Singh, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner has argued that M/s Punj Sons Pvt. Ltd. and Company
Ms. Lapinus Rockwool Pvt. Ltd are mainly owned by two real
brothers M/s V.P. Punj and Mr. R.P. Punj. According to Mr. Singh
there were disputes and differences amongst the two brothers.
On account of their disputes and differences, the officials of M/s
Punj Sons Pvt. Ltd. were obstructimg the ingress and egress of
the people belonging to the company of the petitioner and for
OMP No. 16/2007

Page Number 4 of 7

that reason, the petitioner had to file a suit for permanent
injunction against M/s Punj Sons Pvt. Ltd. in 1991 much prior to
the passing of the arbitral award which was passed in 2005.
Mr. Singh has contended that on account of disputes amongst
the brothers, the copy of the arbitral award sent by the
Arbitrators was not received in the office of the petitioner
company. According to the petitioner, the copy of the arbitral
award was received by the petitioner when it was sent by an
authorized

signatory

of

M/s

Punj

Sons

Pvt.

Ltd.

vide

communication dated 08.12.2006 after the demise of Mr. V.P.
Punj who expired on 08.10.2006. The submissions in regard to
the communication dated 08.12.2006 made on behalf of the
petitioner do not inspire confidence of this Court. It is difficult to
believe that officials of M/s Punj Sons Pvt. Ltd. would send the
copy of the award to the petitioner after the demise of Mr. V.P.
Punj, the then Chairman of the said company. It is not disputed
that copy of the arbitral award sent by the Arbitrators as well
as by the respondent immediately after pronouncement of the
award on 24.08.2005 were sent at the correct address of the
petitioner. The copy of the award sent to the petitioner by the
OMP No. 16/2007

Page Number 5 of 7

Arbitrators was not returned back undelivered. Rather copy of
that award has been filed by the petitioner itself along with its
objection petition. It cannot be believed that copy of the award
sent by the Arbitrators at the correct address of the petitioner's
company could have been delivered at the premises of another
company i.e. M/s Punj Sons Pvt. Ltd., though at the relevant
time both the companies were operating from the same
premises. Under the circumstances, this Court is convinced that
the petitioner had received the copy of the arbitral award dated
24.08.2005 on or around September, 2005.
Section 34 (3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
prescribes a period of three months for filing of objections
against the arbitral award and this period of three months is to
be reckoned from the date of receipt of the arbitral award by
the party who seeks to challenge the award. Proviso to Section
34 (3) gives a discretion to the Court to permit a party to file
objections within 30 days beyond three months time prescribed
for filing of objections on showing of sufficient cause for not
filing the objections within the said time period of three
months. There are any number of judgments, both of Hon'ble
OMP No. 16/2007

Page Number 6 of 7

Supreme Court and also of this Court laying down the law that
the Court has no power to entertain the objections against the
arbitral award after expiry of four months time from the date of
receipt of award by the party seeking to challenge such award.
Reference is made to a Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in UOI Vs. Popular Construction Co. (2001) 8 SCC 470.
The present objection petition has been filed by the
petitioner much after expiry of four months' time prescribed
under Section 34 (3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 for filing of the objections against the arbitral award.
Hence this petition is hereby dismissed as barred by limitation
leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
