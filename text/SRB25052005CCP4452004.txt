respondent/accused, an official of the Municipal Corporation of India (hereafter “MCD”)
for wilful and deliberate disobedience of the order of this court dated 1.10.2003 in
WP(C)No.5422/2003.

During course of hearing, the arguments were addressed in

relation to the role of respondent No. 2 (hereafter “comtemnor/accused”)
2.

Briefly the facts are that the petitioner, owner occupier of C-126 Defence Colony,

CONT.CAS.445-04

1 OF 17

New Delhi, claimed that illegal constructions, in violation of provisions of the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (hereafter called "the Act"), Building bye-laws and
other mandatory norms were carried out in the neighbouring plot, No.C-125. It was
alleged that the MCD was lax in its implementation of the norms; as a result of its
inaction, the sanctioned plan was not available at the site and the building was constructed
in utter violation of building bye-laws. In her writ petition, (WP 5422/2003) filed on
25.8.2003, the owner occupier’s name was disclosed and it was also averred that the
building activities were illegal.
3.

On 27.8.2003, this court made the following order on the writ petition:

“The petitioner is aggrieved by the construction in property No.C-125,
Defence Colony on the ground that the same is not in accordance with the
sanction plan.
A query was put to the petitioner whether the petitioner is willing to file any
photographs about the status of the property. However, petitioner states
that it is for the respondent alone to take action and to perform the statutory
duty.
In view of the aforesaid position, the only direction which can be passed at
present is for respondent No.2 to submit a status report after inspection of
the property in question. The property of the petitioner shall also be
inspected and the status should be incorporated in the status report. The
needful be done within a maximum period of four weeks.
List on 1st October, 2003.”

4.

On 27.9.2003, the contemnor accused, (Shri. M.M.Dahiya, Executive Engineer

CONT.CAS.445-04

2 OF 17

(Building) of the concerned zone of the MCD) filed an affidavit that the building plan for
property was sanctioned on 1.4.2003 and that during inspection the owner and his
representative were found to have deviated from the sanctioned plan regarding basement,
ground floor, first floor and second floor and raised unauthorized construction of servant
quarter at the third floor of which the property was booked on 1.9.2003. There was
deviation of the sanctioned plan through infringement of setbacks and excess coverage at
the basement, ground floor, first floor, second floor and unauthorized construction of
servant quarter existed at the third floor. It was also stated that show cause notice under
Section 343/344 (1) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act (hereafter “the Act”) was
issued on 1.9.2003 and that the owners/occupiers failed to respond to the show cause
notice. It was also averred that after following due process of law, a demolition notice
dated 8.9.2003 was issued, requiring the owners to remove unauthorized construction
within a stipulated period of six days.
5.

It was deposed that the demolition notice too was disregarded; resultantly a

demolition order was issued on 17.9.2003. Apparently an attempt to implement the
demolition order was planned on 20.9.2003 but due to shortage of time it could not be
followed up, since demolition action was initiated for property bearing No.C-140, having
regard to orders in another writ petition. The deponent assured the court that pursuant to
the notice, the owner/builder himself removed a ceiling in the servant’s quarter at the third
floor. It was lastly stated that apart from demolition the MCD had initiated sealing under
CONT.CAS.445-04

3 OF 17

the Act.
6.

This court after hearing the parties and considering the averments disposed of the

writ petition on 1.10.2003 in the following terms:
“The status report has been filed by respondent NO.2 MCD in respect of
property bearing No.C-125, Defence Colony, New Delhi. It is stated in the
status report that plans for the said property were sanctioned on
01.04.2003, but on inspection, it has been found that there have been
deviations from the sanctioned plan at basement, ground floor, first floor
and second floor and further unauthorized construction has been raised on
the third floor. It is stated that the said unauthorized construction was
booked on 01.09.2003 and show-cause notice was issued on the same date
under Section 343/344(1) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957.
No reply was filed within the time stipulated and, thus, demolition notice
dated 08.09.2003 was issued and demolition orders have been passed on
17.09.2003. It is further stated that action was planned on 20.09.2003, but
due to shortage of time, the same could not be implemented inasmuch as
that some action was required to be taken with respect to another property
in pursuance to certain directions of the Court. The status report states that
prompt action shall be taken against the unauthorized construction.
The status report also goes on to state that insofar as the property of the
petitioner at C-126, Defence Colony is concerned, the same is old and
occupied and has been constructed way back in accordance with the
sanctioned plan.
In view of the aforesaid, the only direction to be passed is for the
respondent Corporation to proceed in accordance with law in pursuance to
the Orders already passed and take action is a time-bound schedule. The
necessary action in accordance with law shall be taken within a maximum
period of two months from today.
The writ petition stands disposed of.
Compliance report be filed by respondent MCD within two weeks of expiry
of the aforesaid period with advance copy to the petitioner.
CM No.9558/2003
CONT.CAS.445-04

4 OF 17

No further orders are called for in this application in view of the disposal of
the writ petition.
Application stands disposed of.
Dasti to learned counsel for the parties.”
7.

The petitioner moved an application being CM No.1329/2003 alleging that token

demolition had been performed by the MCD sometime in the last week of October and
that the excess coverage of basement which in addition violated several norms; besides
coverage of 95% of the ground floor area as against 20% permissible existed. The
petitioner/applicant sought for impleadment of the owners and others. The application
was dismissed on 28.11.2003 itself with the observation that in case the petitioner was
aggrieved by violation of any direction she had the liberty to file appropriate proceedings.
8.

It is contended that despite the orders of Court, the contemnor/accused, particularly

Sh. Dahiya deliberately and with wilful motive desisted from taking any action with the
intention of helping the occupiers of the premises, who had violated the law.

Ms.

Vaishali Mehra contented that the status report and the further follow up action disclosed
to this Court at the highest could be construed as half truths and in any case were of
bundle of lies, meant to conceal the truth. The covered area on each floor was in excess
of 2000 sq.ft. According to the norms the covered area on the second floor could not be
more than 750 sq.ft. In the circumstances, demolition of 260 sq.ft. was hardly sufficient
compliance. The action taken was not more than lip service. It was also contended that
there was excess coverage of the basement which was built up to the extent of 95% of the
CONT.CAS.445-04

5 OF 17

ground floor area as against the 20% admissible and that the basement itself was a couple
of feet higher than the stipulated 6 ft. This in turn resulted to several other important
violations which were intentionally overlooked.
9.

It was additionally contended that besides suppressing the real truth from the

Court, the respondent/accused facilitated the occupiers by ensuring that no demolition
action was taken, and they could seek regularization according to amended norms, much
later. Learned counsel also submitted that the adoption of such stratagems to defeat the
orders, and divert the attention of the Court from true facts was not just a deception but
meant to deliberately flout the directions. It was submitted that the deliberate inaction of
the respondent resulted in the occupier filing a writ petition being WP No.2144/2004 in
which the Court directed de-sealing of the premises on 23.2.2004 to enable the occupier
to retrieve drawings and submit them in consonance of an office order. This established
the complicity of the respondent and the MCD generally as the occupier was successful in
filing a revised plan and later depositing the compounding fee. This resulted in the
property being de-sealed and the Court permitting its use to the extent that the occupier
could take possession of the ground floor. It was submitted that all these facilitated in the
further illegal use of the property and the petitioner was compelled to file a suit for
injunction which is still pending consideration.
10.

It was also contended that had proper action been taken by way of sealing the

premises and ensuring demolition of non-compoundable areas in 2003, the occupier could
CONT.CAS.445-04

6 OF 17

not have been allowed to take possession of the premises without bringing the
construction, in conformity with the law.

In these circumstances, the respondent –

contemnor had to be dealt in the most severe manner for wilfully disregarding orders of
the Court. Learned counsel also relied upon the affidavit of Shri Dahiya, filed in April,
2004 in WP 2144/04 and submitted that he withheld any mention of the directions of this
court, as regard action within two months, in respect of C-125. This showed that he was
hand in glove with the occupier, and wanted to favour him, in order to defeat the
directions in WP 5422/03.
11.

The stated position of the respondent-accused Sh. Dahiya is that there was no

disobedience or intentional violation of the Court’s order. According to him, everything
possible in compliance with the orders of the Court in WP.5422/2003 was done.

It was

averred- and has been also contended on his behalf -that right upto 1.10.2003, when the
writ petition was disposed off, several steps were taken which included booking of the
property and issuance of show cause notice on 1.9.2003; issuance of demolition notice
due to omission of owner and builder, to respond to the show notice; and the order of
demolition dated 17.9.2003; all these were brought to the notice of the Court.

It could

not be stated that the respondents ever willfully much less deliberately disregarded or
disobeyed the Court’s order. It was contended that the sealing order was made on
8.10.2003 and it was executed on 14.11.2003 when the premises were actually sealed.
12.

Learned senior counsel Sh. Ashok Bhasin contended that demolition and sealing

CONT.CAS.445-04

7 OF 17

action was planned for 20.9.2003 and even police assistance was forthcoming but due to
shortage of time no action could be taken. All these were disclosed to the Court which
directed the respondents to proceed in accordance with law.

It was contended that

pursuant to a special programme fixed on 31.10.03, demolition action was carried out on
second floor and the servant quarters on the third floor the latter were demolished.
Additionally the roofs existing in the said rear portion were also demolished. However,
action could not be completed and on 14.11.2003 the entire premises were sealed. A copy
of the status report disclosing all this had been filed in WP.5422/2003. All these facts
were within the knowledge of the petitioner.
13.

It was submitted that subsequently WP No.2144/2004 was filed by the occupier

who came forward and expressed willingness to submit fresh plans in terms of amended
bye-laws and in terms of Office order dated 3.3.2004. It was contended that he was ready
to adhere to the new norms fixed by the Malhotra Committee Report and undertook to
deposit a compounding fee.

Interim orders were made on 17.2.2004 to enable the

occupier to inspect the property and facilitate his filing of plans and drawings with the
DDA. After these were done, the MCD filed a status report in W.P.2144/2004 on
7.4.2004. Thereafter the writ petition was disposed of on 30.4.2004 granting the occupier
one month’s time to bring the property within permissible limits. It was contended that
the present petitioner filed a civil suit seeking injunction restraining the occupier from
carrying out constructions. The injunction was declined and CM(M) No.644/2004 was
CONT.CAS.445-04

8 OF 17

filed.

Initially this Court directed a status quo order and thereafter the matter was

dismissed on 11.8.2004.
14.

It was contended that this Court’s order was to take action in accordance with law

and could not be construed as a direction to demolish the non-compoundable portions,
straightaway. Learned counsel submitted that on 1.9.2003 itself a show cause notice and
action by way of booking was taken, thereafter a demolition order was made and
eventually the entire premises were sealed on 14.11.2003. These amounted to taking
action in accordance with law. So long as the MCD and the respondents proceeded to
comply with the direction of 27.8.2003 which was to file a status report after inspecting
the premises, (which was done) and thereafter proceeded to take further action, no
question of any contempt arose. It was further submitted that the order dated 1.10.2003
showed that the only direction which the Court contemplated was that the MCD should
proceed in accordance with law and take action in a time bound manner. The time period
indicated was also two months. Counsel contended that the demolition action taken on
31.10.2004 though partially and followed up with complete sealing up on 14.10.2004
displayed that the respondents acted in bona fide exercise of powers and in furtherance of
the Court’s orders.
15.

Learned counsel submitted that the orders of Court could not be construed as a

mandate to proceed in a particular manner and demolish the property or raze it to the
ground regardless of all other considerations. Of course, the seriousness felt in the matter
CONT.CAS.445-04

9 OF 17

was expressed by indicating the time limit. However, as the reply would show, on two
occasions demolition action was planned but could not be completed due to other
commitments. Moreover sealing of premises was indicative of action in accordance with
law as it is an important step, to enable the occupier to either accept the MCD’s version,
to approach it, seek time for rectifying the construction or appeal against the decision. In
this case the complete sealing of the premises took place on 14.11.2004. The occupier
approached the Court for de-sealing and enabling them to rectify the building and bring it
in conformity with the bye-laws on 16.2.2004. The Court thereafter permitted that action.
In these circumstances, there was no disobedience much less willful disobedience of the
Court’s order.
16.

The above factual narrative would show that the petitioner had approached this

Court claiming that the occupier of C-125, Defence Colony had violated building norms
and indulged in excess construction beyond permissible limits. The Court had directed
inspection of the property by order dated 27.8.2003. Subsequently, status report was filed
indicating that the property had been booked and later demolition action had been
planned. The status report also mentioned issuance of demolition notice and passing of
demolition orders. On the strength of these, the Court disposed of WP.5422/2003 on
1.10.2003 requiring the MCD to take action in accordance with law in a time bound
manner i.e. two months. The further facts which emerge are that on 8.10.2003 the sealing
order was made which is said to have been executed on 14.11.2003. Some portions of the
CONT.CAS.445-04

10 OF 17

property were apparently demolished on 3110.2003. The petitioner’s grievance is that the
full facts were never brought to the notice of the Court and somehow the respondents
contrived a situation whereby the occupier was enabled to approach the Court and get an
order vacating the sealing of the premises and even permitting him to submit further plans
for rectification of the buildings. All these, could not have been without the connivance
of the respondent-contemnor, which is nothing short of contumacious disregard of the
directions of the Court, amounting to wilful disobedience of its directions.
17.

In the present proceedings the records of disposed of writ petition Nos.5422/2003,

2144/2004 & CM(M) 646/2004 as well as the disposed of files in LPA No.961/2004 were
called for. Pleadings and documents in those cases were adverted to by both parties and
their counsel.
18.

The factual narrative would show that initially this Court had directed inspection

on 27.8.2003. On the basis of that direction a status report was filed before the Court on
27.9.2003 through an affidavit. The affidavit mentioned about booking of the property;
demolition notice dated 8.9.2003, demolition orders dated 17.9.2003 and the proposed
action on 20.9.2003.

This Court disposed of the petition directing that action in

accordance with law should be completed, within two months. Two months period would
have ended in January, 2005.

In the meanwhile, the sealing order was issued on

8.10.2003 and subsequently some demolition action took place on 31.10.2003. It is
asserted that the premises were sealed on 14.11.2003. This sealing was done pursuant to
CONT.CAS.445-04

11 OF 17

the courts direction, in WP 5422/03, within the two month period granted for taking
action. The occupier approached this Court on 16.2.2004 and filed wit petition being WP
No.2144/2004. That petition was eventually disposed off, granting limited liberty to
occupy a portion of the premises. In the meanwhile, the court permitted de-sealing of the
premises, as an interim measure.
19.

The Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 undoubtedly enacts distinct stages where

action against unauthorized construction can be taken. These are issuance of show cause
notice outlining the breaches and asking why sealing action need not be taken; depending
on response issuance, issuance of sealing orders and their execution; issuance of
demolition notice detailing the portions that would have to be demolished by the occupier,
failing which the MCD would take action, issuance of orders on the basis of the response
after giving hearing to the owner/occupier. The demolition action has to necessarily
follow after issuance of such order. These stages are essential and have to be followed.
This Court consciously, therefore, did not define what action should be taken, and left it
to be worked out by the respondent MCD, in accordance with law. However, the time
frame indicated was to inject a sense of urgency and ensure that admitted non-compliance
portions were to be brought in line with the mandate of law.
20.

The record discloses that the action directed to be taken was not, even as per the

stand of the MCD itself taken later on. The only action taken appears to have been
sealing order which according to it was implemented on 14.11.2003, and a part demolition
CONT.CAS.445-04

12 OF 17

action, on 31-10-2003. The entirety of the submissions made and the averments in the
replies of the contemnor/accused abound with justification as to why further action could
not be taken after February, 2004. The date 16.2.2004 is significant because the occupier
Major Genl. Bakshi approached the Court, through WP 2144/04 on that date; the initial
interim order directing opening of seals was issued on 17.2.2004.
21.

The gap in point of time between 31.10.2003 and 17.2.2004 is significant.

Absolutely no explanation is forthcoming as to why no further action was taken and
whether indeed after the sealing took place on 14.11.2004, the occupier had occasion to
approach the MCD. This aspect assumes significance because the occupier also does not
state in his writ petition any specific date when he approached the MCD. The averments
in WP.2144/2004, particularly Paras 12 to 14 show that the sealing of the premises took
place rather suddenly, according to the occupier. However, there is no averment that the
writ petitioner/occupier ever approached the MCD which resulted in stalling of any
further action, pursuant to directions in WP 5422/03. The occupier merely averred that an
office order was issued on 3.2.2004, regarding the relaxed building bye-laws. This aspect
as stated earlier is significant because it shows that neither the respondent nor the
occupier can assert that no further action could be taken as a follow up including further
demolition action, since the stated position even now is that only a part demolition took
place on 31.10.2003. The argument that serious action ensued because of sealing, which
itself was sufficient to disclose compliance, has to be considered in the context. The MCD
CONT.CAS.445-04

13 OF 17

and the contemnor have not established that no follow up action after 14-11-2003 could
be taken due to consideration of any application or request for rectification of the plans.
22.

Another significant feature is that in answer to WP 2144/2004, the respondent-

contemnor Sh. Dahiya had filed an affidavit in April, 2004. That document is part of the
record in this case being ANNEXURE R-2. In answer to the writ petition of the occupier,
the contemnor/deponent merely disclosed compliance with the interim order dated
17.2.2004 regarding de-sealing of the premises to enable retrieval of documents and
submission of the rectification plan in accordance with the office order dated 3.2.2004.
He also stated than an amount of Rs.90,426/- was payable as compounding charges which
was communicated to the occupier on 29.3.2004. Here again what is significant is not
what was disclosed to the Court, but what was not disclosed to the Court.

The

respondent-contemnor, Shri Dahiya, is none other than the deponent who had filed an
affidavit in WP.5422/2003 on 27.9.2003; he made no whisper about the previous
proceedings or the directions of the Court dated 27.8.2003 and 1.10.2003. He also did not
take any steps to tell the court that the sealing of the premises was pursuant to, and in
compliance with this court's directions; he withheld this material fact from the court in
WP 2144/03 - the learned judge who heard that petition was different (Sen, J). On the
other hand, WP 5422/03 was heard and disposed off by Kaul, J. This non-disclosure
cannot be viewed in isolation in view of the identity of the deponent on behalf of the
MCD in both the proceedings. It betrays a willful and deliberate attempt to not disclose
CONT.CAS.445-04

14 OF 17

true and complete facts. In this context, the charge of complicity of the respondentdeponent to somehow keep the matter unresolved in an motivated manner, assumes
significance. If the intention of the contemnor respondent was in fact was to really
comply with the Court’s directions dated 1.10.2003, nothing prevented him from
approaching the Court in WP.5422/2003 and seeking extension of time or even
clarification, having regard to the writ petition No.2144/2004.

Nothing prevented him

also from disclosing the true facts in the affidavit filed before the Court, in WP 2144/04.
These in my considered opinion were deliberate attempts to suppress the facts, defeat the
ends of justice and overreach the binding directions of court.
23.

The mere charge of not proceeding further and taking demolition action, in

isolation, by itself was insufficient to conclude any willful motive or complicity by the
respondent deponent. However, no follow up action was taken or even attempted beyond
the period permitted by court. Admittedly, part demolition and the sealing of premises
took place. The further fact is that this Court was not appraised of the full facts by the
deponent in the subsequent proceedings, which led to the other consequences. I am
constrained to find that his conduct amounts to suppression of facts with a view to
disregard and disobey the orders of this Court. The suppression of material facts cannot be
viewed lightly, since the deponent accused is not a junior level official, who can be
forgiven of ignorance of the consequences; he is a senior officer, i.e Executive Engineer,
of the division, expected to be aware of the building bye laws, and consequences of
CONT.CAS.445-04

15 OF 17

placing or suppressing full facts before the court. His role in not disclosing the full facts,
in WP 2144/04 facilitated the removing of seals in the premises; those were directed to be
placed in WP 5422/03, by another learned judge. This suppression cannot but be regarded
as wilful, and deliberate, to keep the court in the dark about previous binding directions.
The deponent was duty bound to disclose to the court, as soon as he became aware of the
pendency of WP 2144/04, that the sealing was a step in the implementation of directions
dated 27-8-2003 and 1-10-2003 in WP 5422/03. His failure to do so, resulted in a virtual
negation of the mandate of this court, in the previous order, which had become final. His
bona fides would have been shown had he shown at the earliest opportunity that the
sealing of the concerned premises, was under directions of the court; this would have
afforded the court complete facts. The court had no manner of verifying these facts, since
the present petitioner had not been impleaded in the later proceedings, by the occupier/
owner. These establish that though the deponent contemnor acted seemingly within the
bounds of law, yet, he intentionally delayed further action, after 14-11-2003, though there
was no impediment, and suppressed true facts from this court, in the later proceedings - a
conduct which is not only deprecatory, but also in utter disregard of the courts previous
order.
24.

In view of the above discussion, I have no hesitation in concluding that the action

and conduct of the respondent Sh. Dahiya amounts to willful and deliberate disobedience
of the Court’s order with full intention and knowledge that they would undermine the
CONT.CAS.445-04

16 OF 17

authority of the Court. I, therefore, hold him guilty of contempt.

However, there is

nothing on the record to proceed against the first respondent. He is discharged.
25.

The Petition is accordingly allowed.
List on 28.5.2007 to hear the contemnor or his counsel, on the point of sentence.
