KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
The

present

appeal

is

preferred

by

the

appellant DTC against the award of the Motor Accident
Claims Tribunal dated 30.9.2004. By way of the present
appeal, the appellant DTC seeks to challenge the
impugned award mainly on the ground that there was no
involvement of the bus bearing registration no. DEP 9525
owned by the appellant in the accident.
The facts in nutshell are that on 9.8.96 at
about 10.30 P.M., Sh. Trilok Singh was travelling

in a

mini bus from Moti Gate to Burari Village. When the said
bus reached

near Jharoda Dairy, a DTC bus

bearing

registration no. DEP 9525 came from Burari side and
collided with the mini bus. As a result of forceful impact
in the accident Shri Trilok Singh sustained grevious
injuries and succumbed to his injuries the same day. The
claim petition was filed on 12.2.97 and award was made
by MACT on 30.9.2004. Aggrieved with the said award
MAC APP. No. 366-67/2005

page 2 of 8

present appeal is preferred by the appellant DTC.
Counsel for the appellant

contends that the

accident occurred at 10.30 P.M. on 9.8.96 and the
alleged bus of the appellant had entered the BBM Depot,
Outram Lane, near Kingsway Camp, Delhi at 9.45 P.M. In
support of his argument counsel for the appellant has
placed reliance on the

deposition of PW-1 Harkishan

Kumar who in his cross-examination has stated that as
per the record the bus in question was in Depot at 21.45
hours.
Counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on the
statement of Shri Dharampal, RW1, driver of the alleged
offending vehicle.

The said witness in deposition also

stated that he had taken the bus to BBM Depot at about
9.45 P.M. And he further stated that on 9.8.96 when he
was driving the bus, no such accident had occurred. He
also stated that after a gap of three months period, he
was arrested in the said case. Counsel for the appellant
MAC APP. No. 366-67/2005

page 3 of 8

has also placed reliance on the D.D. Entry to support his
argument that no vehicle was found at the spot after the
concerned I.O. visited the site of accident.
Counsel for the respondent on the other hand
contends that the appellant cannot dispute the factum
of the accident as the DD Entry was entered into by the
police at 10.50 P.M. in which the registration number of
the said offending vehicle was duly given.

Counsel

contends that the accident had occurred at 10.30 P.M.
On the said date and at 10.50 P.M. the first information
was given by the complainant to the police. Counsel for
the respondent further contends that on the basis of the
said D.D. Entry, Mr. Dharam Pal, driver of the offending
vehicle

was arrested. Counsel also states that on his

deposition Mr. Dharampal did not dispute his arrest by
the police and the seizure of the said offending vehicle.
Counsel for the respondent has invited my attention to
page no.17 of the impugned award to contend that the
MAC APP. No. 366-67/2005

page 4 of 8

appellant had recommended

departmental enquiry

against the said driver of the offending bus . Counsel for
the respondent further contends that the appellant did
not place on record

in/out register which is maintained

by the DTC to record the entry and exit of the DTC buses
from the Depot and in the absence of the same, the
Tribunal has rightly drawn adverse inference against the
appellant and has correctly held the involvement of the
said vehicle of the appellant in the said accident.
I

have

heard

counsel

for

the

parties

at

considerable length.
The best evidence to establish
the

the fact that

bus had entered the BBM Depot at 9.45 P.M. on

9.8.96, was the In/Out register which is maintained at
the DTC Depot, but the same was not produced by the
appellant

for the reasons best know to the appellant

itself. The statement of Krishan Kumar was deferred on
22.10.2001 only on account of the fact that the requisite
MAC APP. No. 366-67/2005

page 5 of 8

document stated to be filed by the appellant was not on
record. When the said witness was recalled for further
examination,

he duly

admitted

that record of the

vehicle involved in question is duly maintained. He also
stated that he can say as to when the said bus entered
the Depot only after seeing the records.
been explained by the appellant

Nothing has

as to why the said

record which was vital and must relevant was withheld
by the appellant. Although, it is not expected that a DTC
bus after finishing the duty and entering the Depot would
again go out, yet the entry of the said DTC bus into the
Depot at 9.45 hours and the timing of the accident at
10.30 P.M., one cannot rule out the possibility of the bus
being there as the distance between the Bus Depot and
the place of accident is not a long distance. This is also
not disputed that the driver of the offending vehicle was
arrested and the bus in question was also impounded. It
is also not disputed that the first D.D.Entry was recorded
MAC APP. No. 366-67/2005

page 6 of 8

at 10.50 P.M. on the date of the accident in which
categorically the registration of the offending

bus was

duly mentioned. The appellant had also not summoned
the I.O. and has also not produced the records of the
D.D. Entry and therefore, in the absence of all these the
plea taken by the appellant in the present appeal does
not inspire any confidence.
There is no merit in the appeal.
Dismissed.
Vide order dated 29.4.2005, the appellant was
directed to deposit the entire award amount within a
period of four weeks and stay was granted to the extent
of 50%

of the awarded amount and balance 50% was

directed to be released in favour of the respondents.
Counsel for the appellant states that

entire

amount in compliance with the directions of this Court
was deposited. Counsel for the respondents states that
50% of the amount has already been released in favour
MAC APP. No. 366-67/2005

page 7 of 8

of the respondents.

Let

the remaining amount be

released in favour of the respondents by the Tribunal.
The appellant is directed to pay interest on 50% of the
balance amount from the date of the filing of the appeal
till its final realisation.

The said amount shall be

deposited by the appellant before the Tribunal. Counsel
for the appellant submits that the amount of Rs.25,000/as deposited by the appellant with the Registrar General
of this Court towards statutory deposit be released in
favour of the appellant.
Let amount of Rs.25,000/- be released in favour
of the appellant.
With these directions, appeal stands disposed
of.
