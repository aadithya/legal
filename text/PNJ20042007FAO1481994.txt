PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

On 8.3.1987, Shiv Dayal aged 29 years died in an

accident involving truck bearing no.DIL-3116. He was survived by
his wife, a minor daughter and parents.
2.

Dependents filed a claim petition under Section 140

read with Section 166 of the MV Act 1988 claiming compensation
in sum of Rs.11,28,000/- on account of the death of the deceased.
Mother of the deceased died during the pendency of the claim
petition.
3.

Vide award dated 29.3.2004, compensation in sum of

FAO.No.148/94

page 1 of 7

Rs.2,68,800/- has been awarded by the learned Tribunal.
4.

Aggrieved by the compensation awarded by the

Tribunal, dependents have filed the present appeal seeking
enhancement of compensation.
5.

Deceased was employed as a technician with M/s.

Maruti Udyog Ltd. when the accident in question took place.
6.

In order to prove the income of the deceased at the

time of the accident as also his futuristic income, salary certificate
(Ex. PW-1/2) issued by the employer of the deceased was placed
on record.
7.

S.K.Chatkara,

Assistant,

M/s.

Maruti

Udyog

Ltd.

stepped into the witness box as PW-1 and proved the said salary
certificate.

In his testimony, he reiterated the particulars

contained in the said salary certificate.

He deposed that the

deceased was drawing a salary of Rs.1,611/- per month at the
time of the accident.
8.

Brother of the deceased stepped into the witness box

as PW-7 and proved three certificates (Ex.PW-7/A, Ex.PW-7/B &
Ex.PW-7/C) issued by the employer of the deceased wherein
deceased was congratulated by his employer for the excellent
work done by him.
9.

Taking note of the testimony of S.K.Chatkara, PW-1,

Tribunal has taken income of the deceased at the time of the

FAO.No.148/94

page 2 of 7

accident as Rs.1,611/- per month (rounded of to Rs.1,600/- per
month).

No deduction has been made for personal spending of

the deceased. Multiplier of 14 has been adopted by the Tribunal.
Thus, total loss of dependence has been determined by Tribunal
as Rs.2,68,800/-.
10.

Learned counsel for the appellant has urged two

grounds in support of his contention that compensation awarded is
inadequate. First, that while determining monthly income of the
deceased, Tribunal has not correctly appreciated salary certificate
Ex.PW-1/2. Second, that the Tribunal erred in not giving benefit of
futuristic income of the deceased while determining loss of
dependence. Counsel contended that salary certificate, Ex.PW-1/2
shows the prospects of future increase in the income of the
deceased.
11.

In order to properly appreciate arguments advanced

by the learned counsel for the appellant, it is pertinent to note
salary certificate Ex.PW-1/2. The same reads as under:“As required by the Court, the details of Late Sh.
S.D.Sharma, Staff No.105953, an ex-Technician

Other benefits

:

i) PF as per Employees

ii) Gratuity as per

iii)L.T.C.

A foot note appended to the certificate reads as under

:-

13.

“It will however not be possible to project the
earnings of the employees beyond 1991 since
we have wage Revisions periodically & the
employee would have been promoted as well.”
Salary certificate records that besides salary,

deceased was also entitled to get provident fund, gratuity. These
benefits would have accrued to the estate of the deceased. Had
the deceased lived his full life and retired in the year 2016, then,
he would have drawn his gratuity and provident fund benefit
whereof would have gone to the family.
14.

On the issue of future prospects, I note the judgment

of the Supreme Court in the decision reported as Bijoy Kumar
Dugar Vs. Bidyadhar Dutta & Ors. AIR 2006 SC 1255. In the para
8 of the report, Supreme Court urged as under:-

FAO.No.148/94

page 4 of 7

15.

“The mere assertion of the claimants that the
deceased would have earned more than
Rs.8,000/- to Rs.10,000/- per month in the span
of his lifetime cannot be accepted as legitimate
income unless all the relevant facts are proved
by leading cogent and reliable evidence before
the MACT. Claimants had to prove that the
deceased was in a trade where he would have
earned more from time to time or that he had
special merits or qualifications or opportunities
which would have led to an improvement in his
income.”
Thus, prospect of future increase in the income of the

deceased has to be granted when there is evidence showing the
same.
16.

In the instant case, salary certificate (Ex.PW-1/2) as

also certificates of excellence issued by the employer of the
deceased (Ex.PW-7/A to Ex.PW-7/C) clearly show the prospects of
future increase in the income of the deceased. Thus, the same
needs to be considered and granted.
17.

A perusal of the salary certificate further shows that

had deceased been alive, his salary would have risen by 40% in
just 4 years.
18.

Deceased had 29 years of service left at the time of

his death in the said road accident.
19.

Taking note of the fact that apart from monthly wages

a deferred income in the form of gratuity and provident fund
would have flown to the deceased, I treat his monthly income at
Rs.1700/- when he died.

FAO.No.148/94

page 5 of 7

20.

Taking note of the considerable increase in the salary

of the deceased in 4 years, the young age of the deceased and
the fact that the deceased was a highly skilled technician as
evident from certificates of excellence issued by the employer of
the deceased, it could reasonably be expected that his salary
would have gone up

by at least 4 times by the time he would

have left gainful employment. Thus, I take mean average monthly
income of the deceased as Rs.4,250/- (Rs.1,700/- + Rs.6,800 (4
times increase in salary) ÷ 2 = Rs.4,250/-).
21.

Deducting 1/3rd towards personal spending of the

deceased, average loss of dependence comes to Rs.2,833/-.
Applying multiplier of 14, total loss of dependence comes to
Rs.5,09,940/- (Rs.2,833 x 12 x 14 = Rs.4,75,944/-).
22.

Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.2,68,800/- for loss of

dependence.

Thus, compensation for loss of dependence is

enhanced by a further sum of Rs.2,07,144/-.
23.

Noting that Tribunal has awarded no sum under the

head 'non pecuniary damages', I award a sum of Rs.10,000/under the said head.
24.

Net effect is that compensation stands enhanced by a

further sum of Rs.2,17,144/-.
25.
