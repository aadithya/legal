ORDER
28.03.2008

The petitioner is owner of property B1/7, Safdarjung Enclave, New

Delhi-29 and is assessed to property tax under the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as Act). The rateable value of
the said property was enhanced to Rs.2,24,950/- vide assessment order
dated 29.9.97. There is no dispute about the said assessments and the
rateable value fixed vide order dated 29.9.1997.

2.

On 30th March, 1999 MCD issued notice under section 126 of the Act for

enhancement of the rateable value to Rs.5,10,000/- w.e.f 1/4/1998 due to
increase in rent. Thereafter the assessment order was passed enhancing the
rateable value to Rs.5,10,000/- w.e.f 1.4.1998 and to Rs.4,62,610/- w.e.f.
12.3.2000.
3.

The petitioner deposited Rs.1,67,102/- on 16.5.2002 and filed an appeal

challenging the enhanced rateable value. The appeal was allowed on the
short ground that notice under section 126 dated 30.3.1999 was served upon
the assesee on 3.4.1999 i.e. after the end of financial year 1998-99. It is the
case of the petitioner that no appeal was filed against the said order dated
11.7.2002 passed by the Additional District Judge and the said order has
become final and binding. I may note here that the Additional District Judge
while passing the said order had directed for refund of the tax amount
deposited by the assessee. It is accordingly directed that the petitioner will be
entitled to refund of the deposited amount for the financial year 1.4.1998 till
31.3.1999 and he will be charged property tax on the basis of earlier rateable
value of Rs.2,24,950/-. The extra tax paid by the petitioner will be refunded to
him in terms of the order passed by the Additional District Judge on 1.7.2002.
4.

The respondent/MCD had issued another notice dated 27.3.2000 under

section 126 of the Act enhancing the rateable value from Rs.2,24,950/- /

Rs.5,10,000/- to Rs.6,12,000/- w.e.f. 1.4.1999. This notice for enhancement
was issued on account of increase in rent. The petitioner filed objections to
the proposal stating inter alia that the notice was not served on or before
31.3.2000 and therefore enhancement of rateable value cannot be effective
for the financial year 1999-2000. Similarly, contention was again raised before
the Assessing Officer that notice for enhancement dated 27.3.2000 was
received on 1.4.2000, and therefore, it is invalid and cannot be effective for
financial year 1999 â€“ 2000, as per proviso to section 126 of the Act.
5.

The

Assessing

Officer,

however,

fixed

the

rateable

value

at

Rs.5,18,710/- w.e.f. 1.4.1999 and Rs.4,62,610/- w.e.f. 12.3.2000. For the
period 1.4.2001 the rateable value was fixed by a separate assessment order.
6.

The petitioner filed an appeal against the said assessment order before

the Additional District Judge. The Additional District Judge held that the notice
under section 126 was dispatched on 30.3.2000 and therefore the said notice
was valid. However, he remanded the case back to the Assessing Officer for
the determination of rateable value in accordance with law after giving
opportunity of hearing to the assessee.
7.

Not satisfied, the petitioner filed a writ petition before this court

questioning and challenging order dated 21.1.2003 passed by the Additional
District Judge as well as assessment order dated 2.9.2002 fixing rateable
value at Rs.5,18,710/- w.e.f. 1.4.1999 and Rs.4,62,610/- w.e.f. 12.3.2000.

This W.P.(C) No.4056/2003 was allowed following the judgment of High Court
in the case of 'Dharam Properties Vs. MCD' reported in (2005) JAD (Delhi) 21.
It was held that the notice under section 126(1) should have been served
within the financial year, itself and in the present case notice was dispatched
on 30th March 2000 and was received after the financial year on 1.4.2000 and
therefore, no enhanced assessment could have been made for the period
ending 31.3.2000. This order was passed on 7.4.2005 and has not been
challenged by MCD. Accordingly, the said order has attained finality. In view
of the above order, the petitioner is also entitled to refund of the additional tax
paid by him for the period ending 31.3.2000 on the basis of rateable value
fixed by the Assessor and Collector by his order dated 2.9.2002. However,
w.e.f. 1.4.2000 the petitioner shall be liable to pay property tax in accordance
with law. Rateable value for the said period will have to be fixed in terms of
order dated 21.01.2003 passed by the Additional District Judge in appeal.
8.

Order dated 7.4.2005 passed by this court in W.P.(C) No.4056/2003 in

the operative portion reads as under :
"6. In my considered view, having regard to the facts of this
case, the petitioner is entitled to relief. The ruling in Dharma
Properties, squarely covers the facts of the present case. The
notice in question was received on 1.4.2000; it sought to revise
the rateable value for the period effective from 1.4.1999. It was
beyond the period prescribed.
7.
The writ petition is accordingly allowed. An appropriate
direction is issued quashing the impugned order of the appellate

authority dated 1st January, 2003, as also the order of the
respondent assessing the property of the petitioner dated
2.9.2002. The pending interlocutory application is also disposed
off in the light of this judgment. No costs."
9.

The operative portion of order dated 7th April, 2005 is to be read along

with the contention raised by the petitioner and the findings by the court in the
said writ petition. The contention raised by the petitioner was that notice under
section 126 of the Act was served after 31.3.2000 and therefore revised or
enhanced tax for the period ending 31.3.2000 cannot be charged. It was not
the contention of the petitioner that rateable value cannot be increased or
enhanced tax cannot be charged after 1.4.2000. This is the limited effect of
the direction issued vide order dated 7th April 2005. I may note here that even
in the objections raised before the Assessing Officer the petitioner had
contended that no notice in terms of section 126(1) of the Act was not served
on or before 31.3.2000 and therefore the notice in question was not effective
for the financial year 1999-2000. It was not the contention of the petitioner that
the said notice was invalid for the year 1.4.2000 onwards. In view of the above
it is directed as under :(1) The petitioner is entitled to refund of additional tax paid by him for the
financial year 1.4.1998 to 31.3.1999 and 1.4.1999 to 31.3.2000 and for the
said years rateable value will be treated as Rs.2,24,950/-. This direction is
being issued as order dated 11.7.2000 passed by the Additional District Judge

and order passed by this court in W.P.(C) No.4056/2003 on 7th April, 2005
have become final and binding on the MCD and no appeal has been filed
against the said orders.
(2) For the period after 1.4.2000 MCD will pass a fresh order in terms of order
dated 21.1.2003 passed by the THE ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE
remanding the case back to the assessing officer for re-computation of the
rateable value after affording opportunity of hearing to the assesee. The
petitioner will appear before the Assessing Officer on 21st April, 2008 at 3.30
p.m. for complying with order dated 21.01.2003. It is however, clarified that
the said assessment order will be valid for the period on or after 1st April,
2000. It is also clarified that this order shall not effect any other notice for
enhancement or increase in rateable value.
The writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
