PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

Heard.

2.

A short issue arises for consideration. The merits of the

order passed by the Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation is not
in issue. The only issue which arises for consideration is the effect of
Rs.One lac paid by the employer to the heirs of the deceased
workman.
3.

Charan Singh was employed with Marine Carriers Pvt.

Ltd. He was a driver. Vehicle bearing No.MH-06-K-0453 belonging to
the employer was entrusted to him for being driven. The employer
Page 1 of 5

had obtained an insurance cover for the vehicle in question.

The

policy of insurance covered the risk of injury or death to the driver of
the vehicle in question.
4.

Unfortunately, while driving the vehicle Charan Singh

met an untimely death. His wife and children claimed compensation
under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923.
5.

Immediately after the death of the workman on 10th

March 2005 the employer gave Rs.one lac to the widow under cover
of a letter which reads as under :“March 10, 2005
To,
Mrs. Ramkali Devi Charan Singh,
Village Admimal K Pura,
Post Mahua (Porsa),
Dist. Morena (M.P.)
Sub: Confirmation
Rs.1,00,000/-

of

Demand

Draft

of

This is to request you to kindly confirm to us that
you have received a Demand Draft No.227000
Dated 4th February, 2005 drawn on State Bank of
Indore for Rs.1,00,000/- sent by us.
Further, please note that we have given this
amount as goodwill of the company for the
services your husband put in with us. This does
not in any way admit any liability on our part nor
construe as such and is also not any advance
towards any compensation for which you may or
may not see other avenues.
Thank You,
Yours truly,
For MARINE CARRIERS PVT. LTD.
sd/Pradeed Dhyani
Asst. Manager.”

It is urged by learned counsel for the appellant that

under the circumstances Rs.one lac has to be deducted from the
amount payable as this amount has been received by the
dependents.
7.

Learned counsel refers to various decisions latest being

the decision of the Himachal Pradesh High Court reported as II
(2007) ACC 770 Puran Dutt Vs. HRTC. The said authority has noted
certain earlier decisions on the point.
8.

The Himachal Pradesh High Court was concerned with a

similar issue where the workman who had been disabled had
received an ex gratia payment from the employer. This amount was
held liable to be adjusted from the sum awarded by the
Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation on the ground that the exgratia payments were not made towards medical reimbursements.
That they were in the nature of compensation.
9.

Letter dated 10.3.2005 written by the Marine Carriers

Pvt. Ltd. while tendering Rs. One lac to the widow of the deceased
clearly records that the said amount was given as goodwill of the
company for services of her husband and was not to be treated as
an admission of liability.

Meaning thereby the payment was not

tendered towards compensation payable to the legal heirs of the
deceased.
10.

Section 8(1) of the Workmen Compensation Act, 1923

reads as under:-

Page 3 of 5

“8. Distribution of compensation- (1) No payment of
compensation in respect of a workman whose injury has
resulted in death, and no payment of a lump sum as
compensation to a woman or a person under a legal
disability, shall be made otherwise than by deposit with
the Commissioner, and no such payment made directly by
an employer shall be deemed to be a payment of
compensation:
Provided that, in the case of a deceased workman, an
employer may make to any dependant advances on
account of compensation not exceeding an aggregate of
one hundred rupees, and so much of such aggregate as
does not exceed the compensation payable to that
dependant shall be deducted by the Commissioner from
such compensation and repaid to the employer.”
11.

From a reading of proviso to Section 8(1) it is clear that

only the amount which has been paid by the employer to the
dependents of the deceased workmen as an advance on account of
compensation

can

be

deducted

from

the

amount

of

total

compensation and not any other amount which has been paid by
the employer under any other head.
12.

The issue can also be looked at very simply in law. Right

to receive compensation accrues to the dependents of deceased
workman in their own right as per the statute. The employer of the
deceased workman can, to mitigate their sorrows, pay to them some
money as compensation. This payment would be to the dependents
in furtherance of their right to receive compensation. Nomenclature
of this payment is not material. It may be called ex-gratia. It may be
called payment without prejudice. It hardly matters. But at the same
time nothing prevents the employer to, by way of gratitude for the
services rendered by the employee, pay money for said services

Page 4 of 5

rendered.

Of course, this money would be tendered to the

dependents but would not be in lieu of or partly in right to receive
the statutory compensation.
13.

Under the circumstances I hold that Rs. one lac paid by

the employer under cover of letter dated 10.3.2005 cannot be
appropriated towards compensation payable to the legal heirs of the
deceased workman.
14.

Before

concluding

I

may

note

that

Workmen's

Compensation Act is a beneficial legislation and has to be construed
liberally in favour of the claimants.
15.

No costs.
