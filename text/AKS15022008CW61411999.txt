1. The petitioner, Sh. Deo Prakash, had filed this writ petition
claiming pro-rata retirement benefits, pension and gratuity
on the basis of his service in the Air Force and thereafter
consequent absorption in Rourkela Steel Plant, a Public
Sector Undertaking (hereinafter referred to as PSU). The
petitioner died during the pendency of these proceedings

and his widow Smt. Ramkali Devi was substituted in his
place by this Court vide orders dated 24.2.2004. She has
pursued the petition thereafter.

2. The case of the petitioner is based on the following facts,
which may first be recapitulated:

3. Sh. Deo Prakash (hereinafter referred to as the deceased)
was appointed as Temporary Routine Grade Clerk by the
Controller of Accounts, Air Force, on 19.6.1942. In 1944
he was promoted as typing clerk and on 1.7.1949 an order
was passed absorbing him as quasi permanent. Thereafter,
he was promoted as Assistant Accountant with effect from
17.7.1953. When he was working in this capacity with the
Air Force, he was sent on deputation in public interest to
Rourkela Steel Plant (a unit of Steel Authority of India
Limited) on 23.11.1957. While working on deputation
there, he was permanently absorbed in the said Steel Plant
with effect from 15.12.1961 after he resigned from the
Controller Defence Account, Air Force.

In the said Steel

Plant he worked upto March 1976 whereafter he left that
job as well exercising his option for retirement under the
Voluntary Retirement Scheme.

4. Vide OM dated 16.6.1967, the Government of India,
Ministry of Finance, Department of Expenditure, came out
with a scheme as per which permanent government
servants were entitled to payment of pro-rata retirement
benefits on absorption in PSUs in public interest.

This

scheme was, however, made applicable in respect of those
government servants who were absorbed in PSUs on or
after the date of said office memo i.e. 16.6.1967. This cut
off date was challenged by some employees and the matter
went upto Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court declared

the fixation of date of 16.6.1967 as arbitrary and directed
the Government of India to grant pro-rata pension and
other benefits to even those government servants who
were absorbed in the PSUs prior to 16.6.1967. After this
judgment was rendered on 17.2.1993 by the Apex Court
which is reported as T.S. Thiruvengadam v. Secretary

to Government of India – (1993) 2 SCC 174, accepting
the mandate of that judgment, office memo dated 3.1.1995
was issued by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances
and Pensions, Department of Pension and Pensioners'
Welfare, Government of India, extending the benefit of OM
dated 16.6.1967 to all the Central Government employees
who were absorbed in the Central PSUs prior to 16.6.1967
as well, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions specified
WP (C) No. 6141/1999

Page 3 of 12

therein.

5. The deceased in the writ petition alleged that he came to
know of this circular some time in November, 1997 from a
colleague of his and thereafter made representation on
21.11.1997 to the respondents (CDA) as well as Managing
Director for payment of pro-rata pension. It was followed
by reminder dated 15.1.1998.

The deceased was asked to

supply certain documents and information from Rourkela
Steel Plant. Deceased, thus, requested the Assistant
Manager, Rourkela Steel Plant to supply the Service Book
P. II Office Order absorbing the deceased permanently and
other relevant record to the office of Chief Controller of
Accounts so that pro-rata retirement benefits could be
released to him.

Various reminders were also sent.

Ultimately, on 27.11.1998 Rourkela Steel Plant sent the
requisite information to Chief Controller of Accounts
(Factories).

However, thereafter, on 18.12.1998 the

deceased received a letter from the office of the CDA
stating that at this belated stage it was not possible for the
office to furnish any document pertaining to service period
of the deceased with CDA (A.F.) Dehradun from 13.6.1942
to August 1954. The deceased again pursued the matter
with

the

respondents

WP (C) No. 6141/1999

unsuccessfully.

Ultimately

on

Page 4 of 12

16.8.1999 Delhi office of CDA informed that the service
record of the deceased could not be traced. At that point
of time this writ petition was filed by the deceased with the
following prayers:
“A) Issue a writ of mandamus or any
other appropriate writ directing the
respondents to grant pro-rata retirement
benefits,
pension
and
gratuity
consequent on permanent absorption in
PSU/Rourkela Steel Plant.
B) Direct the respondents to release all
the consequential benefits as per the
Notification issued by the Govt. of India,
Ministry of Public Grievances & Pension,
Deptt. of Pension & Pensioners' welfare
O.M. No. 4(6)/85-P & PW(D) dated
3.1.95 circulated by C.G.D.A. New Delhi
under
their
No.
AT/V/DAD/Pen/15001/Vol.IVL
dated
6.2.95.
C) Further issue an appropriate writ or
direction directing the respondents to
comply with the Notification dated 3rd
January 1995 on the basis of documents
submitted by the petitioner and in view
of the Supreme Court Judgment release
the benefits and all arrears of pension
with 18% interest there-upon till the
date of realization
AND
pass such other & further order as this
Honourable Court may deem fit and
proper in the circumstances of the
present case.”
6. It is clear from the aforesaid factual matrix, the main

WP (C) No. 6141/1999

Page 5 of 12

reason for denial of the pro-rata pension to the deceased is
that his service record is not available with CDA (A.F.)
Dehradun and in the absence of said record case of the
deceased could not be processed.

Otherwise, if the

deceased had worked with the CDA during the aforesaid
period, it cannot be denied that as per OM dated 16.6.1967
read with OM dated 3.1.1995 the deceased would be
entitled to pro-rata pension.

Reading of OM dated

16.6.1967 read with OM dated 3.1.1995 would indicate
that following conditions are to be fulfilled for grant of prorata pension:
a)

The officer had rendered not less than 10 years

service under Government and was not entitled to pension.
b)

He was absorbed to a Central PSU in public

interest.
c)
benefits

The absorbee should have received the retirement
as

per

Ministry

of

Finance,

Department

of

Expenditure, O.M. Dated 10.11.1960 namely an amount equal
to what Government would have contributed had the officer
been

on

Contributory

Provident

Fund

terms

under

Government, together with simple interest thereon at 2% for
the period of his pensionable service under the Government,
should have been credited to his Contributory Provident Fund
Account with the PSU as an opening balance within one year
WP (C) No. 6141/1999

Page 6 of 12

from the date of his/her permanent absorption.

7. In so far as last condition is concerned, it could not have
been fulfilled at the relevant time as the OM was initially
made applicable only to those employees who got absorbed
on or after 16.6.1967. It is only in the year 1995 that after
the judgment of the Supreme Court, the scheme of grant of
pro-rata pension was made applicable to the employees
who left the Government job in Central PSU in public
interest even before 16.6.1967.

8. We may also note at this stage that in the counter affidavit
filed on behalf of the respondents 1, 2, 3 & 5, these
respondents have primarily taken the ground that the
record of the deceased is not available with the CDA (A.F.)
Dehradun and in the absence of record the Government
could not verify the claim of the deceased and further that
he was fulfilling the conditions laid in OM dated 16.6.1967.
It is also stated that the deceased had not been able to
intimate the quantum of terminal benefits received by him
from Defence Accounts Department on his permanent
absorption.

9. The respondents have also annexed extract from office
WP (C) No. 6141/1999

Page 7 of 12

manual Part-II, Vo. I and para 61 read with Annexure A
which relates to preservation and destruction or disposal of
records mentions that in so far as service books are
concerned that would be retained for a period of 10 years
after death or 5 years after retirement or 5 years from the
date of final settlement of terminal benefits for those
individuals who resign or are retrenched, removed or are
dismissed. Thus, if the records were destroyed, the service
book of the deceased was destroyed under the aforesaid
provision, it cannot be said that there was any wrong by
the respondents. No doubt in matter of pensions ordinarily
the claims cannot be denied on the ground of delay. That
may only restrict the actual payment of arrears by denying
the payment of arrears for past period.

However, the

position would be different in case the claim cannot be
entertained at all in the absence of necessary documents.

10.In a recent judgment pronounced on 28.1.2008 in WP(C)
No.1595/2007 entitled “Shashi Bala vs. Union of India and
Another”, this Court had the occasion to discuss the aspect
in some detail and the relevant discussion is in the
following passages:-

“4. The
question
that
falls
for
consideration is as to what should be the
WP (C) No. 6141/1999

Page 8 of 12

approach of the Court in cases where
pension is claimed even when such a claim
is preferred belatedly. No doubt, claim of
pension is a continuing cause of action and
if an individual is found entitled to the said
claim, it should not be denied merely
because
he
approached
the
Court
belatedly. If the claim is found to be
legitimately proved, the relief can be
moulded by depriving the petitioner from
getting arrears of past period and limit it
from the date three years prior to the filing
of the petition.
5.
A Division Bench of this Court in the
case of Ajaib Kaur & Ors. v. Union of
India & Ors., 2002 (64) DRJ 132, while
holding that normally plea of laches in such
pension matters is not to be entertained,
but in the fact situation of a particular case
such plea can be accepted and on that
ground prayer for claiming pension would
be rejected.
6.
A recent judgment of the Supreme
Court, in fact, enlightens us on this issue as
it lays down the principle of law on the
question of delay and laches in a claim for
disability pension in lucid terms.
The
judgment in question is Shiv Dass v.
Union of India & Ors., 2007 (2) SCT 72.
The Apex Court in that case restated the
approach which the High Court is to adopt
in case of belated petitions. Para 5 of the
said judgment may be quoted in this behalf
:“5. Normally, in case of belated
approach writ petition has to be
dismissed. Delay or laches is one of
the factors to be borne in mind by the
High Court when they exercise their
discretionary powers under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, 1950
(in short the 'Constitution'). In an
appropriate case the High Court may
refuse to invoke its extraordinary
WP (C) No. 6141/1999

Page 9 of 12

powers if there is such negligence or
omission on the part of the applicant
to assert his right as taken in
conjunction with the lapse of time
and other circumstances, causes
prejudice to the opposite party. Even
where fundamental right is involved
the matter is still within the
discretion of the Court as pointed out
in
Durga
Prasad
v.
Chief
Controller of Imports and Exports
and Ors. (AIR 1970 SC 769). Of
course, the discretion has to be
exercised judicially and reasonably.”
In para 6 & 7, reference is made to
various other judgments in support of the
aforesaid proposition. It is also observed
that such belated petitions are not to be
entertained as it is likely to cause
confusion and public inconvenience and
bring in its train new injustices and if writ
jurisdiction is exercised after unreasonable
delay, it may have the effect of inflicting
not only hardship and inconvenience but
also injustice on third parties. The Court
also pointed out that mere making of
representations would not be adequate
explanation to take care of delay. After
stating the law in these general terms, in
respect of pension cases the Supreme
Court laid down the following approach :“9. In the case of pension the cause
of action actually continues from
month to month.
That, however,
cannot be a ground to overlook delay
in filing the petition. It would depend
upon the fact of each case. If petition
is filed beyond a reasonable period
say three years normally the Court
would reject the same or restrict the
relief which could be granted to a
reasonable period of about three
years.
The High Court did not
examine whether on merit appellant
had a case. If on merits it would
WP (C) No. 6141/1999

Page 10 of 12

have found that there was no scope
for interference, it would have
dismissed the writ petition on that
score alone.”
It is clear from the above that each
case has to be dealt with on its own merits.
No doubt, if the claim is well founded it is
not to be rejected merely on the ground of
delay. However, if delay prejudices the
other side, it becomes relevant factor to
dismiss the petition.”
11.In the present case, no doubt, the deceased has filed along
with his petition typed copy of his recruitment letter dated
19.6.1942.

He

has

also

filed

photostat

copy

of

intersectional transfer order dated 23.7.1954 whereby he
was transferred from Stores to C(Pay).

This would show

that deceased was in service from 1942 to 1954. However
that by itself was not sufficient to enable the deceased to
get the pro-rata pension as other conditions mentioned
above are also to be satisfied.

In the absence of record,

one is not in a position to find out whether those conditions
are satisfied namely whether the deceased was absorbed in
Central PSU in public interest and what quantum of
terminal benefits were received from Defence Accounts
Department on his permanent absorption as in the absence
of this information his case could not have been finalised.

WP (C) No. 6141/1999

12.We, therefore, are unable to grant any relief to the
petitioner. This petition is accordingly dismissed.
