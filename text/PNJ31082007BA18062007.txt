U/S 302/307/34 IPC
P.S. Model Town
Petitioner, Vivek Sharma is an accused in the afore-

noted FIR. He seeks bail.
2.

FIR has been registered on information provided by

Ajit Kumar who has been examined ass PW-5.

As per the FIR,

the complainant Ajit Kumar along with his friends Dhananjay
Tiwari, Shiv Kumar Sharma and Siddharth Motwani had left

B.A.No.1806/2007

page 1 of 9

house No.B-88, Gujranwala Town, New Delhi at about 1.10 A.M.
in a car (Indica Make) bearing No.DL-3C-AF-3348. When they
reached

gate No.1

in the colony, two persons in another

Indica car bearing No.DL-8C-J-5562 were seen by them at the
gate. They were having an altercation with Rohit Kumar, the
guard at the

gate.

As per the complainant, when the

complainant and his friends intervened to pacify, the said two
persons snatched the lathi from the guard and attacked them.
One of the two inflicted a lathi blow on Dhananjay Tiwari and
the another inflicted a knife blow on Dhananjay.

Thereafter,

the person with the knife gave blows to Shiv Kumar Sharma
and fled.

Dhananjay and Shiv Kumar Sharma were taken to

Pentamed Hospital.

Leaving the deceased and the injured

along with Siddharth Motwani at the hospital, complainant
went back to the house at Gujranwala Town and saw that two
men had returned to re-possess car No.DL-8CJ-5562.

Both

were taken into custody at the spot.
3.

At the outset it may be noted that aforesaid facts

leading upto the arrest of the accused persons forms part of
the FIR itself.
4.

The two assailants were stated to be Rajesh Chugh

and Vivek Sharma, the petitioner.
5.

Of the three stated friends of the deceased who

B.A.No.1806/2007

page 2 of 9

were alleged to be with the deceased in the car when the
attack took place, PW-1 Shiv Kumar Sharma has not supported
the case of the prosecution.
neither petitioner nor

He categorically

Rajesh Chugh

stated that

were the persons who

had attacked him and Dhananjay with a knife and a lathi.

In

his statement, Shiv Kumar Sharma examined as PW-1 stated
that when he along with the deceased and Siddharth Motwani
were leaving the colony they saw some people fighting at the
gate.

They had to stop the car. Somebody inflicted danda

blow on the car. He and Dhananjay Tiwari came out of the car.
Two persons attacked them and fled. He categorically stated
that the accused persons were not the ones who had inflicted
blows on him or the deceased.
6.

The watchman at the gate Rohit was examined as

PW-3. He stated that he was on duty at the gate in question at
mid night.

Two cars, one blue coloured Maruti Zen and the

other a silver coloured Indica came racing down, each tried to
over take the other. Both cars were attempting to go out of
the gate before the other. The cars stopped at the gate. The
passengers in the cars started quarreling. Somebody snatched
his danda and inflicted blows.

He denied that the accused

persons were involved in the fight.
7.

Ajit Kumar, the complainant was examined as PW-5.

B.A.No.1806/2007

page 3 of 9

He stated in harmony with his statement recorded in the FIR
that he along with the deceased Dhananjay Tiwari, Shiv Kumar
Sharma

and Siddharth Motwani left in the Indica car from

house No.B-88, Gujranwala Town, New Delhi at about 1.10 AM.
When the car neared

the gate they saw some people

quarreling with the guard. Dhananjay Tiwari was driving the
car.

Siddharth Motwani was sitting on the front seat.

They

enquired from the boys as to why were they fighting with the
guard. One boy snatched the lathi from the guard and hit the
car.

Thereafter,

one boy took out a knife and stabbed

Dhananjay Tiwari.

When Shiv Kumar Sharma went to rescue

Dhananjay Tiwari, even Shiv Kumar Sharma was attacked with
the knife.

Thereafter, both assailants ran away.

He stated

that after the deceased and Shiv Kumar Sharma were left at
Pentamed Hospital, he returned to Gujranwala Town and found
that the two assailants had been apprehended at site by the
police.

He stated that the police made enquiries from him

about the incident and he narrated the incident to the police.
On being questioned whether the accused persons who were
present in court were the assailants, PW-5 stated that he was
not sure whether the petitioner and the co-accused were the
assailants.
8.

It is thus urged by learned counsel for the petitioner

B.A.No.1806/2007

page 4 of 9

that the case of the prosecution has faltered inasmuch as
three of the star witnesses of the prosecution have not
supported the case of the prosecution.
9.

Only witness of the prosecution who appears to

have supported the case of the prosecution is Siddharth
Motwani examined as PW-1.

He has deposed in favour of the

prosecution and has stated a version which is in harmony with
the FIR.
10.

But, learned

counsel for the petitioner has drawn

attention of this court to certain parts of testimony

of

Siddharth Motwani wherefrom a doubt is sought to be created
on the presence of Siddharth Motwani as also the version of
the prosecution pertaining to the involvement of the petitioner
and the friends of the petitioner.
11.

Before I deal with the testimony of Siddharth

Motwani, it would be interesting to note that MLC of the
deceased records that he was brought to the hospital by one
Ravi Srivastava.
Siddharth Motwani

No witness of the prosecution including
have referred to the presence of Ravi

Srivastava. It remains unexplained as to who that Ravi was.
Obviously, a person named Ravi Srivastava had taken the
deceased to the hospital.
12.

Surprisingly, the prosecution has

B.A.No.1806/2007

not tried to

page 5 of 9

contact him much less cited him as a witness of the
prosecution.
13.

In his testimony, Siddharth Motwani has stated that

he remained in the hospital with the deceased and Shiv Kumar
Sharma and that his statement was recorded by the police at
Pentamed Hospital.

He stated that his statement was so

recorded at the hospital some times after 3 AM.

If this is

true, Siddharth Motwani remained at Pentamed Hospital till 3
AM.

But, it is an admitted fact, a fact also admitted by

Siddharth Motwani

(on being cross-examined) that he along

with one Manoj were apprehended by the police at gate No.1
of Gujranwala Town after about 1 to 2 hours of the incident.
14.

Learned counsel for the State concedes that the

police personnel in a PCR van had apprehended Siddharth
Motwani at another gate of the colony at around 2.30 AM.
15.

It remains a mystery as to what Siddharth Motwani

was doing at another gate of the colony at around 2.30 AM.
16.

One of his friend was murdered.

seriously injured.

The other was

It is an unusual conduct of Siddharth

Motwani to be loitering in the colony.
17.

Since prosecution admits that Siddharth Motwani

was apprehended at another gate of the colony at around 2.30
AM and Siddharth Motwani admits said fact, it is obvious that

B.A.No.1806/2007

page 6 of 9

Siddharth Motwani could not have remained in the hospital
from 1.30 AM till 3. AM.
18.

Further, it would be relevant to note that in his

statement recorded by the police

under Section 161 Cr.P.C.

exhibited as PW-2/DA, Siddharth Motwani
disclosed

has ostensibly

the name and parentage of the petitioner.

When

cross-examined that he knew the petitioner before hand,
Siddharth Motwani denied the same.

When questioned as to

how he disclosed to the police the name and parentage of the
petitioner, he denied having so done.

When confronted with

his statement recorded by the police wherein it is so recorded
in Ex.PW-2/DA, Siddharth Motwani denied that he volunteered
said information.
19.

It would be interesting to note that the FIR records

the arrest of the petitioner and the co-accused as also records
the fact that the two were apprehended when they came back
to retrieve their Indica car.
20.

Following circumstances emerge :-

a)

Save and except Siddharth Motwani,

other

eye witnesses of the prosecution did not implicate
the petitioner.
b)

Siddharth Motwani has seriously contradicted
himself

c)

accused by name and by parentage since he
disclosed the same to the police in his statement
under Section 161 Cr.P.C., a statement which he
attempted to resile but unsatisfactorily.

The silver coloured Indica was

were in a blue

21.

Case is

accordingly

made out to admit the

petitioner to bail.
22.

Petition stands disposed of directing the learned

Trial Judge to release the petitioner on bail on his furnishing a

B.A.No.1806/2007

personal bond in the sum of Rs.25,000/- with two sureties in
the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned Trial Judge in
the afore-noted FIR.

Copy of the order be given dasti to learned counsel

for the petitioner.
