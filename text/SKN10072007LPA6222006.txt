1. The appellant-Rehabilitation Ministry Employees' Cooperative
House Building Society Ltd, by way of the present Letters Patent
th

Appeal has challenged judgment dated 7 February, 2006 passed
by the learned Single Judge disposing of Writ Petition (Civil) No.
9469/2005 filed by them.
2. By the impugned judgment, the learned Single Judge has
examined various provisions of the Delhi Land Revenue Act, 1954
(hereinafter referred to as the Act, for short) and the relevant
Rules and thereafter held that the revenue authorities after
considering the relevant records relied upon by the parties shall
demarcate the boundaries of the acquired and unacquired lands, if
any, comprised in Khasra No. 180/137/3, Vill. Begumpur (Patti,
Hameed Sarai). Parties have been given liberty to take recourse to
statutory remedy, if any of them is aggrieved by the demarcation
report. Encroachment, if any, noticed has also been directed to be
removed in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the
relevant Rules.

3. Learned counsel for the appellant had submitted that no such
demarcation was required and should be permitted as the entire
Khasra No.180/137/3 in Vill. Begumpur (Patti, Hameed Sarai) was
acquired by two separate Notifications and awards, the last being
th

Award No. 1595 dated 28 June, 1963 by which area of 1 bigha
and 9 biswas was acquired. Reliance was also placed upon
Jamabandi of the aforesaid village, as per which the total land
comprised in Khasra No. 180/137/3 was 2 bighas and 3 biswas.
The balance area, it was submitted was acquired earlier.
4. Learned counsel for the respondent no.5, on the other hand,
submitted that the total land in Khasra No. 180/137/3 admeasured
3 bighas and 14 biswas out of which only 1 bigha and 14 biswas
was acquired. He claimed that the respondent no.5 is the owner of
2 bighas of unacquired land located in the said Khasra. Reference
in this regard was made to the reports of the Tehsildar filed
pursuant to directions issued in a suit filed by the appellant herein
before the Additional District Judge, Tis Hazari. The said reports

LPA No.622/2006

Page No. 4

have been placed on record. Reference was also made to earlier
notice issued by the S.D.M. for demarcation which could not be
carried out because of technical reasons. Reliance was also
th

placed upon the Order dated 6 October, 2005 passed in Writ
Petition (Civil) Nos. 18816-17/2005.
5. Various disputed questions of fact have been raised in the present
Appeal. It may be noticed here that the Delhi Development
Authority had failed to file its response to the said Writ Petition as
noticed by the learned Single Judge in the impugned judgment.
However, the learned Single Judge had called for the original
records of the Delhi Development Authority. As per the records
only 3 biswas of land comprised in Khasra No. 180/137/3, Vill.
Begumpur, (Patti, Hameed Sarai) post acquisition was handed
over to the appellant-Society along with other lands for
development as a residential colony. Other land comprised in
Khasra No. 180/137/3 was not handed over to the appellantSociety. It is the case of the respondent no.5 that the entire land in

LPA No.622/2006

Page No. 5

Khasra No. 180/137/3 was never acquired. In fact it is claimed that
the respondent no.5 continues to be the owner of 2 bighas of land
in the said Khasra. This is disputed by the appellant. There is
dispute about the actual area comprised in Khasra No. 180/137/3.
As per the appellant, the total area in the said Khasra was only 2
bighas and 3 biswas whereas as per the respondent no.5 the total
area in the said Khasra comprised of 3 bighas and 14 biswas. It is
the case of the respondent no.5 that demarcation was carried out
th

and was done on 28 November, 1996 but the appellant-Society
has continued to raise various objections. Demarcation report
supports the claim of the respondent no.5. Reference in this
regard as already stated above was made to the report of
Tehsildar Hauz Khas which was submitted in the Court of
Additional District and Civil Judge, Tis Hazari in the civil suit filed
by the appellant-Society. The appellant-Society has protested and
claimed land grabbing and fraudulent manipulation of revenue
records. These aspects and contentions cannot be decided in the

LPA No.622/2006

Page No. 6

present Appeal but under the procedure prescribed under the Act.
th

6. The appellant relied upon the Order dated 5 March, 1987. We
have examined the said Order passed by Tehsildar Mehrauli, New
Delhi

in

Case

no.

CG13/86

titled

Rehabilitation

Ministry

Employees Cooperative Housing Society Ltd versus Hem
Chander. The said Order specifically records that 2 bighas of
Khasra No.180/137/3 have been shown as unacquired land in
Khasra Girdawari being maintained in respect of the said Khasra
under the Punjab Land Manual but there is some dispute about
the area having been acquired out of the khasras including Khasra
No. 180/137/3. He has held that he cannot go into this controversy
and was deciding the issue only with regard to the actual
possession of the land. The issue with regard to the acquisition
and demarcation was left open. The said Order, therefore, does
not come to the aid and help of the appellant-Society. Reliance
rd

placed upon the Order dated 3 December, 2004 passed in Writ
Petition (Civil) No. 1527/1994 is also of no assistance. The said

LPA No.622/2006

Page No. 7

case was filed by one of the allottees of the plot which was located
in Khasra No. 363/172/1. A third person who was claiming right
over the said plot could not produce any documents as to how he
claimed ownership on the land in Khasra No. 363/172/1 which was
allotted to the society.

As there had already been plotted

development and the land had already been acquired by the Delhi
Development Authority, prior to change in the revenue records, the
Court did not rely upon the same and held that the record was of
no consequence. The facts of the present case are different. As
per the revenue records, the entire land located in Khasra No.
180/137/3 has not been acquired and there is some dispute
whether or not the entire area in the aforesaid Khasra has been
th

acquired. This is clear even from the Order dated 5 March, 1987
passed in the case filed by the appellant-Society against Mr. Hem
Chander. Learned Single Judge has referred to Sections 16, 20,
22 and 28 of the Act as well as Rules 403 and 404 of the Delhi
Land Revenue Rules, 1962. After examining the relevant

LPA No.622/2006

Page No. 8

provisions, the learned Single Judge has held that post acquisition
in terms of the mandate of Section 22 of the Act, relevant entries
with regard to the acquisition, ownership and vesting of the land
with the Government have to be made. Learned Single Judge has
also recorded that it was not the case of the appellant-Society in
the Writ Petition that the entire land of Vill. Begumpur was
acquired. Thus, before the learned Single Judge, the appellantSociety had admitted that there were some unacquired land and to
that extent the same is governed by the Revenue Laws. In these
circumstances, when disputes relating to boundary of acquired
and unacquired land is raised, the same has to be adjudicated
and decided in accordance with the Act. As observed by the
learned Single Judge, the dispute is not with regard to the land
admitted to be acquired and utilised for colonisation but dispute is
with regard to the boundaries of the unacquired land, if any, which
continues to be governed by the provisions of the Act and the
relevant Rules.

LPA No.622/2006

Page No. 9

7. We also find that the learned Single Judge has issued necessary
directions to protect the interest of the appellant-Society by giving
directions that the revenue authorities would look into the revenue
records and would also consider the Jamabandi produced by the
Society as per which the total land comprised in Khasra No.
180/137/3 was only 2 bighas and 3 biswas. It may be stated here
that the said Jamabandi was not filed along with the writ petition
but photocopy of the same was filed along with the written
synopsis. In fact in the writ petition, the appellant-Society had not
disclosed the total area of land that comprised in Khasra No.
180/137/3, Vill. Begumpur (Patti, Hameed Sarai). In these
circumstances, we find no cause and ground to interfere with the
impugned judgment.

We do not find any merit in the present

Appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed. It is clarified that in
case any of the parties is aggrieved by the demarcation report,
they will be at liberty to take recourse to statutory remedies in
accordance with law. While making demarcation, the revenue

LPA No.622/2006

Page No. 10

authorities will also examine the records of the Delhi Development
Authority and the contentions and issues raised by the appellantSociety. Notice will be issued by the Revenue Authorities to the
Delhi Development Authority and Government of National Capital
Territory of Delhi. It is also clarified that observations made in this
order and the impugned order, will not be binding on the
authorities who will independently examine the entire controversy
without being influenced by the observations.
8. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there will be no order
as to costs.
