Hon'ble Mr.Justice Pradeep Nandrajog

1.

Whether reporters of local papers may be allowed
to see the judgment?

2.

To be referred to the Reporter or not?

3.
:

Whether judgment should be reported in Digest?
PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Respondent has filed 4 complaints under Section

138 read with Section 141 of N.I.Act. Petitioners have been
impleaded as accused No.5 and 6. In the memo of parties to
the complaint they have been referred to as Directors of
accused No.1 'M/s Hira Lal Printing Works Ltd'.
2.

Vide order dated 19.3.2005, petitioners have been

summoned as to why they should not be prosecuted pursuant
to the 4 complaints.
3.

In the complaint, complainant has stated that it had

advanced Rs.1.25 crores to accused No.1 as a loan. 4 cheques
detailed in para 5 of the complaint were alleged to have been
issued from the account of accused No.1 by accused No.3 who
was stated to have signed the cheques.

Alleging that the

cheques had been dishonoured, 4 complaints were filed.
4.

Pertaining to the directors of the

company, which

needless to state, included the petitioners, only averments
made are in para 10 of the complaint.

Being relevant same

reads as under :-

5.
petitioners

“10. That the accused No.1 is a company
andaccused Nos.2 to 6 being
its
Directors/Officers
in
charge
of
and
responsible to the day-to-day affairs and the
conduct of the business of accused
company, are thus jointly and severally
liable for the offences committed by them.”
Contention urged by learned counsel for

the

as would be noted hereinunder is well founded

inasmuch as a similar contention found favour

with

the

Supreme Court in the decision reported as AIR 1983 SC 67,
Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs. Ram Kishan Rastogi & Anr.
6.

Since criminal liability has to be fastened with

certainty, a complaint under Section 138 read with Section 141
of N.I.Act must make it manifestly clear as to what

is the

gravement of an allegation against a particular accused.
7.

Needless to state, unless law presumes, there

cannot be any presumption

that a person is

guilty of an

offence.
8.

In case of offence

by a company, a presumption

would arise that the offence has been committed with the
active knowledge, consent or supervision of the Managing
Director for the reason by virtue of the designation of his office,
namely, 'Managing' law presumes that such person would be
liable. But in the case of Directors, position is to the contrary.

No legal presumption arises.

Vicarious liability has to be

pleaded and proved.
9.

Sub-Section 1 of Section 141 of the N.I. Act, 1881 reads

as under :-

10.

“141. Offences by companies.-(1)
If the person committing an offence under
section 138 is a company, every person
who, at the time the offence was
committed, was in charge of, and was
responsible to the company for the conduct
of the business of the company, as well as
the company, shall be deemed to be guilty
of the offence and shall be liable to be
proceeded
against
and
punished
accordingly.”
A bare reading of Sub-Section 1 of Section 141 of

the N.I. Act makes it clear that to fasten liability on a Director it
has to be proved that the person named as the Director was
responsible to the company and was incharge of the affairs of
the company pertaining to the conduct of the business of the
company.
11.

Thus, an essential ingredient of an actionable

complaint, where liability is fastened on the shoulders of a
Director, requires

an averment to be made that the person

concerned was in-charge of and was responsible to the
company for the conduct of the business of the company.
12.

In the decision reported as AIR 1983 SC 67

Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs. Ram Kishan Rastogi & Anr.,

pertaining to an offence under the Prevention of Food
Adulteration Act, 195, following averment in the complaint was
made :-

13.

“5. That the Accused No.3 is the Manager
of Accused No.2 and Accused No.4 to 7 are
the Directors of Accused No.2 and as such
they were incharge of and responsible for
the conduct of business of Accused No.2 at
the time of sampling.”
Considering the aforenoted pleadings, Hon'ble

Supreme Court, in para 14 of the report, opined that a
meaningful reading of the pleading shows that the complaint
had merely presumed that the Directors of the company would
be guilty because of holding a particular office since law would
assume so.
14.

In para 15 it was opined that no such inference is

presumed by law and that since Directors are vicariously liable
for offences by the company and vicarious liability being an
incident of an offence under the Act, there have to be specific
averments

of

fact

against

the

Directors

wherefrom

a

reasonable inference could be drawn that if proved, they, i.e.
the Directors would also be vicariously liable.
15.

In the report published as AIR 2007 SC 1454

N.K.Wahi Vs. Shekhar Singh & Ors., dealing with Sections 141
and 138 of the N.I. Act, noting an earlier decision of the
Supreme

Court

reported

as

(2005)

8

SCC

89

SMS

Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. Neeta Bhalla, in para 8 of the report,
their Lordships of the Supreme Court observed as under :-

16.

“8. To launch a prosecution, therefore,
against the alleged Directors there must be
a specific allegation in the complaint as to
the part played by them in the transaction.
There should be clear and unambiguous
allegation as to how the Directors are
incharge and responsible for the conduct of
the business of the company.
The
description should be clear. It is true that
precise words from the provisions of the Act
need not be reproduced and the Court can
always come to a conclusion in facts of each
case.
But still in the absence of any
averment or specific evidence the net result
would be that complaint would not be
entertainable.”
In para 19, legal position was summarized and in

sub-para 'a' of para 19 it was clarified as under :-

17.

“19(a).
It is necessary to specifically
aver in a complaint under Section 141 that
at the time the offence was committed, the
person accused was in charge of, and
responsible for the conduct of the business
of the company. This averment is an
essential requirement of Section 141 and
has to be made in a complaint. Without this
averment being made in a complaint, the
requirements of Section 141 cannot be said
to be satisfied.”
A perusal of para 10 of the pleading in each

complaint shows that the complainant has pleaded liability on
the accused on the allegation that law envisages them to be
liable.

The use of the words “being its Directors”

and

the

words “are thus” clearly evidences that the complainant has

pleaded a presumptive pleading and not a pleading by way of a
statement of a fact.
17.

Thus, the petitions are allowed.

Summoning order

dated 19.3.2005 against the petitioners is quashed.
