JUDGMENT

1.

By means of the present application the Petitioner has

applied for being released on bail till the finalisation of the
writ petition, in which a prayer has been made for the
issuance of an appropriate writ quashing the proceedings
WP(C)3304/2007

page 1 of 24

and decision of the General Court Martial. The Petitioner
also prays for his reinstatement in service with all
consequential benefits as also for the quashing of the
impugned Order dated 29.11.2006 which confirmed the
findings of the Court of Inquiry sentencing him two years
rigorous imprisonment and dismissal from service.

The

Writ Petition is still to be admitted. Learned counsel for the
Petitioner has contended that at the present moment the
Petitioner has already undergone custody for fifteen
months and would be due to be released from Jail in March,
2008 after deducting jail remissions. The argument is that
since the writ petition is likely to be decided after the
Petitioner

has

undergone

his

sentence,

the

prayers

pertaining to his release would be rendered infructuous.
Hence he is entitled to being enlarged on bail. It is
contended by Mr. Dalal that if the period of incarceration is
completed

by,

the

Petitioner

cannot

be

adequately

compensated in terms of money if the writ petition is
eventually allowed.

The argument is palpably attractive,

but the answer would depend on whether the Petitioner has
an established and vested right to assail the sentence of the
WP(C)3304/2007

page 2 of 24

Court Martial by means of a writ petition, even though an
appeal has not been provided for by Parliament.

2.

The Petitioner also asseverates that the General

Officer Commanding 31 Armoured Division had rejected
the Petitioner's Appeal for Suspension of Sentence vide
Order dated 17.7.2007 holding that since “the petitioner
has been convicted by General Court Martial on grave
charges for committing theft of property belonging to the
government and there being sufficient evidence on record
to sustain his conviction.” The prayer was not meritorious.

3.

The Army Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as the

Act) makes no provision for the filing of an Appeal against
the sentence of a Court-Martial other than Section 164, and
annulment of proceedings under Section 165. It is in this
context that learned counsel for the Petitioner has relied on
the poignant, yet unheeded, remarks made in Union of

India -vs- Charanjit Singh Gill, JT 2000 (5) SC 135. This
decision, in turn, refers back to a decision in Lt. Col. Prithi

Pal Singh Bedi -vs- Union of India, (1982) 3 SCC 140 and
WP(C)3304/2007

page 3 of 24

Sunil Batra -vs- Delhi Administration, 1979 (1) SCR 394. In
Bedi the Supreme Court had recorded these pithy
observations which were extracted by their Lordships in

Gill.
44. Reluctance of the apex court more concerned
with civil law to interfere with the internal affairs
of the Army is likely to create a distorted picture in
the minds of the military personnel that persons
subject to Army Act are not citizens of India. It is
one of the cardinal features of our Constitution that
a person by enlisting in or entering Armed Forces
does not cease to be a citizen so as to wholly
deprive him of his rights under the Constitution.
More so when this Court held in Sunil Batra v.
Delhi Administration, that even prisoners deprived
of personal liberty are not wholly denuded of their
fundamental rights. In the larger interest of
national security and military discipline Parliament
in its wisdom may restrict or abrogate such rights
in their application to the Armed Forces but this
process should not be carried so far as to create a
class of citizens not entitled to the benefits of the
liberal spirit of the Constitution.

Persons subject

to Army Act are citizens of this ancient land having
a feeling of belonging to the civilised community
governed
WP(C)3304/2007

by

the

liberty-oriented

constitution.

arising

out

of

this

Even though it is pointed

out that the procedure of trial by court martial is
almost analogous to the procedure of trial in the
ordinary criminal courts, we must recall what
Justice William O'Douglas observed : “[T]hat civil
trial is held in an atmosphere conducive to the
protection of individual rights while a military trial
is market by the age-old manifest destiny of
retributive justice.

Very expression 'court martial'

generally strikes terror in the heart of the person
to be tried by it.

And somehow or the other the

trial is looked upon with disfavour.”

In Reid v.

Covert, Justice Black observed at page 1174 as
under:
Courts martial are typically ad hoc bodies
appointed by a military officer from among his
subordinates. They have always been subject to
varying degrees of “command influence”. In

WP(C)3304/2007

page 5 of 24

essence, these tribunals are simply executive
tribunals whose personnel are in the executive
chain of command. Frequently, the members of
the court martial must look to the appointing
officer

for

promotions,

advantageous

assignments and efficiency ratings – in short, for
their future progress in the service. Conceding
to military personnel that high degree of honesty
and sense of justice which nearly all of them
undoubtedly have, the members of a court
martial, in the nature of things, do not and
cannot have the independence of jurors drawn
from the general public or of civilian judges.
Absence of even one appeal with power to review
evidence,

legal

formulation,

conclusion

and

adequacy or otherwise of punishment is a glaring
lacuna in a country where a counterpart civilian
convict can prefer appeal after appeal to hierarchy
of courts. Submission that full review of finding
and/or sentence in confirmation proceeding under
Section 153 is provided for is poor solace. A
hierarchy of courts with appellate powers each
having its own power of judicial review has of
course been found to be counter-productive but
the converse is equally distressing in that there is
not even a single judicial review.

With the

expanding horizons of fair play in action even in

WP(C)3304/2007

page 6 of 24

administrative decision, the universal declaration
of human rights and retributive justice being
relegated to the uncivilised days, a time has come
when a step is required to be taken for at least one
review and it must truly be a judicial review as and
by way of appeal to a body composed of nonmilitary personnel or civil personnel.

Army is

always on alert for repelling external aggression
and suppressing internal disorder so that the
peace-loving citizens enjoy a social order based on
rule of law; the same cannot be denied to the
protectors of this order. And it must be realised
that an appeal from Ceaser to Ceaser's wife –
confirmation proceeding under Section 153 – has
been condemned as injudicious and merely a lip
sympathy to form. The core question is whether at
least there should be one appeal to a body
composed of non-military personnel and who
would enjoy the right of judicial review both on
law and facts as also determine the adequacy of
punishment being commensurate with the gravity
of the offence charged. Judicial approach by
people

Unjust decision would be subversive of discipline.

WP(C)3304/2007

page 7 of 24

There must be a judicious admixture of both.
4.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner has fervently

contended that since no remedial action has been taken by
Parliament, nay no discussion or cogitation on this point
has at all been been made, the Writ Court should virtually
transform itself into an Appeallate Court. The argument is
predicated on the following observations in Gill :
...Despite lapse of about two decades neither the
Parliament nor the Central Government appears to
have realised their constitutional obligations as
were expected by this Court except amending Rule
62 providing that

after recording the finding in

each charge the Court shall give brief reasons in
support thereof. The Judge-Advocate has been
obliged to record or caused to be recorded brief
reasons in the proceedings. Even today the law
relating to Armed Forces remains static requires
to be changed keeping in view the observations
made by this Court in Prithi Pal Singh Bedi's case
(supra),

the

constitutional

mandate

and

the

changes effected by other democratic countries.
The time has come to allay the apprehension of all
concerned that the system of trial by court-martial
was not the arch type of summary and arbitrary
proceedings.
WP(C)3304/2007

page 8 of 24

10. In the absence of effective steps taken by the
Parliament and the Central Government, it is the
constitutional obligation of the courts in the
country to protect and safeguard the constitutional
rights of all citizens including the persons enrolled
in the Armed Forces to the extent permissible
under law by not forgetting the paramount need of
maintaining the discipline in the Armed Forces of
the country.

5.

In L. Chandra Kumar -vs- Union of India, 1997(3) SCC

261 the Seven Judges Constitution Bench of the Apex Court
had recognised and reaffirmed the almost limitless powers
of the High Courts exercising jurisdiction under Articles
226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. The observations
of the Constitution Bench are of wider ambit than those
articulated in K. Venkatachalam -vs- A. Swamickan, AIR
1999 SC 1723 which has been relied upon by Mr. Dalal. It
is trite that Writ Courts are fully empowered to enlarge a
person on bail if it is satisfied that the ends of justice
compelling so demand. The obstacle in the path of the
Petitioner, however, is that that his claim for bail partakes
of a routine character, namely, that because a writ petition
WP(C)3304/2007

page 9 of 24

is pending, he should be enlarged on bail. Learned counsel
for the Petitioner has eloquently put forth the analogy
applicable to pendency of appeals. We, however, feel that
the net has been thrown too wide by Mr. Dalal; that his
advertence to Moti Lal Saraf -vs- State of J&K, (2006) 10
SCC 560 is of no avail. Their Lordships were dealing with
the malaise of protracted criminal trials, which are rampant
primarily because of a shortage of judicial officers in our
country. It was in that context that it had been opined that
the right to speedy trial, which is a facet of Article 21 of the
Constitution of India, commences with the actual restraint
imposed by the arrest and incarceration of a prisoner, and
continues at all the stages viz. Investigation, Inquiry, Trial,
Appeal and Revision. Mr. Dalal has also relied on Kashmira

Singh -vs- The State of Punjab, 1977 SCC(CRI) 559 which
also holds that pending the final disposal of an Appeal bail
ought normally be granted. The incongruity is to equate an
Appeal with a Writ Petition. It would be relevant to recall
the scope of judicial Review under Articles 226 and 227 of
the Constitution of India as enunciated in Union of India

-vs- Himmat Singh Chahar, 1999(4) SCC 521:
WP(C)3304/2007

page 10 of 24

3. In view of the rival submissions at the Bar the
short question that arises for consideration is what
would

be

exercising

the

extent

power

of

under

the

jurisdiction

Article

226

of

in
the

Constitution over the findings of the authority in
court-martial proceedings? The defence personnel
serving in the Army, Navy or Air Force when
commit any offence are dealt with by the special
provisions contained in the Army Act, 1950 or the
Navy Act, 1957 or the Air Force Act, 1950 and not
by the normal Procedure Code. The said Navy Act
is a complete code by itself and prescribes the
procedure to be followed in case it is decided that
an officer should be tried by a court-martial. The
Act also provides sufficient safeguard by way of
further appeal to the Chief of the Staff and then
ultimately to the Union Government.
4. Since the entire procedure is provided in the Act
itself and the Act also provides for a further
consideration by the Chief of the Naval Staff and
then by the Union Government then ordinarily
there should be a finality to the findings arrived at
by the competent authority in the court-martial
proceedings.

It

is

of

course

true

that

notwithstanding the finality attached to the orders
of the competent authority in the court-martial
proceedings the High Court is entitled to exercise

WP(C)3304/2007

page 11 of 24

its power of judicial review by invoking jurisdiction
under Article 226 but that would be for a limited
purpose of finding out whether there has been
infraction of any mandatory provisions of the Act
prescribing the procedure which has caused gross
miscarriage of justice or for finding out that
whether there has been violation of the principles
of

natural

justice

which

vitiates

the

entire

proceedings or that the authority exercising the
jurisdiction had not been vested with jurisdiction
under the Act. The said power of judicial review
cannot be a power of an appellate authority
permitting the High Court to reappreciate the
evidence and in coming to a conclusion that the
evidence is insufficient for the conclusion arrived
at by the competent authorities in court-martial
proceedings. At any rate it cannot be higher than
the jurisdiction of the High Court exercised under
Article 227 against an order of an inferior tribunal.

6.

Our attention has also been drawn to the decision of

the Division Bench in S.P.N. Sharma -vs- Union of India,
AIR 1968 Delhi 156 to the effect that Habeas Corpus
proceedings would be misutilised in cases where a person
has been properly detained by a Court-Martial; neither

WP(C)3304/2007

page 12 of 24

proceedings are available so as to enable the Writ Court to
exercise supervisory control or to Review proceedings of
the Court-Martial.

7.

Mr. Dalal has also drawn attention to the observations

made by a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High
Court in Crl. Appeal No.428-DB of 1996 decided on
8.9.1999, titled Dharam Pal -vs- State of Haryana, where it
had been held that life convicts who have undergone five
years of imprisonment of which three years should be after
conviction, ought to be released on bail pending hearing of
the appeals. While doing so, en passant the Division Bench
observed that the same principles would apply to those
convicted by Courts-Martial and such prisoners should be
entitled to release after seeking a suspension of their
sentences. The persuasive value of this Judgment, however,
stands considerably diluted in view of the Orders passed by
a Bench comprising the author of Dharam Pal, in Special
Leave to Appeal (Crl) No(s). 3123/2006 titled Union of

India -vs- Shinder Singh decided on 14.5.2007 where the
following observations were made:
WP(C)3304/2007

page 13 of 24

The question involved in this special leave
petition is a matter of principle as to whether the
High Court can in exercise of its jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution interfere with
orders passed by the Chief of Army Staff in relation
to a Court Martial proceedings which is not subject
to the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court. The
High Court treating the instant application as if it
was an application for bail in a pending appeal has
suspended the sentence

of life

imprisonment

passed against the respondent which the Chief of
Army Staff has refused. However, this is a matter
which may be raised again in the writ petition
before the High Court and, if necessary, before
this Court.
We adjourn the hearing of this petition by six
months and request the High Court to dispose of
the writ petition itself within a period of four
weeks from today.

We make it clear that the

period during which the respondent is not in
custody pursuant to the impugned of the High
Court will not be counted for the purposes of grant
of remission.
Liberty to the parties to make a mention.
8.

Shinder Singh arose from the Judgment of learned

Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which

WP(C)3304/2007

page 14 of 24

had applied Dharampal as well as Col. Harish Chandra

Goswamy -vs- Union of India, 1991(1) CLR 433. Mr. Dalal
has brought to our notice the Orders passed in WPC)
Nos.11588/2007 and 2931/2007 where Appeal had been
granted. We have already taken pains to clarify that the
extraordinary jurisdiction of High Courts contained in
Articles

226

and

227

of

the

Constitution

of

India

indubitably empower the Writ Court to enlarge convicts on
bail, but in exceptional cases. The question which has
engaged our attention in these proceedings did not arise
before either of those Division Benches or even before two
Division Benches of this very Court. It is our considered
opinion that entertaining applications for bail in writ
petitions, solely on the ground of entitlement to bail during
the pendency of the writ petition, should be deprecated. So
far as Goswamy is concerned the learned Single Judge of
this Court had not granted bail in case where 'Rule' had
been issued by the Division Bench.

It was in those

circumstances that he had drawn the assumption that the
Court had prima facie been convinced that an error in the
Court-Martial had occurred which would be liable to be set
WP(C)3304/2007

page 15 of 24

aside in the exercise of Judicial Review. That is not the
position that obtains before us.

9.

There is no gainsaying that the right to Appeal is

neither an absolute right nor an ingredient of natural
justice, the principles of which must be followed in all
judicial and quasi judicial adjudications.

The right to

Appeal is a statutory right and it can be circumscribed by
the conditions in the grant (See Vijay Prakash D. Mehta

and

Jawahar

D.

Mehta

-vs-

Collector

of

Customs

(Preventive), Bombay, AIR 1988 SC 2010 and Shyam
Kishore -vs- Municipal Corporation of Delhi, (1993) 1 SCC
22.

In Shiv Shakti Co-op. Housing Society, Nagpur -vs-

M/s. Swaraj Developers, AIR 2003 SC 2434 the following
enunciation of the law has been articulated:17. Right of appeal is statutory. Right of appeal
inherits in no one. When conferred by statute it
becomes a vested right. In this regard there is
essential distinction between right of appeal and
right of suit. Where there is inherent right in every
person to file a suit and for its maintainability it
requires no authority of law, appeal requires so. As

WP(C)3304/2007

page 16 of 24

was observed in The State of Kerala v. K.M. Charia
Abdulla

and

Co.

(AIR

1965

SC

1585),

the

distinction between right of appeal and revision is
based on different implicit in the two expressions.
An appeal is continuation of the proceedings; in
effect the entire proceedings are before the
appellate authority and it has power to review the
evidence

subject

to

statutory

limitations

prescribed. But in the case of revision, whatever
powers the revisional authority may or may not
have, it has no power to review the evidence,
unless the statute expressly confers on it that
power. It was noted by the four-Judges Bench in
Hari Shankar and others v. Rao Girdhari Lal
Chowdhury (AIR 1963 SC 698) that the distinction
between an appeal and a revision is a real one. A
right of appeal carries with it a right of re-hearing
on law as well as fact, unless the state conferring
the right of appeal limits the re-hearing in some
way, as has been done in second appeals arising
under the Code. The power of hearing revision is
generally given to a superior Court so that it may
satisfy itself that a particular case has been
decided according to law. Reference was made to
Section 115 of the Code to hold that the High
Court's powers under the said provision are
limited to certain particular categories of cases.

WP(C)3304/2007

page 17 of 24

The right there is confined to jurisdiction and
jurisdiction alone.

10.

There is a clear distinction between right of an Appeal

and right to file a Suit, or to prefer a Revision, and a

fortiori a writ petition which is always dependent on the
discretion of the High Court.

11.

Furthermore, it is well entrenched that a Writ Petition

will not be entertained if an alternative remedy has not
been availed of. Chapter-XIV of the Act deals with Pardons,
Remissions and Suspensions. By virtue of Section 179 a
convict can, inter alia, apply for his release on parole.
Parole has been defined in Black's Law Dictionary, 5th
Edition as “release from jail, prison or other confinement
after actually serving part of the sentence”. A convict can
also apply for suspension of sentence under Section 182.
Taking

resort

to

latter

provision

is

additionally

advantageous since Section 185 postulates that where a
sentence is suspended such period shall be reckoned as
part of the term of such sentence. In addition to ChapterWP(C)3304/2007

page 18 of 24

XIV the Petitioner or any other convict can also resort to
Section 164(2) or Section 165 of the Act.

14.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner has contended that

it may not be possible for the Petitioner to obtain parole
under the Army Act, Rules and Regulations solely on the
ground that his writ petition is pending adjudication by this
Court. This may well be so, but even then the writ court
cannot be transformed into an Appellate Court hearing
criminal appeals. If the Petitioner's prayer for parole is
rejected illegally, the Writ Court will intervene. As has
already been seen an Appeal is a creature of a statute. The
common perception that every Order or Sentence is
appealable is without foundation. Judges should guard
against

trivializing

writ

jurisdiction

by

making

it

a

surrogate for Appellate Courts which can overturn findings
of fact. The Writ Court only exercises power of judicial
Review which is of a much narrower compass.

15.

In Tata Cellular vs. Union of India, (1994) 6 Supreme

Court

Cases

651,

the

parameters

of

Wednesbury

unreasonableness have been delineated in these words -“The duty of the court is to confine itself to the
question of legality. Its concern should be:
WP(C)3304/2007

page 21 of 24

1.

Whether

exceeded its

a

decision/making

authority

powers?

2.

Committed an error of law.

3.

committed a breach of the rules of natural

justice,
4.

reached a decision which no reasonable

tribunal would have reached or,
5.

abused its powers.

Therefore, it is not for the court to determine
whether a particular policy or particular decision
taken in the fulfilment of that policy is fair. It is
only concerned with the manner in which those
decisions have been taken. The extent of the duty
to act fairly will vary from case to case. Shortly
put, the grounds upon which an administrative
action is subject to control by judicial review can
be classified as under:
(i) Illegality : This means the decision-maker must
understand correctly the law that regulates his
decision-making power and must given effect to it.
(ii)

Irrationality,

namely,

Wednesbury

unreasonableness.
(iii) Procedural impropriety.
The above are only the broad grounds but it does
not rule out addition of further grounds in course
of time. As a matter of fact, in R. vs. Secretary of
State for the Home Department, ex Brind, Lord

WP(C)3304/2007

page 22 of 24

Diplock refers specifically to one development,
namely, the possible recognition of the principle of
proportionality. In all these cases the test to be
adopted is that the court should, “consider whether
something has gone wrong of a nature and degree
which requires its intervention”.

16.

We, therefore, conclude that bail applications should

not ordinarily be entertained in writ proceedings even if
the

consequence

is

that

the

petitioner

would

have

undergone the sentence before the Petition is decided. The
presumption normally is that a Judgment or Sentence is
legally and jurally in order.

17.

We now return to the bail application before us. We

reiterate that the Writ Court is not bereft or devoid of
power

to

grant

bail

in

exceptional

circumstances.

However, pendency of a writ petition is not a ground for
grant of bail. Writ proceedings cannot be equated to
appellate proceedings since the latter is a matter of right,
whereas the former, apart from being restricted in nature,
is discretionary in content.
