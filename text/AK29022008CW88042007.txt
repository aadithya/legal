1.

The petitioner, Municipal Corporation of Delhi has impugned the

order dated 6th September, 2007 passed by the Appellate Authority
dismissing the appeal of the petitioner against the decision of the
Controlling Authority holding that the respondent is entitled for the
balance amount of gratuity of Rs.8,799/- along with simple interest at
10% per annum.

The respondent, Sh. Gulab Chand, ex-beldar employee of Malaria

Department, Shahdara South Zone in Municipal Corporation of Delhi
had filed an application for determination of gratuity payable to him
and for a direction to the Commissioner to pay the same to the
petitioner.

3.

The respondent was appointed on 30 November, 1974 and he

retired on 31st December, 1998 after rendering a service of about 24
years. The last drawn wages of the respondent were Rs.4197/- and he
has claimed an amount of gratuity of Rs10.766/-.

4.

The application of the respondent was contested on the ground

that the respondent was regularized on 22nd September, 1975 and his
last drawn basic pay was Rs. 4197/- per month. It was contended that
he has already received a gratuity amount of Rs.49,313/-. The
petitioner had contended that the Corporation was following the CCS
(Pension), 1972 Rules for the purpose of calculation of gratuity and
consequently an amount of Rs. 49,313/-. was paid. The petitioner
Corporation also relied on the fact that the exemption has been granted
to the Corporation from the applicability of the Gratuity Act and
consequently the Gratuity Act, 1972 is not applicable and the
respondent is not entitled for any gratuity under the Gratuity Act, 1972.

Relying on MCD Vs.Padma Devi and MCD Vs.V.T.Naresh, 1986

(52) FLR 335 the competent authority held that the employees of
Municipal Corporation of Delhi are entitled to receive gratuity amount
either under the payment of Gratuity Act or CCS(Pension) Rules
whichever is higher. Consequently, if on calculation of the gratuity
amount under the CCS(Pension) Rules, the amount of gratuity is higher
then the gratuity is payable under the CCS(Pension) Rules and in case
the amount of gratuity is higher under the Gratuity Act, 1972 then the
gratuity is to be paid under the said Act.

6.

The competent authority, therefore, calculated the gratuity

payable to the petitioner under the Gratuity Act, 1972 to be
Rs.58,112/- and since the amount of Rs. 49,313 /- had already been
paid, the order dated 23rd April, 2007 was passed holding that the
respondent is entitled for a sum of Rs.8,799/- as balance amount of
gratuity with a simple interest at 10% per annum as per Section 7(3-A)
of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 from the date it became payable
that is 31st December, 1998. Regarding the exemption granted to the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi it was held that the exemption was
granted by order dated 22nd July, 2005 and so it could be prospective
and not retrospective and on this ground respondent cannot be denied
the balance amount of gratuity.

The appeal filed by the petitioner was dismissed by the Appellate

Authority by order dated 6th September, 2007 against which the present
writ petition has been filed.

8.

This is no more res integra that prior to exemption being granted

on 22nd July, 2005 the provision of Gratuity Act, 1972 were also
applicable to the employees of Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The
learned counsel for the petitioner is unable to show anything to the
contrary that if gratuity is payable under the CCS(Pension) Rules and
under the Gratuity Act,1972 also then the Gratuity cannot be paid
under the act under which it is higher. This is, however, correct that an
employee shall not be entitled to claim gratuity under both the Acts.
The Apex Court in the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs.
Dharam Pakash and Ors, (1998) 7 SCC 221 had held to this effect. Para
2 of the said judgment is as under:2. The short question that arises for consideration is
whether an employee of the MCD would be entitled to
payment of gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act
when the MCD itself has adopted the provisions of the CCS
(Pension) Rules, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as “the
Pension Rules”), whereunder there is a provision both for
payment of pension as well as of gratuity. The contention of
the learned counsel appearing for the appellant in this
Court is that the payment of pension and gratuity under
the Pension Rules is a package by itself and once that
package is made applicable to the employees of the MCD,
the provisions of payment of gratuity under the Payment of
Gratuity Act cannot be held applicable. We have examined
carefully the provisions of the Pension Rules as well as the
provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act. The Payment of
Gratuity Act being a special provision for payment of
WP (C) 8804 of 2007

gratuity, unless there is any provision therein which
excludes its applicability to an employee who is otherwise
governed by the provisions of the Pension Rules, it is not
possible for us to hold that the respondent is not entitled to
the gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act. The only
provision which was pointed out is the definition of
“employee” in Section 2(e) which excludes the employees of
the Central Government and State Governments receiving
pension and gratuity under the Pension Rules but not an
employee of the MCD. The MCD employee, therefore,
would be entitled to the payment of gratuity under the
Payment of Gratuity Act. The mere fact that the
gratuity is provided for under the Pension Rules will
not disentitle him to get the payment of gratuity under
the Payment of Gratuity Act. In view of the overriding
provisions contained in Section 14 of the Payment of
Gratuity Act, the provision for gratuity under the Pension
Rules will have no effect. Possibly for this reason, Section 5
of the Payment of Gratuity Act has conferred authority on
the appropriate Government to exempt any establishment
from the operation of the provisions of the Act, if in its
opinion the employees of such establishment are in receipt
of gratuity or pensionary benefits not less favourable than
the benefits conferred under this Act. Admittedly MCD has
not taken any steps to invoke the power of the Central
Government under Section 5 of the Payment of Gratuity
Act.In the aforesaid premises, we are of the considered
opinion that the employees of the MCD would be
entitled to the payment of gratuity under the Payment
of Gratuity Act notwithstanding the fact that the
provisions of the Pension Rules have been made
applicable to them for the purpose of determining the
pension. Needless to mention that the employees
cannot claim gratuity available under the Pension
Rules.

9.

In the facts and circumstances, the plea of the petitioner that the

order of the Controlling Authority dated 23rd April, 2007 and Appellate
Authority is contrary to law is not sustainable. The respondent is
entitled for gratuity under the Gratuity Act, 1972 and since a part of the
amount has already been paid, the respondent is entitled for difference

as has been held by the Controlling Authority and Appellate Authority.
There is no manifest error in the orders of Controlling authority and the
Appellate Authority so as to entail interference by this Court.

10.

The writ petition in the facts and circumstances is without

any merit and it is, therefore, dismissed.
