(Mr.Vijay

&

Respondent no.52,(Mr. Pushap Kumar) under Section 17B of
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 for a direction to the petitioner/Delhi
Development Authority to pay full wages last drawn or minimum
wages whichever is higher as the respondents/applicants are unable
to maintain themselves and their family members although all efforts
are being made by them to secure some sort of employment but they
have not succeeded in getting any employment.

2.

The application is supported by the affidavits of these

respondents deposing categorically that they could not get any
employment after termination of their services though they have been
continuously trying to obtain the same at every possible place and
they are not engaged with any other employers/firms/companies/
establishments.

3.

The reply to the application was not filed despite opportunity

given from time to time. On 9th May, 2007 last and final opportunity
was granted to the petitioner to file the reply, however, reply was not
filed. On 13th September, 2007 the counsel for the petitioners/non-

WP(C) No.135/2006

Page 2 of 9

applicants, however, stated that she does not want to file any reply to
the application of the respondents/applicants to their application
under section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

4.

Though the counsel for the petitioners/non-applicants had

contended that reply is not to be filed on 13th September, 2007 but on
8th January, 2008 counsel for the petitioner again sought time to take
instructions.

5.

Today the learned counsel for the petitioners states that the

addresses of the respondents/applicants were not available and,
therefore, it could not be ascertained whether they are gainfully
employed or not.

6.

Perusal

of

the

application

filed

by

the

above

noted

respondents/applicants reflect that the plea of the counsel for the
petitioner is contrary to the record. The application dated 7th
February, 2006 is supported by the individual affidavits of above
noted respondents/applicants. In the affidavits, addresses of the
respondents/applicants

have

been

given.

The

petitioners/non-

applicants despite various opportunities did not file any reply to the
application and did not take any steps to ascertain whether these
respondents

were

WP(C) No.135/2006

gainfully

employed

or

not

in

any

of

Page 3 of 9

the

establishments.

7.

In these circumstances the only plausible inference that can be

drawn is that the depositions made by all the above noted
respondents/applicants in their affidavits that they are not gainfully
employed in any establishment, is correct and the objection raised by
the petitioner is rejected.

8.

It is no more res integra that the provisions of Section 17 B of

the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 comes into operation when an
award directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further
proceedings. The statute requires satisfaction of the following four
conditions:
(i)

an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in proceedings in a High Court or the
Supreme Court;

(ii)

during the pendency of such proceedings, employer
is required to pay full wages to the workman;

(iii)

the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any
maintenance allowance admissible to him under
any Rule;

(iv)

such wages would be admissible only if the
workman had not been employed in any
establishment during such period and an affidavit
had been filed to such effect

WP(C) No.135/2006

9.

While considering an application under this provision it is

necessary to bear in mind that the spirit, intendment and object
underlying the statutory provision of Section 17B is to mitigate and
relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship resulting to a workman due
to delay in the implementation of an award directing reinstatement of
his services on account of the challenge made to it by the employer.
The preliminary consideration for making available such a relief to a
workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment.
It recognizes a workman’s right to a bare minimum to keep body and
soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award directing
his reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no inherent right
of assailing an order or an award by an industrial adjudicator by way
of an appeal. The payment which is required to be made by the
employer to the workman has been held to be akin to a subsistence
allowance which is neither refundable nor recoverable from a
workman even if the Award in favor of the workman is set aside by the
High Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar
T. Patel the Apex Court was of the view that the object under Section
17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain
extent, the hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay
in implementation of the Award.

10.

While considering an application under Section 17B of the

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 the Court cannot go into the merits of
the case in the writ petition. It was so held in 86 (2000) DLT
510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.

11.

Now how much would the respondents/applicants will be

entitled for, whether they are entitled for last drawn wages or
something more. In the award dated 9th May, 1994 impugned by the
petitioner, the Labor Court had awarded the wages in accordance with
Minimum Wages Act. The Apex Court in 1970 1 SCR 51 titled Town
Municipal, Athani v. P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. had held that a workman
has a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and
cannot be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum
Wages Act for enforcing such right. The principles laid down by the
Supreme Court would have a bearing on the issues raised before this
Court

as

well.

From

a

conspectus

of

the

authoritative

pronouncements of the Apex Court, the right of a workman to an
amount equivalent to the wages notified under the Minimum Wages
Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the constitutional mandate
and nothing more. It is undoubtedly, the bare minimum which is
required by the workman to subsist and is nothing more. Full wages
last drawn can therefore only mean all the wages that have fallen due
at least from the date of the Award.

WP(C) No.135/2006

12.

This also cannot be disputed that granting relief under Section

17B of the Act and passing orders directing payment of wages last
drawn, is generally the rule; refusing to grant relief under Section 17B
is an exception, as it could be passed only in the rarest of the rare
cases of jurisdictional error where there is no relationship between the
parties.

13.

In the present case the applicants being employees can not be

denied. This has also been inferred that they are not employed in any
establishment after the award was passed in their favor directing their
reinstatement with full back wages. Considering the facts and
circumstances and for the foregoing reasons the application is allowed
and the petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or the
minimum wages whichever is higher to the applicants/ respondent

(Smt.Santosh); Respondent no.10, (Smt.Bimla); Respondent no.11,

Respondent no.50, (Mr.Subhash Chand); Respondent no.51, (Mr.Vijay

Page 7 of 9

award dated 9th May, 1994 in ID No.185/1987 and continue to pay
last drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher during the
pendency of the present petition.

14.

The arrears of the last drawn wages or the minimum wages

whichever is higher be paid from the date of the award within four
weeks. The petitioners shall also continue to pay the last drawn wages
or minimum wages whichever is higher in future by 10th day of every
month during the pendency of the present petition.

15.

The respondents/applicants are also directed to file an affidavit

undertaking to return/refund the difference of the last drawn wages
and minimum wages in case the petition is allowed and the
respondents/applicants are directed to repay the amount within the
time granted by this Court.

16.

The learned counsel for the petitioner also contended that an

amount of about Rs.40 lakhs has already been deposited. The learned
counsel for the respondents/applicants has contended that while
admitting the writ petition by order dated 6th January, 2006 the
petitioners were directed to deposit 20% of the total amount awarded
under the award though an amount of about Rs.2 crores was due. It
is also contended that since the last drawn wages or minimum wages

WP(C) No.135/2006

Page 8 of 9

whichever is higher has been ordered by this Court from 9 th May,
1994, the date of the award, and the claim petition was filed in 1987
the amount deposited is prior to the award dated 9th May, 1994.

17.

Since only 20% of the amount awarded was deposited by the

petitioner in terms of order dated 6th January, 2006 which has not
been modified or reviewed or set aside, therefore, the petitioner is
liable to pay the arrears of last drawn wages or minimum wages
whichever is higher in terms of order already passed hereinabove.
With these directions the application is disposed of.

WP(C) No.135/2006
The learned counsel for the petitioner seeks time to file the
rejoinder. Rejoinder be filed within eight weeks.
List on 18th July, 2008.
