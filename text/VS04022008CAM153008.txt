Chairperson and Ms. Shreya Arora, Mobile No.9891068004 as the
Alternate Chairperson for the meeting of the equity shareholders of
the Transferee company. The quorum for the said meeting will be 25
equity shareholders. The Chairperson and the Alternate Chairperson
will ensure that the notices convening the meeting of equity
shareholders of the Transferee company along with copies of scheme
and statement under Section 393 of the Companies Act, 1956, shall
be sent to the equity shareholders of the Transferee company by
recorded post at their registered or last known addresses at least 21
days before the date appointed for meeting, in their presence or in
the presence of their authorized representatives. Considering the
facts and circumstances, and keeping in view the submission of the
applicant, the sending of individual notices to the equity shareholders
holding upto 100 shares is dispensed with, as they represent only
0.59% of the total shareholding of such equity shareholders.
However, all equity shareholders will be entitled to attend the
meeting of the equity shareholders to consider and if thought fit, to
approve the scheme of arrangement and amalgamation. The notice
convening the aforesaid meeting should state that the copies of the
proposed scheme of arrangement and amalgamation and the
statement under Section 393 of the Companies Act, 1956 can be
obtained free of charge from the registered office of the Transferee
company.

14.

The Transferee company has 1 secured creditor and 2

preference shareholders. Both the preference shareholders and the
secured creditor of the applicant company have given their consent in
writing to the scheme of amalgamation, which have been filed for
record.

Therefore, it is just and appropriate to dispense with

convening the meeting of the secured creditors and preference
shareholders of the applicant company to consider the scheme of
amalgamation.

15.

The applicant/Transferee company has 402 unsecured

creditors in all. The applicant has sought the holding of the meeting of
the unsecured creditors for considering and if thought fit, approving
the scheme. Considering the facts and circumstances, the meeting of
the unsecured shareholders of the transferee company, The Jay
Engineering Works Ltd, be held on 26.03.2008 at 2:45 p.m. at the

copies of scheme and statement under Section 393 of the Companies
Act, 1956, shall be sent to the unsecured creditors of the Transferee
company by UPC at their registered or last known addresses at least
21 days before the date appointed for meeting, in their presence or in
the presence of their authorized representatives. The counsel for the
applicant submits that considering the facts and circumstances, the
sending of individual notices to the unsecured creditors falling under
the category of upto Rs. 25,000/- be dispensed with, as they
represent less than 0.7% of the total amount due. Considering the
facts and circumstances, I am of the view that all the unsecured
creditors should be sent the notices of the proposed meeting to
consider the scheme. However, in respect of the unsecured creditors
of the value upto Rs.25,000/-, the detailed scheme and explanatory
statement need not accompany the notice. The notice should,
however,

state

that

the

copies

of

the

proposed

scheme

of

arrangement and amalgamation and the statement under Section
393 of the Companies Act, 1956 can be obtained free of charge from
the registered office of the applicant company. The notice shall be
published in newspapers 'The Statesman' & 'Indian Express' (English
edition) and 'Navbharat Times' (Hindi edition) in terms of the
Companies (Court) Rules, 1959, at least 21 days before the day
appointed for the meeting.

their incidental expenses. The Chairpersons appointed by this Court
shall file their respective reports within two weeks from the date of
holding of the respective meetings. The Alternate Chairpersons shall
also attend the respective meetings and assist the respective
Chairpersons in conducting the meeting and in filing the report.
