approve the scheme of arrangement and amalgamation. The notice
convening the aforesaid meeting should state that the copies of the

shareholders of the applicant company to consider the scheme of
amalgamation.

creditors in all. The applicant has sought the holding of the meeting of

company by UPC at their registered or last known addresses at least

the presence of their authorized representatives. The counsel for the
applicant submits that considering the facts and circumstances, the
sending of individual notices to the unsecured creditors falling under
the category of upto Rs. 25,000/- be dispensed with, as they
represent less than 0.7% of the total amount due. Considering the
facts and circumstances, I am of the view that all the unsecured
creditors should be sent the notices of the proposed meeting to
consider the scheme. However, in respect of the unsecured creditors
of the value upto Rs.25,000/-, the detailed scheme and explanatory
statement need not accompany the notice. The notice should,
however,

state

that

proposed

scheme

of

arrangement and amalgamation and the statement under Section
393 of the Companies Act, 1956 can be obtained free of charge from
the registered office of the applicant company. The notice shall be
