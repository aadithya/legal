VIPIN SANGHI, J.
1.

This petition under section 11 (6) of the Arbitration and

Conciliation Act (The Act) has been filed by the petitioner to seek
reference of its disputes with the respondent to arbitration in terms of
an arbitration agreement contained in the contract agreement number
CWE/PM/N.18/98-99.
2.

It is the admitted position that the parties had entered into

the aforesaid agreement which contains an arbitration agreement in
clause 70 of the IAFW-2249. Under this clause disputes between the
Arb. P. N. 307/2005

Page 1 of 8

parties to the contract shall, other than disputes in respect of which
the decision of the CWE or any other person is, by the contract
expressed to be final and binding, after written notice by either party
to the contract to the other, be referred to the sole arbitration of any
serving officer having degree in engineering or equivalent on having
passed final/direct final examination of subdivision II of Institute of
Surveyor (India) recognized by the Government of India, to be
appointed by the authority mentioned in the tender document.
3.

In relation to the works done by the petitioner under the

aforementioned contract, disputes arose and the petitioner sought
reference of its seven claims to Arbitration. The chief engineer who is
the appointing authority appointed an arbitrator by his communication
dated the 9th
petitioner

September, 2003 in relation to two claims of the

deleting five other claims made by it.

The petitioner

protested against the non-reference of some of its claims by the chief
engineer.
4.

The arbitrator entered upon the reference on the 16th

September, 2003. However, he resigned from the post of arbitrator
vide his communication dated 12th

April, 2004.

The petitioner

thereafter once again requested the chief engineer to refer all his
claims to a new arbitrator vide his communication dated 24th April,
2004 and reminder dated 25th April, 2005 but to no avail.
5.

The petitioner thereafter filed the present application on

Arb. P. N. 307/2005

Page 2 of 8

the 1st September, 2005 in the Court of the District Judge, Delhi which
has been transferred to this Court after the decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of SBP Vs. Patel Engineering.
6.

The respondent in its reply has stated that it has already

appointed a substitute arbitrator on the 21st September 2005.
further stated that the petitioner

It is

had submitted its final bill on 5 th

March, 2001 without any protest. Under the terms of the agreement,
as per condition 65 of the IAFW-2249, no further claim can be made by
the contractor after submission of the final bill and all other claims
shall be deemed to be waived and extinguished. Therefore the claim
of the petitioner for damages could not be referred to arbitration. It is
further stated that the other claims, of which reference was sought by
the petitioner, and which were not referred to Arbitration, the decision
of the CWE is final and binding and therefore not referable to
arbitration under condition 70 of the IAFW-2249. It is claimed that the
earlier appointed Arbitrator had already ruled that the other claims
raised by the petitioner were excepted matter. Counsel for the
respondent also contended in the alternative, that if the court was
inclined to appoint an independent arbitrator in exercise of its power
under section 11 of the Act, the appointee should have the requisite
qualification as is prescribed under the arbitration clause.

7. Cost of Arbitration
30,000.00
One counter claim, of rupees 50,000 towards costs of

arbitration, of the respondent was also referred to arbitration.
10.

Having considered all the submissions of the parties, I am

of the view that the present application deserves to be allowed. The
appointment made by the respondent on 21st September, 2005 is of no
avail, since the petitioner had already filed the present application on
the 1st September, 2005.
11.

Apart from stating that the decision of the CWE is final and

binding in respect of the aforesaid five claims not referred to
arbitration, and that they are excepted matter, the respondent has not
been able to point out as to how it is being so claimed.
12.

The arguments of the respondent primarily stems from

Condition No. 65 of IAFW-2249, which is stated to form part of the
contract. This Clause reads as follows:“ 65 Final Bill (Applicable only to Measurement
and Lump Sum Contracts). The Final Bill shall be
submitted by the Contractor on IAFW-2262 in
duplicate within three months of physical completion
of the works to the satisfaction the Engineer-inArb. P. N. 307/2005

Page 5 of 8

Charge.
It shall be accompanied by all abstracts, vouchers,
etc. supporting it and shall be prepared in the manner
prescribed by the G.E.
No further claims shall be made by the Contractor
after submission of the Final Bill and these shall be
deemed to have been waived and extinguished.
The Contractor shall be entitled to be paid the final
sum less the value of payments already made on
account, subject to the certification of the final bill by
the G.E.
No charges shall be allowed to the Contractor on
account of the preparation of the final bill.”
13.

It is one thing to say that the decision of the CWE on a

particular dispute is final and binding and therefore the same is not
referable to arbitration under Condition No. 70 of the IAFW-2249 being
an excepted matter, and it is quite another thing to say that the claim
is barred under an other provision of the contract, such as Condition
no. 65 aforesaid. The respondent has not brought to my notice any
term of the contract which empowers the CWE to take a final and
binding decision with regard to the applicability and effect of condition
no. 65 as aforesaid.

It cannot be said that the defence that the

respondent may have to the claim of the petitioner
Condition No. 65, dis-entitles the petitioner

based on

from even seeking

reference of its claim to arbitration. It would be for the Arbitrator to
consider the claims, counter claims and the respective defences of the
parties based on the terms and the conditions of the contract, and to

Arb. P. N. 307/2005

Page 6 of 8

interpret and apply the terms of the contract while arriving at his
decision. Prima facie, it cannot be said that the aforesaid 5 claims,
withheld by the respondent and not referred to arbitration constitute
excepted matters.

As submitted by the respondent in their reply, it

would be for the Arbitrator to rule whether he has jurisdiction to
decide a particular dispute or claim.

It could be open to the

respondent to raise all its defences, including those based on
Condition No. 65 as aforesaid and the Arbitrator shall be bound to
arrive at his decision on the basis of the pleadings, the contract, and
by applying the law of the land.
14.

There is no force in the argument that the arbitrator has

ruled that the other five claims of the petitioner are excepted matters.
There is no such decision of the Arbitrator, since he took the view that
he would have jurisdiction only to adjudicate those claims that are
specifically referred to him. (See Arbitrators Letter dated 25th
September 2003). The submission of the respondent that the Court
while making appointment under Section 11 of the Act is bound to
appoint an Arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement between
the parties also does not appear to be correct.
15.

I may only refer to Full Bench Decision of this Court in

HBHL-VKS (JV) Vs. Union of India & Ors. 2007 (1) Arbitration Law
Reporter (Delhi)(FB), wherein the Full Bench has taken view that the
forfeiture of its right by the appointing authority to make the

Arb. P. N. 307/2005

Page 7 of 8

appointment, upon its refusal/failure to make such appointment is
absolute, and the designate of the Chief Justice is thereafter
empowered to make appointment of an independent and impartial
arbitrator with reference to the arbitration agreement. The decision
cited by the respondent in the case of Union of India & Ors. Vs.
M.D. Gupta 2005 (1) Arbitration Law Reporter 368 (SC) is a decision
taken by the Court in the light of Sections 8 & 20 of the Arbitration Act,
1940 and therefore the same is not applicable to the present case
which is governed by the 1996, Act.

However, considering the fact

that the claims raised by the claimant arise out of an Engineering
Contract, I appoint Mr. G. C. Gupta, Retired Engineer-in-Chief, 61,
Munirka Enclave, New Delhi-110067 (Phone 26102284) as the Sole
Arbitrator to adjudicate the claims and counter claims of the parties.
16.

Considering the quantum of the claims and counter claims,

I fix the fees of the arbitrator at Rs.30,000/- to be shared equally by
the parties apart from all other out of pocket expenses.
17.

The application stands allowed.

Parties are left to bear

their respective costs.
