1.

The respondent/workman has filed this application under

Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 read with section
151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 seeking a direction to the
petitioner to pay to the respondent/workman full wages for the period
of pendency of the proceedings before this court

CM No.9821 of 2006 in WP(C) 1805 of 2005

2.

The respondent/applicant contended that the impugned award

directing his reinstatement with back wages was passed on 30 June,
2004 and that he has not been gainfully employed in any
establishment since the date of his illegal termination of his services
and till date he is unemployed and he has no other source of
livelihood.

3.

A reply to the application of the respondent under section 17 B

has been filed on behalf of petitioner/non-applicant wherein the
petitioner contended that

the application of the respondent no.1

under section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is not
maintainable as no proof of averments made in this application has
been produced/filed before this court and the relief prayed therein
cannot be granted. The petitioner has also denied the factum of
unemployment of the respondent. It is contended that it is not
possible for the applicant/respondent to be unemployed since the
termination of his service. It is also asserted that the provision of
section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is not applicable to
the respondent/workman.

4.

Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 comes into

CM No.9821 of 2006 in WP(C) 1805 of 2005

Page 2 of 11

operation when an Award directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in further proceedings by the employer. Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act is as under:"17-B. Payment of full wages to workman pending proceedings
in Higher Courts. - Where in any case a Labour Court, Tribunal
or National Tribunal by its award directs reinstatement of any
workman and the employer prefers any proceedings against
such award in a High Court or the Supreme Court, the employer shall be liable to pay such workman, during the period of
pendency of such proceedings in the High Court or the Supreme
Court, full wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance admissible to him under any rule if the workman had not been employed in any establishment during such
period and an affidavit by such workman had been filed to that
effect in such court :
Provided that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the
High Court or the Supreme Court that such workman had been
employed and had been receiving adequate remuneration during any such period or part thereof, the Court shall order that
no wages hall be payable under this section for such period or
part, as the case may be."

5.

Thus a workman would be entitled for relief under Section 17B

of the Industrial Disputes Act, if there is an award directing reinstatement of the workman and the employer has preferred proceedings
against such award at the High Court or Supreme Court and that the
workman had not been employed in any establishment during the period of pendency of such proceedings and an affidavit to that effect
has been filed by the workman. On satisfaction of the requisites as
laid down under section 17B, the court is bound to grant relief to the

CM No.9821 of 2006 in WP(C) 1805 of 2005

Page 3 of 11

workman in terms of the provision as laid down under section 17B of
the Industrial Disputes Act. The applicant/respondent fulfills all these
requirements and is entitled for relief under section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The learned counsel for the petitioner is unable to explain as to how the said provision is not applicable to the
case of the applicant.

6.

This also cannot be disputed that the Court cannot go into the

merits of the case/writ petition while deciding an application under
section 17B of the Act as was held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD
(Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander. The preliminary consideration for making available such a relief under Section 17B to a workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment, the
spirit, intendment and object underlying which is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship which would be caused to a
workman due to delay in the implementation of an award directing reinstatement of his services on account of the challenge made to it by
the employer. Section 17B recognizes a workman’s right to the bare
minimum to keep the body and soul together when a challenge has
been made to an Award directing his reinstatement. The statutory
provisions provide no inherent right of assailing an order or an award
by an industrial adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment which

CM No.9821 of 2006 in WP(C) 1805 of 2005

Page 4 of 11

is required to be made by the employer to the workman has been held
to be akin to a subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor
recoverable from a workman even if the Award in his favor is set aside
by the High Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (Para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex Court was of the view that the object under
Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a
certain extent, the hardship that is caused to the workman due to the
delay in implementation of the Award.

7.

Granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing orders

directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule; refusing
to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the relief could be
denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional error where
there is no relationship of employer and employee between the parties.

8.

A single Judge of this Court had culled the principles laid down

in various judicial pronouncement for grant of interim relief under
Section 17 B of the Act in 134 (2006) DLT 49, Food Craft Instt. Vs
Rameshwar Sharma & anr. As under:

(i)
An application under Section 17B can be made only
in proceedings wherein an industrial award directing
reinstatement of the workman has been assailed.

CM No.9821 of 2006 in WP(C) 1805 of 2005

Page 5 of 11

(ii)
This Court has no jurisdiction not to direct
compliance with the provisions of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act if all the other conditions
precedent for passing an order in terms of the Section
17B of the Act are satisfied [Re : (1999) 9 SCC 229
entitled Choudhary Sharai v. Executive Engineer,
Panchayati Raj Department & Anr.].
(iii)
As the interim relief is being granted in exercise of
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
the High Court can grant better benefits which may be
more just and equitable on the facts of the case than the
relief contemplated by Section 17B. Therefore, dehors the
powers of the Court under Section 17B, the Court can
pass an order directing payment of an amount higher
than the last drawn wages to the workman [Re : (1999) 2
SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kirtikumar T. Patel].
(iv) Such higher amount has to be considered necessary
in the interest of justice and the workman must plead and
make out a case that such an order is necessary in the
facts of the case.
(v)
The Court can enforce the spirit, intendment and
purpose of legislation that the workman who is to get the
wages from the date of the award till the challenge to the
award is finally decided as per the statement of the
objections
and
reasons
of
the
Industrial
Disputes(Amendment) Act, 1982 by which Section 17B
was inserted in the Act [Re : JT 2001 (Suppl.1) SC 229,
Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam (para 12)].
(vi)
An application under Section 17B should be
disposed of expeditiously and before disposal of the writ
petition [Re : 2000 (9) SCC 534 entitled Workman v.
Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd.].
(vii) Interim relief can be granted with effect from the
date of the Award [Re : JT 2001 Supplementary (1) SC
entitled Regional Authority, Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam;
CM No.9821 of 2006 in WP(C) 1805 of 2005

Page 6 of 11

2004 (3) AD (DELHI) 337 entitled Indra Perfumery
Company v. Sudarshab Oberoi v. Presiding Officer].
(viii) Transient employment and self-employment would
not be a bar to relief under Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act [Re : 2000 (1) LLJ 1012 entitled Taj Services
Limited v. Industrial Tribunal; 1984 (4) SCC 635 entitled
Rajinder Kumar Kundra v. Delhi Administration; 109
(2004) DLT 1 entitled M/s. Birdhi Chand Naunag Ram
Jain v. P.O., Labour Court No. IV & Others].
(ix) The Court while considering an application under
Section 17B of the ID Act cannot go into the merits of the
case, the Court can only consider whether the
requirements mentioned in Section 17B have been
satisfied or not and, if it is so, then the Court has no
option but to direct the employer to pass an order in
terms of the statute. It would be immaterial as to whether
the petitioner had a very good case on merits [Re : 2000
(5) AD Delhi 413 entitled Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander].
(x) A reasonable standard for arriving at the conclusion
of the quantum of a fair amount towards subsistence
allowance payable to a workman would be the minimum
wages notified by the statutory authorities under the
provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 in respect of
an employee who may be performing the same or similar
functions in scheduled employments. [Re: Rajinder
Kumar Kundra v. Delhi Administration, (1984) 4 SCC
635; Sanjit Roy v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1983 SC 328;
decision dated 3rd January, 2003 in Writ Petition (Civil)
Nos. 3654 & 3675/1999 entitled Delhi Council for Child
Welfare v. Union of India; DTC v. The P.O., Labour Court
No. 1, Delhi & Ors., 2002 II AD (Delhi) 112 (para 12, 13)]
(xi) Interim orders directing payment to a workman can
be made even on the application of the management
seeking stay of the operation and effect of the industrial
Award and order. Such interim orders of stay sought by
the employer can be granted unconditionally or made
CM No.9821 of 2006 in WP(C) 1805 of 2005

Page 7 of 11

conditional subject to payment or deposits of the entire or
portion of the awarded amount together with a direction
to the petitioner employer to make payment of the wages
at an appropriate rate to the workman. Such an order
would be based on considerations of interests of justice
when balancing equities.
(xii)
For the same reason, I find that there is no
prohibition in law to a direction by the Court to make an
order directing payment of the wages with effect from the
date of the Award. On the contrary, it has been so held in
several judgments that this would be the proper course
[Re : Regional Authority, Dena Bank & Anr. v.
Ghanshyam, reported at JT 2001 (Suppl. 1) SC 229 and
Indra Perfumery Co. Thr. Sudershab Oberoi v. Presiding
Officer & Ors., 2004 III AD (Delhi) 337].
(xiii) While passing an interlocutory direction for payment
of wages, the Court may also secure the interests of the
employer by making orders regarding refund or recovery
of the amount which is in excess of the last drawn wages
in the event of the industrial award being set aside so as
to do justice to the employer.
(xiv) A repayment to the employer could be secured by
directing a workman to given an undertaking or offer
security to the satisfaction of the Registrar (General) of
the Court or any other authority [Re : para 12, 2002 (61)
DRJ 521 (DB), Hindustan Carbide Pvt. Ltd. v. Govt. of
NCT of Delhi & Ors.(supra)]
(xv) In exercise of powers under Article 226 and Article
136 of the Constitution, if the requisites of Section 17B of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are satisfied, no order
can be passed denying the workman the benefit granted
under the statutory provisions of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 [Re: 1999 (2) SCC 106,
Dena Bank v. Kirtikumar T. Patel (para 23)].
(xvi) Gainful employment of the workman; unreasonable
CM No.9821 of 2006 in WP(C) 1805 of 2005

Page 8 of 11

and unexplained delay in making the application by the
workman after the filing of the petition challenging the
award/order; offer by the employer to give employment to
the workman would be a relevant factors and
consideration for the date from which the wages are to be
permitted.
(xvii)It will be in the interest of justice to ensure if the
facts of the case so justify, that payment of the amount
over and above the amount which could be directed to be
paid under Section 17B to a workman, is ordered to be
paid only on satisfaction of terms and conditions as would
enable the employer to recover the same [para 13 of
Regional Manager, Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam].
(xviii)The same principles would apply to any interim
order in respect of a pendent lite payment in favour of the
workman.

9.

In the present case the workman has categorically averred that

an award dated 30th June, 2004 directing his reinstatement was
passed by the Labour Court which has been challenged by the
petitioner and that he has not been gainfully employed in any
establishment since the date of termination of his services. Apart from
bald denial of this fact nothing has been placed on record by the
petitioner to negate the plea of unemployment of the respondent. Also
whether the award has been passed in accordance with law and
whether the petitioner is entitled for reinstatement is to be
adjudicated at the time of final disposal of the writ petition and that
these questions cannot be gone into at the stage of deciding the

CM No.9821 of 2006 in WP(C) 1805 of 2005

Page 9 of 11

application under section 17B of the Act. The Court while deciding an
application under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act can only
consider whether the requirements mentioned therein have been
satisfied and if the requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 are satisfied, no order can be passed denying the workman
the benefit of statutory provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947.

10.

In the facts and circumstances, the applicant fulfills the

requisites for availing the benefit under section 17B of the Act.
Consequently, the application of the respondent is allowed.

The

petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or minimum wages
whichever is higher from the date of the award, i.e. 30th June, 2004.
Arrears of last drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher be
paid within eight weeks. The petitioner shall continue to pay last
drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher to the
respondent by the 10th of every English calendar month. The
respondent is also directed to file an undertaking that in case this writ
petition is allowed, the respondent shall return/refund the difference
of last drawn wages and minimum wages within such time as will be
permitted by this Court. The undertaking by the respondent be filed
within eight weeks. With these directions, the application is disposed
of.
