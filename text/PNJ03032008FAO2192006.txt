PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Before hearing learned counsel for the parties I met

the parties in chamber in presence of Master Anish and Master
Siddhant.
2.

The elder son Master Anish has shown extreme

hostility towards his father and in presence of his father has
given specific incidents of his father having assaulted not only
his mother but even him.

FAO No.219/06

Details of the assault have been

page 1 of 7

given by Master Anish. After initially denying having assaulted
his wife and Master Anish, the respondent attempted to argue
out with Master Anish that he was provoked into so doing.
3.

Master Siddhant has hardly any memories of his

father for the reason over 7 years back the parents separated
and since then he has been living happily with his mother.
4.

Master Anish was born on 24.1.1991. He is aged 17

years and 1 month.

Issue of his custody would lose all

meaning after 11 months.

Master Siddhant was born on

24.6.1996. He is aged 11 years and 8 months.
5.
is

The issue which concerns me in the instant appeal
the

order

dated

3.8.2006

passed

by

the

learned

Guardianship Judge directing appellant to hand over custody of
both children to the respondent, who as father, claimed
custody of the children.
6.

Reason given by the learned Guardianship Judge is

that the appellant did not defend the petition. She did not file
the written

statement.

She never cross-examined

the

respondent.
7.

In para 8, learned Judge has noted that his

predecessor had examined the children in chamber and that
the children informed the Judge their disinclination to be with
their father. However, learned Guardianship Judge has opined
FAO No.219/06

page 2 of 7

that since children were residing with their mother for a long
time they could have been tutored.
8.

I may note that during chamber hearing, confronted

with the situation as afore-noted, I enquired from the
respondent whether he is agreeable to have visitation rights.
The respondent stated in the negative and insisted upon the
custody of his children.
9.

The appellant as also the children informed me that

the respondent has refused to pay maintenance directed to be
paid vide order dated 9.11.2001 passed by the learned
Matrimonial Judge as also another order dated 18.11.2003
passed by another Matrimonial Judge.
10.

Under

the

first

order,

monthly

maintenance

awarded to the wife is in sum of Rs.2,500/-. The same has to
be paid with effect from 27.3.2000. Under second order dated
18.12.2003, monthly maintenance awarded is Rs.3,000/- with
effect from 8.7.2003.
11.

I note that the first order was passed in a petition

filed by the wife which has since been dismissed. The second
order has been passed in a petition filed by the husband
seeking divorce.

12.

Both children are conscious of the fact that due to

their father not paying a penny for their maintenance they are
deprived of the comforts of life.
13.

The wife is working as an Assistant in the National

Insurance Company. The respondent is likewise working and
as per order dated 18.12.2003 is placed in the pay-scale of
Rs.6,500 â€“ 10,500 with gross emoluments at Rs.14,205/- as of
July 2003.
14.

I tried to reason it out with the respondent that if he

pays some money for the benefit of his children he would earn
their love and regards for him.

The respondent responded

saying that he has taken loan from his friends to pay for Flat
No.G-5/6, Sector-15, Rohini, New Delhi and is repaying the
same and hence has no money to spare.
15.

It is unfortunate that the respondents wants to eat

his cake and have it too.
16.

It is unfortunate that the respondent is not willing to

pay any money to his wife who is single handedly bringing up
the two children.
17.

Turning to the merits of the controversy, pertaining

to Master Anish, no useful purpose would be served in handing
over his custody to the respondent for the reason after 11
FAO No.219/06

page 4 of 7

months Master Anish would be free from the bondage of
minority. He would be free to decide for himself.
18.

Master Anish is a young boy aged 17 years. In my

opinion,

form

reasonable

opinions

of

matters

Having spoken to the parties in the

chamber I am of the opinion that there is no question of Master
Anish being tutored.
19.

I note that Master Anish gave specific references to

incidents of being beaten by his father, to which, after initial
denials, respondent made virtual admissions.
20.

If Anish has to stay with his mother I see no reason

why Master Siddhant should not stay with his mother for the
reason the brothers are well bonded and to separate the two
would be unfair and unjust to both.
21.

My further reason is that Master Siddhant could not

be tutored to say anything for the reason he said nothing. He
only told the Court that he has no memories of his father.
Indeed, the children parted company with their father 7 years
ago.

Master Siddhant has truthfully told to this Court the

reason for not joining company of his father, being that, he is
happy to live with his elder brother and his mother.
22.

Proceedings relatable to guardianship or custody

have to focus on the interest of the children as the primary
FAO No.219/06

page 5 of 7

concern of the Court. These litigations have not to be treated
as an ordinary lis between a husband and a wife.

Lack or

absence of pleadings or cross-examination recede in the
background when children are prima facie opined to be
forming intelligible opinions. Further, the job of the Court is to
satisfy itself that the children are not being tutored. Attendant
circumstances, like welfare of the children, means of either
spouse to give good education to the children etc. has to be
kept in mind.
23.

Considering the totality of the circumstances I am of

the opinion that the impugned order dated 3.8.2006 needs to
be quashed.
24.

I do so accordingly.

25.

On the issue of visitation rights, unfortunately due

to the obstinate stand of the respondent who refused to pay
any maintenance to his wife, resulting in the children telling
the Court that if their father does not want to pay even a
penny for their well-being they would not even like to meet
their father, I have no option but to deny even visitation rights
to the respondent.

However, if the respondent pays the

maintenance awarded to his wife and children and on children
being informed of the same, on proof of compliance of the
orders passed by the learned Metropolitan Judge it would be
FAO No.219/06

page 6 of 7

open to the respondent to move an application in the instant
petition praying that at least visitation rights be granted to
him.
26.

Appeal stands disposed of quashing impugned order

dated 3.8.2006.
27.

The petition filed by the respondent seeking custody

of Master Anish and Master Siddhant is dismissed.
28.

No costs.
