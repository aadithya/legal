CM No.5773/2007 in W.P(C) No.1045/2006

1.

This is an application filed by the respondent/workman under

Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking direction to
the petitioner to pay to the respondent/workman wages as per the
minimum wages as applicable from the date of the order and during
the pendency of the writ petition.

2.

The respondent/applicant contended that he has not been

CM No.5773/2007 in W.P(C) No.1045/2006

Page 1 of 7

gainfully employed since 30th April, 1997, the date of termination of
his services by the petitioner and that he has not been able to get any
employment in any establishment. It was further stated that the
respondent has no other source of livelihood, consequently, the
respondent and his family members are facing extreme hardship and
mental torture. According to the respondent he is entitled to be paid
full salary including the revised pay scales as per the Fifth Pay
Commission report.

3.

A reply to the application of the respondent under section 17 B

has been filed on behalf of petitioner/non-applicant wherein the
petitioner denied the averments made by the respondent in the
application. The petitioner contended that the employment of the
respondent was contractual and that his services were terminated due
to non renewal of the contract and therefore the respondent cannot
claim for regularization/equal status in terms of the pay scale given to
the

regular

workman.

The

petitioner

negated

the

factum

of

unemployment of the respondent on the ground that being a skilled
workman, the respondent would not have remained unemployed
during the pendency of the proceedings and reliance was placed on
impugned award dated 13th September, 2004 wherein denying
backwages, the Labor Court observed that “keeping in view that
workman was skilled driver, it can be presumed that he would not

CM No.5773/2007 in W.P(C) No.1045/2006

Page 2 of 7

have remained unemployed for long period and therefore no directions
are made for backwages”.

4.

The respondent has filed a rejoinder to the reply of the

petitioner denying the submissions made therein, the respondents
have reiterated the averments made in the application.

5.

The preliminary consideration for making available such a

relief under Section 17B to a workman is to be found in the
benevolent purpose of the enactment, the spirit, intendment and
object underlying which is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent,
the hardship which would be caused to a workman due to delay in
the implementation of an award directing reinstatement of his
services on account of the challenge made to it by the employer.
Section 17B recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to
keep the body and soul together when a challenge has been made to
an Award directing his reinstatement. The statutory provisions
provide no inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an
industrial adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment which is
required to be made by the employer to the workman has been held to
be akin to a subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor
recoverable from a workman even if the Award in his favor is set aside
by the High Court.

In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (Para 22), Dena Bank v.

CM No.5773/2007 in W.P(C) No.1045/2006

Page 3 of 7

Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex Court was of the view that the object
under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to
relieve to a certain extent, the hardship that is caused to the
workman due to the delay in implementation of the Award.

6.

Perusal of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

reveals that it comes into operation when an Award directing
reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further proceedings by the
employer. The statute requires satisfaction of the following four
conditions:
(i)

(ii)

during the pendency of such proceedings, employer
is required to pay full wages to the workman;

(iii)

the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any
maintenance allowance admissible to him under
any Rule;

(iv)

7.

an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in proceedings in a High Court or the
Supreme Court;

such wages would be admissible only if the
workman had not been employed in any
establishment during such period and an affidavit
had been filed to such effect.

The other question is whether the applicant would be entitled

for last drawn wages or something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 Town
Municipal, Athani v. P.O. LC Hugli & Ors, it was held by the Apex
Court that a workman has a legal right to wages under the Minimum
CM No.5773/2007 in W.P(C) No.1045/2006

Page 4 of 7

Wages Act, 1948 and cannot be diverted to a remedy under Section 20
of the Minimum Wages Act for enforcing such right. In this case, the
Apex Court was concerned with the power of the Act under Section
33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the principles laid
down by the Court would have a bearing on the issues raised before
this

Court

as

well.

From

a

conspectus

of

the

authoritative

pronouncements of the Apex Court, the right of a workman to an
amount equivalent to the wages notified under the Minimum Wages
Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the constitutional mandate
and nothing more. It is undoubtedly, the bare minimum wages which
is required by the workman to subsist and is nothing more. Full
wages last drawn can therefore only mean all the wages that have
fallen due atleast from the date of the Award.

8.

Granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing orders

directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule; refusing
to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the relief could
be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional error
where there is no relationship of employer and employee exists
between the parties.

9.

Thus under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, there

has to be an award directing reinstatement of the workman and the

CM No.5773/2007 in W.P(C) No.1045/2006

Page 5 of 7

court has to ascertain whether the workman was gainfully employed
in any establishment and once the court comes to the conclusion that
the workman was not gainfully employed in any establishment then
the court is bound to grant relief to the workman in terms of the
provision. Also the Court cannot go into the merits of the case/writ
petition while deciding an application under section 17B as was held
in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish
Chander.

10.

In the present case the workman has categorically averred that

he has not been gainfully employed in any establishment since the
date of termination of his services. Apart from bald denial of this fact
nothing has been placed on record by the petitioner to establish the
employment of the respondent after the termination of his services.
Therefore, merely on the basis of presumption, that being a skilled
driver the workman/respondent could not have remained unemployed
for long, the relief under section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 cannot be denied.

11.

In the facts and circumstances, the applicant fulfills the criteria

for availing the benefit under section 17B of the Act and in exercise of
powers under Article 226 of the Constitution if the requisites of
Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are satisfied, no

CM No.5773/2007 in W.P(C) No.1045/2006

Page 6 of 7

order can be passed denying the workman the benefit of statutory
provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

12.

Consequently, the application of the workman/respondent

under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is allowed and
the petitioner is directed to pay the arrears of last drawn wages or
minimum wages whichever is higher from the date of award dated 13th
September, 2004. Arrears of last drawn wages or the minimum wages
whichever is higher be paid within eight weeks. The petitioner shall
continue to pay last drawn wages or the minimum wages whichever is
higher by the 10th of every month. Respondent shall also file an
undertaking that in case the writ petition is allowed the difference of
minimum

wages

and

the

last

drawn

wages

shall

be

returned/refunded within the time allowed by this Court. The
undertaking to this effect be filed by the respondent/applicant within
two weeks. With these directions the application is disposed of.
W.P.(C) No.1045/2006
The learned counsel for the petitioner seeks time to file
the rejoinder. Rejoinder be filed within eight weeks.
