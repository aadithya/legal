The petitioner seeks a direction that provisions of the Public Premsies Act, 1971 cannot

be invoked against it. It is occupant of a portion of premises at 8, Lady Harding Road, Shaheed
Bhagat Singh Marg, New Delhi.

The petitioner claims to be a tenant of the premises, having secured it from the lessee.

3.

Notice was issued in these proceedings, limited to the question of maintainability of the

proceedings, on 18th March, 2007. The respondents had not filed their reply; the case was heard
and reserved for orders, on 26th November, 2007. Thereafter, the petitioner apparently filed an
affidavit in the registry of this court, which could not be placed on record; a copy of the same,
dated 13-12-2007 was sought to be placed on record. In this it was averred that the orders of the
lessor Government of India, were questioned by the lessee, one Shri Arjun Dev, in WP
2590/1995. Consequently, this court called for the file in that case, to ascertain the correctness of
the assertions. The petitioner in those proceedings has claimed various reliefs, which if granted
would amount to conversion of the leasehold rights into freehold; the property in question in that
petition is the same as the suit property in this case.

4.

In view of the above facts, to avoid any conflict in decisions and to secure ends of justice,

this court is of the opinion that the present writ petition should be released from the category of
causes or cases reserved for judgment. Directed accordingly. The registry is further directed to
list this petition along with WP 2590/2005, on the date of hearing scheduled for that petition, ie.
18th January, 2008, before the appropriate bench according to the roster, subject to directions of
the Honâ€™ble Chief Justice.
