BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J
1.
The petitioners are manufacturers and / or importers of fertilizers
including Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP). The petitioners contend that by a
circular dated 05.03.1997, issued by the Central Government, it was notified
that the concession in respect of, inter alia, DAP would be Rs 3,750/- per
tonne for indigenous DAP and Rs 2,250/- per tonne for imported DAP. By
virtue of this circular, it was also notified that these revised rates of
concession would be effective from 01.04.1997 and all stocks held and
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.1 of 19

actually sold on or after 01.04.1997 would be eligible for the enhanced
compensation. The circular also indicated that the Government had decided to
continue the scheme of concession on sale of decontrolled phosphatic and
potassic fertilizers to farmers during 1997-1998 (01.04.97 to 31.03.98) on the
existing pattern at the revised rates indicated above for, inter alia, DAP.

2.

By virtue of another circular issued by the Government of India on

03.02.1998 (the circular impugned herein) it was notified that the Government
had decided that the rates of concession during the Rabi season 1997-98,
which would be effective from 01.10.1997 to 31.03.1998, in respect of DAP,
would be Rs 3,500/- per tonne for indigenous DAP and Rs 2,000/- per tonne
for imported DAP. The consequence of this circular dated 03.02.1998 is that
the rate of concession notified by the earlier circular dated 05.03.1997 has
been reduced by Rs 250/- per tonne in respect of both indigenous and
imported DAP. The second consequence is that the circular was issued on
03.02.1998 and would have retrospective effect

from 01.10.1997 to

31.03.1998.

3.

The petitioners are aggrieved by the issuance of the circular dated

03.02.1998 whereby the rates of concession have been reduced by Rs 250/per tonne in respect of both indigenous and imported DAP. This writ petition
has been filed and pressed by the petitioners, as indicated in the order dated
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.2 of 19

27.03.1998 passed by this court, only on the ground of promissory estoppel.
The plea of the petitioners is that the government of India made a clear and
unequivocal statement that the rates of concession in respect of DAP would be
Rs 3,750/- per tonne for indigenous DAP and Rs 2,250/- per tonne for
imported DAP. It is also contended by the petitioners that these rates of
concession were notified for the entire year 1997-1998 i.e., for the entire
period 01.04.1997 to 31.03.1998. The petitioners say that, acting on the basis
of these declared rates of concession, they made arrangements for the entire
year which included both the Kharif (April to September) and the Rabi
seasons (October to March). They had, therefore, acted on the basis of the
representation made in the circular dated 05.03.1997. Having so altered their
position and made commitments for importation etc, it was not open to the
Government to change rates of concession in the course of 1997-98 itself and
that too by a circular dated 03.02.1998 having virtually retrospective effect
from 01.10.1997. It is on the basis of this that the plea of promissory estoppel
has been advanced on behalf of the petitioners.

4.

On the other hand, the respondent contends that the principle of

promissory estoppel would not be applicable. This is based on the contention
that the circular dated 05.03.1997 was not a clear and unequivocal
representation that the rates of concession would remain the same throughout
the year. It was also contended that the issue of revision in the rates of
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.3 of 19

concession were considered by an Empowered Committee and it is only
thereafter and that too for the Rabi season that the rates have been reduced. It
was also contended that the reduction in the rates had been necessitated by
changes in the international market as a result of which the rates of
concession, if maintained, would have meant unjust enrichment for the
importers / manufacturers such as the petitioners herein. It was submitted that
the reduction in the rates of concession have actually meant that there would
be savings of approximately Rs 110 crores of public money. Principally on
these grounds, the plea of promissory estoppel was resisted.

5.

To appreciate the arguments advanced by the counsel for the

parties, it would be necessary to indicate the chronology of events in
somewhat greater detail.

6.

Prior to 1992, DAP and other complex fertilizers were covered

under the Retention Price Scheme falling within the ambit of the fertilizers
control order issued under the provisions of Essential Commodities Act 1955.
DAP and other complex fertilizers were decontrolled on 25.08.1992 and the
Statutory Price Control as well as the subsidy cover were withdrawn. This
meant that the manufacturers could fix their own prices for the fertilizers.
This, in turn, led to a sharp increase in the consumer prices of fertilizers. To
curb this, the Central Government introduced the scheme of subsidy given to
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.4 of 19

the manufacturers in the form of concession. Under this concession scheme,
the State Governments fixed the selling price of fertilizers.

If the

manufacturers / importers sold fertilizers at the Government determined prices
then they became eligible to receive a concession of a fixed amount
determined by the government from time to time. The object being that the
concession would enable the manufacturers and or importers to recover
whatever loss they may have suffered due to the sale of the fertilizers at the
pre-determined Government price which may have been lower than the costs
incurred by them. Apparently, this practice was continued for the years 199394, 1994-95 and 1995-96 and the Government followed the practice of
announcing the rates of concession on an yearly basis in advance so as to
enable the manufacturers / importers to plan their production/imports for the
entire year.

7.

On 21.02.1997 the Minister of Agriculture made a statement

before the Parliament with regard to the price policy on fertilizers. In this
statement he indicated that it had been decided to further increase the
concessions on phosphatic and potassic fertilizers during 1997-98. It was
also indicated that the increase in concession for DAP would be Rs 750/- per
tonne and that the revised concessions would be applicable from 01.04.1997.
The existing rates of DAP at that point of time were Rs 3,000/- per tonne for
indigenous DAP and Rs 1500/- per tonne for imported DAP.
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.5 of 19

8.

Thereafter, on 05.03.1997 the circular indicating the revised rates

of concession of, inter alia, DAP was issued by the Government of India. As
already noted above, the revised rates were Rs 3750/- per tonne for indigenous
DAP and Rs 2,250/- per tonne for imported DAP. Since, this circular is being
pressed by the petitioners, as constituting an unequivocal representation, it
would be proper to set out the material portion thereof :
“THE REVISED RATES will be EFFECTIVE FROM
IST APRIL 1997 AND ALL STOCKS HELD AND
ACTUALLY SOLD ON OR AFTER IST APRIL 1997
WILL
BE
ELIGIBLE
FOR
ENHANCED
CONCESSION.
GOVERMENT HAS ALSO DECIDED TO
CONTINUE THE SCHEME OF CONCESSION ON
SALE OF DECONTROLLED PHOSPHATIC AND
POTASSIC FERTILIZERS TO THE FARMERS
DURING 1997-1998 (1.4.97 TO 31.3.1998) ON
EXISTING PATTERN AT THE REVISED RATES
INDICATED ABOVE FOR DAP COMMA MOP
COMMA SSP AND INDIGENOUS COMPLEXES IN
ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDELINES ISSUED VIDE
LETTER NO. 1-10/94-FD DATED 7TH SEPTEMBER
1994(.)”

9.

On 12.03.1997 the same decision was conveyed to all the State

governments by the Central Government. Copies of the same were also sent
to the manufacturers. A communication dated 28.03.1997 was also sent by
the Central Government to all the Chief Secretaries of State Governments /
Union Territories. In this communication also the revision in the rates of
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.6 of 19

concession was reiterated and it was directed that the revised rates would be
effective from 01.04.1997 onwards and cautioned the State Governments that
no manufacturer / supplier ought to get benefit of double concession on the
same quantities i.e., on the old rates as well as on the enhanced rates.

10.

On

18.06.1997

the

Central

Government

sent

a

further

communication to all the State Governments indicating that manufacturers /
suppliers of DAP would be eligible for 80% on account payment and that the
balance 20% would be released on receipt of verification of 100% claims in
proforma

`B'

from

the

State

Governments

and

Union

Territory

Administrations. On 24.09.1997 a meeting of the Empowered Committee
under the Chairmanship of the Secretary, Department of Agriculture and
Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India was held.

The

meeting was also attended by a representative of the Fertilizer Association of
India. In this meeting there was a debate with regard to the reduction in the
concession. In the Minutes of the Meeting, there is discussion that there was a
suggestion of reduction in the concession for imported DAP by Rs 250/- per
tonne. There was also a suggestion for a reduction of Rs 450/- per tonne. The
Chairman had indicated that when the cost of indigenous DAP was fixed at Rs
12,050/- for Kharif 1997, the price of ammonia had been taken at $220 per
tonne. He stated that it was known then that the price of ammonia was
declining and the cost would be required to be adjusted on the basis of the
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.7 of 19

actual cost of Ammonia. It was also suggested that the cost be adjusted in the
Rabi 1997-98 season though there was no need to change the price at which
the fertilizers would be available to the farmers and any adjustment that
should be made ought to be only with regard to the subsidy amount. A view
was also taken that while the cost of production was not to be calculated in
very precise terms as in the retention price-cum-subsidy scheme, but the
declining prices of ammonia could not be ignored. However, in the minutes
itself it was noted that after prolonged discussion there was no agreement on
the proposal to reduce the concession for indigenous and imported DAP. But
there was a consensus amongst the members of the Empowered Committee
that there should be no change in the price of DAP.

11.

On 07.10.1997 the Central Government sent a communication to

all the State Governments notifying the maximum retail prices of, inter alia,
DAP as Rs .8,300/- per tonne for the Rabi 1997-98 season. These maximum
retail prices were the same as that notified in the Kharif 1997 season. The
communication, however, carried the following sentences also :“In regard to rates of concession on above fertilizers orders
will issue shortly”

12.

On 02.02.1998 the Government of India issue a press note which,

inter alia, indicated that the Government had decided that the concession on

WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.8 of 19

indigenous DAP which was Rs 3,750/- per tonne and on imported DAP which
was Rs 2,250/- per tonne would now be paid at the rate of Rs 3,500/- and Rs
2,000/- per tonne on indigenous and imported DAP, respectively, to
manufacturers and importers for the sale of these fertilizers during the Rabi
1997-98 season from 1.10.97 to 31.3.98. This was followed by the impugned
circular of 03.02.1998 to the same effect.

13.

The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that while

construing the above factual position, certain other facts have also to be kept
in mind. It was pointed out that before the circular of 05.03.1997, which is
heavily relied upon by the petitioner, an order dated 04.03.1997 was issued by
the Ministry of Agriculture. By virtue of this order dated 04.03.1997 the
constitution of an Empowered Committee under the Chairmanship of the
Secretary (Agriculture and Cooperation) was notified. The terms of reference
of the Committee were as under :
“i)

To indicate reasonable prices in respect of decontrolled
phosphatic and potassic fertilizers (P&K), whether dervied
from straight sources or through complexes.

ii)

The Committee may decide upon marginal adjustments in
the incremental concessions on P&K fertilizers that may be
necessary.

iii)

The Committee may formulate a scheme for funding the
extra cost of transportation to move fertilizers to more
difficult areas i.e., parts of J&K and North Eastern States
including Sikkim, to be met out of the concessional
scheme.”

WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.9 of 19

(Underlining added)

14.

It was pointed out that there are two important factors which have

to be kept in mind with regard to the order of 04.03.1997. The first factor was
that the Committee could decide upon “marginal adjustments” in the
incremental concessions on P&K fertilizers that may be necessary.

The

second factor was that the representative of the Fertilizer Association of India
was also taken in as a member of the Empowered Committee.
15.

It was also pointed out in the meeting of the Empowered

Committee held on 19.08.1997, where a representative of the Fertilizer
Association of India was also present, by the Secretary (Fertilizer) that it
would be advisable to maintain the same prices of fertilizers as was decided
for the Kharif 1997 season insofar as the Rabi 1997-98 season was concerned.
It was also submitted by him that any adjustments required to be made on the
basis of cost evaluation could be effected in the rate of concession for the said
fertilizers while ensuring proper return to manufacturers.

16.

On the basis of the aforesaid factual position, the learned counsel

for the petitioners submitted that the principle of promissory estoppel was
applicable in the present case. According to him, the respondent had made a
clear and unequivocal representation that rates of concession announced by
virtue of the circular dated 05.03.1997 would be the same throughout the year
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.10 of 19

1997-98 covering the entire period 01.04.1997 to 31.03.1998. The petitioners
had acted on the basis of this representation and planned out their imports /
manufactures accordingly. Therefore, according to the learned counsel for the
petitioners, the respondent was estopped from altering the rates of concession
and the circular dated 03.02.1998 was liable to be set aside. In support of the
plea of promissory estoppel, the learned counsel for the petitioners referred to
the following decisions :
1. Moti Lal Padampat Sugar Mills v State of U.P. : (1979) 2 SCC
409
2. Godfrey Philips v Union of India : 1985 (4) SCC 369
3. National Buildings construction Corporation v S Raghunathan
: (1998) 7 SCC 66
The learned counsel for the petitioners also submitted that the plea of
promissory estoppel cannot be defeated as there is no statutory provision
which comes in the way of such a plea in the present case.

17.

On behalf of the respondent, it was contended that for promissory

estoppel to apply, the representation must be firm and unequivocal.
According to the learned counsel for the respondent, the rates of concession
notified by the circular dated 05.03.1997 were subject to marginal adjustments
as the terms of reference of the Empowered committee, referred to above,
itself disclosed.

WP(C)1503/1998

Therefore, there was no representation that the rates of

Page No.11 of 19

concession mentioned in the circular of 05.03.1997 would remain the same
throughout the year 1997-98 period. It was next contended by the learned
counsel for the respondent that the petitioners have only stated that they had
contracted for Phosphatic Acid for the whole year and there is no such
submission with regard to Ammonia. It is ammonia which is relevant for the
purpose of DAP. It is on account of the fall in the price of ammonia that the
reduction in the rates of concession of DAP was necessitated. He submitted
that when rates of concession were fixed on 05.03.1997, the DAP prices had
also been fixed at Rs 12,050/- per tonne for the Kharif 1997 season. The
price of ammonia, at that point of time, was taken to be $220 per tonne. But
the prices never reached $220 per tonne and, in fact, the prices of ammonia
were far below $ 220 per tonne and were declining. Since it was decided that
the consumer price of DAP was to be maintained, retaining the same rates of
concession would have meant an undue bonanza for the manufacturers /
importers. By the reduction in the rates of concession, as indicated by the
circular dated 03.02.1998, the State has been able to save approximately Rs
110 crores of public money which would have otherwise fallen in the kitty of
the private manufacturers / suppliers.

18.

It was also contended on behalf of the respondent that a

representative of the Fertilizer Association of India was a member of the
Empowered committee. The brief of the Empowered Committee included the
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.12 of 19

question of marginal adjustments in the rates of concession if the situation so
warranted. It was also contended that on 07.10.1997 when the government
indicated its decision to maintain the maximum retail prices of DAP for the
Rabi season at the same level as that of the Kharif season, it was made clear
that the rates of concession would issue shortly. It was also contended that
when 80% on-account payment was stopped in October, 1997, this was yet
another signal that the concession rates would be reduced.

19.

In sum, it was submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent

that the plea of promissory estoppel cannot be sustained inasmuch as there
was no unequivocal promise in respect of a particular rate of concession.
Moreover, the Fertilizer Association of India participated through its
representative in the deliberations of the Empowered Committee and this in
itself indicated that the industry knew very well that the rates of concession
could vary.

20.

It was also contended that the decision to reduce the rates of

concession was not arbitrary but was based on reason and was brought about
after due deliberation. The same also amounted in the saving of public money
It was also contended that no detriment has been even pleaded by the
petitioners with regard to ammonia and all the Letters of Intent that have been
placed at pages 28-30 of the paper book relate to Phosphatic Acid. There has
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.13 of 19

been no change with regard to Phosphatic Acid and no detriment has been
pleaded with regard to ammonia, which is the constituent of DAP and on the
basis of which the reduction in the rates of concession have been necessitated.
Lastly, it was contended that, in any event, this was a policy matter and price
fixation was clearly within the domain of the Government.

21.

In rejoinder, the learned counsel for the petitioners reiterated that

the promise and/or representation that was made was clear and unequivocal.
He submitted that the Minister's statement was a clear statement. It was
clearly indicated that the rates of concession would be reduced and would be
applicable from 01.04.1997. The Circular Dated 05.03.1997 also made it
clear that the rates were applicable for the entire years 01.04.1997 to
31.03.1998.

22.

It was also submitted that the only adjustments that could be made

had to fall within the ambit of marginal adjustments as per the terms of
reference of the Empowered Committee. Moreover, such adjustments were to
operate prospectively and not retrospectively. It was also submitted that the
scheme had been functioning well for several years and the Government had
honoured its commitments in the previous years except in the present year. It
was also contended that if adjustments were called for on the basis of change
in costs then the manufacturers ought to be permitted to ask for alteration in
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.14 of 19

the prices. If they cannot ask for alteration in the prices then the Government
also ought not to be permitted to alter the rates of concession.

In this

background, it was also submitted that the fall in the price of ammonia was
irrelevant as according to the learned counsel for the petitioners, the costs
were not relevant. With regard to the plea of unjust enrichment, it was
submitted that while the price of ammonia fell, the price of Phosphatic Acid
increased more than two times. It was also contented that ammonia constituted
only about 14.5 per cent of the total costs. It was then contended that during
the relevant period the rupee depreciated as against the U.S.$ and although the
dollar price of Phosphatic Acid may have remained the same, because of the
depreciation, the rupee price increased.

The Railway freight

price also

increased in October by about 15 %.

It was also submitted that after

considering all these factors, the costs of DAP in October, 1997 would be
around Rs 9619.50 per tonne whereas in March, it was estimated to be around
Rs 9256/- per tonne. If the concession had not been given then the
manufacturers / suppliers would have incurred heavy losses. It was also
pointed out that in the next season, that is, commencing on 01.04.1998, the
concession was again enhanced to Rs 4,400/-. And this enhancement in the
rates of concession were based on the cost data of 1997-98 as indicated in the
counter affidavit at page 191 of the paper book. The learned counsel for the
petitioners submitted that therefore, the petition was liable to be allowed as
prayed for.
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.15 of 19

23.

There is no doubt that the rates of concession were notified on

05.03.1997 as being Rs 3,750/- for indigenous DAP and Rs 2,250/- for
imported DAP. The language of the circular as also the Minister's statement
which preceded the same are, to my mind, unequivocal. The Government had
decided to continue the scheme of concession

on sale of decontrolled

phosphatic and potassic fertilizers to farmers during 1997-98 (01.04.97 to
31.03.98) on the existing pattern “at the revised rates indicated” in the said
circular of 05.03.1997. There is no doubt in my mind that this would amount
to a representation that rates of concession were for the entire year 01.04.1997
to 31.03.1998. But, at the same time, it was also known to the industry, which
includes the petitioners herein, that an Empowered Committee had been
constituted by virtue of the order dated 04.03.1997 and one of the terms of
reference of which was that it could decide upon marginal adjustments in the
concession on P&K fertilizers that may be necessary. The representative of
the Fertilizer Association of India was a member of the said committee and
participated in the deliberations throughout. Therefore, the position is that the
industry knew that though the rates of concession had been notified by virtue
of the circular dated 05.03.1997 for the entire year, there was scope for
marginal adjustments. It is also true that in the preceding years ever since the
scheme was operational, there had not been any instance of reduction in the
rates of concession during the year. Therefore, it was legitimate for the
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.16 of 19

petitioners to have expected that the rates notified on 05.03.1997 would
remain the same throughout the year subject, however, to marginal
adjustments.

24.

While, I do not agree with the submissions made by the learned

counsel for the petitioners that the rates of concession could not at all be
altered during the year 1997-98, I do agree him that the same could be altered
only prospectively. This is different from marginal adjustments in the rates.
Such marginal adjustments could even be made in the course of the year for
transactions completed earlier in the year. Since we are concerned with the
plea of promissory estoppel we must be clear with the exact nature of the
representation by the Respondents as also the factum of detriment caused to
the petitioners because of such representation. The representation here was
that the rates notified on 05.03.1997 would hold good for the year 1997-98
subject to marginal adjustments which could even be applied retrospectively.
At the same time, the representation was not that the rates could not be altered
even prospectively. Therefore, the principle of promissory estoppel would
apply in respect of this limited representation and that, too, if the petitioners
are able to show that they, in fact, altered their positions to their detriment
prior to the announcement of the new rates on 03.02.1998.

WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.17 of 19

25.

The submissions by the learned counsel for the respondent that the

petitioners were made aware by the communication of 07.10.1997 and the
stoppage of the 80% on-account payment in October 1997 that revision in the
rates of concession was around the corner, does not amount to anything. The
fact of the matter is that when the Kharif season ended in September 1997 and
the Rabi season began in October, 1997, there was no indication that the rates
of concession would be reduced to the extent of Rs 250/- per tonne. The
manufacturers and the suppliers continued their operations of manufacture and
sale acting on the same basis on which they had conducted their business for
the Kharif season. In any event, the understanding that could be imputed to
the petitioners of a change in rates of concession was only with regard to
marginal adjustments. If a change in rates of concession was to be more than
marginal then it would definitely have to be prospective. The change brought
about in the present case is of a reduction of Rs 250/- per tonne in both
imported and indigenous DAP. This amounts to a 6% change insofar as
indigenous DAP is concerned and an 11% change insofar as imported DAP is
concerned. By no stretch of imagination can these changes be considered to
be marginal adjustments.

26.

Keeping these factors in mind, I am of the view that upto

03.02.1998 when the impugned circular was issued, the petitioners would be
entitled to claim concession on the rates notified on 05.03.1997 provided they
WP(C)1503/1998

Page No.18 of 19

establish detriment as a fact. However, after 03.02.1998 the petitioners would
be only entitled to the reduced rates of concession as notified in the circular of
03.02.1998. The respondent is accordingly directed to process the petitioners'
claims for concession and to make the payments thereof, if any, alongwith
interest thereon @ 7% from the date on which they became due till the date of
payment. The said claims be cleared in the aforesaid manner within eight
weeks from today.
This writ petition is allowed to this extent. No order as to costs.
