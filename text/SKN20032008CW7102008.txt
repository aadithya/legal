No. 1353/2008 and 1375/2008 in W.P.(C) No.710 of 2008 and W.P.(C)

No.711 of 2008 respectively as well as the applications under Order Order

the Writ Petitions being C.M. Nos. 2527/2008 in W.P.(C) NO.710 of 2008 and
2764/2008 in W.P.(C) NO.711 of 2008.
2. Two identical writ petitions have been filed by Mr.Dinesh Chhabra and
Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited for issue of writ of Certiorari or any other
appropriate writ, order or direction for quashing of letter/order dated 22nd
January, 2008.
3. Mr. Dinesh Chhabra is the owner of premises no. C-1, Panchsheel Enclave,
New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the property, for short) along with his
brothers, Mr. Vijay Chhabra and Mr.Rajinder Chhabra. It is stated that they
have purchased the said property from Col. J.S.Jarg and Mrs. Narender Kaur
Jarg by registered Sale Deed dated 25th May, 2005. It is also stated in the Writ
Petition filed by Mr. Dinesh Chhabra that the earlier owners of the property,
Col. J.S. Jarg and Mrs. Narender Kaur Jarg had made an application and vide
letter dated 15th October, 2004 had obtained permission from Municipal
Corporation of Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the MCD, for short) for opening
of a Bank-branch in the said property. It is further stated that the permission
granted by the MCD is in accordance with Section 347 of the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, for short). In

paragraphs 10, 12 and 14 of the Writ Petition filed by Mr.Dinesh Chhabra, it is
stated as under :“10. Thereafter the said premises were given on rent to

ING Vysya Bank on 23.1.2006 to run its branch which
was vacated on 9.11.2006. Respondents No.1&2
subsequent to the said permission never disputed the
validity of said permission dated 15.10.2004 on any
pretext whatsoever and the said permission remained
valid since 15.10.2004. Copy of the lease deed, rent
receipts and the letter of vacation of the premises by
the bank are collectively annexed herewith as Annexure
P-5 (Colly).

other residents of the property Ms. Madhavi
Narang and others who are occupying first
floor and the second floor, the above
property was sealed by MCD. However, on
the representation of the petitioner vide
letter dated 21.2.2007 the property was desealed by the MCD on the basis of all the
authenticated documents including lease
deed, rent receipts and permission granted
by the MCD for running the bank. As
mentioned above, the previous tenant ING
Vysya Bank vacated the premises in the
month of November, 2006 but due to
typographical error the date was mentioned
as April, 2006 which was factually wrong as
the lease agreement was only registered
between the petitioner and the bank in
August, 2006. All the relevant papers were
also annexed with the said letter and
thereafter the property in question was
desealed by the MCD. Copy of the said
letter dated 21.2.2007 with its annexures

and ING Vysya Bank occupying the said
premises. It is pertinent to mention here
that the premises/building in question is
located in Category B as notified under
MPD 2021.”
4. Similarly, in the Writ Petition (Civil) No. 710/2008 filed by Kotak Mahindra
Bank Limited, it is stated as under :“8.2 Thereafter the said premises were used by ING Vysya

Bank by virtue of Lease Deed registered in August 2006 to run
its branch which vacated the premises in the month of
November, 2006. Respondent No.1 & 7 subsequent to the said
permission, have never disputed the validity of said permission

permission remained valid.

occupying the said premises till the month of November 2006.
It is pertinent to mention here that the premises/building in
question is located in Category B as notified under MPD,
2021.”

5. At the time of first hearing, learned counsel for the both the petitioners had
drawn my attention to Clauses 15.7.2 and 15.3.2 of the Master Plan for Delhi,
2021. The relevant portion of the said Clauses reads as under:“15.7.2. The minimum ROW of a street/or stretch of road
on which the above-mentioned other activities are
permissible is as follows:In A & B Colonies* : 18m ROW in regular plotted
development.
Notes
* Banks and fitness centres shall however, not be
permissible, except those already operating as on
07.09.2006.
In C & D Colonies : 18 m ROW in regular residential
plotted development, 13.5m ROW in rehabilitation
colonies and 9m ROW in regularized-unauthorized
colonies, resettlement colonies, Walled City, special area
and urban villages; and in pedestrian shopping streets (of
less than 6 m ROW)
In E,F & G Colonies : 13.5 m ROW in regular plotted
development, 9m ROW in rehabilitation colonies and 6m
ROW in Walled City, regularized-unauthorized colonies,
resettlement colonies, Special areas, and urban villages
and in pedestrian shopping streets (of less than 6m
ROW).

15.3.2. The extent of mixed use permissible in
various categories of colonies is further clarified as
follows:
1. In colonies falling in categories A and B






xxxx
“Other activity” restricted to guest houses, nursing homes and
pre-primary schools, as defined in para 15.7.1, subject to
conditions contained in para 15.7, in plots abutting roads of
minimum 18m ROW in regular plotted development, since
these activities are in the nature of 'Public and Semi-Public'
facilities. New Banks and Fitness Centres will not be
permissible. Banks and Fitness Centres, which already exist,
in accordance with notifications issued in this regard from time
to time, and are on plots abutting roads of minimum 18m
ROW, on the date of notification, shall, however continue.
xxxxxx

Note :

Commercial activity on mixed use streets, within A
& B category colonies, earlier notified under MPD2001 shall cease with immediate effect (other than
in plots abutting Master Plan roads).”

6. On the basis of the averments made in the Writ Petitions, it was submitted
that ING Vysya Bank was operating and existing at the said property as on 7th
September, 2006 and therefore the petitioner-Bank can also operate from the
said property. It was stated that the Order passed by the MCD is
misconceived as they had wrongly noted/taken the date on which ING Vysya
Bank had vacated the property as 9th April, 2006, in view of the affidavit filed
by the petitioner, Mr.Dinesh Chhabra. It was further stated that the actual date
on which ING Vysya Bank had vacated the premises was 9th November,

2006, i.e. after 7th September, 2006. Thus when the Writ Petitions had come
up for hearing on 28th January, 2008,the following Order was passed:“Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn my

attention to the letter of possession dated 9th
November, 2006 (page 99-C). As per the said letter,
possession was taken from Euronet Service India
Pvt. Ltd. on 9th November, 2006 and not on 9th April,
2006. It is stated that there is a typographical error
in the affidavit.
Learned counsel for the respondent/MCD prays for
sometime to verify the facts in this regard.
List on 30th January, 2008 when the connected writ
petition being WP(C) No.5669/2007 is also coming
up for hearing.
In the meanwhile, the respondents will not give
effect to the letter dated 22.1.2008.”
7. Thereafter, on 30th January, 2008 after hearing the learned counsel for the
parties, the following order, as recorded in Writ Petition No.710/2008, was
passed :
“Learned counsel for the MCD states that no bank

was operating from the premises in question as on
7th September, 2006. He further states that, as per
the enquiries made by them, an ATM was probably
operating from the said property. Learned counsel
for Ms.Madhavi Narang, petitioner in Writ Petition
(Civil) No. 5669/2007 states that even ATM was
not running or operating from the said premises.
The respondent-MCD will file counter affidavit
within a period of seven days incorporating details
of verification and enquiries made by them.

The petitioner will file documents and confirmation
from the Bank which was operating on or after 6th
September, 2006 from the premises, to establish
and show that there existed a regular branch. The
said documents and particulars will be filed by the
petitioner within seven days along with affidavit.
Petitioner will also inform this Court the
location/premises where the said branch has been
shifted. Affidavits will be exchanged two days
before the next date of hearing.

MCD will produce original records of the property
on the next date of hearing.

List along with W.P.(C) Nos. 711/2008 and
5669/2007 on 18th February, 2008.
Interim order to continue till the next date”.
8. The context and reason why Order dated 30th January, 2008 as recorded
above, was passed is apparent. It was to verify the correctness and varsity of
the facts stated in the writ petitions that ING Vysya Bank was operating and
carrying on banking business in the property on 7th September, 2006. It was in
this context parties were asked to file affidavits along with documents.
9. No documents or affidavits were filed, either by Mr.Dinesh Chhabra or by
the Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd in terms of the Order dated 30th January, 2008.
MCD, on the other hand, has filed an affidavit on 15th February, 2008, after

serving copy on the learned counsel for the petitioners, enclosing therewith
letter dated 21st January, 2008 written by MCD to ING Vysya Bank asking
them to verify their records and clarifiy the following two queries :“1. Whether ING Vysya Bank ever operated from the

Premises bearing No.C-1, Panchsheel Enclave, New Delhi? If
yes, please specify the period and also where the branch if
any, was shifted.
2. Whether ING Vysya Bank ever operated any ATM Machine
from the said premises? If yes, please specify the period and
also where the ATM Machine, if any, was shifted.”
10. ING Vysya Bank by their letter dated 5th February, 2008 replied to the two
queries as under:“1. Our Bank's Branch was not opened or operated in the

subject premises.
2. Our Bank's ATM was not operative in the subject
premises.”
11. It is clear from the above letters that ING Vysya Bank did not have any
branch in existence or in operation on 7th September, 2006 in the property.
The reply given by ING Vysya Bank also makes it clear that an ATM may
have been set up in the property but the same was not operational.
12. The petitioners, therefore, have made false and incorrect averments in the
Writ Petitions that ING Vysya Bank was in fact operating and functioning from
the property in September, 2006 and said the Bank vacated the premises in

the month of November, 2006. This also explains the reason why no
affidavit/documents in terms of Order dated 30th January, 2008 were filed that
there existed a regular Bank-branch which was operating from the said
property on or after 6th September, 2006. Learned counsel for the petitioner,
Mr. Dinesh Chhabra in the hearing held on 18th February, 2008 tried to
contend and submit that the Order dated 30th January, 2008; requiring filing of
documents and affidavit confirming that a regular Bank-branch existed in the
property on or after 6th September 2006 was to be complied with by Kotak
Mahindra Bank Ltd. It is apparent that Mr.Dinesh Chhabra is trying to wriggle
out of the averments made by him in the Writ Petition No. 711/2008 and is
trying to take benefit of the fact that the Writ Petition filed by him and Kotak
Mahindra Bank Ltd. were taken up for hearing together. Mr.Dinesh Chhabra
was fully aware and conscious of the fact that affidavit along with documents
and confirmation that a bank was operating from the property on or after 6th
September, 2006 was to be filed by him. After all he is the land lord and has
full knowledge of the actual factual position. It is also difficult to believe that
Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd was not aware that ING Vysya Bank never operated
from the property. ING Vysya Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd being are in
same business, preponderance predicates that Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. was
aware of the actual factual position. In any case, if they had been diligent and
made inquiries from ING Vysya Bank, they would not have made wrong and

false averments in the writ petition. Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. should have
taken taken due care and caution before making factual statements on oath in
the writ petition.
13. Relief under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is discretionary. A party
filing a writ petition under Article 226 must disclose correct and true material
facts. In view of the Master Plan of Delhi, 2021, the question whether a Bankbranch was operating from the property on 7th September, 2006 was most
fundamental and central. Both the petitioners were aware of this fact and
therefore have made the statements quoted above that ING Vysya Bank was
operating from the property as on 7th September, 2006. The petitioners are,
therefore, guilty of deliberately making wrong and false averments in the Writ
Petitions. They are not entitled to discretionary relief. Injunction Order dated
28th January, 2008 was passed on the basis of the statements made in the
Writ Petitions that ING Vysya Bank was operating from the property on 7th
September, 2006 and therefore, Clauses 15.3.2. and 15.7.3 of Master Plan of
Delhi, 2021 are applicable. I therefore, vacate the injunction order granted in
favour of the petitioners and dismiss the applications for injunction, subject to
the directions given below, on the ground of false and wrong statements in the
writ petitions.

14. The petitioners have also filed amendment applications on 15th and 16th
February, 2008. By the said applications, both petitioners want to challenge
the constitutional validity of Clauses 15.3.2 and 15.7.3 of the Master Plan of
Delhi, 2021 on the ground of discrimination and that the said Clauses, could
not have been incorporated in the final Master Plan of Delhi, 2021. It is stated
that there are differences between the draft plan and the final notified Master
Plan of Delhi 2021 and the modifications incorporated in the final Master Plan
are not made as per law. It is evident/apparent that the amendment
applications were filed only after the Order dated 30th January, 2008 was
passed directing both MCD as well as the petitioners to file affidavits with
documents and other proofs to confirm that ING Vysya Bank was operating
from the property on 7th September, 2006. The amendment applications are
malafide and have been filed only with the object and purpose to delay
proceedings after having obtained stay from this Court on 28th January, 2008
on the ground that the petitioners are protected by the aforesaid Clauses.
After the Order dated 30th January, 2008 was passed, the petitioners were
aware that steps were taken by the MCD to get confirmation from ING Vysya
Bank and the said bank by their letter dated 5th February, 2000 has confirmed
that they were not operating and had not opened any branch in the said
property and the ATM was also not operational. The entire focus and corner
stone of the writ petitions was that the action of the respondent-MCD is

contrary to Master Plan of Delhi, 2021 as a Bank-branch was in operation and
in existence from the said property on 7th September, 2006. The petitioners
now want to change the basis and subject matter of the petitions and
challenge by the amendment applications is to the same Clauses, which they
have heavily relied upon. The Master plan has been finalized after inviting
objections. Draft master plan is always subject to amendments depending
upon objections and the suggestions given by the town planners, welfare
associations and others. Submissions made by the petitioners will result in a
never ending process, with every amendment or modification requiring a fresh
draft plan being circulated.
15. I may note here that the petitioners' have claimed said Clauses have been
also challenged before the Supreme Court by ICICI Bank in I.A. No. 216263/2007. It has been stated by Mr.Dinesh Chhabra, in the amendment
application, as under:“That recently the Petitioner has come to know of an application

filed by the ICICI Bank in the facts and circumstances similar to
the present case in a Petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court
being WP(C) No.4677-/1985 titled as M.C. Mehta versus Union of
India and others. In the said application being I.A. No. 21622163/2007, the ICICI Bank has challenged the vires of clause
15.7.2 of the Master Plan Delhi-2021 on certain grounds. A copy
of the said IA filed by ICICI Bank and the Additional Affidavit filed
along with the same is annexed hereto and marked as AnnexureA-1. While hearing this application on 31.08.2007 the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has ordered the Respondent/MCD to de-seal the

premises from where the ICICI Bank was operating its branch. A
copy of the said Order dated 31.08.2007 is annexed herewith and
marked as Annexure-A-2.”
16. The contention/statement of Mr. Dinesh Chhabra in respect of the Order
dated 31st August, 2007 passed by the Supreme Court is also incorrect. On
31st August, 2007, Supreme Court had passed the following Order:“I.A. NOS. 2162-2163

Heard Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel
appearing for the applicant-ICICI Bank and learned
Amicus Curiae and learned counsel for the M.C.D. It is
the definite stand of the applicant-Bank that it became
functional prior to 07.09.2006. Learned counsel for the
MCD states that it shall file its response. For the present,
let the Bank function as was being done earlier. This
shall be subject to filing of an undertaking that it became
functional prior to 07.09.2006 and its functioning is in
accordance with law. The undertaking shall be to the
effect that in case, it is ultimately found that the its really
not so, the Bank shall forthwith stop its functioning.
The matter shall be listed on 09th October, 2007.”
17. Interim stay is not normally granted when vires of a provision is
challenged. Statutory provision or even a delegated legislation is presumed to
be valid till it is struck down. Supreme court has not granted stay of the Master
Plan, 2021 as prayed for by the applicant ICICI Bank before them.
18. Courts are liberal in allowing amendments but when application for
amendment is filed with a malafide intention and to delay the proceedings, the

same is liable to be rejected. In these circumstances, the amendment
applications should be rejected, yet with a view give full opportunity and to
have complete and effective adjudication, I allow the petitioners to raise
additional grounds mentioned in the amendment applications, subject to
payment of costs of Rs. 20,000/- each by the two petitioners.
19. Though applications for injunction are liable to be dismissed on the ground
of false and incorrect statements, I have also examined contentions raised by
the petitioners on merits. Learned counsel for Mr.Dinesh Chhabra submitted
that the respondent-MCD is misreading the Master Plan of Delhi, 2021. Under
Clauses 15.7.3 and 15.3.2, existence of the Bank in the property as on 7th
September, 2006 is required. It is not necessary that the Bank should be
operational. Requirement is that the Bank should have taken the property on
lease and should have been in possession of the same. In this connection, my
attention was drawn to the lease agreement between Mr.Dinesh Chhabra and
some others and M/s.Euronet Services India Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to
as ENSIL, for short). The said lease Agreement stated to be dated 4th August,
2006 (the date on which the agreement was registered is not stated and the
relevant portions in the photocopy have been blanked out). Therefore, it
appears that the said lease Deed was executed on or about the time when the

draft of Master Plan of Delhi, 2021 was already circulated and was pending
consideration.
20. In the petition it is claimed that ING Vysya Bank was given the premises
on rent w.e.f. 23rd January, 2006. Lease Deed dated 4th August, 2006
mentions that the period of lease would be from 24th January, 2006 till 23rd
January, 2009. The petitioner, Mr. Dinesh Chhabra submitted that the TDS
Certificate issued by ENSIL conclusively proves that the premises was taken
on rent w.e.f. 23rd January, 2006. The TDS Certificate is for the period 29th
April, 2006 onwards. Even if it is presumed that the petitioner had entered into
an oral agreement with ENSIL in January, 2006, there is no evidence and
document to suggest that in January, 2006 it was agreed that the property
would be rented out to a bank. TDS certificate is issued by ENSIL and not by
ING Vysya Bank and it does not prove or establish the case of the petitioner.
It is difficult to believe that ENSIL and the petitioner would have entered into
an oral lease in January, 2006, in respect of a property having substantial
market value. If any document was executed in January 2006, the same is not
forthcoming.
21. Lease Agreement dated 4th August, 2006 permits sub-letting by ENSIL to
ING Vysya Bank. Whether sub-letting had in fact actually taken place or not
and ING Vysya Bank had occupied and started its banking operations is not

proved and established by the said Lease Deed. The lease deed dated 4th
August, 2006 was between Mr.Dinesh Chhabra and some other members of
his family and ENSIL and not between Mr. Dinesh Chhabra and ING Vysya
Bank. ING Vysya Bank has now clarified that it had never started its operation
or even opened its Branch in the said property. Lease deed dated 4th August,
2006 does not establish and prove existence of a bank branch in the property.
ATM and bank branch are separate and different. Pre-conditions and
stipulations for opening a bank branch or ATM counter in the Master Plan of
Delhi, 2021 are distinct.
22. Learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr.Dinesh Chhabra had further
submitted that the permission granted on 15th October, 2004 continues to be
applicable even after enforcement of Master Plan of Delhi, 2021. This is not
correct. The said permission had been granted when the Master Plan of Delhi
2021 was not in operation. Master plan of Delhi 2021 is statutory and the
provisions of the said master plan have statutory force. The petitioners are
bound by the Master Plan of Delhi, 2021. Clauses 15.7.2 and 15.3.2 of the
Master Plan have to be enforced. Letter dated 15th October, 2004 does not
come to the rescue of the petitioners and is not protected under the said
clauses. Reference in this regard can be placed upon the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of State of West Bengal versus Terra Firma

Investment & Trading (P) Ltd reported in (1995) 1 SCC 125. Reliance can
also be placed on the decision of a Division Bench of this Court in the case of
Dev Raj Gupta versus New Delhi Municipal Committee reported in (1997)
IV AD (Delhi) 608. Secondly, the letter dated 15th October, 2004 had
prescribed various conditions including requirement to pay yearly fee of
Rs.1,90,260/-, execution of an agreement etc. It is admitted case that no
agreement has been executed and Mr. J.S. Jarg did not pay Rs.1,90,260/- per
year. Even if it is presumed that “rights” under the letter dated 15th October,
2004 stood assigned to the petitioner, Mr.Dinesh Chhabra could have taken
advantage of the same only if an agreement had been executed and he had
paid the amount stipulated in the letter dated 15th October, 2004. It is admitted
that no such payment was made. On the other hand, it is claimed that
payment of Rs.31,790/- was made on 23rd January, 2006 by Mrs. Narender
Kaur Jarg for misuse charges for the period 1st February, 2006 to 31st March,
2006. The said payment by itself will not confer any right on Mr.Dinesh
Chhabra as it is not in accord with the letter dated 15th October, 2004. There
is conclusive evidence on record that no Bank-branch was operating or was in
existence in the said property as on 7th September, 2006. Once Master Plan
of Delhi 2021 has come into operation, the provisions and clauses therein, will
apply. Letter dated 15th October, 2004 does not over-ride the provisions of the
Master Plan of Delhi, 2021.

23. In Clauses 15.7.3 and 15.3.2. words “which already exist” and “operating”
have been used. Both have and convey the same meaning. “Which already
exist” would mean Bank-branch which was already in existence and
“operating” means a bank Branch which is conducting business from the
property. I do not agree with the contention of the petitioner that Agreement
with ENSIL establishes and proves that Bank-branch of ING Vysya Bank was
existing or operating from the premises. A written lease between the petitioner
and ENSIL with right to sublet to ING Vysya Bank as on 7th September, 2006
is not sufficient. A bank should be in existence or operating from the property
as on the said date. I may clarify here that I am not examining the question
whether Clauses 15.7.3 and 15.3.2 give protection to the property or the
concerned Bank i.e. whether protection will be available when one bank
vacates a property and another or a new Bank wants to operate from the
property. This issue need not be decided in this case as there was no Bankbranch in operation or in existence in the said property as on 7th September,
2006.
24. Considerable emphasis was laid by the learned counsel appearing for
Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. on the letters dated 24th April, 2007 and 3rd May,
2007 written by them to MCD to clarify whether they were entitled to open a

new Bank-branch from the said property. In the letter dated 3rd May, 2007 it
has been stated by Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. as under:“ Please note that we never had a Branch at the said

premises and this is for the first time that we are intending
to open our Branch thereat.
Earlier, ING Vysya Bank was running its Branch at the said
premises, which it closed/surrendered on or about
September, 2006”
25. The Officer In-Charge (Building), South Zone, MCD by letter dated 8th
May, 2007 informed Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.; that permission granted by
letter dated 15th October, 2004 was valid but the guidelines would have to be
adhered to. It was further opined that new Bank-branch could be opened in
view of the letter dated 15th October, 2004. My attention was also drawn to the
reply dated 11th January, 2008 given on a query under RTI Act. The said RTI
query was made by one Mr.Rajinder Chhabra as owner of the property to the
effect whether a new Bank can open its Branch after the earlier Bank had
ceased to operate from the property and whether there was any need for fresh
approval for the new Branch. In response to the said query, it was stated by
MCD that fresh approval was not required and a new Bank can operate after
the earlier Bank had closed its operations. MCD in its reply has stated that the
letter dated 8th May, 2007 was written by a person who was not authorised
and action is being taken against the said person. It was submitted by the
learned counsel for the petitioners that MCD is responsible and principle of

estoppel applies. MCD cannot now wriggle out of statements and their reply.
There is no estoppel against law or statute. The Supreme Court in Hira
Tikkoo and others versus Union Territory of Chandigarh reported in
(2004) 6 SCC 765 has held:“20. The learned Senior Counsel then made some

attempts to rely on the doctrines of “promissory
estoppel” and “legitimate expectation”. The doctrine of
“legitimate expectation” has developed as a principle of
reasonableness and fairness and is used against
statutory bodies and government authorities on whose
representations or promises, parties or citizens act and
some detrimental consequences ensue because of
refusal of authorities to fulfill their promises or honour
their commitments. The argument under the label of
“estoppel” and “legitimate expectation” are substantially
the same. The Administration herein no doubt is guilty of
gross mistake in including in its development scheme, a
portion of land covered by the forest and land with
restrictions under the Aircraft Act. A vital mistake has
been committed by the Chandigarh Administration in
overlooking the notification reserving land under the
Forest Act and the restrictions imposed under the
Aircraft Act, but overriding public interest outweighs the
obligation of a promise or representation made on
behalf of the Administration. Where public interest is
likely to be harmed, neither the doctrine of “legitimate
expectation” nor “estoppel” can be allowed to be
pressed into service by any citizen against the State
authorities. In Jit Ram Shiv Kumar v. State of Haryana a
two-Judge Bench of this Court by explaining and
distinguishing Union of India v. Anglo Afghan Agencies
and Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of
U.P. observed thus: (SCC p. 23, para 16)
“16. It is only in public interest that it is

recognised that an authority acting on behalf of
the Government or by virtue of statutory

powers cannot exceed his authority. Rule of
ultra vires will become applicable when he
exceeds his authority and the Government
would not be bound by such action. Any person
who enters into an arrangement with the
Government has to ascertain and satisfy
himself that the authority who purports to act
for the Government, acts within the scope of
his authority and cannot urge that the
Government is in the position of any other
litigant liable to be charged with liability.”

26. In the said case, the petitioners had been allotted plots by a development
authority but later on it was found that the plots were developed by the said
authority contrary to law in contravention of the provisions of the Indian
Forests Act, 1878 (amended in 1918) and The Aircraft Act,1934. It was held
that the development-Authority could not have violated the statutory
provisions and doctrine of estoppel was not applicable against them. For
similar reasons doctrine of legitimate expectation was also held to be not
applicable. It was observed that the Court cannot direct administration to
violate the law and statute or take steps that would be to the detriment of
general public interest. De. Smith on “Judicial Reviews of Administrative
Action” was quoted to the effect that public body with limited power cannot
bind itself to act outside its authorised powers and if it purports to do so it can
repudiate its undertaking for it cannot extend its power by creating estoppel. It
was accordingly observed as under :21. In the aforesaid case of Jit Ram Shiv Kumar
the Municipal Committee of Bahadurgarh town to
develop a mandi promised that the traders who
purchase plots in the mandi would be exempted from
paying octroi duty on goods imported for trade to the
mandi. The State Government in exercise of powers
under the Punjab Municipal Act directed the Municipal

Committee to withdraw the exemption from payment
of octroi duty. When the traders, who had set up their
business in the mandi on promise of getting
exemption from octroi duty, challenged the action of
the Municipality and the Punjab Government and
raised on plea of “estoppel” it was rejected by this
Court by relying on the decision of a Constitution
Bench of this Court in the case of M. Ramanatha Pillai
v. State of Kerala and State of Kerala v. Gwalior
Rayon Silk Mfg. (Wvg.) Co. Ltd. This Court in Jit Ram
Shiv Kumar recorded the following conclusion which
supports the view we propose to take in the
circumstances of the present case:
“51. On a consideration of the decisions of
this Court, it is clear that there can be no
promissory estoppel against the exercise of
legislative power of the State. So also the
doctrine cannot be invoked for preventing the
Government from acting in discharge of its duty
under the law. The Government would not be
bound by the act of its officers and agents who
act beyond the scope of their authority and a
person dealing with the agent of the
Government must be held to have notice of the
limitations of his authority. The court can
enforce compliance by a public authority of the
obligation laid on him if he arbitrarily or on his
mere whim ignores the promises made by him
on behalf of the Government. It would be open
to the authority to plead and prove that there
were special considerations which necessitated
his not being able to comply with his obligations
in public interest.”

27. Reliance placed upon the Order dated 29th May, 2007 passed in Writ
Petition (Civil) 4241/2007 titled Arun Jain versus MCD and Others is equally
misconceived. Mr.Arun Jain had challenged opening of a branch of the ING

Vysya Bank in the said property. In the aforesaid Order, reference was made
to Order dated 10th March, 2006 passed in W.P.(C) No. 2763/2006 wherein
the petitioners/residents of the area, were given liberty to challenge the
permission granted by MCD to run a Bank-branch from the said property but
the said petition was withdrawn. It was observed as under :“As far as the present case is concerned, learned counsel

appearing for the respondent No.4 on advance notice,
produces a letter issued by the MCD to respondent No.4
that it has no objection to the continuing of a bank branch in
the premises for which permission was been granted on
15.10.2004 itself. The MCD has further confirmed on
8.5.2007 that the grant of permission conforms to the
relevant provisions of the New Master Plan for Delhi 2021.”
28. It may be noted here that the Court had observed that there was no
objection to continuing of a Bank-branch. The Court was never informed that
th

there was no Bank-branch in operation on 7 September, 2006. I may also

mention here that the situation has undergone a change with the MCD itself
realising its folly and on coming to know that there was no Bank-branch in
existence or in operation from the said property as on 7th September, 2006.
29. In view of the above, it is held as under :A. The amendment applications are allowed, but subject
to payment of costs of Rs.20,000/- by each petitioner to
the respondent- MCD. Observations made on merits of

grounds raised in the amendment applications are
tentative and will not be binding.
B. The interim applications for stay are dismissed on
merits as well as on the ground that the petitioners have
stated wrong and false facts in the Writ Petitions and
have not come to the Court with clean hands. However,
as the Bank-branch is in operation and to avoid
inconvenience to customers, it is directed that the Bankbranch in the property will be closed within a period of
two months from today. There will be no extension of
time.
C. The petitioner-Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. if so
advised, can seek and apply for permission to open
ATM counter in the property. If any such application is
filed, MCD will examine the same expeditiously and in
accordance with the provisions of the Act and Master
Plan of Delhi 2021. The court has not expressed any
opinion or examined the question whether an ATM
counter is permitted.
30. Accordingly, the applications are disposed of with the above directions.
Interim stay granted by Order dated 28th January, 2008 is vacated in above
terms.
