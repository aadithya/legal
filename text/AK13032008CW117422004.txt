dismissed.

CM 878 of 2007 in WP (C) 11742 of 2004

Page 1 of 13

by order dated 5th January, 1994.

A previous industrial reference

concerning workman was pending, therefore, the petitioner filed an
approval application

bearing O.P No. 172 of 1994 before the

Industrial Tribunal II under Section 33 (2) (b) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947.

3.

The application of the petitioner was dismissed by order dated

25th March, 2003 against which the present writ petition has been
filed. The operation of the impugned award was stayed by this Court
by order dated 30th September, 2004.

4.

The present application under section 17 B of the Industrial

Disputes Act, 1947 has been filed by the respondent, Shri Inderjeet
Singh, contending that he was illegally terminated from his services
because of the callous attitude of the petitioner. He has alleged that
from the date of his termination he is unemployed and not working
under any establishment for any period of time. Applicant submitted
that he made efforts to get himself employed but despite his best
efforts he has been unable to get employment. The applicant asserted
that the petitioner is continuing harassing the applicant by initiating
inquiries and filing petitions. He has stated that he is a poor man who
is unable to lead is life. An affidavit is also filed by the respondent

CM 878 of 2007 in WP (C) 11742 of 2004

Page 2 of 13

deposing that he has remained un-employed from the date of
termination of services.

5.

The petitioner has contested the application pleading that the

application is not maintainable as he has not filed the requisite
affidavit as required under section 17B of the I.D. Act. The petitioner
vehemently denied the contention of the respondent that he is
unemployed since the date of his termination. It is asserted by the
petitioner that if it is assumed that he is the only bread earner of his
family than there is strong assumption of his employment. The
petitioner also argued that the impugned order of the Tribunal is exfacie wrong and liable to be set aside on the ground that the said
order is based on irrelevant facts which also have not been discussed.
The petitioner also prayed for the decision in the present petition on
the merits along with the application under section 17B of the Act.

6.

A single Judge of this Court had culled the principles laid down

in various judicial pronouncement for grant of interim relief under
Section 17 B of the Act in 134 (2006) DLT 49, Food Craft Instt. Vs
Rameshwar Sharma & anr which are as under:

(i)
An application under Section 17B can be made only in
proceedings
wherein
an
industrial
award
directing

CM 878 of 2007 in WP (C) 11742 of 2004

Page 3 of 13

reinstatement of the workman has been assailed.
(ii)
This Court has no jurisdiction not to direct compliance
with the provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act
if all the other conditions precedent for passing an order in
terms of the Section 17B of the Act are satisfied [Re : (1999) 9
SCC 229 entitled Choudhary Sharai v. Executive Engineer,
Panchayati Raj Department & Anr.].
(iii)
As the interim relief is being granted in exercise of
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the
High Court can grant better benefits which may be more just
and equitable on the facts of the case than the relief
contemplated by Section 17B. Therefore, dehors the powers of
the Court under Section 17B, the Court can pass an order
directing payment of an amount higher than the last drawn
wages to the workman [Re : (1999) 2 SCC 106 (para 22), Dena
Bank v. Kirtikumar T. Patel].
(iv) Such higher amount has to be considered necessary in the
interest of justice and the workman must plead and make out a
case that such an order is necessary in the facts of the case.
(v)
The Court can enforce the spirit, intendment and purpose
of legislation that the workman who is to get the wages from the
date of the award till the challenge to the award is finally
decided as per the statement of the objections and reasons of
the Industrial Disputes(Amendment) Act, 1982 by which Section
17B was inserted in the Act [Re : JT 2001 (Suppl.1) SC 229,
Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam (para 12)].
(vi) An application under Section 17B should be disposed of
expeditiously and before disposal of the writ petition [Re : 2000
(9) SCC 534 entitled Workman v. Hindustan Vegetable Oil
Corporation Ltd.].
(vii) Interim relief can be granted with effect from the date of
the Award [Re : JT 2001 Supplementary (1) SC entitled Regional

CM 878 of 2007 in WP (C) 11742 of 2004

Page 4 of 13

Authority, Dena Bank v. Ghanshyam; 2004 (3) AD (DELHI) 337
entitled Indra Perfumery Company v. Sudarshab Oberoi v.
Presiding Officer].
(viii) Transient employment and self-employment would not be
a bar to relief under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act
[Re : 2000 (1) LLJ 1012 entitled Taj Services Limited v.
Industrial Tribunal; 1984 (4) SCC 635 entitled Rajinder Kumar
Kundra v. Delhi Administration; 109 (2004) DLT 1 entitled M/s.
Birdhi Chand Naunag Ram Jain v. P.O., Labour Court No. IV &
Others].
(ix) The Court while considering an application under Section
17B of the ID Act cannot go into the merits of the case, the
Court can only consider whether the requirements mentioned in
Section 17B have been satisfied or not and, if it is so, then the
Court has no option but to direct the employer to pass an order
in terms of the statute. It would be immaterial as to whether the
petitioner had a very good case on merits [Re : 2000 (5) AD
Delhi 413 entitled Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander].
(x) A reasonable standard for arriving at the conclusion of the
quantum of a fair amount towards subsistence allowance
payable to a workman would be the minimum wages notified by
the statutory authorities under the provisions of the Minimum
Wages Act, 1948 in respect of an employee who may be
performing the same or similar functions in scheduled
employments. [Re: Rajinder Kumar Kundra v. Delhi
Administration, (1984) 4 SCC 635; Sanjit Roy v. State of
Rajasthan, AIR 1983 SC 328; decision dated 3rd January, 2003
in Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 3654 & 3675/1999 entitled Delhi
Council for Child Welfare v. Union of India; DTC v. The P.O.,
Labour Court No. 1, Delhi & Ors., 2002 II AD (Delhi) 112 (para
12, 13)]
(xi) Interim orders directing payment to a workman can be
made even on the application of the management seeking stay of
the operation and effect of the industrial Award and order. Such
interim orders of stay sought by the employer can be granted

CM 878 of 2007 in WP (C) 11742 of 2004

Page 5 of 13

unconditionally or made conditional subject to payment or
deposits of the entire or portion of the awarded amount together
with a direction to the petitioner employer to make payment of
the wages at an appropriate rate to the workman. Such an order
would be based on considerations of interests of justice when
balancing equities.
(xii) For the same reason, I find that there is no prohibition in
law to a direction by the Court to make an order directing
payment of the wages with effect from the date of the Award. On
the contrary, it has been so held in several judgments that this
would be the proper course [Re : Regional Authority, Dena Bank
& Anr. v. Ghanshyam, reported at JT 2001 (Suppl. 1) SC 229
and Indra Perfumery Co. Thr. Sudershab Oberoi v. Presiding
Officer & Ors., 2004 III AD (Delhi) 337].
(xiii) While passing an interlocutory direction for payment of
wages, the Court may also secure the interests of the employer
by making orders regarding refund or recovery of the amount
which is in excess of the last drawn wages in the event of the
industrial award being set aside so as to do justice to the
employer.
(xiv) A repayment to the employer could be secured by directing
a workman to given an undertaking or offer security to the
satisfaction of the Registrar (General) of the Court or any other
authority [Re : para 12, 2002 (61) DRJ 521 (DB), Hindustan
Carbide Pvt. Ltd. v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Ors.(supra)]
(xv) In exercise of powers under Article 226 and Article 136 of
the Constitution, if the requisites of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are satisfied, no order can be
passed denying the workman the benefit granted under the
statutory provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 [Re: 1999 (2) SCC 106, Dena Bank v. Kirtikumar T.
Patel (para 23)].
(xvi) Gainful employment of the workman; unreasonable and

CM 878 of 2007 in WP (C) 11742 of 2004

Page 6 of 13

unexplained delay in making the application by the workman
after the filing of the petition challenging the award/order; offer
by the employer to give employment to the workman would be a
relevant factors and consideration for the date from which the
wages are to be permitted.
(xvii)It will be in the interest of justice to ensure if the facts of
the case so justify, that payment of the amount over and above
the amount which could be directed to be paid under Section
17B to a workman, is ordered to be paid only on satisfaction of
terms and conditions as would enable the employer to recover
the same [para 13 of Regional Manager, Dena Bank v.
Ghanshyam].
(xviii)The same principles would apply to any interim order in
respect of a pendent lite payment in favour of the workman.

7.

It cannot be disputed that the provisions of Section 17 B of the

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 comes into operation when an Award
directing

reinstatement

of

a

workman

is

assailed

in

further

proceedings. The statute requires satisfaction of the following four
conditions:
(i)
an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed in
proceedings in a High Court or the Supreme Court;
(ii)
during the pendency of such proceedings, employer is
required to pay full wages to the workman;
(iii)
the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full wages
last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance
admissible to him under any Rule;
(iv)
such wages would be admissible only if the workman had
not been employed in any establishment during such period and
an affidavit had been filed to such effect.
CM 878 of 2007 in WP (C) 11742 of 2004

8.

While considering an application under this provision it is

necessary to bear in mind that the spirit, intendment and object
underlying the statutory provision of Section 17B is to mitigate and
relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship resulting to a workman due
to delay in the implementation of an award directing reinstatement of
his services on account of the challenge made to it by the employer.
The preliminary consideration for making available such a relief to a
workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment. It
recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body
and soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award
directing his reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment which is required to be
made by the employer to the workman has been held to be akin to a
subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor recoverable
from a workman even if the Award in his favor is set aside by the High
Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T.
Patel the Apex Court was of the view that the object under Section
17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain
extent, the hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay
in implementation of the Award.

While considering an application under Section 17B of the

Industrial Disputes Act, the Court cannot go into the merits of the
case in the writ petition. It was so held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5)
AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander. Since the section itself
mentions ‘employment in establishment’ self employment quite
apparently is not in contemplation. Workman can be denied the
benefits under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act only when it
is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the workmen has been
employed and has been receiving adequate remuneration during the
period of pendency of the writ petition. It is thus well settled that
transient employment by the workman does not affect his entitlement
to receive wages pending decision; that is to say that, the benefit of
Section 17B of the Act cannot be denied merely because the workman
is engaged in some activity or in some vocation to eke out his
livelihood. Such relief can be denied only if it is proved that the
workman is gainfully employed in some establishment and is receiving
adequate and regular remuneration which is not the case with the
applicant.

10.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51, Town Municipal, Athani v. P.O.

CM 878 of 2007 in WP (C) 11742 of 2004

Page 9 of 13

LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman has a
legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot
be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act
for enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was concerned
with the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the Court would
have a bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well. From a
conspectus of the authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court,
the right of a workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified
under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of
the constitutional mandate and nothing more. It is undoubtedly, the
bare minimum which is required by the workman to subsist and is
nothing more. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean all the
wages that have fallen due at least from the date of the Award. This
also cannot be disputed that granting relief under Section 17B of the
Act and passing orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is
generally the rule; refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an
exception, as it could be passed only in the rarest of the rare cases of
jurisdictional error where there is no relationship between the parties.
11.

In the present case the workman has categorically averred in

the application that he has been unemployed since the date of
termination of his services. The application of the petitioner under

CM 878 of 2007 in WP (C) 11742 of 2004

Page 10 of 13

Section 33 (2) (b) was dismissed against which the present writ
petition was filed and the stay of award was granted by order dated
30th September, 2004. The petitioner has raised the disputes on
merits of the writ petition to oppose the application of the respondent.
As already discussed while considering the application under Section
17B of the Act, the Court is not to go into merits of the writ petition,
unless it can be shown in some cases that there is no relationship of
employer or employee. This is not disputed in the present case that
the respondent was an employee of the petitioner till his services were
dismissed. On dismissal of the application of the petitioner under
Section 33 (2) (b) of the Act, the respondent became entitled for
reinstatement, however, this Court has stayed the operation of the
award.

12.

The respondent can be denied that relief sought in the present

application only if it is established that the applicant is employed.
Since the section itself mentions ‘employment in establishment’ even
self employment is not contemplated for denying the relief under this
section. On the premise that the workman is the head of the family
and has to feed the family members, no presumption can be drawn
that the workman is employed in an establishment so as to deny him
the relief under this Section 17 B of the Act. The preliminary

CM 878 of 2007 in WP (C) 11742 of 2004

Page 11 of 13

consideration for making available such a relief to a workman is to be
found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment which recognizes a
workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body and soul
together. The payment which is required to be made by the employer
to the workman has been held to be akin to a subsistence allowance
which is neither refundable nor recoverable from a workman even if
the petition challenging the order of the Court is to be allowed. In the
facts and circumstances, the applicant fulfills the criteria for availing
the benefit under section 17B of the act and if the requisites of Section
17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are satisfied, no order can be
passed denying the workman the benefit of statutory provisions of
Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

13.

The plea of the petitioner that the affidavit filed by the

respondent is not in accordance with law is also without any legal
basis. The learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the
affidavit does not disclosed that the respondent has remained unemployed rather it is stated in the application. The affidavit has been
given in support of the application and it is stated that whatsoever is
stated in the application is correct. In the circumstances, the plea of
the petitioner that a proper plea supported by the affidavit has not
been taken that the respondent is not employed, is without any legal

CM 878 of 2007 in WP (C) 11742 of 2004

Page 12 of 13

basis and is liable to be rejected.

14.

For

the

foregoing

reasons,

the

application

of

the

workman/respondent under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 is allowed. The petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn
wages or minimum wages whichever is higher from 25th March, 2003,
the date of the order impugned by the petitioner in this writ petition.
Arrears of last drawn wages or the minimum wages whichever is
higher be paid within eight weeks. The petitioner shall continue to pay
last drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher by the 15th
of every English calendar month during the pendency of the writ
petition. The respondent is also directed to give an undertaking that in
case the petition is allowed, the difference in last drawn wages and the
minimum wages shall be repaid/refunded by the respondent/
workman within the time as shall be permitted by this Court. The
undertaking be filed by the respondent/workman within four weeks.
With these directions, the application is disposed of.
