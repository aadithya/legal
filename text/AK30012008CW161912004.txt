CM No.2675/2006 in W.P(C) No.16191/2004

1.

The respondent/workman has filed this application under

Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking a direction
to the petitioner to pay wages at par with the minimum wages with
effect from the date of the impugned award dated 31st March, 2004
directing his reinstatement, till date.
2.

The respondent/applicant contended that he has not been

employed in any establishment since the date of termination of his
CM no.2675/2006
in W.P(C) No.16191/2004

Page 1 of 7

services, as a result of which it has become very difficult for him to
support himself and his family members which includes three
daughters and his parents and that he has become dependent on his
friends and relatives for meeting the household expenses. The
respondent/workman relying on 2003(VI) AD Delhi 205, contended
that under section 17B of the Industrial disputes act “full wages last
drawn” connotes wages which is not less than the minimum wages as
applicable on date and that the same is payable from the date of the
award till the final disposal of the petition and also no terms can be
imposed on the receipt of wages over and above the last drawn wages
and upto minimum wages. According to the respondent the wages last
drawn by him at the time of termination of his services were Rs.468/per month and that the current wage against the said post is
Rs.3029/- per month.
3.

Reply to the application has been filed by the petitioner/non

applicant in which the petitioner contended that the respondent was
employed on muster roll to perform duties of switch board operator on
need basis and that with the expiry of work his engagement also came
to an end and that the regularization and reinstatement of the
services of the respondent is not governed by the Industrial Disputes
Act but by the statutory rules. According to the petitioner the services
of the respondent were never terminated by the petitioners, in fact, it
automatically came to an end on the expiry of the period. The
CM no.2675/2006
in W.P(C) No.16191/2004

Page 2 of 7

petitioner alleged that that since the respondent last worked on
muster roll in August 1986, therefore the factum of his being
unemployed for last 20 years cannot be believed. The petitioner
further contended that no appointment or termination letter was ever
issued to the respondent.
4.

Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 comes into

operation when an Award directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in further proceedings by the employer. Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act is as under:"17-B. Payment of full wages to workman pending proceedings in
Higher Courts. - Where in any case a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal by its award directs reinstatement of any workman and
the employer prefers any proceedings against such award in a High
Court or the Supreme Court, the employer shall be liable to pay such
workman, during the period of pendency of such proceedings in the
High Court or the Supreme Court, full wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance admissible to him under any rule if
the workman had not been employed in any establishment during such
period and an affidavit by such workman had been filed to that effect
in such court :
Provided that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the High Court
or the Supreme Court that such workman had been employed and had
been receiving adequate remuneration during any such period or part
thereof, the Court shall order that no wages hall be payable under this
section for such period or part, as the case may be."
Thus a workman would be entitled for relief under Section 17B
of the Industrial Disputes Act, if there is an award directing reinstatement of the workman and the employer has preferred proceedings
CM no.2675/2006
in W.P(C) No.16191/2004

Page 3 of 7

against such award at the High Court or Supreme Court and that the
workman had not been employed in any establishment during the period of pendency of such proceedings and an affidavit to that effect
has been filed by the workman. On satisfaction of the requisites as
laid down under section 17B, the court is bound to grant relief to the
workman in terms of the provision as laid down under section 17B of
the Industrial Disputes Act. Also the Court cannot go into the merits
of the case/writ petition while deciding an application under section
17B of the Act as was held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi)
413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.
5.

The object underlying section 17B of the Industrial Disputes

Act, 1947 is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship
which would be caused to a workman due to delay in the
implementation of an award directing reinstatement of his services on
account of the challenge made to it by the employer.

Section 17B

recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body
and soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award
directing his reinstatement as the statutory provisions provide no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal.
6.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 titled Town Municipal, Athani v.
CM no.2675/2006
in W.P(C) No.16191/2004

Page 4 of 7

P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman
has a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and
cannot be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum
Wages Act for enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was
concerned with the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the
Court would have a bearing on the issues raised before this Court as
well. From a conspectus of the authoritative pronouncements of the
Apex Court, the right of a workman to an amount equivalent to the
wages notified under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact,
recognition of the constitutional mandate and nothing more. It is
undoubtedly, the bare minimum wages which is required by the
workman to subsist and is nothing more. Full wages last drawn can
therefore only mean all the wages that have fallen due at least from
the date of the Award.
7.

Also granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing

orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule
whereas refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as
the relief could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of
jurisdictional error where there is no relationship of employer and
employee between the parties.
8.

In the present case, by award dated 31st March, 2004 the relief

CM no.2675/2006
in W.P(C) No.16191/2004

Page 5 of 7

of reinstatement was granted to the workman which award has been
assailed by the employer/petitioner. The workman has categorically
averred in the application that he has not been employed in any
establishment since the date of termination of his services and has
also filed an affidavit deposing the same. The only plea taken by the
petitioner refuting the factum of unemployment of the respondent is
that the respondent/workman could not have remained unemployed
for last 20 years, is not sustainable as the same is not supported by
any material particulars. On the basis of the bald allegation of the
petitioner the relief under section 17B cannot be denied to the
workman. Whether the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act are
applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case is not to be
adjudicated upon at this juncture. The applicant/workman, in the
facts and circumstances, fulfills the criteria for availing the benefit
under section 17B of the Act and in exercise of powers under Article
226 of the Constitution, if the requisites of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are satisfied. No order can be passed in
the present facts and circumstances denying the workman the benefit
of statutory provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947.
9.

Consequently, the application of the workman/respondent

under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is allowed and
the petitioner is directed to pay to the respondent/workman the last
CM no.2675/2006
in W.P(C) No.16191/2004

Page 6 of 7

drawn wages or the minimum wages whichever is higher from the
date of award 31st March, 2004. Arrears of last drawn wages or the
minimum wages be paid within eight weeks. Future last drawn wages
or the minimum wages whichever is higher be paid by 10th of every
month. Respondent/workman is also directed to file an undertaking
that in case the petition is allowed, the respondent/workman shall
refund/repay to the petitioner the difference of last drawn wages and
minimum wages within the time allowed by this Court. The
undertaking to this effect be filed by the respondent/workman within
two weeks.
With these directions the application is disposed of.
