HON’BLE MISS JUSTICE REKHA SHARMA
1.Whether the reporters of local papers may be allowed to
see the Judgment ?
2.To be referred to the reporter or not ?
3.Whether the judgment should be reported in the `Digest’?
REKHA SHARMA, J
Rama Road in West Delhi was conceived as an
‘Industrial Area’ for extensive industries with large industrial
plots. The area was developed by the Delhi Improvement Trust
and pursuant thereto plots were sold on leasehold basis. One of
the conditions attached was that the plots so sold shall not be
sub-divided. It is not in dispute that despite the bar against subdivision the plots were divided and sub-divided without obtaining
permission or sanction from the appropriate authorities. The
massive scale at which the sub-divisions have taken place can be
judged from the fact that out of the originally allotted 61 plots 37
WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

Page 2 of 14

have been sub-divided. Seven of such plots bearing number
53,54,70,63,69,33-33A & 21 fall in Karol Bagh zone. Though
before

division the said seven plots measured between 50221

and 4087 square meters they have been so brutally sub-divided
that from out of the said 7 plots 305 plots have been carved out
with an area varying from 13238 to 11 square meters. And, all
this is only illustrative and not exhaustive. The violation of the
said term of the lease is so wide-spread, so glaring that the
details would leave one aghast and dumb founded. And, as if
these divisions and further sub-divisions were not enough, on
most of those truncated smaller plots we find double or triple
storeyed buildings mocking at law for, like illegal divisions and
sub-divisions of plots those buildings

have been constructed

without getting the plans sanctioned and in flagrant violation of
the municipal and building bye-laws. All this would have
remained under wraps but for the Court Commissioner of Karol
Bagh Zone appointed by this Court in Civil Writ No.4582/03
Kalyan Sanstha Vs. Union of India.
It so happened that on July 8, 2006 when the Court
Commissioner of Karol Bagh Zone was on a visit to his area he
found ten instances of on-going construction at plot No.71 Rama
Road at various stages ranging from laying foundation for
basement, construction

WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

of first floor and second floor. He also

Page 3 of 14

found that Plots No.70 and 71 originally measuring about 10.76
acres each had exchanged hands from one owner to another and
had been illegally sub-divided and sold to different buyers who
had raised huge constructions thereon without sanction of plans.
A report to that effect was submitted by him. The same is dated
July 28, 2006. It was this visit and the report of the Court
Commissioner which opened the pandora box of illegal subdivisions and unauthorized constructions in the Rama Road area.
Consequent upon the expose’ the Municipal Corporation of Delhi
in a communication addressed to the Court Commissioner dated
January 11,2007 admitted that out of 61 industrial plots 37 had
been sub-divided and in a communication dated December 22,
2006 furnished details of the sub-divisions which had taken place
on plots No. 53,54,70,63,69,33-33A, 21 & 22 falling in Karol Bagh
zone showing and as already noticed above, how 7 plots meant
not to be sub-divided have turned into 305 plots. Alarmed by the
report of the Court Commissioner this Court on July 31,2006
issued direction to the Commissioner Municipal Corporation of
Delhi to inquire into the matter and also into the conduct of the
Deputy Commissioner and other Officers including the Junior
Engineer of the zone. This made the

Kumbhkarans

of that zone stir

a bit. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi initiated

demolition

action on plots No.71/6 & 71/7. This led to the filing of the Writ
Petition titled Anil Dewan & Ors. Vs. Municipal Corporation of
WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

Page 4 of 14

Delhi bearing No.13895-918/06 seeking inter-alia a direction in
the nature of mandamus to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi not
to carry out any demolition of their aforesaid properties.
The petitioners claimed that the Delhi Development
Authority had permitted conversion of plots No.71/6 & 71/7 into
free-hold and that thereafter the owner executed various
sale-deeds in favour of the petitioners. It is the case of the
petitioners that they having purchased the plots after the same
having been converted into free-hold, the sub-divisions could not
be said to be illegal. As regards the constructions raised thereon
it was submitted that the same were prior to December 2005 and
were, therefore, protected from demolition in view of Section 3 of
Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act 2006 which came into effect
on May 19,2006 . The said Section runs as under :3. Enforcement to be kept in abeyance –(1)
Notwithstanding anything contained in any relevant law
or any rules, regulations or bye-laws made thereunder,
the Central Government shall within a period of one year
of the coming into effect of this Act, take all possible
measures to finalise norms, policy guidelines and feasible
strategies to deal with the problem of unauthorized
development with regard to the under-mentioned
categories, namely:(a) mixed land use not conforming to the Master
Plan:
(b) construction beyond sanctioned plans; and
(c) encroachment by slum and Jhuggi-Jhompri
dwellers and hawkers and street vendors,

WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

Page 5 of 14

so that the development of Delhi takes place in a
sustainable and planned manner.
(2) Subject to the provisions contained in subsection (1) and notwithstanding any judgment, decree or
order of any court, status quo as on the 1 st day of
January, 2006 shall be maintained in respect of the
categories of unauthorized development mentioned in
sub-section (1)
(3) All notices issued by any local authority for
initiating action against the categories of unauthorized
development referred to sub-section (1), shall be deemed
to have been suspended and no punitive action shall be
taken during the said period of one year.
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision contained
in this Act, the Central Government may, at any time
before the expiry of one year, withdraw the exemption by
notification in the Official Gazette in respect of one or
more of the categories of unauthorized development
mentioned in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), as the
case may be.

Being conscious of the fact that Section 3 of the
aforementioned

Act

protects

only

those

unauthorized

constructions as had come up before January 1, 2006 and being
also conscious of the fact that Section 4(a) of the said Act
provides that no relief under Section 3 is available to those
unauthorized constructions which were started or continued on or
after

1st day of January 2006, counsel for the petitioners

submitted that the petitioners would themselves demolish
unauthorized constructions which they had raised after January 1,
2006. After the said undertaking at the Bar the case was
adjourned from time to time to obtain reports from the Court
Commissioner and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to know
WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

Page 6 of 14

whether in terms of the undertaking voluntary demolitions had
been carried out or not. While this was going on, and as in the
meanwhile Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006 lapsed the
petitioners came up with another plea. It was of alleged
discrimination vis-a-vis others as according to them sub-divisions
and unauthorized

constructions also

existed

on plots

No.

No.69,63,70,33,54,53,22,21 etc but no demolition had been
carried out on those plots . The Municipal Corporation of Delhi
had not told us anything about those plots and constructions
thereon. It was a revelation and we wanted to have confirmation.
A direction was thus issued to the Court Commissioner to file
status report with regard to those properties also. He filed the
report dated January 12, 2007 and confirmed that large scale
sub-divisions and illegal constructions had taken place in the said
plots as well . It appears that our above said direction to the
Court Commissioner had rung some alarm bells and soon enough
the Municipal Corporation which had all along turned a blind eye
to all that was happening or had happened initiated action
against the owners/ occupiers of the said plots also by sealing
their premises. Aggrieved by the said action of the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi spate of writ petitions were filed with regard
to those plots seeking inter-alia a direction to the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi not to carry out any sealing or demolition
and to regularize sub-divisions of the plots. The latter relief for
WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

Page 7 of 14

regularization of sub-divisions was claimed on the basis that the
Municipal

Corporation

of

Delhi

had

earlier

regularized

sub-divisions in respect of some plots. This fact was also
confirmed by the Court Commissioner in his report dated
January 17, 2007

alongwith which he enclosed a copy of the

order dated June 7, 1996 issued by the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi in respect of regularization of a sub-divided plot No.69/1-A,
Najafgarh Road, Industrial Area amongst others on the condition
of payment of cost of land equivalent to 10% of the total plot
area as per land & development rates for providing common
facilities which worked out to Rs.75,01,000/-. Faced with this the
Municipal Corporation of Delhi took the stand that if any of the
petitioners would apply seeking permission/regularization of the
sub-divisions their cases would be considered in the light of the
parameters which were applied to the earlier cases.
While all those writ petitions alongwith writ petition of
Anil Dewan & Ors. (supra) were pending consideration by this
Court, the Master Plan for Delhi- 2021 was notified on February 7,
2007.
The petitioners have heavily relied upon clause 7.6.1
of Master Plan, 2021 and on the basis thereof have contended
that their properties lying sealed on account of sub-divisions and
for reason of constructions raised without sanction of plans are
WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

Page 8 of 14

liable to be de-sealed. Before we proceed to deal with the
submission let us have a look at clause 7.6.1. This is how it
reads.:7.6.1 EXISTING PLANNED INDUSTRIAL AREAS
These industrialized areas were developed in the
70’s and over the years, have deteriorated considerably in
terms of the physical infrastructure and, in some cases
deficiencies on this score have persisted in an overall
sense. Besides, there have been changes in the nature of
activities in some of the areas and there have also been
demands for using part of the plots for activities, which
could be classified as commercial. There may also be a
need to see whether further densification is possible in
terms of creating smaller plots by sub-divisions to
accommodate a larger number of industries/ units.
Guidelines for redevelopment of existing industrial areas
shall be framed within 2 years by DDA in consultation with
GNCTD and the local body. Till such time, the existing
sub divisions may continue.
There is, therefore, a need for modernization and upgradation of the existing industrial areas with due regard
to environmental considerations. Since most of the
Industrial areas are located along the Mass Public
Transport Corridors, there is also a need for optimizing the
use around these areas through the process of
redevelopment.
This process of upgradation and redevelopment will
need to be carried out in a planned manner, and in a
public- private partnership framework, in which the
entrepreneurs contribute to the betterment and
subsequent maintenance through suitable Operation and
Maintenance arrangements.
(emphasis supplied)

What does this provision imply? Does the expression
‘sub-divisions may continue’ mean that the petitioners or persons
WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

Page 9 of 14

similarly placed who have come to occupy the sub-divided plots
in contravention of the lease deeds are exempted from punitive
action, and if so, will such an exemption also extend to
unauthorized constructions raised on the sub-divided plots?
It is a matter of common knowledge that even though
Master Plan 1962, the Zonal Development Plans, Municipal law
and Building Bye laws all were in place yet the Capital city of
Delhi was allowed to grow in a haphazard manner. The residential
colonies were allowed to be converted into centres of small and
big trades. Large tracts of public land were permitted to be
occupied by land mafia and even open spaces outside residential
colonies meant for public use did not remain unaffected at the
hands of land grabbers and builders’ mafia. A road to hell was
thus paved while the administrators slumbered. In the matter
before us the terms of the lease deeds did not permit sub-division
of plots and even if in a given case sub-division was regularized
as in the case of plot No.69-1/A Najafgarh Road it was on
payment of cost of land equivalent to 10% of the total area as per
L& DO rates which was as high as Rs.7501000/-. Therefore, had it
not been for the apathy, indifference and inaction on the part of
the Delhi Development Authority to take action in terms of the
lease deeds against those who sub-divided the plots none of the
petitioners would have come to occupy the sub-divided plots or

WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

Page 10 of 14

could have raised constructions thereon to run their business
establishments from there. They had violated the terms of the
lease. They had violated the building laws and bye-laws. And
now, these very persons who violated the law with impunity seek
to get solace and protection under clause 7.6.1.
The vires of clause 7.6.1 has not been challenged. And
who would? The violators of law who are sought to be protected,
or those who saw those violations and yet turned a blind eye and
refused to act? Anyhow, there being no such challenge, we
refrain to go into it. But then what is provided in clause 7.6.1? It
speaks of deterioration “in terms of “physical infrastructure” and
of some “defencies on this score”. It also notes “changes in the
nature of activities in some areas” and refers to the demands for
using “part of the plots” for commercial activities and need to see
“ whether further densification is possible”. And above all, it is
stated, guidelines for redevelopment of existing industrial areas
have to be framed within two years. These and these only are
reasons delineated for saying that: “ Till such time, the existing
sub-divisions may continue.” It does not approve the subdivisions. It does not make them legal. It merely says that till the
guidelines are framed and which are required to be framed within
two years, till that time the existing “sub-divisions” may
continue. Sub-divisions of what? Obviously of industrial plots. This

WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

Page 11 of 14

is as clear as sun-shine. It leaves, to my mind, no manner of
doubt. It says nothing less nothing more. But then, the petitioners
want us to read into it something more. They say this protection
has to be afforded also to the constructions raised on these subdivided plots.

This, according to them is inherent in the

sentence” Till such time the existing sub-divisions may continue.”
In other words they want us to read the sentence as under:“ Till such time the existing sub-divisions and
constructions raised thereon may continue.”
They thus want us to add into the sentence something
which is clearly not there. What prevented the drafters from
including the words which the petitioners want us to include?
Despite being aware and conscious of illegal constructions on
these sub-divided plots, for it is not believable that they were
ignorant of it, the framers of the Master Plan did not think it
proper to include the aforesaid words and this being a deliberate
omission, we cannot and must not supply that omission. There
are atleast as many as nine reasons for that. Firstly, it is not for
us to legislate. Secondly, the language used being clear and
unambiguous it is not capable of any other construction. Thirdly,
the interpretation suggested by the petitioners amounts to
affording protection from penal consequences. It may be noted
that the sub-divisions being only against the terms of lease it did
not invite any criminal action whereas illegal constructions would
WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

Page 12 of 14

be a criminal offence (see section 461 of the Municipal
Corporation

of

Delhi

Act)

It

is

not

believable

that

the

representatives of the people would give protection to such
offenders. Fifthly, there is a presumption that the legislature has
used the words correctly and exactly and not loosely and
inexactly. Sixthly, as stated by Lord Cranworth, “ To adhere as
closely as possible to the literal meaning of the words used,” is “
a cardinal rule”. And, by departing from it “we launch into a sea
of difficulties which it is not easy to fathom” (1852) 21 LJ Ch.405
P 406. Seventhly, we have to see the material words and give
them their plain grammatical meaning. Eighthly, it is not
permissible to read words into a statute which are not there more
so when, as in the present case, the words suggested by the
petitioners cannot be taken to have been accidentally omitted
and further because literal construction does not make clause
7.6.1 meaningless and also because it cannot be said with
certainty that the words suggested by the petitioners would have
been inserted by the Legislature had its attention been drawn to
what appears to be a deliberate omission and lastly the Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 operates independent of the
Master Plan. The provisions of the Act of 1957 are neither
superseded nor made redundant by the provisions of the Master
Plan 2021.

WP(C) No.13895-918/2006 &Ors.

Page 13 of 14

What then, be the conclusion? It is that while clause
7.6.1 of
act of

Master Plan 2021 does protect, atleast for the present
sub-division of the plots, it affords no protection to the

constructions raised on the sub-divided plots without or in
violation of the

sanctioned plans. Therefore, no case for

de-sealing of such buildings is made out.

However, if in any

given case it is found that the building or construction raised on a
sub-divided plot or any part thereof is in terms of the Municipal
and building bye laws and yet has been sealed the same shall be
de-sealed. With these directions, the writ petitions are dismissed.
