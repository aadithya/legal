A.K. SIKRI, J.
1.

We, the two members of a Bench, have not been able to agree on
the final conclusion in these writ petitions. It is for this reason I have
to pen down my view that is different from the one taken by my
esteemed sister Rekha Sharma, J. In her opinion, she has mentioned
the factual matrix and also stated the background which led to the
sealing of various premises belonging to the petitioners in these writ
petitions.

I am, therefore, spared with the botheration of stating

these facts all over again as it would be an unnecessary repetitive
exercise. However, necessary facts for chartering different course of
action would need a mention wherever warranted.

2.

In order to maintain the continuity, I may only recapitulate the
problem in a nut shell: The Court Commissioner of Karol Bagh Zone,
on the basis of his visit to the Rama Road area in West Delhi on
8.7.2006, noticed on-going construction at Plot No. 71, Rama Road.
His further probe into the matter revealed that Plot Nos. 70 & 71,
though originally measured about 10.76 acres each, had exchanged
hands from one owner to another and there was sub-division of
these plots. It was further revealed that these sub-divided plots, in
fragmented form, were sold to different buyers who had raised huge
constructions thereon without sanction of plans. He submitted his
report dated 26.7.2006 on the basis of this inspection. This led to
further revelation that there were many other industrial plots in the

WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 2 of 25

said area which were sub-divided in a similar manner. Orders dated
31.7.2006 were passed by this Court directing the Commissioner,
MCD to inquire into the matter and also into the conduct of the
Deputy Commissioner, Junior Engineer and other officers of the
Zone. The MCD initiated demolition action on Plot Nos. 71/6 &
71/7. Writ Petition No. 13895-918/2006 titled 'Anil Dewan & Ors. v.

MCD etc.' was filed with a prayer that MCD be restrained from
carrying out these demolitions.

The MCD took further action by

sealing some properties which belong to the petitioners in the instant
cases. That is how these petitions are filed with a prayer that their
premises be de-sealed. The issue, therefore, before us, today, is as to
whether direction is to be issued to the MCD to de-seal the premises
of the petitioners.

3.

It may be mentioned at the outset that there is no dispute that Rama
Road in West Delhi was conceived as an 'Industrial Area' for
extensive industries with large industrial plots. Most of these plots, as
they were originally developed by the Delhi Improvement Trust and
sold on lease-hold basis, measure in several acres each. It is also not
in dispute that these plots are sub-divided into several small plots. As
pointed out in the order of Rekha Sharma, J., 7 plots falling in Karol
Bagh Zone, which originally measured between 4087-50221 sq.mts.,
after the sub-division, today number 305 plots.

It may also be

pointed out that on the sub-divided plots constructions are raised

WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 3 of 25

and most of these constructions are without getting any plans
sanctioned from the appropriate authority.

4.

When it is observed that there is a sub-division of the plots in
violation of the terms of lease and illegal constructions raised
thereon, in such a situation, normal reaction would be not to
interfere with the sealing of these properties. That could have been
my opinion as well.

However, having regard to certain very

material and important events happening in the interregnum and in
view of the policy formulated by the Central Government, reflecting
these ground realities, in the form of provision contained in the
Master Plan

for Delhi 2021

(for short, 'MPD 2021'), my

conclusion/opinion stands otherwise.

5.

Over a period of time, there had been a gradual shift of large scale
industries from these areas.

Final blows were inflicted by the

Supreme Court to check environmental pollution they were causing.
It is a matter of common knowledge that the problem of hazardous
industries running in Delhi came up for consideration before the
Supreme Court in the case of M.C. Mehta v. Union of India, (1996) 4
SCC 750. Series of orders and directions came to be passed by the
Apex Court in the said case from time to time. To summarise the
effect of these orders in brief, the Supreme Court was of the opinion
that since as per the Master Plan 2000, those hazardous industries
falling in Category 'H' were not permitted in the National Capital
WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 4 of 25

Territory of Delhi (for short, 'NCTD'), such industries could not
operate in this vicinity. Directions were, thus, given to shut down all
such industries.

The Supreme Court had also passed orders for

rehabilitating these industries in Bhawana. Many such industries on
Rama Road faced similar closure.

6.

As mentioned above, Rama Road was conceived as an 'Industrial

Area' for extensive industries. That was the raison d‟etre for allotting
large industrial plots since heavy industries needed plots of large size.
However, with the shifting of large scale industries and closure of
industrial activities, necessity of big size plots also ceased, as small
scale industries needed small size plots. In fact, industrial activity had
almost vanished and, therefore, the plots were used for other kinds
of commercial activities. As, for such commercial activities, there was
no requirement of the plots of massive size, over a period of time the
plots were sub-divided for carrying out other commercial activities.
This had started happening even before the orders of the Supreme
Court in M.C. Mehta (supra).

No doubt, for creating the sub-

division, owners of the plots were required to obtain permission
from the lessor in terms of the lease deed. We find from the record
that some plot holders took permission before creating such subdivisions, but most of the plot holders did not care to take requisite
permission from the lessors.

WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 5 of 25

7.

The constructions which were carried out on these plots originally,
were in accordance with the sanctioned plans. However, after the
sub-divisions on fragmented plots, the constructions raised were
without getting the plans sanctioned. The reason is obvious; with the
sub-divided plots, MCD would not have sanctioned the plans.
Notwithstanding most of these units have been operating for
decades. In many units, the construction is also very old, though
many occupiers have been carrying out the construction even in
recent times, as was found in the case of plot No. 71.

8.

The Legislature in the first instance, taking cognizance of the ground
realities as pointed out above (and there may be some other
circumstances as well), enacted Delhi Lands (Special Provisions) Act,
2006 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 2006'). It came into force
with effect from 19.5.2006. Section 3 of the Act of 2006 states that
the Central Government would take all possible measures to finalize
norms, policy guidelines and feasible strategies to deal with the
problem of unauthorised development with regard to the categories
stipulated in the said section. In the meantime, as per sub-section (3)
of Section 3, no punitive action was to be taken during the said
period of one year. The protection was, however, given in respect
of those unauthorised constructions which had come up before
1.1.2006 inasmuch as Section 4(a) of that Act in no uncertain terms
stipulates that no relief under Section 3 was available to those

WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 6 of 25

unauthorised constructions which were started or continued on or
after 1.1.2006.

9.

Within one year of the aforesaid enactment, i.e. on 7.2.2007, MPD
2021 was notified. Though the Central Government did not finalise
norms, policy guidelines or feasible strategies to deal with the
problems of unauthorised development, as mandated by sub-section
(1) of Section 3 of the Act of 2006, a special provision in the form of
Clause 7.6.1 of MPD 2021 was inserted dealing with these very
industrialized areas. As the entire case rests on the interpretation of
this clause and the consequential orders that need to be passed on
that basis, it is necessary to reproduce the entire clause of MPD 2021,
which is to the following effect :“7.6.1 EXISTING PLANNED INDUSTRIAL AREAS
These industrialized areas were developed in the 70‟s
and over the years, have deteriorated considerably in terms of
the physical infrastructure and, in some cases deficiencies on
this score have persisted in an overall sense. Besides, there
have been changes in the nature of activities in some of the
areas and there have also been demands for using part of the
plots for activities, which could be classified as commercial.
There may also be a need to see whether further densification
is possible in terms of creating smaller plots by sub-divisions to
accommodate a large number of industries/units. Guidelines
for redevelopment of existing industrial areas shall be framed
within 2 years by DDA in consultation with GNCTD and the
local body. Till such time, the existing sub divisions may
continue.
There is, therefore, a need for modernization and
upgradation of the existing industrial areas with due regard to
environmental considerations. Since most of the industrial
areas are located along the Mass Public Transport Corridors,
there is also a need for optimizing the use around these areas
through the process of redevelopment.

WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 7 of 25

This process of upgradation and redevelopment will
need to be carried out in a planned manner, and in a publicprivate partnership framework, in which the entrepreneurs
contribute to the betterment and subsequent maintenance
through suitable Operation and Maintenance arrangements.”
(emphasis supplied)

10.

It is manifest from the reading of the aforesaid provision that the
Central Government was conscious of the following ground realities
in respect of these industrialised areas, like Rama Road etc. :-

a)

such industrialised areas were developed in 1970s and over the
years had deteriorated considerably in terms of physical
infrastructure;

b)

there have been changes in the nature of activities in some of
the areas (some of these are pointed out above);

c)

there have been demands for using part of the plots, which
could be classified as commercial; and

d)

it was recognized that there is a need for modernisation and
upgradation of existing industrial areas with due regard to
environmental considerations.

There was also a need for

optimising the use around these areas through the process of redevelopment.

In the process, it was also necessary to see

whether further densification is possible in terms of creating
smaller plots by sub-division to accommodate a large number
of industries/units.

WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 8 of 25

The policy makers, thus, realized that there was a necessity to
carry out the process of upgradation and re-development of these
industrial plots in a planned manner and in a public/private
partnership framework.

The purpose is to ensure that the

entrepreneurs

contribute

to

maintenance

through

the

suitable

betterment
operations

and
and

subsequent
maintenance

arrangements.
Having regard to the necessity of preparing a framework for
upgradation and re-development of these plots keeping in view the
objectives delineated above, two measures are mandated in para
7.6.1 :i)

DDA is assigned the task of preparing guidelines for redevelopment of existing industrial areas within a period of two
years in consultation with the Government of NCTD and the
local body, namely MCD; and

ii)

till such time these guidelines are framed by the DDA, the
existing sub-divisions are allowed to continue.

11.

The moot question is: „What does the expression “till such time the

existing sub-divisions may continue” convey? With what intent and
purpose this provision is introduced? The petitioners contend that
once the sub-divisions are allowed to continue, it would mean that
the petitioners are permitted to operate their units and, therefore,
the premises need to be de-sealed. MCD has supported this, taking
WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 9 of 25

similar posture, as discussed in detail hereinafter. On the other hand,
the learned Court Commissioner as well as learned counsel for the
DDA went to the extent of arguing that this provision does not
protect even the sub-divisions and wherever such a protection is
granted in the MPD 2021, specific language in that behalf is used.

12.

In the separate opinion of Rekha Sharma, J., though accepting that
the phrase means that the sub-divisions are allowed to continue, it is
opined that the petitioners would not be entitled to the de-sealing of
their units as the constructions raised thereon are unauthorized and
illegal and no such constructions are allowed to continue inasmuch as
the Clause does not specifically include the “constructions raised

thereon”. It is here that I respectfully disagree and in the following
paragraphs I will state my reasons for doing so.

13.

I may clarify at the beginning itself that by no means it is suggested
that the sub-division of plots which originally took place and the
manner in which it was done was not in violation of the terms of the
lease deeds. It is also not suggested that with the aforesaid provision,
these sub-divisions are legalised.

What is emphasised is that the

Government authorities have taken cognizance of the problem and
have felt the need to upgrade and re-develop these industrial areas.
As and when such guidelines for re-development of existing industrial
areas are formulated by the policy makers, obviously the occupiers of
these sub-divided plots will have to conform to those provisions.
WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 10 of 25

Since these industries/commercial establishments are operating for
number of years, the occupiers are given a respite for a period of two
years.

The clear intention is to give them reprieve and put

moratorium against any coercive action. It is manifested by allowing
them to “continue”.

It is possible that once these guidelines are

formulated, many existing units would be found already conforming
to those guidelines or may have to make small changes/deviations/
improvements for bringing them in conformity with the guidelines.
On the other hand, it is also possible that many such existing units
operating from these sub-divided plots may have to face closure.

It

is only after the framing of the guidelines, that the fate of these units
would be determined, depending upon the nature of the guidelines
so framed. We have also to keep in mind the background in which
such a provision is made in the MPD 2021.

On an earlier occasion,

protection was given vide Section 3 of the Act of 2006. Now, the
MPD 2021 provides protection to the establishments/ industries
existing on these sub-divisions by allowing them to continue till such
time DDA formulates the guidelines for re-development of existing
industrial areas, which task DDA is to accomplish within two years
from 7.2.2007, i.e. by 7.2.2009.

14.

It is, thus, clear that in view of this provision, notwithstanding subdivision of these large scale plots without the approval of the lessor,
they are allowed to continue. In such a circumstance, can it be said
that though sub-divisions are allowed to continue, still these

WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 11 of 25

petitioners would not be given any relief because the construction
carried out on these sub-divided plots is not after obtaining any
sanction.

To my mind, the intention behind the expression “the

existing sub-divisions may continue” would mean that they are
allowed to operate till the guidelines for re-development are framed
by the DDA, for which two years time is granted to it. Therefore, for
a period of two years or at least till such time the guidelines are
framed, protection is accorded. This permission cannot be negatived
on the ground that construction carried out on these plots is
allegedly illegal. If such an approach is taken, I am afraid, that would
amount to negating the very purpose with which such a clause is
specifically inserted in the MPD 2021.

There can be a legitimate

presumption that when the policy makers introduced the aforesaid
provision in the MPD 2021, they very well knew the ground realities
including the kind of constructions which were already existing. In
the present case, one does not even make such presumption, as it can
be clearly inferred from the background facts that the Central
Government as well as other statutory authorities had definite
knowledge about these constructions.

Still the provision is made

allowing these sub-divisions to “continue” and it is to be given its
fullest meaning with the purpose with which the provision is
introduced.

„Purposive Interpretation‟ is the technique which has

acquired certainty as a principle of interpretation.

This trend is

visible in the judgments of the Supreme Court, some of which are
discussed at this juncture.

In Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation & Anr. V. Nilaybhai R.

Thakore & Anr., AIR 2000 SC 114, Rule 7 of Rules for Admission to
Smt. N.H.L. Municipal Medical College defining “local students” was
in issue, and it was observed as under :“Before proceeding to interpret Rule 7 in the manner which
we think is the correct interpretation, we have to bear in mind
that it is not the jurisdiction of the court to enter into the arena
of the legislative prerogative of enacting laws. However,
keeping in mind the fact that the Rule in question is only a
subordinate legislation and by declaring the Rule ultra vires, as
has been done by the High Court, we would be only causing
considerable damage to the cause for which the Municipality
had enacted this Rule. We, therefore, think it appropriate to
rely upon the famous and oft-quoted principle relied by Lord
Denning in the case of Seaford Court Estates Ltd. V. Asher
(1994) 2 All ER 155 wherein he held : “When a defect appears

a judge cannot simply fold his hand and blame the draftsman.
He must set to work on the constructive task of finding the
intention of Parliament and then he must supplement the
written words so as to give „force and life‟ to the intention of
the Legislature. A judge should ask himself the question how, if
the makers of the Act had themselves come across this ruck in
the texture of it, they would have straightened it out? He must
then do as they would have done. A judge must not alter the
material of which the Act is woven, but he can and should iron
out the creases”. This statement of law made by Lord Denning
has been consistently followed by this Court starting in the case
of M. Pentaih and Ors. V. Muddala Veeramallappa and Ors.
AIR 1961 SC 1107 and followed as recently as in the case of
S.Gopal Reddy v. State of Andhra Pradesh AIR 1996 SC 2184.”

The three Judge Bench of the Apex Court in Sanjay Dhar v. J & K

Public Service Commission & Anr., AIR 2000 SC 3238 observed that
Rule 9 of the J&K Service (Judicial) Recruitment Rules, 1967 must
receive a purposive interpretation. Purposive interpretation enable
ascertaining the purpose of enactment, the object sought to be
achieved and the mischief sought to be taken care of or prevented.

In Bombay Dyeing and Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Bombay Environmental

Action Group & Ors., AIR 2006 SC 1489, the Hon‟ble Supreme
Court laid down the dicta in respect of principles of interpretation,
and the same reads as under :“71. Before us, the learned counsel appearing for the parties
have relied on several principles of interpretation of statute.
72. The golden rule of interpretation is that unless literal
meaning given to a document leads to anomaly or absurdity,
the principles of literal interpretation should be adhered to.
(See Compak (P) Ltd. V. CCE (2005) 8 SCC 300, Gurudevdatta
VKSSS Maryadit v. State of Maharashtra (2001) 4 SCC 534,
Dayal Singh v. Union of India (2003) 2 SCC 593 and Swedish
Match AB v. Securities and Exchange Board, India (2004) 11
SCC 641).

74. We have also been asked by the learned Counsel for the
parties to interpret the impugned legislation in the light of
constitutional scheme and in particular Articles 14 and 21 of the
Constitution of India, the provisions of the MRTP Act, the
doctrine of sustainable development and various other
principles. In the aforementioned situation, it is not possible for
us to take recourse to the golden rule.
75. As would appear from the discussions made hereinafter,
we are, however, of the opinion that for correct interpretation
of DCR 58, the principles of purposive interpretation should
be applied.
76. In Francis Bennion's Statutory Interpretation, purposive
construction has been described in the following manner:
A purposive construction of an enactment is one which gives
effect to the legislative purpose by(a) following the literal meaning of the enactment where that
meaning is in accordance with the legislative purpose (in this
Code called a purposive-and-literal construction), or
(b) applying a strained meaning where the literal meaning is
not in accordance with the legislative purpose (in the Code
called a purposive-and- strained construction).
77. In K.L. Gupta and Ors. v. The Bombay Municipal
Corporation and Ors. [1968 (1) SCR 274, it was stated:
“Before examining the contentions on the points of law raised
in this case, it is necessary to appreciate what the Act sought to
WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 14 of 25

achieve and why it was brought on the statute book. In order
to do this, it is necessary to take stock of the position at the
time of its enactment so that attention may be focussed on the
situation calling for a remedy and how the legislature sought
to tackle it....”
78. However, the pith of this statement has now found form
in the doctrine of purposive construction, as accepted by this
Court in several cases.
79. In Maruti Udyog Ltd. v. Ram Lal and Ors. (2005) 2 SCC
638, while interpreting the provisions of Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947, the rule of purposive construction was followed.
80. In Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance and
Investment Co. Ltd. (1987) 1 SCC 424 this Court stated :
“...If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment,
with the glasses of the statute-maker, provided by such
context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words
may take colour and appear different than when the statute is
looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With
these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover
what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is
meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the
entire Act...”
81. In 'The Interpretation and Application of Statutes', Reed
Dickerson, at p.135 discussed the subject while dealing with the
importance of context of the statute in the following terms:
“... The essence of the language is to reflect, express, and
perhaps even affect the conceptual matrix of established ideas
and values that identifies the culture to which it belongs. For
this reason, language has been called "conceptual map of
human experience.”
82. In Punjab Land Development and Reclamation
Corporation Ltd. v. Presiding Officer, Labour Court,
Chandigarh (1990) 3 SCC 682, this Court referred to the
following passage from Hans Kelsen's Pure Theory Law of Law:
“…The legal act applying a legal norm may be performed in
such a way that it conforms (a) with the one or the other of
the different meanings of the legal norm, (b) with the will of
the norm- creating authority that is to be determined
somehow, (c) with the expression which the norm- creating
authority has chosen, (d) with the one or the other of the
contradictory norms, or (e) the concrete case to which the two
contradictory norms refer Page 1235 may be decided under
the assumption that the two contradictory norms annul each
other. In all these cases, the law to be applied constitutes only
a frame within which several applications are possible,
WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 15 of 25

whereby every act is legal that stays within the frame.”
[See also High Court of Gujarat v. Gujarat Kishan Mazdoor
Panchayat (2003) 4 SCC 712, Indian Handicrafts Emporium
and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. (2003) 7 SCC 589 and
Deepal Girishbhai Soni and Ors. v. United India Insurance Co.
Ltd., Baroda (2004) 5 SCC 385]

92. It is also a well-settled principle of law that common sense
construction rule should be taken recourse to in certain cases as
has been adumbrated in Halsbury's Laws of England (Fourth
Edition) Volume 44(1) (Reissue). We would refer to the said
principle in some details later.”

18.

After all, action against such illegal constructions was kept in
abeyance by legislative measure contained in Section 3 of the Act of
2006. If at that time this Court took the view that no action need be
taken for a period of one year during which the said Act was in
operation, it is beyond comprehension as to why the same approach
cannot be adopted while construing provision of Clause 7.6.1 of
MPD 2021.

19.

It is also pointed out by some of these petitioners that even the
construction was raised as far back as in 1970s/1980s after getting the
plans sanctioned.

We may quote the example of WP (C) No.

3193/2007. This was a case which was separately argued by counsel
for the parties. As per the averments made in the petition, one Shri
P.L. Mehta was given leasehold rights in a plot of land admeasuring
1.22 acres bearing No. 38 in the Industrial Area Scheme, Rama Road,
Najafgarh, New Delhi on 4.8.1950. The petitioners are successors-inWP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 16 of 25

interest of the original allottee, being his children. There was specific
stipulation in the agreement entered into between late Shri P.L.
Mehta and Delhi Improvement Trust that lessee would not subdivide the said land without the previous sanction, in writing, of the
Delhi Improvement Trust.

The Delhi Improvement Trust was

succeeded by the Delhi Development Authority. On 19.7.1969, DDA
executed the sale deed in favour of late Shri P.L. Mehta on free-hold
basis.

In this sale deed, there was no stipulation prohibiting the

petitioner therein from either sub-dividing, selling or alienating any
part or portion of the said plot of land either with or without the
permission of the DDA.

The MCD granted building permits for

construction of an industrial building to the land owner on
30.6.1970. The building was accordingly constructed. It is not in
dispute that as on that date there was no unauthorized construction
ever reported in respect of this property.

Late Shri P.L. Mehta

decided to sell half portion of the said constructed property for his

bona fide needs and requirements. He approached the DDA and
was given No Objection on 4.10.1977. We may mention that this
No Objection is enclosed along with the petition and though initially
the DDA took the plea that such No Objection is not on records, the
case was argued conceding that such a No Objection was given. Shri
P.L. Mehta took similar permission from the authorities under the
Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 since the DDA while
granting this permission had stated that the No Objection was subject
to seeking permission from those authorities.
WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

After obtaining
Page 17 of 25

permission from the competent authority under the Urban Land
(Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 on 13.10.1977, half portion of the
property was sold to M/s. Tek Chand and Sons. Registered sale deed
dated 15.3.1978 was executed in this behalf. Necessary ratifications
were also carried out in the records of the Property Tax department
of the MCD.

Remaining half portion admeasuring about 3500

sq.yds. is in the ownership of the petitioners. This half portion of the
petitioners is sealed. Sealing took place on 18.4.2007 without any
notice to the petitioners on the ground that the original plot of land
had been illegally sub-divided.

On 19.4.2007, the petitioners

approached DDA and MCD and informed about the aforesaid facts,
including that there was specific permission for sub-division.
However, as no action was taken to de-seal the premises, these
petitioners filed WP (C) No. 3193/2007.

20.

This case is, thus, an example where even the permission for subdivision is duly taken.

However, the argument of unauthorized

construction was raised by the DDA. The Court Commissioner was
asked to inspect the premises and submit his report. Report dated
14.9.2007 is submitted by him. As per this report, no doubt, some of
the construction is beyond the sanctioned plan. It may be mentioned
that the premises are used as motor garage and there is extra
coverage in the form of sheds and, thus, temporary structure to this
extent is constructed.

Admittedly, this extra coverage is not the

ground for sealing of the premises. Even otherwise, affidavit is filed
WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 18 of 25

by the petitioners that they would remove the extra coverage. Still,
in a case like this, if de-sealing is not ordered, it would be unjust to
these petitioners. This is the ground reality in this case, de hors the
provisions like Clause 7.6.1 of MPD 2021.

This case also

demonstrates that many times general orders may lead to injustice in
individual cases and when these persons approach the Court and
point out that the reason which prompted the Court to seal/demolish
the properties is not attracted in their cases, they are to be given the
relief.

21.

I may also mention that one of the submissions of these petitioners
was that the MCD had taken selective action in sealing the premises
of these petitioners though there were number of others who were
similarly situated on the Rama Road itself, but no action was taken
by the MCD in respect of those units. It is explained that pursuant to
orders dated 15.2.2007 passed by this Court taking note of Clause
7.6.1 and permitting these unit holders to move applications to the
MCD in the requisite proforma, the MCD received applications from
various persons. These were processed and were submitted to the
Standing Committee of the MCD as per Section 312 & 313 of the
DMC Act. However, as on that date the Standing Committee of the
Corporation was functus officio because of the completion of the
term of the Corporation and, therefore, applications could be
considered only after the reconstitution of the Standing Committee.
The MCD thereafter worked out the modalities for carrying out

WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 19 of 25

sealing vis-à-vis applicability of Clause 7.6.1 of MPD 2021 and court
orders. The administrative justification/reason of the basis of
choosing/selecting a criteria/guidelines was adopted by the MCD to
carry out sealing in transparent and fair manner so that the
petitioners

and

other

unit

holders

who

had

applied

for

regularization, till a decision could be made by the Standing
Committee, should not be in a disadvantageous position vis-à-vis
those who had not applied. The guidelines are as under :Those petitioners who have approached the MCD in pursuance
of the aforesaid order are exempted from sealing till their
applications are disposed off by the MCD in terms of the
aforesaid order.
Those persons who are not the petitioners in the aforesaid
orders but they have approached the MCD for the similar
action or similarly placed and as such are entitled to be
exempted from sealing in parity with the petitioners.
Those persons who have neither been petitioners nor
approached the MCD. These owners are not exempted from
sealing.

22.

According to the MCD, the sealing operation was carried out keeping
in view the aforesaid categorisation which was done in good faith.
Thereafter, on reconstitution of the Standing Committee, the
Chairman vide his order dated 22.5.2007 rejected the applications
for approval/requisition, which was ratified by the Standing
Committee

vide

Resolution

No.

118

dated

6.6.2007.

The

applications were rejected on the ground that as per MPD 2021,
these were to be considered under the policy to be formulated by
the DDA within two years. The MCD, however, has taken the stand
that in view of Clause 7.6.1, which recognises the problems and is
WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 20 of 25

binding on the MCD, till the time the guidelines are framed, it is not
possible to consider individual cases and, therefore, mandate of
Clause 7.6.1, in the meantime, is to be respected which allows the
existing sub-divisions to continue. The MCD‟s perception about the
said clause is as under :“12. …..This mandate, being the part of the MPD 2021, has
also to be appreciated and respected. It is the understanding of
MCD that so long as this clause exists, due consideration has
got to be given to it, because being a part of the Master Plan,
MCD is equally obliged to follow it.
To add further, to the best information of MCD, there is no
specific stay by any Hon‟ble Court on the operation of Clause
7.6.1 of MPD 2021.
13.
In the light of this, it is the understanding of MCD that if
“the existing sub-division to continue”, then sealing cannot be
resorted to.”

23.

The MCD has filed further affidavit dated 28.9.2007 in which the
following stand is taken by it insofar as provisions of para 7.6.1 of
MPD 2021 are concerned :“10. That the stand of the MCD, as regards 7.6.1 of MPD
2021, the same has already been put on record by way of
affidavit dated 2828.05.07 in which it was pointed out that
looking to the ground realities and the provisions of MPD
2021, the LOSC observed that the subdivisions can now be
considered only as per the provisions of Master Plan 2021
notified by the Government of India on 07.02.2007 and since
the provisions of MPD 2021 referred to further densification of
the plots by subdivisions to accommodate the larger number of
industries, subject to the guidelines for re-development which
shall be framed within two years of the notification of the
Master Plan by DDA in consultation with GNCTD and local
body and since the earlier parameters are no longer relevant in
the changed scenario and extensive industries are not permitted
in the city of National Capital Territory of Delhi, it has been
decided that the applications of the petitioners cannot be
considered on the same parameters which were applicable in
MPD 1962 besides for the redevelopment of the existing
planned industrial areas, guidelines for the redevelopment have

WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 21 of 25

to be framed by DDA within two years and till such time
existing subdivisions may be allowed to continue.
The
Standing Committee has approved the recommendations
whereby applications made for approval of subdivisions at
Najafgarh Road Industrial Area have been rejected in view of
the policy which is yet to be formulated by DDA. As per MPD
2021 these are to be considered under the policy to be
formulated by DDA within two years of the notification of
Master Plan 2021. Till such policy is formulated the status quo
may continue keeping in view the provisions of para 7.6.1 of
MPD 2021. In view of this, the sealed properties may kindly
be allowed to be de-sealed to maintain parity till a policy/
guidelines is framed by the DDA as envisaged in 7.6.1 and 7.8
of MPD 2021.”

24.

Learned counsel for the MCD had made a categorical averment that
insofar as MCD is concerned, in view of the aforesaid position, it had
no objection if the premises are de-sealed and, in fact, wanted to deseal the premises and was awaiting the orders of the Court. It may
be noted that learned counsel for the DDA had gone to the extent of
arguing that Clause 7.6.1 of MPD 2021 does not permit sub-divisions,
which interpretation is not accepted by Rekha Sharma, J. as well in
her separate opinion. However, in spite of repeated demands of
counsel for the petitioners that DDA should also give its official stand
on Clause 7.6.1 as done by the MCD, nothing is filed and learned
counsel for the DDA scuttled this on the premise that since it was
merely an interpretation of Clause 7.6.1, he could make the
submissions on this aspect without filing any reply of the DDA.

25.

I am, thus, of the opinion that once it is accepted that in the Master
Plan, as per Clause 7.6.1, the sub-divisions are allowed to continue
till the time a policy/guidelines is framed by the DDA, for which it is
granted two years, and on this aspect both the Members of the

WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 22 of 25

Bench are unanimous, sealing should not continue in view of my
detailed discussion hereinabove.

I may note that MPD 2021 has

already been challenged before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court. Even
when the said petition is entertained, the Apex Court has refused to
grant stay of the operation of this MPD. Not only this, orders are
passed not to take any action in respect of those properties which
conform to MPD 2021.

26.

Therefore, the premises belonging to the petitioners can be ordered
to be de-sealed by putting some fetters on these petitioners. In the
circumstances, I am of the view that these petitions warrant to be
allowed and it is directed that the premises of the petitioners be desealed subject to the following :(a)

the petitioners or occupiers thereof would not carry out further
constructions or alterations on these premises;

(b)

they would not create third party rights or transfer these plots
to any other person in the meantime and would not change
the present activity;

(c)

the petitioners shall abide by and conform to the policy/
guidelines that would be framed by the DDA;

(d)

the petitioners shall abide by the orders that would ultimately
be passed by the Supreme Court while deciding the issue
relating to MPD 2021;

(e)

any constructions which were carried out after 1.1.2006 shall
be demolished, as per the directions given earlier; and

WP (C) Nos. 13895-918/2006

Page 23 of 25

(f)

the petitioners shall file affidavits of undertaking in this behalf
within one week and on filing these affidavits, the premises
shall be de-sealed by the MCD forthwith.

27.

It would, however, be open to the MCD as well as the Court
Commissioner to inspect these premises at any time in order to find
as to whether there is any violation of the aforesaid undertakings. If
it is found that any of the petitioners has violated any of the terms of
the undertakings, not only the premises shall be sealed again, such
petitioner(s) shall be liable for contempt as well.

28.

These petitions are disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
