the Judgment?

A.K. SIKRI, J.
:
1. In this petition, the petitioner impugns the order dated 2.1.1998
passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal (in short the ‘Tribunal’)
in her application refusing her to grant the relief of giving her

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 1

seniority at serial no.432-A in the seniority list issued on 1.1.1982
wherein her name figures at serial no.550. Before we advert to the
basis on which the petitioner laid her claim in the application under
Section 9 of the Administrative Tribunal Act (in short the ‘Act’), it
would be necessary to recapitulate some basis facts.
2. The petitioner joined as an Income-Tax Officer (Group A) on 6.8.1977
on the basis of Combined Competitive Examination held by the Union
Public Service Commission (UPSC). There were various persons who
joined the said service along with the petitioner. Merit list was
prepared by the UPSC in respect of all those selected and the
petitioner was assigned the place at serial no.21-A in the said Group.
3. Next promotion is to the post of Assistant Commissioner of IncomeTax. She was considered for this post along with her batch mates of
the year 1977 by the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC).
After

considering

the

eligible

candidates

and

on

the

recommendations of the DPC, the Promotion Order dated
26.12.1986 was issued promoting certain Income-Tax (Group A)
Senior Scale Officers to the post of Assistant Commissioner of
Income-Tax on officiating basis with effect from the date (as they
take over charge until further orders). The name of the petitioner

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 2

was, however, missing from this list, though some persons junior to
her in her batch were given promotion. Aggrieved by this omission,
she submitted a representation dated 27.1.1987 seeking review of
the decision of the DPC and also praying for promotion to the said
post with her seniority intact. This representation was, however,
rejected on 3.3.1987 stating that her case was considered by the DPC
and her name could not be included in the select panel on overall
assessment of her record and decision in this behalf was final. The
petitioner filed OA No.1797/1987 before the Tribunal claiming that
as per her seniority, her rightful place is between serial no.21 and 22.
This OA was, however, withdrawn by her on 9.12.1991.
Subsequently, Civil List of the year 1991 was issued wherein she was
shown at serial no.550 with 1979 batch. Claiming that she belonged
to original batch of 1977 and as a consequence thereof her name
should have figured at serial no.432-A in respect of serial no.550, she
filed OA No.1753/1993, which has been dismissed by the impugned
judgment and order dated 2.1.1998 by the Tribunal.
4. There is a background because of which the petitioner was ignored
for promotion in the year 1986 when her batch mates were
promoted to the post of Assistant Commissioner of Income-Tax.

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 3

During the year 1981-82 when the petitioner was holding the post of
Assistant Director of Investigation (Special Investigation), the
Reporting Officer was the Deputy Director of Investigation (Special
Investigation) and Reviewing Officer was the Director of Investigation
(Special Investigation).
5. The Initiating Officer, i.e. the Reporting Officer gave her the grading
of ‘Very Good’ in that year, i.e. the year 1981-82 in her Annual
Confidential Report (ACR). However, the reviewing authority, i.e. the
Director gave the final grading as ‘Good’. The petitioner alleges that
she came to know of this fact much subsequently as she was not
communicated the aforesaid confidential report.

Her submission

before the Tribunal was that the report of the petitioner, as recorded
by the Initiating Officer, i.e. ‘Very Good’ was not reviewed by the
reviewing authority in accordance with the instructions laid down for
the purpose in the DOPT OM dated 22.5.1975. Precise submission in
this behalf is that as per the said OM, the Reporting/Reviewing and
Endorsing Officer should have been acquainted with the work of the
official/official reported upon for at least three months during the
period covered by the confidential reports, which requirement the
reviewing officer did not specify as he was posted as the Director of

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 4

Inspection for less than three months in the relevant period and had,
therefore, not been the reviewing officer for at least three months.
6. Likewise, during the year 1983-84 when the petitioner was posted at
Meerut as Income-Tax Officer, while recording her ACR for the year
1983-84, she was given the remarks ‘Not as yet’ (fit for promotion)
against the column ‘Fitness of the Officer for Promotion’. These,
according to the petitioner, were the remarks which should have
been communicated to her in view of the aforesaid OM dated
22.5.1975. However, no such remarks were communicated to her.
7. Thus, the case of the petitioner before the Tribunal was that the
exercise undertaken by the DPC, while considering her case for
promotion, was erroneous inasmuch as, neither the ACR in the year
1981-82 with the grading ‘Good’ nor the remarks in her ACR in the
year 1983-84 to the effect that she was not fit for promotion could
be taken into consideration. That was the raison d’ etre for claiming
review DPC, which was not done.
Order of the Tribunal:
8. When we go through the order of the Tribunal to find out as to in
what manner the aforesaid contentions of the petitioner were
bestowed considered by it, we notice that there was a preliminary

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 5

objection raised by the respondent, namely, the OA filed by the
petitioner was barred by limitation. This objection was premised on
the

submission

that

the

petitioner

had

earlier

filed

OA

No.1797/1987, which was withdrawn by her by filing MP
No.2665/1991 on the ground that she wanted to implead some more
parties as the respondents. This prayer was granted by the Tribunal
vide order dated 9.12.1991. However, thereafter she filed another
MP No.1765/92, which was dismissed on merits on 10.8.1992.
Contention of the respondent was that even the first OA No.1797/87,
which was subsequently withdrawn, was barred by limitation and
thereafter filing the first OA does not extend the period of limitation
if the original cause of action itself was barred by limitation. It was
also contended that even the second OA, i.e. OA in question was
barred by limitation. Even in the present OA, although the petitioner
has challenged the Civil List of 1991 whereby her seniority has been
shown with the 1979 batch instead of her original batch of 1977, the
relief sought for by her is that she may be placed at serial no.21-A of
the order dated 26.12.1986 and she may be considered for grant of
selection grade in the post of DCIT along with 1977 batch officers.
She has further sought relief that entry in her ACR for the year 1981-

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 6

82 as well as the entry in the year 1983-84 may be deleted. The
petitioner has been raising the issues which are more than a decade
old in the garb of attacking the Civil List of 1991. It was further
submitted that in the seniority list of 1988, her name was shown
below Sh. O.G. Rao and above Sh. R.P. Srivastava, i.e., at the same
place where it has been shown in the Civil List of 1991. Her name
was at the same position in the Civil List as on 1.5.1990 also. Hence,
she should have challenged the Civil List published in 1988. There is
no fresh cause of faction by virtue of the publication of the Civil List
of 1991. The respondents have contended that in view of the above
submissions, the OA is barred by limitation and deserves to be
summarily dismissed. We may note that when the second OA, i.e.
OA No.1753/93 was filed in which the impugned order is passed,
certain objections were raised inasmuch as the OA was filed on
8.12.1992, which was returned to her counsel on 10.12.1992 with
office objection and after removing the objections completely, the
OA was ultimately filed only on 23.8.1993.

However, those

objections were not removed with the stipulated period and
therefore, the petitioner had filed MP No.2534/93 seeking
condonation of delay in removing the objections stating that the

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 7

delay occurred due to bone fide error on the part of the clerk and the
briefing Advocate in the office of the counsel for the petitioner. The
Tribunal dismissed the OA as time barred primarily on the ground
that though the first OA was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to
file fresh one, if so advised, vide order dated 9.12.1991, no fresh OA
impleading some more parties had been filed with reference to the
cause of action which arose in 1986 on the basis of which the first OA
was filed. It may be noted that the first OA was filed in the year 1987
against her supersession in the matter of promotion by the
respondents vide their letter dated 26.12.1986.

The Tribunal,

therefore, opined that if this OA was withdrawn only on the ground
that the petitioner wanted to implead some more parties, fresh OA
should have been filed on the same cause of action. However, in the
second OA, the applicant challenged the Civil List of 1991. In the
interregnum, Civil Lists of 1988 and 1990 were also issued, which
were never challenged.

The Tribunal, thus, opined that the

petitioner ought to have filed a fresh OA, if she so desired, within the
period of limitation prescribed under the Act. However, this was not
done and impugning the Civil List of 1991 alone, OA was filed in the
year 1993. The petitioner had also taken the plea of continuous

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 8

cause of action, which was rejected by the Tribunal. The Tribunal
also dismissed the MP seeking condontation of delay in re-filing the
OA.
9. We are of the opinion that the approach of the Tribunal in this behalf
is not entirely correct as certain issues are mixed up. First issue is as
to whether the OA was filed within limitation or not and the second
issue is as to whether the application for condonation of delay in refiling the OA after removing the objection could be allowed or not. In
so far as filing of the first OA is concerned, the Tribunal has itself
stated that after taking liberty to file fresh OA, when the first OA was
dismissed as withdrawn, second OA should have been filed within a
period of one year, which is the limitation prescribed under Section
21 of the Act. First OA was dismissed as withdrawn on 9.12.1991.
Second OA was filed on 8.12.1992. It was, thus, filed within one year.
Of course, when the office had put objection, the petitioner after
removing the objection had re-filed it several times but did not
remove the objections in entirely and therefore, the registry of the
CAT had returned the OA with objections only on 23.8.1993. The
Tribunal took this date of re-filing as the date of filing of the OA and
thus, treated it as time barred. This could not have been done

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 9

without first considering the MP for condonation of delay in re-filing.
Of course, if there was no sufficient cause to condone the delay in refiling, the OA could have been treated as filed only in the year 2003.
However, the Tribunal pre-supposed that the OA was filed in the
year 2003 without first dealing with the MP for condonation of delay
in removing the objection and re-filing the OA.
10.In so far as the dismissal of the MP for condonation of delay in refiling the OA is concerned, while dismissing the same, the Tribunal
took note of two judgment of the Supreme Court, namely, Ratam
Chandra Sammenta and ors. v. Union of India and Ors., JT 1993 (3) SC
418 and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India & Ors., JT 1997 (3) SC
589, which dealt with the limitation period in filing the OA under
Section 21 of the Act and the principle laid down is that as per
Section 21, the limitation period of one year is to be strictly
construed and if an aggrieved person sleeps over the right without
approaching a judicial forum within the prescribed time, he loses his
remedy as well as his rights under the law.

Noting these two

judgments in paras 15 and 16, the Tribunal while dismissing the MP
recorded as under:“In view of the foregoing discussion and the
well settled legal position, we are of the
WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 10

opinion that the aforesaid MP No.2354/93
for condonation of delay in removing the
objections and refilling the present OA, is
absolutely devoid of any merit or
jurisdiction as per the decisions of the Apex
Court in Rathore’s case (supra) and other
cases, and deserves to be dismissed. We
find that the present OA is clearly barred by
limitation and can be dismissed on this
ground itself.”

11.This approach is again erroneous. It is stated at the cost of repetition
that the aforesaid two judgments dealt with limitation period in filing
the OA and not with the condonation of delay in re-filing the OA after
removing the objection, though the OA originally filed was within the
period of limitation. The Tribunal should have considered as to
whether the delay caused in removing the objection was
satisfactorily explained, i.e. the reason given, namely, the delay
occurred because of bona fide error on the part of the clerk and the
briefing Advocate in the office of the counsel for the petitioner, was
sufficient or not.

However, we find that the Tribunal has also

observed that the MP for condonation of delay in removing the
objection is not accompanied by any affidavit of the briefing counsel
or the counsel’s clerk. The application should have been dismissed
on this ground in any case and therefore, we are of the opinion that

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 11

the MP was rightly dismissed. If on that basis the conclusion is that
there is sufficient ground to condone the delay, the OA should have
been treated as filed on 8.12.2002, the day on which it was originally
filed. Only if the Tribunal after considering the application in right
perspective concluded that application was liable to be dismissed,
that OA should have been treated as filed on 23.8.1993 and could
have been dismissed as time barred.
12.Be that as it may, we are of the opinion that ultimately the OA is to
be treated as time barred for other reasons. The Tribunal is right to
the extent it has commented that when the first OA was dismissed as
withdrawn with liberty to file fresh OA only because while seeking
withdrawal of the first OA the reason given was that the petitioner
wanted to implead more parties in the OA, the proper course was to
file the second OA on the same cause of action on which first OA was
filed but impleading private respondents as well. The petitioner did
not do so. In the second OA, Civil List of 1991 is impugned. The
Tribunal, in these circumstances, rightly concluded that the Civil List
of 1991 was merely a repetition of Civil List of 1990 and 1988.
Furthermore, these lists were prepared on the basis of promotions
given to the officers in the year 1986 wherein the petitioner could

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 12

not get the promotion. At this stage, we may reproduce the reliefs
sought in the second OA:“(a) Order and direct the respondents to
the petitioner at Serial No.21A of the order
dated 26.12.86 and they be further ordered
and directed to consider the petitioner for
grant of selection grade in the post of
Deputy Commissioner Income Tax along
with 1977 batch officers to be considered in
January 1993 in accordance with the rules
and they be further ordered and restrained
from giving selection grade to the officers
junior to the petitioner on the basis of the
list of December, 1991, without considering
the petitioner in the first place;
(b) It is also further prayed that this
Hon’ble Tribunal may be pleased to order
and direct that the entry in the confidential
report of the petitioner for the year 198182 made by the Director be deleted and the
petitioner be considered with the entry
made in the confidential record by the
Deputy Director Income-Tax;
(c)
Further the Hon’ble Tribunal may be
pleased to order and direct that any
adverse entry/entries specially the entry
‘not as yet’ against the column fitness for
promotion in the year 1983-84 be deleted
and the petitioner be considered and given
her seniority.
(d) Any
other
or
further
orders/directions as this Hon’ble Tribunal
may deem fit and proper in the facts and
circumstances of the case may also be
passed.”
WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 13

13. In so far as relief (a) is concerned, the petitioner is seeking her
placement at serial No.21A in the order of initial appointment, which
was issued on 26.12.1986. Such a relief was admittedly time barred
even when the first OA was filed. In so far as reliefs (b) and (c) are
concerned, the petitioner, no doubt, sought correction in ACRs of the
years 1981-82 and 1983-84. But there is no relief claimed that there
should be review DPC for promotion to the post of Assistant
Commissioner of Income-Tax as of 1986.
14.The Tribunal is also right in holding that it was not a continuous cause
of action.
On merits:
15.As pointed out above, the ACR of 1981-82 as written by the
Reviewing officer is challenged on the ground that he was not posted
there for at least three months in the relevant period. No doubt, the
period was not three months but 86 days, which was short by about
4 days. In these circumstances, the Tribunal negative the contention
of the petitioner in the following words:-

“21. On a careful consideration of the
matter, we are of the view that the said
instructions under para 4(i) above, no doubt
specify a minimum period of three months
WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 14

acquaintance with the work of the official
reported upon. However, on the overall
view of the matter, we are of the opinion
that the tenor of those instructions do not
indicate that they are absolutely
mandatory. The reason, perhaps, could be
that if too technical a view is taken, even a
few days short fall in the aforesaid
minimum
period
for
reporting/reviewing/endorsing would result
in the actual period of work done by the
official being ignored for assessment. For
instance, in the present case itself, if the
period of 86 days of work under the
reviewing officer is to be ignored, the
concerned officer reported upon will have
the assessment of the reporting officer
alone without any review by the reviewing
officer which would not be desirable either
from the official’s point of view or from the
angle of administrative efficiency in the
Government or for the purpose of
consideration by the Departmental
Promotion Committee.”

16.We are of the view that the aforesaid opinion of the Tribunal, in the
facts and circumstances of this case, does not call for any
interference. The instructions on the subject, namely, OM dated
22.5.1975, no doubt, laid down that Reporting/Reviewing and
Endorsing Officers should have been acquainted with the work of the
official reported upon for at least three months during the period
covered by the confidential reports. The purpose is obvious, there

WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 15

should be sufficient time with these officers to acquaint themselves
with the work of the official in respect of which ACR is written. With
this objective in mind, three months’ period is prescribed. This
prescription is not in any statute or statutory rules or regulations.
This is mentioned in administrative instructions which have no
statutory force. In such a circumstance where in a given case it is
found that the Reviewing Officer had opportunity to know the work
of the petitioner for almost three months, as the period was short by
four days, it cannot be said that the limitation of three months is so
sacrosanct that even if it is missing by the mark few days, one is to
hold that said Reviewing Officer was incompetent to write the ACR.
In case of Chief Commercial Manager, South Central Railway,
Secunderabad and Ors. v. G. Ratnam and Ors., (2007) 8 SCC 212, the
Supreme Court in respect of such non statutory administrative
instructions had this say:-

“19. We have carefully gone through the
contents of various chapters of the
Vigilance Manual. Chapters II, III, VIII, IX
and Chapter XIII deal with Railway Vigilance
Organisation and its role. Central Vigilance
Commission,
Central
Bureau
of
Investigation, investigation of complaints by
Railway Vigilance, processing of vigilance
cases in Railway Board, suspension and
WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 16

relevant aspects of Railway Servants
(Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1968 as
relevant to vigilance work, etc. Paras 704
and 705, as noticed earlier, cover the
procedures and guidelines to be followed
by the investigating officers, who are
entrusted with the task of investigation of
trap cases and departmental trap cases
against the railway officials.
Broadly
speaking,
the
administrative
rules,
regulations and instructions, which have no
statutory force, do not give rise to any legal
right in favour of the aggrieved party and
cannot be enforced in a court of law against
the administration. The executive orders
appropriately so-called do not confer any
legally enforceable rights on any persons
and impose no legal obligation on the
subordinate authorities for whose guidance
they are issued. Such an order would
confer no legal and enforceable rights on
the delinquent even if any of the directions
is ignored, no right would lie. Their breach
may expose the subordinate authorities to
disciplinary or other appropriate action, but
they cannot be said to be in the nature of
statutory rules having the force of law,
subject to the jurisdiction of certiorari.
20. It is well settled that the Central
Government or the State Government can
give administrative instructions to its
servants how to act in certain
circumstances; but that will not make such
instructions statutory rules which are
justiciable in certain circumstances. In
order that such executive instructions have
the force of statutory rules, it must be
shown that they have been issued either
under the authority conferred on the
WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 17

Central Government or the State
Government by some statute or under
some provision of the Constitution
providing therefor. Therefore, even if there
has been any breach of such executive
instructions that does not confer any right
on any member of the public to ask for a
writ against the Government by a petition
under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India.
21. In State Bank of Patiala v. S.K.
Sharma, (1996( 3 SCC 364, this Court held
that in a case of a procedural provision
which is not of a mandatory character, the
complaint of violation has to be examined
from the standpoint of substantial
compliance. The order passed in violation
of such a provision can be set aside only
where such violation has occasioned
prejudice to the delinquent employee.
“The Court or the Tribunal should
inquire whether
(a) The provision violated is of a
substantive nature or
(b) whether it is procedural in
character?” *SCC p. 389, para 33(1)+

17.With this, we proceed with the ACR for the year 1983-84. Contention
of the petitioner was that a remark to the effect “not yet fit” for
promotion is to be treated as adverse remark and should have been
communicated. The respondents, on the other hand, had contended
that it was not an adverse remark as if the petitioner was treated as
not yet fit for the year 1983-84, it will have no consequence as that
WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 18

was only for the year 1983-84 in which year she was not even
considered for promotion. According to the respondents, the remark
did not rule the petitioner as ‘unfit’ which would have been adverse.
It was further pointed out that the aforesaid column in the ACR form
itself was deleted in the subsequent instructions dated 24.9.1989.
Moreover, the DPC assesses the fitness of officer for promotion by
taking into account various other aspects of performance.

The

Tribunal accepted the plea of the respondents with the following
remarks:“26. No doubt, the above provisions
indicate that any ‘adverse’ remarks have to
be communicated.
However, with
reference to the respondents contention as
noted above regarding the remark in
question not being adverse, the applicant
has not been able to refute the same with
any supporting material. She has also not
produced any model form of ACR for the
officers of her grade at the relevant time,
i.e. 1983-94. This would have been relevant
since it appears that there is no column
relating to ‘fitness for promotion’ in the
model form of ACR for officers of the level
of Section Officer and above upto the level
of Director (vide Department of Personnel
and
Administrative
Reforms
OM
th
No.35014/2/83-Estt(A) dated the 18 of
May, 1985) as mentioned in Swamy’s
compilation regarding Confidential Reports
of Central Government employees – 1995
(IVth Edition) at page 31.”
WP(C) No.3949/1998

Page 19

18.We are of the opinion that this view of the Tribunal in the facts and
circumstances of this case does not call for any interference.
19.We may note that the petitioner even now has not impleaded private
parties, though the first OA was withdrawn subsequently for this
purpose. We, therefore, dismiss the petition as devoid of merit but
with no orders as to costs.
