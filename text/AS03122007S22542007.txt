ARUNA SURESH, J. (Oral)
1. Present suit has been filed by the plaintiff firm and its
partners against defendants No.1 & 2 for declaration,
permanent and mandatory injunction. The maintainability
of

the

suit

is

under

question

before

the

Court.

Undisputedly, the plaintiff is an unregistered firm under
the Partnership Act.

An unregistered partnership firm

cannot file a suit for any of its claim against a third party.
Section 69 of the Partnership Act is a complete bar to filing

CS(OS) No. 2254/2007

Page 1 of 4

of a suit to enforce a right arising from a contract in a
court of law on or behalf of the firm against a third party
unless the firm is registered.

The relevant provisions of

Section 69 of the Partnership Act are reproduced as
below:-

“Effect of non-registration-(1) No suit to enforce a right
arising from a contract or
conferred by this Act shall be
instituted in any court by or on
behalf of any person suing as a
partner in a firm against the firm
or any person alleged to be or to
have been a partner in the firm
unless the firm is registered and
the person suing is or has been
shown in the Register of Firms as
a partner in the firm.
(2) No suit to enforce a
right arising from a contract shall
be instituted in any court by or on
behalf of a firm against any third
party unless the firm is registered
and the persons suing are or have
been shown in the Register of
Firms as partners in the firm.
(3).......
(4).......”
2. One of the facet of the mandatory character of this
provision is that as soon as it comes to the knowledge of
the Court that the requirement of the said Act has not been
observed, the Court can return the suit irrespective of
whether that point has been pleaded by a party/parties and
whatever be the stage of the suit. This is so because the

maintainability

of

a

suit

under

Section

69

of

the

Partnership Act is a question of law and such question of
law can be raised at any stage of the proceedings.

The

disability of an unregistered firm to sue is of crippling
nature and it is so compulsive and comprehensive that
there is no escape from it. Though the Act does not make
registration a mandate for any partnership firm to carry on
business but provisions of Section 69 of the Partnership Act
work out as an indirect compulsion for registration. Even
subsequent registration of the firm after the filing of the
suit cannot rectify the suit so filed by unregistered firm.

3. In the present case, plaintiff No. 1 which is an unregistered
firm has filed the suit to enforce a right arising out of a
contract with defendant No. 2.

Since the provisions of

Section 69 (2) of the Partnership Act bar such a suit,
present suit as filed by the plaintiff is not maintainable.
Simply because partners have also been arrayed in the list
of plaintiffs, does not make the suit maintainable because
bar under Section 69 of the Act still remains.

As per the

case of the plaintiffs themselves, defendant No. 1 had
entered into an agreement on 1.7.2004 with defendant No.
2 to sell her property No. I-1669, Chittranjan Park, New
Delhi, with a clear stipulation that the sale deed would be

CS(OS) No. 2254/2007

Page 3 of 4

executed after the property was got freehold and 'NOC'
was obtained. Allegedly an irrevocable power of attorney
was executed but I do not find any such attorney on the
record. Even the alleged agreement dated 1.7.2004 is not
a registered document and I find certain blanks at various
places in the copy placed on record.

It is defendant No. 2

who has further entered into agreement to sell the said
property with the plaintiffs again by an unregistered
agreement to sell dated 22.3.2005. On the face of it, suit of
the plaintiffs against defendant No. 1 is barred by period of
limitation as it has been filed to enforce the agreement to
sell dated 1.7.2004

and is not maintainable and also

obviously there is no privity of contract between the
plaintiffs and defendant No. 1. Undisputedly, plaintiffs are
not in possession of the property in suit.

Therefore, there

is no cause of action in favour of the plaintiff and against
the defendant No. 1.

4. Under these circumstances, I conclude that the suit filed by
the

plaintiffs

is

not

maintainable

and

the

same

is

accordingly dismissed with no orders to cost.
