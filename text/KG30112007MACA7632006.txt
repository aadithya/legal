KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
By way of this appeal the appellant seeks enhancement
in the compensation amount over and above the one
awarded by the Tribunal.
The facts of the case in a nutshell are as follows:
MAC.APP. No. 763/2006

page 1 of 5

Sh.Hem Chand Gupta, Sh.Neeraj Gupta, Sh.Himanshu
Gupta and Sh.Nitin Gupta were travelling in a Maruti car on
7.12.2000, while proceeding towards Anoopshahar from
Delhi via Hapur.

When they reached village Akdauli at

about 7.30 a.m., a truck bearing registration No. UP 14N
1551 being driven at a high speed and in a rash and
negligent manner collided with the Maruti car. As a result
of the accident all the incumbents of the Maruti car suffered
serious multiple injuries and were rushed to the nearest
Nursing Home at Hapur and were later referred to
Maharaja Agarsain Hospital, Delhi.

Four claim petitions

were filed before Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and all
the four petitions were disposed of by way of a common
order dated 20.5.2006.

Aggrieved with the said order

present appeal is preferred by the appellant.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and
perused the records. Counsel for the appellant contends
that a lump sum amount of Rs. 50,000/- towards the
permanent disability suffered by the appellant has been
MAC.APP. No. 763/2006

page 2 of 5

awarded by the Tribunal without taking into consideration
the fact that the appellant was preparing for the entrance
exam of MBBS. The appellant further contends that he
could not prepare himself to appear in the entrance exam of
MBBS.
Per contra counsel appearing for the respondent
contends that the Tribunal has already awarded appropriate
compensation in favour of the appellant after taking due
consideration of the permanent disability of 20% suffered by
him. Counsel states that once the Tribunal itself has
granted a fair compensation, therefore, the Appellate Court
may not interfere to enhance the said compensation amount
further.
Perusal of the impugned Award shows that the
Tribunal has granted a lump sum amount of Rs. 50,000/towards permanent disability suffered by the appellant. It is
not in dispute that the appellant had completed his senior
secondary exam and was preparing for his MBBS exam. It is
also not in dispute that it is only because of the injury
MAC.APP. No. 763/2006

page 3 of 5

sustained by the appellant that he could not appear in the
entrance exam of the MBBS. It is also thus not in dispute
that the precious one year of the appellant was lost due to
the said injury. It is also not disputed that the appellant has
suffered disability to the extent of 20% and as per the
deposition of PW-4 his recovery from the said disablement
would not be easy. Since the appellant had completed his
senior secondary examination, therefore, resort can be
made to the Minimum Wages Act for correctly assessing the
notional income of the appellant on the relevant date of the
accident

i.e. 7.12.2000.

The Minimum

Wages

for

matriculate person were Rs. 2972/-. The same can be taken
at Rs. 3,000/- as a round figure and taking 20% of the said
income the yearly loss towards permanent disablement
would come to Rs.7,200/-. The appellant was of the age of
17 years at the time of the accident, therefore, the
appropriate multiplier as per the second Schedule is 16.
Applying the said multiplier to the multiplicand of Rs.
7,200/-

the

total

loss

the

permanent

disablement would come to Rs.1,15,200/-.
In the light of the above discussion, I enhance the said
compensation amount from Rs. 50,000/- as awarded in
favour of the appellant towards permanent disablement to
rS.1,15,200/-. The appellant has already received the
amount of compensation as awarded by the Tribunal. The
differential amount now shall be paid by the respondent
with interest @ 6% from the date of the filing of the petition
till realisation.
With these directions the appeal is disposed of.
