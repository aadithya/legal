MADAN B. LOKUR, J.

This appeal is consequential to and dependant upon the decision
in ITA No.112/2006 (Commissioner of Income Tax v. M/s Capital
Flour Mills Pvt. Ltd.).

2.

Since we find that the view taken by the Tribunal, which is the

subject matter of ITA No.112/2006, cannot be faulted with, there is no
merit in this appeal.

3.

No substantial question of law arises for consideration.

Dismissed.
