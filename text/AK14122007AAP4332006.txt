ANIL KUMAR, J. (Oral)

1.

This is a petition under Section 11(6) of Arbitration & Conciliation

Act, 1996 for appointment of an arbitrator for adjudication of disputes
which have arisen between the parties.

2.

The petitioner contended that he is a registered contractor of the

respondent and was awarded a work of construction of a community hall at
Matiala Village by the respondents through its Executive Engineer – VI vide
work order No.EE-VI/plan/TC/01-02/177 dated 14th September, 2001 and
an amount of Rs.87,69,550/- was payable to the petitioner for the work

AA No.433/2006

awarded to him.

The agreement was executed between the parties and

clause 25 incorporated the arbitration agreement between the parties.

3.

The petitioner contended that as per the terms of the agreement, the

work was to start on 23rd September, 2001 and was to be completed on or
before 22nd March, 2002 within six months. The petitioner started work on
23rd September, 2001 and completed on 10th November, 2004.

4.

It is asserted that during the subsistence of the agreement, the

petitioner had demanded the structural drawings of pile foundation and the
building of the work.

In the process of pile foundation, the rocks in the

area were cut which led to sub soil water coming out from earth which had
to be de-watered for which the petitioner incurred expenses which were
demanded by the petitioner, however, the amounts were not paid despite the
demands raised from time to time. According to the petitioner, the amounts
on account of double stage shuttering, extra costs incurred on construction
of round pillar and the expenses incurred for the watch and ward for the
period of nine months also have not been paid.

5.

Consequently disputes have arisen between the parties. According to

the petitioner clause 25 of the general agreement entered into between the
petitioner and the respondents contains the Arbitration agreement. Clause
25 of the agreement containing the arbitration agreement is as under:-

AA No.433/2006

Page 2 of 7

“25. Except where otherwise provided in the contract all
questions and disputes relating to the meaning of the
specifications, designs, drawings and instructions herein
before mentioned and as to the quality of workmanship of
materials used on the work or as to any other question claim,
right matter or thing whatsoever in any way arising out or
relating to the contract designs, drawings, specifications,
estimates instructions orders or these conditions or otherwise
concern in the work or the execution of the failure to execute
the same whether arising during the progress of the work or
after the completion or abandonment shall be referred to the
sole arbitrator appointed by the Commissioner, MCD. The
parties to the dispute shall be found to abide by the terms of
the award passed by the Arbitrator.”

6.

The petitioner has raised various other claims, however no payments

were made by the respondent, therefore, the petitioner issued a legal notice
dated 14th August, 2006 requesting the respondent to pay the amounts due
to him along with interest at 18% per annum, and in the alternative had
sought for appointment of an arbitrator in terms of clause 25 of the
arbitration agreement between the parties. The respondents not only failed
to make payments to the petitioner but also failed to appoint an arbitrator in
terms of arbitration agreement between the parties within the stipulated
time.

7.

Consequently, the petitioner has filed the present petition. The

arbitrator was not appointed by the respondents even before filing of the
present petition. Despite opportunity given, the respondents have not filed
any reply to the petition. The learned counsel for the respondents, however,
is unable to point out as to how the Commissioner of the respondents can
appoint a sole arbitrator in terms of clause 25 of the general agreement after
failing to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days of notice and before filing

AA No.433/2006

Page 3 of 7

of the present petition. Consequently it is for this Court to appoint an
arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes between the parties.

8.

The Apex Court in Datar Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance Ltd. &

Anr., IV (2000) CLT 191 (SC)=VII (2000) SLT 543=JT 2000 (Suppl. 2) SC 226
had held that if the vacancy of an arbitrator is not filled till a party
approaches the Court and files a petition for appointment by the designated
authority of the Chief Justice of that Court under Section 11(6) of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the right to supply vacancy by the opposite
party is extinguished. This ratio of Datar Switchgear Ltd.(supra) was
approved by the Supreme Court in Punj Lloyed Ltd. Vs Petronet MHB Ltd.,
(2006) 2 SCC 628 and it was reiterated that once period of notice had lapsed
and the petitioner had moved under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996, the party having right to appoint arbitrator under
arbitral agreement loses the right to do so.

9.

A learned Single Judge in Haryana Telecom Ltd. v. Union of India &

Anr., 112 (2004) DLT 339=2004 (3) RAJ 147, had held that if the respondent
fails to appoint an Arbitrator within the stipulated time of 30 days of the
notice, and even after filing of the petition under Section 11 of the Act, it is
for the Court to appoint an Arbitrator.

A Division Bench of this Court in

Delkon (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. G.M., Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., 120 (2005)
DLT 542 (DB), relying on Datar Switchgears Ltd Vs Tata Finance Ltd has
held para in 4 as under:

AA No.433/2006

Page 4 of 7

“4. We have given our careful consideration to the arguments
advanced by learned Counsel for both the parties. In view of
the law laid down in the case of Datar Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata
Finance Ltd. & Anr., IV (2000) CLT 191 (SC)=VII (2000) SLT
543=JT 2000 (Suppl. 2) SC 226 it is no more res integra that
the vacancy can be supplied by a party pursuant to the
arbitration agreement even after thirty days of the receipt of the
notice. However, once a party approaches the Court and files a
petition for appointment by the designated authority of the Chief
Justice of that Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, the right to supply vacancy by the opposite
party is extinguished. If that right stood extinguished on filing
of the petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, in September 1998 the appointment of an
Arbitrator on 3rd May, 1999 could not be made, therefore in
our view, the order passed by the learned Single Judge on 7th
May, 1999 suffers from patent illegality. Therefore, the
submission of the respondent that the petitioner had appeared
before the Arbitrator and the application of the petitioner
raising preliminary objections is pending adjudication which
inter alia challenges the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to decide
the dispute is of no consequence as from the order reproduced
above it was pursuant to the directions passed by the learned
Single Judge that the parties were directed to appear before the
Arbitrator. The petitioner had no other option but to appear
before the Arbitrator and after appearing before the Arbitrator
the petitioner has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the
Arbitrator, rather has at first opportunity taken the objection
that the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to proceed with the
matter.

10.

In Union of India v. M/s. R.R. Industries, 120 (2005) DLT 572 (DB)

also it was held that once a party does not supply the vacancy or fails to
supply the vacancy before filing of a petition under Section 11(6) of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, such a party forfeits the right to supply the
vacancy in terms of the arbitration clause and what remains is only the
arbitration clause, i.e. the dispute has to be resolved under the mechanism
of alternative dispute redressal scheme but no right survives to the
respondent to supply the named Arbitrator in the arbitration clause.

The notice dated 14th August, 2006 was sent by UPC and by

registered

A.D.

post.

The

petitioner

has

produced

the

copy

of

acknowledgment card showing the receipt of the notice. Despite the receipt
of the notice demanding appointment of an arbitrator, the respondent did
not appoint an arbitrator within 30 days of receipt of notice nor any
arbitrator was appointed prior to filing of the present petition.

12.

The petition under Section 11(6) was filed in October 2006 and no

reply has been filed by the respondent despite various opportunities given to
the respondent. The respondents also failed to reply to the notice dated 14 th
August, 2006 demanding the amounts due from the respondent to the
petitioner and in the alternative had sought for appointment of an
arbitrator. In the circumstances, the statement made by the petitioner are
deemed to be admitted and the respondent has forfeited, its right to appoint
an arbitrator in terms of clause 25 as there is a valid arbitration agreement
between the parties. The existence of the Arbitration agreement has not been
disputed by the respondent and nothing has been shown contrary to
agreement.

13.

Considering the facts and circumstances, I appoint Mr.G.P.Thareja

Advocate, (Retd. Additional District Judge) B-201, Priyadarshini Apartments,
I.P Extension, Patpar Ganj, Delhi-110092 (Ph:20906899) as an Arbitrator to
adjudicate all the disputes between the parties. The fee of the arbitrator
shall be Rs.7,000/- per hearing subject to a maximum fees of Rs.1,05,000
