JUDGMENT

%
:

18.02.2008
DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ. (ORAL)

CM No.1806/2007 (condonation of delay)
1.

This is an application filed by the appellant praying for

condonation of delay of 347 days in filing the present appeal. The
impugned judgment and order as against which the present
appeal was filed was passed on 23.12.2005.

Admittedly, the

counsel appearing for the DTC applied for a certified copy and
received the same on 28.01.2006. It is also stated in the application
filed by the appellant praying for condonation of delay that the
certified copy of the order was also forwarded to the appellant by
the contesting Advocate with the advise that the appeal should be
filed.

Yet, no such appeal was filed immediately and the same

ultimately came to be filed in this Court only on 18.12.2006. Then
also, there were certain objections which were pointed out to the
appellant and the appeal was finally refiled on 2nd January, 2007,
whereafter it was again taken back and finally it was filed on 2nd
February, 2007.
2.

We have perused the application filed by the appellant

wherein reasons have been given praying for condonation of delay.
On going through the records, however, we do not find that any
particulars in support of the reasons have been set out in the
application. In fact, the ground taken and the reasons given for the
delay appear to us to be an afterthought. The delay is sought to be
explained on account of procedural matters, which, in our
considered opinion, would not sufficiently explain the delay as
required under the law and as settled by the various decisions of the
Supreme Court. We refer to the decision of the Division Bench of this
Court in General Manager, Northern Railway vs. Vishwa Nath
Nangia reported in 198 (2005) DLT 286 wherein the Division Bench of
this Court has held as follows:
“......Counsel for the applicant further submits
that the petitioner being a Government body, a
liberal approach should be taken by the Court.
Law of limitation remains the same whether it is a
Govt. or a private party. What has to be noticed
is whether the delay has been caused on
account of some procedural matter or on
account of the department being too unwieldy.
The impugned order having being passed on
22.4.2004, the reasons for condoning the delay
has not been explained. If there is a private
party before us, we expect delay of each day to
be explained so that sufficient cause is shown for

not filing the petition in time. In the present case
before us, in paragraph 5, what to talk of any
specific dates, the reasons given are too vague
and general.....”
On going through the records we are satisfied that there is no

proper explanation of the delay of as long as 347 days in filing the
present appeal. The stand taken is that there was delay in giving
effect to the order of the learned Single Judge and of the Industrial
Adjudicator of reinstating the workman. We do not consider this
reason enough for withholding of filing of the appeal, for, if the
appellant desired to file an appeal, they could have filed the
appeal without his reinstatement seeking for stay of the judgment,
which is also filed and is on record as of now.
4.

In that view of the matter and considering the facts and

circumstances of the case, we are of the considered opinion that
the appellant has been careless and negligent in filing the present
appeal.

Delay of the aforesaid nature cannot and should be

condoned. Consequently, the application seeking for condonation
of delay is dismissed.
LPA 107/2007 and CM No.1805/2007 (stay)
Consequently, LPA 107/2007 and CM No.1805/2007 also stand
dismissed.
