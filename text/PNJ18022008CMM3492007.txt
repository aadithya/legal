PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

The petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated

14.2.2007 disposing of an application filed by the wife claiming
maintenance under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.
Rs.10,000/- per month has been directed to be paid by the
petitioner to his wife.
2.

The wife is admittedly working as a stenographer in

the District Courts and is drawing a gross monthly salary of
CM(M) No.349/2007

Page 1 of 11

Rs.24,516/- as of November 2006. Deductions per month are
Rs.5,185/-. In other words the wife has a take home income of
about Rs.19,000/-.
3.

Two children, a son and a daughter were born to the

parties. The son was born on 17.2.1988. The daughter was
born on 22.6.1994. Technically, the son being major, petitioner
is entitled to urge that he is not responsible to pay any money
for the upkeep of the son.
4.

But I note that the son is still a student and his

mother is spending money for his upkeep.
5.

I would be expanding on this a little later.

6.

With respect to the income of the husband, the

Matrimonial Judge has recorded that the petitioner is not
truthfully disclosing his income. I note that the petitioner took
a stand that his gross annual income does not exceed Rs.1.2
lacs.

Disbelieving the said version of the petitioner, learned

Tribunal has noted as under:“In the year 1988-89, the defendant was able to
earn commission for his LIC agency to the tune of
Rs.80,000/- which went up to about Rs.1,00,000/in the next year and it kept on increasing year after
year. In the year 1990, the defendant has loaned
Rs.30,000/- to R.L.Dewan and managed to invest
Rs.30,000/- in the NSC. The documents indicate
that the investments and savings kept on
increasing and even he has been generously
loaning money to the other persons and even
gifted Rs.20,000/- to one Mr. S.K.Gandhi. A gift to
CM(M) No.349/2007

Page 2 of 11

Naresh Arora to the tune of Rs.10,000/- was given
and even a plot was also purchased in the year
1993 in Sainik Vihar so on and so forth. Against
the backdrop of the facts and circumstances, the
defendant is claiming that he is earning much less
than the plaintiff whereas he has cash in hand as
on 31.3.2004 to the tune of Rs.1,60,000/- and odd
Rupees, which kept on increasing year after year,
so is the case with the bank accounts of the
defendant, but when it comes to provide for his
wife and children, the defendant finds it a bit
cumbersome and financial constrains block his
way.”
7.

At the hearing held on 14.2.2008 it was urged by

learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner was
working as an agent with Life Insurance Corporation and that
his income was by way of commission received from LIC. With
reference to the profit and loss account and income tax returns
for the period ending 31.3.2003, 31.3.2004 and 31.3.2005 it
was urged that the annual income from professional earnings
as reflected therein as also reflected in the income tax returns
was around Rs.1.2 lacs per annum. Counsel thus urged that
the Matrimonial Judge could not have returned a presumptive
finding of income. Second contention urged was that the wife
had occupied the matrimonial house and was not paying any
rent. On the contrary, the husband was forced to shift out and
take a premises on rent.

It was urged that said aspect has

been ignored by the Matrimonial Judge. Lastly, it was urged
that the income of the wife at Rs.20,000/- per month has been
CM(M) No.349/2007

Page 3 of 11

ignored by the Matrimonial Judge.
8.

In the decision reported as AIR 1997 SC 3397 Jasbir

Kaur Vs. D.J.Dehradun in para 7 it was observed by their
Lordships in the Supreme Court as under:“It does appear to us from the affidavit of the husband
that it conceals more than what it tells of his income
and other assets. Attempt has been made to conceal
his true income and that leads us to draw an adverse
inference against the husband about his income that it
is much more than what is being disclosed to us. The
claim of the husband that from an income of
Rs.4,750/- per month which is getting from Mukul
International Pvt. Ltd. he has to maintain himself, his
two sons and daughter is absurd particularly when the
eldest son is earning more than the husband and it is
the husband who is living with him. Husband has also
not disclosed retiral benefits if any from the ONGC and
the amount of provident fund he obtained form there.
Husband has interest income from Unit Trust of India
and also from the fixed deposit receipts but again he
has not disclosed the number of units he is holding
and the amount of the fixed deposits in his name.
From all these we have to hold that the annual income
of the respondent-husband is even on modest
estimate to be Rs.2,40,000/- annually which would
come to Rs.20,000/- per month.
Considering the
diverse claims made by the parties one inflating the
income and the other suppressing an element of
conjecture and guess work does enter for arriving at
the income of the husband. It cannot be done by any
mathematical precision.”
9.

I need not note any other authority to bring home

the legal preposition that where a party does not truthfully
disclose its income an element of conjuncture and guess work
has to inevitably enter in the decision making process.

The aforesaid statement of affairs makes interesting

reading. For the year 1.4.2002-31.3.2003 petitioner has paid
LIC premium in sum of Rs.74,522.60/-.

In the next year

nothing has been shown as paid towards LIC premium but
thereafter for the year 1.4.2004-31.3.2005 LIC premium has
been paid in sum of Rs.83,378/-.
12.

Further, for the period 1.4.2002-31.3.2003 petitioner

has invested Rs.45,000/- in a fixed deposit with a bank. The
petitioner has cash in hand at the close of the financial year in
sum of Rs.77,821/- besides approximately Rs.20,000/- in the
bank.

Similarly, for the next financial year i.e. 1.4.2003-

31.3.2004 petitioner has shown cash in hand in sum of
Rs.1,06,687.77 besides approximately Rs.40,000/- in the bank.
For the next financial year cash in hand has increased to
Rs.1,45,634.15/-. Cash lying in bank is approximately Rs.1.69
lacs.

In the said financial year jewellery worth Rs.30,000/-

were also been purchased.

CM(M) No.349/2007

Page 9 of 11

13.

It is impossible to accept that a person who earns a

net income of Rs.1.2 lacs would have such heavy investments
in LIC policies as also would retain such huge sums in cash or
in saving bank account.
14.

In the profit and loss account it would be interesting

to note that the husband has been showing having paid
salaries to staff in sum of Rs.1.08 lacs per annum.
15.

According to the wife her husband operates without

any support staff.
16.

It is obviously a case where the petitioner is

resorting to jugglery of figures.

The only clue of the true

income of the petitioner which this court has is of the
investments being made by the petitioner and amount
retained by way of cash in hand.
17.

Under the circumstances a presumptive finding that

the net annual income of the petitioner is around Rs.4 lacs per
annum would not be an incorrect finding.
18.

How much should the husband share with his wife?

19.

If the husband has not to pay any money to the wife

for the welfare of the major son who I note is still a student, it
would certainly be open to be urged from the side of the wife
that since she is discharging her moral obligation to educate
her son she would be entitled to a reduction of said amount
CM(M) No.349/2007

Page 10 of 11

from her income.

In other words, viz-a-viz her net income,

same would have to be reckoned taking note of the needs of
the son who is a major but is otherwise not earning a penny.
20.

In discharge of her moral obligations towards her

son a monthly expense of Rs.7,500/- could reasonably be
expected to be spent by the mother.

Thus, the respondent

would be left with Rs.12,500/- per month for self and her
daughter.
21.

At an annual net income of Rs.4 lacs the monthly

income of the husband would be approximately Rs.30,000/- per
month. He must therefore share at least 1/3rd thereof with his
wife.

So sharing, husband would be left with a little over

Rs.20,000/- per month for his personal expenses.
22.

On the evidence on record, contours whereof have

been briefly noted by me hereinabove, I find no infirmity in the
impugned order.
23.

The petition is dismissed.

24.

No costs.
