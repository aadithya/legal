3.

Since fairness of compensation assessed is the only matter

which was debated by the learned counsel for the appellant, I need to
note only such facts as are relevant for determination of said issue.
4.

The date of accident is 31.12.1989. Age of the appellant as

on the date of accident was 25-26 years. Injured claimed to be earning
his livelihood by working as a driver with M/s. Container Way Agencies
Pvt. Ltd.
5.

As a result of the injuries suffered by the appellant his right

leg had to be amputated from above the knee.

Disability certificate

(page 117 of LCR) reveals that he suffered permanent disability of
80%.
6.

Period of treatment spreads over different dates.

Ex.P-6

reveals that first period of hospitalization was at Hindu Rao Hospital for
a period of 5 days, i.e. from date of accident, 31.12.1989 to 5.1.1990.
Medical bill (page 110 of LCR) reveals that injured remained admitted
in Ganga Ram Hospital from 05.01.1990 to 18.1.1990. Ex.P-2 reveals
further hospitalization of injured at Delhi Cantt. Hospital from
18.1.1990 to 7.2.1990.
7.

It is settled law that when a person causes harm of any

kind to another person, whether it is personal injury or damage to
property or functional loss, the normal remedy which the law gives is a
right to recover damages. In calculating damages one is required to
consider what is the pecuniary consideration which will make good to

the sufferer, as far as money can do so, the loss which he has suffered
as the natural result of the wrong done to him.
8.

Concern of the Courts is to see that the victims of the road

accident or the dependents of the deceased victims, should be placed,
as far as possible, in the same pecuniary position as they would have
been, had there been no accident.
exemplary or punitive.

Compensation assessed is not

It is compensatory.

If as a result of the

accident, human anatomy is shattered or a limb is damaged, as far as
possible, loss occasioned in terms of money to the victim of the
unfortunate road mishap has to be recompensed. Damages have to be
full and adequate.
9.

Learned counsel for the injured has assailed the award

under the head 'pecuniary damages' only on quantum of compensation
awarded towards loss of future earnings.
10.

As noted hereinabove, Tribunal has awarded Rs.2,30,400/-

towards loss of future earnings.
11.

Learned counsel has challenged the same on 3 counts.

One, that the Tribunal has erred in determining the monthly income of
the injured at the time of the accident; two, Tribunal has erred in
ignoring prospects of future increase in the income of the injured;
three, that the Tribunal erred in assessing functional disability suffered
by the injured as 80%.
12.

On the issue of income after reverting to the claim petition

and evidence on record, I note that it was stated that injured was
working as a driver at the time when accident in question took place. It
was further stated that he was drawing a salary of Rs.2500/- per
month. To establish the earnings of the injured, a document, i.e. Ex.P-4
purported to be a salary certificate issued by the employer of the
injured was placed on record.
13.

Tribunal believed that injured was working as a driver.

However, noting that employer of the injured did not step into the
witness box to prove Ex.P-4, i.e. alleged salary certificate, the Tribunal
disbelieved that injured was earning Rs.2500/- per month at the time of
the accident.
14.

Tribunal has assessed the monthly income of the injured in

the light of minimum wages notified under the Minimum Wages Act and
determined the same at Rs.1500/- per month. Assessing functional
disability suffered by the injured as 80% and applying multiplier of 16,
total compensation for loss of future earnings has been determined by
the Tribunal at Rs.1500 x 12 x 16 x 80% = Rs.2,30,400/-.
15.

Learned counsel for the appellant contended that Tribunal

erred in not placing reliance on Ex.P-4.

He further contended that

burden of proof envisaged under the M. V. Act is liberal. The principles
relating to standard of proof as enunciated under Code of Civil
Procedure do not apply to M.V. Act.
16.

I agree with the learned counsel that strict standard of

proof is not envisaged under M.V. Act, but some minimum standards of
proof have to be adhered to. Self serving statement uncorroborated by
other evidence have to be treated with a pinch of salt. In the absence
of any proof to show that Ex.P-4, i.e. the alleged salary certificate was
issued by the employer of the injured, Tribunal has rightly not placed
reliance on the same.
17.

However, I agree with the counsel that while determining

loss of future earnings, Tribunal erred in not giving the benefit of
futuristic income of the injured.
18.

It is now well settled that while estimating future loss of

income, the court has to take into account future prospects of the
injured. (See K.Narsimha Murthi Vs. The Manager, Oriental Insurance
Co. Ltd. & Anr. 2004 ACJ 1109).
19.

A perusal of the minimum wages show that to neutralize

increase in cost of living and price index, minimum wages virtually
double after every 10 years.

Take for instance, minimum wages for

skilled labour as on 1.5.1989 was Rs.1000/- per month. The same rose
to Rs.2772/- in the year 1999 and further rose to Rs.3589/- in the year
2005. Meaning thereby, there has been an increase of nearly 177% in
the minimum wages between the years 1989 to 1999 and 81% in the
next 6 years, i.e. from 1999 to 2005.
20.

Injured was aged 25-26 years when accident occurred. It

could be reasonably be expected that he would have worked till the

age of 60 years. Thus benefit of future increase in wages has to be
granted.
21.

On the issue of functional disability, it is not entirely right to

always make the future loss of income co-extensive with the extent of
permanent disability.

No mathematical formula can be applied

regardless of the avocation or profession or business of the injured.
The problem has to be approached from the point of view : what is the
resultant effect on the actual earnings or the earning capacity.
22.

In an accident, if a man is disabled for a work which he was

doing before the accident, that he has no talents, skill, experience or
training for anything else, such a man for all practical purposes has lost
all his earning capacity he possessed before the accident and he is
required to be compensated on the basis of total loss.
23.

At this juncture, I note decision of the Karnataka High Court

reported as R.Venkatesh Vs.P.Saravanan & Ors. 2002 ACJ 1743.

In

said case, Karnataka High Court while dealing with a personal injury
case where due to personal injury sustained by the claimants therein,
his left lower limb was amputated, held that in terms of functional
disability, the disability sustained by the claimant is total and 100%. In
para 9 of the judgment, it was observed as under :“As a result of the amputation, the claimant has been
rendered cripple. He requires help of the crutches even for
walking. He has become unfit for doing any kind of manual
work. As he was earlier a loader doing a manual work, the
amputation of his left leg below knee, has rendered him
unfit for any kind of manual work. He has no education. In

24.

such cases, it is well settled that the economic and
functional disability will have to be treated as total even
though the permanent disability is not total.”
Learned counsel contended that compensation awarded

under the head 'non-pecuniary damages' is grossly inadequate.
25.

As already noted hereinabove, Tribunal has awarded only

Rs.15,000/- for pain and suffering under the head 'non-pecuniary
damages'.
26.

Non-pecuniary loss may include the following :

(i)

Pain and suffering.

(ii)

Damages for mental and physical shock.

(iii)

Loss of amenities of life which may include a variety
of matters i.e. on account of injury the injured may not be
able to walk, run or sit etc.

(iv)

Loss of expectation of life i.e. on account of injury
normal longevity of the life of the person concerned is
shortened.

(v)

Disfigurement.

(vi)

Discomfort

or

inconvenience,

hardship,

disappointment, frustration and mental stress in life.
27.

Where a leg gets immobilized, a person suffers various

kinds of loss of pleasures of life. Free movement would be one. Said
injury has also diminished his marriage prospects.
28.

There cannot be an absolute measure to compensate a

non-pecuniary loss. But, some guidance can be had from the extent of

injury and period of hospitalization coupled with the disability suffered.
29.

I note various judicial trends which are as under :-

(i)

Amar Singh Vs. Ishwar, 1999 ACJ 809, Supreme Court
awarded compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- under the head
'pain, shock and suffering' to an injured who suffered 30%
permanent disability and remained in hospital fro a period
of more than 3 years though intermittently on account of
injuries sustained by him in a road accident.

(ii)

Dr.(Ms.) K.R.Tandon Vs. Om Prakash & Anr. 199 ACJ 1299,
Supreme Court awarded a compensation of Rs.1,00,000/under the head 'non-pecuniary loss' to an injured who
sustained injuries of ribs, spine and hip-joint in a road
accident.

(iii)

New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. K.Kartheeswaran & Ors.
2003 ACJ 1444. Injured was aged 17 years.

He suffered

amputation of right leg above knee. Compensation in sum
of Rs.1 lac for pain and suffering awarded by the Tribunal
was sustained by the Karnataka High Court.
(iv)

B.N.Kumar vs. D.T.C., 118 (2005) DLT 36.
In said case, injured sustained crush injuries on his
right leg leading to its amputation above knee in a road
accident on 5th November 1987. He suffered a permanent
disability of 85%.

Noting various judgments

wherein

Courts had awarded Rs.3,00,000/- under the head nonpecuniary damages, a Single Judge of this Court awarded
Rs.75,000/- for 'pain and suffering' and Rs.2,00,000/- for
'continuing disability suffered by him'.

Thus, a total of

Rs.2,75,000/- was awarded under this head.
(v)

Fakkirappa Vs. Yallawwa & Anr. 2004 ACJ 141
In said case, a minor male child sustained grievous injury in
a road accident which occurred on 8.5.2000 resulting in
amputation of his left leg below knee.

Considering the

gravity of injury suffered by the injured, Division Bench of
Karnataka High Court awarded Rs.50,000/- for pain and
suffering, Rs.1,00,000/- for loss of amenities of life,
Rs.50,000/- for loss of marriage prospects, Rs.50,000/- for
loss of expectation of life and Rs.1,50,000/- for damages for
amputation of leg. Thus, total compensation of Rs.4 lacs
was awarded to the injured under the head 'non-pecuniary
damages'.
(vi)

K.Shankar Vs. Pallavan Transport Corporation, 2001 ACJ
488
In said case, injured sustained serious injuries on his right
leg in an accident on 14.2.1989. His right leg was
amputated and he suffered permanent disability of 80%.A
learned Single Judge of Madras High Court awarded

Rs.80,000/- for permanent disability, Rs.50,000/- for pain
and suffering, Rs.50,000/- for loss of expectation of life and
proper marital alliance and Rs.1,00,000/- for mental agony.
Thus, a total compensation of Rs.2,80,000/- was awarded
to the injured.
(vii)

Bhagwan Singh Meena Vs. Jain Kishan Tewari 1999 ACJ
1200
In said case the injured sustained severe and serious
injuries on account of road accident.

His right leg was

amputated. A learned Single Judge of Rajasthan High Court
awarded compensation of Rs.3,00,000/- under the head
'non-pecuniary damages'.
30.

In the instant case, I have before me the evidence of

appellant being admitted for operation once.
hospitalization

spreading

over

5

days,

13

There are 3 spells of
days

and

14

days

respectively.
31.

I have also before me the evidence that leg of the injured

was amputated.

The evidence also shows a permanent disability of

80%, meaning thereby, that his mobility would be affected.
32.

From the judicial trends and the afore-noted facts, it is

evident that in the instant case,

there is inadequacy in the

compensation awarded towards pain and suffering as also amenities of
life and loss of marriage prospects. I note that latter 2 have been

totally ignored by the Tribunal.
33.

The idea under the M.V.Act, 1988 is to provide just, fair and

reasonable compensation. Noting that injured/appellant has not been
adequately recompensed under the heads 'non-pecuniary damages'
and 'loss of future income', I consider it reasonable to award
compensation in sum of Rs.4,50,000/- to him under all heads i.e. loss of
future increased earnings, pain and suffering, damages for mental and
physical shock, loss of amenities of life which may include a variety of
matters i.e. on account of injury the injured may not be able to walk,
run or sit etc., loss of expectation of life i.e. on account of injury normal
longevity

of

the

life

of

the

person

concerned

is

shortened,

disfigurement, discomfort or inconvenience, hardship, disappointment,
frustration and mental stress in life and loss of future income.
34.

As already noted, Tribunal has awarded compensation in

sum of Rs.2,69,400/-.

Thus, compensation is enhanced by a further

sum of Rs.1,80,600/-.
35.

I direct that enhanced compensation shall be paid together

with interest @ 6% p.a. from date of claim petition till date of
realisation.
36.

Enhanced compensation together with accrued interest

thereon shall be kept in a fixed deposit with a nationalized bank for a
period of 5 years.
37.

Appeal is accordingly disposed of in terms of paras 34, 35

and 36 above.
38.

No costs.

39.

LCR be returned.
