V.B.Gupta, J.
This appeal under section 173 of the Motor Vehicles
Act,1988 (for short as the “Act”) has been filed by National
Insurance Company Ltd. against the award dated 11.02.08,
passed by Ms. Deepa Sharma, Judge, Motor Accident
Claims Tribunal (for short as “Tribunal”), Patiala House,
Delhi.
2.

Facts in brief necessary for disposal of the present

appeal are that on 06.12.04, the deceased, Sh. Kamal Jeet
Singh along with his friend, Sh. Anchul was coming as
pillion rider from Banhukami to Nakopdar on a two
wheeler scooter bearing no. PB-08K-9406 and when they
reached Aalu Godown, Malsian Road, Nakodar, Distt.
Jalandhar, Punjab, a Truck bearing Regn. No. RJ-37-G-1075

MAC App.No.278/2008

Page 2 of 9

came from the side of Nakodar at a fast speed and hit the
scooter from the wrong side. Due to the said accident
Kamal Jeet died. Respondent No.6 who is owner of the
Truck was driving the same.
3.

A petition seeking compensation was filed by the

widow, minor children and parents of the deceased against
the driver/owner, Respondent no. 6 herein and the insurer,
Appellant herein, of the offending vehicle.
4.

The Tribunal based on the materials placed and the

evidence on record found that death was caused due to
rash and negligent driving of the driver and therefore, vide
impugned

judgment,

awarded

compensation

of

Rs.19,40,000/- by adopting multiplier of 16 along with
interest @ 7% per annum from the date of filing of the
petition till its realization in favour of Respondents 1 to 5
and against the appellant and Respondents no. 6.
5.

It has been contended by learned Counsel for the

Appellant that the Tribunal has not considered that at the
time of the demise of the deceased, his wife was a housewife and on his demise, his employer has given job to her
on the compassionate ground and after getting the

MAC App.No.278/2008

Page 3 of 9

employment, she is getting a salary of Rs. 4,400/-plus
allowances. Therefore, this amount has to be deducted
from amount of compensation granted to the claimants
under the head of “loss of income”. The dependant
claimants have got triple benefits, firstly the compensation
which they are legally entitled for, due to untimely
accidental

death

of

the

deceased,

secondly

the

compensation for future loss of income and thirdly, the
income from compassionate employment.

pecuniary

advantage

would

have

Thus, such

correlation

to

the

accidental death for which compensation is computed. It
has been laid down that.:“The Compensation payable under the Motor
Vehicles Act is on account of the pecuniary loss
to the claimant by accidental injury or death and
not other forms of death. If there is natural

MAC App.No.278/2008

Page 4 of 9

death or death by suicide, serious illness,
including even death by accident, through train,
air flight not involving a motor vehicle, it would
not be covered under the Motor Vehicles Act.
Thus, the application of the general principle
under the common law of loss and gain for the
computation of compensation under this Act
must correlate to this type of injury or death,
viz., accidental.
If the words “pecuniary
advantage” from whatever source are to be
interpreted to mean any form of death under
this Act, it would dilute all possible benefits
conferred on the claimant and would be
contrary to the spirit of the law.
If the
“pecuniary advantage” resulting from death
means pecuniary advantage coming under all
forms of death then it will include all the assets
moveable, immovable, shares, bank accounts,
cash and every amount receivable under any
contract. In other words, all heritable assets
including what is willed by the deceased etc.
This would obliterate both, all possible
conferment of economic security to the claimant
by the deceased and the intentions of the
legislature.
By such an interpretation, the
tortfeasor in spite of his wrongful act or
negligence, which contributes to the death,
would have in many cases no liability or meager
liability. In our considered opinion, the general
principle of loss and gain takes colour of this
statute, viz., the gain has to be interpreted
which is as a result of the accidental death and
the loss on account of the accidental death.
Thus, under the present Act, whatever
pecuniary advantage is received by the
claimant, from whatever source, would only
mean which comes to the claimant on account
of the accidental death and not other forms of
death. The constitution of the Motor Accident
Claims Tribunal itself under Section 110 is, as
the section states:

MAC App.No.278/2008

Page 5 of 9

“…. for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims
for compensation in respect of accidents
involving the death of, or bodily injury to, ….”
33. Thus, it would not include that which he
would have received even apart from accidental
death. Thus, such pecuniary advantage would
have no correlation to the accidental death for
which compensation is computed. Any amount
received or receivable not only on account of the
accidental death but that which would have
come to the claimant even otherwise, would not
be construed to be the “pecuniary advantage”,
liable for deduction.”
7.

Thus,

the

principal

question

that

arises

for

determination in this appeal is as to “if the wife had got
employment on the compassionate ground then that has to
be

taken

or

not

into

account

while

fixing

the

compensation?”
8.

In Helen C. Rebello (Mrs.) and others (supra), the

Apex Court has observed;
“As we have observed, the whole scheme of
the Act, in relation to the payment of
compensation to the claimant, is a beneficial
legislation, the intention of the legislature is
made more clear by the change of language
from what was in Fatal Accidents Act, 1855
and what is brought Under Section 110-B of
1939 Act. This is also visible through the
provision of Section 168(1) under the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 and Section 92-A of 1939
Act which fixes the liability on the owner of
the vehicle even on no fault. It provides that
where the death or permanent disablement of
any person has resulted from an accident in
MAC App.No.278/2008

Page 6 of 9

spite of no fault of the owner of the vehicle, an
amount of compensation fixed therein is
payable to claimant by such owner of the
vehicle. Section 92-B ensures that the claim
for compensation Under Section 92-A is in
addition to any other right to claim
compensation in respect whereof (sic thereof)
under any other provision of this Act or of any
other law for the time being in force. This
clearly indicates the intention of the
legislature which is conferring larger benefit
on the claimant. Interpretation of such
beneficial legislation is also well settled.
Whenever
there
be
two
possible
interpretations in such statute, then the one
which subserves the object of legislation, viz.,
benefit to the subject should be accepted. In
the present case, two interpretations have
given of this statute, evidenced by two distinct
sets of decisions of the various high courts.
We have no hesitation to conclude that the set
of decisions, which applied the principle of no
deduction of the life insurance amount, should
be accepted and the other set, which
interpreted to deduct, is to be rejected. For all
these considerations, we have no hesitation to
hold that such High Courts were wrong in
deducting the amount paid or payable under
the life insurance by giving restricted meaning
to the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act
basing mostly on the language of English
statutes and not taking into consideration the
changed language and intends of the
legislature under various provisions of the
Motor Vehicles Act, 1939.”
9.

From the above decision it is clear that just because

the wife had got employment on the compassionate
ground,

compensation

MAC App.No.278/2008

is

not

liable

to

be

reduced.

Page 7 of 9

Compassionate employment is given by the employer and
the quantum of compensation has nothing to do with the
same and it is altogether on a different ground the said
thing is given. It has also to be remembered that even if
husband dies a natural death, the wife would be entitled to
employment under the compassionate scheme, if the
scheme so provides or at the wish of employer.
10. In United India Insurance Co.ltd. vs. Bindu &

Ors., (2007) I ACC 688 it was held by the Kerala High
Court that:“Merely because wife had got employment
under the compassionate scheme, compensation
is not liable to be reduced.”
11.

A Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in

APSRTC v. G. Jana Bai, II (2001) ACC 716, held;
“The mere fact of the wife of deceased
gainfully
employed
on
compassionate
grounds cannot be a ground for awarding
less compensation though the claimants are
entitled for more compensation.”
12.

Similarly, a Division Bench of Gauhati High Court in

Kanika Hazarika and Ors. v. Sreeram Barthkumar and
Ors., 2002 ACJ 159, held that;
“Deduction on account of the salary received
by the widow on an employment given by the

MAC App.No.278/2008

Page 8 of 9

bank where the deceased was working
should not be taken into consideration for
fixing the amount.”
13.

Thus under these circumstances and in view of

various decisions of other High Court, where a wife gets
employment

under

compassionate

scheme,

the

compensation payable is not liable to be reduced, so, no
error can be found with the view taken by the Tribunal.
14.

The present appeal is, thus, devoid of any merits and

same is, hereby, dismissed.
15.

No order as to costs.
