S.L. BHAYANA, J.
The Petitioner was commissioned in the Indian
Air Force on 16.01.1954. After 22 years of service, the
Government sanctioned the Petitioner’s deputation to AirIndia, a Public Sector Undertaking for a period of one-year
with effect from 16.02.1977. On the completion of the

WP(C)4759-2003

page 1 of 17

period of deputation, the Government issued its approval
for the permanent absorption of the Petitioner with effect
from 16.02.1976. The Petitioner’s premature retirement on
permanent absorption was communicated to him vide
Order dated 08.02.1977, and thereafter the Petitioner was
also transferred to the Regular Air Force Reserve vide
Order dated 18.05.1977.
2.
pension

The Petitioner, on retirement, was granted a
of

Rs.

745/-

per

month

with

effect

from

16.02.1977. The Petitioner’s pension was determined as
per PCDA (P) Payment Authority No GI/M/XI/1042/03
dated 25.06.1977. Under this Scheme the pension was
determined on pro-rata basis, for 23 years against 24 years
of qualifying service required for full retiring pension of
Rs.775/- per month, which would also be inclusive of the
weightage element.
3.

Vide Payment Authority Letter No.GI/39282/AF

dated 02.09.1977, the pension of the Petitioner was
amended to Rs.570 /-with effect from 16.02.77. The

WP(C)4759-2003

page 2 of 17

Petitioner’s pension was calculated on pro-rata basis.
However, the pension was now subject to the deduction of
the weightage element included in the standard rate of
pension.

The

Petitioner’s

pension

was

subsequently

restored to Rs.745/- as per Ministry of Defence letter No.
32(I)/77/D (Pen/Sers).
4.

As

per

the

Fourth

Pay

Commission

Recommendations, the pension was to be calculated not on
the basis of the monetary element of compensation but on
the rank based weightage of additional years in qualifying
service as per Government letter dated 30.10.1987.
Further, the weightage element was not admissible in
respect of those who retired pre-maturely to join a Public
Sector Undertaking. However, as the Petitioner had retired
before 1986, the weightage element was included in his
pension as per PPO No.M/2166/81.
5.

In accordance with Ministry of Defence letter

dated 30.10.1987, issued as per the Recommendations of
the Fourth Pay Commission, initially the reduction of

WP(C)4759-2003

page 3 of 17

weightage from the pension was not applicable to pre-86
retirees absorbed in Public Sector Undertakings. This
reduction of weightage was, however, made applicable to
them vide letter dated 27.05.1998. Thus, the letter dated
30.10.1987 was also made applicable to pre-1986 retirees,
which specifically mentioned that there would be no
weightage for officers and personnel retiring pre-maturely
for permanent absorption in a public sector undertaking.
6.

Before the issuance of the Government letter

dated 27.05.1998, the Recommendations of the Fifth Pay
Commission were implemented in respect of all pre-96
retirees with effect from 01.01.96. In the Petitioner’s case,
the pension was further consolidated and revised at
Rs.5141/ per month-. Consequently, Order dated 27.05.98
mandated that pension of all pre-86 retirees may be
updated by notional fixation of pay by adopting the same
formula as was adopted for serving Officers. Thereafter for
the purpose of consolidation of pension as on 01.01.96,
pre-86 retirees were to be treated like those who had
retired on or after 01.01.86.
WP(C)4759-2003

page 4 of 17

7.

Thus, the Petitioner has prayed for the quashing

of the extant pension as being unreasonable and defective
on account of non-adherence to the Government directions.
The Petitioner has further prayed for the determination of
his pro-rata pension strictly in accordance with the
relevant Government decisions and revision of his pension
to Rs.7235/-per month. The Petitioner has also prayed for a
Writ of Certiorari directing the Respondents to allow the
weightage benefit to the Petitioner.
8.

It has been contended by the Petitioner that

his current pension is 1/3rd of his rightful entitlement. He
further contended that his pension should be fixed

in

accordance with the Ministry of Defence letter dated
07.06.1999. The Petitioner has argued that his rightful
entitlement can be determined only when it is decided
whether pro-rata reduction is applicable as per extant
rules on the date of his retirement or as per the prevailing
rules.

WP(C)4759-2003

page 5 of 17

9.

Per contra, it has been argued by learned

counsel for the Respondents that the first para of the
Government letter dated 07.06.99 itself clearly illustrates
that the existing provisions in the Rules governing
qualifying service and minimum pension, shall continue to
be operative. The minimum pension quoted in para 2.1(a)
is Rs.1275/- per month, which came into effect after the
Vth Pay Commission from 01.01.1996 and, therefore, the
Rules governing qualifying service should be applicable as
on 01.01.1996. It was further argued that the calculation
was based on 33 years of qualifying service, which came
into

existence

with

effect

from

01.01.1986

and

is

applicable till date and that the Petitioner has misguided
the Government by misquoting letter-dated 17.12.98,
which

modifies

para

5

of

Government

letter

dated

27.10.97.
10.

The Petitioner has further placed reliance on the

case of Lt. Col B.R. Malhotra v. Union of India 1997 (6)
AS

(Del)

1049

wherein

the

Petitioner

had

retired

prematurely for the immediate purpose of being absorbed
WP(C)4759-2003

page 6 of 17

in BEL, a Public Sector Undertaking. On being denied that
benefit of weightage, he had approached this Court and
the Court granted him the benefit of weightage. As such,
while granting pension, there cannot be any discrimination
between

the

persons

absorbed

in

Public

Sector

Undertakings and those who were not absorbed. Thus, the
deduction on account of weightage element is bad in law
and cannot be sustained.
11.

Another contention, which has been urged by

the Petitioner, is that an assurance was given by the
Respondents that there would be no loss of benefits in the
matter of pension if the Petitioner took pre-mature
retirement and that denying the benefit of weightage, they
had breached this assurance. Learned counsel for the
Respondents has argued that the Petitioner had not been
denied the benefit of pension. His pension has been
calculated with reference to his actual qualifying services.
The Respondents further argued that the Petitioner was
denied the benefit of weightage.

WP(C)4759-2003

page 7 of 17

12.

The Petitioner in the present Writ Petition has

also contended that the acts of the Respondents are illegal
and arbitrary, as his employment in Air India cannot be
considered

as

Undertaking.

an

absorption

in

a

Public

Sector

It is further contended that Air India had

refused to treat the Petitioner’s induction as absorption,
and that the same was conveyed to the Respondents vide
his letter dated 03.11.1977. Learned counsel for the
Respondents in response to the above contention has
submitted that the Petitioner has distorted the contents of
the letter at Annexure-8 dated 03.11.1997, and that the
Respondents has not altered the status of the Petitioner.
13.

The Petitioner has submitted before this Court

that retirement after the completion of 20 years but before
completing the service required for full-pension is called
“Pre-mature retirement” and pro-rata pension for all such
pre-mature retirees should be the same. The Petitioner
further argued that though he was absorbed in a Public
Sector Undertaking, he was drawing pro-rata pension at
par with the other pre-mature retirees and thus, the
WP(C)4759-2003

page 8 of 17

CCDA(P) by disallowing the weightage at this point of time,
has disrupted the existing parity. The Respondents have
argued that the term pro-rata pension is used to denote the
pension admissible to those who have pre-maturely retired
from the armed forces for permanent absorption in a
Public Sector Undertaking or autonomous body.

Those

retiring pre-maturely for personal reasons are granted
retiring pension whereas those invalided out of service are
entitled

to

invalid

pension.

Learned

counsel

of

the

Respondents has also argued that Ministry of Defence
letter dated 10.04.78 has divided the retirees into two
categories and this discrimination was rectified by the
Fourth

Pay Commission vide Government letter dated

30.10.87.
14.

Before parting with this case, we may refer to

the judgment of the Supreme Court in D.S. Nakara v.

Union of India (1983) 1 SCC 305, where the Court has
held as under :
“(i) that pension is neither a bounty nor a matter
of grace depending upon the sweet will of the
WP(C)4759-2003

page 9 of 17

employer and that it creates a vested right
subject to 1972 Rules which are statutory in
character because they are enacted in exercise
of powers conferred by the proviso to Article
309 and Clause (5) of Article 148 of the
Constitution;
(ii) that the pension is not an ex-gratia payment
but it is a payment for the past service
rendered;
(ii) it is a social welfare measure rendering
socio-economic justice to those who in the heyday of their life ceaselessly toiled for the
employer on an assurance that in their old age
they would not be left in lurch. And that
pensioners form a class as a whole and cannot
be micro classified by an arbitrary, unprincipled
and unreasonable eligibility criterion for the
purpose of grant of revised pension. And further
held that whenever classification is held to be
impermissible and the measure can be retained
by removing the unconstitutional portion of the
classification, by striking down words of
limitation, the resultant effect may be enlarging
the class. In such a situation, the court can
strike down the words of limitation in an
enactment. And that is what is called "reading
down" the measure.”
15.

The

Petitioner

has

contended

that

the

Respondents at the time of his pre-mature retirement were
assured that there would be no loss of benefits in the
matter of pension if the Petitioner took pre-mature
retirement and thus denying the benefit of weightage had

WP(C)4759-2003

page 10 of 17

breached this assurance.

This statement is factually

incorrect. The Respondents framed a scheme, which
enabled certain categories of Officers to take pre-mature
retirement,

so

as

to

join

Air

India.

The

Petitioner

voluntarily took pre-mature retirement from the Armed
Forces for the purpose of joining Air India and the
Government sanctioned the pre-mature retirement at that
time. This was neither a case of compulsory retirement in
public interest nor a case of directing employees to retire
prematurely in public interest. The benefit of weightage is
denied only to those who retire prematurely for the
immediate

purpose

of

joining

Public

Sector

Undertakings/autonomous bodies. The Supreme Court in
the case of Union of India v A.S. Gangoli (2007) 6 SCC
196, spelt the reason for the denial of the weightage
element to those retired prematurely for immediate
absorption in Public Sector Undertakings and has held as
under:“First, they will have the benefit of joining
immediately and continuing in service in a
public sector undertaking or autonomous body,
WP(C)4759-2003

page 11 of 17

without losing their pensionary benefits. The
other
retirees
including
those
retiring
prematurely on personal grounds did not have
the benefit or such immediate assured
alternative
employment,
with
pensionary
benefits for the defence service intact.
Secondly, they got the benefit of 100%
commutation and a lesser minimum period of
qualifying service which the other retirees did
not get.”
16.

It is thus seen that it is not the pensionary

benefits which have been denied to the Petitioner, but it is
the benefit of weightage. Consequently, the denial of the
weightage element to the Petitioner has in no manner
deprived the Petitioner of his rightful entitlement.
17.

The facts of Lt. Col.B.R. Malhotra’s case

(supra) are entirely different from the case in hand, thus,
the same is of no benefit to the Petitioner as the Petitioner
therein had suffered a gunshot wound in both his knees
while in army service and was later sent on deputation
with BEL. Subsequently, he was absorbed in BEL, a public
sector undertaking in public interest. He was accordingly
held entitled to disability pension even after having been
absorbed

in

WP(C)4759-2003

a

Public

Sector

Undertaking,

as

his

page 12 of 17

injuries/disability were attributable to service. That apart,
a certain weightage element was sought to be deducted
from the standard rate of pension on the ground that he
had

been

permanently

absorbed

in

a

public

sector

undertaking. However, this Court found that there was in
fact no weightage element in his case, and there was no
rule or regulation applicable to him, which would permit
the deduction of any weightage element. Hence, the said
decision has no relevance to the present case.
18.

The

contention

of

the

Petitioner

that

his

induction in Air India cannot be treated as absorption in
public undertaking, is also without any substance. The
Rules applicable to those being absorbed in Public Sector
Undertakings/ autonomous bodies are applicable to those
who had joined Air India and the Petitioner is not an
exception to this general rule.
19.

It has also been contended by the Petitioner that

his rightful entitlement can be determined only when it is
decided that whether pro-rata reduction be under the

WP(C)4759-2003

page 13 of 17

Rules applicable on the date of retirement or as per the
prevailing Rules. The Rules applicable for the calculation
of the pro-rata pension of the Petitioner are clarified vide
Para 5 of the Government letter dated 27.05.98 (Annexure
–7) which are as follows:
“In
accordance
with
the
Government
instructions issued from time to time, retiring
pension of all pre-1986 Commissioned Officers
was based on the standard rate of retiring
pension and standard service period for the
rank held by the officer on his retirement
provided it was held on active list for a
minimum period of 10 months (except in case of
Generals). Whereas, with effect from1.1.86 the
pension of Armed Forces Commissioned Officers
is based on the average reckonable emoluments
drawn by them during the last ten months
immediately preceding the date of retirement.

Government has, inter alia accepted the
recommendation of the Fifth Central Pay
Commission to the effect that Pension of all the
pre-1986 retirees may be updated by notional
fixation of their pay as on 1.1.1986 by adopting
the same formula as for the serving Armed
Forces Officer and thereafter for the purpose of
consolidation of their pension/family pension as
on 01.01.1986, they may be treated alike those
who have retired on or after 01.01.86.

retired before 01 Jan, 1986

Accordingly, pay of all those Armed Forces
Officers who retired prior to 01.01.1986 and
were in receipt of any type of pension
mentioned in para 1.1 above as on 01.01.1986
will be fixed on notional basis in the revised
scale of pay for the rank held by the Pensioner

to retirement of Armed Forces Officer
consequent upon promulgation of Revised Pay
Rules on implementation of recommendations of

For calculation of pension with reference to
notional pay as on 01 Jan 1986 weightage as
admissible vide par 5(b) of Ministry of Defenses
letter No. 1/(5)/87/DPension/ Services) dt. 30
October, 1987 shall be added to actual
qualifying service (including qualifying service,
if any, already admitted and notified in the
Army/Naval/Air Force list).

20.

The provisions applicable to pre-86 retirees are

contained in Government letter dated 27.05.98 which state
that the pay of all Armed Force personnel shall be fixed on
notional basis. The letter dated 27.05.98 further provides
that for the purpose of calculation of pension with
WP(C)4759-2003

page 15 of 17

reference to notional pay as on 01.01.86, the weightage
will be applicable as per the Ministry of Defence letter
dated 30.10.87, which has clearly provided that no
weightage shall be given to Officers who retire voluntarily
for permanent absorption in a Public Sector Undertaking.
The relevant portion of the letter dated 30.10.97/Annexure6 is reproduced below:
“Weightage for the purpose of calculation of
pension of Commissioned Officers will be given
below:XXX

XXX

XXX

Notes: (1) There will be no weight age for
officers and personnel below officer rank who
retire prematurely for permanent absorption in
public sector undertakings and autonomous
bodies.”
21.

In our view, as per rules applicable to the

Petitioner, the denial of weightage to the Petitioner has not
deprived him in any manner of his rightful entitlement. The
dictum of the Supreme Court in Union of India v A.S.

Gangoli (supra) is rightly applicable to the present case
where the Court has held as under:

WP(C)4759-2003

page 16 of 17

“It is thus seen that the officers who took
premature retirement for the purpose of
immediate employment in PSUs/autonomous
bodies received several specific benefits,
including assured immediate re-employment and
extended service. The persons who retire in the
usual course and those who prematurely retire
for personal reasons, were not entitled to those
special benefits. Therefore, the persons who
retired prematurely for immediate purpose of
joining PSUs., clearly formed a distinct and
separate class. In view of the special benefits
extended to them, if note (1) to Regulation 5
excluded them from the benefit of weightage
which was given to the other retirees, it is not
discrimination. The High Court completely
overlooked these aspects and its decision cannot
therefore be sustained”
22.

In view of the above and applying the ratio of

the Supreme Court’s decision in Union of India v A.S.

Gangoli

(supra), the Writ Petition is liable to be

dismissed.
