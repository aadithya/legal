Section 13(1) (E) of Prevention of Corruption
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Act,

1988 from the Court of a particular Special Judge.
2.

Stating his

advanced age and poor state of

health, the petitioner, an accused facing trial, made
an application for early disposal of case against him.
Such application was however, declined
learned Special Judge

by the

by an order dated

September, 2006 noticing that

many

19th

older cases

were pending before him and in the circumstances,
no priority could be accorded to the petitioner's case.
Aggrieved by such an order of the learned Special
Judge, the petitioner approached this Court by way of
a Crl. Misc. Case No.6984/2006 which was disposed
of vide orders dated 1st November, 2006 and 13th
November, 2006 with the following direction :
“The trial court shall make an endeavour for
conducting the case as early as possible and
for that purpose two hours each for one week
in a month may be devoted by the trial court,
subject to its convenience.”
3.

According to the petitioner, inspite of direction

T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 2 of 24

to the said effect the learned Special Judge failed to
expedite the trial. He, therefore, made an application
before the learned Sessions Judge, Delhi for transfer
of his case to some other court of a Special Judge.
His transfer application was however, eventually
dismissed by the learned

Sessions Judge, Delhi by

an order dated 6th March, 2007. It is alleged that the
dismissal of his transfer application by the learned
Sessions Judge, Delhi made the learned Special
Judge more prejudiced

which became evident in the

course of subsequent hearings of the case.

The

petitioner recounts certain instances in the petition
in support of his plea that the learned Special Judge
concerned is acting with a pre-determined and biased
mind thereby causing reasonable apprehension that
he is not going to have a fair and impartial trial in his
Court.
4.

Such instances are stated thus :

T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 3 of 24

(i)

The petitioner

made an application

seeking release of certain articles, jewelery items
and cash belonging to his individual family
members, seized by the CBI. CBI filed a reply to
such application conveying it's no objection for
release of locker No.174 with Syndicate Bank,
R.K. Puram Branch, New Delhi and locker Nos.
501 and 285 with State Cooperative Bank,
Shimla.

The petitioner alleges that

petitioner alleges that

from CBI the learned Special Judge did not
dispose of his application and kept

the same

(ii)

the learned Special Judge makes mention of a
telephonic call

him where

The order reveals that

from the

of the caller the learned Special Judge

was able to distinguish that it was the voice of

that there was no necessity of making mention
of this fact in the order sheet as it was totally

to his grave prejudice.
(iii)

Referring to

the statement of PW 55, a
of

the

Corporation

Bank,

recorded by the learned Special Judge, it is
pointed out that a photocopy of a cheque was
wrongly allowed to be marked as Ex. PW 55/B.
(iv)

Similarly,

it is pointed out, PW 56 Sh.

Rishi Prakash, Additional S.P. and PW 60 Sh.
B.S. Jhakhar were allowed to make statements
with respect to

certain facts which were not

based on their direct knowledge. Allowing the
said witnesses to depose in regard to such facts,
inspite of objections being raised on his behalf,
pleads the petitioner, speak of biased attitude of
the learned Special Judge.

(vi)

Last instance finding mention in the

petition is that on the

day of recording of his

statement PW 63 Sh. H.S. Sandhu was called by
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 7 of 24

learned Special Judge in his chamber where he
is alleged to have had conferred

with him in

regard to the case for more than two hours
which has raised

reasonable apprehension in

the mind of petitioner that the learned Special
Judge is biased against him.
5.

Sh. D.C. Mathur, learned

Senior counsel

representing the petitioner, contended that

the

aforesaid instances as set out in the petition clearly
demonstrate that the learned Special Judge has been
acting with a prejudiced mind eversince this Court
passed the orders dated 1st November, 2006 and 13th
November, 2006 requiring him to expedite the trial.
In addition, he pointed out that though the case
before the learned Special Judge was not fixed for
hearing on

24th July, 2007 and 2nd August, 2007,

which incidentally

happened to be

the dates fixed

before this court for hearing on transfer petition, the
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 8 of 24

learned Special Judge proceeded to list the case
before him for hearing on the said dates simply with
a view to put the petitioner to avoidable inconvenience
as he could not be expected to be present before this
court as also before the learned Special Judge
simultaneously. This, argued learned Senior counsel
was another instance of the learned Special Judge
acting in an unfair and prejudiced manner. Drawing
sustenance from a Supreme Court decision in Satish
Jaggi Vs. State of Chhattisgarh & Ors.; (2007) ACR
271, the learned Senior counsel contended that not
only

that justice is done but it is also seen to be

done.
6.

Appearing for CBI, Sh. R.M. Tiwari, Advocate
did not advance any argument in opposition to the
petition. He rather stated that CBI has no objection if
the transfer petition is granted and

the case

transferred as prayed for.
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

is

7.

In the context of allegations of bias the
comments of learned Special Judge concerned were
called for. In his comments the learned Special Judge
denies all the allegations of bias against him.

8.

It is admitted position that the petitioner made
an application before the

learned Special Judge to

expedite his trial in view of his old age and poor state
of health and that such application was declined by
the learned Special Judge on the ground that he had
many other older cases awaiting disposal and was,
thus, not in a position to accede to the petitioner's
prayer for expeditious trial.

On a petition No. Crl.

Misc. Case No.6984/2006 being filed before this court
a direction was issued, as extracted earlier, to the
learned Trial Court to expedite

the trial.

The

subsequent proceedings held in the course of trial in
the wake of the direction by this court for expeditious
trial, fell short

of petitioner's expectation and he

T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 10 of 24

being aggrieved by the pace of trial, filed a petition
before the learned Sessions Judge, Delhi for transfer
of his case from the court of learned Special Judge
concerned on the plea that inspite of this court's
direction for expeditious trial, the learned Trial court
had failed to speed up the same.

The learned

Sessions Judge however, on hearing the transfer
petition, dismissed the same vide her order dated 6th
March, 2007, noticing that the proceedings held
subsequent to the directions dated 1st November,
2006 and 13th November, 2006 of this court showed
that such directions were being complied with by the
learned Special Judge in letter and spirit and that the
transfer of the case from one court

to another was

unlikely to serve any fruitful purpose rather the same
would simply delay the proceedings. It appears that
the petitioner was

not satisfied with the said order

dated 6th March, 2007 of learned Sessions Judge,
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 11 of 24

Delhi dismissing his transfer petition as he renewed
his plea in that regard by approaching this court by
way of present petition.
9.

Adverting to the specific instances which the
petitioner mentions in his petition to justify his prayer
for transfer of his case from learned Trial Court, it is
noticed that the petitioner had made an application
dated 20th November, 2006 before the learned Trial
Court for release of jewelery and cash as detailed in
Annexure 'A' to the application which was replied to
on behalf of CBI on 23rd January, 2007. The learned
Special Judge after going through the reply so filed by
CBI passed an order dated 23rd January, 2007
requiring

it to file another comprehensive reply in

respect of each and every averment in the application.
It appears that the reply filed by the CBI was found
deficient inasmuch as the averment in para 3 of the
application were
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

skipped over and the CBI had
Page 12 of 24

altogether

omitted to reply to the para in its reply

dated 23rd January, 2007.

Another reply was later

filed on behalf of CBI. In both their replies, the CBI
had given no objection to the release of some of the
items

as

mentioned

application however,

therein.

The

petitioner's

appears to have remained

pending for some time and it was only on 18 th May,
2007 that an order

was passed thereon

partly

allowing the prayer for release of some of the items for
which a no objection was given by the CBI. This was
followed by another order dated 11th July, 2007
whereby the application in regard to other items,
release whereof was objected to by CBI, was decided
and some of the jewelery items were directed

to be

returned to Ms. Ritu Sharma after segregating the
same from other jewelery. No doubt, in view of no
objection from CBI for release of certain items, the
learned Special Judge could have proceeded to pass
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 13 of 24

appropriate orders in that respect while keeping the
application

for

release

of

other

awaiting a comprehensive reply,

items

pending

delay in passing

such an order on petitioner's application could not
necessarily

be

attributed

to

any

prejudicial

disposition of the learned Trial Judge towards the
petitioner.

The learned

Trial Judge

eventually

passed an order, though somewhat belatedly

for

release of the items in respect of which there was no
objection from the CBI.

Further, even some of the

other jewelery items, release whereof was contested
by CBI, were also later directed to be returned to Ms.
Ritu Sharma. Delay simplicitor

in disposal

of an

application is no index of a prejudiced state of mind
on the part of a Judge dealing with the same. There
appears no

sufficient basis in the given

case to

accept the

plea that

petitioner's

application was actuated owing to

T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

belated disposal of the

Page 14 of 24

learned Special Judge concerned suffering from vice
of bias against him.
10.

The order sheet dated 7th December, 2006

discloses that a
Special Judge

call was received by the learned
on his telephone from some one

identifying himself as Pandit Sukh Ram (the present
petitioner) to make a request to expedite

his matter.

The learned Special Judge, it is gathered from his said
order, could

clearly make out

that the person

making such call was not the petitioner himself rather
someone else.
comments
mention in

The learned Special Judge in his

states that he had to

make specific

the order sheet of such a call being

received by him in order to

guard himself against

any possible allegation in future that he had talked
on a number belonging to the petitioner. Of course,
mention of such telephonic call could not be relevant
for decision of the case, as pleaded on behalf of the
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 15 of 24

petitioner, in view of what the learned Special Judge
had to say on this aspect, there appears no reason on
the part of the petitioner to be apprehensive of any
bias on the part of learned Special Judge in deciding
his case especially when the learned Trial Judge
himself has noted that it was not the petitioner who
had really made the call.
11.

In

regard

to

the

allegation

regarding

a

photocopy of a cheque being allowed to be marked as
exhibit in the course of statement of PW 55 as also
PW 56,

Sh. Rishi Prakash and PW 60, Sh. B.S.

Jhakhar being allowed to make statements with
respect to certain facts, which were not based on their
direct knowledge, the learned Trial Judge has stated
that wherever in the course of recording of statement
of witnesses any objections were raised on behalf of
the

petitioner

in regard to admissibility of a

particular piece of evidence, the same
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

had been

Page 16 of 24

noted down and left open for decision at final stage
keeping in view the law laid down by the Supreme
Court in Bipin Shanti Lall Panchal Vs. State of Gujrat
& Anr.; AIR 2001 SC 1158. It is not the grievance of
the petitioner that

his objections in regard to

admissibility of certain pieces of evidence forming part
of statements of

PW 55, PW 56 Sh. Rishi Prakash,

PW 60, Sh. B.S. Jhakhar and PW 63,
Sandhu

Sh. H.S.

were not noted by the learned Trial Judge.

Simply because such objections are kept open for
decision at final stage,

in view of decision of the

Supreme Court in the above referred case, could be
no reason to question the fairness of the learned Trial
Judge.
12.

A meeting by PW 63, Sh. H.S. Sandhu

with

the learned Trial Judge in his chamber is another
instance set forth by the petitioner to impute bias on
his part. The learned Special Judge though in his
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 17 of 24

comments admits that he had granted a meeting to
the said witness in his chamber but this had nothing
to do with the

petitioner's case.

Judge mentions that

The learned Trial

on Fridays

he normally does

not fix any court work as it is a mediation day for him
and he takes up the cases for mediation in his
chamber.

13th April, 2007, which happened to be a

Friday, was fixed to record the statement of PW 63
Sh. H.S. Sandhu simply in view of direction of this
court to expedite the trial.

He denies

that he had

any conference with PW 63 Sh. H.S. Sandhu, I.O. of
the case for two hours in his chamber after recording
his statement.

He mentions that

Sh. H.S. Snadhu

PW 63, who was working as S.P. CBI (ACU) (IV)
Branch at the time of registration of the case in the
year 1996, was, on the date of his statement before
the

court,

Page 18 of 24

Netherland.

After recording of his statement

was

over and the learned Special Judge had retired to his
chamber, on a permission being sought to see him,
he allowed PW 63 Sh. H.S. Sandhu alongwith Sh.
Gurdial Singh, Special counsel for CBI to come to his
chamber. According to him, Sh. H.S. Sandhu, PW 63
was to bring to his notice that the CBI had not paid
any expenses for the tickets which he had purchased
from his own pocket and that he wanted a certificate
from the court for non payment of expenses on that
count. In view of what is stated by learned Special
Judge, there appears no support to the allegation of
the petitioner that it was the learned Special Judge
who had called

PW 63 Sh. H.S. Sandhu to

his

chamber to discuss about the case.
13.

During the pendency of present petition, which

lastly came to be listed on 24th July, 2007 and 2nd
August, 2007, it appears that
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

the learned Special
Page 19 of 24

Judge had also fixed

these dates for hearing of the

petitioner's case before him. Learned Senior counsel
argued that the learned Special Judge had fixed the
hearing before him on the said two dates simply with
a view to cause inconvenience to the petitioner as he
could not be expected to be present at the same time
before this court as also before the learned Special
Judge. It is ironical to notice that on the one hand
the petitioner has not been satisfied with the pace of
trial, on the other when the learned Trial Judge tries
to expedite the trial by fixing additional dates, the
petitioner finds

fault

in that also.

Noticeably,

personal presence of the petitioner in the course of
hearing on his transfer petition before this court was
not essential and the

learned Senior counsel could

have very well addressed his arguments even in
petitioner's absence. Moreover, there is nothing on
record to show that the learned Special Judge
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 20 of 24

deliberately fixed the hearing on the said two dates
simply to put the petitioner to inconvenience as
pleaded.
14.

In Satish Jaggi's case (supra), taking note of

its certain previous decisions, the Supreme Court, no
doubt, observed

that in the matter of a transfer

petition 'there should not be any scope given to any
person to go away with the feeling that the Judge was
biased, however, unfounded impression may be', such
observations could not be referred to

in isolation,

keeping apart the facts of that particular case. That
was a case where the brother of the Sessions Judge
trying the case was a sitting MLA belonging to a
particular party of which

respondent No.3's father

was earlier the leader and the Chief Minister. It was
on peculiar facts of that particular case that the
Supreme Court allowing the transfer petition directed
the

High Court to transfer the case to some other

T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 21 of 24

Sessions Court.
15.

In Gurcharan Dass Chadha Vs. State of

Rajasthan; AIR 1966 SC 1418 which was one of the
cases noticed in Satish Jaggi (supra) it has been held
that

a case is transferred if there is a reasonable

apprehension on the part of a party to a case that
justice will not be done.

It was ruled that the

apprehension must not only be entertained but must
appear to the court to be a reasonable apprehension.
Clearly, thus, merely entertaining apprehension that
justice will not be done to him is not good enough for
transfer of a case from one court to another unless
such apprehension is a reasonable one and it is for
the court dealing with transfer petition to see if there
exists

a reasonable apprehension of

petitioner not

getting justice.
16.

In the present case it is noticed that even

though the petitioner may have had his own reasons
T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

Page 22 of 24

to be apprehensive of not getting justice before the
learned Trial Judge, such apprehension for the
reasons already stated

would

appear to

be not a

reasonable one. Directing transfer of a case from a
particular court on the ground of prejudice or bias on
the part of the Judge of such court, may amount to
serious reflection on judicial conduct of such a Judge
and thus fraught with demoralising

effect. The

transfer of a case, therefore, on such a ground must
be visited

with utmost circumspection

though

certainly not at the cost of denial of a fair trial to the
person concerned.

The case

on hand

presents a

scenario where the petitioner's apprehension of not
getting a fair trial before

the learned Special Judge

concerned, is found to be not a reasonable one.
17.

Consequently, the petition must fail and the

same is accordingly dismissed.
18.

Interim order

T.P. (Crl.) No.2/2007

proceedings

transfer petition, stands vacated.
19.

A copy of this order

be sent to the learned

Special Judge concerned, immediately to enable him
to proceed with the trial in accordance with law. The
petitioner is directed to appear before the Court
concerned on 15th October, 2007.
