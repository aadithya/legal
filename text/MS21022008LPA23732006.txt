1.

These appeals involve similar issues and, therefore, we

propose to dispose of these appeals by this common judgment and
order. In similar appeal being LPA No.156/2001 titled Ram Dutt
v. DTC and another, a Division Bench of this Court passed an
order on 17th August, 2006 to the following effect:
“It is not in dispute that the judgment dated 18.04.2006

passed in the case of DTC v. Prakash Chand by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No(s) 71107111/2004 covers the issue involved in the present
appeal. We are of the view that the present appeal
should stand disposed of in terms of the said judgment.
Accordingly, we direct that the appellant shall be
reinstated without laying any claim for back wages in
accordance with the directions given by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case DTC v. Prakash Chand in
paras 1 and 2. The appellant is directed to join the duty
within six weeks from today.
The period during which the appellant remained out of
service will be taken into account for the purpose of
continuity so that certain retiral/ pensionary benefits
can be given to the appellant. The appellant will not
claim any back wages for the period when he was out of
service. The respondent shall also not recover any
amount paid to the appellant during this period.
With these directions, this appeal stands disposed of.”
(EMPHASIS SUPPLIED)
This is in fact reiteration of the orders of the Supreme Court in
Civil Appeal No.7110-7111/2004 titled DTC v. Prakash Chand.
Another Division Bench of this Court by an order dated 30th May,
2006 in CM No.7926/2006 titled DTC v. Naresh Kumar while disposing
the writ petition observed as under:

“Considering the above circumstances, we are of the
view that since the appellant themselves got this
appeal adjourned to await the orders of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, similar orders as that of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court needs to be passed in the present
matter also. Accordingly, the respondent is granted
reinstatement w.e.f. 1st July, 2006 subject to his
foregoing all claims for back wages arising from the
award dated 17.4.2001.”

We find no reason to take a different view and we pass
similar orders. We feel that the workmen have been reinstated in
service without laying any claim for back wages.

Therefore, we

order that the workmen shall not claim any back wages for the
period when they were out of service. The management shall also
not recover any amount paid to the workmen during this period.
The appeals stand disposed of in terms of the aforesaid
order.
