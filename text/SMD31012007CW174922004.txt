1.

The petitioner assails a letter dated 29.4.2002 from the DDA to

“Legal heirs of Sri Khazan Singh S/o Sri Kehar Singh” informing that

the allotment of the alternative plot (Plot No.64, Pocket-10, Block-B,
Sector 13) measuring 33.06 meters in Dwaraka Residential Scheme
under the Scheme of Large Scale Acquisition, Development and
disposal of land in Delhi, stands cancelled. The said letter reads-

“I am directed to inform you that the above
plot which was allotted to you has now been
cancelled by the competent authority due to
failure in payment.
Further, as per policy approved, three chances

It appears that the petitioner wrote to the DDA on 23.10.2003 making
a claim for the allotment of an alternative plot of land. To this, the
DDA replied on 21.11.2003 stating that the allotment already made
stood cancelled as had already been communicated by the letter dated
29.4.2002.

2.

The petitioner admittedly is one of the sons of late Sri Khazan

Singh. He has four sisters and his mother all of whom are arrayed as

respondent nos. 2 to 6. The petitioner does not dispute that if at all,
the entitlement under the Policy is only for a joint allotment to all the
legal heirs of Sri Khazan Singh. Still, he insists that merely because
the other legal heirs are not interested for some reason in claiming
their entitlement to an alternative plot in their capacity as legal heirs
of Sri Khazan Singh, he cannot be deprived of his entitlement. The
counsel for the petitioner also assails reasons given by the DDA for
the cancellation of the allotment. He submits that none of the three
letters of intimation of allotment were in fact received by him or by
any of the legal heirs of Sri Khazan Singh.

3.

The stand taken by the DDA on the basis of the records of the

case is contained in its counter affidavit dated 3.3.2005.

The first

draw of lots was held on 26.3.1993 and a demand-cum-allotment
letter was issued to Sri Ram Chander.

However, no payment was

received. Consequent upon a second draw of lots, another allotment
letter dated 20.1.1997 was issued. It is stated that at this stage one of
the sons of Sri Khazan Singh, Sri Ram Chander, had written to the
DDA on 8.5.1997 stating that allotment letter may be sent to him at
the address mentioned in the letter. However, this allotment was also
cancelled since the amount was not paid within the stipulated period.

4.

For a third time, the name of Sri Khazan Singh was included in

the draw of lots and a demand-cum-allotment letter was issued on
5.11.2001 addressed to Sri Ram Chander at the address given by him.
This was, however, returned undelivered. What transpired thereafter
is indicated in paras 11, 12 and 13 of the counter affidavit which
reads as under:-

“11. The answering

respondent therefore,

decided to serve the demand-cum-allotment
letter

through

personal

service.

The

concerned Dealing Assistant, LSB(R) made a
note at Page 16/N stating that:

“..... In the above context it is
submitted that perusal of the file
reveals that there are nine more
legal heirs and it is possible that
any one may be available on the
address as mentioned at Page
11/C.

We

may,

therefore,

if

agreed, request the AE(R) to get
the DAL delivered through his field
staff”
12.

In

response

thereto,

the

field

staff

visited 218-219 village and P.O. Mahipalpur,
New Delhi.

It was noted that Sri Ram

Chander was not living there. However, Smt.

Kella W/o Late Sri Khazan Sigh was available
but she refused to acknowledge the demandcum-allotment letter.

She also informed the

staff that Late Shri Khazan was already
allotted a plot in Dwaraka in lieu of acquired
land but was unable to give the details.
Accordingly, AE(R) made a relevant not in the
noting file.

A copy of the extract of the

relevant note is annexed hereto and marked as
ANNEXURE-R/1.

13.

After receiving the report on efforts

being made to personally serve the legal heirs
of Late Sri Khazan Sigh as decision a decision
was taken to cancel the allotment as no
payment was received and also no documents
were

received

for

mutation.

Thus,

the

allotment was canceled and the case was
finally closed vide letter dated 29.4.2002
(available at page 19 of the writ petition)”
The counsel for the petitioner vehemently disputes the above
explanation given by DDA and maintains that no letter was in fact
received by any of the legal heirs of Sri Khazan Singh.

5.

In order to satisfy itself that the stand taken by the DDA is

based on the records maintained by it, this Court summoned and
perused the records of the case. The Court is satisfied that DDA has
WP(C) No. 17492/2004

Page 5 of 7

made every effort to serve the letter of allotment on three occasions
on the legal heirs of Sri Khazan Singh. On the last occasion there is a
report of the staff of DDA stating that the allotment letter was not
accepted by the mother of the petitioner herein. There is absolutely
no reason why this report,

which forms part of the DDA records,

should be disbelieved.

6.

Counsel for the petitioner seeks to place reliance on the decision

of this Court in Sona Devi vs. DDA & Ors. 2001 V AD (Delhi) 297
where it was held that cancellation of allotment consequent upon the
non-receipt of such allotment letter by the allottee, would be
unsustainable in law. The said decision cannot apply in the instant
case where the facts reveal that letter of allotment was indeed
delivered to the heirs of late Sri Khazan Singh but not accepted. The
Court is satisfied that the decision of the DDA to cancel the allotment,
as communicated in the impugned letter dated 29.4.2002, does not
suffer from any legal infirmity.

7.

In the above circumstances, the writ petition is without merit

and is dismissed as such. No order as to costs.
