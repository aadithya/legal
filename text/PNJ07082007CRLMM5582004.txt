:

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Petitioner had employed late Mohan Lal as its

employee alleging that during course of employment
petitioner had given possession of a residential quarter to
Mohan Lal who had not returned possession thereof on
retirement, a complaint under Section 630 of the Companies
Act

1956

was

filed

before

the

learned

Metropolitan

Magistrate, Delhi.
2.

During pendency of the complaint, Mohan Lal

died.

Petitioner's application to bring on record his legal

heirs was dismissed by the learned ACMM vide order dated
23.8.2003.
3.

Petitioner's Crl.Rev.No.23/2004 was dismissed by

the learned Additional Sessions Judge vide order dated
2.11.2003.
4.

Petitioner has challenged both orders with a

prayer that application filed by the petitioner to bring on
record legal heirs of late Mohan Lal be allowed.
5.

Reason given by the Courts below is that with the

death of Mohan Lal a fresh cause of action has accrued to
the petitioner to institute fresh proceedings against the legal
heirs of the deceased employee.
6.

I am afraid, learned ACMM and the learned ASJ

have not correctly understood the legal provision enshrined
in the Companies Act namely Section 630 thereof.
7.

Wrongfully obtaining possession of the property

of a company or wrongfully withholding it or knowingly
applying it to a purpose other than that authorized by the
company makes the employee liable for punishment under
Section 630 of the Companies Act. The object is to not only
regulate the affairs of a company but protect the property of

the company.
8.

It is for said reason that Section 630 of the

Companies Act has been interpreted to mean that the
offence contemplated thereunder is a continuing offence.
9.

In the report published as 1995 RLR 232 (SC)

Smt.Abhilasha V.K.Jain vs. Cox & Kings, in para 17 the
Supreme Court observed:“17. S.630 of the Act provides speedy relief to the
company where its property is wrongfully obtained
or wrongfully withheld by an “employee or an
officer” or a “past employee or an officer” or “legal
heirs and representatives” deriving their colour and
content from such an “employee or officer” in so far
as the occupation and possession of the property
belonging to the company is concerned. The failure
to deliver property back to the employer on the
termination, resignation, superannuation or death
of an employee, would render the “holding” of that
property wrongful and actionable u/S.630 of the Act.
To hold that the “legal heirs” would not be covered
by S.630 of the Act would be unrealistic and
illogical. It would defeat the “beneficent” provision
and ignore, the factual realities that the legal heirs
of the family members who are continuing in
possession of the allotted property, had obtained
the right of occupancy with the concerned
employee in the property of the employer only by
virtue of their relationship with the employee/officer
and had not obtained or acquired the right to
possession of the property in any other capacity,
status or right.”
10.

Whether legal heirs of the deceased employee

have to be made accountable by and under a separate

petition or can be impleaded as legal heirs in the existing
petition, let me put a poser.
11.

If the employee, during the pendency of the

prosecution dies, can it reasonably be said that the
prosecution under Section 630 abates? The answer has to
be in the negative. The reason is that if the property of the
company was wrongly held by the employee, its possession
by its heirs and legal representatives would be called
wrongful.

Inasmuch as the employee was liable to return

the same, said heirs or legal representatives who come into
possession thereof would be equally liable. As long as the
liability remains, cause would survive in favour of the
company.
12.

The petition accordingly is allowed.

Impugned

order dated 28.11.2003 dismissing Crl.Rev. No.23/2004 is
set aside.

The revision petition is allowed.

As a

consequence thereof the order dated 23.8.2003 passed by
the learned ACMM, Delhi is set aside. Application filed by
the petitioner for impleadment of the legal heirs of deceased
Mohal Lal is allowed.
13.

Proceedings shall be revived by the learned

ACMM and after serving the legal heirs of deceased Mohan

Lal further proceedings would be conducted in accordance
with law.
14.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti by the

Registry to learned counsel for the petitioner on payment of
usual charges.
