By way of this writ petition, the National Federation of Telecom

Employees (petitioner no.1) a registered All India Trade Union
Organisation of Employees working with the Bhartiya Sanchar
Nigam Limited is challenging the grant of facilities by the Bhartiya
Sanchar Nigam Limited(respondent no.1 herein) to BSNL Employees

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 1 of 37

Union(respondent No. 2 herein). The writ petition is based on the
plea that the respondent no. 2 is not a registered trade union in its
own right but is a consortium, that such a consortium is not entitled
to be treated as a majority trade union representing the interests of
the employees of the respondent no. 1, and that grant of facilities to
respondent no. 2 is in violation of the Code of Discipline which is
applicable to the relationship between the respondent no. 1 and its
recognised trade unions and also in violation of the circular dated
25th November, 2004 issued by the respondent no. 4..
2.

There is no dispute to the material facts and to that extent that

the parties are at idem.

Bhartiya Sanchar Nigam Limited,

respondent no. 1, came into existence only on 1st October, 2000. The
National Federation of Telecom Employees NFTE, petitioner no. 1 is
a registered trade union of employees of the respondent no.1 having
registration no. 4906/2000 and came into existence on 17th
September, 2000.

It is contended that the petitioner no. 1 has

branches all over the country. The National Federation of Telecom
Employees is the Delhi circle office of the petitioner no. 1 at the local
level. After the constitution of the respondent no. 1, nearly 3.5 lakh

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 2 of 37

employees working in the erstwhile Department of Telecom Services
and Department of Telecom Operations were transferred on deemed
deputation to it. Approximately 3 lakh group C and D employees all
over India so brought out of these two departments exercised an
option for absorption in the Bhartiya Sanchar Nigam Limited in
March, 2001.
3.

It is averred that in order to resolve several questions relating

to terms of employment/absorption and other allied issues, a process
for membership verification for recognizition of a majority trade
union was deemed necessary. The management of the respondent
no.

1

consequently

held

meetings

with

all

the

federations/associations/unions as had existed in the two erstwhile
departments. One such meeting was held on the 27th February, 2001
in which representatives from the Ministry of Labour were also
present. A decision for membership verification for elections for
determination of the majority representative union was taken. It was
decided that such election would be by a secret ballot as per the
procedure laid down by the Ministry of Labour. It was directed by
the Ministry that only such unions which observed the Code of

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 3 of 37

Discipline would be entitled for participation in the verification
process.
4.

The process for election was evolved at the 16th Session of the

Indian Labour Conference held in May, 1958. As per the procedure
prescribed at this Conference, it is a union securing majority votes
subject to a minimum of 15% of the votes which becomes eligible for
recognition at the all-India level.
At the same time, a union which secures 50% of the votes in the
circle would have the right to deal with the matters of purely local
interests. Such matters would include matters relating to handling of
grievances pertaining to its own members.
5.

In the meeting held under the chairmanship of chairman cum

managing director of the respondent no. 1 on 27th February, 2001,
inter alia, the following decisions were taken :“2. Whether the proposed membership
verification is to be conducted through the
secret ballot under the auspices of Ministry
of Labour or through check off system to be
conducted by the BSNL.
It was unanimously agreed that the proposed
verification for election of a majority recognized
union should be conducted through secret ballot as
per the procedure laid down by the Ministry of
Labour.
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 4 of 37

6.

3.
Agreement to abide by the results of
the elections declared by the authorized
officer of the Ministry of Labour.
It was informed by the representatives of the
Ministry of Labour that only those unions which
observe Code of Discipline would be entitled for
participation in the verification process for
recognition as mention in Annexure I of Code of
Discipline (Criteria for recognition of unions).
4.
Finalisation and signing of the Code of
Discipline
to
be
followed
by
unions/associations
and
BSNL
management.
Though there were some reservations in
some quarters on the issue, the proposal was
agreed to by and large on clarification given by the
representatives of Ministry of Labour and agreeing
to the Code of Discipline is a prerequisite and no
changes in the same can be made as the same had
been finalized as per the deliberations in the ILC
and moreover it was equally binding on the
union(s) and the management.”
The Chief Labour Commissioner(Central) issued a clarification

that “Telecom” is to be treated as an “industry” and the “BSNL” as an
“establishment” .
Keeping in view the all India status of the telecom industry and
the Bhartiya Sanchar Nigam Limited establishment, it was agreed by
the Chief Labour Commissioner(Central) and the management of the
respondent no. 1 to treat the each of the nine telecom circles as a unit.
Accordingly, as per the agreement noticed above and as per the Code

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 5 of 37

of Discipline, only such union which secured majority votes subject to
a minimum of 15% votes at the all India level could be granted
recognition in the respondent no. 1.

Other than the majority

representative union, a unit which secured 50% votes or more in a
circle would have a right to deal with the matters of local interests of
its members with the local organistion.
It is manifest thereby that in addition an all India level
recognition to a trade union, recognition was also given to the circle
level organisation.

While the recognised majority representative

union at the all India level could also be having majority or having
the support of 50% of votes in a circle and hence be the circle
representative as well, however the same could very well be two
different trade unions.
7.

The material stipulations in the Code of Discipline for the

Criteria For Recognition Of Unions were as under :“1. Where there is more than one union, a union
claiming recognition should have been functioning for at
least one year after registration. Where there is only one
union, this condition would not apply.
2. The membership of the union should cover at least
15% of the workers in the establishment concerned.
Membership would be counted only of those who had
paid their subscription for at least three months during
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 6 of 37

8.

the period of six months immediately preceeding the
reckoning.
5.
Where there are several unions in an industry or
establishment, the one with the largest membership
should be recognised.
6.
A representative union for an industry in an area
should have the right to represent the workers in all the
establishments in the industry, but if a union of workers
in a particular establishment has a membership of 50%
or more of the workers of that establishment it should
have the right to deal with matters of purely local interest
such as, for instance, the handling of grievances
pertaining to its own members. All other workers who
are not members of that union might either operate
through the representative union for the industry or seek
redress directly.
8.
Only unions which observed the Code of Discipline
would be entitled to recognition.”
The first membership verification for recognition of a majority

representative union of non-executives was scheduled to be held on
the 25th September, 2002. The respondent no. 1 has pointed out that
nine trade unions got themselves registered with the Bhartiya
Sanchar Nigam Limited(respondent no.1) by the stipulated date and
participated in the membership process.
The National Federation of Telecom

Employees, BSNL

petitioner no. 1 herein secured above 15% votes and emerged as the
majority union. Accordingly, vide a notification bearing no. BSNL
/5/SR/2002 dated 4th October, 2002, this union was granted

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 7 of 37

recognition as the representative union at the all India/circle/SSA
levels for the period of two years with effect from 4th October, 2002 to
3rd October, 2004.
9.

It has also been pointed out that the respondent no. 2 namely

the BSNL Employees Union was registered on 15th June, 2001 and
was granted registration no. 4896. The respondent no. 2 secured
more than 50% votes in nine circles and was granted the right to deal
with the matters of purely local interest in such circles in conformity
with the Code of Discipline and the agreed minutes of the meeting
dated 28th September, 2001 and circulated on 9th October, 2001.
10.

The participating unions were mandatorily required to give an

undertaking that they would abide by the agreed Code of Discipline.
The petitioner no. 1 and the respondent no. 2 who had participated in
the membership verification process were permitted to do so as they
had given an undertaking that they would abide by the Code of
Discipline.
11.

It is noteworthy that there is no statutory requirement under

the Trade Union Act nor under the Code of Discipline, agreed to be
abided by the parties, which envisages grant of any facility to any

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 8 of 37

union.

However, in order to further the cause of harmonious

relations between the management and the union representatives,
certain facilities were extended to the recognised representative
union at the all India/circle/SSA levels after the first verification.
Orders in this behalf were issued on 5th December, 2002 to the
following effect :“All the Chief General Managers
Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited.
Subject : Grant of Facilities to the NFTE BSNL, the

So far as facilities at the circle level are concerned, keeping in

view the large size of the respondent no. 1,

BSNL Employees

Union(respondent no. 2), which was other than the majority
representative union, but was having more than 50% support in nine
circles was also given certain facilities vide the communication dated
5th December, 2002. The communication of the respondent no. 1 in

(A.K. PATHAK)
DDG(SR), BSNL HQs”
After the first membership verification process recognition was

given to these Unions. Such period of recognition of the unions was
expiring on the 3rd October, 2004 and therefore it was becoming
necessary to conduct a verification process afresh to ascertain the
major representative unions at the all-India and circle levels.
Accordingly, a meeting was convened on 23rd September, 2004 by the
respondent no. 1 which was presided over by the Chief Labour
Commissioner(Central).

This meeting was attended by all the 11

participating unions including the petitioner and the respondent no.
2.

The decision taken in this meeting was recorded and

communicated vide a letter dated 24th September, 2004. It was,
inter alia, decided that the elections would be conducted through a
secret ballot under the supervision of the Chief Labour Commissioner
(Central) and the participating unions were directed to submit a
certificate of acceptance in this behalf. It was also decided that all the
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 11 of 37

participating unions would submit their election symbol to the ADG
in writing under the signatures of their General Secretary or
Secretary General and a decision with regard to finalisation of
electoral roles was also taken.
Schedule of election through secret ballot was set down and
notified vide a notification dated 4th October, 2004. There were 10
participating eligible unions for the second membership verification
process, list whereof was circulated vide a letter dated 1st October,
2000. The petitioner and the respondent no. 2 were featuring at
serial no. 1 and 2 of such list. The final ballot paper giving the
election guide of the 11 participating unions was issued on 13th
October, 2004 and 14th October, 2004.
14.

Several steps taken to ensure fair elections and in order to

ensure that no voter is mislead into believing that formation of the
consortium would give a right for its recognition, the respondent no.
1 had issued instructions vide its communication dated 25th October,
2004 which reads as follows :“ No. BSNL/5/SR/2004/Vol.II

All General Secretaries of participating
unions
Sub: Conduct of 2nd membership verification
on 1.12.2004 for election of a majority
representative union of non-executive employees
in BSNL - clarification regarding.
It has been brought to the notice of the BSNL
Management by the Chief Returning Officer that
some unions have formed a consortium/alliance
after announcement of the verification process and
have issued appeal for voting in favour of a
particular union without officially withdrawing
from election process. This is despite the fact that
all such unions, except for one which is not
participating
in
verification
process,
are
nd
participating in the 2 membership verification for
electing a majority representation union in their
individual capacity for which they have also been
allotted election symbol and have been extended
certain facilities related to 2nd verification process.
It is also being projected by the consortium that in
the event the union supported by this
consortium/alliance is declared as majority union,
the signatory unions of the consortium/alliance
will also get the right to deal with the management
by way of extension of recognition & facilities
meant for majority representative union.
2.
As per the code of discipline and the
clarification given by the Chief Labour
Commissioner(C) from time to time and as has
also been the criteria followed in the 1st verification
process, it is once again reiterated that the
participating union which will get majority votes,
subject to minimum of 15% of the total votes, at all
India level will only be declared as majority
representative union of non-executive employees
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 13 of 37

in BSNL & will be extended the agreed facilities
thereafter. In addition, as already agreed, any
union, which is able to get 50% or more
membership (votes) at the Circle level, will also
have the right to deal with matters of purely local
interest of its own members at the Circle/SSA level
in these Circles. This would be in addition to the
Circle level organisation of the recognised union.
It is further clarified that the formation of
any alliance/consortium will not confer any
right to its member unions for grant of
reconised
representative
status
and
facilities which are meant only for majority
union in whatsoever manner.

The respondent no. 1 has pointed out that so as to ensure that

the elections are conducted in a free and fair manner ballot boxes
were arranged from the Election Commissioner of India. Paper seals
for sealing the ballot boxes and the indelible ink were arranged from
the sources from which the Election Commission of India procures
these items for conducting elections in the country that is from the
Government Press, Nasik and M/s Mysore Paints & Varnish Ltd.
Polling booths numbering 2283 were set up for the convenience of
the approximately 2,83,919 voters spread over the entire country.
There were separate polling and counting teams appointed and the
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 14 of 37

services of 147 poll observers from the Ministry of Labour were
utilised. Balance staff from the respondent no. 1 were appointed at
all the SSA and circle levels.

The election was conducted in an

absolutely free and fair manner. Approximately 92.63% voters cast
their ballot in the election held on 1st December, 2004. Counting
centres were spread all over the country and an observer either from
the Ministry of Labour or the Bhartiya Sanchar Nigam Limited and
representatives of the participating unions over saw the same at each
centre. Counting was held on 3rd December, 2004.
16.

The result was forwarded by the Assistant Returning Officer on

3rd December, 2004 itself to the respective CGMs of the circle in a
scheduled format. The results for each circle were compiled in the
presence of nominated returning officers, the observer from the
Ministry of Labour or from the respondent no. 1 and the
representatives of the participating unions in a prescribed format
which had been circulated earlier. The respective returning officers
forwarded these results on 3rd December, 2004 itself in the presence
of the aforstated persons. It was based on such results, received from
all the field unit/circles, that the Chief Returning Officer declared the

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 15 of 37

result on 4th December, 2004.
17.

The communication dated 4th December, 2004 has been placed

before this court as annexure R-17 to the counter affidavit. Perusal
thereof shows that the National Federation of Telecom Employees
BSNL petitioner herein secured 35.30% of the total number of votes.
The BSNL Employees Union(respondent no. 2 herein) secured
49.25% of the total votes on its own steam. In terms of votes, the
petitioner union had secured only 1,00,226 votes while the BSNL
Employees Union, respondent no. 2 had secured 1,39,827 votes. The
remaining votes were distributed amongst the other nine unions who
had participated in the membership verification process for which
the elections had been held.
18.

No objection whatsoever was made or filed by the petitioner

union to the respondent no. 1 or the Returning Officer or the Office of
the Chief Labour Commissioner. The petitioner was satisfied with
the election process and the declaration of the results.
19.

As per the Code of Discipline binding upon the parties, thus,

after the second membership verification process, the respondent no.
2 having secured majority votes in the election conducted through

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 16 of 37

secret ballot was declared as the majority representative union for a
period of two years, vide a notification dated 6th December, 2004.
20.

It is noteworthy that the petitioner secured 50% or more votes

in three circles i.e. the ALTC, Chhatisgarh and Maharashtra circle
and accordingly, apart from the recognised majority representative
union, was given the right to deal with matters of purely local interest
of its members at the circles/SSA levels in these three circles.
21.

The notification dated 6th December, 2004 issued by the

respondent no. 1 notifying the recognition of the respondent no.2 at
the all-India level and the branches of the petitioner no. 1 at three
circles in this behalf is to the following effect :“No. BSNL/5/SR/2004/Vol.II(i)

22.

In terms of the policy of the respondent no. 1 noticed

hereinabove certain facilities were extended to a trade union which
secured the majority status in order to facilitate and render it
convenient for it to discharge its duties in such capacity. Accordingly,

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 18 of 37

the respondent no. 1 issued letters dated 6th December, 2004
directing that facilities which were earlier granted to the outgoing
representative union, stood granted to the respondent no. 2 at the all
India/circle/SSA for the period of its recognition of two years with
effect from 6th December, 2004 to 5th December, 2006.

Such

facilities had been extended to the petitioner vide the communication
dated 2002 noticed hereinabove. This communication specifically
directed as follows :“ 3. The office accommodation along with
infrastructure and facilities provided to the
outgoing representative union and the Councils
shall stand transferred to the “BSNL Employees
Union” & the incumbent Councils.”
23.

Similarly, the petitioner was granted facilities in the ALTTC,

Chhatisgarh and Maharashtra circles vide a separate communication
dated 6th December, 2004 which included :“i.
Notice Board;
ii.
Telephone facilities as per existing procedure
iii. Grant of formal meetings by the
Management
iv. Facility of Special Casual Leave as per the
existing procedure.”

24.

The petitioner fully accepted the validity of the election and the

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 19 of 37

result thereof and issued a letter dated 8th December, 2004 to the
respondent no. 1 to the following effect :“No.TF-2/3(d). Dated: Dec. 8, 2004.
To,
The Dy. Director General (SR),
B.S.N.L.,
New Delhi.
Subject :Issues settled/pending in the National
Council
Sir,
Our Federation failed to acquire the status of
a recognised union.
If BSNLEU which is now the recognised
representatives union desires revision of any of the
decisions taken at our behest or stop the
processing of issues still pending in the National
Council, it may be done without hesitation.
I had made this request verbally in the
meeting on the 4th instant. This letter is in
confirmation of that request.
Yours faithfully,
Sd/(O.P. GUPTA)
SECRETARY GENERAL”
This letter was issued by Sh. O.P. Gupta, the Secretary General
of the petitioner no. 1 and recognized the fact that the respondent no.
2 was the majority union and was entitled to recognition of its such
status by the respondent no. 1.

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 20 of 37

25.

However by way of the present writ petition, the petitioner has

impugned the communication dated 6th December, 2004 whereby the
respondent no. 1 notified the recognition of the respondent no. 2 as a
majority union; the communication dated 12th January, 2005
whereby it was notified that the

accommodation bearing no. D2

Atul Grove Road, New Delhi was allotted to the petitioner and the
communication dated 28th January, 2005 whereby the petitioner was
directed to vacate and handover the office premises no. D-2, Atul
Grove Road immediately and handover the same to the respondent
no. 1.
26.

The entire thrust of the submission on behalf of the petitioner is

to be found in para 11 of the writ petition which reads as follows :“11. That as such the respondent No. 1 malafidely
ignored the said code of discipline and allowed the
said 6 other minor unions to form a united forum
in the name of BSNLEU, respondent no. 2 to
contest against the petitioner and such a forum of
6 unions together could get support of 139,827
employees which cannot be allowed since such a
body is neither registered nor it is entitled to
contest and seek recognition being a forum of 6
unions as per respondent no. 1 vide its circular
dated 25th Nov.2004 copy of which is annexed as
ANNEXURE P-5.”
It is an admitted position that the petitioner's allotment to the
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 21 of 37

premises was cancelled vide a letter dated 29th April, 2005.
27.

It had further been contended that the Chennai unit of the

petitioner has challenged the action of recognition of the respondent
no. 2 by filing a writ petition no. 1092/2005 before the High Court of
Judicature at Madras. It was pointed out that an interim order dated
19th January, 2005 was made granting status quo as on 1st October. It
appears that this order was effected however in a writ appeal no. 923924/2005 filed by the Chennai Unit of the petitioner, the status quo
order was restored.

No photocopy of the writ petition or the

application has been placed before this court and there is no material
to ascertain the nature of the litigation.
28.

It is settled law that an order will operate in terms of the

averments contained and the prayer made in the application on
which the same was granted. I find that the order dated 19th October,
2005 reads as follows :“1. Petition praying that in the circumstance
stated therein and in the affidavit filed there with
the High Court will be pleased to grant an order of
interim injunction restraining the first respondent
and his subordinates from accepting nominations
submitted by the 2nd respondent for the circle
councils in all telecom circles and local councils at
telecom Districts throughout the country pending
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 22 of 37

WP.”
29.

It is manifest that the prayer by the petitioner in Writ

Petition(Miscellaneous Petition) no. 1121/2005 which was filed in
Writ Petition No. /2005 was restricted to a injunction restraining the
respondents from accepting nominations submitted by the 2nd
respondent for the circle councils in the telecom circles and local
councils. The writ petition was dismissed vide a judgment dated 19th
April, 2005.

This order did not relate to any prohibition to the

respondent no. 1 recognising the respondent no. 2 as a majority
union nor raised any challenge to grant of the facilities as per the
aforestated policy of the respondent no. 1.
30.

The present writ petition was filed on 11th February, 2005 and

notice to show cause was issued to the respondents for 15th February,
2005.
31.

The respondent no. 1 has placed reliance on the order passed by

the Apex Court in Review Petition(Civil) Nos. 1111/1112/2002 in Civil
Appeals Nos. 3337 and 3338/2002 entitled Chairman, State Bank of
India & Anr-applicant vs All Orissa State Bank Officers Association &
Anr.(respondent) in the judgment dated 31st July, 2003. It has been

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 23 of 37

pointed out that the Apex Court, while reviewing its earlier judgment
dated 6th May, 2002, has observed that no legal right exists in a
minority union to represent its individual grievances of the
management in respect of its circles. It has been contended that the
Apex Court has held that even a majority union does not have such an
inherent right. Based on this submission, it has been contended that
the petitioner union has no right whatsoever to ask for any facility to
be granted to it by the petitioner.
32.

The present writ petition has been filed on a bald assertion

unsupported by any material to the effect that the respondent no. 2
was a federation and consortium, was part of a united forum and
hence was not entitled to contest elections against the petitioner.
33.

I may also notice that the petitioner has tried to take a different

stand in its rejoinder affidavit. It has been contended that a circular
had been issued which was in the nature of an appeal requesting the
BSNL employees to vote for an “ALL UNIONS ALLIANCE” in the
elections which were scheduled to be held on 1st December, 2004. It
was contended on behalf of the petitioner that this “All Unions
Alliance” consisted of

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

BSNL Employees Union(respondent no.2

page 24 of 37

herein), National Union of BSNL Workers (FNTO), Telecom
Employees Progressive Union, All India Backward Classes Telecom
Employees-Sangathan, All India SC/ST Telecom Employees Welfare
Association. A photo copy of a printed leaflet has been placed on
record.
34.

As already noticed above, the respondent no. 1 was vigilant and

had issued a circular dated 25th November, 2004 voting its employees
with regard to alliance. The respondent no. 2 on its own steam had
secured 49.2% votes.
35.

Perusal of the election results show that the other unions

named in this alleged appeal/leaflet secured the following votes

Name of the Union

Percentage of Vote

BSNL Employees
Union

49.25%

National Union of BSNL
Workers
Telecom Employees Progressive
Union
All India Backward Class
Telecom

0.19%
0.04%
0.12%

The respondent no. 2 has vehemently challenged the
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 25 of 37

allegations of the petitioner.

The results of the election noticed

hereinabove do not support the petitioner.

I have therefore no

hesitation in rejecting the argument of the petitioner that the
respondent no. 2 contested the election as an alliance or consortium.
The document which is being relied upon by the petitioner is an
unsigned document and is not supported by the fact situation laid out
in the writ petition or the counter affidavit. In any case the election
results non-suit the petitioner.
36.

In view of the foregoing discussion, the challenge in the present

writ petition is wholly devoid of any merit. There is no violation of
the circular dated 25th October, 2004 which was in the nature of a
caution to the parties participating in the election and the employees
of respondent no. 1. No particular Union or party is named therein
also.
37.

In the face of the admission and acceptance by the petitioner

that it had failed to acquire the status of a majority recognised union,
the petitioner can admittedly not be given any relief.
38.

It has been contended on behalf of the respondent no. 1 that the

petitioner has no right to raise the issues raised in the present writ

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 26 of 37

petition and in case it is aggrieved by any action of the respondents to
recognise it as representative of the workman, its remedy lies under
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. I find force in this submission
which is fortified by the pronouncement reported at 60 FJR 247
entitled T.C.C. Tshozhilali Union vs Travancore Cochinm Chemicals
Ltd. And 1983 1 LLJ 424 entitled Kerala Minerals Employees
Congress vs Assistant Labour Commissioner & Ors.
39.

I find that the submission made by the petitioner has no basis.

The respondent no. 2 did not contest the election as a united forum
with any other minority unions. It contested the election in its own
name and secured 49.25% votes of its own. The respondent no. 1 was
found to have the support of 1,39,827 employees. It contested the
election in its own election symbol and there is no challenge to these
facts by the petitioner.
Against this, the petitioner has secured 1,00,226 votes only
which formed 35.30% votes alone.
40.

The respondent no. 1 has placed before this court at page 171 of

the paper book the election results which were communicated by the
Chief Election Officer duly signed by the observers of the authorities

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 27 of 37

and by representatives of all the unions including the petitioner
herein. The petitioner had accepted the validity of the election in its
letter dated 8th December, 2004.

There is no challenge to the

membership verification process in the present writ petition.
41.

The facilities given by the respondent no. 1 are intended for the

benefit of the employees of the respondent no. 1. The office facilities
are permitted to be utilised by respondent no. 1 for the purposes of
furthering the cause of the employees of the respondent no. 1 and not
for the furtherance of the working of any particular trade union. The
petitioner was permitted to occupy the premises in terms of the
communication dated 5th December, 2002 which explicitly specified
that the petitioner was recognized only for the period of two years
with effect from 4th October, 2002 to 3rd October, 2004.
42.

In 2003 (10) SCC 152 entitled Ramanuj Prasad vs Coal India

Limited & Ors., it was held that as the petitioner did not have any
legal right to continue to hold the post, no writ of mandamus
directing the respondents to either regularise the petitioner's service
in this grade or to promote him to such grade could be issued.
43.

As there was no statutory right to claim interest on a delay in

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 28 of 37

refund earlier to a statutory amendment, in AIR 1998 SC 1729
entitled Union of India & Ors. Vs Orient Enterprises and Anr., the
Apex Court held that in the absence of such statutory right, writ
petition claiming such benefit was not maintainable.
44.

In 1994 (28) DRJ 133 entitled Shri. Rajender Kakkar & Ors. Vs

DDA, persons who were encroachers on public land and had raised
unauthorised buildings were seeking protection in a writ petition
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The Court held that
persons who are encroachers, never had any right to legal possession
of the public land and therefore had no legal right which could be
protected by issuance of a writ in their favour.
45.

It is settled law that a writ in the nature of a mandamus may

issue to compel the authority to do something. However it must be
shown that a legal duty was statutorily cast on the authority and the
person claiming had a legal right under the statute to enforce its
performance (Re : 1974 I SCR 165 entitled State of Haryana vs
Subhash Chander Marwaha & Ors.)
46.

It is therefore settled law that a party seeking entitlement to

grant of a relief must show an existing legal right which deserves to

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 29 of 37

be protected. In the instant case, the petitioner has no legal or vested
right to continue to occupy the premises which were given to it
pursuant to the order dated 5th December, 2002. As such no relief
can be given to the petitioner in the instant writ petition.
47.

In this behalf, I may also appropriately refer to the

pronouncement of the Apex Court in (1997) 1 SCC 486 entitled Mani
Subrat & Ors vs State of Haryana & Ors. wherein the court held thus
:“9. xx It is elementary though it is to be
restated that no one can ask for a mandamus
without a legal right. There must be a judicially
enforceable right as well as a legally protected
right before one suffering a legal grievance can
ask for a mandamus. A person can be said to
be aggrieved only when a person is denied a
legal right by someone who has a legal duty to
do something or to abstain from doing
something. (See Halsbury's Laws of England,
4th Ed., Vol I paragraph 122; (1974) 1 SCR 165
entitled State of Haryana v. Subash Chander
Marwaha; (1976) 3 SCR 58 entitled Jasbhai
Motibhai Desai v. Roshan Kumar Haji Bashir
Ahmed and Ferris : Estraordinary Legal
Remedies, paragraph 198.)”
48.

Before parting with the case I cannot help but notice that the

entire gamut of industrial legislation has been enacted as social
welfare laws to protect the rights of workers and ensure justice to
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 30 of 37

them while furthering industrial harmony. Trade unions have been
granted statutory recognition to provide for collective bargaining so
that the voiceless worker without any financial power is not
smothered under the economic might of the industrial establishment
employing him.
Benefits and facilities provided by the employer to facilitate the
working of the trade union espousing the cause of the workers must
be appreciated and the stipulations conferring such rights must be
respected.
49.

In the spirit of the welfare of the labour a union having lost its

majority should not require notices from the establishment for
handing over such facilities to the new majority union. Having opted
for elections, all participants should unflinchingly abide by the result.
Exception being, challenge thereto on strong legal grounds.
Futile and speculative litigation on wholly untenable and
baseless grounds with the intent of perpetuating enjoyment of
facilities by an outgoing union is, in my view, abhorrent to the very
genesis for which a trade union is created and recognised.

It is

opposed to labour welfare and must be discouraged in no uncertain

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 31 of 37

terms.
50.

The present writ petition, has been filed by the petitioner to

perpetuate its occupation of accommodation and use of the other
facilities which intended for the benefit of the employees of
respondent no. 1 for whose cause the accommodation is made
available to the majority trade union. This, in my view, is an act
opposed to the interest of the workmen and ought not to be
countenanced.
51.

After this judgment had been dictated and prior to

pronouncement, the respondents mentioned the matter seeking leave
to place before this court the judgments passed in its favour.
52.

Accordingly the matter was posted for directions on 6/09/05

and opportunity was given to both sides to make submissions. I find
that the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Chennai in
writ appeal no. 923 and 924/2005 entitled National Federation of
Telecom Employees vs the Chairman and Managing Director, BSNL
& Another has passed a detailed judgment.

The petitioner in the

instant case was placing reliance on the interim orders passed in writ
appeal. The present respondent no. 2 i.e. BSNL Employees Union

W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 32 of 37

was arrayed as respondent no. 3 in writ appeal no. 924/2005. Vide
the judgment dated 3rd August, 2005 dismissing the appeal, the
Division Bench observed as under :“20. In paragraph 6 of the counter affidavit it is
stated that the letter dated 25.11.2004 issued by
BSNL has been cited out of context by the
petitioner. The letter nowhere prohibits any
alliance.
In fact the NFTE enjoyed
representative status and operated with an
alliance between 2002 and 2004. Hence it
cannot blow not and cold together.
21. We have also perused the counter
affidavits

filed in W.P.No. 1092 of 2005.
22. On the facts of the case, we find no merit in
these writ appeals.
23. The third respondent Union had secured
1,39,827 votes as against 1,00,226 votes secured
by the petitioner Union.
Hence the third
respondent Union was rightly declared as the
majority representative. We agree with the
respondents that the conduct of election was
fair, and for the purpose of deciding the
majority, the combined strength of the
consortium was not taken into account, but only
symbol wise polled votes. In fact in the year
2002 when the petitioner Union (NFTE) was
successful it had formed an alliance with other
Unions. Hence, we cannot see how it can
approbate and reprobate at the same time. In
fact before the Andhra Pradesh High Court the
writ petitioner Union took a reverse stand to
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 33 of 37

what it is taking now. Thus, it is blowing hot and
cold together.
24. Respondents 1 and 2 have recognised only
BSNL Employees Union as the majority
representative Union for two years and has not
recognised the alliance/consortium members as
a recognised Union. As clarified by the letter
dated 25.11.2004, no rights were conferred to
the member Union of the alliance, and the Union
facilities were also not extended to the other
trade unions.
25. It appears that after losing in the election,
the appellant/Union through its circle units have
filed petitions seeking different relief in various
High Courts e.g. Chattisgarh High Court, Jammu
and Kashmir High Court, Delhi High Court,
Madhya Pradesh High Court, Calcutta High
Court and two petitions in Madras High Court.
In our opinion, this is clearly a case of forumshopping which was indulged by the
appellant/Union.
26. In All India State Bank Officers
Federation v. Union of India, 1990 (Supp.) SCC
336 the practice of simultaneous filing of writ
petitions on the same issue though purportedly
on behalf of different associations was
emphatically disapproved by the Supreme Court.
It may be submitted that the code of discipline
relied on by the appellant is not a statutory code.
The Trade Unions Act, 1926 does not provide for
recognition of Trade Unions. Thus the order
dated 06.12.2004 by which the second
respondent was granted recognition was not a
statutory order nor was the order dated
07.01.2005 reconstituting the National Council.
27. In a similar case dweling with the
recognition of the Trade Unions the Supreme
Court in Chairman, State Bank of India vs.
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 34 of 37

Orissa State Bank of India Officesr's Assocition,
2003 (11) SCC 607, had held that it is not
possible for the High Court to exercise its powers
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to
direct the employer in the matter of
representation of Unions.
28. Apart from the above, we are also of the
opinion that the writ petitions were liable to be
dismissed on the ground that the petitioner
Union suppressed material facts by filing similar
writ petitions in various other High Courts as
stated above. It is well settled that writ is a
discretionary remedy, and should not be issued
in favour of persons who had suppressed
material facts, vide All India State Bank Officers
Federation v. Union of India(supra).
29. In view of the above, the writ appeals are
dismissed with costs. Consequently, the interim
order granted by this Court is vacated and the
vacate say petitions are closed.”
53.

The respondents have also placed before this court a decision

dated 3rd May, 2005 by the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir passed
in Original Writ Petition No. 19/2005 entitled National Federation of
Telecom Employees (BSNL ) vs the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited &
Ors, it appears that the petitioner sought an appropriate writ
commanding the respondents to issue a formal notification in favour
of the petitioner after granting the same status of representative body
at the Jammu & Kashmir circle/SSA Levels and provision of all
facilties as were envisaged by the Code of Discipline and the
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 35 of 37

clarifications

made by the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central)

from time to time.

After consideration of the various provisions

governing conduct of elections for clarification of membership, the
Court held as follows :“The petitioner-federation has secured 1299 votes
of the total votes polled which apparently is more
than 50%. The petitioner case is that since it has
obtained more than 50% votes polled the
federation is entitled to represent the employees at
the State level while as the stand of the employees
is that it is not 50% of the votes polled but 50% of
the total membership.
The communication
reproduced above on the basis of which both the
parties lay their claim, in unambiguous words
provides 50% or more of membership (votes) at
the circle level. It does not provide 50% or more of
votes polled. Thus, the Federation can claim to be
the representative of the employees only if it is
able to get 50% or more membership (votes) at the
circle.
In the present case the petitionerfederation has not secured 50% or more or
membership votes but more than 50% of votes
polled. Thus, having not fulfilled the requirement
of getting 50% or more of membership (votes), the
petitioners cannot claim to be the representative of
the employees at the State level. The petitioners
have in support of their cause cited the example of
ALTTC Chattisgarh and Maharashtra but a perusal
of the result-sheet shows that all the three
association have secured more than 50% of total
membership, as such, they have been given right to
represent the employees at the State level.
Under these circumstances, I find there is no
case in favour of the petitioners. The petition is,
W.P.(C) 2754-55/2005

page 36 of 37

therefore, dismissed.”
54.

These judgments support the view I have taken.
In view of the foregoing, I find no manner of doubt that no

relief can be granted to the petitioner in the present writ petition.
55.

Accordingly this petition is dismissed with costs which are

quantified at Rs.10,000/- to be paid in equal proportion to
respondent nos. 1 & 2.
