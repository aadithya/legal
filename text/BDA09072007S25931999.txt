1.
This application under Order VII Rule 11 read with Order 1 Rule 10 (2)
read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter
referred to as the CPC) has been filed on behalf of defendant Nos. 1-3. In the
first instance, the defendants have prayed that the plaint be rejected as it does
not disclose a cause of action against the defendant Nos. 1-3. The rejection of
the plaint has also been sought on the ground that the same is barred by time.
In the alternative it has been prayed that the names of the defendant Nos. 1-3
be deleted from the array of the parties.

2.

In the plaint it is alleged that the plaintiff No.1, a German national, was

employed by the plaintiff No.2 as a “flight attendant” with the German Air
Force. The defendant No. 1 (C. J. International Hotels Limited) owns the
defendant No. 3 hotel (Le Meridien Hotel, Windsor Place, New Delhi). The
defendant No.2 is the Chairperson and Managing Director of the defendant No.
1 company. The defendant No.4 is the proprietor of Oswal Gems, situated in
shop No.5 within the hotel premises of the defendant No.3. It is in this shop
that the incident, which is the subject matter of the suit, took place. The
defendant No.5 is the son of defendant No.4. It is alleged that the defendant
No.5 committed criminal assault upon the plaintiff No.1. The defendant No.6
is an employee of defendant No.4, who was allegedly present in the premises at
the time of the occurrence of the incident.

3.

It is alleged that on 01.11.1996, the plaintiff No.1 accompanied the

German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Mr Guenther Rexrodt, on his
flight, in her capacity as a flight attendant to New Delhi, for a stop over in
Delhi on the way back from Jakarta to Germany.

The German delegation

accompanying the Minister was booked for stay at the defendant No.3 hotel
from 01.11.1996 to 02.11.1996.

The plaintiff, as part of the delegation,

checked into the hotel and was allotted room No. 1265. On 01.11.1996 itself,
at about 7 pm, the plaintiff No.1 went to the shop of the defendant No.4 (Oswal
IA 8517/2000 in CS(OS) 2593/99

Page No. 2 of 13

Gems) with a view to purchase some jewellery items. It is alleged that at that
time the defendant Nos. 5 and 6 were present in the shop. It is further alleged
that the defendant No.5 met the plaintiff inside the shop and invited her into a
cabin constructed within the shop with the pretext of showing her jewellery.
He asked the plaintiff No.1 to sit down and showed her some jewellery items.
Soon thereafter the defendant No.5 alleged went out of the cabin and returned
with a statue, which he suddenly struck the plaintiff with on her head and gave
her three powerful blows. It is alleged that the plaintiff No.1 started bleeding
profusely and she almost lost consciousness. Thereafter, it is alleged that the
defendant No.5 attempted to rape the plaintiff No.1. It is further alleged in the
plaint that the plaintiff No.1 put up firm resistance as a result of which the
defendant No.5 was not able to commit rape.

The defendant No.5 was

allegedly angered by this and threatened the plaintiff that he would kill her.
The defendant No.5 once again left the cabin to return shortly thereafter
holding a knife in his hand.

Apparently, the defendant No.5 pushed the

plaintiff No.1 into a corner and struck her in the stomach with the knife. But,
fortunately, due to the resistance put up by the plaintiff No.1, the knife did not
pierce the skin. The plaintiff No.1 was able to gather all her courage and acted
with composure and presence of mind and started talking with the defendant
No.5 to placate and pacify him. According to the plaintiff No.1, the talk,
fortunately, had a salutary effect on the defendant No.5 and after about 30 to 35
minutes the plaintiff was permitted to gather her clothes and leave the shop.

It is alleged that thereafter the plaintiff No.1 went to the lobby of the

defendant No.3 hotel and in a completely dazed state of mind, suffering
extreme mental and physical trauma, sat down on a sofa in the lobby to
compose herself. A little while later the plaintiff No.1 got into the elevator and
went up to her room where her trauma apparently increased and she wept
bitterly. The narration of incidents which followed goes on in the plaint. What
is material to note is that when this incident was narrated to the staff of the
defendant Nos. 1-3, they sought to underplay the same and were allegedly
interested in suppressing and concealing the incident.

However, when the

colleagues of the plaintiff No.1 reached the hotel and the plaintiff No.1 was
examined by the Medical Squadron of Air Transport Wing, Germany, who
administered her with first aid, she was in a position, the following day, that is,
on November 2, 1996 to lodge an FIR No. 430/96 with Police Station
Parliament Street, New Delhi. A case under Section 342/323/506/376/511 of
the Indian Penal Code, 1860 was registered by the police. The case emanating
from that is continuing.

5.

The plaintiff filed the suit claiming damages from all the defendants

jointly and severally for a sum of DM 2,00,000 in respect of criminal assault
resulting in the injury to the head, the attempted rape, the stab wounds, the
insult and violation of modesty of the plaintiff No.1 and for the permanent
IA 8517/2000 in CS(OS) 2593/99

Page No. 4 of 13

mental psychosis suffered by the plaintiff No.1 as a consequence of the
incident. The plaintiff No.2 has also made a claim for damages in the amount
of the salary paid to the plaintiff No.1. The defendant Nos. 1-3 have also been
alleged to be responsible for causing mental trauma and physical harm to the
plaintiff No.1.

The reasons given in the plaint are that the defendant No.3

hotel professes, projects, promotes and advertises itself as a top class hotel with
five star rating, offering and assuring the best services and luxuries. As per the
plaintiffs, the defendant No.3 hotel thus prompts and invites its guests to stay
with it and that it was on the basis of such advertisement and projection of its
high standards by the defendant No.3 hotel that the plaintiff No.1 along with
the German delegation decided to stay in the said hotel.

According to the

plaintiffs the above constitutes a proposal, acceptance and promise whereby a
formal and binding contract was established between the defendant Nos.1 and 3
as promisors and the plaintiff No.1 as promisee whereunder the defendant Nos.
1 and 3, in consideration of a high price paid by, or on behalf of, the plaintiff
No.1, promised to provide her the best services, safe and comfortable stay at the
hotel, which included security as well as the assurance against physical harm or
injury from any source or quarter whatsoever while inside the premises of the
defendant No.3 hotel.

It is alleged in the plaint that the defendant No.3 was

under a contractual obligation and was directly responsible to secure and ensure
the safety of its guests including the plaintiff No.1 during the time she was
inside the hotel premises. Since the defendant No.3 failed in the performance
IA 8517/2000 in CS(OS) 2593/99

Page No. 5 of 13

of this obligation, the defendant Nos. 1-3 were also liable for the negligence
under the law of Torts. It was further contended that the defendant No 3 had
given out on lease / rent shops within its premises where business offices and
retail outlets had been opened. It was the duty of defendant No.3 to have not
rented out / leased the shop to persons such as defendant No.4, 5 and 6.
According to the plaintiffs, the liability of the defendant No.3 hotel in the suit
for breach of contract, negligence under the law of Torts and vicarious liability
for the negligence by the defendant No.4 and criminal attack by the defendant
No.5 stands established.

6.

It is in the background of these averments contained in the plaint that the

aforesaid application under Order VII Rule 11 read with Order 1 Rule 10(2)
CPC needs to be considered. Firstly, it has been contended by the applicants/
defendants 1-3 that the plaint discloses no cause of action against the
applicants. According to the applicants the defendant No.5 and for that matter
the defendant No.4 are not in the employment of or under the control of the
defendant Nos. 1-3. The shop Oswal Gems is under licence to the defendant
No.4 and there has been no representation that the shop belongs to the
defendant No.1. It is contended that for any claims against any dealings in the
shop, the applicants / defendant Nos. 1-3 could not have been made liable, far
less for the alleged criminal act of the defendant No.5, which is the substance
IA 8517/2000 in CS(OS) 2593/99

Page No. 6 of 13

of the plaint. It is submitted that in the light of these facts, there is no cause of
action against the applicants / defendant Nos. 1-3, either in contract or in Torts.
It was also contended that there is no relationship of control over the defendant
Nos. 4 and 5 and the defendant Nos. 4 and 5 did not in any manner hold
themselves out to be agents of the applicants / defendant Nos. 1-3. It was
further contended that the defendant Nos. 4 and 5 did not have any past
criminal record to the knowledge of the defendant Nos. 1-3 and there were no
anticipated gains to be held by the applicants / defendant Nos. 1-3 from the
alleged act of the defendant No.5. Hence, there could be no vicarious liability
of the defendant Nos. 1-3 in respect of the acts of the defendant No.5. It was
submitted that the plaintiff No.1 went to the shop of her own volition and no
FIR was filed against the applicants / defendant Nos. 1-3. It was, therefore,
contended that no part of the cause of action arises against and or in respect of
the applicants / defendant Nos. 1-3 and that, therefore, the plaint ought to be
rejected under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.

7.

The learned counsel for the plaintiffs supported the averments made in

the plaint and sought to counter these arguments. It will not be necessary to go
into any detailed discussion as to whether a cause of action arises in respect of
the defendant Nos. 1-3 or not. A plaint cannot be rejected under Order VII
Rule 11 CPC merely because the cause of action does not arise in respect of
some of the defendants. As long as there is a cause of action for filing of the
IA 8517/2000 in CS(OS) 2593/99

Page No. 7 of 13

suit and the same is disclosed in the plaint, Order VII Rule 11 CPC would not
come into play. In Nahar Spinning Mills Ltd. v. Vijay Hosiery Co. Ltd and
Others: 129 (2006) DLT 50, I had occasion to examine the scope and ambit of
Order VII Rule 11 CPC and in particular Clause (a) thereof which deals with
cause of action. It is clear that Order VII Rule 11 (a) stipulates that the plaint
ought to be rejected where it does not disclose a cause of action. In Nahar
Spinning Mills (supra), after discussing the entire case law on the subject, this
Court had observed that the Court cannot dissect the pleadings into several
parts and consider whether each one of them discloses a cause of action. It was
observed that it is well settled that there cannot be a partial rejection of the
plaint. It is only when the plaint read as a whole does not disclose any cause of
action, can the same be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 (a) . Rejection of
only a particular portion of the plaint is not permissible. After considering the
decisions of the Supreme Court in the case of Sopan Sukhdeo Sable v. Asstt.
Charity Commr., (2004) 3 SCC 137, Roop Lal Sathi v. Nachhattar Singh
Gill: (1982) 3 SCC 487 and D. Ramachandran v. R. V. Janakiraman: (1999)
3 SCC 267 and several other decisions, this Court in Nahar Spinning Mills
(supra) held as under:“The above discussion reveals that cause of action refers to a
bundle of facts the existence of which entitles one person to
obtain from the Court a remedy against the other. It must also
be remembered that the pleadings must only contain a
statement in a concise forms of material facts on which the
party realise for his claim or his defence as the case may be
but in the evidence by which they are to be proved. (see Order
IA 8517/2000 in CS(OS) 2593/99

Page No. 8 of 13

VI Rule 2(1)]. It is also well settled that the plaint must be
read as a whole to ascertain that it discloses a cause of action.
The plaint cannot be defective and those portions which do
not disclose cause of action cannot alone be rejected. Either
the plaint survives in its entirety or is rejected in its entirety.
If a defendant states that no relief can be claimed against him
on the averments contained in the plaint itself, he cannot ask
for rejection of the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 (a) as long
as the plaint as a whole discloses a cause of action although
against other defendants. Such a defendant can only, propose
in both the provisions of Order I Rule 10 for seeking deletion
of his name as a party to the suit. ...”
Viewed in this light, it is obvious that the plaint cannot be rejected. Even if it
is assumed that there is no cause of action against the defendant Nos. 1-3, the
plaint definitely discloses a cause of action in respect of the other defendants.
Although it is not necessary for the purposes of this application to go into the
question as to whether there is any cause of action in respect of the defendant
Nos. 1-3, upon a mere reading of the plaint, it cannot be said that the plaintiffs
do not have any cause of action. It may very well turn out that ultimately the
plaintiffs are not able to establish their case on facts and on law against the
defendant Nos. 1-3 and no relief may be given against such defendants, but at
this stage, by merely examining the averments contained in the plaint, it cannot
be said that the plaintiffs do not have any cause of action even in respect of the
defendant Nos. 1-3.

8.

The next point urged on behalf of the applicants / defendant Nos. 1-3

was that the claims made by the plaintiffs in the suit were barred by limitation.
IA 8517/2000 in CS(OS) 2593/99

Page No. 9 of 13

As such the plaint ought to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 (d) CPC, which
stipulates the rejection of a plaint where the suit appears from the statements in
the plaint, to be barred by any law. In this context, it was pointed out that the
alleged incident is of 01.11.1996 and the period of three years provided under
The Limitation Act, 1963 for claims of the nature made in the plaint, expired on
01.11.1999. The suit was, admittedly, filed on 22.11.1999. It was, therefore,
beyond the time prescribed for filing such a suit and, therefore, the provisions
of Order VII Rule 11(d) clearly came into play and the plaint was liable to be
rejected.

9.

At first blush, this appears to be a convincing argument. However, the

matter is not so simple. Order VII Rule 6 CPC provides that where the suit is
instituted after the expiration of the period prescribed by the law of limitation,
the plaint shall show the grounds upon which exemption from such law is
claimed. There is a proviso which enables the Court to permit the plaintiff to
claim exemption from the law of limitation on any ground not set out in the
plaint, if such ground is not inconsistent with the grounds set out in the plaint.
This proviso, of course, does not come into play in the present case. The point
is that a suit may be instituted after the expiration of the period prescribed by
the law of limitation. The plaintiff is required to indicate in the plaint itself the
ground upon which exemption from such law is claimed. It is obvious that if
no such ground is indicated or no such exemption is claimed, then the plaint, if
IA 8517/2000 in CS(OS) 2593/99

Page No. 10 of 13

it is beyond the period prescribed by the law of limitation, would be liable for
rejection straightaway under Order VII Rule 11 (d) CPC. The facts in the
present case indicate that the plaintiffs were mindful of these provisions. In the
first instance, it has been stated that the period of limitation had not run out
because of circumstances indicated in paragraph 41 of the plaint. However, in
the alternative, it was averred in plaint that the plaintiffs are entitled to
exemption from the law of limitation for the reason that the plaintiff No.1
suffered from psychosis due to the trauma caused by the incident.

This

prevented her from acquiring knowledge about her legal right to file a suit
against the defendants for damages until March, 1998.

There are other

circumstances and grounds in the plaint which have been set up by the plaintiffs
for seeking exemption from the application of the law of limitation.

10.

It is, therefore, clear that the plaintiffs have invoked the provisions of

Order VII Rule 6 CPC and claimed exemption. Whether they are entitled to the
exemption or not would depend upon the plaintiffs establishing their averments
by leading evidence in respect thereof. This is not the stage at which the
question of whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the exemption or not, can be
decided.

The same can be decided only upon evidence.

This being the

position, the plaint cannot be rejected on this ground also.

IA 8517/2000 in CS(OS) 2593/99

Page No. 11 of 13

11.

This leaves me with the discussion of the alternative prayer of the

defendant Nos. 1-3 and that is of deleting the names of the defendant Nos. 1-3
from the array of parties. This prayer is essentially one under Order 1 Rule 10
(2) CPC on the ground that the defendant Nos. 1-3 are neither necessary parties
nor proper parties.

This has to be examined from the standpoint of the

averments made in the plaint.

As far as the question of who is a necessary

party and who is a proper party, the same is well settled. A necessary party is
one without whom no order can be made effectively and a proper party is one in
whose absence an effective order can be made but whose presence is necessary
for a complete and final decision of the question involved in the proceeding. If
any authorities are needed for this proposition, they are :(i)

Sarvinder Singh v. Dalip Singh: (1996) 5 SCC 539

(ii)

Aliji Momonji & Co. v. Lalji Mavji: (1996) 5 SCC 379

(iii) U. P. Awas Evam Vikas Parishad v. Gyan Devi: (1995) 2 SCC

(iv) Ramesh Hirachand Kundanmal v. Municipal Corporation of
Greater Bombay: (1992) 2 SCC 524 and
(v)

Udit Narain Singh Malpaharia v. Addl. Member, Board of
Revenue, Bihar: AIR 1963 SC 786.

12.

In the light of the discussion above, based upon the averments made in

the plaint, it cannot be said that the defendant Nos. 1-3 are not even proper
IA 8517/2000 in CS(OS) 2593/99

Page No. 12 of 13

parties. Their presence would definitely be necessary for a complete and a final
decision of the questions involved in the suit. In fact, as per the pleadings,
claims have also been made against the defendant Nos. 1-3. Once this is the
case, it cannot be held that the names of the defendant Nos. 1-3 be struck off
from the array of parties.
Accordingly, this application is dismissed.
