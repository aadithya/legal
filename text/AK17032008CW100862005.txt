1.

wages whichever is higher during the pendency of the present writ
petition.

The applicant has contended that the petitioner has challenged

the order dated 25th July, 2002 passed by Industrial Tribunal II, Delhi,
rejecting the application of the management seeking approval under
Section 33 (2)(b) of the Act.

3.

The operation of the order impugned by the petitioner was stayed

by order dated 6th July, 2005 and consequently the applicant is not
liable to be reinstated.

The applicant contended that he is out of job

since his dismissal from the services on 14th July 1993 and has not
been employed in any establishment ever since and he has no means of
livelihood.

The applicant contended that he was getting Rs.2,100/- at

the time of his dismissal and presently a Conductor of DTC gets
Rs.10,000/-

as

salary.

The

application

is

contested

by

the

petitioner/non-applicant contending that the respondent has not come
with clean hands and he has suppressed the material facts that he is
working and earning his livelihood. The non-applicant/petitioner has
denied that the workman is out of job since his removal from the service
on 14th July, 1993 and has not been employed in any establishment
ever since and has no means of livelihood.

The averment of the

applicant that respondent is entitled for last drawn full monthly wages
is also denied.

A full bench of this Court in (2005) III- LLJ Delhi 390 in the

matter of Delhi Transport Corporation Vs Jagdish Chander had held
that the provision of section 17 B of the Act will be applicable to the writ
petition filed against the order passed on the application of the
management under section 33 (2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947. Referring to various decisions, the full Court had held that the
emphasis of the legislature in Section 17B was on the expression
`reinstatement’ rather than on award and cumulative effect of Sections
2(b) and 2(k) defining award and `industrial dispute’ demonstrated that
the expressions has been widely worded to take within their ambit
duties relatable to any person who satisfied the conditions stated
therein. Consequently the provision of section 17B are available to the
respondent provided he is unemployed. The respondent has stated on
affidavit that he is unemployed which fact has been denied by the
petitioner. The petitioner except the bare denial of the plea of the
respondent about unemployment has not disclosed any such facts
which will show that the respondent is gainfully employed. On the plea
of the petitioner that the respondent could not have remained
unemployed for such a long period, it cannot be inferred that the
respondent has been employed.

Granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing orders

directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule; refusing to
grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as it could be passed
only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional error where there is
no relationship between the parties. In the present case the this has not
been disputed that there is relationship of employee and employer
between the petitioner and the applicant While considering an
application under this provision it is necessary to bear in mind that the
spirit, intendment and object underlying the statutory provision of
Section 17B, is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship
resulting to a workman due to delay in the implementation of the
consequence of dismissal of the application of the petitioner resulting
into reinstatement of his services on account of the challenge made to it
by the employer. The preliminary consideration for making available
such a relief to a workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of
the enactment. It recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to
keep body and soul together when a challenge has been made to the
order passed by the Labor Court. The statutory provisions provide no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment which is required to be
made by the employer to the workman has been held to be akin to a
subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor recoverable from
a workman even if the petitioner is allowed by the High Court. In 1999

(2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex
Court was of the view that the object under Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the
hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay in
implementation of the Award. The practice of disposal of the petition as
well as the application under Section 17B of the Act contemporaneously
was deprecated and the High Court was directed to first expeditiously
dispose of the application under Section 17B by the Supreme Court by
its decision reported at VII (2000) SLT 70=JT 2000 (8) SC 501,
Workmen Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Hindustan
Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. & Ors.

6.

Since the section itself mentions ‘employment in establishment’

self employment quite apparently is not in contemplation. Workman
can be denied the benefits under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes
Act only when it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the
workmen have been employed and have been receiving adequate
remuneration during the period of pendency of the writ petition. It is
thus well settled that transient employment by the workman does not
affect his entitlement to receive wages pending decision; that is to say
that, the benefit of Section 17B of the Act cannot be denied merely
because the workman is engaged in some activity or in some vocation to
eke out his livelihood. Such relief can be denied only if it is proved that
CM No.14175/2005 in W.P(C) No.10086/2005

Page 5 of 8

the workman is gainfully employed in some establishment and is
receiving adequate and regular remuneration which is not the case with
the applicant. In the present case the petitioner has not been able to
show that the workman is gainfully employed in any establishment and
the respondent no.1 has contended on affidavit that he is unemployed
since the date of his dismissal from the service.

7.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 entitled Town Municipal, Athani v.
P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman has
a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot
be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act for
enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was concerned with
the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the Court would have a
bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well. From a
conspectus of the authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court, the
right of a workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified under
the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the
constitutional mandate and nothing more. It is undoubtedly, the bare
minimum which is required by the workman to subsist and is nothing
more. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean all the wages that
CM No.14175/2005 in W.P(C) No.10086/2005

Page 6 of 8

have fallen due at least from the date of the order of the Labor Court
dismissing the application of the management under Section 33 (2) (b)
of the Act.

8.

For the foregoing reasons the application under Section 17B of

the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is allowed. The petitioner is directed
to pay the last drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher
from 25th July, 2002, the date of the dismissal of the application of the
petitioner management under Section 33(2)(b) of the Act. Arrears of last
drawn wages or the minimum wages be paid within eight weeks. The
petitioner shall continue to pay last drawn wages or minimum wages
whichever is higher by the 15th of every English calendar month during
the pendency of the writ petition. The respondent/workman

is also

directed to give an undertaking to the effect that in case the petition is
allowed, the difference in last drawn wages and the minimum wages
shall be repaid/refunded by the respondent/workman within the time
as shall be permitted by this Court. The undertaking be filed by the
respondent/workman within four weeks.

With these directions, the application is disposed of.
