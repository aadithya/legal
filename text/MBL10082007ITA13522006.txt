with the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation for supply of cold
process retreading plant and retreading material for retreading the old
tyres of the buses of the Corporation.
2.

Some disputes arose between the Assessee and the

Corporation with the result that they were referred to the Chairman of
the Corporation for arbitration.
3.

On 4th April, 1997, the Chairman gave his Award but since

that was not acceptable to the Assessee, objections were filed under
Sections 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 before the District
Judge, Jaipur.
4.

By an order dated 22nd November, 1999, the District Judge

dismissed the objections and the Award was made a rule of the Court.
5.

According to the Assessee, a contingent liability had arisen

on 4th April, 1997 (the date of the Award) and on this basis, a claim of
deduction was made by the Assessee. This was not accepted by the
Assessing Officer who held that the liability arose on the date when the
Award was made a rule of the Court, that is, 22nd November, 1999.
6.

The view taken by the Assessing Officer was reversed by the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) who held that the liability had

accrued on 4th April, 1997.
7.

In further appeal, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal

accepted the view of the Assessing Officer.
8.

On these broad facts, we are of the view that a substantial

question of law arises for consideration. Accordingly, we admit this
appeal and frame the following substantial question of law:
“Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case,
the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was correct in law in
holding that it is the date on which the Award was made a
rule of the Court (22nd November, 1999) and not the date of
the Award (4th April, 1997) that should be taken into
consideration for the accrual of the liability of the Assessee
to the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation for the
purpose of Section 37(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961?”
9.

Filing of the paper books is dispensed with.
