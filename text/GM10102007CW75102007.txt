1.

Issue notice to the respondents to show cause as

to why rule nisi be not issued.
Mr. Amit K. Paul, Advocate accepts notice on
behalf of the MCD and submits that this writ petition
can be heard based on the pleadings placed by the

WP (C) No.7510/2007

Page No.1

petitioner before this court and disposed of at this
stage itself.
Accordingly, with the consent of all parties, this
petition is heard.
2.

The writ petition has been filed by the petitioner

aggrieved by the permission given by the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi for conduct of Ramleela in Indira
Park located at Jwala Nagar, Shahdara, Delhi - 110
032.

The writ petitioner has sought a prohibition

against the respondent no.5 from conducting and
celebrating Ramleela in this park from 12th October,
2007 to 22nd October, 2007.
Mr. Amit K. Paul, learned counsel for the MCD,
submits that Ramleela has been conducted for the last
10 years in the same park.

However, Mr. Juneja,

learned counsel for the petitioner, submits that earlier
the land was a barren land which had not been
developed as a park.
3.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has very fairly

submitted that the petitioner is aggrieved mainly by
the fact that the conduct of functions would destroy
the horticulture and other development undertaken by

WP (C) No.7510/2007

Page No.2

the respondent no.1 in this park. It is submitted that
the park was earlier encroached and it was only on
account of vigilance of the residents who approached
this court by way of earlier writ petition being WP (C)
No.5729/2002 that the encroachment and garbage in
this area had been removed and the beautification of
the park has been undertaken.
Certainly, the apprehensions of the petitioner
deserve to be considered by the respondents as the
same are in public interest. While the conduct of an
annual event as Ramleela may also be in community
interest, it is equally important that the environment
is not permitted to be destroyed by any function
conducted by any person or authority.
4.

Accordingly, interest of both parties can be

adequately protected if the respondents ensure that
no

damage

results

to

either

the

horticultural

development of the park or any other development
activity which has been undertaken by the respondent
no.1 in the subject park. While the MCD is statutorily
enjoined

to

develop

and

maintain

such

parks,

however, inasmuch as development has already been

WP (C) No.7510/2007

Page No.3

undertaken, it shall be the responsibility of the
respondent no.5 while holding its functions to ensure
that there is no damage or destruction of the park in
any manner.
5.

Having regard to the fact that several writ

petitions raising similar issues have been brought to
this court and the MCD is unable to enforce directions
to ensure that no destruction results of the greenery,
the MCD may consider levy of appropriate charges
towards this end as well as towards the expenses
incurred on removal of garbage, if any, as well as
taking guarantees at the stage of giving permission
itself.
This writ petition and application are disposed of
in the above terms.
Dasti.
