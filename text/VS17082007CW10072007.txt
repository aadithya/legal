1.

This petition is filed against order dated 18th January,

Officer. There are various persons against whom the Recovery
Certificates have been issued including the petitioner herein.
Property of the petitioner at Ballabgard was mortgaged with the
respondent no.1/Bank and therefore respondent no. 1/Bank has
applied for sale of the said property. When the matter was listed
on 12th January, 2007, the valuation report in respect of this
property was filed by the Bank and the Recovery Officer
adjourned the matter to 18th January, 2007 at 2.00 PM for
settling the sale terms.
2.

On 18th January, 2007, petitioner did not appear and

in these circumstances, the Recovery Officer passed the sale
proclamation order fixing the reserve price of Rs. 7.73 lakhs. For
their non-appearance, a show-cause notice for arrest was issued
to the petitioner herein.
3.

In this petition, petitioner alleges that because of

traffic chaos on that day, the lawyers and litigants were
prevented from reaching the Tribunal and it is because of this
reason that the petitioner could not appear in the Court.

Later

on when he enquired about the case, he was informed that the
matter is adjourned to 8th February, 2007. However, he came to
know that the matter was taken up at 3.00 PM and aforesaid
order passed.

Bank has filed their counter affidavit refuting the

aforesaid stand taken by the petitioner. It is submitted that the
case was fixed after lunch, i.e., at 2.00 PM when there was no
such traffic problem and many persons attended the hearing in
this case itself which is a proof enough to support the contention
of the Bank that the lawyers and litigants were not prevented
from appearing in the Court.
5.

Be that as it may, since the petitioner has appeared

and undertakes that he shall appear before the Recovery Officer
on the next date as well as on subsequent dates fixed by the
Recovery Officer, the order to the extent of issuing show-cause
notice for arrest against the petitioner is hereby set aside.
6.

Petitioner shall appear before the Recovery Officer on

5th September, 2007 when the Recovery Officer shall proceed
further in the matter.
7.

Petition stands disposed of in view of the aforesaid.

8.

Dasti to learned counsel for both the parties.
