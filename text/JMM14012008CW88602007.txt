1.
The petitioner was enrolled in the Army as a Clerk(GD) on
30.03.1982. He got promotion from time to time and at present
WP(C) No.8860/2007

he holds the rank of Naib Subedar. The question with which we
are concerned in this writ petition is regarding the extension of
service by two years, which the petitioner would normally be
entitled to on attaining the rank of Naib Subedar. This extension
of two years is due w.e.f. 01.04.2008 and if the petitioner is given
this extension he would continue in service till 31.03.2010.
2.

The respondents have the policy for giving such extensions

which is contained in policy letter no. B/33098/AG/PS 2(C) dt.
21.09.1998 which has been amended from time to time. In the
policy letter dated 21.09.1998 as it originally stood, procedure
and criteria for screening of the officers in the Army for extension
is laid down. It enumerates certain offences and stipulates that if
an officer is convicted of any of those offences then he would be
debarred for extension. The petitioner overstayed one

day's

leave, about 26 years ago, when he was working as recruit and
was undergoing training.

He was given red ink entry for that.

Taking that red ink entry into consideration, the respondents
chose not to grant two years extension of service to the
petitioner.

The

discharge

order

dated

08.03.2007

was

accordingly issued stating that the petitioner shall be discharged
from service on 31.03.2008.
WP(C) No.8860/2007

However, much before the said
Page 2 of 7

order could be effectuated which has not been effected till date as
31.03.2008 is yet to approach.

The respondents themselves

clarified their policy dated 21.09.1998 by issuing letter dated
13.06.2007. The relevant paras of this letter read as under :“2.

As per the existing policy, a JCO who has been

convicted any time during his entire service for an
offence under AA Sec 39(a), (b) and AA Sec 45 is
permanently debarred for two years extn of service.
The same was clarified vide letter of even No dated 22 nd
Nov 2005. The aspect has been reviewed and details
are explained in succeeding paragraphs.
3.

As per the revised policy, JCOs who are convicted

under these offences during service as JCOs only will be
debarred for extn.

Thus any conviction in the lower

rank under the above mentioned offences will not debar
an extn in the rank of the JCO provided other requisite
criteria are met. In view of this change note under Ser
No 8 (a), (b) and Ser No. 14 of Annexure to Appendix 'A'
of the letter dt. 21 Sep 98 is amended as under :For : Ser 8 (a) Sec 39 (a) - Absence without

3.

Perusal

of

the

aforesaid

clarification

would

clearly

demonstrate that if red entry was given on account of absence
without leave during the service as JCOs, only in that eventuality
the incumbent could be debarred for extension.

It is common

case of the parties that since petitioner was given this entry while
he was a recruit and he has not been punished for any such
offence as JCO, he would, as per the aforesaid clarification dated
13.06.2007 be entitled to extension. However, the respondents
rely upon para 4 of the said letter as extracted above as per
WP(C) No.8860/2007

Page 4 of 7

which the past cases are not to be reopened. According to the
respondents since in the case of the petitioner discharge order
dated 08.03.2007 has already been passed, the petitioner shall
not be entitled to the benefit of the aforesaid clarification.
4.

We are unable to accept this submission of the respondents.

The purpose and objective behind this letter dated 13.06.2007 is
more than obvious.

It is to erase and wipe out the harshness

which the original policy dated 21.09.1998 would entail in those
cases where the conduct for which a particular officer was
punished was not very serious and the act was committed long
time ago. Applying this criteria in the case of the petitioner itself
the purpose stands truly demonstrated. As pointed above, the
petitioner was given red entry more that 26 years ago when he
was only a recruit. The misconduct was overstaying leave by one
day. This act thereafter did not hinder the career progression of
the petitioner who kept on getting further promotions from time
to time and at present he is working as JCO. It is for this reason
the clarification given vide letter dated 13.06.2007 explains that
only if such a conduct is in the post as JCO, it would debar the
concerned official for extension. Once this is the objective of the
clarification given and the provision is of beneficial nature, the
WP(C) No.8860/2007

Page 5 of 7

true interpretation of para no. 4 would be to restrict the
applicability to only those cases where the discharge order has
already come into effect and the official is eased out from the
service. It would not apply to cases where the discharge order is
merely passed which is to take effect from a future date and that
date happens to be after 13.06.2007. It is a matter of common
knowledge that such discharge orders are generally passed in
advance so that the necessary formalities for computation of
pension and other retirement benefits are completed in time and
the incumbent is given those benefits on the date of retirement.
That would not mean that the discharge order became effective
on the date when it was issued.

We are therefore of the opinion

that the case of the petitioner was not governed by para no. 4
and cannot be treated as a past case which required to be
reopened as the petitioner was yet to retire from service. Since
otherwise, the petitioner would be entitled to extension as he
does not suffer from any debarment, we allow this writ petition
and direct the respondents to consider the case of the petitioner
in terms of aforesaid policy dated 21.09.1998 read with the
clarification dated 13.06.2007. This exercise shall be done within
one month from today.
