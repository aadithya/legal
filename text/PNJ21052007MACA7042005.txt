PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
Appellant Insurance Company challenges the award

dated 11.7.2005.
2.

Deceased Lalit Batra died at a road accident on

4.10.2001 stated to be caused by rash and negligent driving by

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.1 of 17

driver of car bearing No. UMU-707.

He was survived by his

wife, two minor children and mother.
3.

Dependents who are respondents No.1 to 4 filed a

claim petition under Section 166 read with Section 140 of the
Motor Vehicles Act 1988 claiming compensation on account of
the death of the deceased.
4.

As per the claimants the accident in question took

place when deceased was traveling from Muzzafar Nagar
towards Saharanpur in his Indica car bearing No.DL-3CR-0222.
It was pleaded that the deceased was driving his car within
permissible limits.

That at the time of the accident i.e. 8.30

p.m. a tractor with a trailer bearing no.UST-6390 was plying
ahead of the car of the deceased while car bearing No.UMU707, Maruti make (800 CC) being driven by respondent No.6,
Shri Pawan Kumar, was plying behind the car of the deceased.
That as the driver of the tractor slowed down after giving an
indication to said effect, the deceased de-accelerated his car
after giving an indication to said effect. But, since respondent
No.6 was driving his car in a rash and negligent manner, he
failed to notice the slowing down of the car by the deceased
and, therefore, rammed into the car of the deceased from the

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.2 of 17

rear.

So great was the the impact that the

car of the

deceased, in turn, banged into the trailer of the tractor.

The

deceased suffered grievous injuries and died at the spot.
5.

Respondent No.6 and

his wife who owned the

Maruti car bearing No.UMU-707 denied that the accident was
caused due to the negligence of

respondent No.6.

They

pleaded that the accident occurred due to the contributory
negligence of the driver of the tractor who, according to them,
had parked the tractor in the middle of the road without giving
any indication. They pleaded that the deceased who was
driving his car at a very high speed and did not see the
stationary tractor trailer and, therefore, collided with the same.
They pleaded that after the car of the deceased collided with
the trailer of the tractor, car driven by respondent No.6 collided
with the car driven by the deceased.
6.

In order to prove their version, claimants being wife,

children and mother of the deceased examined one Ravi
Bhandari as PW-3 who claimed to be an eye witness to the
accident.
7.

Respondent No.6 and his wife examined respondent

No.6 i.e. Pawan Kumar as RW-1.

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.3 of 17

8.

Apart from the oral testimony of Pawan Kumar, they

proved 8 photographs together with the negatives (Ex.RW-1/1 to
Ex.RW-1/8)

evidencing the position of the tractor trailer, car

driven by the deceased and the car driven by the respondent
No.6 in an accidental condition.
9.

Holding that Ravi Bhandari was an eye witness to the

accident, the Tribunal believed his version as deposed to by him
pertaining to the accident to the effect that the car driven by
respondent No.6 rammed into the car of the deceased and this
triggered the accident

i.e. the car of the deceased, in turn,

rammed into the trailer behind the tractor.

So holding , the

Tribunal discussed the evidence pertaining to the income of the
deceased. Noting that he was engaged in electronics business
and with reference to his income tax returns Ex.PW-2/1-3 held
that the income of the deceased was Rs.1,14,443/- per annum.
Doubling the income on the presumption that the income would
have arisen by the time the deceased would have stopped
earning,

noting that the deceased was aged 35 years, mean

average annual income of the deceased was determined as
Rs.1,79,664/-.

Deducting 1/3rd

as the presumed personal

expenses of the deceased, loss of dependence determined

is

Rs.1,14,443/- per
MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.4 of 17

annum.

Applying the multiplier 17, loss of dependence

determined is Rs.19,45,531/-. Rs.15,000/- has been awarded
towards funeral expenses and Rs.50,000/- towards loss of
consortium, total sum awarded is Rs.20,10,531/-.
10.

Learned

counsel

for

the

appellant

insurance

company has challenged the finding of the Tribunal pertaining
to the manner in which the accident took place as also in
relation to the mean average income determined as also the
multiplier adopted.
11.

With reference to the photographs Ex.RW-1/1 to

Ex.RW-1/8 and the testimony of PW-3 as also the testimony of
RW-1, counsel urged that it is apparent that the deceased
rammed into the trailer of the tractor and this was the cause of
his death. No doubt, car driven by respondent No.6 did hit the
car driven by the deceased, but said hit was not fatal.

With

reference to the income of the deceased, counsel urged that
there was no evidence of future prospects and, therefore,
submitted that the Tribunal could not have doubled the existing
income.

In relation to the multiplier adopted, counsel urged

that keeping in view the age of the deceased being 42 years,

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.5 of 17

wrongly treated to be 35 years by the Tribunal, appropriate
multiplier applicable was 10.

Counsel further urged that even

in respect of the existing income as per Ex.PW-2/1, income tax
payable had to be deducted as said amount was not available
to the family.
12.

Before dealing with the main controversy i.e.

the

manner in which the accident took place, I may note that as
per Ex.PW-2/1 to Ex.PW-2/3, being the income tax returns
pertaining to the income of the deceased for the assessment
years 2000-01, 2001-02 and 2002-03, date of birth stated is
3.5.1959.

The accident took place on 4.10.2001. Thus, the

deceased was aged 42 years and 5 months when he died and
not 35 years as wrongly assumed by the Tribunal.

The three

returns further reveal that for the assessment year 2000-01,
deceased paid tax in sum of Rs.7,000/- i.e. had a net income
of approximately Rs.1,07,000/-.

For the assessment year

2001-02, after deducting income tax paid, net income comes
to approximately Rs.1,10,000/-. For the assessment year 200203, the professional income is Rs.39,141/-.

I may note that

the income shown in the last return is less for the reason, the
deceased died in the month of October,2001.

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Thus, the

Page No.6 of 17

income was only for approximately 6 months.
13.

As per PW-3, Ravi Bhandari, describing the accident,

he stated as under :“I do not remember the date, it was early October
2001. About 8-9 p.m. I was going from Muzzafar
Nagar towards Saharanpur in my own car. The
accident happened in front of me nearly. In my
opposite direction one tractor trolley was coming
followed by an Indica car which was followed by a
Maruti car. The tractor trolley slowed down and
indica also slowed down, thereafter the maruti car
collided against the rear portion of indica car. Due
to this the indica car got sandwiched between the
tractor trolley and maruti car. I cannot tell the
approx. speed of maruti car. After the accident I left
from the spot.
Subsequently I came to know that one of the
occupants of Indica car, who had died was brother of
one of my acquaintance. Police never recorded my
statement nor I myself went to them.”
14.

I note that while discussing the testimony of Ravi

Bhandari, even the learned Tribunal has commented upon the
same with a pinch of salt as under:-

15.

“I am conscious that the eye witness account of
the accident, as deposed by PW-3 lacks the
necessary particulars. But it cannot be ignored that
petitioners before me, the two widows and two
minor children, could have no control over the eye
witness. It is not uncommon that a stranger to an
accident would not bother to remember the minute
details of the accident including date and
registration number of the vehicles.”
Unfortunately, the Tribunal has been swayed by

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.7 of 17

emotions evidenced by the expression used by the Tribunal
that it cannot ignore that he had before him two widows and
two minor children.
16.

A factor which has weighed with the Tribunal

against the respondents is that they did not examine any eye
witness.

As regards the testimony of RW-1 i.e. Pawan Kumar,

the driver of the Maruti car, learned Tribunal has brushed aside
his testimony stating that he was an interested witness.
17.

As regards the first reason i.e. not examining any

eye

witness, the Tribunal lost sight of the fact that the

accident took place at about 8.30 P.M. i.e. in the night on a
highway. Thus, there was every probability that there was no
eye witness to the accident.
18.

As regards the second reason, suffice would it be to

note that the driver of the offending vehicle

has to be ignored on said ground alone.

If the

19.

Men may lie, but circumstances do not lie.

20.

Photographs, Ex.RW-1/1 to Ex.RW-1/8 throws light

on the manner in which the accident in question took place.
21.

Photographs Ex.RW-1/1 and Ex.RW-1/4 show that

the left rear tyre of the tractor is punctured and that the tractor

middle of the road.
grade or sand.

The trailer is loaded with either stone

Photograph Ex.RW-1/3 and Ex.RW-1/4 show

that the Indica car being driven by the deceased has smashed
into the rear of the trailer.

The engine of the car is totally

smashed and the rear end of the trailer is touching the wind
screen of the car. Ex.RW-1/3 evidences that the body of the
trailer is not parallel to the road. It has an upward incline viz-aviz the road. Probably for said reason, the engine portion of
the Indica car has protruded underneath the trailer. Ex.RW-1/6
and Ex.RW-1/7 show the accidental position of the Maruti car
and the Indica car. The damage to the rear end of the Indica
car and the front portion of the Maruti car show that the body
of the two cars has been dented.

The front bumper of the

Maruti car and the rear bumper of the Indica car have not got

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.9 of 17

displaced, meaning thereby that the impact due to collision of
the two cars is minimal. Further, the Maruti car has not hit the
Indica car, head on i.e. with full impact of the Maruti car on to
the Indica car for the reason only about 2 feet front portion of
the Maruti car, towards its left side has hit the Indica car
towards the right rear side of the Indica car spanning a
distance of 2 feet rear portion of the Indica car.
22.

The loaded tractor trailer is an indication of its

weight. Thus, when the Indica car rammed into the stationary
tractor trailer it is obvious that it hit a weighty object which
was stationary.

The Indica car was in momentum.

The

damage to the Indica car indicates that the principal cause of
the death of the deceased was when he rammed his car into
the tractor trailer. The photographs belie the testimony of PW3 that he saw the tractor trailer slowing down and as a
consequence the deceased also slowing down, but the driver of
the Maruti car not doing so and hence responsible for the
accident. The photographs evidencing the accidental position
of the three vehicles support the version of RW-1, Sh. Pawan
Kumar who was driving the Maruti car.
23.

With a little understanding and application of the

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.10 of 17

laws of physics, the photographs Ex.RW-1/1 to Ex. RW-1/8
reveal a lot. Weight of an Indica car is slightly more than that
of a Maruti 800 car. The accidental condition of the two cars
belies that due to the Maruti car hitting the Indica car, the later
was pushed into the rear side of the tractor trailer with such
impact that the engine portion of the Indica car got totally
smashed and damaged right up to the wind screen of the
Indica car.
24.

An analysis of the above photographs establishes

that car of the deceased first collided with the stationary
tractor and thereafter car bearing No.UMU-707 collided with
the car of the deceased.
25.

In these circumstances, I hold the driver of the

tractor principally responsible for the accident for the reason,
he had parked the tractor in the middle of the road without
giving any indication. Secondary blame is that of the deceased
who failed to notice the stationary tractor trailer on the road
and hit the same with great momentum. Least blame worthy
conduct is that of the driver of the Maruti Car.
26.

It is not a case of composite negligence. It is a case

of contributory negligence. I apportion the blame 50% on the

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.11 of 17

driver of the tractor trailer, 30% on the deceased and 20% on
RW-1.
27.

On the issue of compensation, I note that Tribunal

has awarded compensation in sum of Rs.20,10,531/- to the
dependents of the deceased.
28.

Deceased was survived by his wife, two minor

children and mother.
29.

I note that deceased was a businessman. He was

running a business of manufacturing and trading electronic
goods under the name and style of “Batbro Electronics”.
Noting income tax return Ex.PW-2/1, Tribunal has determined
income of the deceased at the time of the accident at
Rs.1,14,443/- per annum. Giving benefit of futuristic income,
Tribunal has taken mean average income of the deceased as
Rs.1,71,664/-. Deducting 1/3rd towards the personal spending
of the deceased, loss of dependence has been determined by
the Tribunal at Rs.1,14,443/- per annum.
30.

Applying the multiplier 17, Tribunal has determined

loss of dependence and awarding conventional damages, total
award is in sum of Rs.20,10,531/-.
31.

For the reasons noted in para 12 above, finding by

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.12 of 17

the Tribunal that the deceased was aged 35 years is incorrect.
The deceased was aged 42 years and 5 months.
32.

Learned

counsel

for

the

appellant

insurance

company submitted that there was no evidence of future
prospects and therefore, Tribunal could not have doubled the
existing income of the deceased. In support of his contention,
learned counsel relied upon judgment of the Supreme Court in
the decision reported as Bijoy Kumar Dugar Vs. Bidyadhar
Dutta & Ors. AIR 2006 SC 1255.
33.

In the para 7 of the aforenoted decision, Supreme

Court has observed as under:-

34.

“7. The mere assertion of the claimants that the
deceased would have earned more than Rs.8000/to Rs.10,000/- per month in the span of his life time
cannot be accepted as legitimate income unless all
the relevant facts are proved by leading cogent and
reliable evidence before the MACT. Claimants had
to prove that the deceased was in a trade where he
would have earned more from time to time or that
he had special merits or qualifications or
opportunities which would have led to an
improvement in his income. There was no evidence
produced on record by the claimants regarding
future prospects of increase of income in the course
of employment or business or profession. Thus, the
MACT
had
awarded
just
and
reasonable
compensation to the claimants.”
Therefore, in order to get benefit of futuristic

income, claimants are required to place on record the evidence

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.13 of 17

establishing the future income of the deceased.
35.

In the instant case, in relation to income of the

deceased, 3 income tax returns i.e. Ex.PW-2/1 to Ex.PW-2/3
have been filed.

Income tax return Ex.PW-2/1 shows that

deceased

gross

had

a

income

of

Rs.1,14,443/-

in

the

assessment year 2000-01. Income tax return Ex.PW-2/2 shows
that deceased had a gross income of Rs.1,24,564/- in the
assessment year 2001-02. For the assessment year 2002-03,
the income of the deceased is Rs.39,141/- as per income tax
return Ex.PW-2/3. I may note that the income shown in the last
return is less for the reason, the deceased died in the month of
October.

The aforenoted returns establishes that income of

the deceased was gradually increasing.

Deceased was aged

42 years as on the date of the accident. It could reasonably be
expected that had he been alive, he would have worked till the
age of 60 years. I therefore concur with learned Tribunal that
salary of the deceased would have doubled by the time he
would have left gainful employment.
36.

After taking mean average income of the deceased

and deducting 1/3rd for the personal spending of the
deceased, Tribunal has determined loss of dependence at

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.14 of 17

Rs.1,14,443/- p.a. I adopt the said figure as the loss of
dependence.

However, Tribunal has erred in applying

multiplier of 17.
37.

Noting that since deceased was aged 42 years at

the time of the accident, I consider multiplier of 11 as
appropriate. In so holding, I note following judgments of the
Supreme Court :“1. Tamilnadu State Road Transport Corp. Ltd. Vs.
S.Rajapriya & Ors. AIR 2005 SC 2985: Supreme Court
applied a multiplier of 12 in case of deceased aged
38 years.
2.
The Managing Director, TNSTC Ltd. Vs.
K.I.BIndu & Ors. 2006 ACJ 423: Supreme Court
applied a multiplier of 13 in case of a deceased aged
34 years.
3.
U.P.State Road Transport Co. Vs. Krishna Bala
& Ors. 2006 ACJ. 2114: Supreme Court applied a
multiplier of 13 in case of deceased aged 36 years.
4.
The Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay
Vs. Sh. Laxman Iyer & Anr. 2004 ACJ 53: Supreme
Court applied a multiplier of 12 noting the age of the
parents who were aged 47 years and 43 years
respectively, Deceased was aged 18 years.
5.
New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Kalpana &
Ors. 2007 (2) SCALE 227: Supreme Court applied a
multiplier of 13 in case of a deceased aged 33 years.
6.
The Managing Director, TNSTC Vs. Sripriya &
Ors. Civil Appeal No.1200/2007 decided on 8.3.2007:
Supreme Court applied a multiplier of 12 in case of a
deceased aged 37 years.”
MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.15 of 17

38.

On the multiplier of 11 and maintaining the non-

pecuniary loses as worked out by the Tribunal, the total
compensation comes to Rs.13,23,873/-.
39.

A fact needs to be noted. For unexplainable reasons

the claimants, in spite of repeated opportunities granted by the
Tribunal, failed to implead the driver, owner and the insurer of
the tractor as a party in the claim petition.

Unfortunately, I

cannot pass any award against the said three parties.
40.

As respondent no.1 has been held blame worthy

only to the extent of 20%, said respondent, his wife who owned
the Maruti Car and the insurance company are thus jointly and
severally liable to the extent of only 20%.

Thus, I hold that

they are liable to pay to the claimants only Rs.2,64,774/-. The
said amount would be payable from the date of the claim
petition till it was received by the claimants at the rate of
interest awarded by the Tribunal.
41.

Vide interim order dated 24.8.2005, appellant was

directed to deposit 50% of the sum awarded which was
permitted to be withdrawn by the claimants subject to
furnishing security. Since amount has become refundable to
the appellant i.e. the insurance company, I hold that the

MAC.APP.No.704/2005

Page No.16 of 17

insurance company would be entitled to seek restitution by
moving an application before the Tribunal.
42.

Appeal stands disposed of in terms of para 40

above.
43.

No costs.
