PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (ORAL)

1.

All petitions can be disposed by a common order for

the reason learned counsel for the parties agree that save and
except the cheque number, date of cheque and the amount, each
and every averment in the complaints which are sought to be
quashed in the instant petitions are identical.
2.

Since

matter

was

argued

with

reference

to

Crl.M.C.No.2953/05, complaint forming subject matter of the said
petition may be noted.
3.

But before that it may be recorded that all the

complaints are under Section 138 read with Section 141 of
N.I.Act. The complainant is National Small Industries Corporation
Ltd.

Accused No.1 is M/s Jay Rapid Rollers Ltd. It is a company

registered under the Companies Act.

Accused No.2, Sukhbir

Singh is stated to be the Managing Director of accused No.1.
Accused No.3 is the petitioner, stated to be the Director of
accused No.1.
4.

The complaint is short and cryptic.

It may be

reproduced verbatim.
“1. That the complainant firm is a Govt. of
India Enterprises having its office at NSIC
Bhawan, Okhla Industrial Estate, New Delhi
and Sh.Satender Kumar, Development Officer
(Law) has been authorized to file the complaint
vide power of attorney dated 03.09.2002.
2.
That the accused persons approached the
complainant for financing of bill integrated
market support programme. The complainant
extended the bill financing facility to the
accused.
3.
That the accused issued cheques and
same were dishonoured and the complainant
company filed cases against the accused
persons and they were summoned under
Section 138 N.I.Act by the Hon'ble Court.

4.
That during the proceedings a settlement
was arrived at. The accused persons accepted
the liability of Rs.75,68,920/- and against that
liability accused persons issued cheque
No.809235 dated 15.4.2003 for Rs.2 lacs as
part payment, drawn on State Bank of India,
Pusa Road, Shopping Complex, Rajendra Place,
New Delhi. Copy of letter dated 03.06.2000
issued by accused persons enclosed herewith.
5.
That the above said cheque was
presented by the complainant to their banker
Punjab National Bank, Okhla Industrial Estate,
New Delhi but the same was returned unpaid
with the remarks “INSUFFICIENT FUNDS” vide
memo dated 19.4.2003 of the bank of accused.
6.
That the complainant issued notice dated
24.4.2003 dispatched on 24.4.2003 under
Regd. A.D. and under UPC cover. The Regd.
And UPC envelopes addressed to the accused
No.2 and 3 has been received back with the
remarks 'refused' and the other were duly
served upon the accused by UPC as well as by
Registry, but the payment has not been
received by the complainant company within
15 days. The returned registry envelope (2
nos.) are enclosed herewith.
7.
That the accused No.1 is a company duly
registered under the Companies Act.
8.
That the accused No.1 is the Managing
Director and accused No.3 is the Director of the
accused company. The accused No.2 and 3
are the in-charge and responsible for the
conduct of the business of the company
accused No.1 and hence are liable for the
offences.
9.
That the complainant office is situated in
Delhi, the payment was received at Delhi and
the cheques were presented to banker in

Delhi, hence this Hon'ble Court
jurisdiction to decide the matter.

has

got

10. That the complaint is within limitation of
one month prescribed under the N.I.Act.
11. That the accused have rented themselves
liable to be prosecuted under the N.I.Act.
12. That the complainant is a Govt. of India
undertaking and the complainant be exempted
from pre-summoning evidence.
It is therefore, most respectfully and in the
interest of justice prayed that the accused
persons be summoned and punished under
Section 138/141/142 N.I.Act.

5.

It is further prayed that the amount realized as
fine be paid to the complainant.”
It is conceded by learned counsel for NSIC, the

complainant that though in para 4 of the compliant it is stated
that the accused persons issued the cheque in question but as a
matter of fact the cheque in question was issued only under the
signatures of accused No.2.
6.

Perusal of the complaint shows that only averment

against the petitioner is in para 8 of the complaint wherein it is
stated that he along with accused No.1 was in-charge and
responsible for the conduct of the business of the company and
hence, is liable for the offence committed by accused No.1.
7.

Question arises, whether said averment is sufficient to

make petitioner liable for the offence committed by the company.

Needless to state, offence is under Section 138 of N.I.Act.
8.

I need not expand on the issue save and except note

two decisions of the Supreme Court reported as JT 2007 (2) SC
233, Saroj Kumar Poddar Vs. State (NCT of Delhi & Anr.) and AIR
2007 SC 1454, N.K.Wahi Vs. Shekhar Singh & Ors.
9.

In para 14 of the report in Saroj Kumar Poddar's case,

Supreme Court has observed as under :-

10.

“14.
Apart from the company and the
appellant, as noticed hereinbefore
the
Managing Director
and all other Directors
were also made accused. The appellant did
not issue any cheque.
He, as noticed
hereinbefore,
had
resigned
from
the
Directorship of the company. It may be true
that as to exactly on what date the said
resignation was accepted by the Company is
not known, but, even otherwise, there is no
averment in the complaint petitions as to how
and in what manner the appellant was
responsible for the conduct of the business of
the company or otherwise responsible to it in
regard to its functioning. He had not issued
any cheque. How he is responsible for
dishonour of the cheque has not been stated.
The allegations made in paragraph 3, thus, in
our opinion do not satisfy the requirements of
Section 141 of the Act.”
In para 8 of the decision in N.K.Wahi's case, Supreme

Court observed as under :“8. To launch a prosecution, therefore,
against the alleged Directors there must be a
specific allegation in the complaint as to the
part played by them in the transaction. There
should be clear and unambiguous allegation as

11.

to
how the Directors are
incharge and
responsible for the conduct of the business of
the company. The description should be clear.
It is true that precise
words
from the
provisions of the Act need not be reproduced
and the court can always come to a conclusion
in facts of each case. But still in the absence of
any averment or specific evidence the net
result would be that complaint would not be
entertainable.”
Decision in N.K.Wahi's case delivered by the Supreme

Court affirmed the decision of a learned Single Judge of this Court
reported as 102 (2003) DLT 297 Shekhar Singh Vs. N.K.Wahi.
Since it was urged by learned counsel for the respondent that
decision of the Supreme Court in

N.K.Wahi's case has not

specifically noted as to what was the assertion in the complaint
which was being considered, I have thought it relevant to refer to
the decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court which was
upheld by the Supreme Court for the reason, in para 14 of the
report,

the

learned

Single

Judge

has

noted

the

assertions/averments in the complaint. Learned Single Judge has
noted that the only averment against N.K.Wahi was that he was a
Director of the company and was responsible for the business of
the company.
12.

I may note that the petitioner claims to have resigned

as a Director of accused No.1 on 27.9.1996, but since this issue
may need evidence I eschew any discussion thereon.

13.

In view of the clear enunciation of law on the subject

by the Supreme Court, the petitions are allowed.

Summoning

orders which are challenged in each petition are also quashed.
The complaints are quashed but viz-a-viz the petitioner Harmeet
Singh Paintal.
13.

No costs.
