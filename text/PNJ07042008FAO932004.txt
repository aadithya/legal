PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Heard learned counsel for the parties.

2.

Two contentions are urged by the appellant in

appeal.

It is firstly urged that the decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court dated 6.11.1996 in Civil Appeal No.1690406/1996 New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. V.KNeelakandan was
overruled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision
reported as 2000 ACJ 5 KSEB Vs. Valsala K.

FAO 93/04

Accordingly,

page 1 of 4

counsel urges that the monthly income of the deceased had to
be kept at Rs.2,000/- being the amount stipulated under
Section 4A of the Workmen's Compensation Act 1923 as on the
date of the accident i.e. 13.10.2000.
3.

The second contention urged is that under Section

4A (3) liability qua the penalty levied cannot be fastened on
the insurance company.
4.

Happily for me, learned counsel for the respondent

concedes to both points urged by learned counsel for the
appellant. Thus I am not called upon to pen down a lengthy
judgment.
5.

Suffice would it be to note that a 4 Judge Bench of

the Hon'ble Supreme Court, vide decision reported as AIR 1976
SC 222 Pratap Narayan Singh Deo Vs. Sriniwas Sabata & Anr.
held that liability to pay arises on the date of the accident and
the statutory provisions in force as on date of accident would
determine the compensation to be paid.
6.

A 2 Judge Bench in Neelakandan's case held to the

contrary, but unfortunately, decision of the 4 Judge Bench in
Pratap Narayan Singh Deo's case was not considered. Hon'ble
Supreme Court revisited the law in Valsala's case (supra) and
clarified that the correct law to be applied would be as
declared
FAO 93/04

in

Pratap Narayan Singh Deo's

case.

Meaning
page 2 of 4

thereby, the computation has to be with reference to income
and limits thereof stipulated under Section 4A as on date of the
accident.
7.

Noting the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

reported as Ved Prakash Garg Vs. Premi Devi & Ors. 1998 (1)
ACJ in FAO No.317/2004 M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs.
Smt. Leela Devi & Ors. decided on 23.11.2007 it has been held
that liability to pay the penalty cannot be fastened on the
insurance company and had to be that of the employer.
8.

The appeal is accordingly allowed with respect to

the first two points.

The effect thereof would be that the

compensation held payable stands reduced from Rs.3,94,120/to Rs.1,97,060/-.
9.

This would be the amount payable by the insurance

company apart from interest.
10.

I also declare that the insurance company would not

be liable to pay the penalty. The same would be the liability of
the employer.

For benefit of the Commissioner Workmen's

Compensation I would be failing if I do not record that
consequent to the present order would be a correction in the
50% penalty which also would require to be halved as and
when the same is sought to be recovered in execution
proceedings initiated by the claimants.
