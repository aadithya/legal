PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
Petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 3.2.2007

as also the order dated 17.4.2007 passed by the learned Trial
Judge.
2.

Being defendant petitioner was proceeded ex-parte

and suffered an ex-parte decree on 5.5.2006.

He filed an

application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC on 19.8.2006 praying
that for the reasons stated in the application the ex-parte
Page 1 of 5
decree be set aside.

An application under Section 5 of the

Limitation Act was filed accompanying the application under
Order 9 Rule 13

CPC setting out the grounds on which the

appellant wanted to show sufficient cause entitling him to the
setting aside of ex-parte decree.
3.

Vide order dated 13.2.2007 learned Trial Judge

dismissed the application filed by the appellant under Order 9
Rule 13 CPC.

He filed an application for review pointing out

that his application seeking
considered.

delay to be condoned was not

He pointed out that his application under Order 9

Rule 13 CPC was dismissed vide order dated 3.2.2007 on
account of

delay.

He stated that if his application under

Section 5 was allowed, delay in preferring the application under
Order 9 Rule 13 CPC would be condoned and in said
eventuality, he would be entitled to a fair consideration on
merits of his application.

The review application was taken up

along with application filed by the appellant under Section 5 of
the Limitation Act. Both were dismissed vide order dated
17.4.2007.
4.

At first blush it appears that the learned Trial Judge

has apparently committed a technical error pertaining to the
stage at which applications have been decided, but a deeper
look shows that no error has been committed for the reason
page 2 of 5

facts pleaded in the application

under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC

were pari materia with the facts pleaded in the application
under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
5.

Relevant facts as can be culled out from the record

of the learned Trial Judge are that the wife filed a suit seeking
permanent alimony against the appellant. The suit was filed on
9.1.1998.

With great difficulty appellant was served for

1.7.2001. He chose not to appear.

He was proceeded against

ex-parte. He moved an application under Order 9 Rule 7 CPC
which was allowed on 2.4.2003. He was permitted to file his
defence and participate in the proceedings. The suit filed by
the wife came to

be transferred to a different court on

6.11.2004 notifying that the matter would be taken up on
9.11.2004 before the transferee court. When said order was
passed counsel for the appellant

was present.

Meaning

thereby appellants counsel had notice of the date when
transferee court had to hear the matter. But none appeared
before the transferee court with the result that on 2.3.2005 the
transferee court proceeded ex-parte against the appellant. Exparte proceedings continued till decree was passed

on

5.5.2006.
6.

According to the appellant he had lost contact with

his lawyer and for 2 days was in judicial custody. He pleaded

page 3 of 5
that he learnt about his being proceeded against ex-parte only
on 11.8.2006 and that thereafter the application under Order 9
Rule 13 CPC as also Section 5 of the Limitation Act was drafted
and filed.
7.

As

recorded

in

the

orders

which

have

been

challenged, a fact which is borne out from the record of the
learned Trial Judge is that the appellant had inspected the court
record on 27.1.2006. On said date, i.e. 27.1.2006, the matter
had already been adjourned for further hearing on 17.2.2006.
This date was mentioned by the appellant on the inspection
form. Therefrom, the learned Trial Judge has concluded that
the appellant was aware of 17.2.2006 being the next date of
hearing when he inspected the court record on 27.1.2006.
Learned Judge also opined that having inspected the court
record appellant would be in the knowledge of the fact that on
2.3.2005 he was proceeded against ex-parte.

Thus, his

assertion in the 2 applications

about his

that

he

learnt

being proceeded against ex-parte on 11. 8.2006 is not correct.
8.

The inevitable conclusion therefrom would be that

both for purposes of limitation as also showing sufficient cause
for not appearing when decree was passed appellant would
have no case whatsoever.

9.

Thus, I find no infirmity in either order dated

3.2.2007 or in the order dated 17.4.2007.
10.

I clarify that if delay is not to be condoned in filing

application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC I need not even look to
the order dated 3.2.2007.
11.

The appeal is without merits.

12.

It is dismissed.

13.

LCR be returned forthwith.
