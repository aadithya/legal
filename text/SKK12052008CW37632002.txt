The saga of aggrieved persons not being paid the full
reimbursement for medical expenses incurred and thus
being compelled to approach this Court does not seem to
end as the respondents and other authorities continue to
ignore the legal principles settled by this Court in various
pronouncements. The facts of the present case:

WP (C) No.3763 of 2002

Page 1 of 7

2.

The petitioner has been working as a Senior Auditor in
the

Department

of

Deputy

Controller

of

Defence

Accounts (Air Force) and while in service had to undergo
an open heart surgery at the Escorts Heart Institute &
Research Centre Limited, New Delhi (for short ‘Escorts
Hospital’). The petitioner, in fact, sought permission from
the Department for an angiography test as he was
having frequent heart pains and permission was granted
on 26.4.2001. The petitioner went to the Escorts Hospital
on 21.6.2001 when the angiography test was carried out
and the petitioner was advised immediate operation.
The petitioner underwent medical treatment of open
heart surgery after obtaining the due approval from the
Head of the Department vide letter dated 26.4.2001 &
22.6.2001.
3.

The medical expenses of the petitioner were estimated
initially at Rs.2.00 lakh and the petitioner was advanced
a sum of 90 per cent of the said amount (Rs.1,80,000.00
+ Rs.14,400.00 = Rs.1,94,400.00). The total medical bill
raised by the Escorts Hospital, however, came to
Rs.2,65,660.00.

4.

The respondents claim that the amount assessed by the
office was Rs.1,68,160.00 and thus the petitioner had
been given an extra amount of Rs.26,240.00. There was
some further amount also passed and the balance

WP (C) No.3763 of 2002

Page 2 of 7

outstanding due from the petitioner was stated to
Rs.24,940.00.

An order was, thus, passed seeking to

recover the said amount in installments.
5.

The petitioner filed the present writ petition seeking a
direction for compensation of the full amount incurred
towards medical expenses since Escorts Hospital is a
recognized hospital under the CGHS and prayed for a
further relief that the amounts being deducted ought not
to be so deducted. Interim relief was granted in favour of
the petitioner against deductions of the amount which
was confirmed during the pendency of the petition.

6.

In our considered view the matter in issue is no more res
integra in view of the plethora of pronouncements of this
Court dealing with the identical situation where in CGHS
approved hospitals Government servants have availed of
medical facility and the bills, which have been made are
alleged to be more than what is stipulated in the circulars
of the Government of India. The counter affidavit in the
present case only states that the amount calculated by
the respondents is as per the rates approved by the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare vide its letter
No.11022/1/98/CGHS (P) dated 4.9.1998 and thus neither
is the balance amount payable nor is the petitioner
entitled to the relief of restraint of deductions of the
amount.

A similar circular has been discussed in the judgement of
this Court rendered by one of us (Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.)
in Prithvi Nath Chopra Vs. Union of India & Anr. 111
(2004) DLT 190 = 2004 III AD (Delhi) 569. Interestingly,
the defence raised in the said case was also on the basis
of the judgement of the Supreme Court in State of Punjab
& Ors. Vs. Ram Lubhaya Bagga & Ors. (1998) 4 SCC 117,
which is the case referred to in the counter affidavit
(without citation given).

The Apex Court in the said

judgement has observed that there was a right to healthy
life under Articles 21, 41 & 47 of the Constitution of India
but the Government was justified in limiting the facilities
to the extent permitted by its financial resources.

It is

not necessary to discuss all the judgements referred to
therein both of the Apex Court and this Court but the
controversy as noted in paragraph 23 of the judgement
was that whether the petitioner therein was entitled to
reimbursement only at rates specified in the circular of
1996 or as charged by the hospital. It was observed that
the Apex Court had only set out that it may not be
possible to make available unlimited resources for grant
of such medical treatment but it simultaneously emerged
that the circular was not even strictly adhered to in all
cases in view of the observations made in V.K. Gupta Vs.
Union of India & Anr. 97 (2002) DLT 337. In fact, it was
WP (C) No.3763 of 2002

Page 4 of 7

noticed in the said judgement that reimbursement was
being regularly done as per actual expenses and not
restricted to the 1996 circular but the same occurred
only when there were specific directions of the Court. It
was noticed that this was hardly a satisfactory state of
affairs where an aggrieved person had to come to court
every time to get the amount for the medical treatment
released. Incidentally that was also a case of the Escorts
Hospital.
8.

Another factor which emerged from the judgements was
that the Memorandum had a lifetime of two (2) years and
was required to be revised from time to time.

The

revisions did not take place for quite some time which
created its own difficulty in respect of the rates charged
by the hospitals.

An important aspect was that the

procedure followed was such that a petitioner was
compelled to pay charges first and thereafter seek
reimbursement while actually the whole policy had
envisaged that there should be a system of direct billing
by the approved hospitals to the Government since at
times a patient may not have readily the finance to
obtain the treatment. A writ was issued whereby the full
amount was directed to be reimbursed.
9.

In Milap Singh Vs. Union of India & Anr. 2004 V AD (Delhi)
529 once again the issue of a higher rate being charged

WP (C) No.3763 of 2002

Page 5 of 7

by the hospital than the packaged rate came up for
adjudication. Reference was made to Prithvi Nath Chopra
case (supra) and a writ of mandamus was issued once
again directing full reimbursements. The option was left
to the Government to settle the matter with the hospital
in case it was found that any amount was in excess.
10.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has brought to our
notice a Division Bench judgement of this Court in
Randeep Kumar Rana (Sqn. Commander) Vs. Union of
India 2004 IV AD (Delhi) 139 where a direction for full
reimbursement of medical expenses was made in respect
of

the

treatment

at

the

same

Escorts

Hospital

subsequent to the recommendation for the said purpose
and it was observed that if the hospital charges over and
above the packaged rates and the respondents feel that
there is any excess payments, the same is a matter
which ought to be settled between the hospital and the
Government but the petitioner cannot be deprived of the
reimbursement of the same.
11.

The result of the aforesaid is that a writ of mandamus is
issued directing the respondents to pay the full medical
expenses of the petitioner as per the bills raised by the
Escorts Hospital amounting to Rs.2,65,660.00 less (-) the
amount already paid of Rs.1,94,400.00.

The petitioner

should also be given credit for the deductions from salary
WP (C) No.3763 of 2002

Page 6 of 7

made stated to be to the extent of Rs.6,000.00 which
should also be reimbursed to the petitioner. The needful
be done within a maximum period of two (2) months
from today.
12.

The total costs are assessed at Rs.10,000.00 out of which
Rs.5,000.00 should be paid to the petitioner and the
balance of Rs.5,000.00 be deposited with the Delhi High
Court Legal Services Committee in view of the fact that
the

respondents

continue

to

act

contrary

to

the

judgements rendered by this Court and unnecessarily
burden the docket of the Court & causes inconvenience
to its employees/patients.
13.

The petition is allowed in the aforesaid terms.
