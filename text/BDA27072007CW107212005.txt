1.

In this petition, the following two questions arise for

consideration:1)

Whether the Registrar of Trade Marks has the power to
extend the time for filing of the evidence affidavit in support
of an opposition beyond the maximum period of three

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.1 of 21

months prescribed under rule 50 (1) of the Trade Marks
Rules, 2002 ?

2)

Whether the non-filing of the evidence affidavit within the
prescribed time, ipso facto, means that an opposition to a
trade mark application would be deemed to have been
abandoned in terms of the provisions of Rule 50 (2) of the
Trade Marks Rules, 2002 ?

2.

These questions arise in respect of an application for

registration of the trade mark “SUNERGY” in Class-3 filed on behalf of
the petitioner and the opposition to the same filed on behalf of the
respondent No.1. On 14.06.1995, the petitioner (Sunrider Corporation)
filed an application for registration of its trade mark “SUNERGY” in
Class-3. On 21.02.2001, the same was advertised in the Trade Marks
Journal.

The respondent No.1 (Hindustan Lever Limited) filed an

opposition to the same in Form TM-5 on 24.05.2001. The petitioner
filed its counter-statement in Form TM-6 on 14.10.2002. It has been
contended on behalf of the petitioner that under Rule 50 (1) of the Trade
Marks Rules, 2002, evidence by way of affidavit in support of the

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.2 of 21

respondent No.1's opposition ought to have been filed within two months
which was extendable in the aggregate by a further one month.
Accordingly, it is the petitioner's contention that the evidence affidavit
ought to have been filed latest by 13.01.2003, i.e., three months after
14.10.2002.

However, the evidence affidavit was not filed by the

respondent No.1 by that date. In fact, it has not been filed at all. It was
also contended on behalf of the petitioner that under the Trade and
Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (hereinafter referred to as 'the 1958 Act')
and the Trade and Merchandise Marks Rules, 1959 (hereinafter referred
to as 'the 1959 Rules'), no maximum time limit had been prescribed,
whereas under the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as 'the
1999 Act') and the Trade Marks Rules, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as
'the 2002 Rules'), there is a prescribed maximum time limit beyond
which the Registrar cannot extend the time for filing of the evidence
affidavit. It is an admitted position that by virtue of Section 159 of the
1999 Act, all the proceedings pending on the date on which the Act came
into force, i.e., 15.09.2003, would be dealt with under the 1999 Act and
not under the 1958 Act. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent
No.1 that the respondent No.1 was filing applications in Form TM-56 for
extension of time and the last of such applications was filed on

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.3 of 21

10.02.2004. However, it was submitted on behalf of the petitioner that
they had no knowledge of these purported applications and, in any event,
no orders had been passed on the purported TM-56 applications
allegedly filed by the respondent No.1.

3.

On 20.02.2004, the Assistant Registrar passed an order

invoking the provisions of Rule 50 (2) and held that since the evidence
affidavit was not filed by the respondent No.1 within the prescribed time,
the opposition was deemed to have been abandoned. Being aggrieved by
this order, the respondent No.1 filed an appeal before the Intellectual
Property Appellate Board. The appeal filed by the respondent No.1 was
allowed by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board by a judgment and /
or order dated 11.03.2005 and the order dated 22.03.2004 passed by the
Assistant Registrar was set aside and the matter was remanded to the
Registrar for giving an opportunity of hearing to the respondent No.1 as
well as the petitioner and thereafter to pass the orders. The Intellectual
Property Appellate Board passed the said order dated 11.03.2005 in view
of its order passed in the case of Asian Paints Ltd v. Assistant Registrar
and Another in OA/108/2004 wherein the said Appellate Board was of
the view that the Registrar was competent to grant extension of time for

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.4 of 21

filing the evidence affidavit in opposition even beyond the period
indicated in Rule 50. While disposing of the appeal, the Intellectual
Property Appellate Board observed as under:“In conclusion, we have to say that the larger interest
of the society demands that an opportunity be granted
to the applicant to adduce his part of evidence, besides
the opportunity which the Registrar could have granted
to the opponent by exercising his discretionary power.
In this case we find that the operative part of the order
runs into seven lines. A quasi judicial authority should
shun such a practice which is abhorrent to the
principles of natural justice. All the relevant facts of
the case should be brought out in the order and the
reasons for arriving at the conclusion be discussed in
the order.”

4.

Mr S.S. Rana, who appeared on behalf of the petitioner,

contended, with regard to the first question, that the Registrar had no
power to extend time for filing of the evidence affidavit in support of the
opposition beyond the maximum period of three months prescribed under
Rule 50 (1) of the 2002 Rules. For this purpose, he placed reliance on
the provisions of Section 21 (4), 2 (1) (s), Section 157 (vii) of the 1999
Act and Rule 50 of the 2002 Rules. He also placed reliance on the
following decisions:i)

v. Nisar Khan: AIR 2003 SC 1867 ;

Govind Joti Chavare and Others: AIR 1975 SC

Union of India v. M/s Popular Construction Co.,
Respondent: AIR 2001 SC 4010.

On the other hand, Mr Mahabir, who appeared on behalf of

the respondent No.1, submitted that Section 131 of the 1999 Act read
with Rule 105 of the 2002 Rules empowered the Registrar to extend
time. He also placed strong reliance on a decision of a Full Bench of this
court in the case of Hastimal Jain Trading as Oswal Industries v.
Registrar of Trade Marks and Another: 2000 PTC 24 (FB).

6.

Section 21 of the 1999 Act contains provisions in respect of

the opposition to registration. Sub-section (4) of Section 21 reads as
under:-

“(4)
Any evidence upon which the opponent and
the applicant may rely shall be submitted in the
prescribed manner and within the prescribed time
WP(C)10721/05

Page No.6 of 21

to the Registrar, and the Registrar shall give an
opportunity to them to be heard, if they so desire.”
(emphasis supplied)
The crucial expressions used in the aforesaid provision are “in the
prescribed manner” and “within the prescribed time”.

It, therefore,

becomes necessary to examine as to what is meant by the word
“prescribed”. Section 2 (1) (s) defines “prescribed” to mean prescribed
by rules made under the Act. Section 157 of the 1999 Act relates to the
powers of the Central Government to make rules.

Sub-section (2)

provides the specific matters for which rules may be made. Clause (vii)
of sub-section (2) specifically refers to submission of evidence and the
time therefor under sub-section (4) of Section 21. It is clear that the
Central Government had power to make rules with regard to, inter alia,
submission of evidence and the time therefor under sub-section (4) of
Section 21. The 2002 Rules specifically provide for evidence in support
of an opposition under Rule 50 thereof. The said rule reads as under:“50.
50. Evidence in support of opposition.(1) Within two months from services on him of a
copy of the counterstatement or within such further
period not exceeding one month in the aggregate
thereafter as the Registrar may on request allow, the
opponent shall either leave with the Registrar, such
evidence by way of affidavit as he may desire to
adduce in support of his opposition or shall intimate
to the Registrar and to the applicant in writing that he
does not desire to adduce evidence in support of his
WP(C)10721/05

Page No.7 of 21

opposition but intends to rely on the facts stated in
the notice of opposition. He shall deliver to the
applicant copies of any evidence that he leaves with
the Registrar under this sub-rule and intimate the
Registrar in writing of such delivery.
(2) If an opponent takes no action under
sub-rule (1) within the time mentioned therein, he
shall be deemed to have abandoned his opposition.
(3) An application for the extension of the
period of one month mentioned in sub-rule (1) shall
be made in Form TM-56 accompanied by the
prescribed fee before the expiry of the period of two
months mentioned therein.”

7.

Reading Rule 50, it is clear that the evidence by way of

affidavit in support of an opposition to the registration of a trade mark
has to be filed within two months of the service of a copy of the counterstatement on the opponent.

This period of two months is further

extendable by a period of one month in the aggregate thereafter as the
Registrar may on request allow.

Clearly, in the first instance, the

evidence affidavit has to be filed within two months of the receipt of a
copy of the counter-statement. The Registrar may extend this period by a
further one month in the aggregate if a request for the same is made in
time. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 50 makes it clear that if an opponent takes no
action under sub-rule (1) within the time mentioned therein, he shall be
deemed to have abandoned his opposition. It is also interesting to note
WP(C)10721/05

Page No.8 of 21

that sub-rule (3) refers to the application for extension of the period of
one month mentioned in sub-rule (1). It is also stipulated that such an
application has to be made in Form TM-56 accompanied by the
prescribed fee before the expiry of the period of two months mentioned
therein. So, it is clear that a strict regimen has been prescribed for the
filing of evidence by way of affidavit in support of an opposition. A
plain reading of the provisions makes it abundantly clear that the
evidence has to be filed within two months in the first instance and, if an
appropriate application for extension of time is made before the expiry of
the period of two months and if such application is allowed by the
Registrar, then latest by a further month. In other words, under no
circumstances can the evidence affidavit be filed beyond the maximum
three months prescribed under the said rule. In case the opponent has not
taken steps within the prescribed time, then there is no option left with
the Registrar but to deem that the opponent has abandoned his
opposition.

8.

In Chief Forest Conservator (supra), the Supreme Court

held:“It is now well-settled that when rules are validly
framed, they should be treated as a part of the Act.”
WP(C)10721/05

Page No.9 of 21

There is no doubt that Rule 50 of the 2002 Rules has been validly framed
in exercise of the Central Government's rule making powers under
Section 157 (1) in general and Section 157 (2) (vii) in particular. In this
background, it can be safely stated that the time and manner prescribed in
Rule 50 of the 2002 Rules should be treated as having been prescribed by
the 1999 Act itself.

9.

The decisions referred to in the cases of Delta Impex (supra),

Pranam Enterprises (supra) and Popular Construction (supra) all
clearly indicate that where the statute itself prescribes a maximum
condonable period, then it would not be open to the authorities under that
statute to extend the period for doing an act beyond the prescribed
maximum condonable period. It is, therefore, clear that the Registrar
does not have any power to extend the time for filing the evidence
affidavit beyond the maximum period of one month after the initial
period of two months.

10.

Coming now to the contrary argument advanced by the

learned counsel for the respondent No.1 that the provisions of Section
131 of the 1999 Act read with Rule 105 of the 2002 Rules permit

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.10 of 21

extension of time and, therefore, Rule 50 would have to be read down in
that context. Section 131 reads as under:“131. Extension of time.—(1) If the Registrar is
satisfied, on application made to him in the
prescribed manner and accompanied by the
prescribed fee, that there is sufficient cause for
extending the time for doing any act (not being a time
expressly provided in this Act), whether the time so
specified has expired or not, he may, subject to such
conditions as he may think fit to impose, extend the
time and inform the parties accordingly.
(2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall be
deemed to require the Registrar to hear the parties
before disposing of an application for extension of
time, and no appeal shall lie from any order of the
Registrar under this section.”
The Registrar has been empowered to extend time for doing certain acts
provided he is satisfied that there is sufficient cause for extending the
time. But there is an exception to this power. The exception being that it
must not be a case where time is expressly provided in the Act. Rule 105
of the 2002 Rules, which is also sought to be pressed into service by the
learned counsel for the respondent No.1, reads as under:“105. Extension of time.—(1) An application for
extension of time under section 131 (not being a
time expressly provided in the Act or prescribed by
rule 79 or by sub-rule (4) of rule 80 or a time for the
extension of which provision is made in the rules)
shall be made in Form TM-56.

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.11 of 21

(2) Upon an application made under subrule (1) the Registrar, if satisfied that the
circumstances are such as to justify the extension of
the time applied for, may, subject to the provisions
of the rules where a maximum time limit is
prescribed and subject to such conditions as he may
think fit to impose, extend the time and notify the
parties accordingly and the extension may be granted
though the time for doing the act or taking the
proceeding for which it is applied for has already
expired.”
(emphasis supplied)
The said rule stipulates that an application for extension of time under
Section 131 of the 1999 Act has to be made in Form TM-56. It may be
remembered that this is the same Form TM-56 in which an application
for extension of time is required to be made under Rule 50 (3).
However, the extension of time permissible under Rule 105 is not
applicable to the following cases:i)

where time is expressly provided in the Act ; or

ii)

where time is prescribed by Rule 79 or by sub-rule
(4) of Rule 80; or

iii)

where time for the extension of which provision is
made in the rules.

Therefore, in cases where time is expressly provided for doing of an act
under the 1999 Act or where provision for extension of time for doing
WP(C)10721/05

Page No.12 of 21

such act is made in the rules itself, then Rule 105 would have no
applicability. The argument advanced by the learned counsel for the
respondent No.1 that Rule 105 would apply, therefore, cannot be
accepted. As already indicated above, the time prescribed for the filing
of an evidence affidavit has to be construed as if the same had been
stipulated by the 1999 Act itself. In any event, Rule 50 (1) specifically
makes provision for the extension of time for filing the evidence
affidavit. That being the case, Rule 105 cannot have any application. It
is interesting to note that both Rule 50 and Rule 105 require that the
application for extension of time be made in Form TM-56. If the view
espoused by the learned counsel for the respondent No.1 is to be taken,
then the provisions of Rule 50 would be rendered otiose. An exception
has been carved out in Rule 105 with regard to provisions made in the
Rules for extension of time. But, no exception has been made in Rule
50. Therefore, Rule 105 would have no application insofar as the filing
of an evidence affidavit in support of an opposition beyond the
prescribed time is concerned. It is only Rule 50 which would apply. In
fact, sub-rule (2) of Rule 105 itself circumscribes the power of the
Registrar to extend time by using the expression “subject to the
provisions of the rules where a maximum time limit is prescribed”. Rule

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.13 of 21

50 (1) prescribes a maximum time limit. Therefore, even under Rule
105, the Registrar cannot extend time beyond the prescribed maximum
time limit.

11.

Reference also needs to be made to the Full Bench decision of

this court in the case of Hastimal Jain (supra) particularly because the
learned counsel for the respondent No.1 has placed great reliance on the
said decision. The questions before the Full Bench were as under:"(a)
Whether Rule 53 (2) of the Trade and
Merchandise Marks Rules 1959 is directory or
mandatory ?
(b)
Whether the Registrar's power to extend
the time for filing evidence in support of the
opposition stands extinguished if an application for
extension of time is not filed or extension is not
granted before the expiry of the period of two months
pre- scribed under Rule 53 (1) of the Trade and
Merchandise Marks Rules, 1959 ?
(c)
What is the effect of Rule 106 of the said
Rules on the exercise of powers by the Registrar
under Rule 52(2) ?”

12.

These questions, as would be apparent from a plain reading

thereof, related to the provisions of the 1958 Act and the 1959 Rules. In

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.14 of 21

the context of these questions, the Full Bench made the following
observations:“19.
We have considered the rival submissions
and read the various Judgments. The determination of
the questions raised would depend on whether Rule
53 (2) can be said to be mandatory or merely
directory. Mere use of the word "shall" is not
sufficient to treat the Rule as mandatory. Even
though the word "shall" prima facie indicates that it is
mandatory, still the Court must ascertain the real
intention of the Legislature by looking to the Statute
as a whole. It must also be remembered that a legal
fiction cannot be stretched beyond the purpose for
which it was enacted. As seen above the legal fiction
is not absolute. It is limited by the word "unless the
Registrar otherwise directs". In our view it is
significant that wherever the Legislature intended to
prescribe a fixed time, which could not be extended,
it has specifically so done. The necessary implication
of this is that in all other cases the time was not to be
fixed but one which would be within the power of the
Registrar to extend, Undoubtedly the intention of the
Legislature was to minimise delays. For that fixed
time is laid down in the Statute itself. However a
reading of Section 21 itself shows that for procedural
matters like filing evidence the Legislature was not
laying down a fixed time in the Statute. This view is
supported by a reading of Section 101 and Rule 106.
Section 101 indicates that the only circumstance
under which time cannot be extended by the Registrar
is where a time has been expressly provided in the
Act. Similarly, under Rule 106 the time can be
extended by the Registrar, in all cases, except for the
four, which have been mentioned in paragraph 14
above. It is all the more significant that Rules 53 (2)
and Rule 54 have not been included in Rule 106. To
interpret it otherwise would be to add in Rule 106 the
words "or Rule 53". The Legislature has purposely
WP(C)10721/05

Page No.15 of 21

omitted to do so. It is not possi- ble to accept
submission that Rule 53 gets incorporated in Section
21. If the Legislature wanted to provide a fixed term
of two months in Section 21(4) as they have done in
Section 21(1) and (2), they would have done so. This
interpretation is also borne out by the fact that the
deeming provi- sion, in Rule 53 (2), comes into play
only if the Registrar does not other- wise directs. The
fact that the legal fiction is subject to the direction of
the Registrar also shows that it is not absolute but is
being controlled by discretion of Registrar. In our
view Section 101 and Rule 106 permit the Registrar
to extend time, even though the time has expired. To
hold other- wise would be to negate the words to that
effect used both in Section 101 as well as Rule 106.
We are thus in agreement with the view expressed by
the Bombay High Court and the Gujarat High Court.
We disagree with the view expressed in the case
reported in 1978 (3) PLR 148 and in the Order dated
30th January 1995 in C.M. (M) 59/95.”

13.

From the above extract, it is apparent that the Full Bench was

of the view that Rule 53 (2) of the 1959 Rules was not mandatory, but
merely directory.

The Full Bench observed that although the word

“shall” was used in Rule 53 (2), that by itself would not indicate that the
provision was mandatory. It came to this conclusion specifically because
of the expression “unless the Registrar otherwise directs” used
immediately after the word “shall”. It is in this context that the Full
Bench was of the view that the legal fiction created by the word “shall”
was not absolute as it was limited by the words “unless the Registrar
WP(C)10721/05

Page No.16 of 21

otherwise directs”. Consequently, the Full Bench was of the view that
the provisions of Rule 53 (2) were not mandatory but directory.

14.

The learned counsel for the respondent No.1 has urged before

this court that Rule 50 (2) of the 2002 Rules must also be interpreted in
similar fashion as being directory and not mandatory. This argument has
to be rejected. The reason being that the provisions of Rule 53 of the
1959 Rules and Rule 50 of the 2002 Rules are materially different. First
of all, in sub-rule (1) of Rule 50 of the 2002 Rules, the following words
have been inserted:“or within such further period not exceeding one
month in the aggregate thereafter as the Registrar
may on request allow.”
These words are missing in Rule 53 (1) of the 1959 Rules and, therefore,
the decision in Hastimal Jain (supra) would not apply to the facts of the
present case. The second difference is that the expression “unless the
Registrar otherwise directs” appearing in Rule 53 (2) of the 1959 Rules
is missing from Rule 50 (2) of the 2002 Rules. For this reason also, the
decision of the Full Bench in Hastimal Jain's case would not apply to
the present case.

The Full Bench had placed great reliance on the

expression “unless the Registrar otherwise directs” to indicate that the

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.17 of 21

provision was directory and not mandatory and secondly that the
Registrar had discretion in the matter. But these words are missing in the
new avatar of this rule which is to be found in Rule 50 (2) of the 2002
Rules. The new Rule 50 (2) simply and plainly states that if an opponent
takes no action under sub-rule (1) within the time prescribed therein, he
shall be deemed to have abandoned his opposition. The Registrar has no
role to play and no discretion in the matter. The entire basis of the Full
Bench decision in Hastimal Jain's case is that the Registrar had been
given discretion in the matter as indicated by the words “unless the
Registrar otherwise directs”. This discretion is missing in Rule 50 under
the 2002 Rules.

15.

In Ramachandra (supra), the Supreme Court observed that in

Taylor v. Taylor: 1875 (1) Ch D 426, Jessel M.R. adopted the rule that
where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing
must be done in that way or not at all and that other methods of
performance are necessarily forbidden.

The Supreme court further

observed that this rule had stood the test of time. In that very case
[Ramachandra (supra)], the Supreme Court placing reliance on Craies
on Statute Law, 7th Edn. observed that with regard to the question as to

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.18 of 21

whether a provision was mandatory or directory, no uniform rule could
be laid down as to whether mandatory enactments should be considered
directory only or obligatory with an implied nullification for
disobedience. The Supreme Court further observed that it is the duty of
Courts of justice to try to get at the real intention of the legislature by
carefully attending to the whole scope. Such intention of the legislature
is, therefore, to be ascertained upon a review of the language, subjectmatter and importance of the provision in relation to the general object
intended to be secured, the mischief, if any, to be prevented and the
remedy to be promoted by the Act. Considering the provisions and
making a comparative study of the old and the new Act as well as the old
and the new rules, it is more than clear that specific words have been
introduced in the new provisions and / or removed from the old
provisions. Such additions and deletions are significant and bring out
the true intention of the legislature. For instance, Rule 53 of the 1959
Rules did not prescribe any maximum period of extension of time.
Whereas Rule 50 of the 2002 Rules specifically provides for extension of
time not exceeding one month in the aggregate. This introduces a clear
stipulation that the Registrar's powers to grant extension of time are
limited to one month in the aggregate beyond the two months prescribed

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.19 of 21

under the said Rule. This limitation was not there in the earlier Rule, but
it is definitely there in Rule 50 of the 2002 Rules. The second instance is
that the words “unless the Registrar directs” have been consciously
deleted from sub-rule (2) of Rule 53 in its new incarnation in Rule 50
(2). It is obvious that the legislature wanted to make the provision
mandatory and did not want to give any discretion to the Registrar in this
connection.

The object is apparent that the delays be cut down in

deciding the application for registration of a trade mark.

16.

It is, therefore, quite clear that the answer to question No.1 is

that the Registrar does not have the power to extend the time for filing of
the evidence affidavit in support of an opposition beyond the maximum
period of three months prescribed under rule 50 (1) of the Trade Marks
Rules, 2002 and that the answer to question No.2 is that the non-filing of
the evidence affidavit within the prescribed time would by itself lead to
the conclusion that the opposition has been abandoned.

17.

Lastly, I would like to observe that the Intellectual Property

Appellate Board in arriving at the conclusion that it did was under the
impression that the Registrar had discretion in the matter and was

WP(C)10721/05

Page No.20 of 21

exercising a discretionary power.

This premise is not correct.

The

provisions of Rule 50 (2) are mandatory and the Registrar has no
discretion. If the evidence affidavit has not been filed within the time
prescribed, the opposition would have to be deemed to have been
abandoned. The Registrar has also no discretion in extending the time
beyond the maximum period of one month prescribed under Rule 50(1).
Therefore, the impugned order passed by the Intellectual Property
Appellate Board on 11.03.2005 is set aside and the order passed by the
Assistant Registrar dated 20.02.2004 is upheld.
This writ petition is allowed. No order as to costs.
