V.B. GUPTA, J.
By this common judgment, three appeals bearing Nos.
1678, 1679 & 1680/2006 filed by the Assessee are being
disposed of since common question of law is involved.
2.

All the three appeals arise out of the decision dated

5th May, 2006 passed by Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
(hereinafter referred to as Tribunal) for the assessment
year 1993-94 in ITA No.2398/Del/97, assessment year
1990-91 and 1991-92 in ITA No. 1652 & 1653/Del/2000.
3.

The facts in brief are that originally the Assessee

company had been promoted by Shri.Om Prakash Jain and
the entire share holding of the company was held by his
family members. In 1989, the control and management of
this company was transferred to Shri Narender Anand and
his members who had purchased all the shares of the
company. At the time of the purchase of the shares by the
Anand Family, the company was having a fully constructed
building at 12-14/8, Doctor's Lane, New Delhi. After taking
over, some more expenses were incurred for alteration and
modification of the flats and these flats were sold to
ITA No.1678/2006

different parties in the financial year 1989-90, 1990-91 and
1992-93.

However, the Assessee had not filed return of

income for these years.
4.

A search was conducted in the case of Assessee in the

year 1992 and during the search only it came to the notice
of the Revenue that the company had sold many of the flats.
Some incriminating documents were also seized during the
search showing under statement of sale consideration in
the garb of shares. The Assessing Officer, therefore, made
addition on this account in assessment year 1993-94 and
based on the material gathered in the assessment year
1993-94.

Assessments for assessment year 1990-91 and

1991-92 were reopened and in the reassessment for these
years, similar additions were made.
5.

Being dissatisfied, the Assessee filed appeals against

the order of the Assessing Officer before the Commissioner
of Income Tax (Appeals) who confirmed the additions.
6.

Aggrieved by the decision of the Commissioner of

Income Tax (Appeals), the Assessee filed appeals before the
Tribunal for all the three years and appeals of the Assessee
were dismissed.

It has been argued

by the learned counsel for the

Assessee that at the time of the acquisition of the company
by the Anand family, the payment were made towards book
value of the assets as well as towards the shares and the
Assessee had followed the same system at the time of sale
of flats and as such the Assessing Officer was not justified
in rejecting the claim. There is nothing on record to show
that the Assessee had received any amount above the
consideration declared by the Assessee and the Assessee
had not been confronted with the inquiry report of the
Assessing Officer and as such the addition made, therefore,
is not justified.
8.

On the other hand, it has been argued by learned

counsel for the Revenue that the documents found during
the

search

clearly

shows

that

there

was

only

one

agreement for the sale of flats, which was also confirmed
by some of the purchasers on inquiry and it is a clear cut
case of under statement of sale consideration.
9.

It may be noticed from the assessment order that the

company had sold several flats during the accounting
period relevant to the assessment year 1993-94 and in
ITA No.1678/2006

Page 4 of

respect of each of the flats sold, the Assessee had executed
two separate agreements. The first agreement was for a
consideration charged for the sale of the space/flat in the
building and other agreement was for the sale of the shares
of this company at the rate of Rs.6,030/- per share of face
value of Rs.100/- to the buyer of this very space/flat. The
sale of share is stated to be an integral part of the first
agreement for the sale of space/flat. The total consideration
in most of the cases had been paid to the company even in
respect of the stated consideration for the sale of the
shares, which were held not by the Assessee-company but
by Shri Narender Anand and his family members.
10.

The Assessing Officer examined copies of some of the

agreements for sale of the flats executed during financial
year 1989-90 and 1990-91 which were seized during the
course of search. It was noted by the Assessing Officer that
these flats were sold without any condition of purchase of
shares of this company held by Sh.Narender Anand and his
family members.

In all these agreements, the stated

consideration was only in respect of sale/purchase of flats.
In respect of these flats, letters were also found which were
ITA No.1678/2006

Page 5 of

issued to purchasers by the Assessee-company duly signed
by Sh.Narender Anand stating the total consideration in
respect of sale of the flats and mentioning the super
covered area.

There was absolutely no mention of any

transfer of shares or any consideration having been made
by the buyers in the transfer of the shares. The entire sale
consideration was distinctly shown as the sale price of the
flats.
11.

It is also borne out from the record that the Assessing

Officer issued inquiry letters to various buyers of flats
which were replied by some of the flat owners, who in their
replies, clearly indicated that they had paid entire sale
consideration only for acquiring the flats and none for
acquiring the shares of the company.
12.

The relevant findings of the Tribunal in this regard

are as under:“We have perused the records and
considered the rival contentions carefully.
The assessee company owned flats in a
building located in a very posh area in
Delhi. The sale consideration of flats had
been been bifurcated by the assessee in two
parts: one against the sale of shares of the
company and the other against the sale
consideration of flats. The assessee was not
ITA No.1678/2006

Page 6 of

9

holding the shares, which in fact were
owned by the individual members of the
Anand Family. The sale consideration in
respect of flats owned by the company is,
therefore, not linked to the sale of shares.
How the consideration had been paid by the
Anand family at the time of acquisition of
company in 1989 is not relevant while
considering the income of the company
from the sale of the flats. The shares were
shown to have been sold at a high price of
Rs.6,030/- per share against the face value
of Rs.100/- and no basis had been given of
such high price.
On the contrary, the
material gathered during the search
showed that the assessee had sold flats at a
price of Rs.850/- to Rs.1050/- per sft. In the
year 1990 and 1991, which were also
confirmed on inquiry from the individual
buyers that the entire consideration had
been paid only against the sale of flats. The
entire consideration including the part
stated to be related to share had been
received by the company and it was only
much later that the part of sale
consideration was passed on to the
shareholders i.e. Shri Anand and his family
members and the plea was raised that
major part was against sale of shares. The
claim of the Learned AR that the assessee
had not been confronted with the finding, is
also not correct as the order of the A.O.
shows that the assessee had been
confronted with the material gathered. It is
also noted that this point had not been
specifically challenged by the assessee
before CIT(A). We, therefore, find no force
in such claim made now. We also find no
force in the claim of the Learned AR that
there was no material to show under
statement of sale consideration of flats. The
ITA No.1678/2006

Page 7 of

13.

material found during search in relation to
Assessment Year 1990-91 and 1991-92
clearly showed that the flats were sold at
rates from Rs.850/- to Rs.1050/- per sft. and
the basement @ Rs.500/- sft. There was
therefore, no reason for the price to be
lower in Assessment Year 1993-94. The
assessee has also not produced any
evidence to show that the price in the
subsequent year was depressed. On the
contrary, the material gathered by the
authorities below clearly show that the
assessee had tried to divert the sale
consideration in the garb of sale of shares
without any justifiable reason.
We,
therefore, see no infirmity in the order of
CIT(A) and the same is confirmed.”
The above being the position, no fault can be found

with the view taken by the Tribunal. Thus, the order of the
Tribunal does not give rise to a question of law, much less a
substantial question of law, to fall within the limited
purview of Section 260-A of the Act, which is confined to
entertaining only such appeal against the order which
involves a substantial question of law.
14.

Moreover, since, there are concurrent findings of

facts by three statutory authorities, we do not find any
reason to disagree with their findings and as such no
substantial question of law arises for our consideration.
