ORDER
09.04.2008
The petitioner had applied for allotment of a built-up shop under SC/ST
Scheme in 1996. In the draw of lot held on 27.3.1997, a built-up shop
No.9 admeasuring 17.11 sq. mtrs. situated at CSC 11, Sector 3, Rohini,
Delhi was allotted to the petitioner. Allotment letter dated 31st March,
1997 was issued and the petitioner was required to deposit 25% of the
reserve price and other charges amounting to Rs.1,07,665/- within 60
days of the issue of the letter.

It appears that the petitioner deposited

the said amount on 28.5.1997.
2.

With regard to the balance amount of 75%, clause 3 of the demand cum
allotment letter stipulates as under:“3.
As per clause (8) of the terms and conditions of
allotment, you are required to pay 25% of the premium
within 60 days. The balance 75% is to be paid in 24
equated monthly instalments inclusive of interest @ 6 per
annum. The amount of monthly instalments shall be
payable in advance by 10th of every month for which it is

due.”

3.

There is no averment in the writ petition that the petitioner had complied

with the said clause and made payment of 75% of the balance amount by way of
24 equated monthly installments along with interest @6% per annum.
4.

The petitioner along with the writ petition has also filed letter dated

09.10.1997 written by DDA asking the petitioner to furnish the following
documents:“2. Terms & Condition on non Judicial stamp paper
worth Rs.2/- duly signed and attested by notary public
with a notarial stamp of Rs.3/- and also signed in the
joint name in case of married.
3.
Affidavit regarding non availability/availing any
benefit previously.
4.
Under taking regarding payment of balance 75%
premium.
7.
Affidavit regarding source of finance.
8.
Affidavit regarding marriage status.
9.
Specimen signature on the joint name in case of
marriages.
10. Four passport size photographs (Joint) in case
married duly attested by the Gazetted officer.”

5. There is no letter available on record to show that the petitioner had
complied with the letter dated 09.10.1997 and had furnished the said
documents. It is also apparent from the writ petition that from 1997
till 02.6.2007, the petitioner had kept quiet and for the first time after
about ten years had sent a legal notice making a claim on the
aforesaid shop. The petitioner had lost interest in the shop and has

now expressed his interest because prices have shot up and the
petitioner now finds it to be a viable proposition.
6. In these circumstances, I do not find any merit in the present writ
petition and the same is liable to be dismissed. However, liberty is
granted to the petitioner to approach DDA for refund of Rs.
1,07,665/- deposited by him by filing a representation. In case the
petitioner is entitled to refund as per scheme/Rules, DDA will
examine the representation and pass necessary orders.
