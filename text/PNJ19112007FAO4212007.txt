1.

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
The appeal lays a challenge to the order dated 27.7.2007

passed by the Railway Claims Tribunal awarding a sum of Rs.4 lac to
the claimant.
2.

Claim petition was filed by the respondent Banti Kumar

stating that he was a bona fide passenger on Train No.2304, New
Delhi Howrah Poorva Express on 30.6.2005. He stated that he was
proceeding from New Delhi to Patna.

That when the untoward

incident in question took place the bogie was over crowded. The
train was approaching Patna Junction.

He and other passengers

were near the gate of the compartment to disembark. Due to heavy
page 1 of 3

rush passengers were jostling with each other.

Such was the

intensity of the heavy rush and jostling that he was thrown out of the
running train and as a result both legs were injured.

He suffered

amputation of lower limbs.
3.

At the trial, Banti Kumar successfully established his

status of being a bona fide passenger, in that, he produced the ticket
which entitled him to undertake the journey from New Delhi to Patna
Junction.
4.

On the issue whether he was responsible for what had

happened and whether the accident was an untoward incident as per
Section 123(c) (2) of the Railways Act, parties debated with
reference to the decision of the Supreme Court reported as 2002 ACJ
841 (SC ) N.Parameswaran Pillai Vs. UOI. The debate between the
parties was :- what was the effect of the train being over crowded
resulting in intense jostling by the passengers in the compartment?
5.

The Tribunal has opined that if Railway authorities

allowed excess number of passengers to board the bogie which
excess number results in jostling, Railway

authorities

would

be

responsible for what had happened.
6.

On the issue of quantification, with reference to the

disability certificate Ex. AW1/5, keeping in view the schedule
prescribed under the Act learned Tribunal has assessed the
compensation as afore-noted.

7.

In appeal points which have been urged related to the

status of the claimant as a bona fide passenger and whether he was
responsible, due to acts of negligence and carelessness, for what
had happened.
8.

On the issue of the claimant being a bona fide passenger

suffice would it be to state that the Railway ticket produced by him
was proof of his status. On the issue of negligence and carelessness,
the testimony of the injured to the effect that the bogie was over
crowded and due to jostling in the bogie he lost balance and fell
down, it cannot be said that the finding returned is wrong. It is in
consonance with the decision of the Supreme Court reported in
N.Parameshwaran Dillai's case.
9.

I find no merits in the appeal.

10.

Dismissed.
