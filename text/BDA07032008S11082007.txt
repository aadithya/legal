1.

This is an application filed on behalf of the plaintiffs for striking off the

defence of the defendants on account of their failure to make deposits as per
the orders passed by this Court on 17.07.2007 and 09.10.2007. The plaintiffs/
applicants have been able to show that the orders dated 17.07.2007 and
IA No. 14907/2007 in CS (OS) No.1108/2007

Page No. 1 of 5

09.10.2007 were not complied with by the defendants. By the order dated
17.07.2007 the defendants were directed to pay the amounts represented by the
rent and hire charges, which were outstanding till then, within three weeks.
The defendant No.1 failed to do so. On 09.10.2007 this Court granted a last
opportunity to clear the arrears within 15 days with a further direction that the
defendants would also continue to pay the said amounts without prejudice to
the rights and contentions of the parties. According to the defendant No.1 the
lease is subsisting whereas according to the plaintiffs the lease has been
terminated. The defendant No.1 has taken the stand that the lease subsists and
they are only liable to pay the rent and hire charges.

2.

Despite the last opportunity granted on 09.10.2007, the defendant No.1

did not make the payment of the arrears within the stipulated 15 days. On
26.10.2007, two letters were received from the defendants along with cheques
towards the arrears for the period April to October, 2007. On presentation, the
said cheques bounced and were returned to the plaintiff by its bankers with the
remarks 'funds insufficient' on 02.11.2007. Because of this, the plaintiffs were
constrained to move a contempt petition on 23.11.2007 which is pending. On
23.11.2007 itself the plaintiffs received a letter dated 20.11.2007 requesting
them to present the earlier cheques again. In good faith, on 26.11.2007, the

Page No. 2 of 5

plaintiffs presented the cheques once again. However, the cheques bounced
this time also. On 20.12.2007 the defendants handed over a pay order before
this Court for the period April to October, 2007. That payment was, however,
realized. Insofar as the payment for November, 2007 is concerned, the same
was also received on time. The payment for the month of December was made
by way of a cheque on 08.01.2008 and that, too, bounced on 10.01.2008. The
said cheque was substituted by a new pay order dated 04.02.2008 which was
realized. The payment for the month of January, 2008 was also made on or
about 22.01.2008. Nothing was paid for the months of February 2008 and
March 2008.

3.

The learned counsel for the plaintiffs placed reliance on a decision of the

Division Bench of this Court in the case of V. P. Puri & Ors v. Union of
India: 2001 III AD (DELHI) 669 to show that circumstances in the present
case clearly call for an order striking off the defence of the defendants in view
of the fact that they have repeatedly disobeyed the orders of this Court passed
under Order 39 Rule 10 CPC for making payments. The learned counsel also
placed reliance on Erum Travels v. Kanwar Rani: 69 (1997) DLT 567 and
Mrs Purnim Dhawan & Anr. v. Agmoz Online Pvt. Ltd.: 2003 (66) DRJ 218.

4.

The learned counsel for the defendants submitted that there was some

difficulty which had been faced by the defendant No.1 as a result of which the
payments were not made regularly. He submits that now the difficult period is
over and the defendant No.1 would be able to honour all of its commitments
towards monthly payments. He submitted that one opportunity be granted to
the defendants to comply with the orders on a month to month basis.

5.

Considering the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the

parties, it is clear that the proposition that this Court has powers to strike off
the defence of the defendants on account of non-compliance of orders passed
under Order 39 Rule 10 CPC cannot be disputed. In the present case, I find
that the conduct of the defendants has not inspired much confidence. They
have not complied with the orders and have repeatedly issued cheques which
have bounced. However, as a last and final opportunity, I allow the defendants
to make payment of the arrears for the months of February and March, 2008
within one week from today, if not already made.

Insofar as the future

payments are concerned, they shall be made by making deposits in this Court
by pay orders in favour of the Registrar by the 7th day of each month. The
moment the payments are made by the defendants, the plaintiffs shall be
entitled to withdraw the same on a month to month basis. It is made clear that

IA No. 14907/2007 in CS (OS) No.1108/2007

Page No. 4 of 5

if there is a default in either making the payment of arrears within one week or
the monthly payments by the defendants, their defence shall stand struck off
without any further orders of this Court. It is reiterated that the payments that
would be made by the defendants and which would be received by the
plaintiffs, would be without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the
parties.
This application stands disposed of.
