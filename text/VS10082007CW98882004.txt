A.K. SIKRI, J. (Oral)
We note from the order sheet that on last three dates,
nobody has appeared on behalf of Respondent. Even today we
have passed over the matter once and waited for the Counsel for
the

Respondent.

However,

none

has

appeared.

In

these

circumstances we have no option but to proceed with the matter.
We have heard learned counsel for the Petitioner and
also gone through the records including the counter affidavit filed
by the Respondent.

The Office of Chief Signals and Telecommunication
Engineer (P & P) floated a tender for the supply, installation,
testing and commissioning of indoor equipments, relay racks,
relay wire, power supply equipments,

panels, signals point

machines, track circuit, trenching, cable laying etc., in connection
with the provisions of route setting type of interlocking by
centralized operation of point and signals at 3 stations namely
Ambernath, Badla Pur and Sangaon in Mumbai Division. The
closing date and the time of submission of tender was 24th
September 2003. These tenders were to be opened on the same
date at 15.05. hours. Petitioner also gave its bid by submitting its
tender. As per the tender conditions, offers of the tenderers were
to remain valid for the period of four months from the date of
opening of the tenders, i.e., till 23rd January 2004.

The

Respondent could not complete the exercise of processing the
tenders by the stipulated date and requested the bidders,
including the Petitioner, for extending the validity period.
Petitioner agreed to keep the tenders open till 24th February 2004.
According to the Petitioner as the work was still not
awarded and the Respondent was delaying the finalization of the
tender and in the meantime, the cost of raw material rose sharply
and the Petitioner found that rates, offered by it, would no more

be viable, vide its letter dated 17th February 2004, the Petitioner
revoked its offer/tender. This letter was delivered to the
Respondent through two modes, namely (a) by fax sent on 19th
February 2004, which was received by the Respondent on the
same day at 3:42 PM. In support of this submission, the Petitioner
has placed the fax report on record; (b) letter dated 17th February
2004 was also hand delivered to the Respondent on 20th February
2004. The Petitioner has filed the said letter as Annexure P-3,
which contains the stamp of the Respondent, acknowledging
receipt of the said letter and it bears the date of 20th February
2004.
The Respondent, however, sent a letter dated 20th
February 2004 accepting the bid of the Petitioner. This letter,
according to the Petitioner, was dispatched on 21.2.2004 and was
received on by the Petitioner on 24th February 2004. The
petitioner has placed on record a copy of the envelope in which
this letter was received, and the same shows the date of its
posting as 21st February 2004. Respondent has also stated in its
counter affidavit that the acceptance letter dated 20th February
2004 was sent by the Respondent to its Delhi Office, and Delhi
Office in turn sent this letter to the Petitioner by fax on 23rd
February 2004.

On the receipt of the letter dated 17th February 2004 of
the Petitioner, the Respondent vide its letter dated 18th March
2004, informed the Petitioner that the earnest money deposit
(EMD) alongwith the tender was forfeited by the Respondent.
However, thereafter, vide letter dated 31st May 2004, Petitioner
was informed that the contract was awarded to the Petitioner by
the Respondent vide acceptance letter dated 20th February 2004
and as the withdrawal amounted to termination of the said work,
the Respondent would be carrying out the work on the risks and
costs of the Petitioner. Challenging this communication, present
Writ Petition is filed by the Petitioner with the following prayers:
“That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to issue
writ of Mandamus, Certiorari and or any other
writ directions or which this Hon'ble Court
may deem fit and proper in the facts and
circumstances of the case quashing the order
dated 20.02.2004 and 31.05.2004;
pass such other order/orders as this Hon'ble
Court may deem just and proper in the facts
and circumstances of the case.”
The

submission of the

learned

Counsel for the

Petitioner is that the Petitioner had withdrawn its bid/offer much
before its acceptance and therefore, no concluded contract came
into existence. She points out that though the last date up to
which the bid was valid was 24th February 2004, the bid was
withdrawn vide letter dated 17th February 2004 delivered on 19th
W.P. (C) No. 9888/2004 & C.M. No. 6996/2004

Page 4 of 10

February 2004. The only consequence which it would entail was
the forfeiture of the earnest money deposit which was done by
the Respondent and with which Petitioner has no quarrel.
However, since no concluded contract came into existence, there
was no question of treating the so called contract as terminated
by the Petitioner, and therefore the proposed action of the
Respondent in threatening to carry out the work at the risk and
cost of the Petitioner is plainly illegal and uncalled for.
In the counter affidavit filed by the Respondent, the
Respondent has not denied that letter dated 17th February 2004
was received by it through fax on 19th February 2004. The only
plea taken is that 19th February 2004 happened to be a holiday in
Mumbai and therefore, it was not received on that date. It is
further pleaded that this letter came to their notice only on 24th
February 2004, by which date the Respondent had already
communicated the acceptance of the tender. It is also not denied
that in so far as acceptance letter dated 20th February 2004 sent
by post, and the copy sent by the Mumbai Office to Delhi Office
for onward transmission to Petitioner are concerned, these
communications were sent on 21st and 23rd February 2004
respectively.
In view of the above factual matrix, on which there is
W.P. (C) No. 9888/2004 & C.M. No. 6996/2004

Page 5 of 10

no dispute, it is clear that the withdrawal letter dated 17th
February 2004 sent by the Petitioner was received in the Office of
the Respondent No. 2 on 19th February 2004, and another copy on
20th February 2004 was also hand delivered. Acceptance letter is
dated 20th February 2004, dispatched at the earliest on 21 st
February 2004, which is, naturally, after the bid was withdrawn.
Explanation given in the counter affidavit that though the letter
dated 17th February 2004 was received through fax on 19th
February 2004, but nobody could know about this letter till 24th
February 2004 is hardly convincing. That apart, there is no
explanation with regard to the receipt of the letter hand delivered
by the Petitioner on 20th February 2004. Even if it is taken that
19th February 2004 was a holiday, letter dated 17th February 2004
was received by the Respondent through fax as well as by hand
on 20th February 2004. Till that time, there was no acceptance of
the bid. Mere acceptance of bid by letter dated 20th February
2004, would not be of any consequence as communication of that
acceptance to the Petitioner is also required. This letter was
dispatched on 21st February 2004 and received by the Petitioner
only on 24th February 2004. Another letter sent through Delhi
Office was received through fax only on 23rd February 2004. It is
thus clear that the offer was withdrawn before it could be
W.P. (C) No. 9888/2004 & C.M. No. 6996/2004

Page 6 of 10

accepted and therefore, no contract came into existence. (See
Union of India vs. Maddala Thathiah, AIR 1966 SC 1724)
We may refer to Section 5 of the Contract Act, which
states that “A proposal may be revoked at any time
before the communication of its acceptance is
complete as against the proposer, but not
afterwards.”
Section 5 embodies the principle discussed by Anson in
“Anson's Law of Contract” 23rd Edition at page 55, in the following
words:
“Acceptance is to an offer what a lighted
match is to a train of gunpowder. It produces
something which cannot be recalled or
undone. But the powder may have laid until it
has become damp, or the man who laid the
train may remove it before the match is
applied. So an offer may lapse for want of
acceptance, or be revoked before acceptance.
Also the offeree may decide to reject the offer.
Until an offer is accepted, it creates no legal
rights, and it may be terminated at any
times.”
Section 6 of the Contract Act provides that a proposal
may be revoked in the following ways:
“6. Revocation how made. - A proposal is
revoked (1)by the communication of noticed of
revocation by the proposer to the other
party;
(2)by the lapse of the time prescribed in such
proposal for its acceptance, or, if no time is
W.P. (C) No. 9888/2004 & C.M. No. 6996/2004

Page 7 of 10

so prescribed, by the lapse of a reasonable
time, without communication of the
acceptance;
(3)by the failure of the acceptor to fulfill a
condition precedent to acceptance; or
(4)by the death or insanity of the proposer, if
the fact of his death or insanity comes to
the knowledge of the acceptor before
acceptance.”
A communication of an acceptance is complete as
against the proposer, when the acceptance is put in a course of
transmission to the proposer so as to be out of the power of the
acceptor. (Section 4 Contract Act). In case of acceptance being
sent by post, the same is said to be completed when the letter of
acceptance is posted. (See Bhagwandas Goverdhandas Kedia
v. M/s. Girdharilal Parshottamdas and Co. and others
(1966) 1 SCC 656).
On the other hand communication of revocation of a
proposal is said to be complete as against the person to whom it
is made when it comes to his knowledge the person to whom it is
made (see Section 4 Contract Act).
Therefore, before the communication of acceptance by
the respondent was complete, as against the proposer, i.e., the
petitioner (which would be 21st February 2004 at the earliest), the
proposal had been revoked by the petitioner. Thus, no biding
contract came into existence between the parties.

In these circumstances, the threatened action of the
Respondent to get the work executed at the risks and costs of the
Petitioner as contained in letter dated 31st May 2004 is clearly
illegal and uncalled for.
We may at this stage deal with another objection of the
Respondent, which relates to the territorial jurisdiction of this court.
It is stated in the counter affidavit that since the tenders were
floated by the Respondent's Mumbai Office and were also
accepted in Mumbai, Delhi Courts have no jurisdiction to entertain
the present petition. Reliance is placed on the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of Mrs. Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd.
Vs. Union of India & Anr., JT 2004 (Suppl. 1) SC 475.
However, in the counter affidavit, the respondents

have

themselves admitted that acceptance letter was sent by the
Mumbai Office to Delhi, and that the Delhi office faxed the letter
to the Petitioner who is also having its office in Delhi. This
communication is an integral part of the entire transaction,
inasmuch as, the purported cause of action on the basis of which
Respondent wants to get the work executed at the risk and cost
of the Petitioner is based on this letter. This part of the cause of
action has arisen in Delhi, and it is because of this purported
letter that the letter dated 31st May 2004 has been issued by the
W.P. (C) No. 9888/2004 & C.M. No. 6996/2004

Page 9 of 10

respondent. In these circumstances, the Petitioner is forced to file
this Petition. Consequently, this court has the necessary territorial
jurisdiction to entertain the petition, since a part of the cause of

action has arisen within its jurisdiction.
The consequence of the aforesaid discussions is that
the 'Rule' is made absolute. It is also held that there is no contract
between the parties and resultantly, it is not open to Respondent
No. 2 to get the work executed at the risk and cost of the
Petitioner. Communication dated 31st May 2004 of the respondent
is therefore quashed.
The recovery of amount made, if any, pursuant to this
threatened action, shall be refunded to the Petitioner except the
earnest money.
Petition stands disposed of.
