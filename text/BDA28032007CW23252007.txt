1.

This petition has been filed on behalf of Master Hardik Chouhdary,

who is a minor and was a student of class V at the Delhi Public School,
Mathura Road. He has been detained in this class and promotion has been

denied to him to class VI on account of shortage of attendance.

This is

indicated in the achievement record of 2006-2007 issued by the school. The
original has been placed before me. In the final assessment, it is indicated that
the petitioner has been detained due to shortage of attendance.
2.

The present case is an unfortunate case inasmuch as there was

discord apparently between the petitioner's father and mother. The result of this
was that the mother of the petitioner took away the petitioner and his brother
from Delhi without information to the petitioner's father on 21.08.2006. The
petitioner's father unable to find his children and his wife lodged a missing
person report with the Police Station, Shakarpur. Subsequently, it came to the
knowledge of the petitioner's father that the children had been taken away by
his wife to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. The petitioner, his brother and his
mother ultimately returned to the father's household on 04.12.2006. There was
a reconciliation between the parents. The parents are now living together
alongwith the children. The petitioner also joined the school on 07.12.2007 and
continued to attend classes since then. The shortage of attendance has occurred
because, during the period 21.08.2006 to 06.12.2007, the petitioner had been
taken away by his mother to Hyderabad, as indicated above.
3.

I see no reason as to why the petitioner, who is a minor, should be

punished for the discord between his parents. The school ought to have taken a
sympathetic view in this matter,

particularly, because the petitioner was

otherwise a good student. Accordingly, I direct that the Delhi Public School,
WP(C)2325/2007

Mathur Road shall not take into account the factum of the petitioner's absence
from the school during the period August to December 2006 and shall not
detain him on this ground. The only reason given by the school for detaining
the petitioner was shortage of attendance. Since, this is no longer a ground
available to the school, there is no impediment to the petitioner being promoted
to the next class.
This petition stands disposed of.
Dasti to both the parties.
