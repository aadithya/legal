The defendant No. 1, has been purchasing compressors

Page 2 of 9

from the plaintiff on behalf of defendant No. 3 since 1994. Initially the
goods ordered were being supplied to the defendants in Delhi.
However, subsequently deliveries were also made to the Mumbai
Branch of the defendants.
5.

Invoices

were

raised

and

delivered

alongwith

the

consignments which carried the various stipulations of the contract
including a stipulation as to levy of interest @ 24% on delayed
payment, which became due and payable immediately upon delivery.
The liability on account of rejection of sales tax certificate by the
Taxing Authority was also to be borne by the defendants as per the
invoices.
6.

Three different running accounts were maintained for the

supplies made at Delhi and Mumbai. As on May 25, 2001, the running
account of defendant No. 3. Firm, showed a debit balance of
Rs.66,135/-. The running account of defendant No. 4 at Delhi showed a
debit balance of Rs.20,06,375/- payable to the plaintiff as on 28th June
2001 (which includes the claim of Rs.1,82,772/- towards sales tax
liabilities Whereas running account of defendant No. 5 (Mumbai

However, all the above cheques were dishonoured upon

presentation for reason of insufficiency of funds. Several letters
requesting the defendants to clear the outstanding liability were sent
from time to time.
9.

Defendant No. 4 failed to submit Form ST-35 for the year

1998-99. Vide its letter dated 15.1.2001, defendant No. 4 was
requested to provide the said form but to no avail, due to which the
plaintiff had to incur a liability of Rs.1,82,772/-. Hence, a sum of
Rs.1,82,772/- has been debited to the account of defendant No. 4.
10.

Defendant No. 1 vide letter dated 12.5.2001 informed the

plaintiff that he was in the process of arranging the funds to clear all
outstanding dues of the plaintiff which he would clear in the next few
months. Another acknowledgment was issued on 13.7.2001 by the
defendant no.1. On 13th July 2001, the account in relation to supplies
made at Mumbai was reconciled and the final statement of accounts

Page 4 of 9

reflecting an outstanding of Rs.9,59,439.71 was agreed to and signed
by both the parties.
11.

Thereafter,

on

5.10.2001,

plaintiff

called

upon

the

defendants vide legal notice issued through its counsel, to pay a sum
of Rs.29,65,841.71 (Twenty Nine Lakhs sixty five thousands eight
hundred fourty one and paise seventy one only) alongwith interest @
24% per annum within 15 days of the receipt of demand notice.
12.

At

the

time

of

institution

of

the

suit

a

sum

of

Rs.30,31,949.71 along with interest @ 24% being Rs.4,85,111.95 was
due and payable. Thus, a sum of Rs.35,17,061.66 is due and payable
by the defendant.
DECISION AND REASONS.
13.

I have perused the averments made in the plaint and the

documents filed on record which have been exhibited as Annexure P-1
to P-16.
14.

The plaintiff has placed on record copies of its Articles and

Memorandum of Association and the certificate of incorporation as
well as copy of the special power of attorney in favour of B.Gururaj,
General Manager, Legal and Company Secretary inter alia authorising
him to institute legal proceedings, sign and verify vakalatnamas,
plaints and other related documents on behalf of the plaintiff

company. Since there is no opposition to the suit and no objection has
been taken to either of these documents.
15.

The original statement of accounts maintained by the plaintiff

in respect of the defendants are exhibits P-1 to P-3 and corroborate
the stand taken by the plaintiff with regard to the outstanding dues
owed to the plaintiff as stated in para 6 hereinabove.
dated 30.12.2000 is a letter issued by
Delhi, i.e

Exhibit P-7

M/s. Champion Sales, New

defendant no.4 acknowledging liability to the tune of

Rs.18,25,901/-.

Exhibit P-8 is a letter written by the plaintiff on

15.1.2001 to M/s. Champion Sales, defendant no.4 requiring the said
defendant to furnish the sales tax forms, failing which the said
defendant was to be held responsible for payment of sales tax amount
of Rs.1,82,772/-. Exhibit P-9 is another communication of the plaintiff
to M/s. Champion Sales, defendant no.4 demanding outstanding

payment of Rs.15 lakhs would be cleared in the months of June and

and

representing that the defendants would pay the amounts as soon as
they are able to dispose of their property.

is

another

acknowledgment

Exhibit P-13 dated
of

defendant

no.5,

acknowledging outstanding liability of Rs.9,34,439.71 and undertaking
to pay the sum as soon as their property is sold.
16.

The legal notice issued on behalf of the plaintiff dated 5th

October, 2001 is also placed on record along with acknowledgment
cards and postal receipts.

One sealed envelope addressed by the

plaintiff's counsel to M/s. Champion Sales returned with the remark
'left' has also been filed in original on record.
17.

The plaintiff has also filed the list of pending ST 35 forms of a

total invoice value of Rs.19,24,885 on the basis of which the plaintiff
claims

the amount of Rs.1,82772/-.

The assessment order dated

31.3.2001 for the year 1998-1999 as well as the Sales Tax payment
challan of Rs.2,39,140/- has also

been filed on record.

The

assessment order shows that the plaintiffs surrendered sales of
Rs.19,24,885 which corresponds with the total invoice value of the 35
ST forms which the defendants failed to deliver to the plaintiff.
Accordingly the plaintiff was taxed on the said sales. The plaintiff has
also filed on record Exhibits P-14, P-15 and P-16, their office copies of
the invoices whereby the goods had been supplied to the defendants.

18.

Since the suit is based on a written contract for the

recovery of a fixed sum of money/debt and no relief which does not
fall within the ambit of order 37 CPC has been claimed in the plaint,
and the defendant has failed to enter appearance within the time
stipulated for that purpose, the allegations in the plaint are deemed to
be admitted and the plaintiff is entitled to a decree in his favour for
the amount claimed. [See AIR 1998 Del 183; 2002 AIHC 238 (Del)].
19.

In my view the allegations in the plaint which are deemed

to be admitted, sufficiently disclose cause of action against the
defendants to entitle the plaintiff to a decree as prayed for.
20.

In this view of the matter, defendant No. 1 and 3 are liable

to pay a sum of Rs.66,135/- along with pre-suit and pendentelite
interest @ 12% per annum on the said amount from 25.5.2001
onwards. Defendant Nos. 2, 4 and 5 are liable to pay a sum of
Rs.29,65,814.71 (Rs.20,06,375/- + 9,59,439.71) along with pre suit
and pendentelite interest @ 12% per annum on the said amount from
13.7.2001 onwards. A decree be drawn accordingly.
21.

Since, the transaction is commercial in nature, I deem it

appropriate to grant interest @ 12% on the decreetal amount from the
date of the decree till the realisation thereof.

The plaintiff shall be

entitled to costs of Rs.36,700/- being the court fee affixed on the
plaint.
