1.

By this order I propose to dispose of the above suit, filed

under Section 14 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 seeking a direction to
the Arbitrator to file the award dated 20.10.1995 made by the sole
Arbitrator and IA No.8784/1996 (objections to the Award filed by the
petitioner) and IA No.12075/1996 (objections to the Award filed by the

C.S. (OS) No. 2715/1995

respondent).

2.

The Petitioner had entered into an agreement with the

Respondent No.1 for, inter alia, the balance work of construction of
288 LIG houses at Motia Khan including water supply, sanitary
installations

and

internal

development.

Various

disputes

and

differences arose between the parties and the same were referred to
arbitration in terms of the arbitration agreement between the parties.
The learned Arbitrator has rendered his award dealing with the 20
claims raised by the petitioner. The learned Arbitrator has awarded an
amount of Rs.6,90,680/- with simple interest @ 12% p.a. from the
date of the award till the date of the decree or actual payment,
whichever is earlier.
I.A. No. 8784/1996

3.

This application has been filed by the Petitioner

challenging the award in so far as claim Nos.4, 6, 7 and 12 (before
the Arbitrator) are concerned. The material particulars of the project
were as follows:
Estimated Cost

Rs.20,53,894

Tender Cost

Rs.48,88,268

Date of start

10.01.1987

Stipulated date of completion

4.

09.07.1987

The petitioner contends that though the work was to be

completed within the period of six months, the same was prolonged
C.S. (OS) No. 2715/1995

Page 2 of 12

due to delay on part of Respondent No.1 in allowing execution of work
in certain blocks only. In spite of the delays being caused by the
Respondent, the Respondent withheld various amounts due to the
Petitioner in respect of contractual works and extra items carried out
and unjust deductions/reductions were made by the respondent. Even
damages on account of losses attributable to the breach(es) of the
contract by the Respondent were not paid. Escalation costs payable
under clause 10-C were also refused.

5.

On 5.9.2002 the petitioner had contended that there

were calculation mistakes in the award as far as claim 4 & 6 were
concerned. Accordingly the court had asked the respondent to check
up if there were calculation mistakes. I find on record a statement
signed

by

the

counsel

for

the

respondent

dated

01.04.2003

apparently in compliance of the direction of the Court containing fresh
calculations.
RE: CLAIM NO.4 :
6.

Claim No.4 for Rs.4,90,000/- was founded upon clause

10-C of the agreement. The contention of the claimant/plaintiff was
that the period of completion was six months, which was too short
considering that four storied structures were to be erected. This was
deliberately so fixed to deny the contractor any claim under clause
10CC. The delay in completion was attributed to the respondent DDA.
Between the date of award of the work. i.e. 31.12.1986 and during its

C.S. (OS) No. 2715/1995

Page 3 of 12

prolongation, there were statutory increases in the minimum wages
of labour w.e.f. 1.5.87, 16.3.1988, 1.5.1989, 1.2.1990, 1.8.1990 and
1.2.1991. These increases had not been paid by the DDA. The
Arbitrator, on the basis of letter dated 20.01.1995, which reflected
levy of compensation by the DDA from 27.01.1991 till 22.03.1993
concluded that prior to 27.1.1991 no compensation for delay was
levied and therefore, the contractor was entitled to claim the
statutory escalation in labour rates for that period. He therefore,
allowed the claim of the claimant for Rs.2,09,828.84.

7.

The grievance of the claimant is that the Arbitrator has

disallowed the claim for Rs.66,898.16 on the basis of the statement
(R-98) furnished by the Respondent wherein they had checked and
verified the claims made by the claimant/contractor under clause
10C. The learned Arbitrator had ignored the errors and discrepancies
committed by the said Respondent in making the calculations in R-98.
The claimant has filed his detailed calculations as Annexure P-1 to the
application reflecting the total amount that, according to him, should
have been allowed as Rs.2,76,727.00

8.

The statement dated 1.4.2003 handed over by the

counsel for the respondent in pursuance to the directions issued by
the court reflects that some calculation mistake has been made. It is
stated that amount in respect of items No.8.6, 8.7 and 9.1 & 9.2 has
been omitted and if the same is included the total amount comes to

C.S. (OS) No. 2715/1995

Page 4 of 12

Rs.2,15,883.53. Hence, calculation mistake is manifest. Due to the
aforesaid error the award on claim No.4 is set aside and remanded
back to the Arbitrator for checking the alleged calculation errors and
discrepancies in R-98 and to recompute the amount admissible under
clause 10C of the contract.

RE: CLAIM NO.6
9.

Claim No.6 pertains to a claim of Rs.80,000/- being the

amount illegally withheld from the various running account bills due
to

non-sanctioning

of

the

extra/substituted

item

for

double

scaffolding. The learned Arbitrator records that both parties agreed
that extra item of double scaffolding etc had not been sanctioned. He
rejected the respondents contention, that on the issue of the rates for
this extra item the SE's decision was final, on the ground that the said
extra item was not sanctioned and once the matter was already in
arbitration, there was no question of the respondent sanctioning the
same. He worked out the rate for double scaffholding at Rs.6.07 per
sq. meter as opposed to the plaintiffs claim of Rs.19.56 per sq. meter,
and therefore, held that over payment had been made to the plaintiff
contractor and the amount of Rs.10,773/- was to be paid by the
contractor. The grievance of the plaintiff is that the Arbitrator ignored
the admitted rate of Rs.19.56 sq. meter in respect of the extra item of
scaffholding which is to be found in exhibit

R-88 and letters of

Respondent No. 1 dated 21.05.1990 and 18.09.1993. It is also pointed
out that while arriving at the awarded rate of Rs.6.07 per sq. meter
C.S. (OS) No. 2715/1995

Page 5 of 12

the component of bandhani (rope) has been wrongly calculated, as
instead of the schedule rate of '0.67', the Arbitrator has calculated the
component at a rate of '0.067', which is an error and the award on
this claim is liable to be set aside. It appears there is force in the
submission of the petitioner.

The Arbitrator appears to have

committed a material error in calculating the component of bandhani
(rope) by treating the rate per sq. meter as '0.067', though it ought to
have been '0.67'. Therefore, the award is erroneous so far as Claim
No. 6 is concerned, and it needs to be set aside and remanded back
to the Arbitrator for recalculation.

RE: CLAIM NO.7
10.

Claim No.7 was made for Rs.10.50 lakhs on account of

extra rate claimed from time to time due to rise in market rates due
to prolongation of the contract beyond the stipulated date of
completion.

11.

The learned Arbitrator allowed this claim to the extent

of Rs.37,355/-. The Arbitrator, while upholding the contention of the
claimant that the delay was attributable to the Respondent and the
claimant was entitled to increase as per clause 10-C of the contract,
based his calculations on the CPWD cost index. Upto 30.11.1990, he
holds nothing is payable. After providing for a reasonable increase of
10%, the learned Arbitrator worked out the increase at 33%. This
increase in rates was applied in respect of 29.50% of the work, which
C.S. (OS) No. 2715/1995

Page 6 of 12

translated to 9.735% increase. This was calculated at Rs.37,355/-.

12.

The grievance of the claimant is that the Arbitrator

while calculating the increase omitted the component of increase in
the costs of bricks even though he specifically notes that the claimant
would be entitled to an increase in the rates of the brick component
before proceeding to calculate the increase. Furthermore, no reasons
have been cited by the learned Arbitrator for rejecting the claim of
increase for the period 15.8.1987 to 30.11.1990.

13.

The grievance of the Petitioner as expressed in

relation to Claim No.7 appears to be justified.

The Arbitrator has

disallowed the claim of increase in rates prior to 30.11.1990 on the
basis that the CPWD rates did not undergo a substantial increase from
16.06.1987 onwards uptill 30.11.1990. However, on the face of the
award this finding is erroneous. The learned Arbitrator has calculated
the increase in the rates of various elements like sand aggregate,
timber as follows:

“The increase are on 16/6/87 5.97 + 8.26 + 26.11

=

40.34

This will be considered as base.
From 1/11/89

5.87 + 6.77 + 28.25
1.36%

=

40.89

From 30/10/89

5.57 + 7.34 + 28.67
3.07%

=

41.58

From 30/11/90

6.58 + 9.80 + 41.31

=

57.69

57.69
= 43% increase”
40.34
C.S. (OS) No. 2715/1995

Page 7 of 12

14.

This calculation shows an increase in the rates by 43%.

While the Arbitrator may be right in observing that every contractor
keeps some margin for increase in rates of 5 to 10%, in the present
case, the increase upto 30.11.1990 worked out to 43%.

It was,

therefore, not proper to deny the increase in the rates upto
30.11.1990.

From the aforesaid tabulation it appears that after

31.10.1989 there is a substantial jump in the rates. The base rate as
on 16.06.1987 is calculated at 40.34.

As on 31.10.1989 it is

calculated at 41.58. However, the rate as on 30.11.1990 is calculated
at 57.69. Therefore, in my view the petitioner contractor should have
been allowed escalation after 31.10.1989.

15.

From the award it is seen that the learned Arbitrator

has observed that the contractor is entitled to increase in cost of
bricks and wages of labour. However, from the calculation it is not
clear whether the Arbitrator has omitted to take into account the
increase in the cost of the bricks.

16.

In view of the aforesaid, the award in relation to claim

No.7 is set aside and the said claim is remanded back to calculate the
increase in rates of the items, other than cement and steel and any
other item issued from the stores, from 01.11.1989 onwards.

The

learned Arbitrator shall also specifically deal with the increase in the
rates of bricks from 01.11.1989 onwards, to which the petitioner has
been held to entitled.
C.S. (OS) No. 2715/1995

RE: CLAIM NO.12

17.

Claim No.12 was made for Rs.8,10,000/- on account of

payments claimed under clause 12A of the agreement, which states
that maximum deviation in the work that can be ordered is upto 50%.
The amount of any additional item not already included in the
contract shall not exceed 10% of the deviation limit as per clause
12(vi) of the agreement. The overall deviation is Rs.24,44,134/- and
10% of the same comes to Rs.2,44,413. The Arbitrator found that the
rates of various items, which were calculated at 55% above the
quoted rates, were more or less constant till 30.11.1990. After
calculating the deviation, keeping in mind the award already made on
the other claims he admitted the claim of Rs.11,057/- only. The
grievance of the Petitioner is that the Arbitrator ignored exhibit C-67
and wrongly took the contractor's enhancement at 149% above while
dealing with this claim whereas earlier he had taken the same to be
138%.

18.

As far as Claim No.12 is concerned, the reasoning

adopted by the learned Arbitrator cannot be faulted with. He notes
that deviation in the trade of brick works are in all items except for
item in triangular shape. While discussion this claim, he observes as
follows:
“Claimant has demanded higher rates at 55%
above quoted rates.
C.S. (OS) No. 2715/1995

Page 9 of 12

This is brickwork and the claimant is Claim
No.4 has claimed 10-C which will include
elements of bricks labour etc. and its
increase. The cement is issued at fixed rates.
Thus elements of sand only will call for
increase. As per award in Claim No.7 it will be
seen that on 30/11/90 it is almost constant.
At best the claimant would be entitled to get
10% which he was to absorb under 10-C
i.e. 29.50 x 10% = 2.95%
Therefore 374836 x 2.95% = 11057/Respondent is to pay Rs.11,057/- against this
claim to claimant.”
19.

From the aforesaid, it is clear that the learned

Arbitrator has taken note of the fact that the increase in the rates of
bricks, labour etc. have already been considered under claim No.4.
The contractor could not have asked for increase in the rates of any
item twice over, once under clause 10C and again under clause 12 &
12A. However, since the date 30.11.1990 has been pushed back by
me to 30.10.1989, while maintaining the basis and reasoning of the
learned Arbitrator, this claim is also remanded back to the learned
Arbitrator for recalculation.

20.

IA No.8784/1996 is disposed off accordingly.

I.A. No. 12075/1996

21.

This application contains the objections raised by the

Respondent No.1 against the award. Ground No. A to D are formal
objections which have no substance and are therefore outrightly
C.S. (OS) No. 2715/1995

Page 10 of 12

rejected. The arbitrator after hearing the contentions of the parties
and going through the documents exhibited concluded that even upto
August, 1989 the respondent were in a state of indecision as to
foundation shaft for block 27, though the SE had stopped work in
November, 1987. This was but an act to prevent the contractor from
carrying out his contractual obligations, which saddled the claimant
with increased operational cost. Once the Arbitrator has decided on
merits that the delay was attributable to the Respondent, this court
cannot go into that issue in these proceedings.

Therefore, the

objections of the respondent in relation to award in respect of claims
No.4,7 and 9 are also liable to be rejected. As far as claim No.10 and
12 are concerned, the respondent has again tried to challenge the
calculations of the Arbitrator as wrong without substantiating how the
Arbitrator has erred in making the calculations. These grounds are,
therefore, also devoid of any merits.

22.

I have also gone through the remaining objections and

the award. These objections are also based on merits and seek to
challenge the finding of facts of the Arbitrator and the counsel for the
Respondent has not been able to point out any error apparent on the
face of the record, as far as the award is sought to be challenged in
these objections.

23.

In view thereof

I.A. No. 12075/1996 is dismissed as

devoid of any merits.

C.S. (OS) No. 2715/1995

Page 11 of 12

24.

The award is, therefore, set aside in relation to claim

Nos.4, 6, 7 and 12 and the reference remanded back to the learned
Arbitrator to reconsider the said claims in the light of the observations
contained hereinabove. The remaining award is made a 'Rule' of the
Court and a decree is passed in terms thereof. The plaintiff shall be
entitled to interest @ 12% per annum on the principal amount from
the date of the award till the date of actual payment. Parties are left
to bear their respective costs.
