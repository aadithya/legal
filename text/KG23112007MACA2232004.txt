KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
The present appeal is preferred against the award of
MAC APP.No.223/2004

page 1 of 6

the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal dated 21.2.2004.
The factual scenario in the nutshell are as follows:On 10.12.97, deceased Sh.Ashok Kumar was going
to his house after closing his shop at Peeragarhi on his twowheeler scooter bearing registration No. DL 2S F 9578 along
with his elder brother Mr.Pradeep Kumar as pillion rider. At
about 7.45 a.m. when they reached Rohtak Road, Opposite
Transport Centre, Near Petrol Pump, a blue line bus bearing
registration No. DL 1P 2917, driven in a rash and negligent
manner by Shri Satish Kumar hit the aforesaid two wheeler
scooter from behind and as a result, both of them fell down and
Sh. Ashok Kumar died on the accident spot while Sh. Pradeep
Kumar received injuries on his legs besides multiple abrasions.
Two claim petitions were filed on 3.2.98 and were disposed of
by way of a common award dated 21.2.2004. Aggrieved with
the said award, present appeal has been preferred by the
appellant insurance company.
By way of this appeal, the appellant has assailed the

MAC APP.No.223/2004

page 2 of 6

finding of the Tribunal, primarily on the ground that the
Tribunal has wrongly taken into consideration the gross profit
of the firm for arriving at the income of the deceased who was
one of the partners in M/s.Deepak Iron Store. The contention
of the counsel for the appellant, Mr.L.K. Tyagi, is that it is only
the net profit of the partner which should have been taken into
consideration for calculating the dependency and not the gross
profit.
Per contra Mr. O.P. Gupta, counsel for the
respondent contends that there is no illegality in the impugned
award and the Tribunal has rightly taken into consideration the
share of the deceased partner for determining the loss of
dependency. Counsel for the respondent contends that

the

gross profit earned by a partner in itself is an income as from
the gross profit he makes

expenditure under many sundry

heads including petrol and other basic facilities.
I have heard the counsel for the parties and perused
the record. The deceased Ashok Kumar was a partner in M/s.

MAC APP.No.223/2004

page 3 of 6

Deepak Iron Store and as per the balance sheet

placed on

record, he was earning a gross profit of Rs.3,22,728/- from the
said firm. The deceased Mr. Ashok Kumar during the relevant
period has drawn a sum of Rs.28,450/- out of the gross profit of
the firm and he was also having monthly remuneration of
Rs.900/- . Since the balance sheet placed on record does not
give a clear picture of the exact earnings of the deceased
partner, therefore, it would be appropriate to take the minimum
wages as were applicable on the relevant date of the accident for
determining the loss of income of the dependents.
The accident in the present case had occurred on
10.12.97 and on

the said date the minimum wages for a

matriculate person were Rs.2232/-. The deceased was 35 years
of age on the date of the accident and therefore the appropriate
multiplier as laid down in the Second Schedule is 16. The
minimum wages as fixed under the Minimum Wages Act are
increased twice in a year by the Government. After taking into
consideration the rise in the price index and inflation as well

MAC APP.No.223/2004

page 4 of 6

as other economic factors, the Tribunal has observed that in a
period of 10 years minimum wages get increased to almost
double of the amount.

Since the multiplier of 16 is being

applied in the present case, therefore, the said average income
of minimum wages for the year 1997 shall be doubled to
Rs.4464/- and taking the average of the same, the income
would come to Rs.3,348/- per month. Applying the multiplier
of 16 and making 1/3rd deductions towards personal expenses,
loss of income towards dependency of the family would come to
Rs.4,28,544/-

The

Tribunal

has

granted

Rs.9,52,000/- towards loss of dependency.
modified

to Rs.4.28,544/- . Besides

a

sum

of

The same is

the said amount the

Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.30,000/- towards general
damages comprising of funeral expenses, loss of consortium
and loss of love and affection etc.

The said amount of

compensation towards general damages is already on the higher
side and therefore, the same is not being interfered with.
In the light of the above discussion, the respondent

MAC APP.No.223/2004

page 5 of 6

now shall be entitled to total amount of Rs.4,58,544/-. Counsel
for the appellant states that in compliance of the direction of
this Court, 50% of the award amount has already been released
in favour of the respondents/claimants and since the balance
amount was under stay, therefore, with the above modification
the remaining amount shall now be paid by the appellant to the
respondents/claimants with up-to-date interest @6% per
annum only on the differential amount.
At the oral request of counsel for the appellant, let
an amount of Rs.25,000/- which was deposited by the appellant
towards statutory deposit, be released in favour of the
appellant.

With these directions, appeal stands disposed

of.
