1.

The present appeal is under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act

read with order XLIII CPC against impugned order dated 16.01.2006
passed by learned Single Judge in the Arbitration case whereby the
arbitration award dated 11.07.1996 has been made rule of the Court and
decree has been ordered to be drawn up accordingly.
2.

Briefly the facts leading to the filing of the present appeal are

as under:
The appellant was awarded contract of removal of carcasses
from the city by the respondent/MCD through intervention of the Court for
which the highest bid of the appellant was of Rs.34 lacs. The contract was
FAO(S) No.109/2006

Page No.1 of 7

for one year duration i.e. from 01.04.1993 to 31.03.1994. Some disputes
arose about the payment which were allegedly to be made by the appellant
to the MCD. The appellant did not make the payment and accordingly
respondent/MCD invoked arbitration clause 14 in the agreement and
appointed Mr. S.M. Husnain, the then Chief Engineer as arbitrator vide
order dated 02.06.1994. After retirement of Shri Husnain, on attaining the
age of superannuation, he resigned as the arbitrator vide his letter dated
18.07.1995 and in his place Mr. C.M. Vij, Chief Engineer was appointed as
the sole arbitrator. The Chief Engineer entered upon the reference vide
letter dated 02.01.1996 and concluded the arbitration proceedings on
22.05.1996 requiring the parties to file authorities with reference to
submission made by them and gave them fifteen days' time. No authorities
were filed by the parties. After considering the claims and hearing the
parties, the arbitrator directed the appellant to pay a sum of Rs.5,72,000/along with interest @ 12% per annum from 13.06.1994 upto the date of
payment to respondent/MCD. He also directed the respondent/MCD to
refund security deposit to the appellant after making admissible recoveries,
if any, as per terms and conditions of agreement dated 18.01.1994. The
award was filed before the Court and was registered as CS(OS) No.348A/1997. Notice of award was issued to both the parties. The appellant
filed objections against the award dated 11.07.1006. The main objection
raised before the learned Single Judge was that the appellant was not
FAO(S) No.109/2006

Page No.2 of 7

allowed to lift carcasses for the complete period of contract as such
appellant was

required to pay balance amount as is directed by the

arbitrator. Learned counsel for appellant further raised the objection that
the award was non-speaking one and that the appointment of arbitrator was
illegal and the matter was to be referred to Registrar of Societies. After
hearing learned counsel for the parties and perusing the material on record
learned Single Judge dismissed the Objections. Consequently award was
made rule of the court and decree was ordered to be drawn up and suit was
disposed off accordingly. Aggrieved with the aforesaid order/judgment
dated 16.01.2006 of learned Single Judge present appeal is filed.
3.

We have heard Shri A.S. Gambhir, learned counsel for

appellant and Shri Anoop Bagai, learned counsel for respondent and
perused the record.
4.

Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that the

arbitrator committed manifest illegality in awarding the complete amount
of Rs.34 lacs for the contract even though the appellant society could not
lift carcases between the period 01.04.1993 to 19.04.1993 as it was
awarded the contract only on 20.04.1993, thereafter between 23.04.1993 to
29.04.1993 on account of stay obtained by one Bhoop Singh from the court
of Sub Judge and from September 1993 to 03.01.1994 on account of
alleged collusion between Gulab Singh and MCD. Learned counsel further
contended that the appointment of arbitrator was illegal as the dispute ought
FAO(S) No.109/2006

Page No.3 of 7

to have been referred to Registrar under Cooperative Societies Act and the
rules. It is prayed that the record be called and the impugned
order/judgment dated 16.1.2006 passed by the learned Single Judge be set
aside. It is further prayed that award dated 11.7.1996 be quashed and
counter claim of Rs.9 lacs along with interest @ 18% per annum be
allowed and respondent be directed to pay the same from 17.10.94 up to the
date of payment.
5.

On the other hand, it is contended on behalf of the respondent

the order of learned Single Judge is legal and valid in all respects and does
not call for any interference by this Court.
6.

Arbitration is the judicial forum decided by the parties on

their own volition. This Court is not to sit in appeal over the conclusions of
the arbitrator. In an appeal under Section 39 of Arbitration Act, 1940
jurisdiction of this Court is limited to parameters set out under Section 30
of the Arbitration Act i.e. (a) when arbitrator has misconducted himself or
the proceedings (b) an award has been made after issue of an order by the
court superseding the arbitration and (c) when an award has been
improperly procured or is otherwise invalid.
7.

We have considered the contentions raised. The contentions raised

are based on facts. Perusal of the record shows that same have been raised
before learned arbitrator also. The award passed by learned arbitrator is
non-speaking one.
FAO(S) No.109/2006

Under the Arbitration Act, 1940 arbitrator is not
Page No.4 of 7

obliged to give reasons in passing the award. Since in the present case
there is a non-speaking award it will be difficult for this Court to assess the
decision making process of the arbitrator. However, there is sufficient
material on record to show that finding arrived at by the arbitrator in the
award dated 11.07.1996 cannot be considered as unreasonable in any
manner. Even before the payments were made by the appellant society it
had been made aware by the letter dated 20.04.1993 that the duration of the
contract was up to 31.03.1994 for a total sum of Rs.34 lacs. The appellant
made the payment subsequently.

It may not now be possible for the

appellant to turn around and allege that the contract was awarded only on
20.04.1993, as such appellant is not liable to pay for the period 01.04.1993
to 19.04.1993.

Insofar as the period of 23.04.1993 to 29.04.1994 is

concerned it may be noticed that the stay had been obtained by a third party
for which no fault can be found with the respondent. Moreover, as noted
by the learned Single Judge, the appellant made further payments in
pursuance of the contract even after 29.04.1993. There is nothing on record
before us that these subsequent payments were made under any objection.
For the period September 1993 to December 1993, the case of appellant is
that though the contract was between appellant and respondent/MCD,
respondent/MCD permitted one Gulab Singh to remove carcases.

It is

alleged that Gulab Singh was not even a member of appellant society. It is
further alleged that Gulab Singh had even deposited a sum of Rs.5 lacs with
FAO(S) No.109/2006

Page No.5 of 7

respondent /MCD. It may be noted that in the reply to claim filed by
appellant before arbitrator no such allegations are made. The contention
raised has no force.
8.

As regards contention that the matter should have been referred to

Registrar under the Cooperative Societies Act is concerned, the same has
also been examined.

We are in agreement with the learned Single Judge

that as no such plea was taken before the arbitrator, it would not now be
open for the appellant to raise this plea. Proceedings remained pending
before the arbitrator for a long time. There is nothing on record to show
that the appellant was willing to refer the matter to the Registrar as is
alleged.
9.

There is nothing on record to show that there are errors apparent on

the record and that the arbitrator committed gross misconduct.

The

appellant has failed to point out any reason for this Court to interfere with
judgment of learned Single Judge. Impugned judgment dated 16.01.2006 of
learned Single Judge is, therefore, upheld.
10.

Appeal stands rejected. Parties to bear their own costs.
