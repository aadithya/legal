Page No.1

notice to show cause dated 19th September, 2007
issued under Sections 343 & 344(1) of the Delhi

and

another

notice

to

dated

Section 345(A) of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act,
1957 whereby the respondents have threatened to seal
the property no.201, Okhla Industrial Estate, Phase-III,
New Delhi.
2.

The petitioner has contended that they, under the

lease from the respondent no.3, are occupying the
property since 2002.

The lease in favour of the

petitioner stands extended by an instrument dated 10th
March, 2006. It has been contended that no notice to

respondents

The impugned notices issued by the
are

vague

and

stereotyped

notices

alleging deviation against the sanctioned building plan
without giving any details thereof and threatening the
sealing of the property.
3.

The petitioner has submitted that the landlord of

the premises as well as respondent no.3 has submitted

Page No.2

a representation dated 24th September, 2007 and that
the petitioner has also responded to the same by the
letter dated 1st October, 2007. This representation has
not been considered till date by the MCD.
The writ petition has been necessitated inasmuch
as without giving any heed to the contentions of the
landlord or the petitioner, the respondent has now
issued notice to show cause dated 27th September,
2007 under Section 345(A) of the DMC Act, 1957
threatening the sealing of the property.
4.

Mr. Rajiv Nayar, learned senior counsel for the

petitioner, contends that the notice in a printed format
is stereotyped and wrongly alleges that unauthorised
construction/deviation work is going on in the premises.
It is also stated by the petitioner that the petitioner has
not encroached on any public land and is not misusing
the property. The further submission is that so far as
vague allegations of illegal construction are concerned,
the respondent no.3 has made submissions in this
behalf. The request of the petitioner is that without
consideration of the representation made by the
respondent no.3 and the petitioner, the respondent

nos.1 & 2 ought not to be permitted to effectuate the
threats contained in the notice dated 27th September,
2007.
5.

In view of the facts notice hereinabove, it would

appear that it is the admitted stand of the MCD that it
is still considering the matter under Sections 343 & 344
of the DMC Act, 1957 and is yet to take a final view in
the matter.

No material has been placed before this

court which would support that the petitioner is
undertaking any unauthorised or illegal construction.
The petitioner can be granted no relief so far as any
encroachment on public land is concerned.

Law

mandates that the respondent would consider the
contentions placed before the respondent nos. 1 & 2 by
the respondent no.3 before taking any coercive steps in
terms of the notice issued on 27th September, 2007.
6.

Ms. Smita Shankar, Advocate on instructions of Mr.

R.S. Gupta, Executive Engineer (South Zone), MCD,
submits that the respondent nos.

1 & 2 are giving

hearing to the persons who have made representations
pursuant to the notices issued under Sections 343 &
344 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 and
WP (C) No.7282/2007

these matters are listed tomorrow i.e. 4th October,
2007 .
7.

The respondent no.3 appears to have made a

representation, copy whereof has been annexed in this
writ petition. In these circumstances, it is directed that
the respondent nos.1 & 2 shall grant appropriate
hearing in accordance with law to the respondent no.3.
The petitioner or his authorised representative is
permitted to join the proceedings and assist the

such steps as are available in accordance with law.
