1.

The petitioner in this case is claiming to be in actual cultivatory

physical possession of the land bearing khasra nos.33/23/1 (2-5),
47/4/2 (4-13), 7 (4-0), 13/3 (0-8), 14 (2-8), 15 (7-4), 16 (7-4), 17 (28), 24/2 (2-0), 25/1 (4-8), 25/2 (0-8), 46/11/1 (1-14), 20/2 (1-15), 21/1
(3-0), 21/2 (1-16), 47/6/2 (1-05), 48/5/2 (1-13), 55/11/1 (0-17),
56/1/2(2-8) and 133 Min. (13-10) situated within the revenue estate
of village Devli, Tehsil Mehrauli, in the Union Territory of Delhi
(hereinafter referred to as “land”). The claim of the petitioner is that
by virtue of the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954, Delhi Land Revenue
Act, 1954 and the rules framed thereunder, he has become the
owner/bhumidar of the land.
2.

The petitioner was aggrieved by the action of the respondent in

failing to record the cultivatory possession of the petitioner in the
Cont.Cas.(C) No.718/2004

Page No.1

revenue records after 1982-83 and sought redressal of his grievance
by way of Writ Petition (C) No.3699/1991 before this court. By an
order passed on 17th January, 1995, the Division Bench of this court
disposed of the writ petition whereby the court directed thus:“We direct the respondents to maintain the
record of rights, including the Annual Register, in
accordance with the provisions of the Delhi Land
Revenue Act and the Delhi Land Revenue Rules, 1962,
without taking into consideration the amendments
carried out to Rules 49, 63 and Form P.5 by virtue of
the Delhi Land Revenue (Sixth Amendment) Rules,
1989, as notified on 30th November, 1989.
The writ petition stands disposed of in the above
terms.”
3.

It is an admitted position that the judgment of this court was

upheld by the Apex Court by its judgment dated 5th May, 2000 passed
in Civil Appeal No.6821/1995 and other connected appeal which is
reported at (2000) 5 SCC 451 Additional District Magistrate
(Revenue), Delhi Administration Vs. Siri Ram. While dismissing
the appeal filed by the revenue authorities, the court had directed
thus:“12. As noticed earlier while preparing record-ofrights under Section 20 of the Land Revenue Act
persons cultivating or others occupying land as
tenure or sub-tenure holder as determined under the
Land Reforms Act have to be specified in the said
register. This has to be done as record-of-rights
would be used for determining the rights and
liabilities of the tenure and sub-tenure-holder under
the Land Reforms Act.”
4.

The admitted position is that the Revenue Authorities have

recorded the cultivatory possession of the petitioner in the revenue
record for the years 1995-1998. They, however, stopped recording the
cultivatory possession of the petitioner thereafter compelling the
petitioner

to assail the action by way of Writ Petition (C)

Cont.Cas.(C) No.718/2004

Page No.2

No.2883/1998.
5.

This writ petition was dismissed by this court which order was

assailed by the petitioner by way of LPA No.377/2002 in the Division
Bench. The appeal of the petitioner was allowed by the Division Bench
by an order dated 13th March, 2002 directing the respondent thus:“Having regard to the submission of learned counsel
for th e appellant and keeping in view the decision of
Ram Swarup Kathuria and Another (supra), we direct
the concerned revenue authority to hold an enquiry
with regard to the issue whether the appellant is in
cultivatory possession of the land in question. In
case the appellant is found to be in possession of the
land, the revenue authority shall act in accordance
with law. Before passing any order the concerned
revenue authority shall hear the appellant, Gaon
Sabha and the Horticulture Department.
With the aforesaid directions, the appeal is
disposed of.”
6.

The petitioner contends that pursuant to this order, the

respondent conducted an enquiry.

It is submitted that the patwari

made a report dated 20th April, 2002 stating that as per the record, the
land in Khasra nos.33/23/1 (2-5), 47/4/2 (4-13), 7 (4-0), 13/3 (0-8), 14
(2-8), 15 (7-4), 16 (7-4), 17 (2-8), 24/2 (2-0), 25/1 (4-8), 25/2 (0-8),
46/11/1 (1-14), 20/2 (1-15), 21/1 (3-0), 21/2 (1-16), 47/6/2 (1-05),
48/5/2 (1-13), 55/11/1 (0-17), 56/1/2(2-8) and 133 Min. (13-20) was
recorded in the name of Gram Sabha. It has further been stated that
the petitioner had sown crop but as the ownership vested with the
Gram Sabha, it should not be recorded in Girdawri.
7.

Based on this report, the petitioner filed WP (C) No.3767/2002 in

which interim orders were passed in favour of the petitioner on 1st
June, 2002. The respondents before the court stated that the land was
found ploughed but the name of the cultivator could not be
ascertained.

In these circumstances, by an order passed on 3 rd

February, 2004, the court passed the following directions:“In view of the aforesaid, I consider it appropriate to
Cont.Cas.(C) No.718/2004

Page No.3

direct the Deputy Commissioner to hold enquiry in
respect of the aforesaid aspect and a site inspection
shall be carried out on 16.02.2004 at 11.00 a.m. so
that the petitioner can be present at site. The Deputy
Commissioner may issue notice to all other parties as
deem appropriate and shall complete the enquiry
within a maximum period of one month from the said
date. In case the petitioner is found in cultivating
possession, needless to say, necessary entries in
accordance with law shall be made.
The writ petition is disposed of with the aforesaid
directions.
Compliance report be filed within 8 weeks.
The Orders dated 10.06.2002 shall continue to
enure for benefit of the petitioner till the aforesaid
enquiry is completed.”
8.

The petitioner has complained that despite these directions and

the report of the revenue authorities, the respondent no.2 failed to
take action in accordance with law and filed a criminal complaint
against the petitioner on 24th February, 2004 alleging trespass by the
petitioner.
9.

This act of approaching the police authority has been complained

of as contumacious by the petitioner.
10.

Perusal of the criminal complained filed by the respondent no.2

shows that the complaint was made by the Deputy Commissioner
(South), M.B. Road, Saket, New Delhi along with the Tehsildar, Hauz
Khas, NewDelhi as well as the Director (Horticulture).

They have

complained that despite the pendency of the enquiry proceedings and
pursuant to the order passed by the court, the petitioner had raised
some unauthorised structure on the subject land and had also dumped
material with the intention to grab the land.
11.

Certainly, there was no prohibition under any orders of the court

against the authorities from taking action against the petitioner for any
illegal acts by it. In any case, this court had also not permitted the
petitioner to raise the construction on the subject land. Admittedly, an
enquiry was pending in respect of the same under orders of this court.
12.

The petitioner has contended that the Deputy Commissioner

Cont.Cas.(C) No.718/2004

Page No.4

(South) examined the matter in terms of the order of this court dated
3rd February, 2004. He thereafter passed an order dated 15th March,
2004 which was assailed by the petitioner by way of writ petition being
Writ Petition (C) No.4738/2004 in this court.
13.

The writ petition was thus disposed of by the court by an order

passed on 5th April, 2004 whereby this court held thus:“In view of the conspectus of the aforesaid fact, it is
apparent that the petitioner is impugning the order
dated 15.03.2004 which is in performance of the
statutory duties by the Deputy Commissioner. The
petitioner first has to avail of the remedies which are
available under the Act. Section 187 of the Act
empowers the Financial Commissioner to decide the
matter in issue and in my considered view the
petitioner
has
to
approach
the
Financial
Commissioner first. Needless to say that in case the
order of the Financial Commissioner is against the
petitioner, a writ petition would be maintainable
before this Court. Needless to say that taking into
consideration the nature of the controversy, the
allegations and the counter allegations, the Financial
Commissioner is expected to call for all the records
and pass an order only thereafter. It will be open to
the petitioner to raise all contentions before the
Financial Commissioner and a speaking order shall be
passed in respect of the same.”
14.

This writ petition was thus disposed of in the above terms by the

court holding that the petitioner was required to avail the remedy
available under the provisions of Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954.
15.

The

petition

filed

by

the

petitioner

before

the

Financial

Commissioner (Delhi) under Section 187 of the Delhi Land Reforms
Act, 1954 assailing the order dated 15th March, 2004 of the Deputy
Commissioner, was registered as case no.74/2004 and dismissed by
an order passed on 20th April, 2004.
16.

The petitioner again challenged the order passed by the Financial

Commissioner by way of Writ Petition (C) No.6333/2004.

This writ

petition was disposed of by the court by an order dated 7th May, 2004
whereby the court set aside the order of the Financial Commissioner
Cont.Cas.(C) No.718/2004

Page No.5

dated 20th April, 2004 holding that the order had been passed
cryptically without recording reasons for the same. The matter was
remanded for fresh adjudication to the financial commissioner. It is an
admitted position that the matter is still pending before the Financial
Commissioner.
17.

By way of the present petition, the petitioner has complained

that actions of the respondents are in violation of the orders dated 17th
January, 1995, 3rd February, 2002 and 3rd February, 2004.

It has

further been urged that the respondents have acted contumaciously in
lodging a criminal complaint based whereon a case has been
registered by the police against the petitioner. The petitioner has also
made a grievance that despite the said order, the respondents have
issued a tender notice dated 2nd July, 2004 for constructing a boundary
wall on the petitioner's land and that despite the said order, the
revenue authorities on the directions of the contemnors, have on 10th
September, 2004, recorded the possession of the Department of
Horticulture over the subject land.
18.

On a careful consideration of the matter, I find that this court, by

virtue of the orders passed on 17th January, 1995, 13th February, 1992
and 3rd February, 2004, directed the respondents to maintain the
record of rights holding the possession on the spot. By an order dated
13th February, 2002, the court directed the authorities to hold enquiry
as to whether the petitioner was in cultivatory possession of the land
in question. It was only upon such a finding that the revenue authority
was required to act in accordance with law.

Thus, there was no

directions that the authorities have to record the possession of the
petitioner irrespective of the result of their enquiry and consideration.
19.

So far as the directions made by the court on 3rd February, 2004

are concerned, I find that the court had directed the Deputy
Commissioner again to hold an enquiry in respect to the petitioner's
claim of cultivatory possession on the land.

The court had also

directed a site inspection and thereafter, upon notice to all parties, the
Deputy Commissioner was required to complete the enquiry into the
Cont.Cas.(C) No.718/2004

Page No.6

petitioner's claim that he was in cultivatory possession and necessary
entries in accordance with law were required to be made.
20.

It is an admitted position on the record laid before this court that

the Deputy Commissioner had concluded that the possession of the
petitioner could not be recorded.

The petitioner has assailed such

order by way of WP (C) No.4738/2004. In these proceedings by the
order dated 5th April, 2004, the court has not accepted the challenge of
the petitioner and has diverted the petitioner to statutory remedy of
an appeal assailing

the order passed by the Deputy Commissioner

based on the result of his enquriy.

Admittedly, the petitioner has

invoked the statutory remedy of a revision against the order of the
Deputy Commissioner which is still pending before the Financial
Commissioner.
21.

From the foregoing, it is evident that the enquiry, as directed,

has been conducted. The petitioner being dissatisfied by the
conclusion reached by the respondents, has assailed the same by way
of the writ petition and thereafter by way of revision petition which is
still pending before the commissioner. In this background, certainly, it
cannot be held that the respondents are in wilful default or violation of
any orders passed by the court.
22.

So far as the petitioner's contention that the respondents have

lodged a complaint with the police authorities against him, is
concerned, I find no restriction against lodging the complaint.
23.

It

now

becomes

necessary

to

deal

with

the

petitioner's

submission that the revenue and the police authorities have found the
petitioner in cultivatory possession on the site.

In this background,

reliance is placed on the report of the patwari dated 1st April, 1998 and
the police reports dated 9th January, 2002 and 22nd January, 2002. So
far as the complaint dated 9th January, 2002 is concerned, it appears
that Mehrauli Block Incharge has made a complaint to SHO to the
effect that the petitioner has ploughed government land with a tractor
behind the back of the government employees.

A complaint was

made that the petitioner was intending to grab
Cont.Cas.(C) No.718/2004

and occupy

Page No.7

government land and a prayer was made to the police to stop the
government land grabbing.
24.

By a second complaint, the same officials have made a complaint

on 22nd January, 2002 to the effect that the petitioner has demolished
the boards of the public park and garden under the Vikas Yojana,
Mehrauli and thrown it away and starting plouging the same with a
tractor.

The complainant had informed the SHO of the Police Station

Sangam Vihar that there were three boards of the garden departments
which had disappeared. A prayer was made to save the government
land from unauthorised occupation.
25.

Having regard to the scheme of the Delhi Land Reforms Act,

1954, the authorities are required to consider the cultivatory
possession of land. The above reports only evidence the respondent's
contentions that the petitioner was attempting to occupy the land.
In any case, this entire issue so far as the merit of the petitioner's
case is concerned, is pending consideration before the Financial
Commissioner who will decide on detailed consideration of the facts
and circumstances of this case.
26.

The claim of the petitioner is pending consideration and the

appropriate statutory remedy in this behalf has been invoked by the
petitioner himself. In the orders relied upon by the petitioner, there is
no adjudication on the merits of the claim and each time, the court left
it to consideration and adjudication by the concerned authorities.
27.

The petitioner has placed reliance on the pronouncement of the

Apex Court in (2004) 13 SCC 746 D.P. Gupta Vs. Parsuram Tiwari
& Another wherein it was held thus:“7. More important the Vice-Chancellor was admittedly
aware of the judgment of the High Court. The order of the
High Court was very categoric. Dr. B. Prasad's services, for
the purposes of promotion and seniority, only started on
12-8-1968. The High Court had categorically noted that
after taking extraordinary leave in the guise of going for
special training, Dr. B. Prasad had taken up a job as a Land
Valuation Officer. The High Court had correctly held that
having taken up a job in some other service, there was no
Cont.Cas.(C) No.718/2004

Page No.8

question of Dr.B . Prasad's retaining a lien on his service in
the University only started when he rejoined on 12-8-1968.
The judgment of the High Court made it very clear that the
decision to take the earlier period of service into reckoning
was not correct and could not be done. Thus, clearly the
break in service could not have been condoned. In view of
these categoric findings and decision of the High Court,
one fails to understand how any reasonable person could
still condone the break in service and pass an order
continuing Dr. B. Prasad as Head of the Department. The
only explanation is that the attempt was to overreach the
judgment of the High Court and to favour Dr. B. Prasad in
spite of the judgment. This being so, in our view, the High
Court has correctly held the Vice-Chancellor guilty of
contempt. We, thus, see no reason to interfere. Criminal
Appeal No.414 of 1997 will accordingly stand dismissed
with costs.”
28.

Reliance is also placed on the pronouncement of the Apex Court

in (2006) 8 SCC 1 Prakash Singh & Others Vs. Union of India &
Others. In this case, the court was concerned with the orders passed
for closure of unlicenced sawmills, veneer and plywood Industries and
permission

to

these

units

granted

by

the

State

Government

deliberately, consciously and being fully aware of the orders of the
Supreme Court with the sole motive of favouring those units to avoid
the enforcement of the orders of the Supreme Court. Thus, the six
units were permitted to operate in direct contravention of the orders of
the court. It was in this background that the court observed thus:“Disobedience of this Court's order strikes at the very root of
the rule of law on which the judicial system rests. The rule
of law is the the foundation of a democratic society.
Judiciary is the guardian of the rule of law. Hence, it is not
only the third pillar but also the central pillar of the
democratic State. If the judiciary is to perform its duties and
functions effectively and remain true to the spirit with which
they are sacredly entrusted to it, the dignity and authority of
the courts have to be respected and protected at all costs.
Otherwise, the very cornerstone of our constitutional
scheme will give way and with it will disappear the rule fo
law and the civilised life in the society. That is why it is
imperative and invariable that courts' orders are to be
followed and complied with.”
Cont.Cas.(C) No.718/2004

Page No.9

29.

Before this court, the petitioner has not been able to point out

any act of the respondent which would even indicate mensrea to
override any orders of the court. As noticed above, the court had itself
directed consideration and decision by the respondents. The decision
taken has been assailed by the petitioners in appropriate proceedings
in compliance of statutory provisions.
In this view of the matter, it certainly cannot be held in the
instant case that any action on the part of the respondents was in
willful contempt of any orders passed by this court.
For all the foregoing reasons, I find no merit in this petition which
is dismissed with costs of Rs.20,000/-. Inasmuch as the respondents
are all authorities working with the Government of NCT of Delhi, it is
directed that these costs shall be deposited with the Government of
NCT of Delhi within two weeks from today. Proof of deposit of costs
shall be placed before this court.
