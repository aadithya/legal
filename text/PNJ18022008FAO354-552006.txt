PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Appellants

had

filed

a

suit

for

partition

and

injunction alleging that they were the daughters of late Shri
Khem Chand. They impleaded their 3 brothers and their sister
as defendants 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. It was stated in the
plaint that the suit land measuring 4.5 kila in Khata No.88/54 in
the revenue estate of Village Mundla Khurd, Tehsil Najafgadh,
Delhi was owned by their father and on his death the sons and
the daughters each acquired 1/6th share in the suit land. On

FAO No.354-55/2006

Page No.1 of 8

said basis, alleging that no partition had been effected,
partition was prayed for.
2.

In the written statement filed by the defendants 1, 2

and 3 i.e. the brothers, it was stated that Khem Chand expired
on 10.6.1993 and as per the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954
succession to the holding being governed under Section 50
thereof, as sons, they alone were entitled to succeed to the
holding since their sisters were married. Thus, entitlement of
the plaintiffs was denied. It was stated that on death of the
father the suit lands were mutated in the names of the 3 sons.
It was alleged that the mutation entry had attained finality.
Lastly, it was urged that right, if any, was to seek partition of
the suit land before the revenue authorities.

It was pleaded

that by virtue of Section 185 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act,
1954 the civil court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit for
the reason under Section 55 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act a
Bhumidar was entitled to sue for partition and as per entry at
serial No.11 of the Ist Schedule to the Act the court of Revenue
Assistant was the court of competent jurisdiction.
3.

In replication filed by the appellants it was pleaded

that by virtue of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005,
since Sub-Section 2 to Section 4 of the Hindu Succession Act,
1956 was deleted, succession to the holding of late Khem
FAO No.354-55/2006

Page No.2 of 8

Chand had to be as per the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. It was
further stated that the provisions of the Delhi Land Reforms Act
do not apply to the suit land.
4.

By and under the impugned order learned Trial

Judge has found a prima facie case against the plaintiffs and in
favour of defendants No.1 to 3 on account of the fact it has
been held that the succession opened when Khem Chand died
in the year 1993 and as per law then applicable succession was
in favour of the sons. Holding no prima facie case in favour of
the appellants on the maintainability of the suit, injunction has
been declined.
5.

Section 4 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 as

originally enacted read as under :“4.Over-riding effect of Act.-(1)Save as
otherwise expressly provided in this Act,(a) any text, rule or interpretation of
Hindu law or any custom or usage as part
of that law in force immediately before the
commencement of this Act shall cease to
have effect with respect to any matter for
which provision is made in this Act;
(b) any other law in force immediately
before the commencement of this Act shall
cease to apply to Hindus in so far as it is
inconsistent with any of the provisions
contained in this Act.
2.
For the removal of doubts it is hereby
declared that nothing contained in this Act
shall be deemed to affect the provision of
FAO No.354-55/2006

Page No.3 of 8

any law for the time being in force
providing
for
the
prevention
of
fragmentation of agricultural holdings or
for the fixation of ceilings or for the
devolution of tenancy rights in respect of
such holdings.”
6.

Section 50 of the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954

reads as under :“50. General order of succession from
males.- Subject to the provisions of
section 48 and 52, when a Bhumidar or
Asami being a male dies, his interest in his
holding shall devolve in accordance with
the order of the succession given below:
(a) male lineal descendants in the male
line of the descent:
Provided that no member of this class
shall inherit if any male descendant
between him and the deceased is alive:
Provided further that the son or sons of a
predeceased son howsoever low shall
inherit the share which would have
devolved upon the deceased if he had
been then alive;
(b)

widow;

(c)

father;

(d)

mother, being a widow;

(e)

step mother, being a widow;

(f)

father's father;

(g)

father's mother, being a widow;

(h) widow of a male lineal descendant
in the male line of descent;

(i)
brother being the son of same
father as the deceased;
(j)

unmarried sister;

(k) brother's son, the brother having
been son of the same father as the
deceased;
(l)

father's father's son;

(m) brother's son's son;

Due to Sub-Section 2 to Section 4 of the Hindu

Succession Act, 1956 the rule of succession stipulated under
the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 was subject to any law for the
time being in force relating to agricultural holdings.

Thus, if

succession to an agricultural holding was stipulated in any local
law applicable to an agricultural holding, provisions thereof
would apply relating to devolution of interest in a holding. The
effect of deletion of Sub-Section 2 to Section 4 of the Hindu
Succession Act, 1956 due to the promulgation of the Hindu
Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 is that with effect from the
date when the Amending Act was promulgated succession
would be as per the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.
8.

Prima facie, the Amending Act of 2005 cannot be

read retrospectively as the Amending Act has not been given a
FAO No.354-55/2006

Page No.5 of 8

retrospective operation. Meaning thereby, successions which
had taken place prior to the promulgation of the Amendment
Act of 2005 cannot be disturbed.
9.

Section 3 of the Amending Act has substituted the

existing Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act. One gets a clue
of the legislative intent when one looks at Sub-Section 3 of
Section 6, as amended. It stipulates that where a Hindu dies
after

the

commencement

of

the

Hindu

Succession

(Amendment) Act, 2005 his interest in the property of a joint
family

governed

by

Mitakshara

Law

shall

devolve

by

testamentary or intestate succession and not by survivorship.
A daughter is given a share equal to that of a son.
10.

In respect of the co-parcenery property the right of

a daughter to receive a share equal to that of a son applies
only if the death of male Hindu is after commencement of the
Amendment Act, 2005.
11.

Thus, the prima facie view recorded by the learned

Trial Judge is correct.
12.

On the issue whether the Delhi Land Reforms Act

was or was not attracted to the suit land, suffice would it be to
state that in the plaint there are no averments that the land is
not governed by the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954.

taken

in

Page No.6 of 8

unequivocal terms that the land, being agricultural land, is
governed by the Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954. In replication
filed by the appellants there is a bald denial to the pleas in the
written statement pertaining to the applicability of the Delhi
Land Reforms Act.
13.

Thus, appellants have prima facie no case to

establish that the Delhi Land Reforms Act did not apply to the
suit land. My prima facie reasoning is reinforced on account of
the plea in the plaint itself where reference is made to the land
with a reference to the measurement in kilas and entry in the
khata khatoni which entries are maintained only in respect of
the agricultural lands.
14.

I may note that at the hearing an attempt was made

to urge that as of today industries have been set up around the
suit land and that the land is urbanized. I am afraid, this issue
cannot be looked into at this stage in the absence of adequate
pleadings on the subject.

Secondly, succession took place

when Khem Chand died in the year 1993. Issue of inheritance
in relation to the land has to be determined with respect to the
nature of the land when Khem Chand died. Needless to state,
once inheritance acquires finality as per law, unless there is a
retrospective amendment to the law, vested rights cannot be
taken away.

15.

Be that as it may, since I am dealing with an issue

pertaining to an interim injunction I need not express any
conclusive opinion lest case of the parties is prejudiced at the
trial.
16.

The view taken by the learned Trial Judge is

reasonable and probable.
17.

I find no merits in the appeal.

18.

Before concluding I may note that nothing stated in

the present order would be treated as a conclusive finding of
this Court for the reason observations are being made with
respect to an interim application filed by the appellants.
Learned Trial Judge would decide the suit in light of the
evidence led and law applicable.
19.

Appeal is dismissed.

20.

No costs.

21.

LCR be returned forthwith.
