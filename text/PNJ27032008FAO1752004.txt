PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Heard learned counsel for the parties.

2.

The appellant is aggrieved by the fact that appellant's

application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC has been dismissed vide
impugned order dated 21.5.2004.
3.

Facts relevant for determination in the instant appeal are

that the respondent filed a suit for recovery against the
appellant on the Original Side of the Delhi High Court for the

FAO.No.175/04

page 1 of 7

reason when suit was filed pecuniary jurisdiction relatable to
the claim was of the Delhi High Court.

Impleaded as a

defendant, appellant was duly served with summons in the
suit.

A written statement was filed.

Issues were struck.

19.2.2003 was the date notified for plaintiff's evidence.

On

said date, none appeared for the appellant in spite of the fact
that the matter was called out twice.

The appellant was

accordingly proceeded against ex-parte with a direction to the
plaintiff to lead evidence by affidavit.

The matter was

adjourned to 19.5.2003. On said date Presiding Officer was on
leave. The Reader attached to the Court adjourned the matter
to 19.8.2003.
4.

As per order sheet dated 19.5.2003 presence of one

S.N.Pandey has been recorded as the counsel for the plaintiff.
But as a matter of fact, a fact asserted by the appellant
himself, Sh.S.N.Pandey was counsel for the appellant and his
presence was wrongly marked as that for the plaintiff. Meaning
thereby, that on 19.5.2003 counsel for the appellant was
present when the Reader of the court adjourned the matter for
19.8.2003.
5.

On 19.8.2003 Shri H.S.Pandey, Advocate appeared

for the defendant. Shri O.P.Singh, Advocate appeared for the
plaintiff.

In the interregnum, i.e. between 19.5.2003 and

FAO.No.175/04

page 2 of 7

19.8.2003 the pecuniary jurisdiction of civil courts in Delhi was
changed.

For money claims upto Rs.3 lacs jurisdiction was

vested in Civil Judges.

Beyond 3 lacs and up to Rs.20 lacs

jurisdiction was vested in the District Judge. Beyond 20 lacs
jurisdiction continued to be of the Delhi High Court. The sum
claimed in the suit being Rs.8,92,022/-, an order was passed on
19.8.2003 directing that the suit be transferred to the learned
District Judge.

Parties were directed to appear before the

learned District Judge on 5.11.2003.
6.

It is obvious that Shri H.S.Pandey who appeared for

the appellant on 19.8.2003 had notice of not only the suit
being transferred to the District Judge but was also notified
that parties had to appear before the learned District Judge on
5.11.2003.
7.

On 5.11.2003 none appeared for the appellant

before the learned District Judge. Counsel appeared for the
plaintiff. Matter was assigned to a learned Additional District
Judge on same day. The learned Additional District Judge
recorded ex-parte evidence led by the plaintiff and decreed the
suit on 24.2.2004.
8.

Application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC was filed

stating that the court (transferee) ought to have issued a court
notice after suit was transferred.
FAO.No.175/04

It was stated that the
page 3 of 7

appellant bona fide believed that the appellant would receive a
notice from the transferee court.
9.

In response, plaintiff informed the court that there

was no requirement of law that a transferee court has to issue
fresh notice to the parties, more so, when on transfer of a suit,
on account of change in pecuniary jurisdiction date was
notified to appear before the transferee court.

It was

additionally stated that not only on said count defendant has
no cause but additionally there is another count on which
defendant has no cause. The additional count stated was that
when the transferee court required the plaintiff to file ex-parte
affidavit by way of evidence, by way of precaution, under
speed post the plaintiff posted the said affidavit by way of
evidence to the appellant, in caption whereof the name of the
court (transferee) was intimated. It is further urged that in the
said affidavit by way of evidence the next date of hearing i.e.
11.2.2004 was also notified.

A.D. card evidencing receipt of

the affidavit by the appellant was relied upon.
10.

The learned Trial Judge has dismissed appellant's

application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC rejecting both pleas
urged by the appellant.
11.

In view of the fact that when suit was transferred

from the Original Side of the Delhi High Court on 19.8.2003,
FAO.No.175/04

page 4 of 7

next date for appearing before the transferee court i.e.
5.11.2003 was notified in presence of learned counsel for the
parties it has been held that there was no need for the
transferee court to issue fresh notices to either party, more so
for the reason, the appellant had been proceeded against exparte on 19.2.2003 and no application was filed for setting
aside of the said order. Additionally, it has been held that the
appellant would have got knowledge of the suit being listed in
the transferee court when appellant received the postal docket
containing the affidavit by way of evidence filed by the
plaintiff. The learned Judge noted that the A.D. receipt of the
docket transmitted by speed post had been placed on record
by the plaintiff.
12.

Findings pertaining to the second plea of the

appellant as recorded by the learned Trial Judge may be
reproduced. They read as under :“This is not the end of the matter. It is pointed out
by ld. Counsel for the plaintiff that when the plaintiff
filed affidavit by way of evidence, he even sent a
copy of the affidavit to the defendant vide speed
post. The receipt of speed post has already been
placed on record and the address mentioned in the
speed post is the same address which is mentioned
on the affidavit of the defendant.
Under the
circumstances, even when the defendant received
this affidavit, he must have to know that the next
date of hearing is 11.2.2004 and the matter is
pending in this court. Even at that time, no attempt
was made by him to appear in the court and
FAO.No.175/04

page 5 of 7

participate in the proceedings.”
13.

I have gone through the memorandum of appeal.

Indeed, learned counsel for the appellant concedes that in the
entire body of the appeal not a word of explanation nor a
ground has been urged pertaining to the finding of the learned
Trial Judge as noted hereinabove in the preceding para.
14.

In my opinion, said finding which has not been

challenged is enough to hold against the appellant that the
appellant was highly negligent in not pursuing the defence and
that when appellant received the necessary affidavit by way of
evidence intimating the name of the transferee court as also
the next date of hearing, whatever be the previous default, at
least on receipt of the postal docket appellant ought to have
taken remedial measures.
15.

I concur with the view taken by the learned Trial

Judge that no sufficient cause has been shown entitling the
appellant to have the ex-parte decree being recalled.
16.

The appeal is dismissed.

17.

Pursuant to the order dated 31.5.2004 if appellant

has deposited Rs.4.25 lacs in this Court the same would be
paid over by the registry together with accrued interest if any
thereon to the respondent. The cheque would be handed over
to the counsel on record for the respondent. If the amount has
FAO.No.175/04

page 6 of 7

been deposited by means of an FDR the same would be
endorsed in favour of the respondent.
18.

No costs.
