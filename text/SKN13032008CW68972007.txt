ORDER
13.03.2008
The petitioner Ms.Darshana Rani had submitted a tender for allotment of

shop bearing No.G-7, Block No.B-IV, Ground Floor, LSC at Lawrence Road in
February, 2004.

Along with the tender form, she had deposited Rs.98,750/-

towards earnest money.
2.

Bid of the petitioner to purchase of said shop for Rs.3,95,000/- was

accepted and a demand letter dated 15th April, 2004 was issued to the petitioner to
deposit balance amount of Rs.2,96,250/- on or before 14th May, 2004.

The

demand letter specifically states that if payment was not made by 14.5.2004, the
petitioner would be liable to pay 15% compound interest with compounding being
done on the last day of the accounting year. The demand letter further states that
no regularization of allotment is permissible on payment beyond 180 days. In case
entire payment with interest is not made within 180 days, the allotment shall stand
cancelled. The petitioner was also required to calculate interest for a period upto

180 days and deposit the same within the said period. The relevant clauses of the
demand cum allotment letter are as under :“The interest shall be chargeable @ 15%
compounded and compounding shall be done on the last
day of the accounting year of the DDA.
1)
xxxxxxxxx
2)
xxxxxxxxxx
3)
No regularization of allotment is possible beyond
180 days delay in payment. If the complete payment with
interest is not made within this period, the allotment shall
stand cancelled automatically and no refund will be
applicable in such cases.
In case of delay upto 180 days, you may compute the
interest on your own as per above guidelines and make the
payments by using one set of the attached challans.
Kindly note that separate code should be indicated for
principle nad interest in the challan.
Following documents are enclosed which will be required
by you for the making payments / taking possession of the
unit.”
3.

The petitioner has paid the following payments :“DATE

DELAY

18.06.2004
19.06.2004

AMOUNT

35 days
36 days

38 days
180 days”

Thus the petitioner has made total payment of Rs.2,45,000/- within the

aforesaid period of 180 days. The petitioner had not made full payment within
180 days in terms of demand cum allotment letter. The petitioner also did not pay
interest in terms of the said demand cum allotment letter. The petitioner made

another payment of Rs.51,250/- on 15.2.2005. This payment was after delay of
277 days from the date of issue of the allotment letter. The respondent/DDA in
these circumstances has refused to make allotment of the aforesaid shop and has
cancelled the allotment made to the petitioner.
5.

By order dated 5.1.2008, learned counsel for the DDA was asked to take

instructions whether delay beyond 180 days can be condoned or regularized and
whether there are any instances where delay beyond 180 days has been condoned.
Counter affidavit has been filed by DDA on these respects. It is stated that there
is one case in which DDA had condoned delay of 380 days and the Vice-Chairman
had taken the said decision on 28.11.2000. It is further stated in the affidavit that
in no other case, DDA has condoned delay in payment of the principal amount
beyond 180 days but delay in payment of interest beyond the said period can be
condoned. It is stated that this is universally followed and therefore, the tender
terms are specific and clear.
6.

It is pointed out that a similar issue had arisen before this Court in the case

of Har Charan Singh Vs. DDA in WP(C) No.32/2006 , which was decided on 22nd
August, 2006.

The learned Single Judge of this Court noted the terms and

conditions of the tender, which are similar to the terms in the present case and the
writ petition was dismissed holding that delay beyond 180 days cannot be
condoned. Reference was also made to another judgment of this Court in Prem
Rani (Smt) & Ors. Vs. Delhi Development Authority 2005 II AD (Delhi) 376,
where in it was observed as under:-

“11. The Conditions governing the terms of auction are
categorical; although they have no statutory force;
they bind the participants as well as the DDA (the
latter more so, in view of the fact that it is a State
agency required to adhere to its own names). It is
well-settled that non-statutory policies, guidelines and
conditions evolved for the functioning of State
agencies bind such agencies; they can ignore such
conditions only at the peril of violation of Article 14
Raman Dayaraman Shetty Vs. Union of India;
West Bengal State Electricity Board Vs. Patel
Engineering; and Netai Bag Vs. State of West
Bengal;. The DDA was, therefore, bound to give
effect to the terms and conditions governing the
auction.
12. In at least two judgments of the Supreme Court it has
been held that in the absence of any authority to
waive conditions of an auction to the terms governing
an auction, where such conditions have not been
complied with or have been violated, there is no valid
or sanction of tenders (see State of M.P. Vs. Firm
Goberdhan Dass Kailash Nath, 1973(1) SCC 668
and Lakhanpal Vs. State of Orissa, 1976 (4) SCC
660) the matter can be looked at from another
perspective. The terms and conditions of auction as
indeed no rule, empower DDA to waive the criteria
and the stipulations that governing the auctions. In
such a case if the DDA were to in fact waive any
condition, such action would be open to attack on the
ground of arbitrariness.”
7.

In these circumstances, it was held that delay beyond 180 days cannot be

condoned. The Court also noted that the petitioner therein had purchased a shop,
which was purely a commercial venture and therefore, such cases cannot be
compared to allotment of residential plots/flats. The Court opined that DDA has
to function within the parameters prescribed by law and the policies prescribed for
their conduct. Contention of the petitioner therein that in some other cases, DDA

may have accepted the amount beyond 180 days was rejected holding that Article
14 creates an obligation to grant equal treatment but the same does not amount to a
mandate to indulge in transgression of policies.
8.

In these circumstances, I do not think I can grant any relief to the petitioner

except directing the DDA to refund the amount payable as per the contract with
interest @ 12% per annum. I may note here that even in the case of Harcharan
Singh (supra), DDA was directed to refund the amount with interest @ 10% per
annum. I have granted interest @12% in the present case as the amount has
remained with DDA since 2004 and DDA should not have retained the said
amount and should have refund of the same immediately in view of their policy.
DDA itself charges 15% compound interest. The refund will be issued to the
petitioner within four weeks from today. In case the payment is not made within
four weeks, DDA will be liable to pay interest @15% p.a. with effect from 1st
May, 2008 till payment.
With the above directions, the writ petition is disposed of.
