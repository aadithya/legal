SANJIV KHANNA, J.

1. Order dated 30th May, 2005 passed by the Company Law Board is
subject matter of the present Appeal under Section 10F of the
Companies Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, for short)
filed by Padmini Technologies Ltd and others (hereinafter referred to
as the appellant, for short). Company Law Board by the impugned

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

2

Order has directed the Central Government to appoint two additional
Directors on the Board of the company for a period of two years. The
said direction was given in a petition filed by the Union of India,
Ministry of Company Affairs under Sections 397, 398, 401 and 408 of
the Act.
2. In the Appeal as originally filed, no questions of law had been framed.
Later on an application-CA No.1202/2006 was filed setting out
questions of law. The said application was allowed vide Order dated
6th October, 2006 and the questions of law mentioned in the said
application

were directed to be treated as part of the grounds of

Appeal.
3. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the directions given
in the impugned Order are contrary to Section 408 of the Act

as

conditions precedent are not satisfied. It was submitted that the
reasoning given by the Company Law Board is untenable and the said
order cannot also be upheld on the basis of reasons not set out in the
order itself. Reliance was placed upon the judgment of the Supreme
Court in the case of Mohinder Singh Gill versus CES reported in AIR
1978 SC 851. Some other submissions were also made and these
have been noticed in the later part of the judgment.
4. Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, referred to
various acts and omissions on the part of the management of the

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

3

appellant company and submitted that an appeal under Section 10F
arises only on questions of law. It was submitted that no questions of
law arise in the present Appeal and therefore the appeal is liable to be
dismissed.
5.

The respondent herein, namely, Union of India, Ministry of Company
Affairs had filed a petition before the Company Law Board under the
aforesaid provisions seeking as many as 5 different reliefs including a
prayer to issue directions to prevent conduct of affairs in a manner
prejudicial to public interest and issue of appropriate directions.
Number of allegations were made in this application. An order under
Sections 397, 398 or 408 of the Act is a quasi judicial order passed by
the Board after hearing the parties. The parties themselves are not
authors of the order. In these circumstances, the appellate Court while
deciding an appeal is not strictly governed by the ratio in the case of
Mohinder Singh Gill versus CES reported in AIR 1978 SC 851.

The

said decision is applicable when an authority supports an order on
grounds and reasons other than those mentioned in the order itself.
The respondent herein is not author of the impugned order. It was a
party before the Board, just as the appellant. In the present case by
virtue of Rule 6 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 provisions of
Order XLI and XLII of the Code of Civil procedure 1908 (hereinafter
referred to as Code, for short) are applicable. Under Order XLI Rule

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

4

22 of the Code, a respondent is entitled to support the decree or
decision under appeal by laying challenge to a finding recorded or
issue

decided

against

him

though

the

order,

judgment

or

decree was in the end in his favour. Even otherwise the said principles
are applicable to courts of superior jurisdiction. It was held by the
Supreme Court in case of Jamshed Hormusji Wadia v. Board of
Trustees, Port of Mumbai,(2004) 3 SCC 214 as under:
“A person who has entirely succeeded
before a court or tribunal below cannot file
an appeal solely for the sake of clearing
himself from the effect of an adverse
finding or an adverse decision on one of
the issues as he would not be a person
falling within the meaning of the words
person aggrieved. In an appeal or revision,
as a matter of general principle, the party
who has an order in his favour, is entitled
to show that even if the order was liable to
be set aside on the grounds decided in his
favour, yet the order could be sustained by
reversing the finding on some other
ground which was decided against him in
the court below. This position of law is
supportable on general principles without
having recourse to Order 41 Rule 22 of
the Code of Civil Procedure.”
6. However, while holding that Mohinder Singh Gill (supra) is not
applicable, I have to be conscious of the fact that the present
Appeal under Section 10F is maintainable only on questions of
law.
7.

On the basis of submissions and arguments made by

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

5

learned counsel for the parties, the following questions of law arise
for consideration:
(1)

Whether the findings of Company Law Board in para 10 of

the Order dated 30th May, 2005 are perverse and based on no
material evidence?
(2) Whether the Company Law Board is right in issuing direction to
the Central Government to appoint two Directors on the Board of
Directors of the appellant for a period of two years?
8. Answer to the second question depends on the answer to the
first question.
9. Learned Company law Board in the concluding portion of its
order, namely, para 10 has given the following reasons for
directing the Central Government to appoint two Directors in
the appellant company for a period of two years : firstly, there
have been repeated violations of the Act; secondly, serious
allegations have been made by SEBI in its report, and thirdly
the appellant company has suffered huge losses. The appellant
has denied these allegations but has not been able to explain
and give reasons for the losses. Fourthly, the appellant
company had entered into transaction with a vanishing
company, namely, Kalyani Finance Ltd. and no action was
taken to protect its interest. Fifthly, general public holds nearly

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

6

70% shares in the appellant company. Interest of general
shareholders is required to be protected.
10.In the reply to the petition filed by the appellant before the
Company Law Board, the appellant had stated as under:-

11.

“That when the respondent company
made capital advances to M/s. Kalyani Finance
Ltd in the year 1996-97, the same company
was in existence and functioning. It is denied
that the capital advance given to the said
company is a loss to the respondent company.
It is further denied that there was any diversion
of funds as alleged or at all.”
In the second reply/affidavit filed by the appellant before the

Company Law Board, it was stated as under:“As regards the allegations pertaining to
M/s. Kalyani Finance Ltd here again the
allegations are based on presumption and
conjectures and wholly misconceived. During
the financial year 1995-96 and 1996-97 we
have sold software to M/s. Kalyani Finance
Ltd. There was an outstanding balance of
Rs.10,45,47,190 to be recovered from
M/s.Kalyani Finance Ltd as on 30.06.1997
shown as debtors in the balance sheet. The
above said balance was later on transferred
from debtors to advance for capital goods
while preparing the balance sheet for
December, 1998.”
12.

There is inherent contradiction in the two replies. In the first

reply it has been stated that the appellant had made capital
advance to Kalyani Finance Ltd. in the year 1996-97 and there
was no loss caused. Probably realising that the appellant will not
be able to justify giving of huge capital advance and as no

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

7

supporting documents were filed, the stand was changed in the
reply affidavit and the plea taken was that during the financial year
1995-97 software worth crores of rupees was sold to a finance
company, namely, M/s. Kalyani Finance Ltd. and thereafter
balance of Rs.10,45,47,190/- was transferred from sundry debtors
to advance for capital goods. No details of the software have been
furnished. Infact no reason and details have been given as to why
advance for capital goods was given. Nature and type of capital
goods, contract and agreement were not placed on record. In the
reply filed before the Company Law Board, in order to get over the
two contradictory statements it was stated that the outstanding
balance of Rs.10,45,47,190/- as on 30th June, 1996 was payable
for supply of goods and shown under the heading “sundry
creditors” was transferred to “advance for capital goods” as on 31st
March, 1998.
13.

The stand that no loss was caused in the reply filed on 15th

January,2004, was changed to admission that loss of more than
Rs.10,45,47,190/-

was

suffered

by

the

appellant

in

the

reply/affidavit of 26th April,2004.
14.

The appellant company had admitted that advance of

Rs.10,45,47,190/- was given to Kalyani Finance Ltd in the year
1996 in the reply filed by Mr. V.S. Gupta, Director of the appellant

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

8

company dated 15th January, 2004. It was also admitted by
Mr.V.S. Gupta that the said amount was given as a capital
advance in the year 1996-97. However, he has denied that there
was any loss or diversion. Mr. Vivek Nagpal, another Director of
the appellant company in his affidavit dated 26th April, 2004 has
taken the stand that the appellant had sold software to Kalyani
Finance Ltd in the financial years 1995-96 and 1996-97. Reliance
in this regard was placed on the ledger entries which have been
placed on record in the present Appeal at pages 224-260. The
ledger entries show alleged sale of goods worth crores of rupees
between the period January, 1996 to November, 1996 and
thereafter, reverse entries from April, 1997 to June, 1997 when
goods worth crores of rupees were allegedly bought by the
appellant from Kalyani Finance Ltd.
15.

Learned counsel for the respondent had also drawn my

attention to the balance sheets of Kalyani Finance Ltd for the year
ending 1996. In the financial year ending 31st March, 1996, Kalyani
Finance Ltd. had incurred expenditure of Rs.1,11,356/- but had
allegedly purchased softwares worth Rs.8.50 crores. Admittedly,
Kalyani Finance Ltd. was a finance company and not a company
dealing with buying, selling or developing of softwares. The total
profit made by Kalyani Finance Ltd. for the year ending 31st March,

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

9

1995 was Rs.59,295/- and profit for the year ending 31st March,
1996 was Rs.24,141/-. The total paid up share capital of Kalyani
Finance Ltd as on 31st March, 1995 was Rs.4,00,200/-, which was
increased to Rs.85,00,000/- for the period ending 31st March,
1996. The amount payable to the sundry creditors increased from
Rs.1,42,000/- as on 31st March, 1995 to Rs.8.50 crores on 31st
March, 1996. The above figures are admitted and have not been
disputed.
16.In the Appeal, the appellant has stated that the alleged
transaction with Kalyani Finance Ltd were to the tune of Rs.29.04
crores. It is further stated that there was slump in the information
technology market in 1998 and therefore value of the software
declined drastically, which resulted in heavy losses to Kalyani
Finance Ltd. However, this does not explain the delay in getting
the payment and huge advances in crores of rupees given
between the period 1995-98 to Kalyani Finance Ltd., which initially
had no capital or turnover, capability and capacity to pay.
Admittedly, Kalyani Finance ltd has vanished. Allegations have
also been made that the so called transaction/sale of goods are
bogus and not genuine.
17.

The contention of the appellant that it did not file recovery

proceedings to save court fees as per advice given by advocates

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

10

and other experts and that it was a prudent commercial decision is
nothing but shedding crocodile tears. To any reasonable
businessman it was apparent that when alleged supplies/advances
worth crores were given, chances of recovery were negligible.
Figures relating to financial position of Kalyani Finance Ltd. speak
for themselves. Circulation of money is obvious. The SEBI report
has also castigated the appellant and pointed out various
illegalities. It was, prima facie, found that Ketan Parekh group had
indulged in price manipulation of the shares of the appellant
company and there were other illegalities and irregularities.
18.

The appellant company had purchased shares of an unlisted

company, namely, Shonkh Technologies Ltd. of face value of
Rs.10/- each at premium for Rs.130/- and Rs.160/- per share. The
total purchase value of these shares were Rs.38,17,80,000/-.
These shares were later on transferred to another group company,
belonging to Mr.Vivek Nagpal, Managing Director of the appellant,
for Re.1/-. Mr. Vivek Nagpal was also a Director in Shonkh
Technologies Ltd. The appellant company claims that in lieu of
shares of Shonkh Technologies Ltd. it had received bonus shares
in Shonkh Technologies International Ltd. and these shares were
sold in the open market and a net profit of Rs. 25,88,728/- was
made. However, in the chart furnished by the appellant company, it

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

11

is not stated whether sale consideration has been actually
received. Interestingly, Mr. Vivek Nagpal in his affidavit has not
stated that the sale consideration has been received but it is
stated that the appellant company had acquired rights to the extent
of Rs.38,43,68,727/-.
19.

Regarding the sale of shares of Shonkh Technologies Ltd

and Shonkh Technologies International Ltd, questions were put to
Mr.V.S. Gupta, whole-time Director of the appellant in his
statement recorded under Section 209A (5) of the Act. Some of
the relevant questions and answers given by him are as under:Q.No.46 As per balance sheet as at
30/06/2001, the company has sold its entire
investment except 6000 shares of Shonkh
Technologies Limited at cost price of Rs.130
amounting to Rs.7,80,000/- Please give the

Ans:51.

some error in sending the final balance sheet

Shonkh Technologies International Limited also.
Ans:

Q.N:55.

contains of sale of these investments.

Q.58 – As per Schedule 'J' to the P/L A/c
30-6-2001 there is a profit on sale of current
investment amounting to Rs.2,12,50,000/- as per
Schedule 'K' of the aforesaid P/L Account there is
a loss in sale of investment of Rs.1,83,96,895=00
please give the statement.
Ans-58- As stated earlier there appears to
be some mix up in the balance sheet sent to you
vis a vis adopted by the shareholders. The
adopted copies of balance sheet alongwith
replies to the above queries would be submitted
on 8.3.2002.
(There is a difference in the handwriting in answer to
question no.56 and onwards. However, I am not going into this
aspect).
20. It is admitted case of the appellant that UTI was allotted
Rs.8.50 lacs non-convertible secured debentures of Rs.100/each. However, the procedure prescribed

for creation

of

security/charge on the movable and immovable assets of the
appellant company was not followed. No charge was created and
no interest was paid on these debentures to UTI. Filing of
proceedings by UTI before the Debt Recovery Tribunal does not
bar and prohibit the Company Law Board from adjudicating and
deciding the petition under section 397 and 398 etc. of the Act.
Debt Recovery Tribunal cannot pass an order under the said
provisions. Company Law Board has exclusive jurisdiction to
decide cases of mismanagement, whether affairs of the company
are being conducted in a manner which is prejudicial to the interest

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

14

of the company, public and shareholders. To wait adjudication by
Debt Recovery Tribunal would require adjournment for an
indefinite period. In a case like the present that requires
expeditious decision on merits, delay may be fatal and cause
irreparable harm.
21.

There are allegations about violation of various provisions of

the Act, namely, (i) failure to file annual returns with the Registrar
of Companies, (ii) failure to make provision for gratuity, leave
encashment, etc. under section 211 of the Act, (iii) failure to
maintain register of contracts, (iv) failure to properly maintain
register of members and (v) non compliance of Section 418 of the
Act. Compounding of the violations, protects the company and its
officers from prosecutions. But this one of the facets which the
Company Law Board should keep in mind when a petition like the
present one is filed by the Central Government. Compounding
gives limited protection. It does not obliterate the violation itself.
Company Law Board can take into consideration conduct of a
party and violations of the provisions of the Act.
22.

Confronted with the allegations and evidence mentioned

above, the appellant herein sought shelter under Section 10F of
the Act and submitted that this Court has limited jurisdiction to
consider and decide questions of law. It was submitted that the

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

15

Company Law Board in paragraph 10 of its order has without
giving any reasoning given its findings and final opinion.
23.

Company Law Board in paragraph 1 and 9 has discussed

various aspects and contentions raised by the parties. The
contentions raised have not been discussed for giving its final
decision. In fact number of allegations were made in the petition
under Section 397, 398 r/w. 401 and 408 of the Act. Report given
by SEBI was also filed. Statement of Mr. V.K. Gupta, Director of
the appellant company was also filed. Accounts were also filed.
These aspects have not been considered in proper depth and
detail. In these circumstances, I set aside the Order passed by the
Company Law Board dated 30th May, 2005 with a direction to
decide the said petition de novo on merits after considering all
allegations, evidence and reply given thereto. Thereafter, the
Company Law Board will pass an Order giving suitable directions
in accordance with law. Object and purpose of Sections 397, 398,
402 and 408 of the Act is two-fold. Firstly, to set right the wrongs
and secondly, take remedial action to prevent occurrence of
wrongs in future. Thus both preventive and curative action can be
taken by the Company Law Board. For taking action under Section
408 of the Act, Company Law Board is required to take into
consideration interest of the company, shareholders and public

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

16

interest. Past actions and conduct of the Board of Directors forms
a foundation and the basis for the preventive action. Unless there
is material to establish and show that the affairs of the company
have been conducted in a manner which were prejudicial to the
interest of the company, its members or to public interest, no
directions to prevent repetition of such acts in future can be
issued. In this way, past and future acts are interconnected. It may
be pointed out here that jurisdiction and power under Section 402
of the Act is extremely wide. Petition in the present case was filed
under Section 397 and 398 of the Act. Even while dismissing a
petition under the aforesaid Sections, Court and the Company Law
Board has power under Section 402 of the Act to pass orders
which are just and equitable. Directions/relief can be given in the
larger interest of the company even if no specific prayer is made.
(See Syed Mahomed Ali versus R. Sundaramurthy reported in
(1958) 28 Com. Cases 554 and Shoe Specialities Ltd. Versus
Standard Distilleries and Breweries P. Ltd. reported in (1997) 90
Com. Cases 1). In Needle Industries (India) Ltd. versus Needle
Industries Newey (India) Holding Ltd. reported in (1981) 51 com.
Cases 743 it has been held that power to exercise jurisdiction
under sections 397 and 398 of the Act cannot be defeated by mere
technicalities. Jurisdiction of the Board/court under the said

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

17

provisions is of widest amplitude and orders can be passed with a
view to bring to an end to the matters complained of or preventing
the matters complained of or apprehended. Reference can also be
made to Sangramsinh P. Gaekwad Versus Shantadevi P. Gaekwad
reported in (2005) 11 SCC 314 and Manish Mohan Sharma Versus Ram
Bahadur Thakur reported in (2006) 4 SCC 416. These aspect shall be
kept in mind by the Company Law Board.

24.

However, in the meanwhile, interim order is required to be

passed. The allegations made, as discussed above, against the
appellant are very serious. Prima facie merit in the allegations has
been examined and discussed. 70% shares in the appellant
company are held by the general public and the management only
holds 15% shares. Interest of general public is required to be
protected. Balance of convenience requires some restraint and
embargo on the powers of the management. The appellant
company and its officers are restrained from encumbering, selling,
transferring, alienating, creating any third party rights, inducting
any person, parting with possession in any of their properties or
assets including immovable properties and fixed assets till the
matter is disposed of by the Company Law Board.

However, the

appellant company will be entitled to deal with, sell and dispose of
the stock in trade, raw material and finished products in usual
course of business. This interim order will be subject to the rights

CO.A(SB) No.31-2005

18

of the secured creditors and also subject to order(s) passed by
Debt Recovery Tribunal.
25.

Accordingly, the question of law No.1 mentioned above is

answered in favour of the appellant and with the observations
made above, the matter is remanded back to the Company Law
Board. Question No. 2 therefore need not be decided. Company
Law Board will endeavor to decide the Petition expeditiously
preferably within four months from today.
Appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.
