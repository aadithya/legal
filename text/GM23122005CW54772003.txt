1.

These writ petitions involve similar questions of law

and are based on the same facts. As such they are being taken
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 1 of 16

up together for consideration and decision.
2.

The respondent Shri Jagdev Singh in both the writ

petitions was appointed as a retired crew conductor with the
Delhi Transport Corporation ('DTC' hereafter) with effect from
1st November, 1983 and was working as a conductor with the
Corporation. A chargesheet dated 5th August, 1991 was issued
to him by his employer alleging that he was absent from duty
on 9, 10 and 28 to 31st July, 1991 without sending any
application/or without sanction/approval from appropriate
authority and was again absent from duty on 27, 28th June,
1991 and 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 22nd July, 1991 for which applications
were submitted very late.
3.

It was alleged that these acts constituted misconduct

under para 19(f)(h) of the DRTA(Conditions of Appointment &
Service) Regulations, 1952 and the respondent was required to
submit an explanation. The respondent submitted his reply
which was found by the DTC to be without any basis. Based
thereon a second show cause notice was issued to the
respondent workman requiring him to show cause against a
proposed penalty. On 4th March, 1992, the depot manager had
tentatively formed an opinion and sent notice to the workman
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 2 of 16

requiring him to show cause why he should not be removed
from service. It is stated that no reply was filed thereto by the
respondent and ultimately on 20th April, 1992, an order of
removal of the respondent/workman from service under para
15(2) (vi) of the DRTA(Conditions of Appointment & Service)
Regulations, 1952 was passed.
3.

An

inquiry

was

conducted

against

the

respondent/workman from 23rd November, 1991 and 5th
February, 1991. The respondent chose not to appear before
the inquiry officer despite notices. In these circumstances,
evidence on behalf of the DTC was recorded. The inquiry was
concluded on 5th February, 1991. The witness further also
stated inquiry officer had taken a view that the alleged
misconduct stood proved against the respondent and was
accepted by him.
4.

The petitioner had moved the Industrial Tribunal

under Section 33 (2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
for approval of its aforestated action which was registered as
OP No. 160/1992. The case of the DTC was controverted by
the respondent interalia for the reason that his unauthorised
absence had been regularised by the DTC as it was treated as
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 3 of 16

leave without pay and also for the reason that he was
compelled to seek leave for bonafide and genuine reason of his
sickness and ailment of other family members. According to
the respondent he was never informed about the rejection of
his leave applications or that he has committed misconduct.
The inquiry was challenged on the ground that it was not
conducted as per the rule and regulations and there was
violation of principles of natural justice.
5.

A preliminary issue was framed on 22nd March, 1995

as to whether the DTC had held a legal and valid inquiry
against the respondent/workman according to principles of
natural justice. The DTC failed to produce evidence in support
of its case and consequently the issue of validity of inquiry was
decided against the petitioner.
6.

On the request of the DTC, additional issues were

framed to enable the petitioner to establish the misconduct on
the part of the workman before the Industrial Tribunal. Even
though the chargesheet was specific in terms of the days on
which the respondent/workman had been absent which were
mentioned as 27th and 28th August, 1991 and 2nd, 3rd, 4th and
22nd July, 1991, the witness on behalf of the DTC had deposed
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 4 of 16

that the respondent was irregular in attending his duties
during the period January, 1991 to December, 1991.

The

witness further also stated that the unauthorised absence was
treated as without pay.
7.

The Industrial Tribunal, vide its order dated 4th

September, 2000, came to the conclusion that the petitioner
having treated the unauthorised absence of the workman as
leave without pay, his conduct lost the colour of misconduct
and could not have been so treated in order to terminate the
services of the respondent/workman. It was further held that
such period should not be treated as negligence on the part of
a workman and accordingly the application of the DTC under
Section 33 (2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 was
dismissed by the Tribunal vide its order dated 4th September,
2000. The DTC has impugned this order dated 4th September,
2000 by way of writ petition(civil) no. 3036/2001.
8.

It appears that the workman had also raised an

industrial dispute challenging the punishment imposed upon
him vide the order dated 20th April, 1992 which was referred
for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal vide a notification
dated 16th October, 2001. This reference was registered as ID
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 5 of 16

No. 119/2001. The respondent/workman had placed reliance
on the order dated 4th September, 2000 passed by the Labour
Court dismissing the application of the DTC under Section 33
(2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act seeking approval of the
disciplinary proceedings and action taken against the
workman. Based on the principles of law laid down by the
Apex Court in Jaipur Zila Sehkari Bhoomi Bank
Limited Vikas and Shri Ram Gopal Sharma & Ors.
reported at JT 2002 (1) SC 182, it was contended by the
workman that upon dismissal of the approval application, the
order of termination itself was rendered non-est and a nullity.
According to the workman he was consequently entitled to
reinstatement.
9.

The DTC failed to contest these proceedings. No

written statement was filed. Its defence was struck off and
finally it was also proceeded ex-parte. However though the
DTC appeared in the proceedings subsequently, no application
was filed seeking setting aside of the ex-parte proceedings nor
any permission was sought to file the written statement.
10.

In these circumstances, the learned Industrial

Tribunal, placing reliance on the uncontroverted evidence of
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 6 of 16

the workman and the law laid down in the Jaipur Zila Sehkari
Bhoomi Vikas Bank's case(supra) held that the order of
removal from service was not operative and that the DTC was
bound to reinstate the workman into service. Accordingly the
reference was answered in the affirmative in favour of the
workman. Vide its award dated 5th September, 2002, the DTC
was directed to reinstate the respondent/workman and pay
full back wages to him with continuity of service from 20th
April, 1992.

In case of non-payment within a month of

publication of the award, the DTC was held to be liable to pay
interest at the rate of 9% per annum.
11.

Writ petition(civil) 5477/2003 has been filed by the

DTC impugning this award dated 5th September, 2002 passed
in favour of the workman.
12.

According to the petitioner, the Industrial Tribunal

has erred in dismissing the application of the DTC seeking
approval of the disciplinary action taken against the petitioner
and also in passing the impugned award dated 5th September,
2002 in favour of the workman. It has been urged that the
workman was unauthorisedly absent from work and that this
conduct amounted to negligence and lack of interest in
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 7 of 16

performing his duties by the workman and consequently the
disciplinary action taken by the corporation deserves to be
upheld.
13.

On the other hand, Mr. Chaturvedi, learned counsel

for the workman, placing reliance on the pronouncement of
this court dated 21st December, 2001 in writ petition(civil)
160/2001 DTC vs Rajender Singh, Ex-driver, has contended
that the period of unauthorised absence alleged against the
workman was of barely six days which was also intermittent
and on account of the reasons explained and noticed
hereinabove. It has been contended that the workman was
prevented by causes beyond his control and therefore such
absence could not be treated as evidence of negligence or lack
of interest in performing his duties.

It has further been

contended that the petitioner-DTC itself had admitted receipt
of the applications for the three days absence in July, 2001
and as such the disciplinary action or removal from service
was contrary to law and unsustainable.
14.

The issue relating to the effect of the DTC treating

unauthorised absence of its workman as leave without pay has
fallen for consideration before the Apex Court in AIR 2004 SC
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 8 of 16

4161 entitled Delhi Transport Corporation of Delhi vs Sardar
Singh wherein after consideration of the applicable rules and
regulations and the law on the subject, the principles of law
have been set out thus :“8.
In all theses cases almost the whole
period of absence was without sanctioned lave.
Mere making of an application after or even
before absence from work does not in any way
assist the concerned employee.
The
requirement is obtaining leave in advance. In
all these cases the absence was without
obtaining leave in advance. The relevant paras
of the Standing Order read as follows :
“4. Absence without permission:(i)
An employee shall not
absent himself from his duties
without having first obtained the
permission from the
Authority or the competent officer
except in the case of sudden illness.
In the cases of sudden illness he
shall send intimation to the office
immediately. If the illness lasts or is
expected to last for more than 3
days at a time, applications for leave
should be duly accompanied by a
medical certificate, from a registered
medical practitioner or the Medical
Officer of the D.T.S. In no case shall
an employee leave station without
prior permission.
(ii)
Habitual absence without
permission or sanction of leave and
any continuous absence without
such leave for more than 10 days
shall render the employee liable to
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 9 of 16

be treated as an absconder resulting
in the termination of his service with
the Organisation.
19. General Provisions :Without prejudice to the provisions
of the foregoing Standing Orders,
the following acts of commission
and omission shall be treated as
mis-conduct :
(a)
...............
(h)
Habitual negligence of duties and lack of
interest in the Authority's work.
11.
Conclusions regarding negligence and lack
of interest can be arrived at by looking into the period
of absence, more particularly, when same is
unauthorised. Burden is on the employee who
;claims that there was no negligence and/or lack of
interest to establish it by placing relevant materials.
Clause (ii) of Para 4 of the Standing Order shows the
seriousness attached to habitual absence. In clause
(i) thereof, there is requirement of prior permission.
Only exception made is in case of sudden illness.
There also conditions are stipulated, non-observance
of which renders the absence unauthorised.”
12.

15.

A close reading of the pronouncement of the Apex

Court shows that it has been held that when an employee

W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 10 of 16

absents himself from duty, without sanctioned leave for a very
long period, such conduct primafacie shows lack of interest in
work. The Apex Court has noticed that para 19 (h) of the
standing order relates to habitual negligence of duty and lack
of interest in the authority's work. If the workman has a long
record of absence without sanctioned leave, the DTC may be
justified to come to a conclusion about an employee being
habitually negligent in duty and displaying a lack of interest in
the employee's work.

The Apex Court held that the such

conclusions regarding negligence and lack of interest can be
arrived at by looking into the period of absence, more
particularly, when the same is unauthorised. The burden of
proof was squarely on the employee who was submitting that
there was no negligence or lack of interest in the work to
establish so by placing relevant material evidence. Clause (ii)
of para 4 of the standing order sets down to habitual absence.
Without sanction or continuous absence of ten days would
render the employee liable for being treated as an absconder
and termination of his services.
The Apex Court also observed that in the cases
before it, ample material was produced before the Tribunal to
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 11 of 16

show as to how the concerned employees were remaining
absent for long periods which affected the work of employer
and the concerned employee was required to place some
material on record to establish that his absence was on the
basis of sanctioned leave and as to how there was no
negligence in discharge of his duties.
16.

The guiding principle however is habitual absence

which is the factor which establishes lack of interest in work
and duty.
17.

So far as the judgment of this court in DTC vs

Rajender Singh is concerned, the decision was rendered
before the pronouncement of the Apex Court in DTC vs Sardar
Singh AIR 2004 SC 4161. It is the principles laid down by the
Apex Court which would bind this court.
18.

I find that the judgment of the Apex Court in Sardar

Singh's case(supra) itself carves out certain exceptions which
negate conclusions of negligence even though the absence may
not have been strictly with permission of the DTC.
Furthermore para 4 (ii) of the applicable Standing
Order itself notices that it is habitual absence without
permission or sanction of leave and continuous absence
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 12 of 16

without such leave for more than ten days which renders the
employee liable to be treated as an absconder resulting in
termination of his service with the organisation.
19.

Clause 4 (i) of the standing order mandates that in

the case of certain sudden illness as an employee shall send an
intimation to the office immediately. In case the sickness is
expected to last beyond three days, the application shall be
accompanied by a medical certificate.
20.

In the instant case, from a perusal of the

chargesheet, it has been alleged that the respondent/workman
was absent for only two days on the 27th and 28th August, 1991
and for four days on 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 22nd July, 1991. This came
to a total of six days absence which was spread over two
months. The respondent has sent leave applications which
have been received by the petitioner though, it has been
alleged, that the same was sent late. However there is nothing
on record to show as to what was the delay in making the
application.
21.

So far as the proceedings under Section 33 (2) (b) of

the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are concerned, no challenge
has been made to this order against the DTC, the inquiry
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 13 of 16

proceedings were vitiated. When given an opportunity to
prove the misconduct, the DTC only examined the inquiry
officer and did not opt to even prove the past record of the
workman to make out a case of the workman's being a
habitual absentee before the Industrial Tribunal. Reliance was
sought to be placed on the same before this court for the first
time which is clearly impermissible.
22.

Before the Industrial Tribunal concerned with the

reference

in

respect

of

the

dispute

raised

by

the

respondent/workman challenging his termination, the DTC
did not even file a written statement to the claim made by the
workman. There was no material placed before the court to
displace the case established by the workman before the
tribunal.
23.

In these circumstances, the submission of the DTC

that the present case is covered under the principles laid down
by the DTC vs Sardar Singh and that the absence of the
workman has to be treated as habitual absence establishing
lack of interest in his work is completely misconceived and
unfounded.
24.

So far as the findings of the Industrial Tribunal in

W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 14 of 16

the order dated 4th September, 2000 and the Award dated 5th
September, 2002 to the effect that the action of the DTC in
treating the period of unauthorised absence as leave without
pay amounts to regularisation of the same, is erroneous in law
and is hereby set aside.
25.

However in view of the principles laid down by the

Apex Court and the stipulations contained in clause 4 of the
Standing Order noticed above, in the instant case the
workman was absent for a period of six days which are not
continuous. The DTC miserably failed in its primary burden
to establish that this absence was unauthorised or that the
workman was a habitual defaulter or negligent that his alleged
unauthorised absence fell within the mischief or amounted to
'misconduct' to invite disciplinary action as in the instant case.
In these circumstances, even though the findings of the
Industrial Tribunal on the effect of the DTC's action in treating
the absence as leave without pay, have been set aside, the
ultimate result cannot be indifferent and the writ petitions
have to be dismissed.
For the foregoing reasons, the present writ petitions
are dismissed.
W.P.(C) 3036/2001 & 5477/2003

page 15 of 16

The petitioner shall pass appropriate orders in
terms of the relief granted by the industrial tribunal in its
award dated 5th September, 2002 within a period of six weeks
from today. The litigation expenses already stand paid to the
respondent/workman and as such no order as to costs is being
made.
