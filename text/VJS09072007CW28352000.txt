VIKRAMAJIT SEN, J.
1.

In these petitions a challenge has been laid to the

acquisition of large tracts of land in Delhi stated to be required
CW 2835/2000

13 of 82

for

Rohini

Residential

Scheme.

The

Principal

Secretary

(PWD/L&B), in her Note dated 15.10.1999 had requested the
Hon. Lt. Governor to approve issuance of a Notification under
Sections 4, 6 and 17 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
(hereinafter referred to as `the Act') . An order, also invoking the
urgency clause was forwarded for the Lt. Governor's signature.
On 27th October, 1999 the Lt. Governor , Delhi passed an order
in these words - “I have gone through the records and
requirements of the Delhi Development Authority and the draft
notification prepared by LAC. I am fully satisfied that the land
measuring 2673-07 Bigha in village Shahbad, Daulatpur, 2975-09
Bigha in village Pehladpur Banger, 1178-11 Bigha in village
Khera Kalan, 345-02 Bigha in village Khera Khurd, 1223-06 Bigha
in village Pansali, is urgently required for a valid purpose,
namely

for

Rohini

Residential

Scheme

under

Planned

Development of Delhi. In view of the urgency of the scheme, I
order that notifications under Sections 4, 6 and 17(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 be issued immediately”. The Notification
in question inter alia states that - “The Lt. Governor, Delhi is
satisfied also that provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 17 of
the said Act are applicable to this land and is further pleased
under sub-section (4) of the said Section to direct that all the
CW 2835/2000

14 of 82

provisions of Section 5(A) shall not apply”.

Accordingly, the

following Notifications/Declarations were also issued from time
to time:
1. Notification

u/s 4 No. F10(29)/96/L&B/LA/11394 dated

27.10.1999.
Declaration u/s 6 No.F10(29)/96/L&B/LA/20 dated 3.4.2000.
2. Notification u/s 4 & 17 No. F(II)(17)/91-L&B/LA/6518 dated
28.4.1995.
Declaration u/s 6 No.F(II)(17)/91-L&B/LA/7085 dated 26.4.1996
3.Notification u/s 4 & 17 No.F19(29)/96-L&B/LA/UOI/III/14-72000.
4.Notification u/s 4 & 17No.F11(76)/2000/L&B/LA/dated 25-12002.
Declaration u/s 6 dated 3-12-2002.
All these Notifications/Declarations are sought to be quashed in
these writ petitions.

2.

The contention of the Petitioners is that the Lt.

Governor had not specifically authorised invocation of Section 17
(4) of the stridently Land Acquisition Act and that this is all the
more significant since the draft of the Notification placed before
him adverts to Section 17(4). According to the Petitioners, the
CW 2835/2000

15 of 82

only inference that can be drawn is that the Lt. Governor did not
approve of dispensing with the Petitioners valuable rights to
object to the acquisition. The further contention is that since the
Petitioners have not been permitted to avail of their rights to file
objections under Section 5A and have not been given an
opportunity of being heard the entire acquisition should be struck
down. It has also been argued on behalf of the Petitioners that
even assuming that Section 17(4) need not in terms have to be
mentioned by the Lt. Governor while granting his approval to the
Scheme and that reference only to Section 17(1) would suffice,
the Lt. Governor has not properly exercised his mind in approving
the waiver and

withdrawal

of the Petitioners valuable right

under Section 5A of the Act. In other words it is their stance that
resort to the emergency provisions contained in Section 17 of the
Act were unwarranted and unjustified in the facts of the present
case. It will be relevant to record at the threshold that
acquisition proceedings stand completed in respect of an
overwhelming portion (stated by Mr. Poddar to be as much as 80
per cent) of the subject land, i.e. its possession has been taken
over by the Government which has tendered compensation to the
erstwhile owners.

INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 17 OF
THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT, 1894
3.

The interplay between the various provisions of the

Land Acquisition Act with which we are presently concerned
have been dealt with in minute detail in a

plethora of

precedents. The following passage from Nandeshwar Prasad

-vs- The State of U.P., [1964] 3 SCR 425 (followed one year later
in Sarju Prasad Sinha -vs- The State of U.P., AIR 1965 SC 1763)
perspicuously encapsulates the law on the subject, holding that
the State Government ought not to have dispensed with
adherence to Section 5A in the Notification under Section 4 of
the Act:
The proceedings for acquisition start with a
preliminary

notification

under

s.

4.

By

that

notification the Government notifies that land in any
locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any
public

purpose.

On

that

notification

certain

consequences follow and authority is conferred on
an

officer

either

generally

or

specially

by

Government and on his servants and workmen to
enter upon and survey and take levels of any land in
such locality, to dig or bore into the sub-soil, to do all
other acts necessary to ascertain whether the land is
adapted for such purpose, to set out the boundaries
CW 2835/2000

17 of 82

of the land proposed, to be taken, and so on. Then s.
5-A provides that any person interested in any land
which has been notified in s. 4, may within thirty
days of the issue of the notification object to the
acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality
as the case may be. Every such objection shall be
made to the Collector in writing and the Collector
has to give the objector an opportunity of being
heard. After hearing all objections and after making
further inquiry if any, as he thinks fit, the Collector
has to submit the case for the decision of the
Government

together

with

the

record

of

the

proceedings held by him and the report containing
his recommendations on the objections. The decision
of the Government on the objections is final. Then
comes the notification under s. 6, which provides
that when the appropriate government is satisfied
after considering the report, if any, made under s. 5A that any particular land is needed for a public
purpose, a declaration shall be made to that effect
and published in the official gazette. After such a
declaration has been made under s. 6, the Collector
has to take order for acquisition of land. It is marked
out, measured and planned under s. 8 if necessary
and notice is given under s. 9 to persons interested.
The Collector then holds inquiry under s. 11 and
makes an award. After the award is made the
Collector has got the power to take possession of the
land under s. 16 and the land then vests absolutely in

CW 2835/2000

18 of 82

the Government free from all encumbrances.

It

will

be

clear

from

this

scheme

that

compliance with the provisions of s. 5-A is necessary
before a notification can be issued under s. 6. As
soon as the preliminary notification is issued under
s. 4, the officer authorised by Government may enter
upon the land to survey it and to do all other
necessary acts to ascertain whether the land is
adapted for the purpose for which it is to be
acquired, and this action, if taken, will give sufficient
notice to those interested to object. If objections are
made the Collector will consider those objections
and make his recommendation thereon in his report
to Government. If no objections are made the
Collector will report that no objection has been made
and the Government then proceeds to issue a
notification under s. 6. In either case however, the
Collector has got to make a report with his
recommendations on the objections if they are filed
or inform

the

Government that there are

no

objections filed in pursuance of the notification
under s. 4 and it is thereafter that the Government is
empowered under s. 6 to issue a notification. This, as
we have said, is the usual procedure to be followed
before the notification under s. 6 is issued. To this
usual procedure there is however an exception under
s. 17, and that is why in s. 6 we find the words "if
any" in the clause "after considering the report, if
CW 2835/2000

19 of 82

any, made under s. 5A". When action is taken under
s. 17(4), it is not necessary to follow the procedure in
s. 5-A and a notification under s. 6 can be issued
without a report from the Collector under s. 5-A.
......

It will be seen that s. 17(1) gives power to the
Government to direct the Collector, though no award
has been made under s. 11, to take possession of any
waste or arable land needed for public purpose and
such

land

thereupon

vests

absolutely

in

the

Government free from all encumbrances. If action is
taken under s. 17(1), taking possession and vesting
which are provided in s. 16 after the award under s.
11 are accelerated and can take place fifteen days
after the publication of the notice under s. 9. Then
comes s. 17(4) which provides that in case of any
land to which the provisions of sub-s. (1) are
applicable, the Government may direct that the
provisions of s. 5-A shall not apply and if it does so
direct, a declaration may be made under s. 6 in
respect of the land at any time after the publication
of the notification under s. 4(1). It will be seen that it
is not necessary even where the Government makes
a direction under s. 17(1) that it should also make a
direction under s. 17(4). If the Government makes a
direction only under s. 17(1) the procedure under s.
5-A would still have to be followed before a
CW 2835/2000

20 of 82

notification under s. 6 is issued, though after that
procedure has been followed and a notification
under s. 6 is issued the Collector gets the power to
take possession of the land after the notice under s.
9 without waiting for the award and on such taking
possession

the

land

shall

vest

absolutely

in

Government free from all encumbrances. It is only
when the Government also makes a declaration
under s. 17(4) that it becomes unnecessary to take
action under s. 5-A and make a report thereunder. It
may be that generally where an order is made under
s. 17(1), an order under s. 17(4) is also passed; but in
law it is not necessary that this should be so.

Thirty five years later, their Lordships had garnered

support from Nandeshwar Prasad which was applied in Union

of India -vs- Mukesh Hans, (2004) 8 SCC 14, decided on 17-92004 without reference to Krishan Lal Arneja (infra). It was
emphasised that there must be an application of mind by the
appropriate Government to the facts of the case with special
reference to the necessity of dispensing with the invaluable
opportunity of showing cause and being heard against the
acquisition consequent upon a Section 4 Notification. It should
be noted that prior to the amendment of the statute in 1923, since
the right to file Objections to the proposed expropriation of land
was non existent, there was no reason whatsoever to refer to the
CW 2835/2000

21 of 82

dismissal or disposal of Section 5A Objections. It is advisable, if
not essential, to keep the annals of the statute in mind while
interpreting its sundry sections. Their Lordships had upheld the
decision of the Division Bench of this Court and had reiterated
the law in these words:
29. A careful perusal of the above Section
shows that Sub-section (1) of Section 17 contemplates
taking possession of the land in the case of an
urgency without making an award but after the
publication of Section 9(1) notice and after the
expiration of 15 days of publication of Section 9(1)
notice. Therefore, it is seen that if the appropriate
Government decides that there is an urgency to
invoke Section 17(1) in the normal course Section 4
(1) notice will have to be published, Section 6
declaration will have to be made and after completing
the procedure contemplated under Sections 7 and 8,
Section 9(1) notice will have to be given and on
expiration of 15 days from the date of such notice the
authorities can take possession of the land even
before passing of an award.
30. Sub-section (2) of Section 17 contemplates
a different type of urgency inasmuch as it should be
an unforeseen emergency. Under this Section if the
appropriate Government is satisfied that there is such
unforeseen emergency the

authorities can take

possession of the land even without waiting for the
fifteen day period contemplated under Section 9(1).
CW 2835/2000

22 of 82

Therefore,

in

cases,

where

the

Government

is

satisfied that there is an unforeseen emergency, it
will have to in the normal course, issue a Section 4(1)
notification, hold Section 5-A inquiry, make Section 6
declaration, and issue Section 9(1)

notice and

possession can be taken immediately thereafter
without waiting for the period of 15 days prescribed
under Section 9(1) of the Act
31. Section 17 (4) as noticed above, provides
that in cases where the appropriate Government has
come to the conclusion that there exists an urgency
or unforeseen emergency as required under Subsection (1) or (2) of Section 17 it may direct that the
provisions of Section 5-A shall not apply and if such
direction is given then Section 5-A inquiry can be
dispensed with and a declaration may be made under
Section 6 on publication of Section 4(1) notification
and possession can be made.
32. A careful perusal of this provision which is
an exception to the normal mode of acquisition
contemplated

under

existence

urgency

of

the
or

Act

shows

unforeseen

that

mere

emergency

though is a condition precedent for invoking Section
17(4), that by itself is not sufficient to direct the
dispensation of the Section 5-A inquiry. It requires an
opinion to be formed by the government concerned
that along with the existence of such urgency or
unforeseen emergency there is also a need for
dispensing with Section 5A inquiry which indicates
CW 2835/2000

23 of 82

that

the

Legislature

intended

the

appropriate

government to apply its mind before dispensing with
Section 5A inquiry. It also indicates that mere
existence of an urgency under Section 17 (1) or
unforeseen emergency under Section 17 (2) would
not by itself be sufficient for dispensing with Section
5-A inquiry. If that was not the intention of the
Legislature then the latter part of Sub-section (4) of
Section 17 would not have been necessary and the
Legislature in Section 17 (1) and (2) itself could have
incorporated that in such situation of existence of
urgency

or

unforeseen emergency

automatically

Section 5-A inquiry will be dispensed with. But then
that is not the language of the Section which in our
opinion requires the appropriate Government to
further consider the need for dispensing with Section
5-A inquiry in spite of the existence of unforeseen
emergency. This understanding of ours as to the
requirement of an application of mind by the
appropriate

Government

while

dispensing

with

Section 5-A inquiry does not mean that in each and
every case when there is an urgency contemplated
under Section 17 (1) and unforeseen emergency
contemplated under Section 17 (2) exists that by itself
would not contain the need for dispensing with
Section 5-A inquiry. It is possible in a given case the
urgency noticed by the appropriate Government
under Section 17(1) or the unforeseen emergency
under Section 17(2) itself may be of such degree that

CW 2835/2000

24 of 82

it could require the appropriate Government on that
very basis to dispense with the inquiry under Section
5 A but then there is a need for application of mind by
the appropriate Government that such an urgency for
dispensation of the Section 5-A inquiry is inherent in
the two types of urgencies contemplated under
Section 17 (1) and (2) of the Act.
(underlining added)
33. An argument was sought to be advanced on
behalf of the appellants that once the appropriate
Government comes to the conclusion that there is an
urgency or unforeseen emergency under Section 17
(1) and (2) the dispensation of enquiry under Section
5-A becomes automatic and the same can be done by
a composite order meaning thereby that there is no
need for the appropriate Government to separately
apply its mind for any further emergency for
dispensation with an inquiry under Section 5-A. We
are unable to agree with the above argument because
sub-section (4) of Section 17 itself indicates that the
"government may direct that the provisions of Section
5-A shall not apply" (emphasis supplied) which makes
it clear that not in every case where the appropriate
Government has come to the conclusion that there is
urgency and under sub-section (1) or unforeseen
emergency under sub-section (2) of Section 17, the
Government will ipso facto have to direct the
dispensation of the inquiry. For this we do find
support from a judgment of this Court in the case of
CW 2835/2000

25 of 82

Nandeshwar Prasad

v. The State of U.P., (1964) 3

SCR 425:AIR 1964 SC 1217 wherein considering the
language of Section 17 of the Act which was then
referable to waste or arable land and the U.P.
Amendment to the said section, this Court held thus :
"It will be seen that Section 17(1) gives power
to the Government to direct the Collector, though no
award has been made under Section 11, to take
possession of any waste or arable land needed for
public purpose and such land thereupon vests
absolutely

in

the

Government

free

from

all

encumbrances. If action is taken under Section 17
(1),

taking

possession

and

vesting

which

are

provided in Section 16 after the award under
Section 11 are accelerated and can take place
fifteen days after the publication of the notice under
Section 9. Then comes Section 17(4) which provides
that in case of any land to which the provisions of
sub-section (1) are applicable, the Government may
direct that the provisions of Section 5A shall not
apply and if it does so direct, a declaration may be
made under Section 6 in respect of the land at any
time after the publication of the notification under
Section 4(1). It will be seen that it is not necessary
even where the Government makes a direction
under Section 17(1) that it should also make a
direction under Section 17(4). If the Government
makes a direction only under Section 17(1) the
procedure under Section 5-A would still have to be
CW 2835/2000

26 of 82

followed before a notification under Section 6 is
issued, though after that procedure has been
followed and a notification under Section 6 is issued
the Collector gets the power to take possession of
the land after the notice under Section 9 without
waiting for the award and on such taking possession
the land shall vest absolutely in Government free
from

all

encumbrances.

It

is

only

when

the

Government also makes a declaration under Section
17(4) that it becomes unnecessary to take action
under Section 5A and make a report thereunder. It
may be that generally where an order is made under
Section 17(1), an order under Section 17(4) is also
passed; but in law it is not necessary that this should
be so. It will also be seen that under the Land
Acquisition Act an order under Section 17(1) or
Section 17(4) can only be passed with respect to
waste or arable land and it cannot be passed with
respect to land which is not waste or arable and on
which buildings stand." (emphasis supplied)
34. A careful reading of the above judgment
shows that this Court in the said Nandeshwar
Prasad case has also held that there should be an
application of mind to the facts of the case with
special reference to this concession of Section 5-A
inquiry under the Act.
35. At this stage, it is relevant to notice that
the

limited

right

given

to

an

owner/person

interested under Section 5-A of the Act to object to

CW 2835/2000

27 of 82

the

acquisition

proceedings

is

not

an

empty

formality and is a substantive right, which can be
taken away for good and valid reason and within the
limitations prescribed under Section 17(4) of the
Act. The object and importance of 5A inquiry was
noticed by this Court in the case of Munshi Singh
and Ors. v. Union of India, (1973) 2 SCC 337,
wherein this Court held thus:"7. Section 5-A embodies a very just and
wholesome principle that a person whose property is
being or is intended to be acquired should have a
proper and reasonable opportunity of persuading
the authorities concerned that acquisition of the
property belonging to that person should not be
made.

...The

legislature

has,

therefore,

made

complete provisions for the persons interested to file
objections against the proposed acquisition and for
the disposal of their objections . It is only in cases of
urgency that special powers have been conferred on
the appropriate Government to dispense with the
provisions of Section 5-A."
36. It is clear from the above observation of
this Court that right of representation and hearing
contemplated under Section 5-A of the Act is a very
valuable right of a person whose property is sought
to be acquired and he should have appropriate and
reasonable opportunity of persuading the authorities
concerned that the acquisition of the property
belonging to that person should not be made.

CW 2835/2000

28 of 82

Therefore,

in

our

opinion,

if

the

appropriate

Government decides to take away this minimal right
then its decision to do so must be based on materials
on record to support the same and bearing in mind
the object of Section 5 A.
37. We will now refer to the facts of the
present

case.

We

make

it

clear

that

this

consideration of facts by us is not for the purpose of
finding out whether the stated public purpose is in
reality a public purpose or not, nor is it for the
purpose of finding out whether there was an
urgency as contemplated under Section 17(1) of the
Act, but limited to the question of whether there was
any material available before the Lt. Governor
pursuant to whose order Section 4(1) notification
stated that Section 5-A inquiry is dispensed with.
Since formation of an opinion and application of
mind cannot be assessed except by looking into the
proceedings which culminated in the impugned
order, we intend considering only such facts as are
necessary for this limited purpose. The facts of the
present case as found from the records shows that
the Anjuman-Saire-e-Gul-Faroshan the committee
that organises this festival was using some land in
village Mehrauli for conducting its concluding
ceremony. It is for this purpose it sought 4000 sq.
yards of land in Khasra Nos. 1151/3 (new) and 1665
(old) of the said village. It is also found from the
record that ever since the revival of the festival the

CW 2835/2000

29 of 82

concluding programme was being continued in a
piece of land situated in the said Khasra of Mehrauli
village which is now sought to be acquired along
with certain other lands. There is no material on
record to show that either the said festival has been
discontinued for want of land or the owners of the
land where the festival has its concluding ceremony
are preventing the utilisation of that land for the
said purpose. We have also noticed hereinabove that
an earlier attempt to acquire 40 bighas of the land
for the very same purpose was allowed to be lapsed
by the authorities concerned by efflux of time which
was also a relevant factor to be taken note of by the
Lt. Governor when he took the decision to dispense
with the Section 5-A inquiry but the same was not
placed before him. These facts coupled with the
findings of the High Court that in almost all the
notings in the file there is no reference to the need
for invoking Section 17(4), indicates that the Lt.
Governor was not apprised of all the necessary and
relevant facts before he took the decision in
question. Therefore, in our opinion, the findings of
the High Court that the decision of the Lt. Governor
to dispense with the Section 5-A inquiry suffered
from the vice of non-application of mind has to be
upheld. For the reasons stated above, these appeals
fail and are dismissed.

CW 2835/2000

5.

We need to clarify that the present Notification as

well as the Mukesh Hans Notification specifically state that the
Lt. Governor is of the opinion that provisions of sub-section (1) of
Section 17 of the Act are applicable to the acquisition and that
the provisions of Section 5A of the Act would not apply.
Simultaneously, a Declaration under Section 6 of the Act as well
as the Notification under Section 7 of the Act had been
published. Logically, if the Apex Court was of the opinion that
the Lt. Governor had perforce to take a decision under Section
17 (4) of the Act, the Notification could have been struck down
on that short ground alone. Instead, however, their Lordships
perused the file to satisfy themselves with regard to the
appropriateness and legality of the Lt. Governor's decision under
Section 17(1). In other words their Lordships did not consider it
essential and mandatory that the Lt. Governor's opinion should
have been predicated particularly on the provisions of Section 17
(4). In the event, their Lordships struck down the Notification on
the grounds that the rigours of Section 17(1) had not been
respected in the factual matrix of that case.

Their Lordships

finding was to the effect that the Lt. Governor had not properly
exercised his mind on the vexed question of whether the
perceived urgency justified the forfeiture of Section 5A rights.

6.

A study of Union of India -vs- Krishan Lal Arneja,

AIR 2004 SC 3582, decided on 28-4-2004, i.e. prior to Mukesh

Hans will disclose that their Lordships have not always drawn a
distinction between the sundry sub-sections of Section 17 and on
the contrary have treated Section 17 of the Act as a compendium
for regulating the emergency powers of acquisition of land. In

Krishan Lal Arneja also, the challenge was to the existence of
sufficient material justifying the invoking of Sections 17(1) and
(4) in the Notification under Section 4(1) read with Section 17
(1). It will bear repetition that the first sub-section permits
dispossession

after

fifteen

days

where

the

appropriate

Government is subjectively satisfied of the existence of urgency.
The second sub-section spells out, in minute details as it
necessarily should, the circumstances in which the appropriate
Government can take possession of acquired lands merely after
forty eight hours (virtually immediate for all practical purposes).
Neither of these provisions make any mention of Section 5A of
the Act. Their Lordships observed as follows:
“17. Section 17 confers extraordinary powers
on the authorities under which it can dispense with
the normal procedure laid down under Section 5A of
the Act in exceptional case of urgency. Such powers
CW 2835/2000

32 of 82

cannot be lightly resorted to except in case of real
urgency enabling the Government to take immediate
possession of the land proposed to be acquired for
public purpose. A public purpose, however laudable
it may be by itself is not sufficient to take aid of
Section 17 to use this extraordinary power as use of
such power deprives

a land owner of his right in

relation to immovable property to file objections for
the proposed acquisition and it also dispenses with
the inquiry under Section 5A of the Act. The
Authority must have subjective satisfaction of the
need for invoking urgency clause under Section 17
keeping in mind the nature of the public purpose,
real urgency that the situation demands and the time
factor i.e. whether taking possession of the property
can wait for a minimum period within which the
objections could be received from the land owners
and the inquiry under section 5A of the Act could be
completed. In other words, if power under section
17 is not exercised, the very purpose for which the
land is being acquired urgently would be frustrated
or defeated. Normally urgency to acquire a land for
public purpose does not arise suddenly or overnight
but

sometimes

unexpectedly,

such

urgency

exceptionally

or

may

arise

extraordinarily

depending on situations such as due to earthquake,
flood or some specific time bound project where the
delay is likely to render the purpose nugatory or
infructuous. A citizen's property can be acquired in

CW 2835/2000

33 of 82

accordance with law but in the absence of real and
genuine urgency, it may not be appropriate to
deprive an aggrieved party of a fair and just
opportunity of putting forth its objections for due
consideration of the acquiring authority, while
applying the urgency clause, the State should
indeed

act

with

due

care

and

responsibility.

Invoking urgency clause cannot be a substitute or
support for the laxity, lethargy or lack of care on the
part of the State Administration.”

7.

These

decisions

may

be

of

no

avail

to

the

Respondents if the arguments that Orders under Section 17(4)
are essential have not been raised earlier. Therefore, whether
there was, in fact, urgency in the matter has not been assailed by
the present Petitioners.

The frequently quoted opinion of the

House of Lords in Quinn v. Leathem, 1901 AC 495 : (1900-3) All
ER Rep 1 is that of Lord Halsbury, namely, that “every judgment
must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or
assumed to be proved .... The other is that a case is only an
authority for what is actually decides”. These quotations have
been reiterated in Goodyear India Ltd. -vs- State of Haryana,
(1990) 2 SCC 71 and State of Orissa v. Sudhansu Sekhar Misra,
AIR 1968 SC 647. In the latter case, the Court explicitly opined

CW 2835/2000

34 of 82

that “a decision on a question which has not been argued cannot
be treated as a precedent”. Their Lordships, in turn, referred
back to the previous opinion in Rajput Ruda Meha -vs- State of

Gujarat, 1980 SC 1707 in which it had similarly been stated that
where an issue has neither been raised nor argued any decision
by the Court, even after 'pondering over the issue in depth',
would not be a binding precedent.

Similar observations have

been made by the Constitution Bench in Padma Sundara Rao -vs-

State of T.N., 2002(3) SCC 533, as is evident from the following
extract:
9.

Courts should not place reliance on decisions

without discussing as to how the factual situation fits
in with the fact situation of the decision on which
reliance is placed. There is always peril in treating the
words of a speech or judgment as though they are
words in a legislative enactment, and it is to be
remembered that judicial utterances are made in the
setting of the facts of a particular case, said Lord
Morris in Herrington v. British Railways Board, (1972)
2 WLR 537. Circumstantial flexibility, one additional
or different fact may make a world of difference
between conclusions in two cases.
We have carefully perused the judgments in Nandeshwar

Prasad, Krishan Lal Arneja and Mukesh Hans and in order to
ascertain whether it had been argued that a separate decision
CW 2835/2000

35 of 82

must be taken under Sections 17(1) or (2) on the one hand, and
Section 17(4) on the other; or that even if Section 17(1) or 17(2)
are resorted to, Objections

under Section 5A must be invited

and decided before an acquisition can be completed.

Our

research is that these contentions had not been raised.
Therefore, the dictum in Quinn assumes great significance. We
will nonetheless give due deference to all the observations made
by the Apex Court, even though we find from the pleadings
before us, that grounds predicated on the

above

arguments

have not been articulated in the petitions. Indubitably, these are
legal contentions and we would be loathe to ignore them solely
for the reason that they have not been pleaded. But this state of
affairs has obviously been occasioned because of the views
ventilated in Mukesh Hans.

8.

The scheme of the Act has already been reflected

upon by the Apex Court in the precedents dealt with above.
Three recent decisions rendered by Division Benches of this
Court, applying the ratio in Nandeshwar Prasad and Mukesh

Hans have however been appealed against and the Apex Court
has ordered that - “there shall be interim stay of the High Court's
order”.

These are (a) Sri Ballabh Marbles -vs- Union of India,

CW 2835/2000

36 of 82

117 (2005) DLT 387, (b) Chaman Lal Malhotra -vs- Union of

India, W.P. (C) 4002/1997 decided on 8.8.2005 and (c) Vasant
Kunj Enclave Housing Welfare Society -vs- Union of India, 2006
(89) DRJ 406. We find ourselves unable to accept the contention
of Mr. Sethi that we must nevertheless follow the line of
reasoning in these three cases. Had an interim stay of the orders
passed therein not been granted by the Apex Court we could
have either followed these judgments or recommended the
convening of a Full Bench to reconsider the legal nodus. Be that
as it may, it is entirely unarguable that where a Supreme Court
Judgment is available it must be followed in its true tenor
regardless of the pronouncement of Benches of the High Court.

9.

We have had the advantage of listening to the

extremely erudite arguments of several learned Counsel for the
parties. We have endeavoured a meticulous study of the subject
statute which is over a century in vintage, wearing the vestiges
of colonial rule. Broadly stated, the law of land acquisition in
India was predicated on the principle of “eminent domain” or
“condemnation” or “expropriation”, a concept which could
conveniently be employed when land-owners were subjects and
not citizens.
CW 2835/2000

Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition explains
37 of 82

“eminent domain” as “the power to take private property for
public use by the state, municipalities, and private persons or
corporations

authorized

to

exercise

functions

of

public

character. .... eminent domain is the highest and most exact idea
of property remaining in the government, or in the aggregate
body of the people in their sovereign capacity.

It gives a right

to resume the possession of the property in the manner directed
by the constitution and the laws of the state, whenever the public
interest requires it.” Like Article 300A of our Constitution the
American Constitution requires that just compensation must be
given to the

owners of the property which is taken away.

Originally, ownership of property was assumed to be a
fundamental right in our country, but Article 19(1)(f) has been
replaced by Article 300A which proclaims that no person shall be
deprived of his property save by authority of law. Reverting
back, however, to the pre-independence era, in 1894 when the
Land Acquisition Act came into force, the sovereign possessed
untrammelled powers to expropriate the lands of its subjects.
What was required of the Government was merely making public
its intention to acquire land (Section 4) which empowered it to
enter upon the land for its mapping etc., in the course of which,
if damage was caused compensation would have to be calculated
CW 2835/2000

38 of 82

and given (Section 5). Section 5A, which enables the filing of
Objections, was absent. The Government could then, at its own
sweet will and convenience, issue a declaration that it needed
the land for public purposes. The Government would thereupon
direct the Collector to obtain necessary orders for the acquisition
of the land (Section 7) and the Collector would complete the
remaining and requisite measurements (Section 8).
stage

the

individual

owner

did

not

receive

Upto this

personalized

attention, but this would obviously become advisable if not
essential as soon as possession of his land was to be taken over
and compensation for it was to be calculated and tendered. The
original scheme of the Act, however, did not repose any say or
right to remonstrate viz-a-viz acquisition proceedings on the
owner of the land, as would be clear from a perusal of the
Judgment of the Privy Council in Ezra -vs- Secretary of State for

India, (1905) XXXII I.L.R. Calc. 605, in the context of Sections 9
and 40 of the Act:
Now, upon the face of this enactment, there is
no provision requiring or implying the presence or
the knowledge of the owner of the land. The theory
of

the

section

would

seem

to

be

that

the

Government, through its officer, is to direct its
attention to public interests, and it is significant that
neither promoter, on the one hand, nor possible
CW 2835/2000

39 of 82

objector, on the other, is mentioned in the section.
This does not imply that the officer is to disregard
the existence of adverse rights, and the word
“needed” implies this.

But the standpoint is that of

public interest, and the Government is given control
of the enquiry, for this is all that is meant by its
being empowered to appoint time and place; and all
this derives the more significance from the fact that
the Act, both in this stage

and in the subsequent

enquiry into value, takes the initiative out of the
hands of the Company and puts it in the hands of the
Government.
....
That the nature of the first enquiry is in no
sense litigious, and that the owners of the land are
purposely ignored, as parties, is strongly shown by
the anxious provisions made as regards the second
enquiry for which (section 9) “public notice” is to be
given calling for claims for compensation and
requiring all persons interested in the land to appear
at a time and place specified.

10.

Section 9 of the Act has not undergone any significant

change over the last century. It bestows on any person interested
in the land the opportunity of personal appearance, however, but
only with regard to the computation of compensation. The said
sub-section (3) thereof obliges the Collector to serve notice on the
CW 2835/2000

40 of 82

occupier also, since the Government can assume possession of
the

acquired

land.

Section

11

thereafter

postulates

the

publication of an Award, which would become final by virtue of
Section 12, whereupon the Collector became empowered to take
possession of the land with the result that it would vest absolutely
in the Government free from all encumbrances (Section 16).
Obviously this procedure would span a number of years, during
which the owner or the person interested in the land or the
occupier, would not normally be dispossessed.

The painfully

protracted procedure of acquisition has been shortened by
amendments carried out by Act 68 of 1984, enjoining that no
Declaration under Section 6 shall be made after the expiry of one
year from the Notification under Section 4. However, situations
may well arise which would warrant and necessitate the
Government to take possession of land forthwith. This is what
Section 17 of the Act catered for, from the very inception. The
first sub-section enables the Collector, even before an Award has
been made, on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication
of a Section 9 notice, to assume possession of any land. In even
more pressing circumstances, dealt with in detail in the second
sub-section of Section 17, the Collector retains the power to take
possession of the land after the expiry of just two days, without
CW 2835/2000

41 of 82

the owner/occupier of the land having any right to remonstrate
against this extraordinary action. Such a situation would appear
abhorrent to us today, but in a colonial era this would not have
been looked askance at. Ironically, the decision in Ezra acted as
a

catalyst

for

bringing

about

widespread

and

welcome

amendments to the statute in 1923.

11.

We think it advantageous to reproduce Act XXXVIII of

1923 not only for facility of reference but also so that the
sequence and impact of the alterations are comprehensively
appreciated. Its Statement of Objects & Reasons took note of the
fact that the Act “does not provide that persons having an interest
in land which it proposed to acquire shall have the right of
objecting to such acquisition and that the Government is not
bound to enquire into and consider any objections that may reach
them. The object of the Bill is to provide that a Local Government
shall not declare, under s.6 of the Act, that any land is needed for
a public purpose unless time has been allowed after the
notification under s.4 for persons interested in the land to put in
objections and for such objections to be considered by the Local
Government”.

Collector under section 5A, sub-section (2), or on
the report of the officer making an inquiry under
section 40.”

12.

As we have already noted, the draconian nature of

the Act came to the fore in Ezra, resulting

in an infusion of

humaneness into the statute in the form of Act XXXVIII of 1923,
the most far-reaching feature of which is Section 3, which now
constitutes Section 5A of the Act. It enables the filing of
objections

to

the

proposed

acquisition,

requiring

their

consideration of the Collector culminating in his Report/s. The
Report is the precursor of the Declaration under Section 6 of the
Act. The amendment, however, had the effect of making the
procedure considerably more time consuming. Section 17
automatically assumed added significance for the Government
because unless the right to file Objections under Section 5A could
be consumed by the Government, Section 17 would become
illusory and otiose. Hence, dispensation of Section 5A was made
available in terms of Section 17(4) which was simultaneously
introduced by Act XXXVIII of 1923. If the annals of legislation are
ignored, the interpretation of these provisions may become an
anachronism.
CW 2835/2000

46 of 82

13.

In our considered opinion Section 17(4) is not a

fasciculous of the Act, a sub-pandect or a self-contained code
having its own realm of operation. Its sole purpose is to clarify
that Sections 17(1) and (2) continue to operate as they did prior
to 1923. If Section 17(4) is to function in its own field, the factual
matrix attending thereto should be spelt out on the lines
delineated in its preceding sub-sections (1) and (2). On a careful
perusal of the provision of Section 17(4) it will be evident that it
contemplates the formation of an opinion by the Government as
to existence of the fact situation postulated either by Section 17
(1), thereby enabling possession to be taken over after fifteen
days, or under Section 17(2) empowering the taking of similar
action after only two days. Originally, neither of these provisions
had Section 5A within their respective sights. Sections 17(1) and
(2)

predated

the

introduction

of

the

rights

of

landowners/occupiers to object to the acquisition of their lands.
Furthermore, we think it hallucinatory to visualize the taking
over of possession in less than two days. We have not come
across a case where a citizen is dispossessed instantaneously
with the taking of a decision to acquire his land.

If this is the

practical reality, we are unable to conceive of a situation of such
urgency as would justify or necessitate the formation of an
CW 2835/2000

47 of 82

opinion in respect of a decision to be taken other than in the
factual matrix disclosed in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of
Section 17 (i.e. signing and executing virtually instantly)
reference to which would not have been necessary if there were
other and even more extreme situations (in practical terms
unthinkable to us), envisaged by sub-section (4) alone. This is
why we have said that Section 17(4) is not a self-contained subcode; if theoretically there is urgency which does not brook even
a delay of forty-eight hours, it should have been articulated in
painstakingly minute detail, so that its abuse is safeguarded
against. It is equally unrealistic to expect that Objections, which
are normally numerous, can be decided in two days or even in
fifteen days. The original intendment of Section 17 of the Act
was merely clarified in Section 17(4) to continue even after the
introduction of Section 5A, viz that in emergent situations
acquisition proceedings could be concluded virtually instantly.

14.

Furthermore, it would be futile to consider Objections

under Section 5A after possession has been wrested away from
the owner or occupier or person interested in the land, as the
case may be; as inane and inconsequential as shutting the stable
after the horse has bolted out of it. It will be fatal to ignore the
CW 2835/2000

48 of 82

fact that Section 5A permits and enables any person interested
in any land which has been notified under Section 4 to file
objections within thirty days from the date of the publication of
the Notification. If objections must necessarily be called for and
entertained either under Section 17(1) or Section 17(2), the Act
should have clarified that the period of fifteen days and two days
mentioned in sub-Section (1) and (2) of Section 17 would
commence after the period of thirty days prescribed in Section
5A.

We have duly noted the use of “may” in the provision,

denoting the availability of a choice, which militates against our
understanding that as soon as the Government forms an opinion
that conditions covered by Section 17(1) or (2) are current,
dispensation of Section 5A inexorably and automatically follow.
However instances are legion

where “may” has been freely

interchanged or used synonymously with “shall” or even “must”,
especially where the context of the statute so dictates. In our
opinion Section 17(4) is clarificatory in nature, calculated to
caution

interested

persons

that

objections

would

not

be

entertained both to the acquisition of the land and to the
consequent

dispossession of the

owner/occupant.

Otherwise,

Sections 17(1) and (2) would be rendered meaningless, otiose
and ineffectual. In other words, the Government has been
CW 2835/2000

49 of 82

explicitly reminded in Section 17(4) that whenever it resorts
either to Section 17(1) or Section 17(2) the consequence is the
annihilation of the citizens rights enshrined in Section 5A and
that therefore it must take due care and caution in doing so; and
that ordinarily this procedure is to be eschewed.

15.

In Om Prakash -vs- State of U.P., 1998 (6) SCC 1

their Lordships had pithily observed that they “could have
appreciated the stand of the State authorities for invoking the
urgency clause under Section 17(4) of the Act on the ground that
when about 500 acres of land were to be acquired for further
planned development of Sector 43 and other sectors of NOIDA,
as mentioned in the impugned notification, hearing of objectors
who might have filed written objections when there are a large
number of occupants of these lands and who possess about 438
plots of land under acquisition, would have indefinitely delayed
the acquisition proceedings and years would have rolled by
before Section 6 notification could have been issued. Under these
circumstances, the entire further development of the area would
have, on the peculiar facts and circumstances of these cases,
come to a grinding halt. Such a stand would have justified the
subjective satisfaction of the authorities for invoking Section 17
CW 2835/2000

50 of 82

(4) of the Act. Such satisfaction then could not have been gone
behind by a court of law. But unfortunately for the respondents,
such was not their case nor did they even whisper in these
cases that these aspects were kept in view while dispensing with
Section 5A inquiry.”

The Court was concerned only with the

applicability of Section 17(4), and accordingly they had only to
sift through the relevant material available with the appropriate
Government to enable it to arrive at its subjective satisfaction
about dispensing with a Section 5A inquiry.

16.

We have been bludgeoned by Mr. Ravinder Sethi,

learned Senior counsel appearing for the Petitioner, with a
deluge of decisions, some of which are not topical. Shyam

Nandan Prasad -vs- State of Bihar, (1993) 4 SCC 255 and
Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd. -vs- Darius Shapur Chenai,
(2005) 7 SCC 627, are of no advantage since Section17 had not
been invoked. In Munshi Singh -vs- Union of India, [1973] 1 SCR
973 is also of no relevance since the finding was that the public
purpose mentioned in the Notifications were piecemeal or were
so vague as to cripple the Section 5A opportunity. The ratio of

Shri Mandir Sita Ramji -vs- Lt. Governor of Delhi, (1975) 4 SCC
298 and Shri Farid Ahmed Abdul Samad -vs- The Municipal
CW 2835/2000

51 of 82

Corporation of the City of Ahmedabad, (1976) 3 SCC 719 is that
a personal hearing under Section 5A of the Land Acquisition Act
is mandatory and does not depend on whether a personal hearing
was requested for or not.

17.

It has been contended that Section 17(1) and for this

reason Section 17(2) also, refer to publication of a notice under
Section 9 of the Act, and hence Section 5A has to be complied
with. However, it should not be overlooked that in the original
scheme of the statute Section 9 operated sans Section 5A and the
land-owner had the right to be heard only in the context of the
nature of his interest in the land and the

determination of

compensation for such interests. Whenever Section 17 has been
correctly invoked the inexorable consequence is that the
acquisition cannot be objected to (since Section 5A stands
dispensed with) resulting in the enquiry being restricted

to

quantum of compensation receivable by the persons interested in
the land prior to the Section 6 Declaration.

This position would

endure even post the invocation of Section 17 of the Act.

An

award would then be published in accordance with law and
procedure. No anomalous or contradictory situation is reached if
our analysis is accepted.

In Narendrajit Singh -vs- The State of U.P., 1970 (1)

SCC 125, Notification dated 15.10.1960 under Section 4(1) of
the Land Acquisition Act together with Section 17 (1) and (4) was
struck down as it was found to suffer from serious defect, in that
the locality of the land was not specified. The Notification merely
showed that the lands mentioned in the schedule were needed,
and the latter gave no particulars of the District, Pargana, Mauza
and approximate area. Their Lordships further observed that if
the intention of the Legislature was that in cases of urgency
Notification under Section 4(1) was not necessary, suitable
provision would have been made in Section 17 for that purpose.
The very same parties were before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Narendrajit Singh -vs- State of UP, 1973 1 SCC 157 and a
Notification dated 15.10.1960 under Section 4 of the Act was
quashed holding that the two conditions had not been satisfied
viz. the Notification had not been published and its substance
had not been properly disclosed.

State of Mysore -vs- Abdul

Razak Sahib, (1973) 3 SCC 196 and Collector (District
Magistrate) Allahabad -vs- Raja Ram Jaiswal, (1985) 3 SCC 1 are
also irrelevant for our purposes since in that case Section 4
Notification appears not to have been given due publicity in the
CW 2835/2000

53 of 82

concerned locality, thereby seriously curtailing the opportunity of
interested persons to file objections under Section 5A. In Madhya

Pradesh Housing Board -vs- Mohd. Shafl, (1992) 2 SCC 168 the
public purposes stated in the Notification under Sections 4 and
Section 6 were different leading to the conclusion by the Court
that non application of mind was manifestly obvious. This case
also has no relevance whatsoever. There is no quarrel before us
as to the proposition reiterated by their Lordships in R.L. Jain

-vs- DDA, (2004) 4 SCC 79 that publication of a notice under
Section 4(1) of the Act is a sine qua non for any proceedings
under the Act; it constitutes the springboard for such action.
Possession taken prior to the Section 4 Notification was held to
be illegal even in circumstances where Section 17(1) had been
invoked. The decision in Competent Authority -vs- Barangore Jute

Factory, JT 2005 10 SC 50 has also been relied upon by the
Petitioners.

Their Lordships came to the conclusion that the

acquisition could not be defended only on the ground that plot
numbers of the land in question of each Mouza had been given
since different pieces of land had been acquired either as a
whole or in part. The Notification failed to disclose the exact
particulars of the lands which were to be lost by the
owners/occupiers. Their Lordships further observed that the
CW 2835/2000

54 of 82

absence of a plan renders the right to file objections nugatory as
it was not possible to ascertain which part of the acquired land
was to be used and in what manner.

In spite of arriving at

this conclusion the Apex Court held that since the project had
already been completed no useful purpose would be served
in striking down the acquisition proceedings even though this
may not have been legally justified.

Instead their Lordships

determined a date on which the market value was to be
ascertained, which was much
Notification, which roughly

later than the date of the

corresponded to Section 4 of the

Act). By this device equitable relief was extended to the
owners/occupiers of the land.

19.

The conclusion that we have arrived at as a result of

the above discussion is that Section 17, as a composite whole, is
a pandect within the Land Acquisition Act, in much the same
manner in which Section 25B of the Delhi Rent Control Act has
been viewed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Section 17 deals
with the entire spectrum of emergencies which call for urgent
action leading to expropriation of private property. It empowers
the State to take possession of lands required for public purposes
in two categories of contingencies – (a) in urgent circumstances
CW 2835/2000

55 of 82

as adumbrated in the first sub-section enabling dispossession
after fifteen days and (b) situations specifically spelt out in the
second sub-section empowering immediate dispossession, i.e.
after two days. These provisions were available to the State from
the very inception of the Act, and had the result of permitting the
Government to take possession along with the publishing of a
notification under Section 4, leaving the matter of computing and
tendering compensation to follow. The introduction in 1923 of
the right to file Objections under Section 5A within thirty days of
the Section 4 Notification required necessary clarification that
where circumstances obtain necessitating urgent action, it could
be taken. This was clarified by the simultaneous inclusion of
Section 17(4), which notably does not have its own field of
operation, distinct of sub-sections (1) and (2). Therefore, once
the Government is subjectively satisfied that circumstances
chronicled in the first two sub-sections exist, the effect is the
suspension of the right to file Objections under Section 5A. In
the present case Section 17(1) has been resorted to, it would not
be open to the Authorities to take possession of the property till
the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the
Notification. We have come to this conclusion respectfully and
humbly mindful of observations made by their Lordships in
CW 2835/2000

56 of 82

Nandeshwar Prasad, Krishan Lal Arneja and Mukesh Hans,
in which cases the argument that separate orders under Section
17(4) are essential, were not raised.

20.

Proceeding on the basis that no legal impropriety or

infirmity has been committed in failing to make a mention of
Section 17(4) of the Act, the controversy is still not set at rest.
This is because it is axiomatic and uncontrovertable that the Lt.
Governor must, on the basis of material available in the records
placed before him, arrive at a soundly considered and informed
decision that such grave urgency exists as justifies overriding the
basic rights of the land owners, which partake the character of
fundamental rights. In State of Punjab -vs- Gurdial Singh, AIR
1980 SC 319 it has been observed that - “it is fundamental that
compulsory taking of a man's property is a serious matter and
the smaller the man the more serious the matter. Hearing him
before depriving him is both reasonable and preemptive of
arbitrariness, and denial of this administrative fairness is
constitutional anathema except for good reasons.

Save in real

urgency where public interest does not brook even the minimum
time needed to give a hearing, land acquisition authorities should
not, having regard to Article 14 & 19 of the Constitution of India,
CW 2835/2000

57 of 82

brook an inquiry under Section 17 of the Act. Here a slumbering
process, pending for years and suddenly exciting itself into
immediate forcible taking, makes a travesty of emergency
powers.” It is also trite that the attitude of the Administration
should be neither cavalier nor casual (Dora Phalauli -vs- State of

Punjab, (1979) 4 SCC 485). While we prefer not to get bogged
down by the semantics and syntax of Section 17, we are
unwilling to dilute the stringent rigours which must be satisfied
before the circumvention of Section 5A passes judicial muster.

21.

Learned counsel for the Respondents have sought to

make submissions before us which were patently not in the mind
of the Lt. Governor at the relevant time. Everyone must confine
oneself strictly to the records of those proceedings. If authority is
required for this proposition it can be found in the celebrated
decision in Mohinder Singh Gill

-vs- The Chief Election

Commissioner, New Delhi, AIR 1978 Supreme Court 851
paragraph 8 of which reads as follows:
“8. The second equally relevant matter is that when a
statutory functionary makes an order based on certain
grounds, its validity must be judged by the reasons so
mentioned and cannot be supplemented by fresh
reasons
CW 2835/2000

in

the

shape

of

affidavit

or

otherwise.
58 of 82

Otherwise, an order bad in the beginning may, by the
time it comes to court on account of a challenge, get
validated by additional grounds later brought out. We
may here draw attention to the observations of Bose J.
in Gordhandas Bhanji (AIR 1952 SC 16) (at p. 18):
“Public orders publicly made, in exercise of a
statutory authority cannot be construed in the light
of explanations subsequently given by the officer
making the order of what he meant, or of what was
in his mind, or what he intended to do.

Public

orders made by public authorities are meant to
have public effect and are intended to affect the
acting and conduct of those to whom they are
addressed and must be construed objectively with
reference to the language used in the order itself”.
Orders are not like old wine becoming better as they
grow older.
In similar vein, in Babu Verghese -vs- Bar Council of Kerala,
(1999) 3 SCC 422, the Apex Court was called upon to consider a
case under the Advocates Act. While doing so it applied the
same principles earlier enunciated in Taylor -vs- Taylor, (1875)
1 Ch D 426 and in Nazir Ahmad -vs- King Emporer, AIR 1936
Privy Council 253. The Apex Court observed as follows:
“It is the basic principles of law long settled that if the
manner of doing a particular act is prescribed under
any statute, the act must be done in that manner or not
at all. The origin of this rule traceable to the decision in
CW 2835/2000

59 of 82

Taylor Vs. Taylor which was followed by Lord Roche in
Nazir Ahmad Vs. King Emperor.”

22.

In an effort to justify the brevity of the approval

accorded by the Lt. Governor Mr. Sanjay Poddar, learned counsel
appearing for the LAC, has drawn our attention to the sixteen
Guidelines issued pertaining to the manner in which noting
should be written in Govt. Departments, which stipulate inter alia
that – (1) All notes will be concise and to the point. Lengthy notes
are to be avoided, (2) The verbatim reproduction of extracts from
or paraphrasing of the paper under consideration, fresh receipt,
or any other part of correspondence or notes on the same file,
should not be attempted,

(3) When passing orders or making

suggestions, an officer will confine his note to the actual points
he proposes to make without reiterating the ground already
covered in the previous notes. If he agrees to the line of action
suggested in the preceding note, he will merely append his
signature and (4) Any officer, who has to note upon a file on
which a running summary of facts is available till, in drawing
attention to the facts of the case, refer to the appropriate part of
the summary without repeating it in his own note etc. Based on
these Guidelines it is his submission that the Court should look
CW 2835/2000

60 of 82

upon the brevity in the notings with elasticity.

It is also his

submission that it is not essential to pass a reasoned order; if on
a perusal of record it is evident that the decision was predicated
on information placed before the Lt. Governor, which he duly
took into consideration, the final order should not be interfered
with. In Union of India -vs- Praveen Gupta, (1997) 9 SCC 78 their
Lordships have opined that the “decision on emergency is an
administrative decision and is a matter of subjective satisfaction
of the appropriate Government on the basis of the material
available on record. Therefore, there was no need to pass any
reasoned order to reach the conclusion that there is urgency so
as to dispense with the enquiry under Section 5A in exercise of
power under Section 17(4)”. The

contention is

that the

Legislature has taken care to speak only of the necessity of
`formation of an opinion', in Section 17(4) of the Act and if this
exercise and conclusion is discernible, the action should be
upheld. Mr. Poddar has underscored that a format for Section 17
action has not been prescribed.

23.

Mr. Sethi and Mr. Bansal, learned counsel for the

Petitioners, have contended that since the Lt. Governor has
refrained from mentioning Section 17(4) in his approval, even
CW 2835/2000

61 of 82

though it had been specifically mentioned in the notes and the
draft Notification placed before him, it is uncontrovertable that
his intention was that Section 5A should not be dispensed with.
This argument we have already rejected. The Petitioners assert
that possession of the acquired lands actually remains with them,
although the records indicate otherwise. The Petitioners are
running industrial or commercial businesses on the subject land
which are their only source of income and livelihood. On
6.5.1992 the DDA is stated to have issued a Notification under
Section 12(1) of the Delhi Development Act, declaring certain
areas which include the lands in question, to be Development
Area No.175. On 16.12.1996 Development Area No.175 was
renotified

with certain modifications and

Development Area No.179.

redesignated as

Meanwhile, on 27.10.1999 a

Notification invoking the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section
4 together with sub-sections (1) and (4) of Section 17 was issued,
thereby forfeiting the Petitioners' rights to file Objections under
Section 5A of the Act.

It has further been submitted that on

29.11.1999 the Sahbad Daulatpur Industries Welfare Association,
of which the Petitioners are members, represented to the
Government that the lands sought to be acquired have been built
upon. Whilst the Government was considering the regularisation
CW 2835/2000

62 of 82

of unauthorised colonies, steps to acquire the land of the
Petitioners has been initiated.

We must immediately and

categorically state that we are not aware of any legal embargo
against the acquisition of land that has been built upon; although
normally, the Government avoids such action.

It is equally a

legal misnomer that colonies which are likely to be regularised
cannot be acquired. Regularisation and acquisition of land and
property

are two distinct actions and cannot be confused or

merged with each other. The following observations of the Full
Bench from Roshanara Begum -vs- Union of India, AIR 1996
Delhi 206, approved in Murari -vs- Union of India, (1997) 1 SCC
15 scotch speculation on this issue:145. We are of the view that reasoning given by the
Division Bench in this judgment is quite sound and does
not call for any interference by us. Hence, mere fact that
certain areas have been built up or improved upon by the
persons concerned would not in any manner vitiate the
acquisition proceedings.
146. In case of Gandhi Grah Nirman Sahkari Samiti Ltd.
(AIR 1994 SC 2329) (supra), one of the contentions
raised was that the land sought to be acquired is already
being used for public purpose and has been properly
developed

and

thus

the

notifications

issued

for

acquisition of such land for public purpose be quashed.
The Supreme Court held that once it is clear that the
CW 2835/2000

63 of 82

acquisition is for public purpose, no fault can be found
with the proceedings on the ground that land is already
being used for some beneficial purpose. So, even if some
land has been developed by the land owner according to
his own notions and may be the construction raised by
him on the said land is also serving some public purpose,
still that cannot be a substitute for planned development
of Delhi which object is visualised by the authorities. If
the public object for which the land is sought to be
acquired by the authorities is justified, it cannot be
frustrated because the land owner has developed the
land and is utilising the land for some other public
purpose. So, this contention also does not survive in view
of the law held down by the Supreme Court.

24.

On 3.4.2000 a Declaration under Section 6 was

issued, which according to the Petitioners, was without due
publicity, with the result that the Petitioners were unaware of its
passing.

25.

The important question that must be answered is

whether the decision of the Lt. Governor to dispense with Section
5A, thereby forfeiting the Petitioners valuable rights of filing
Objections and remonstrating against the acquisition, has been
properly taken. It cannot possibly be over-emphasised that such
CW 2835/2000

64 of 82

a decision must be taken with due caution, with even greater
care than while deciding Objections under Section 5A. Judicial
review of such decisions would entail a jural investigation as to
whether there was adequate material before the Authority

Courts will be loathe to

substitute the subjective satisfaction of the Authority with their
own. Before Section 5A Objections are disposed of, the Objectors
must be given an opportunity of being heard. In the present case
it is palpably clear that the Lt. Governor had looked into the
ambit of Section 17(1) of the Act, and finding that the
circumstances postulated therein exist, had approved of the draft
Notification which clarified that the provisions of Section 5A
would not apply. We do not need to locate a reasoned order so
long as the impugned administrative decision appears to have
been taken on the basis of the material available on the record.
It has been faintly argued that keeping in view the hiatus
between the Section 4A Notification (27-10-1999) and the Section
6 Declaration (3-4-2000) the Respondents could easily have
invited Objections under Section 5A and disposed-off them
within a few months. In our opinion, even though it is legally
permissible for a Section 4 read with Section 17 Notification, to
CW 2835/2000

65 of 82

be followed the next day by Section 6 Declaration, the time that
has elapsed between the two, in the present case, is not
inordinately long. The Respondents have not displayed a lack of
urgency which would render the decision to bye-pass Section 5A
as colourable conduct.

26.

The

Section

4

Notification

dated

27-10-1999

proclaims that the lands mentioned therein are “likely to be
required to be taken by Government at public expense for a
public purpose namely Rohini Residential Scheme, Delhi”. We
have also noted that the Notification spells out in minute details
particulars of the lands which were within the contemplation of
that Notification. We make this observation for the reason that ,
quite inexplicably, other Notifications under Section 4 are
painfully bereft of necessary details. Keeping in view the
plethora of precedents requiring sufficient details of the locality
which is a subject matter of an acquisition we can suspect that
failure by Government to give full details is not merely
bureaucratic obduracy but may be calculated eventually to
defeat the acquisition. It will be recalled that in Mukesh Hans
the Court did not approve of the dispensing with Section 5A.
Their Lordships looked into the material available before the Lt.
CW 2835/2000

Governor for formation of an opinion on this far-reaching
question. The Hon'ble Court noted the absence of “any material

Their Lordships

further noticed that the “earlier attempt to acquire 40 bighas of
land for the very same purpose was allowed to be lapsed” which
is a relevant factor for taking a decision in the context of Section
5A. In Union of India -vs- Deepak Bhardwaj, 2004(72) DRJ 476
the Court was of the view that the subject schemes for
improvement of facilities and amenities in rural areas did not
suggest emergencies or urgencies sufficient to invoke Section 17
and dispense with Section 5A. In Om Prakash -vs- State of U.P.,
1998 (6) SCC 1 the Hon'ble Supreme Court disallowed waiver of
Section 5A in order to set-up the New Okhla Industrial
Development Area (NOIDA). In Nandeshwar Prasad -vs- The

State of U.P., [1964] 3 SCR 425 the attempt to circumvent
Section 5A for construction of subsidised industrial tenements
was thwarted by the Apex Court. The factual matrix in Sarju

Prasad Sinha -vs- The State of U.P., AIR 1965 SC 1763 was that
pursuant to a June 1955 Notification under Section 4, Objections
CW 2835/2000

67 of 82

under Section 5A had been entertained; Officer in his Report
recommended that the subject land be exempted from acquisition
and the proposal was abandoned. But in November, 1960 a fresh
notification under Section 4(1) was issued, this time dispensing
with Section 5A. Expectedly, this attempt was rendered futile by
the Supreme Court.

27.

In Praveen Jain -vs- UOI, 2002(99) DLT 646 the

Division Bench presided over by S.B. Sinha, Chief Justice, as his
Lordship then was, pointed out that the official notings showed
that the possession of the land was not required to be obtained
on an emergent basis and that the idea of invoking Section 17
was “the brain child of the Office Superintendent of the Land
Acquisition Department whence for the first time he directed
Shri Kwatara to type draft notification under Sections 4, 6 and 17
(1) of the Acquisition Act. Even at that point of time there was no
material to show that the provisions of Sections 17(4) of the Act
was required to be invoked”.

A piquant situation had arisen

before the Full Bench of this Court in Smt. Ram Rakhi -vs- Union

of India, 2002 V AD (Delhi) 572. While hearing a criminal writ
petition the Division Bench had directed the DDA to take steps
urgently to acquire the land in question and further directed
CW 2835/2000

68 of 82

them to take possession thereof and hand it over to the Police
Authorities with a view to providing access to the Krishna Nagar
Police Station. Predicated on these directions a Notification
under Section 4 read with Section 17(1) and Sections 17(4) was
issued. On a challenge laid by the owner of the land it was held
by the Full Bench, again presided over by S.B. Sinha, Chief
Justice, as his Lordship then was, that the records did not show
that there had been any independent application of mind.

The

Notification was accordingly set aside, thereby rendering the
directions of

the

Division Bench nugatory. This

decision

highlights the fact that the Courts have always zealously guarded
and preserved the rights of the land owners to object to the
acquisition of their lands without due process of law being
adhered to by the appropriate Authority. In Union of India -vs-

Krishan Lal Arneja, AIR 2004 SC 3582 fourteen properties were
notified for acquisition under Section 4 and Section 17(1) and
Section 17(4) of the Act which action was struck down by this
Court.

The Appeal of the UOI was dismissed by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court. The properties were requisitioned under the
provisions of Defence of India Rules and the provisions of
Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property, 1952
were to be lapsed in March, 1987. Their Lordships opined that
CW 2835/2000

69 of 82

the UOI had almost two years to acquire these properties by
pursuing the usual remedies, without depriving the respondents
of their valuable rights to file Objections against the acquisition.
Invocation of the Urgency Clause was held to be without
justification.

The Full Bench of this Court in S.K. Gupta -vs-

Union of India, AIR 1977 Delhi 209 noted the absence of even a
recital that there was urgency in the matter, leaving unfulfilled
even the perfunctory discharge of the burden of proof. In

Narayan Govind Gavate -vs- State of Maharashtra, AIR 1977 SC
183 the Section 4 and Section 17(4) Notification dated
11.10.1963 recited the public purpose as “development and
utilisation of the said land as a residential and industrial area”.
Their Lordships held that the burden of proof lay on the State of
Maharashtra, and that it had not been satisfactorily discharged.
Their Lordships then affirmed that at least a subjective opinion
had to be formed regarding the need to take action under Section
17(4) of the Act but this exercise had not been satisfactorily and
sufficiently undertaken. It was opined that development of an
area for industrial and residential purposes, on the face of it,
barring

exceptional

circumstances,

did

not

justify

taking

immediate possession of the land without holding any summary
inquiry under Section 5A of the Act. “On the other hand, such
CW 2835/2000

70 of 82

schemes generally take sufficient period of time to enable
summary inquiries under Section 5A to be completed without any
impediment whatsoever to the

execution of

the scheme.

Therefore, the very statement of the public purpose for which the
land was to be required indicated the absence of such urgency,
on the apparent facts of the case, as to require the elimination of
an inquiry under Section 5A of the Act”.

Remarkably, the

decision of the Supreme Court of three-Judge Bench titled

Munshi Singh -vs- Union of India, (1973) 2 SCC 337 = AIR 1973
SC 1150 had not been cited before their Lordships. In Munshi

Singh Section 17 had not been resorted to. Even then the
statement of public purpose and the Notification viz. “planned
development of the area” was found not to be sufficiently
satisfactory to enable the exercise of rights under Section 5A. It
must be mentioned that Gavate has not found favour by larger
Benches of the Apex Court in State of UP -vs- Pista Devi, (1986) 4
SCC 251 Chameli Singh -vs- State of U.P., 1996 (2) SCC 549
and Deepak Pahwa -vs- Lt. Governor of Delhi, (1984) 4 SCC 308.

28.

While there are several decisions in additions to

those briefly dealt by us above striking down the wield of Section
17 to nullify the rights contained in Section 5A, on the other side
CW 2835/2000

71 of 82

of the watershed there are a few precedents where this approach
has not met with the disapproval of the Court. We cannot lose
sight of the fact that there is a Constitutional confirmation that
no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of
law.

The following concise exposition of the law is available in

Chameli Singh :
15. The question, therefore, is whether invocation of
urgency clause under Section 17(4) dispensing with
inquiry under Section 5-A is arbitrary or is unwarranted
for providing housing construction for the poor. In
Aflatoon v. Lt. Governor, Delhi, (1975) 4 SCC 285 a
Constitution Bench of this Court had upheld the exercise
of the power by the State under Section 17(4) dispensing
with the inquiry under Section 5-A for the planned
development of Delhi. In Pista Devi case, this Court while
considering the legality of the exercise of the power
under Section 17(4) exercised by the State Government
dispensing with the inquiry under Section 5-A for
acquiring

housing

accommodation

for

planned

development of Meerut, had held that providing housing
accommodation is national urgency of which Court
should take judicial notice. The pre-notification and postnotification delay caused by the officer concerned does
not create a cause to hold that there is no urgency.
Housing conditions of Dalits all over the country
continue to be miserable even till date and is a fact of
which courts are bound to take judicial notice. The ratio

CW 2835/2000

72 of 82

of Deepak Pahwa's case (supra) was followed. In that
case a three-Judge Bench of this Court had upheld the
notification issued under Section 17(4), even though
lapse of time of 8 years had occurred due to interDepartmental

discussions

before

receiving

the

notification. That itself was considered to be a ground to
invoke urgency clause. It was further held that delay on
the part of the lethargic officials to take further action in
the matter of acquisition was not sufficient to nullify the
urgency which existed at the time of the issuance of the
notification and to hold that there was never any
urgency. In Jaga Ram v. State of Haryana, (1971) 1 SCC
671 this Court upheld the exercise of the power of
urgency under Section 17(4) and had held that the
lethargy on the part of the officers at an early stage was
not relevant to decide whether on the day of the
notification there was urgency or not. Conclusion of the
Government

that

there

was

urgency,

though

not

conclusive, is entitled to create weight. In Deepak
Pahwa's case this Court had held that very often persons
interested in the land proposed to be acquired may make
representations to the authorities concerned against the
proposed writ petition that is bound to result in
multiplicity

of

enquiries,

communications

and

discussions leading invariably to delay in the execution
of even urgent projects. Very often delay makes the
problem more and more acute and increases urgency of
the necessity for acquisition. In Rajasthan Housing Board
v. Shri Kishan, (1993) 2 SCC 84 this Court had held that

CW 2835/2000

73 of 82

it must be remembered that the satisfaction under
Section 17(4) is subjective one and that so long as there
is material upon which Government could have formed
the said satisfaction fairly, the Court would not interfere
nor would it examine the material as an appellate
authority. In State of U.P. v. Keshav Prasad Singh, (1995)
5 SCC 587 this Court had held that the Government was
entitled to exercise the power under Section 17(4)
invoking urgency clause and to dispense with inquiry
under Section 5-A when the urgency was noticed on the
facts available on record. In Narayana Govind Gavate's
case (supra) a three-Judge Bench of this Court had held
that Section 17(4) cannot be read in isolation from
Section 4(1) and Section 5-A of the Act. Although 30 days
from the notification under Section 4(1) are given for
filing objections under Section 5-A inquiry thereunder
unduly gets prolonged. It is difficult to see why the
summary

inquiry

could

not

be

completed

quite

expeditiously. Nonetheless, this Court held the existence
of prima facie public purpose such as the one present in
those cases before the Court could not be successfully
challenged at all by the objectors. It further held that it
was open to the authority to take summary inquiry under
Section 5-A and to complete inquiry very expeditiously. It
was emphasised that:
...The mind of the Officer or authority concerned has
to be applied to the question whether there is an
urgency of such a nature that even the summary
proceedings under Section 5-A of the Act should be

CW 2835/2000

74 of 82

eliminated. It is not just the existence of an urgency
but the need to dispense with an inquiry under Section
5-A which has to be considered.
16. It would thus be seen that this Court emphasised the
holding of an inquiry on the facts peculiar to that case.
Very often the officials, due to apathy in implementation
of the policy and programmes of the Government,
themselves adopt dilatory tactics to create cause for the
owner of the land to challenge the validity or legality of
the exercise of the power to defeat the urgency existing
on the date of taking decision under Section 17(4) to
dispense with Section 5-A inquiry.
17. It is true that there was pre- notification and postnotification delay on the part of the officers to finalise
and publish the notification. But those facts were present
before the Government when it invoked urgency clause
and dispensed with inquiry under Section 5-A. As held by
this Court, the delay by itself accelerates the urgency:
Larger the delay, greater be the urgency. So long as the
unhygienic conditions and deplorable housing needs of
Dalits, Tribes and the poor are not solved or fulfilled, the
urgency continues to subsist. When the Government on
the basis of the material, constitutional and international
obligation, formed its opinion of urgency, the Court, not
being an appellate forum, would not disturb the finding
unless the Court conclusively finds the exercise of the
power mala fide. Providing house sites to the Dalits,
Tribes and the poor itself is a National problem, and a
Constitutional obligation. So long as the problem is not

CW 2835/2000

75 of 82

solved and the need is not fulfilled, the urgency
continues to subsist. The State is expending money to
relieve the deplorable housing condition in which they
live by providing decent housing accommodation with
better sanitary conditions. The lethargy on the part of the
officers for pre and post-notification delay would not
render the exercise of the power to invoke urgency
clause invalid on that account

29.

Chameli Singh was decided without reference to

the earlier decision of the Supreme Court in Krishi Utpadan

Mandi Samiti, Muzaffarnagar (U.P) -vs- Ratan Prakash Mangal,
AIR 1988 SC 1459 but the following extracts therefrom will
disclose the continuity of thinking of the Apex Court on this
complex issue:
13. .... As regards the submission that Section 17(4) of
the Act has been erroneously invoked in the fresh
Notification under Section 4(1) dated 20th May, 1982 also
and that inquiry under Section 5-A had again to be made
before issuing this Notification, suffice it to point out that
once an inquiry under the said Section had already been
made and the parties had been given full opportunity to
substantiate their case in the said inquiry and the State
Government was not inclined to agree with the report of
the Land Acquisition Officer submitted in pursuance of
that inquiry it would have been a futile exercise to repeat
the whole performance again.
CW 2835/2000

After the issue of the
76 of 82

earlier Notification dated 26th October, 1978 a period of
nearly

3-1/2

years

had

expired

when

the

fresh

Notification dated 20th May, 1982 under Section 4(1) was
issued and apparently the necessity to acquire Plot
No.289 during this period became more acute due to this
delay. Further, as stated in the Notification dated 20th
May, 1982 itself the urgency had become more imminent
on account of the direction issued by this Court on 2nd
March, 1982 in Writ Petition No.1318 of 1982 filed by the
traders challenging the Notification under Section 7(2)
(B) of U.P. Act No.25 of 1964. Consequently, we find it
difficult to hold that the opinion of the State Government
that it was a fit case to invoke Section 17(4) of the Act
was invalid on the ground that there was no basis or
material in support of that opinion. We are further of the
view that on the facts indicated above it is also not
possible to hold that the Notification dated 20th May,
1982 had been issued by the State Government in
colourable exercise of its power.

30.

In Balmokand Khatri Educational and Industrial

Trust -vs- State of Punjab, (1996) 4 SCC 212 the argument that
urgency mentioned could have brooked a delay of thirty days was
rejected since the project was earmarked for distribution to
landless labour. Chameli Singh was applied and Gavate was
not seen as an impediment in the waiver by the State of Section
5A by resort to Section 17 of the Act.
CW 2835/2000

31.

In Sandhya Educational Society -vs- UOI,

the

Division Bench of the Court has followed and applied Krishi

Utpadan in upholding the legality of invocation of Section 17
of the Act where an award was not passed in respect of the
subject land, although an opportunity of hearing had been
granted to the owner prior to a Declaration under Section 6 of
the Act.

32.

Mr. Mehta, learned Senior Counsel for the DDA, has

taken us through the pleadings and the Representations
addressed by the Petitioners for the Release of their lands and
property from the proposed acquisition. His emphasis is on the
aspect of equities; that a writ petition would ordinarily not be
entertained if equity is not on the side of the Petitioners. He
contends that the admitted position is that the use of the area is
residential, and with full knowledge thereof the Petitioners are
using it for commercial or factory purposes. The Petitioners are
themselves guilty of violation of the land use, thereby disentitling
themselves from any discretionary relief.

In fact, some of the

Petitioners have gone to the extent of purchasing lands with the
specific intent to put it to non-conforming use. We are of the
CW 2835/2000

78 of 82

opinion that any party which invokes the extraordinary powers
preserved to the High Court under Article 226 should not be
tainted with violating the law in respect of the object in respect
of which relief is prayed for in the writ petition. We would also
dismiss the petitions on this ground.

33.

We must record that there was no challenge to the

subject acquisition on the grounds that it was not predicated on
public purposes viz. planned development of Delhi as is also
palpable from the Written Arguments filed on behalf of the
Petitioners.

The assertion of the Respondents that the land is

earmarked for Phases IV and V of the rohini Residential Scheme
has not been challenged. Mr. Poddar has submitted that
previously a Notification under Section 4 had been issued on 4-41964 (in which Section 17 had not been resorted to) followed by
a Declaration under Section 6 on 7-12-1966. The challenge laid
to these proceedings ended with the decision in Roshanara

Begum, but since Award could not be passed within the
statutory period, the acquisition lapsed in regard to those lands.
Hence the need to proclaim the second and subject acquisition
proceedings. The Respondents have progressed with apparent
speed and urgency since the Notification under Section 4 read

petitions came to be filed as a fallout thereto in May 2000 and
owing to interim orders passed by this Court the development
plans perforce had to be temporarily halted.

34.

We shall now endeavour to apply the law to the facts

of the case. The statute enjoins the formation of an opinion by
the appropriate Government to the effect that the prevailing
circumstances

are

of

such

urgency

that

the

acquisition

proceedings can proceed directly to the promulgation of a
Declaration under Section 6, thereby annihilating the valuable
rights of remonstrating against the expropriation. The subjective
satisfaction is that of the appropriate Government which need not
be articulated in precise words; it would suffice if the subjective
satisfaction is discernible by the Courts exercising judicial review
from the material available in the records placed before the
appropriate Government at the time when the opinion is formed.
Extraneous considerations, not in the mind of the appropriate
Authority, must be excluded. The most fundamental factor is the
prevalence of public purpose; which issue Mr. Sethi has not
assailed at all. If this susceptible question had been worthy of
CW 2835/2000

80 of 82

discussion Mr. Sethi would have raised the debate.

General

principles of procedural law, as expressed inter alia in Order II of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, preclude truncated or
piecemeal deliberation of issues which have already arisen.
Nevertheless, we have perused the proceedings and discussion
that have taken place at different echelons of the appropriate
Government, as gleaned from the notings and correspondence on
the subject. We find that there was abundant material available
for forming a subjective opinion that public purpose would be
subserved through the acquisition, and that there was sufficient
urgency in invoking the provisions of Section 17 valuable but not
unalienable of the Act fully mindful that the consequence was the
deprivation of the rights of persons having an interest in the land
of filing Objections under Section 5A of the Act. Resistence to
public

projects arises

when

the

Government attempts to

circumvent its duty to pay the realistic compensation for acquired
land. When the motivation of the Government is predicated on
profit derivation the action can be seen as mala fide or devoid of
public purpose.

Corrective steps can be found by enhancing
Equally, we would be loathe to assist persons

from unjustly enriching themselves by earning compensation
beyond the date of the Section 4 Notification by adopting a
CW 2835/2000

81 of 82

sophistic approach which locates semantic shortcoming while
ignoring the genuine purpose of the appropriate government .
The pendency of these writ petitions has caused undue delay in
the completion of a salutary public project, and we would
ordinarily have burdened the petitioners with exemplary costs.
We, however, desist from doing so.
