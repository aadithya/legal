DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ. (ORAL)

1.

We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties

on this appeal, which is filed by the defendant No.1 (appellant
herein) being aggrieved by the order passed by the learned Single
Judge in dismissing his application seeking for amendment of the
written statement. The suit was instituted by the respondent No.1.
Written statement in the said suit was filed by the defendant No.1 on
10th February, 2003. Issues in the suit were framed on 31st August,

2004. The learned Single Judge thereafter passed an order that the
evidence in the suit shall be recorded by a local commissioner who
was appointed. An affidavit by way of evidence was also filed by
the respondent-plaintiff on 23rd October, 2004. After the aforesaid
affidavit by way of evidence was filed, an application was filed by
the appellant praying for amendment of his written statement. The
said application was dated 25th January, 2005. The application was
contested by the respondent contending, inter alia, that since the
trial has commenced, no such application seeking for amendment
of the written statement could be entertained at that stage. The
aforesaid contention of the counsel appearing for the respondent
found favour with the learned Single Judge, who passed the
impugned order dismissing the application for amendment filed by
the defendant No.1 (appellant herein).
2.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the present appeal is filed

on which we have heard the learned counsel appearing for the
parties. There is no denial of the fact that on the day when the said
application seeking for amendment of the written statement was
filed by the defendant No.1, the trial had commenced, inasmuch
as the plaintiff's affidavit by way of evidence was directed to be
filed and was in fact filed. However, the amendment which was
sought for was to the following effect:
“AMENDED PARA NO.2 OF PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS
OF WRITTEN STATEMENT:
That the property bearing No.1486, Chandni Chowk,
FAO(OS) 284/2005

Page 2 of 5

Delhi was purchased by the firm M/s Music Mahal in
the year 1984. The entire consideration amount for
the purchase of this property was paid by the firm
M/s Music Mahal to the vendor of the property and
the consideration amount of Rs.48,000/- was paid
by eight bank drafts bearing No.035177, 035178,
035179, 035180, 035181, 035182, 035183 and
035184, dated 12.10.1984, all drawn on Union Bank
of India, Connaught Place Branch, New Delhi. All
these bank drafts were made from the account of
M/s Music Mahal and the entire consideration
amount was paid by M/s Music Mahal to the person
from whom the property was purchased by M/s
Music Mahal. This firm M/s Music Mahal consisted
of four partners, namely, (i) Smt. Sumedha Devi, W/o
Shri Bhagwan Dass, (ii) Smt. Krishna Devi, W/o Shri
Ramesh Nagpal, (iii) Shri Avinash Rajpal, S/o Shri
Bhagwan Dass, (iv) Shri Ajay Rajpal, defendant no.1.
Right from the year 1984, this property bearing
no.1486, Chandni Chowk, Delhi has been shown to
be owned by M/s Music Mahal by all these partners
in the accounts books and in the returns filed with
the Income Tax Department. The Balance Sheet of
M/s Music Mahal was signed by all the four partners
admitting and acknowledging the fact that this
property No.1486, Chandni Chowk, Delhi is owned
by M/s Music Mahal and the property belongs to
M/s Music Mahal.”
3.

In the original written statement, paragraph 2 was stated thus:
“2. That the property bearing No.1486, Chandni
Chowk, Delhi, was purchased by the firm M/s Music
Mahal in the year 1982. The entire consideration
amount for the purchase of the property was paid
by the firm M/s Music Mahal. This firm M/s Music
Mahal consisted of four partners, namely, (i) Smt.
Sumedha Devi, W/o Shri Bhagwan Dass, (ii) Smt.
Krishna Devi, W/o Shri Ramesh Rajpal, (iii) Shri
Avinash Rajpal, S/o Shri Bhagwan Dass, (iv) Shri Ajay
Rajpal, defendant no.1. Right from the year. Right
from the year 1982, this property bearing no.1486,
Chandni Chowk, Delhi has been shown to be
owned by M/s Music Mahal by all these partners in
the accounts books and in the returns filed with the
Income Tax Department. The Balance Sheet of the
firm M/s Music Mahal was signed by all the four

partners admitting and acknowledging the fact
that this property bearing No.1486, Chandni Chowk,
Delhi is owned by the firm M/s Music Mahal and the
property belongs to M/s Music Mahal.”
A comparative reading of both the paragraphs would show

that what was sought to be included by the appellant-defendant
by way of amendment was the giving of better particulars by way
of elucidation of facts already existing in paragraph 2.

These

particulars, in our considered opinion, could be brought on record
even by way of evidence, inasmuch as it is well settled law by now
that the entire evidence may not be set out in the pleadings of the
parties. What is required to be stated in the pleadings of the parties
are the material facts and not material particulars which are part of
the proof and could be adduced at the time of trial. On going
through the records, we are of the considered opinion that the
statements which were sought to be incorporated by way of
amendment of paragraph 2 of the written statement are, in fact,
material particulars which could be even otherwise brought on
record by adducing evidence.

Counsel appearing for the

respondent also states that such evidence, which is stated in
paragraph 2, could be adduced at the time of evidence.
5.

In that view of the matter,

we dispose of this appeal

observing that whatever is stated by way of amendment could be
allowed to be adduced through evidence at the time of trial and
that the respondent would have no objection to the adducing of
the same at the time of trial.
FAO(OS) 284/2005

The suit is already delayed by a
Page 4 of 5

number of years and, therefore, we are of the considered opinion
that the suit should be heard giving priority to the same, as
expeditiously as possible. The parties shall now appear before the
learned Single Judge on 9th April, 2008 when further dates in the trial
shall be fixed. The hearing of the suit shall be expedited and the
same shall be completed as expeditiously as possible. The prayer for
holding the trial on day-to-day basis could also be considered by
the learned Single Judge. However, so far the costs awarded by
the learned Single Judge are concerned, the same stand quashed.
