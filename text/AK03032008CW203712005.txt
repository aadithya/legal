holding that the action of the management of UTI in dismissing the
workman Sh.J.C.Katyal is not justified and the workman is entitled to
be reinstated in the service from 17th December, 1987 after withholding
two increments with cumulative effect along with full back wages within
one month from the publication of the award. In writ petition
No.20371/2005 the workman is seeking setting aside of the order dated
3rd February, 2005 and award dated 28th April, 2005 to the extent of
award of punishment of withholding of two increments with cumulative
effect.

2.

The learned counsel for the management has contended that two

distinct charges were framed against the workman. The first charge was
regarding the workman marking his attendance and thereafter leaving
the premises unauthorizedly after initialing the time in the attendance
record on various dates in June and July, 1984. The second charge
against the workman was that the application of the workman for
ordinary leave from 18th July, 1984 to 28th July, 1984 and extension
upto 3rd August, 1984 was not accepted and the workman was advised
to report for duty, however, the workman did not report for duty till 4th
August, 1984 and thus remained absent unauthorisedly and the
workman thereafter also remained absent unauthorisedly from 13th to
18th August, 1984 and 22nd August, 1984 till 27th August, 1984.

3.

The learned counsel for the management has contended that the

learned Central Government Industrial Tribunal has not considered the
punishment awarded on account of first charge i.e workman was
coming to the office during June & July, 1984 marking his presence
and thereafter leaving the office un-authorizedly and after considering
the second charge regarding remaining absent in July and August,
1984 for various periods without sanctioned leave un-authorizedly and
has set aside the dismissal of the workman and has awarded
punishment of withholding of two increments with cumulative effect.

4.

The learned counsel for the workman does not dispute that the

learned Central Government Industrial Tribunal has not considered the
order of the authorities regarding imposition of punishment on account
of first charge which was on account of petitioner coming to the office
marking his presence in the attendance record and leaving the premises
of the office unauthorisedly.

5.

In the circumstances the learned counsel for the parties also do

not have any objection to the award dated 28th April, 2005 being set
aside and matter being remanded to Central Government Industrial
Tribunal cum Labour Court-II for rehearing and decision on all the
pleas and contentions of the parties.

6.

The learned counsel for the workman has also contended that

even after the award dated 28th April, 2005 the workman has remained
unemployed and it will be just and appropriate, if the workman is
allowed to establish that he has remained un-employed. The learned
counsel for the management has contended that the workman is
gainfully employed and has refuted the plea of the workman that he has
remained un-employed.

7.

In the circumstances the award dated 28th April, 2005 in Case

no.2/92 is set aside and the matter is remanded to Central Government
Industrial

Tribunal

Cum

Labour

Court-II

for

rehearing

and

redetermination of the disputes between the parties. The parties are ,
however, allowed an opportunity to lead evidence in respect of
employment, if any, of the workman Sh.J.C.Katyal. Since the matter is
very old, it is desired that the Industrial Tribunal shall dispose of the
reference preferably within six weeks. Parties are directed to appear
before Central Government Industrial Tribunal Cum Labour Court-II on
7th April, 2008. Writ petitions and all the pending applications are
disposed of with these directions. Parties to bear their own costs.
Dasti to the parties.
