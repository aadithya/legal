Government at the instance of the workman made a reference to the
Labour Court on the following terms:
“Whether Shri Prem Kumar has abandoned his job
or services or services have been terminated
illegally and/or unjustifiably by the management,
and if so, to what relief is he entitled and what
directions are necessary in this respect.”
3.The authorized representative of the appellant entered appearance
before the Labour Court and filed a written statement to the claim filed
by the workman. Issues were also framed on 27 th January, 1999 in the
presence of the representatives of the parties and the matter was
adjourned for 18th August, 1999 and thereafter it was adjourned to 19th
May, 2000. Thereafter the matter was adjourned from time to time.
When the matter was listed on 26th February, 2001, none appeared on
behalf of the appellant due to which the matter was adjourned to 13 th
June, 2001 and thereafter to 1st October, 2001. The matter was again
adjourned to 3rd October, 2001.

On all the aforesaid dates, none

appeared on behalf of the management – appellant.

Due to the

aforesaid position, the Labour Court had no other option but to order
for proceeding ex parte as against the management – appellant and
ultimately ex parte award came to be passed on 21st September, 2002.
It is thus established from the records that from 18th of August, 1999
onwards none appeared on behalf of the management – appellant till
the ex parte award was passed on 21st September, 2002. However,

after passing of the aforesaid award, an application was filed by the
appellant for the first time on 17th March, 2003, which was filed under
the provisions of Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure
seeking for setting aside the ex parte award passed against the
management – appellant.
consideration.

The said application was taken up for

The Labour Court, however, dismissed the said

application relying on the decisions of this Court in Parminder Singh

v.

Delhi

Development Authority reported as 2003 IV AD (Delhi) 299 holding
that no efforts were made either by the authorized representative of
the management or the management itself to know about the status of
the case, and consequently no sufficient cause was made out for
setting aside the ex parte award.

The Labour Court was of the

considered opinion that the ratio of the aforesaid decisions squarely
applied to the facts of the case. It was also recorded by the Labour
Court that nowhere in the application filed under Order IX Rule 13 of
the Code of Civil Procedure it was even mentioned by the management
– appellant as to how the management – appellant came to know about
the passing of the ex parte award. The Labour Court also relied on the
fact that no efforts were made either by the management or the
authorized representative to know the status of the case from 26th

February, 2001 till 21st September, 2002, when the ex parte award was
passed, and also even before filing of the application dated 17th March,
2003.
4.Being aggrieved by the said order passed by the Labour Court, a writ
petition was filed, which was considered by the learned Single Judge,
who after referring to the facts of the case and also taking note of the
negligence of the appellant in pursuing the matter, dismissed the writ
petition.
5.Being aggrieved by the said order, now this appeal is filed on which
we have heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant and
also the counsel appearing for the State Government.
6.Similar pleas are also raised before us contending, inter alia, that the
respondent – workman had abandoned his services and, therefore, the
appellant could not have been saddled with the aforesaid liability. The
counsel has further submitted that the learned Single Judge as also the
Labour Court were not justified in holding that there was lack of bona
fides on the part of the appellant.
7.We are, however, not persuaded to accept the aforesaid submissions.
The facts delineated hereinbefore clearly make out a case of
negligence and the absence of due diligence on the part of the
appellant. The absence of the appellant from the proceedings during
the period from 26th February, 2001 till 21st September, 2002 stands
LPA No.136/2008

established.

There is no reasonable explanation nor any sufficient

cause is made out for the said absence of the appellant and its failure
to pursue the proceedings. We, therefore, hold that there is no merit
in this appeal, which is dismissed.
8.At this stage, counsel appearing for the appellant states that the
appellant may be given four months time to enable the appellant to
pay the amount, with which the appellant / management is saddled.
He may file an appropriate application before the Labour Court for the
aforesaid relief, which, when filed, shall be considered by the Labour
Court in accordance with law.
