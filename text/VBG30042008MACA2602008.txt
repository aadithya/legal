V.B.Gupta, J.
The present appeal has been filed by the appellants
against the impugned judgment dated 07.01.08 passed by
Sh. Gulshan Kumar, Judge, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal
MAC APP. No.260/2008

Page 2 of 9

(for short as “Tribunal”), Rohini, Delhi, for enhancement of
the compensation amount.
2.

In a nutshell, the facts relevant for the purpose of

dealing with this appeal are as follows:
3.

On 25.04.06 at about 1.25 a.m., the deceased

Himanshu Das along with his neighbors were sleeping on
Central Verge/Road divider, Ring Road, Ganda Nala, Near
CNG, Petrol Pump, West Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi. In the
meantime, one Indica car bearing no. DL-9CC-6219 came
from the side of Punjabi Bagh and was giving towards Raja
Garden, in a rash and negligent manner. The driver of the
said Indica car, without observing the traffic norms hit and
boarded on Central Verge and crushed the deceased along
with his neighbors. Deceased, Himanshu Das died on the
spot but was taken to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital,
where he was declared brought dead.
4.

A petition seeking compensation was filed by the

parents, widow and children of the deceased against the
MAC APP. No.260/2008

Page 3 of 9

driver, owner and insurer of the Indica car No. DL-9CC6219.
5.

The Tribunal vide impugned judgment, awarded

compensation of Rs.3,43,516/- with interest @ 6.5% p.a. in
favour of the appellants from the date of filing the petition
till realization.
6.

Not satisfied with the award, the appellants have

preferred the present appeal, seeking enhancement of the
compensation.
7.

It has been contended by Learned Counsel for the

appellants that deceased was working as Raj Mistri/Mason
and the same comes under the category of skilled worker;
hence, the Tribunal erred in considering the income of the
deceased on the basis of Minimum Wages of unskilled
worker. The Tribunal has not considered the income of the
deceased as per his vocation. Further, the Tribunal has not
considered the future prospects and future rise in income
of the deceased at the time of assessment of compensation.
MAC APP. No.260/2008

Page 4 of 9

As per the various judgments of this Court and Apex Court
no amount is to be deducted towards self-expenses of the
deceased when the Tribunal has considered the income of
the deceased on the basis of Minimum Wages act, whereas,
the Tribunal had deducted ¼th amount of income towards
self-expenses of the deceased which is very high because
the deceased left behind ten family members.
8.

Thus,

the

determination

in

principal
this

question

appeal

is

that

that

arises

for

“Whether

the

compensation awarded by the learned Tribunal is just or
not?”
9.

It was well established before the Tribunal by the

testimony of PW-1 Sh. Jotish Kumar, son of deceased
considered along with the other documents i.e. the charge
sheet, FIR, post-mortem report etc., that deceased Sh.
Himanshu Das died on 25-04-06

in accident due to rash

and negligent driving of the Indica car No. DL-9CC-6219.

MAC APP. No.260/2008

10.

There

was

no

proof

of

income,

experience

or

educational qualification of deceased on record to show
that deceased was a skilled workman. After evaluating the
evidence, the Tribunal treated the deceased as unskilled
worker and as per the notification issued by Delhi
government, the minimum wages of an unskilled workman
as on the date of accident was Rs.3,217/- per month, hence
the same was rightly taken as monthly income of the
deceased by the Tribunal.
11.

Regarding the future prospects, the same cannot be

granted unless there is evidence to this effect on record.
There is no evidence on record to prove that the deceased
was in a trade where he would have earned more from time
to time or he had special merit or qualification or
opportunities which would have led to an improvement in
his income. Therefore, in view of Bijoy Kumar Duggar v.

Bidagar Dutta AIR 2006 SC 1255, the contention
regarding the future prospects is rejected.

MAC APP. No.260/2008

12.

The next question which arises for consideration is as

to what multiplier should be adopted to calculate the
compensation?
13.

At the time of accident, the age of the deceased was

51 years as per election Card which was made in 1995
showing

his

age

40

years.

Therefore,

in

these

circumstances, a multiplier of 11 has to be applied as per
Schedule II of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short as
“Act”)by the Tribunal which has been rightly done by the
learned Tribunal.
14.

As regards the loss of dependency, the deceased is

admittedly survived by his wife, parents and children. In a
plethora of cases, the Apex Court and various High Courts
have held that 1/3rd amount of the income should be
deducted towards self-expenses. The tribunal had already
deducted ¼th amount of income towards self expenses,
which is more than reasonable. I am, therefore, not
inclined to take any contrary opinion, thus, there is no

MAC APP. No.260/2008

Page 7 of 9

scope for further deduction.
15.

As regards the award of interest @ 6.5% per annum

by the Tribunal, in Abati Bezbaruah v. Deputy Director

General, Geological Survey of India,

(2003) 3 SCC

148, the Apex Court has observed as under;
“The question as to what should be rate of interest,
in the opinion of this Court, would depend upon the
facts and circumstances of each case. Award of
interest would normally depend upon the bank rate
prevailing at the relevant time.”
16.

In view of the above decision, I am of the opinion that

the award of interest @ 6.5% cannot be considered to be
lower side. I am, therefore, not inclined to interfere in the
discretion exercised by the Tribunal in awarding 6.5%
interest on the award amount.
17.

Keeping in view all the facts and circumstances

brought on record, I am of the view that the compensation
as awarded by the learned tribunal is just and fair.
Accordingly, no infirmity can be found with the order of
learned Tribunal.
MAC APP. No.260/2008

The present appeal is, therefore, dismissed.

19.

No order as to costs.
