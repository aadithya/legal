Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.1

purportedly executed by late Shri Ram Singh Srivastava. The petitioner has
arrayed his four sisters Mrs. Shashi Srivastava, Ms. Kusum Srivastava, Ms.
Suman Srivastava and Mrs. Nayan Srivastava as respondent nos.2-5 in the
petition.

Public notice of the filing of the petition was directed to be

published in the Delhi and the overseas edition of `The Statesman' by the
order dated 20th December, 1999. On the same date, notice was also ordered
to be issued to the Chief Revenue Controlling Authority and the
respondents. Such publication was duly effected in the issue dated 8th April,
2000 in the local and overseas edition of `The Statesman'. No objections
were filed by the general public, however the respondent no.2 filed an
application being IA No.434/2001 under Section 282 of the Indian
Succession Act, 1985 raising objections to the grant of probate.

Replies

raising objections to the petition were also filed by the respondent nos.2, 3
& 4.
2.

The respondent no.2, Smt. Shashi Srivastava, filed objections to the

probate petition setting up a Will dated 28th October, 1987 executed by the
Late Shri Ram Singh Srivastava. A photocopy of this Will was placed on
record by her. It has been brought on record that the photocopy of this Will
was attested by the petitioner as a true copy.
Probate Case No.52/1999

3.

The respondent nos.3 & 4 also filed similar objections to the probate

petition filed by the petitioner submitting that in terms of the Will dated
28th October, 1987 left by the Late Shri Ram Singh Srivastava, the petitioner
and the respondent nos.2 to 5 were entitled to equal share in the property. It
was also asserted that on the request of the petitioner, respondent no.2 had
agreed to relinquish her share in the property in his favour if he shares the
property with the remaining sisters in terms of the desires of their late father
as expressed in the Will dated 28th October, 1987. The respondent nos.3 &
4 also placed reliance on an agreement executed by the petitioner on 12 th
January, 2000. It has been submitted that on this representation made by the
petitioner, the respondent no.2 had relinquished her share in the property in
favour of the petitioner by a deed dated 12 th January, 2000. On these pleas,
it is contended that the Will dated 28th August, 1977 was false and the
probate petition was liable to be dismissed.
4.

Respondent no.5 filed objections to the probate petition submitting

that the parents of the parties had died intestate and there was no Will dated
28th August, 1977 as had been relied upon by the petitioner. The respondent
no.5 has submitted that since no Will existed, the estate of their late father
had to be partitioned amongst all the legal heirs.

On these pleadings, vide order dated 30th September, 2003, the

following issues were framed in the matter:“1) Whether the Will dated 28th August, 1977
propounded by the petitioner is the last Will and
testament of the late Mr. Ram Singh Srivastava and it
had been executed by him in a sound disposing mind
and it is a valid Will?

Relief.”

By a subsequent order passed on 25th February, 2004, this court was

pleased to appoint Ms. Rajni Chauhan, Advocate as a local commissioner
for recording evidence in the case. It was directed that the examination-inchief of the witnesses of the parties would be recorded on affidavit while
only those witnesses would be summoned whom the opposite parties require
for cross-examination. The petitioner was cross-examined by counsel for
the respondent nos.3 & 4. The petitioner filed his own affidavit dated 7th
November, 2003 by way of evidence in the matter and proved the death
certificate of his father on 6th November, 1988 and mother on 13th
September, 1995. The petitioner proved the Will dated 28th August, 1977 as
exhibit PW1/1. In his cross-examination, the petitioner denied writing the
letter dated 12th January, 2000 and could not admit or deny on the ground
that the same was a photocopy. The petitioner also denied all knowledge of
Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.4

any Will dated 28th October, 1987 and stated that he did not recognise the
signature on the photocopy.
7.

The respondent nos.3 & 4, Ms. Kusum Srivastava and Ms. Suman

Srivastava have filed affidavits dated 28th April, 2004 and were also
subjected to cross-examination by counsel for the petitioner.

The

respondent nos.3 & 4 have also examined Shri Ravi Shankar Pani as a
witness in support of their case who has been cross examined by the
petitioner and counsel for the respondent no.5.
8.

I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have carefully

perused the record. I find that the petitioner has filed the present petition
seeking probate of a document dated 28th August, 1977 purporting to be the
last Will and Testament executed by Shri Ram Singh Srivastava. It has
been established in the evidence that late Shri Ram Singh Srivastava was
pre-deceased by his wife who expired on 13th September, 1995. Shri Ram
Singh Srivastava was the owner of the property no.R-66, Greater Kailash,
Part 1, New Delhi-48. He unfortunately expired on 6th November, 1988 at
the age of 74 years.
9.

Perusal of the record shows that the petitioner has produced the

original of the Will dated 28th August, 1977 on the record of the court as
Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.5

Exhibit PW-1. I also find that apart from a self serving statement with
regard to the execution of the Will, the petitioner has failed to examine
either Mr. D.D. Singh or Mr. N.L.Gupta who have been shown as attesting
witnesses on this purported Will of late Shri Ram Singh Srivastava.
10.

My attention has been drawn to the fact that the late Shri Ram Singh

Srivastava has expired as back as on 6th November, 1988. Late Shri Ram
Singh Srivastava was married to Smt. Dhanvati Srivastava who expired on
13th September, 1995 at the age of 79 years. The Will relied upon by the
petitioner did not see the light of the day for over ten years.

In fact, the

petitioner did not assert the existence of such a Will till he sent a legal
notice dated 15th March, 1999.
11.

By the notice dated 15th March, 1999, the present petitioner through

his counsel sought no objection from the respondent nos.2 to 5 to the
probate of the Will dated dated 28th August, 1977. No copy of the Will was
enclosed.

Thereafter, by a corrigendum dated 24th April, 1999, the

petitioner sent a copy of the Will with a format of a no objection statement
to be executed by the respondents. The respondent no.5, Ms. Nayan
Srivastava, sent a reply dated 26th April, 1999 through her counsel to the
notice dated 15th March, 1999 denying execution of the Will dated 28th
Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.6

August, 1977 by the father of the parties and had submitted that the Late
Shri Ram Singh Srivastava had died intestate and asserted that she was an
heir of her deceased father who was entitled to a share in the property.
12.

Ms. Kusum Srivastava, respondent no.3, sent a reply dated 26th April,

1999 again disputing the execution of the Will dated 28th August, 1977 and
asserted that she had an equal share as of the other legal heirs in the estate
of the deceased father of the parties. Ms. Suman Srivastava, respondent
no.4, submitted that she had not received the earlier notice dated 25 th March,
1999 and was unable to deal with the submissions made thereunder.
13.

So far as the witnesses to the Will are concerned, the Will dated 28th

August, 1977 placed on record shows that two persons, namely, Shri D.D.
Singh and Dr. N.L. Gupta appear as attesting witnesses. The petitioner has
placed a copy of the letter dated 23rd October, 1999 addressed by his counsel
to Mr. D.D. Singh requesting him to go through the draft affidavit which he
was required to sign as an attesting witness. However, no affidavit of Mr.
D.D. Singh has been placed on record.
14.

It is noteworthy that so far as the Will dated 28 th August, 1987 which

has been set up by the respondent no.2 is concerned, the photocopy of this
Will bears the signatures of one Shri Ravi Shankar Pani and Dr. N.L. Gupta.
Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.7

Based on their statement, the respondent filed an affidavit dated 28th April,
2004 of Shri Ravi Shankar Pani wherein he deposed that the Late Shri Ram
Singh Srivastava was his neighbour and good friend. He has also deposed
that the Will dated 28th August, 1987 was the last Will and Testament of the
Late Shri Ram Singh Srivastava and that he was a witness to the execution
of the said Will. This affidavit also contains a statement that the Late Shri
Ram Singh Srivastava had executed this Will in the presence of the
deponent Shri Ravi Shankar Pani as well as Dr. N.L. Gupta who had both
signed and attested the Will as witnesses in the presence of each other and
in the presence of the testator. The witness had tendered his evidence by
way of affidavit before the local commissioner on 20th September, 2006
when he was also cross-examined as permitted by the counsel for the
respondent nos.4 & 5. This witness submitted that he had not seen the
original Will and that his affidavit by way of evidence was signed at his
residence and given to the respondent nos.3 & 4.

The witness also

submitted that at the time of preparation of the affidavit, he had been shown
only a photocopy of the Will dated 28th October, 1987.
15.

The present matter has to be examined in the light of the afore-stated

facts. From the aforegoing, it is apparent that the petitioner has placed
Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.8

reliance on a Will dated 28th August, 1977 original whereof has been
produced before this court. However, the petitioner has failed to examine
either of the two witnesses on the Will in support of his petition.
16.

A Will, in order to be validly executed, is required to be attested by

two witnesses who are required to witness the execution of the Will by the
testator and are required to affix their signautres as witnesses at the same
time in the presence of each other and the testator.
17.

The manner in which such document is required by law to be attested

is to be proved is provided under Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act
which reads thus:“68. Proof of execution of document required
by law to be attested- If a document is required
by law to be attested, it shall not be used as
evidence until one attesting witness at least has
been called for the purpose of proving its
execution, if there be an attesting witness alive,
and subject to the process of the Court and
capable of giving evidence.”
18.

From a reading of the Statute, it is apparent that so far as a Will is

concerned, even though the Statute draws an exception that it would not be
necessary to call an attesting witness in proof of execution of a document
which has been registered in accordance with the provisions of Indian

Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.9

Registration Act, 1908. So far as the Will is concerned, it can be legally
proved only if at least one attesting witness is called for the purpose of
proving its execution.
19.

It is well settled that a document has to be proved by primary

evidence. A will being a document has also to be so proved except where
the court permits a document to be proved by leading secondary evidence.
In a judgment of the Supreme Court reported at JT 2006 (9) SC 415 B.
Venkatamuni v. C.J. Ayodhya Ram Singh & Ors. the court noticed earlier
judgments and reiterated the stipulation provided in Section 68 of the Indian
Evidence Act, 1872 that since a will is required to be attested, it cannot be
used as evidence until at least one of the attesting witnesses has been called
for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness, and
subject to the process of the court and capable of giving evidence. In
addition, it has to satisfy the requirements of Section 63 of the Indian
Succession Act, 1925. In order to assess as to whether the Will has been
validly executed and is a genuine document, the propounder has to show
that the Will was signed by the testator and that he had put his signatures to
the testament of his own free will; that he was at the relevant time in a
sound disposing state of mind and understood the nature and effect of the
Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.10

dispositions and that the testator had signed it in the presence of two
witnesses who attested it in his presence and in the presence of each other.
Once these elements are established, the onus which rests on the propounder
is discharged. But where there are suspicious circumstances, the onus is on
the propounder to remove the suspicion by leading appropriate evidence.
20.

So far as signatures appearing of witnesses on a Will are concerned,

in AIR 1955 SC 346 (at page 351) Girja Datt Singh v. Gangotri Datt
Singh, the court noticed that neither of the two attesting witnesses were
called as a witness to depose to the fact of the attestation. The court held
that it could not be presumed from the mere signatures of the two witnesses
appearing at the foot of the endorsement of the registration that they had
appended their signatures to the document as attesting witnesses or can be
construed to have done so in their capacity as attesting witnesses. The
provisions of Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act which required the
attesting witness to be called as a witness to prove the due execution and
attestation of the Will has to be complied with in order that such person be
treated as an attesting witness.
21.

So far as the Will dated 28th August, 1977 is concerned, the same has

been set up by the petitioner. The burden to prove not only the genuineness
Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.11

of the Will but also that the same was actually executed by the testator is
cast on the propounder of the Will. (Ref. AIR 1988 Delhi 273 Dinesh
Kumar Vs. Khazan Singh). The propounder is required to satisfy the
conscience of the court that there is no unconscionability about the
circumstances in which the Will was created or attested.
22.

Again, in AIR 1959 SC 443 H. Venkatachala Vs. B.N.

Thimmajamma, the Apex Court held that the requirements under Section
68 of the Evidence Act are required to be satisfied by the parties who placed
reliance on such document in a court of law.
23.

The law as has been laid down in Section 68 of the Evidence Act is

imperative and requires stringent compliance. In AIR 1990 Kerala 146
Puramu Singh Vs. Bharatan, it was held by the court that this statutory
provision does not permit use of a document which is required in law to be
attested as evidence till such time that the same is proved strictly in
accordance with the statutory provisions. There can be no dispute that the
Will is required to be attested by two persons.
24.

In the instant case, the petitioner has failed to produce the attesting

witness as a witness in support of his petition. Undoubtedly, the petitioner
has failed to discharge the onus and burden of proof cast on him under
Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.12

Section 68 of the Evidence Act. It is not the petitioner's case that the Will
was executed by the Testator in his presence. In any case, the petitioner is
not a witness to the execution of this Will. In the light of the principles laid
down in the authoritative judicial precedents noticed above, it has,
therefore, to be held that he has failed to prove the execution of the Will
dated 28th August, 1977 as the last Will and Testament by the Late Shri Ram
Singh Srivastava.
25.

I find that alongwith the petition the petitioner had filed an affidavit

dated 4th November, 1999 which purports to have been signed and deposed
by Dr. N.L. Gupta who has been reflected as one of the two witnesses of the
Will dated 28th August, 1997. Even the filing of this affidavit would not
satisfy the requirement in law. Inasmuch as the attesting witness is required
to be produced as a witness before the court who would be subjected to
cross examination by the respondents and objectors to the petition. In the
instant case the parties have been permitted to file the examination in chief
of their witnesses on affidavit. However, such witness was required to be
tendered for cross examination of the other side.

Undoubtedly, even

assuming that the affidavit dated 28th August, 1997 of Dr. N.L. Gupta could
be treated as his examination in chief before this court, he was in law
Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.13

required to be tendered for cross examination before such affidavit could be
read in evidence.

The petitioner has failed to so produce him and

consequently the deposition of this person, even though filed in 1999,
cannot be read in evidence in the present case.
26.

It now becomes necessary to examine the Will set up by the

respondents.

The respondents set up a Will dated 28th October, 1987.

However, they failed to produce the original thereof asserting that the same
was in the power and possession of the petitioner.

However, the

respondents failed to take any steps in accordance with law to cause the
petitioner to produce the same. The petitioner, on the other hand, has
categorically denied existence of such a Will dated 28 th October, 1987 as
well as having possession of such a Will.
27.

There is no material before this court which would enable this court

to draw a conclusion that the original of the Will actually existed or is the
possession of the petitioner. No efforts had been made on behalf of the
respondents to cause the original of this Will to be produced by the
petitioner, if it has been in his possession, nor any steps taken to prove the
same for leading any secondary evidence in respect thereof in accordance
with law. No notice to produce was served by the respondent upon the
Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.14

petitioner nor any application in this behalf filed.
28.

At the same time, the respondents have attempted to prove the

existence of such a Will by filing an affidavit of Shri Ravi Shankar Pani.
Even this witness in his affidavit made a statement to the effect that the
photocopy, which has been filed by the respondent, is really a photocopy of
the Will which was executed by the Late Shri Ram Singh Srivastava on 28 th
October, 1987 and that the photocopy produced by the respondent was the
one which was actually witnessed by this witness. In his cross-examination
he has deposed that he had only seen the photocopy of such Will at the time
of signing the affidavit. In these facts, I find that the respondents have
failed miserably to prove the existence of the original of the Will dated 28 th
October, 1987. They have also failed to prove that if the same exists, the
same cannot be produced by them.
29.

The respondents have failed to prove the photocopy of the Will dated

28th October, 1987 as a true photocopy of the original Will dated 28th
October, 1987.
30.

In any case, the respondents could have been permitted to prove the

photocopy of the document dated 28th October, 1987 only if they established
the existence of the original of the document dated 28th October, 1987 and
Probate Case No.52/1999

Page No.15

also established that despite best efforts, the original could not be produced
by them or that the same was not traceable. From the examination of the
record, I find that none of the respondents have ever seen the original of the
document dated 28th October, 1987.
31.

In this view of the matter, it has to be held that the respondents have

failed to prove the execution or the existence of the Will dated 28 th October,
1987.
In view of the aforegoing discussion, this petition and IA
No.434/2001 are held to be without merit and is hereby dismissed.
