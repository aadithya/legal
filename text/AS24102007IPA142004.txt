ARUNA SURESH, J.
Plaintiff has
Rs.35,00,000/-

filed

the

suit

for

recovery

of

(Rupees Thirty Five Lacs only) towards

damages and arrears of salary as her services have been
terminated by the defendants when she demanded her full
pay as per the Delhi School Education Act,1973 (hereinafter
referred to as the DSE Act), without assigning any reasons
vide letter dated 20th October,1993.

2.

Plaintiff

has

sought

permission

to

sue

the

defendants as forma paupris under Order 33 Rule 1, Code of
IA Nos.9157/05 & 7809/2006 in IPA No.14/2004

Page 1 of 9

Civil Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the CPC) as an
indigent person because she is not financially sound to pay
court fees required to be filed along with the suit. Hence the
present IA before me.

3.

Defendants have contested this application and

have alleged that plaintiff is financially sound and is capable
of filing the court fees required to be filed for the claim made
by her in the suit. Notice of this application was also served
upon Chief Revenue Controlling Authority, but none appeared
on behalf of the State.

An enquiry was ordered to be

conducted on this application by the Joint Registrar vide
order dated 1.10.2004. As per order dated 25.10.2004, the
Joint Registrar was pleased to opine that prima facie
petitioner was found to be an indigent person on recording of
her statement. It was only thereafter that notice was served
upon the respondents. After receipt of reply from respondents
fresh enquiry was conducted by the Joint Registrar on the
present application to find out whether petitioner is not
financially sound to pay the requisite court fee on the claims
made by her.

4.

After recording evidence of the parties by way of

affidavit and their cross-examination by respective counsel

IA Nos.9157/05 & 7809/2006 in IPA No.14/2004

Page 2 of 9

the Joint Registrar submitted his report dated 2.6.2006.
Learned Joint Registrar after appreciating the evidence of the
petitioner filed by way of two affidavits, came to the
conclusion that petitioner was not an indigent person and had
sufficient means to pay court fees. He also observed that the
law laid down in AIR 1989 Madhya Pradesh 140, AIR 1992
Kerala 359, AIR 2002 Punjab and Haryana 337 as relied upon
by the petitioner were not applicable to the facts of the case.
Objections have been filed by petitioner against the report of
the Joint Registrar by way of IA No.7809/06.

5.

I have heard both the counsel for the parties and

also perused the evidence of the parties recorded and the
documents placed on record on these applications.

In her

statement made on 25.10.2004 at the preliminary stage of the
application, the petitioner disclosed that she had no source of
income and besides her household things like bed, clothing,
kitchen appliances, fan and wearing apparels and Rs.1000 in
her saving account, she had no other means.

She further

stated that her husband has been working as tutor and
earning

Rs.2000/-

per

month.

In

her

affidavit

filed

subsequently she stated that her husband is a practising
lawyer and has a meager income of about Rs.3000/-. In the
cross examination she has stated that she does not have any

IA Nos.9157/05 & 7809/2006 in IPA No.14/2004

Page 3 of 9

television set in her house.

She is having one old

refrigerator. Her family expenses are between Rs.2500-3000
as her children are studying in government school and for
each quarter a sum of Rs.75/- is paid for each child as tution
fee. She claimed that she is un-employed.

6.

During the course of arguments when questioned

by the Court it was disclosed that she is living in an
unauthorised colony and obtained electricity connection only
very recently. Petitioner in her cross-examination disclosed
that she was living in a house owned by her mother.

7.

It is not the case of respondents that petitioner

has a house of her own. Learned counsel for the respondents
has tried to state that her husband being a lawyer has
substantial income and, therefore, the petitioner is financially
sound to pay requisite court fee.

His contentions are not

tenable. It is an established law that income of the husband
is not to be taken into consideration by the Court while
deciding whether petitioner is an indigent person or not. The
enquiry has to be confined to her in her personal capacity
alone and the ground that her husband is a lawyer having
sufficient income to pay court fees due, is of no consequence.

8.

In AIR 2002 Punjab & Haryana 337 where in a

IA Nos.9157/05 & 7809/2006 in IPA No.14/2004

Page 4 of 9

matrimonial case, Rs.75,000/- were shown to be lying in fixed
deposit in bank in the name of wife, but FDRs were found to
be in possession of her in-laws, it was held that wife is not
possessed of sufficient means to pay the court fees and she
was allowed to sue as an indigent person.

9.

Similarly in AIR 1992 Kerala 359 it was held

that means possessed by petitioner's husband are not to be
considered as means possessed by the petitioner for the
purpose of determining the question of
Order 33 Rule 1, CPC.

indigency under

No law to the contrary has been

shown by counsel for the respondent.

10.

What is required to be seen by the Court is if the

petitioner is possessed of sufficient means to pay the court
fees.

Learned counsel for the respondent pointed out that

petitioner had sought time to file the bank pass-book, but
instead has filed statement of account Ex.PW-1/1. As per this
statement of account
was

Rs.47,951.71P

the opening balance as on 1.6.2003
which

was

drastically

reduced

to

Rs.1,063.71P as on 21.6.2005 and on the same date the
account was closed. It is emphasised by learned counsel for
the respondent that petitioner has withdrawn sufficient
amount with a view to avoid payment of court fees. In the

IA Nos.9157/05 & 7809/2006 in IPA No.14/2004

Page 5 of 9

present case court fees amounts to be about Rs.30,000/-.

11.

These submissions are refuted by learned counsel

for the petitioner. The present IPA was filed on 15.7.2004.
On that date the balance amount lying in the account of the
petitioner was Rs.1,012.71P.

The last withdrawal before

15.7.2004 was on 5.1.2004 for Rs.4,300/- leaving the balance
of Rs.1,012.71P. There has been substantial withdrawal from
the

account

till

Rs.5,029.71P only.

23.12.2003

leaving

the

balance

of

Learned counsel for the petitioner has

submitted that these withdrawals were for meeting the
litigation expenses which the petitioner had to incur when
she filed a suit for permanent injunction against the
respondents.

12.

Petitioner had filed a Civil Suit on 2.5.2003

against the respondents for declaration and mandatory
injunction. The said suit was withdrawn on 9.10.2003 on the
statement of Mr.K.B.Upadhyay, counsel for the respondents
who admitted the petitioner to be the teacher of Sulabh
Public School, Mahavir Enclave, Palam

Dabri Road, New

Delhi, which is recognised upto 8th standard, as per the
information provided by defendant No.4 Ex.D-1/1 in the said
suit. On basis of this statement petitioner withdrew her suit

IA Nos.9157/05 & 7809/2006 in IPA No.14/2004

Page 6 of 9

with liberty to file fresh suit before the Education Tribunal.
As per the statement of account on the date when the suit
was withdrawn there was balance of about Rs.14,722.71P in
the account of the petitioner. This amount was increased on
16.9.2003 when a sum of Rs.6,677/-, being the dues received
from the school, were deposited in the account. Therefore, I
find much substance in the plea of the counsel for the
petitioner that petitioner had withdrawn the various amounts
to meet the litigation expenses.

13.

Even if there are some contradictions which have

crept in the cross-examination of the petitioner, they are not
fatal to the interest of the petitioner to be declared an
indigent person, in view of the documents placed on record.
The services of the petitioner were terminated immediately
after withdrawal of the suit on 20.10.2003 and thereafter
there are no deposits in the account. Under Order 33 Rule 5,
CPC, the Court can reject an application for permission to sue
as an indigent person if within two months next before the
presentation of the application, the petitioner has disposed of
any property fraudulently or in order to be able to apply for
permission to sue as an indigent person. There is a proviso to
this Rule which prohibits a Court to reject an application
even after the value of the property disposed of by the

IA Nos.9157/05 & 7809/2006 in IPA No.14/2004

Page 7 of 9

petitioner is taken into account, the petitioner would be
entitled to sue as an indigent person.

14.

In this case the amount lying in the account as on

15.5.2004 is relevant to see if the petitioner had withdrawn
amount from her account to avoid payment of court fees and
with a view that she could be declared as an indigent person.
As pointed out above the last withdrawal was on 5.1.2004 for
a sum of Rs.4,300/-. Therefore, it cannot be said that
petitioner had withdrawn substantial amount with a view to
facilitate herself to be declared as an indigent person.

15.

In view of my discussion as above I conclude that

Joint Registrar did not adopt proper approach in accordance
with law while assessing the evidence of the parties to come
to the conclusion that petitioner was financially sound to pay
the requisite court fees.

16.

Accordingly

the

applications

are

allowed.

Petitioner is permitted to sue the respondents in forma
paupris. Let the IPA be registered as a suit. Petitioner shall
be liable to pay the court fees on the amount claimed, on final
determination of suit on merits. The State shall have a charge
on the decree, if any passed in favour of the plaintiff to
recover the court fees or to recover the same from her assets
