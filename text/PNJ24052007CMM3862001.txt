PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
A short point arises for consideration in the above

captioned petition and appeal.
2.

For record, it may be noted that interim award

under Section 140 of M.V.Act,1988 has been challenged in
CM(M) No.386/01. In MAC.APP.No.210/04, the main award
has been challenged.
3.

Challenger is the National Oriental Insurance

Company Limited. The challenge is predicated on the same
ground.
4.

It is urge that

the liability fastened

upon the

appellant under the interim award as well as the final award
is contrary to law for the reason, before the accident took
place, the policy of insurance had been revoked

for the

reason, cheque tendered by the insured towards premium
was dishonoured and notice of cancellation of policy was
served upon the insured.
5.
after

Insured, respondent No.7, has taken a stand that
he

learnt

about

the

premium

cheque

being

dishonoured, he paid the premium in cash.
6.

View taken by the learned Judge MACT is that

once the policy of

CM(M) 386/01

insurance

is issued, the insurance

page 2 of 8

company has to satisfy the award

in favour of the

third

parties.
7.

The date of accident is 25.5.1999.

8.

The policy of insurance as also the cover note

have been issued on 9.2.1999.
9.

The cover note is Ex.P2W1/A.

Certificate of

insurance as also the policy is Ex.P2W1/B.
10.

Testimony of R3W1, Shri R.K.Sharma, Branch

Manager

is to the effect that inadvertently the certificate

and

policy of insurance was issued simultaneously when

cover note was issued. He stated that the cheque towards
premium in the sum of Rs.5,931/- received on 9.2.1999,
when sent

for encashment was

returned by the bank of

respondent No.3 vide return memo Ex.R3W1/A.

He further

deposed that notice dated 26.3.1999, Ex.R3W1/B, was sent
and served upon the insured informing that due to cheque
towards premium

being dishonoured, policy issued, being

policy No.6337339 stood cancelled.
11.

The insured, who appeared as RW-2/1, admitted

that the cheque towards premium was dishonoured but
denied that the insurance

company

about cheque being dishonoured.
CM(M) 386/01

ever intimated him

He stated that he had
page 3 of 8

gone to the insurance company on his own after about a
month. He learnt about the dishonour of the cheque. He
stated that he paid the premium in cash and thereafter, the
insurance policy was issued to him.
12.

It would be relevant to note that the cover note

and the certificate of policy, Ex.R2W1/A and R2W1/B, were
produced by Harbhajan Singh i.e. insured and were proved
by him.
13.

Harbhajan Singh has not produced any receipt

evidencing cash payment of the premium. His version that
the policy was issued to him after he paid the premium in
cash is belied from the fact that the policy produced by him,
Ex.R2W1/B

covers the risk period 10.2.1999 to 9.2.2000

and has been issued on 9.2.1999.
14.

Thus, there is no other policy issued a month

after 9.2.1999 as claimed by Harbhajan Singh.
15.

Further, notice of cancellation of the policy

Ex.R2W1/B dated 26.3.1999 refers to the policy which is
cancelled as policy number 6337339 i.e. Ex.R2W1/B.
16.
where

Thus, viz-a-viz the insured, it is an obvious case
the insurance company is not answerable to the

insured.
CM(M) 386/01

page 4 of 8

17.

Question, however, arises whether the insurance

company is liable to satisfy the award viz-a-viz third parties.
18.
for

I need not note various authorities on the point
the

reason,

in

a

decision

dated

23.4.2007,

in

MAC.APP.No.259/2004, Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. Vs.
Vinod Kumar & ors.

a learned Judge of this Court,

S.Khanna, J. after noting a few authorities on the point has
returned a finding as under :-

19.

“A certificate of insurance once issued
will
have
over-riding
effect,
notwithstanding any other law being in
force, and the insurance company shall
be liable to indemnify all the persons or,
class of persons specified in the policy
irrespective of the fact that the insurance
company is entitled to avoid or cancel
the policy or has already avoided and
cancelled the policy. Once certificate of
insurance has been issued, then liability
under Section 149(1) of the Act towards
third parties on behalf of the insurance
company exists notwithstanding the fact
that the insurance policy has been
cancelled or is liable to be cancelled.”
In the decision reported as 2000 (1) JCLR 953,

New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs. Rula & Ors. in para 9
of the report, Supreme Court observed as under :“9. Thus, any contract of insurance
under Chapter 11 of the Motor Vehicles
Act,1988 contemplates a third party who
is not a signatory or a party to the
contract
of
insurance
but
is,
CM(M) 386/01

page 5 of 8

20.

nevertheless, protected by such contract.
As pointed out by this court in New
Asiatic Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Pessumal
Dhannamal Aswani & Ors., AIR 1964 SC
1736, the rights of the third party to get
indemnified
can be exercised only
against the insurer of the vehicle. It is
thus clear that the third party is not
concerned and does not come into the
picture at all in the matter of payment of
premium.
Whether the premium has
been paid or not is not the concern of the
third party who is concerned with the fact
that there was a policy issued in respect
of the vehicle involved in the accident
and it is on the basis of this policy that
the claim can be maintained by the third
party against the insurer.”
The appeal and the petition are accordingly

disposed of directing the National Insurance Company Ltd.
to satisfy the interim as well as the final award in favour of
the claimants. However, recovery rights are granted to the
insurance company to recover the amount paid pursuant to
the two awards from the insured.
21.

I notice that pursuant to the interim orders

passed in the petition and the appeal, the sum covered by
the interim as well as the final award has been deposited by
the insurance company. It is not clear whether the deposit
is in this court or with the Tribunal. It is accordingly directed
that wheresoever the deposit has been made, the amount
would be disbursed in terms of the interim and the final
CM(M) 386/01

page 6 of 8

award.
22.

No costs.

23.

LCR be returned.
