These petitions have been filed by the petitioner against the

common order passed by the Additional Rent Controller, Delhi in
Eviction Case Nos.1378/2006, 1379/2006 & 1380/2006, wherein the

C.M(M) Nos.33,34,35.08

Page 1 of 6

petitioner herein is the respondent/tenant.

The eviction petitions

have been filed by the landlord on various grounds including those
under Sections 14(1) (c), (d), (e) & (h) of Delhi Rent Control Act (in
short 'Act').
2.

The petitioner moved an application under Section 11 of the

CPC in all the aforesaid eviction petitions contending that the
petitions under Sections 14(1) (c), (d), (e) & (h) of the Act were not
maintainable as it had already been determined in another suit
bearing No.974/1996 between the same parties titled “Ravi Khanna
vs. Amar Singh & Ors.”, decided by Sh. S.N. Dhingra learned ADJ,
Delhi, as his lordship then was on 21.11.1998, that the premises had
been let out for commercial purposes. It was thus contended that the
finding of the commercial purpose of letting recorded in suit
No.974/1996 was res judicata and precluded the respondent/ landlord
from contending that the purpose of letting was residential.

The

petitioner moved another application in two of these eviction cases
namely E-1379/2006 and 1380/2006 seeking condonation of delay in
filing the list of witnesses.

In eviction case No.1378/2006 an

application was moved seeking refund of the excess amount
deposited by the petitioner on account of the modification of the
order dated 12.09.1997 whereby the petitioner was directed to pay
the rent @ Rs.2178/- per month w.e.f. 09.06.2003. As aforesaid all
these applications have been dismissed by the learned ARC by the

C.M(M) Nos.33,34,35.08

Page 2 of 6

impugned common order dated 15.11.2007.
3.

So far as the ground of res judicata raised by the petitioner is

concerned, the learned Rent Controller has not accepted the
petitioners submission and, in my view, rightly so. The petitioner has
relied on the decision in suit No.974/1996 dated 21.12.1998.

A

perusal of the said judgment shows that it was rendered in a suit filed
by the petitioner claiming damages from the respondent on the
ground that the respondent/landlord has disconnected the electricity
supply to the petitioner's tenanted premises due to which he had
incurred losses.

The only two issues that were framed were as

follows: “1.

2.
4.

Whether the plaintiff is entitled to
recover the damages of Rs.1,05,000/-?
O.P.P.
Relief.”

In those proceedings it had come on record that the premises

were situated in a residential area and the electricity connection was
also a domestic one. In fact, in that case the issue that came up for
consideration before the Court was whether the respondent/ landlord
was responsible for the disconnection of the electricity to the
tenanted premises and on the said issue the Court come to a finding
that the disconnection was not on account of the respondent but on
account of the meter getting burnt due to overloading. Thus the suit
of the petitioner herein was dismissed. The petitioner places reliance

C.M(M) Nos.33,34,35.08

Page 3 of 6

on para 7 of the said decision, wherein the court had made the
following observation:

5.

“It seems that plaintiff took the premises on
rent for running Fabrication Unit and he was
knowing fully well that the premises was
situated in residential area and was having
domestic electricity connection.” (emphasis
supplied)
From this observation it cannot be said that the Court returned

a definite finding that the purpose of letting was not residential. The
use of the expression 'seems' only suggests that the Court did not
give a definite finding of fact to this effect. At best it was a prima
facie inference drawn by the Court.

In fact, the defence of the

respondent/landlord in that suit was that he was residing abroad and
taking advantage of his absence the petitioner/tenant had started to
use the premises for non-residential purposes. The Court in the said
Judgment, in any case, has not returned a finding that the purpose of
letting was non-residential. At best, it only shows that the premises
was being used for non-residential purposes.

It is well-settled that

merely because the tenant starts using the premises for nonresidential purposes, though it was initially let out for residential
purposes, does not non-suit the landlord from seeking eviction on the
ground that the premises was let out for residential purposes. In my
view the ARC rightly held that the said decision in suit No.974/1996
did not operate as res judicata since there was no issue raised or
decided with regard to the purpose of letting in the said suit.

Turning now to the consideration of the two applications filed in

eviction petition Nos.1379/2006 and 1380/2006 seeking condonation
of delay in filing the list of witnesses I find that the learned ARC has
rightly rejected the said applications. In these cases the evidence of
the respondent/landlord was closed on 20.04.2004 and the matter
was fixed for the petitioner's evidence on 20.05.2004 with a direction
to supply a copy of the petitioner's list of witnesses to the
respondent/landlord at least one week in advance.

However, no

witnesses was examined till 11.10.2004 when the petitioner's
evidence was closed.

Thereafter, an application under Section 151

CPC was moved by the petitioner and by order dated 11.10.2004 the
petitioner was given an opportunity to examine himself while making
it clear that the petitioner shall not examine any other witness except
himself, as, admittedly, no other witness was present nor summoned
for 11.10.2004.

This was so directed on 18.10.2005 by the then

presiding officer in these eviction petitions.
7.

The submission of the petitioner in the applications in question

was that the petitioner had given the names of witnesses to his
counsel, who had however, failed to file the list of witnesses though
he laboured under the impression that the same stood filed. Learned
ARC observed that the said assertions were vague as details have not
been mentioned about when the petitioner had given the names of
the witnesses to his counsel, and how the petitioner and his counsel

C.M(M) Nos.33,34,35.08

Page 5 of 6

got the impression that the list had been filed. I see no infirmity in
the reasoning adopted by the learned ARC. The order restricting the
petitioner's rights to lead evidence on account of his own defaults had
been passed way back on 18.12.2005.

Learned counsel for the

petitioner states that the petitioner had preferred an appeal before
the Tribunal against the said order, which was dismissed as nonmaintainable in November, 2005 itself. It is clear that the petitioner
slept over the matter and did not take immediate steps even
thereafter. From this conduct I am not satisfied that the petitioner
has acted bona fide in this respect and it appears that the same is a
dilatory tactics.
8.

So far as the application moved in eviction case No.1378/2006

for refund of excess amount is concerned, learned counsel for the
petitioner does not want to press the petition in respect of the said
relief.
9.

In view of my aforesaid discussions these petitions are

dismissed.
