The counter affidavit filed by respondent No.2 BSES

Rajdhani Power Limited, inter alia, states that the Hon'ble
Supreme Court is seized of the issue relating to quality of supply
of electric energy including theft and anti-theft enforcement in
a writ petition filed before their Lordships under Article 32 of
the Constitution of India.

Supreme Court from time to time in writ petition No.328/1999
titled Power Crisis in NCT of Delhi v. Union of India have also
been placed on record along with counter affidavit in an attempt
to show that the matter is already being monitored by the Apex
Court.

That position is not disputed by Mr.Awasthi, learned

counsel for the petitioner. What is argued by him is that the
petitioner has made a large number of complaints to the power
companies pointing out specific cases of theft of energy to which
the companies have not responded.

He submits that the

omission on the part of the respondents to respond to the
complaints and the information regarding theft provided by the
petitioner from time to time makes out a case for a parallel
inquiry by this Court in the present proceedings.

We do not

think so. Since the matter is being examined by their Lordships
in W.P. (C) 328/1999 and since theft of energy and anti-theft
measures which need to be taken are also issues that are being
examined by the Supreme Court, no useful purpose would be
served in starting a parallel inquiry in the present proceedings.
If the petitioner has any grievance regarding the failure of the
respondents to respond to the complaints made to them it may
intervene in the proceedings in the
appropriate

directions

W.P. (C) No.1377/2006

in

the

Supreme Court and seek

same.

With
