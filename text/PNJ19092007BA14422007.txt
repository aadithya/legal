PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

FIR No.632/2007 dated 29.6.2007
U/s. 380/34 IPC
P.S. Sangam Vihar
Complainant, Diwakar informed the police that on

24.6.2007 at about 1:00 p.m. his daughter Mukta eloped with one
Mahender. He stated that his daughter had

taken away Rs.2

lacs, around 30 tolas of gold and 1 kg silver which he had

purchased for her marriage. He stated in the complaint that he
had seen his daughter leave the house with a bag and had seen
Mahender standing in the street with empty hands. That he soon
saw Mahender walk away with the bag in his hand.
2.

On the basis of the complaint lodged by Diwakar,

afore-noted FIR was registered.
3.

Petitioners are Mukta and Mahender.

They seek

anticipatory bail.
4.

It is urged by learned counsel for the petitioners that

the version of the complainant in the FIR is ex facie false.

If

complainant saw his daughter leave the house with a bag and he
saw Mahender standing on the street empty handed and soon
thereafter saw Mahender leaving with a bag, there was no reason
for the complainant not to lave lodged a complaint there and
then. It is urged by learned counsel for the petitioners that the
FIR in question was lodged on 29.6.2007. It is further urged by
learned counsel for the petitioners that if daughter of the
complainant had eloped with so much cash and jewellery on
24.6.2007 and indeed complainant had seen his daughter leave
the house with a bag, his reaction would have been to
immediately check the valuables in the house.
5.

It is further urged by learned counsel for the petitioner

that even as per the version of the complainant the cash and
jewellery was for the marriage of petitioner No.1.
6.

In lighter vein, counsel urges that if at all petitioner

No.1 has taken along with her money and jewellery, as per the FIR
it was intended to be hers.
7.

I had spoken to the petitioners and the complainant in

the chamber to try and resolve the issue.
8.

Whereas petitioners expressed a desire and willingness

to seek blessings of the complainant, the complainant is not ready
to forgive his daughter and his son-in-law.
9.

I may note a fact, not disputed by the complainant who

is present in person, that he stands convicted for an offence under
Section 302 IPC and is currently on bail.

His bail is pending

consideration in this court.
10.

Learned counsel for the State assures the court that

the Investigating Officer would probe the issue with respect to
means of the complainant before taking any further action against
the daughter and son-in-law of the complainant.
11.

I am sure, the learned Investigating Officer would be

conscious of the nature of the allegations in the FIR and the delay
in lodging the FIR.
12.

Noting the special features of the instant case as noted

above, the petition stands disposed of directing that in the event
of being arrested by the IO, petitioners would be released on bail
on each furnishing a personal bond in sum of Rs.5000/- with one
surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the IO.
13.

Needless to state, petitioners would cooperate in the

investigation.
14.
