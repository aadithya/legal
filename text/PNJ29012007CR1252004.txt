PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
The present petition challenges 2 orders, dated

8.12.2003 and 23.2.2004 passed by Shri Prem Kumar, ADJ,
Delhi in RCA No.11/2002.
2.

The first order dismissed an application under Order

23 Rule 1 (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure filed by the
CRP No.125/04

Pg.No.1 of 8

petitioners in RCA No.11/2002 praying that since the suit filed
by them was dismissed substantially on account of legal
defects and not on the merits of the case, leave be granted to
them to withdraw the suit with liberty to file a fresh suit.
3.

Vide order dated 8.12.2003, the said application was

dismissed.
4.

A review was sought of the order dated 8.12.2003.

Order dated 23.2.2004 dismissed the review application.
5.

Petitioners were the plaintiffs. They had filed suit for

declaration, recovery of possession and perpetual injunction.
6.

I need not note the respective stand of the parties as

in my opinion no useful purpose would be served in penning
down a prolix judgment. Suffice would it be to note that on the
basis of the pleadings, the following 10 issues were framed:“1. Whether the suit is properly valued for the purpose
of court fee and jurisdiction? OPP.
2.

Whether the plaintiff is the exclusive owner of the
suit property?

3.

Whether the suit property was a joint Hindu Family
property and devolved upon his heirs after the
death of Sh.Chandu Lal Jain, if so, its effect? OPD.

4.

Whether the defendants relinquish their rights in
the suit property, if so, its effect?

5.

Whether the defendant No.1 is the licencee under
the plaintiff in respect of the portion of ground floor
in the suit property and is liable to surrender its

CRP No.125/04

Pg.No.2 of 8

possession?
6.

7.

Whether the suit is barred by time as alleged in
W.S.?

8.

Whether the suit is bad for non-joinder of the
necessary parties?

9.

7.

Whether the defendant No.1 is in occupation of the
suit property in his own right as an owner of their
of?

Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the relief as
prayed?

10. Relief.”
Issue No.1 was decided by the learned Trial Judge in

favour of the petitioners.

Issues No.2 and 4 were decided

against the petitioners. Issue No.3 was held to be irrelevant.
Issue No.5 was decided against the petitioners. Issue No.6 was
decided against the defendant, but to no effect.

Issue No.7

was decided against the plaintiffs. Issue No.8 was also decided
against the petitioners.
8.

Needless to state, issues No.9 and 10 were decided

against the petitioners.
9.

Only issue No.8 predicates itself on the technicalities

of the law.
10.

Other issues required an adjudication on merits.

Indeed they were disposed of on merits in light of the evidence
led.

CRP No.125/04

Pg.No.3 of 8

11.

Learned counsel for the petitioners urged that the

language of Order 23 Rule 1 CPC is very wide. It cannot be
given a restricted meaning that only where a suit is liable to be
dismissed on account of a technical defect, then alone power
can be exercised under Order 23 Rule 1 CPC. Counsel urged
that it gives a very wide power to the Court to permit
withdrawal of suit with liberty to file a fresh suit on the same
cause of action.
12.

Counsel urged

that

the words

'other sufficient

grounds' are wide enough to embrace other defects as well.
13.

There is no quarrel with the proposition that the

words 'other sufficient grounds' in Order 23 Rule 1 CPC
empower the Court to permit withdrawal of a suit with liberty to
file a fresh suit on the same cause of action and the power is
not restricted only to cases where the suit filed suffers from a
technical defect.
14.

Where due to want of formal proof of a document, a

suit is dismissed or where due to defective pleadings, a suit is
dismissed, the Court would be empowered to rely upon the
omnibus power under the head 'other sufficient grounds' to
grant permission to withdraw a suit with liberty reserved to file
a fresh suit. But having a power is one thing. Whether facts

CRP No.125/04

Pg.No.4 of 8

warrant power to be exercised is another thing.
15.

Whenever permission is granted to a party to

withdraw the suit and liberty is granted to file a fresh suit on
the same cause of action, such permission causes prejudice to
the defendants who have won the battle. Why should they be
made to suffer a second round of litigation?

Thus, a duty is

cast upon the Court to satisfy itself that there exist proper
grounds and reasons for granting permission for withdrawal of
the suit with leave to file fresh suit.
16.

In the report published as JT 1999 (1) SC 343

Executive Officer, Arthaneswarar Temple vs. R.Sathyamoorthy
& Ors. it was observed that withdrawal of a suit can be
permitted if there was no question of any adjudication on
merits in favour of the defendants by the Trial being nullified by
such withdrawal.

If findings on merits of the Trial Court in

favour of the defendant get nullified, said permission for
withdrawal of the suit should not be granted.
17.

It is trite that right of the plaintiff to withdraw the suit

at the appellate stage is not an absolute right for rights stand
acquired by the defendant under the decree.

Right of

withdrawal is a qualified right.
18.

I have perused the application under Order 23 Rule 1

CRP No.125/04

Pg.No.5 of 8

(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure filed by the petitioners.
19.

It is stated in the said application that plaintiffs lost

on issue No.4 inasmuch as they were not able to prove a
relinquishment deed dated 2.3.1959 which they claimed as
having been executed by the defendants. It is stated that they
lost on issue No.2 because of said finding pertaining to issue
No.4. It has been pleaded that issue No.5 was lost on account
of the fact that the Trial Judge has held that it was not pleaded
in the plaint as to when the licence in question was granted to
defendant No.1.

It is stated that issue No.8 was lost by the

plaintiffs on account of technicalities of law.
20.

But, no exception on account of any technicality or

sufficiency has been pleaded in respect of issue No.7.
21.

As noted above, issue No.7 related to the suit being

within limitation or not.
22.

The learned Trial Judge has held that the suit was

barred by limitation.
23.

If for no other reason, on said account no liberty can

be granted to the plaintiffs to withdraw the suit with liberty to
file a fresh suit for the reason it would be unfair and unjust to
require the defendants to fight out another litigation which
would obviously be barred by limitation. It would be barred by

CRP No.125/04

Pg.No.6 of 8

limitation for the reason the instant suit has already been held
to be barred by limitation.
24.

I refrain from dealing with various judgments cited by

learned counsel for the petitioners for the obvious reason none
of them applies on the facts and circumstances of the present
case.
25.

Needless to state, principles of Order 23 Rule 1 CPC

are well known and well recognized. However, the same have
to be applied in the facts and circumstances of each case. A
decision which is applying law to the facts of the case would
obviously not be a precedent.
26.

But, for record I would be failing if I do not note the

decisions which were cited by learned counsel for the
petitioners. The same are as under:1.

1973 RLR 555, Gopal Krishan vs. Smt. Bimlesh Kumari.

2.

AIR 1956 Orissa 77, Atul Krushna Roy vs. Raukishore
Mohanty & Ors.

3.

AIR 1941 Nagpur 258, Jamnadass Nagindass vs.
Beharilal Bishweshwarlal Zunzunwala.

4.

AIR 1953 Nagpur (DB) 127, Manohar Rao & Anr. vs.
Mt.Parwati w/o Narayan Singh & Ors.

5.

AIR 1982 SC 789, Baniram & Ors. vs. Gaind & Ors.

6.

AIR 1995 SC 2001, Most.Rev. P.M.A. Metropolitan &
Ors. etc. etc. vs. Moran Mar Marthoma & Anr. etc. etc.

CRP No.125/04

Pg.No.7 of 8

27.

There is no quarrel with the proposition emanating

from the said decisions that the term 'other sufficient grounds'
in Order 23 Rule 1 CPC has not to be read as ejusdem generis
to the expression 'formal defect'.
28.

I find no merits in the petition.

The same is

dismissed.
29.

No costs.
