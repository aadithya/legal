This is an application filed by the defendant seeking dismissal of

the present suit as barred by provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 CPC.
Mr.Nangia, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant
has contended that the plaintiff who is the real brother of the defendant
had earlier filed a suit being CS(OS) No. 4/2006 and had claimed partition in
respect of one of the properties left by his deceased father Shri Amir Chand
CS(OS) No. 778/2006

Khanna bearing Flat No.86, Maitri Appartment, Mayur Vihar, Phase-1, Delhi91. The said suit was filed by the plaintiff in December 2005 after about
seven years of the demise of his father that took place on 12.11.1998.
The present suit being CS(OS) No. 778/2006 has been filed by
the plaintiff against the defendant for rendition of accounts and permanent
injunction and this suit was filed on 3.5.2006 i.e after about five months of
the filing of the earlier suit. In Para 5 of the present suit, the plaintiff has
stated that his deceased father Shri Amir Chand Khanna at the time of his
death had left the following estate:
“(i) Half share in flat No.86, Maitri Apartment, Mayur Vihar,
Phase-1, Delhi-110091.
(ii) Business assets including the goodwill in the firm
M/s.Wazir Chand & Brothers or any other firm namely Khanna
Halftone Company.
(iii) Tenancy rights in respect of commercial premises at
4923, Hauz Qazi, Delhi-110006.
(iv) Ancestral property at 1915, Kali Masjid, inside Turkman
Gate, Delhi-110006.
(v) Jewellery worth Rs.20 lacs.
(vi) Life Insurance claim of Rs.10 lacs in respect of the
policies issued by LIC Unit # 115, Connaught Circus Branch,
New Delhi.”
Though in Para (a) of the plaint at Page 16 of the present suit the
plaintiff has prayed for rendition of accounts in respect of the entire estate
of his deceased father as detailed in Annexure A to the suit. However, the
said Annexure A has not been annexed with the plaint of the present suit.
Mr.Gupta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff says that the

CS(OS) No. 778/2006

Page 2 of 6

Annexure A mentioned in the prayer clause is on account of some
inadvertent error.
Be that as it may, the contention of Mr.Nangia is that the relief of
rendition of accounts was very much available to the plaintiff even on the
date the first suit being CS(OS) No. 4/2006 was filed. The contention of
Mr.Nangia is that since the plaintiff omitted to seek rendition of accounts
from the defendant in respect of the estate left by his deceased father, the
plaintiff is now precluded from filing the present suit in view of provisions
contained in Order 2 Rule 2 CPC.
The provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 CPC are extracted below:“Order 2 Rule 2
Relinquishment of part of claim-Where a plaintiff omits to
sue in respect of, or intentionally relinquishes, any portion of his
claim, he shall not afterwards sue in respect of the portion so
omitted or relinquished.”
For applicability of the aforementioned provisions contained in
Order 2 Rule 2 CPC what is to be seen by the Court is whether the relief
claimed by the plaintiff in the later suit was available to him when the
earlier suit was filed by him regarding the cause of action that accrued to
him at that point of time. The father of the parties admittedly died on
12.11.1998. The cause of action as stated by the plaintiff in the first suit
was the death of his parents and so is the cause of action stated in the
present suit. It shall be relevant to refer to the paragraphs of the plaint in

CS(OS) No. 778/2006

Page 3 of 6

both the suits which deals with the cause of action. Para 16 of the plaint of
the earlier suit which deal with cause of action reads as under :“That the cause of action has arisen to bring the present suit
against defendant No.1 when the father of the plaintiff &
defendants namely Sh. Amir Chand Khanna died intestate on
12.11.1998. It further arose when the mother of plaintiff &
defendants also passed away intestate on 08.08.1999 leaving
behind the plaintiff & defendants as the successors. It further
arose from time to time when defendant No.1 had been
claiming succession of the property on the basis of a will
which have never seen the light of the day. It further arose
from time to time when defendant No.1 had been attempting
to bargain for more share in the suit property on the basis of
will which was never shown to any of the parties to the suit. It
further arose from time to time when the half portion of the
suit premises continues to remain in exclusive possession of
the plaintiff and when defendant No.1 was trying to negotiate
in order to gain possession of the same. It lastly arose when
on 21.12.2005, it is learnt by the plaintiff that defendant No.1
was tying to sell the whole suit property and that brokers
used to come to the premises to see the premises &
negotiate with defendant No.1 in a surreptitious manner. It
further arose when defendant No.1 was not willing to give
any share to defendant No.2 in the half share which is in
occupation of defendant No.1 and he is driven by greed to
sell off the whole property as the plaintiff is settled in Canada
and visits Delhi not often. Cause of action is a continuing
once, hence this suit.”
Para 15 of the plaint of the present suit which deals with cause of
action reads as under:
“That the cause of action has arisen from time to time when
defendant has been assuring the plaintiff to render the
accounts and furnish the up to date status of all the estate of
Late Sh.Amir Chand Khanna. It further arose when defendant
tried to deal with the property 86, Maitri Apartments, Mayur
Vihar, Phase-1 Delhi exclusively and for which the plaintiff was
compelled to file suit no.CS(OS) No.4 of 2006 on 02.01.2006. It
CS(OS) No. 778/2006

Page 4 of 6

further arose when the defendant for the first time disclosed
the existence of the alleged will dated 12.01.1994, which his
ex-facie illegal, forged & inadmissible. It further arose from
time to time when defendant started to claim himself to be the
sole successor of the entire estate of the deceased on the
basis of said alleged will. The cause of action lastly arose when
inspite of notice dated 01.02.2006 which was served upon the
defendant and the defendant had failed to even respond to the
said notice and failed to render accounts or update the status
of the estate of Late Sh.Amir Chand Khanna, HENCE THIS
SUIT.”
In both the suits i.e the earlier suit as well as in the present suit,
relief of permanent injunction prayed for by the plaintiff is common. The
dispute between the parties who are real brothers is regarding their alleged
right in the properties left by their father Shri Amir Chand Khanna at the
time of his death on 12.11.1998. The plaintiff was very well aware when he
filed the earlier suit in December, 2005 that he may also be entitled to have
right in respect of other properties left by his deceased father as mentioned
in Para 5 of the plaint of the present suit. He chose not to claim any right in
respect of the said properties except the suit property which form part of
the subject matter of the earlier suit because to his own showings the
defendant had been claiming exclusive right in the said properties on the
basis of a duly registered Will dated 12.1.1994 left by his deceased father
in his favour. A perusal of the plaint of the earlier suit would show that the
plaintiff was aware of the fact that his brother being the defendant was
claiming his right in the properties left by his father on the basis of his

CS(OS) No. 778/2006

Page 5 of 6

registered Will dated 12.1.1994. It appears that the plaintiff deliberately
omitted to claim relief with regard to the said properties while he filed the
earlier suit for partition in respect of Mayur Vihar property only and for that
reason, he is now precluded from filing the present suit in view of statutory
provisions contained in Order 2 Rule 2 CPC.
In view of the above, the instant application succeeds and the
present suit of the plaintiff is dismissed as barred by provisions of Order 2
Rule 2 CPC.
Since the suit has been dismissed, the interim order passed by
this Court on 4.9.2006 is also vacated.
This suit stands disposed of accordingly.
IA No. 371/2007
In view of order of even date passed by this Court on IA No.
9236/2006, the instant application has become infructuous and is disposed
of accordingly.
