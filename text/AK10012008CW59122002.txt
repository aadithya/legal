This is a petition seeking preparation of fresh seniority list of
Lower Division Clerks on the basis of merit at the time of selection
and to regularise the services of the petitioner as an LDC with the
respondent with effect from 3rd September, 1992.
Learned counsel for the respondent contends that a tentative
seniority list was prepared in 1996 and objections were invited but
the objections could not be decided and subsequently another

tentative seniority list has been prepared in 2000 and objections have
been invited.
Learned counsel for the petitioner states that he had filed the
objections to the seniority list which are annexed as Annexure P7 at
page 93.

Perusal of these reveals that objections were filed to the

seniority list of 1996 on 27th September, 2000 and not of 2000. The
counsel for the respondent states that the objections were barred by
time and, therefore, they were not considered.
Since a new tentative list was prepared in 2000 which had been
circulated and which has not been finalized, the petitioner may file his
objections to the said seniority list within four weeks which shall be
considered and decided by the respondent expeditiously preferably
within six months.
With these directions, the writ petition is disposed of.
The pending applications are also disposed of.
