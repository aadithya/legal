till payment.

The record of the Arbitrator was requisitioned and

the same has been made available to the court. I have gone
through the arbitral award as well as the arbitration
proceedings conducted before the learned Arbitrator.
3.

The respondent had awarded a contract to the

petitioner for construction of 384 EWS houses in Block-C,
Pkt. 6 to 8, Rohini, Delhi, vide Agreement No.6/EE/RPD4/DDA/85-86.

The said contract between the parties

contained an arbitration clause being clause No.25 which
provide for adjudication of the disputes under the contract
between the parties through the process of arbitration.

In

terms of the contract the work awarded by the objector to
the claimant was to be completed by 8.07.1986, however
the work was not completed by the time specified in the
contract and the time for construction was extended from
time to time. The claimant had completed the construction
at the site on 30.08.1991.

After the work was completed

certain disputes and differences arose between the parties
regarding the alleged claims made by the claimant against

CS (OS) 2650A/1996

Page 2 of 9

the objector and those disputes were referred for arbitration
to the Superintending Engineer (Arbitration of DDA).

The

claimant/contractor had preferred four claims before the
Arbitrator.

The first claim was under under various heads

whereas claims No.2 & 3 were on account of interest and
claim No.4 was towards cost of the arbitration proceedings.
4.

After hearing the parties the learned Arbitrator has

made an award in the sum of Rs.10,63,438.65p under claim
No.1, details whereof are given at page-26 of the Award and
the same is extracted below :
“UNDER CLAIM NO.1, THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS

-----------------------Rs. 10,63,438.65

Under extra and substituted items from 1 to 22
Under item No.25, 26, 28 & 29

As far as claims No.2 & 3 no account of interest

serial Nos.1,2,3,4 & 6 at 12% per annum w.e.f. 1.3.1992 till
CS (OS) 2650A/1996

Page 3 of 9

the date of Award and at 16% per annum on the total award
amount from the date of award till the date of payment or
the decree, whichever is earlier.

Claim No.4 towards cost

was rejected.
6.

Ms. Anusuya Salwan, appearing on behalf of the

DDA has assailed the impugned Award under two separate
heads.

She has first argued in respect of objection of the

DDA against amount awarded by the Arbitrator in respect of
claim made by the contractor against item No.24 mentioned
at serial No.5 referred above.

The amount awarded in

respect of item No.24 is in respect of escalation on the cost
of the building material and the labour beyond the period of
contract till the date of actual completion of the work at site.
Ms. Salwan has contended that the Award under this head
made by the learned Arbitrator is hit by Clause 10 CC of the
agreement between the parties. She has submitted that the
contractor was paid escalation in terms of clause 10 CC, both
for the building material as well as the cost of labour for the
period beyond the date specified in the agreement for
completion of the work and till the time that construction

CS (OS) 2650A/1996

Page 4 of 9

was extended and therefore the Arbitrator could not have
awarded any further escalation on this account.
7.

The learned counsel appearing on behalf of

Objector/DDA has relied upon two Division Bench judgments
of this court in Delhi Development Authority vs. K.C.
Goyal & Co. - 2001 II AD (Delhi) 116 and Delhi
Development Authority vs. U. Kashyap – 1998 VII AD
(Delhi) 300.

On the strength of these two judgments she

had contended that the Award in respect of item No.24 to
the tune of Rs.7,96,214.09p cannot be sustained as the said
Award is contrary to the terms of the contract between the
parties contained in clause 10 CC of the agreement. She
has submitted that a similar award made by the Arbitrator
was set aside by two separate Division Bench of this court in
the aforementioned cases.

A similar Award on account of

escalation contrary to clause 10 CC was set aside by this
court in yet another judgment in Jagat Ram Trehan &
Sons Vs. Delhi Development Authority 2002 (63) DRJ
119.
8.

Mr. Malhotra, learned senior counsel appearing on

CS (OS) 2650A/1996

Page 5 of 9

behalf of the claimant/contractor has not disputed that the
payment on account of escalation in terms of clause 10 CC
of

the

Agreement

has

already

been

made

by

the

DDA/objector to the contractor while settling his final bill.
However his contention is that the amount on account of
escalation awarded by the learned Arbitrator in respect of
item No.24 was over and above the amount paid to the
contractor under clause 10 CC of the Agreement. This
contention made on behalf of the claimant/contractor is of
no consequence because once a particular formula is
provided in the contract, applying some other formula and
awarding the claim on account of escalation would amount
to legal misconduct. Following the ratio of judgments in the
aforementioned cases, I have no hesitation in holding that
the amount awarded by the learned Arbitrator in respect of
item No.24 on account of escalation of cost of material and
labour cannot be legally justified and is therefore to be set
aside. The objection of DDA/objector is with regard to the
award in respect of item No.24 is, therefore, allowed.
9.

Regarding the amount awarded by the learned

CS (OS) 2650A/1996

Page 6 of 9

Arbitrator in respect of other items mentioned at serial
No.1,2,3,4 & 6 at page-26 of the Award, Ms. Salwan
appearing on behalf of DDA has argued that the learned
Arbitrator has misconducted himself in awarding the said
amounts because he has not given adequate reasons for
awarding the said amounts. Ms. Salwan made an attempt to
point out that the other amounts awarded under various
heads as mentioned at serial No.1,2,3,4 & 6 at page-26 of
the Award were not really due and payable to the contractor
and, therefore, according to her the award even in that
respect is also not sustainable. This argument advanced by
Ms. Salwan is of no consequence because this court while
deciding objections does not sit in appeal over the judgment
of the Arbitrator. The DDA/objector has appointed their own
Superintending Engineer as the Sole Arbitrator for deciding
the disputes and differences between the parties. The
Superintending
Arbitrator

and

DDA

the

to

of

the

entitlement of the contractor under various heads. Even if

CS (OS) 2650A/1996

Page 7 of 9

we go into merits of each claim and at the end reach to a
conclusion different to what has been arrived at by the
learned Arbitrator, this court cannot substitute its opinion in
place of the Arbitrator while deciding the objections against
the arbitral award. Hence this court is of the opinion that
there is no merit in the objections in so far as they relate to
the Award in respect of other items. The Award of the
learned Arbitrator in respect of items mentioned at serial
No.1,2,3,4 & 6 at page-26 of the Award is upheld. This court
does not find anything unreasonable in the interest on the
Award amount awarded by the learned Arbitrator in respect
of claims No.2 & 3. The Award in that regard is also upheld.
10.

For the foregoing reasons the objections against

the arbitral Award filed by the DDA are partly allowed to the
extent that the award in respect of item No.24 to the tune of
Rs.7.96,214.00 is set aside. Since the objections have been
filed under the old Act, the rest of the award is made Rule of
the Court. The DDA/objector is given two months time for
making

payment

of

the

decreetal

amount

to

the

claimant/contractor failing which, it shall be liable to pay

CS (OS) 2650A/1996

Page 8 of 9

interest at 16% p.a on the decreetal amount from the date of
decree till the date of actual payment.

Decree sheet be

drawn accordingly. The parties are left to bear their own
costs.
