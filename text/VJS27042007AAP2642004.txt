JUDGMENT
VIKRAMAJIT SEN, J.
1.

The Applicant has initiated the present action under

Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ('A & C
Act' for short) praying for the appointment of an arbitrator on
behalf of the Larsen and Toubro Limited (for short L&T), the
Respondent herein, in accordance with Clause 25 of the Contract
dated 3.3.1988 as modified by Supplementary Agreements dated
31.1.1990 and 6.2.1995. L&T had entered into a contract with
the Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (for short SCOPE)
on 29.2.1988 for the construction of SCOPE Twin Tower, Plot
No.2, Laxmi Nagar, Delhi-110 092. L&T thereafter entered into a
sub-contract with the Applicant firm Mohan Lal Harbans Lal
Bhayana (for short MHB). In brief, MHB had agreed to complete
Items 3 to 8 of the Abstract of Costs at a final price of
Rs.12,08,40,464.40/- based on the agreed Bill of quantities,
specifications, drawings etc.

Actual payment being based on

the unit rates and the quantity of work executed. Clause 9 of this
Agreement stipulated that all disputes connected therewith shall

Page 2 of 18

be deemed to have arisen only in the Courts in

Delhi which

would have jurisdiction to determine them. The parties hereto
had agreed to settle the disputes by arbitration as recorded in
Clause 25 of the Agreement dated 3.3.1988, which reads as
follows:
CLAUSE – 25 : SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BY
ARBITRATION :
Except where otherwise provided in the contract,
all questions, disputes, certificates excluding “excepted
matters” relating to this contract shall be referred to a
Sole Arbitrator in case claims are upto and including
Rs.10 lakhs to be appointed by the General Manager
(Civil), L&T and for claiming over Rs.10 lakhs by a panel
of 3 Arbitrators of whom one will be appointed by
General Manager (Civil), L&T, the other by MHB and an

The “excepted matters” relate to matters

concerning designs, specifications, instructions, orders
and quality of work of materials, work as executed or
materials supplied and defects, lapses defaults by MHB
thereof and for which the Architects decision is final and
these matters cannot be arbitrated upon. It will be no
objection to any such appointment that arbitrator(s) so
appointed is/are L&T's employees(s), that they had to
deal with the matters to which the contract relates and
that in the course of his duties as L&T's employees, he
had expressed view on all or any of the matters in
dispute or difference.

entitled to proceed with the reference from the stage at
which it was left by his/their predecessor(s). It is also a
term of this contract that no person other than a person
appointed by General Manager(Civil), L&T as aforesaid
should act as arbitrator and, if for any reason that is not
possible, the matter is not to be referred to arbitration at
all.

proceeding under this clause. It is a term of the contract
that the party invoking arbitration shall specify the
dispute or disputes to be referred to arbitration under
this clause together with the amount or amounts claimed
in respect of each such dispute.
It is also a term of the contract that if MHB do
not make any demand for arbitration in respect of any
claim(s) in writing within 30 days of receiving the
intimation from L & that the bill is ready for payment, the
claim(s) of MHB will be deemed to have been waived
and absolutely barred and L & T shall be discharged and
released of all liabilities under the contract in respect of
those claims.

AA 264.2004

Not withstanding anything contained in

Page 4 of 18

this agreement, the parties shall not be entitled to
invoke reference of dispute to the arbitration after
acceptance of the final payment until it is so recorded
on the bill that the same was being received under
protest.

No Award of the Arbitration/Umpire shall be

binding on L&T unless

MHB had furnished

complete

opportunity to L&T to file a similar claim on SCOPE and
only upon L&T receiving any payment from SCOPE
under any Award which L&T may get in its favour on the
subject matter of this work.
(a) The arbitrator (s) may from time to time with the
consent of the parties enlarge the time for making and
publishing the award.

2.

Thereafter, a Supplementary Agreement was executed

between the parties on 31.1.1990 – its Recitals refer to the
Agreement dated 3.3.1988; records that the completion of the
work has been delayed for various reasons beyond the control
of MHB; notes that the reasons stated by MHB were the abnormal
increase in cost of material and labour due to

various

hindrances caused by SCOPE resulting in delay in project
execution; mentions that SCOPE and L&T had amended their
main contract to give effect to the settlement reached in a joint
meeting, inter alia agreeing to the extension of time, escalation
in prices dues to hindrances, and all

AA 264.2004

other

claims

whether

Page 5 of 18

made or not.

The First Supplementary Agreement dated

31.1.1990 between the parties contains the following Clause:(viii) The agreement provides that all disputes between
the parties shall be settled through arbitration. It is now
expressly agreed that any dispute or difference which
MHB might have with the L & T under the agreement
or the SCOPE might

have with the L & T

under the

main contract between them relating to the part of work
that is to be executed by MHB, shall be deemed disputes
jointly between MHB & L & T and SCOPE under the
main contract and L & T will refer all such disputes to
SCOPE for settlement by negotiation.

If SCOPE does

not settle the same by negotiation, then L & T will refer
the said disputes for arbitration with SCOPE alongwith
any other disputes which L & T might have with the
SCOPE in terms of the arbitration clause provided in the
said main contract. MHB shall in such an event, help
prepare claims and statement of case relating to their
scope of work and render all assistance and cooperation
as may be required in successfully pursuing the
arbitration. MHB shall bear proportionately cost of
arbitration relating to their scope of work. The award of
the arbitrator on all such matters in dispute claims and
counterclaims relating the MHB's scope of work shall
be binding on both MHB and L & T and all such disputes
between MHB and L & T shall be deemed to have been
settled accordingly and shall not be referable to
arbitration again

between MHB and L & T under the

agreement.

specifically relates to claim or claims of each of the
parties as referred in the arbitration claim statements,
then each party shall share the claims as per the award.
If any claim or claims awarded relates partly to L&T and
partly to MHB, then the said awarded claim will be
shared after realisation in the proportion of the amounts
referred to in Annexure `A', which gives the split up
amount of each claim as between L&T and MHB.
...
6. That L&T and MHB shall not undertake any other
arbitration as between them in respect of the claims
referred to pending arbitration, except to share the
proceeds or liabilities as stated above by way of accord
and satisfaction.

Thereafter, the Third Supplementary Agreement dated

6.2.1995 was entered into between the parties, which inter alia
contains the following Clauses:
5. Any claim arising after the date covered by the said
Award, shall be as far as possible settled mutually by
negotiation. It is mutually agreed by the parties that any
such disputes, shall be identified but shall not be
referred to arbitration on the Owner until the completion
of the project. This would facilitate concentration of the
concerted efforts of the parties for timely completion of
the project.

The reference of disputes if any to

arbitration after completion of the project shall be in
accordance with the terms of
agreement dated 31.1.1990.

Any further arbitration if

referred to the owner after completion of the work, the
Award arising out of this arbitration shall be shared in
proportion of the claims preferred relating to the work of
each of the parties herein.
....
16.

The parties further agree, amend and modify

Clause 25 of the General Condition of Contract dated
3.3.1988 which deals with settlement of Disputes by
Arbitration to the limited extent that in the event of any
fresh reference of dispute/s to arbitration, the Arbitrator
or Arbitrators, as the case may be shall be bound to give
speaking Award. This clause 25 is subject to the terms of
the first supplementary agreement dated 31.1.1990
which modified the agreement dated 3.3.1988.

AA 264.2004

5.

After exchange of copious correspondence MHB caused

legal Notice dated 31.7.2004 to be served on L&T. It was, inter
alia, acknowledged therein that in the Third Supplementary
Agreement dated 6.2.1995, by virtue of Clause 5, the parties had
agreed that all claims arising thereafter would not be raised until
the completion of the project; that the project stood completed in
July, 2002 when it was inaugurated by SCOPE. However, as on
11.4.2004,

claims

amounting

to

Rs.26,63,00,616.53/-

were

outstanding in favour of MHB, in respect of which despite
several reminders no payments had been made.

The legal

Notice also states that MHB had given ample opportunity to
L&T to file claims on SCOPE, which it has failed to do,
leaving

no alternative

but

to

invoke

Clause 25

in

the

Contract dated 13.3.1988. MHB had also notified L&T that it
had appointed Mr. A.P. Pracer,
Arbitrator

and

retired ADG, CPWD, as

its

called upon L&T to nominate its arbitrator in

terms of the said Clause within fifteen days. In the Reply
dated 13.9.2004 by Shri S. Guru Krishna Kumar, Advocate for
L&T, the factum of the project having been completed in July,
2002 has been admitted. The stand on behalf of the L&T is
that MHB is precluded from raising any disputes since the role of
L&T was only to receive claims from MHB but that they were not
AA 264.2004

Page 9 of 18

obliged to forward all such claims and demands to SCOPE.

It

has been denied on behalf of the L&T that there were any
admitted or disputed claims. It has been asserted that L&T was
not bound to refer all

disputes

to

arbitration and that as

between the parties hereto no arbitration agreement exists. It
was also admitted on behalf of the L&T that some, but not all
the claims, had in fact been referred by L&T to the arbitration
pending

between SCOPE

and

L&T.

Quite inexplicably, it is

also submitted that the Agreement dated 3.3.1988 does not
contain an

Arbitration Clause. The request of MHB to refer

disputes to arbitration was turned down.

6.

L&T has raised these very Objections in the pending

proceedings asserting that the agreement to refer disputes to
arbitration

stood

expressly

rescinded

by

the

subsequent

agreements and that contemporaneous correspondence fortifies
the clear intention of the parties not to enter into any arbitration
as between themselves.

It has been asserted in

these

proceedings that arbitration was initiated against SCOPE by L&T,
in which some of the claims of MHB had been included, and the
second Supplementary Agreement made provisions for sharing
the proceeds thereof. Paradoxically, learned counsel for L&T has
AA 264.2004

Page 10 of 18

contended that if any ambiguity in the sundry terms of the
contract between the parties is perceived, the earlier clause
would prevail over the later in terms of settled law.

This

argument has been raised with regard to the interplay between
Clauses 5 and 16 of the third Supplementary Agreement dated
6.2.1995. Both these Clauses have already been reproduced
above. So far as Clause 5 is concerned it merely records that
efforts shall be made to mutually settle the disputes between the
parties and specifically that reference of disputes to arbitration,
after completion

of the project, shall be in terms of the first

Supplementary Agreement dated 31.1.1990. It also records the
manner in which the proceeds of the Award shall be divided
between the parties. This Clause does not annihilate Clause 25,
which has been specifically referred to in the succeeding Clause
16. On a holistic reading of various Agreements between the
parties, I cannot accept the argument of learned counsel for the
Respondent that Clause 25 of the Agreement dated 3.3.1988 had
been rescinded. Instead, the parties had resolved firstly to settle
their disputes by negotiations between themselves and secondly
not to commence arbitration inter se till the completion of the
project. This must mean that they could be free to initiate steps
towards resolution of their claims thereafter.
AA 264.2004

Forbes -vs- GIT, AIR 1921 PC 209 relied upon by learned

counsel for L&T militates against it since it lays down that if in a
Deed a later clause destroys altogether the obligations created by
an earlier one, the later clause is to be rejected. This decision
was followed by their Lordships in Radha Sundar Dutta -vs-

Mohd. Jahadur Rahim, 1958 SCR 1309. It should be noted that
Clause 25 is contained in

The
the

subsequent Agreement viz. third Supplementary Agreement
dated 6.2.1995. Even if this Agreement is to be looked at, Clause
5 does not annihilate Clause 25 of the earlier Agreement and this
is amply clear from a reading of the subsequent clause therein,
namely, Clause 16.

8.

Law guarantees a redressal system for all disputes. The

normal forum is that of civil courts. With the evolution of
arbitration, an option is available to parties to have their
disputes resolved outside the

civil court system. A resolve to

arbitrate upon disputes is usually found in commercial contracts,
which are not merely intricate and complicated, but most often
require

that

the

adjudicator

should

possess

specialised

knowledge. The parties hereto had agreed to take recourse to
AA 264.2004

Page 12 of 18

arbitration in view of clear terms of Clause 25 of the Agreement
dated 3.3.1988 which has not been cancelled by any of the three
Supplementary Agreements.

L&T need not have agreed to on

arbitration clause, but once having agreed thereto, in the absence
of an unequivocal and clear renunciation of the said Clause, it is
bound by the compact.

In the course of arguments Mr. Guru

Krishna Kumar, learned counsel for the L&T, had indicated that it
was not in the interest of L&T to forward all the claims of MHB
since considerable business was expected to be done by L&T with
the Government. These are wholly irrelevant considerations.
Viewed from another angle, had

MHB filed a civil suit for

recovery of money against L&T (MHB has no privity of contract
with SCOPE), it is almost certain that L&T would have resisted
the suit by adverting to Clause 25. This may be speculative but it
is based on jural experience. All Objections which have been
raised before the Court could easily have been raised before the
Arbitrator. By not accepting MHB's request for appointment of
an arbitrator, made in 2004, disputes have been

festering for

three years.

9.

In the memorandum submitted on behalf of L&T it has been

stated that - “The claims which have been left out/reduced “and
AA 264.2004

Page 13 of 18

which would be referred to SCOPE” are found at Sl. Nos. 8 to 11
along with the brief reasons for non referral of the same.

The

claims preferred by MHB which have already been referred in
entirety to SCOPE are set out in Sl. Nos. 1 to 7”. It has further
been submitted on behalf of L&T that - “Pertinently, the
completion certificate has yet to be issued.

complex, all of

which are referable to MHB's scope of works. Importantly, this
has been repeatedly raised by SCOPE, which has reiterated that
the finalisation of the claims made by L&T (both of itself and of
MHB) would be taken only thereafter.

Therefore, the claims

are still under process/consideration and have not been rejected
finally in the negotiation which is going on under the terms of
contract between L&T and SCOPE.

the Project has been completed in 2002,

there is now no impediment whatsoever in adjudication of all
the claims of MHB. There is no merit in the submission that the
appointment of arbitrators should be further delayed. The other
objection on behalf of L&T that SCOPE should have been
AA 264.2004

Page 14 of 18

impleded as a party is wholly without merit. There is no privity
of contract between MHB and SCOPE and in view of the decision
of the Supreme Court in Sukanya Holdings (P) Limited v. Jayesh

H. Pandya,

(2003)

5 SCC 531 joinder of a 3rd party into the

arbitration would be inappropriate.

10.

The question that now remains is whether L&T should still

be called upon to appoint its own arbitrator.

-vs-

In

B.W.L.

Ltd.

MTNL, 2000 IV AD (D) 165, after noting that the

Respondents had failed to appoint an arbitrator even though one
year had elapsed

since the demand in this regard had been

lodged. In the present case almost three years have been lost so
far as the claimant is

concerned. I had observed that it has

become commonplace for persons possessing the power of
appointment of an arbitrator not to act at all or to behave with
such obduracy as to render the arbitration clause meaningless.
Accordingly, the power to appoint an arbitrator had been held to
have been forfeited, with the result that the

Arbitrator was

appointed by the Court. The same approach commends itself in
the present case also. If defaulting or

recalcitrant parties are

permitted to exercise their contractual rights vexatious litigation
is encouraged.
AA 264.2004

B.W.L. Ltd. was noted by their Lordships in
Page 15 of 18

Datar Switchgears Ltd. -vs- Tata Finance Ltd., (2000) 8 SCC 151,
where it has been held that the right to appoint an arbitrator
stands extinguished after the opposite party moves the Court
under Section 11 of the A&C Act.

Thus, the right of L&T under

Clause 25 stands forfeited. This view has also been followed by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court as is evident on a reading of Punj

Lloyd Limited -vs- Petronet MHB Limited, (2006) 2 SCC 638, and
on the perusal of this passage from Shin Satellite Public Co.

Limited -vs- Jain Studios Limited, (2006) 2 SCC 628 :
30. Finally, it was submitted by the respondent that if
this Court is not upholding the objection of the
respondent and is inclined to grant the prayer of the
petitioner, some time may be granted

to the

respondent to make an appointment of an arbitrator.
It was not done earlier because according to the
respondent, clause 23 was not enforceable. The
learned counsel for the petitioner objects to such a
prayer. According to him, a letter/notice was issued
and

in

spite of request by the petitioner, the

respondent had failed to exercise his right to appoint
an arbitrator. At this belated stage, now, the
respondent cannot be permitted to take advantage of
its

own

default.

In my

opinion, since there is

failure on the part of the respondent in making
appointment of an arbitrator in accordance with the
agreement, the prayer cannot be granted.
