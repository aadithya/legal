SANJIV KHANNA, J:
1.

The appellants, namely Mr. K.P. Jain and Mrs. Sushila Jain have
th

impugned judgment dated 5 December, 2005 and

Order dated 8

th

February, 2006 to the extent that they have been denied interest on

LPA Nos. 703-04/2006

Rs.18,35,646/-,

Page No. 2

which was deposited with the respondent-Delhi

Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as DDA, for short).
2.

The facts are virtually undisputed. The appellants purchased

property no. D-5, Maharani bagh, New Delhi from the erstwhile owners.
The aforesaid property was a leasehold property on which DDA as
superior lessor was entitled to claim 50% unearned increase in the value
of the land in case of transfer. The appellants on 30

th

June, 1989

deposited Rs.18,35,646/- towards unearned increase with DDA. However,
the said application remained pending

and neither mutation nor any

document was executed in favour of the appellants.
3.

DDA also came up with a Scheme for conversion of leasehold
th

properties into freehold. On 10 June, 1999, the appellants moved an
th

application before DDA stating that their earlier request dated 30 June,
1989 for mutation and execution of documents of transfer in their favour
should be treated as withdrawn and Rs.18,35,646/- be refunded. On 24

th

August, 1999, the appellants filed an application for conversion of the
leasehold property into freehold and regularising the transfer claiming
themselves to be the first transferees and accordingly paid the first

LPA Nos. 703-04/2006

Page No. 3

installment. In other words the Scheme itself had provision for payment of
transfer charges or unearned increase at reduced rates and conversion
charges for conversion of leasehold rights into freehold.

The entire

aforesaid charges in terms of the Scheme formulated by DDA were paid
th

on 16 February, 2001.
4.

In spite of repeated requests by the appellant, DDA did not

refund Rs.18,35,646/- and raised a dispute i.e. whether the said amount
could be refunded. Appellants filed writ petition in this Court being W.P.(C)
Nos. 911-12/2005 for refund of the aforesaid amount. Learned Single
th

Judge in his detailed judgment dated 5 December, 2005 allowed the writ
petitions and directed refund of Rs.18,35,646/-, inter alia, holding that in
all cases where request for transfers were pending and no document in
favour of the transferee had been executed, payments were required to be
made under the conversion scheme and no further amount towards
unearned increase was payable. DDA was, therefore, required to refund
the unearned increase of Rs.18,35,646/- paid earlier in 1989. Learned
Single Judge

relied upon circulars and clarification issued by the

Government of India and it was held that only amount stipulated under the

LPA Nos. 703-04/2006

Page No. 4

Scheme was required to be paid by the appellants and unearned increase
of Rs.18,35,646/- was required to be refunded. Accordingly, the Writ
Petition was allowed. DDA has accepted the said judgment and has not
filed any appeal against the said decision.
5.

The appellants claim that Rs. 18,35,646/- had remained with
th

DDA from 30 June, 1989 till payment was made in terms of Order dated
th

5 December, 2005 and on this amount DDA should pay interest @ 18%
per annum. It was submitted that the appellants had paid conversion
charges and transfer charges as per the conversion scheme and DDA
was not justified in retaining and delaying payment of Rs.18,35,646/-.
6.

We do not think that the appellants are entitled to interest on
th

Rs.18,35,646/- till conversion charges were paid on 16 February, 2001.
th

The appellants on their own had on 30 June, 1989 paid the unearned
increase which was payable under the terms of the lease. Though DDA
did not execute any document in favour of the appellants and carry out
mutation, the delay and default on the part of DDA went to the advantage
and benefit of the appellants as after the conversion Scheme was
introduced, the transfer charges or unearned increase got reduced. In
terms of the said Scheme, the appellants had the advantage of paying

LPA Nos. 703-04/2006

Page No. 5

substantially lower amount, which advantage the appellants have availed
of. The question of refund of unearned increase arose only after the full
payment of the conversion charges including transfer charges were paid
th

on 16 February, 2001 and not before the said date. The appellants could
not have asked for refund of the unearned increase of Rs.18,35,646/- paid
by them before the conversion charges were paid, as admittedly there
was transfer of the leasehold rights and in terms of the lease deed, which
continued and the transfer was regularised on payment as per the
Scheme.

Under the terms of the lease, 50% of the unearned increase

was payable. The terms of the original lease were modified and altered
th

as per the Scheme when full payment was made on 16 February, 2001.
th

It may also be mentioned here that in the letter dated 10 June, 1999, by
which the appellants had withdrawn their application for transfer of the
leasehold rights, no claim for interest was made and on the said date no
application for conversion under the Scheme had also been filed.
7.

We are also of the opinion that after entire payment of
th

conversion charges was made on 16 February, 2001, DDA should be
given the benefit of six months' time for verification and scrutiny of the

LPA Nos. 703-04/2006

Page No. 6

documents and processing the case for refund and conversion of the
st

property from leasehold to freehold. Thus, period upto 31 August, 2001
stands explained and benefit can be given to DDA.
8.

st

However, there is no justification and reason after 31 August,

2001 for DDA not to refund the unearned increase of Rs.18,35,646/-, once
th

the conversion amount/charges in full had been paid on 16 February,
2001. Conversion Scheme was applicable to the appellants and payment
of transfer charges was required to be made by the appellants in terms of
the Scheme. DDA received application and first installment under the
th

th

Scheme on 24 August, 1999 and the last payment on 16 February,
2001. No objection or rejection of the application was communicated by
the DDA to the appellant. The judgment of the learned Single Judge in
this regard is elucide and categorical. Transfer charges payable under the
Scheme were accepted and DDA has also accepted the judgment of the
learned Single Judge and thus has admitted it's liability to refund
Rs.18,35,646/-. The result was that DDA was withholding payment of
Rs.18,35,646/-, which was paid towards unearned increase after 16

th

February, 2001 and at the same time had also received full payment

LPA Nos. 703-04/2006

Page No. 7

towards conversion charges including transfer charges on unearned
increase paid at reduced rates as per the Scheme.
st

Therefore, we feel

that for the period after 1 September, 2001 (i.e. six months after 16

th

February, 2001), the appellants should be paid interest on Rs.18,35,646/till the respondent-DDA made payment/refunded the said amount. It is
well settled that when a party has wrongly retained money payable to
another person and the said party is wrongly deprived from use and
benefit of money because of failure of the debtor to pay, interest can be
awarded to the wronged party. We may also note that inflation every year
reduces the purchasing power of money, which gets diminished. Interest
is paid to compensate the person to whom payment is to be made as a
result of fall in value or purchasing power of money.
9.

In Ghaziabad Development Authority versus Union of India,

reported in (2000) 6 SCC 113, the Supreme Court awarded interest @
12% per annum to meet ends of justice as the authority was found to be at
fault. This was in spite of the fact that as per the brochure, the said
authority was not liable to pay any interest on refund of money. In South
Eastern Coalfields Limited versus State of M.P., reported in (2003) 8
SCC 648,

it was observed that the applicability of the rule to award

LPA Nos. 703-04/2006

Page No. 8

interest in equity is attracted on the existence of a state of circumstances
being established, which justify exercise of such equitable jurisdiction and
such circumstances can be many.

Moreover in the present case, the
th

th

appellants had also written letters dated 20 February, 2004 and 16 July,
2004 for refund and payment of interest. The said letters constitute notice
under Section 3 of the Interest Act, 1978. Interest is also payable in terms
of Interest Act, 1978.
10.

Keeping in view the rate of inflation during the period 2001-2005,

we feel that it will be appropriate if DDA pays interest @ 7% per annum
st

w.e.f. 1 September, 2001 till the date DDA refunded Rs.18,35,646/- to
the appellants. The aforesaid payment will be made within a period of six
weeks from today.
11.

The Appeal is accordingly disposed of. In the facts and

circumstances of the case there will be no order as to costs.
