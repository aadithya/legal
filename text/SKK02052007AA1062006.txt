SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J. (ORAL)
1. The petitioner has filed the present petition under Section 11 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as

Arb.Pet.No.106/06

Page 1 of page 6

the said Act) seeking reference of the disputes to arbitration.
2. The father of the petitioner and respondent no.1 were brothers.
The dispute pertains to a partnership firm M/s Haryana Rang
Udyog,

respondent

no.2.

The

partnership

was

originally

constituted in 1966 with the petitioner as a partner to the extent of
90% share which got diluted over a period of time. The petitioner
finally retired from the partnership firm on 12.5.1980. The firm was
reconstituted on 10.3.1987 with respondent no.1 and the mother of
the petitioner, late Smt.Padma Vati Nayar, as partners, with
respondent no.1 having no rights in the assets of the firm. This
was followed by an MoU being executed on 28.6.1997 having four
parties.

These parties were the petitioner, late Smt.Padma Vati

Nayar, respondent no.1 and Mr.Sandeep Nayar, son of respondent
no.1. The MoU, inter alia, provided for division of assets including
immovable property in a particular manner between the parties. It
is not necessary to go into the details of the mode and manner of
division.

Suffice to say that this MoU contained an arbitration

clause in the following terms:
14.“The Understanding arrived at between the parties
has been reduced in writing above. However, if
there is any misunderstanding or dispute between
the parties with respect to this Memorandum of
Understanding, the parties will try to resolve their
dispute in the following manner:
Arb.Pet.No.106/06

Page 2 of page 6

(a) Firstly, one member each of both the families shall
sit together and discuss the matter between
themselves to arrive at an amicable peaceful
settlement. It is further made clear that no member of
the family shall create a communication gap between
the two families, since both the families agree that by
due communication between the parties, the dispute
shall always be settled peacefully and amicably.
(b) However, if the first step discussed in para (a)
above does not bring fruitful results, then both the
parties shall appoint a common known person as an
Arbitrator, then the efforts shall be made to resolve
the misunderstanding or differences by holding
personal discussions between one member each from
both the families in the presence of the Arbitrator.”
3. There was another MoU also executed on 8.4.1989, prior to the
aforesaid MoU between the petitioner, late Smt.Padma Vati Nayar
and the sisters of the petitioner for devolution of rights in favour of
the petitioner to the exclusion of his sisters. Late Smt.Padma Vati
Nayar also stated to have executed a Will dated 26.5.1987 making
bequeath in favour of the petitioner. Late Smt.Padma Vati Nayar
passed away on 23.1.2005.
4. Disputes and differences are stated to have arisen between the
parties to the MoU resulting in filing of the present petition. This
petition is resisted by the respondents. This resistance arises out
of an alleged fresh MoU stated to have been executed on 3.9.1998
between respondent no.1 and late Smt.Padma Vati Nayar in terms

Arb.Pet.No.106/06

Page 3 of page 6

whereof the rights in respect of the assets of the firm instead of
devolving on the petitioner were to devolve on the sisters of the
petitioner.

Late Smt.Padma Vati Nayar is also alleged to have

executed another Will dated 12.8.1999 making bequeaths in favour
of a daughter. This fresh MoU also contains an arbitration clause.
5. In the nutshell, the dispute is while under the earlier Will of late
Smt.Padma Vati Nayar as also the MoU dated 28.6.1997 the
interest in the partnership firm of late Smt.Padma Vati Nayar was
to devolve on the petitioner, by the subsequent arrangement of the
fresh MoU alleged to have been executed on 3.9.1998 and the
subsequent Will dated 12.8.1999, the same was to devolve on the
sisters of the petitioner.
6. Learned counsel for respondent no.1 further submits that the
sisters of the petitioner have also filed probate proceedings for
grant of probate of the Will dated 12.8.1999. The petitioner has
now received the notice in the said probate petition. The principal
contention of the learned counsel for the respondent is that in
terms of the subsequent MoU dated 3.9.1998, though the same
also contains an arbitration clause, the rights devolve on the sisters
of the petitioner who are not parties to the MoU and thus, the
reference to arbitration would not be appropriate remedy for

Arb.Pet.No.106/06

Page 4 of page 6

adjudication of the disputes. This plea is sought to be supported
by the factum of the probate petition having been filed and it is
canvassed that the petitioner ought to have filed civil proceedings
for adjudication of the disputes in which his sister would have to be
made party.
7. On consideration of the matter, I am unable to accept the plea of
the learned counsel for the respondent. There is no dispute that
the MoU dated 28.6.1997 was executed. Whether it created any
rights in favour of the petitioner which were not capable of being
extinguished, is a matter for the arbitrator to consider since
indisputably the subsequent MoU dated 3.9.1998 does seek to
extinguish the rights, if any. The petitioner and respondent no.1
are parties to the MoU dated 28.6.1998 which contains arbitration
clause No.14. The subequent MoU dated 3.9.1998 also contains an
arbitration clause. The subsequent MoU dated 3.9.1998 does not
make the sisters of the petitioner parties. One cannot obviate the
possibility of further litigation which may arise by the sisters of the
petitioner agitating their rights, but that is not something which
can be taken into consideration to frustrate the arbitration clause
agreed to between the parties.

The rights and liabilities of the

petitioner and respondent no.1 have to be governed by the MoU

Arb.Pet.No.106/06

Page 5 of page 6

dated 28.6.1997 and the consequences of the subsequent MoU
dated 3.9.1998 would be the aspect to be determined by the
arbitrator.
8. In view of the aforesaid, I deem it appropriate that a reference of
the disputes between the parties be made arising out of the MoU
dated 28.6.1997 making it clear that the effect of the alleged MoU
dated 3.9.1998 can also be examined by the arbitrator.
9. Ms.Justice (Retd.) Usha Mehra is appointed as the sole arbitrator to
enter upon reference and adjudicate the disputes between the
parties. The sitting fee will be fixed by the arbitrator herself. The
total fee for the arbitration shall, however, bear a ceiling of Rs.2.00
lacs (Rupees Two Lacs only) apart from out of pocket expenses, to
be shared equally between the petitioner and respondent no.1.
10.The petition is allowed in the aforesaid terms, leaving the parties
to bear their own costs.
