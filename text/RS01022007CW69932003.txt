REKHA SHARMA, J.
A.B.Khilani joined the service of M/s.M.G.Shahani & Co.
on 1.2.60 as Assistant Manager and continued till 18.12.89 when he
was dismissed from service after he was found guilty on charges of
embezzlement. Feeling aggrieved by the order of his dismissal he

W.P.(C) 6993/2003

raised an industrial dispute which was referred to an Industrial
Tribunal for adjudication. The terms of reference were as under : “ Whether the dismissal of services of Shri A.B.Khilani is
illegal and / or unjustified and if so, what relief is he entitled
and what directions are necessary in this respect.

The Industrial Tribunal vide its order dated 29.11.2002 found
the order of dismissal to be unjustified. Basing itself on Rule 16 of the
Rules and Regulations governing the conditions of service between
the employees and the employer, the Tribunal held that the workman
whose

date

of

birth

was

24.11.35

had

attained

the

age

of

superannuation on the date it came to pass the order holding his
dismissal to be unjustified. Therefore, instead of ordering his
reinstatement the management was directed to give all consequential
benefits to him, i.e., the wages from the date of his dismissal till the
date he attained the superannuation alongwith all the retiral benefits.
Armed with the order of the Industrial Tribunal, A.B.Khilani
moved

an

application

before

the

Assistant/Deputy

Labour

Commissioner under Section 33(c)(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 seeking implementation of the award passed in his favour. The
Management contested the application and filed its reply.

It was

willing to pay wages and benefits calculated from the date of
termination till the age of superannuation which according to it was
55 years. This was not acceptable to the workman who wanted his

W.P.(C) 6993/2003
of 5

page 2

wages to be calculated till he attained the age of 60 years.

The

Deputy Labour Commissioner agreed with the workman and sent a
communication

dated

19.9.2003

to

District

Collection

Officer

(Collector) to recover a sum of Rs.3,08,076/- from the Management as
arrears of land revenue.

Consequent thereto, the Management

received a communication from

Assistant Collector and Tehsildar

dated 14.10.2003 calling upon it to pay the aforesaid amount within
15 days from the date of service of the notice. The Management is
aggrieved by both these orders. Hence, this writ petition.
It was submitted by the Management that in terms of Rule 16 of
the

Conditions

of

Service

the

workman

attained

the

age

of

superannuation at the age of 55 years and therefore the order of the
Deputy Labour Commissioner directing it to pay the wages calculated
upto the age of 60 years was unjustified and consequently the order of
the Assistant Collector and Tehsildar dated 14.10.2003 was also not
sustainable.
It is not disputed that the petitioner has been paid wages and
other benefits calculated upto the age of 55 years. Therefore, the only
question which arises for consideration is whether the Deputy Labour
Commissioner and then the Assistant Collector and Tehsildar were
justified in directing the Management to pay a sum of Rs.3,08,076/which

amount

W.P.(C) 6993/2003
of 5

has

been

calculated

by

taking

his

age

of

page 3

superannuation as 60 years. It is relevant in this context to have a
look at Rule 16 of the Conditions of Service between the employer and
the employees. This is how it reads:Superannuation age of the workman is fixed at 55 years extendable
upto 60 years, subject to the satisfaction of the employer that he will
be able to perform his duty after attaining the superannuation age.

It is apparent from a bare look of the above rule that the age of
superannuation of a workman is 55 years. It is ofcourse extendable by
five years but only upon the satisfaction of the employer that the
workman will be able to perform his duties “after attaining the
superannuation age”. The use of the expression “after attaining the
superannuation age” goes to show that so far as the age of
superannuation is concerned it is 55 years but if a workman is
continued in service even after his superannuation till 60 years it has
to be on the satisfaction

of the employer that he will be able to

perform his duties inspite of his having attained the age of
superannuation. The Tribunal in its order dated 29.11.2002 has
directed the Management to pay to the workman wages

from the

date of dismissal till the date of superannuation. The said order of the
Tribunal cannot be given any other meaning except this that workman
was to be paid wages till he attained the age of 55 years. It will be
relevant to mention here that the reference which was made to the
Tribunal was “whether the dismissal of the workman was illegal /

W.P.(C) 6993/2003

page 4

unjustified.”

The question whether he could continue in service

beyond the age of 55 years was not an issue before the Tribunal. It
could at best be the subject matter of another industrial dispute but so
far as the present order of the Tribunal is concerned it cannot be
faulted.
It has been held by the Division Bench of this court in
M/s Colcom Plastic Ltd. and others Vs. Union Of India & others,
1997(1) LLJ 1230 that the proceedings under Section 33 (c) (1) are
in the nature of execution proceedings and the executive therefore
cannot go beyond the Award for which execution is sought before it.
In view of this judgment and for what has been held above, by me, the
order of the Deputy Labour Commissioner dated 19.9.2003 granting
arrears of salary and other benefits till the age of 60 years was
outside the scope of its power under Section 33(c)(1) of the Industrial
Disputes Act. Accordingly, the orders dated 19.9.2003 and 14.10.2003
are quashed. The writ-petition is allowed.
