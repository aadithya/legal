Notices were issued to the OL and the Regional

The OL and regional director have considered the

report of the Chairperson of the meeting of secured creditors of the
both companies and of unsecured creditors of petitioner company no
2, as well as the accounts of Petitioner Companies as on 31st March
2006. The only objection raised by the O.L. as well as the Regional
Director to this petition under Section 391 to 394 of the Companies
Act, 1956, seeking the sanction of the scheme of arrangement being
de-merger of undertaking of petitioner No.1 Company namely M/s.
Piccadilly Holiday Resorts Ltd. and its transfer to petitioner No.2
namely M/s. Piccadilly Hotels Pvt. Ltd is that the petitioner Company
failed to submit valuation report/share entitlement ratio.
17.

The learned counsel for the Petitioner has drawn my

attention to section 2(19AA) of the Income Tax Act. He submits that
the expression de-merger is defined in the said provision and the

Co. Pet. No. 172 of 2007

Page 6 of 10

relevant extract thereof reads as follows:
“(19AA) "demerger", in relation to companies,
means the transfer, pursuant to a scheme of
arrangement under sections 391 to 394 of the
Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), by a
demerged company of its one or more
undertakings to any resulting company in
such a manner that(i) all the property of the undertaking, being
transferred by the demerged company,
immediately before the demerger, becomes
the property of the resulting company by
virtue of the demerger;
(ii) all the liabilities relatable to the
undertaking, being transferred by the
demerged company, immediately before the
demerger, become the liabilities of the
resulting company by virtue of the demerger;
(iii) the property and the liabilities of the
undertaking or undertakings being transferred
by the demerged company are transferred at
values appearing in its books of account
immediately before the demerger;
(iv) the resulting company issues, in
consideration of the demerger, its shares to
the shareholders of the demerged company
on a proportionate basis;
(v) the shareholders holding not less than
three-fourths in value of the shares in the
demerged company (other than shares
already held therein immediately before the
demerger, or by a nominee for, the resulting
company
or,
its
subsidiary)
become
shareholders of the resulting company or
companies by virtue of the demerger,
otherwise than as a result of the acquisition of
the property or assets of the demerged
Co. Pet. No. 172 of 2007

Page 7 of 10

company or any undertaking thereof by the
resulting company;
(vi) the transfer of the undertaking is on a
going concern basis;
(vii) the demerger is in accordance with the
conditions, if any, notified under sub-section
(5) of section 72A by the Central Government
in this behalf.
18.

Learned counsel submits that under the scheme the

properties and liabilities of the undertaking being transferred by the
petitioner No.1 company are proposed to be transferred at values
appearing in its books of account immediately before the de-merger.
This is also so stated in his objection by the Regional director and the

O.L. Learned counsel submits that there is no necessity of having a
valuation report and in respect of that contention he relies on the
decision of the Bombay High Court in Advance Plastics P.Ltd., In
re. (Bom), 2007 (138) Company Cases 1006 (Bom). In this case,
the Bombay High Court has taken the following view:
“The Regional Director has filed an affidavit
and in paragraph 6 thereof raised an
objection stating that as per Clause 12.1 of
the scheme shares will be issued by the
transferee company to the members of the
transferor company. But no valuation report is
submitted by the petitioner – company in
respect of exchange ratio of 1 : 1 arrived at
for such issue of shares by the transferee
company to the members of the transferor
company. Mr. Shah, learned counsel for the
petitioner, submitted that except one
shareholder, who held hardly 50 shares of the
transferor company, all the shareholders in
Co. Pet. No. 172 of 2007

Page 8 of 10

both these companies are the same. He
further submitted that there were no secured
and unsecured creditors and all the
shareholders has given their consent for the
scheme. Save and except the objection raised
in paragraph 6, the Regional Director has
stated that the scheme as proposed is not
contrary to the public interest or prejudicial to
the interest of the shareholders or creditors.
The shares are the properties of the
shareholders and they are the ultimate and
the best judge of the value they would put on
their charges. There is no requirement in the
Companies Act that in such a case the ratio of
exchange has to be determined on a
valuation made by a chartered accountant
and auditor. In the present case, no
shareholder
has
challenged
the
amalgamation.
In
the
circumstances,
valuation report was not necessary.”
19.

Learned counsel has further submitted that the

reference made to the decision of the Supreme Court in Mihir H.
Mafatlal vs. Mafatlal Industries Ltd., AIR 1997 SC 506 is also
misplaced since the said decision, which broadly lays down the
contours of the inquiry undertaken by the court, do not require the
valuation report to be prepared by an independent agency to arrive
at the exchange ratio of the shares in a scheme of arrangement.
20.

I agree with these submissions of the petitioner and

find myself in agreement with the view of the Bombay High Court.
Since,

in this case the scheme has been approved by the

shareholders of the two companies which are both closely held, and
even the secured and unsecured creditors have approved the scheme
in question, I see no force in the objection of the Regional Director
