Appellant had booked a consignment weighing 156

kg for carriage from Delhi to Rosa vide PWB No.725423 dated
30.4.1987. The consignment reached Rosa on 9.5.1987 and at
time of delivery it was noted that one wooden case was
broken.

Goods were stolen.

The net weight of the

consignment delivered was 108 kg. A damage and deficiency

certificate was issued by the railway staff as mentioned in the
open delivery report.
2.

While delivering the consignment the appellant

described the goods as hardware.
3.

Valuing the goods which were lost at Rs.75,239/-

and claiming 10% sale tax stated to have been paid thereon
and Rs.100/- as packaging and forwarding charges appellant
laid a claim in sum of Rs.82,862.80 before the Railway Claims
Tribunal.
4.

In para 4 of the claim petition it was pleaded as

under:“4.
The goods did not reach the destination station
in time and later on it was observed that the goods
reached the destination station in broken condition and
open delivery of the said goods were taken by the plaintiff
on 20.9.87 and at that time it was found that there is a
loss of Rs.82862.80 on account of shortage. The open
delivery certificate was issued to this effect.

The Railway Claims Tribunal held that due to their

act of negligence the railway authorities were responsible for
the shortage of the goods weighing 48 kg. However, claim was
denied on account of the fact the Tribunal treated as if the
goods lost were vernier calipers. With reference to Section 77B of the Railways Act 1890 the Tribunal held that a vernier
caliper was a scientific instrument and hence to succeed, while
FAO No.263/95

Page 3 of 9

delivering the parcel the appellant had to declare the value of
the contents and

on the value so declared pay additional

money for the increased risk, which was not done.
6.

According to the appellant the consignment being

hardware no such declaration was required to be made or
additional premium was required to be paid.
7.

The Tribunal has dealt with the issue in paragraph

11 to 17 of its decision. The same reads as under:“11.
The respondent has raised a very interesting
point that this consignment consisted of “excepted
articles” and that the consignor had not disclosed the
consignment as consisting of excepted articles and
declared its value and further no percentage charges
also had been paid for this consignment and that,
therefore, the railway administration is not liable for
payment of any compensation. The basic point raised is
that “vernier calipers” had been loaded in this
consignment, that these are “scientific instruments”
coming under the purview of the Second Schedule of the
Indian Railways Act, 1890 and as such attracted the
provisions of Section 77-B of the Indian Railway Act,
1890, thereby making railways exempt from liability for
the loss of any of the articles in the parcel.
12.

FAO No.263/95

Section 77-B of I.R.A., 1890 reads as follows:“77B.
(1) Notwithstanding
anything
contained in the provisions of this Chapter,
when any articles mentioned in the Second
schedule are contained in any parcel or
package delivered to a railway administration
to be carried by railway and the value of such
articles in the parcel or package exceeds five
hundred rupees, the railway administration
shall not be responsible for the loss,
destruction, damage or deterioration of the
parcel or package unless the person sending
or delivering the parcel or package to the
Page 4 of 9

administration caused its value and its
contents to be declared in writing or declared
them in writing at the time of delivery of the
parcel or the package for carriage by railway,
and if so required by the administration, paid
or engaged to pay in writing a percentage on
the
value
so
declared
by
way
of
compensation for the increased risk.”
(Note: Scientific Instruments is included in the
Second Schedule of Indian Railways Act, 1890
as Item “Y” and mentioned as one of the
“articles to be declared and insured”)
13.
The sum and substance of the respondent's
contention is, therefore, that the parcel which was
offered to railway administration for carriage by the
railway contained “excepted articles” and the cost of
the “excepted articles” in this packet was Rs.15,100/(cost of ten vernier calipers had been claimed at
Rs.15,100/- by the applicant at the rate of Rs.1510/- per
vernier caliper), and that therefore, applicant's claim for
compensation cannot be sustained and that railway
administration cannot be held liable for payment of any
compensation. This raises a very interesting point as to
whether “vernier caliper” is a “scientific instrument”?
14.
Applicant's counsel referred to a book “Basic
Fitter Guide” by Hazra & Chakravarty 1990 Edition,
which deals with “vernier calipers” to contend that this
is only a mechanical instrument. A passage from this
book reads as under:“When a liner dimension has to be measured to
within +001” or +02mm an engineer's steel rule
cannot be used with much confidence. However,
a precision measuring instrument called a vernier
caliper can be used ........
The vernier caliper is primarily intended for
measuring inside and outside diameters of shafts,
thickness of parts and also to check the depth of a
hole etc. to an accuracy of +.02mm or +.001” by
means of a vernier scale attached to the caliper.”

FAO No.263/95

Page 5 of 9

15.
It would be seen from the above that vernier
caliper
is
a
precision
instrument
used
for
gauging/measuring linear dimensions in a most accurate
and precise manner and it is not a normal measuring
instrument where precision and accuracy is not called
for.
This caliper is used generally in Physics
Laboratories while conducting scientific experiments.
Prima facie, vernier caliper, therefore, comes under the
category of “scientific instrument”.
16.
The Tribunal also looked in this contention at
meaning of “instrument and scientific” in popular
Dictionaries.
The following observations, in this
connection, are also relevant.
1.

The Concise Oxford Dictionary
Instrument means
(a) A tool or implement esp.
for delicate or scientific work.

(b)

A measuring device.
Chambers Dictionary:instrument
is
“A
tool
or
indicating/measuring/controlling
apparatus).”

2.

utensil
.....

for
(An

(a) The word 'science' has been defined in Prem's
Judicial Dictionary as under:“Science has been defined and interpreted by
Judicial precedents to include “all human knowledge
which has been generalised and systematised and
has obtained methods/relations and the form of law.
The term is applied whenever particular skill and
judgment is to be applied to a particular subject as
required to explain results or trace them to the
causes”

(b)

Concise Oxford Dictionary defines Science as
“systematic and formal knowledge of a special type
or a specific subject i.e. which required skillful
technique rather than strength or natural ability”.
The word “scientific” refers to “investigation
according to rules laid down in exact science for
performing observations and testing the soundness

FAO No.263/95

Page 6 of 9

of conclusions
accurate”.
(c)

have

to

be

systematic,

Chamber's
Dictionary
defines
“science”
as
knowledge
ascertained
by
observation
and
experiment, critically tested, systematised and
brought under general principles.

17.
A perusal of these dictionary meanings shows
that where specially skilled effort is required for
ascertaining a particular fact or making a particular
observation in a matter, it becomes scientific. The tool
for such delicate scientific work is instrument as defined
in Concise Oxford Dictionary. Taking an overall objective
view of these definitions and the use for which the
vernier caliper is provided or intended, the Tribunal has
absolutely no hesitation in holding that 'vernier caliper'
definitely comes under the category of 'scientific
instrument' and as such is an excepted article as covered
by the provisions of second schedule of Indian Railways
Act, 1890.”
8.

Learned counsel for the appellant, Mr.M.L.Bhargava,

urged that a vernier caliper is an instrument of measurement
and not a scientific instrument and hence urged that the
appellant was not required to declare the value, much less pay
additional charges for the increased risk.

Alternatively,

counsel urged that not all goods which were lost were vernier
caliper.

As pleaded in para 4 of the claim petition, vernier

calipers were only 10 in number.

Remaining goods were as

detailed serial No.1 to 3 and 5 to 18 of para 4 of the claim
petition.
9.

On the first plea urged, I am in agreement with the

view taken by the Tribunal for the reason every scientific
FAO No.263/95

Page 7 of 9

instrument would be an instrument but not vice versa.

The

distinction between an instrument and a scientific instrument
would be as discussed by the Tribunal in para 15 and 16 of its
decision.
10.

However, the claim petition could not have been

rejected in its entirety by treating the entire consignment lost
to be vernier calipers.

It appears that the Tribunal failed to

note that vernier calipers which were lost were only 1 out of 18
goods which were lost.
11.

The position therefore would be that claim of the

appellant for recompense in respect of vernier calipers valued
at Rs.15,100/- has to fail inasmuch as admittedly these would
be scientific instruments and under Section 77-B of the Indian
Railways Act 1890, being scientific instruments, value thereof
had to be disclosed at the time of delivery with additional risk
premium to be paid.
12.

Since the Tribunal has not dealt with the nature of

the other goods, namely, whether they would be instruments
or scientific instruments, matter has to be remitted to the
Tribunal for further consideration with reference to specific
pleadings in para 4 of the claim petition.
13.

The appeal accordingly stands disposed of quashing

the impugned order dated 17.1.1995 in OA-1-193/1990 insofar
FAO No.263/95

Page 8 of 9

the entire claim petition has been dismissed.

The order is

upheld insofar it relates to rejection of the claim for vernier
calipers valued at Rs.15,100/- as also the sale tax relatable
thereto. For the remaining items the claim petition is restored
for fresh adjudication before the Tribunal.
14.

Needless to state, the Tribunal would decide the

issue of recompense by taking note of the description of the
items which were lost as detailed in para 4 of the claim
petition.
15.

No costs.

16.

TCR be returned forthwith.
