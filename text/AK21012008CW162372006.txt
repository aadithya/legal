Rule.
With the consent of the parties the matter is taken up for final
adjudication.
The petitioner has challenged the award dated 8th November,
2005 dismissing his claim after closing his evidence and consequently
closing the evidence of the management and thus dismissing the
claim of the workman that termination of his services by the

WP(C) No.16237/2006

Page 1 of 5

management was illegal and unjustifiable.
The petitioner/workman filed statement of claim contending
inter-alia that he was a workman with the management for the last
six years as a driver and his last drawn wages were Rs.3000/- per
month. The petitioner contended that he was never provided facilities
such as appointment letter, minimum wages, leave book, attendance
card, casual leave etc and on demand management got annoyed and
terminated his services on 30th May, 2002.
After the reply to the claim of the petitioner was filed by the
management, the issues were framed on 12th July, 2004.
The Labor Court closed the evidence of the petitioner on 8th
November, 2005 on the ground that since January, 2005 the
workman was given more than sufficient opportunity to lead his
evidence but he failed to do so. After closing the evidence of the
petitioner, the evidence of the management was also closed and the
claim of the petitioner was dismissed.
The petitioner has contended that he was present on 10th
January, 2005, however, the matter was adjourned to 13 th April,
2005. On 13th April, 2005 the presiding officer was on leave. Since the
Presiding Officer was on leave on 13th April, 2005, the case was
adjourned for 6th July, 2005. On that date the affidavit of evidence of

Page 2 of 5

the workman was filed and a copy was also given to the authorized
representative of management and the matter was fixed for the cross
examination of the workman on 22nd September, 2005. On 22nd
September, 2005 the authorized representative of the workman was
present and the matter was adjourned for 25th October, 2005 as the
workman was not present on that day. Even on 25th October, 2005
the workman was not present.
The petitioner workman has contended that on account of
unemployment he could not come from his village and also because
he was suffering from fever. He pleaded that he tried to intimate the
authorized representative also who was present on 22nd September,
2005 and 25th October, 2005, however, he could not get in touch with
his authorized representative. Thereafter, on 8th November, 2005 the
evidence of the workman was closed.
The notice of the present petition was issued to the respondent,
however, no counter affidavit has been filed, despite opportunity given
to the respondent/management.
The averments made by the petitioner in his petition that on
22nd September, 2005 and 25th October, 2005 he had fever and was in
his native village and on account of unemployment he could not come
and could not even intimate his authorized representative, though he
tried to do that, has not been refuted by the respondent/

management.

Considering the facts and circumstances it is apparent that
there is sufficient cause for the absence of workman on 22nd
September, 2005 and 25th October, 2005 when the matter was listed
for his cross examination, as the workman could not appear on those
days on account of his illness which fact has not been refuted by the
respondent.
The observation of the Labor Court that the opportunities have
been given to the petitioner workman since January, 2005 and
nothing was done, is not correct in the facts and circumstances which
is a manifest error in the award, as on 6th July, 2005 evidence on
affidavit was filed on behalf of petitioner/workman.
Considering the facts and circumstances there is sufficient
cause

to

set

aside

the

order

closing

the

evidence

of

the

petitioner/workman. The error in the award dated 8th November, 2005
is also apparent as the observation that nothing was done by the
petitioner/workman since January, 2005 is not correct as the
evidence on affidavit was filed by the petitioner/workman on 6 th July,
2005

and

a

copy

of

the

same

was

also

given

to

the

respondent/management.

Consequently, in the facts and circumstances and in the
interest of justice the award dated 8th November, 2005 is set aside and
the matter is remanded to the Labor Court to record the evidence of
the workman. The

workman is granted one opportunity to appear

before the Labor Court for recording his evidence. If the evidence of
the petitioner/workman is not completed on one day, the petitioner be
given other opportunity to complete the same. After the evidence of
the petitioner,

the management shall be entitled to lead evidence.

With these directions the writ petition is disposed of and the parties
are directed to appear before the Labor Court-II, Karkardooma Courts,
Delhi on 11th February, 2008. The Labor Court on 11th February, 2008
shall fix the date for recording the evidence of the workman. The
Labor Court shall dispose of the petition expeditiously. Considering
the facts and circumstances, the parties are left to bear their own
costs.
