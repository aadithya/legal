1.

Petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 25.9.2006

allowing respondent's application in Order 9 Rule 13 CPC and as a
consequence setting aside the ex-parte decree dated 18.3.2005.
2.

Respondent contested the suit diligently till 31.5.2004.

On said date counsel did not appear and defendant was
proceeded ex-parte.
3.

Suit continued and was finally decreed ex-parte on
page 1 of 4

18.5.2005. Application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC was filed on
24.1.2006.
4.

Explaining non-appearance and reason for delay it was

stated in the application that the counsel concerned Mr.
H.N.Bahuguna assured the defendant that he would call the
defendant as and when needed.
village Ghazipur.

That the defendant lives in

She is not a resident of Delhi.

She felt re-

assured that her counsel would prosecute her defence diligently.
That her son had been interacting with the counsel.

That on

5.12.2006 her son Harish contacted Mr.H.N.Bahuguna who
informed that the matter was listed for 6.1.2006.

That on said

date she and her son came to the Court but were shocked to find
that the case was not listed.

On inquiry from the Reader they

learnt about the suit being decreed ex-parte. Thereafter another
counsel was engaged and the application for setting aside the exparte decree/order was filed.
5.

Opposing the application petitioner stated that the

defendant was negligent.

That blame was unnecessarily being

put on the shoulders of the lawyer.
6.

Learned Trial Judge has believed the respondent.

7.

It is not uncommon for lawyers to let down their

clients. I need not note a large number of authorities noting that
clients should not suffer due to defaults of their counsel.
8.

What is relevant in the instant case to be noted is that

the defendant lives in a village. She is not a resident of Delhi.
Obviously, she had to rely upon her counsel.
9.

Since I am dealing with a petition under Article 227 of

the Constitution of India it would not be out of place for me to
mention that learned Trial Judge has passed an order under Order
9 Rule 13 CPC which gives sufficient discretion to the learned Trial
Judge while considering the sufficiency of the cause shown.
10.

The order impugned has allowed the defendant to

exercise her right to led defence evidence for the reason
defendant was proceeded against ex-parte when stage of defence
evidence reached.
11.

Every attempt should be made to construe procedural

laws to further the cause of substantive justice and unless
compelling circumstances exist where procedure outways the
substance only then the procedural law should be given primacy
over substantive law.
12.

The impugned order has achieved the aforesaid object

of the law.

13.

I thus dismiss the petition but with a direction that

henceforth the defendant or her son would diligently appear on
each date along with the counsel so that in future a situation of
default does not occur. I am passing this direction for the reason
the plaintiff relies upon written acknowledgment of the defendant
acknowledging the liability and an argument was advanced by
learned counsel for the petitioner that the defendant is shying
away from leading defence evidence and that she knows that a
decree has to follow. Non-appearance and suffering an ex-parte
decree was a mere ploy to delay the proceedings.
14.

No costs.
