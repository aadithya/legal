PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Petitioner,

Smt.Bimla

Devi,

was

the

plaintiff.

Alleging illegal dispossession from the suit property she filed a
suit under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act praying for a
decree for possession in her favour.
2.

She claimed possession to the suit property alleging

that during his life time, late Shri K.L.Narang had allowed her
to reside

with him in the suit property as she was his
Page 1 of 5

employee.

That Shri K.L.Narang died on 9.2.2001. That he

had bequeathed the suit property to her by and under a will
dated 2.9.2000. That late Shri K.L.Narang was a widower and
his children had abondoned him.

That she used to work in the

establishment of late Shri K.L.Narang at Karol Bagh for the last
20 years and additionally used to take care of Shri K.L.Narang.
She stated that with the help of police, children and relatives of
Shri K.L.Narang i.e. the defendants in the suit dispossessed her
from the suit property on 14.6.2001.
3.

Vide the impugned judgment and decree dated

7.9.2005, the suit has been dismissed holding that the issue of
title predicated under the will could not form subject matter of
an adjudication in a possessory suit filed under Section 6 of the
Specific Relief Act. In respect of claim of the petitioner that
she was in physical possession of the house, on analysing the
evidence, learned Judge has opined that the petitioner had
failed to establish that she was in physical possession of the
house.
4.

Defence by the children and relatives of late Shri

K.L.Narang was that the petitioner was employed as a maid
servant in the house of late Shri K.L.Narang. That the will in
question was a forged document.
5.

I do not intend to re-appreciate the evidence, not for
Page 2 of 5

the reason that in a civil revision petition I cannot do so but
for the simple reason, if concept of possession is correctly
appreciated, there would be no requirement to appreciate the
evidence.
6.

Undisputedly, petitioner herself claimed that she

was an employee

and that her employer

was late Shri

K.L.Narang.
7.

I may note the decision of learned Single Judge of

this court reported as Shyam Lal Vs. Rajinder Kumar 1994
(Vol.30) DRJ 597 wherein it was observed; in para 13 as under
:“13. Possession is flexible term and is not
necessarily restricted to mere actual possession of
the property. The legal conception of possession
may be in various forms. The two elements of
possession are the corpus and the animus. A
person though in physical possession may not be
in possession in the eye of law, if the animus is
lacking. On the contrary, to be in possession, it is
not necessary that one must by in actual physical
contact. To gain the complete idea of possession,
one must consider
(i)

the person possession

(ii)

the things possessed and,

(iii)

the persons excluded from possession.

A man may hold an object without claiming any
interest therein for himself. A servant though
holding an object, holds it for his master. He has,
therefore, merely custody of the thing and not the
possession which would always be with the master
Page 3 of 5

8.

though the master may not be in actual contact of
the thing. It is in this light in which the concept of
possession has to be understood in the context of
a servant and a master.”
On the basis of the material on record, to state that

the petitioner was in possession of the suit property would be a
misnomer.
9.

Possession of a servant is possession of the owner.

As held in Shyam Lal's case (supra) a servant cannot be said
to be having any interest in the suit property.

It cannot be

said that a servant can exercise such a possession or right to
possess over the property as to exclude the master and the
real owner which would include the successors-in-interest of
the master.
10.

I accordingly dismiss the civil revision petition.

11.

It would be open to the petitioner to prove the will

on which she relies and on succeeding, obtain appropriate
relief.
12.

But, before concluding I must express my anguish at

the conduct of respondents who had abandoned their father
during his life time. All alone by himself, the poor man must
have lived a fairly miserable life.

If case pleaded by the

servant is correct that the petitioner, as a maid servant, has
fabricated the will of their father, it would mean that the maid
servant was confident that she could wrest the property from
Page 4 of 5

the heirs of the deceased qua whom she may have evidence to
show that the deceased had extreme dislike for them.
13.

Children must realise that ethos of our culture is to

respect our elders; to the extent of sacrificing our present as
also our future for the comfort of our elders.
14.

No costs.

15.

LCR, if received, be returned.
