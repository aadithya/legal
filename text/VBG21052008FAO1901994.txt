V.B.Gupta, J.
The present appeal under section 173 of the Motor
Vehicles Act,1988 (for short as the “Act”) has been filed
against the award dated 28.04.94, passed by Sh. S.L.
Khanna, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (for short as
“Tribunal”), Delhi.
2.

The accident which gave rise to the present appeal

took place on 4th October, 1980 at about 3 a.m., when the
deceased, Sh. Vidya Ram was sleeping near the main
Mathura Road at Badarpur in front of his office where he
used to keep stocks of stone dust, badarpur and rohri. A
truck bearing no. USD 7636 being driven by Respondent

FAO No.190/1994

Page 2 of 10

no. 1, Sh. KaliCharan came from Mathura road and was
going inside the Badarpur and rohri (stone dust) stock via a
bye lane. KaliCharan was driving the truck in a rash and
negligent manner and lost control of the vehicle as he
neared the place where the deceased was sleeping. The
truck suddenly and abruptly swerved towards extreme
right and over ran the cot on which one Badri Prasad was
sleeping after it crushed the deceased, Sh. Vidya Ram
under its front wheels who was sleeping on the heep of
stone dust near by. Deceased Vidya Ram breathed his last
at the spot.
3.

Vide impugned judgment, the Tribunal awarded the

compensation of Rs.1,54,000/- along with the interest @
6% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till
realization.
4.

It has been contended by Ld. Counsel for the

Appellants that the Tribunal has erred in applying the
multiplier of 20 only. The deceased was only 23 years old
and thus, the Tribunal should have applied the multiplier of
40. The compensation for loss of consortium to his wife at
Rs.10,000/- is on a very lower side. It is further submitted

FAO No.190/1994

Page 3 of 10

that the deceased was only 23 years of age and was
earning Rs.600/- per month, while studying in final year of
his graduation. The deceased after his graduation would
have earned minimum of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.3,000/- per
month, thus the Tribunal should have taken note of the
prospective earnings of deceased. The Appellants were
entitled to a minimum interest of 18% per annum, in the
facts and circumstances of the case.
5.

Ld. Counsel for the appellants has relied upon a

decision of Apex Court in Sarla Dixit & Ors. v. Balwant

Yadav & Ors., I (2004)ACC 396 (SC).
6.

On the other hand, it has been contended by the

learned counsel for the Respondents that the multiplier of
20 was rightly adopted in this case by the Tribunal,
keeping in view the age of deceased which was 23 years.
Even as per Second Schedule of the Act, the multiplier for
the age above 20 years but not exceeding 25 years is 17.
Moreover, the Tribunal has not deducted 1/3rd amount
towards personal expenses.

Thus, the compensation

awarded by the Tribunal is just and fair and already on the

FAO No.190/1994

Page 4 of 10

higher side.

Therefore, no enhancement is required and

the present appeal should be dismissed.
7.

Deceased Vidya Ram was aged 23 years at the time

of accident and he was earning Rs.600/- per month as
stated by father, Sh. TekChand of the deceased. The said
statement has not been challenged by the Respondents as
far as earning capacity of deceased is concerned.
8.

In Sarla Dixit(supra), the Apex Court has observed

as under;
“It is necessary to reiterate that the
multiplier method is logically sound and
legally well-established. There are some
cases which have proceeded to determine
the compensation on the basis of
aggregating the entire future earnings for
over the period the life expectancy was
lost, deducted a percentage therefrom
towards uncertainties of future life and
awarded
the
resulting
sum
as
compensation. This is clearly unscientific.
For instance, if the deceased was. say 25
years of age at the time of death and the
life expectancy is 70 years, this method
would multiply the loss of dependency for
45 years - virtually adopting a multiplier of
45 - and even if one-third or one-fourth is
deducted
therefrom
towards
the
uncertainties of future life and for
immediate lump sum payment, the
effective multiplier would be between 30
and 34. This is wholly impermissible. We

FAO No.190/1994

Page 5 of 10

are, aware that some decisions of the High
Courts and of this Court as well have
arrived at compensation on some such
basis. These decisions cannot be said to
have laid down a settled principle. They
are merely instances of particular awards
in individual cases. The proper method of
computation is the multiplier-method. A
departure, except in exceptional and
extraordinary cases, would introduce
inconsistency
of
principle,
lack
of
uniformity
and
an
element
of
unpredictability for the assessment of
compensation. Some judgments of the
High Courts have justified a departure
from the multiplier method on the ground
that Section 110-B of the Motor Vehicles
Act, 1939 insofar as it envisages the
compensation to be 'just', the statutory
determination of a 'just' compensation
would unshackle the exercise from any
rigid formula. It must be borne in mind
that the multiplier method is the accepted
method of ensuring a 'just' compensation
which will make for uniformity and
certainty of the awards. We disapprove
these decisions of the High Courts which
have taken a contrary view. We indicate
that the multiplier method is the
appropriate method, a departure from
which can only be justified in rare and
extraordinary circumstances and very
exceptional cases.”
Further, the Court has observed;
“So far as the adoption of the proper
multiplier is concerned, it was observed
that the future prospects of advancement
in life and career should also be sounded in
terms
of
money
to
augment
the
multiplicand. While the chance of the

FAO No.190/1994

Page 6 of 10

multiplier is determined by two factors,
namely, the rate of interest appropriate to
a stable economy and the age of the
deceased or of the claimant whichever is
higher,
the
ascertainment
of
the
multiplicand is a more difficult exercise.
Indeed, many factors have to be put into
the scales to evaluate the contingencies of
the future. All contingencies of the future
need not necessarily be baneful.”
9.

The deceased was 23 years of age at the time of

occurrence of the accident and he was survived by his
widow and his parents. The Tribunal has observed in the
impugned judgment that;
“Though the Supreme Court in a recent
judgment delivered on 6.1.93 in the case of
General Manager, Kerala State Road
Transport Corpn. v. Mrs. Sushma Thomas
etc. observed that ordinarily multiplier
should not exceed 16 yet in the present
case I feel that multiplier of at least 20
should be applied as the widow of the
deceased was only 20 years of age at the
time of death of deceased and she has long
life ahead of her. Smt. Munni devi is a
illiterate lady having no other source of
income. I, therefore, feel that multiplier of
20 years should be applied in this case. “

10.

Taking

in

view

the

age

of

the

deceased,

the

appropriate multiplier of 17 as laid down in the Second
Schedule of the Act should have been applied but the

FAO No.190/1994

Page 7 of 10

Tribunal has already taken a very liberal view by adopting
the multiplier of 20.
11.

The Apex Court has taken a view in catena of

judgments that the multiplier as laid down in the Second
Schedule of the Act can be deviated only under exceptional
circumstances otherwise normally the same acts as a
safeguard. Therefore, I do not find any infirmity in the
impugned award so far as the said multiplier of 20 is
concerned.
12.

Regarding the future prospects, the same cannot be

granted unless there is evidence to this effect on record.
There was no proof of educational qualification of deceased
on record to show that deceased was doing graduation.
Therefore, in view of Bijoy Kumar Duggar v. Bidagar

Dutta AIR 2006 SC 1255, the contention regarding the
future prospects is rejected.
13.

The judgment cited by Counsel for the Appellants

Sarla Dixit (supra) is not applicable to the facts of the
present case as in that case, the evidence showed that the
deceased was a Captain in the Army and he was qualified

FAO No.190/1994

Page 8 of 10

for promotion to the rank of a Major at the time of his
death whereas, in the present case no evidence regarding
the education or future prospects of the deceased is on
record.
14.

Further, the Second Schedule of the Act laid down

certain specific amounts payable against general damages
in the case of death such as for Loss of Consortium, if
beneficiary is the spouse. the amount laid down is Rs.
5,000/-. In the present case, the Tribunal has already
granted Rs.10,000/- towards loss of consortium, which
under any circumstances is on much higher side. Thus, I do
not find any ground to interfere with the decision of the
Tribunal in this regard.
15. As regards the award of interest @ 6% per annum,
the Tribunal held:
“Ordinarily simple interest @ 12% p.a. is
allowed but in the present case petitioners
took considerable long time to conclude
the proceedings. I, therefore, allow simple
interest @ 6% p.a. on the awarded amount
from the date of filing of the petition till
realization.”

FAO No.190/1994

Page 9 of 10

16.

In view of cogent reasoning given by the learned

Tribunal, I do not find any justification for increasing the
interest to 18% p.a.
17.

Thus, I do not find any infirmity or illegality in the

impugned judgment of the learned Tribunal and no ground
is made out for enhancing the award passed in this case.
The compensation amount awarded by learned Tribunal is
just and fair.
18.

The present appeal is thus not maintainable and is

dismissed.
19.

No order as to costs.
