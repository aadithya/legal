The facts as unfolded in the FIR, registered on

the intervening night of 10/11th of February, 1999 at
about 12 midnight

Pawan Kumar complainant, as

pillion riders.

The appellants and their

accomplice Ved Pal made Pawan Kumar to get down
from the truck. One Hans Raj (deceased), working as
a cleaner, was accompanying Pawan Kumar in the
truck at the relevant time. The appellants and their
third

accomplice

asked

Pawan

to

pay

Rs.5,000/- for causing damage to their scooter.
Instead of acceding to such demand Pawan Kumar
offered to get their scooter repaired. Pawan Kumar

Crl. Appeal No.427/2004

Page 3 of 30

as also the appellants and their third accomplice
went to a nearby mechanic shop. They came across
with one Imtiaz Ahmed there at the shop, who told
that an amount of Rs.1000-1500/- would have to be
incurred as cost of repair.

Pawan Kumar however,

informed that he had Rs.200-300/- only. Upon this
Ved Pal asked Pawan Kumar to accompany them to
the police station.

The appellants and Ved Pal left

the scooter at the mechanic shop and got into the
truck.

The truck thereafter started proceeding

towards Delhi.

After covering

a distance of about

half a kilometer on crossing Singhu Border, the
appellants and their accomplice Ved Pal asked
Pawan Kumar to stop the truck, which he did.

The

Pawan Kumar to the

other side of the road while Hans Raj (deceased)
remained seated in the truck only. On Pawan Kumar
inquiring as to where the police station is, appellant
Rajender Singh put a strip of cloth (patti) around his

Crl. Appeal No.427/2004

Page 4 of 30

neck and Ved Pal caught hold of his legs.

Both the

appellants pulled the strip of cloth piece

from

opposite ends as a result Pawan Kumar turned
unconscious. Thinking

him dead, the

appellants

threw Pawan Kumar into a road side pit along the
ganda nala. Pawan Kumar regained consciousness
around 4.00 am.

On opening his eyes he saw

appellant Rajender Singh standing
towards him.

Out of fear,

there looking

he shut his eyes and

stayed motionless. After staying there for about two
minutes, appellant Rajender Singh, thinking Pawan
Kumar to be dead, left. Pawan Kumar a shortwhile
thereafter crossed the ganda nala and reached a
nearby village where he met a watchman.

He told

him the entire happening. After having tea offered
by the watchman, Pawan Kumar took a lift in a
Canter

and reached

Haider Pur, the residence of

Sukhdev Singh, who happened to be the other driver
on the same very truck. Pawan Kumar narrated the
whole incident to Sukhdev Singh. Sukhdev Singh

Learned counsel for the respective appellants
argued that in recording the finding of conviction,
the learned

trial court

erred in making proper

evaluation of evidential value of statements of Pawan
Kumar, PW-6 and Imtiaz Ahmed, PW-7.

It was

contended that as far as taking away of truck loaded
with rice bags and commission of murder of Hans Raj
are concerned, there is no direct evidence in that
regard. Their further contention was that it was on
alleged disclosure statements of the

appellants on

their arrest in two different cases that led to their
arrest for their involvement in the present case.
According to learned counsel for the appellants it was
Pawan Kumar, PW-6, who was in fact involved in
commission of murder of Hans Raj, which is evident

learned trial court was not justified in concluding
that it were the appellants and their third accomplice
who had committed the murder of Hans Raj, cleaner
and had taken away the truck loaded with rice bags.

statement of Pawan Kumar, PW-6 with a view to

Ex. PW 33/B and Ex. PW 13/1, from the statement
of Pawan Kumar, PW 6 it is gathered that it was
somewhere on the other side of the road near point-H
in Ex. PW 13/1 where

the truck was got stopped.

While Pawan Kumar, PW-6 was taken to the other
side of the road, Hans Raj (deceased) remained
seated in the truck only. Immediately on reaching
the other side of the road, appellant Rajinder Singh
put a strip of cloth piece around his neck and while

superficial injuries on the person of Pawan Kumar,
PW-6 with no internal injuries to the neck structure.
In a case where two persons would try to strangle a
person to death by pulling ligature

from opposite

ends the chances of survival would appear to be
very remote. Pawan Kumar, PW-6 in the given case
however claims to have survived inspite of both the
appellants trying to strangle him to death. The fact

Crl. Appeal No.427/2004

Page 16 of 30

that Pawan Kumar, PW-6 did not visit a doctor or
hospital until he was taken to Hindu Rao Hospital at
about 4.10 pm on 11th February, 1999 shows that he
did not have any serious problem which needed to be
attended to immediately by a doctor. Pawan Kumar,

appellant Rajinder Singh continued to hang around
even after his strangling and murder of Hans Raj.
The prosecution case is that the appellants and their
accomplice were to get rid of Pawan Kumar (PW-6)
and Hans Raj with a view to rob the truck loaded
with 300 rice bags. If that was the intention, there
could be no reason for

Rajinder Singh appellant

continuing to be present at the spot for about three
hours in a chilly winter night.

The statement of

Pawan Kumar, PW-6 therefore, to the effect that on
regaining consciousness around 4.00 am he noticed
the appellant Rajinder Singh present there appears
to be difficult to believe.
15.

On regaining

consciousness Pawan Kumar,

PW-6, instead of going back to the truck to know
the well being of Hans Raj (deceased), quietly moved
away

to a village and thereafter proceeded to the

house of Sukhdev Singh, PW-16.

In the nearby

village Pawan Kumar, PW-6 claims to have had come
across with a watchman, who, on his narrating the

Crl. Appeal No.427/2004

Page 18 of 30

entire incident, offered him a cup of tea.

This

watchman has not been examined as a witness to
lend corroboration

to the statement of Pawan

Kumar, PW-6.
16.

According to Sukhdev Singh, PW-16, Pawan

Kumar, PW-6 had reached his house at about 8.00
am on 11th February, 1999 and told him about the
entire

incident.

He thereafter accompanied by

Pawan Kumar, PW-6 proceeded to

the spot

in a

three wheeler scooter. He started from his house at
about 11 am.

Why he took about three hours to

start from his house is not clear from the statement
of this witness. He deposed that from his house he

The

statements of Pawan Kumar, PW-6 and Sukhdev

point of time and the particular place from where
Sukhdev Singh, PW-3 was informed of the incident.
If the statement of Pawan Kumar, PW-6 is to be
accepted, he, accompanied by Sukhdev Singh, PW16, had first proceeded to the place where the truck

there

Apart from noticing that

the truck was not there, Pawan Kumar, PW-6 had no
knowledge by that time that the dead body of Hans
Raj, cleaner was lying there at some distance. Be it
the statement of Pawan Kumar, PW-6 or that of
Sukhdev Singh, PW-16 both were ignorant

of the

murder of Hans Raj by the time telephone call was

Crl. Appeal No.427/2004

Page 20 of 30

made to Sukhvinder Singh, PW-3. A reference to the
statement of Sukhvinder Singh, PW-3 however brings
out a different story.

According to him, he was

informed on phone by Sukhdev Singh, PW-16 that
as per information furnished by Pawan Kumar, PW6, Hans Raj, cleaner of the truck had been murdered
and the culprits had sped away in the truck with
loaded rice bags.

If this part of statement of

Sukhvinder Singh, PW-3 is to be accepted, it would
appear

that Pawan Kumar, PW-6 already had the

knowledge

of Hans Raj being murdered and the

truck loaded with rice bags being taken away.
Further, according to Sukhdev Singh, PW-16 as also
Inspector Sohan Vir Singh, PW-33, Pawan Kumar,
PW-6, accompanied by Sukhdev Singh, PW-16, had
reached the spot at about 12 noon. Inspector Sohan
Vir Singh remained present at the spot from 9.30 am
onwards.

Even Sukhdev Singh, PW-16 does not

claim that he had reached the spot before 12 noon
since he had started from his house at 11 am only

Crl. Appeal No.427/2004

Page 21 of 30

and was not expected to reach the spot before that.
Pawan Kumar, PW-6 on the contrary affirmed that he
saw the dead body of Hans Raj at about 8/9 a.m.
and identified the same.

This could not be true as

in that regard was received and

recorded in the daily diary vide Ex. PW 11/1. Pawan

STD booth and

pursuant to that call the

came to the booth and told him and Sukhdev Singh,
PW-16 that

them went with the police to the spot where the dead

There is however,

on record to find that Pawan Kumar, PW-6

or Sukhdev Singh, PW-16 ever made any phone call
to PCR in regard to the incident and that pursuant

Page 22 of 30

to any such phone call, the police had come to the
booth and took Pawan Kumar, PW-6 and Sukhdev
Singh, PW-16 to the spot to identify the dead body of
Hans Raj.

Inspector Sohan Vir Singh, PW-33

clearly falsifies the statement of Pawan Kumar, PW6 that the police had come to the STD booth and had

the spot.
17.

The articles lifted from the place where dead

body of Hans Raj was lying, included an ear ring and
a pair of cherry colour gurgabi (shoes), which Pawan
Kumar, PW-6 identified to belong to him. Notably, as
indicated in the scaled site plan Ex. PW-13/1 the
dead body of Hans Raj was found lying at a distance
of more than 122 mtrs. from the place where the
truck was got stopped.

The testimony of Imtiaz Ahmed, PW-7, held

the learned trial court corroborated the statement of
Pawan Kumar, PW-6 in regard to the identity of the
appellants.

As observed

hereinabove, contrary

the statement of this witness that a damaged

wheeler scooter was taken to his shop, there is no
affirmation by Pawan Kumar, PW-6, who happened
to be the sole witness on the point, that left front
wheel of his truck had in any way come into contact
with the two wheeler scooter. Thus, the fact that the

Crl. Appeal No.427/2004

Page 25 of 30

scooter had actually got damaged being not proved,
the question of it being taken to the shop of Imtiaz
Ahmed, PW-7 could not

have arisen. According to

Imtiaz Ahmed, PW-7 at the relevant time when the
scooter was

taken to his shop past midnight, he

was working at his shop. At such late night hours on
a chilly winter night, the affirmation of Imtiaz Ahmed,
PW-7 of being at work, is to be taken with a pinch of
salt. The shop was on lease with Imtiaz Ahmed, PW7.

to his shop in the morning and took away the scooter
with them.

At the relevant time apart from others

even the owner of the shop was present. Though the
shop owner had also seen the appellants and their
accomplice collecting the scooter from the repair
shop, he was not examined as a witness to lend
corroboration to Imtiaz Ahmed, PW-7's testimony. In

questionable nature of testimony of Pawan Kumar,

Recovery of scooter Ex. P-1 from the house of

appellant Rajinder Singh at his instance was claimed
to have been effected on 5th April, 1999 in the
presence of police officials only. Learned trial court
inspite of being conscious

of discrepancies in the

statements of police officials witnessing the recovery
accepted such recovery as it found that the police
officials would not have known otherwise than on a
disclosure by appellant Rajinder Singh that scooter
Ex. P-1 was lying there in his house. While recording
such

a finding the learned trial court appears to

have presupposed that recovery of scooter Ex. P-1
was effected from the house of appellant Rajinder
Singh only.

No person from the village was

from the house of appellant Rajinder Singh.

The

scooter Ex. P-1 is not claimed to be owned by
appellant Rajinder Singh. The police did not try to

Where the situation is that

a stolen one, recovery thereof from the house of
appellant Rajinder Singh sounds somewhat strange.

hereinabove, the learned trial court overlooked the

We find such a reasoning clearly fallacious. The

scrutinize the statement of Pawan Kumar, PW-6 on a

barely

It is difficult to lose

sight of the major discrepancies in the statement of
Pawan Kumar, PW-6 which render it highly unsafe to
make his testimony as a basis to record the finding of
conviction against the appellants. But for doubtful
recovery of scooter Ex. P-1 at the instance of
appellant Rajinder Singh, no recovery of any other
incriminating material has been proved on record
which could

lead to

connect them with the

commission of crimes in question. It is only on a last

Imtiaz Ahmed, PW-7 that

reach the same conclusion. In view of impeachable
testimony of Pawan Kumar, PW-6, the prime witness,
