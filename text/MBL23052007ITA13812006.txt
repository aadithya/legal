MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
The Revenue is aggrieved by an order dated 10th March,
2006 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench 'G' in
ITA No.4438/Del/05 relevant for the assessment year 1997-98.

2.

After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we admit this

appeal under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) and
frame the following substantial question of law for consideration:
Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was justified in
law in holding that the initiation of proceedings under
Section 147/148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was bad in
law?

3.

Filing of paper books is dispensed with.

4. The assessee carries on the business of financing and investment.
In respect of the assessment year 1997-98, the assessee filed its
return of income declaring an income of Rs.42,700/-. The return
was processed under Section 143(1)(a) of the Act on 24th March
1998.

On 28th April, 2003, the Assessing Officer received a letter

from the Additional Director of Income Tax (Investigation), Unit VII,
New Delhi informing him that the assessee was involved in giving and
taking bogus entries/transactions during the financial year 1996-97. It
appears that the Assessing Officer was also informed that there was a
survey in the office premises of one Sanjay Rastogi, Chartered
Accountant and in his deposition the said Sanjay Rastogi stated that a
credit of Rs.5,00,000/- was given by M/s Mehram Exports Pvt. Ltd. to
the assessee and that this was a bogus transaction.

6.

Based on the above information, the Assessing Officer

recorded the following reasons for issuing a notice under Section 148 of
the Income Tax Act, 1961:

“It has been informed by the Additional Director of Income
Tax (Investigation), Unit VII, New Delhi vie letter No. 138
dated 08.04.2003 that this company was involved in the
giving and taking bogus entries/transactions during the F.Y.
1996-97, as per the deposition made before them by Shri
Sanjay Rastogi, C.A. during a survey operation conducted at
his office premises by the Investigation Wing.
The
particulars of some of the transaction of this nature are as
under: -

5,00,000/Through the Bank Account No. CA 4266 of M/s. Mehram
Exports Pvt. Ltd. in the P.N.B., New Rohtak Road, New
Delhi.
NOTE:
It is noted that there might by more such entries
apart from the above.
The return of income for the A.Y. 1997-98 was filed by the
assessee on 04.03.1998 which was accepted under section
143(1) at the declared income of Rs.42,00/-. In view of these
facts, I have reason to believe that the amount of such
transactions particularly that of Rs.5,00,000/- (as mentioned
above) has escaped the assessment within the meaning of the
proviso to section 147 and clause (b) to the Explanation 2 of
this section.
Submitted to the Addl. CIT, Range-12, New Delhi for
approval to issue notice u/s 148 for the Asstt. Year 1997-98,
if approved.”

The assessee contested the reopening of his assessment

before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [CIT (A)]. While
rejecting the challenge made by the assessee, the CIT (A) held that the
assessee had merely disclosed the fact that he had received share
application money. What the assessee did not disclose was the true
source and nature of the receipt and to this extent, the assessee did not
make a full and true disclosure of facts. Since the assessee did not fully
ITA No.1381/2006

Page 4 of 9

and truly disclose all material facts necessary for assessment, the
Assessing Officer could reopen the assessment even though four years
had gone by from the end of the relevant assessment year.

On the

merits of the case, the CIT (A) held that the information received by the
Assessing Officer was specific and clear and, therefore, no error had
been committed in reopening the assessment.

8.

In appeal before the Tribunal, it was contended on behalf of

the assessee that the Assessing Officer had merely acted on the basis of
some letter without making any enquiry in respect of the truth of the
contents of that letter. Consequently, it was contended that the reasons
recorded were not those of the Assessing Officer but were effectively
those of the Additional Director of Income Tax (Investigation), Unit
VII, New Delhi. The Tribunal took the view that the Assessing Officer
had not made any enquiry or investigation on his own to form a belief
that income of the assessee had escaped assessment. It also concluded
that there was nothing to show in what capacity Sanjay Rastogi had
made his statement and, therefore, the information obtained by the
Assessing Officer is vague, hearsay and indefinite having no direct

ITA No.1381/2006

Page 5 of 9

nexus with the formation of belief regarding escapement of income. On
this basis, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the initiation of
proceedings was invalid.

9.

We are of the opinion that the Tribunal erred in arriving at

the conclusion that it did. At the outset, it must be appreciated that the
Supreme Court has said in Raymond Woollen Mills Ltd. v. Income-tax
Officer, (1999) 236 ITR 34 that the Court is only required to see
whether there is some prima facie material on the basis of which the
Revenue could reopen the case. The sufficiency or correctness of the
material cannot be gone into at this stage.

10.

Applying the law laid down by the Supreme Court, what has

to be considered is whether there was some material, even though of a
prima facie nature, which would constitute “information” enabling the
Assessing Officer to have a reason to believe that income had escaped
assessment. On a perusal of the reasons recorded by the Assessing
Officer, it is clear that he had relied upon information received by him
to the effect that a survey operation was conducted at the office

ITA No.1381/2006

Page 6 of 9

premises of Sanjay Rastogi. Information was given by Sanjay Rastogi
that at least in respect of one cheque bearing No.305002 dated 18th
November, 1996, a transaction had taken place which related to a bogus
entry concerning M/s Mehram Exports Pvt. Ltd. The bank and the
account number relating to the bogus entry/transaction was also
mentioned. This, in our opinion, was adequate and specific material to
come to the conclusion that income had escaped assessment because of
a bogus transaction having been entered into between the assessee and
M/s Mehram Exports Pvt. Ltd. Whether eventually the information is
correct or not cannot be decided at this stage as held in Raymond
Woollen Mills.

11.

In Income-tax Officer v. Lakhmani Mewal Das, (1976) 103

ITR 437, it has been held that there is a duty cast upon the assessee to
make a full and true disclosure of the primary facts at the time of
original assessment. The Income Tax Officer can issue a notice under
Section 148 of the Act in respect of an assessment if he has reason to
believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment and that
such income has escaped assessment by reason of an omission or failure

ITA No.1381/2006

Page 7 of 9

on the part of the assessee to fully and truly disclose all material facts
for the purposes of making an assessment. Of course, the reason for
initiating proceedings under Section 148 of the Act must have a rational
connection or a direct nexus with the material which leads the Income
Tax Officer to form a belief that income has escaped assessment due to
the failure of the assessee to fully and truly disclose all material facts.

12.

In so far as the present case is concerned, as we have already

indicated above, there was material to prima facie come to the
conclusion that the assessee had not disclosed all relevant facts truly and
fully. There can be no doubt that on the facts of the present case, there
was a live link or a direct nexus between the material which suggested
escapement of income and the information on the basis of which it could
be concluded that income had escaped assessment.

The reasons

recorded by the Assessing Officer specifically related to a particular
transaction, by way of an example, in respect of the concerned financial
year which would suggest that a bogus entry or a transaction had been
generated. If the fact regarding the bogus entry or transaction is found
to be correct, it may be difficult to say that income of Rs.5,00,000/-, the

ITA No.1381/2006

Page 8 of 9

subject matter of the bogus entry, had not escaped assessment.

13.

Under the circumstances, we are satisfied that there was

enough material before the Assessing Officer to initiate proceedings
under Section 147/148 of the Act and that the Tribunal had failed to
correctly appreciate the legal position and instead of proceeding on the
basis that there must be some prima facie material, the Tribunal
erroneously proceeded on the basis that the material must stand the test
of proof in regular proceedings. This is not the law as laid down by the
Supreme Court and, therefore, we have no hesitation in answering the
substantial question of law in the negative.

14.

Since the Tribunal has not gone into the merits of the case,

we remand the case back to it for a decision on merits.

15.

The appeal is disposed of.
