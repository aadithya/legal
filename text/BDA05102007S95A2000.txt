1.

The learned counsel for the applicant submits that by way of this

application, the objections to the award were filed. The respondent had also
filed objections which were dismissed by an order dated 19.07.2002.
Thereafter, payments have also been made in execution of the said award.
However, these objections of the applicant / claimant had not been disposed of.

2.

There are only two objections and they pertain to – (i) claim Nos.

2, 3 and 10 and (ii) Claim No.17. Insofar as the first objection is concerned, it

is stated by the learned counsel for the claimant / objector that a sum of Rs
36,000/- has been deducted by the learned Arbitrator without any reason. He
submitted that the liability of the claimant did not extend beyond six months of
the completion of work. The completion of the work took place on 01.08.1985.
The amount of Rs 36,000/- pertains to a period beyond the period of six months
from the completion of the work and, therefore, the learned Arbitrator ought
not to have deducted the said amount from the claimant's claim. The learned
Arbitrator had deducted Rs 36,000/- in the following manner:“It is stated in the affidavit of Mr N. Kishore EE/DDA
that a letter dated 16.12.1987 (Ex. R-2) and yet another
letter dated 9.2.1988 (Ex. R-1) in this regard were sent
but the Claimants paid no heed. In proof, they alleged
that in one case the allottee K.K. Sharma approached the
consumer Forum, vide order dated 24.4.1998 of the
Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum No.IV Delhi in
respect of Block R. 53/D Dilshad Garden in case
No.1292/97/30 with a complaint that there was seepage
in toilet, kitchen and bathroom and further that on
22.8.1996, plaster and iron of the ceiling in one room
fell down. The Forum directed the D.D.A. to repair the
damage within 3 months and also pay Rs.10,000/- as
compensation and Rs.1000 as costs of litigation. A copy
of the said order has been filed. In their application
dated 28.7.1998, the Respondents have stated that the
repair work directed as aforesaid has cost them
Rs.25000/- upon consideration I find that this amount of
Rs.36000/- deserves to be deducted by the Respondents
from the amount remaining to be paid to the Claimants.”

3.

The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that this is a

finding of fact and the learned Arbitrator has considered the evidence on record

IA No.3204/2000 in CS(OS) 95A/2000

Page No.2 of 4

and thereafter permitted the respondent to retain the amount of Rs 36,000/-.
She submitted that this court does not sit as a court of appeal over the findings
of an Arbitrator and, therefore, the said finding ought not to be disturbed.

4.

I have considered the arguments advanced by the counsel for the

parties and I find that the sum of Rs 36,000/- pertains to an expenditure made
by the respondent after the expiry of six months beyond the completion date.
The claimants were only liable for any defects which would have arisen during
that six months period, therefore, the claimant cannot be denied or deprived of
the said sum of Rs 36,000/- which was not at all relatable to the period of six
months. To this extent, the award made by the learned Arbitrator is ex facie
wrong. It is not a case of re-appreciation of evidence or disturbing a finding of
fact. The Arbitrator had completely ignored the specific term of the contract
between the parties that the claimant's liability was restricted to defects within
six months of the completion date. The said amount of Rs 36,000/- did not
have any relation to any defect during the said six month period.

5.

With regard to the next objection, the learned counsel for the

petitioner submits that the learned Arbitrator has disallowed the claim for Rs
27,907/- for outer plastering beyond 10 metre height relying upon clause 3.15
of the specifications. He submitted that clause 3.15 was over-ridden by clause
13.1.9.8 of the CPWD Specifications of work at Delhi, Volume Nos. II and III
IA No.3204/2000 in CS(OS) 95A/2000

Page No.3 of 4

of 1967 (with correction slip upto the date of receipt of the tender). Although
the CPWD Specifications for works at Delhi do help the claimant / objector, but
they are not applicable to the present agreement because clause 3.1 of the
specifications and conditions of the agreement between the parties, which
provides for the application of the CWPD Specifications, has been deleted.
Therefore, no grievance can be made with regard to the Arbitrator's award in
respect of Claim No.17.

6.

This application stands allowed to the extent that the objection in

respect of the disallowance of the claim to the extent of Rs 36,000/- is
sustained. However, the objection with regard to claim No.17 is rejected. The
amount of Rs 36,000/- shall be payable by the respondents to the claimant
alongwith interest @ 6% per annum from the date of the award till the same is
actually paid.
