A.K. SIKRI, J.

In all these writ petitions common question of law is involved,
namely, whether services of an Army man can be terminated and he be
discharged invoking the provisions of Rule 13(3)III(V) on the basis of Red
Ink Entry awarded to such an official in a service career by way of
reprimand and imposition of service on earlier occasion.

Under what

circumstances this issue has arisen in these cases would be treated taking
note of facts of each case:
WP(C )No.3874/95
The petitioner herein was enrolled in the Army on 31.8.1982
and allocated to the Unit of 23 Mechanized Infantry. In September, 1985
he was appointed as Lance Naik. In April,1986 he was promoted to the rank
of Naik. In February,1990 he got further promotion to the rank of Havildar.
In December,1990 he was posted with NCC Unit at Belgaum where he
remained till 1993. On 4.4.1993 he returned to the Unit and posted to `C’
Company. Between September,1993 to December,1994 i.e. within a span of
15 months the petitioner was implicated four times on charge of intoxication
and was punished. In this manner, during this period of 15 months, four Red
Ink Entries were given on the basis of said punishments. Though we may
point out that as per the petitioner, respondent no.3 herein was inimical to
W.P.(C )Nos.3874/95 & 1930/03

Page 2 of 11

him who had taken charge of Senior JCO of `C’ Company in April,1993 as
he had reported theft case against him in September,1989 and as a
retribution he had falsely implicated the petitioner herein. However, for the
purpose of this case we need not go into the allegation of mala fide and bias
against respondent no.3 in view of the fact that we are deciding the issue that
has arisen on legal grounds.
After awarding four Red Ink Entries, a show cause notice dated
16.3.1995 was served upon the petitioner for discharging his service under
Army Rule 13(3)III(V). The petitioner submitted his reply. However, the
respondent went ahead with passing discharge orders whereby terminating
the services of the petitioner w.e.f. 1.4.1995. According to the petitioner he
thereafter made various attempts to seek hearing of the Chief of Army Staff
or other senior officers but was refused access to them. Feeling aggrieved
the petitioner preferred this petition in October,1995 challenging the
discharge order on various grounds. At the time of hearing, two principle
submissions were made by Mr.C.M.Khanna, learned counsel for the
petitioner, namely:
1. Discharge order on the basis of aforesaid Red Ink Entries is illegal.
2. The petitioner was never served with the discharge order passed after
the show cause notice. Even with the counter-affidavit no such order
W.P.(C )Nos.3874/95 & 1930/03

Page 3 of 11

is placed on record. The petitioner was only given the discharge
certificate.
We find from the reading of the writ petition that there is no
specific allegation in the writ petition about the non-service of the order.
Even otherwise it is not necessary to go into this aspect as the petition
warrants to be allowed accepting the first contention raised by learned
counsel for the petitioner. The issue as to whether Red Ink Entries awarded
to a person would be sufficient to expel a person from service has been
authoritatively determined by this Court in a series of judgments.

A

Division Bench of this Court in the case of Surinder Singh Sihag Vs.
Union of India & Ors. 100 (2002) DLT 705 decided this question and held
that on the basis of such Red Ink Entries, an employee cannot be discharged
under Army Rule 13(3)III(V).

That was also a case where the petitioner

had incurred 5 Red Ink Entries in his service record as per which he was
given severe reprimand three times on the charge of intoxication which is an
offence under Section 48 of the Army Act; was deprived of his appointment
as Lance Naik on one occasion for the same act under Section 48 of the
Army Act; and was awarded 28 days rigorous imprisonment for a charge
under Section 39(a) of the Army Act. On the basis of these 5 Red Ink
Entries he was served with similar show cause notice dated 13.9.1999
W.P.(C )Nos.3874/95 & 1930/03

Page 4 of 11

proposing to terminate his services under aforesaid Army Rule whereafter
his services were terminated vide order dated 1.12.1999.

The Division

Bench in its judgment noted that under Section 80 of the Army Act
punishment can be awarded to persons other than Officers, Junior
Commissioned Officers and Warrant Officers. It was further found that as
per Circular Letter dated 28.12.1988 a particular procedure was to be
followed for initiating action for dismissal or discharge of person under
Army Rule 13 and Army Rule 17. This procedure included holding of
preliminary enquiry, i.e., an impartial enquiry (not necessarily a Court of
Inquiry) into the allegations against such an employee and giving him
adequate opportunity of putting up his defence and explanation and/or
adducing evidence in defence and recording an opinion that the allegation
substantiated. The said enquiry warranted extreme step of termination of the
individual services on the merits of the case.

On that basis the Court

observed as under:
“From a bare perusal of the aforesaid Clause (a), it appears
that preliminary enquiry is required to be held. Thus, the
delinquent employee must be given an adequate
opportunity of putting his defence or explanation or
adducing evidence in support of his case. The allegations
against him must be substantial.
Extreme step of
termination of the individual’s service is warranted only
upon considering the merit of each case.

W.P.(C )Nos.3874/95 & 1930/03

Page 5 of 11

Recommendations for dismissal or discharge are required
to be forwarded to the Competent Authority, whereupon
the intermediate authorities must consider the case in the
light what is stated in Clause (a) above.
Only upon receipt of the show-cause notice action
thereupon can be taken and thereafter only the Competent
Authority may pass final orders.
Note 2 appended to Clause (f) of paragraph 5 clearly spells
out the procedures required to be followed. In the instant
case, the procedures laid down have been given a complete
go-bye.”

The Court also referred to and relied upon the judgment of
Supreme Court in the case of D.K.Yadav Vs. J.M.A. Industries Ltd. (1993) 3
SCC 259 as well as Constitutional Bench judgment of the Apex Court in the
case of Delhi Transport Corpn. Vs. D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress 1991 Suppl.
(1) SCC 600 and set-aside the impugned order of discharge. Same view has
been taken consistently by this Court in number of subsequent judgments,
some of which are as under:
1. Rajesh Kumar Vs. Union of India and others WP(C )No.5642/2002
decided on 8.12.2004 (DB).
2.Ex.SHGO Rakesh Kumar Sharma Vs. Union of India & Ors. WP(C)
No.667/94 decided on 22.02.2008 (this very Bench has followed the dicta
laid down in the aforesaid cases).

W.P.(C )Nos.3874/95 & 1930/03

Page 6 of 11

The principle of law laid down in the aforesaid judgments is clear:
opportunity of putting defence or explanation or adducing evidence is to be
given to the concerned employee against whom the action is proposed to be
taken under Army Rule 13. For this purpose it is also necessary that a show
cause notice is given to the concerned official and only after eliciting his
reply thereupon the Competent Authority is to pass final orders.
Notwithstanding this principle of law laid down by this Court which is
repeatedly followed, the learned counsel for the respondents made an
endeavour to impress upon to this Court that this principle is not correct and
is based on wrong appreciation of the provisions of the Army Rule.
Submission in this behalf is that no such preliminary enquiry was required to
be held or opportunity given to the delinquent employee of putting his
defence or explanation or adducing evidence in support of his case. It was
argued that when the Red Ink Entries were given earlier, they were based on
an appropriate enquiry etc. which was needed and, therefore, the requisite
procedure as per the Rules for imposing such penalties was followed. Now
the action which was taken invoking provisions of Army Rule 13(3)III(v), it
was on the basis of those Red Ink Entries and the only consideration was as
to whether such a person is to be retained in service or be discharged from
service having regard to his service record containing those Red Ink Entries.
W.P.(C )Nos.3874/95 & 1930/03

Page 7 of 11

This argument of the learned counsel for the respondent, however,
is to be rejected in view of the aforesaid principle of law laid down by this
Court. We have already pointed out above that the consistent view is taken
by this Court that requisite procedure is to be followed even when question
is as to whether such an employee is to be retained in service or not.

The

aforesaid judgments of this Court bind us and there is no reason to take a
different view.
The last attempt made on the part of learned counsel for the
respondent was to argue that the petitioner in this case was discharged from
service on his own request as he sought discharge due to personal family
problems. We find from the record that in reply to show case notice the
petitioner has, inter alia, stated as under (English translation):
“I, therefore, request your good-self that keeping in
view my problem, I may kindly be relieved from the
military service so that I am able to attend to my
family problems. For this I shall ever remain
obliged”.
We also find that after his discharge when the petitioner had
made representation dated 10.8.1995 he was sent reply dated 8.9.1995
whereby rejecting his request on two grounds, namely, (1) he was not
entitled to remain in service in the interest of military discipline having
regard to his service record; and (2) that in his letter dated 21.3.1995 he had
W.P.(C )Nos.3874/95 & 1930/03

Page 8 of 11

himself asked for his release from Army service. However, it is not a case
where his request contained in reply dated 21.3.1995 was accepted and he
was discharged from service treating that request as a resignation. Fact
remains that he was discharged /terminated from service on the basis of
show cause notice. This action is found to be unsustainable. Therefore, we
have no hesitation in setting-aside the termination order. At the same time
keeping in view the aforesaid conduct of the petitioner, we are of the opinion
that petitioner would not be entitled to any salary of the intervening period.
We, therefore, set-aside the impugned order of termination as illegal and
direct reinstatement of the petitioner in service with no benefit of salary and
other allowances for the intervening period. We are also of the opinion that
for the purpose of terminal benefits the intervening period during which the
petitioner remained out of job shall not be counted.
WP(C )No. 1930/2003
The petitioner herein was enrolled in the regular Army on
11.7.1988 as combatant soldier and was posted to 18 Kumaon Regiment.
On 6.11.1998 he was posted to 26 Rashtriya Rifles Battalion at Kupwara in
J&K State. This sector is known to be most terrorist infested area. The
petitioner started taking alcohol being issued to the troops.

The petitioner

was implicated three times, i.e., on 6.5.99, 16.5.99 and 11.2.2000 on charge
of intoxication and was punished. In this manner, during this period, three
W.P.(C )Nos.3874/95 & 1930/03

Page 9 of 11

Red Ink Entries under Section 48 of the Army Act,1950 were given on the
basis of said punishments.

Though we may point out that as per the

petitioner, the Commanding Officer 26 Rashtriya Rifles Battalion who was
not from Kumaon Regiment did not like the petitioner and it was because of
his pre-determination with mala fide intention the petitioner was awarded
severe reprimand, three times within a period of six months. On 22.4.2000
the petitioner was posted back to his unit 18 Kumaon Regiment.

On

1.4.2001 the petitioner was promoted to the rank of Naik. On 20.1.2003 the
petitioner was again awarded severe reprimand under Section 48 of Army
Act, 1950. In February,2002 the record office of the Kumaon regiment
Ranikhet intimated the commanding officer that the petitioner has been
awarded four red ink entries therefore he could be discharged from service.
After awarding four Red Ink Entries, a show cause notice dated
6.3.2002 was served upon the petitioner for discharging their service under
Army Rule 13(3)III(V). The petitioner submitted his reply in which he
clearly admitted that he had been given opportunity to improve his habit and
character but he failed to do so. Thereafter the petitioner was discharged
from service on 8.4.2002. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner preferred this
petition in March,2003 challenging the discharge order on various grounds.

W.P.(C )Nos.3874/95 & 1930/03

Page 10 of 11

Fact remains that he was discharged /terminated from service
on the basis of show cause notice. This action is found to be unsustainable.
Therefore, we have no hesitation in setting-aside the termination order. At
the same time keeping in view the aforesaid conduct of the petitioner, we are
of the opinion that petitioner would not be entitled to any salary of the
intervening period.

We, therefore, set-aside the impugned order of

termination as illegal and direct reinstatement of the petitioner in service
with no benefit of salary and other allowances of the intervening period. We
are also of the opinion that for the purpose of terminal benefits the
intervening period during which the petitioner remained out of job shall not
be counted.
