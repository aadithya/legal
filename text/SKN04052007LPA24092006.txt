SANJIV KHANNA, J:
1.

The present appeals by legal representatives of Elluru

Pandurangappa and Smt. Yashodamma, wife of Late Mr. Naganna arise
out of common judgment and involve somewhat common questions.
These appeals are therefore being disposed of by this common
judgment. The appeals are directed against judgment dated 13th July,
2006 passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing the Writ Petitions

LPA 2409&2412/2006

Page 2

filed by the appellants on the ground of laches and upholding the stand
of the respondent that the appellants are entitled to grant of pension
under the freedom fighter's Scheme from the date of the order and not
from the date when the applications were made.
2.

In 1980, the Central Government formulated Swatantra Sainik

Samman Pension Scheme (hereinafter referred to as the Scheme, for
short). On fulfilling the terms and conditions mentioned in the Scheme, a
freedom fighter who had espoused the cause of freedom from foreign
rule and had suffered on that account is entitled to pension. This Scheme
introduced in 1980 was in modification of and liberalised the earlier
Freedom Fighters Pension Scheme introduced in 1972. The freedom
fighters are entitled to the benefit under the new Scheme irrespective of
their present income and as a token of honour/ samman to them. The
Scheme made specific provision of pension for different category of
freedom fighters who had suffered because of their participation in the
freedom struggle.
3.

As question of laches is involved it will be appropriate to refer to

the facts of the two cases.
4.

The appellant in LPA 2409- Elluru Pandurangappa had sent a

representation dated 10th November, 1986 to the Central Government.
However, as the appellant had not submitted his pension application,
vide letter dated 28th November, 1986 he was requested to submit his

LPA 2409&2412/2006

Page 3

pension application in advance to the Central Government and pursue
the matter with the State Government for verification.
5.

In 1988, the appellant filed Writ Petition No. 13229/1988 before

the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore. In the said Writ Petition, Union
of India was directed to consider the application of the appellant.
Thereafter, pension application was received by the Central Government
on 21st March, 1988. After considering the same, pension application was
rejected on 27th March, 1989 on the ground that the said appellant had
failed to furnish documentary evidence from official records and
recommendation report of the State Government. As per the affidavit filed
by the respondent in the appeal, in the pension application the appellant
had not claimed that he was in jail or had gone underground and against
both the relevant columns in the application form, the appellant had
specifically marked 'No'.
6.

Subsequently, the Government of Karnataka recommended the

claim of the appellant. In the copy of the pension application forwarded
by the State Government, the appellant had claimed that he had gone
underground during the freedom struggle and suffered on that account.
The columns in the application form relating to 'underground suffering'
had been filled up and mentioned 'Yes' in affirmative. The respondent
Union of India examined the claim and rejected the application vide letter
dated 10th August, 1990 as the appellant was not able to substantiate the

LPA 2409&2412/2006

Page 4

claim with the help of official documents. The appellant had claimed that
he had gone underground due to participation in Hyderabad liberation
movement but there was nothing on record to show jail suffering or
underground suffering for minimum period of six months, required for
being considered eligible for grant of pension.
7.

It appears that the appellant then approached Ministry of Home

Affairs which accorded sanction from the date of approval, i.e. 25th
December, 1991. Accordingly, the appellant started getting pension
w.e.f. the said date . The appellant had since expired and now his wife is
getting the pension as per the Scheme.
8.

The appellant herein after a lapse of 14 years approached the

Court by filing Writ Petition No. 8413/2004, inter alia, praying that he
should be granted arrears of pension from the date of his application till
25th December, 1991. The said claim had been rejected by the learned
Single Judge.
9.

In LPA 2412, the appellant-Smt. Yashodamma is the wife of late

Mr. Naganna who had submitted an application under the Scheme. By
letter dated 16th April, 1992 Mr. Naganna was communicated and
informed that he had been sanctioned pension @ Rs.750/- p.m. w.e.f.
25th December, 1991. On 17th September, 1993, Mr. Naganna expired
and thereafter the pension is being paid to his wife-appellant herein. The
appellant has no grievance and the pension is being regularly being paid

LPA 2409&2412/2006

Page 5

to her.
10.

In 2005,

the appellant filed Writ Petition No. 12676/2005

claiming arrears of pension from 20th October, 1981 till 24th December,
1991 were payable to her husband Mr. Naganna. Reliance in this regard
was placed upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Civil Writ
No.12676/2004 titled Duli Chand and others versus Union of India
and others reported in (1992) 2 SCC 28 wherein by order dated 16th
July, 1990 pension was directed to be paid w.e.f. 1st August, 1980 and
also Civil Writ No. 153/1992 decided on 14th May, 1993 wherein pension
was directed to be paid from the date when the original application was
received from the applicants, whether or not the said applicants had
initially filed requisite evidence.
11.

Learned counsel for the appellants also placed reliance upon

the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in LPA No.1821/2006
titled Sadashiva Raj Purohit versus Union of India.

In the said

decision a reference was also made to an earlier decision of this Court in
W.P.(C). No. 8481/2004 decided on 11th January, 2005 titled Indumati
Bai versus Union of India, which decision was subsequently upheld by
the Division Bench vide Order dated 11th July, 2006.
12.

We have examined the decision of the Division Bench of this

Court in Sadashiva Raj Purohit (supra). In the said case, the Division
Bench has given a specific finding that there was nothing on record to

LPA 2409&2412/2006

Page 6

substantiate and show that pension was granted by giving benefit of
doubt. It was also held that there was nothing on record in the form of
document or affidavit to establish and substantiate that pension was
granted to the appellant therein on the ground of benefit of doubt.
13.

The question whether pension was granted on benefit of doubt

had arisen in view of the subsequent decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of Government of India versus K.V. Swaminathan reported in
(1997) 10 SCC 190 wherein it has been held that where pension is
granted on benefit of doubt, the same is required to be paid from the date
of order of sanction and not from the date of the application. This
decision of the Supreme Court has been subsequently followed in Union
of India versus Ganesh Chand Dolai reported in (1997) 10 SCC 289.
14.

As far as the case of Elluru Pandurangappa is concerned, the

matter is covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
Ganesh Chand Dolai (supra) and the subsequent decisions holding,
inter alia, that where pension has been granted giving benefit of doubt,
the same is payable from the date of sanction and not from the date of
application itself.
15.

We have also examined the decision of the Division Bench of

this Court in Sadashiva Raj Purohit and find that the question of laches
and delay in filing the writ petition has not been examined and dealt with.
The said decision, therefore, cannot be held to be a binding decision on

LPA 2409&2412/2006

Page 7

this Court on the question of laches and delay. It would be appropriate to
refer to the case of Municipal Council, Ahmednagar v. Shah Hyder
Beig, reported in (2000) 2 SCC 48 in which has been held by the
Supreme Court as under:
“14. ...It is now a well-settled principle of law
and we need not dilate on this score to the
effect that while no period of limitation is fixed
but in the normal course of events, the period
the party is required for filing a civil
proceeding ought to be the guiding factor.
While it is true that this extraordinary
jurisdiction is available to mitigate the
sufferings of the people in general but it is not
out of place to mention that this extraordinary
jurisdiction has been conferred on to the law
courts under Article 226 of the Constitution
on a very sound equitable principle. Hence,
the equitable doctrine, namely, “delay defeats
equity” has its fullest application in the matter
of grant of relief under Article 226 of the
Constitution. The discretionary relief can be
had provided one has not by his act or
conduct given a go-by to his rights. Equity
favours a vigilant rather than an indolent
litigant...”

16.

Similarly in case of Shri Vallabh Glass Works Ltd. v. Union of

India, reported in (1984) 3 SCC 362 it has been held as follows:
“While there are different periods of limitation
prescribed for the institution of different kinds of suits
by the Limitation Act, 1963, there is no such period
prescribed by law in respect of petitions filed under
Article 226 of the Constitution. Whether relief should
be granted to a petitioner under Article 226 of the
Constitution where the cause of action had arisen in
the remote past is a matter of sound judicial
discretion governed by the doctrine of laches. Where
a petitioner who could have availed of the alternative

LPA 2409&2412/2006

Page 8

remedy by way of suit approaches the High Court
under Article 226 of the Constitution, it is appropriate
ordinarily to construe any unexplained delay in the
filing of the writ petition after the expiry of the period
of limitation prescribed for filing a suit as
unreasonable.”
17.

In both these Appeals pension was sanctioned from the date of the

order, namely, 16th April, 1992 in the case of Mr. Naganna and in the
case of Mr. Elluru Pandurangappa from 25th December, 1991. The writ
petitions came to be filed after nearly

14 years in 2004 and 2005,

respectively. Laches and delay on the face of the records is apparent.
There are no averments or allegations in the petition explaining this delay
and laches. As mentioned above, though no time period has been
prescribed for filing a writ petition challenging an Order but it is well
settled that a writ petition should be filed within reasonable period.
Directing payment of arrears of pension for periods prior to 1992/1991 in
writ petitions filed after gap of 14 years will not be justified and proper. It
may be appropriate to refer to the decision in State of Rajasthan versus
D.R. Laxmi,

reported in (1996) 6 SCC 445 wherein the following

observations of H.W.R. Wade

in Administrative Law (7th Edn.) was

quoted with approval:“The truth of the matter is that the court will
invalidate an order only if the right remedy is
sought by the right person in the right proceedings
and circumstances.
The order may be
hypothetically a nullity, but the court may refuse to
quash it because of the plaintiff's lack of standing,
because he does not deserve a discretionary
remedy, because he has waived his rights, or for
some other legal reason. In any such case the
'void' order remains effective and is, in reality,
valid. It follows that an order may be void against
one person but valid against another. A common
case where an order, however void, becomes valid
is where a statutory time- limit expires after which

LPA 2409&2412/2006

Page 9

its validity cannot be questioned. The statute does
not say that the void order shall be valid; but by
cutting off legal remedies it produces that result.”
18.

In view of the above, we do not find any merit in the present

appeals and the same are dismissed. No costs.
