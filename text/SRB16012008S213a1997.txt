Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat (Open Court)
1.

The present petition has been filed under Sections 8 and

20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 (hereinafter referred as “the Act”) for
filing of arbitration agreement and reference of the disputes between
the parties to Arbitration.
2.

The brief facts discernible from the plaint are that the

plaintiff was entered into an agreement dated 4.2.1988 with
M/s.Henry Simon Ltd., for promotion of sales of their breakfast cereal
plants.

The plaintiff was entitled, for the work done by it,

CS(OS) 213-A/97

1 of 18

compensation by way of commission to be paid by the principal i.e.
the said M/s. Henry Simon Ltd. Clause 13 of the Agreement defined
the rate of commission in regard to various classes and categories of
goods, to be marketed by the plaintiff.

The agreement contained a

stipulation that inter se disputes would be referred for arbitration.
The said condition, i.e. clause 14 was in the following terms:-

“14. ARBITRATION
In the event of any dispute arising
out of or in relation to this Agreement it shall
be decided by arbitration in accordance with
the British Arbitration Act 1950 or any
statutory
modification
or
re-enactment
thereof.”
3.

The plaintiff avers that it had been asked to resolve

serious disputes by M/s. Henry Simon Ltd. with M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd.,
regarding supply of plant and equipments to the latter. M/s.Asia Ahar
Ltd. had filed a Suit being No.873/1988 on the file of this Court.
M/s. Henry Simon Ltd. had been injuncted from re-exporting or
re-selling their machinery in the proceedings.

The plaintiff, it is

claimed with considerable effort, resolved the dispute.
4.

On 1.2.1989, the said two parties i.e. M/s. Henry Simon

Ltd. and Ms.Asia Ahar Ltd. entered into a fresh agreement.

The

plaintiff signed the said agreement as agent of the Seller. However,
the terms of the said document do not cast any obligation or create
any rights in favour of the plaintiff.
CS(OS) 213-A/97

This agreement contained an
2 of 18

arbitration clause in the following terms:-

ARBITRATION
In the case of any dispute of
whatsoever nature between the parties in
respect of any matter relating to or arising out
of this Agreement and/or interpretation of any
Clause of this Agreement it shall be referred
to arbitration under the rules and regulations
of the International Chamber of Commerce.”
“22.

5.

It is alleged that serious problems constantly arose in

concerning execution of the agreement with M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd. and
commissioning of the plant supplied by M/s. Henry Simon Ltd. The
plaintiff claims to have expended its efforts as well as money for
settling those disputes. Eventually M/s. Henry Simon Ltd. received
the full payment for the plant and equipments supplied to M/s.Asia
Ahar Ltd.

The plaintiff alleges that repeated assurances were held

out regarding payment of its commission, by M/s.Henry Simon Ltd.
6.

After the aforesaid event, i.e., the agreement between

M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd. and M/s.Henry Simon Ltd, the defendant No.1, i.e.
Robinson Milling System Ltd. succeeded to the assets and liabilities of
the M/s.Henry Simon Ltd.

The Defendant No.1 later amalgamated

with the B.M.Group, defendant No.3.

The defendant No.3 is the

successor of the said Robinson Milling System Ltd..
7.

The plaintiff avers that asking its principal, i.e. M/s.Henry

Simon Ltd. later succeeded to by Robinson Milling System Ltd. for
payment

of

CS(OS) 213-A/97

the

commission.

However,

the

commission

and
3 of 18

outstanding to the tune of U.K. Stg. Pounds 72,227/- for the period
February, 1989 to February, 1992 was unpaid. It is further averred
that on 2.10.1991, an agreement was arrived at between the
defendant No.1, i.e. Robinson Milling System Ltd. and the plaintiff
that in the event of any dispute in relation to their agreement, the
same would be referred to arbitration.

That agreement is in the

following terms:-

“ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
We confirm and put our signature, that in case
of any dispute, where matter involves any
claim or payment in reference to the supply of
food processing equipment for the said plant
to Asia Ahar Limited at 7/35, Ansari Road,
Daryaganj, New Delhi – 110 002, India as per
agreement of 01.02.1989. The matter will be
referred for Arbitration as per the agreement
clause arbitration No.22 which will be
subjected to the Jurisdiction of High Court,
New Delhi, India, and accept the arbitrators
Mr.L.K.Bajala & Mr.A.Sarin, Advocate of
Supreme Court of India, New Delhi, India, and
accept the arbitrators Mr.L.K.Bajala &
Mr.A.Sarin, Advocate of Supreme Court of
India, New Delhi. Such arbitration shall be
governed by Indian Arbitration Act, 1940 or
any modification or enactment, thereof for the
time being in force.
Yours sincerely,
for ROBINSON MILLING
SYSTEMS LTD.

Yours sincerely,
for
Hi-TECH
SYSTEM

(S.M. COWLES)
Commercial Manager.

(DR.A.S.BINDRA)
Chairman.”

8.

It is further averred that the plaintiff unavailingly sought

for recovery of amounts on various dates and issued a legal notice on
22.1.1994 containing the details of the sums due.

Consequently, it

caused a demand on 1.2.1995 to be issued to Defendant No.2 calling
it to concur the appointment of the named Arbitrator. The plaintiff
seeks adjudication of the following disputes:-

“13.... a) Whether M/s.Hi Tech System
entitled for payment of Stg. Pound 137920.00
(One Lac thirty seven thousand nine hundred
and twenty), from your company. Robinson
Milling System Ltd. (of BM group, BM House,
Avon Rech chippenham wilts SN15-IEE U.K.
Tel.No. 0249-656263 as claimed by Hi-Tech
System.
b)
Whether Hi-Tech system is entitled
for interest 24% per annum, on the due
amount since the day it fell due and till its
realisation from Robinson Milling System Ltd.
of BM Group U.K.”
9.

The Defendant No.3, in its reply, has disputed the

existence of the arbitration clause; it further disputes maintainability
of these proceedings on the ground that M/s.Hi Tech System is
neither a juristic person nor a legal entity entitled to file a petition
under Sections 8 and 20 of the Arbitration Act.

It is alleged that

plaintiff was not a party to the agreement between M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd.
and M/s.Henry Simon Ltd. dated 1.2.1989 in which the arbitration
clause was contained in paragraph 22.

It is further alleged that

agreement dated 2.10.1991 was signed both by Robinson Milling
CS(OS) 213-A/97

5 of 18

System Ltd. and the plaintiff in order to re-assure M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd.
that the agent of Robinson Milling System Ltd. would be bound by the
arbitration clause No.22 of the Agreement dated 1.2.1989.

2.10.1991

clause 14 of the agreement contract dated 4.2.1988 adverts to
arbitration between the parties in accordance with the British
(English) Arbitration Act, 1950 or any statutory modification or reenactment thereof. The defendants also object to the maintainability
of the proceedings on the ground of the claims and the petition under
Section 20 being time barred.
12.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff relied upon the various

stipulations

relating to the primary obligations

in support of

M/s.Hi-Tech System – the plaintiff. The plaintiff performed its part of
the function in resolving disputes with M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd. Although
the initial arbitration clause, i.e. clause 14 in the original agreement

CS(OS) 213-A/97

6 of 18

dated 4.2.1988 adverted to the resolution of disputes through the
English Arbitration Act, that had to be seen in the light of the
subsequent event under the Agreement dated 2.10.1991.
13.

Learned counsel submitted that the petitioner's agency

was part of assets and liabilities of its principal, i.e. M/s.Henry Simon
Ltd.

succeeded

to

by

M/s.Robinson

Milling

System

Ltd.

and

subsequently by defendant No.3. All these entities were duly bound
to honour terms of the agency agreement dated 4.2.1988 under which
the plaintiff was entitled to commission. Counsel explained that on
1.2.1989, the agreement entered into between M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd. and
M/s.Henry Simon Ltd. was in the background of their previous inter se
dispute.

Clause 22 of that Agreement referred to resolution of

disputes inter se between those contracting parties.

They did not

assign any role to the petitioner nor saddle it with responsibility.
Counsel further submitted that the dispute raised by the petitioner
does not seek filing of the arbitration agreement in view of clause 14.
However, according to counsel, the subsequent agreement dated
2.10.1991 executed by Robinson Milling System Ltd. has altered the
picture and changed the situation radically.
14.

The said Agreement virtually ratified the contract between

the plaintiff and M/s.Henry Simon Ltd.

In so far as mechanism of

arbitration is concerned, learned counsel contended that clause 14 of

CS(OS) 213-A/97

7 of 18

the first agreement dated 4.2.1988 is within the framework of Indian
law through nominated arbitrators.

Counsel contended that the

reference to M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd was a specific recognition and that
parties were conscious as to the nature of the pending dispute and no
more.
15.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff relied upon the legal

notice dated 22.1.1994 and the demand for arbitration made on
1.2.1995 to submit that the present proceedings are within the period
of limitation. According to the counsel, the period in respect of which
the commission is pending and payable by the defendants, (now
defendant No.3), is February 1989 to February, 1992; a demand was
made on 10.7.1992. The respondent denied the liability on 23.7.1992.
He relied upon the copies of the said letter dated 23.7.1992 and
stated that the cause of action in respect of the outstanding amounts
accrued on the receipt of that letter.

According to counsel, the

demand for arbitration fixed the period of limitation in terms of
Section 37(3) of the Act; this was made on 1.2.1995. So reckoned the
present proceedings were within the period of limitation as the suit
was filed in December, 1996.
16.

Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the

present proceedings are not maintainable because the petitioner has
not disclosed its locus standi as well as the authority of the person

CS(OS) 213-A/97

8 of 18

said to be competent to initiate the present proceedings. He relied
upon the judgment of this Court reported as M/s.Nibro Ltd. vs.

National Insurance Co. Ltd., AIR 1991 DELHI 25, for the
proposition that under Order 29 Rule 1 of Civil P.C., a Corporation
can be said to have properly filed a suit or instituted a proceeding in
terms of Section 291 of the Companies Act which expressly provides
that powers in respect of a particular matter are to be exercised by
the company and though specifically conferred power on a Director.
It was, therefore, submitted that the present proceeding supported by
the affidavit of one of the Directors of M/s.Hi-Tech System, without
further material particulars, is not maintainable.
17.

Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the

disputes sought to be referred to arbitration are clearly time barred.
The cause of action if at all arose sometime in 1989 and the period for
which the amounts were payable concerned to 1989 to February,
1992.

The present proceedings under Section 20 were filed in

December, 1996. In these circumstances, the petition itself was time
barred.

Kerala

He relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in The

State

Electricity

Board,

T.P.Kunhaliumma, (1976) 4 SCC 634.

Trivandrum

vs.

The Court held in that

decision that Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 applies in respect
of all proceedings where period of limitation is not provided

CS(OS) 213-A/97

9 of 18

specifically for.

Counsel contends that the said provision expressly

adverts to “application”, under Section 20, the present proceedings
are also in reality in the nature of application and are, therefore,
squarely covered by its provisions.
18.

Learned counsel reiterated the submissions made by

defendant No.3 in its counter affidavit. He adverted to clause 14 of
the Agreement between M/s.Henry Simon Ltd., i.e. the original
principal of the plaintiff and the latter to submit that the mechanism
provided for admittedly was arbitration in accordance with the
provisions of British (English) Arbitration Act or any other law in its
substitution.
19.

Counsel submitted that without prejudice to the other

submissions if at all there is an arbitration clause that is clause 14 of
the first Agreement.

Having regard to the nature of the condition,

this Court cannot entertain the present petition.
20.

Learned counsel next contended that the letter dated

2.10.1991 cannot be treated as an arbitration agreement, since it was
more in the nature of the letter of comfort or confirmation, vis-a-vis.,
M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd. He relied upon the form of the said document and
submitted that it uses the expression such as “yours sincerely”.
Counsel also stated that the document was executed because
M/s.Robinson Milling System Ltd. had come into the picture after the

CS(OS) 213-A/97

10 of 18

agreement between M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd. and M/s.Henry Simon Ltd. had
been executed earlier on 1.2.1989.

The object and intention of the

parties to the document was to assure that

M/s.Robinson Milling

System Ltd. would be also bound by clause 22 of the arbitration
Agreement and would abide by the agreement to refer disputes
between M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd. and itself in the event of their being
raised in arbitration.
21.

Accordingly, three questions arise for determination in

these proceedings:1. Whether the present proceeding is not maintainable for the
reason that it is not instituted properly?
2. Whether the petition is time barred?
3. Whether the document dated 2.10.1991 can be said to have
been arbitration agreement and filed as such under Section 8 &
20 of the Act?

22.

So far as the first objection is concerned, counsel relied

upon the provisions of Order 29 of Code of Civil Procedure. A plain
reading of that provision as indeed the judgment of this Court in
M/s.Nibro Ltd. v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., AIR 1991 DELHI
25, would indicate that it applies to cases of artificial personalities or
juristic persons such as Companies.

CS(OS) 213-A/97

Indeed the facts of M/s.Nibro

11 of 18

Ltd.(supra) concerned a company incorporated under the Companies
Act. However, that is not the case here. The plaintiff described itself
as a unit of M/s.Hindustan Live Stock Sales. There is no averment by
the

either

party

that

said

corporation

or

indeed

the

plaintiff – M/s.Hi-Tech System is an incorporated Company or an
artificial or juristic entity. The suit is supported by the affidavit of one
Col. Bir Singh who described as a Director. It is stated in the suit
itself that the said Director is duly authorized to present the
proceeding under Section 20.

In these circumstances, I am of the

opinion that there is no merit in the first objection made by
respondent No.3.
23.

As far as the second question is concerned, in view of the

judgment of the Supreme Court, there cannot be any controversy that
Article 137 of the Limitation Act applies to all applications and
proceedings

which

are

not

necessarily

suits,

commonly

we

understood. Thus, the said provision which enacts the period of three
years for presentation of applications would be equally applicable to
proceedings under Section 20. The question, however, is whether the
present Section 20 of the suit is being barred. The suit was filed on
21.12.1996. According to the averments, particularly, paragraph 10,
the amounts are

outstanding and payable to the plaintiff for the

period February, 1989 to February, 1992. Other documents placed on

CS(OS) 213-A/97

12 of 18

record include a copy of the refusal by the defendant through its
letter dated 23.7.1992. It adverts to a request for release of payment
dated 10.7.1992. Thus, if one were to apply the parameters of Article
137 of the Limitation Act, the right to apply would accrue from the
date of refusal, i.e. 23.7.1992. The plaintiff demanded the amounts
through its legal notice dated 22.1.1994.

Upon allegedly not

receiving any response, it claimed arbitration on 1.2.1995.
24.

Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, so far as it is relevant for

the purpose of deciding these issues reads as follows:-

37. Limitations.-(1) All the provisions of
the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 (9 of 1908),
shall apply to arbitrations as they apply to
proceedings in Court.
(2) Notwithstanding any term in an
arbitration agreement to the effect that no
cause of action shall accrue in respect of any
matter required by the agreement to be
referred until an award is made under the
agreement, a cause of action shall, for the
purpose of limitation, be deemed to have
accrued in respect of any such matter at the
time when it would have accrued but for that
term in the agreement.
(3) For the purposes of this section and of
the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 ( 9 of 1908),
an arbitration shall be deemed to be
commenced when one party to the arbitration
agreement served on the other parties thereto
a notice requiring the appointment of an
arbitrator,
or
where
the
arbitration
agreement provides that the reference shall
be to a person named or designated in the
agreement requiring that the difference be

submitted to
designated.
25.

the

person

so

named

or

From a textual reading of Section 37(3), it is evident that

the arbitration is deemed to have commenced when one party serves
on the other a notice requiring appointment of an arbitrator. In this
case, such a demand/notice dated 1.2.1995 has been placed on record.
In such circumstances, the failure of the defendants to agree to
arbitration is really the occasion for the plaintiff approaching this
Court, it did so in December, 1996. The period of limitation described
under Article 137 is three years. The plaintiff, in the opinion of this
Court, had approached this Court within that period. The objection of
the defendants in this Court is, therefore, rejected as unmerited.
26.

This brings me to the main dispute. The plaintiff asserts

that the parties are bound by an arbitration agreement which should
be filed in this Court.

The defendant refutes this and states that if

there is an arbitration agreement, it is embodied

the clause 14 of

original agreement, that cannot be filed.
27.

Having regard to its tenor, this Court does not possess

jurisdiction in terms of original Clause 14 of the agreement as English
Law would apply. It is well settled that while interpreting documents,
the Court not only has to read the specific condition but also the
context in which obligations are cast by either of the contracting party
upon the other, and gather their overall intentions.
CS(OS) 213-A/97

Now, a plain
14 of 18

reading of the clause 14 undoubtedly supports the defendant's
contentions that disputes arising in relation to the agency of the
plaintiff were to be referred for arbitration under the English Law.
Had the matter remained thus, this petition would not have been
maintainable.

However, the plaintiff's case is that its efforts in

resolving certain previous disputes led to M/s.Henry Simon Ltd.
entering into an agreement with M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd. on 1.2.1989. That
document is part of the record. It cannot be anybody's case that the
plaintiff was a party to it, in the sense that no obligations or rights or
liabilities were cast upon it.

Undoubtedly, someone on its behalf

affirmed the document and signed it.
involvement.

But that is the extent of its

The content of that Agreement is the contractual

relationship between M/s.Henry Simon Ltd. and M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd.
Now, apparently after the execution of that document, the plaintiff's
payment allegedly remained over due on account of the transaction
with M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd.
28.

Sometime, after 1.2.1989, M/s.Robinson Milling System

Ltd. came into the picture and stepped into the shoes of the original
principal, i.e. M/s.Henry Simon Ltd.
agreement/letter

It was on that stage, the

dated 2.10.1991 was executed.

In order to

understand the dispute, it would be better to set out contention of the
defendants. The defendant's position here is the said document dated

CS(OS) 213-A/97

15 of 18

2.10.1991 did not, in any manner, alter the arbitration agreement
between the agent and its principal, i.e. M/s.Henry Simon Ltd.
(succeeded to by M/s.Robinson Milling System Ltd. and now by
defendant No.3); it continues to be the same. Its explanation about
the document i.e. 2.10.1991 that the parties meant to re-assure
M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd. that the arbitration clause contained in the
agreement with M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd. would continue to be binding upon
the parties to the letter dated 2.10.1991.

As observed earlier, the

plaintiff was not required to perform any act or obligation under the
agreement between M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd. and M/s.Henry Simon Ltd. In
other words, there was no privity of contract between the two. The
agreement was entered into between the principal and its customers,
i.e. M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd.

If these essentials are kept in mind, the

defendant's submission would immediately stand exposed.
29.

Now, if the intention of the parties was to retain the

original arbitration clause, vis-a-vis the plaintiff, i.e. clause 14, there
was no need for the parties for executing the letter dated 2.10.1991.
Nor is there any merit in the submission that the letter of 2.10.1991
was to re-assure M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd., i.e. consumer or the customer of
the plaintiff's principal about the plaintiff's involvement in it. In fact,
the arbitration agreement or arrangement contemplated in this
letter/document dated 2.10.1991 is at variance in all significant

CS(OS) 213-A/97

16 of 18

particulars. Clause 22 of the agreement dated 1.2.1989, i.e. between
M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd and M/s.Henry Simon Ltd. adverts to arbitration
through the International Chamber of Commerce.

However, the

arbitration adverted to in the subsequent document of 2.10.1991 does
not even mention arbitration through the International Chamber of
Commerce. It nominated two arbitrators. It is inconceivable that the
party who was bound by the arbitration agreement, i.e. M/s.Asia Ahar
Ltd. is “deemed” to be bound by a condition to which it is not even a
signatory as is the position with the document dated 2.10.1991.
30.
that

In view of the above reasoning, this Court is of the opinion
the

letter/agreement

dated

2.10.1991,

though

inelegantly

expressed was made to convey the intention of M/s.Robinson Milling
System Ltd. which had stepped into the shoes of M/s.Henry Simon Ltd.
that it was willing to refer disputes between it and the plaintiff
through arbitration (concerning amounts or disputes in regard to the
contract with M/s.Asia Ahar Ltd.) apparently so far as the rival claims
and counter claims on that account were concerned. If this is not the
true purport and meaning, the reason for execution of the agreement
would itself cease.
31.

In view of the above conclusion, this Court is of the

opinion that the arbitration agreement dated 2.10.1991 has to be
filed.

In view of the above conclusions, the disputes raised by the
