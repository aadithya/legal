1.

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
Sumeet Maan and Sandeep Maan are brothers. On

9.7.2003 Sandeep Maan was driving a motorcycle bearing No.
DL-8SW-5415. Sumeet was the pillion rider.

2.

When they reached old G.T.Road, a bus bearing No.

DL-1PA-0363 hit the motorcycle.

Both brothers suffered

injuries. Both had to be hospitalized.
3.

Since the two brothers are dissatisfied with the

claims granted to them by the learned Tribunal, I need to note
the facts which are relevant to assess a fair compensation to be
paid to the two brothers.
4.

Sandeep has been awarded a total compensation of

Rs.2,20,024/-. The break up is as under:(a)

Medical reimbursement

(b)

.....

Loss of earnings

Rs.1,75,024/.....

Rs.

15,000/(c)

Towards pain and suffering .....

Rs. 10,000/-

(d)

Special diet and
conveyance charges

Rs. 20,000/-

5.

Sumeet has been awarded a compensation in sum of

....

Rs.1,55,876/-. The break up is as under:(a)

Medical reimbursement

(b)

....

Loss of earnings

Rs.1,17,126/....

Rs.

8,750/(c)

Towards pain and suffering ....

(d)

Special diet and
conveyance charges
....
Rs. 20,000/In respect of medical costs reimbursed to the two

6.

Rs. 10,000/-

brothers, learned counsel for the appellant made a vague

attempt to urge that complete reimbursement has not been
effected.
7.

However, the argument was abandoned mid way for

the reason, it was noted that certain bills were highly doubtful.
8.

Learned counsel fairly conceded that in view of

testimony of PW-3, the so-called bills which were typed on the
letter head of Sant Parmanand Hospital, Shyam Nath Marg were
rightly ignored by the Tribunal.
9.

Learned counsel thus, restricted his submissions

under only two heads.
10.

Firstly, counsel urged that reimbursement for loss of

wages was inadequate. Secondly, amounts paid towards pain
and suffering was stated to be inadequate.
11.

Qua Sandeep Maan, counsel urged that evidence

establishes that he was hospitalized thrice.

Firstly from

9.7.2003 to 19.7.2003. Secondly, for 7 days in the month of
September 2003 and lastly for 5 days in the months of May
2004. Pertaining to Sumeet, counsel urged that Sumeet was
hospitalized for 10 days.

12.

It was urged that both brothers suffered extensive

fractures and ever after discharge from hospital had to undergo
physiotherapy.

They remained out of circulation for a long

time. Counsel submitted that Sandeep who was undergoing a
diploma course in public sanitation lost one year. As regards
Sumeet, counsel urged that he remained unemployed for
nearly a year.
13.

Sandeep has been recompensed Rs.15,000/- for loss

of one academic year.

Sumeet has been paid Rs.8,750/- as

notional loss of wages for 7 months unemployment.
14.

I do not find compensation assessed under this head

to both appellants as inadequate for the reason, due to losing
one academic year Sandeep would lose one year of gainful
employment.
15.

Learned Tribunal has awarded the loss of annual

wages specified in the 2nd Schedule to the MV Act 1988.
16.

I questioned learned counsel for the appellants

whether the two brothers have since gained any employment.
The answer was no.
17.
have

As regards Sumeet, noting that his injuries would
kept

him

immobile

for

7

months

he

has

been

recompensed 7 month notional wages. I find no infirmity in the
award in so far Sumeet has been recompensed loss of earning.
18.

Both brothers have been awarded Rs.10,000/- each

for pain and suffering.
19.

Sandeep's injuries are much graver. He had to be

hospitalized thrice for 10, 7 and 5 days respectively.
20.

Sumeet had to be hospitalized only once for 10 days.

21.

Injuries suffered by Sandeep are compound fractures

of the right femur bone, head injuries and injuries on the right
hand. Injuries suffered by Sumeet are fracture of the jaw, wrist
and right leg.
22.

Both brothers had to be operated, but Sandeep had

to be operated thrice. The operation on Sandeep show that the
femur bone was having a problem in healing.
23.

Surely, both brothers did not suffer same degree of

pain and agony. Sandeep's pain and agony is much more.
24.

Compensation to be assessed for pain and agony is

a vexed issue as hardly any objective criteria can be
crystallized.

Estimation of pain and suffering is bound to be

highly subjected. But, gravity of the injuries would be reflective
of the intense pain felt by the body.

Further, duration of

hospitalization would also indicate the pain and suffering.
25.

Total hospitalization suffered by Sandeep on the

three occasions is approximately 22 days. Thrice, surgery had
to be performed. Every surgery would be a painful experience.
The bones were not healing.

It is reflective of the damage

suffered by the bones.
26.

Rs.10,000/- awarded to Sandeep towards pain and

suffering is highly inadequate.
27.

In the report published as 2006 ACJ 1398 Oriental

Insurance Co. Vs. R.Swaminathan & Ors., for pain and suffering
undergone in respect of injuries which resulted in the
amputation of the right hand, compensation of Rs.1 lac was
upheld by the Supreme Court.
28.

Taking guidance therefrom, for pain and suffering of

Sandeep, Rs.50,000/- would be a fair compensation.
29.

For Sumeet, noting that his hospitalization was for

10 days and surgery had to be performed to straighten the
broken bones and thereafter a rod had to be inserted, a fair and
just compensation of Rs.25,000/- would suffice.
30.

The appeals stand disposed of enhancing the sum

awarded to Sandeep by further sum of Rs.40,000/- and to
Sumeet, enhancing the compensation by further sum of
Rs.15,000/-.
31.

Both

brothers

would

be

paid

the

enhanced

compensation with interest @ 6% per annum from date of the
claim petition till date of realization.
32.

No costs.
