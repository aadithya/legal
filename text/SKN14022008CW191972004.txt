ORDER
% 14.02.2008

1. The petitioner and the erstwhile Delhi Vidyut Board were involved in

several rounds of litigations in respect of electricity bills from 1987
onwards. In 1990 the petitioners herein had filed Civil Revision Nos.
719/1990 and 720/1990 in this court challenging interim orders passed
in civil suits. By an interim order dt.30.7.1990 certain directions in favour
of the petitioner were issued subject to the condition that in case the
revision petitions were dismissed the petitioners would be liable to pay
temporary electricity charges for consumption. It transpires that revision
petitions were dismissed on 13th March, 1996 by the High Court and the
impugned orders passed by the Civil Courts were upheld. While
dismissing the Revision Petition no specific direction was given by the
Court with regard to the payment of electricity charges in terms of the
Interim Order.
2. The petitioners herein also filed a writ petition being civil writ

no.1353/1993 challenging bill dt.5/7/93. This writ petition was disposed
of on 24th January, 1995 with the direction that entire matter would be
examined by Mr. Y.N. Reddy, Director (EDP) Delhi Vidyut Board.
3. Mr. Y. N. Reddy thereafter examined the entire matter and passed an

order dt.27/8/96. It can be presumed that when Mr. Y N Reddy had
passed the said order he was aware of the interim orders passed in Civil
Revision Nos. 719/1990 and 720/1990 and the fact that said civil

revisions had been dismissed. In fact, Mr. Y N Reddy, Director (EDP)
has

referred

to

the

fact

that

the

impugned

demand/bill

of

Rs.27,31,214.40 raised for the period 20.6.1987 to January, 1993 was
subject matter of dispute before him. It is not disputed that this order
passed on 27/8/1996 by Mr. Y. N. Reddy, Director (EDP) has been
accepted both by the petitioner as well as by DVB.
4. The dispute pertains to bills for the period from 1987 till 1996. DVB was

not able to recover the disputed amount from the petitioner. The
petitioner has already got an electricity connection pursuant to orders
passed by the Lok Adalat. The Reconciliatory authority consisting of two
retired Judges of this Court had also passed Order dated 18th April,
1998 in favour of the petitioner. The said Order was passed prior to
unbundling of DVB. Today DVB is represented by Delhi Power
Company Ltd and as per the Agreement between GNCTD and the
distribution companies, arrears for the period prior to unbundling, on
recovery have to be distributed between the discom and Delhi Power
Company Ltd. in the ratio of 20% and 80% respectively.
5. Keeping in view the above facts I feel it will be appropriate in case the

DPCL prepares a fresh bill in consultation with the NDPL to comply with
the last paragraph of the order dt.27th August, 1996 passed by Mr. Y. N.
Reddy, Director (EDP) which reads as under :

“The bill from 01.08.90 till date be prepared as per the
orders of the Hon'ble High Court dated 13.3.1996
according to the tariff in force and commercial orders
on the subject.”
6. In case the petitioner is entitled to benefit of late payment surcharge

under any policy the same shall also be considered by the respondent
DPCL and NDPL. Reduction or exemption from late payment surcharge
may be justified in the present case in view of the period of default
which relates to the period prior to 1996 and the fact that the
Government has been coming out with LPS waiver schemes. The
petitioner will be given credit of the amount which may have been paid
by him for this period. The aforesaid exercise will be completed by the
respondents within a period of one month from today and a proposed
bill will be sent to the petitioner who will be entitled to give his comments
within a period of 2 weeks. Thereafter a speaking order will be passed
by DPCL and final bill will be raised. It will be also open to the parties to
settle the matter amicably through negotiations.
7. The writ petition is accordingly disposed of with the right to the petitioner

to approach this Court once again in case he is not satisfied with the
speaking order/final bill. In case the petitioner does not make payment,
the respondent will be free to proceed in accordance with law.
