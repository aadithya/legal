1.

The petitioner was running a 19-room hotel, known as

Hotel President, at Asaf Ali Road, New Delhi. The petitioner
was sanctioned a load of 110 KW by the Delhi Electric Supply
Undertaking ('DESU') a wing of Municipal Corporation of
Delhi ('MCD'), the respondent herein. With the unbundling of
the DESU the respondent MCD has, by an order of this Court
WP(C) 4478 of 1992

page no 1 of 9

dated 10.11.2005, been substituted by the BSES Yamuna
Power Limited.

2.

The petitioner's premises was inspected on 19.7.1990 by

a joint inspection team of enforcement which found the
following irregularities:

“(a) Large Industrial Power (LIP), since
the connected load was found to be
169.08 KW as against the sanctioned load
of 110 KW.

(b)

Low

Power

Factor

(LPF),

the

installed shunt capacitors of 3 x 8 KVAR
+ 15 KVAR were of inadequate capacity
vis-a-vis the connected load of 169.08
KW. The required capacity of the shunt
capacitor

has

to

be

1/3rd

of

the

connected load.

(c)

There was subletting on account of

the connection being used by M/s. Bhai
WP(C) 4478 of 1992

page no 2 of 9

Sunderdas and Sons Company (P) Ltd.,
also in addition to the same connection
being used for different floors of Hotel
President.”

3.

The copy of the inspection report (which has been

annexed by the petitioner as Annexure 'I' to this writ petition)
was signed by the representative of the petitioner, Mr.Kuljeet
Singh, as well as by each of the members of the inspection
team.

The remarks in the inspection report read: “shunt

capacitor 3 x 8 KVAR,

15KVAR found installed (ii) There is

(sic) two sources supply from different sources through
change over switch which is duly sealed by MTD Department.”

4.

Consequent upon the above inspection, on 2.9.1992 a

letter was addressed to the petitioner by DESU stating that
misuse of electricity by the petitioner,

as found during the

inspection, would attract surcharge/higher tariff and further
that

“unless

and

until

sufficient

evidence/proof

to

the

satisfaction of DESU is made available to substantiate
otherwise without prejudice to our right to take further action
for disconnection of the supply under Clause 7(2)/7(4) and/or
WP(C) 4478 of 1992

page no 3 of 9

7(6) of the order ibid.” The said letter further required the
petitioner

to

remove

the

excess

load

and/or

misuse,

provide/maintain shunt capacitor of adequate capacity so as to
keep the power factor not below .85 lagging and bring down
your load within the sanctioned limited.”

The petitioner

replied to this letter dated 10.9.1992 denying both the misuse
as well as the subletting.

The petitioner further maintained

that there was no excess load and that there was no change in
the user.

5.

On 7.10.1992 the petitioner was issued a show cause

notice

for

the

levy

of

surcharge

on

account

of

load

violation/misuse of supply/non-installation of shunt capacitor.
Notice further stated that a bill would be raised w.e.f. July,
1989 by revising the applicable tariff.

6.

At this stage, the petitioner filed the present writ petition

on 18.12.1992 challenging, inter alia, the said letter dated
2.9.1992 and notice dated 7.10.1992 issued to it by DESU. On
21.12.1992 this Court directed notice to issue in the writ
petition and passed an interim order staying the disconnection
of electricity at the petitioner's premises at 4/238, Asaf Ali
WP(C) 4478 of 1992

page no 4 of 9

Road, New Delhi on the condition that the petitioner should
pay a sum of Rs.80,000/- on or before 24.12.1992. Thereafter,
numerous

interim

orders

were

passed

permitting

the

petitioner to make ad hoc payments against the bills raised
including misuser charges. On 5.5.1993 it was noticed by this
Court that no reply had been filed by the respondent and a
direction was given that “henceforth the respondent shall not
charge low tension charges, load violation charges and low
power factor surcharge from the petitioner.”

7.

On 29.9.1993 since no reply had yet been filed by the

respondent, this Court issued Rule and confirmed the interim
orders made earlier.

This Court further directed that

“henceforth, the respondent shall not charge misuse charges
from the petitioner.”

8.

Pursuant to the substitution of BSES Yamuna Power

Limited as a respondent, a counter affidavit has been filed by
the said substituted respondent.

9.

Mr. S.C. Nigam, learned counsel for the petitioner

submits that none of the three reasons pointed out by the
WP(C) 4478 of 1992

page no 5 of 9

respondent is tenable for coming to a conclusion about the
misuser of electricity by the petitioner. As regards the shunt
capacitor requiring to be placed, a reference is made to a
letter dated 12.4.1990 written by the petitioner informing
DESU that it had installed the “40 KVAR capacitor so as to
keep the power frequency above .85.” This is also, according
to the petitioner, verified by an expert. As regards the charge
that

the connected load of 169.08 kw was in excess of the

sanctioned load of 110 KW, it is submitted that nothing has
been shown by the respondent to indicate the basis on which
such

conclusion was drawn. Thirdly, it is denied that there

was any “subletting” as alleged. It is submitted that since the
petitioner is the owner of the property and the Director of
Hotel President where this electricity connection has been
installed by the DESU, there was no question of subletting.

10. In reply, Ms. Veronica Mohan, learned counsel appearing
for the BSES Rajdhani Power Limited points out that the
petitioner in its letter dated 10.9.1992 did not dispute either
the fact of the inspection having been carried out or the facts
recorded in the inspection report. While, it is not denied that
a shunt capacitor was fixed by the petitioner, it was not of an
WP(C) 4478 of 1992

page no 6 of 9

appropriate capacity considering that the connected load was
of 169.08 KW. This would require a shunt capacitor of at least
60 KVAR, whereas the shunt capacitor installed by the
petitioner was only upto

39 KVAR.

Even on the issue of

subletting, it is pointed out that there was no denial by the
petitioner as such. It is pointed out that in rejoinder affidavit
the petitioner has stated that “the electricity is being used by
the same persons who besides being the owners of the
property are also being business in the name of Bhai Sundar
Das & Sons Co. (P) Ltd. and Hotel President.”

11. After considering the facts of the case, the documents on
record as well as the submission of learned counsel for the
parties, this Court finds that the petitioner has not really
brought on record anything concrete to dispute the factual
position of misuse of electricity as is evident from the
inspection report dated 9.7.1992. This report was prepared in
the presence of the petitioner.

There were two electricity

connections on the premises in question and it was found that
the shunt capacitor installed was not appropriate for the
connected load of the premises. The petitioner has not been
able to show that the inspection report is either erroneous or
WP(C) 4478 of 1992

page no 7 of 9

perverse or activated by ulterior motives so as to enable the
Court to take a different view of the matter. In fact, there is
nothing whatsoever to doubt the genuineness of the inspection
conducted by the respondent or the report prepared pursuant
thereto. In that view of the matter, it is difficult for this Court
to take a contrary view and hold that letter dated 2.9.1992,
which is also consequent to the said inspection, suffers from
illegality.

12. The Respondent is right in contending that the Petitioner
does not in fact deny either that the shunt capacitor was
inadequate or that the connected load was more than the
sanctioned load. Even on subletting, the submission in the
rejoinder is that the petitioner is also doing business “in the
name of Bhai Sundar Das & Sons Co.(P) Ltd. and Hotel
President”. This indicates that the present petitioner [Bhai
Investment

(P)

Limited]

was

a

separate

identity

and

probabilises the fact of sub-letting.
13. On a conspectus of the facts of the case, there is no
illegality in the determination by the respondent of the
misuser of the electricity by the petitioner.

The restricted

scope of judicial review in such matters limits the power of
WP(C) 4478 of 1992

page no 8 of 9

interfering with the decision sought to be reviewed on grounds
of either procedural irregularity that has caused irreversible
prejudice or on substantive grounds of irrationality or
perversity.

Neither grounds have been made out by the

petitioner in the instant case.

14. The writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed. All interim
orders stand vacated.

15. Petition and all pending applications stand disposed of.
