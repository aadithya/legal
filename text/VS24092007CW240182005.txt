VIPIN SANGHI, J.
1.

Petitioner has, by way of this petition, impugned the

order dated 30.5.2003 passed by the Principal Bench of Central
Administrative

Tribunal

(Tribunal

for

short)

in

O.A.

No.2072/2002 whereby the original application filed by the
petitioner came to be dismissed.
2.

Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner was

W.P. (C) No. 24018/2005

Page 1 of 10

appointed in North-East Railway division with Respondent No.3
on 16.7.1962 as apprentice mechanical. He was promoted to
the post of Charge man w.e.f. 22.7.1964. Petitioner continued
to work there till 29.4.1977. Pursuant to advertisement dated
2.4.1976 issued by Respondent No.4 (NCERT)advertising the
vacancy to the post of Technical Officer, the petitioner applied
for the said post. Petitioner states that his application for the
said post was routed through proper channel. On his selection
the petitioner resigned from his services with Railways on
18.1.1977 citing personal reasons as the cause for such
resignation. As per petitioner, instead of seeking permission to
join the NCERT he tendered his resignation in accordance with
the advise received by him from the Senior officials, with a
view to save time and formalities, since he had to join his new
employment within a limited time. He was ultimately relieved
on 24.4.1977 and paid an amount of Rs.4663/- as P.F.
3.

On 19.1.1989 the petitioner wrote to the NCERT

claiming prorata pension for his past service with the Railways.
In its letter dated 21.6.1995 the respondent No.3 i.e. the Chief
Works Manager (P) of the Railways stated that the liability
towards pro-rata pension gratuity is being worked out and the
amount would be transferred to NCERT as soon as possible.
W.P. (C) No. 24018/2005

Consequently, there was no denial, in principle, of the right of
the petitoner to seek pro rata pension. On 5.12.1996 another
letter was sent by the respondent No.3 to NCERT informing it of
the excess payment of Rs.1300.99 paid to the petitioner and
informing it that the said amount would have to be deposited
by the petitioner along with interest “so that his services can
be transferred to your department.”
4.

On 15.1.1997, the petitioner deposited Rs.1300.00

with the respondent No.3. A further amount of Rs.35,293.00
was deposited on 27.2.1997 in lieu of Rs.4,663.00 received by
the petitioner towards P.F., along with interest thereon. On
24.4.1997 NCERT informed the respondent No.3 of the steps
taken in compliance of their instructions and requested for
transfer

of

the

money

towards

pro-rata

pension.

On

21.10.2000, NCERT sent reminder to the respondent No.3
requesting for immediate action for transfer of pro-rata pension
to NCERT as done earlier in the case of another person viz. Mr.
D.P. Toor.
5.

By letter dated 5.3.2001, the claim of the petitioner

was rejected. Petitioner sent a representation against the said
decision on 17.6.2001. Thereafter, repeated reminders were
sent to the respondent No.3 but to no avail.

In

this

background,

the

aforesaid

Original

Application No.2072/2002 was preferred praying for grant of
prorata pensionary benefit.
7.

The tribunal relying on the decision of the Apex

Court in Krishan Kumar v. Union of India, (1990) 4 SCC
207 concluded that the petitioner failed to exercise the option
to

avail

pro-rata

pensionary

benefit

even

though

an

opportunity had come his way in 1999 vide OM dated
19.10.1999. The tribunal further held that the absorption of the
petitioner was not in public interest, he having resigned from
service of his own volition

for personal reasons. On these

grounds the claim of the petitioner was rejected and the OA
dismissed.
8.

Before us, the petitioner has assailed the order

passed by the tribunal in the ground that it has been passed
without appreciating the material brought on record, in
particular,

the

communications

exchanged

between

the

parties, which shows that petitioners case for grant of pro-rata
pension was under consideration even in the year 1995 and
upto the year 2000. The petitioner had also deposited the
amount received as PF with interest thereon with the
respondents. As far as exercising the option to obtain prorata
W.P. (C) No. 24018/2005

Page 4 of 10

pensionary benefit was concerned, the same had been
exercised by the petitioner way back in November 1988.
Therefore, as per the petitioner, the Tribunal was wrong in
concluding that the petitioner failed to opt for grant of pro-rata
pension even when the time was extended by the OM of 1999.
9.

The counsel for the petitioner relies upon K.K. Dhir

v. Union of India & Ors, 135 (2006) DLT 300 (DB) where the
entitlement to pro rata pensionary benefit has been upheld by
this court to persons who had moved to PSU's of their own
volition. This court had held that since the Government had
relaxed the various conditions of eligibility for admission to prorata pensionary benefit by various OMs by fixing cut off
date(s), which have no rational basis, these relaxation would
be applicable to all Government servants who had 10 years or
more of qualifying service before they moved to PSU's either
on transfer/deputation, or of their own volition, whether or not
a declaration of their move being in Public Interest existed. He
thus, submits that his case is covered on all fours by this
decision and the petition ought to be allowed.
10.

The respondent No.3, per contra, raised an objection

that the resignation of the petitioner does not disclose that he
resigned for the purpose of joining NCERT and therefore, it
W.P. (C) No. 24018/2005

Page 5 of 10

could not be said that the petitioner applied for the post in
NCERT through proper channel. Reliance has been placed on
para 6 of an OM dated 29th August 1984 to contend that where
an employee had secured employment directly and

not

through proper channel with proper permission, he was not
entitled

to

pro

rata

pension

for

his

service

with

the

Government. The same reads as follows:-

“These orders will be applicable only where
the transfer of the employee from one
organization to another was/is with the
consent of the organization under which he
was serving earlier, including cases where
the individual ha secured employment
directly on his own volition, provided he had
applied through proper channel/with proper
permission of the administrative authority
concerned.”
11.

As far as the finding of the tribunal on the aspect of

making of an application for the grant of said benefit is
concerned, we find on record sufficient material to negate the
conclusion arrived at by the Tribunal as erroneous. It may be
pointed out that the correspondence relied upon by the
petitioner, which we have taken note of earlier, has not been
denied by the respondent. The entire correspondence clearly
indicates that the petitioner had applied way back in the year
1988 and his case for grant of pro rata pension was under
W.P. (C) No. 24018/2005

Page 6 of 10

active consideration throughout since 19.1.1988 and up till its
ultimate rejection in the year 2001. Hence, there was no need
for him to apply afresh in the year 1999.

12.

Coming now to the other contention. It is not in

dispute that the petitioner applied for the post in NCERT
through proper channel. This is evident from para 4 of the
counter affidavit of Shri Ratna Banerjee Sr. Personal Officer,
Mechanical Workshop, NER, Gorakhpur where she states
“However, it is submitted that the petitioner in so applying
stated in his letter dated 05.05.1976 that: “I will severe all my
connections from Railway if I am selected.”

13.

Merely because at the time of tendering his

resignation, he stated that his resignation was on personal
grounds, it cannot be said that the application was not routed
through proper channel. The fact that the Respondent No. 3
forwarded the application of the petitioner to NCERT in itself
contains the concurrence or 'No objections' of Respondent No.
3 to the petitioner migrating to NCERT.

If, thereafter, to be

able to join his services with the new employer within the time
limited in the offer of appointments, the petitioner merely
stated that he was resigning for personal reasons, that by itself
W.P. (C) No. 24018/2005

Page 7 of 10

would not disentitles him for prorata pensionary benefits. One
has also to take note of the fact that the petitioner had moved
to NCERT in the year 1977 when these notifications were not in
existence. To subsequently put conditions about the manner in
which the employee should

make the move from the

Government to the Central PSU, to be eligible to secure pro
rata pension, and to make them applicable to past cases would
not be reasonable. Such conditions could only have prospective
operation. Pension is not a bounty but a valuable right of the
employee and is payment for past services rendered by him.
14.

The Tribunal thus, erred on both these issues and

erroneously dismissed the OA preferred by the Petitioner.

15.

This leaves us with the claim of the Petitioner on merits.

The apex court in Praduman Kumar Jain vs. Union of India &
Ors.1994 (4) SLR 439 held that an employee who resigned from
Government service to join NTPC was entitled to the grant of prorata pensionary benefits. This court has in K.K. Dhir (supra) held
that the effect of various OMs relaxing the eligibility criteria for the
grant of pro-rata pensionary benefit has been that all employees
who had joined PSU's of their own volition or on deputation basis
were entitled to get pro-rata pensionary benefit whether or not, a
declaration of their joining the PSU being in Public interest was
W.P. (C) No. 24018/2005

Page 8 of 10

made.

16.

This court also held that no distinction could be drawn

between different employees merely on the basis of their date of
resignation from Government service/joining the PSUs and for the
purpose of grant of pro-rata pension all employees constituted one
class.

17.

In our view the ratio of the said case applies fully to

this case. Consequentially, we allow this petition and the
impugned order dated 30.5.2003 is quashed. The Respondents
are hereby directed to grant the benefit of pro-rata pension of
the service rendered by the petitioner with N.E. Railways
henceforth and pay the arrears of pension to him within three
months of passing of this order. If the arrears are not paid
within three months, the Petitioner would be entitled to interest
@ 6% p.a. thereafter. Parites are left to bear their respective
costs.
