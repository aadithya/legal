BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.

This petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and

Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the 'said Act') has been
filed challenging the Award made by the Arbitral Tribunal on 10.05.2007.

2.

By virtue of the impugned Award the petitioner's claim was

found to be barred by time. The Arbitral Tribunal referred to Chapter XI of
the bye-laws framed by the National Stock Exchange of India. The said
Chapter pertains to arbitration. Bye-law (3) of Chapter XI stipulates the
limitation period for reference of claims, differences or disputes for
arbitration. It stipulates that all claims, differences or disputes referred to in

OMP 445/2007

Page No.1 of 7

bye-laws (1), (1A), (1B) and (1D) shall be submitted to arbitration within
six months from the date on which the claim, difference or dispute arises or
is deemed to have been arisen.

It further provides that time taken in

conciliation proceedings, if any, initiated and conducted as per the
provisions of the said Act and the time taken by the Relevant Authority to
administratively resolve the claim, differences or disputes shall be excluded
for the purpose of determining the period of six months. The Arbitral
Tribunal took the view that transactions between the petitioner and the
respondent stopped on 01.04.2004 and that would be regarded as the
starting point of limitation. The Arbitral Tribunal expressed its opinion
that it cannot be believed that for more than two years a person would wait
and suddenly wake up with his claim as in this case. According to the
Arbitral Tribunal the period of six months had expired and therefore the
claim for arbitration could not be entertained. The Arbitral Tribunal was
also of the view that subsequent acknowledgment may extend the period of
limitation for the purposes of a civil suit under the Limitation Act, 1963 but
for the purposes of arbitration the period had already expired. The Arbitral
Tribunal also took the view that a clear distinction must be drawn between
the right of the claimant in a civil suit and the present proceedings. It was
observed that the arbitration proceedings under the bye-laws only bars the
remedy in these proceedings and does not take away the right to enforce the
same under the civil law in a court. Ultimately the Tribunal held that the
claim is time barred so far as the tribunal was concerned. They, however,
made it clear that nothing said in the Award would amount to any
expression of opinion pertaining to the disputes on merits of the matter and
OMP 445/2007

that nothing restrained the claimant to take his remedy before the civil court
in accordance with law because the period of limitation there is different.

3.

The learned counsel for the petitioner in his submissions has

assailed the impugned Award on primarily two grounds. The first ground
that was taken by the learned counsel was that the Arbitral Tribunal has
overlooked certain material documents, which, if considered, would bring
the petitioner's claim within the period prescribed by bye-law (3) of the said
bye-law. The second point urged on behalf of the petitioner was that the
provision of a reduced period of limitation compared to the period
prescribed under the Limitation Act, 1963 would be hit by the provisions of
Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The learned counsel appearing
on behalf of the respondent submitted that the Tribunal has correctly
understood the provisions and the factual situation and has taken the view
that the claim was time barred. He has also submitted that the computation
of the period of limitation has been appropriately done by the Arbitral
Tribunal.

On the second point urged by the learned counsel for the

petitioner, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that Section 28
of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 would not come in the way of the present
bye-law (3) inasmuch as Section 28 only refers to agreements between
parties and does not refer to statutory provisions. The period of limitation
prescribed under bye-law (3) would have to be regarded as statutory
provisions inasmuch as the bye-laws have been framed in exercise of the
powers granted to the National Stock Exchange under Section 9 of the
Securities Contract (Regulations) Act, 1956.

I have considered the submissions advanced by the learned

counsel for the parties. Insofar as the first point raised by the learned
counsel for the petitioner is concerned, I find that there is merit in what he
contends. To follow his contention, it would be necessary to set out the
chronology of events. It is an admitted position that after 01.04.2004 there
were no transactions between the parties. However, the learned counsel for
the petitioner has referred to a letter which is placed at page 23 of the paper
book and which also placed at pages 129 and 143 of the record of the
Arbitral Tribunal. The said document is a letter dated 31.03.2006 issued by
the respondent (Star Share & Stock Brokers Ltd.) to the petitioner in
connection with confirmation of the margin security deposit of Rs 20 lacs.
The said letter confirms that the margin / security deposit of Rs 20 lacs is
payable by the respondent (Star Share & Stock Brokers Ltd.) and will be
paid to the petitioner along with up-to-date interest as mentioned in the
letter dated 01.04.2004 as soon as the financial position improves. The
petitioner was requested to bear with the respondent for some more time.
This letter had been placed by the petitioner both before the Arbitral
Tribunal and before this Court. It is the contention of the learned counsel
for the respondent that this letter is a fabrication. It was also sought to be
contended that this letter did not form part of the Arbitral Tribunal record
but, that grievance now seems to have been removed inasmuch as the
learned counsel for the respondent was shown the original record and the
letter is found at the two places mentioned above. Apart from this, there is
reference to this letter at page 151 of the record of the Arbitral Tribunal.
OMP 445/2007

Page No.4 of 7

The said page is a part of the reply filed by the respondent to the rejoinder
in the application dated 14.03.2007. The said reply was received by the
petitioner on 04.04.2007. It was handed over to the applicant and the panel
of arbitrators during the hearing on 09.04.2007 as is clear from the
endorsement at page 149 of the record of the Arbitral Tribunal.

It is

apparent that the said letter dated 31.03.2006 was on record before the
Arbitral Tribunal prior to passing orders reserving the making of the Award.

5.

Thereafter on 01.06.2006 the petitioner filed a complaint with

the National Stock Exchange in respect of the non-payment of Rs 20 lacs
with interest by the respondent. The said complaint was filed in Investor's
Complaint Form No.1, as is the requirement. On 15.09.2006 the National
Stock Exchange issued a letter to the petitioner which is at page 13 of the
paper book. The letter indicates that the National Stock Exchange had
taken up the matter with the trading member (the respondent) for resolving
the same administratively. However, on account of conflicting claims and
counter-claims made by the parties, it was observed that the petitioner may,
if it so desire, take recourse to arbitration by filing an application for
arbitration against the respondent.

It was also indicated that the arbitration

application ought to be submitted within six months from the date on which
the claim, difference or dispute arose or is deemed to have arisen, otherwise
the arbitrator may dismiss the arbitration application as time barred under
the bye-laws of the National Stock Exchange of India. This was followed
by the petitioner filing the claim for arbitration on 22.11.2006.

It is

apparent from a reading of the Award that the letter dated 31.03.2006 has
OMP 445/2007

Page No.5 of 7

not even been considered inasmuch as there is no reference to the same. Of
course, the Arbitral Tribunal has taken the view that acknowledgments for
the purposes of a civil suit may extend the period of limitation but for the
purposes of arbitration the period had already expired. In the present case
what has to be seen is whether the arbitration claim has been filed within six
months from the date on which the claim, difference or dispute arose. It is
apparent that by virtue of the letter dated 31.03.2006, if it is to be
considered, the respondent has confirmed its liability to make the payment
to the petitioner. Thus, as on 31.03.2006 there is no dispute or difference
between the petitioner and the respondent. It is apparent that the dispute or
difference arose and some time after 31.03.2006 and before 01.06.2006,
when the petitioner made the complaint to the National Stock Exchange.
Being the relevant authority, the National Stock Exchange attempted at
resolving the same administratively and, finally, by the letter dated
15.09.2006 informed the petitioner that such a resolution was not possible
and that the petitioner may, if it so desired, go in for arbitration under the
bye-laws. Even if it is assumed that while on 31.03.2006 there was no
dispute between the petitioner and the respondent inasmuch as the
respondent was ready and willing to make the payment but, on the very next
day, that is, on 01.04.2006 the respondent resiled from its stand, the period
of six months taken from 01.04.2006 would end on 01.10.2006.

The

arbitration claim has been filed on 22.11.2006 or in other words, 1 month
and 22 days beyond that date. However, in view of the provisions of byelaw (3) itself, the time taken by the relevant authority to administratively
resolve the claim has to be excluded for the purposes of determining the
OMP 445/2007

Page No.6 of 7

period of six months. The complaint was filed before the National Stock
Exchange on 01.06.2006 and the attempt at administratively resolving the
same continued up to 15.09.2006 when the National Stock Exchange issued
the letter that it would not be possible to resolve the same administratively.
Therefore, the period starting from 01.06.2006 and ending on 15.09.2006
shall have to be excluded, that is, a period of three and a half months.
Consequently, it is apparent that the claim filed by the petitioner would be
within time.

6.

In view of the fact that the petitioner has been able to

demonstrate that the letter dated 31.03.2006 was not even considered by the
Arbitral Tribunal, the Award is liable to be set aside on this ground alone.
This is so because had the letter dated 31.03.2006 been considered and held
to have emanated from the respondent, then the claim would clearly be
within time. The Award is, therefore, set aside. There is no necessity for
this Court to examine the second proposition that was expressed by the
counsel for the petitioner. The record be sent back. The petitioner is
granted liberty to proceed afresh for arbitration.
This petition stands disposed of.
