2. To be referred to Reporter or not?

Yes

Yes

reported in the Digest?

SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.
1. The common thread that weaves through the present petitions
is the aspect of criminal culpability of persons undertaking
“sting” operations under the Indian Penal Code (‘IPC’ for short)
and the Prevention of Corruption Act (hereinafter referred to
as the said Act). The said revision petitions are filed against
the order on framing charges.
2. On 05-11-2003, M/s. Dilip Singh Judeo (accused No. 1), the
then Union Minister of State for Environment & Forests
allegedly received illegal gratification in the sum of Rs. Nine
lacs in the presence of his Additional Private Secretary (APS),
Shri Natwar Rateria (accused no. 2) from one Shri Bhupinder
Singh Patel @ Rahul (accused no. 3) as consideration for

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

future ‘favours’ with regard to certain mining projects in the
states of Chattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa. The said incident
had been secretly video recorded by accused no. 3 and one
Shri Arvind Vijaymohan (accused no. 4) acquainted with
accused

no.

3

who

arranged

for

the

video

recording

equipment. This incident came to be widely reported and
publicized in print and visual media.
3. After conducting a preliminary enquiry, the respondent
registered a case against the said accused no. 1, accused no.
2, accused no. 3 and accused no. 4 on 19-12-2003. Further
investigations conducted and statements of various witnesses
recorded revealed that Shri Amit Jogi (accused no. 5) s/o Shri
Ajit Jogi the then Chief Minister of Chattisgarh had allegedly
hatched a plan with the said accused no. 3, accused no. 4 and
one Shri Rajat Prasad (accused no. 6) to video record accused
no. 1 in the act of receiving bribe with an intention to disgrace
accused no. 1 and tarnish his image and derive political
mileage just before the assembly polls of Chattisgarh which
were scheduled to be held in the end of November, 2003. The
respondent thereafter filed the charge sheet where the names
of accused no. 5 and accused no. 6 were added.
4. In the meantime, accused no 3, along with one Shri Praveen
Jain filed a petition u/s 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
(the said Code for short) in this court for quashing of the FIR
against them which was dismissed vide order dated 10-112004. In December 2004, a Special Leave Petition was filed

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 3 of 38

assailing the aforesaid order which met the same fate and the
Apex Court while disposing of the said SLP vide order dated
23-11-2007

observed

that

the

petitions

had

become

infructuous in view of the charges being already framed
against the petitioners in the trial proceedings.
5. In the charge sheet, the respondent named two sets of
accused. One comprising of accused no. 1 and accused no. 2
who were booked under section 7 of the said Act r/w section
120B of IPC for receiving the bribe amount from accused no. 3
which was secretly

video

recorded and the other set

comprising of accused no. 3-6 charge sheeted under section
12 of the said Act r/w section 120B of IPC for having conspired
with one another with the motive to humiliate accused no. 1
and taint his image.
6. During the trial before the Ld. Special Judge, accused no. 1
and 2 conceded to the framing of charges and did not advance
any defense on their behalf. In so far as accused nos. 3-6 are
concerned, after the hearing of the arguments of the parties
on charge, the court found against the said accused and
framed charges against them u/s 12 of the said Act r/w section
120B of IPC vide orders dated 24-04-2007 and 25-04-2007.
The present revision petitions are directed against the
aforesaid orders passed by the Ld. Special judge, CBI on
framing of charges against the petitioners/accused nos. 3-6.
7. The plea raised by the learned counsel for accused no. 3 is
that accused no. 3 being employed as a journalist in Akash

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 4 of 38

Channel had access to the Chief Minister and thought of
exposing corruption at highest level in order to make a name
for himself in the field of investigation. Accused no. 3 was
justified to use subterfuge, to obtain material, which could not
have been possible by other means and that the petitioner
could not even report the matter to the police or any
investigating agency like the CBI for the reason that such
agencies also work under the State/Central Government and
there was a chance of the entire effort being rendered futile. It
was thus submitted that the real motive of giving bribe to
accused no. 1 was to expose the corruptness of accused no. 1
and instead of honouring such an act of accused no. 1, the
respondent CBI registered a case of abetment against him.
8. It was argued that where section 12 of the said Act provides
for the punishment for abetment of offences defined in section
7 or 11 of the said Act, it becomes important that the
ingredients of the said section be met which it is pleaded was
not so in the present case. The allegations made in the FIR
and the charge sheet do not disclose commission of any of
these offences referred to and thus there can be no abetment
u/s 12 of the said Act. It was submitted that there can be no
mens rea attributed to accused no. 3. In this respect, the
learned counsel for the accused no. 3 pointed out the decision
of the Apex Court in Shri Ram v. The State of U.P. AIR 1975 SC
175 where it was held that an offence of abetment cannot be
made out against an accused unless it is shown that the

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 5 of 38

abettor had “intentionally” aided the commission of the crime.
The judgment of Mahadeo Daunappa Gunaki & Anr. v. State
AIR 1952 Bom 435 dealt with the aspect of the mens rea of
the bribe giver where it was observed as under:
“…In the case of a person, who offers a bribe,
the mens rea consists in his intention to give
a bribe in order that it may induce the public
servant to do or not to do something which
he would otherwise not do or do. This state of
mind of the person, who offers a gratification,
has obviously nothing to do with the question
whether the public servant, to whom the
gratification is offered, is or is not in a
position to do or not to do the act, for doing
or for not doing which the amount is offered
to him. If, therefore, the intention or object
with which money is offered to a public
servant is to induce him to perform an official
act or show favour in the exercise of his
official functions or render any service with
any public servant, the offence punishable
under section 161 read with section 116 IPC
would be complete, and it is immaterial
whether the public servant is or is not
actually in a position to do the act or show
favour or render service, for doing, showing
or rendering which the bribe is offered to
him.”
9.

The learned counsel for accused no. 3 further submitted that
the prosecution failed to show any material to establish the
involvement of accused no. 3 in the alleged conspiracy and in
this regard referred to the judgment of the Apex Court in R.
Balakrishna Pillai v. State of Kerela (2003) 9 SCC 700 to point
out the general principle of criminal jurisprudence that the
element of mens rea and intention must accompany the
culpable act or conduct of the accused. The accused must
have the mental state or degree of fault at the relevant time.

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 6 of 38

It may differ from crime to crime according to the definition
thereof. The matter of degrees may also differ. In other words,
the mental state and the criminal act must coincide. Mere
intention is not punishable except when it is accompanied by
an act or conduct of commission or omission on the part of the
accused.
10. It was averred that a tape recorded conversation could be
used as a piece of evidence only by way of corroborating the
statement of a person who deposes that the other speaker
and he carried on the conversation or even of the statement
of a person who deposes that he overheard the conversation
between the two persons and what they actually stated had
been tape recorded. Thus, the tape recorded conversation can
be used as a corroborative evidence of such conversation
deposed to by any of the parties to the conversation which law
has been well enunciated in the case of The State v. Ravi alias
Munna 2000 Cri.L.J. 1125.
11. On the other hand, the case of the prosecution in respect of
accused no. 3 is that accused no. 3 assuming a fictitious name
of Rahul Saroagi and representing a fictitious and unknown
Australian mining company, paid the aforesaid amount to
accused no. 1 & 2 for the purposes of rendering illegal
assistance which was secretly video recorded by him and later
released to media with a motive to aid and abet accused no. 5
and derive political mileage for the father of accused no. 5.
Apart from the testimony of Shri Praveen Jain (PW32), the

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 7 of 38

documentary evidence produced in support of the aforesaid
allegation is the APFSL, Hyderabad report which proves the
genuineness of the recordings of the incident of 05-11-2003
wherein accused no. 1 and 2 were seen to be receiving the
alleged bribe from accused no. 3. In the affidavit filed by
accused no. 3, he has admitted to have paid the said bribe.
The CFSL report has also proved the presence of accused no.
3 in the video recording of the alleged incident. The
transcription/content of the recording of the incident proves
that the bribe was given with regard to future favours to be
extended by accused no. 1 and 2 with regard to the mining
projects.
12. It was alleged that accused no. 3 had been introduced to
accused no. 1 as “Rahul” by one Shri Shekhar Singh (PW22) of
Bhopal in connection with certain purported work relating to
an Australian Mining Company which is evident from the
testimony of Shri Shekhar Singh (PW22) and affidavit of
accused no. 3 where after accused no. 3 established friendly
relationship with accused no. 1 and 2.
13. The learned counsel for the respondent further argued that
the claim of accused no. 3 that the act of payment of illegal
gratification to accused no. 1 and the secret video recording of
this act was prompted by a journalistic desire to expose
corruption in public life is wrong and that his actual motive
was to derive political mileage in favour of the father of
accused no. 5. The aforesaid allegation is evident from the

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 8 of 38

fact that after recording of the incident, accused no. 3 took
time for masking/hiding his identity and then released the
video recording to media. Even while releasing the tape to the
media he had not disclosed his identity to the media persons
and in fact had disappeared without informing the incident to
any lawful agency. It was pleaded that accused no. 3 did not
come forward even after the case was registered by the
respondent and did not co-operate with the investigating
agency until a specific direction was passed by this court in
this behalf.
14. It was averred that the testimony of Shri Manish Rachhoya
(PW 23) itself brings to light the fact that accused no. 5 and
other co-conspirators had originally roped him in who happens
to be a close friend of accused no. 5 and accused no. 3 took
charge only after he (PW 23) decided to back out from the
plan hatched by accused no. 5.
15. It was pleaded that if a non-public servant is also a member of
the criminal conspiracy for a public servant to commit any
offence under the said Act, or if such non-public servant has
abetted any of the offences which the public servant commits,
such non-public servant is also liable to be tried along with the
public servant before the Court of a Special Judge having
jurisdiction in the matter and to support the said proposition
reliance was placed on the decision of P. Nallammal & Anr. v.
State 1999 SCC (Cri.) 1133.

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 9 of 38

16. The submission made on behalf of accused no. 4 is that the
respondent made no specific allegations in the charge sheet
against accused no. 4 in so far as the alleged abetment and
conspiracy is concerned as also that the prosecution placed no
material on record to prove accused no. 4’s connection in the
act of giving bribe to accused no. 1 by accused no. 3. It was
pointed out that even if there is evidence collected against
him, the only role that can be assigned to him in the said
conspiracy is that of procuring the camera equipment and
installing the same therefore the charge which could at best
be framed against him is of defamation at the behest of
accused no. 1 who has chosen not to do the same.
17. Learned counsel submitted that section 24 of the said Act
provides for protection from prosecution under section 12 to
the bribe giver who makes a statement in any “proceedings”
against the public servant for an offence under section 7 to 11
or section 13 or section 15 that he offered or agreed to offer
any illegal gratification to the public servant. It is stated that
accused no. 4 is entitled to seek such protection and for the
said purpose it was not necessary to approach the police as
projected by the learned counsel for the respondent.
18. It is the case of the prosecution that accused no. 4 was also
deeply involved in hatching of the alleged conspiracy and to
prove the same have placed on record various documentary
evidence in the form of recoveries being made which include
recovery of the key of room where the incident was video

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 10 of 38

recorded; air tickets (PD 28) of accused no. 3, 5, one Shri
Praveen Jain from his residence; receipt no. 6622 dated 25-082002 (PD-27) of the said room issued in the name of “Rahul
Saraogi”. The call records of the petitioners, Shri Manish
Rachoya (PW 23) and Manoj Hora (PW 40) also goes to show
the same apart from the statement of PW 23.
19. To further substantiate his plea, the learned counsel for the
respondent contended that accused no. 4 being a college
mate of accused no. 5, is a close friend of accused no. 5 and
both of them were staying/meeting at A-4, 6, Aurengzeb Road,
New Delhi around the time when this conspiracy was hatched.
It is stated that accused no. 4 was in-charge of election
campaigning for Congress Party in Chattisgarh. In this respect
reliance was placed on both oral and documentary evidence.
The call analysis shows that accused no. 4 was also in close
contact with accused no. 3, 6 and PW 23 for the purposes of
execution of the plan.
20. Apart from the above, it is pleaded that it is an admitted fact
that accused no. 4 was the one who arranged the person and
the equipment to record the alleged incident.
21. In so far as accused no. 5 is concerned, the learned counsel
contended that the allegation of the respondent that the
mastermind behind the alleged conspiracy was accused no. 5
is wholly baseless. Accused no. 5 has not been charged of the
substantive offence under section 7 of the said Act but only for
abetment of the same r/w section 120B IPC. A reading of the

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 11 of 38

aforesaid provisions would show that an accused person must
have an agreement with the person charged of conspiracy to
do an illegal act or an act which is not illegal by illegal means.
It is thus pleaded that accused no. 5 had no agreement with
accused no. 1 and hence no case can be made out against
him.
22. The learned counsel relied upon the decision of Saju v. State
of Kerela 2000 VII AD (SC) 437 to elucidate further on the
aspect of conspiracy where it was observed as under:
“9. In Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of Bihar
AIR 1994 SC 2420 this Court reiterated that
the
essential
ingredient
of
criminal
conspiracy is the agreement to commit an
offence. After referring to the judgments in
NMMY Momin v. State of Maharashtra AIR
1971 SC 885 and State (Delhi Admn) v. V.C.
Shukla AIR 1980 SC1382 it was held in S.C.
Bahri's case (Supra) as under:
A cursory look to the provisions contained in
Section 120-A reveal that a criminal
conspiracy envisages an agreement between
two or more persons to commit an illegal act
or an act which by itself may not be illegal
but the same is done or executed by illegal
means. Thus the essential ingredient of the
offence of criminal conspiracy is the
agreement to commit an offence. In a case
where the agreement is for accomplishment
of an act which by itself constitutes an
offence, then in that event no overt act is
necessary to be proved by the prosecution
because in such a fact situation criminal
conspiracy is established by proving such an
agreement. In other words, where the
conspiracy alleged is with regard to
commission of a serious crime of the nature
as contemplated in Section 120B read with
the proviso to Sub-section (2) of Section 120A of the IPC, then in that event mere proof of
an agreement between the accused for
commission of such a crime alone is enough
to bring about a conviction under Section

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 12 of 38

120B and the proof of any overt act by the
accused or by any one of them would not be
necessary. The provisions in such a situation
do not require that each and every person
who is a party to the conspiracy must do
some overt act towards the fulfilment of the
object of conspiracy, the essential ingredient
being
an
agreement
between
the
conspirators to commit the crime and if these
requirements and ingredients are established
the act would fall within the trapping of the
provisions contained in Section 120B since
from its very nature a conspiracy must be
conceived and hatched in complete secrecy,
because otherwise the whole purpose may
frustrate and it is common experience and
goes without saying that only in very rare
cases one may come across direct evidence
of a criminal conspiracy to commit any crime
and in most of the cases it is only the
circumstantial evidence which is available
from which an inference giving rise to the
conclusion of an agreement between two or
more persons to commit an offence may be
legitimately drawn.
10. It has thus to be established that the
accused charged with criminal conspiracy
had agreed to pursue a course of conduct
which he knew leading to the commission of
a crime by one or more persons to the
agreement, of that offence. Besides the fact
of agreement the necessary mens rea of the
crime is also required to be established.”
(Emphasis Supplied)
23. In Sharad Yadav and Ors. v. Union of India (UOI) and Anr
82(1999) DLT 13, the broad principles governing the law of
conspiracy were discussed which are as under:
“20. Section 120-A, IPC defines conspiracy as
an agreement to do an unlawful act or a
lawful act by unlawful means. An agreement
will amount to a statutory conspiracy only if
carrying it out will necessarily amount to or
involve the commission of an offence by one
or more of the parties to the conspiracy. For

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 13 of 38

purpose of analysis it is perhaps convenient
to isolate the three clauses each of which
must be taken as indicating an essential
ingredient of the offence as follows :
(i) If a person agrees with any other person
or persons that a course of conduct shall be
pursued,
(ii) which will necessarily amount to or
involve the commission of any offence or
offences by one or more of the parties to the
agreement,
(iii) if the agreement is carried out in
accordance with their intentions.
21. Thus, the essential ingredient in the
crime of conspiring to commit a specific
offence or offences is that the accused
should agree that a course of conduct be
pursued which he knows must involve the
commission by one or more of the parties to
the agreement of that offence or offences.
But, beyond the mere fact of agreement, the
necessary mens rea of the crime is
established if it is shown that the accused,
when he entered into the agreement,
intended to play some part in the agreed
course of conduct in furtherance of the
criminal purpose which the agreed course of
conduct was intended to achieve. (See R. v.
Anderson, (1985) 2 All. E.R. 961).
22. In State through S.P. (CBI/STT v. Nalini
and Ors.) JT1999 (4) SC 106, some of the
broad principles governing the law of
conspiracy have been summarised as under:
"1. Under Section 120A, IPC offence of
criminal conspiracy is committed when two
or more persons agree to do or cause to be
done an illegal act or legal act by illegal
means. When it is legal act by illegal means
over act is necessary. Offence of criminal
conspiracy is exception to the general law
where intent alone does not constitute crime.
It is intention to commit crime and joining
hands with persons having the same
intention. Not only the intention but there
has to be agreement to carry out the object

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 14 of 38

of the intention, which is an offence. The
question for consideration in a case is did all
the accused had the intention and did they
agree that the crime be committed. It would
not be enough for the offence of conspiracy
when some of the accused merely
entertained a wish, howsoever, horrendous it
may be, that offence be committed.
2. Acts subsequent to the achieving of object
of conspiracy may tend to prove that a
particular accused was party to the
conspiracy. Once the object of conspiracy
has been achieved, any subsequent act,
which may be unlawful, would not make the
accused a part of the conspiracy like giving
shelter to an absconder.
3. Conspiracy is hatched in private or in
secrecy. It is rarely possible to establish a
conspiracy by direct evidence. Usually, both
the existence of the conspiracy and its
objects
have
to
inferred
from
the
circumstances and the conduct of the
accused.
4. Conspirators may, for example, be enrolled
in a chain - A enrolling B, B enrolling C, and
so on; and all will be members of a single
conspiracy if they so intend and agree, even
though each member knows only the person
who enrolled him and the person whom he
enrolls. There may be a kind of umbrellaspoke enrollent, where a single person at the
centre doing the enrolling and all the other
members being unknown to each other,
though they know that there are to be other
members. These are theories and in practice
it may be difficult to tell whether the
conspiracy in a particular case falls into
which category. It may, however, even
overlap. But then there has to be present
mutual interest. Persons may be members of
single conspiracy even though each is
ignorant of the identity of many others who
may have diverse role to play. It is not a part
of the crime of conspiracy that all the
conspirators need to agree to play the same
or an active role.

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 15 of 38

5. When two or more persons agree to
commit a crime of conspiracy, then
regardless of making or considering any
plans for its commission, and despite the fact
that no step is taken by any such person to
carry out their common propose, a crime is
committed by each and every one who joins
in the agreement. There has thus to be two
conspirators and there may be more than
that. To prove the charge of conspiracy it is
not necessary that intended crime was
committed or not. If committed it may further
help prosecution to prove the charge of
conspiracy.
6. It is not necessary that all conspirators
should agree to the common purpose at the
same time. They may join with other
conspirators at any time before the
consummation of the intended objective, and
all are equally responsible. What part each
conspirator is to play may not be known to
everyone or the fact as to when a conspirator
joined the conspiracy and when he left.
7. A charge of conspiracy may prejudice the
accused because it is forced them into a joint
trial and the Court may consider the entire
mass of evidence against every accused.
Prosecution has to produce evidence not only
to show that each of the accused has
knowledge of object of conspiracy but also of
the agreement. In the charge of conspiracy
Court has to guard itself against the danger
of unfairness to the accused. Introduction of
evidence against some may result in the
conviction of all, which is to be avoided. By
means of evidence in conspiracy, which is
otherwise inadmissible in the trial of any
other substantive offence prosecution tries to
implicate the accused not only in the
conspiracy itself bat also in the substantive
crime of the alleged conspirators. There is
always difficulty in tracing the precise
contribution of each member of the
conspiracy but then there has to be cogent
and convincing evidence against each one of
the accused charged with the offence of
conspiracy. As observed by Judge Learned
Hand that "this distinction is important today
when many prosecutors seek to sweep within

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 16 of 38

the dragnet of conspiracy all those who have
been associated in any degree whatever with
the main offenders.
8. As stated above it is the unlawful
agreement and not its accomplishment,
which is the gist or essence of the crime of
conspiracy. Offence of criminal conspiracy is
complete even though there is no agreement
as to the means by which the purpose is to
be accomplished. It is the unlawful
agreement, which is the graveman of the
crime of conspiracy .'The unlawful agreement
which amounts to a conspiracy need not be
formal or express, but may be inherent in
and inferred from the circumstances,
especially declarations, acts and conduct of
the conspirators. The agreement need not be
entered into by all the parties to it at the
same time, but may be reached by
successive actions evidencing their joining of
the conspiracy.
9. It has been said that a criminal conspiracy
is a partnership in crime, and that there is in
each conspiracy a joint or mutual agency for
the prosecution of a common plan. Thus, if
two or more persons enter into a conspiracy,
any act done by any of them pursuant to the
agreement is, in contemplation of law, the
act of each of them and they are jointly
responsible therefor. This means that
everything said, written or done by any of the
conspirators in execution or furtherance of
the common purpose is deemed to have
been said, done, or written by each of them.
And this joint responsibility extends not only
to what is done by any of the conspirators
pursuant to the original agreement but also
to collateral acts incident to and growing out
of the original purpose. A conspirator is not
responsible, however, for acts done by a coconspirator
after
termination
of
the
conspiracy. The joinder of a conspiracy by a
new member does not create a new
conspiracy nor does it change the status of
the other conspirators and the mere fact that
conspirators individually or in groups perform
different tasks to a common and / does into
split up a conspiracy into several different
conspiracies.

10. A man may join a conspiracy by word or
by deed. However, criminal responsibility for
a conspiracy requires more than a merely
passive
attitude
towards
an
existing
conspiracy. One who commits an overt act
with knowledge of the conspiracy is guilty.
And one who tacitly consents to the object of
a conspiracy and goes alongwith other
conspirators, actually standing by while the
others put the conspiracy into effect, is guilty
though he intends to take no active part in
the crime."
24. The motive alleged by the prosecution of deriving political
mileage for his father by conspiring with accused no. 3, 4 and
6 cannot be construed to mean seeking any favour or reward
which is a necessary ingredient for prosecution under the said
Act. The mens rea to give bribe to another person is thus
missing in respect of accused no. 5. In Padam Sen & Anr. v.
State AIR 1959 All. 707, a case which dealt with the offence of
abetment in respect of public servants under 165A IPC (as it
then was), the court held as under:
“…the mens rea to be considered in one case
is that of the bribe taken and in the other of
the bribe giver. The common factor in the
two cases of course is that the person bribed,
or attempted to be bribed, should be a public
servant, but in a case under Section 165A
since it is the mens rea of the bribe giver that
has to be considered, it should be sufficient
to render him liable if his object in bribing or
attempting to bribe the public servant was to
induce the public servant to do an official act
or show or forbear to show, in the exercise of
his official functions, favour or disfavour to
him, it being quite immaterial whether the
public servant was not in fact in a position to
do or not to do the act or show or forbear to
show the favour or disfavour in question.

25. It is averred that exposure of corruption on the part of a public
servant is not an illegal act either under the said Act or the
penal Code as also that accused no. 5 had the right to claim
protection under section 24 of the said Act which protection
can be claimed only during trial and not at the stage of
registration of FIR as noticed in Sri Bharadwaaj Media Pvt. Ltd.
v. State 2008 (1) JCC 167.
26. The learned counsel for the prosecution has argued to the
contrary and stated that accused no. 5 was the mastermind
behind the alleged conspiracy which was devised with the
motive to disgrace accused no. 1 and derive political mileage
for his father. For the said purpose, accused no. 5 was aided
by accused no. 3, 4 and 6 who are stated to be close friends of
accused no. 5. The learned counsel pleaded that there is
enough material on record to substantiate accused no. 5’s
involvement. The statement of PW 23 and PW43 is relevant in
this behalf where PW43 Rahul Pandey deposed that accused
no. 5 had enquired about the likely impact of the Ju Dev’s
Episode on electoral prospects of Congress Party.
27. The charge sheet also discloses that accused no. 5 was having
controlling interest in Akash Channel and was known to Shri
Rohit Prasad (PW 20) and accused no. 6 as also that accused
no 3 who was an employee of the said channel was chosen by
accused no. 5 himself and brought into conspiracy through
accused no. 6.

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 19 of 38

28. The submissions advanced by learned counsel for accused no.
6 is that the act of exposing the corruptness of a public
servant cannot be termed as an illegal act and it is this act for
which the accused persons entered into an agreement which
by no stretch of imagination can be called as a conspiracy.
29. It is the case of the CBI that accused no. 6 had booked a room
at the Hotel Taj Palace on 25-07-2003 under the name of
Manish Sarogi which was later occupied by Manish Rachoya
(PW 23). On 27-07-2003, accused no. 5 brought one Shekhar
Singh (PW22) for meeting with PW 23. It is then that PW 23
decided to disassociate himself from the alleged conspiracy
and thus checked out of the hotel on 28-07-2003. It is a
settled law that conspiracy to commit a crime itself is
punishable as a substantive offence and every individual
offence committed pursuant to the conspiracy is separate and
distinct offence to which individual offenders are liable to
punishment,

independent

of

the

conspiracy.

Yet,

the

agreement does not come to an end with its making, but
would endure till it is accomplished or abandoned or proved
abortive. It was pleaded that it is the respondent’s own case
that PW 23 was made a prosecution witness because the
conspiracy was abandoned on 28-07-2003 as also that
accused

no.

6

was

attached/assigned

no

specific

role

subsequent to 25-07-2003 other than booking the hotel room
that too in July 2003 whereas admittedly the alleged video
recorded incident of receiving of bribe by accused no. 1 from

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 20 of 38

accused no. 3 had taken place on 05-11-2003 which is four
months later. Thus, accused no. 6 claimed relief on the ground
of parity where similarly placed persons like PW23 were
granted benefit/relief of becoming prosecution witness.
30. The learned counsel for the parties fully conscious of the well
settled principles on the law governing framing of charges
brought to the notice of this court various precedents in
Niranjan Singh Karam Singh Punjabi, Advocate v. Jitender
Bhimraj Bijjaya & Ors. (1990) 4 SCC 76; Union of India v.
Prafulla Kumar Samal & Anr. AIR 1979 SC 366; Dilawar Balu
Kurane v. State of Maharashta (2002) 2 SCC 135; Soma
Chakravarty v. State through CBI (2007) 5 SCC 403; Om Wati
(Smt) & Anr. v. State through Delhi Admin. And Ors. (2001) 4
SCC 333; State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath Padhi (2005) 1 SCC
568; Neeraj Gupta & Ors. v. CBI 2007 V Ad (Cri.) (DHC) 517
where the court has repeatedly held that the Court at the
stage of framing charges has undoubted power to sift and
weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out
whether or not a prima facie case against the accused has
been made out. Where the materials placed before the Court
disclose grave suspicion against the accused which has not
been properly explained, the Court will be fully justified in
framing a charge and proceeding with the trial. The test to
determine a prima facie case would naturally depend upon the
facts of each case and it is difficult to lay down a rule of
universal application. By and large, however, if two views are

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 21 of 38

equally possible and the Judge is satisfied that the evidence
produced before him while giving rise to some suspicion but
not grave suspicion against the accused, he will be fully within
his right to discharge the accused. In exercising his jurisdiction
under Section 227 of the Code the Judge cannot act merely as
a Post Office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution, but has to
consider the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of
the evidence and the documents produced before the Court,
any basic infirmities appearing in the case and so on. This
however does not mean that the Judge should make a roving
enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the
evidence as if he was conducting a trial.
31. It cannot be lost sight of that Section 401 CrPC conferring
powers of an appellate court on the revisional court is with a
limited purpose. The provisions contained in Section 395 to
Section 401 CrPC, read together, do not indicate that the
revisional power of the High Court can be exercised as a
second appellate court. Thus, the High Court in revision while
exercising supervisory jurisdiction of a restricted nature is
justified in refusing to re-appreciate the evidence for the
purposes of determining whether the concurrent finding of
fact reached by the Ld. Trial Court is correct. The revisional
power of the High Court merely conserves the power of the
High Court to see that justice is done in accordance with the
recognised rules of criminal jurisprudence and that its
subordinate courts do not exceed the jurisdiction or abuse the

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 22 of 38

power vested in them under the Code or to prevent abuse of
the process of the inferior criminal courts or to prevent
miscarriage of justice.
32. The aforesaid aspects have been emphasized for the reason
that this Court shall be adjudicating upon the matter within
the realm of the power envisaged for a revision court as also
being mindful of the fact that this Court would not go again
into detailed scrutiny of evidence so as to derive a different
conclusion.
33. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the present
matter and I find no reason to differ from the findings arrived
at by the Ld. Trial Court. A scrutiny of impugned order and the
material placed on record shows that the learned Special
Judge, CBI while rejecting the submissions made by the
learned counsel for the petitioners has examined, discussed
and assessed the evidence and the material placed on record
in depth in respect of each of the accused in reaching to the
aforesaid conclusion. In my considered view, at this stage of
the trial where no conclusive inference can be drawn, the
prosecution has been able to establish a prima facie case
against the petitioners.
34. Section 120-A IPC defines conspiracy and section 120-B
provides for its punishment. Section 120-A reads as under:
“120A. Definition of criminal conspiracy.
When two or more person agree to do, or
cause to be done,

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 23 of 38

(1)
An
illegal
act,
or
(2) An act which is not illegal by illegal
means, such an agreement is designated a
criminal conspiracy: Provided that no
agreement except an agreement to commit
an offence shall amount to a criminal
conspiracy unless some act besides the
agreement is done by one or more parties to
such agreement in pursuance thereof.
Explanation: - It is immaterial whether the
illegal act is the ultimate object of such
agreement, or is merely incidental to that
object.]”
35. The principles governing the law in relation to a conspiracy are
clear where it is essential that the parties have an agreement
to commit a specific offence with an intention to play some
part in the agreed course of conduct in furtherance of the
criminal act. Such an unlawful agreement need not be formal
or express, but may be inherent in and inferred from the
circumstances, acts and conduct of the conspirators. Since a
conspiracy is hatched in private or in secrecy, it is rarely
possible to establish a conspiracy by direct evidence, thus the
same may be inferred from the circumstances and the
conduct of the accused persons so involved.
36. The offences by or relating to public servants are detailed
under Sections 7 to 13 of the said Act, which were enacted as
a substitute for the offences under Section 161-165 of the IPC,
which formed part of Chapter IX of IPC. These sections were
omitted from the Penal Code when the said Act came into
force. The offence of abetment as defined under Section 107

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 24 of 38

IPC applies to all Central Acts vide Section 3(i) and 4(ii) of
General Clauses Act, 1897 which reads as under:
“Section 107. Abetment of a thing
A person abets the doing of a thing, whoFirst: -Instigates any person to do that thing;
or
Secondly: -Engages with one or more other
person or persons in any conspiracy for the
doing of that thing, if an act or illegal
omission takes place in pursuance of that
conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that
thing;
or
Thirdly: -Intentionally aids, by any act or
illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
Explanation1:- A person who, by wilful
misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment
of a material fact which he is bound to
disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or
attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be
done, is said to instigate the doing of that
thing.”
Thus, a person may be charged of an offence of abetment if
he instigates a person to commit an offence; or engages in a
conspiracy to commit such an offence or intentionally aides a
person to commit an offence.

Section 109 IPC provides

punishment for abetment, if the offence is committed in
consequence to such abetment and where no express
provision is made for its punishment.

Such offence of

abetment will be constituted, even when the person refuses to
commit such an offence. Mens rea is an essential ingredient of
a criminal offence unless the statues expressly or by
necessary implication exclude the same.
37. In the instant case, the real nature of the petitioners’ action
and motive is evident from the material placed on record

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 25 of 38

wherein it may be noticed that the activities in relation to the
said conspiracy of the petitioners relate to the period when
assembly elections were to be held shortly in Chattisgarh.
Accused no.5 had masterminded this criminal conspiracy in
which he was actively assisted by the other co-accused,
including accused no. 6, accused no. 4 and later, accused no.
3 in order to disgrace him just prior to Elections for
Chattisgarh Assembly and to derive political mileage in favour
of Sh. Ajit Jogi father of accused no. 5, who was the Chief
Minister of Chattisgarh during the relevant time. In other
words, accused no. 5 intentionally abetted accused no. 6,
accused no. 4 and accused no. 3 to engage in a conspiracy to
commit the offence of giving bribe to accused no. 1 who
happened to be a public servant with an ulterior motive to
gain vantage out of the same for his father in the forth coming
elections.
38. A reading of the FIR and the charge sheet supported by oral
and documentary evidence shows that PW 23 and accused no.
4 were close friends of accused no. 5 from college days.
Accused no. 4 apart from being a friend of accused no. 5 was
actively involved in the election campaigning of Congress
Party. Accused no. 6 had substantial business interests in the
State of Chattisgarh including M/s. Akash Channels Pvt. Ltd.,
with which accused no. 5 was also indirectly associated.

It

may also be pertinent to note that accused no. 3 was earlier
working with M/s Akash Channels Pvt. Ltd, Raipur/Bhilai having

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 26 of 38

been recruited by accused no. 6 prompted by accused no. 5.
The deposition of PW 43 discloses that accused no. 5 had
enquired about the likely impact of the Ju Dev’s episode on
electoral prospects of Congress Party.
39. Accused no. 5 along with accused no. 6 and accused no. 4
originally roped in PW 23, for meeting accused no. 1 and to
enact the role, which was subsequently assigned to accused
no. 3. In 2002, accused no. 5 was accompanied by PW 23 for
vacations where accused no. 5 introduced PW 23 to PW 22. In
July 2003, accused no. 5 confided in PW 23 that he wanted to
use him for meeting accused no. 1 and in consequence to the
same, got PW 23 re-introduced to PW 22 who assured PW 23
that he will get his meeting fixed with accused no. 1. In the
meantime, accused no. 6 booked a room in Taj Mahal Hotel
and

However, consequent to these

developments, PW 23 developed a feeling that he was getting
into some undesirable affair at the behest of accused no. 5
and therefore decided to dissociate himself from the said plan,
though at the instance of accused no. 5 and accused no. 4, PW
23 informed PW 22 that due to some reason, it would be
accused no. 3 alias ‘Rahul’ who would be meeting accused no.
1. It is at this stage that accused no. 3 who was an employee
in Akash Channel was brought into the picture and was
assigned the role of PW 23.

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 27 of 38

40. Accused no. 3 stayed in the Suite for a number of days, during
different periods and met accused no. 1 and 2 on a number of
occasions and gained their confidence. It is only then that on
the D day i.e. 05.11.2003, accused no. 3 accompanied by one
Shri Praveen Kumar Jain checked-into Room No. 822, Hotel Taj
Mahal, Man Singh Raod, New Delhi to meet accused no. 1 and
2 with the motive to secretly video record the act of payment
of illegal gratification to accused no. 1. In the meanwhile,
accused no. 4 had arranged for installation of hidden video
recording equipments in the sitting room of the said Room.
The video recording of this meeting, which was secretly done,
was subsequently released to media after masking the faces
of accused no. 3 and his associate Praveen Jain @ ‘Manish’ to
cancel their identity.
41. Thus, the inference drawn from the prevailing circumstances
and the conduct of the accused that the petitioners mutually
agreed to conspire against accused no. 1 and 2 with an
unlawful intention to taint the image of accused no. 1 and get
benefited by the same cannot be doubted especially in view of
the fact that the same was attempted at/around the time of
elections. Each of the accused had a precise contribution to
the conspiracy and there is cogent and convincing evidence
against each one of them charged with the offence of
conspiracy. The prosecution has been able to produce
evidence by way of oral testimonies of the witnesses and
documentary evidence in the form of recoveries made of room

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 28 of 38

keys, air tickets, receipt of the said room, call records etc. to
show that each of the accused has knowledge of object of
conspiracy and also of the agreement. Though this agreement
was not entered into by all the accused at the same time, but
their successive actions provide enough evidence to lay a
grave suspicion in the mind of their joining of the said
conspiracy.
42. Investigation has revealed that accused no. 3 was employed in
Akash Channel as a journalist by accused no. 5 and he was
included as a part of the conspiracy at the instance of both
accused no. 5 and 6. It is an admitted fact that accused no. 1
accepted illegal gratification in the presence of his PS from
accused no. 3 alias ‘Rahul’ as a consideration for some
unlawful extraneous purpose. It is here that I find myself in
agreement with the observations made the learned trial Court
that the plea raised by the learned counsel for accused no. 3
that his real motive to execute such an act was to expose the
corruption on the part of accused no. 1 in public cannot be
accepted for the reason that if the accused no. 3’s proclaimed
intention of exposing corruption was to be correct, he would
have disclosed the same to some investigating agency or the
police who could have organized a legally admissible trap and
apprehended the bribe takers and seized the bribe amount.
43. Accused no. 3 had an option to do same even after the
execution of such operation was complete but he consciously
concealed his identity and avoided appearance before the CBI.

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 29 of 38

As a matter of fact, he did not come forward even after the
case was registered against him by CBI and did not co-operate
with the investigating agency till he was specifically directed
to. Even if the converse was to be true i.e accused no. 3 would
have had a bona fide intention to expose corruption of
accused no. 1, it was not justified on his part to espouse and
act as an investigating agency himself and lay a trap for
accused no. 1. He should have taken a proper channel and
approached the police or some investigating agency and filed
a complaint with the same.

I do not find strength in the

argument advanced by the learned counsel that accused no. 3
could not have reported the matter to the police or any
investigating agency like the CBI for the reason that such
agencies work under the State/Central Government and there
was a chance of the entire effort being rendered futile. It must
be understood that in order to change a system, one needs to
work within the system. What makes our democracy a reality
is the adherence to the Rule of law and the enforcement of
accountability of the wielders of power. No institution is
perfect and thus it is the duty of every citizen to strengthen
these institutions and remove anomalies and shortcomings, if
any, in their functioning rather than weaken them so as to
restore the confidence in the institutions of democracy.
44. It cannot be lost sight of that no one is above the law, but the
law is above everyone. The learned single judge of this court
in Crl. M.C. No.59/2004 titled Bhupendra Singh Patel & Ors. v.

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 30 of 38

State (CBI) dated 10.11.2004 placing reliance on the decision
of the Apex Court in Sewak Ram Sobhani v. R.K.Karanjivani,
Chief Editor Blitz

AIR 1981 SC 1514 rightly observed that

journalists do not enjoy any special privilege and have no
greater freedom or position than others.

A vast gulf exists

between 'snaring' or 'tempting' people into accepting 'gifts' or
'bribes', where a cause of action does not exist, and exposing
corruption regarding specific deals and not to recognise the
significance of this difference is a grievous mistake.
45. No doubt, the media plays an important role in a democratic
society and acts as the fourth estate outside the Government
but where freedom of press can be envisaged as a special
right under Art. 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India, the
restrictions under Article 19 (2) cannot be neglected. It is true
that accountability is the sine qua non of democracy and that
the basic postulate of accountability is that people should
have the information about the working of the Government, it
is here that the role of media becomes significant. It is said
that with great power comes great responsibility, therefore
the freedom under Article 19(1) (a) is correlative with the duty
not to violate any law. All sting operations involve making
people commit crimes that they otherwise may not have
committed. There can be no second thought about the fact
that the media is well within its domain when it seeks to use
tools of investigative journalism to bring us face to face with
the ugly underbelly of the society but entrapment of any

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

person should not be resorted to and cannot be permitted
unless a right approach is taken which is in accordance with
law of the land.
46. The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is a social legislation to
curb illegal activities of Public Servants and should be liberally
construed so as advance its object as provided in State of M.P.
v. Ram Singh 2000 SCC (Cri.) 886. The relevant observations
are noted in para 8 of the aforesaid judgment which is
reproduced as under:
“Corruption is termed as a plague which is
not only contagious, but is not controlled,
spreads like fire in the jungle. Its virus is
compared with HIV leading to AIDS, being
incurable. It has also been termed as royal
thievery. The Socio-Political system exposed
to such a dreaded communicable disease is
likely to crumble under its own weight.
Corruption is opposed to democracy and
social order, being not only anti-people but
aimed and targeted against them. It affects
the economy and destroys the cultural
heritage. Unless nipped in bud at the earliest,
it is likely to cause turbulence-shaking of the
socio-economic-political
system
in
an
otherwise healthy, wealthy, effective and
vibrating society.”
47. Section 24 of the said Act comes to the rescue of such
persons/bribe

givers

who

make

a

statement

in

any

“proceedings” against a public servant for an offence under
Sections 7 to 11 or under Section 13 or Section 15 of the Act
to the effect that he had offered or agreed to offer
gratification (other than legal remuneration) or any valuable
thing to the public servant. In such a case, the statement
cannot be made as the basis for prosecution of such a person

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 32 of 38

for the offence of abetment under Section 123 of the said Act.
Section 24 the said Act reads as under:
24. Statement by bribe-giver not to
subject him to prosecution.
Notwithstanding anything contained in any
law for the time being in force, a statement
made by person in any proceeding against a
public servant for an offence under Sections
7 to 11 or under Sections 13 or Section 15,
that he offender agreed to offer any
gratification (other than legal remuneration)
or any valuable thing to the public servant,
shall not subject such person to a
prosecution under Section 12.
It may be noted that whenever a person lodges a complaint
with the police that he has been asked to give bribe which he
is not willing to give, his statement is recorded. Upon the
registration of FIR is investigation is taken up and if so
required, the trap is laid. It is during this investigation and the
trial, the complainant is required to make such statement and
on such statements, he cannot be prosecuted for the offence
of abetment under the Act. Section 24 of the Act, does not
envisage blanket protection to the bribe-giver, under all
circumstances. The immunity for the bribe-giver is provided
where he is unwilling to pay illegal gratification to a public
servant and approaches the police agency, in order to get the
public servant trapped while accepting the bribe.
48. The

petitioners

were

neither

police

officers

nor

were

authorized by anyone to carry out any investigation, therefore,
it cannot be held that they were conducting any “proceedings”
under the Code. The basic requisites for applicability of

Crl. Rev. P. Nos.472 of 2007; 506 of 2007; 546 of 2007 & 584 of 2007

Page No. 33 of 38

Section 24 are not made out and therefore the plea raised by
the accused including accused no. 4 & 5 that they are entitled
to seek protection under the aforesaid section does not hold
good. It cannot be lost sight of that the petitioners had made
two previous attempts to bribe the public servant but on some
pretext, could not succeed and it was purportedly their third
attempt to do the same yet in none of the instances the
matter was reported to any lawful authority. Instead they
made every effort to conceal their identity and evade contact
with investigating agency. I am further constrained to observe
that the petitioners could not have assumed the role of a
knight in the shining armour seeking to reform the society
completely ignoring the legal methodology laid out for
necessary corrective measures including of detection more so
when the action of the petitioners/accused is not on account of
any altruistic motives but is a self serving one.
49. A conspiracy is a continuing offence which continues to subsist
till it is executed or rescinded or frustrated by choice of
necessity. During its subsistence whenever any one of the
conspirators does an act or series of acts, he would be held
guilty under Section 120-B IPC.
50. The records reveal that accused no. 4 was deeply involved in
the said conspiracy from its inception itself when PW 23 was
relegated with the role which was later played by accused no.

plan/conspiracy can also be reflected from the fact that he
was a close friend of accused no. 5 and was managing the
election campaigning for Congress Party in Chattisgarh.
During the time when this conspiracy was hatched both
accused no. 4 & 5 were staying/meeting at A-4, 6, Aurengzeb
Road, New Delhi. The call analysis shows that all this while
accused no. 4 was in close contact with accused no. 3, 6 and
PW 23 for the purposes of execution of the plan.
51. There is enough evidence collected by the prosecution to
frame accused no. 5 for the offence of abetment and
conspiracy which cannot be discarded at the threshold. It was
at the instance of accused no. 5 that attempts to tarnish the
image of accused no. 1 by way of a sting operation were made
just before the elections for which purpose accused no. 5
abetted accused no. 3, 4 and 6 into the conspiracy. The mens
rea attributable to accused no. 5 is evident from the
testimonies of PW 43 and 23 which disclose that accused no. 5
wanted to use PW 23 in relation to the meeting with accused
no. 1 and that accused no. 5 had enquired about the likely
impact of the plan/ operation on electoral prospects of
Congress Party. It is stated that the entire conspiracy was
financed

With

such

circumstances

prevailing, it would not be difficult to accept the definitive
involvement of accused no. 5 for the reason that the person
who could have been most benefited from the said act was
accused no. 5 who father was a rival of accused no. 1 and

was the Chief Minister of the State of Chattisgarh at that
particular time.
52. The objective to give bribe and secretly record the same was
accomplished. For this purpose, accused no. 5 abetted PW 23
and later accused no. 3. A plan/scheme was embodied in order
to accomplish the aforesaid objective for which PW 22 was
used who had direct link to accused no. 1 and was known to
accused no. 5 and could get the meeting fixed with the
minister. For an offence punishable under Section 120-B, the
prosecution need not necessarily prove that the perpetrators
expressly agreed to do or caused to be done an illegal act; the
agreement may be proved by necessary implication. The
evidence as to the transmission of thoughts sharing the
unlawful act is sufficient. In the present case, accused no. 5
took the assistance of accused no. 4 and 6 to execute the plan
hatched who then initially roped in PW 23 and later
substituted him with accused no. 3. Hence, there was an
agreement or understanding between the accused persons
whereby, they became committed to co-operate for the
accomplishment of the aforesaid objective by the means of
secretly video recording accused no. 1 in the act of receiving
illegal gratification.
53. One who commits an overt act with knowledge of the
conspiracy is guilty. And one who tacitly consents to the object
of a conspiracy and goes along with other conspirators,
actually standing by while the others put the conspiracy into

effect, is guilty though he intends to take no active part in the
crime. The aforesaid principle is relevant in so far as accused
no. 6 is concerned. Accused no. 6 is stated to be a
businessman who had substantial business interests in the
State of Chattisgarh including M/s. Akash Channels Pvt. Ltd.
He was a higher functionary authority in the channel where
the controlling interests laid in the hands of accused no. 5.
The argument advanced by the learned counsel for accused
no. 6 that accused no. 6 should be granted benefit/ relief as
was granted to PW 23 lacks strength. It is true that accused
no. 6 had booked a room at the Hotel Taj Palace on 25-072003 during which period it was PW 23 who had agreed to
play the role of accused no. 3 of giving bribe to accused no. 1.
But subsequently on the decision of PW 23, to detach himself
from the said conspiracy, accused no. 3 was brought into said
conspiracy by accused no. 6 at the behest of accused no. 5. It
may also be significant to note that accused no. 3 was given
employment in Akash Channel by accused no. 6 and 5 only. It
is here that the part played by accused no. 6 differs from PW
23 and assumes greater significance where it may be noticed
that accused no. 6 had his hands fully cloaked in the
conspiracy. The conspiracy inter alia PW 23 was abandoned on
28-07-2003 but that by itself cannot work in favour of accused
no. 6. It may be true that accused no. 6 did not play an active
role in the plan hatched subsequent to 28-07-2003 and was
just standing by along with other conspirators while the others

put the conspiracy into effect but that can be surfaced only
during the trial proceedings, this is not the stage to assume
that accused no. 6 withdrew himself from the same. Thus, in
my considered view, the trial court has rightly framed charges
against accused no. 6 for the offence of abetment and
conspiracy.
54. In view of the aforesaid, the correctness, legality and propriety
of the order framing charges against the accused/petitioners
cannot be doubted.
55. Dismissed.
