1.
M/s Steel Authority of India Limited (hereinafter
referred to as the 'plaintiff') has filed this suit for recovery of a sum
of Rs.5,51,74,220/- with interest on account of two dishonoured
cheques. The said suit has been filed in terms of Order XXXVII of
the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code). The defendants have filed an
CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 1 of 19

application under Order XXXVII Rule 3(5) of the Code praying for
grant of leave to defend the said suit.
2.

The plaintiff is engaged in the manufacture of Iron and

Steel materials through its various steel plants located in the State
of Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal. The Iron and
Steel materials produced by the plaintiff are marketed through its
various Regional, Branch Sales Offices and Customer Contact
Offices situated in different parts of the country and having one of
such of its Customer Contact Office at Resham Mill Road, Birla
Nagar, Gwalior (M.P). The defendant no.1 M/s Rohini Strips Ltd., a
limited company duly incorporated under the Companies Act having
its corporate and Head Office at New Delhi through defendants no. 3
to 5 who were also the Directors of defendant no.1 were dealing in
Iron and Steel Materials and they needed supply of Iron and Steel
materials from the plaintiff. It is stated that in consideration of the
plaintiff supplying the materials to the defendant no.1, defendants
no. 2 to 5 gave personal guarantees as a security for the due
payment of the amount due and outstanding along with interest in
respect of the goods sold and delivered to the defendant no.1 by the
plaintiff.
3.

The plaintiff is alleged to had supplied Iron and Steel

CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 2 of 19

materials of various quality on credit which were duly received and
accepted by the defendant no.1. The plaintiff is alleged to had
supplied goods worth Rs.2,45,78,845/- to defendant no.1 during the
period from August, 1997 till December, 1998. An adjustment of
Rs.4,48,692/- was given on account of various credit/debit notes
issued by the plaintiff to the defendant no.1 from time to time. After
giving adjustment of the said amount, Rs. 2,41,30,153/- remain to be
paid by defendant no.1 to the plaintiff towards price of the goods and
Rs.1,21,68,443/- became due and payable on account of interest till
16.3.2000. In order to liquidate its liability the defendant no.1 gave
two cheques, one for Rs.2,41,31,153/- and the other for Rs.1,21,68,
443/- to the plaintiff towards price of goods and interest accrued
thereon vide its covering letter dated 16.3.2000. Both these cheques
were returned unpaid when presented for encashment vide return
memo of the bank dated 1.6.2000. The plaintiff thereafter sent a
legal notice dated 6/8.6.2000 under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act , 1881 to the defendants to which they did not give
any reply. The plaintiff, therefore, filed criminal complaints in the
Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gwalior (M.P) against the
defendants for committing offence under Section 138 read with 141
of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (as amended) and under
CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 3 of 19

Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The said complaints are stated
to be still pending. The two cheques as referred above which were
given by defendant no.1 to the plaintiff were towards price of the
goods purchased by defendant no.1 from the plaintiff as mentioned
in Para 7 of the plaint. Since the defendants did not pay the amount
due from them despite service of legal notice dated 15.5.2003 upon
them, the need arose for filing of the present suit filed under Order
XXXVII CPC.
4.

It is stated that an amount of Rs.3,62,98,596/-was due

and outstanding from the defendants as on 16.3.2000. The plaintiff
has also claimed interest on the aforementioned amount at the rate
of 25% p.a w.e.f 17.3.2000 till the date of payment. It is stated that a
further amount of Rs.1,92,71,067/- became due to the plaintiff on
account of interest for the period from 17.3.2000 till the date of filing
of the present suit. As such the plaintiff has prayed for a decree
against the defendants for Rs. 5,51,74,220/- with pendentelite and
future interest at 25% p.a.
5.

The defendants seek leave to defend the suit inter alia

on the following grounds:
(i) The cheques which the plaintiffs seek to rely in support of its
claim in the suit were issued in blank and only as security. The
CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 4 of 19

amount and the other particulars in these cheques were filled up
by the plaintiff subsequently without consent, knowledge or
approval of the defendants. It is alleged that the cheques in
question were presented by the plaintiff to its banker without
instructions or prior approval of the defendants. In substance, the
plea of the defendants is that they are not bound by the cheques
which are basis of the plaintiff's suit.
(ii)The defendants have also contended that they are entitled to
recover from the plaintiff an amount more than Rs.3.80 crores on
account of Central Excise, MODVAT and conversion charges. The
plea of the defendants in this regard is that they had to pay
Central Excise and MODVAT charges in respect of purchases
made by defendant no.1 from the plaintiff from September, 1994
to January, 1995 because of the plaintiff's failure to furnish
various particulars and documents which are as under:
(a) The details of buyer and manufacture which is essential under
rule 57GG of Central Excise Rule 1944.
(b) Duplicate for Transporter as valid documents for the purpose
of taking Modvat Credit under Rule 52A of Central Excise Rule
1944.
6.

According

CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

to

the

defendants,

they

had

to

pay

Page 5 of 19

Rs.1,01,00,347/- as Central Excise on account of Modvat amount,
interest and penalty due to above default on the part of the plaintiff.
This liability is alleged to be besides 100% penalty on the
aforementioned amount of Rs.1,01,00,347/- as interest thereon. The
defendant no.1 is also alleged to had carried out the work of
conversion for the plaintiff. According to the defendants, the plaintiff
also became liable to pay conversion charges to the defendant no.1.
7.

The case of the defendants is that in case they are

granted leave to defend the suit, they will show that it is they who
are entitled to recover from the plaintiff instead of plaintiff asking
for a decree for the suit amount against them.
8.

I have heard arguments of learned counsel of both the

parties on the instant leave to defend application and have also
perused the entire record carefully.
9.

The defendants have raised two fold defence to the suit

for recovery filed against them by the plaintiff. Their first attack is
on the cheques which are the basis of the plaintiff's suit. The
defendants have alleged that the cheques in question given by them
to the plaintiff were given when they were blank

and that the

amount and other particulars in these cheques were filled up by the
plaintiff subsequently. In substance, the defendants are denying
CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 6 of 19

their liability under the cheques in question. This defence of the
defendants shall be dealt with afterwards. We first consider and
examine the second defence relating to certain amount allegedly due
to the defendants from the plaintiff.
10.

The contention of the defendants in defence to the suit is

that the plaintiff also owes more than Rs.4 crores to the defendants
towards Central Excise, Modvat amount and conversion charges.
The amount alleged to be due to the defendants from the plaintiff
under this head is in respect of purchases made by them for the
plaintiff from September, 1994 to January, 1995. The defendants
admittedly did not make any claim or counter claim against the
plaintiff either on account of Modvat amount, Central Excise or
conversion charges till date or while filing leave to defend
application to defend the present suit. The plaintiff has denied its
liability to pay any amount to the defendants towards Modvat
amount, Central Excise or conversion charges as mentioned in the
leave to defend application. The claim, if any, of the defendants in
regard to the above on the face of it has by now become barred by
limitation and cannot be entertained. Hence, the defence raised by
the defendants in regard to the amount allegedly due and
outstanding from the plaintiff on account of Modvat, Central Excise
CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 7 of 19

or conversion charges does not raise any triable issue requiring leave
to defend to be granted to defend the present suit.
11.

Reverting to the main defence of the defendants to the

claim of the plaintiff in the present suit, one needs to refer to the
correspondence that exchanged between the parties when there was
no dispute between them. It is generally believed that a man can lie
but not the circumstances. The defence intended to be set up by the
defendants that they had issued blank cheques to the plaintiff on the
face of the record appears to be sham, illusionary, moonshine and an
afterthought. The two cheques one for Rs.2,41,31,153/- and the
second for Rs.1,21,68, 443/- both dated 16.3.2000 were given by
defendant no.1 to the plaintiff along with a covering letter annexed
therewith. It shall be pertinent to refer to the letter of the defendant
no.1 dated 16.3.2000 addressed to the plaintiff by which cheques in
question were given and the said letter reads as under :
“This refers to our huge overdue
outstanding of Rs.3,62,98,575.00 (Rupees
Three Crore Sixty Two Lakh Ninety Eight
Thousand Five Hundred Seventy Five Only)
in respect of the Principal Amount as well as

The defendants have not denied the aforementioned

letter in their leave to defend application. They have not whispered
even a word as to how and under what circumstances the said letter
reached upto the plaintiff. If the contents of the aforementioned
letter of defendant no.1 are to be accepted then it is difficult to
believe the contention of the defendants that the cheques in question
given by them to the plaintiff were blank when they were so given.
The plaintiff has also placed on record certain other correspondence
that exchanged between the parties before filing the present suit. A
perusal of all these documents would show that the defendant no.1
has expressly admitted its liability towards the plaintiff and had
given repeated assurances to the plaintiff to clear its dues shortly. It
CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 9 of 19

appears that the defendants have not honoured their commitment
contained in these letters written by them to the plaintiff. Even
during the pendency of the present suit, the defendant no.1 assured
the plaintiff to clear its outstandings and in this regard reference is
made to the proceedings of this Court dated 10.11.2005. On
12.10.2004 the defendant no.1 sent its offer to the plaintiff in writing
by which it offered to clear its liability in a time bound schedule.
This letter of defendant no.1 written to the plaintiff on 12.10.2004
reads as under :
“With reference to our Proposal dated
November, 4, 2003 revised proposal dated
Feb., 28, 2004 dated 3rd September, 2004
and October, 6, 2004 and subsequent
meetings and discussions held with SAIL
officials for the settlement of dues, our
revised proposal is as under:We propose to
pay the principle outstanding till March,
2000.
1. We propose to pay a down
payment of Rs.35.00 lacs.
2. We propose to pay Rs.1000
PMT
on
purchase
of
H.R.Coils from SAIL subject
to a minimum of Rs.15.00
lacs per month.
3. The amount paid may
kindly be adjusted towards
the principle outstanding.
4. Regarding interest, it is
submitted that the company
has faced very hard time
and has accumulated heavy
CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 10 of 19

losses. The company has
paid huge amount of
interest to SAIL at very
high rate of interest. We
therefore request to kindly
calculate the interest at
7.5% on simple method
basis and we are ready to
pay the interest as proposed
from the date of delivery
orders
against
which
unpaid dues are pending.
We also request you to kindly
extend your co operation as under:
We may be given 2000 ton HR Coils per
month regularly to run the plant
uninterrupted. If SAIL finds it difficult to
give 2000 tons per month, then we may
be given atleast 1500 ton per month
initially.
All the legal suit/cases criminal/civil may
kindly be withdrawn or may kindly be
kept pending till the entire amount is
paid by us. The Hon'ble concerned court
may also be informed upon approval of
this proposal.
We hope that you will find the above most
suitable and to support your old and loyal
customer, we request you to kindly accord
your approval on the above request to
enable us to deposit the initial amount as
above and to restart the plant at an early
date. We shall be obliged for your cooperation in this regard. The above is
without prejudice.

The conditions for accepting the offer of defendant no.1 as

contained in the plaintiff's aforementioned letter dated 29.1.2005

CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 13 of 19

were accepted by defendant no.1 vide its letter dated 3.2.2005 which
reads as follows:
“We thankfully acknowledge the receipt of
your letter no.SAIL/GWA/04-05/1093 dated
29.01.2005 which was received in our office
on 02/02/2005, accepting our proposal to

of funds may take some time, and we hope
that the funds will be arranged very soon,

Thanking you,
Yours faithfully,
sd/Director”
15.

The defendant no.1 thereafter acted upon its offer and paid Rs.

35 lacs to the plaintiff by means of four demand drafts, three of Rs. 9
lacs each and the fourth of Rs.8 lacs sent vide its covering letter
dated 30.3.2005. After paying Rs.35 lacs the defendants are stated to
be have not paid even a single penny to the plaintiff in terms of their
compromise. At no point of time the defendants ever averred that
the cheques in question on the basis of which the present suit was
filed was given by them in blank. It shall be significant to mention
that the defendants in Para 36 of their leave to defend application

CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 14 of 19

have admitted purchase of raw material from the plaintiff under the
invoices referred to in Para 7 of the plaint. It is not the case of the
defendants that they had paid for the price of the goods purchased
by them from the plaintiff. They have also not pointed out any entry
in the statement of account which according to them may be
incorrect.
16.

Mr.Anand appearing for the defendants had referred to

a judgment of the Supreme Court in Santosh Kumar vs. Bhai
Mool Singh, (1958) SCR 1211 and on the strength of this judgment
he had contended that the defendant is entitled to grant of leave to
defend in a suit based on bounced cheques where the plea of
defendants is that the said cheques were given by them only as a
collateral security for the price of the goods supplied. This judgment,
in my view, is not applicable to the facts of the present case. In
Santosh Kumar's case (supra) the defence of the defendant was
that he had made cash payment of the goods purchased by him from
the plaintiff and the cheques which were bounced were given only as
collateral security for the price of the goods supplied. In the present
case, there is no such defence set up by the defendants that they had
made either cash payment or payment by any other mode towards
price of goods purchased by them from the plaintiff from time to
CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 15 of 19

time. Furthermore, in the case relied upon by the defendants'
counsel, there is no document at the time of grant of leave to defend
to ascertain as to whether the cheques in question were given
towards price of goods or as collateral security. Under these
circumstances, it was held that the plea raised by the defendant
raises a triable issue and entitle him to grant of leave
unconditionally.
17.

In the present case, there is overwhelming evidence on

record to show that the cheques in question were given by the
defendant no.1 to the plaintiff towards price of the goods and since
these cheques were returned unpaid, this entitled the plaintiff to
seek recovery against the defendants under Order XXXVII CPC. The
defence set up by the defendants that the cheques in question were
given by defendant no.1 to the plaintiff while they were blank and as
collateral security is apparently an afterthought and seems to has
been raised only to avoid liability of the defendants as long as they
can.
18.

Mr.Anand appearing for the defendants had also argued

that the suit filed by the plaintiff against the defendants is barred
by limitation having been filed beyond three years from the date of
issuance of cheques issued on 16.3.2000. The present suit was filed
CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 16 of 19

by the plaintiff on 23.5.2003. The cheques on the basis of which
present suit was filed are dated 16.3.2000. These cheques were
returned unpaid to the plaintiff vide bank memo dated 1.6.2000. The
copies of bank memos in this regard are at Pages 137 and 139 of the
document file. I am of the considered view that the limitation would
commence to run from the date when the cheques in question were
returned unpaid to the plaintiff. Since in this case the cheques in
question were admittedly returned unpaid to the plaintiff on the
ground 'not arranged for' on 1.6.2006, the present suit filed on
23.5.2003 is to be taken as filed within limitation. Hence, the
objection regarding limitation taken by the defendants has no merit.
19.

The defendant no.1 is the principal borrower in the

sense that the goods were purchased by defendant no.1 company
from the plaintiff from time to time. Defendants no.2 to 5 have been
sued in their capacity as guarantors. The copy of personal guarantee
executed by defendants 2 and 3 in favour of the plaintiff on
20.5.1997 is at Page 8 and the copy of personal guarantee executed
by defendants 4 and 5 in favour of the plaintiff on 29.4.1998 is at
Pages 9 and 10 of the document file. These guarantees have been
perused by me. Since defendants no.2 to 5 had stood personal
guarantee on behalf of defendant no.1 for repayment of its dues to
CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 17 of 19

the plaintiff, their liability to pay is co-extensive, joint and several
with the liability of defendant no.1.
20.

In view of the above, I am convinced with the plaintiff's

contention that the defence as disclosed by the defendants in their
leave to defend application is sham and illusory and in my
considered opinion the defendants are not entitled for leave to
defend the present suit and the plaintiff is entitled to have the
judgment signed. Accordingly, the application under Order XXXVII
Rule 3(5) CPC of the defendants is held to be devoid of any merit
and the same is hereby dismissed.
21.

It is contemplated under Order XXXVII Rule 3(5) CPC

that if an application for leave to defend the suit has been made by
the defendants and the same is refused, the plaintiff shall be
entitled to have the judgment signed forthwith. In the present case,
since the application of the defendants under Order XXXVII Rule
3(5) CPC has been dismissed as the defendants have failed to raise
any triable issue or disclose any defence in their application, in my
considered opinion, the plaintiff has become entitled to have the
decree for the suit amount forthwith. Accordingly, suit of the
plaintiff is hereby decreed with costs. The plaintiff is held entitled to
a decree in the sum of Rs.5,51,74,220/- against the defendants.
CS(OS) No. 1252/2003

Page 18 of 19

However, since the plaintiff has failed to establish its claim of
interest at 25% p.a which he has claimed at the market rate for
commercial transaction, I am inclined to award interest at the
prevalent rate only at 12% p.a on the decreetal amount from the
date of institution of the present suit till realization. Decree sheet be
prepared. Needless to say that the defendants shall be entitled to
the adjustment of Rs.35 lacs paid by them to the plaintiff during the
pendency of the suit or to any other amount that they might have
paid to the plaintiff after the filing of the present suit.
