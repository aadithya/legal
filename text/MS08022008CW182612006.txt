CORAM:
HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJIV KHANNA
1.Whether reporters of local papers may be
allowed to see the Judgment ? yes
2. To be referred to the Reporter or not? yes
3.Whether the Judgment should be reported in the Digest? yes
DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ :
1.

By this common judgment we propose to dispose of all these

writ petitions which are referred to us by the learned Single Judge
by order dated 10th July, 2007 and also the Letters Patent Appeals
arising out of the order dated 16th January, 2007 passed by the
learned Single Judge disposing of the writ petitions of similar
nature.
2.

The writ petitioners and the respondents in the appeals are

either owners of land taken on lease by the oil companies for
running petroleum retail outlets, Maintenance and Handling
Contractors (for short ‘M&H Contractors’) or ad hoc dealers who
were awarded the contract for running the said outlets under
supervision of the oil companies. When the oil companies sought to
allot/assign the retail outlets in terms of their policy, the land
owners and in some cases M&H Contractors and adhoc dealers
filed writ petitions. WP(C) No.358/2007 titled Nand Kishore Bajpai
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.29 of 88

& Others v. M/s. IBP Co. Limited was disposed of by the learned
Single Judge by a brief order dated 16th January, 2007 holding thus:
“The only question to be considered is as to
whether the petrol pump located on the land of
petitioner No.1 and being run by petitioner No.2
can be assigned or transferred to any third party
by the oil company on the land of petitioner No.1
without the consent of petitioner No.1.
Indisputably the answer to this question would be
in the negative. The oil companies are free to
deal with their contract in accordance with law
but cannot assign the running of the petrol pump
to a third party on the land of petitioner No.1
without the consent of petitioner No.1. This is so
as the land of a citizen cannot be taken away
except in accordance with law.
The petition stands disposed of.”
3.

As against the aforesaid order passed by the learned Single

Judge an appeal was filed in this Court which was registered as LPA
No.158/2007.
4.

After the disposal of the aforesaid writ petition, many other

writ petitions were listed before another learned Single Judge of
this Court who heard arguments of the counsel appearing for the
parties. Decision in the case of Nand Kishore Bajpai’s case (supra)
was relied upon by the counsel appearing for the land owners/M&H
Contractors in support of their contentions.

After considering the

facts and legal issues that arose for consideration, the learned

(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.30 of 88

Single Judge recorded that he has difficulty in accepting the
general observations and findings of the learned Single Judge in
Nand Kishore Bajpai’s case that :
“The oil companies are free to deal with their
contract in accordance with law but cannot assign
the running of the petrol pump to a third party on
the land of petitioner No.1 without the consent of
petitioner No.1.”
5.

The learned Single Judge by his detailed order passed on

10th July, 2007 held that the aforesaid finding would not hold good
where the lessees themselves have permitted sub-letting by
incorporating specific clauses in that regard in the leases which are
part of the record and relied upon.

After recording his

disagreement with the earlier decision in the case of Nand Kishore
Bajpai, the learned Single Judge referred to the decision of the
Supreme Court in Vijay Laxmi Sadho (Dr.) v. Jagdish reported
in (2001) 2 SCC 247 wherein the Supreme Court held as follows:
“It is well settled that if a Bench of coordinate
jurisdiction disagrees with another Bench of
coordinate jurisdiction whether on the basis of
“different arguments” or otherwise on a question
of law, it is appropriate that the matter be
referred to a larger Bench for resolution of the
issue rather than to leave two conflicting
judgments to operate creating confusion. It is
not proper to sacrifice certainty of law. Judicial
decorum, no less than legal propriety, forms the
basis of judicial procedure and it must be
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.31 of 88

6.

respected at all costs.”
The learned Single Judge has referred all writ petitions to a

Division Bench for adjudication, so as to avoid conflicting
judgments. Consequently, we have taken up these writ petitions
and also the Letters Patent Appeals for consideration and heard
counsel for the land owners, M&H Contractors, adhoc dealers as
well as the four Public Sector Oil Companies namely, Bharat
Petroleum

Corporation

Limited

(BPCL),

Hindustan

Petroleum

Corporation Limited (HPCL), Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL)
and IBP Company Limited.

petitions was also raised at the time of arguments before the
learned Single Judge and the said issue was argued before the
learned Single Judge along with the contentions raised on merits of
the writ petitions. When these matters were taken up by us it was
submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners that
legality of the policy decision of the respondents will have to be
decided either by this Court or by some other Court and therefore,
it would be appropriate if these matters which raise issues
regarding policy matters of the respondents could be decided by
this Court without going into the issue of territorial jurisdiction. We
accepted the aforesaid proposition made at the time of hearing of
the writ petitions as the head offices and registered offices of the
four oil companies are located in Delhi and same issues and
contentions arise for consideration in all cases. Therefore, we
propose to dispose of these cases on merit and refrain from
considering the issue with regard to want of territorial jurisdiction
particularly when the counsel appearing for the parties have
without reservation advanced lengthy arguments on the issues
arising on merits of the writ petitions. To be fair to the counsel, the
four oil companies did not press the objection to territorial
jurisdiction strongly. They too are interested in early disposal of

The

above

oil

companies

had

in

some

cases

issued

advertisements or invited offers from landowners for leasing out
their lands to the oil companies for the purpose of setting up
petroleum retail outlets and in other cases the land was taken on
lease directly. Separate contracts or lease deeds were entered into
between the oil companies and the land owners. Rate of rent was
negotiated

and

rent

was

settled

depending

upon

location,

area,volume of traffic, etc. Salient clauses of the lease deeds are
as under:
“IV. 1. The Lessee shall have full liberty to assign,
transfer or sublet the demised premises or any
part thereof without restriction and without
reference to the lessors.
............
4.
Notwithstanding anything herein before
contained if the Lessee for any reason wishes to
terminate this lease at any time during the said
term it shall be at liberty to do so on giving the
Lessors one month’s notice in writing of its
intention in that behalf and then, in such a case
immediately on the expiration of the period of
such notice this lease shall terminate and
everything herein contained shall cease and be
void and the Lessee shall have the right to
remove all such building, structures, boundary
walls, plants, tanks, fixtures, fittings or other
appliances as may have been and/or shall be put
or erected by it on the demised premised at its
own cost.
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.51 of 88

10.

Thereafter, separate contracts for maintaining and handling

the retail outlets set up on the leased lands were entered into by
the companies, with these contractors who came to be referred to
as M&H contractors. These contracts are for a limited period as has
been mentioned in the respective contract agreements.

These

retail outlets are called “Company Owned Company Operated” or
COCO, though in actual practice the outlets were being operated
and run by M&H Contractors. The salient clauses of M&H Contracts
are as under:
“28. The M&H Contractor in consideration of the
services to be rendered under this Agreement will
be paid lump sum contractual charges of Rs.---per month for an initial period of three months
(quarter) from -----to ----. Thereafter the monthly
lump sum contractual charges for each quarter
will be based on monthly average sales proceeds
of three months. This monthly lump sum
contractual charge payable to the M&H
Contractor for the said quarter will be based on
monthly average sales of immediately preceding
three months and would remain static for each
month of the quarter, irrespective of fluctuations
in sales volume of each month. The lump sum
contractual charges as above for the month
would be paid to the M&H Contractor by 10th day
of following month.
.....
48. The agreement will be effective from ---to --subject to the renewal by one year at the
Company’s option at the same rates, and on the
same terms and conditions as are herein

contained. Without prejudice to the aforesaid,
this Agreement maybe terminated at the option
of either party by giving at least one month’s
notice in writing to the other party, without
assigning any reason whatsoever in case of
breach of contract the Company reserves the
right to terminate this Agreement forthwith.
Unless otherwise mentioned or renewed in
writing this Agreement stands automatically
terminated at the end of the agreement period if
any information given by the M&H Contractor in
his application for appointment shall be found to
be untrue or incorrect, in material respect, the
Company reserves the right to terminate this
contract forthwith.”
Pursuant to Notification dated 6th September, 2006, the

four oil companies issued advertisements/invited applications for
allotment of the retail outlets.

contentions raised in the writ petitions we find that almost all the

No.P-

19011/9/2001-IOC dated 6th September, 2006 issued by the
Government of India, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, New
Delhi, mainly on the ground that the same is not applicable to the
cases of the land owners/M&H Contractors inasmuch as allegedly
the petitioners or their nominees were given retail outlets under
‘land owner category’ in terms of the policy

guidelines for

selection of retail outlets/dealers in the de-regulated scenario,
relying upon policy No. 319/02 dated 8th October, 2002. In the writ

(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.53 of 88

petitions the petitioners have also sought for an order restraining
the oil companies from enforcing/implementing the Notification
dated 6th September, 2006.

In the alternative, it is also prayed

that if the aforesaid reliefs are not granted, at least an order should
be passed directing the oil companies to surrender to the land
owners the land taken on lease from them with a further direction
that the land owners should be put in actual physical possession of
the said lands which were assigned to the oil companies.
12.

The Notification dated 6th September, 2006, issued by

the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas and addressed to oil
companies, reads as under:
“Sub: Operation of retail outlets of OMCs on
COCO basis:
“1. I am directed to state that in order to
provide commercial freedom to the public sector
oil
marketing
companies
(OMCs),
post
Administered Pricing mechanism regime in the
petroleum sector, it was decided by this Ministry
vide its letter of even number dated 9.9.2003
that the OMCs would formulate their own policy
and procedure for operating those retail outlets,
where sites had been procured and facilities
created, or which had been decommissioned
because of termination of dealerships, on
Company-Owned-Company-Operated (COCO)/ad
hoc basis till regular dealers were appointed.
However, this could not be formulated by the
OMCs uniformly on industry basis so far. The
matter has been in consideration for a long time
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.54 of 88

and a number of discussions were held in the
Ministry, at different levels, with the OMCs.
2.
With a view to finalising the guidelines,a
meeting was again taken by this ministry on
19.7.2006, under the Chairmanship of Hon’ble
Minister of State (Petroleum & Natural Gas), with
the Chief Executives and other officers of the
OMCs, where a ‘presentation’ on the subject was
made by BPCL on behalf of the OMCs. Minutes of
the meeting have been circulated to all
concerned vide this Ministry’s letter NO.R30024/17/2006-MC, dated 27.7.2006. Based on
the deliberations in the said meeting and meeting
taken by Secretary (P&NG) on 25.7.2006 and
various discussions held earlier, it has been
decided to lay down the following broad
parameters, on the basis of which the OMCs may
finalise their guidelines for operation of companyowned-company-operated (COCO) retail outlets.
(i)
While the OMCs may operate permanent
COCO retail outlets (.i.e. Flagship ROs, Jubilee
Retail Outlets, Model Outlets, etc) by their own
officers (without job-contractors or ad hoc
dealers), they should phase out the existing
temporary COCO retail outlets within a time
preferably within a year. However, in special
circumstances like court cases, complaints, etc,
they may have to operate some ROs on
temporary COCO basis till final decision on those
court cases/complaint.
(ii) The permanent COCO retail outlets should
be operated by an officer of the OMC concerned
being in overall charge of the outlet. If the OMCs
so like, they may post their own personnel for
running the permanent COCO ROs. In that case,
no labour contractor should be appointed. In
case OMCs are not able to deploy sufficient
number of their own staff, the balance manpower
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.55 of 88

requirement may be arranged through a labour
contractor. The OMCs should stops jobcontractorship or ad hoc dealership for operating
permanent COCO ROs and follow the model
stated above or shift their such ROs into the
category of temporary COCOs within a period of
one month.
(iii) Selection of labour contractors should be in
an open and transparent manner through
advertisements only.
OMCs should adopt
objective parameters for evaluation of candidates
for labour contractorship.
These parameters
should be uniform for all the OMCs. The labour
contractor should not be asked to invest in
working capital as the working capital has to be
arranged by the OMC concerned for running of
COCO Ros.
(iv) For the permanent COCO ROs the labour
contractorship may preferably be given for a
period of three years in the first instance, instead
of the one year system being followed at present.
After three years, the labour contractorship may
again be advertised for selection.
(v) As regards temporary COCO retail outlets,
the period of the labour contract should not
exceed one year, by which time the action for
appointment of dealers for the COCO Ros in
question should be completed. Even for this
period, the labour contractors, should be
selected in the same open and transparent
manner by advertisement, as a labour contractor
is to be selected for a permanent COCO outlet.
(vi) The phasing out of temporary COCO ROs
preferably within a year may be completed as
follows:
The temporary COCO ROs, may first be

(e) The industry may pool their available
temporary COCO Ros for offering to the
categories under (a)& (b) above. In case no LOI
holder under these categories are available, then
these dealerships should be advertised for
selection of dealers under normal process.
(vii) The OMCs should stop job contractorship or
ad hoc dealership for operating the temporary
COCO ROs also. The system of ad hoc dealership
may be resorted to only in cases of dealerships
which have been terminated and where new
dealers are to be appointed. The period of ad
hoc dealership should not in any case be more
than four months as ad hoc dealership violates
the multiple dealership norms. If the dealer can
not be appointed within this period of four
months, the RO may be taken over by the OMC
concerned and operated as temporary COCO with

Till 31st March, 2002 only Public Sector Oil Companies were

entitled to market petroleum products in retail. With effect from 1st
April, 2002 Administered Price Mechanism (APM for short) was to
be dismantled. Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gases chaired a
meeting on 8th October, 1999 to frame and ensure that Public
Sector Oil companies were able to meet the challenge and face
competition after dismantling of APM with effect from 1 st April,
2002. It was noticed on dismantling of the APM, Dealer Selection
Board would be dissolved and certain amount of freedom had to
be given to the oil companies to frame and follow their own
policies to be competitive.

(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.58 of 88

14.

Accordingly in 1999 guidelines were framed by the Ministry of

Petroleum and Natural Gases to ensure that the Public Sector Oil
Companies were able to meet challenges post dismantling of APM
with effect form 1st April, 2002. It was decided in 1999 that the Oil
companies would purchase land or take land on long lease and set
up petrol pumps and operate their own retail outlets.

These

outlets are called in the oil company parlance as “company-ownedcompany-operated” outlets or “COCO” outlets. It was felt that the
COCO outlets would enhance the image of the public sector oil
companies as there would be strict adherence of quality norms and
quantity supplied to the retail customers. As the outlet was owned
or on long lease with the public sector oil companies, it would not
be possible for the private players to entice, woo and take over
COCO outlets. The Ministry, therefore, formulated a policy in 1999
to purchase land or take land on long lease and establish COCO
outlets. To ensure strict monitoring of quality and quantity of retail
sales, a sales officer of the concerned oil company was to be
entrusted

each COCO

outlet.

The land owners were to be
and M& H contractors were

appointed to operate these outlets.

M&H Contractors or labour

contractors were to be selected independently. It is specifically

Page No.59 of 88

extended after two years.

Thus M&H contract could not be

The restriction on appointment of an

existing dealer, distributor or LOI holder was in accord with the
policy against multiple dealership norms and to ensure that the
public sector oil companies retain effective control over the leased
property. The policy stipulated that M&H contractors will be paid
consideration for providing supporting staff @ Rs.27,500/- per
month for sales volume upto 200 Kiloliters per month. On higher
sale volume, the M&H contractor would be paid higher amount as
per grade formula.

The expenditure for creating infrastructure

and setting up retail outlet was to be incurred by the public sector
oil companies. Stocks were to be supplied on transfer basis.
15.

From the pleadings of the parties it is clear that in some

cases the oil companies had appointed M&H Contractors. In some
cases M&H Contractors were appointed after proper selection but
in some cases M&H Contractors have been appointed without any
selection process. It is also noticed that a few M&H Contractors
were existing dealers or distributors or Letter of Intent holders of
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.60 of 88

the oil companies.

This was contrary to the policy decision of

1999. In some cases in fact oil companies have appointed ad hoc
dealers by calling the retail outlets as temporary COCO retail
outlets. The ad hoc dealers were appointed without any selection
process and invariably were existing dealers or distributors. This
was contrary to multiple dealership norms and, therefore,

they

were conveniently called “temporary COCO retail outlets” and/or
“ad hoc dealerships”, least there is an allegation that the policy of
1999 is violated.
16.

Noticing these draw backs and violation of the policy

decision of 1999, Government of India, Ministry of Petroleum and
Natural Gases issued a Notification dated 6th September, 2006. The
Notification specifically mentioned that public sector oil marketing
companies had not been able to formulate any policy on COCO
outlets and ad hocism was prevailing.
uniformity and consistency.

There was absence of

It was decided that the companies

should operate permanent COCO outlets through their own officers
and no labour contractor should be appointed for permanent COCO
retail outlets. So called temporary COCO outlets are to be phased
out within a period of one year by appointing a dealer or issuing
Letter of Intent.

Dealers or Letter of Intent holders have to be

(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.61 of 88

appointed by selection process as per the criteria mentioned in the
policy dated 6th September, 2006.

During the transitory period,

before regular dealerships are created it has been directed that
labour contractors should be appointed to provide necessary
manpower with certain stipulations and an outer time limit has
been stipulated within which the Notification dated 6th September,
2006 has to be implemented.
17.

It appears that after the APM was dismantled, one oil

company, namely, IBP Company Limited had formulated a policy
dated 8th October, 2002 for appointment of dealers. These policy
guidelines continued till they were suspended in February, 2003
and finally superseded on 19th September, 2003.

It may be

relevant to state here that the other three oil companies namely,
Hindustan

Petroleum

Corporation

Limited,

Bharat

Petroleum

Corporation Limited and Indian Oil Corporation Limited did not
frame such policy as per the stand taken by them.

The M&H

Contractors or ad hoc dealers appointed by these three oil
companies i.e. HPCL, BPCL and IOCL cannot therefore rely upon
the policy guidelines dated 8th October, 2002 framed by IBP
Company Limited.

Relevant clauses of the guidelines of 8th

October, 2002 are as under:

EXISTING JROs/COCOs:

The company is presently operating these

We may decide for
operational reason, to appoint dealers to operate
these JROs/COCOs, taking into account that (i) we
propose to now pay greater focus on expansion
of network (ii) get out of retailing business save a
few selected JROs/COCOs which would be run by
our officers and be flagships of the company.

will be the concerned ED.
The committee
consisting of Head of Division/Marketing Head in
Region/Finance Head in the Region would
recommend such cases to their respective ED
thru their RGMs. The dealership will be offered
first to the landlord subject to his being found
suitable.
In case the landlord declines to take/accept
the dealership, it will be offered to the M&H
contractor. In the event of the M&H contractor
also declining to accept the dealership, the same
will be offered to the best candidate available.
The committee consisting of MHR, concerned
Divisional Head and an Officer in Grade ‘D’ and
above, would constitute the committee to select
the candidate/dealer and recommend to the RGM
for his approval and appointment.”
18.

Category-I of the said guidelines relates to the selection of

dealers who were also land owners.

Land owners could be

selected as dealers provided they were willing to sell or lease their
land to

IBP Company Limited for a period of 15 years with a

renewal option for another 15 years. In such cases after successful
negotiations, a letter of intent was to be issued to the land owner
and on completion of the formalities the said land owner or his/her
nominee

would

be

appointed

as

dealer

and

retail

outlet

commissioned. It is the case of IBP Company Limited that none of
the petitioners had entered into any agreement as dealers of
Category-I under the policy dated 8th October, 2002. It is the case

(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.65 of 88

of IBP Company Limited that land owners had negotiated and
entered into lease deeds with IBP Company Limited leasing out
land to the said public sector oil company. IBP Company Limited
has spent lot of money for creating infrastructure by constructing
buildings, providing dispensing equipments, installing oil tanks etc.
They have also set up service centers.

It is the case of the oil

companies that invariably they have spent between 30 to 50 lakhs
for providing necessary infrastructure, equipments

etc.

It is

pointed out that Category-I dealers mentioned under the policy
dated 8th October, 2002 of the IBP Company Limited were required
to provide infrastructure and spent money constructing petrol
pumps, installing equipments, providing service centres etc. Such
expenditures under Category-I should have been incurred by the
land owner dealer himself as these were not to be COCO outlet, but
land owner dealership outlets.
19.

COCO outlet has been specifically mentioned and dealt with

in the policy decision dated 8th October, 2002. Such dealerships
were to be maintained by the company with M&H Contractors.
However, the policy decision dated 8th October, 2002 also provided
that in case it is decided to appoint dealers for COCO outlets, first
choice and right of refusal would be given to the landlord.
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

The

Page No.66 of 88

above clause in the policy dated 8th October, 2002 in fact shows
that there was difference between Category-I land owner dealers
and COCO outlets. The above policy guidelines were in force only
till February 2003 when these were suspended

and ultimately

superseded by policy dated 18th September, 2003.

Petitioners

cannot claim any right under this policy which was operative only
for a period of four months as the said policy had ceased to be
operative from February, 2003. On the date when dealerships are
being allotted, the said policy was no longer in vogue and
applicable. In any case we are not dealing with any case where IBP
Company Limited had entered into negotiations and decided to
appoint dealers for COCO outlets during the period 8th October,
2002 till February, 2003. It is not the case of the petitioners that
IBP Company Limited had offered dealership during this period. We
may also note here that in majority of the cases lease in question
or negotiations had taken place before or after 8th October, 2002
and February, 2003.
20.

One of the contentions raised by the M&H Contractors was

that they are paying licence fees which a dealer is required to pay
for the dealership rights. On perusal of the facts we find that no
such fees was to be paid by the M&H Contractors, licence fee is
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.67 of 88

payable only by ad-hoc dealers. The term “ad hoc – Dealer” is a
misnomer as far as payment of licence fee is concerned, as in this
respect there is no difference between ad hoc dealers and
permanent dealers, except, but importantly ad hoc dealers have
been appointed without any selection process and contrary to
multiplier dealership norms.

Further, as a means of abundant

clarification, we would like to mention that in case of M&H
contractors, it was the oil companies who were paying them,
decided sums of money to enable them to run the outlet. Thus the
said contention raised by the M&H Contractors is without any
merit.

bound by the Policy Circular dated 8th October, 2002, as it has
been issued by IBP Company and that HPCL has not taken any land
on lease in terms of the said policy. It was brought to our notice
that land was taken on lease by HPCL through advertisements
issued for purchase/lease of land. It was specifically mentioned in
the advertisement that the advertisement was only for taking land
on lease or for purchase and not for offering dealership.

It was

submitted that the petitioners are bound by the clauses of the
lease deed and that the M&H contracts categorically stipulates the
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.68 of 88

period of the agreements. It was also submitted that the similar
petitions filed in various other High Courts have been dismissed.
22.

Learned counsel for IOCL and BPCL reiterated the stand

taken by the other oil companies, including that the Policy Circular
dated 8th October, 2002 is not applicable to them.
23.

It was also submitted that in the present petitions the

Court would be concerned not with the dealership licences but only
with ad hoc licences and Maintenance and Handling (M&H)
contracts. It was further submitted by the counsel appearing for
the respondents that the writ petitions have been filed merely on
the apprehension of issuance of Notification dated 6th September,
2006 and that, as a matter of fact, there is no cause of action that
has arisen in favour of the petitioners at

this stage. It was

contended that none of the petitioners fall within the category of
land owners who had offered their lands specifically for running
dealerships and, therefore, they cannot be said to be in any
manner aggrieved.

The next submission of the counsel for the

respondents was that the concept and principles of legitimate
expectation would not be applicable to the facts and circumstances
of the present cases.
24.

The other disputes raised are mostly matters relating to

(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.69 of 88

disputed questions of fact and, therefore, they should have been
actually raised by filing a suit or by taking resort to arbitration
proceedings wherever parties are governed by arbitration clause.
But as extensive arguments were made before us in the aforesaid
manner with regard to merits of the writ petitions, we have no
other alternative but to decide the aforesaid contentions in these
writ petitions so as to bring a finality to the contentions raised
before us.
25.

On

going

through

the

records

it

is

clear

that

the

advertisements were issued by the oil companies on different
dates pursuant to which lease agreements were entered into
between the petitioners and various oil companies. In some of the
advertisements issued by the oil companies particularly of BPCL, it
carried a note to the effect that the advertisement issued is for
requirement of land only and not for allotment of dealership. Being
fully aware of the implications of the aforesaid condition, the land
owners submitted their applications and on acceptance of their
offers, executed consciously the lease deeds which did not contain
any assurance for creation of any relationship of permanent
dealership under the oil companies.

A bare perusal of the

stipulations in the lease deeds, which also are part of the records,
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.70 of 88

would indicate that none of the aforesaid lease deeds were
executed with the intention of creating any allotment of dealership
but were executed to create lease deeds for taking land for setting
up of retail outlets by the oil companies.

Similarly, the M&H

contracts were entered into only for the purpose of running the
COCO outlet for a limited period, under the supervision of the Sales
Officer of the Oil company concerned. A closer look at the lease
deeds would also make it crystal clear that in all the aforesaid
lease deeds there was a clause granting liberty to the oil
companies to create a sub-lease and that the owner of the land
would not have any objection if someone else is appointed as a
dealer. The said clause is again reproduced below for reference:
“The Lessee shall have full liberty to assign,
transfer or sublet the demised premises or any
part thereof without restriction and without
reference to the Lessor.”
26.

It is clearly established therefrom that the said clause

empowers and authorises the oil companies to transfer the said
property in favour of a third or outside party without any
restriction.

The enabling clause was used by the company to

transfer the said property in favour of a third or outside party to
run the retail outlet on ad hoc/temporary, or M&H Contract basis.

(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.71 of 88

27.

Our attention was also drawn to the policy circular dated 8th

August, 2003 issued by IOC. Relevant clauses of the said policy
circular are reproduced below for reference:
“Indian Oil Corporation Limited (HO Retail sales)
Policy Circular No.58-08/2K3
State Retail Heads

August 8, 2003

Sub: Operation of ROs on COCO basis
This is further to our letter of even no. dated
8.7.2003, on the subject vide which we had
advised that in case of high potential locations,
Land Owner's nominee (within family) can be
appointed as COCO Contractor, without going
through selection process, provided he is found
capable of running the RO effectively.
The primary objective is to garner the targeted
share of sales at such high potential locations.
This objective can only be achieved if we appoint
such individuals/parties as COCO Contractors,who
can run the RO effectively and efficiently at these
locations.
Keeping in view the above in respect of COCO
ROs to be operated by the nominees of land
owners, the following has been decided:
1.0 Landowner's nominees from outside family
will also be permitted to be appointed as COCO
contractors subject to the condition that no
individual/party will be permitted to operate more
than one COCO as Job Contractor, either
individually or on partnership basis.
2.0 The land owner will be permitted to give a
maximum of 3 nominations for the above
purpose. The nominees will be assessed as per
the criteria given in para 10 below and a panel of
2 candidates in order of merit, will be prepared.
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.72 of 88

The No.1 candidate in the merit panel will be
awarded the Job Contract for operation of the
COCO RO.
3.0 Eligibility Criteria
...........
3.2 Existing COCO Contractors will not be eligible
to be appointed as COCO Contractor for another
Retail Outlet.
3.3 An existing RO dealer cannot be appointed
as COCO Contractor for more than one COCO.
Also, an existing dealer will not be permitted to
have one ad hoc dealership and one COCO
contract.
............
4.0 If the performance of the COCO Contractor is
satisfactory, the tenure can be further renewed
on year to year basis beyond the tenure as
stipulated in our letter NO.RO/6060 dated
8.7.2003.
5.0 As and when the policy permits, dealerships
will be awarded to the landowner or his nominee
subject to the terms and conditions as may be
applicable at that time.
6.0 Nomination of a person by the landowner as a
contractor to run the Retail Outlet on COCO basis
does not give any right to the landowner to make
any claims on the Corporation on account of any
acts or deeds or such person.
7.0 IOC will enter into two agreements i.e. one
for acquisition of land with the landowner and the
other one for award of job contract for COCO
operation with the nominee of the landowner.
The claims, responsibilities, obligations etc.,
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.73 of 88

arising out of these two agreements would be
independent and will not have a bearing on the
performance or non-performance of one upon the
other.”
However, the lone Writ Petition where IOC is a party being WP(C)
No. 1285/2007 titled as Rajesh Bora v. UOI,is not covered by the
said policy, on two grounds, firstly, the lease in the instant case
was entered into in July, 2003 and whereas the policy circular was
issued in August of the same year.

Secondly, the policy Clause

No.7.0 clearly specifies that IOC was to enter into agreements for
acquisition of lands with the land owners and not for lease. That
being the case the petitioner in the above-mentioned writ will not
be entitled to benefit of the said policy/circular as he had entered
into lease agreement and not an agreement for acquisition of his
land by the oil company.
28.

It was pointed out during the course of arguments that the

policy dated 8th October, 2002, on which strong

reliance was

placed by the counsel appearing for the petitioners, was issued in
respect of only IBP Company Limited and that there is no such
policy with reference to and concerning the other petroleum
companies. It is the specific case of the respondents that none of
the petitioners had been granted petroleum retail outlets by any of
the oil companies. There could also be no dispute with regard to
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.74 of 88

the fact that there could be no vested or accrued right on any of
the petitioners to be allotted with

dealership licences for any

petroleum retail outlet on the basis of their holding a lease deed or
M&H Contract, unless there was an agreement and a lease deed
was entered into with the said stipulation.

This is not so in the

present cases. Advertisements were issued by the oil companies
seeking applications from the intending persons who were
prepared to lease out their land or there was private negotiations
for taking land on lease. Pursuant to the aforesaid advertisements
or private negotiations, the petitioners offered to lease out their
lands to the oil companies for the purpose of running retail outlets.
The lease deed empowers the oil companies to terminate the lease
at any time during the lease period after giving one month’s notice
to the lessor. The said clause reads as under:
“Notwithstanding
anything
herein
before
contained if the Lessee for any reason wishes to
terminate this Lease at any time during the said
term if shall be at liberty to do so on giving the
Lessor one month’s notice in writing of its
intention in that behalf and then, in such a case,
immediately on the expiration of the period of
such notice this lease shall terminate and
everything herein contained shall cease and be
void and the Lessee shall have the right to
remove all such building, structures, boundary
walls, plants, tanks, fixtures, fittings of other
appliances as may have been and/or shall be put
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.75 of 88

up or erected by it on the demised premises at
its own cost.”
After obtaining the lease deeds as aforesaid, M&H Contract was
executed by the oil companies with a third person, who in some
cases is also one of the petitioners, by executing M&H Contract in
his favour for a limited period of one to two years, to run the outlet
on COCO basis under the supervision of the Sales Officer of the oil
company concerned. M&H contract empowers the oil company to
terminate the agreement/contract at the option of the company by
giving one month’s notice in writing without assigning any reason
whatsoever.
29.

It must be clearly understood that none of the writ petitioners

challenged the legality of any of the notifications, issued by any of
the

oil

companies

or

by

the

Central

Government,

except

notification dated 6th September, 2006. Under the circumstances
we are not required to examine the vires of any of those
notifications/circulars. It is a well settled proposition of law that all
provisions of law and the guidelines in the circular are deemed to
be valid till they are declared invalid by a clear pronouncement.
The courts are inclined to interfere only when the legality of the
said circular/notification are challenged.

Consequently, we have

examined the contents of the various circulars which lay down
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.76 of 88

guidelines and mandate defining and earmarking the extent of
rights that are meant to be given to the petitioners by the oil
companies.
30.

The petitioners have all contended that they have a “vested

right” to be alloted the dealerships of the petrol pumps, that are
being or will be operated out of the lands that they have given on
lease. The said contention cannot be accepted as no where in the
lease deed have the petroleum companies made any express or
implied promise to the effect that the petrol pump dealership shall
be handed to the landlords. In fact, the covenants of the lease
deed suggest to the contrary. It is also pertinent to mention that
the oil companies have incurred a huge amount of expenditure
stated to be in the range of Rs. 30-50 Lacs on the creation of
necessary infrastructure, at the sites selected for the setting up of
the petrol pumps. It is common knowledge that setting up of a
petrol pump involves a huge amount of capital expenditure, on
dispensing equipment, building, storage facilities, etc. In the light
of these facts, it would not be just to hold the oil companies to be
bound by the promises they have never made, either in an express
or implied manner. The term “vested right” has been defined in
Black’s Law Dictionary (6th Edn.) at page 1563 as:
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.77 of 88

“Vested; fixed; accrued; settled; absolute;
complete. Having the character or given the rights
of absolute ownership; not contingent; not subject
to be defeated by a condition precedent.”
The said definition was quoted with approval by the Supreme Court
in Bibi Sayeeda and others v. State of Bihar and others reported in
(1996) 9 SCC 516 and it was observed as under:
“Rights are ‘vested’ when right to enjoyment,
present or prospective, has become property of
some particular person or persons as present
interest; mere expectancy of future benefits, or
contingent interest in property founded on
anticipated continuance of existing laws, does not
constitute
vested
rights.
In
Webster's
Comprehensive Dictionary, (International Edn.) at
page 1397 ‘vested’ is defined as:

31.

“[L]aw held by a tenure subject to no
contingency; complete; established by law as a
permanent right; vested interests.””
It is established from the records and in terms of the

conclusions arrived at upon discussion and appreciation thereof
that what is sought to be created by executing the lease deed was
a jural relationship of landlord and tenant and that there was no
assurance at any point of time by any of the oil companies to any
of the land owners or to any contractor or any licencee of creating
any dealership licence or right. Rights and duties of the landowners
and the oil companies were governed by the lease deeds executed
and COCO and M&H contract licences given and the petitioners
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.78 of 88

have no vested right to claim for execution of dealership licences
in their favour.
32.

We may also refer to letter dated 7th October, 2006 issued by

the Senior Divisional Manager, IBP Company Limited addressed to
Smt. Shama Pravin, a lessor, in reply to her representation for
conversion of COCO outlet to dealership in the states of UP and
Uttaranchal. Paragraph 2 of the said letter states that “according
to the decision conveyed, the temporary COCOs may be offered to
the LOI holders under special scheme (Operation Vijay-Kargil),
Disrectionary

Quota

Scheme,

Corpus

Fund

Scheme,

other

categories in that order and the balance COCOs, if any, will be
advertised for selection of dealers under normal process.

The

petitioners are neither LOI holders nor fall under any special
category to be allotted dealerships on the basis of their lease
deeds. Contract for Maintenance and Handling is entirely a
separate agreement for running the COCO retail outlet under the
supervision of the officers of the oil company.

The retail outlet

shall be owned and operated by the oil company but the persons
engaged in selling the products of the oil company through the
said retail outlet shall be employees of the contractor.

The

agreement specifically mentions that the company appoints the
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.79 of 88

contractors for performing various jobs at the COCO retail outlets
to enable the company to provide services to the public at large.
Under the contract the tenure of the agreement was for a period
of one to two years with a provision for extension by one year. The
oil company is at liberty to terminate the agreement by giving one
month’s notice in writing without assigning any reason whatsoever.
33.

A bare perusal of the writ petitions, particularly the reliefs

which are sought, establish that the writ petitions were filed merely
on the basis of apprehension of Policy Circular dated 6th
September, 2006. The said Circular does not deal with award of
retail outlet dealership at all but deals only with and pertains to the
COCO retail outlets. Such outlets, namely COCO outlets, are run by
the oil companies through its contractors on the land taken on
lease by the oil companies from landowners. It was mentioned in
the said Circular that permanent COCO retail outlets should be
operated by an officer of the company whereas existing temporary
COCO retail outlets should be phased out preferably within a
period of one year. A guideline is only issued by the said Circular
laying down the policy as to how COCO retail outlets are to be
managed

with

clear

guidelines

to

stop

appointing

job

contractors/maintenance and handling contractors for operating
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.80 of 88

permanent COCO retail outlets which are completely different and
separate from retail outlet dealership. Dealership agreement/
licence is completely a different notion and none of the petitioners
hold any such agreement/licence, which is of permanent nature.
Contentions

raised

therefore

are

totally

baseless

and

not

applicable.
34.

The learned counsel for the petitioners have also contended

that the action of the oil companies is liable to be struck down as
they are violative of the legitimate expectation of the parties to get
the dealerships translated into their names. It was contended that
the contracts were given to the nominees/family members of the
lessors and rents were commensurate with the contracts. Learned
counsel for the oil companies on the other hand submitted that
lease agreement and contract agreement are two separate,
distinct agreements, independently entered into by the oil
company, one

for taking the land on lease and the other for

granting contract for the purpose of dispensing the products of the
oil companies under the supervision of the officers of the
concerned oil company.

The advertisements issued by the oil

companies clearly state that the advertisement is for ‘transfer of
plot of land by way of outright sale/lease’ and it nowhere states
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.81 of 88

that it is for allotment of dealership. The terms of the lease are
clear and right to sublet is specifically conferred on the oil
companies. The Policy guidelines dated 4th October, 1999 specifies
that the labour contractor selected for running retail outlet on
COCO basis will not be the landlord or dealer/distributor/LOI holder
of any oil companies. Since the M&H contract is for only a limited
period of one to two years with a provision for extension by
another year, it can be said that it is of temporary nature. When
the contract itself is of a temporary nature, the M&H contractors
cannot claim regular dealerships on the basis of their contracts,
invoking the theory of legitimate expectation. It was held by the
Supreme Court in the case of Municipal Corpn., Chandigarh v.
Shantikunj Investment (P) Ltd. reported in (2006) 4 SCC 109 that
on account of theory of Legitimate Expectation the terms and
conditions of agreement cannot be ignored, the court observed:
“Their Lordships propounded the theory of
legitimate expectation. Legitimate expectation
does not mean illegitimate flight of fancy.
Legitimate expectation means what has been
held out in the terms and conditions of the
auction and the lease deed. Legitimate
expectation and the provisions of the Act cannot
be read together to mean that the terms of the
auction and the lease deed should be ignored.”
Reference can also be made to the case of Bannari Amman Sugars

(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.82 of 88

Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer reported in (2005) 1 SCC 625,
wherein

the

Supreme

Court

held

that

for

legal

purpose,

expectation is not same as anticipation. The court also referring to
the decision of Australian High Court in the case of Attorney
General for New Southwales v. Quinn, reported in (1990) 64 Aust
LJR 327 (Aust HC) observed

:

“15. As observed in Attorney General for New
Southwales v. Quinn to strike the exercise of
administrative power solely on the ground of
avoiding the disappointment of the legitimate
expectations of an individual would be to set the
courts adrift on a featureless sea of pragmatism.
Moreover, the negotiation of a legitimate
expectation (falling short of a legal right) is too
nebulous to form a basis for invalidating the
exercise of a power when its exercise otherwise
accords with law. If a denial of legitimate
expectation in a given case amounts to denial of
right guaranteed or is arbitrary, discriminatory,
unfair or biased, gross abuse of power or
violation of principles of natural justice, the same
can be questioned on the well-known grounds
attracting Article 14 but a claim based on mere
legitimate expectation without anything more
cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these
principles. It can be one of the grounds to
consider, but the court must lift the veil and see
whether the decision is violative of these
principles warranting interference. It depends
very much on the facts and the recognised
general
principles
of
administrative
law
applicable to such facts and the concept of
legitimate expectation which is the latest recruit
to a long list of concepts fashioned by the courts
for the review of administrative action must be
restricted to the general legal limitations
applicable and binding the manner of the future
exercise of administrative power in a particular
case. It follows that the concept of legitimate
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.83 of 88

expectation is “not the key which unlocks the
treasure of natural justice and it ought not to
unlock the gates which shut the court out of
review on the merits”, particularly, when the
elements of speculation and uncertainty are
inherent in that very concept. As cautioned in
Attorney General for New Southwales case the
courts should restrain themselves and respect
such claims duly to the legal limitations. It is a
well-meant caution. Otherwise, a resourceful
litigant having vested interest in contract,
licences, etc. can successfully indulge in getting
welfare
activities
mandated
by
directing
principles thwarted to further his own interest.
The caution, particularly in the changing scenario
becomes all the more important.”
35.

The learned Single Judge in the order dated 10th July, 2007

has

observed

that

the lease

agreement

and

the contract

agreement are with separate petitioners and if they are taken
conjunctively, they do not constitute a promise of allotment of a
retail outlet/petrol pump. The learned Single Judge has also
referred to the clauses of the lease deed and the M&H Contract to
observe that the nature of the leases and the surrounding
circumstances create serious doubts with regard to the claim of the
petitioners. We agree with the observations made by the learned
Single Judge in view of the above discussions.
36.

In view of the aforesaid findings and the conclusions arrived

at by us, we hold that the decision dated 16th January, 2007,
rendered by the learned Single Judge is not good law and the same
(LPA 158/07 & WP(C)18261-63/06 and connected matters)

Page No.84 of 88

is over-ruled by this decision.
37.

However, we have segregated and separated some cases

where there is some doubt that the land owner petitioners had
entered into transactions with the oil companies based on some
understanding or there are other circumstances, which require
separate consideration. Suspicion in some cases has also arisen
due to written communication and file notings of the respondents
oil companies that the lease deed was entered with the objective
that the land owner will be provided dealership. These cases will be
dealt with separately and on their own merits. Details of these
cases are given below:

This abysmally low rent raises the possibility of some sort of
implied promise/understanding having been reached between the
land owners and the oil company concerned with respect to
allotment of dealerships. It is our considered opinion that detailed
affidavits be filed by the parties in the aforesaid two cases, as in
the absence of the same it would not be appropriate to decide
them on merits.
