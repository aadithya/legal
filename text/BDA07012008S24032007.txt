BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J(ORAL)
1.

This is an application under Order 23 Rule 3 read with

Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 jointly filed by the
plaintiffs and the defendants 2 and 5.

The learned counsel for the

plaintiffs states that he has instructions from his clients to not proceed
any further against the defendant Nos. 1, 3 and 4 and no reliefs are
sought against the said defendants.

Insofar as the plaintiffs on the one hand and the remaining

defendants (defendant No.2 and 5) are concerned, they have arrived at a
compromise and/ or settlement. The defendants were using unlicensed
software belonging to the plaintiff without paying any consideration for
the same. It has now been agreed by the said defendants and they
undertake that they will not at any time use unlicensed software of the
plaintiffs or indulge in any act that would amount to infringement of the
plaintiffs' copyright in the various computer programs referred to in
paragraph 2 (b) of the said application. It has also been agreed by the
defendants to purchase the licences in respect of the said softwares
mentioned in paragraph 2(b) for which purpose a total consideration of
Rs 97,72,700/- has been agreed to be paid by the defendant No.2 to the
plaintiffs. In addition, a sum of Rs 16 lacs is also agreed to be paid by
the defendant No.2 to the plaintiff No.1 by way of damages and legal
costs. Consequently, a total sum of Rs 1,13,72,700/- has been agreed to
be paid by the defendant No.2 to the plaintiff No.1. The said amount
stands paid as indicated in the application itself.

3.

The learned counsel for the parties state that although prayer

clause of the application seeks that the plaintiffs be permitted to

CS(OS) 2403/2007

Page No.2 of 4

withdraw the suit against the defendants, that is a typographical error and
since the application has been moved under Order 23 Rule 3, the actual
prayer is that the suit be decreed in terms of the settlement and the
compromise arrived at between the parties.

4.

The application is signed by Mr Gautam Dassharma as

authorized signatory of the defendant No.2 and the defendant No.5. It is
also signed by Mr Vishal Ahuja, who is the constituted attorney of the
plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2. Affidavits of the said Mr Gautam Dassharma and
Mr Vishal Ahuja have also been filed in support of the application. It
has also been signed by the respective counsel for the parties. The
application be marked as Ext. C-1.

5.

I have considered the terms of settlement arrived at between

the parties and I find the same to be lawful. The compromise/ settlement
is taken on record. The suit is decreed in terms of the settlement Ext. C-1
which shall form part of the decree.

6.

A small issue has been raised with regard to the court fees

payable in view of the fact that the defendant No. 2 is to pay a sum of

CS(OS) 2403/2007

Page No.3 of 4

Rs 97,72,700/- by way of the price of the licences which it has obtained
from the plaintiffs. Insofar as the price of the licence for software is
concerned, that would not fall within the category of the damages and,
therefore, in my view no court fees would be payable on this amount.
As regards the damages component, the same has been computed at
Rs 16 lacs.

In the plaint the relief of damages has been valued at

Rs 20,00,200/- and court fees amounting to Rs 21,900/- has already been
paid thereon. That covers the amount of Rs 16 lacs awarded by way of
damages. No other court fees would be payable. The formal decree be
prepared.
This application, the suit and all other pending applications
stand disposed of.

The next date fixed in the matter stands cancelled.
