1.
This is an application for interim injunction under
Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

The

notices issued to the respondents by virtue of an order dated
1.5.2007 have been served on the respondents. Nobody appears on
behalf of the respondents.

2.

As per the application the respondents had approached

the petitioner for grant of a loan. An agreement had been entered

into between the petitioner and the respondents on 30.5.2005. The
amount of the loan was to the extent of Rs 37,00,000/-. The said
amount was advanced and disbursed on 30.5.2005 and was to be
repaid by the respondents in 164 equated monthly instalments of Rs
43,568/-. As security for the loan, the respondents mortgaged the
property No. B-111, Saraswati Marg, Bajaj Nagar, Jaipur, by
creating an equitable mortgage in favour of the petitioner. The
original Title Deed was handed over to the petitioner. Disputes
have arisen between the parties and the said agreement contains an
arbitration clause. The venue of the arbitration is Delhi and the
arbitration is to be conducted by a sole arbitrator to be appointed by
the petitioner. By a notice dated 17.10.2006 the petitioner informed
the respondents of its intention to refer the matter to Mr S.K. Jain,
Advocate for arbitration.

3.

As stated in the petition, the petitioner has a strong

apprehension that the mortgaged property, which is the only
security with the petitioner, is likely to be disposed of by the
respondents. Since the statements made in the petition have been

uncontroverted due to the absence of the respondents despite the
service of notice on them, the said statements have to be taken as
correct.

4.

Accordingly, this petition is disposed of with the

direction that the respondents, their agents, assigns are restrained
from selling, disposing off, transferring, alienating or creating any
third party interest in property No. B-111, Saraswati Marg, Bajaj
Nagar, Jaipur in any manner whatsoever till the disposal of the
arbitration proceedings.
