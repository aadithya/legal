Examination-2005.

The

petitioner

qualified

the

written

examination, Physical Endurance Test and interview. He was,
however, disqualified in medical examination due to ‘SEVERE
HYPERTENSION’ vide order dated 17.5.2006. The petitioner was
also informed that in case he desired to challenge the findings of
the medical examination in an appeal, he could apply for review
medical examination.
2.

Thereafter, the petitioner filed an appeal for review medical

examination as the petitioner was declared medically fit for the
post of Sub-Inspector by the Medical Officer, General Hospital,
Rohtak vide their medical fitness certificate dated 8.6.2006. On
31.8.2006

the

petitioner

appeared

for

review

medical

examination wherein medical officer directed the petitioner to
consume the medicines namely ‘Inderal’-40 mg 1 tab. and
‘Alprex’-025 mg 1 tab. and thereafter the petitioner was
medically examined. He was again declared unfit due to severe
hypertension. The petitioner was orally informed about the same
at about 5.30 pm.
3.

Thereafter, the petitioner got himself regularly medically

checked up in 'PGI, Medical Sciences, Rohtak and Safdarjung
Hospital, New Delhi on 17.5.2006 and 31.8.2006 respectively. He

was declared fit by the above said both the hospitals. Under
these circumstances, the present writ petition was filed with the
prayer to quash the verbal order dated 31.8.2006 and in case the
petitioner is not found fit in medical examination the respondents
be directed to appoint the petitioner on alternative post for which
the petitioner is medically fit in accordance with relevant rules
and instructions on the subject with all consequential benefits.
4.

The respondents have contested the instant writ petition. It

is explained that the review medical examination of the
petitioner was held at Base Hospital, ITBP, New Delhi. The
petitioner had applied for recruitment of Sub-Inspector in Central
Police Organisation, 2005. The ultimate authority to adjudicate
upon the medical fitness or otherwise of a candidate is the
Medical Board attached to Central Police Organisation.
5.

We have heard the counsel for the parties. The main

argument urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner was
that the reports from PGI

Medical Sciences, Rohtak and

Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi clearly go to reveal that the
petitioner is not suffering from any ailment. He stressed that the
order passed by the respondents in this context is illegal, unjust,
arbitrary and is violative of Articles 14, 16 and 21 of the

WP(C) No.14995/2006

Page 3 of 5

Constitution of India. He further argued that if the petitioner is
not found

fit,

he be ordered

to be posted

for another

clerical/official job.
6.

The learned counsel for the petitioner, however, failed to

draw our attention towards any rule or regulation which may go
to show that he is entitled to some alternative job under the
circumstances explained above. What one garners from the
above said facts is that the doctors who conducted the review
medical examination were sympathetic towards the petitioner
and administered those medicines which clearly go a long way to
help such like patient. It is surprising to note that even with those
medicines the petitioner could not get over the above said
ailment. It is now well settled that the evidence of concerned
medical Board will always get preponderance over the evidence
of all the other government or private hospitals unless the
malafides are alleged and proved on the record. The following
authorities go to fortify the above said view, Union of India and
another Vs. Baljit Singh, (1996) 11 SCC 315, Union of India
and others Vs. Dhir Singh China, AIR 2003 SC 1197,
Controller of Defence Accounts (Pension) and others Vs.
S. Balachandran Nair, AIR 2005 SC 4391 and Union of India

WP(C) No.14995/2006

Page 4 of 5

and others Vs. Keshar Singh, 2007 (6) SCALE 17. In all these
cases the opinions of the Medical Boards were given infinite
importance.
7.

The writ petition filed by the petitioner is devoid of force

and the same is therefore dismissed. However, there shall be no
order as to costs.
