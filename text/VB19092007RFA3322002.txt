Mr.Sanjay Poddar

accepts

notice

for

the

respondent. The appeal has been heard for final disposal.
2.

Land measuring 43 bighas and 11 biswas situated in

village Zindpur was acquired for widening of G.T. Karnal
Road from Auchandi Border Marg to Haryana Border in
terms of a notification under Section 4 issued on 9.1.1980

followed by a declaration under Section 6 of the Act. An
award made by the Land Acquisition Collector on 15.7.80
determined the compensation payable to the expropriated
land owners at the rate of Rs.1600/- per bigha. Dissatisfied
with the said amount, the appellants/land owners sought a
reference to the civil court who by the order under
challenge in this appeal has enhanced the amount of
compensation to Rs.11,384 per bigha with proportionate
statutory benefits.

A reading of the order passed by the

reference court shows that the enhancement in question
has been granted on the basis of an earlier order passed by
the said court in LAC No.245/1981 relating to a certain
parcel of land acquired in the adjoining village of Alipur.
RFA No.604/1987 filed against the order passed in the said
case succeeded in part resulting in the enhancement of the
compensation payable to the owners to
bigha.

Rs.15,380/- per

Learned counsel for the appellants, therefore,

argued and, in our opinion, rightly so that the amount of
compensation

determined

by

this

Court

in

RFA

No.604/1987 arising out of the case relied upon by the
reference court shall have to be awarded to the appellants

also.
3.

Mr.Poddar, counsel appearing for the respondent,

however, submitted that while the amount determined by
this court in RFA No.604/1987 could on a parity of
reasoning be awarded to the appellants and the order
passed by the reference court modified to that extent, yet
the appellants would not be entitled to the benefit of the
additional compensation in terms of Section 23(1A) of the
Act.

Relying upon the decision of the Supreme Court in

K.S. Paripoornan vs. State of Kerala & Ors. AIR 1995 SC
1012, Mr.Poddar

submitted that since the award in the

present case was made much before 30.4.1982, the date
relevant for purposes of grant of benefit of additional
amount under Section 23(1A), the said benefit is not
admissible to the appellants.

This position was not

disputed by counsel for the appellants who submitted that
the law regarding the admissibility of the additional
amount on compensation under Section 23(1A) of the Act
having been authoritatively settled by the Supreme court in
Paripoornan's case, the additional amount under the said
provision would not be admissible to the appellants in the

instant case.
4.

In the circumstances, therefore, and keeping in view

the submissions made at the Bar, we allow this appeal and
modify the order passed by the reference court and hold
the appellants entitled to the compensation @ Rs.15,380/per bigha with proportionate statutory benefits including
solatium

and

interest

but

excluding

additional

compensation admissible under Section 23(1A) of the Act.
The appellant shall also be entitled to proportionate costs
in this appeal.
