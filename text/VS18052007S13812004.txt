The plaintiff earlier filed OS No. 8952/2001 in the Court of

City Civil Judge, Bangalore against the defendants on the foundation
that the defendant No.1 was its appointed del-credere agent, and
therefore could not act as the del credere agent of any competitor by
custom and usage in the trade. It was claimed that the defendants had
violated the implied term of that agreement by acting as the del
credere agent of a competitor viz. South African Breweries.
4.

Consequently, the plaintiff filed the said suit, claiming

damages of Rs.7.5 lacs, rendition of accounts in respect of all
contracts entered into by the defendants to sell products which are
similar to ones being manufactured and sold by plaintiff; declaring that
the defendants are not entitled to take up any temporary or
permanent assignment/ arrangement in the nature of del credere
agency with any company, firm or concern, in competition with the
plaintiff herein, including the South African Breweries India Ltd.;
permanently restraining the defendants from accepting or taking up or
continuing any temporary or permanent assignment/arrangement in
the nature of del credere agency till the arrangement of del credere is
subsisting between the plaintiffs and the defendants; permanently
restraining

the

defendants

from

committing

breach

of

the

arrangement with the plaintiff and from divulging or disclosing in any
manner to any person, firm or body corporate including to

South

African Breweries India Ltd. any of the secrets concerning the affairs

CS(OS)1381-04

Page 2 of 10

or information of the plaintiff company acquired by them during the
course of their association with the plaintiff or in any manner involving
themselves directly or indirectly in promoting of any business similar
to or in competition with the

business of the plaintiff till the

arrangement of del credere is subsisting between the plaintiff and
defendants.
5.

The cause of action pleaded in the said suit is contained in

para 17 reads as follows:
“The causes of action for the above suit has
arisen on various dates when the first defendant was
appointed as a del credere agent and on subsequent
dates when the said del credere arrangement were
renewed from time to time by the plaintiff company,
on 22-09-2001 when the said Company by name
South African Breweries India Ltd. intimated some of
the wholesalers and traders in Uttar Pradesh that
they have appointed the first defendant as their del
credere agent, and on 18-09-2001 when the plaintiff
sent a fax message to the second defendant and on
various other dates in the months of September,
October, November, when the plaintiff has
repeatedly
been
making
all
attempts
to
telephonically or personally meet the defendants
and sort out all issues concerned. The causes of
action have arisen within the jurisdiction of this
Hon'ble Court as the defendants have approached
the plaintiff at its Bangalore office on several
occasions to discuss the terms of the del credere
arrangement and also for the purposes of renewing
the said terms from time to time.”
6.

It appears that the City Civil Court, Bangalore passed an

order in IA No. I and III taking a prima facie view that by a letter dated
30.9.2001 written by defendant No.1, the contract between the parties
is deemed to be terminated.
CS(OS)1381-04

7.

Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an application under Order 23

R. 1 (3) CPC praying for grant of permission to the plaintiff to withdraw
to the said suit and to institute a fresh suit. This application was
disposed of on 15.7.2003 by the Court of the VIII Additional City Civil
Judge, Bangalore. The Court took the view that no leave could be
granted to the plaintiff to file a suit for recovery of the amount “on the
petitioner's present cause of action” and further observed “when the
suit to be filed against the defendants by the plaintiff is for recovery of
the amount, due to him and this Court has already come to the
conclusion while passing order in IA No. I, II & III that the contract
between the parties is terminated and it is not proper to grant liberty
to file a fresh suit on the same cause of action”. The operative part of
the order reads as follows:
“I. A.No. VII filed by the plaintiff under Order XXIII
Rule 1(3) read with Section 151 CPC is partly
allowed.
It is ordered that the plaintiff shall be permitted
to withdraw the present suit but no liberty to
institute a fresh suit is granted to the plaintiff as
prayed for.”
8.

The plaintiff thereafter filed the present suit. The plaintiff

has claimed an amount of Rs.1,80,83,698/-. The computation thereof
is contained in para 13 and the same reads as follows:

amount (Rs.85,99,229/-)

Rs.75,37,598/-

Rs.1,80,83,698/-

9.

Para 15 contains the averment with regard to the cause of

action for filing the present suit reads as follows:
“The cause of action for the present suit first
arose on 30.9.2001 when the defendant No.1
raised the illegal debit/claim bill nos.6, 7, 10
and 11 all dated 30.9.2001. The cause of
action for the present suit again arose on the
date when the defendant No. 1 adjusted the
amounts of the said Debit/Claim Bills from the
dues of the plaintiff. The cause of action for
the present suit again arose on or about
15.10.2001, when the defendant No. 1
informed the plaintiff company that it had
transferred the outstandings of the UP and
Uttranchal
customers
amounting
to
Rs.1,61,36,826.82 to the plaintiff. The cause
of action again arose in August 2002 when
part payment was received towards the
account of the defendants. The cause of action
is a continuing one and continues to arise on
every date that the defendants do not pay the
outstanding amount to the plaintiff company.
The present suit is being filed within the
period of limitation.”
CS(OS)1381-04

10.

From the aforesaid, it is seen that the cause of action

pleaded by the plaintiff in the present suit arose on 13.9.2001 when, it
is claimed, that illegal debit/claim bill No. 6,7,10 & 11 all dated
30.9.2001 were raised by defendant No.1. It is further stated that the
cause of action arose on that date when defendant No.1 adjusted the
amount of the said debit/claim bills from the dues of the plaintiff.
11.

Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the bar under Order 2

R. 2 CPC is only in respect of the filing of a fresh suit founded upon the
same cause of action. The cause of action on the basis of which the
earlier suit was filed in Bangalore, was the conduct of the defendant in
entering into an arrangement with South African Breweries, which was
contrary to custom and usage in the trade, whereas the cause of
action for filing the present suit, as aforesaid, is the issuance of
debit/claim bill no. 6,7,10 & 11 all dated 30.9.2001 and the adjustment
of these debit/claim bills from the dues of the plaintiff on the same
date by the defendant. Since cause of action in two suits is distinct,
the suit is not hit by Order 2 Rule 2.
12.

On the other hand, the submission of the defendant is that

the cause of action as pleaded in the present suit was available to the
plaintiff when it filed the earlier suit and the plaintiff ought to have
made its entire claim while filing the first suit, since it was possible for
the plaintiff to have made the said claim in the first suit itself.
13.

In AIR (36) 1949 Privy Council 1978 Mohmmad Khalil

CS(OS)1381-04

Page 6 of 10

Khan & Ors. Vs. Mahbub Ali Mian & Ors., the Privy Council
observes that under Order 2 Rule 2 CPC, if the plaintiff fails to sue for
whole of the claim which he entitled to make in the first suit, then he
is precluded from suing in a second suit in respect of the portion so
omitted. The issue to be considered is, what was the cause of action
in the earlier suit and whether the plaintiff in the earlier suit included
all its claims that it was entitled to make in respect of that cause of
action. If the plaintiff failed to include to all its claims, then by force of
Order 2 Rule 2 CPC he is precluded from including the claims omitted
based on the same cause of action in the subsequent suit.
14.

From a plain reading of the provision it appears that the

rule prohibits spliting up of claims in respect of “a cause of action”. It
does not appear to be referring to all causes of action or more than
one cause of action. The Privy Council refers to its own earlier decision
in

Moonshee

Buzloor

Ruheem

vs.

Shumsunnissa

Begum,

wherein it was observed, “the correct test in all cases of this kind is,
whether the claim in the new suit is, in fact, founded on a cause of
action distinct from that which was the foundation of the former
suit....”.
15.

The Privy Council then proceeded to deal with the phrase

“cause of action” and cited Read vs. Brown (1889) 22 Q.B.D. 128 :
(58 L.J. Q.B. 120) wherein Lord Esher, M.R. accepted an earlier
definition given in Cook vs. Gill (1873) L.R. SC.P.107 : (42 L.J. C.P. 98)

CS(OS)1381-04

Page 7 of 10

as “every fact which it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if
traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of the Court. It
does not comprise every piece of evidence which is necessary to
prove each fact, but every fact which is necessary to be proved.”
16.

Fry L.J. agreed and said, “Everything which, if not proved,

gives the defendant an immediate right to judgment, must be part of
the cause of action.”
17.

The Privy Council also notices its earlier judgment in Mt.

Chand Kour vs. Partab Singh (1887-1888) 15 I.A. P.156 : (16 Cal.98
P.C.) wherein Lord Watson who delivered the judgment of the Board
observed as follows:
“Now the cause of action has no relation
whatever to the defence which may be set up by
the defendant, nor does it depend upon the
character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff.
It refers entirely to the grounds set out in the
plaint as the cause of action, or, in other words,
to the media upon which the plaintiff, asks the
Court to arrive at a conclusion in his favour.”
18.

The Privy Council also notices the decision in Brunsden

vs. Humphrey (1884-14 Q.B. D.141 : 53 L.J. A.B. 476) wherein it was
held that where the question is whether the cause of action in two
suits is the same or not, one of the tests that is applied is whether the
same evidence would support the claims in both suits; if the evidence
required to support the claims is different, then the causes of action
are also different.
19.

Coming back to the case in hand, there can be no doubt

CS(OS)1381-04

Page 8 of 10

that the cause of action on which the earlier suit of the plaintiff was
based is distinct from the cause of action on which the present suit is
based. The cause of action pleaded in the suit filed in the Bangalore
City Civil Court is the alleged collusion between the defendants with
the competitor of the plaintiff to promote the main brand of the
competitor in order to bring down the marketing and sale of products
manufactured by the plaintiff company in the State of Uttar Pradesh
and Uttranchal. It is the alleged breach by the defendant of the custom
and usage in trade concerning the subsisting del credere agreement
that it had with the plaintiff, which is pleaded as the fact giving a
cause of action to the plaintiff.
20.

In the present case, however, the cause of action

as

pleaded is the raising of the alleged illegal debit/claimed Bill No.6, 7,
8, 10 and 11 of dated 30th September 2001 and the adjustments of
the amounts of the said debit/claim bills by the defendant from the
dues of the plaintiff. It is also claimed to have arisen on 15.2.2001
when defendant No. 1, is claimed to have informed the plaintiff
company that it had transferred the outstanding of the Uttar Pradesh
and Uttranchal customers of the plaintiff. The cause of action is also
claimed to have arisen in August 2002 when part payment are claimed
to have been received towards the accounts of the defendants.
Clearly, the bundle of facts that would entitle the plaintiff to a decree
in these two suits is separate and the evidence that needs to be led in
CS(OS)1381-04

Page 9 of 10

support of the respective claims is different.
21.

In this view of the matter, the cause of action in both the

suits is distinct and separate. Since the earlier suit was not based on
the same cause of action, the bar under Order 2 R. 2 CPC would not
apply in the present case.
22.

Consequently, in my view, the present suit is not barred

under Order 2 Rule 2 CPC.

This issue is answered in favour of the

plaintiff.
