S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.

(OPEN COURT)

IA Nos. 7650/04, 7651/04, 7652/04 and 12600/2006
1.

One Kartar Singh is alleged to have executed a Will dated 16th

November, 1980 and subsequently died. In its terms he had nominated/bequeathed
his estate to Smt. Sohan Devi, his wife. She filed the present probate petition under

Test Case No. 3/1989

page No.1 of 6

Section 276 of the Indian Succession Act. In the meanwhile a partition suit had been
filed by her sons in respect of the estate of Late Kartar Singh.
2.

At some stage during the proceedings, this court had directed that

suit No. 868/1985 as well as the probate proceedings No. 3.1989 should be listed and
considered together. Consequently, both the proceedings were treated as companion
matters and were being listed together.
3.

Smt. Sohan Devi died on 7.5.2003. However, the order sheets in this

case reveal that the death of the petitioner Sohan Devi was not recorded or made
known to the Court.

This is evident from the orders dated 22.5.2003, 29.5.2003,

6.1.2004 and 25.3.2004. Since on 13.7.2004 there was no appearance on behalf of
the petitioner, Probate case No. 3/1989 was dismissed.
4.

IA No. 7250/2004 was, therefore, filed by one of the LRs of Sohan

Devi, her daughter under Order IX Rule 4

r/w Section 151 CPC. The other

applications i.e. IA No. 7650/04 (under O. VII R.17 CPC) & IA No. 7651/04 (under
O. IX R.4 CPC seeking amendment) are consequential as they seek amendment of IA
No. 7650/04.

Another application IA No. 7652/04 under O. I Rule 10 CPC is for

transposition of Usha Choudhary, respondent NO.4

as petitioner in these

proceedings.
5.

Counsel for the petitioner has referred to the order sheets dated

11.12.1995, 21.3.1997 and 29.9.2003 and other orders to say that
were being heard together.

both the cases

It is averred and contended on behalf of the applicant

that she contacted her counsel on 22.10.2004 upon becoming aware of that fact that
probate No. 3.1989 has been dismissed. It is averred that the applicant had become
Test Case No. 3/1989

page No.2 of 6

the sole representative of the deceased Sohan Devi by virtue of another Will dated
15.10.1986 executed by her (i.e. the said Sohan Devi). In addition, pursuant to
directions of the Court, the petitioner filed an affidavit on 25.9.2007 explaining the
circumstances which resulted in delay in approaching the court, as the petitioner had
died in May, 2003, whereas the application was filed in October, 2004. In this
affidavit the applicant states that she was not advised to move for her impleadment as
LR and that after being informed on 22.10.2004 about dismissal of the probate
petition she moved for inspection and thereafter

engaged another counsel who

presented the applications.
6.

Learned counsel for the

petitioner

besides relying upon the

averments submitted that the applicant has interest to pursue the proceedings as the
sole heir of late Smt. Sohan Devi by virtue of Will also submitted that interest of
justice would be served if the abatement is set aside and the applicant is impleaded in
the present proceedings.

He has relied upon a judgment reported as

Suresh

Chander & ors Vs. Mahesh Chand & ors. 143 (2007) DLT 456.
7.

Learned counsel for the respondent has disputed the

petitioner's

interest in moving the court. Reliance was placed upon order IX Rule 4 CPC to say
that it is only the party in domain of the proceedings, the late petitioner who could
have moved under the said provision.

Since late Sohan Devi was the petitioner,

upon her death, the proceedings abated. It was submitted that in any event the very
same parties, the present applicant, and the other parties to the probate petition, are
also parties in the pending suit which was subsequently transferred to the Court of
the District Judge.

8.

Learned counsel for respondent No. 6 submitted that the applications

do not deserve to be allowed since the petitioner has been less than forthcoming.
According to her, the applicant has resorted to falsehood and taken differing stands
none neither of which are true. It was also contended that the decision in Suresh
Chander's case is inopposite

since

the respondent/objector in the probate

proceedings had died and therefore the court acted within its jurisdiction by relying
on Order XXII Rule 9 and Order 1 Rule 10 CPC.
9.

It

was lastly contended that the late petitioner Smt. Sohan Kaur

having approached the Court as an executor, upon her death there was no surviving
lis which could have been pursued by any one. In the circumstances, the applicant
cannot maintain these proceedings.
10 .

A consideration of the order sheet and the materials on record would

show that a Probate case No. 3/1989 was directed to be taken up after decision in suit
No.868/1985.

Undeniably in suit no. 868/1985 Sohan Devi had been impleaded as

a defendant; the heirs of late Kartar Singh were parties to Probate No. 3/1989. The
petitioner Sohan Devi and her all children are also parties to the suit; some of them
are plaintiffs.

When the pecuniary jurisdiction of this court was raised to

Rs.20,00,000/- the suit was transferred, sometime in 2004 to the District Court.
However, the present proceedings continued.
11 .

Smt. Sohan Devi died on 7.5.2003. This was even not known to her

the counsel. This is apparent from the subsequent order sheets right up to 13.7.2004
when the petition was ultimately dismissed.

This is a matter of record. As to what

advice was given to the applicant by her counsel is not something which the court
Test Case No. 3/1989

page No.4 of 6

can infer but what can be visualised from the material facts available on record are
that the applicant did not move the court; in any event her counsel was unaware of
her death.
12 .

The counsel for the respondent had pointed to para 9 of the affidavit

filed by the applicant to say that she was aware
impleaded as LR in the suit.

as to the necessity of being

In the opinion of the court this does not in any way

mean the awareness of the applicant that she could have been impleaded as a party in
the present proceeding.

It is not the respondent's case that the petitioner or the

applicant are expertis in law or are aware of the consequences of the death of an
executor, upon the proceedings.
12.

As far as the question as regards the contention that the court should

not permit the application to be impleaded since the only party who had sought for
probate being Sohan Devi is concerned, it has to be held that there is a radical
difference between normal civil proceeding and a testamentary

proceeding.

Proceedings under the Succession Act are in rem, where the status of the parties
and legatees under the Will is in question.

Even if for some reason the original

executor dies the court would not be rendered powerless. There are provision in the
Indian Succession Act enable it to grant administration of the estate to effectuate
the Will.

Further the proceedings also show that the applicant was party in the

probate case.
13.

On an over all conspectus of the circumstances, this court is satisfied

that the application setting aside the abatement deserves to be allowed.
IA Nos. 7650/04, 7651/04, 7652/04 and 12600/2006 are accordingly
Test Case No. 3/1989

page No.5 of 6

allowed.
TEST.CAS. 3/1989
This court had by its previous order required that the decision in the
probate case should be decided after the judgment in CS (OS) 868/1985; that suit has
been transferred to the court of Additional District & Sessions Judge, Sh. P.K. Jain
and is renumbered. It is submitted that the said proceeding is fixed on 1.5.2008.
In the peculiar circumstances of this case, the court is of the opinion
that the same direction should be maintained having regard to the fact that both these
proceedings were being taken up together, simultaneously. the present proceeding
too should be transferred to the same court for a decision on the merits.
It is accordingly directed that probate case No. 3/1989 should stand
transferred to be decided by the court of Sh. P.K. Jain , Additional District Judge.
The court shall endeavour to complete the proceeding and render final judgment as
early as possible in any case within nine months from today.
The registry is directed to transmit the records of this case to the court
of Sh. P.K. Jain, ADJ, Delhi or to its successor court, for further proceedings. The
parties shall be present before Court on 1.5.2008.
The Petition, Probate case No. 3/1989 is disposed of in the above
terms.
