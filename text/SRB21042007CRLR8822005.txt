Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat (Open Court)
FIR No. 225/04
U/S: 341/323/34 IPC
P.S: Prasad Nagar
1.
The petitioners challenge an order on charge framed by the Additional
Sessions Judge whereby they were charged of having committed offences under
Sections 308/34 IPC.
2.

The incident by which the complainant/ informant sustained injuries took

place on 6th September, 2004. The informant, Dilip alleged that on 31.08.04,
CRL.REV.P. 882-886/2005

1 of 4

one Kamal Kishore who was riding a motor cycle, had some altercation with him
on account of over-speeding. Again on 06.09.04, in the evening apparently there
was again some altercation between the two.

It was alleged that subsequently

the informant was attacked by Rahul with an iron rod and other accused, with
knife, long sticks (danda) etc. It was alleged that he fell down unconscious.
During the course of investigation, an MLC was made by the Ram Manohar Lohia
Hospital. It recorded a simple injury on the forehead of the petitioner. He was
also subjected to an X-ray of the skull. The reports were negative; no fracture was
found. The MLC also did not record any other injury on the person of the said
Dilip, the informant.
3.

Counsel for the petitioner urged that the trial Court fell into error in

framing charge at all because even if the totality of the allegations were to be
taken into account, the material contradictions in the evidence and statements of
the witnesses about the incident as well as the nature of injuries, would prove
fatal to the prosecution story and as a result the petitioners are entitled to be
discharged. Counsel contended that in truth the complainant/informant had
fallen down and there was no question of his having beaten up as alleged.
4.

The petition was opposed by learned counsel for the State, who submitted

that the circumstances point out to grave suspicion about the petitioner's
intention to attempt in committing an acts which were likely to result in death of
the injured. At the stage of framing of charge, it was contended, that the Court
has to satisfy itself as to the broad existence of ingredients and necessary factual
elements. There were several facts in the case and the mere existence of a simple
CRL.REV.P. 882-886/2005

injury would not detract from the petitioner's intention to inflict an injury of
graver nature; as a consequence, the offence under Section 308 IPC was rightly
attracted.
5.

The trial Court, after considering the arguments, apparently went by the

version of the eye witnesses who all deposed that the accused had reached the
place armed with deadly weapons.

However, it was also recorded that one

witness Naveen stated that he had seen an assault “marpit” between the accused
Rahul and Dilip.
6.

The trial Court proceeded to charge the petitioners under Section 308, and

it was of the view that weight to be attached to the medical evidence has to be
considered after trial and not at the stage of charges. Although as a general
proposition the statement is un-exceptionable, in this case it is not merely the
medical evidence (MLC), but also the statement of the other witnesses and the
injured who alleged that each petitioner had attacked him with the aid of one or
the other weapon, which is significant. The injured and some witnesses in their
statements had stated that each of the accused had weilded his weapon. The
medical evidence, however, does not support this version, as there was only one
simple injury. In view of these features, I am of the opinion that the framing of a
charge under Section 308 was not appropriate. The evidence, as existing on the
record, point to intention to cause some injury of a grievous nature as is evident
from the nature of the weapons and the attack. But there is nothing indicative of
attack of such severity warranting the charge under Section 308. This is a case
where the charge would have to be appropriately modified to one under Section
CRL.REV.P. 882-886/2005

3 of 4

326 IPC read with Section 511 IPC.
7.

In view of the above discussion , the impugned order is hereby set aside.

The matter is remitted to the trial Court for framing of charge in terms of the
above findings, by altering the charge into ones under Sections 326 read with
Section 511 IPC.
8.

The petition is disposed off in the above terms.
