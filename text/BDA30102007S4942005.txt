This is a joint application filed on behalf of the plaintiff and

the defendants under Order 23 Rule 3 read with Section 151 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, 1908 for recording the compromise arrived at
between the parties and for decreeing the suit in terms thereof. The
plaintiff had instituted the suit seeking injunction against the defendant
from infringing and misusing its registered trademarks “HUGO”,
“HUGO BOSS”, “BOSS” and “THE BOSS” and from passing off their

During the pendency of the suit, the parties have arrived at a

settlement / compromise. The defendants have acknowledged the
proprietorship of the plaintiff over the aforesaid trademarks. They have
also agreed not to use the same or to pass off any of their goods as that of
the plaintiff's. They have also agreed not to make any application before
the Trademark Registry in respect of the said trademarks. Other terms
and conditions have been set out in paragraph 5 of the application. The
defendants have also agreed to pay a sum of Rs 25,000/- to the plaintiff
as costs of the present suit. The plaintiff has agreed not to press for
rendition of accounts and / or other reliefs prayed in the plaint.

proprietor of K. V. International on behalf of the defendant No.1 and by
Mrs Kavita Arora, who is the proprietor of defendant No.2, on behalf of

company. The same is also supported by their affidavits as well as the
affidavits of Mrs Kavita Arora and Mrs Rachna Virmani.

4.

I have examined the terms of the compromise arrived at

between the parties and I am satisfied that the same is lawful.
Accordingly, the compromise is taken on record. The application is
marked as Ext. C-1. The suit is decreed in terms of prayer A of the
plaint. The rest of the prayers, apart from prayer D, are given up by the
plaintiff.

Insofar as the prayer D is concerned, it has been agreed that

the defendant shall pay costs of Rs 25,000/- to the plaintiff. The suit
stands decreed accordingly.

This application (Ext. C-1) shall form part

of the decree. The formal decree be drawn up.

This application, the suit and other pending applications stand
disposed of.
