1.
The whole controversy in this Letter Patent Appeal (LPA)
centres around the question whether Dhir Singh, since deceased,
husband of Khazani Devi, the appellant is entitled to the grant of
pension under the Freedom Fighter Pension Scheme, 1972. The
appellant filed a writ petition claiming Freedom Fighters Pension.
That writ petition was dismissed by the learned Single Judge vide
order dated 31st August, 2000, on the ground that the husband of
the appellant was not a freedom fighter. Thereafter, the review
petition was also dismissed vide order dated 17th July, 2001.
Aggrieved

by

the

above-said

orders,

the

appellant

has

approached this Court.
2.

Adumbrated in brief, the facts of this case are as follows.

LPA No.575/2001

Page 2 of 11

The husband of the appellant, Sepoy Dhir Singh, expired on 14th
July, 1992.

He joined as a soldier in the Indian Army on 5th

January, 1930 in Jat Regiment.

The Jat Regiment surrendered

before the Japan Imperial Forces on 15th February, 1942.
Thereafter, the Jat Regiment as a whole joined the Indian National
Army (in short “INA”) and was renamed as 3 Guerrilla Regiment.
The appellant's husband died in action and it was reported in
'who's who of Indian Martyrs'.

Two comrade soldiers of Jat

Regiment cremated the body of Dhir Singh alias Dhiru Ram on
15th July, 1942 at Singapore. After the death of Dhir Singh, his
widow (the appellant herein) applied for grant of Freedom
Fighters Pension. She was granted Freedom Fighter Pension with
effect from 15th August, 1972 vide letter dated 7th June, 1974.

A

few villagers, who were having inimical relations with the
appellant, drew the attention of the Ministry of Home Affairs that
Dhir Singh had never joined the INA.

The appellant was called

upon to produce the documents in support of her claim. Her
Freedom Fighters Pension was suspended vide letter dated 3rd
September,

1991.

Thereafter,

the

appellant

made

a

representation before the respondents but it did not ring the bell.
Consequently, the above-said writ petition was filed under Article
LPA No.575/2001

Page 3 of 11

226 of the Constitution of India, wherein it was prayed that the
impugned letters dated 3rd September, 1991 and 8th May, 1996 be
quashed and a writ of mandamus be issued directing the
respondents to restore the Freedom Fighters Pension with effect
from December, 1992 and to pay the arrears along with interest
thereon.
3.

The respondents listed the following defences in their

counter affidavit. The real name of the petitioner is Dhir Singh
and not Dhiru Ram as is evident from the voter list and election
commissioner card.

In her representation dated 31st October,

1973 the appellant submitted that her husband died during July
1942 in Singapore.

Subsequently, it transpired from the Army

records office letter dated 27th June, 1991 that late Sepoy Dhir
Singh had never joined the INA and that he was reported dead on
14th July, 1942. The appellant was granted family pension at the
rate of Rs.8/- per month with effect form 15th July, 1942.

The

Army record also reveals that Dhir Singh died in Malaya on 14th
July, 1942 and his name was found published at page No. 6 Serial
No.189 in a book “REGISTER OF CASUALTIES INDIAN ARMY
WORLD WAR II, VOLUME XIII, 9TH JAT REGIMENT, 1956” which
was published by the Government of India. The Indian troops of
LPA No.575/2001

Page 4 of 11

British Army deployed in Malaya and Singapore surrendered
before the Japanese Army on 15th February, 1942 and were made
prisoners of war. In September, 1942, the first INA, comprising of
British Army soldiers was raised by General Mohan Singh.
However, the said INA was disbanded in May, 1943. The second
INA headed by Netaji Subhash Chander Bose was raised only in
July, 1943.
4.

The question now to the fore is whether Dhir Singh was a

member of the INA?

The learned counsel for the appellant

vehemently argued that as a matter of fact, General Mohan Singh
had started the INA in the year 1940 and not in the year 1942.
He pointed out that once the appellant was getting Freedom
Fighters Pension, there was no cause for cancelling it. Now the
documents produced by the appellant deserve a look. Annexure
PI is the copy of a extract of book known as “The roll of honour –
Anecdotes of Indian Martyrs” written by Kali Charan Ghose. Entry

written by DHEHRA DHOGE page 94 entry about one Dhiru Ram
reads:-

5.

Dhiru Ram : b. at v. Dubaldhan,
Distt. Rohtak, Haryana; Soldier in the Jat
Regiment, Indian Army; Joined the
Indian National Army as a Havildar in
the 3rd Guerrilla Regiment.
Died in
action.

No value can be pinned with these two documents for a

variety of reasons. Firstly, there is no evidence on the record to
show that these are authentic documents or approved by a
recognized agency or Government of India.

Secondly, these

pertain to one Dhiru Ram and not Dhiru Singh. Lastly, there is no
evidence or document, worth the name, to show that Dhiru Singh
had left the British Army and joined the Indian National Army.
The value of these documents is too exiguous to warrant
intervention in this LPA.
6.

Annexures P3 and 4 are the letters sent by Deputy

Secretary, Government of India, to the appellant wherein she was
called upon to adduce evidence. Letter P3(a) dated 18/6/74 is a
very

crucial

letter

sent

by

Freedom

Fighter

Association,

Government of Haryana, wherein appellant was unambiguously
informed that her husband was not a freedom fighter.

This is

most valuable evidence for the purpose of present controversy.
LPA No.575/2001

Page 6 of 11

Annexure P5 dated 3rd September, 1991 and Annexure P6 dated
31st December, 1991 are the letters sent by the Under Secretary
of Govt. of India, and one Shri Rup Chand, Secretary, the Jat
records,

Jat

Regiment,

Bareily,

respectively,

wherein

the

provisional pension granted in favour of the appellant was
suspended and he was informed that her husband was not a
freedom fighter.
7.

Letters, Annexures P7 dated 10th September, 1991, P8 dated

13th September, 1991, P9 dated 22nd February, 1993, P10 dated
3rd March, 1994, P11 dated 2nd June, 1994, P12 dated 20th April,
1995 and P13 dated 2nd May, 1995 are the letters written by
Captain S.S. Yadav, I.N.A., General Secretary, allegedly appointed
by AICC(All India I.N.A. Committee) in 1945 which have supported
the case of appellant on the basis of evidence already discussed
above but these have failed to cite any new evidence.

These

letters have no value in the eyes of law and have to be left out of
consideration.
8.

Annexures P14 and P15 are the affidavits of Pirthee Singh

and Partap Singh respectively, who along with Dhir Singh
surrendered before the Japanese Imperial Force and joined I.N.A.
along with Dhir Singh on 15th February, 1942.
LPA No.575/2001

However, they
Page 7 of 11

have not produced any record or made reference of the same.
Annexure P 16 dated 6th March, 1999 is the certificate of
Mr.Bhoopinder Singh Hooda, the then member of Parliament,
which is based on the above-said documents but nothing new
evidence was referred to.

Annexure P17 is the representation

made by the appellant. Annexure P18 dated 8.5.1996 is the order
whereby Smt. Khazani Devi was informed that the sanction of
family pension be treated as cancelled with effect from the date it
was

sanctioned

and

about

the

amount

in

the

sum

of

Rs.76,310.40, drawn by her from 15.8.1972 to 31.10.1992 was
ordered to be recovered.
9.

Annexure R-1 is the copy of the service documents in

respect of deceased husband of the petitioner.

Perusal of the

same suggests that Dhir Singh was the member of 2/9 Jat
Regiment and he was discharged on 14.7.1942 by reason of
death.

Annexure R-2 is the representation by the petitioner

wherein it is stated that the petitioner's husband died in July,
1942 at Singapore. Annexure R-4, R-5 & R-6 are the Army record
according to which No.10199 late Sepoy Dhir Singh had never
served I.N.A. and he died in Mallaya on 14.7.1942.
10.

The plea raised by the appellant is mere palliative and does

LPA No.575/2001

Page 8 of 11

not delve deep enough to the roots of malady. It must be borne in
mind that this is the appellant and nobody else who is to carry the
ball in proving her case. The arguments advanced on behalf of
the appellant are incongruous. On the one hand, it is stated that
Dhir Singh was a member of the British Army till the year 1942
and on the other hand, it is stated that the Jat Regiment as a
whole joined the INA and was renamed as 3 Guerrilla Regiment.
There is not even an iota of evidence which may go to show that
Dhir Singh had joined the new unit which was known as 3
Guerrilla Regiment or that late Dhir Singh was promoted to the
rank of Havaladar by the INA. It is difficult to fathom as to how
late Dhir Singh became a member of the INA while he was a
member of the British Forces.

The appellant was asked to

produce the proof in support of her case but the needful was not
done.

The appellant has failed to produce proof of dismissal or

discharge of Dhir Singh from the Army due to INA activity, OR,
number, rank and unit of Regiment/Battalion of Indian National
Army with which he lastly worked OR proof of any aid, allowance,
and 'Bhatta' on being Ex. INA personnel.

It is thus clear that

she did not bolster her case with evidence.

In absence of

verifiable evidence, her case does not stand proved.

In a recent authority reported in West Bengal Freedom

Fighters' Organization Vs. Union of India and Ors. [AIR 2004 SC
5143] many authorities were referred to and it was observed,
13. Reliance was placed upon the case of Mukund
Lal Bhandari v. Union of India reported in (1993)
Supp. (3) SCC 2, wherein it has been held that the
scheme mentions documents which are required to
be produced before the Government. It has been
held that it is not for Courts to scrutinize the
documents. It is held that it is for the Government to
scrutinize the documents and pronounce upon their
genuineness.
14. Reliance was also placed upon the case of Union
of India v. Mohan Singh, (1996) 10 SCC 351 In this
case also the applications had been made only
supported by a certificate from a MLA and a coprisoner. The Government found the certificate to be
insufficient to sustain the claim. The High Court,
however, held that the certificates were sufficient
and directed payment of pension. Setting aside the
Judgment of the High Court, this Court noted the
observations in Mukund Lal Bhandari's case
(supra) and held that it was not for the High Court to
embark upon the appreciation of the evidence. It was
held that once the Government concludes that the
documents are not sufficient the High Court cannot
interfere.
15. Our attention is also drawn to an unreported
Order of this Court dated 24thSeptember, 2003 in
Civil Appeal No. 1850 of 1999. In this case, an
application had been made under this very Scheme.
There was no jail record and only an affidavit of a
person who had visited him in jail and a certificate
from the Head Master of a school had been
submitted. This Court taking note of the observations
in Mukund Lal Bhandari's case (supra) held that
proof as required under the Scheme had to be
submitted. It was held that if proof as required under

LPA No.575/2001

Page 10 of 11

the Scheme was not submitted benefit could not be
granted.
16. Reliance was also placed upon the case of State
of Maharashtra v. Raghunath Gajanan reported in
2004 (6) SCALE 478, wherein it has again been
reiterated that it is for the Government to be satisfied
regarding genuineness of the claim and that the
Court cannot sit in judgment over the decision of the
State Government like an Appellate Authority. It has
been held that the Court cannot, while exercising writ
jurisdiction, enter into a re-appreciation of evidence
and/or reverse findings arrived at by the State
Government, unless they be perverse or be such as
no reasonable man acting reasonably could arrive at.
In this case, the Court noted the observations
Gurdial Singh's case (supra) and held that the
observations in Gurdial Singh's case (supra) do not
negate the standards laid down in Mukund Lal
Bhandari's case (supra) and that those standards
continue to apply.”

12.

In the absence of evidence the position does not begin to

jell.

We find no illegality in the order passed by the learned

Single Judge.

The appeal is meritless and therefore, the same is

dismissed.
