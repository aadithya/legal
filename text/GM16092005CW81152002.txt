1.
By way of this order I propose to dispose of CM
9620/2004 filed by the petitioner under Order 6 Rule 17 of the

1

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

Code of Civil Procedure for leave to amend the writ petition.
2.

The writ petition was filed by the petitioner originally

seeking the following prayers:“(a) issue a writ in the nature of mandamus
directing the respondent no.2 to pay to the
respondent no.3 or in the alternate reimburse to
the petitioner, the demurrage charges claimed
by the respondent no.3 in respect of Lot
No.6747 belonging to the petitioner; and
(b) issue a writ in the nature of mandamus
directing the respondent no.3 to decide the
representation dated 14.03.02 regarding the
levy of demurrage/port charges accumulated
and payable on the consignment after giving a
hearing to the petitioner.
( c) issue a writ in the nature of certiorari
quashing the impugned auction dated
07.11.2002 for being illegal and void having
been made without any notice to the petitioner
and even till date there being no intimation to
the petitioner in this regard.
(d) issue a writ in the nature of certiorari
quashing the impugned auction dated
07.11.2002 for being illegal and void;

3.

(e) pass such other orders as this Hon'ble Court
may deem fit and proper in the facts and
circumstances of the instant case.”
These prayers were based on the averments that the
2

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

petitioner had putforth a project in the joint sector with the
Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation Limited
(PSIDC) and the Steyr Landmaschinetechnik (SLT) at a total
cost of Rs.86.24 crores. An agreement dated 7.12.95 was signed
with the PSIDC while a technical collaboration agreement was
signed with SLT on 29.9.94. For the purposes of implementing
this project, the petitioner had been required to import certain
plant and equipment from Austria and an agreement for supply
of these machines was entered into on 5.11.97. All approvals
were taken from the Reserve Bank of India as well as
compliance effected with all then applicable statutory provisions
including the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. The petitioner
had effectuated all terms of its agreements and fulfilled all
commitments well before the cut off date of 31.3.1999 and an
advance payment was also released to the supplier on
30.11.1998.
4.

In order to facilitate import of the goods, the petitioner

was required to and had applied to the Director General Foreign
3

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

Trade(arrayed as respondent no.2 herein and referred to as
DGFT) for issuance of an Export Promotion of Capital Goods
licence (referred to as an EPCG licence hereafter) which was
granted in December, 1998.

An EPCG licence for balance

goods was applied for vide applications made on 24th & 27th
January, 2000 which was granted only in respect of two items
out of four items on 10th August, 2000. In respect of the other
two items as they were second hand in nature for which the
Government Import Policy had changed with effect from
31.3.1999, the DGFT required the petitioner to apply for a
Special Import Licence(SIL) for these.
applied for the same.

The petitioner also

The petitioner submits that this was

delayed without any justification.
5.

The entire consignment of all the items is stated to

have been imported under one lot. However on account of the
delay in grant of the SIL, partial clearing of the consignment for
which licence stood granted, was not allowed by the customs
since all the goods were imported under one Bill of Lading. The
4

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

Special Import Licence was issued only on 4.12.2001 after the
petitioner had been compelled to seek relief before the High
Court of Punjab and Haryana by way of CWP No.11801 of
2001.

While disposing off CWP No.1180/2001, vide order

dated 29th September, 2002, liberty was granted to the petitioner
to challenge levy of demurrage charges in accordance with law.
6.

The petitioner made every effort to get the goods

released thereafter.

However the goods were sold through

auction by the Mumbai Port Trust Mumbai on 07.11.2002
subject to confirmation whereby approval was required of the
Board of Trustees. This auction was without intimation to the
petitioner. On 20.11.2002 the petitioner received a letter from
the Mumbai Port Trust(respondent no.3 herein) that the
consignment could be cleared subject to depositing the Port
Trust Charges for the period upto 31.3.2003 within ten days.
Despite repeated requests, details of the charges was not being
informed to it while an arbitrary demand of Rs.1,99,73,633/was made against the petitioner.
5

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

7.

As the petitioner received information that the Board

of Trustees of the respondent no.3-Mumbai Port Trust were
meeting on 17.12.2002 to accord approval of the auction sale
conducted on 7.11.2002 in favour of the respondent no.4, the
petitioner rushed to this Court with the present writ petition
seeking the aforenoticed reliefs.
8.

Certain orders passed in the present matter which have

been adverted to by both the parties in support of their
arguments on this application are necessary to be noticed. On
17.12.2002 when the writ petition was listed for the first time,
this Court directed that upon the petitioner furnishing a bank
guarantee on or before 8.1.2003 to the satisfaction of the Joint
Registrar of this Court for a sum of Rs one crore from a
nationalised bank, the Mumbai Port Trust-respondent no.3 shall
not take any steps pursuant to the auction carried out on
7.11.2002.
9.

The petitioner did not comply with this direction.

Finally an application being CM 270/03 was filed on the plea
6

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

that there would be no need to furnish any bank guarantee since
the auction sale conducted on 7.11.2002 has been cancelled by
the respondent no.3 itself. Accordingly this Court was pleased
to clarify that as the auction sales stood cancelled, there would
be no need to furnish the bank guarantee.
10.

Thereafter the petitioner filed CM 1103/2003 on

25.1.2003 alleging that the respondent no.2 illegally and without
any basis rejected the grant of the SIL to the petitioner resulting
in the consignment being not available for clearance. It was
alleged by the petitioner that the demurrage charges were being
levied upon the respondent no.3 solely on account of the fault of
respondent no.2 and that in these circumstances, the respondent
no2 was liable to pay the demurrage charges claimed by the
respondent no.3 for the period, if not till 29.8.2002, then in any
case till 4.12.2001. It was also alleged that default on the part of
the respondent no.3 in not disposing of the petitioner's
application on 14.3.2002 seeking waiver of the demurrage
charges has further aggravated the situation and that all these
7

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

facts were brought to in the notice of this respondent as they
were party in the earlier writ petition no.11801/2001 filed by the
petitioner in Punjab & Haryana. This application was filed by
the petitioner on the plea that it had received a notice that the
petitioner's consignment was again being put to auction on
29.1.2003 and a stay of the sale was prayed for. It was further
prayed that the respondent no.2 should be called upon to provide
a bank guarantee to the respondent no.3 equivalent to the
amount of demurrage charges till 4.12.2001and thereupon, the
consignment be released in favour of the petitioner.
11.

This application came up for hearing before this Court

on 28.1.2003 when this Court directed that the auction of the
machinery of the petitioner may go on but the same would not
be confirmed till the next date of hearing.

The Court also

directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs one crore within
two weeks with the respondent no.3.
12.

The respondent no.3 informed the Court that the

application of the petitioner seeking the remission of demurrage
8

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

charges could not be considered for want of certain documents
from the petitioner. The petitioner through counsel stated that
the documents as demanded by the respondent no.3 shall be
supplied within seven days.

In these circumstances, the court

also directed that the respondent no.3 would take a decision
about remission of the demurrage charges within two weeks of
the receipt of the documents.
13.

The petitioner failed to abide by the directions made

vide this order also and filed CM 1767/2003 praying for
extension of time to make the deposit of Rs. one crore. An
undertaking was tendered by the petitioner through counsel that
the amount would be deposited within the extended time and an
undertaking of responsible officer would be filed in the Court to
this effect.

On such undertaking, vide the order dated 11th

February, 2003, the Court extended the time by another 10 days
to comply with the order dated 28.1.2003.
14.

On 26.2.2003, the court was informed that the amount

directed to be deposited had been deposited. It was further
9

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

informed by respondent no.3 that the auction scheduled on
29.1.2003 could not materialise and a fresh date of auction
would be notified. Time to submit the documents in terms of the
last order was also given to the petitioner.
15.

The petitioner had stated that the custom bills were to

be furnished by the customs department and the petitioner was
given liberty to approach it for such documents.
16.

On 28.4.2003, the matter was directed to be listed for

final disposal. The petitioner was given the liberty to file his
rejoinder and the parties were directed to file their synopsis.
The case could not be taken up for final disposal on 23.5.2003.
17.

On the next date of hearing i.e 1.9.2003, an

application being CM 9757/2003 seeking impleadment of the
customs department as respondent was filed by the petitioner
before the Court.
18.

This application was filed on the plea that in order to

comply with the order dated 26.2.2003, the clearing agent of the
petitioner was informed that a No Objection Certificate was
10

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

required to get clearance of the consignment. The clearing agent
of the petitioner approached the Deputy Commissioner of
Customs vide letter dated 10.3.2003 for the requisite No
Objection Certificate but was made to run from pillar to post
resulting in an inordinate and inexplicable delay caused by the
Department of Customs in noting the bill of the entry and
fulfilling the other formalities. It was contended that despite the
petitioner fulfilling all requirements, the Department of Customs
had failed to carry out the necessary steps to enable the release
of the consignment to the petitioner.
19.

In these circumstances the Court was pleased to allow

CM 9757/2003 vide an order dated 1.9.2003 and directed
impleadment of the Customs Department as respondent no.5.
The writ petition was directed to be posted for final arguments.
20.

Thereafter, the petitioner brought an application being

CM 797/2004 dated 31.1.2004 seeking the following prayers:“(a) pass an order holding the respondent no.5
as being liable to pay the demurrage for the
period from 05.05.2003, when the petitioner
11

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

submitted that Bill of entry for noting with the
respondent no.5, till such period when the Bill
of entry is actually noted by the respondent no.5,
and direct as such.
(b) pass such further order(s) as this Hon'ble
Court may deem fit and proper in the facts and
circumstances of the case.”
21.

The present application being CM 9620/2004 was

filed thereafter only on 13.8.2004 seeking leave to amend the
petition to incorporate additional pleas against the respondent
no5 and to add paras 40-A to 40-I, an amended para 40 as well
as to incorporate an additional plea as para 47(c1) in the writ
petition. The amended writ petition has been filed alongwith.
22.

This application has been vehemently opposed on

behalf of respondent no.3. Despite repeated opportunities to
respondents 1,2 & 5, no reply thereto has even been filed. The
application however has been orally opposed on their behalf.
23.

The principal grounds for opposition to the grant of

the prayer for amendment are that the petitioner seeks relief
against the customs department, which amounts to a separate

12

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

cause of action and hence the petitioner should be required to
file a separate writ petition. It is further contended that the
entire conduct of the petitioner was to delay adjudication, that
the application was highly belated and that the petitioner has no
right to maintain such application which is a mala fide after
thought.

Reliance in this behalf is placed on the

pronouncements reported at 1990(2) SCC 42 (at para 9) entitled
Patasi Bai vs. Ratan Lal and 2000(1) AD Delhi 864 (at para 3)
entitled Manmohan vs Sham Lal. It is further contended that the
resultant loss by the delay cannot be compensated and the
auction cannot be held as none comes forward to buy the
consignment on account of the pendency of this litigation. It is
further submitted that because of the interim order passed by this
Court and deposit of merely Rupees one crore, the petitioner's
goods have not been auctioned whereas the petitioner's liability
on account of demurrage charges is to the extent of over Rs.3
crores.
24.

It is further contended that the prayer clause sought to
13

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

be amended is contrary to the settled law inasmuch as the Apex
Court has held that irrespective of the fact as to where the fault
lies, the exporter has to pay the demurrage. Reliance in this is
placed on 1995(3) SCC 151(para 66 at page 187) entitled
International Airport Authority of India vs. Grand Slam and on
the judgment reported at 2002(1) SCC 718(para 16) entitled
Union of India vs. R.C. Fabrics wherein it was held that
direction to the customs authorities to pay demurrage is contrary
to the law. The respondents have also placed reliance on the
pronouncement of the Apex Court reported at 2001(5) SCC 345
entitled Shipping Corporation of India Limited vs. C.L.Jain
Woollen Mills and others. It is contended that an amendment
contrary to law cannot be permitted and as such the present
application deserves to be rejected.
25.

Learned counsel for the respondent also contended

that the present application was based on the same facts as were
averred by the petitioner in CM 9757/2003 and CM 797/2004, it
was apparent that the petitioner was fully aware of its case
14

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

against the respondent no.5 and has substantially delayed
adjudication in the present matter.
26.

I have given my thoughtful consideration to the

submissions made on behalf of both the parties. From the record
I find that the petitioner filed its written submissions in support
of its writ petition on Court record as back as on 22.5.2003
which are available at page 216 of the paper book.
27.

CM 9757/2003 was filed by the petitioner as the

petitioner asked for impleadment of the Customs Authorities in
order to comply with the requirement of the respondent no3 as
noticed in the order dated 26.2.2003. On account of delays by
the Customs Authorities in issuing the required documents, the
petitioner was defaulting in respect of the period granted by this
court on 26.2.2003. The presence of the Customs Authorities as
respondent no.5 was hence sought by the petitioner in order to
get effective directions against this respondent.
28.

It is noteworthy that the Customs Department was

permitted to be impleaded as a party on 1.9.2003.
15

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

29.

So far as ordinary civil jurisdiction is concerned, the

provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure mandate that the
plaint shall be amended when a party is added as a defendant as
per Order 1 Rule 10(4).

Applying the same principles,

necessary amendments to the writ petition ought to have been
effected in order to make out any case against the respondent
no.5. Else, respondent no.5 would remain a mere party arrayed
as a respondent without there being any averments or prayer
against it.
30.

I find that in the judgment of the Apex Court relied

upon on behalf of respondent no.3 in (1995) 3 SCC 151 entitled
International Airports Authority of India and others vs. Grand
Salam International case, the Court was really concerned with
the jurisdiction of the Customs Authorities to prohibit recovery
of demurrage by the Port Authority. The court observed that the
purpose of the Customs Act on the one hand and the Major Ports
Trust Act and the International Airports Authority Act on the
other are different. Upon examination of the statutory scheme,
16

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

the Court concluded that none of the provisions of the Customs
Act entitled a Collector of Customs to debar the collections of
demurrage for the storage of imported goods. They also did not
entitled him to impose conditions upon the proprietors of Ports
or 'Airports before they can be approved as Customs Ports or
Customs Airports. It was observed by the Apex Court that it
was true that by reason of unjustified detention of his goods by
the Customs Authorities, the importer is put to loss by having to
pay demurrage charges for the period of such detention. In such
a circumstance, it was held by the Apex Court that the Central
Government is empowered by Section 35 of the International
Airports Authority Act, 1971 and Section 111 of the Major Port
Trust Act 1963 to issue to the authority and the Board of
Trustees of the Ports respectively, appropriate directions not to
levy demurrage charges for parties covered by the detention
certificates after giving them an opportunity, as far as
practicable of expressing their views.
31.

Careful reading of the pronouncement of the Apex
17

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

Court shows that the Court was concerned with the power of the
Customs Authorities to make orders with regard to the
demurrage which was payable under the Major Port Trust Act or
the International Airports Authority Act.

The Court was

examining a direction made by the High Court on a construction
of Section 45(2) of the Customs Act, 1962 directing the release
of imported goods without payment of any demurrage charges
for the period for which detention certificate had been issued by
the Customs Authorities. It was concluded that no provision of
the Customs Act permitted such exemption from collection of
demurrage.
32.

The pronouncement of the Apex Court reported at

(2002) 1 SCC 718 entitled Union of India and another vs. R.C.
Fabrics and another was made in a case where the Customs
Authorities on examining goods belonging to the respondent
importer found that 843.85 meters fabric was excess in length.
On a request of the importer for waiver of the show cause
notice,

Assistant Collector passed an order dated 21st
18

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

September, 1990 whereby the importer was allowed release of
the excess goods after payment of fine as well as personal
penalty. The amounts were deposited on 22nd September, 1990
as also the customs duty on the excess goods.
On 22nd September, 1990 itself, the DRI officers
detained the consignment on the basis of information available
with them and detained the goods on 15th November, 1990. A
writ petition had been filed by the importer on 7th November,
1990 for release of the goods.
In the meantime a formal order was passed by the
Assistant Commissioner of Customs on 15th January, 1991 on
the lines on which the order dated 21st September, 1990 was
passed. The Department was allowed to investigate the matter
further by the High Court which directed the Department to give
opportunity to show cause to the importer and adjudicate the
matter within a week. On 18th February, 1991 a notice to show
cause was issued and by an order dated 25th February, 1991 the
Additional Collector Customs ordered confiscation of the goods
19

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

but allowed the same to be redeemed on payment of redemption,
fine, appropriate duty as well as the penalty imposed on the
Directors of the Company.
33.

The High Court set aside the order dated 25th February,

1991 passed against R.C.Fabrics on grounds of violation of
principles of natural justice in not seeking a reply of the
importer. On remand, the Collector in terms of the order dated
22nd October, 1993 discharged the show cause notice dated 18th
February, 1991 and dropped the proceedings holding that in
view of the order of adjudication dated 15th January, 1991 there
cannot be another adjudication order in respect of the same
consignment.

The Government challenged the order of the

Tribunal upholding the Collector's order dated 22nd October,
1993 before the Apex Court placing reliance on observations
made by the High Court in the writ petition.
34.

In these circumstances it was held by the Apex Court

that a test report which was obtained subsequently was not
before the Assistant Collector when it passed the order resulting
20

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

in the formal order dated 15th January, 1991 and that this matter
could not have been brushed aside by the Assistant
Commissioner on principles of res judicata or constructive res
judicata. In these circumstances the judgment of the High Court
and orders of the Tribunal and the Collector were set aside. It
was in such facts observed by the Supreme Court that the
direction of the High Court that the Customs Department would
pay the demurrage was contrary to the decision of the Apex
Court in the Grand Slam International case(supra) and was so set
aside.
35.

At this stage it would be proper to examine the

pronouncement of the Supreme Court in the judgment reported
at (2001) 5 SCC 345 entitled Shipping Corporation of India
Limited vs. C.L.Jain Woollen Mills and others.
36.

In this case the Court was examining the carrier's right

under a bill of lading to claim demurrage charges and whether
the same was effected by a detention order passed by the
authorities under the Customs Act. An order was passed by the
21

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

Customs Authorities while the goods were still in the custody of
the carriers. At the instance of an importer, in a proceeding to
which the carrier was not a party, the High Court held a
confiscation order to be illegal and directed the goods to be
released to the importer without payment of any detention or
demurrage charges and that the direction became final.

In

separate proceedings the High Court directed that the demurrage
or detention charges, if any, payable would be paid by the
Customs Authorities. In such circumstances it was held that the
Customs Authorities could not restrain the carrier from claiming
demurrage charges. The Court examined the provisions of the
Customs Act 1962 in detail and held as follows:“xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
5.
It
is
apparent
from
Sections
8,33,34,45,47,49,57,58,62,63 and 2(43) of the
Customs Act, 1962 that the Customs Authorities
have full power and control over the imported
goods and without their permission the goods
cannot be cleared. But at the same time, there is
no provision in the Customs Act conferring
power on the Customs Authorities to prohibit or
injunct any other authority where the imported
goods are stored from charging the demurrage
22

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

charges for the services rendered for storing the
imported goods.
Xxxxxxxxxx
Under the Indian Bills of Lading Act, 1956,
every consignee of goods, named in a bill of
lading and every endorsee of a bill of lading, is
vested with absolute right over the goods. The
bill of lading is a well-known mercantile
document of title, which is transferred in the
business world by endorsement passing to the
endorsee, the title of the goods covered by such
Bill of Lading.
Xxxxxxxxxxxx
7. Leaving aside Sections 170 and 171 of the
Contract Act, the very terms of the contract and
the provisions of the bill of lading
unequivocally conferred power on the appellant
to retain the goods until the dues were paid.
Such rights accruing in favour of the appellant
cannot be nullified by issuance of a certificate of
detention by the Customs Authorities unless for
such issuance of detention certificate any
provisions of the Customs Act authorise. There
is no provision in the Customs Act which would
enable the Customs Authorities to compel the
carrier not to charge demurrage charges. The
Customs Authorities might have bona fide
initiated the proceedings for confiscation of the
goods which however, ultimately turned out to
be unsuccessful and the Court held the same to
be illegal. But that by itself, would not clothe
the Customs Authorities with the power to direct
the carrier not to charge any demurrage charges
23

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

37.

nor the so-called issuance of detention
certificate would prohibit the carrier from
raising any demand towards demurrage charges
which the proprietor of the space is entitled to
charge from the importer. The importer also
will not be entitled to remove his goods from the
premises unless customs clearance is given. But
that would not mean that demurrage charges
could not be levied on the importer for the space
his goods have occupied, since the contract
between the importer and the proprietor of the
space is in no way altered because of the orders
issued by the Customs Authorities.”
After so observing, the Apex Court found that the

judgment of the High Court which entitled the importer to get
the goods released without payment of the detention and
demurrage charges had become final. In these facts the Court
held as follows:“ In the contextual facts, notwithstanding the
judgment of the High Court, the goods not
having been released, the impugned order and
direction cannot be held to be infirm in any
manner. In the absence of any provision in the
Customs Act entitling the Customs Officer to
prohibit the owner of the space, where the
imported goods have been stored, from levying
the demurrage charges, levy of demurrage
charges for non-release of the goods is in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the
contract and as such would be a valid levy. The
24

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

38.

conclusion of the High /Court to the effect that
the detention of the goods by the Customs
Authorities was illegal and such illegal detention
prevented the importer from releasing the goods,
the Customs Authorities would be bound to bear
the demurrage charges in the absence of any
provision in the Customs Act, absolving the
Customs Authorities from that liability. Section
45(2)(b) of the Customs Act cannot be construed
to have clothed the Customs Authorities with the
necessary powers so as to absolve them of the
liability of paying the demurrage charges. The
goods in question, having already been directed
to be released, without the payment of the
demurrage charges, the importer must have got
the goods released. Having regard to the fact
situation of the present case, both the carriers are
directed to waive the demurrage charges in case
an application is filed by the Customs
Authorities.”
The position which emerges in law is that the liability

to pay demurrage for the period where the space of the
Port/Airport/Warehousing Authorities is occupied is, therefore,
absolute unless there is a consent to waive such demurrage by
the

concerned Port Authority Trust or the Warehousing

Authority in this behalf. Waiver thereof may be admissible or
granted in the eventualities set out here-in-above in specific fact
situations. So far as the Port Trust Authority is concerned, in
25

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

view of the statutory provisions, it would enforce such liability
against the importer.

The Apex Court has considered the

possibility where the action of the Customs Authorities was
bonafide.
However, there are cases where the action or orders of
the Customs Authorities could not be sustained upon judicial
review or on re-examination by the Customs Authorities
themselves. In such fact situations, it was noticed by the Apex
Court in 1995(3) SCC 151 that the Central Government was
empowered under Section 35 of the International Airports Act
1971 and Section 111 of the Major Port Trust Act 1963 to issue
to the Airport Authority and the Board of Trustees respectively,
directions not to levy demurrage charges for periods covered by
detention certificates, after giving them an opportunity, as far as
practicable of expressing their views.
39.

Close reading of these judgments shows that the court

was concerned with the issue of payment of demurrage to the
Port/Airport/Warehousing Authorities for occupation of its
26

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

space. It is nowhere laid down as an absolute proposition and
principle in law that an importer cannot seek payment or
reimbursement of such charges from the Customs Authorities in
case it could be shown that the liability to pay such charges
arose on account of fault or delays attributable to such
authorities. No such issue had been raised on behalf of the
importer in the cases before the Apex Court.
40.

In the instant case the petitioner has been permitted to

implead the Department of Customs by an order passed by this
Court by way of the amendment in the writ petition, the
petitioner seeks to incorporate pleas relating to the Customs
Department to make out a case of inordinate and inexplicable
delay on the part of the Department of Customs in noting the bill
of entry and completing other formalities which were to follow
despite the petitioner striving to get its goods released after
completion of all formalities. The correctness of these pleas is
not to be tested by me at this stage.
41.

I find that there is no dispute being raised by the
27

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

petitioner, by way of the amendment, to the liability to pay the
charges of demurrage to the Port Trust Authority.

On the

contrary it is being contended that the respondent no.5Department of Customs be required to pay the demurrage
charges to the respondent no.3 Mumbai Port Trust.
petitioner is also seeking to incorporate

The

a prayer in the

alternative whereby it seeks directions to the Customs
Authorities to reimburse to the petitioner the demurrage charges
due to the respondent no.3 Mumbai Port Trust in respect of the
imports of the petitioner from the period of 5th May, 2003 which
is the date of submission of the bill of entry to the Customs
Authorities by the petitioner, till the time of actual getting of the
bill of entry.
42.

I find that such pleas and prayer are not prohibited by

any pronouncement of the Apex Court and, therefore, the
contention of the respondent to the effect that the pleas and
prayers sought to be incorporated by amendment are prohibited
by law is without merit.
28

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

43.

It is settled law that while examining an application

seeking amendment of a petition which is not open to a Court to
examine the merits and demerits of the pleas. Consequently it is
made clear that nothing contained in the present judgment is an
expression on the merits of the pleas or the claims urged on
behalf of the petitioner.
44.

The respondents have objected to the maintainability

of the application also on the ground of delay. The petitioner
has explained that despite orders passed by this Court, the
respondent no.5 failed to make available the requested
documents. The petitioner tried its utmost to get the release of
these documents and it was only on account of the inordinate
and unjustified delay on the part of the respondent no.5 that it
has been constrained to file the application seeking amendment
of the petition. The petitioner has contended that it submitted
the bill of entry to the respondent no.5 as back on 5th May, 2003
but the same has not been noted by the respondent no.5 till the
filing of the application dated 20th January, 2004. It has been
29

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

explained that it is only in these circumstances that the petitioner
has sought relief made in the application for amendment.
45.

I find force in the submission on behalf of the learned

counsel for the petitioner that the application is based on facts
which have arisen after the filing of the writ petition.

The

factual matrix for and material adjudication of the pleas sought
to be incorporated is on record. It is the pleas on which the
respondent no.5 has been added as a party respondent, which are
being sought to be incorporated.

The respondents have not

assailed this order permitting the impleadment. For this reason
the judgment relied upon by the respondent in Patasi Bai and
others vs. Ratan Lal's case(supra) would have no application to
the instant case.
46.

I further find that this Court in the judgment reported

at (2000) 1 AD(Delhi) 864 entitled Manmohan Vs. ShriSham
Lal and others held that the Court would not allow the
amendments which would prolong the litigation or set up a new
case which is patently false. It cannot be held at this stage that
30

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

the pleas of the petitioner are false. There is no reply on record
by the respondent no.5 to this application and as on date the
averments of the petitioner against this respondent remain
unrebutted.
47.

It is also noteworthy that the respondent no.3 has not

been able to auction the goods despite its best efforts. The
petitioner, in compliance of the order of this Court, has
deposited an amount of Rs.one crore with the respondents. I
also find that after 23.1.2004, the matter could not be taken up
for final disposal for reasons which cannot be attributed to the
petitioner. The respondent no.5 Customs Department having
been impleaded as a party, the necessary averments in support
of its being so arraigned would be required to be placed on
record. I have noticed that the petitioner did file its written
submissions to support the writ petition as back as on 22 nd
May,2003.
48.

It can, however, not be disputed that the petitioner

could have made this application alongwith CM 9757/2003
31

CM 9620/2004 in WP (C) NO. 8115/2002

whereby it had sought impleadment of the respondent no.5 as a
party respondent. The petitioner would, therefore, deserve to
compensate the respondent no.3 for the resultant delay by an
order of costs.
49.

Accordingly this application is allowed subject to

payment of costs of Rs.25,000/- by the petitioner. Out of this
amount, the petitioner shall pay a sum of Rs.15,000/- as costs to
respondent no.3, a sum of Rs.5,000/- shall be deposited with the
Delhi High Court Legal Services Authority and a sum of
Rs.5,000/- with the Advocate Welfare Fund within a period of
two weeks from today. The application having been allowed,
the amended petition filed alongwith is taken on record.
