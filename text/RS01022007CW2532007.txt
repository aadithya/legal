REKHA SHARMA, J.
Ghanshyam an employee of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation
is aggrieved by the non-acceptance of his resignation from the service
by the said organization, non-sanction of his leave for his absence on

W.P.(C) 253/2007

page 1 of 6

24.9.2006, 25.9.2006, 29.9.2006 and 10.11.2006 to 5.12.2006 and
non-release of his salary for the period 1.10.2006 onwards. Hence,
this writ petition.
The petitioner - Ghanshyam joined the Delhi Metro Rail
Corporation(DMRC) as DSL Mechanic on 28.2.2004.

His offer of

appointment dated 26.2.2004 contains the terms and conditions of his
employment of which clauses 8 & 9 are relevant for the present
purpose. They are as under:-

8. The minimum Notice period of â€œthree months is
required for preferring resignation by employee.
However, the Management reserves the right not
to accept your resignation if the circumstances so
warrant, such as pending/anticipated disciplinary
proceedings, exigencies of work or for any other
reasons as considered appropriate by the
Management.
9. You will by required to execute a bond for
Rs.40,000/- (Rupees forty thousand only) to serve
this Corporation for a minimum period of
3
years (inclusive of the probation period) from the
date of joining the services. The condition of 3
years' service is without prejudice to probation
period. The power to terminate your services will
vest with the Management under whose authority
your services are placed.

It is the case of the petitioner that he found his job
arduous in nature and, therefore, he tendered his resignation on
15.9.2006 with a request that he may be released from service as
early as possible by waving the condition of three months notice as
contained in clause 8

W.P.(C) 253/2007

of the

terms of his appointment.

By a

page 2 of 6

subsequent letter dated 19.9.2006, he requested that he may be
released w.e.f. 1.11.2006.

The DMRC responded to the letter of

resignation on 15.12.2006 by which date the requirement of three
months' notice stood met yet it declined to accept his resignation. It
took the stand that the petitioner after submitting the resignation had
not performed his duty and had remained absent w.e.f. 10.11.2006
onwards and also remained on unauthorized leave on 29.9.2006,
24.9.2006 to 25.9.2006, 3.10.2006 and 16.10.2006.

Because of his

alleged absence from duty on the said dates it was communicated to
him that he had not fulfilled the condition of minimum three months
notice. The DMRC further took the stand that in terms of clause 9 of
the offer of appointment he was required to serve the organization for
a minimum period of three years and in order to bind him he was
suppose to execute a bond for an amount of Rs.40,000/-. Therefore, it
was also communicated to him that since he had not served the
organization for a period of three years he should deposit Rs.40,000/in lieu of the bond and Rs.12,020/- towards notice pay in lieu of short
period notice through a demand draft in favour of Delhi Metro Rail
Corporation so that his case for resignation could be processed
accordingly.
The question is whether the stand of the DMRC in not
accepting the resignation of the petitioner on the expiry of three

W.P.(C) 253/2007

page 3 of 6

months period w.e.f. 15.12.2006 could be held to be justified.
It is not in dispute that in terms of clause 8 of the appointment
letter, the petitioner was required to give three months notice of his
intention to resign which he did. The purpose and the object in
requiring an employee to give notice of his intention to resign is to put
the employer on notice that the employee will not be available to
render his services after the expiry of the notice period. Therefore, if
the employer so chooses he may, in the meanwhile, make alternative
arrangement. There is nothing in clause 8 of the appointment letter
which bars an employee from taking leave during the currency of the
notice period if otherwise he has leave to his credit and he is entitled
to the same. As such, mere tendering of resignation with a notice
period of three months cannot take away the rights available to the
employee such as leave etc. The reason is that he continues to be in
service till the expiry of the notice period. In this view of the matter
the stand of the DMRC that the petitioners resignation letter fell short
of three months notice because during that period he took leave
cannot be accepted.
It is also the case of the DMRC that the petitioner was
unauthorizedly absent on the dates mentioned above. The explanation
of the petitioner is that he had applied for casual leave for 24.9.2006,
25.9.2006 and for restricted holiday on 29.9.2006. Regarding his

W.P.(C) 253/2007

page 4 of 6

absence from 10.11.2006 to 5.12.2006 his case is that he was not well
and had submitted his medical certificate from G.T.B.Hospital.
According to the petitioner, his applications for leave are pending
consideration with DMRC and he has not heard anything about the
fate of the same. The DMRC also has not produced before me any
communication to show that the applications of the petitioner for
leave have been processed.
As regards the demand of DMRC from the petitioner to deposit a
sum of Rs.40,000/- for not serving the organization for a period of
three years, the case of the petitioner is that he did not fill up any
bond as per clause 9 of the appointment letter and as such the said
clause cannot be enforced against him. The DMRC has not produced
any bond executed by the petitioner in terms of clause 9.
A glance at clause 9 indicates that the

demand for a sum of

Rs.40,000/- can be made only if an employee has executed a bond.
Since, as per the petitioner, no bond was executed by him and as none
was produced before me, it is assumed that the condition of service as
laid down in clause 9 was waived

in his case. The DMRC has also

made a demand of Rs.12,020/- from the employee towards notice pay
in lieu of short period notice. As it has been held by me that there was
no bar in the petitioner taking leave during the currency of the notice
period there is no question of any short period notice.

W.P.(C) 253/2007

In view of what has been noticed above, I hold, that the
resignation letter of the petitioner dated 15.9.2006 was in order. It
ought to have been accepted on the expiry of three months notice.
This having not been done, the same is deemed to have been
accepted.

The petitioner shall be taken to have been relieved from

service w.e.f. 15.12.2006.

As regards the absence of the petitioner

on the dates mentioned above, the DMRC is directed to pass an order
on his leave applications and if he is found to be unauthorizedly
absent from duties, his salary for the said dates may be deducted. If
any amount is due to him towards salary from the month of October
onwards that should be released to him within one month from the
date of this order. The writ petition stands disposed of.
