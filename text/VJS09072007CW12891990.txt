as Essex Farms. On 8.6.1990 this Court had restrained the

In the writ petition it has been asseverated that

the Petitioner is a company incorporated under the Indian

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 4 of 88

Companies Act and that it is conducting its business from
Essex Farms for the last fifty years, which was initially
notified for acquisition for public purpose vide Notification
dated 13.11.1959 issued under Section 4 of the Land
Acquisition Act (hereinafter referred to as `the Act') for the
“Planned Development of Delhi”. This Notification was
followed-up by a Declaration dated 11.1.1969 issued under
Section 6 of the Act. It has been asserted that, by virtue
of the amended provisions contained in Section 11-A of the
Act as introduced into the statute in 1984, these actions
would automatically lapse should the Land

Acquisition

Collector fail to publish an Award on or before 23.9.1986.
The Petitioner alleges that the Delhi Administration had

It is further contended that despite the fact that the land
had remained under acquisition for about 27 years the
Respondents had issued the impugned Notification under

Section 4 read

the statutory right of the

Petitioner to file objections under Section 5A of the Act. It
is asserted in the petition that the Lt. Governor had not
adequately applied his mind while issuing a Notification
under Section 4 read with Section 17 of the Act and that in
any event the “Planned Development of Delhi (PDD)” is not
a purpose which justifies invocation of Section 17 of the
Act. The Notification is challenged as being a colourable
exercise of power, having been issued without application
of mind, with malafide intentions and ulterior motives. The
Petitioner's protestation is that various other properties
constructed alongside the existing road, namely, Aurobindo
Marg, and in alignment with Essex Farms land have not
been acquired. So far as the creation of a Shopping Centre
is concerned the petitioner alleges that a number of such
establishments have already come into existence in the
environs, thus satiating this need.

5.

So far as the Delhi Development Authority (DDA)

is concerned the response is that the acquisition of land for

being acquired by invoking emergency powers of Section

The assertion that

Counter Affidavit has also been filed on behalf of

Land & Building Department, Delhi Administration wherein
the previous Notifications and Declarations have been
admitted.

Reliance has been placed on an Order dated

29.11.1990

which clarifies, inter alia, that since the

sundry awards have been declared “now the question of
leaving out built-up land for acquisition etc. is decided on
merits in each and every case,

the decisions/priorities

in the said letter of 19-8-86 may please be

Reliance has been

placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in Kendriya

Karamchari Sahkari Grih Nirman Samiti Ltd. -vs- The New
Okhla Industrial Development Authority, AIR 1988 SC 1 in
which it has been held that Guidelines ought not to exist in
addition to

statutory provisions.

It has further been

pleaded that the provisions of Section 17 of the Act have
been correctly invoked as the public purpose is one of
grave urgency.

7.

By Memorandum dated 18.1.1999 the Petitioner

had lodged a request with the Vice Chairman, DDA for
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 8 of 88

denotification under Section 48(1) of the Act and for the
modification of land use in MPD-2001.

In the course of

hearings various affidavits have been filed by the Petitioner
with the objective of placing documents on record showing
that the concerned road does not need to be widened any
further and that since a Shopping Centre has been
developed contiguous or close to the subject land it no
longer needs to be acquired for the creation of a Shopping
Centre.
LOCUS STANDI OF PETITIONS AS
TENANTS OF THE ACQUIRED LAND
8.

Ms.

Takiar,

learned

counsel

for

DDA,

has

challenged the locus standi of the Petitioner to assail the
subject land acquisition proceedings on the ground that
avowedly it is a mere statutory tenant in occupation, on the
strength of Radhey Shyam Gupta -vs- Union of India, 107
(2003) DLT 696(DB). The Division Bench held in paragraph
43 that since the owners had not objected to the land
acquisition

proceedings

the

Petitioners/tenants

cannot

object thereto. The Division Bench further opined that the
“right of persons other than the owners in land acquisition
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 9 of 88

proceedings is only to claim compensation, if entitled to in
accordance with law”. Ms. Takiar has also emphasised the
fact that the lease had expired by efflux of time and
therefore it is questionable whether the Petitioner would at
all be entitled to receive compensation.
learned

Senior

Counsel

appearing

on

Mr. Rohtagi,
behalf

of

the

Petitioner, countered these arguments by highlighting that
Section 5A of the Act bestows the right to file Objections
on “any person interested in the land” in contradistinction
to the “owner of the land”.

We find that the Act (in

particular Sections 9,10, 12 etc.) is unflaggingly concerned
with the person

interested in the land rather than the

owner of the acquired land. The proviso to Section 4(2)
speaks of the “occupier”.

In fact Section 5A(3) declares

that a person shall be deemed to be interested in the land if
he

would

be

entitled

to

claim

compensation against acquisition.

an

interest

in

the

Apart from explicitly

enabling all persons interested in the land to object to the
acquisition, the rights of tenants cannot be endangered or
jeopardised by the actions or inaction of third parties,
including the owner. Reference can usefully be made to the
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 10 of 88

decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in

C.B. Gautum -vs- Union of India, (1993) 1 SCC 78 wherein
the vires of sub-section (1) of Section 269UD of the Income
Tax Act had been questioned. This provision empowered
the Central Government to purchase properties, which
were in the process of being sold, at the price stated in the
documents, “free from all encumbrances”.

The Supreme

Court declined even to read down the Section so as to save
it from the vice of offending Article 14 of the Constitution
since the rights of tenants were irretrievably and adversely
affected. Keeping in mind the brevity of the observations in

Radhey Shyam Gupta, it is apparent that our learned
Brothers did not intend to lay down any principle of
law

of

general application.

Furthermore, a similar

objection had been raised in Union of India -vs- Krishan

Lal Arneja, AIR 2004 SC 3582 namely, that a tenant is not
competent to challenge the acquisition proceedings. The
Court opined that it was “clear from Section 5-A (3) of the
Act that for the purpose of the said Section, a person shall
be deemed to be interested in land who would be entitled to
claim

an interest in compensation if

WP(C) 1289/1990

the

land were
page 11 of 88

acquired.

In an appropriate

case, a tenant

having

sufficient subsisting interest in the land can challenge the
acquisition proceedings.” Much has been made of the fact
that the term of the lease had expired and the Petitioner is
a statutory tenant under the Delhi Rent Control Act. As to
whether such a statutory tenant can raise objections
against acquisition when the real owner/landlord is not
doing so.

Can a statutory tenant under the Delhi Rent

Control Act have rights over and above the rights of the
owner and the landlord?

Since main thrust of the case is

as to whether in the facts and circumstances of this case
the Respondents ought to have been given an opportunity
to file objections, we are leaving the question of locus
standi open, at this stage and shall deal with it if need be,
after the main issue is decided.
EFFECT OF APPLICATION UNDER SECTION
48 OF THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT
FOR DENOTIFICATION
9.

We must forthwith clarify that no prayer has

been made in the context of denotification of the land in
this writ petition.

WP(C) 1289/1990

This question has arisen because the

page 12 of 88

Petitioner has in its Rejoinder referred to its its letter dated
18-1-1999 addressed to the Vice-Chairman DDA requesting
for (i) Denotification and (ii) modification of land use in
MPD-2001-AD. The Petitioner had adverted to its several
Representations on this subject matter, and specifically to
the Respondent's letter dated 23-6-2000 informing the
Petitioner that its “request for change of land use can be
examined only after the issue of denotification of land from
acquisition is sorted out”. Emphasis has also been placed
on the fact that the Policy for Denotification has been filed
by the Petitioner. It is on this sequence that Mr.Poddar,
as

well

as Ms. Takiar, learned Counsel

for the

Respondents, have predicated the argument that the
Petitioner must be deemed to have elected to abandon
and/or waive its challenge to the acquisition proceedings
especially since the request for denotification has been
made after the publication of the Award. According to
them, if the Petitioner is permitted to press this Petition,
the

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 13 of 88

10.

Mr.Rohtagi

has

stoutly

challenged

this

contention on the ground that (a) a decision under Section
48 is only of administrative or executive character, which
brooks no challenge in Court if the principle of natural
justice have been complied with by the Authorities since
detailed reasons need not be articulated; (b) such a
representation cannot act as a waiver to a challenge to the
acquisition proceedings unless it is manifest that the
former was made with prejudice to the latter.

Our

attention has been attracted towards the following extract
from Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co.Ltd. -vs- State of

Uttar Pradesh, (1979) 2 SCC 409, which delineates the
parameters of what constitutes waiver in legal firmament:5.

“We shall first deal with the question of waiver

since that can be disposed of in a few words. The
High Court held that even if there was an assurance
given by respondent 4 on behalf of the State
Government and such assurance was binding on the
State government on the principle of promissory
estoppel, the appellant had waived its right under it
by accepting the concessional rates of sales tax set
out in the letter of respondent 5 dated January
20,1970.
WP(C) 1289/1990

We do not think this view taken by the
page 14 of 88

High Court can be sustained. In the first place, it is
elementary that waiver is a question of fact and it
must be properly pleaded and proved.

No plea of

waiver can be allowed to be raised unless it is
pleaded and the factual foundation for it is laid in
the pleadings. Here it was common ground that the
plea

of

waiver

was

not

taken

by

the

State

Government in the affidavit filed on its behalf in
reply to the writ petition, nor was it indicated even
vaguely in such affidavit. It was raised for the first
time at the hearing of the writ petition. That was
clearly impermissible without an amendment of the
affidavit in reply or a supplementary affidavit
raising such plea. If waiver were properly pleaded
in the affidavit in reply, the appellant would have
had an opportunity of placing on record facts
showing

why

and

in

what

circumstances

the

appellant came to address the letter dated June 25,
1970 and establishing that on these facts there was
no waiver by the appellant of its right to exemption
under the assurance given by respondent 4. But in
the absence of such pleading in the affidavit in
reply, this opportunity was denied to the appellant.
It was, therefore, not right for the High Court to
have allowed the plea of waiver to be raised against
the appellant and that plea should have been
rejected in limine.

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 15 of 88

6.

Secondly, it is difficult to see how, on the facts,

the plea of waiver could be said to have been made
out by the State Government.

Waiver means

abandonment of a right and it may be either express
or implied from conduct, but its basic requirement
is

that

it

must

be

“an

intentional

act

with

knowledge.” Per Lord Chelmsford, L.C. in Earl of

Darnley v. London, Chatham, and Dover Rly.Co.
There can be no waiver unless the person who is
said to have waived is fully informed as to his right
and

with

full

knowledge

intentionally abandons it.

of

such

right,

he

It is pointed out in

Halsbury's Laws of England (4th edn.) Volume 16 in
paragraph 1472 at page 994 that for a “waiver to be
effectual it is essential that the person granting it
should be fully informed as to his rights” and Issacs,
J. delivering the judgment of the High Court of
Australia

in

Craine

v.

Colonial

Mutual

Fire

Insurance Co. Ltd., has also emphasized that waiver
“must be with knowledge, an essential supported by
many authorities”. Now in the present case there is
nothing to show that at the date when the appellant
addressed the letter dated June 25, 1970, it had full
knowledge of its right to exemption under the
assurance given by respondent 4 and that it
intentionally abandoned such right.”

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 16 of 88

In Special Land Acquisition Officer -vs- Godrej

11.

and Boyce, (1988) 1 SCC 50, the Apex Court has opined
that “having regard to the scheme of the Land Acquisition
Act it is difficult to see why the State Government should at
all be compelled to give any cogent reason for a decision
not to go ahead with its proposal to acquire a piece of
land”.

In Radhasoami Satsang Beas -vs- Union of India,

2005(82) DRJ 664 (DB), the land owner had endeavoured to
challenge

the

order

of

denotification

made

by

the

concerned Committee. The Division Bench held that “there
is no legal right vested in the owner of the land to compel
the Government to denotify the land. ...... The Government
is expected to act fairly and the scope of Section 48 cannot
be placed at parity with the quasi-judicial functions, as the
plain language of the Section suggests that it is an
administrative power which may be exercised by the State
in consonance with the settled cannons of administrative
jurisprudence .....

In this scheme of Act, the provisions of

Section 48 are not intended to vest any right in the owner
for denotification of his land.

It primarily indicates

legislative intent of exception to the Rule of taking
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 17 of 88

possession of the land which has been acquired. Grant of
liberty

to

the

appropriate

Government

should

be

understood in its correct perspective and its substitution by
a vested right in the owner for release of the land from
acquisition

would

be

patent

misconstruction

of

the

provisions.” This very question had also arisen before us in
WP(C) 17538/2006 titled Dharamvir Singh -vs- Lt.Governor

of Delhi, decided on 20.3.2007; and in WP(C) 2972/2007
titled Satya Narain Prakash Punj -vs- Union of India decided
on 25-4-2007; and more recently in WP(C) 3795/2007 titled

Dalpat Singh -vs- Lt. Governor decided on 18-5-2007. We
have also adopted the view that the “second salvo” under
Article

226

of

the

Constitution

to

the

acquisition

proceedings through the device of denotification, should
not be encouraged or entertained.

12.

We had noted that another Division Bench had

held in Baijnath Aggarwal Dharmarth Trust Society -vs- The

Lt.Governor decided on 22.8.2006 that “the Petitioner
opted to seek denotification of the land in question by filing

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 18 of 88

an application in terms of S.48 of the Act..... clearly the
Petitioner gave up its challenge to the validity of the
Notification under challenge.” It seems to us that since this
approach had not been contested before the Division
Bench, as is palpable from the absence of any analysis of
the facets of this interesting legal nodus, our learned
Brothers intended that the conclusion be restricted to the
facts of that case.

13.

It is further contended by Mr.Rohtagi that

constitutional remedies cannot be affected or restricted or
annihilated by application of the principles of estoppel.
Reliance has been placed by him on the enunciation of law
in Prashant Ramachandra Deshpandey -vs- Maruti Balaram

Haibatti, 1995 Supp (2) SCC 539, which was affirmed in the
same matter by a larger Bench reported as P.R.Deshpande

-vs- Maruti Balaram Haibatti, AIR 1998 SC 2979. The main
question raised before the Hon'ble Supreme Court was
whether, owing to the non-compliance by the tenant of an
undertaking to vacate the demised premises, the Appeal by
Special Leave under Article 136 of the Constitution, could
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 19 of 88

be dismissed.

The Court answered in the negative,

observing that constitutional rights cannot be taken away
by legislation and much less by invoking principles of
election or estoppel.

We wish to add to this established

exposition of the law by adverting to the decision of the
Constitutional Bench comprising seven learned Judges of
the Supreme Court in the landmark precedent titled

L.Chandra Kumar -vs- Union of India, III (1997) CLT 114
(SC)=(1997) 3 SCC 261.

One of the questions that had

arisen in that batch of Appeals/Petitions inter alia was
whether the powers of the High Court under Article 226 of
the Constitution could be curtailed by statutes such as the
Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985. The Court pronounced
that the powers of judicial review over legislative action
inalienably vested in the High Courts under Article 226 and
in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution,
and were integral and essential features of the Constitution

Section

In this analysis our conclusion is that invoking
48

of

the

Land

Acquisition

Act

seeking

denotification of the acquired land does not impede or
restrain the Writ Court from deciding the matter on merits.
This is also for the reason that a decision under Section 48
would normally not be subject to judicial review, unless
principles of natural justice have patently been ignored.
Since it is trite that reasons need not be given in support of
the decision of the Government/Executive/ Administration
under Section 48 of the Act, the scope for jural intervention
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 21 of 88

would normally not go beyond an enquiry into whether
procedural norms have been adhered to.

15.

The contention of Mr.Poddar that the natural or

inexorable consequence of the Petitioner's request to the
Lt. Governor under

Section 48 for

denotification of the

acquired land is the non maintainability of the present
Writ Petition, is without merit and is rejected. Further,
we are also of the view that principles of waiver or

estoppel cannot be applied unless it is

INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 17 OF
THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT, 1894
16.

The interplay between the various provisions of

the Land Acquisition Act with which we are presently
concerned have been dealt with in minute detail in a
plethora of precedents.

The following passage from

Nandeshwar Prasad -vs- The State of U.P., [1964] 3 SCR
425 (followed one year later in Sarju Prasad Sinha -vs- The

State

of

U.P.,

AIR

1965

SC

1763)

perspicuously

encapsulates the law on the subject, holding that the State
Government ought not to have dispensed with adherence to
Section 5A in the Notification under Section 4 of the Act:
The proceedings for acquisition start with a
preliminary

notification

under

s.

4.

By

that

notification the Government notifies that land in any
locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 23 of 88

public

purpose.

On

that

notification

certain

consequences follow and authority is conferred on
an

officer

either

generally

or

specially

by

Government and on his servants and workmen to
enter upon and survey and take levels of any land in
such locality, to dig or bore into the sub-soil, to do
all other acts necessary to ascertain whether the
land is adapted for such purpose, to set out the
boundaries of the land proposed, to be taken, and so
on. Then s. 5-A provides that any person interested
in any land which has been notified in s. 4, may
within thirty days of the issue of the notification
object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in
the locality as the case may be. Every such
objection shall be made to the Collector in writing
and the Collector has to give the objector an
opportunity

of

being

heard.

After

hearing

all

objections and after making further inquiry if any,
as he thinks fit, the Collector has to submit the case
for the decision of the Government together with
the record of the proceedings held by him and the
report containing his recommendations on the
objections. The decision of the Government on the
objections is final. Then comes the notification
under

s.

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 24 of 88

that any particular land is needed for a public
purpose, a declaration shall be made to that effect
and published in the official gazette. After such a
declaration has been made under s. 6, the Collector
has to take order for acquisition of land. It is
marked out, measured and planned under s. 8 if
necessary and notice is given under s. 9 to persons
interested. The Collector then holds inquiry under s.
11 and makes an award. After the award is made
the Collector has got the power to take possession
of the land under s. 16 and the land then vests
absolutely

in

the

Government

free

from

encumbrances.
It will be clear from this scheme that
compliance

with

the

provisions

of

s.

5-A

is

necessary before a notification can be issued under
s. 6. As soon as the preliminary notification is issued
under s. 4, the officer authorised by Government
may enter upon the land to survey it and to do all
other necessary acts to ascertain whether the land
is adapted for the purpose for which it is to be
acquired,

and this

action,

if taken,

will

give

sufficient notice to those interested to object. If
objections are made the Collector will consider
those objections and make his recommendation

report

Government.

If

no

objections are made the Collector will report that no
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 25 of 88

objection has been made and the Government then
proceeds to issue a notification under s. 6. In either
case however, the Collector has got to make a
report with his recommendations on the objections
if they are filed or inform the Government that
there are no objections filed in pursuance of the
notification under s. 4 and it is thereafter that the
Government is empowered under s. 6 to issue a
notification. This, as we have said, is the usual
procedure to be followed before the notification
under s. 6 is issued. To this usual procedure there is
however an exception under s. 17, and that is why
in s. 6 we find the words "if any" in the clause "after
considering the report, if any, made under s. 5A".
When action is taken under s. 17(4), it is not
necessary to follow the procedure in s. 5-A and a
notification under s. 6 can be issued without a
report from the Collector under s. 5-A.
......
It will be seen that s. 17(1) gives power to the
Government to direct the Collector, though no
award has been

made

under s. 11, to take

possession of any waste or arable land needed for
public purpose and such land thereupon vests
absolutely

s. 16 after the award under s. 11 are accelerated
and can take place fifteen days after the publication
of the notice under s. 9. Then comes s. 17(4) which
provides that in case of any land to which the
provisions

are

applicable,

the

Government may direct that the provisions of s. 5-A

will

that it is not necessary

even where the Government makes a direction
under s. 17(1) that it should also make a direction
under s. 17(4). If the Government makes a direction
only under s. 17(1) the procedure under s. 5-A
would still have to

be

followed

notification under s. 6 is issued, though after that
procedure has been followed and

also makes a declaration under s. 17(4) that it

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 27 of 88

order under s. 17(4) is also passed; but in law it is
not necessary that this should be so.

17.

Thirty five years later, their Lordships had

garnered

support from Nandeshwar Prasad which was

applied by them in Union of India -vs- Mukesh Hans,
(2004) 8 SCC 14, decided on 17-9-2004 without reference
to its earlier decision titled Krishan Lal Arneja (infra). It
was emphasised that there must be an application of mind
by the appropriate Government to the facts of the case with
special reference to the necessity of dispensing with the
invaluable opportunity of showing cause and being heard
against the acquisition consequent upon a Section 4
Notification.

It should be noted that prior to the

amendment of the statute in 1923, since the right to file
Objections to the proposed expropriation of land was not in
existence, there was no reason whatsoever to refer to the
dismissal or disposal of Section 5A Objections.

It is

advisable, if not essential, to keep the annals of a statute in
sight while interpreting its sundry sections. Their Lordships
had upheld the decision of the Division Bench of this Court
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 28 of 88

and had reiterated the law in these words:
29. A careful perusal of the above Section
shows

that

Sub-section

(1)

of

Section

17

contemplates taking possession of the land in the
case of an urgency without making an award but
after the publication of Section 9(1) notice and after
the expiration of 15 days of publication of Section 9
(1)

notice.

Therefore,

it

is

seen

that

if

the

appropriate Government decides that there is an
urgency to invoke Section 17(1) in the normal
course Section 4(1) notice will have to be published,
Section 6 declaration will have to be made and after
completing

the

procedure

contemplated

under

Sections 7 and 8, Section 9(1) notice will have to be
given and on expiration of 15 days from the date of
such notice the authorities can take possession of
the land even before passing of an award.
30.

Sub-section

(2)

of

Section

17

contemplates a different type of urgency inasmuch
as it should be an unforeseen emergency. Under
this Section if the appropriate Government is
satisfied that there is such unforeseen emergency
the authorities can take possession of the land even
without

waiting

for

the

fifteen

day

period

contemplated under Section 9(1). Therefore, in
cases, where the Government is satisfied that there
is an unforeseen emergency, it will have to in the
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 29 of 88

normal course, issue a Section 4(1) notification,
hold

Section

5-A

inquiry,

make

Section

6

declaration, and issue Section 9(1) notice and
possession can be taken immediately thereafter
without waiting for the period of 15 days prescribed
under Section 9(1) of the Act
31. Section 17 (4) as noticed above, provides
that in cases where the appropriate Government
has come to the conclusion that there exists an
urgency or unforeseen emergency as required
under Sub-section (1) or (2) of Section 17 it may
direct that the provisions of Section 5-A shall not
apply and if such direction is given then Section 5-A
inquiry can be dispensed with and a declaration
may be made under Section 6 on publication of
Section 4(1) notification and possession can be
taken.
32. A careful perusal of this provision which is
an exception to the normal mode of acquisition
contemplated under the Act shows that mere
existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency
though

is

a condition

precedent

for invoking

Section 17(4), that by itself is not sufficient to
direct the dispensation of the Section 5-A inquiry. It
requires an opinion to be formed by the government
concerned that along with the existence of such
urgency or unforeseen emergency there is also a
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 30 of 88

need for dispensing with Section 5A inquiry which
indicates

that

the

Legislature

intended

the

appropriate government to apply its mind before
dispensing with Section 5A inquiry. It also indicates
that mere existence of an urgency under Section 17
(1) or unforeseen emergency under Section 17 (2)
would not by itself be sufficient for dispensing with
Section 5-A inquiry. If that was not the intention of
the Legislature then the latter part of Sub-section
(4) of Section 17 would not have been necessary
and the Legislature in Section 17 (1) and (2) itself
could have incorporated that in such situation of
existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency
automatically Section 5-A inquiry will be dispensed
with. But then that is not the
Section

which

in

our

language of the

opinion

requires

the

appropriate Government to further consider the
need for dispensing with Section 5-A inquiry in
spite of the existence of unforeseen emergency.
This understanding of ours as to the requirement of
an

application

of

mind

by

the

appropriate

Government while dispensing with Section 5-A
inquiry does not mean that in each and every case
when there is an urgency contemplated under
Section

17

(1)

and

unforeseen

emergency

contemplated under Section 17 (2) exists that by
itself would not contain the need for dispensing

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 31 of 88

with Section 5-A inquiry. It is possible in a given
case

the

urgency

noticed

by

the

appropriate

Government under Section 17(1) or the unforeseen
emergency under Section 17(2) itself may be of
such degree that it could require the appropriate
Government on that very basis to dispense with the
inquiry under Section 5 A but then there is a need
for

application

of

mind

by

the

appropriate

Government that such an urgency for dispensation
of the Section 5-A inquiry is inherent in the two
types of urgencies contemplated under Section 17
(1) and (2) of the Act.
(underlining added)
33. An argument was sought to be advanced
on

behalf

of

the

appellants

that

once

the

appropriate Government comes to the conclusion
that there is an urgency or unforeseen emergency
under Section 17(1) and (2) the dispensation of
enquiry under Section 5-A becomes automatic and
the same can be done by a composite order
meaning thereby that there is no need for the
appropriate Government to separately apply its
mind for any further emergency for dispensation
with an inquiry under Section 5-A. We are unable to
agree with the above argument because sub-section
(4)

of

Section

17

itself

indicates

that

the

"government may direct that the provisions of
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 32 of 88

Section 5-A shall not apply" (emphasis supplied)
which makes it clear that not in every case where
the appropriate Government has come to the
conclusion that there is urgency and under subsection (1) or unforeseen emergency under subsection (2) of Section 17, the Government will ipso
facto have to direct the dispensation of the inquiry.
For this we do find support from a judgment of this
Court in the case of Nandeshwar Prasad

v. The

State of U.P., (1964) 3 SCR 425:AIR 1964 SC 1217
wherein considering the language of Section 17 of
the Act which was then referable to waste or arable
land and the U.P. Amendment to the said section,
this Court held thus :
"It will be seen that Section 17(1) gives
power to the Government to direct the Collector,
though no award has been made under Section
11, to take possession of any waste or arable land
needed

for

public

purpose

and

such

land

thereupon vests absolutely in the Government
free from all encumbrances. If action is taken
under

Section

17(1), taking

possession

and

vesting which are provided in Section 16 after
the award under Section 11 are accelerated and
can take place fifteen days after the publication
of the notice under Section 9. Then comes
Section 17(4) which provides that in case of any

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 33 of 88

land to which the provisions of sub-section (1)
are applicable, the Government may direct that
the provisions of Section 5A shall not apply and if
it does so direct, a declaration may be made
under Section 6 in respect of the land at any time
after the publication of the notification under
Section 4(1). It will be seen that it is not
necessary even where the Government makes a
direction under Section 17(1) that it should also
make a direction under Section 17(4). If the
Government

makes

a

direction

only

under

Section 17(1) the procedure under Section 5-A
would

still

have

to

be

followed

before

a

notification under Section 6 is issued, though
after that procedure has been followed and a
notification

under

Section

6

is

issued

the

Collector gets the power to take possession of
the land after the notice under Section 9 without
waiting for the award and on such taking
possession the land shall vest absolutely in
Government free from all encumbrances. It is
only

when

the

Government

also

makes

a

declaration under Section 17(4) that it becomes
unnecessary to take action under Section 5A and
make a report thereunder. It may be that
generally where an order is made under Section
17(1), an order under Section 17(4) is also

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 34 of 88

passed; but in law it is not necessary that this
should be so. It will also be seen that under the
Land Acquisition Act an order under Section 17
(1) or Section 17(4) can only be passed with
respect to waste or arable land and it cannot be
passed with respect to land which is not waste or
arable and on which buildings stand." (emphasis
supplied)
34. A careful reading of the above judgment
shows that this Court in the said Nandeshwar
Prasad case has also held that there should be an
application of mind to the facts of the case with
special reference to this concession of Section 5-A
inquiry under the Act.
35. At this stage, it is relevant to notice that
the

limited

right

given

to

an

owner/person

interested under Section 5-A of the Act to object to
the

acquisition

proceedings

is

not

an

empty

formality and is a substantive right, which can be
taken away for good and valid reason and within the
limitations prescribed under Section 17(4) of the
Act. The object and importance of 5A inquiry was
noticed by this Court in the case of Munshi Singh
and Ors. v. Union of India, (1973) 2 SCC 337,
wherein this Court held thus:"7. Section 5-A embodies a very just and

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 35 of 88

wholesome principle that a person whose property
is being or is intended to be acquired should have
a proper and reasonable opportunity of persuading
the authorities concerned that acquisition of the
property belonging to that person should not be
made. ...The legislature has, therefore, made
complete provisions for the persons interested to
file objections against the proposed acquisition
and for the disposal of their objections . It is only
in cases of urgency that special powers have been
conferred

on

the

appropriate

Government

to

dispense with the provisions of Section 5-A."
36. It is clear from the above observation of
this Court that right of representation and hearing
contemplated under Section 5-A of the Act is a very
valuable right of a person whose property is sought
to be acquired and he should have appropriate and
reasonable

opportunity

of

persuading

the

authorities concerned that the acquisition of the
property belonging to that person should not be
made. Therefore, in our opinion, if the appropriate
Government decides to take away this minimal right
then its decision to do so must be based on
materials on record to support the same and
bearing in mind the object of Section 5 A.
37. We will now refer to the facts of the
present

case.

WP(C) 1289/1990

We

make

it

clear

that

this

page 36 of 88

consideration of facts by us is not for the purpose of
finding out whether the stated public purpose is in
reality a public purpose or not, nor is it for the
purpose of finding out whether there was an
urgency as contemplated under Section 17(1) of the
Act, but limited to the question of whether there
was any material available before the Lt. Governor
pursuant to whose order Section 4(1) notification
stated that Section 5-A inquiry is dispensed with.
Since formation of an opinion and application of
mind cannot be assessed except by looking into the
proceedings which culminated in the impugned
order, we intend considering only such facts as are
necessary for this limited purpose. The facts of the
present case as found from the records show that
the Anjuman-Saire-e-Gul-Faroshan the committee
that organises this festival was using some land in
village Mehrauli for conducting its concluding
ceremony. It is for this purpose it sought 4000 sq.
yards of land in Khasra Nos. 1151/3 (new) and 1665
(old) of the said village. It is also found from the
record that ever since the revival of the festival the
concluding programme was being continued on a
piece of land situated in the said Khasra of Mehrauli
village which is now sought to be acquired along
with certain other lands. There is no material on
record to show that either the said festival has been

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 37 of 88

discontinued for want of land or the owners of the
land where the festival has its concluding ceremony
are preventing the utilisation of that land for the
said purpose. We have also noticed hereinabove
that an earlier attempt to acquire 40 bighas of the
land for the very same purpose was allowed to be
lapsed by the authorities concerned by efflux of
time which was also a relevant factor to be taken
note of by the Lt. Governor when he took the
decision to dispense with the Section 5-A inquiry
but the same was not placed before him. These facts
coupled with the findings of the High Court that in
almost all the notings in the file there is no
reference to the need for invoking Section 17(4),
indicates that the Lt. Governor was not apprised of
all the necessary and relevant facts before he took
the decision in question. Therefore, in our opinion,
the findings of the High Court that the decision of
the Lt. Governor to dispense with the Section 5-A
inquiry suffered from the vice of non-application of
mind has to be upheld. For the reasons stated
above, these appeals fail and are dismissed.”

18.

We need to clarify that the present Notification

as well as the Mukesh Hans Notification specifically state
that the Lt. Governor is of the opinion that provisions of
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 38 of 88

sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the Act are applicable
to the acquisition and that the provisions of Section
5A of

Notification on the grounds that the rigours of Section

that case. Their Lordships finding was to the effect that
the Lt. Governor had not properly exercised his mind on
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 39 of 88

the vexed question of whether the perceived urgency
justified the forfeiture of Section 5A rights.

19.

A study of Krishan Lal Arneja, decided on 28-

4-2004, i.e. prior to Mukesh Hans will disclose that their
Lordships have not always drawn a distinction between the
sundry sub-sections of Section 17 and on the contrary have
treated Section 17 of the Act as a compendium for
regulating

the emergency powers of acquisition of land.

In Krishan Lal Arneja also, the challenge was to the
existence of sufficient material justifying resorting to
Sections 17(1) and (4) in the Notification under Section 4
(1) read with Section 17(1). It will bear repetition that the
first sub-section permits dispossession after fifteen days
where the appropriate Government is subjectively satisfied
of the existence of urgency. The second sub-section spells
out, in minute details as it necessarily should, the
circumstances in which the appropriate Government can
take possession of acquired lands merely after forty eight
hours (virtually instantaneous for all practical purposes).

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 40 of 88

Neither of these provisions make any mention of Section
5A of the Act. Their Lordships observed as follows:
“17. Section 17 confers extraordinary powers
on the authorities under which it can dispense with
the normal procedure laid down under Section 5A
of the Act in exceptional case of urgency.

Such

powers cannot be lightly resorted to except in case
of real urgency enabling the Government to take
immediate possession of the land proposed to be
acquired for public purpose. A public purpose,
however laudable it may be by itself is not
sufficient to take aid of Section 17 to

use this

extraordinary power as use of such power deprives
a land owner of his right in relation to immovable
property to file objections

for the proposed

acquisition and it also dispenses with the inquiry
under Section 5A of the Act. The Authority must
have

subjective

satisfaction

of

the

need

for

invoking urgency clause under Section 17 keeping
in mind the nature of the public purpose, real
urgency that the situation demands and the time
factor i.e. whether

taking possession of the

property can wait for a minimum period within
which the objections could be received from the
land owners and the inquiry under section 5A of the
Act could be completed. In other words, if power
under section 17 is not exercised, the very purpose
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 41 of 88

for which the land is being acquired urgently would
be

frustrated or defeated.

Normally urgency to

acquire a land for public purpose does not arise
suddenly or overnight but sometimes such urgency
may

arise

unexpectedly,

exceptionally

or

extraordinarily depending on situations such as due
to earthquake, flood or some specific time bound
project where the

delay is likely to render the

purpose nugatory or infructuous.

A citizen's

property can be acquired in accordance with law
but in the absence of real and genuine urgency, it
may not be appropriate to deprive an aggrieved
party of a fair and just opportunity of putting forth
its objections for due consideration of the acquiring
authority, while applying the urgency clause, the
State should

indeed act with due care and

responsibility. Invoking urgency clause cannot be a
substitute or support for the laxity, lethargy or lack
of care on the part of the State Administration.”

20.

These extracts would be directly applicable if

the argument that Orders specifically mentioning Section
17(4) are essential, had been raised in the earlier cases.
The frequently quoted opinion of the House of Lords in

Quinn v. Leathem, 1901 AC 495 : (1900-3) All ER Rep 1 is
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 42 of 88

that of Lord Halsbury, namely, that “every judgment must
be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or
assumed to be proved .... The other is that a case is only an
authority for what is actually decides”. These passages
have been reiterated in Goodyear India Ltd. -vs- State of

Haryana, (1990) 2 SCC 71 and State of Orissa v. Sudhansu
Sekhar Misra, AIR 1968 SC 647.
Court explicitly

In the latter case, the

opined that “a decision on a question

which has not been argued cannot be treated as a
precedent”. Their Lordships, in turn, referred back to the
previous opinion in Rajput Ruda Meha -vs- State of

Gujarat, 1980 SC 1707 in which it had similarly been
stated that where an issue has neither been raised nor
argued any decision by the Court, even after 'pondering
over the issue in depth', would not be a binding precedent.
Similar observations have been made by the Constitution
Bench in Padma Sundara Rao -vs- State of T.N., 2002(3)
SCC 533, as is evident from the following extract:
9.

Courts should not place reliance on decisions

without discussing as to how the factual situation
fits

in with the fact situation of the decision on

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 43 of 88

which reliance is placed.

There is always peril in

treating the words of a speech or judgment as
though they are words in a legislative enactment,
and it is to be remembered that judicial utterances
are made in the setting of the facts of a particular
case, said Lord

Morris

in Herrington v. British

Railways Board, (1972) 2 WLR 537. Circumstantial
flexibility, one additional or different fact may make
a world of difference between conclusions in two
cases.

21.

We have carefully perused the judgments in

Nandeshwar Prasad, Krishan Lal Arneja and Mukesh
Hans in order to ascertain whether it had been argued
that a separate decision must be taken under Sections 17
(1) or (2) on the one hand, and Section 17(4) on the other;
or that even if Section 17(1) or 17(2) are resorted to,
Objections under Section 5A must be invited and decided
before an acquisition can be completed.

Our reading is

that these contentions had not been raised. Therefore, the
dictum in Quinn assumes great significance.
nonetheless give

We will

due deference to all the observations

made by the Apex Court, even though we find from the
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 44 of 88

pleadings before us, that grounds predicated on the above
arguments have not been articulated in the petitions.
Indubitably, these are legal contentions and we would be
loathe to ignore them solely for the reason that they have
not been pleaded. It is also obvious that these arguments
have been raised before us de hors the pleadings because
of the views ventilated

in Mukesh Hans.

Prior to this

pronouncement it has not been contended that if Section
17(4) of the Act has not been mentioned in the Notification
under Section 4, the procedure set down in Section 5A has
to be complied with.

22.

The scheme of the Act has already been

reflected upon by the Apex Court in the precedents dealt
with above. Three recent decisions rendered by Division
Benches of this Court, applying the ratio in Nandeshwar

Prasad and Mukesh Hans have however been appealed
against and the Apex Court has ordered that - “there shall
be interim stay of the High Court's order”.

contention of learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner
that we must nevertheless follow the line of reasoning in
these three cases.

Had an interim stay of the orders

passed by the Division Bench

in those three cases not

been granted by the Apex Court we could have either
followed those judgments or recommended the convening
of a Full Bench to reconsider the legal nodus. Be that as it
may, it is entirely unarguable that where a Supreme Court
Judgment is available it must be followed in its true tenor
regardless of the pronouncement of Benches of the High
Court.

23.

We have had the advantage of listening to the

extremely erudite arguments of several learned Counsel
for the parties. We have endeavoured a meticulous study of
the Act

which is over a century in vintage, wearing the

vestiges of colonial rule. Broadly stated, the law of land
acquisition in India was predicated on the principle of
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 46 of 88

“eminent domain” or “condemnation” or “expropriation”, a
concept which could conveniently be employed when landowners were subjects and not citizens.
Dictionary, Fifth Edition explains

Black's Law

“eminent domain” as

“the power to take private property for public use by the
state, municipalities, and private persons or corporations
authorized to exercise functions of public character. ....
eminent domain is the highest and most exact idea of
property remaining in the government, or in the aggregate
body of the people in their sovereign capacity.

It gives a

right to resume the possession of the property in the
manner directed by the constitution and the laws of the
state, whenever the public interest requires it.”

Like

Article 300A of our Constitution the American Constitution
requires that just compensation must be given to the
owners of the property which is taken away. Originally,
ownership of property was assumed to be a fundamental
right in our country, but Article 19(1)(f) has been replaced
by Article 300A which proclaims that no person shall be
deprived of his property save by authority of law.
Reverting back, however, to the pre-independence era, in
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 47 of 88

1894 when the Land Acquisition Act came into force, the
sovereign possessed untrammeled powers to expropriate
the lands of its subjects.

What was required of the

Government was merely making public its intention to
acquire land (Section 4) which empowered it to enter upon
the land for its mapping etc., in the course of which, if
damage was caused compensation would have to be
calculated and given (Section 5). Section 5A, which enables
the filing of Objections, was absent. The Government could
then, at its own sweet will and convenience, issue a
declaration that it needed the land for public purposes.
The Government would thereupon direct the Collector to
obtain necessary orders for the acquisition of the land
(Section

7)

and

the

Collector

would

complete

the

remaining and requisite measurements (Section 8). Upto
this

stage

the

individual

owner

did

not

receive

personalized attention, but this would obviously become
advisable if not essential as soon as possession of his land
was to be taken over and compensation for it was to be
calculated and tendered. The original scheme of the Act,
however, did not repose any say or right to remonstrate
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 48 of 88

viz-a-viz acquisition proceedings on the owner of the land,
as would be clear from a perusal of the Judgment of the
Privy Council in Ezra -vs- Secretary of State for India,
(1905) XXXII I.L.R. Calc. 605, in the context of Sections 9
and 40 of the Act:
Now, upon the face of this enactment, there is
no provision requiring or implying the presence or
the knowledge of the owner of the land. The theory
of

the

section

would

seem

to

be

that

the

Government, through its officer, is to direct its
attention to public interests, and it is significant
that neither promoter, on the one hand, nor
possible objector, on the other, is mentioned in the
section.

This does not imply that the officer is to

disregard the existence of adverse rights, and the
word “needed” implies this.

But the standpoint is

that of public interest, and the Government is given
control of the enquiry, for this is all that is meant by
its

being empowered to appoint time and place;

and all this derives the more significance from the
fact that the Act, both in this stage

and in the

subsequent enquiry into value, takes the initiative
out of the hands of the Company and puts it in the
hands of the Government.
....

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 49 of 88

That the nature of the first enquiry is in no
sense litigious, and that the owners of the land are
purposely ignored, as parties, is strongly shown by
the anxious provisions made as regards the second
enquiry for which (section 9) “public notice” is to
be given calling for claims for compensation and
requiring all persons interested in the land to
appear at a time and place specified.

24.

Section 9 of the Act has not undergone any

significant change over the last century. It bestows on any
person interested in the land the opportunity of personal
appearance,

however,

but

only

with

regard

to

the

computation of compensation. The said sub-section (3)
thereof obliges the Collector to serve notice on the occupier
also, since the Government can assume possession of the
acquired

land.

Section

11

postulates

the

publication of an Award, which would become final by
virtue of Section 12, whereupon the Collector became
empowered to take possession of the land with the result
that it would vest absolutely in the Government free from
all encumbrances (Section 16).

WP(C) 1289/1990

Obviously this procedure

the person interested in the land or the occupier, would
not normally be dispossessed.

by

amendments carried out by Act 68 of 1984, enjoining that
no Declaration under Section 6 shall be made after

the

expiry of one year from the Notification under Section 4.
However, situations may well arise which would warrant
and necessitate the Government to take possession of land
forthwith. This is what Section 17 of the Act catered for,
from the very inception. The first sub-section enables the
Collector, even before an Award has been made, on the
expiration of fifteen days from the publication of a Section
9 notice, to assume possession of any land. In even more
pressing circumstances, dealt with in detail in the second
sub-section of Section 17, the Collector retains the power
to take possession of the land after the expiry of just two
days, without the owner/occupier of the land having any
right

to remonstrate against this

extraordinary

action.

Such a situation would appear abhorrent to us today, but
in a colonial era this would not have been looked askance

page 51 of 88

at. Ironically, the decision in Ezra acted as a catalyst for
bringing about widespread and welcome amendments to
the Act in 1923.

25.

We think it advantageous to reproduce Act

XXXVIII of 1923 not only for facility of reference but also so
that the sequence and impact of the alterations are
comprehensively appreciated. Its Statement of Objects &
Reasons took note of the fact that the Act “does not provide
that persons having an interest in land which it proposed to
acquire shall have the right of objecting to such acquisition
and that the Government is not bound to enquire into and
consider any objections that may reach them. The object of
the Bill is to provide that a Local Government shall not
declare, under s.6 of the Act, that any land is needed for a
public purpose unless time has been allowed after the
notification under s.4 for persons interested in the land to
put in objections and for such objections to be considered
by the Local Government”.

26.

As we have already noted that the draconian

nature of the Act came to the fore in Ezra, resulting in an
infusion of humaneness into the statute in the form of Act
XXXVIII of 1923, the most far-reaching feature of which
is Section 3, which now constitutes Section 5A of the Act.
It

Hence,

dispensation of Section 5-A was made available in terms of
Section 17(4) which was simultaneously introduced by Act
XXXVIII of 1923. If the annals of legislation are ignored,
the interpretation of these provisions may become an
anachronism.

27.

In our considered opinion Section 17(4) is not a

fasciculous of the Act, a sub-pandect or a self-contained
code having its own realm of operation. Its sole purpose is
to clarify that Sections 17(1) and (2) continue to operate as
they did prior to 1923. If Section 17(4) is to function in its
own field, the factual matrix attending thereto should be
spelt out on the lines delineated in its preceding subsections (1) and (2). On a careful perusal of the provision

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 57 of 88

of Section 17(4) it will be evident that it contemplates the
formation of an opinion by the Government as to existence
of the fact situation postulated either by Section 17(1),
thereby enabling possession to be taken over after fifteen
days, or under Section 17(2) empowering the taking of
similar action after only two days. Originally, neither of
these provisions had Section 5A within their respective
sights. Sections 17(1) and (2) predated the introduction of

We have not come across a case

If this is the

practical reality, we are unable to conceive of a situation of
such urgency as would justify or necessitate the formation
of an opinion in respect of a decision to be taken other than
in the factual matrix disclosed in sub-section (1) or subsection (2) of Section 17 (i.e. signing and simultaneously
executing a decision) reference to which would not have
been necessary if there were other and even more extreme
situations (in practical terms unthinkable to us), envisaged
by sub-section (4) alone.
WP(C) 1289/1990

This is why we have said that

Objections, which are normally numerous, can be decided
in two days or even in fifteen days. Section 17(4) merely
clarifies that the original intendment of the unamended
Section 17 of the Act

would continue even after the

Furthermore, it would be futile to consider

interested in the land, as the case may be; as inane and
inconsequential as shutting the stable after the horse has
bolted out of it.

It will be fatal to ignore the fact that

Section 5A permits and enables any person interested in
any land which has been notified under Section 4 to file

under

Section 17(2), the Act should have

clarified that the period of fifteen days and two days
mentioned in sub-Section (1) and (2) of Section 17 would
commence after the period of thirty days prescribed in
Section 5A. We have duly noted the use of “may” in the
provision, denoting the availability of a choice, which
militates against our understanding that

as soon as the

Government forms an opinion that conditions covered by
Section 17(1) or (2) are current, dispensation of Section 5A
inexorably and automatically follow. However instances are
legion where “may” has been freely interchanged or used
synonymously with “shall” or even “must”, especially where
the context of the statute so dictates.

In our opinion

Section 17(4) is clarificatory in nature, calculated to
caution interested persons that objections would not be
entertained both to the acquisition of the land and to the
consequent

dispossession

of

the

owner/occupant.

Otherwise, Sections 17(1) and (2) would be rendered
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 60 of 88

meaningless, otiose and ineffectual. In other words, the
Government has been explicitly reminded in Section 17(4)
that whenever it resorts either to Section 17(1) or Section
17(2) the consequence is the

annihilation of the citizens

rights enshrined in Section 5A and that therefore it must
take due care and caution in doing so; and that ordinarily
this procedure is to be eschewed.

29.

In Om Prakash -vs- State of U.P., 1998 (6) SCC 1

their Lordships had pithily observed that they “could have
appreciated the stand of the State authorities for invoking
the urgency clause under Section 17(4) of the Act on the
ground that when about 500 acres of land were to be
acquired for further planned development of Sector 43 and
other sectors of NOIDA, as mentioned in the impugned
notification, hearing of objectors who might have filed
written objections when there are a large number of
occupants of these lands and who possess about 438 plots
of land under acquisition, would have indefinitely delayed
the acquisition proceedings and years would have rolled by
before Section 6 notification could have been issued. Under
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 61 of 88

these circumstances, the entire further development of the
area would have, on the peculiar facts and circumstances
of these cases, come to a grinding halt.

Such a stand

would have justified the subjective satisfaction of the
authorities for invoking Section17(4) of the Act.

Such

satisfaction then could not have been gone behind by a
court of law. But unfortunately for the respondents, such
was not their case nor did they even

whisper in these
in

view

while

The Court was

concerned only with the applicability of Section 17(4), and
accordingly they had only to sift through the relevant
material available with the appropriate Government to
enable it to arrive at its subjective satisfaction about
dispensing with a Section 5A inquiry.

30.

It has been contended that Section 17(1) and for

this reason Section 17(2) also, refer to publication of

a

notice under Section 9 of the Act, and hence Section 5A
has to be complied with.

However, it should not be

overlooked that in the original scheme of the statute
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 62 of 88

Section 9 operated sans Section 5A and the land-owner had
the right to be heard only in the context of the nature of his
interest in the land and the determination of compensation
for such

interests.

Whenever Section 17 has been

correctly invoked the inexorable consequence is that the
acquisition cannot be objected to (since Section 5A stands
dispensed with) resulting in the enquiry being restricted to
quantum of compensation receivable by the persons
interested in the land prior to the Section 6 Declaration.
This position would endure even post the invocation of
Section 17 of the Act.

An award would then be published

in accordance with law and procedure. No anomalous or
contradictory situation is reached if

our analysis

is

accepted.

31.

The conclusion that we have arrived at as a

result of the above discussion is that Section 17, as a
composite whole, is a pandect within the Land Acquisition
Act, in much the same manner in which Section 25B of the
Delhi Rent Control Act has been viewed by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. Section 17 deals with the entire spectrum
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 63 of 88

of emergencies which call for urgent action leading to
expropriation of private property. It empowers the State to
take possession of lands required for public purposes in two
categories of contingencies – (a) in urgent circumstances as
adumbrated in the first sub-section enabling dispossession
after fifteen days and (b) situations specifically spelt out in
the

second

sub-section

empowering

dispossession, i.e. after two days.

immediate

These provisions were

available to the State from the very inception of the Act,
and had the result of permitting the Government to take
possession along with the publishing of a notification under
Section 4, leaving the matter of computing and tendering
compensation to follow.

The introduction in 1923 of the

right to file Objections under Section 5A within thirty days
of

the

Section

4

Notification

required

necessary

clarification that where circumstances obtain necessitating
urgent action, it could be taken. This was clarified by the
simultaneous inclusion of Section 17(4), which notably does
not have its own field of operation, distinct of sub-sections
(1) and (2). Therefore, once the Government is subjectively
satisfied that circumstances chronicled in the first two subWP(C) 1289/1990

page 64 of 88

sections exist, the effect is the suspension of the right to
file Objections under Section 5A.

In the present case

Section 17(1) has been resorted to, it would not be open to
the Authorities to take possession of the property till the
expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the
Notification. We have come to this conclusion respectfully
and

humbly

mindful

of

by

Lordships in Nandeshwar Prasad, Krishan Lal Arneja
and Mukesh Hans, in which cases the argument that
separate orders under Section 17(4) are essential, were not
raised.
VALIDITY OF DECISION OF LT. GOVERNOR
INVOKING SECTION 17 OF THE ACT.
32.

Mr. Rohtagi has argued that mere existence of

conditions of urgency or emergency, as may be postulated
under sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 17 would not
justify dispensing with the valuable rights preserved in
Section 5A of the Act. The contention that this can properly
be achieved only by specifically resorting to Section 17(4)
of the Act has already been rejected by us. However,
regardless of which of these sub-sections have been
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 65 of 88

invoked, there cannot possibly be any debate on the
question that the virtual attainder of Section 5A rights
must be predicated on sufficient material made available to
the Lt. Governor in order to enable him to arrive at an
informed and well-considered decision.

Even though the

subjective satisfaction is that of the Lt. Governor (and not
of the Court), for his decision to pass muster of judicial
review, it is essential that these two factors should be
satisfied. Even though Section 17 had not been invoked in

Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. -vs- Darius Shapur Chenai,
(2005) 7 SCC 627 the observations made in the context of
Sections 4, 5A and 6 are apposite, namely, that while

which

Lordships have observed that given the expropriatory
nature of land acquisition, Section 5A assumes almost akin
to fundamental rights under our Constitution.

these rights are forfeited by by-passing and circumventing

Government or appropriate Authority.

33.

It is appropriate to give a brief account of the

annals of the acquisition of the present property. On 13-111959 a Notification under Section 4 for the 'Planned
Development of Delhi' and a Declaration under Section 6
on 11-1-1969 had been issued.

Consequent upon the

amendments carried out to the Act

in 1984, these

proceedings lapsed in September, 1986. The second
Notification

under Section 4 read with Section 17(1),

dispensing with Section 5A, was issued on 19-2-1990
purportedly for public purpose, namely for “Planned
Development of Delhi, i.e. Shopping Centre and widening
of Mehrauli Road.” This was followed by the Declaration
dated 25-5-1990

under Section 6.

The present writ

was filed on 24-4-1990. Interim Orders dated 8-6-1990

the subject Notification is altogether different to Aflatoon
since it is actually for the creation of a Shopping Centre
and for widening of Aurobindo Marg. In this light, no useful
purpose or advantage can be derived from the 1959
Notification. The subject acquisition must therefore stand
on its own feet, the justification for resorting to Section 17
of the Act immediately assumes almost unsatisfiable
onerousness. There is nothing on record to indicate that
such a calamitous situation had come about that even a

party would have to be heard.

35.

We now proceed to succinctly reflect upon

whether the assailed acquisition is founded on public
interest. In this regard the Restatement of the law is
available in the perspicuous precedent titled Daulat Singh

Surana -vs- First Land Acquisition Collector, AIR 2007 SC
471 : VIII (2006) SLT 277.

Pubic interest is always the

foremost and fundamental factor whenever land is to be
acquired. Speaking for the Apex Court his Lordship Dalveer
Bhandari opined -73. Public purpose cannot and should
precisely
limited as

not

be

defined and its scope and ambit

be

far

public purpose is

as

acquisition of land for the

concerned.

Public purpose is

not static. It also changes with the passage of time,
need and requirements of the community. Broadly
speaking,

public

purpose

means

the

general

interests of the community as opposed to the
interest of an individual.
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 70 of 88

74. The

power of compulsory acquisition as

described by the

term 'eminent domain' can be

exercised only in the interest and for the welfare
of the people. The concept of public purpose
should

include

the

matters,

such

as,

safety,

security, health, welfare and prosperity of the
community or public at large.
75. The concept of 'eminent domain' is an essential
attribute of every State. This concept is based on
the fundamental principle that the interest and
claim of the whole community is always superior
to the interest of an individual.
Mr. Rohtagi had conceded that road widening as well as
construction of a Local Shopping Centre would constitute
public purpose, and hence brevity is called for at our end
on this aspect of the case. The gravamen of Mr. Rohtagi's
argument was that in the factual matrix surrounding the
present case these were only the ostensible reasons
ascribed to the acquisition, and that with the passage of
several decades both needs stood satiated.

Therefore, the

short-circuiting of Section 5A was imperative for the
Respondents since otherwise, had the Petitioner been
allowed to avail the opportunity to remonstrate against the

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 71 of 88

expropriation by filing Objections under Section 5A, these
questions would have to be addressed and answered by the
Respondents. The argument is that the case manifests
malice in law in contradistinction to personal malice or
mala fides.

36.
Judgments

We, therefore, need not discuss the series of
referred

to

by

learned

counsel

for

the

Respondents on the question of what constitutes public
purpose.

In

Aflatoon

the

terminology,

“Planned

Development of Delhi” was held to be a valid public
purpose and it is obvious that the ubiquitous use of this
phrase in almost all subsequent acquisitions in Delhi has its
own source to this decision.

Learned counsel for the

Respondents have drawn our attention to P. Narayanappa

Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti, Muzaffarnagar

(U.P.) -vs- Ratan Prakash Mangal, (1988) 3 SCC 225
requires to be dealt with in some detail, because of factual
similarities. A Notification dated May 20, 1982 was issued
under Section 4(1) read with Section 17(4) of the Act and
followed by the

Declaration dated May 21, 1982 under

Section 6 of the Act. The Notification under Section 4(1)
was quashed by the High Court insofar it invoked Section
17(4) and thereby dispensed with any inquiry under
Section 5A, whilst the Declaration under Section 6 was
quashed as a whole.

Prior thereto, a Notification dated

20-3-1975 was issued under Section 4(1) for acquiring
nearly 80 acres of land for the public purpose of
construction of a market yard.

After five months, vide a

superseding Notification the area was reduced to 60 acres.
Yet another Notification was issued so as to include the
plot in question which had been excluded when the
acreage had decreased.

The main plank of the attack of

the land owners was that there was no urgency justifying
the exclusion of the inquiry contemplated by Section 5A of
the Act.

The challenge was upheld upto the Hon'ble

WP(C) 1289/1990

page 73 of 88

Supreme Court; the Declaration under Section 6 was
quashed.

However, the Apex Court did not agree that the

Notification under Section 4(1) should have been quashed
in its entirety.

Possession of the land

was restored to

At the culmination of the Section 5A

proceedings the Report recommended the exemption from
acquisition of the plot in question. The Government,
however, decided not to act upon the Report. By that time,
however, three years had elapsed from the date of the
publication of the Notification under Section 4(1). Their
Lordships observed that “the submission that Section 17(4)
of the Act has been erroneously invoked in the fresh
notification under Section 4(1) dated May 20, 1982 also
and that inquiry under Section 5A had again to be made
before issuing this notification, suffice it to point out that
once an inquiry under the said section had already been
made and the parties had been given full opportunity to
substantiate their case in the said inquiry and the State
Government was not inclined to agree with the report of
the Land Acquisition Officer submitted in pursuance of that
inquiry it would have been a futile exercise to repeat the
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 74 of 88

whole performance again.

After the issue of the earlier

Notification dated October 26, 1978 period of nearly 3 ½
years had expired when the fresh Notification dated May
20, 1982 under Section 4(1) was issued and apparently the
necessity to acquire Plot No.289 during this period became
more acute due to this delay”. Their Lordships found that
there was sufficient justification for invoking the provisions
of Section 17(4) of the Act and dispensing with a further
inquiry under Section 5A of the Act. However, as we have
already

noted

above

it

is

impermissible

for

the

Respondents to rely on the earlier Notification in the facts
of the present case.

38.

In Krishan Lal Arneja fourteen properties

were notified for acquisition on 6.3.1987 under the
provisions of Section 4 and 17(1) & (4) of the Act, all of
which had been requisitioned for several years/decades
under the Defence of India Rules. Since the parent statute
viz Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property
Act, 1952 was to lapse on 10.3.1987 the Notification was
issued four days prior to that event. Paragraph 16 of the
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 75 of 88

Judgment has been reproduced above and may

be

adverted to once again in order to appreciate the opinion of
their Lordships that Section 17 can be legitimately resorted
to only in extraordinary circumstances.

The Apex Court

noted that the Authorities had allowed almost the entire
period of two years available to them for completing
acquisition in consonance with the Act, as per the “usual
course”;

that

they

had

“enough

time

to

provide

opportunity for filing objections and holding inquiry under
Section 5-A of the Act” and hence there was no need to
invoke Section 17. These observations are obviously pithy
to the present case.

39.

Mukesh Hans is at the other end of the

spectrum, as will be evident from a reading of paragraph
37 thereof which we have already extracted above.

The

Supreme Court had noted that the concluding programme
of the festival had been conducted on the land sought to be
acquired without any hindrance; that the earlier attempt
for acquiring 40 bighas of land for the same purpose had
lapsed, and this fact had not been brought to the notice of
WP(C) 1289/1990

page 76 of 88

the Lt.

Governor.

The proceedings

were

therefore

quashed.

40.

In the present case we may refer to a couple of

notes/correspondence by Respondents'-Officers, which are
as under :Letter dated 26.10.1992 from the Dy. Director
(MP) states: “the Chief Architect, DDA prepared a
plan for shopping centre earlier in the year 1981
which has been implemented at site. In this plan,
the land under Essex Farms is not covered for the
shopping purpose and is shown as existing Essex
Farms.

In MPD-2001, this land which is under

Essex Farms forms part of the District Park area as
shown on the land use plan.

In actual fact only one legal entity is contesting

the acquisition, namely, the Petitioner. We can fully
appreciate that considerable time, running sometimes into
several years, is required to dispose of multiple and
multifarious objections that may be received under Section
5A from numerous persons who are interested in the large
tracts of land in the ownership of different persons. Where
there is only one person whose objections are required to

not oblivious of the fact that writ petitions are invariably
filed by the persons interested in the land with a view to
stalling the acquisition proceedings. In the interregnum in
which interim orders are in force such persons profit from
escalation in land prices. The Courts should as a rule not

Government to invite and decide Objections on the merits
of a proposed acquisition rather than run the danger of
getting lost in the skein of Objections relating to the
propriety of availing the extreme measures contained in
Section 17.
