The defendant is stated to be the owner of the suit land and he
is alleged to had entered into an agreement with the plaintiff to sell
the suit land to him for a total sale consideration of Rs. 33 lacs. The
sale agreement was executed between the parties on 22.04.2006.
The plaintiff is alleged to had paid Rs. 3 lacs to the defendant by
means of a cheque at the time of execution of agreement to sell on
22.04.2006. The plaintiff is also alleged to had made further
payment of Rs. 3 lacs to the defendant in cash viz. Rs. 2 lacs paid
against receipt on 25.04.2006 and Rs. 1 lac paid against receipt on
28.04.2006. The plaintiff has alleged that he was always ready and
willing to perform his part of the contract by paying the balance sale
consideration of Rs. 27 lacs and complete the transaction of sale in
terms of sale agreement dated 22.04.2006. According to the
plaintiff, the defendant did not even apply for obtaining NOC from
the Revenue Authorities and was avoiding the execution of sale
deed in respect of the suit land in favour of the plaintiff on one or
the other pretext. The plaintiff is stated to has sent a legal notice
dated 03.11.2006 to the defendant calling upon him to perform his
part of the agreement within 15 days from the receipt of the said
notice. However, since the defendant failed to comply with the
notice, the plaintiff has to file the present suit.

The defendant was duly served with the summons of the
present suit. Nobody appeared on his behalf despite service of
summons on him. He was, therefore, proceeded ex-parte vide order
passed by this Court on 22.04.2007.
The plaintiff filed his own affidavit in his ex-parte evidence. He
has reiterated the averments contained in the plaint in his affidavit
on oath. The plaintiff has proved the agreement to sell dated
22.04.2006 as document Ex. PW-1/1 and receipts of payment dated
22.04.2006, 25.04.2006 & 28.04.2006 as documents Ex. PW-1/2 to
Ex. PW-1/4 respectively. The legal notice dated 03.11.2006 sent by
the plaintiff to the defendant has been proved as document
Ex. PW-1/5.
The oral and documentary evidence produced by the plaintiff
on record has remained unrebutted. I have no reason to doubt the
said evidence. Upon perusal of the contents of the plaint, affidavit
filed by the plaintiff in his evidence and the documents tendered
and proved in his affidavit, this Court is of the opinion that the
plaintiff has succeeded in proving that the defendant is in breach of
the agreement to sell dated 22.04.2006 executed between the
parties. It is further proved from the affidavit filed by the plaintiff in
his evidence that the plaintiff was always ready and willing to

perform his part of the contract and it was the defendant who
committed breach of the terms and conditions of the above referred
agreement by not completing the transaction of sale.

Hence the

plaintiff is entitled to have a decree of specific performance in
respect of agreement to sell dated 22.04.2006 against the plaintiff.
In view of the above and having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case, a decree of specific performance in
respect of the agreement to sell dated 22.04.2006 (Ex. PW-1/1) is
hereby passed in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant
and the defendant is hereby directed to obtain NOC and execute the
sale deed in respect of the suit land in favour of the plaintiff and
