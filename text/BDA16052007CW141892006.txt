1.

The petitioner is challenging the order dated 01.09.2006 passed by

the Joint Secretary (CPV) & CPO, Ministry of External Affairs, Government of
India, New Delhi. By virtue of the impugned order, the petitioner's application
for restoration of her passport was rejected on the ground that there are still
pending criminal cases against the petitioner and the restoration of her passport
at this juncture may affect the ongoing proceedings before the court. The
allegations against the petitioner are that the petitioner (Ms Hina Chandrakant

Kakkad) tried to travel to London on 08.07.2004 on Passport No.E4175544
issued on 25.02.2003 to one Ms. Geetaben Dhirubhai Patel. It was revealed
that the photograph of the petitioner was replaced on the passport issued to Ms
Patel and thus a forgery was committed.

The petitioner was arrested on

08.07.2004 and remanded to police custody. Later on, she was released on bail.
It is an admitted position that the petitioner was issued a passport bearing
No.R831435 on 09.06.1994. On this passport she had travelled to London. In
1998, she got married in London. In 2004, while she was in India, this passport
(R831435) was reportedly lost. She applied for a fresh passport and was issued
a new Passport E8469206 on 08.04.2004 which is valid till 07.04.2014. When
she applied for this new passport which was issued to her on 08.04.2004, the
petitioner disclosed herself as single, though she was already married.

2.

However, the petitioner did not travel on this passport and was

apprehended on 08.07.2004 attempting to travel on the forged Passport
No.E4175544 which was issued to Ms. Patel. According to the learned counsel
for the respondents, the reason why she was travelling on this forged passport
was that she had applied for a U.K. visa and had been given the same in respect
of her Passport E8469206. The learned counsel for the respondents further
points out that on 08.07.2004 when she was attempting to go out of India, she
was travelling with the husband of Ms. Patel portraying and posing herself as
the wife of Mr Patel.

The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner insisted

that the present case was covered by various decisions of the Supreme Court
and those of the High Courts. He referred to the decision of the Supreme Court
in the case of State of Maharashtra v. Sukhdeo Singh: AIR 1992 SC 2100.
He also referred to the decision of a learned Single Judge of the Allahabad
High Court in the case of Aklesh Kumar Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh and
others: 1988 CRL. L. J. 1227. The decision of a learned Single Judge of this
Court in the case of Hajra Iqbal Memon v. Union of India: 1997 (41) DRJ
108 as well as the decision of a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court
in the case of Sri-la-Sri Arunagirinathar v. State: AIR 1989 MADRAS 3 were
also referred to.

4.

The Supreme Court decision was in the case of a concluded trial

wherein the question of suspicion taking place of evidence was considered.
The Supreme Court was of the view that the mere raising of ex facie grave
suspicion was not sufficient for a conviction in the absence of reliable evidence
and mere suspicion alone cannot be acted upon. The present case is entirely
different. The trial in the criminal case is yet to be concluded. The passport
officer in the present case had rejected the

petitioner's application for

restoration of her passport under the circumstances indicated above.

5.

Insofar as the decision of the Allahabad High Court is concerned,

that is clearly inapplicable because in that case the petitioner therein was facing
a charge under Section 498A IPC at the instance of his wife. A petition for
divorce by the petitioner was also pending. In that case the Magistrate, without
passing any order, merely directed the petitioner to go abroad on the condition
that he should take his wife with him. The Court observed that a positive order
ought to have been passed and the Magistrate, by merely making a suggestion,
exceeded his jurisdiction in doing so. Clearly, this has no applicability to the
facts of the present case.

6.

The decision in the case of Hajra Iqbal Memon (supra) is also not

applicable because in that case no reasons had been given in the impugned
order whereby the passport of the petitioner had been impounded. The Court
observed that the order had been passed hurriedly and, therefore, set aside the
same. This decision does not also apply to the facts of the present case.

7.

Insofar as the decision of the Madras High Court is concerned,

there was an oral order interdicting or preventing the petitioner therein from
travelling abroad. It is in this context that the learned Single Judge of the
Madras High Court had observed that the right to travel abroad is a
fundamental right provided the person concerned had a valid passport. Since
the petitioner therein had a valid passport, the oral order interdicting or
WP(C) No.14189/06

Page No.4 of 5

preventing the petitioner from travelling abroad, was held illegal.

This,

clearly, is not the situation in the present case.

8.

In view of the foregoing discussion, I see no reason to interfere

with the impugned order. Accordingly, this writ petition is dismissed.
