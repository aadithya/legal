KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
*
The present appeal preferred under Section 173 of The Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988, arises out of the award dated 10th July, 2006 of the
Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, whereby the Tribunal awarded a sum

MAC. App. 843/2006

Page 1 of 6

of Rs. 17,62,120/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annum to the
claimants from the date of filing of the petition till its realisation.
The brief facts relevant for deciding the instant case are
that on 25/9/2002 at about 10:45pm, the deceased Sh. Shiv Prasad
was coming to his residence at Noida from his office at Okhla in his
Maruti car bearing registration no. DL 3 CN 3919. On his reaching
Madanpur Khadar Mode at Mathura Road, New Delhi, a truck bearing
registration no. HR 29 A 7977, which was being driven in a rash and
negligent manner and at a very high speed by its driver, Sh. Sudhir
Kumar, struck against the aforesaid maruti car. As a result, both, the
truck and the car turned turtle and in the said accident, Sh. Shiv prasad
received fatal injuries. He was removed to AIIMS from the accident site,
where he was declared dead. A claim petition was filed by widow and
children of the deceased before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal
and award was made on 10/7/2006. Aggrieved with the said award
present appeal is preferred by the appellant insurance company.
Present appeal is limited to the question of doubling the
income of the deceased to compute the loss of dependency in
accordance with the judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court in Sarla
Dixit vs. Balwant Yadav – AIR 1996 SC 1274.
Sh. Pankaj Seth, counsel for the appellant insurance
company contends that the tribunal has erred in doubling the income

MAC. App. 843/2006

Page 2 of 6

of the deceased on the ground that had he been in the job for another
ten years then his income would have been doubled.
Per contra, Sh. L.K. Tyagi, counsel for respondents no. 1 to
5 has vehemently denied the said contention of the counsel for the
appellant. The counsel urged that the award made by the Tribunal is
just, fair and equitable in the facts and circumstances of the case.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have
perused the record.
On perusal of the award it becomes clear that the
deceased was having a bright career and had a good chance of
advancement in life, career and earnings had he not died in the
accident. PW-1, Smt. Sheela Devi has in her evidence by way of
affidavit deposed that the deceased was serving as a Production
Manager at M/s. Fascination India at Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-I and
was earning a salary of Rs. 13,200 pm. The copies of the salary slip
and salary certificate were duly brought on the record, as Ex. PW 1/7 &
1/8, and were also proved on the record. The said witness also
deposed that the deceased was a hard-working man and had a bright
chance of his promotion and he was likely to become the General
Manager of the Company had he not died in the accident, therefore,
his income would have increased manifold in the future. The said
deposition of PW- 1 has been further corroborated by the witness, PW-

MAC. App. 843/2006

Page 3 of 6

3, the Accounts Manager of the employer of the deceased. PW-3 had
also brought the salary record, Ex. PW3/B, of the deceased. PW-3 also
deposed that at the time of his appointment on 16/8/1981, the
deceased was drawing Rs. 3,500 pm as salary and gradually over a
period of time and at the time of the accident he was drawing Rs.
13,200 pm as salary. The said witness also deposed that the salary of
the incumbent on the post of Production Manager in their firm is
around Rs. 35,000-Rs. 36,000 pm. He further deposed that had the
deceased not died in the accident, he would have been drawing salary
to the tune of Rs. 35,000 pm approximately.
The issue pertaining to the doubling of the income of the
deceased for the purpose of computation of the loss of dependency is
no more res integra. It is the law of the land that while arriving at a just
compensation, the future prospects of the deceased are to be taken
into consideration if there is substantial material on record to support
the said claim regarding the future prospects. In this regard the
relevant portion of para 8 of the judgment in the case of Bijoy Kumar
Dugar v. Bidya Dhar Dutta, (2006) 3 SCC 242 is reproduced
below:“The mere assertion of the claimants that the
deceased would have earned more than
Rs.8000 to Rs.10,000 per month in the span
of his lifetime cannot be accepted as
legitimate income unless all the relevant
MAC. App. 843/2006

Page 4 of 6

facts are proved by leading cogent and
reliable evidence before MACT. The claimants
have to prove that the deceased was in a
trade where he would have earned more from
time to time or that he had special merits or
qualifications or opportunities which would
have led to an improvement in his income.
There is no evidence produced on record by
the claimants regarding future prospects of
increase of income in the course of
employment or business or profession, as the
case may be.”
In the case in hand, there is sufficient evidence on record
for granting future prospects while computing compensation. In the
instant case, from the testimony of PW-3 and the documents placed on
the record by him, there is no iota of doubt left that since the
appointment of the deceased in the year 1981 till his death in the year
2002, i.e. almost in the span of 20 years, the income of the deceased
has increased four times. Further, the tribunal has observed in the
award that on the basis of the appointment letter of the deceased, Ex.
PW-1/3, no date of superannuation of the deceased has been
mentioned and on the basis of his age, i.e. 50yrs, it could be safely
taken that he would have worked for another 10yrs and on the basis of
the said observation and the judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court in
Sarla Dixit vs. Balwant Yadav – AIR 1996 SC 1274, the tribunal
has granted the benefit of future prospects in the instant case. I do not
find any infirmity in the award made by the tribunal in this regard.
