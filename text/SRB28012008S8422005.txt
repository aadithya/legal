agreement on behalf of the first defendant; the second defendant is a partner in the first

defendant as its Proprietor. It is averred that subsequently defendant No.3 took over the

According to the plaintiff, pursuant to the distributorship agreement dated

29.7.2002, the defendants placed orders for supply of plaintiff’s products; the goods were
accordingly shifted/supplied to them during the period 29th July, 2002 to 2nd June, 2004.
The defendants placed orders for supply of consumer electronics and home appliances
products worth Rs.17,26,62,880/- (Seventeen Crore, Twenty Six Lakhs, Sixty Two
Thousand, Eight Hundred Eighty only). The plaintiff supplied the materials asked for;
the defendants released payments to the extent of Rs.16,88,45,900/- (Sixteen CRores,

the payment made and after taking into account the credit notes of Rs.1,26,22,825/- and
debit notes for Rs.1,65,62,778/-, sum of Rs.77,56,993/- is claimed outstanding and

The plaintiffs have

5.

The defendant issued a written confirmation

on 23rd March, 2004

that the

balance sum of Rs.79,74,725.52 as on 29th February, 2004 was payable to the plaintiff.
That document has been produced as Annexure 4 to the plaint.

6.

The plaintiffs avers that for the full satisfaction of its liabilities, the defendant had

issued a blank cheque enabling the plaintiffs to recover the amounts due to them by
filling the appropriate amount.

According to the plaintiff, the defendants agreed and

undertook to ensure that the cheques would be honoured when presented. However,
cheque bearing No. 331516, dated 26.5.2004 drawn on Oriental Bank of Commerce,
Bhopal for Rs.77,56,933.50 when presented was returned unpaid.

The plaintiff has

produced the said cheque as Annexure P-5 to the plaint; it has also produced the memo
of the Oriental Bank of Commerce, Bhopal issued to the IDBI Bank, the clearing Bank
dated 31.5.2004 indicating that the amount was not paid since the account was closed.
The plaintiff claims to have issued a legal notice dated 1.7.2004 upon the defendants
calling upon them to pay the sum of Rs.77,56,933.50.

It is further averred that the

defendants in their reply raised frivolous pleas and falsely alleged that Rs.35,00,000/was payable to them.

7.

In view of the above averments, the plaintiff claims a decree for the sum of

Rs.77,56,933.50 and interest at 22% per annum which according to it is the agreed rate
of interest; between the parties for the period from 29.7.2002 to2.6.2004. On that score,
a sum of Rs.10,66,578/- is claimed as interest till filing of the suit.

defendants with the pendente lite and future interest at 22% per annum till realization.

instructions.

12.

The terms also indicated that the defendant No.1 dealer was obliged to place the

orders of the plaintiff’s products at its office in New Delhi or other places which might
be notified from time to time.

The Ex. PW 1/3 is an extract of the customers ledger,

pertaining to the defendants’ account for the period 6.1.2004 to as on 5.1.2005 . It
discloses a balance payable liability as Rs.77,56,933.50.

Ex. PW 1 /4 (collectively) is

the series containing 840 documents. These documents are the invoices issued by the
defendant No.1 placing orders for supply of the plaintiff’s goods; each invoice is
accompanied with a delivery challan issued by the transporter and is acknowledged on
behalf of the first defendant by the second defendant.

13.

This court has examined the documents and pleadings on the record, in addition to

the dealership agreement and the documents discussed above.

The plaintiff has relied

on Ex. PW 1/5 which is the balance confirmation executed by the second defendant on
behalf of the first defendant, acknowledging that the sum of Rs.79,74,725.52 was payable
to it. The plaintiff has also produced the cheque bearing No. 331516 drawn on Oriental
Bank of Commerce, Habib Ganj Branch, Bhopal in its favour by the first defendant.
That was the cheque which was signed by the third defendant and is dated 26.5.2004. A
copy of the return memo by the Oriental Bank of Commerce dated 31.5.2004, has been
marked as Ex. PW 1/7 and it discloses that the reason for its dishonour was “Account
Closed”. The legal notice issued on 1.7.2004 along with postal receipts and AD Cards
indicates that the third defendant received the notice, and the same have also been
produced and marked as Ex. PW 1/8 collectively.

14.

From an examination of the pleadings and evidence, i.e. both

oral and

documentary, the plaintiff has been able to establish that it entered into a dealership
agreement with the defendant No.1, a sole proprietorship concern of the second
defendant. In terms of the said agreement Ex. PW 1/2 , the defendants 1 and 2 agreed to
place orders of the plaintiff’s products and comply with the other terms.

The orders

were to be placed upon the plaintiff’s office in New Delhi or such other office as
designated by it.

The plaintiff has also established that for the period claimed in the

pleadings, a sum of Rs.77,56,933/- was shown as outstanding and payable to the
defendants’ account; this is supported by Ex. PW 1/3, the invoices as well as the
delivery challans Ex. PW 1 /4. The latter documents show that the orders were placed
on the plaintiff; the goods were actually dispatched by it and received by defendant Nos.
1 and 2.

The plaintiff has also proved that the defendant No.2 acting on behalf of the

first defendant has acknowledged the liability for the sum of Rs.79,74,725.52 in exhibited
Ex. PW 1/5.
Ex. PW

In discharge of the defendants’ liability, a cheque for Rs.77,56,933.50

1/6 issued by the third defendant and drawn on Oriental Bank of Commerce

was furnished; it was returned with the remark “Account Closed”. The plaintiff has
further proved issuance of legal notice Ex. PW 1/8 along with postal receipts and AD
cards. In these circumstances, this court is of the opinion that the plaintiff has proved its
case for entitlement to a decree in the sum of Rs77,56,933/-.

15.

As far as the interest of Rs.10,66,578/-

@ 22% per annum is concerned, the

dealership agreement does not reflect any such condition.

However, the copies of

invoices produced as annexure Ex.. PW 1/ 4 (collectively), on the reverse incorporate
such a printed term. In the over all conspectus of the facts of this case, this court is of

CS(OS) 842/2005

the opinion that the said rate of interest is too high. Therefore, the plaintiff is held
entitled to interest at 12% per annum for the period from 29.7.2002 to 2.6.2004 till the
filing of the suit. As far as future interest is concerned, the plaintiff is entitled to 10%
upon the aforesaid amount and interest. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the
following terms:a)

Rs.77,56,933/-;

b)

Interest @ 12% per annum for the period 29.7.2002 to

2.6.2004 up to

the filing of the suit;
b)

Interest @ 10% on the amounts 1 and 2 above pendente lite, and till
realization of the above amounts.

The suit is decreed with costs in the above terms.
