PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

It is rather unfortunate that the appellants did not

implead as respondents the driver of the two wheeler scooter
bearing No. DNE-3788 nor the insurance company with whom
the scooter was insured.

My reason for so holding is that I

concur with the award wherein it has been held that the
deceased, Babu Lal, a pillion rider on the scooter being driven
by its owner, Sunil Kumar, did not die due to any rash act
committed by the driver of the DTC bus.
MAC.APP.No.10/2004

The evidence on
page 1 of 5

record establishes that Sunil Kumar was wholly responsible for
the tragic death of Babu Lal.
2.

It is not in dispute that on 8.4.1992 there was a

collision between the scooter driven by Sunil Kumar and DTC
bus bearing No.DEP-9672 at the crossing of Andrews Ganj when
both vehicles were on ring road.
3.

Version of the claimants was that Sunil Kumar along

with deceased were travelling in the southern direction on
Bhisham Pitamah Marg and at the crossing on Andrews Ganj
took a left turn and entered ring road.

According to them,

when the scooter had come on to ring road, the DTC bus
rammed into the scooter from behind and crushed Babu Lal.
4.

Version of the driver of the DTC bus is that not he,

but Sunil Kumar collided with his bus as he crossed the crossing
of Andrews Ganj and that after hitting the bus on its left side,
the scooter lost balance. The injured suffered fractures due to
impact and resultant fall, which proved to be fatal.
5.

Sunil Kumar appeared as PW-2 and in his testimony

supported the version of the claimants.
6.

The driver appeared as RW-1 and stood by his

version.
7.

No other witness was cited by either party.

8.

It is thus a case of word of mouth against word of

MAC.APP.No.10/2004

page 2 of 5

mouth.
9.

But, I have other evidence to break the impasse.

10.

Ex. R-2 is the inspection report of the two wheeler

scooter. The damage to the scooter is recorded as under:(1)

Front headlight cover bent.

(2)

Basket broken.

(3)

Right side engine cover bent.

11.

Ex. R-1 is the mechanical inspection report of the

bus. Damage recorded is as under:“rear gate – minor damage”
12.

Ex. R-1 & R-2 clearly establish that the scooter had

hit the bus somewhere near the rear entrance of the bus.
Obviously, it has to be the left side of the bus for the reason in
India traffic is driven on the left side. Further, the damage to
the scooter is on the right side engine cover as also the front
handle area. Thus the right side of the scooter hit the left side
of the bus.
13.

The scooter has not been damaged at the rear side.

Thus, the question of the bus hitting the scooter from the rear
does not arise.
14.

The site plan Ex. PW-7/B evidences that as the

scooter took a left turn from Bhisham Pitamah Marg on to ring
road it hit the bus towards the rear of the bus near the entry
MAC.APP.No.10/2004

page 3 of 5

gate of the bus.
15.

Ex. R-1, R-2 and PW-7/B probablize that the scooter

driver could not control the scooter when it entered on to ring
road.
16.

I find further corroborative evidence in the form of

MLC of the deceased. Certified copy of the MLC obtained from
the Criminal Court, though unexhibited or unproved, is at pages
137-139 of the Trial Court Record.
17.

If indeed, deceased was run over by the bus, MLC

would have recorded crush injuries. If indeed, deceased was
dragged by the bus, there would be extensive lacerated and
contusion wounds on the body of the deceased.
18.

The injuries recorded in the MLC are as under:1.

Fracture of pelvic

2.

Abrasion about 4cm into 3cm over right
shoulder joint

3.

Fracture of middle sternum

4.

Fracture of dorsal 1/3rd part of right clavicle

5.

Fracture

thoracic
19.

of

right

first,

second,

and

third

ribs
All injuries are on the right side of the face, right

shoulder and right side of the chest of the deceased.
20.

The injuries establish that the deceased was hit with

MAC.APP.No.10/2004

page 4 of 5

a blunt object on his right side with the torso of the body taking
the impact.
21.

This could have only happened if the scooter with its

driver and pillion rider hit the bus on its left side. Only in such
scenario would the right side of the scooter get damages and
the right side of the body of the pillion rider getting injured.
22.

Had the owner and the insurance company of the

scooter been impleaded as respondents, claimants could have
been awarded compensation against them.
23.

Unfortunately, nothing can be done to salvage the

situation for the appellants.
24.

The appeal is dismissed.

25.

No costs.

26.

LCR be returned.
