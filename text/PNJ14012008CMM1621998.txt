PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

By a common order dated 27.3.1997 HTA.No.139/97

to HTA.No.141/97 have been disposed of.
2.

Three petitions have been filed challenging the

same order for the reason each appeal related to a different
assessment order. I note that the 3 appeals challenged the
assessment order dated 31.1.1989 disposing of the two
pending proposals finalizing rateable value of the said property

Page 1 of 8

at

Rs.55,190/-

w.e.f.

1.4.1986

and

Rs.8,62,780/-

w.e.f.

2.2.1987.
3.

Rateable value fixed at Rs.55,190/- was accepted by

the assessee.

Challenge in the appeal was to the rateable

value fixed w.e.f. 1.4.1986 at Rs.8,12,780/-.
4.

The plot in question is B-17, Okhla Industrial Area,

Phase-I. It is held by the assessee under a leasehold tenure
which states that in case of sale 50% of the unearned increase
would be paid to the assessee.
5.

The

learned

assessing

officer

has

therefore

depressed the value of the property in relation to land value by
50%. Learned Additional District Judge has done likewise.
6.

Parties are not at variance on the said issue.

7.

The question which needs consideration is as to

what was the market value to be adopted when construction
commenced.
8.

Needless to state, the rateable value required to be

fixed with relation to the annual value of the property.

This

exercise required the standard rent to be determined under
the provisions of Delhi Rent Control Act,1957. In turn, the twin
component of the market value of the land when construction
commenced and cost of construction had to be the basis for
the reason during the relevant period, being a

commercial
Page 2 of 8

property, 8.625% of the market value of the land at the
commencement

of

construction

plus

reasonable

cost

of

construction would become the standard rent. Deducting 10%
therefrom would have yielded the rateable value.
9.

Since construction commenced in the year 1985

learned assessing officer has determined the market value of
the land in relation to sale instances of certain plots auctioned
in August,1985.

Land value

has been determined

at

Rs.1100/- per sq.mtr.
10.

Giving benefit of the unearned increase which had

to go to the Government, land value has been determined at
Rs.28,42,647/11.

The cost of construction furnished by the assessee

with reference to valuation report of an approved valuer has
not been accepted. The Assessing Officer has determined the
cost of construction at Rs.82,72,100/-.
12.

Rateable

value

of

Rs.8,62,780/-

has

been

determined.
13.

Learned Appellate Judge has found fault with the

Assessing Officer on both counts. With reference to the market
value of land learned Additional District Judge has noted that
the sale instances noted by the learned Assessing Officer
pertained to plots in phase-II, Okhla Industrial Area and that
Page 3 of 8

the plot in question was in phase-I.
14.

Learned Judge has also noted that land in phase-II

was more expensive than in phase-I.

Learned Judge has also

noted that the instant plot admeasures 4347.3 sq.mtrs. and
that smaller plots fetch a higher value.
15.

Learned Additional District Judge has opined that

land value could not be more than Rs.710/- per sq.mtr.
16.

I note the sale instances noted

by the learned

Assessing Officer. The same are as under :Plot No.

A perusal of the sale instances show that 4 out of 6

sale instances relate to plots in Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-I.
All were auctioned in 1985. Land rate vary from Rs.1101/- to a
maximum of Rs.1637/- per sq.mtr.
Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-II.

2 plots were auctioned in
Smaller plot

admeasuring

523.50 sq.mtrs. fetched a price of Rs.1,771/- per sq.mtrs.

A

larger plot admeasuring 1066.90 sq.mtrs. fetched a sale price
of Rs.1115/- per sq.mtr.
18.

Instant plot

is in phase-I.

Prima facie, the

Page 4 of 8

determination of the land value by the learned assessing
officer as also by the learned Additional District Judge is not
based on sound reasoning.
19.

As noted above, the learned assessing officer has

fixed the land value at Rs.1100/- per sq.mtr.

Learned

assessing officer ignored that a plot at Okhla Industrial Area,
Phase-II admeasuring 1066.90 sq.mtr. fetched a sale price of
Rs.1115/- per sq.mtr.
plot.

The instant plot is four times the said

The sale instances noted in the assessment order

themselves show that the larger plots get lesser price.
20.

Thus, market price of the said land had to be less

than Rs.1100/- per sq.mtr.
21.

The learned Additional District Judge from no where

has noted that plots at Phase-I were more valuable than the
plots at Phase-II.
22.

But, the only data available is the one recorded by

the Assessing Officer and as noted above.

It shows smaller

plots yielding a higher rate per sq.mtr.
23.

With reference to

plot No.H-24/5, Okhla Industrial

Area, Phase-II admeasuring 1066.90 sq.mtrs. which fetched
sale price of Rs.1115/- per sq.mtr., value of the instant plot

4347.30

sq.mtrs.

adopted

by

the

learned

Additional District Judge at Rs.710/- per sq.mtr. cannot be
Page 5 of 8

faulted with.
24.

Thus, not for the reasons noted by the learned

Additional

District

Judge

but

for

the

reasons

noted

hereinabove, I affirm the decision of the learned Additional
District Judge insofar as land value has been determined

at

Rs.710/- per sq.mtr.
25.

Pertaining to the cost of construction suffice would it

be to note that the assessing officer has given reasons but not
cogent

to reject the report of the valuer submitted by the

assessee.
26.

The learned Additional District Judge has taken the

mean figure i.e. the value assessed by MCD provided by the
government approved valuer.

I find no infirmity in the

approach of the learned Additional District Judge.
27.

Before concluding I may note that the rateable value

determined

by the learned Additional District Judge is

Rs.7,02,968/-.
28.

Thus, the differential in the rateable value comes to

approximately Rs.1.6 lacs.
29.

Revenue effect is about Rs.30,000/-

per annum.

This issue becomes a non-issue w.e.f. 1994 when Assessment
Bye Laws were changed and cost of land paid by the assessee
had to be taken as land cost.
Page 6 of 8

30.

The instant petitions thus relate to only a period of 6

years for the reason rateable value determined by the learned
Additional

District Judge stands adopted

only till the year

1993.
31.

I note that the current law pertaining to fixation of

rateable value relates to a unit area method and requires
pending asessments to be finalized on unit area method.
32.

If,

as

urged

by

the learned

counsel

for

the

petitioner, matter stands remitted to the assessing officer to
redetermine the rateable value, by revaluing the property
through a government approved valuer, right would accrue to
the assessee to have the rateable value determined on unit
area method meaning thereby the rateable value fixed would
be

less than half of what has been fixed by

the learned

Additional District Judge.
33.

I note that the contention urged by learned counsel

for the petitioner is that if the learned Additional District Judge
did not agree with the cost of construction determined by the
assessing officer matter ought to

be remanded to the

assessing officer to enable him to obtain a counter valuation.
34.

These are the petitions under Article 227 of the

Constitution of India. The fairness of the impugned order is a
relevant consideration while deciding the issue.

35.

I accordingly dismiss the petitions.

36.

No costs.
