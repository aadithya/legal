Anil Kumar, J. (Oral)

1.

This is a petition under Section 433(e) and (f) of the Companies Act,

1956 for winding up of the respondent company, Cosco Sales & Services Ltd.

2.

The contention of the petitioner is that the petitioner is registered under

the Companies Act, 1956 having its registered office at 15, Shivaji Marg, New
Delhi-110015. The respondent is also a company duly registered under the
Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 1 of 15

Companies Act, 1956 having its registered office at New Delhi within the
jurisdiction of this Court.

3.

The petitioner company contended that at all relevant times it owned

the industrial units, Siel Foods & Fertilizer Industries and Siel Chemical
Complex.

The company was manufacturing, selling supplying various

chemicals such as caustic soda etc. and the respondent was appointed as an
authorized dealer.

4.

The respondent was placing orders for purchase of various chemicals

as per respondent's requirement and purchasing goods under the name and
style of Cosco Sales & Services Pvt. Ltd. The respondent company has its
principle business at 301, AVG Bhawan, M-3, Connaught Circus, Middle
Circle, New Delhi. The name of the respondent company, according to the
petitioner was changed to Cosco Sales & Services Ltd. in 1993-1994.

5.

The goods were sold and delivered to the respondent by the petitioner

company.

The petitioner company had opened a running account in the

name of respondent company in its books of accounts and the price of goods
sold and delivered to the respondent used to be debited and the amounts
paid by the respondent company used to be credited. At the end of financial
Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 2 of 15

years, accounts used to be taken. As on 19 th May, 1997, an acknowledgment
for the liability of Rs.2,18,93,858/- was made by the respondent company to
the petitioner.

6.

The letter dated 19th May, 1997 by the respondent reads that as per

the statement of account of the respondent as on 31.3.1997, a sum of
Rs.1,43,93,858/- was payable from the respondent to the petitioner.
According to the books of accounts of the petitioner, an amount of
Rs.2,18,93,858/- was due. The respondent also claimed that an amount of
Rs.75.00 lakh was paid by the respondent to the petitioner which amount
was, however, not admitted by the petitioner.

7.

The petitioner has also relied on the minutes of meeting dated 9th

October, 1998 which are signed on behalf of petitioner and the respondent.
The minutes categorically stipulated that an amount of approximately Rs.1.25
crore is due from the respondent to the petitioner. By another letter dated 22nd
March, 2000 the respondent admitted further supplies of Rs.1,32,92,800 and
payment of Rs.1,65,81,163.

The respondent, however, alleged that the

payment was towards the new supplies and therefore, an additional amount
of Rs. 32,88363 had been made. The respondent claimed that for current
supplies full payments will be made and 15% amount be adjusted from the
Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 3 of 15

additional payment made.

8.

The petitioner gave a notice dated 2nd September 2002 under Section

433 and 434 of the Companies Act, 1956. The notice sent to the company
was received back with the remarks “refused”, however, the copies of notices
were served on the Directors. The acknowledgment cards of the service of
notice and the postal receipts have been produced by the petitioner. On
failure of the respondent to pay the amount, the present petition was filed
contending that the respondent company is unable to meet its liabilities and
pay its debts and is liable to be wound up.

9.

The respondent has filed a reply contending that the notice as provided

under Section 434 of the Companies Act, 1956 was not served and no such
notice dated 2nd September, 2002 was ever tendered on the registered office
of the respondent company. The respondent has also contended that the
transactions related to 1997 and the claim of the petitioner is barred by
limitation.

10.

By order dated 25th October, 2004, the respondent was directed to file

an affidavit giving the particulars of payment alleged to have been made by
the respondent to the petitioner along with supporting documents and three
Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 4 of 15

weeks' time was granted. By order dated 16th October, 2006, respondent
company was granted three weeks' time to file the affidavit in terms of order
dated 25th October, 2004 and subsequent orders.

11.

Despite the specific orders by this Court, since 2004 nothing has been

filed to show that the payments were made and nothing is outstanding from
the respondent to the petitioner company.

12.

I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner. Mr.Nitin Aggarwal

had appeared on behalf of respondent and had sought a pass over, however,
no one appeared after pass over on behalf of respondent.

13.

The first objection of the respondent is that the statutory notice dated

2nd September, 2002 was not served at the registered office of the respondent
company. Perusal of the record reveals that the statutory notice was sent to
the registered office by speed post, acknowledgment card was returned with
the endorsement of refusal. Nothing has been produced by the respondent to
rebut the report of refusal. The address of the respondent company on the
registered article is the address of the registered office of the respondent. In
the circumstances, the plea of the respondent that the notice was not sent at
the registered office of the respondent is not correct. The notices were also
Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 5 of 15

sent to the Managing Director and Shri Suresh Goyal as well as to two other
Directors, namely Aditya Goyal and Shri Gautam Goyal. The petitioners have
produced the registered A.D. card with the endorsement of receipt of the
notice on behalf of Respondent's Directors. A plea has been raised that the
addresses of Shri Suresh Goyal and Gautam Goyal as C-2/51, Safdarjung
Development Area, New Delhi is not the addresses of Shri Suresh Goyal and
Shri Gautam Goyal as they are the residents of 145 Sultanpur, Mehrauli, New
Delhi. Similarly, plea has been raised on behalf of Shri Aditya Goyal that he
is also not residing at C-2/51 Safdarjung Development Area, New Delhi and
he is residing at S-479, Greater Kailash-II, New Delhi. However, nothing has
been produced and it has not been established that the directors were not
residing at the addresses at which the registered postal article were served
on them. In the circumstances, the plea on behalf of the respondents is not
sustainable and is rejected. The inevitable inference in the facts and
circumstances is that the statutory notice was sent to the respondent and was
served and despite the statutory notice, neither any reply was given to the
notice refuting the pleas raised therein nor the respondent has paid the
amount to the petitioner company leading to the inevitable inference that the
respondent company is unable to pay its debt.

14.

The next plea of the respondent is that the amounts due from the

Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 6 of 15

respondent to the petitioner is barred by time as the last transaction took
place in the year 1997.

15.

The respondent had acknowledged by letter dated 19th May, 1997 that

an amount of Rs.1,43,93,858/- is due from the respondent to the petitioner
company though the respondent had taken a plea that a sum of Rs.75.00
lakh was also paid, however, the said fact was not admitted by the petitioner
nor the respondent has produced anything to show that the said amount of
Rs.75.00 lakh was paid by respondent company to the petitioner.

16.

In the minutes of meeting dated 9th October, 1998, it has been

acknowledged by the respondent that approximately Rs.1.25 crores is due
from the respondent to the petitioner company. This is an acknowledgment
within the period of limitation and, therefore, period of limitation will be
extended for a further period.

Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963

contemplates that where before the expiration of the period prescribed, an
acknowledgment of liability is made in writing, a fresh period of limitation shall
be computed from the time when the acknowledgment was signed. The
amount which was due till 31st March,1997, an acknowledgment was made
on 19th May, 1997 admitting an amount of Rs.1,43,93,858/- due from the
respondent company to the petitioner company. There has been a further
Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 7 of 15

acknowledgment of the liability of approximately Rs.1.25 crores by the
Director of the respondent company in the minutes of meeting dated 9th
October, 1998 which will give a fresh period of limitation from the said date.
There is yet another acknowledgment of the respondent company by letter
dated 22nd March, 2000. The petitioner and the respondent had a running
account and from November, 1998 to March 21, 2000, the respondent further
received supplies of net value of Rs.1,32,92,800/- against which a payment of
Rs.1,65,81,163/- was received.

It was admitted by the respondent that an

additional payment of Rs.32,88,363/- has been made from November 1998 to
March 21, 2000. Consequently, this cannot be refuted by the respondent that
the part payments have been made by the respondent company from
November, 1998 to March 21, 2000. Such part payments made on account
of the amounts due and the payment towards subsequent delivery of goods
will also extend the period of limitation from the time when the last time the
payment was made. The extension of period of limitation can not be negated
by the respondent by contending that the payment was made towards the
fresh supplies and not towards the amount which had been due on account of
earlier supplies. In any case the respondent had contended that the alleged
additional amount be adjusted at the rate of 15%. Consequently it can not be
contended by the respondent that the part amounts were not paid towards the
amount due from the respondent to the petitioner.

17.

The notice demanding the amount due from respondent to the

petitioner was given on 2nd September, 2002 and the present petition under
Section 433(e) and (f) was filed on 21st November, 2002. The statement of
account filed by the petitioner of the respondent also reveals that part
payment was made for Rs.81,160/- on 6th March, 2002. These facts have not
been rebutted by the respondent.

18.

This court in the case of Technofab Engineering Ltd. Vs Nuchem Weir

India Ltd, 136 (2007) DLT 22 had considered expression “payment” used in
Section 19 of the Limitation Act and had held as under relying on Rajesh
Kumari Vs Prem Chand Jain, 67 (1997) DLT 502 holding as under:
"7. ............. that issuance of a cheque by a debtor is "payment
on account of a debt or interest" and extends the period of
limitation by further period of three years from the date of issue
of cheque, even if the said cheque on presentation is
dishonoured. Dishonour of the cheque, it has been held does
not result in extinguishing the liability of the debtor and
constitutes effective "payment" for the purpose of Section 19 of
the Limitation Act. Once "payment by cheque" is accepted by
the creditor, he is entitled to extend the period of limitation under
Section 19 of the Limitation Act and the said advantage can not
be wiped off and undone by tortuous act of the other side by
withholding the payment.

19.

In the present case the part payment has actually been made by the

Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 9 of 15

respondent but later on it has been contended that the part payment was
towards the goods received subsequently and over payment was made and a
percentage of which was to be adjusted towards the amounts due earlier. The
letters and minutes of meeting also constitute acknowledgment as
contemplated under Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963. In Hansa
Industries (P) Limited Vs M/s MMTC Limited, 113, (2004) DLT 474 it was
held:
"19. We can deduce the following principles from the aforesaid
judgments which shall have to be applied in a given case
to ascertain as to whether writing constitutes an
acknowledgement or not:
(a) Acknowledgment means an admission by the writer
that there is a debt owed by him either to the
receiver of the letter or to some other person on
whose behalf it is received. It is not enough he
refers to a debt as being due from somebody. He
must admit that he owes the debt.
(b)

(c)

Words used in the acknowledgement indicate the
circumstances of jural relationship between the
parties such as that of debtor and creditors.

(d)

It must appear that statement is made with the
intention to admit such jural relationship.

(e)

Company Petition 399 of 2002

The statement on which a plea of acknowledgement
is based must relate to a present subsisting liability
though the exact nature of the specific character of
the said liability may not be indicated in words.

Such intention can be implied and need not be
expressed in words. In construing the words used in
the statement, surrounding circumstances can be
Page 10 of 15

considered although oral evidence is excluded.
(f)

Although liberal construction is to be given to such
statement but where a statement was made without
intending to admit the existence of jural relationship,
the Court cannot fasten such intention on the maker
by an involved or far-fetched process of reasoning.

(g) In deciding the question in a particular case, it is not
useful to refer to judicial decision and one has to
inevitably depend upon the context in which words
are used.

In the circumstances, applying these principles, it is inevitable to infer that
part payments were made by the respondent and the liability was also
acknowledged and consequently, the objection of the respondent that the
claim of the petitioner is barred by time can not be sustainable.

20.

The respondent has admitted that Rs.2,18,93858/- was due from the

respondent to the petitioner as on 31st March, 1997 out of which Rs.75.00
lakh was paid by the respondent company at the instances of the petitioner to
the corporate office of the petitioner company. However, the respondent is
unable to show and produce anything to show that an amount of Rs.75.00
lakh was paid to the corporate office of the petitioner.

Despite several

opportunities, no affidavit has been filed by the respondent to show that this
amount of Rs.75.00 lakh or any other amount alleged to have been paid by

Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 11 of 15

the respondent to the petitioner company nor any documents have been
produced.

21.

Even according to the averments made by the respondent, if only

Rs.69,93,858/- was liable to be paid as on 31st March, 1997, the respondent
has failed to produce any document to show that the alleged amount of
Rs.69,93,858/- has been paid by the respondent to the petitioner. The plea of
the respondent that the respondent had paid a surplus amount of
Rs.12,94,443/- has also remained un-substantiated.

The respondent is

unable to show anything that subsequently the payments have been made on
bill-to-bill basis. Even on the basis of alleged statement filed by the
respondent, where the payment has not been made bill wise, it cannot be
inferred that subsequently the payments have been made bill-wise merely on
the basis of the allegation of the respondent. The respondent in his reply has
not contended that the amounts were paid bill-wise subsequently. Since the
amount was due as has been acknowledged in the minutes of the meeting
between the representatives of the petitioner and the respondent on 9 th
October, 1998 and earlier it was acknowledged that an amount of
Rs.2,18,93,858 was due, the inevitable inference is that the said amount has
not been paid to the petitioner.

Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 12 of 15

22.

For a winding up petition under Section 433(e), there must be a debt

due and the company must be unable to pay the same and that due must be
determined or definite sum of money should be payable immediately or at a
future date.

From the facts stated hereinabove, it is apparent that the

respondent company has acknowledged the amount due to the petitioner
company and have failed to show that the said amount has been paid despite
various opportunities granted to the respondent company to file an affidavit
and the documents to show that the payment was made and no amount is
due to the petitioner. The disputes raised by the respondent company are not
bonafide nor the defense can be considered to be substantial. The defense
which has been raised by the respondent company is not likely to succeed on
any point of law. In the totality of facts and circumstances, it cannot be held
that the defense has been raised by the respondent company in good faith
and that the defense is likely to succeed in the point of law. The respondent
company has even failed to adduce prima facie proof of the facts on which
their defense depends. In the circumstances, the inevitable inference is that
the respondent has a debt due to the petitioner company which the
respondent company failed to pay despite opportunities and despite a
statutory notice which was duly served on the respondent company and
consequently the respondent company is unable to pay its debts.

Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 13 of 15

23.

It is no more res integra that failure to pay is presumption of proof of

insolvency. Under Section 434(1) (a), there is a deeming provision which
gets attracted when notice is given and the company does not act within the
statutory period of three weeks and neglects to make payment. During the
pendency of the petition also, respondent had sought an adjournment on 10th
May, 2005 on the ground that the parties are settling the matter. Even after
taking an adjournment, neither the matter has been settled nor the amounts
due

to

the

petitioner

company

has

been

paid

despite

demands.

Consequently, the inevitable inference is that the respondent company is
indebted to pay a sum of Rs.2,32,56,914.32 which also includes a sum of
Rs.1,65,52,949.32 as principal amount and Rs.67,03,965 as interest upto
31.10.2002. The respondent is liable to pay the interest and the amount of
interest was claimed in the notice which notice had not been replied. Thus the
said amount the respondent company has not paid to the petitioner despite
statutory notice of demand and the respondent company is unable to pay the
debt due from him to the petitioner. Consequently, the said amount is the
debt due and payable by the respondent company to the petitioner. Hence,
in the facts and totality of circumstances, the present petition for winding up is
entitled to be admitted.

24.

However, I defer orders for appointment of provisional liquidator and

Company Petition 399 of 2002

Page 14 of 15

for issue of citations for a period of one month within which period if the
respondent makes the aforesaid payment along with interest @ 9% per
annum from the date of filing of the petition, no further orders will be passed
and present winding up petition will be treated as disposed of. However, in
case, the above payment is not paid within one month, the official liquidator of
this court will be appointed as provisional liquidator and citations will be
directed to be issued on the next date of hearing.
