addressed to the firm and allegedly written by the petitioner
wherein petitioner admitted his liability to pay Rs.2 lacs to the

Page No.2 of 18

time.
Further as per the statement of account
maintained by the plaintiff in its day to day
CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.4 of 18

business the ledger of the plaintiff for
accounting year 1999-2000 showing the
outstanding or debit balance against the
defendant for Rs.1,94,649.00, therefore, the
plaintiff is entitled to recover an amount of
Rs.1,94,649.00 besides interest as per the
statement of account and ledger maintained
by the plaintiff in his day to day
business.”(underlining emphasised)
5.

After perusing the aforenoted averments one thing

that immediately strikes as odd, is the averment that the
proprietor of the petitioner placed an order with the firm on
2.1.2001 and on the basis of said order firm issued an
advertisement release schedule which was approved by the
proprietor of the petitioner Prakash Goswami on 27.12.1999.
How can this be possible?

Is there a typographical error in

mentioning the 2 dates?
6.

The error, if any, could be in the date on which

order was placed by the proprietor of the petitioner i.e.
2.1.2001 and not in the date of approval of advertisement
release

schedule

for

the

reason

advertisement

release

schedule has been placed on record and shows that the same
was approved on 27.12.1999.
7.

Petitioner raised its defence by way of filing a

written statement. Noting that the proprietor of the petitioner
was not assisted by a counsel vide order dated 28.9.2001
learned Trial Judge treated the said written statement as an
application under Order XXXVII Rule 3(5) CPC seeking leave to
CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.5 of 18

defend. Leave to defend was sought on following grounds:A.

16 bills raised by the firm are highly inflated.

B.

Neither proprietor of the petitioner nor any person

acting on his behalf acknowledged the receipt of said 16 bills
as claimed by the respondent.
C.

Letter

dated

26.6.2000

was

written

by

the

proprietor of the petitioner on the request of the husband of
the respondent Uday Goyal and without verifying the accounts
or the original bills.
8.

Material averments in the application seeking leave

to defend (written statement) filed by the petitioner are being
noted hereinunder:“3. That the defendant and his wife never
ever visited the plaintiff in her office. In fact,
Mr.Udya Goyal came to the defendant in
December, 99/Jan.2000 requesting him for
advt. business. The plaintiff is indulging him
unethical
conduct
by
involving
the
defendant's wife, a senior officer in Civil
Services, to give credence to her false and
frivolous petition. The defendant reserves his
right to initiate appropriate action under the
law against the plaintiff for making such false
and baseless statement in the court of law.
The defendant further submits that the
plaintiff be asked to produce the orders
placed by the defendant on 2nd Jan. 2000 as
claimed by her.
6-7 That the defendants can not comment
on the bills raised by the firm unless copies of
orders placed by the defendant are made
available alongwith original tearsheets and
bills
of
publications.
However,
the
defendant's estimate is that after discounting
CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.6 of 18

the over billing, excessive rates, cancelled
Advts, poor prints, wrong dates etc. The firm
has nothing much to claim from the
defendant. In fact, an advance cheque of
Rs.25,000/- issued to the firm had to be
stopped because the firm failed to produce
original billing documents inspite of repeated
reminders.
9. That the defendant has neither any firm nor
any authorized signatory who could sign
advts. Orders worth thousands of rupees on
behalf of the defendant.
As regards the
amount of Rs.2 Lacs as stated by the plaintiff,
it was a hand written note which was given to
Mr.Uday Goyal on his repeated pleadings. Mr.
Uday Goyal appeared worried and shaken on
that day and was infact, requesting for a note
for outstanding of Rs.5, Lacs to appease his
creditors who were pressing him for payment.
The defendant could not give him a factually
incorrect
statement
but
under
those
circumstances decided to give that note
because the firm's total billing including
excessive billing could have been between 1
and 2 Lacs at that time.
The defendant is
unable to calculate the exact figure due to
non-availability of original documents from
the firm.”(underlining emphasised)
9.

In response to the application seeking leave to

defend (written statement) filed by the petitioner respondent
filed her reply. In the said reply the reasons behind the oddity
in averment in the plaint as noted in para 5 above were
neither specified nor explained. It is pertinent to note that the
respondent reiterated that letter of confirmation was signed by
the proprietor of petitioner on 27.12.1999.
10.

After noting respective pleadings and contentions

advanced by the parties vide impugned order dated 19.1.2002
CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.7 of 18

the learned Trial Court refused to grant leave to the petitioner
and thus dismissed the application of the petitioner.

The

necessary consequence of the dismissal of the application was
that the suit of the respondent was decreed.

A decree was

passed in favour of the respondent directing the petitioner to
pay a sum of Rs.1,94,649/- together with interest @ 18% p.a.
from the date of filing of the suit till date of realisation.
11.

Unfortunately the learned Trial Court has not noted

the oddity in the averment in the plaint as noted in para 5
above and has mechanically reproduced the averments in the
plaint in the impugned order.

The same is evident from

following portion of the impugned order which is being
reproduced hereinbelow:“On 2.1.2001 the defendant placed order for
designing and release of advertisement in
daily newspaper of Delhi titled as “CINE
GOSSIP”, “AKELA HAI CHALO BAT KARE”, “WIN
EXCITING
GIFTS
FOR
YOUR
LOVE”,
“DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER”, “PARESHAN HAI
HAMSE BAAT KARE”, “STRESS IS A KILLER”.
As per the orders placed by the defendant the
plaintiff
issues
advertisement
release
scheduled to defendant which has been
acknowledged by the defendant and further
the defendant received and approved the
same by putting the signatures on the same
and the defendant issued the letter of
confirmation dt.27.12.99.
All approved
advertisement were published in different
newspaper by the plaintiff on different dates
continuously for the month of January to April,
2000.”

CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.8 of 18

12.

Even though the learned Trial Court has noted in

the earlier part of the impugned order that vide order dated
28.9.2001 it was held that written statement filed by the
defendant was to be treated as application seeking leave to
defend yet in the latter part of the impugned order it has been
held that the suit of the respondent is liable to be decreed for
the reason no leave to defend as required under Order XXXVII
CPC was filed by the petitioner. In this regard, decision of the
learned Trial Court reads as under :“It is submitted by Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff
that in fact there is no leave to defend and in
the absence of that the suit of the plaintiff is
liable to be decreed. It is a fact that in fact
there is no application for leave to defend as
the defendant only filed the written statement
without moving any application for leave to
defend. Even though written statement was
considered as leave to defend but technically
it is not the leave to defend as it is not
supported by affidavit. It is useful to refer to
95 (2002) DLT 183 in the case Rama Vision
Ltd. Vs. Couvery Electronics Ltd. & Anr., in
that case Hon'ble High Court relying 1973
Delhi 141 held that application for leave to
defend is required to be supported by
affidavit. In the absence of affidavit there is
no option but to accept the averment made in
the plaint and suit is liable to be decreed.
Hence suit of the plaintiff is liable to be
decreed, on this very ground.”
13.

The next ground on which suit of the respondent

was decreed by the learned Trial Court was that the
application seeking leave to defend filed by the petitioner does
not disclose any triable issue. In this regards decision of the
CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.9 of 18

learned Trial Court reads as under:“It is useful to refer to case of 2001 VII AD
(Delhi) 1018 in M/s Ganga Roller Flour Mills
Pvt Ltd. Vs. M/s A.B. Industries (Baba Road)
where it was held by the Hon'ble High Court
that it is a settled law that leave should not
be granted as matter of course unless and
until there is substantial defence and plea
raised by the defendant gives rise to triable
issue. It was further held that if affidavit
discloses positive defence that reflects such
state of facts that the defendant may succeed
in establishing his defence to the plaintiff's
claim, the defendant is entitled for leave to
defend. As already stated that the bills were
duly received by the plaintiff as is apparent
from the bills placed on record in para-6 the
details of the bills is mentioned. The plaintiff
has not specifically denied about the receipts
of the bills in his written statement. What he
stated in reply to this application that he
cannot comment on the bills raised by the
firm unless copies of the orders placed by the
defendant are made available along with
original tear sheets and bills of publication. So
he is not denying about the receipt of this
bills. What the defendant is stating is that
plaintiff should supply him the orders placed
by the defendant and the publication charges
given by the defendant to the different
newspapers. So far as the orders placed by
the defendant are concerned, the defendant
is naturally having the copies of those orders.
The plaintiff is not required to tell the
defendant as to how much publication
charges he is paying to the newspaper. The
contract between the parties was duly
approved on 27.12.99. The same is duly
signed by the defendant and in fact
defendant admitted his liability in no
uncertain terms vide his letter dt. 26.6.2000.
Defendant has not disputed about this letter
what he states about this letter is that Mr.
Uday Goyal, who is husband of the plaintiff
repeatedly pleaded and appeared worried.
Hence this letter was given to him. Naturally
CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.10 of 18

a party whose payment has not been made is
worried. This letter clearly spells that the
defendant has admitted his liability.
As already stated there is no leave to defend.
There is no affidavit. Even otherwise there is
no triable issue. Hence the suit of the plaintiff
is decreed to the effect that plaintiff is
entitled for a sum of Rs.1,94,649/- with 18%
interest from the date of filing of the suit till
realization with costs.....”
14.

In these circumstances petitioner has filed the

present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
15.

In the present petition besides reiterating the stand

taken by him in his application seeking leave to defend the
petitioner has also drawn attention of this court to the oddity
in the averment in the plaint as noted in para 5 above. In the
context of oddity in the averment in the plaint petitioner
averred as under:“(ix) Because the Ld. ADJ failed to appreciate
that
the
plaint
itself
states
that
Petitioner/defendant contacted the Plaintiff on
2.1.2001 and placed order for designing and
release of advertisements and subsequently
says confirmation letter was issued on
27.12.1999 more than a year before the
defendant is stated to have approached the
plaintiff firm, which itself shows that the
plaintiff has not approached the court with
clean hands. In fact the document dated
27.12.1999 is a rank forgery.”
16.

In the reply filed to the present petition respondent

has averred as under:“2. That the contents of para No.1 (wrongly
numbered) of the appeal also a matter of
CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.11 of 18

record and it is submitted that petitioner Sh.
Prakash Goswamy and respondent signed
advertisement
release
schedule
on
27.12.1999 and further placed an order as
per the release schedule on 02.01.2000”
3. That the contents of para No.2 of the
petition are matter of record. It is submitted
that on 27.12.1999, the petitioner also with
Mrs. Suchitra Goswami contacted the
respondent and signed release schedule for
designing and release of advertisement in
different daily leading news paper of Delhi, ad
title as “CINE GOSSIP”, “AKELE HAI CHALO
BAT KARE”, “WIN EXCITING GIFTS FOR YOUR
LOVE”,
“DIAMONDS
ARE
FOR
EVER”,
“PARESHAN HAI HAMSE BAT KARE” “STRESS
IS A MILLER”. The petitioner further confirmed
the respondent on 02.01.2001 regarding his
advertising and design of advertising and
petitioner agreed to pay the advertisement
and designing charges raised by the
respondent.
............
REPLY TO THE GROUNDS OF PETITION:
ix) That the contents of the para ix) of the
Ground of the petition are wrong and denied.
It is submitted the advertisement release
schedule was duly signed on 27.12.1999 and
confirmation was made subsequently on
02.01.2002. How it possible that the date of
confirmation letter will fall prior to the date of
the approaching of the contract.”
17.

As evident from averments noted in para 4 above in

the suit respondent had taken a definite stand that first an
order was placed by the proprietor of the petitioner with the
firm and thereafter on the basis of said order an advertisement
release schedule was prepared by the firm which was duly

CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.12 of 18

signed by the proprietor of the petitioner on 27.12.99 and that
on same date a confirmation letter was also issued by the
petitioner.
18.

However in the reply to the present petition

respondent made a complete turn around by averring that first
advertisement release schedule prepared by the firm was
signed by the proprietor of the petitioner on 27.12.99 and
thereafter on the basis of said schedule an order was placed
by the proprietor of the petitioner with the firm and that the
confirmation letter was subsequently issued by the petitioner
on 02.02.2001/02.01.2002.
19.

It is relevant to note that from a reading of plaint of

the respondent and reply filed by the respondent to the
present

petition

three

different

27.12.99,02.01.01,02.01.02 are emerging

dates

i.e.

in respect

of

issuance of confirmation letter by the petitioner.
20.

In coming to the conclusion that application seeking

leave to defend filed by the petitioner does not disclose any
triable issue following two things have weighed heavily with
the learned Trial Court:I.

The receipt of all 16 bills raised by the firm were

duly acknowledged by the petitioner.
II.

The receipt of said bills were not specifically denied

by the petitioner.
CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.13 of 18

21.

It is also relevant to note that the very basis of the

suit of the respondent was that the receipt of all 16 bills were
duly acknowledged by the petitioner.
22.

A perusal of the said 16 bills shows that the bills

dated 31.03.00 and 01.04.00 for amount of Rs.82,314/- and
Rs.71,014/- respectively does not bear any acknowledgment.
23.

The portion underlined in para 8 above shows that

the petitioner had clearly taken a stand that the receipt of said
16 bills were neither acknowledged by the proprietor of the
petitioner or by any person acting on his behalf.
24.

It is now necessary to note the law on the subject of

Order XXXVII CPC.
25.

After considering catena of judicial pronouncements

on the subject of Order XXXVII CPC following legal principles
can be culled out:I

The question to be considered in applications under

Order 37, Rule 3, Civil Procedure Code, is whether or not a
triable issue is disclosed on affidavit or otherwise by the
defendant. By triable issue is meant a plea which is at least
plausible. The defendant must state what his defence is, and
must, as a rule, bring something more before the Court to
show that it has a bona fide defence and is not a mere attempt
to gain time by getting leave to defend.
II

If there is a triable issue in the sense that there is a

CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.14 of 18

fair dispute to be tried as to the meaning of a document on
which the claim is based or the uncertainty as to the amount
actually due or where the alleged facts are of such a nature as
to entitle the defendant to interrogate the plaintiff or to crossexamine his witnesses then leave to defend should not be
denied.
III

If the defendant satisfies the Court that he has a

good defence to the claim on its merits the plaintiff is not
entitled to leave to sign judgment and the defendant is
entitled to unconditional leave to defend.
IV

If the defendant raises a triable issue indicating that

he has a fair or bonafide or reasonable defence although not a
positively

good

defence

the

defendant

is

entitled

to

unconditional leave to defend.
V

Even in cases where defendant shows that on a fair

probability he has a bona fide defence, he ought to be granted
leave to defend.
VI

Leave to defend should not be refused where

serious conflict as to matter of fact or where any difficulty on
issues as to law arises.
VII

The Courts should not reject the defence of the

defendant merely because of its inherent implausibility or its
inconsistency.
VIII

At the stage of granting leave to defend, the Courts

CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.15 of 18

can only consider whether the facts as alleged by the
defendant, if true, afford a good defence and not whether they
are true or not.
IX

If the defendant disclosed such facts as may be

deemed sufficient to entitle him to defend, that is to say,
although the affidavit does not positively and immediately
make it clear that he has a defence, yet shows such a state of
facts which leads to the inference that at the trial of the action
he may be able to establish a defence to the plaintiff's claim
the defendant is entitled to leave to defend but in such a case
the Court may in its discretion impose conditions as to the
time or mode of trial but not as to payment into Court or
furnishing security.
X

Leave to defend is declined where the Court is of

the opinion that the grant of leave would merely enable the
defendant to prolong the litigation by raising untenable and
frivolous defences. The test is to see whether the defence
raises a real issue and not a sham one, in the sense that if the
facts alleged by the defendant are established there would be
a good or even plausible defence on those facts.
XI

If the defendant has no defence or the defence set

up is illusory or sham or practically moonshine then ordinarily
the plaintiff is entitled to leave to sign judgment and the
defendant is not entitled to leave to defend.
CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.16 of 18

XII

If the defendant has no defence or the defence is

illusory or sham or practically moonshine then although
ordinarily the plaintiff is entitled to leave to sign judgment, the
Court may protect the plaintiff by only allowing the defence to
proceed if the amount claimed is paid into Court or otherwise
secured and given leave to the defendant on such condition,
and thereby show mercy to the defendant by enabling him to
try to prove a defence.
26.

Facts of the present case particularly, the loopholes

in the case of the respondent, when analyzed in the light of
afore-noted legal principles entitle the petitioner to be entitled
to get leave to defend. The ever-changing and flip-flop stand of
the respondent coupled with the fact that the 2 bills which
account for 55% of the total payment claimed by the
respondent

from

the

petitioner

does

not

bear

any

acknowledgment as alleged by the respondent entitles the
respondent to get leave to defend.
27.

However noting that the proprietor of the petitioner

admitted that he had written letter dated 26.06.00 require a
condition to be imposed as there is a partial acceptance of
liability. It is for the proprietor of the petitioner to establish at
the trial that he had written said letter at the request of the
husband of the respondent and without verifying the accounts
and original bills.
CM(M) No.899/2004

Page No.17 of 18

28.

I note that vide order dated 14.5.02 this court had

directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs.1 lakh with this
court. Pursuant to deposit of Rs.1 lakhs made by the petitioner
execution of the decree was stayed.
29.

I direct that the deposit of Rs.1 lakh made by the

petitioner be treated as the condition upon which the leave to
defend is granted to the petitioner.
30.

In view of the above discussion I dispose of the

present petition by holding as under:I

Impugned order dated 19.01.02 passed by the

learned Additional District Judge, Delhi is set aside.
II

Conditional leave to defend the instant suit is

granted to the petitioners in terms of para 29 above.
III

The amount of Rs.1 lakhs deposited in this court be

remitted to the learned Trial Court.
IV

Parties are directed to appear before the learned

trial court on 25.2.2008.
31.

No costs.
