Insofar as the Joint Memorandum of Settlement dated 23.05.2007 is concerned,
the same has been examined by me and I find that the same is lawful. The
other terms of settlement are incorporated in the application itself. The same
are also lawful. Accordingly, the settlement, arrived at between the parties, is
taken on record and the parties are bound by the terms thereof including the
terms of joint Memorandum of Settlement dated 23.05.2007. The application
has been signed by the plaintiffs as well as the defendant Nos 1 to 4 and by Mr
Sidharth Swarup (the former defendant No.5). The respective counsel for the
parties have also signed the said application. The affidavits of Mrs Anisha
Malhotra and Mr Gaurav Malhotra (Plaintiff Nos 1 and 2) as well as Mr
Amiteshwar Singh, (defendant No.1) Ms Ritu Kapur (defendant No.4) and the
said Mr Sidharth Swarup are on record. Mr Amiteshwar Singh is also the
authorised representative of defendant Nos 2 and 3. This application alongwith
the annexures shall be marked as Exhibit C-1. It shall form part of the decree.
The suit is decreed in terms of the Joint Memorandum of Settlement dated
23.05.2007.
This application, the suit as well as all other pending applications
stand disposed of.
