JUDGMENT
In this writ petition the Petitioner prays for the

issuance of a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate
writ, order, or direction, quashing and setting aside the
Order

dated

8.3.2007

WP(C) 2751/2007

by

which

his

application

for

Page 1 of 13

Resignation of Commission had not been acceded to, on the
ground that it is arbitrary, illegal and violative of the
Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 226 of the
Constitution and also being violative of the provisions of
the statutory policies of the Respondent. We are unable to
appreciate

any

manner

Fundamental

Rights

Constitution

have

in

enshrined
been

which
in

the

Article

transgressed.

If

Petitioner's
21

of

the

punctilious

approach were to be adopted the Petition could be
dismissed for this narrow reason. This Petition is one
amongst the batch of petitions where the request for
premature retirement and/or resignation has been declined
by the Respondents. However, in other petitions a Writ of
Certiorari has been prayed for.

2.

This distinction between writs of mandamus and

certiorari is relevant for the reason that the impugned
Order is indubitably a cryptic one and does not contain the
reasons on which the decision is predicated. In all other
similar matters where certiorari has been prayed for we

WP(C) 2751/2007

Page 2 of 13

have also called for the records for our perusal. Mr.V.
Sekhar, learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner, however,
contends that since reasons are not contained in the
impugned Order itself, it must be set aside on that short
ground.

3.

The following observations found in the celebrated

decision in Mohinder Singh Gill -vs- The Chief Election

Commissioner, New Delhi, AIR 1978 Supreme Court 851
are relevant to this question:
“8.

The second equally relevant matter is that

when a statutory functionary makes an order
based on certain grounds, its validity must be
judged by the reasons so mentioned and cannot be
supplemented by fresh reasons in the shape of
affidavit or otherwise. Otherwise, an order bad in
the beginning may, by the time it comes to court
on account of a challenge, get validated by
additional grounds later brought out. We may
here draw attention to the observations of Bose J.
in Gordhandas Bhanji (AIR 1952 SC 16) (at p. 18):
“Public orders publicly made, in exercise of a
statutory authority cannot be construed in the

WP(C) 2751/2007

Page 3 of 13

light of explanations subsequently given by
the officer making the order of what he meant,
or of what was in his mind, or what he
intended to do. Public orders made by public
authorities are meant to have public effect
and are intended to affect the acting and
conduct of those to whom they are addressed
and

must

be

construed

objectively

with

reference to the language used in the order
itself”.
Orders are not like old wine becoming better as
they grow older.
In somewhat similar vein, in Babu Verghese -vs- Bar

Council of Kerala, (1999) 3 SCC 422, the Apex Court was
called upon to consider a case under the Advocates Act.
While doing so it applied the same principles earlier
enunciated in Taylor -vs- Taylor, (1875) 1 Ch D 426 and in

Nazir Ahmad -vs- King Emporer, AIR 1936 Privy Council
253. The Apex Court observed as follows:
“It is the basic principles of law long settled that if
the manner of doing a particular act is prescribed
under any statute, the act must be done in that
manner or not at all. The origin of this rule
traceable to the decision in Taylor Vs. Taylor which

WP(C) 2751/2007

Page 4 of 13

was followed by Lord Roche in Nazir Ahmad Vs.
King Emperor.”
What these pronouncements prescribe is that the records
should contain the reasons on which the decision is
predicated, and that these reasons or justifications cannot
be added upon. No prescribed prescriptions as to the
format of a decision on the dispute before us exists. We
cannot ignore the wisdom of not giving full details in the
rejection Order where, in doing so, sensitive information
may pass into public domain.

4.

Mindful of the above precedents we had asked for the

personal records of the Petitioner to be made available for
our perusal and consideration. Whilst reasons have not
been disclosed or stated in the impugned Order, a reading
of the records bears out that the Respondents are not
attempting to add to the grounds or arguments as the case
progresses. The reasons for rejection are available on the
record itself. Wherever Certiorari is an appropriate relief it
is advisable to call for the records of the case. A Division
Bench of this Court had considered this conundrum in
WP(C) 2751/2007

Page 5 of 13

great detail in WP(C) No.15557/2004 titled S.K. Aggarwal,
Ex. Brig. -vs- Union of India decided on 24.8.2000 wherein
it was inter alia opined that so long as there is some
relevant material available on the record on which the
action can be sustained, the Writ Court should be slow to
exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction. We are in respectful
agreement with this exposition of the law. The argument of
Mr. Shekhar, that the Order should itself contain all the
grounds which have led to the rejection of the application,
is accordingly rejected.

5.

Regarding the subject matter of this Petition we will

merely record the contention of Ms. Jyoti Singh, learned
counsel for the Respondent, that one of the reasons for
rejection

of

the

Petitioner's

request

for

premature

retirement/resignation of Commission is the shortage of
manpower/officers. Learned counsel for the Petitioner has
strenuously relied upon the statements made before
Parliament, as recently as in May, 2006, giving details of as
many as 275 pilots/officers of the Indian Air Force (IAF)

WP(C) 2751/2007

Page 6 of 13

who have been released from service during the period
January, 2003 to April, 2006. The Report reads as follows:Thursday, May 11, 2006
Ministry of Defence
EXODUS OF TRAINED PILOTS
Rajya Sabha
A statement indicating cost of initial training of a
pilot in the Indian Air Force is annexed.
The requests for acceptance of premature
retirement/resignation

from

the

pilots

are

considered as per the Government instructions.
The details of the pilots who have been released
from the service during the last three years (from
Jan 2003 to April 2006) as indicated below:Flying Officer

Most of the pilots, who have been released from
service had completed more than 1000 flying
WP(C) 2751/2007

Page 7 of 13

hours. The premature retirement/resignation of
pilots has not affected the operational status of
the squadron. Sustained efforts are made to
review and augment the manpower requirements
of the Indian Air Force on a continuous basis.
(emphasis added)
The job profile and job requirements of the pilots
in the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the pilots in
commercial

airlines

are

different

and

not

comparable. The sanctioned strength of pilots in
the IAF is 3236 and the actual strength is 2922 (as
on 1-8-2005). The improvement in the job profile of
the IAF pilots is a continuous phenomenon keeping
in

view

the

job

specific

requirements

and

operational necessity.
236 pilots of the Indian Air Force proceeded on
premature retirement in the last three years. The
main reasons are supersession, low medical fitness
or compelling personal reasons. Information about
these pilots joining private airlines is not available
with the Government.

6.

The

argument

that

statements

made

before

Parliament need not be accurate has only to be stated to be
rejected. Accurate statements are required to be made in

WP(C) 2751/2007

Page 8 of 13

Court as well as before Parliament. Both the Forums
require candid, precise and truthful statement. However,
the Petition can be decided de hors this contention and,
therefore, we do not propose to delve further into this
point. There can be no gainsaying that while judicial
Review is available against every administrative order, its
exercise would be unjustified if the Writ Court merely
substitutes its own preferred reasoning with that of the
Administration. In other words, in order to justify the
exercise of the extraordinary powers under Article 226 of
the Constitution, where an administrative decision is being
set aside, it must be perverse or suffer from Wednesbury
unreasonableness, rendering it akin to a decision which no
reasonable person would arrive at. It is within these
parameters that we must review the impugned Order.

7.

Having perused the records as well as the documents

available on the records of this Court it is quite evident that
the Petitioner was duly counselled and was granted an
Interview at the highest echelon of the IAF, nay at its very

WP(C) 2751/2007

Page 9 of 13

pinnacle, that is, by the Chief of Air Staff. It has rightly
been contended that so far as the Petitioner is concerned it
is premature to contend that his career prospects have
been adversely affected. This is for the reason that he is
eligible for consideration for promotion to the next rank of
Group Captain only in the year 2010 by PB2/2010.

8.

No person can be permitted to take advantage of his

own wrong. This legal dictum can be extrapolated to the
facts of the present case inasmuch as it is the Petitioner
who had sought compassionate posting at Hyderabad for
various reasons which we need not go into any further. In
fact, two adverse Career Certificates have been furnished
by the Petitioner, referring to his application for requesting
a posting on compassionate grounds and stating that he
was fully aware that if his request was acceded to, it may
have an adverse effect on his career. In the event, the
Petitioner has enjoyed a posting at his instance at
Hyderabad for five years, commencing from the year 2000.
Indeed, the Petitioner possesses extraordinary assessments

WP(C) 2751/2007

Page 10 of 13

as a Fighter Pilot and as an Instructor of younger pilots.
The records are replete with these commendations. The
grievance that he has been assigned Prithvi Missile System
(PMS)

is

attributable

to

his

own

request

as

it

is

contemporaneous to his request for compassionate posting.
Since the Petitioner wanted to remain in or in close
proximity to Hyderabad, the Respondents cannot be faulted
for assigning him to whatever duties were then available. It
has been argued by Mr. Shekhar that the Petitioner had
thereafter been posted to a Fighter Unit, but this decision
was withdrawn by the Respondents themselves. These are
exigencies of service stemming from the Petitioner's
request for compassionate posting, which the Writ Court
must be loathe to venture into. It is incorrect for the
Petitioner to contend that he was assigned to PMS contrary
to his desire. It could well be that this was the only avenue
available
Petitioner

to
so

the
far

Respondents
as

his

to

request

accommodate
for

the

compassionate

appointment was concerned. We have been supplied with a
list of Officers trained in the PMS with an analysis drawn

WP(C) 2751/2007

Page 11 of 13

by the Petitioner that there is surplus of such trained
officers.

The

Petitioner

is

presently

posted

at

Air

Headquarters in a non-flying assignment for the simple
reason that all officers and pilots cannot always be
assigned flying duties throughout their career. It is indeed
speculative that the Petitioner shall continue henceforward
either as a Prithvi Missile Specialist or in a non-flying
posting.

9.

The decision of the Respondents not to accede to the

Petitioner's request for premature retirement or for that
matter

for

resignation

cannot be seen

as perverse.

Wherever the Armed Forces are concerned the Writ Court
must be constantly mindful of the fact that discipline is the
foremost consideration.

An eloquent argument was put

forward that the Petitioner is quite willing to forgo all his
pensionary and other benefits. This argument, however,
assumes that these rights have already come into force in
his favour, which is a fallacious assumption. The Petitioner
must serve for twenty years before any such entitlement

WP(C) 2751/2007

Page 12 of 13

enure to his benefit.

10.

This is not a case where it would be appropriate to

exercise the extraordinary powers under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India.

Petition is without merit and is

dismissed.
