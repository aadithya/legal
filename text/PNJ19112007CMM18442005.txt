PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
This petition is directed against the order dated 5.8.05

passed by the Additional District Judge, Delhi whereby application of
the petitioner under Order VIII Rule 1-A(3) read with Order XIV Rule 8
and Section 151 CPC seeking leave to file additional documents was
dismissed.
2.

Petitioner no.1, M/s Apex Apartments is a company

incorporated under the Indian Companies Act 1956 engaged in the
business of construction of residential and commercial buildings and
petitioners nos. 2 and 3 are its directors.
page 1 of 12

3.

Petitioners are the defendants in the suit filed by the

respondent for the relief of decree of specific performance of the
contract, mandatory and permanent injunction and damages.
4.

It was pleaded in the plaint that the defendants

advertised for the sale of 16 flats to be constructed on the plot
bearing No.E-480, Greater Kailash-II, New Delhi. That the plaintiff
decided to purchase one of the said proposed 16 flats i.e. Unit
No.UG-2, E-480, Greater Kailash-II, New Delhi. An agreement to sell
dated 13.1.1988 was entered into between the plaintiff and
defendants for a total sale consideration of Rs.9,50,000/-. A sum of
Rs.1,10,000/- was paid by the plaintiff at the time of the execution of
the agreement. That as per the terms of the agreement, balance
sale

consideration

was

to

be

paid

commensurate

with

the

construction of the flat. That the plaintiff made a total payment of
Rs.5,40,000/-. That some payments were made by cheques and
some in cash. That the defendants failed to perform their part of
obligation under the agreement.
5.

In the written statement the defendants denied the

averments made in the plaint and pleaded that the payment of the
balance sale consideration was not to commensurate with the
construction of the flat but was to be paid in accordance with
Schedule A of the agreement. That the plaintiff defaulted in making
payment of the balance sale consideration. That 'time of payment of
page 2 of 12

balance sale consideration was the essence of the agreement' and
therefore by defaulting in making necessary payments the plaintiff
breached the agreement.
6.

After pleadings were completed, parties filed respective

documents. Issues were framed and plaintiff commenced evidence.
On behalf of the plaintiff, Ms. Charita Arora, PW-1, wife of the
plaintiff was examined and thereafter plaintiff's evidence was
closed.
7.

At this stage defendants moved an application under

Order VIII Rule 1-A(3) read with Order XIV Rule 8 and Section 151
CPC seeking leave to file additional documents. The documents
sought to be filed were certified Copies of Form C dated 5.1.88,
Form D dated 7.12.88 issued by the MCD relating to the premises
bearing No. E-480, G.K.-II, New Delhi, certified copy of the Extract of
the Inspection Register of the MCD, House Tax Department dated
2.1.88 and certified copies of the Ledger Book of the defendant, M/s
Apex Apartments Pvt. Ltd. Reason for filing the documents as
pleaded in application are as under :“3. That although in the pleading the Plaintiff has
not raised the specific plea regarding the stage and
date of the construction of the suit property, and the
Plaintiff has not filed any replication denying the
statement made by the Defendants in their Written
Statement that the Defendant no.1 had already
completed the suit premises but for a few finishing
touches, but PW 1 in her evidence deposed contrary
to the pleadings.
xxxxx
page 3 of 12

5.
That during the course of the cross
examination of PW1 it was for the first time alleged
by PW1 that the construction was not being carried
out at full swing during the period of June 1988
onwards.
xxxxx
7.
That at the time of framing of the issues it had
not been advised by the counsel of the Defendants
to file the above said records of the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi regarding the building in
question, as in the pleading the Plaintiff had not
specifically raised the dispute regarding the date
and stage of the construction, but in the cross
examination the Plaintiff for the first time raised the
allegations regarding the date and stage of the
construction.
xxxxx

8.

9.
That Certified Copy of the Ledger Book was not
available, and nor in the possession of the
Defendants as the Ledger Book of the Defendant
no.1 Company is lying in the Court of Shri Digvinay
Singh, M.M., since 1992, and the certified copies of
the same has been obtained now by the
Defendants. The said Ledger Book has been in the
custody of the Court much prior to the filing of the
present suit by the Plaintiff, and the copy of which
the Defendants want to place on record are beyond
any reasonable doubt.”
Vide impugned order dated 5.8.05 the learned ADJ

dismissed the application on the ground that the defendants had
sufficient opportunity for filing the documents at the

appropriate

stage.
9.

In support of the petition, learned counsel for the

petitioners/defendants contended that the harmonious construction
of Order Order VIII Rule 1-A(3) read with Order XIV Rule 8 makes it
page 4 of 12

clear that the court has the power to receive documents produced
subsequent to the filing of the written statement and even in the
absence of any good cause being shown for the delay in production
if the Court is satisfied that the said documents are necessary for
proper determination of the controversy between the parties, the
Court could receive the same. That the learned Judge should have
permitted the petitioners to file additional documents as they are
having material bearing on the questions in controversy between the
parties. Reliance was placed upon the following judgments :i.

P. Raghu & Ors v K. Anjaiah 2004 (1) ALD 366.
The law relating to production of documents in civil

proceedings was drastically changed by the Amendment Act of 1999
and 2002.
11.

Noting the relevant provisions in the CPC before and

subsequent to the Amendment Act 1999 and 2002 including the
provisions relied upon by the petitioners, the Karnataka High Court
in the decision reported as Nanjunda Setty v Tallam Subbaraya
Setty & Sons & Ors ILR 2004 Kar 924 observed as under :“19. Therefore, what follows from the aforesaid
discussion is the documents on which the parties
rely on in support of their case could be broadly
classified as under:
1. Document upon the plaintiff sues/document upon
which the defendant bases his defence;
2. Documents in possession or power of the
plaintiff/defendant in support of his claim/defence on
which they rely on;
3. The original of documents mentioned at (1) and (2)
supra;
(4) Documents on which the parties rely on and which
are not in their possession or power;
(5) The documents on which the parties rely on
incidentally but not to support their claim or defence
and documents to disprove the claim or defence of the
page 6 of 12

opposite party.
(6) The documents which come into existence after the
pleadings are filed into Court.
20. The documents belonging to category (1) and (2),
if they are not produced along with the pleadings shall
not be received in evidence without the leave of the
Court at the hearing of the suit. Documents of category
(3) shall be filed on or before settlement of issues.
Documents (4), (5) and (6) could be filed along with the
affidavit. Therefore, it is clear that if documents
belonging to Category (1) and (2) are not produced
along with the pleadings and documents at Category
No. 3 are not produced at or before settlement of
issues and documents mentioned in Categories (4) and
(5) are not produced along with affidavit, the party
loses a right to produce those documents at the
subsequent stage of hearing of the suit..........”

12.

Production of documents at the appropriate time and

stage is the rule. Receiving documents at the subsequent stage of
the hearing is an exception. Relevancy of documents coupled with
the sufficiency of cause which prevented the party from filing the
documents at an appropriate stage and the prejudice which will be
caused to the opposite party if document is allowed to be filed at the
subsequent stage have to be considered in totality with weightage
to all the 3 limbs while considering a plea for filing documents at a
subsequent stage of the proceedings.
13.

The legality of the impugned order is to be tested on the

anvil of law as aforenoted.
14.

It is not in dispute that the additional documents sought

to be filed by the petitioners fall in category two i.e. (i) Documents in
possession or power of the plaintiff/defendant in support of his
page 7 of 12

claim/defence on which they rely on and (ii) should have been filed
along with the written statement.
15.

As already noted in para 7 above, petitioners sought to

file documents viz. certified copies of Form C dated 5.1.88, Form D
dated 7.12.88 and Extract of the Inspection Register of the MCD,
House Tax Department dated 2.1.88 on the ground that the plaintiff
did not take the plea in the plaint that the construction of flat in
question was being done at a slow pace by the petitioners during
the period of June 1988 onwards. That this plea was first time raised
by the Ms.Charita Arora in her testimony as PW-1. That their counsel
had advised them to file the said documents only when the plea
relating to status of construction of flat was raised by the plaintiff.
That the said documents are relevant for deciding this controversy
in as much as the documents would show the status of construction
of flats in question.
16.

In order to determine the sufficiency of the cause as shown by

the petitioners, it is necessary to note the plaint filed by the plaintiff.
Relevant portion of the plaint reads as under :“3. That acting on the representation of the defendants,
the plaintiff made a booking with the defendant No. 1 of
one of the said proposed 16 flats, namely Unit No. UG-2,
in property No. E-480, Greater Kailash-II, New Delhi
paying thereunder a sum of Rs.60,000/- in cash and a
sum of Rs.50,000/- by way of cheque No. 992964 on
18.1.88 and an agreement to sell dt. 30.1.88 was entered
into by the plaintiff with the defendant no.1 through
defendants no. 2 and 3 respectively for a total sale
consideration of Rs.9,50,000/-.
page 8 of 12

After
the aforementioned
advance payment
of
Rs.1,10,000/- the balance price was to be paid in
installments relating to the completion of various stages
of construction of the said building or as per the details of
payment as given in Schedule A of the said agreement to
sell. The plaintiff made a total payment of Rs.5,40,000/to the defendant no.1 in respect of the said booking of the
said flat vide cheques and cash as detailed herein under:
Date of Payment

4.
That after making the aforementioned
payments, the plaintiff followed up with the defendants
requesting them to expeditiously complete the building
and hand over the possession of the said flat booked by
the plaintiff.
Thereafter the plaintiff was settled in
Canada and his representative was used to follow up with
the defendants regarding completion of the building and
making necessary payments thereafter.
Since the
progress of the construction of the building was not
satisfactory, the plaintiff though made substantial
payment towards the sale consideration was constrained
to stop the payment of further installments.”
17.

The afore-noted paras of the plaint (particularly the

underlined portion) show that the suit of the plaintiff is based on the
premise that the defendant failed to perform its part of obligation
page 9 of 12

under the agreement by not constructing the flat in a satisfactory
manner. It therefore cannot be said that the plea relating to the
status of construction of the flat was not raised in the plaint and for
the first time introduced in the testimony of PW-1. Further, in the
plaint averments have been made about some payments made in
cash.
18.

In so far as the certified copies of the Ledger Book of the

defendant, M/s Apex Apartments Pvt. Ltd is concerned, cause shown
by the petitioners for the delay in filing is that the said account
books were seized by the Delhi Police during the course of
investigation in another matter and are in the custody of the
concerned Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi since the year
1992.
19.

The petitioners were aware about the factum of seizure

and custody of the said documents by the Court of Metropolitan
Magistrate even at the time of filing of the written statement. Had
the petitioners been diligent, they would have obtained the certified
copy of the document and should have filed the same along with the
written statement itself.
20.

Therefore, the cause shown by the petitioners for the

delay in filing the said documents cannot be deemed to be a
'sufficient cause'.
21.

A party adduces its evidence in the light of pleadings and
page 10 of 12

documents filed by the other party. Serious prejudice may be
caused to the party which has led its evidence by allowing the
opposite party to file additional evidence thereafter.
22.

As noted in the decision in Nanjunda Setty's case (supra),

literacy levels being low in this country, courts have adopted a
liberal approach while considering a prayer to file additional
documents.
23.

But where litigating parties suffer no handicap of legal

awareness or inadequacy of legal knowledge issue has to be decided
accordingly.
24.

In the instant case, petitioner company is a company

incorporated under the Indian Companies Act. It has best lawyers at
its disposal. Petitioner company was conscious that the plaintiff has
raised a plea in the plaint relating to stage of construction. The fact
they are builders give them all the more awareness as to proof of
stage of construction.
25.

Falsification of record pertaining to constructions has

been noticed in number of judicial pronouncements.

It has also

been noted that false form C and form D are issued in respect of
buildings construction of

which are yet to be completed in all

respects. Forging of accounts by a company is also not uncommon.
26.

Had these documents filed at the initial stage by the

petitioners, plaintiff would have got an adequate opportunity to lead
page 11 of 12

the evidence keeping in view that the defence would be predicated
on proof of said documents.
27.

The suit was filed in the year 1997. We are in the year

2007. 10 years have gone by. If defendants i.e. petitioners have to
be granted an opportunity to file the documents, an opportunity
would also be required to be given to the plaintiff to file documents
and lead evidence. The suit would thus be relegated to the initial
stage i.e. stage immediately after issues are framed. Noting that the
suit is pending for 10 years, in my opinion it would be unfair to the
plaintiff to relegate the suit to the stage when issues are framed.
28.

The impugned order dated 05.08.05 thus does not suffer

from any infirmity.
29.

The petition is accordingly dismissed.

30.

No costs.
