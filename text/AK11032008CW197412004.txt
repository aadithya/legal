ANIL KUMAR, J.

1.

This is an application by the respondent/applicant under Section

17 B of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking direction to the petitioner
to pay the wages not less than the minimum wages from the date of the
award till the final disposal of the writ petition.

2.

The case of the respondent/applicant is that the application of

the petitioner under section 33 (2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 was dismissed by order dated 31st March, 2003 which is
impugned by the petitioner in the present writ petition. The operation of
CM No.14367/2005 in WP(C) 19741 of 2004

Page 1 of 9

the impugned order dated 31st March, 2003 was stayed by this Court by
order dated 11th January, 2005.

3.

The applicant has relied on Jaipur Zila Sahkari Bhoomi Vikas

Bank Limited Vs. Shri Ram Gopal Sharma, 2002(92) FLR 667, holding
that that once the application of the management for approval of its
action is dismissed by the Tribunal, the workman is deemed to be in the
service of the management and for that no separate order of
reinstatement is required.

4.

The applicant stated that he has not been employed in any

establishment anywhere for any period of time, after passing of the
impugned order dated 31st March, 2003 till date. Due to his
unemployment he is facing extreme hardships to support himself and
his family members and he is totally dependent upon his wife who is
doing all kinds of odd jobs to keep the family members surviving and he
has failed to ensure for himself and his family an existence worthy of
human dignity. The applicant stated that his last drawn wages were
Rs. 2593/- and current wages as fixed and revised from time to time
against the said post is Rs. 3600.00 approx. The applicant has also
undertaken to refund any amount which is given to him under section
17B beyond the wages last drawn if ordered by this Court. An affidavit
has also been filed by the respondent stating that at the time of
termination of his services he was drawing salary of Rs. 2593/- PM and
CM No.14367/2005 in WP(C) 19741 of 2004

Page 2 of 9

from the time of termination of his services he has not been employed in
any establishment.

5.

The application is contested by the petitioner alleging that the

impugned order is illegal and arbitrary and liable to be set aside. It is
pleaded by the petitioner that the impugned order was stayed by the
Order dated 11th January, 2005 which has not become final and
respondent is not entitled for reinstatement, nor can he be deemed to
be in service. The petitioner vehemently denied that workman is
unemployed after passing the impugned order till date. The petitioner
has contended that in the application it is stated that the applicant is
unemployed since the date of passing of impugned order, however, in
the affidavit it is deposed that the applicant is unemployed since the
date of termination of his services. The petitioner contended that it is
settled law, any payment made under section 17B at the rate of
minimum wages shall be made subject to furnishing of security towards
the differences in the minimum wages and the last drawn wages and
the said differences shall be refunded by the workman if the writ
petition

is

allowed.

The

petitioner

also

contended

that

if

the

management has challenged the award of the labour court, a workman
who has obtained direction for reinstatement in service is entitled to full
wages last drawn or full wages which would have been drawn under
Minimum Act whichever is higher, however,

directions for refund or

recovery in the event of the award being set aside should be made and it
CM No.14367/2005 in WP(C) 19741 of 2004

Page 3 of 9

would be open to the court to pass appropriate orders depending on the
facts of each case as to in what form restitution has to be secured. The
petitioner contended that the workman is not entitled for any relief as
prayed in the application.

6.

A full bench of this Court in (2005) III- LLJ Delhi 390 in the

matter of Delhi Transport Corporation Vs Jagdish Chander had held
that the provision of section 17 B of the Act will be applicable to the writ
petition filed against the order passed on the application of the
management under section 33 (2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947. Referring to various decisions, the full Court had held that the
emphasis of the legislature in Section 17B was on the expression
`reinstatement’ rather than on award and cumulative effect of Sections
2(b) and 2(k) defining award and `industrial dispute’ demonstrated that
the expressions has been widely worded to take within their ambit
duties relatable to any person who satisfied the conditions stated
therein. Consequently the plea of the petitioner that the provision of
section 17B are not available to the respondent since there is no award,
is not sustainable and is rejected holding that the respondent is entitled
for the benefit of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
provided he is unemployed.

Granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing orders

directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule; refusing to grant
relief under Section 17B is an exception, as it could be passed only in the
rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional error where there is no relationship
between the parties. In the present case the this has not been disputed that
there is relationship of employee and employer between the petitioner and the
applicant While considering an application under this provision it is necessary
to bear in mind that the spirit, intendment and object underlying the statutory
provision of Section 17B, is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the
hardship resulting to a workman due to delay in the implementation of the
consequence of dismissal of the application of the petitioner resulting into
reinstatement of his services on account of the challenge made to it by the
employer. The preliminary consideration for making available such a relief to a
workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment. It
recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep body and soul
together when a challenge has been made to the order passed by the Labor
Court. The statutory provisions provide no inherent right of assailing an order
or an award by an industrial adjudicator by way of an appeal. The payment
which is required to be made by the employer to the workman has been held
to be akin to a subsistence allowance which is neither refundable nor
recoverable from a workman even if the petitioner is allowed by the the High
Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the
Apex Court was of the view that the object under Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the hardship that is
caused to the workman due to the delay in implementation of the Award. The
practice of disposal of the petition as well as the application under Section
CM No.14367/2005 in WP(C) 19741 of 2004

Page 5 of 9

17B of the Act contemporaneously was deprecated and the High Court was
directed to first expeditiously dispose of the application under Section 17B by
the Supreme Court by its decision reported at VII (2000) SLT 70=JT 2000 (8)
SC 501, Workmen Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Hindustan
Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. & Ors.

8.

Since the section itself mentions ‘employment in establishment’

self employment quite apparently is not in contemplation. Workman
can be denied the benefits under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes
Act only when it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the
workmen have been employed and have been receiving adequate
remuneration during the period of pendency of the writ petition. It is
thus well settled that transient employment by the workman does not
affect his entitlement to receive wages pending decision; that is to say
that, the benefit of Section 17B of the Act cannot be denied merely
because the workman is engaged in some activity or in some vocation to
eke out his livelihood. Such relief can be denied only if it is proved that
the workman is gainfully employed in some establishment and is
receiving adequate and regular remuneration which is not the case with
the applicant. In the present case the petitioner has not been able to
show that the workman is gainfully employed in any establishment and
the respondent no.1 has contended on affidavit that he is unemployed
since the date of his dismissal from the service.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 entitled Town Municipal, Athani v.
P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman has
a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot
be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act for
enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was concerned with
the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the Court would have a
bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well. From a
conspectus of the authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court, the
right of a workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified under
the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the
constitutional mandate and nothing more. It is undoubtedly, the bare
minimum which is required by the workman to subsist and is nothing
more. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean all the wages that
have fallen due at least from the date of the order of the Labor Court
dismissing the application of the management under Section 33 (2) (b)
of the Act.

10.

In the present case the workman has categorically averred in the

application that he has been unemployed since the date of the dismissal
of the application of the petitioner under section 33 (2) (b) of the Act till
date and even from the date of termination of his services. The
CM No.14367/2005 in WP(C) 19741 of 2004

Page 7 of 9

petitioner has not been able to show that the applicant is gainfully
employed so as not entitled for benefit under section 17 B of the Act.
The applicant has also stated that he will undertake to refund any
amount paid over and above the last drawn wages in case the writ
petition is allowed. In the circumstances, the applicant fulfills the
requirement of Section 17 B of the Act so as to be entitled for last drawn
wages or minimum wages whichever is higher during the pendency of
the present writ petition.

11.

For

the

foregoing

reasons,

the

application

of

the

workman/respondent under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 is allowed and the petitioner is directed to pay the arrears of last
drawn wages or the minimum wages, whichever is higher, from 31st
October, 2003. Arrears be paid within eight weeks. The petitioner shall
continue to pay last drawn wages or the minimum wages, whichever is
higher, by 15th of every English calendar month. The respondent is also
directed to give an undertaking that in case the writ petition is allowed,
the difference in last drawn wages and the minimum wages shall be
repaid/refunded by the respondent/workman within such time as may
be permitted by this Court. The undertaking by the applicant be filed
within four weeks.

With these directions, the application is disposed of.
