1.

By way of this writ petition, the petitioner has prayed that the

petitioner be granted alternative allotment of plot and that the closure of the file
by virtue of the letter dated 27.02.1992 in respect of her application for
alternative plot be set aside.

2.

The petitioner states that land to the extent of 15 bighas, 3 biswas,

belonging to the petitioner situate in the revenue estate of village Karawal
Nagar was acquired under Award No.16/83-84. Thereafter under the prevalent
scheme, the petitioner applied for allotment of an alternative plot. It is stated
WP(C)1515/07

Page No.1 of 3

by the learned counsel for the petitioner that this application was made in 1983
and the petitioner being an illiterate widow residing in a village was unaware of
the procedure to be followed with regard to the allotment of alternative plots.
She waited all this while and expected that an allotment letter would be issued
to her.

Since the same was not the case, on 18.05.2005, she made an

application to the Joint Secretary, Land and Building Department indicating
that her case be processed and that a long time had elapsed since she had
moved the application for alternative plot, but no response was received by her.
On 16.06.2005, an application was also moved by her under the Delhi Right to
Information Act to enquire about the status of her application for allotment of
an alternative plot. By a letter dated 18.07.2005, the competent authority under
the said Act informed her that, as conveyed to her vide letter
No.F.30(39)/41/89/L&B/Alt./7311 dated 27.02.92, her case had been closed for
want of documents. A copy of the letter dated 27.02.1992 was also enclosed
with this letter of 18.07.2005.

A reading of the letter dated 27.02.1992

indicates that the petitioner, in spite of repeated letters from the office had not
submitted the documents / information and it is in the absence of such
information that it was not possible to recommend her case for allotment of an
alternative plot in lieu of the land acquired. By virtue of this letter, she was
informed that her case had been closed. It is the case of the petitioner that the
said letter of 1992 was not received by the petitioner in 1992 and only a copy
was received by the petitioner alongwith the letter of competent authority in
WP(C)1515/07

2005, as mentioned above.

3.

Be that as it may, the fact remains that the petitioner had moved an

application in 1983 and had not bothered to enquire about the same till 2005.
There is nothing to indicate that the petitioner was at all interested in the
allotment of the land during these 18 years. The courts help citizens who are
vigilant and not those who sleep over their rights.

Eighteen years of

unexplained delay and thereafter two years of further delay in approaching this
court would definitely fall within the expression “laches”. It is on this ground
that this writ petition is dismissed.
