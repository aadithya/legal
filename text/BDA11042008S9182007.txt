IA No. 164/2008 (u/O 12 R 6 CPC)
1.

This application has been filed by the plaintiff seeking a

decree of possession on the basis of admissions made by the defendant in
the written statement. The plaintiff's case is that the suit property —
Villa -1B, Empire Estate situated at Mehrauli Gurgaon Road, Sultan Pur,
New Delhi —

was let out to the defendant for the first time on

IA No. 164/2008 & CS (OS) 918/2007

Page No.1 of 6

01.10.2001 for a period of 12 months. However, that was done on the
basis of a lease deed which was unregistered and improperly stamped.
The tenancy of the defendant was continued from time to time and it was
last renewed by virtue of another similar lease deed which was
unregistered and unstamped and which was dated 01.10.2003. That lease
was also for a period of two years. It was also averred that the last rent
paid by the defendant was for the month of May, 2006 and it was in the
sum of Rs 1,10,000/-.

2.

It is the case of the plaintiff that the leases that were entered

into between the parties, being unregistered and improperly stamped,
would have to be disregarded and consequently the tenancy of the
defendant was a month to month tenancy which could be terminated by
issuance of a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882. It is contended by the learned counsel that such a notice was
issued on 19.02.2007 which was sent by registered post. He submitted
that the receipt of this notice is admitted by the defendant inasmuch as
subsequent to the filing of the suit, a reply also has been sent to this
notice by the defendant. However, because the defendant was lodged in
jail at that point of time (and he continues to be in jail even today), the

IA No. 164/2008 & CS (OS) 918/2007

Page No.2 of 6

plaintiff for better safety issued a second notice dated 09.04.2007 to the
defendant through the Jail Superintendent, Tihar Jail, New Delhi. The
learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that this notice was also
received by the defendant. By virtue of the notice dated 19.02.2007 the
plaintiff had given 15 days clear notice requiring the defendant to vacate
the premises by the end of 31.03.2007. The second notice required the
handing over of possession by the end of 30.04.2007.

3.

Since the defendant' did not vacate the premises despite such

notices, the plaintiff was constrained to file the present suit for
possession as well as for damages and mesne profits inasmuch as the
defendant had not paid any rent or any sum whatsoever for occupation of
the said premises after May, 2006.

4.

The learned counsel for the defendant submitted that although

the relationship of landlord and tenant is not denied between the plaintiff
and the defendant, there was an oral understanding that the defendant be
allowed to occupy the premises without payment of rent.

He also

submitted that though there is no denial of receipt of the two notices, the
said notices were illegal. He submitted that had the first notice been

IA No. 164/2008 & CS (OS) 918/2007

Page No.3 of 6

legal, what was the necessity of sending the second notice. He also
submitted that since the defendant was in jail since August, 2006 and his
financial assets had been frozen by the CBI, the defendant could not
make any payment for occupation of the said premises to the plaintiff.
He submitted that there was sufficient dispute raised by the defendant
and, therefore, the suit required to proceed to trial and could not be
decided on the basis of this application.

5.

From the pleadings and the submissions made by the counsel

for the parties, it is clear that the plaintiff let out the premises in question
to the defendant. It is also clear that there was no registered lease deed in
respect of the said premises. Consequently, the tenancy was a month to
month tenancy. The same could be terminated by the plaintiff by issuing
a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. Such a notice
was sent on 19.02.2007. The receipt of the same is not denied.

The

second notice dated 09.04.2007 was only sent by way of abundant
caution inasmuch as the defendant was lodged in jail at that point of time
and the plaintiff was advised to send a notice to the defendant through
the Jail Superintendent so that later on the defendant could not raise the
objection that the notice was not served at the correct address. The

IA No. 164/2008 & CS (OS) 918/2007

Page No.4 of 6

arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the defendant that there
was an oral understanding that the defendant could occupy the said
premises without payment of rent does not inspire any confidence. It is
only a sham defence which the defendant seeks to raise particularly
because the defendant has admitted the tenancy.

There can be no

tenancy without payment of rent. The other argument of the defendant
that what was the need for issuing the two notices if the notices were
legal, is also without substance. This is because if the first notice was
valid then the second notice is merely an additional notice and can be
disregarded. On the other hand, if the first notice was invalid, nothing
has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the defendant which
would go to show that the second notice was in any way illegal or
invalid. Whichever way the matter is looked at, the position is this that
the plaintiff inducted the defendant into the said premises as a month to
month tenant. By virtue of the notice dated 19.02.2007 the tenancy was
terminated by giving more than 15 days to the defendant to vacate. Since
the defendant did not vacate, the plaintiff was clearly entitled to file the
present suit for possession.

In view of the admitted position and

admitted facts, the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment in respect of prayer
(i) of the plaint. Consequently, the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of

IA No. 164/2008 & CS (OS) 918/2007

possession in respect of the suit premises. It is ordered accordingly.
This application stands disposed of.
