V.B. GUPTA, J.
The Appellant has filed the present appeal against the
impugned judgment dated 10th May, 1996, passed by Shri
Rakesh Kapoor, Judge, MACT vide which the learned Tribunal
awarded a sum of Rs. 1,65,000/- as compensation to the
Appellant and also awarded 12% per annum interest on the
awarded amount from the date of filing of the petition till
realisation.
2.

By

way

of

present

appeal,

appellant

wants

compensation amount to be enhanced to Rs. 3,00,000/- as
claimed by him in the petition.
3.

Brief facts of this case are that on 1st July, 1988, at

about 8.40 a.m. the appellant was standing in front of shop
No. F-755, M/S. Khurana Provision Store, Ganesh Nagar,
Delhi. In the meanwhile, Car No. DEA-5394 came from the
side of Patparganj railway crossing being driven rashly,
negligently and at a high speed.

Respondent No. 1, the

driver of the car, instead of driving the car on its correct
side, swerved the car towards the extreme right corner of
the road and knocked down the appellant who was standing
FAO No. 242/1997

Page No. 2 of 11

in front of the aforesaid shop.

The appellant sustained

grievous injuries on leg and abrasions on all parts of the
body which later on turned into permanent disability
resulting in amputation of the right leg.

Appellant filed

claim petition claiming compensation of Rs. 3,00,000/-.
4.

Respondent No. 1 driver of the car, admitted the

factum of accident but took the plea that the appellant
might have fallen on the road due to his own negligence and
might have been hit by another vehicle.
5.

Respondent No. 3, the Insurance Company, admitted

that the vehicle in question was insured with it at the time of
the accident but stated that the compensation claimed was
exorbitant and excessive.
6.

impugned

judgment,

the

learned

awarded compensation of Rs.1,65,000/-, as follows:(i) On account of loss of salary -------- Rs. 15,000.00

7.

In appeal, respondent No. 1, the driver of said vehicle

was served by publication as well as by affixation.
Respondent No. 2 Parveen Jain, the owner of the car was
present in person on 1st December, 1997 and sought time
for engaging the counsel.

Thereafter, he absented and

respondent No. 3 (Insurance Company) was served for 1st
December, 1997 but none appeared on behalf of the
respondent.
8.

On 20th September, 1999 counsel for the appellant was

present but none appeared for respondents and accordingly,
the appeal was admitted for hearing.
9.

On 2nd February, 2007 none was present and the

matter was renotified for 5th February, 2007.
10.

On 5th February, 2007, counsel for the appellant was

present but none appeared on behalf of the respondents
and as such arguments advanced by learned counsel for the
appellant have been heard.
11.

It has been argued by learned counsel for the

appellant that the learned Tribunal has assumed the income
of the appellant at the time of the accident as Rs. 1,000/-

FAO No. 242/1997

Page No. 4 of 11

only, whereas the appellant in his evidence has stated that
he is earning Rs. 4,000/- to 5,000/- per month. Though, the
appellant could not give any documentary proof about his
income but the learned Tribunal ought to have assessed his
income on the basis of minimum wages payable under the
Minimum Wages Act.
12.

The learned Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 25,000/-

only, towards pain and agony without considering the agony
of the appellant that his whole life has been crippled and his
movement shall be restricted.

Further, nobody would like

to have marry such like person. No amount was awarded
towards the servant which the appellant had engaged to
look after himself.

So, keeping in view the loss of future

prospects, extra expenses to be incurred in the future
throughout the life towards conveyance, medicines and
treatment etc, the appellant is entitled to a sum of Rs.
3,00,000/- as compensation.
13.

First point which arises for consideration is as to what

was the income of the appellant at the time of the accident.
As per averments made in the petition, It is stated that the
appellant was wholesale cloth merchant and was self
FAO No. 242/1997

Page No. 5 of 11

employed and his monthly income was Rs. 2,000/-. In his
evidence, appellant stated that he used to earn about Rs.
4,000/- to 5,000/- and out of which he could save Rs. 2,000/to 2,500/- for his household expenses.
14.

It is well settled that no evidence led beyond pleading

can be looked into. Here, the case of appellant is that he
was earning Rs. 2,000/- when the present petition was filed.
However, at the time of evidence in the Court, appellant
states that he used to earn about 4000/- to 5000/-. So, this
statement with regard to the income is beyond his own
pleading and cannot be looked into. With regard to income
of Rs.2,000/- per month, appellant has not placed any
document to show that he was actually running a business
of cloth merchant and was earning that amount. Document
Exhibit PW 4/1 relied upon by the appellant shows that M/s
Harbans Lal Brij Mohan was a member of the waste cloth
merchant association. It does not state that this firm was
doing business of wholesale cloth merchant. No Books of
Accounts have been produced on record to show the income
of the said firm.
15.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

FAO No. 242/1997

Page No. 6 of 11

appellant that learned Tribunal ought to have taken
minimum wages into consideration while fixing the income
of the appellant.
16.

As per Minimum Wages Act, in 1988, Minimum wage

prescribed for an unskilled worker was Rs. 562/- while for
semi skilled it was Rs. 635/- and for skilled it was Rs. 749/per month. For matriculate, the minimum wages prescribed
were Rs. 760/-.
17.

The appellant has not mentioned in the petition about

the nature of his job whether it was skilled or unskilled. In
any case, it has to be presumed that appellant was earning
less than Rs. 1,000/- per month.
18.

The learned Tribunal was quite liberal in assessing

the income of appellant at Rs. 1,000/- per month. So, the
appellant cannot have any grievance on this count.
19.

Since, appellant was only 22 years at the time of

accident and has suffered permanent disability of more
than 50%, so applying maximum multiplier of 16 as laid
down by the Apex Court in General Manager, Kerala
State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Mrs. Susama
Thomas and others 1994 ACJ 1, the Tribunal rightly
FAO No. 242/1997

Page No. 7 of 11

awarded a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- as compensation on this
ground.
20.

The appellant was admitted in the hospital on

1.7.1988 and was discharged on 1.9.1988.

The disability

certificate was issued on 6.12.1988. and there is nothing on
record to show that the appellant was again treated for
injuries. As such appellant must have remained out of job
only for a period of one year or so and the Tribunal
awarded him compensation of Rs. 15,000/- on account of
loss of income, which is quite reasonable.
21.

In his statement, appellant stated that he has spent

Rs. 50,000/- on medicines and some of the bills have been
lost and Exhibits PW 4/2-65, Bills amounting to Rs.
7756.65p have been proved. The learned Tribunal awarded
a sum of Rs. 15,000/- on account of purchase of medicines.
This amount awarded by the learned Tribunal is quite
reasonable keeping in view the fact that the appellant could
prove bills worth Rs. 7,700/-only.
22.

On account of pain and agony, Tribunal has granted

Rs. 25,000/-, which is also quite reasonable.
23.

With regard to special diet, appellant in his statement

FAO No. 242/1997

Page No. 8 of 11

has stated that the doctor has prescribed a special diet for
him costing about Rs. 50 per day for two years.

The

learned Tribunal has awarded a sum of RS. 10,000/- on this
account which is also reasonable.
24.

With regard to the plea taken up by learned counsel

for the appellant that Tribunal has not considered the fact
that appellant had engaged a servant namely Ram Singh
for two years during the illness and was paying him Rs. 500
per month.

The best evidence to this effect would have

been that the servant, but the appellant did not produce
nor summoned him as witness for reasons best known to
him and as such appellant is not entitled to claim any
compensation on this ground.
25.

Another

contention

of

learned

counsel

for

the

appellant is that due to this accident, marriage prospects of
the

appellant

had

also

been

diminished

and

no

compensation on this account has been awarded.
26.

It is correct that no compensation has been awarded

to the appellant on this account, though appellant in his
statement has stated that he is unmarried and nobody
would marry him and he is unfit for his family life.
FAO No. 242/1997

Page No. 9 of 11

27.

During the course of arguments, it was inquired from

learned counsel for the appellant as to whether the
appellant has married or not.

The appellant's counsel

replied that she is not aware about it. Nevertheless, it is a
case of permanent disability and in such cases, it is not
possible to get suitable and desired match and marriage
prospects get certainly diminished.

On this account,

appellant is entitled for suitable compensation. Hence, it
would be fair enough to award a sum of Rs. 25,000/- as
compensation on this count keeping in view the age and
financial status of the appellant.
28.

Accordingly, it is held that compensation amount of

Rs. 1,65,000/- awarded in this case is quite just and
reasonable. However, in addition to this, appellant is also
entitled for compensation amounting to Rs. 25,000/- on
account of loss of marriage prospect.
29.

Respondents are directed to deposit this additional

sum of Rs. 25,000/- with the Trial court within one month
from today, failing which they shall be liable to pay interest
@ 6% per annum from today till realisation. Accordingly,
present appeal stands disposed of.
