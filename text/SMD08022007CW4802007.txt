ORDER
: Dr. S. Muralidhar, J. (open court)

1.

This writ petition is by a person operating a kiosk in Mayur

Vihar Phase – I, selling fruit juice pursuant to a valid licence issued to
him by the respondent Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). Earlier
the petitioner had been operating a kiosk near the Madhuban Chowk,
opposite Bank of India and in June 2003, the MCD required him to
abandon the said kiosk and shift location to Mayur Vihar, Phase-I by
an order dated 2.6.2003.

2.

Thereafter when the said permission was sought to be revoked

without any notice to the petitioner, it required the intervention of this
Court by means of an order dated 10.9.2003 in WP(C) No. 4629/2003

WP(C) 480/2007

page no 1 of 8

to quash the revocation for being in violation of the principles of
natural justice. Then, a letter dated 3.2.2004 was issued to him
confirming a kiosk at the new site. Again, when the petitioner found
that he could not set up his kiosk at the new place, he had to once
again approach this Court which by an order dated 1.3.2004 in W.P.
(C) No. 7324/2003 directed the MCD to implement “all the obligations
contained in their letter dated 3.2.2004.” Ultimately, the possession of
the said kiosk was handed over to the petitioner on 22.4.2004. Since
then he has been selling fruit juice from the said kiosk at Mayur Vihar
Phase I.

3.

On 5.12.2006, the petitioner deposited the licence fee of

Rs.21,000/-,

and

on 10.1.2007 and his licence was renewed for a

period of five years from 7.12.2005 to 6.12.2010. This was done by
the following letter addressed to him by the Administrative Officer,
Shahdara Zone, MCD:-

“No. 56/AO/SHJ/2007

Dated: 10.1.07

To

Shri Satish Malik,
C-444, Nirman Vihar,

It is the case of the petitioner that within less than 24 hours

after this renewal of license, a team of officials of the MCD came to
the site of his kiosk at Mayur Vihar on 11.1.2007, stopped petitioner's
business and sealed the kiosk. They did not offer him any reasons for
doing

so.

His

letter

dated

12.1.2007

to

the

MCD

remained

unanswered. The petitioner then approached this Court by filing this
petition on 18.1.2007 questioning the sealing of his kiosk and
stoppage of his business.

5.

Notice was issued in the writ petition on 19.1.2007 and the an

interim order was passed permitting the petitioner to remove the
stock of fresh fruits in the shop. Today reply affidavit dated 2.2.2007
has been tendered by Mr. Sanjeev Sabharwal on behalf of the MCD.
The above facts are not denied except saying that the petitioner did
not comply with the condition of the grant of the alternate kiosk to the
effect that he would demolish his earlier kiosk at Madhuban. It is now
contended that the petitioner violated the conditions on which he was
allotted the kiosk at Mayur Vihar and that he was found encroaching
on government land. The fact of the renewal of the licence on 10.1.07

WP(C) 480/2007

page no 3 of 8

is stated to be a “matter of record so no reply is required.” Therefore,
it is not denied that the letter dated 10.1.2007 was indeed issued to
the petitioner renewing his licence for the kiosk at Mayur Vihar for
five years till 2010.

6.

The reason for the sealing of the kiosk is contained in para 6

where it is stated that “during the inspection, Monitoring Committee
appointed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court found a lots of public land
encroached by the petitioner in the form of juice counter. The kiosk
of the petitioner was sealed on the directions of Monitoring
Committee.” In response to a query of the Court as to when this
inspection took place by the Monitoring Committee and what order
was made by the Monitoring Committee in respect of the petitioner's
kiosk, Mr. Sabharwal refers to an instruction dated 2.2.2007 issued by
the MCD, a copy of which has been placed along with the affidavit.
The said instruction dated 2.2.2007 reads as under:-

“INSTRUCTIONS OF MONITORING COMMITTEE
– SUPREME COURT

Supreme
Committee

has

Court's

constituted

observed

that

no

Monitoring
commercial

establishment, which have come up on encroached
government land shall be recommended for desealing, except temporary de-sealing for a specific
reason.

All the Deputy Commissioners of Zone are
directed to take cognizance of these instructions of
Monitoring Committee and act accordingly.

Sd/ADDL. COMMISSIONER [ENGG.]”

WP(C) 480/2007

page no 4 of 8

7.

A bare perusal of the above instructions shows that it merely

reproduces an observation by the Monitoring Committee that “no
commercial establishment, which have come up on encroached
Government land shall be recommended for de-sealing, except
temporary de-sealing for a specific reason.” It is incredible that an
instruction of 2.2.2007 is sought to be relied upon to justify an action
taken on 11.1.2007. Be that as it may, there is nothing in this
document which indicates anything specific to the petitioner’s kiosk.
The above instructions are of a general nature. In any event the
instruction pertains to de-sealing and not for sealing of commercial
establishments for which obviously some factual foundation would
have to be laid by the MCD before proceeding to seal the premises
which is stated to be encroaching on government land.

8.

Even MCD’s affidavit does not indicate when the inspection of

petitioner's premises took place and when the Monitoring Committee
found that petitioner's kiosk was encroaching upon government land.
When asked whether there is any order passed by the Monitoring
Committee, Mr. Sabharwal, on instructions from the Administrative
Officer, Shahdara Zone who is present in the Court informs that the
sealing in the instant case took place on “verbal instructions” of the
Monitoring Committee.

This is indeed strange considering that

administrative action is expected to be taken on the basis of written
orders which would indicated that relevant materials have been taken
into consideration for arriving at a decision.

9.

It is all the more incredible that all this should have transpired

between 10.1.2007 when the licence was renewed and 11.1.2007

WP(C) 480/2007

page no 5 of 8

when the sealing took place. Otherwise, it is inexplicable that despite
the petitioner not conforming to the terms on which he was allotted
the kiosk at Mayur Vihar, and despite his encroaching on government
land, his licence was renewed on 10.1.2007 for five years with effect
from 2005.

10.

Mr. Sabharwal also does not deny that in the instant case, no

show cause notice was ever issued to the petitioner prior to the
sealing which took place on 11.1.2007.

It was never put to the

petitioner that he had violated the conditions of the grant of the kiosk,
that he had encroached upon the Government land and that on that
account this his premises were required to be sealed. Mr. Sabharwal
also does not dispute the fact that on 10.1.2007, the petitioner's
license for running the kiosk had been renewed by the MCD for a
period of five years.

11.

In light of the above undeniable facts, it is clear view of sealing

of the petitioner's kiosk is arbitrary and totally indefensible and
impermissible in law.

The MCD cannot act unilaterally on its own

perception of what constitutes encroachment without there being
some basic factual material. In a case, as the instant one, where a
person is operating a kiosk on the strength of a valid licence issued by
the MCD, which has not expired, no precipitate action can be taken by
the MCD to cancel such licence except in accordance with procedure
established by law. The procedure has been set out in the MCD Act
and the Rules which have to be adhered to. The basic requirement
would be a show cause notice to the licencee which will set out the
circumstances, and the facts gathered against the licencee and afford
him an opportunity of explaining those circumstances and facts. This

WP(C) 480/2007

page no 6 of 8

is a pre-condition to either cancelling such license. The sealing of the
premises where the licensed activity is carried on can only follow as a
consequence of this procedure culminating in a reasoned order that
the licence conditions have been violated. The Court does not expect
that an action of sealing or de-sealing or any action pursuant to orders
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court would be taken pursuant to “verbal
instructions” without there being any written order which is passed on
the material available on record which has been gathered by
observations on the ground.

This is a basic protection for any

licencee faced with the extreme step of sealing of the premises where
the licenced activity is being carried on.

12.

If the MCD intends to take any action in future on the basis that

the petitioner has violated the conditions of the license or has
encroached the government land, it should issue an appropriate show
cause notice to the petitioner confronting him with the material
gathered against him and offer him an opportunity of explaining the
circumstances against him before taking any precipitate adverse
action. It will have to abide by the MCD Act and the Rules thereunder
in this regard. This is being specifically directed in the light of the fact
that the petitioner had already approached this Court on two previous
occasions as noticed hereinbefore.
13.

The writ petition is allowed with costs of Rs.5,000/- which will

be paid by the MCD to the petitioner within four weeks. The MCD
will ensure that the petitioner’s kiosk at Mayur Vihar is de-sealed
within 48 hours and in any event not later than 4 pm on 10.2.2007.

A copy of this order be given dasti under the signature of the Court
Master.
