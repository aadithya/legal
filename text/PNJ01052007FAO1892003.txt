PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

On 13.8.93, deceased, Vijay Lakshmi Gupta, died in a

road accident involving bus bearing no. DL-IP-4469. She was
survived by a son aged 28 years and a daughter. Both the
children were married as on the date of the accident.
2.

They filed a claim petition under Section 140 read with

Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 claiming a
compensation of Rs. 12 lakhs on account of death of the deceased
in the said road accident.
3.

After holding driver of the offending bus guilty of rash

and negligent driving, learned Tribunal awarded compensation in
sum of Rs.1,30,000/-.

FAO No.189/2003

page 1 of 6

4.

It was stated in the claim petition that deceased was a

property dealer and that she was earning Rs.3,000/- p.m. at the
time of the accident. It was further stated that the deceased was
residing with his son and used to contribute major portion of her
earnings towards household expenses.
5.

Considering that the son of the deceased was himself

earning Rs.2,500/- p.m. and that the daughter of the deceased
was also married at the time of the accident, learned Tribunal has
determined the loss of dependence at Rs.1,000/- p.m.
6.

Noting that the deceased was aged 43 years at the

time of the accident, multiplier of 10 has been applied by the
Tribunal.
7.

Thus, total loss of dependence is determined at

Rs.1,20,000/- (Rs.1,000/- X 12 X 10 = Rs.1,20,000/-)
8.

Adding thereto, a sum of Rs.5,000/- for funeral

expenses and Rs.5,000/- for loss of estate, total compensation is
determined at Rs.1,30,000/-.
9.

Aggrieved by the compensation awarded by the

Tribunal, children of the deceased (claimants/appellants) have
filed the present appeal praying for the enhancement of
compensation.
10.

Learned counsel contended that in view of the fact that

the deceased was residing with her son and that she used to
contribute major portion of her earnings (Rs.3,000/- p.m.) towards
household

expenses,

loss

of

dependence

determined

at

Rs.1,000/- p.m. by the Tribunal is on the lower side. He has cited

FAO No.189/2003

page 2 of 6

several decisions in support of his contention. I shall deal with
them at a later stage.
11.

Before proceeding with the issue of compensation, I

note one patent error committed by the Tribunal while evaluating
the evidence.
12.

In the claim petition, age of the deceased is stated as

45 years. While, the son of the deceased in his testimony as PW-1
had deposed that the deceased was aged 42-43 years at the time
of the accident.
13.

Relying upon the testimony of son of the deceased,

Tribunal has taken the age of deceased at the time of the
accident as 43 years.
14.

In view of inconsistency in the averments made in

claim petition and testimony of the son of the deceased, Tribunal
has erred in determining the age of the deceased at the time of
the accident on the basis of the testimony of the son of the
deceased.
15.

Considering that the son of the deceased (eldest child

of the deceased) was aged 28 years at the time of the accident, it
could reasonably be assumed that deceased must have been
aged at least 47 years at the time of the accident. I take age of
the deceased as 47 years.
16.

On the issue of the earning of the deceased, it is to be

noted that in the claim petition, earnings of the deceased at the
time of the accident is stated as Rs.3,000/- p.m. While, the son of
the deceased in his testimony as PW-1 had deposed that the

FAO No.189/2003

page 3 of 6

deceased was earning about Rs.6,000/- to Rs.7,000/- p.m. at the
time of the accident.
17.

The Tribunal has taken income of the deceased as

Rs.3,000/- p.m. Correctly so. There is no proof that deceased was
earning Rs.6000/- to Rs.7000/- per month.
18.

While determining the loss of dependence, Tribunal

has rightly ignored the prospects of future increase in the income
of the deceased for the reason business of property dealer is a
speculative business and thus there can be no estimation
regarding the future prospects. Further there is no evidence of the
past.
19.

What would be the percentage of deduction for

personal expenditure cannot be governed by any rigid rule or
formula

by

universal

application.

It

would

depend

upon

circumstances of each case.
20.

In the instant case, considering that the deceased was

aged 47 years, both her children were married and the fact that
she was self employed which means that she would have also
spent a portion of her income for business related expenses,
Tribunal has rightly deducted 2/3rd of her income towards personal
expenditure.
21.

Thus,

Tribunal

has

rightly

determined

loss

of

dependence at Rs.1,000/- p.m.
22.

The

object

and

purpose

of

awarding

pecuniary

compensation is to determine the pecuniary loss suffered by the
dependent/claimants as a result of the death of the deceased.
Compensation is determined by balancing the loss suffered by the
FAO No.189/2003

page 4 of 6

dependents of the future pecuniary benefit because of the death
of the deceased and any other pecuniary advantage gained by
the dependents by the death. What is payable is the actual
pecuniary loss suffered by the dependents due to the death.
23.

In the instant case, it is an admitted fact that son of

the deceased was aged 28 years, married and was earning
Rs.2,500/- p.m. at the time of the accident. No evidence was led
to show that the deceased was contributing major portion of her
earnings for running the household. The daughter of the deceased
was also married at the time of the accident.
24.

Thus, the children cannot be considered as dependents

of the deceased. At best, they can be considered as beneficiary of
the estate of the deceased.
25.

Be that as it may, Tribunal has awarded loss of

dependence to the appellants.

Since there are no cross

objections, I do not interfere with the award.
26.

Learned counsel for the appellants has cited following

decisions in support of his contention:(i)
Union of India Vs. Jhansi Ram 1992 ACJ 665. In the
said case, a woman expired in a rail accident. Claim for damages
was filed by the husband of the deceased who was also an
earning member and the kitchen was maintained by the common
pool of the income of both husband and wife. It was held that the
legal representatives, i.e. the husband who was partially
dependent on the income of the deceased was entitled for
compensation as the household expenses were run by the joint
contribution of the husband and wife.
(ii)
Chol Roadways Corporation Vs. Pabunraj & Ors. 2000
ACJ 616. In this case it was held that the married son of the
deceased from his first wife living separately from the deceased
but dependent upon him is entitled to compensation.
(iii) Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Raman Bhai &
Prabhat Bhai 1987 ACJ, 561 Supreme Court has held that in
FAO No.189/2003

page 5 of 6

Indian family, brothers, sisters, brother's children and sometimes
foster children live together and they are dependent upon the
bread winner of the family and if the bread winner is killed in an
accident, there is no justification to deny them compensation.
(iv) Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board Vs. Ram Mohan Srivastava
1998 ACJ 651 It was held that where the household expenses is
run by the common pool of the husband and wife then the
husband and daughter are entitled to claim compensation
regarding the contribution towards the household expenses.
27.

None of the aforenoted decisions help the case of the

appellants.

All decisions are on an issue of entitlement of

compensation and not on quantum of compensation.
28.

I fail to understand the relevancy of aforenoted decisions for

the reason Tribunal has awarded compensation for loss of
dependence to the children of the deceased.
29.

No ground for enhancement is made out.

30.

Appeal is dismissed.

31.

No costs.

32.

LCR be returned.
