Notices were issued to the Regional Director (Northern

Region) vide order dated 15.01.2008. The report has also been filed by
Shri Dhan Raj, Regional Director (Northern Region) by an affidavit,
dated 22nd February 2008. The R.D has drawn the attention of this
court towards the report of the chairperson wherein it is stated that in
the meeting of the equity shareholders and the meeting of the
unsecured creditors, there were 12 and 4 votes respectively, that were
casted against the approval of the scheme of arrangement and
another objection which is raised is that the shares of the transferor
company are listed with NSE and BSE and their consent is received
but subject to certain conditions. With regard to the first issue raised
by the Regional Director the reports of the respective chairpersons of
the meetings of the equity shareholders and the unsecured creditors,
CP No.16 of 2008

Page 6 of 7

states that the scheme was approved by more than 99% of the total
value of the shareholding and unsecured debt of

shareholders and

unsecured creditors present and voting, thus this observation does not
come in the way of the sanctioning of the scheme of arrangement. So
far as the second issue is concerned, an affidavit by one Mr. Shiv Jatia,
Managing Director of the petitioner company, has been filed on record
stating that petitioner company undertakes to comply with the
conditions as laid down by the BSE and NSE. In view of the aforesaid,
this observation raised by the Regional Director does not survive.
