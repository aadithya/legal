Relevant facts as emanating

from the FIR

which was registered on a complaint by the father of
Zulfikar @ Zulfi and

Nazakat, deceased

on 1st

August, 2006 are that on 31st July, 2006 Zulfikar @

and Nazakat appeared as accused before a

Vs.

Nafis

-

under

Sections

147/

148/149/302/394 IPC PS Pilkhuwa. At about 2.30
PM the case was adjourned to 18th August, 2006. On
Zulfikar @ Zulfi and Nazakat coming out of the court
room,

Irfan and Jamshed Ali met

them

there at

Collectorate. While four of them were talking to each
other, co-accused Constable Ashok, accompanied by
¾ police officials of Delhi Police came over there.
They talked to Zulfikar @ Zulfi and Nazakat for a
while and then took them along saying that further
Bail Application No.4561/2006

Page 2 of 11

talks could be held while sitting in the vehicle. On 1 st
August, 2006 morning, from a newspaper reporting,
the father of Zulfikar @ Zulfi and Nazakat learnt that
both of them had been killed by Delhi Police in a fake
encounter.

The case which was pending before the

Sessions Court at Ghaziabad pertained to the murder
of brother of co-accused Constable Ashok, in which
according to

the complainant

his two sons were

falsely implicated. On the aforesaid complaint a case
FIR No.Nil/2006 under Sections 364/302 IPC was
registered against co-accused Constable Ashok and
others at PS Kavi Nagar, Ghaziabad.

The case was

later transferred to Delhi Police on 10th August, 2006
whereupon a FIR No.383/2006 was registered at PS
Timarpur, Delhi.
3.

Prior to registration of said FIR another FIR
No.359/2006 under Sections 186/353/307/34 IPC
and 25/27 Arms Act on the basis of an information

Bail Application No.4561/2006

Page 3 of 11

given by co-accused ASI Pramod Kumar Tyagi, had
been registered at PS Timarpur, Delhi. In this FIR it
was stated that on 31st July, 2006 pursuant to

a

secret information while ASI Pramod Kumar Tyagi
alongwith Head Constable Yashpal, Constable Sudesh
Rana, Constable Pradeep Singh, Constable Ravinder
Kumar,

Constable

Satish

Kumar

and

Constable/Driver Naresh Kumar, being the driver of
the Tempo Traveller No.DL-1V-2879, was in east
Delhi area at about 3.30 pm he received

an

information that two gangsters namely Zulfikar @
Zulfi and Nazakat were to come from Wazirabad side
to pass through Jagatpuri village in a stolen white
Maruti van and that both of them were armed with
unlicensed weapons and were likely to commit some
crime. Co-accused ASI Pramod Kumr Tyagi assisted
by police party consisting of aforesaid police officials
eventually succeeded in intercepting
Bail Application No.4561/2006

the stolen white
Page 4 of 11

Maruti van and in the course of an encounter, which
allegedly ensued both Zulfikar @ Zulfi and Nazakat,
who were there in the said Maruti van, got injured in
the course of firing by the police party in their self
defence and later succumbed to the gun shot injuries
at Trauma Centre.
4.

Learned Senior counsel appearing for the
petitioner argued that the petitioner being the driver
of Tempo Traveller No.DL-1V-2879 had simply acted
in terms of direction of his superior officer co-accused
ASI Pramod Kumar Tyagi without being in the know
of alleged criminal conspiracy to eliminate Zulfikar @
Zulfi and Nazakat and the only offence which he can
at best be said to have committed relates to making
of false entry in the log book which is a bailable one.
Learned

Senior

counsel

referred

to

disclosure

statement of one of the co-accused to show that the
petitioner was not aware of the alleged criminal
Bail Application No.4561/2006

Page 5 of 11

conspiracy

prior to Zulfikar @ Zulfi and Nazakat

being killed in the fake encounter.
5.

On behalf of the State it was, on the other
hand, contended that the petitioner was very much
aware of the

criminal conspiracy and that he

deliberately made a false entry in the log book with a
view to cover up the factum of the vehicle driven by
him being taken to Ghaziabad to abduct the said two
persons from Ghaziabad District Court Complex in
order to help his co-accused to eliminate them in a
fake encounter.

Learned Addl. P.P.

submitted that

the petitioner being driver of the vehicle

could not

take the vehicle to Ghaziabad without due permission
in that regard.

He argued that

not only that the

petitioner made false entry in his log book, he also
omitted to tell his superiors about the fake encounter
when his superior officers

visited the scene of fake

encounter. It was pointed out by learned Addl. P.P.
Bail Application No.4561/2006

Page 6 of 11

that the charge sheet in the matter has already been
filed and in the event of petitioner being released on
bail there is reasonable apprehension of his trying to
tamper with the evidence by intimidating or otherwise
influencing the public witnesses.

Reference was

made

made

to two complaints already

by the

complainant and PWs Jamshed Ali and Irfan to the
police regarding

threats received by them from the

accused. It was pointed out that the petitioner is not
a person with clean antecedents in as much as he is
an accused

in a case FIR No.335/1999 under

Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 of ITP Act PS

Prashant

Vihar, Delhi for being found present at and arrested
from a brothel.
6.

In the course of investigation

from the

statement of PW Kunwar Ayub Ali, Advocate,

who

was representing Zulfikar @ Zulfi and Nazakat,
deceased

before

Ghaziabad

Bail Application No.4561/2006

Sessions

Court

in

Page 7 of 11

Sessions Trial No.221/2004 and a certified copy of
order sheet dated 31st July, 2006 of the court
concerned, it is gathered that

Zulfikar @Zulfi and

Nazakat deceased had appeared before the Ghaziabad
court in the said case on 31st July, 2006 and that they
had left the court room at about 2.00 to 2.30 PM on
the case being adjourned to 18th August, 2006. The
statements of PWs Jamshed Ali and Irfan who were
there in the company of the said two deceased
persons at Ghaziabad Collectorate before they were
taken away by co-accused Constable Ashok and other
officials of Delhi Police also confirm the presence of
Zulfikar @ Zulfi and Nazakat at Ghaziabad District
Court Complex upto 2 to 2.30 pm on 31 st July, 2006.
There is thus a prima facie case of Zulfikar @ Zulfi
and Nazakat being lifted from Ghaziabad District
Court Complex on 31st July, 2006 after 2/2.30 pm.
7.

In terms of log book entry the vehicle driven

Bail Application No.4561/2006

Page 8 of 11

by the petitioner was shown to have covered a total
distance of 75 kms. The relevant entry in the log book
of the vehicle was cross checked by way of a trial run
of the route traversed as per log book and it was
discovered that

in terms of

log book

the total

distance of the route measured 47.8 km only while
the

actual distance covered was

75 km leaving

a

deficiency by 28 kms. This deficient distance of 28
km could be made good

if the vehicle travels from

Gagan Cinema to Ghaziabad District Court Complex
and back.

The fact that the vehicle was taken to

Ghaziabad District Court Complex

is sought to be

corroborated by the Cell ID locations of the members
of the raiding party.
8.

Prime accused ASI Pramod Kumar Tyagi and
Constable Sudesh Rana appear to be absconding and
are yet to be arrested. The acts of commission and
omission on the part of petitioner in the

Bail Application No.4561/2006

face of

Page 9 of 11

evidence available on record prima facie appear to
show that the making of false entry in the log book by
the petitioner was designed at preventing detection of
the vehicle driven by him being taken to Ghaziabad to
abduct Zulfikar @ Zulfi and Nazakat and also to
escape an explanation for taking the vehicle outside
the territorial limits without any permission in that
regard. Further, the petitioner keeping quiet about
the entire incident and not telling true facts to his
superiors is also prima facie

indicative of his having

acted in league with his co- accused. The petitioner
cannot

fall back upon an inadmissible piece of

disclosure statement of one of the co-accused to plead
that

he was unaware of the alleged criminal

conspiracy hatched among his co- accused. Further,
in view of complaints of threats administered to the
complainant and the two public witnesses, there is a
reasonable apprehension of the petitioner, in case of
Bail Application No.4561/2006

Page 10 of 11

his release on bail,
intimidating

misusing

the liberty by

or otherwise influencing

the public

witnesses and thereby tampering with the evidence.
9.

In the light of evidence available on record and
the nature as also seriousness of the offence allegedly
committed by the petitioner and his co accused, no
good ground is made out for his being enlarged on
bail. The petition is thus dismissed.

10.

Nothing

stated

herein

tantamounts

to

expression of opinion on merits of the case.
