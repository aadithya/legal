SANJIV KHANNA, J :

1.

The appellant, Mr. Amar Nath is aggrieved by the impugned
th

Judgment dated 20 November, 2006 passed by the learned

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 2

Single Judge dismissing his Writ Petition No.23135/2005 with
liberty to the appellant to pay the amount demanded by the
respondent-Delhi Development Authority (hereinafter referred
to as DDA, for short) within two weeks with 10% interest on the
unpaid amount.
2.

The office file of Delhi Development Authority makes an
interesting reading. The appellant is a registrant under the
Scheme called “Registration Scheme of New Pattern”, 1979 for
allotment of MIG Flat. The appellant deposited Rs.4500/- with
the respondent in 1979. In September, 1998 after nearly twenty
years, a flat in Phase-II, Dwarka was allotted to him. No
communication was sent by the respondent to the appellant for
nearly eleven months. The letter of allotment was posted in
August,1999. This allotment was under the hire-purchase
scheme which did not require lump sum payment but payment
in installments. The file shows that this letter of allotment was
required to be sent to 266A, Bagh Kare Khan, Kishan Ganj
New Delhi-110007 i.e. the address mentioned by the appellant

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 3

on the application form. However, this address was scored off
and the letter was sent to F-65, Kamla Nagar, Delhi-7. The said
address was written by hand. There is no paper on record to
show that the appellant had furnished any information for
change of address. This letter came back undelivered.
Accordingly, as per office noting dated 10th October, 2000, the
respondent-Delhi

Development

Authority

cancelled

the

allotment.
3. In the public hearing held on 7th July, 2004, the appellant
protested against the cancellation. He pointed out that the letter
was sent to a wrong address and not at the address given by
him. It appears that the respondent was initially confused
whether or not the appellant had asked for change of address.
Change in address was recorded in the registration register
maintained by the respondent. This was disputed by Mr. Amar
Nath- the appellant. He stated that he had never changed his
address and had been living at the same address i.e. house
No. 266A, Bagh Kare Khan, Kishan Ganj, New Delhi since

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 4

1979. He also filed documents in support. Commissioner
(Housing) in one of his office noting had recorded that it was
not clear on what basis the address was changed and why in
the registration register change in the address was made
without any document.
4. After detailed examination, on 26th April, 2005, Commissioner
(Housing) accepted the contention of the appellant that he had
never informed about change of address and he had been
residing at the address given in the registration application for
the last 40 years. He also recorded that there was no request
for change of address available in the file. The registration
register was checked and it was found that someone had
wrongly noted the new address by mistake. Reason for change
of address was not mentioned in the register. Thereafter, the
th

next noting on the file dated 27 April, 2005 has been recorded
as under:"Why cannot it be covered under the wrong
address policy as the entire fault of sending
D.L. at wrong address is of Delhi

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 5

Development Authority.”

5. This noting was thereafter approved and it was directed that the
appellant's name be included in the next draw of flats.
6. The respondent has a “wrong address policy”, when due to
fault of the respondent, an allotment letter is sent at a wrong
address. In such cases the registrant is charged the original
cost plus interest from the date of original allotment till the date
of fresh allotment or the present cost of the flat, whichever is
less.
th

7. In the draw of lots held on 29 June, 2005 the appellant was
successful and he was allotted Flat No. 741, Second Floor,
Sector 17, Pocket A, Dwarka.
st

8. Allotment letter was issued to the appellant on 31 October,
2005 specifying that the appellant was liable to pay cost of
Rs.11,20,880/- towards cost of the flat. This amount was
calculated on the basis of original cost of the flat plus interest
on the basis of wrong address policy. The allotment letter was

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 6

sent after more than four months from the date of draw of lots
th

st

on 29 June, 2005. Prior to 1 October, 2005 the original cost
of the flat was Rs.8,43,920/- and thereafter the cost was
increased to Rs.12,40,000/-.
9. The current cost of the flat before 1

st

October, 2005 was

Rs.8,43,920/-. This was much lower than the original cost and
interest that worked out to Rs.11,14,470/- with interest upto 31
September, 2005 and Rs.11,20,880/- with interest upto 30

st

th

Oct.,2005. Therefore, the appellant was entitled to allotment of
flat for Rs. 8,43,920/- if the allotment was made before 31

st

September, 2005 and thereafter at Rs.11,20,880/-. It is also the
case of both parties that the date of issue of allotment letter is
the date of allotment and the date of issue of allotment letter
determines the price payable by the appellant.
10.It may be relevant here to refer to the judgment of the Supreme
Court in Delhi Development Authority versus Pushpendra
Kumar Jain, 1994 Supp (3) SCC 494 , wherein it was
observed;

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 7

“6. A perusal of the High Courts order shows
that it is based upon the following two
reasons:
(1)Though the draw was held on 12-10-1990,
the allotment-cum-demand letter was
issued to the respondent only on January
9/13, 1991. This delay was the result of
inefficiency of the DDA.
(2)Inasmuch as the issue of allotment-cumdemand letter was delayed in the office of
DDA, it cannot charge the revised land
rates to the respondent inasmuch as the
respondent became entitled to get the flat
on 12-10-1990; the revision of land rates
subsequent to the draw of lots cannot
affect the respondent.

7. In our opinion, both the grounds assigned
by the High Court are unsustainable. There
was no material placed before the High Court
nor has any material been brought to our
notice to record a finding that the interval of
three months between the draw of lots and
the despatch of allotment-cum-demand letter
was on account of inefficiency of the
appellant. The appellant's case is that the
draw of lots was held for nearly three
thousand flats and since the land rates were
revised meanwhile, the process of calculating
the cost of each flat and sending of demandcum-allotment letters to nearly three thousand
allottees took some time. In our opinion, the
interval of three months cannot be
characterised either as inordinate or as

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 8

deliberate delay. The scheme itself does not
prescribe the period within which allotment
has to be communicated from the date of
draw of lots. It has, of course, to be done
within a reasonable period.”
11.This decision was considered in Kanpur Development Authority
versus Sheela Devi, (2003) 12 SCC 497 , and it was held
“18 . The case of Prashant Kumar Shahi
aforementioned, is also of no help to the
appellant. It supports the case of the
respondents. This Court held that if the
Authority is found to be responsible for the
delay in delivery of the possession of the plots
in terms of the agreement arrived at or
according to the assurance given in the
brochure, the allottee cannot be burdened
with the interest on the balance amount not
paid by him. But on the facts of that case,
fault was found with the allottee in regard to
the delay in payment. As already recorded
above, in these appeals, with which we are
concerned, delay was on account of the
appellant Authority itself.”

12.Some judgments of the Delhi High Court may also be noticed.
In Writ Petition (Civil) No. 23547/2005 titled Mr. Rajeev Kapoor
versus Delhi Development Authority, it was noticed that draw of

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 9
th

lots was held on 15 October, 2004 but till the date of passing
th

of the Order i.e. 4 January, 2006, demand-cum-allotment letter
had not been issued. In these circumstances, the Court felt that
three months time was reasonable time within which DDA
should have issued necessary demand-cum-allotment letter.
Similarly, in the case of Jagdish Khanna versus DDA, Writ
Petition (Civil) No. 397/2006, the petitioner therein was allotted
a flat in the year 1999 but the letter was sent to a wrong
address. In another draw of lots in 2004 a new flat was allotted.
However issue of allotment letter was delayed as DDA had doubts
and decided to carry out fresh verification about the address of

the petitioner therein. The file moved from one officer to the
other. Ld. Single Judge came to the conclusion that there was
no justification to direct further enquiry. It was accordingly directed

that demand-cum-allotment letter should have been issued within
reasonable period from the draw of lots. Three months in the
said

case

was

taken

as

the

reasonable

period

for

calculating the current cost. In Writ Petition (Civil) No.

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 10

23419/2005 titled Smt. Krishna Mehta versus DDA, the learned
Single Judge relying upon the earlier decisions has held that
Courts had broadly taken three months as reasonable time for
issuance of demand-cum-allotment letter after the draw of lots.
13.

It cannot be said that the Courts had fixed three months

period as outer or lower limit for issue of demand-cumallotment letter after draw of lots. The Courts merely regarded
the said period as "sufficient" or “reasonable period” for
calculating the dues payable and issue of demand cum
allotment letter. The said period is indicative and is not fixed by
the Courts as mandatory period for computing the current cost
or the original cost and interest.

Three months has been

treated as a reasonable or normal period within which demandcum-allotment letter should be issued.

This cannot be

regarded as cut-of date, outer limit or even lower limit for fixing
the price. This period is not sacrosanct. What is reasonable
time in a given case depends upon several factors and can
vary from case to case. The period of three months cannot be

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 11

regarded as an inflexible period legislated by the Courts, nor
can it be held that even if there is justification for the delay, the
lower price should be charged. However, cause and reason for
the delay are within the knowledge of the respondent -DDA and
therefore if there is delay, the onus to show that the delay is
reasonable must be discharged by the respondent by justifying
the abnormal time taken.
14.In this regard we may refer to the averments made in the Writ
Petition which was filed by the appellant. In paragraph 9 of the
Writ Petition it was stated that due to inefficient working, callous
and

indifferent

attitude

towards

registrants/allottees,

the

appellant had been made to cough out a higher amount. Some
of the judgments mentioned above, were cited by the appellant
in support of his contention. In the counter affidavit filed by
DDA, there is no justification and reason given for the time
st

taken to issue demand-cum-allotment letter on 31 October,
th

2005 when the draw of lots was held on 29 June, 2005.
15.However, to satisfy ourselves and to verify the reasons for the

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 12

delay in issue of the demand-cum-allotment letter, we have
examined the original file produced before us.
th

16.After the draw of lots on 29 June, 2005, the first noting in the
th

file is dated 6 July, 2005 which records that the appellant was
th

successful in the draw of lots. Thereafter, on 12 July, 2005
costing details was required to be computed. Strangely, without
th

recording any reason on 25 July, 2005, it was recorded that
before costing details can be finalised, the file should be
examined by the concerned zone. The next noting in the file is
dated 1

st

August, 2005 wherein again it was accepted that

original cost could be charged with interest @ 12% per annum.
This aspect had already been decided earlier in April, 2005
when it was decided that the appellant was covered by wrong
address policy. Moreover, in the present case current cost of
th

the flat before 30 September, 2005 was lower than the original
cost plus interest. Therefore there should not have been any
difficulty in issuing the allotment-cum-demand letter on the
basis of the current cost which was lower.

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 13
th

17.The cost was computed on 25 August, 2005 on the basis of
original cost of the flat of Rs.3,19,671/- and as on the said
date, the old cost was found to be Rs.6,40,500/-.

On this

amount, interest was first calculated for a period of 74 months
i.e. up to 30

th

September, 2005 and total demand of

Rs.11,14,470/- was computed. There is over-writing and this
figure has been changed to Rs.11,20,880/- by increasing the
number of months for which interest was payable to 75 months
from 74 months. Thus interest was charged upto the end of
October, 2005. After the calculation of the cost which had taken
almost two months from the date of draw of lots, the file started
moving at a snail's pace. There are about 42 signatures and
stamps at pages 11 and 12 of the file which shows the file
being pushed from one table to the other. There are virtually no
notings on these two pages. The file shows a definite attempt to
delay the issue of demand-cum-allotment letter.
18.It is admitted case of both the appellant and the respondent
that in case the demand-cum-allotment letter had been issued

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 14

in September, 2005 as per wrong address policy of the Delhi
Development Authority, the appellant would have been liable to
pay the current cost of the flat on the date of the issuance of
the allotment letter i.e. Rs.8,43,920/- or the original cost of the
flat plus interest i.e. Rs.11,14,470/-, whichever was lower.
st

However, as the allotment letter was issued after 1 October,
2005 and there was change in the cost of the flat and as per
the working by the Delhi Development Authority, the appellant
was liable to pay either Rs.12,39,730/- or Rs.11,20,880/-, which
ever was lower.
19.During the course of the arguments, we had asked the counsel
for the Delhi Development Authority on what date every year
costs of the flats was being regularly increased/revised by the
Delhi Development Authority and whether as a matter of policy,
cost was being increased on 1

st

October every year. At the

time of hearing, the counsel for the respondent-Delhi
Development Authority had stated that normally costs of flats
st

were increased on 1 April of every year being the start of the

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 15

financial year. It was further stated that in the year 2005 costs
st

of flats were increased on two occasions i.e. 1 April, 2005 and
st

1 October, 2005. It was, therefore, submitted that the increase
st

in the price of flats as on 1 October, 2005 was unusual and not
normal. However, counsel for the respondent on the following
day informed us in the open Court that the Delhi Development
Authority had been increasing cost of flats every year on 1

st

October and this was the position even prior to 2005.Thus the
respondent was aware that the cost of the flat was likely to go
st

up on 1 October, 2005.
th

20.It is apparent from the calculations made on 25 August,2005
that it was decided that the demand cum allotment should be
st

issued after 1 October, 2005. As already stated above, first
calculation of interest upto 30

th

Sept.,2005 had been done but

subsequently this was struck off and calculation of interest upto
th

30 October, 2005 was done. It was perhaps decided that letter
st

of allotment shall not be issued before 1 October, 2005 so that
the appellant does not get benefit of lower price. This also

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 16

explains the slow movement of the file thereafter.
21.The file, after calculations were done, simply moved from one
table to the other and sometimes remained lying for days at
th

one table. This can be seen from the fact that after 25 August,
2005, the next signature is dated 31

st

August, 2005 and

thereafter it was examined with next signature on 12
September, 2005. From 12

th

September, 2005 till 16

th

th

September, 2005 file passed through several hands who simply
signed the file without any observation. On page 11 of the file,
there are as many as 21 different signatures and stamps for the
th

th

period between 25 August, 2005 to 15 September, 2005 with
virtually no notings. Similarly, noting dated 14

th

September,

2005 is self explanatory and reads as under:“Cost of Rs.11,20,880/- calculated on the prepage may please be approved.”

22.Cost of Rs.11,20,880/- included interest upto 31

st

October,

2005. It is, therefore, clear from the above noting sheet dated
th

14 September, 2005 that it had been decided that demand-

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 17

cum-allotment letter would be issued to the appellant in
October, 2005 and not in September, 2005. It may be noted
th

here that as per the computation made on 25 August, 2005
the total costs with interest upto 30

th

September, 2005 was

Rs.11,14,470/- only. Subsequently, this figure is scored off and
interest upto October, 2005 was calculated and accordingly the
cost was increased to Rs.11,20,880/-. On 16

th

September,

2005 it is recorded that cost has been approved and may
be sent for necessary action. Thereafter there are as many as
seven signatures with direction to prepare the demand letter.
th

Demand letter was directed to be issued on 28 September,
2005 with the following observations:
11.“In this case costing has been approved by the
competent authority on pre-page. Now ADC
(Systems) may please prepare the demand letter.”

23.

It again took more than a month just to issue the demand
rd

letter which was posted on 3 November, 2005.
24.

We feel equity and justice demands in the present case that

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 18

the appellant should be asked to pay the lower figure i.e., the cost
payable had demand-cum-allotment letter been issued on or before
th

30 September, 2005 and should not be made to suffer because of
red tapism and file pushing in the office of Delhi Development
Authority. In fact, the file notings which have been quoted above
clearly show a concerted effort to prolong and delay issue of letter
th

of allotment beyond September, 2005. Noting dated 14 September,
2005 has also been quoted. There are huge gaps and delays in
between, when the file remained pending on one table or the other
for days. Similarly, it also shows lack of concern on the part of the
officers of the Delhi Development Authority to process and issue
letter of allotment expeditiously so that burden is not put on the
appellant who had been waiting since 1979 to have his own home. It has
not been stated by the Delhi Development Authority that other persons
th

successful in the draw of lots on 29 June,2005 had not been issued
st

letter of allotment before the price increase on 1 October, 2005. We
feel in the present case the demand-cum-allotment letter had not
been issued within the reasonable time and the appellant should not

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 19

be made to suffer on the ground of inefficiency and negligence on the
part of the officers of the Delhi Development Authority,for their failure
to process the case when they knew that in case the demand letter
th

was not processed on or before 30 September, 2005, the appellant
would be liable to pay increased and higher cost. It is the case in
which the appellant has been denied fair and just treatment.
Callousness, lethargic attitude
citizens

unmindful of adverse effect on

on the part of the respondent cannot be accepted. File

pushing and red tapism cannot be given legal acceptance with costs
being paid by innocent allottees, who then are driven to look for and
adopt different ways and means for prompt issue of letter of demandcum-allotment letter.
25.

In view of the above, we allow the present appeal and set

aside the order of the learned Single Judge. The

writ

petition is

also accordingly allowed. It is directed that the appellant is entitled
to allotment on the basis of price prevailing in September, 2005 or
the original cost plus interest in terms of the Delhi Development
Authority policy, whichever is less. If the appellant has already paid

LPA No. 65/2007

Page 20

excess amount, the same shall be refunded back by Delhi
Development Authority within a period of four weeks. In case of any
delay beyond four weeks, Delhi Development Authority will be liable
to pay interest @ 8% per annum after four weeks till refund. The
appellant will also be entitled to costs, which are assessed at
Rs.5,000/-.
