Two applications shall be disposed of by this order. The first

application (IA.No.9165/2007) has been filed by the plaintiff under Order
39 Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908 (hereinafter referred to as the 'CPC') and the second application
(IA.No. 10779/2007) has been filed by the defendant under the provisions
of Order 39 Rule 4 CPC for vacation of the ex parte interim injunction
which was granted by this Court on 14.08.2007 on the first application, that
is, IA 9165/2007.

The Ex Parte Order:
2.

A reading of the order dated 14.08.2007 reveals that the plaintiff

claimed itself to be the proprietor of the registered trademark “RANA” in
respect of its products which include steel rolled products, C. T. D bars,
angles, flats, rounds, channels and girders. The plaintiff had stated that it
had used the said trademark since 1993 continuously and that it had applied
for the registration of the trademark on 14.12.1994 which was finally
granted on 03.03.2006. The said registration was in Class 6 specified in
Schedule IV to the Trade Marks Rules, 2002. It may be pertinent to note
that while the application for registration was made at the time when the
Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 was in operation, the actual
registration was done on 03.03.2006 and in view of Section 159(2) of the
Trade Marks Act, 1999, it would be deemed to be a registration under the
said Act of 1999.

3.

It was also stated that the sales of the plaintiff in respect of the

goods in question run into several crores of rupees. It was alleged by the
plaintiff that the defendant had recently started using the trademark “RANA
TOR” in respect of identical products, namely, steel bars. The plaintiff, as
stated in the plaint, came to know of this in July 2007 and, consequently,
had immediately approached this Court by filing this suit. On the basis of
the statements made in the plaint and the documents filed along with the

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.2 of 34

plaint as well as the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
plaintiff, the following order was passed on 14.08.2007:“In view of the averments made in the plaint and
submissions made by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, I
am of the view that the plaintiff is entitled to ex parte
orders. Accordingly, till the next date of hearing the
defendants by itself or through their proprietors, partners,
directors, agents, representatives, distributors, assigns,
heirs, successors, stockists and all others acting for and on
their behalf shall refrain from using, selling, advertising,
displaying or through the visual, audio, print mode or by
any other mode manner or dealing in or using the
trademark RANA or any other identical or deceptively
similar mark in respect of the impugned goods in relation
to metal building materials, pipes, tubes of steel which
include rods, flats, pipes, angles and building steels made
of mild steel and related / allied products.”
The Defendant's arguments:
4.

Being aggrieved by this order, the defendant has filed the second

application, that is, the application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC for vacation
of the same.

It was contended by Mr Sudhir Chandra, the learned senior

counsel who appeared on behalf of the defendant, that this Court would not
have granted the ex parte injunction to the plaintiff had the full facts been
disclosed. He submitted that, first of all, it was not disclosed to this Court
that the defendant was the registered proprietor of the trademark “RANA
TOR”.

The defendant's trademark was registered on 06.04.2005 under

Class 19 in respect of “building material (steel)”. Since the application for
the same had been made on 26.04.2001, the registration would relate back
to that date. It was also contended by Mr Sudhir Chandra that both the
plaintiff and the defendant have trademark registrations. The plaintiff has a
IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.3 of 34

registration in respect of the trademark “RANA” whereas the defendant has
a registration in respect of the trademark “RANA TOR”. He submitted that
in view of Section 28(3) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, there is a complete
bar in respect of filing a suit by one registered proprietor of a trademark
against another registered proprietor of the same or similar mark. Section
28 (3) reads as under:“28.

Rights conferred by registration

1.

xxxx

xxxx

xxxx

xxxx

2.

xxxx

xxxx

xxxx

xxxx

3.

Where two or more persons are registered
proprietors of trade marks, which are identical
with or nearly resemble each other, the
exclusive right to the use of any of those trade
marks shall not (except so far as their respective
rights are subject to any conditions or
limitations entered on the register) be deemed to
have been acquired by any one of those persons
as against any other of those persons merely by
registration of the trade marks but each of those
persons has otherwise the same rights as against
other persons (not being registered users using
by way of permitted use) as he would have if he
were the sole registered proprietor.”

It was contended by the learned counsel that while the two registered
proprietors had exclusive rights to use the trademarks in respect of third
parties, they did not have such exclusivity in respect of each other.
Therefore, the plaintiff could not have filed the present suit against the
defendant in respect of the alleged infringement of the trademark. The
provisions of Section 30 (2) (e) were also referred to by Mr Sudhir Chandra.
They stipulate that a registered trademark is not infringed where the use of a
IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.4 of 34

registered trademark, being one of two or more trade marks registered under
this Act which are identical or nearly resemble each other, is in exercise of
the right to the use of that trade mark given by registration under this Act.
It was contended that since the defendant had a registered trademark,
namely, “RANA TOR”, no infringement action could lie against the
defendant for the use of the said trademark.

5.

It was further contended on behalf of the defendant that, apart

from the question of infringement of trademark under the Trade Marks Act,
1999, this suit has also been filed on account of allegations of passing off.
In this regard, he submitted that there is no evidence that the mark
employed by the plaintiff had acquired a distinctive character so as to
connect the plaintiff with the said mark exclusively. He submitted that
there is no evidence produced by the plaintiff in respect of any sales under
the said trademark for the years 1996-2005. He submitted that prior to 1996
there may have been certain local sales, most of which were cash sales and
there were no excise records produced by the plaintiff in respect of such
sales. It was also submitted that the defendant is based in Tamil Nadu and
its business is confined to the southern Indian states. He also submitted that
the defendant has been in business since 1991 and has been using the said
trademark since then. He referred to various documents filed on behalf of
the defendant and in particular the Chartered Accountant's certificate at
page 5 of the documents file which relates to sale figures of 1996-97, the

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.5 of 34

costs of advertisement etc. In any event, he submitted that all the sales of
the defendant are in South India and there are no sales whatsoever in Delhi.
A statement was also made at the Bar that the defendant had no intention to
sell its products in Delhi. On the basis of these statements, it was submitted
by Mr Sudhir Chandra that this Court would not have territorial jurisdiction
to entertain the present suit and, therefore, the plaint itself has to be returned
after the ex parte order is vacated. He submitted that insofar as the action
based on infringement of the trademark is concerned, that would not lie
because of the provisions of Section 28(3) read with Section 30(2)(e) of the
Trade Marks Act, 1999. As regards the passing off action, he submitted, the
same would only lie if there were sales by the defendant in Delhi or there
was any threat of any sales in Delhi. The threat aspect has been discussed
in a decision of this Court in the case of Pfizer Products Inc. v. Altamash
Khan & Anr.: 2006 (32) PTC 208 (Del). He submitted that there is not an
iota of evidence of any sale by the defendant of any product under the
trademark “RANA TOR” in Delhi. Furthermore, the defendant has no
intention of selling its products in Delhi and it is for this purpose that the
statement at the bar had been made that the defendant does not intend to sell
any of its products in Delhi. Therefore, not only are there no sales in Delhi,
there is also no threat of sales in Delhi. Consequently, it was submitted that
in respect of the passing off action, this Court would not have any territorial
jurisdiction.

6.

It was also contended that the balance of convenience lay in

vacating the order and not in maintaining it. He submitted that there is no
evidence of user by the defendant in Delhi. The defendant had substantial
sales in South India. The plaintiff has not furnished any sales figures for the
period 1996-2005. No invoices have been placed on record so as to enable
this Court to take a prima facie view that the plaintiff had a long and
continuous user of the mark “RANA”. It was also contended by the learned
counsel for the defendant that the plaintiff has been guilty of suppression of
facts. With reference to the Supreme Court decision in the case of Salem
Advocate Bar Association, Tamil Nadu v. Union of India : (2005) 6 SCC
344, he contended that this is a fit case where actual costs should be
imposed on the plaintiff. He submitted that because of the suppression of
facts on the part of the plaintiff, this Court was persuaded to pass the ex
parte orders, which has resulted in untold misery to the defendant. He
submits that Rs 10 crores worth of goods are lying unsold and are rusting.
He also submitted that a suit of the present nature ought to be thrown out
and such a practice should be deprecated in strong words. Consequently, he
submitted that the injunction order passed on 14.08.2007 ought to be
vacated.

The plaintiff's arguments:
7.

Mr Bansal, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, submitted

that there was no suppression of facts and that the order passed on

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.7 of 34

14.08.2007 ought to be maintained. First of all, he submitted that the
trademark registration, which was obtained by the defendant, was in an
entirely different Class from that of the plaintiff's registration.

The

defendant's registration was in respect of Class 19 whereas the plaintiff's
registration was under Class 6. He referred to the IVth

Schedule to the

Trade Mark Rules, 2002 and drew my attention to the contents of Class 6
and Class 19. He submitted that Class 6 deals with metallic goods whereas
Class 19 dealt entirely with non-metallic goods. In this background he
submitted that the registration of the defendant's mark “RANA TOR” in
Class 19 is ex facie wrong. He submitted that in respect of steel, there could
not have been any registration under Class 19 and the same could only have
been registered in Class 6.

8.

He submitted that in 2005 the defendant had also filed an

application No.1334903 for registration of the label mark “RANA TOR”
under Class 6. The plaintiff filed an opposition to the same in Form TM-5.
In the counter statement to the plaintiff's said opposition, no mention was
made by the defendant that its application for registration under Class 19
was pending. The counter statement also revealed that the defendant had
stated that it was the leading manufacturer and merchant in India of a wide
range of “building materials which includes pipes and tubes of metals, flats,
rods and angles”. The defendant had also stated that by way of the “rich
quality standards maintained”, wide advertisements made in different media

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.8 of 34

and promotional efforts undertaken “ever since the year 2001”, the
defendant had earned valuable reputation in the field of manufacturing and
marketing of the said goods. It was, therefore, contended by Mr Bansal that
the defendant, by its own statement made in the counter statement, did not
have any user in respect of the mark RANA prior to 2001. Secondly, the
defendant did not disclose in its counter statement that it had applied for
registration of the mark “RANA TOR” under Class 19.

9.

Mr Bansal sought to answer the allegations made by Mr Sudhir

Chandra that there was no evidence of any sales during the period 19962005 and more so no evidence with regard to any excise documents. He
drew my attention to page 44 of the plaintiff's documents which was a bill
raised by Rana Steels and was dated 01.01.1994 with respect to MS angles.
A reference was also made to the sales turnover for the year 31.03.1996 at
pages 25 to 33 of the plaintiff's documents.

There is no doubt the sales

figures are substantial but it must be noted that they pertain to K.K. Steel
Limited which, according to the learned counsel for the plaintiff, is a part of
the group of which Rana Steels is a constituent. Mr Bansal then referred to
page 50 of the plaintiff's documents to show that there were excise
documents also in respect of the Rana Steels in 1996. The said document
does indicate that it pertains to the removal of certain goods. However, the
description of the goods is NS ingots. The document is dated 27.03.1996.
A reference was also made to the document at page 61 of the plaintiff's

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.9 of 34

document which is a bill dated 08.09.2006 raised on Rana Steels with
respect to the advertising charges over the radio. Similarly, the document at
page 68 also indicates that the plaintiff has, in the year 2007, extensively
advertised in radio-one FM in Delhi.

10.

It was next contended by Mr Bansal that the adoption of the

mark RANA has a basis and is not mischievous as in the case of the
defendant. He submitted that a look at the Memorandum and Articles of
Association of K.K. Steels Limited would show that the word RANA forms
part of the names of the promoter Directors and it is for this reason that the
mark RANA was employed by the plaintiff

and in respect of which

registration has been obtained.

11.

Mr Bansal referred to page 1 of the second volume of the

plaintiff's documents to show an advertisement in the Punjab Kesari of
04.11.1993 which was brought out by the plaintiff in respect of the mark
RANA. Another advertisement was brought out in the same newspaper but
on a different date, i.e., 21.10.1993. He referred to similar advertisements
in Punjab Kesari of other dates as well as of Amar Ujala in 1994. The
advertisements which appear in 1993-94 in Amar Ujala referred to the
plaintiff's name RANA Steels as well as the mark RANA and they clearly
indicate that the plaintiff's “RANA Steels” is the first automatic plant in
North India and that it manufactures, inter alia, bars, angles, channels,

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.10 of 34

rounds, flats and girders of steel. A reference was also made to the caution
notice taken out on behalf of the advocates of the plaintiff with regard to the
use of the mark RANA.

This caution notice was published in the

Vijayawada edition of the Hindu of 17.08.2006. A reference was then made
to the September 2006 edition of the Hindi Magazine Parvat Piyush, which
is brought out from Dehradun.

The said

Magazine contains an

advertisement by the Rana Group of Companies which includes RANA
Steels (Plaintiff herein). The advertisement is in respect of various steel
products of the said Rana Group of Companies and includes the expression
“RANA SARIA” as well as RANA GIRDERS”. A reference was also made
to the estimate dated 17.03.2006 raised by Top Advertising in respect of
telecasting charges of T.V. advertisements on the Sun T.V. Channel at
Chennai. The said advertisements were in the month of March 2006. On
the basis of the aforesaid documents, Mr Bansal submitted that there is,
prima facie, evidence of continuous user from 1993-2006 of the mark
RANA in respect of the plaintiff's products. He submitted that there is also
evidence that the plaintiff has vigorously advertised its mark and because of
which the mark has become distinctive of the plaintiff's products.

He

submitted that on the other hand the defendant has no right or logical basis
to use the mark RANA. He submitted that the defendant's name was and is
RAN India Steels Pvt Limited and its products were sold under the mark
RAN. This would be apparent from the invoice-cum-delivery challan dated
28.10.2001 which has been filed at page 60 of the defendant's documents.

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.11 of 34

There are similar documents in respect of the product TOR Steel at pages
60, 61, 62 and 63.

All these are invoice-cum-delivery challans of

September and October, 2001. Mr Bansal also submitted that apart from the
fact that these invoice-cum-delivery challans reveal that the defendant was
using the mark RAN at that point of time and not RANA, it also reveals that
these documents have been fabricated because the words “RANA TOR
TESTED” appear to the eye to have been printed later and using a different
typewriter / printer. He submitted that this would be further apparent by
comparing similar invoice-cum-delivery challans of August 2005 which
have been placed at pages 149 -150 of the documents file.

On an

examination of all the invoice-cum-delivery challans filed by the defendant
beginning from 16.04.2000 and ending with 24.07.2007 running from pages
1 to 210 of the defendant' documents, it is clearly discernible that for the
period prior to May 2001 there is no mention of the mark RANA in any of
the invoices of the defendant. In respect of the period from May, 2001 right
upto June, 2004, the invoices apparently did not contain the expression
“RANA TOR TESTED” when they were originally issued. But the said
expression has been subsequently superimposed on each of the challans
using a different ribbon, perhaps a different printing devise. However, from
July, 2005 onwards, the expression “RANA TOR TESTED” appears to
have been printed on the original invoices themselves. On the basis of this,
the learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the invoices for the
period 2001 to 2004 are clear fabrications. He also submitted that the

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.12 of 34

defendant has not been able to show any advertisements prior to 2005 in
respect of mark RANA.

13.

Mr Bansal then referred to the jurisdictional argument which was

raised by Mr Sudhir Chandra. He drew my attention to paragraph 26 of the
plaint where it is stated that this court has territorial jurisdiction to try and
adjudicate the present suit inasmuch as the defendant's impugned acts of
infringement and passing off are taking place in Delhi. It is also alleged
that the defendant has intention to use the impugned trademark / label in
Delhi, if not already used inasmuch as the defendant has filed the impugned
application for registration, on an All India basis. It is also alleged that the
defendant is otherwise soliciting trade and has distribution networks in
Delhi in relation to the said trade mark / labels. In view of these averments,
the learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that this court would have
territorial jurisdiction to entertain this present suit. He submitted that the
defence taken by the defendant in the written statement is not required to be
gone into at this stage and as to whether the allegations contained in para 26
of the plaint are established or not can only be determined on evidence. He
referred to the decision of a learned Single Judge of this court in the case of
S. Oliver Bernd Freier GmbH & Co. KG V Karni Enterprises & Anr :
2006 (33) PTC 574 (Del) to submit that the defendants are functioning on
an All India basis and the threat looms large in Delhi also. He also reiterated
that in the counter statement to the opposition filed by the plaintiff referred
to above, the defendant had itself stated that it is the leading manufacturer
of building materials in India. Therefore, it was contended by Mr Bansal

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.14 of 34

that this court has jurisdiction both in respect of the infringement action and
in respect of the passing off action.

The defendant's further arguments:
14.

Mr Sudhir Chandra, the learned senior counsel appearing on

behalf of the defendant, submitted, in rejoinder, that the registration of the
defendant's mark “RANA TOR” in Class 19 was not defective.

He

submitted that the application was made under the Trade and Merchandise
Marks Act, 1958. The registration, however, was granted when the said Act
had been replaced by the Trade Marks Act 1999. He submitted that Class
19 in the IVth Schedule to the Trade and Merchandise Marks Rules 1959
was materially different from Class 19 of the IVth Schedule to the Trade
Marks Rules, 2002. The old Class 19 referred to building materials whereas
the new Class 19, inter alia, referred to building materials (Non-metallic).
It was submitted by Mr Sudhir Chandra that old Class 19 included both
metallic and non-metallic materials whereas new Class 19 has reference
only to non-metallic building materials. Therefore, the registration of the
defendant's mark under Class 19 in respect of the building materials (steels)
cannot be regarded as a fractured registration or a registration under a
mistake.

15.

Mr Sudhir Chandra also submitted that with regard to the

passing off action, Delhi has no jurisdiction. Moreover, no use has been

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.15 of 34

indicated by the plaintiff between 1996-2005 and, therefore, the plaintiff
can be assumed to have abandoned the mark. Mr Sudhir Chandra also
referred to P.M. Dissels Pvt Ltd v Thukral Mechanical Word : AIR 1988
Del 282; Pfizer Products, Inc v Rajesh Chopra & Ors : 2006 (32) PTC
301 (Del) ; and Dabur India limited v K.R. Industries : 2006(33) PTC 348
(Del.).

16.

He also submitted that, essentially, in a passing off action, the

plaintiff must show that its mark has acquired distinctiveness by continuous
user. In this context, he submitted that the mark RANA is not known at all
as being distinctive of the plaintiff's products. He reiterated that there is no
invoice for the periods 1996 to 2005 and the sales figures that have been
given by the plaintiff are those of K.K. Steels and not of the plaintiff
(RANA Steels).

Jurisdiction:
17.

The argument advanced on the part of the defendant is that the

plaintiff’s suit for infringement is not maintainable on account of the
provisions of section 28 (3) of the trademarks act, 1999 and, therefore,
section 134 (2) of the said act would not be available to the plaintiff. The
further argument is that in respect of the alleged passing off action nothing
has happened in Delhi as the defendant has neither sold nor offered its
products for sale in Delhi and, therefore, this court would not have

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.16 of 34

territorial jurisdiction over this suit. At this juncture, it would be instructive
to remember that the suit filed by the plaintiff is composite in nature. It is
both, a suit for infringement of the trademark RANA as well as a suit for
passing off. Therefore, the question of territorial jurisdiction has to be
examined keeping in mind this composite nature of the suit. The learned
counsel for the defendant wanted this court to hold that the infringement
action was barred on account of the provisions of section 28 (3) read with
section 30 (2) (e) of the said act. And, then, to look at the suit merely as
one of passing off. But, as will be clear from the discussion that follows, it
cannot be held at this stage that the plaintiff has no case on infringement or
that section 28(3) would come into play or that the defence under section
30(2)(e) would be available to the defendant. Though the position appears
to be to the contrary, those are issues which will have to determined in the
suit after considering the evidence led by the parties. Therefore, in the facts
and circumstances of the present case at this preliminary stage, it cannot be
held that the plaintiff’s alleged infringement action is not maintainable.
Consequently, the argument that this court does not have jurisdiction would
have to be rejected.

Infringement:
18.

The plaintiff has alleged that its mark RANA which is registered

in respect of “steel rolled products, CTD bars, angles, flats, rounds,
channels and girders” falling under class 6 of the Fourth Schedule to the

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.17 of 34

Trade Marks Rules, 2002 has been infringed by the defendant inasmuch as
the defendant has used and is using the mark “RANA TOR” in respect of its
products. The defendant, on the other hand, has taken the stand that there is
no infringement on its part because it is a registered proprietor of the mark
“RANATOR” in respect of “Building materials (steels)” falling under class
19. It was, therefore, contended on the strength of section 28(3) and
30(2)(e) of the said Act that the defendant has not infringed the plaintiff’s
registered trade mark RANA and that both the plaintiff and the defendant
can co-exist in the market using their respective marks. The plaintiff also
propounded the view that the defendant’s registration under class 19 is
invalid as the said class does relate to to metallic products at all.

19.

To examine the relative merits of these contentions a brief survey

of the relevant provisions of the said Act would be necessary. Section 28
(1) of the said act prescribes that, subject to the other provisions of the said
act, the registration of a trademark, if valid, gives to the registered
proprietor of the trademark, the exclusive right to the use of the trademark
"in relation to the goods or services in respect of which the trademark is
registered" and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trademark
in the manner provided by the act. Sub-section (2) stipulates that the
exclusive right to the use of a trademark given under sub-section (1) shall
be subject to any conditions and limitations to which the registration is
subject. As already indicated earlier, sub-section (3) deals with a situation

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.18 of 34

where two or more persons are registered proprietors of trademarks which
are identical to or nearly resemble each other. In such a situation, the
exclusive right to the use of any of those trademarks shall not be deemed to
have been acquired by anyone of those persons as against the other “merely
by registration of the trademarks”. Of course, each of those persons would
otherwise have the same rights as against other persons, not being registered
users using by way of permitted use, as he would have if he were the sole
registered proprietor. It is noteworthy that the registered proprietor of a
trademark gets the exclusive right to use the trademark in relation to the
goods or services in respect of which the trademark is registered. This
means that a trademark is registered not merely in favour of a person but
also bears relation to goods or services. So, while a particular trademark
may be registered in favour of one person in respect of certain goods, that
person may not have the exclusive right to use the mark in respect of other
goods. This means that under normal circumstances the right to use a
trademark to the exclusion of others is only in respect of the goods or
services in connection with which the trademark is registered. There are
exceptions which shall be alluded to presently.

20.

Section 29 (1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, which deals with

the issue of infringement of registered trade marks indicates that a trade
mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a
person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.19 of 34

which is identical with or deceptively similar to the trade mark “in relation
to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered” and in
such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as being
used as a trade mark. So, for an infringement action, it must be shown that
-- (1) the registered trade mark is being used by a person other than the
registered proprietor or by a person permitted to use the same; and (2) the
use must be in the course of trade; and (3) in relation to goods or services
in respect of which the trade mark is registered. This means that if a trade
mark is registered in respect of a certain set of goods or services, then the
use of that trade mark by a person other than the registered proprietor or by
a person permitted to use the same would not, ipso facto, amount to
infringement if such person uses the trade mark in relation to an entirely
different set of goods or services. However, sub-section (2) of section 29 of
the said Act brings within the fold of infringement, uses of the registered
trade mark by a person other than a registered proprietor in respect of
“similar” goods also in three different sets of circumstances -- where there
is (a) identity with the registered trade mark and similarity of the goods or
services covered by the registered trade mark; or (b) similarity to the
registered trade mark and identity or similarity of goods or services covered
by such registered trade mark; or (c) identity with the registered trade mark
and identity of the goods or services covered by the registered trade mark -and there is likelihood of confusion being caused on the part of the public
or the likelihood of such user having an association with the registered trade

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.20 of 34

mark. Sub-Section (3) of Section 29 of the said Act provides that where
there is an identity of the impugned trade mark with the registered trade
mark and there is also an identity of the goods or services covered by the
registered trade mark, the court shall presume that it is likely to cause
confusion on the part of the public. By virtue of sub-section (4) of Section
29, there may be infringement of a registered trade mark even where the
mark is used in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those
for which the trade mark is registered provided, inter alia, the registered
trade mark has a reputation in India and the use of the mark without due
cause takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to the, distinctive character
or repute of the registered trade mark.

21.

A reading of the relevant provisions of Sections 28 and 29 of the

said Act, therefore, reveals that the registration of a trade mark is linked to
the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. If a
person uses a registered trade mark in relation to goods and services which
are different and distinct from the goods or services in respect of which the
trade mark is registered, then he would not be infringing the registered trade
mark except in the case covered by Sub-Section (4) of Section 29 which
requires that the registered trade mark must have a reputation in India and
the use of the mark without due cause would be amounting to taking unfair
advantage of or would be detrimental to the distinctive character or repute
of the registered trade mark.

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.21 of 34

22.

Since the defendant has taken the defence of section 30 (2) (e), it

also needs to be taken note of. This provision stipulates that a registered
trade mark is not infringed where there is use of a registered trade mark,
being one of two or more trade marks registered under the said Act which
are identical or nearly resemble each other, in exercise of the right to the use
of that trade mark given by registration under the said Act. Thus, where
there are two registered trade marks, which are identical or nearly resemble
each other, the use of such trade marks by their respective registered
proprietors would not amount to infringement of the others' registered trade
mark. But, when can there be registration of marks which are identical or
similar? Section 9 of the said Act, inter alia, absolutely prohibits the
registration of trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character,
that is to say, not capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one
person from those of another person. Section 11(1), save as provided in
section 12, also conditionally prohibits the registration of a trade mark if,
because of its (a) identity with an earlier trade mark and similarity of goods
or services covered by the trade mark; or (b) similarity to an earlier trade
mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the
trade mark, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public,
which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade mark.
Section 12 permits the registration of trade marks which are identical or
similar (whether any such trade mark is already registered or not) in respect

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.22 of 34

of the same or similar goods or services in cases of honest concurrent use or
of other special circumstances. It is obvious that where identical or similar
trade marks are registered in relation to the same or similar goods or
services in exercise of the powers under sections 11 and 12, the use of such
marks by their respective proprietors would not amount to infringement.
This is what is specifically provided for under section 30(2)(e).

23.

But, does section 30(2)(e) also cover cases where identical or

similar trade marks are registered in respect of different classes of goods or
services? The answer is – no. Section 28 deals with the rights conferred by
registration. And, it has already been clarified that the use of a registered
mark must be in relation to the goods or services in respect of which the
trade mark is registered. It follows that where the goods or services, in
respect of which two or more identical or similar (nearly resemble) marks
are registered, are different then section 30 (2)(e) does not come into play.
The question of infringement would, itself, not arise as the registered marks
would be used in respect of different classes of goods or services by their
respective proprietors. A couple of examples would further clarify the
position:Example 1: Assume that a trade mark “M” has been registered in
favour of Mr “X” as well as in favour of Mr “Y” in relation to
the same goods or services. In such a situation, by virtue of
section 28(3), neither Mr “X” nor Mr “Y” can claim exclusivity
against each other for the use of the said mark in relation to the
goods or services for which it was registered. If Mr “X” were to
bring an action for infringement against Mr “Y”, the latter would
have a complete defence under section 30(2)(e).
IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.23 of 34

Example 2: Let us now assume that there are two different
goods “A” and “B” in respect of which the same trademark “M”
has been registered in favour of different persons “X” and “Y”,
respectively. Here, although the same mark “M” is registered in
favour of both Mr “X” and Mr “Y”, Mr “X” has exclusive right
to use the same in respect of good “A” and Mr “Y” has exclusive
right to use the said mark in respect of good “B”. Therefore,
section 28(3) is not attracted. Moreover, if Mr “X” were to bring
an action of infringement against Mr “Y” alleging that Mr “Y”
was using the said mark “M” in relation to good “A”, then, the
defence of section 30(2)(e) would not be available to Mr “Y” as
he does not have any right to use the mark “M” in relation to
good “A”, his registration being in relation to good “B”.
24.

At this point, it would be appropriate to refer to Section 7 of the

said Act which provides for classification of goods and services. SubSection (1) stipulates that the Registrar shall classify the goods and services,
as far as may be, in accordance with the international classification of goods
and services for the purposes of registration of trade marks. Rule 22 of the
Trade Marks Rules, 2002 provides that for the purposes of registration of
trade marks, goods and services shall be classified in the manner specified
in the Fourth Schedule. Clearly, registration of trademarks is in relation to
specified goods or services. Goods and services have been classified. It is
obvious that, prima facie, goods falling under one class would be different
from goods falling under another class. Ordinarily, when registration of a
trade mark is granted under one class of goods, it does not cover goods of
another class.

25.

The plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the mark RANA

w.e.f. 14.12.1994 in relation to “steel rolled products, CTD bars, angles,
IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.24 of 34

flats, rounds, channels and girders” falling under class 61 of the Fourth
Schedule to the Trade Marks Rules, 2002. The defendant does not have a
registered trade mark in respect of goods falling under class 6 of the said
schedule. However, as things stand today2, the defendant is the registered
proprietor of the mark “RANATOR” w.e.f. 26.04.2001 in respect of
“Building materials (steels)” falling under class 193.

Whether the

registration is liable to be cancelled, as alleged by the plaintiff, or not, as
contended by the defendant, is not a matter for consideration before this
court. For the present, in view of section 31 of the said Act, the registration
of the trade mark is prima facie evidence of its validity. So, considering the
defendant’s registration to be valid, for the time being, it must be kept in
mind that the mark RANATOR is registered in class 19 and not class 6.
The plaintiff has brought this suit claiming its exclusive right to the use of
the trade mark RANA in relation to “steel rolled products, CTD bars,
angles, flats, rounds, channels and girders” falling under class 6 of the
Fourth Schedule to the Trade Marks Rules, 2002.

1

The defendant,

“6. Common metals and their alloys; metal building materials; transportable buildings of
metal; materials of metal for railway tracks; non-electric cables and wires of common metal;
ironmongery, small items of metal hardware; pipes and tubes of metal; safes; goods of
common metal not included in other classes; ores.”

2

The plaintiff has filed a rectification application under section 57 of the said Act before the
Intellectual Property Appellate Board, Chennai seeking cancellation/removal of the
defendant’s registration on various grounds. The application was filed 11.09.2007, after the
filing of the written statement in this case. It is alleged by the plaintiff that it became aware
of the defendant’s said registration only upon reading the written statement. The said
application is pending.

“19. Building materials (non-metallic), non-metallic rigid pipes for building; asphalt, pitch
and bitumen; non-metallic transportable buildings; monument, not of metal.”

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.25 of 34

admittedly, does not have any registration in class 6 (its registration being
under class 19). Therefore, the situation which presents itself in the case at
hand

is similar to the situation explained in Example 2 above.

Consequently, neither is section 28(3) attracted nor can the defendant take
refuge under section 30(2)(e).

26.

In Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai

Patel: (2006) 8 SCC 726 ( at page 754), the Supreme Court observed that
the purpose of a trade mark is to establish a connection between the goods
and the source thereof which would suggest the quality of goods and that if
the trade mark is registered, indisputably the user thereof by a person who is
not otherwise authorised to do so would constitute infringement. It was
further noted that a proprietor of a registered trade mark indisputably has a
statutory right thereto. In the event of such use by any person other than the
person in whose name the trade mark is registered, he will have a statutory
remedy in terms of Section 29 of the 1958 Act. The registration of the trade
mark RANA in relation to “steel rolled products, CTD bars, angles, flats,
rounds, channels and girders” falling under class 6 has established a
connection between such goods and the plaintiff who manufactures them.
Whenever such goods are found in the market and they bear the mark
RANA, the prospective consumer connects the goods with the source, that
is, the plaintiff (RANA STEELS). If another person such as the defendant
uses the same mark or a similar mark in relation to the very same goods

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.26 of 34

(steel rolled products, CTD bars, angles, flats, rounds, channels and
girders falling under class 6) then, that would be seen as an interference and
an attempt at breaking the connection between the goods bearing the mark
RANA and the source, the plaintiff. In such a situation, the plaintiff would
have the statutory remedy of seeking injunction for preventing further
infringement.

27.

The plaintiff has certainly established a prima facie case in its

favour. Because of registration and by virtue of section 28 (1) of the said
Act, an exclusive right of using the trade mark RANA has been conferred
upon the plaintiff in relation to steel rolled products, CTD bars, angles,
flats, rounds, channels and girders falling under class 6. And, such right is
absolute [see: Ramdev Food Products (supra)(para 83)]. As observed in
Ramdev Food Products (supra)(para 82), what is needed by way of cause
of action for filing a suit of infringement of trade mark is use of a
deceptively similar mark which may not be identical. It was contended on
behalf of the plaintiff that the marks RANA and RANATOR are identical
inasmuch as TOR is merely descriptive of a kind of high strength steel.
While this may be debatable, there cannot be any escape from the fact that
RANATOR is deceptively similar to RANA. It is interesting to note that
though the defendant’s registration under class 19 is in respect of the trade
mark RANATOR used as one word, the defendant has been using it in the
form of two words RANA TOR. This clearly signifies the defendant’s

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.27 of 34

intention to break up the mark RANATOR into RANA and TOR. It is this
separation of RANA and TOR which, in fact, lays emphasis on the mark
RANA because the other word TOR, as is commonly understood, is merely
descriptive of a type of steel. The moment this happens there is every
possibility that the mark RANA TOR used by the defendant is confused by
the public at large with the plaintiff’s registered trade mark RANA which is
used for the plaintiff’s TOR steel products.

28.

The balance of convenience is also in favour of the plaintiff.

The plaintiff’s user is since 1993.
14.12.1994.

Its registration relates back to

As discussed above the plaintiff has been extensively

advertising its products under the said mark RANA in Punjab Kesari
(04.11.1993 & 21.10.1993 and 1994), Amar Ujala (1993-94), Hindi
Magazine Parvat Piyush (September, 2006), TV advertisements in Sun TV
channel at Chennai (March, 2006). On the other hand, the defendant’s
alleged user (even as per its own admission in its application for
registration) is from the year 2001 and its registration under class 19 relates
back to 26.04.2001. Even the user of the mark by the defendant after 2001
is suspect. This aspect will be discussed in some detail later.

The

defendant’s name is RAN India Steels Pvt Ltd and it sold its products
(including TOR steel) under the mark RAN. There appears to be no
reasonable cause for its subsequent adoption of the mark RANA TOR when
the mark RANA was already being used by the plaintiff and for the

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.28 of 34

registration of which the plaintiff’s application was pending since
14.12.1994. Then, there is the circumstance of the defendant not opposing
the plaintiff’s application for registration in relation to goods under class 6
but, in applying for registration of the mark RANATOR in class 19. The
plaintiff has a valid registration in relation to steel rolled products, CTD
bars, angles, flats, rounds, channels and girders falling under class 6. The
defendant has a registration under class 19 but not in relation to steel rolled
products, CTD bars, angles, flats, rounds, channels and girders falling
under class 6. It is obvious, that it is the plaintiff’s statutory right which
requires protection and not the defendant’s improper use of the mark RANA
TOR in relation to steel rolled products, CTD bars, angles, flats, rounds,
channels and girders falling under class 6. The balance of convenience is
clearly in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant. Furthermore, in
an infringement action, when the plaintiff has demonstrated that it has a
prima facie case and also that the balance of convenience lies in its favour,
not granting an interim injunction restraining the defendant from further
infringing the plaintiff’s registered trade mark would result in causing
irreparable injury to the plaintiff.

29.

For all these reasons, even de hors the question of passing off, I

am of the view that the plaintiff is entitled to an order confirming the ex
parte injunction dated 14.08.2007, though, with a slight modification. The
said order was in respect of “metal building materials, pipes, tubes of steel

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.29 of 34

which include rods, flats, pipes, angles and building steels made of mild
steel and related/ allied products”. But, as noted above the plaintiff’s
registration is only in relation to “steel rolled products, CTD bars, angles,
flats, rounds, channels and girders falling under class 6”. Consequently,
the plaintiff is entitled to an interim injunction order only in respect of
“steel rolled products, CTD bars, angles, flats, rounds, channels and
girders falling under class 6”.

Suppression:
30.

It has been submitted on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff

had deliberately withheld and suppressed the factum of the defendant’s
registration from this court and that had the full facts been disclosed, this
court would not have granted the ex parte ad interim injunction to the
plaintiff. Suppression of facts is undoubtedly a good ground for refusal of
the equitable relief of injunction. That is a principle which is well
engrained in our judicial system. But, the question is -- was there any
suppression on the part of the plaintiff? First of all, the plaintiff’s
explanation is that the defendant’s registration was in an entirely different
class of goods with which the plaintiff is not concerned. Secondly, the
plaintiff was not aware of the defendants registration under class 19. It,
apparently, came to know of the same through the defendant’s written
statement filed in the present suit. Prima facie, I would tend to believe the
plaintiff. There are reasons for this. It must be remembered that in 2005 the

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.30 of 34

defendant had also filed and application for registration of the mark RANA
TOR under class 6. The plaintiff filed an opposition to the same. In the
counter-statement to the plaintiff’s said opposition, the defendant made no
mention that it had applied for the same mark in relation to goods falling
under class 19. The plaintiff was interested in goods and services under
class 6 and not under other classes including class 19. Therefore, it is not
unreasonable for the plaintiff to have not known about the defendant’s
registration under class 19. Moreover, after the filing of the written
statement, from which the plaintiff allegedly derived knowledge of the
defendant’s registration, the plaintiff has filed a rectification application
under section 57 of the said Act before the Intellectual Property Appellate
Board, Chennai seeking cancellation/removal of the defendant’s registration
on various grounds. These actions, the filing of the opposition to the
defendant’s application in relation to class 6 goods and the filing of the
rectification application, clearly demonstrate that the plaintiff is quick to
guard its rights flowing from its registration. The sequitur is that the
plaintiff was unaware of the defendant’s said registration and could not
have reasonably been expected to have known about it.

Defendant’s conduct:
31.

In Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd v. Coca Cola Company: (1995) 5

SCC 545 (para 47), the Supreme Court, in the context of an application
under Order 39 Rule 4 for vacating a temporary injunction, observed:-

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.31 of 34

“Under Order 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with an order of
interlocutory or temporary injunction is purely equitable
and, therefore, the Court, on being approached, will, apart
from other considerations, also look to the conduct of the
party invoking the jurisdiction of the Court, and may refuse
to interfere unless his conduct was free from blame. Since
the relief is wholly equitable in nature, the party invoking
the jurisdiction of the Court has to show that he himself
was not at fault and that he himself was not responsible for
bringing about the state of things complained of and that
he was not unfair or inequitable in his dealings with the
party against whom he was seeking relief. His conduct
should be fair and honest. These considerations will arise
not only in respect of the person who seeks an order of
injunction under Order 39 Rule 1 or Rule 2 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, but also in respect of the party
approaching the Court for vacating the ad interim or
temporary injunction order already granted in the pending
suit or proceedings.”
32.

The defendant has moved the application under Order 39 Rule 4

for vacating the ex parte ad interim injunction granted in favour of the
plaintiff. So, the defendant’s conduct is as much under the scanner as is the
plaintiff’s. This takes me to the consideration of the invoice-cum-delivery
challans filed by the defendant with the object of, perhaps, showing user of
the mark 'RANA TOR' since 2001. It has been noticed by me in the earlier
part of this judgment that the defendant has filed such challans for the
period 16.04.2000 to 24.07.2007 at pages 1 to 210 of the defendant’s
documents. In the challans prior to May, 2001 there is no mention of the
marks RANA or RANATOR. In the challans for the period May, 2001 to
June, 2004, the expression “(RANA TOR TESTED)” is apparently printed
subsequently and using a different printing device. This becomes clear on

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.32 of 34

comparing the challans for this period with the challans for July, 2004
onwards where the said expression appears to have been printed
contemporaneously with the other matter filled therein and using the same
printing device. By way of illustrative samples, photographs of challans for
the periods May, 2001 – June, 2004 and July, 2004 onwards are given
below:

Photograph 1 [sample of an invoice-cum-delivery
challan during May, 2001 – June, 2004]

Photograph 2 [sample of an invoice-cum-delivery
challan during July, 2004 onwards]

IA No. 9165/2007 & IA 10779/2007 in CS(OS)1459/2006

Page No.33 of 34

33.

These photographs reveal that the expression “(RANA TOR

TESTED)” is apparently superimposed and in different typeface in
photograph 1. Whereas in photograph 2, the said expression and the rest of
the typed matter match in ribbon intensity, alignment as well as in typeface.
This does give rise to grave suspicion as regards the challans for the period
May, 2001 to June, 2004. Perhaps there is a plausible reason for this, but,
none was forthcoming on the part of the defendant in the course of
arguments. However, as I have already concluded that the plaintiff is
entitled to interim injunction, I shall not dwell on this matter further at this
stage and leave the matter to be conclusively dealt with at the trial stage.

Conclusion:
34.

The ex parte injunction granted on 14.08.2007 is confirmed till

the disposal of the suit, though, with the modification that the injunction
would be only in respect of “steel rolled products, CTD bars, angles, flats,
rounds, channels and girders falling under class 6”. I.A. 9165/2007 (under
Order 39 Rules 1 & 2, CPC) stands allowed to this extent. I.A. 10779/2007
(under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC) is dismissed. The parties shall bear their own
costs.
