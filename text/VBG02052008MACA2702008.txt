V.B.Gupta, J.
The present appeal has been filed by National
Insurance Ltd. against the Interim Award passed under
section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short as
the “Act”) dated 12.03.08, by Dr. T.R. Naval, Judge, Motor
Accident

Claims

Tribunal

(for

short

as

“Tribunal”),

Karkardooma, Shahdara, Delhi.
2.

Brief facts are that on 11.02.07, the deceased Sh.

Umesh Kumar was going on his cycle, when he reached at
National Highway No. 24, near Toll Tax, Gazipur, Delhi, the
offending

Truck

bearing

no.

RJ-14-2G-7677

hit

the

deceased from the back side resulting in his death. The
accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the
truck driver.

3.

Appellant in its written statement admitted that

offending vehicle was insured with it vide insurance policy
which was valid for the period 26.04.06 to 25.04.07.
4.

Vide impugned order, the Ld. Tribunal has granted

interim compensation of Rs.50,000/- along with interest @
7% per annum from the date of filing of the petition i.e.
21.03.07 till realization against the appellant.
5.

It has been contended by Ld. Counsel for the

Appellant that the Ld. Tribunal has not considered the fact
that in the Criminal Record filed by the Police authorities,
it has been clearly mentioned after investigation, that at
the time of alleged accident, the driver of the offending
vehicle/truck was not having any Driving licence. Further,
the liability to pay the said interim award should had been
on the owner of the offending vehicle as he has breached
the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy, by
deliberately appointing the driver who did not possess any
licence.

6.

PW-1 Smt. Raj Bala, who is mother of the deceased,

has deposed before the Tribunal that deceased, Sh. Umesh
Kumar died due to road accident on 11.02.07 caused by
offending

vehicle.

It

was

also

established

by

other

documents i.e. FIR bearing No. 97/2007 dated 11.02.07,
P.S. Kalyan Puri and the postmortem report which contain
the cause of death as hemorrhage and shock consequent
upon blunt force impact to the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
7.

Section 140 of the Act provides for liability to pay

compensation in certain cases on the principle on no fault.
It read as under;
“140. Liability to pay compensation in
certain cases on the principle of no
fault.(1) Where death or permanent disablement
of any person has resulted from an accident
arising out of the use of a motor vehicle or
motor vehicles, the owner of the vehicle
shall, or, as the case may be, the owners of
the vehicles shall, jointly and severally, be
liable to pay compensation in respect of
such death or disablement in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
MAC App No.270/2008

(3) In any claim for compensation under
sub-section (1), the claimant shall not be
required to plead and establish that the
death or permanent disablement in respect
of which the claim has been made was due
to any wrongful act, neglect or default of the
owner or owners of the vehicle or vehicles
concerned or of any other person.
(4) A claim for compensation under subsection (1) shall not be defeated by reason
of any wrongful act, neglect or default of the
person in respect of whose death or
permanent disablement the claim has been
made
nor
shall
the
quantum
of
compensation recoverable in respect of such
death or permanent disablement be reduced
on the basis of the share of such person in
the responsibility for such death or
permanent disablement.”

8.

For getting interim relief under section 140 of the

Act, the Tribunal is only required to see primafacie the
factum of accident involving the offending vehicle and
factum of death of the person in the road accident.
9.

The order of the Tribunal shows that the claimants

while seeking the relief under section 140 of the Act have
MAC App No.270/2008

Page 5 of 11

filed copy of FIR and post-mortem report.

In FIR, the

number of the vehicle involved in the accident is clearly
mentioned. In view of this, the Tribunal has come to a

prima facie finding that the vehicle was involved in the
accident.
10.

As regards the contention raised by Ld. Counsel for

the Appellant that the Driver had no valid licence and
therefore insurance company cannot be directed to pay
interim compensation, the Apex Court while discussing the
question as regards the liability of the owner vis-à-vis the
driver being not possessed of a valid licence has observed
in National Insurance Company Limited v. Swaran
Singh and Others, (2004) 3 SCC 297 as under ;
“ In each case, on evidence led before the
claim Tribunal, a decision has to be taken
whether the fact of the driver possessing
licence for one type of vehicle but found
driving another type of vehicle, was the main
or contributory cause of accident. If on facts,
it is found that the accident was caused
solely because of some other unforeseen or
intervening causes like mechanical failures
MAC App No.270/2008

Page 6 of 11

and similar other causes having no nexus
with the driver not possessing requisite type
of licence, the insurer will not be allowed to
avoid its liability merely for technical breach
of conditions concerning driving licence.”
11. In view of the above decision, the contention of the
Appellant regarding the Driving Licence at this stage is not
sustainable. Further, according to the written statement,
appellant itself is not sure as to whether the driver of the
offending vehicle was having a driving licence or not at the
time of accident, as in the, written statement it is stated
that;
“In case, it is found that at the time of the

alleged accident the alleged Driver driving
the alleged offending VEHICLE NO.RJ-142G-7677 was either not holding proper,
effective & valid Driving Licence, required
under M.V. Act, 1988 and the Rules made
thereunder to drive the said vehicle
because it is a breach of the terms and
conditions of the relevant Insurance Policy
with respect to the persons and classes of
persons entitled to drive the said vehicle
involved.”

MAC App No.270/2008

12.

So, whether the driver of the offending vehicle was

having a valid Driving licence or not, is a matter of
evidence which is yet to be gone into by the Trial Court and
these pleas can be raised at the time of final arguments
and not at the stage of interim relief.
13.

There is no manner of doubt that section140 of the

Act is a beneficial and social welfare piece of legislation. It
is well settled that in construing social welfare legislation,
the Courts should adopt a beneficial rule of construction
and in any event, that construction should be preferred
which fulfills the policy of legislation. The construction to
be adopted on a statue should be such so as to achieve the
purposes for which it is enacted and in favour of those in
whose interest the Act has been passed.
14.

The provisions contained under section 140 of the Act

were brought in the statute book to grant interim relief to
the victim of an accident or his dependant/s by way of an
interim

compensation.

MAC App No.270/2008

This

obviously

is

a

beneficial
Page 8 of 11

provision to give relief to a person who has suffered
grievous injury or to the dependants of a victim who are
left without a bread earner. The object thereof cannot be
permitted to be frustrated. Of course, if the vehicle in
question is not insured at all, the question of making the
insurer liable would not arise. But, the insurer cannot, by
raising all possible pleas, avoid payment of interim
compensation

and

thereby

defeat

the

object

of

the

provision.
15.

There was no occasion for the insurance company to

file the present appeal. National Insurance Company Ltd.,
being a Government undertaking should have taken a
sympathetic view in the matter and should not have filed
blindly the present appeal so as to deprive the dependants
of road accident victim, solace and little comfort by way of
meager monetary amount which they are entitled under
the law. The Government undertaking must have human
approach in such like matters and should not indulge in the
MAC App No.270/2008

Page 9 of 11

jugglery of legal provision so as to deprive the unfortunate
victims of their legal dues. It is hoped that the appellant
would take special care in such like matters and would not
file appeals on frivolous and flimsy grounds so as to
deprive the victims of road accident who had lost their sole
bread earner.
16.

In

the

present

case,

appeal

filed

by

National

Insurance Co. Ltd., which is public sector undertaking, is
nothing but an abuse of the process of law. A perusal of the
impugned order goes to show that the Tribunal arrived at
the appellant’s liability to pay interim compensation on the
basis of oral as well as documentary evidence on record.
Therefore, there is no scope to challenge the impugned
order.
17. The present appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs
of Rs.5,000/-.

Appellant is directed to deposit the cost by way of a

cheque in the name of Registrar General of this Court
within four weeks from today.
