1.

By this judgment, I propose to dispose of the present suit

filed under the provisions of Order 37 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 seeking a recovery of Rs. 21,38,158/- by the
summary procedure.

The claim is based on dishonouring of

twenty cheques issued by the defendant which were for the total
sum of Rs. 14,81,000/- and interest thereon to the extent of Rs.
6,57,158/-.
2.

The defendant could not be served by ordinary process and

by registered cover despite efforts in this behalf. Accordingly,
CS(OS) 430/2005

page 1 of 12

service on the defendant was effected by the alternative mode by
issuance of a proclamation under Order 5 Rule 20 of the Code of
Civil Procedure.

The summons were published in the Delhi

Edition of the Statesmen dated 8th August, 2006. The service was
accepted as adequate service by the order dated 24th August, 2006.
Inasmuch as the defendant failed to enter appearance, the matter
was placed before this court on the 6th of October, 2006.
3.

For failure to enter appearance in accordance with law, in

accordance with the provisions of Order 37 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, this court ought to have proceeded to judgment.
However, perusal of the record shows that the cheques which were
the basis of the present suit were not filed in original, on the plea
that the same stand filed in proceedings taken by the plaintiff
against the defendant under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, in the Court of the learned Metropolitan
Magistrate.

In these circumstances, by order passed on 6th

October, 2006, it was observed that the negotiable instruments
which were the basis of the suit had to produced or proved on
record in accordance with law. In these circumstances, in the
absence of the original documents, the plaintiff was directed to file
its examination in chief on affidavit in support of its case and
given liberty to summon the records from the concerned courts to
CS(OS) 430/2005

page 2 of 12

prove the documents relied upon.
4.

In compliance with the order passed by this Court on 6th

October, 2006 the plaintiff filed his own affidavit and also
summoned the records of the cases pending in the various courts
where the plaintiff had filed complaints under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act.
5.

The defendant has remained unrepresented and has failed to

contest the suit claimed.
I find that the suit is premised on the plea that the defendant
as a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountant of India had
claimed to be engaged in portfolio advisory and consultancy
services and developed such a relationship with the plaintiff. The
plaintiff consequently entrusted to the defendant, in two lots
shares worth a total sum of Rs.22,26,061/- firstly in April and
Secondly in October, 2000 for their management by him. The
defendant undertook to pay to the plaintiff a minimum guarantee
return @ 24% per annum payable every month. Any amount in
excess of the returns over 24% p.a. was agreed to be shared
equally between the parties. After October, 2000, the defendant
defaulted in payment of the returns and consequently the plaintiff
demanded return of his shares.
6.

The matter was resolved when the parties entered into an

CS(OS) 430/2005

page 3 of 12

agreement of liability and schedule of payment dated 7th July,
2001. The defendant confirmed entrustment of the shares worth
Rs.22,26,061/- and the agreement that a minimum guarantee
return of 24% would be paid by the defendant in this agreement.
The defendant also confirmed that the minimum guarantee
returns totalling approximately Rs.4,80,000/- as on 31st August,
2001 were due and payable to the plaintiff.

Defendant also

confirmed that return @ 24% per annum on Rs.22,26,061/- were
payable to the plaintiff. By this agreement, the defendant agreed
to remit these amounts to the plaintiff in 12 equal installments
commencing from 31st August, 2001.

The defendant also agreed

to give a promissory note supported by post dated cheques for the
full amount which were to be drawn on a joint account to be
opened by the defendant with the plaintiff. The cheques were to
be issued latest by 30th July, 2001 while interest @ 1% p.a. was
agreed to be paid by the defendant on delayed payment.

The

defendant also undertook to transfer shares which have been
listed in this agreement to the plaintiff in 10 approximately equal
monthly lots starting from 31st of August, 2001. The parties had
agreed that either the share themselves or equivalent value to be
paid through demand draft payable in Delhi was to be paid to be
plaintiff.

Valuing the shares at the average of the share values

CS(OS) 430/2005

page 4 of 12

prevailing during the calender year 2001, the parties had agreed to
take the average of the share value till 31st July, 2001.
7.

It is noteworthy that the shares have been listed in this

agreement which is exhibit PW.1/1, the parties had agreed that the
defendant would prepare the final accounts statement and hand
over the same to the plaintiff by the 29th July, 2001. In case of any
further payment to be made to the plaintiff on account of trading
profits which had been agreed to be shared equally by both
parties, the schedule for the same was required to be worked out
and suitably documented.
8.

The defendant also executed a promise in writing dated 28th

July, 2001, to transfer to the plaintiff shares in different
companies obtained approximately equal monthly loss which has
been set out in the promise and included the following:"PROMISSORY NOTE TO BE DISCHARGED IN

The defendant also promised to pay to the plaintiff the sum

of Rs. 40,000/- per month without interest commencing from the
31st of August, 2001 and each succeeding installment without
interest thereon to be paid on the last day of each following month
till payment of the sum of Rs. 4,80,000/-. In case of any one of
the installment being in arrear for three days, the said installment
of Rs. 40,000/- would become payable immediately with interest
thereon at the rate of 1% p.m. till payment.
10.

In addition to the above, the defendant issued to the plaintiff

CS(OS) 430/2005

page 6 of 12

as security for discharge of this liability, twenty post dated
cheques drawn on the State Bank of Hyderabad, Kailash Colony,
New Delhi. The defendant defaulted in its promise to transfer the
shares. He also repeatedly requested the plaintiff not to present
the cheques on the ground that he was in the process of arranging
funds and would inform the plaintiff as to when the cheques
should be presented. The plaintiff deferred presentation of the
cheques till February, 2002 and then, realising that he was being
taken for a ride, the plaintiff first presented for collection a group
of cheques on 4th February, 2002 and thereafter the remaining
cheques from time to time.

The cheques when tendered for

honouring to the drawee bank, were all dishonoured by the State
Bank of Hyderabad, Kailash Colony, New Delhi on the ground of
insufficiency of funds. The first dishonouring took place on 5th of
February, 2002.
11.

The plaintiff has established on record that he served upon

the defendant notices demanding the amount of the dishonoured
cheques by registered acknowledgment due course as well as by
UPC at the two known addresses. The details of the cheques, their
date and amounts as also the dates of their dishonouring and the
dates of the notices are referred as follows:-

In these circumstances, the defendant has failed to pay the

CS(OS) 430/2005

page 9 of 12

amount of Rs. 14,81,000/- which was the amount of the
dishonoured cheques.
13.

The plaintiff has also urged in the plaint that in terms of

Section 80 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the plaintiff is
entitled to interest calculated at the rate of 18% p.a. from the date
of the cheque till payment of the amount. It works out to an
amount of Rs. 6,57,158/- till the date of filing of the suit.
14.

It is noteworthy that the plaintiff has summoned the records

of the various complaints filed by him under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 before the court of the
Magistrate wherein the originals of the cheques as well as the bank
slips giving the reasons for the dishonouring of the cheques by the
drawee bank as well as the cheque deposit slip, legal notices, the
postal receipts, A.D. Cards as well as the envelopes which were
returned back as unclaimed were filed in the criminal complaint.
Certified copies thereof have been placed before this court which
were exhibited in accordance with law upon summoning of the
record of the complaint including the afore-noticed documents.
The plaintiff in this manner has proved the agreement and the
promises by the defendant as Exhibit PW1/1 to PW1/3; Certified
copies of the twenty cheques as Exhibit PW1/4 to PW1/23;
Certificate dated 15th February, 2005 issued by the State Bank of
CS(OS) 430/2005

page 10 of 12

Hyderabad regarding the date of deposit of the cheque as Exhibit
PW1/24; the memos issued by the bank giving the reasons for the
dishonouring of the cheques as Exhibit PW1/25 to PW1/40;
Certified copies of the cheque deposit slips as Exhibit PW1/41 to
PW1/43; the certified copies of the legal notices have been proved
as Exhibit PW1/44 to PW1/53; the registered acknowledgment
due postal slip as Exhibit PW1/54 to PW1/63; the UPC certificates
as Exhibit PW1/64 to PW1/73; the certified copies of the
envelopes received back as unclaimed as Exhibit PW1/74 to
PW1/81 and the AD cards as Exhibit PW1/82 to PW1/86.
15.

Undoubtedly, by virtue of the provisions of Rule 3 Order 37

of the Code of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff was entitled to bring
and maintain the present suit and have the same adjudicated by
the summary procedure provided under Order 37 of the Code of
Civil Procedure. However, in the facts and circumstances of the
case and for the afore-noticed reasons, the plaintiff was required
to prove its case by leading evidence. The claim and evidence of
the

plaintiff

is

unrebutted

and

undisputed.

In

these

circumstances, there can be no manner of doubt that the plaintiff
had adequately established its case. The defendant has clearly and
unequivocally admitted its liability in the agreement, promises
afore-noticed as also the cheques which have been issued by him
CS(OS) 430/2005

page 11 of 12

which stand dishonoured.
16.

There can also be no disputing the liability of the defendant

to pay interest on the amount of cheques which he has wrongfully
deprived the plaintiff of. The defendant has also agreed to make
payment of interest in the agreement noticed hereinabove.
However, the plaintiff has confined its claim of interest to the
interest payable under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. In
these circumstances, the plaintiff would be entitled to the amount
of interest to the tune of Rs. 6,57,158/- as prayed for.
17.

Accordingly, I hereby pass a decree for recovery in favour of

the plaintiff against the defendant for a sum of Rs. 21,38,158/-.
The plaintiff shall also be entitled to pendente lite and future
interest at the rate of 12% per annum with effect from 1st of
February, 2005 till payment.
The plaintiff would be entitled to the cost of the suit which
are quantified at Rs. 60,000/-.
