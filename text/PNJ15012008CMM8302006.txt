PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Heard for disposal.

2.

Petitioner impleaded as a defendant in a summary

suit is aggrieved by the order dated 8.10.2003 declining leave
to defend.
3.

It is urged by learned counsel for the petitioner that

in the instant case the issue of grant of leave to defend had to
be considered with reference to the claim in the plaint for the
Page 1 of 7

sum due under the various bills raised by the plaintiff and
separately with respect to the claim for interest as laid in the
suit.
4.

A perusal of the plaint (copy at pages 60-67 of the

record of the instant petition) shows that respondent filed a
suit claiming decree in sum of Rs.8 lacs with pendente lite and
future interest @ 24% per annum. The basis of the suit was a
written acknowledgement by the defendant.
5.

Facts leading to the written acknowledgment by the

defendant as stated in the plaint were that the parties had
commercial dealings whereunder plaintiff was supplying C.R.
Steel strips to the defendant at agreed rates and that a running
account was maintained by the parties.
6.

In para 4 and 5 of the plaint it was stated that as per

statement of accounts maintained by the plaintiff, as of
31.3.2001, a sum of Rs.7,97,540/- was due and payable by the
defendant.
defendant

The said statement of accounts was sent to the
for

reconciliation

and

in

response

defendant

informed that payments made to the plaintiff in sum of
Rs.80,215/- and Rs.55,466/- by means of cheques had not been
accounted for in the statement of account maintained by the
plaintiff.

Additionally, with respect to credit notes in sum of

Rs.1,56,905/- and Rs.9,022/- it was stated that the statement
Page 2 of 7

of accounts furnished by the plaintiff did not give effect to said
entries.

Accordingly, it was stated in the plaint that after

tallying the accounts defendant admitted in writing the liability
to pay Rs.5,26,398/-.
7.

In para 6 of the plaint it was stated that to clear the

aforesaid liability defendant paid Rs.50,000/- on 3.9.2001.
Thus, it was stated that amount balance due and payable was
in sum of Rs.4,76,398/-.
8.

It was further stated in the plaint that having

acknowledged liability in sum of Rs.5,26,398/- as per statement
of account maintained by the defendant and having paid
Rs.50,000/- to partially clear the liability, defendant turned
dishonest when it sent a letter dated 10.3.2002 alleging that
the plaintiff had been overcharging it. The defendant claimed
to have been overcharged in sum of Rs.3,63,774/-.

It was

further pleaded that the defendant unilaterally reduced the
amount payable by deducting Rs.3,63,774/- and sent post
dated

cheques

in

the

balance

sum

i.e.

Rs.1,12,623/-.

According to the plaintiff it refuted the said letter to the
defendant. In para 10 of the plaint it was stated that a cheque
in sum of Rs.20,000/- which was dated 15.6.2002 had become
payable in the meanwhile. That the plaintiff encashed the said
cheque.

The plaintiff thus reduced the amount due and
Page 3 of 7

payable by further sum of Rs.20,000/-. In para 10 of the plaint
it was stated that Rs.4,56,398/- remained due and payable.
9.

Stating that interest @ 24% per annum was agreed

to be paid by the defendant, plaintiff calculated interest at said
rate for the pre suit period. As per averments made in para 11
amount towards interest was stated to Rs.3,43,602/-. In this
manner suit amount claim was Rs.8 lacs.
10.

The

basis

of

the

suit

was

the

written

acknowledgment of the defendant in respect to amount shown
as payable in the statement of account maintained by the
defendant.
11.

Seeking leave to defend it was stated by the

defendant that the plaintiff had been overcharging it and this
fact

came

to

their notice belatedly.

For said

reason

notwithstanding having admitted liability to pay Rs.4,56,398/when the accounts were reconciled, defendant was entitled to
a credit adjustment in sum of Rs.3,63,774/-.
12.

Declining leave to defend, learned Trial Judge has

held that these being commercial transactions defendant
would be presumed to know the market rates. It has been held
that having accepted the goods and the bills, defendant could
not, after a long period of time, turn around and question the
rate charged in the bills.
Page 4 of 7

13.

Thus, leave to defend has been declined.

14.

In respect of the interest component it may be

noted that the learned Trial Judge has not dealt with this issue
at all.
15.

The suit under Order 37 has to be drafted strictly

within the confines of Order 37. A claim for pre suit interest
has to be within the confines of Order 37 of the Code of Civil
Procedure.
16.

In the instant case claim for pre suit interest was

based on the following averments in the plaint:“11. That as already stated above, the Defendant
further agreed and undertook to pay interest @ 25%
per annum after the credit period of 30 days as
aforesaid and an amount of Rs.3,43,602.00 (Rupees
three lacs forty three thousand six hundred two only)
is due from the Defendant to the Plaintiff on account
of overdue interest, thereby making a total of
Rs.8,00,000.00 (Rupees eight lacs only).”
17.

Suffice would it be to state that it was not stated in

the plaint as to what was the written document on which
plaintiff alleged that the defendant agreed to undertake to pay
interest @ 24% per annum.
18.
case

Thus, pertaining to the claim for pre suit interest,
was

undoubtedly

made

out

for

the

grant

of

an

unconditional leave to defend.
19.

Pertaining to the claim in the suit for Rs.4,56,398/-,

Page 5 of 7

suffice would it be to state that even in the application seeking
leave to defend defendant did not join issue with the plaintiff
that on reconciliation of the accounts it admitting liability to
pay Rs.5,26,398/- and thereafter paid Rs.70,000/- leaving a net
balance of Rs.4,56,398/-. But it was stated that thereafter it
dawned upon the defendant that the plaintiff was overcharging
it.

The defence raised was that defendant was entitled to

Rs.3,43,602/- as discount.
20.

The defence predicated viz-a-viz the sum due and

payable under the main bills is prima facie an after thought
and probably intended to resile from the acknowledgment.
21.

As reasoned in the impugned order, defendant is in

business. It is expected that the defendant knew the market
rate.
22.

Thus, plaintiff has to be secured the said amount.

The defendant has to secure the said amount to the plaintiff.
23.

The petition accordingly stands disposed of setting

aside the impugned order.

Defendant's application seeking

leave to defend is allowed on the term of deposit of
Rs.4,56,398/- with the learned Trial Judge. The deposit

could

be in cash or by means of a fixed deposit receipt in the name
of learned Trial Judge. If in cash the amount would be left in a
fixed deposit. If in FDR, same would be kept renewed.

24.

Subject to deposit being made as aforedirected

within 6 weeks from today, defendant's application seeking
leave to defend stands allowed.
25.

No costs.
