The revision petition has been filed in respect of the order on charge
dated 19.09.2005 passed by the Special Judge, NDPS, New Delhi
whereby he came to the conclusion that the recovery of the contraband
was of a small quantity and that the case was triable by a Magistrate.
Accordingly, he sent the file to the learned ACMM, Patiala House
Courts, New Delhi for trial and disposal of the case as per law. The
appeal has been filed against the judgment dated 22.11.2005 as also the
order on sentence of the same date passed by the learned ACMM, New
Delhi.

2.

A few important facts need to be stated at the outset. After

the passing of the order on charge dated 19.09.2005 (which is the subject
matter of the revision petition), the matter was heard and tried by the
learned ACMM. The respondent / accused pleaded guilty to the charge
under Sections 20 (b) (ii) (A) / 23 (a) read with Section 27 of the
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter
referred to as 'the NDPS Act'). On the accused pleading guilty, the
learned ACMM convicted him of the said offences on 22.11.2005. The
order on sentence of the same date was to the effect that the respondent's
sentence was limited to the period already undergone by him in custody

CRLREVP 844/05 & CRLA 671/06

Page No.2 of 11

(three months and seven days) coupled with a fine of Rs 10,000/- under
Section 20 (b) (ii) (A) of the NDPS Act. The respondent paid the fine of
Rs 10,000/-. The respondent was a Swiss national and his passport had
earlier been impounded. On having undergone the aforesaid sentence
and fine, the respondent's passport was released by an order of the
learned ACMM on 24.11.2005. Thereafter, the respondent left for his
home country—Switzerland.

3.

It is pertinent to note that the order on charge was passed on

19.09.2005, but the revision petition was filed only on 26.11.2005, after
the order of conviction and sentence had been passed by the learned
ACMM on 22.11.2005. The appeal itself was filed, admittedly, beyond
84 days of the prescribed period.

As such, a condonation of delay

application was filed alongwith the appeal. I shall refer to the same later.

4.

Briefly stated the facts of the case are that on 08.04.2005, the

respondent, a Swiss passport holder, arrived at IGI Airport, New Delhi
by Flight No. RA-217 from Kathmandu and was to catch Flight No.BA142 for Zurich via London. While the accused was waiting for his
onward flight in the Customs Departure Hall, he was stopped by the

CRLREVP 844/05 & CRLA 671/06

Page No.3 of 11

complainant who called two independent witnesses and in their presence
the respondent was asked whether he was carrying any narcotic drug or
psychotropic substances. He answered in the negative. Thereafter, a
search of his checked-in baggage was carried out in terms of the
provisions of the NDPS Act. The checked-in bag was found locked and
the accused / respondent opened the lock with his key. Besides other
things, a bag contained 6 packets of agarbattis (incense sticks) branded
as “Satya Masala Chandan Agarbatti” were found. Four of the packets
did contain agarbattis (incense sticks). The other two packets, however,
were found to contain black polythene bags. On opening the black
polythene bags, it was found that there was some substance wrapped in
the pages of a Nepalese newspaper—“Himalayan Times”.

On

unwrapping them, they were found to contain a black substance wrapped
in transparent polythene capsules.

One hundred such capsules were

found. A small quantity of the black substance was taken out from the
capsules and after homogeneously mixing the same, it was tested with
the field drug testing kit which gave a positive result for narcotic drugs.
On being questioned, the accused / respondent informed that the black
substance in the capsules was 'hashish'. The weight of the 100 capsules,
which purported to be 'hashish', was 500 grams as determined by the

CRLREVP 844/05 & CRLA 671/06

Page No.4 of 11

electronic weighing machine. Since hashish is banned and prohibited
under the NDPS Act, the same was liable for confiscation.

The

complainant seized the entire 500 grams of the substance, which
purported to be hashish, under Section 42 of the NDPS Act. Thereafter,
he took two samples of 25 grams each from a homogeneous mixture of
the seized substance. The samples were packed separately in envelopes
marked S-1 and S-2 respectively. The sample marked S-1 was to be sent
to the Central Revenue Control Laboratory (CRCL), New Delhi. The
sample marked S-2 was to be sent to the warehouse.

Thereafter, a

panchnama was drawn on the spot and the accused / respondent was
arrested on 09.04.2005. The sample marked S-1 alongwith the test memo
was deposited in the CRCL. The report of the CRCL was collected and
on completion of investigation, the complaint was filed in the court of the
Special Judge, NDPS, New Delhi. The CRCL report indicated that the
test was conducted on 18.05.2005. The qualitative tests employed were
macroscopic, microscopic, chemical and chromatographic examinations.
The results of the quantitative test revealed:
“'THC' content = 3.3% (three decimal three)”
The general observation of the chemist was:“The sample is in the form of dark brown coloured mass: it
answers positive test for 'Charas'.
CRLREVP 844/05 & CRLA 671/06

Page No.5 of 11

The report of the CRCL, therefore, was as under:“The sample is in the form of dark brown coloured mass.
On the basis of macroscopic, microscopic, chemical and
chromatographic examinations, it is concluded that the
sample u/r answers positive test for 'Charas'.
“Tetrahydro cannabinol (THC) content in the sample u/r is
3.3% (three decimal three).”

5.

On the basis of the CRCL report, the learned Special Judge,

NDPS, New Delhi, by the said order dated 19.09.2005, held that the
charas recovered in this case was a small quantity. This conclusion was
arrived at on the basis of the quantitative test which indicated 3.3% THC
content which came to 16.5 grams. According to the learned Special
Judge, this actual content of charas in the substance was a small quantity
as per the notification issued under clauses (viia) and (xxiiia) of Section
2 of the NDPS Act which specified small quantities and commercial
quantities. In the table mentioned in the notification, charas / hashish
appears in Entry 23. The small quantity specified is 100 grams and the
commercial quantity specified is 1 kilogram. The learned Special Judge
concluded on the basis of two decisions of this court that since the actual
content of charas in the substance was found to be 3.3%, which

CRLREVP 844/05 & CRLA 671/06

Page No.6 of 11

translated to 16.5 grams by weight, the same was a small quantity and,
therefore, the case was triable by a Magistrate.

Under these

circumstances, he sent the file to the learned ACMM for trial and
disposal of the case as per law. Thereafter, the trial was proceeded with.
The accused / respondent pleaded guilty and was convicted, as indicated
above, under Section 20 (b) (ii) (A) and Section 23 (a) read with Section
28 of the NDPS Act. He was sentenced accordingly, as already indicated
above, which has been served out and the fine amount has also been paid.

6.

It was contended on behalf of the Union of India, which is

both the petitioner in the revision petition and the appellant in the appeal,
that the test report indicated 3.3% content of Tetrahydro Cannabinol
(THC).

Entry No.150 in the said notification is specific to

tetrahydrocannabinol and the small quantity thereof is only two grams,
whereas, if 3.3% of 500 grams were to be taken into consideration, the
quantity by weight would be 16.5 grams which is more than two grams
and, therefore, it was not a small quantity and the learned Special Judge
erred in sending the matter for trial before the Magistrate. Since the case
could not be tried by the Magistrate, therefore, the order dated
22.11.2005 was without jurisdiction and was liable to be set aside. He

CRLREVP 844/05 & CRLA 671/06

Page No.7 of 11

placed reliance on the provisions of Section 36 of the NDPS Act as well
as the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of A.R. Antulay v. R.S.
Nayak & Another: 1988 (2) SCC 602. He also placed reliance on the
provisions of Section 461, CrPC to indicate that this was an irregularity
of such a nature which would vitiate the trial and the entire proceedings
would be void.

7.

The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the

complaint was filed under Sections 20, 23 and 28. The complaint was
not under Section 22 which relates to psychotropic substances. The
Schedule to the NDPS Act indicates 'THC' as a psychotropic substance
under Item No.13, whereas Section 20 of the NDPS Act is specific to
contraventions in relation to cannabis plant and cannabis.

Cannabis

(hemp) has been defined in Section 2 (iii) of the NDPS Act. Under
Section 2 (iii) (a), cannabis has been defined to mean 'charas', that is,
separated resin, in whatever form, whether crude or purified, obtained
from the cannabis plant and also included concentrated preparation and
resin known as hashish. In this context, he submitted that from the very
beginning, the case of the prosecution was with respect to charas /
hashish.

The case was not in respect of THC which is a separate

CRLREVP 844/05 & CRLA 671/06

Page No.8 of 11

psychotropic substance. The substance that was recovered was shown to
be charas and not THC. THC is comprised in charas and the sample
indicated a 3.3% content thereof. But this does not mean that the content
of THC would translate to 16.5 grams. The 3.3% was relatable to the
actual content of charas in the recovered substance of 500 grams.
Therefore, the small quantity / commercial quantity has to be ascertained
with reference to the notified weights in respect of charas and not in
respect of THC. It was, therefore, contended that the order on charge
passed by the learned Special Judge (NDPS), New Delhi on 19.09.2005
was the correct order. That being the case, no interference was called for
either in the revision petition or in the appeal.

8.

I agree with the submissions made by the learned counsel for

the respondent. There are also further difficulties with both the revision
petition as well as the appeal. First of all, the revision petition was filed
after the trial had already concluded and a finding of guilt had been
returned and a sentence thereon had already been passed. It is not as if
the revision petition was filed before the trial concluded. Secondly, the
appeal that was filed was filed beyond the period prescribed. There was
a delay of 84 days. The only reason for seeking condonation of delay

CRLREVP 844/05 & CRLA 671/06

Page No.9 of 11

given by the appellant was that it was under the impression that on the
acceptance of the revision petition, the case would be restored to its
original position as on 19.09.2005. Therefore, the appeal was not filed.
It is further stated that during the course of the arguments in the revision
petition on 21.03.2006, the appellant came to realise that the judgment
and order dated 22.11.2005 passed by the learned ACMM needed to be
challenged by way of an appeal under Section 377, CrPC. It is thereafter
that the appeal was filed. I am of the view that, firstly, the revision
petition ought not to have been filed challenging the order dated
19.09.2005 when it had already merged in the judgment and / or order of
conviction dated 22.11.2005. This is apart from the question that, on
merits also, I do not find any serious infirmity with the order dated
19.09.2005 for the reasons already indicated above. I am also of the
view that the mere filing of the revision petition was not ground enough
for the appellant to have not filed the appeal in time. It could not assume
that the revision petition was bound to be allowed and such an
assumption would not amount to an explanation of the delay in filing the
appeal.

9.

Consequently, the revision petition as well as the appeal are

CRLREVP 844/05 & CRLA 671/06

Page No.10 of 11

liable to be dismissed. They are dismissed.
