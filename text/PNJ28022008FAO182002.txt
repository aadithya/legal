1.

Question which arises for consideration in the

appeal stands concluded by the decisions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court reported as JT 1999 (7) SC 292 Kerala State
Electricity Board & Anr. vs. Valsala K.and Anr.

followed in the

decision reported as 2002 (10) SCC 567 Oriental Insurance Co.
FAO No.18/02

Vs. Khajuni Devi.
2.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that under the

Workmen Compensation Act, compensation payable has to be
with reference to the statutory provisions in force as on date of
the accident.
3.

Learned counsel for the respondents relies upon a

decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported as 2001 (II) ACJ
721 Rathi Menon Vs. UOI.
4.

In said decision the Hon'ble Supreme Court has dealt

with the issue whether decisions under

the

Workmen's

Compensation Act would be applicable to decisions under the
Railway Act. In view of the difference in the scheme pertaining to
compensation under the Railway Rules 1990 and Section 4 of the
Workmen Compensation Act, it has been held that decisions
under

the

Workmen's

Compensation

Act

pertaining

to

compensation are not applicable to decisions under the Railways
Act, 1989.
5.

In the instant case I note that the date of accident is

11.6.1995.

The compensation has been assessed by the

Commissioner Workmen's Compensation with reference to the
amendments incorporated in Section 4 after the accident took
place.
6.

The impugned order accordingly requires a correction

in that, compensation payable has to be determined with
FAO No.18/02

page 2 of 4

reference to the wages applicable under Sub Clause 'a' of Section
1 of Section 4 of the Workmen Compensation Act as in force on
11.6.1995.
7.

The impugned order is accordingly set aside in so far

the quantification of the compensation has been determined.
8.

I also note that the learned Commissioner has

awarded Rs.30,000/- to the claimants. But under what head has
not been

brought

out.

Thus said part of the order is also set

aside.
9.

Parties

are

directed

to

appear

before

the

Commissioner Workmen's Compensation on 30.4.2008 who shall
recompute the compensation payable and while so doing would
consider Section 4(1)(a) of the Workmen Compensation Act as in
force on date of accident. Interest would be at the rate and from
the date as per the award.
10.

I am informed by learned counsel for the appellant

that entire amount as per award has been deposited by the
appellant with the Commissioner Workmen Compensation. Part
amount has

been

released

to

the claimants.

Thus

the

Commissioner Workmen's Compensation would recompute the
amount payable and would make further disbursements as per
said computation.

Needless to state excess amount lying in

deposit with the Commissioner Workmen's Compensation after
disbursement would be returned to the appellant.
FAO No.18/02

Similarly, if
page 3 of 4

excess amounts have been disbursed to the claimants recovery
would be made and amount returned to the appellant.
11.

No costs.
