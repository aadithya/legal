1.

This application has been filed by the decree holder under

Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 praying for
issuance of warrants of attachment in terms of column 10 of the
execution petition.

The decree holder has filed the execution

petition pleading that it was entitled to recovery of Rs.
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 1 of 26

2,10,26,153/- as on 9th December, 2003 plus interest @ 30% with
monthly rests.
2.

In this application, it is averred that warrants of attachment

were not pressed by the decree holder inasmuch as the judgment
debtor put in an appearance through its counsel and wanted to
make payments in installments. According to the decree holder,
the judgment debtor has made certain payments. However, after
30th April, 2004, no payments had been made and still a sum of
Rs. 57,81,009/- was due and payable on 22nd August, 2005. The
applicant submits that the reason that this application has been
necessitated was that the judgment debtor had given a cheque
dated 28th February, 2005 for Rs. 50 lakhs.

However, after

issuance of the cheque, the judgment debtor had been orally
requesting the decree holder not the present the said cheque and
ultimately when this cheque was presented on 16th August, 2005,
the said cheque was returned dishonoured with the remarks
'insufficient funds'.
3.

According to the decree holder, its request to the judgment

debtor to make the payment has been avoided showing that they
were not interested in making the payment in the near future. In
these circumstances, it has been submitted that the decree holder
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 2 of 26

is left with no option but to seek warrants of attachment in respect
of bank accounts of the judgment debtor nos. 1 and 4 which have
been detailed in para 7 of this application. The decree holder has
also prayed that in addition to the amount of Rs. 57,81,009/-,
interest @ 30% with quarterly rests is also payable with effect
from 22nd August, 2005 till the date the payment is actually made
to the decree holder.
4.

This application has been vehemently opposed on behalf of

the judgment debtor. Appearing for the judgment debtor, Mr.
Valmiki Mehta, learned senior counsel has contended that the
judgment debtor has effected payment of the entire decretal
amount and had served a letter dated 29th April, 2004 on the
decree holder in this behalf. According to the judgment debtor,
the payment which was made on this date was in terms of the
advice given by the decree holder itself. The judgment debtor has
made a statement to this effect before this court on the 5th of
March, 2004 and 6th July, 2004 when the statement of payments
made was also furnished to the decree holder through its counsel
who had sought time to verify the position.

Inasmuch as the

submission on behalf of the judgment debtor was not disputed by
any point of time, according to the judgment debtor, the payment
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 3 of 26

tendered by it was in full satisfaction of the decree. It has been
submitted that for this reason, this execution was thereafter not
pressed by the decree holder.
5.

The judgment debtor has also vehemently disputed that the

cheque of Rs. 50,00,000/- which was deposited for payment by
the decree holder in August, 2005 had not been tendered in terms
of any dues under the decree in the present execution petition and
that the decree holder had banked the same dishonestly.
6.

According to the judgment debtor, it had adequately

informed the decree holder and apprised this court of the fact that
it had made full payment; that the decree stood satisfied and that
adequate opportunity had been given to the decree holder to show
cause against the same in the light of the requirement in law. For
this reason, it is submitted, that this application is mala fide and
misconceived and deserves to be rejected.
The application is also vehemently opposed on the ground of
concealment of material facts by the judgment debtor.

It is

contended that the application has failed to disclose not only the
payments made by the judgment debtor but also the fact that the
cheque had not been issued in discharge of any liability in the
present execution petition.
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

7.

I have heard learned counsels at great length and given my

considered thought to the submissions which have been made in
support of their respective contentions. It has been pointed out
that this execution petition was filed by the decree holder on or
around the 12th of January, 2004 claiming entitlement to a sum of
Rs. 2,10,26,153/- from the judgment debtor as being due and
payable on 9th December, 2003. This matter was adjourned on the
first date of hearing on 4th February, 2004 to enable the counsel
for the judgment debtor to make submissions. Thereafter, on 6th
February, 2004, an adjournment was prayed on behalf of the
decree holder on the ground that some talks of settlement were
going on. Again on 19th February, 2004, adjournment was sought
at the instance of the decree holder. On 5th of March, 2004, the
counsel for the judgment debtor has pointed out on record that
some payments have already been made by the judgment debtor.
Finally, on the 6th July, 2004, the following order was recorded at
the instance of the parties:“06-07-2004
Present: Mr. Harish Malhotra for the decree
holder
Mr. Tarun Johri and Ms. Neha Jain
for the
judgment debtor
Ex. P. No. 18/2004
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 5 of 26

Learned counsel for the judgment debtor
states that the entire decretal amount stands paid
to the decree holder, a statement of which has
also been furnished to the counsel for the decree
holder. Mr. Malhotra seeks short adjournment to
have instructions in the matter.”

It

becomes

necessary

at

this

stage

to

notice

the

contemporaneous facts which have occurred during this period.
On the 29th April, 2004, the judgment debtor had addressed a
letter to the decree holder enclosing a statement of what were the
payment dues as per the statement dated 27th May, 2003 and also
the dates of the payments made by the judgment debtor.

An

amount was also mentioned in this communication purporting to
be towards the interest on the delayed payment of the installments
purportedly

'as

advised'

by

the

decree

holder.

This

communication deserves to be considered in extenso and reads
thus:“M/s Morgan Securities & Credit Pvt. Ltd.

The interest on delayed payment of installments
worked out to Rs. 610350/- (for calculation see
Annexure) but we are making payment of
interest of Rs. 644687/- as advised by you for
which also we enclose a Pay Order No. 212598
dated 29.04.2004 for Rs. 5,40,707/- drawn in
your favour on ICICI Bank, New Delhi after
deducting TDS of Rs. 103980/-.
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 7 of 26

With this we request you to withdraw the
execution petition filed in the Delhi High Court
and also the cases filed under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act.”
There is no dispute that the payorder mentioned in the letter
was actually received by the decree holder. On this letter, at the
time of receipt thereof, the following endorsement was made by
the decree holder:-

9.

“Received without prejudice, subject to
reconciliation and realisation of cheque pay
orders.”
It appears that the statement made in this court on 6th July,

2004, adverted to this communication.

It cannot possibly be

disputed on behalf of the decree holder that it had been adequately
put to notice with regard to the contention of the judgment debtor
in respect of the amount which was due and payable by it as also
the amount which had been tendered by it. It is not the decree
holder's case that the cheques/pay orders mentioned in the letter
dated 29th April, 2004 were not received by it and banked for
encashment.
10.

It is noteworthy that apart from the statement made by the

judgment debtor in court that on the 10th of September, 2005, the
judgment debtor had filed EA No. 347/2005 under Section 47 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 raising objections on behalf of
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 8 of 26

the judgment debtor. Apart from other objections relating to the
merits of the amount awarded to the decree holder, in paras 11 and
12 of the application, the judgment debtor had stated thus:“11. That the decree holder further coerced the
judgment debtor in paying a further sum of Rs.
6,44,687/- towards interest payable on the
delayed payment of installments vie pay order
drawn on ICICI Bank, New Delhi bearing no.
212598 dated 29th April, 2004 for Rs. 5,04,707/after deducting a sum of Rs. 1,03,980/- as tax at
source.
12. That on 29th April, 2004 the judgment
debtor made a request to the decree holder to
withdraw the Execution Petition No. 18/2004 as
all the money due to them were paid and also to
withdraw the cases filed under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act, though the case
under Section 138 N.I. Act was withdrawn but
the decree holder continued to proceed with the
present execution proceedings.
13. On 6th July, 2004 the counsel of judgment
debtor submitted to this Hon'ble Court that the
entire decretal amount stands paid to the decree
holder and the statement of payment was also
handed over to the counsel for the decree holder
who in turn sought for short adjournment to
have instruction in the matter from the decree
holder and the matter remains pending since
then. The fact that the decree holder has
received all the money due under the said
award/decree has not been disputed since then.”
No reply was ever filed even to this application by the
judgment debtor.

Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 9 of 26

11.

However, it appears that the objections filed by the judgment

debtor in this case were similar to the objections which had been
raised by it by way of EA Nos. 296/2005 and 324/2005 in
Execution Petition no. 13/2004, another Execution Petition filed
by the present decree holder against the same judgment debtor.
Four questions were framed by the court on the objections raised.
These were heard and decided against the judgment debtor by the
judgment dated 17th July, 2006 passed in E.A. Nos. 296/2005 and
324/2005 in Execution Petition No. 13/2004.

In view of the

findings given by the court in those objections, E.A. No. 347/2005
in the present proceedings was also dismissed on 17th July, 2006.
12.

It is noteworthy that the judgment debtor had filed

objections based on the payment made by it and the four questions
noticed in the judgment which were decided. However, there was
no adjudication of the statement made by the judgment debtor in
the present execution petition to the effect that it had satisfied the
decree.
13.

It appears that there was an error in noticing the number of

the application which was heard and reserved for passing orders
on the 15th of December, 2005. The same becomes apparent on a
reading of the order recorded on 17th July, 2006 in the present
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 10 of 26

matter wherein the court has held that the issues arisen in E.A. No.
347/2005 were identical to the issues which arose in the
applications being E.A. Nos. 296/2005 and 324/2005 in
Execution Petition No. 13/2004. Since those objections had been
rejected by a detailed separate judgment, for the same reason, E.A.
No. 347/2005 was also dismissed.
It is therefore apparent that it was not E.A. No. 326/2005
which was heard and order reserved there on 15th December, 2005.
14.

Not a single communication has been placed by the decree

holder before this court repudiating any of the assertions made by
the judgment debtor in his letter dated 29th April, 2004.
According to the judgment debtor, it had not only paid the entire
decretal amount when it paid a sum of Rs. 25 lakhs but had also
paid the amount of interest which was due and payable on the
delayed payment, when on the advise of the decree holder seeking
the amount of Rs. 6,44,687/-, it had paid the amount of Rs.
5,40,707/- after reduction of the TDS of Rs. 1,03,980/-.
15.

No dispute was ever raised with regard to the statement of

accounts tendered by the judgment debtor in this communication.
On the contrary, despite the endorsement by the judgment debtor
on this communication on 29th April, 2004 and time having been
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 11 of 26

taken by the counsel for the decree holder before this court on 6th
July, 2004, the statement made by the judgment debtor was not
repudiated nor anything to the contrary was placed before this
court.
16.

The record shows that the matter was adjourned on 10th

August, 2004; 10th September, 2004; 15th February, 2005; and 19th
May, 2005. The judgment debtor had also filed a reply to E.A. No.
326/2005 as back as on 12th December, 2005 urging the afore
noticed facts after due service of the advance copy. In para 2 (v)
and (vi), the judgment debtor had again stated thus:“2(v).
with a view to amicably settle its
outstanding dues, the judgment debtors, prior to
and during the pendency of the present
execution proceedings, paid to the decree holder
the decretal amount of Rs. 2,16,09,454/adjudged under the award by 29.4.2004
alongwith a sum of Rs. 6,44,687/- (including
TDS) towards interest for delayed payment of
installments as advised by the decree holder as
per the agreed interest rate. The details of such
payments along with the last installment were
sent to the decree holder vide letter dated
29.4.2004, a copy whereof (duly acknowledged
by the decree holder) is annexed hereto and
marked as Annexure 'R-1'. Thus, the decretal
amount under the consent award having been
fully satisfied, nothing survived in the present
execution proceedings which now became liable
to be dismissed;
(vi).
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

the above satisfaction of the decree was
page 12 of 26

duly informed to this Hon'ble Court during the
course of hearing dated 6.7.2004. A statement
of such satisfaction was also furnished to the
counsel for the decree holder who sought a short
adjournment to have instructions in the matter.
More than one and a half years have elapsed
since then and the counsel for the decree holder
is yet to respond to the same and instead they
have now filed the instant application for issue of
fresh attachment warrant.”
17.

The facts stated by the judgment debtor were not repudiated

either by any communication to the judgment debtor or by way of
even a rejoinder to the reply filed by the judgment debtor. The
same was filed only after the hearing in the present application
was commenced on the 3rd of February, 2007.
In this rejoinder for the first time, the decree holder has
stated that the judgment debtors were informed at the relevant
time that the said satisfaction as was being contended by the
judgment debtor was not acceptable as the interest rate, as is
apparent from the calculation enclosed, was not in consonance
with the arbitral award dated 21st July, 2003. It is unequivocally
stated that there has never been a settlement between the decree
holder and the judgment debtor after the passing of the arbitration
award and any contention to the contrary raised by the judgment
debtor is incorrect and is liable to be rejected.

Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 13 of 26

18.

Before this court, the decree holder has placed reliance on

the provisions of Rule 1 and Rule 2(A) of Order 21 of the Code of
Civil Procedure to urge that satisfaction of a decree has to follow
strict procedural requirements and that the same having not been
done in the instant case, the pleas of the judgment debtor are
wholly misconceived.
Learned counsel for the judgment debtor has contended that
as per Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, all disputes
relating to payment under the decree are decided by this court.
19.

It would be appropriate to consider the applicable statutory

provisions in this behalf relied upon by the decree holder before
this court. As per Rule 1 of Order 21, money payable under the
decree is required to be paid to the decree holder either by deposit
into the court whose duty it is to execute the decree or it can be
paid out of court to the decree holder by postal money order or
through a bank or by any other mode wherein payment is
evidenced in writing or otherwise, in such manner as the court
which makes the decree directs.
The provisions of Rule 2 Order 21 which would have bearing
in the instant case deserves to be noticed in extenso and read
thus:Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 14 of 26

“2. Payment out of court to decree holder – (1)
Where any money payable under a decree of any
kind is paid out of court, [or a decree of any kind
is otherwise adjusted] in whole or in part to the
satisfaction of the decree holder, the decree
holder shall certify such payment or adjustment
to the court whose duty is to execute the decree,
and the court shall record the same accordingly.
(2) The judgment debtor [or any person who has
become surety for the judgment debtor] also may
inform the court of such payment or adjustment,
and apply to the court to issue a notice to the
decree holder to show cause, on a day to be fixed
by the court, why such payment or adjustment
should not be recorded as certified; and if, after
service of such notice, the decree holder fails to
show cause why the payment or adjustment
should not be recorded as certified, the court
shall record the same accordingly.
[(2-A) No payment or adjustment shall be
recorded at the instance of the judgment debtor
unless:(a) the payment is made in the manner, provided
in rule 1; or
(b) the payment or adjustment is proved by
documentary evidence; or
(c) the payment or adjustment is admitted by, or
on behalf of, the decree holder in his reply to the
notice given under sub-rule (2) of rule 1, or
before the court.]
(3) A payment or adjustment, which has not
been certified or recorded as aforesaid, shall not
be recognised by any court executing the decree.”
20.

Where money payable under the decree is paid out of court,

the decree holder is required to certify such payment or
adjustment to the court whose duty it is to execute the decree and

Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 15 of 26

the court shall

thereupon record the payment of the decretal

amount. However, if information with regard to the payment is
given by the judgment debtor, he is required to apply to the court
to issue notice to the decree holder to show cause on a date to be
fixed by the court. Where such payment or adjustment could not
be recorded as certified and if after service of such notice, the
decree holder fails to show cause why the payment or adjustment
could not be recorded as certified, the court shall record the same
accordingly.
21.

Morgan Securities Credit Pvt. Ltd., the decree holder has

challenged the action of the judgment debtor in not having filed an
appropriate application, pleading payment and satisfaction of the
decree on which the court was required to issue a notice to show
cause to the decree holder. It is stated that the oral statement
made on behalf of the judgment debtor in court is insufficient and
does not meet the mandatory requirements of the statute and
consequently, it cannot be contended that the judgment debtor
had placed the facts relating to payment in satisfaction of it.
22.

I find that apart from the oral statement made on 6th July,

2004, the judgment debtor had also mentioned these facts in the
reply which was filed by it on 12th December, 2005 and in E.A. No.
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 16 of 26

347/2005 filed on 10th September, 2005. The judgment debtor
had sought dismissal of the execution petition in E.A. No.
347/2005 on these facts. Certainly, the facts being pleaded by the
judgment debtor of having paid the decretal amount and having
satisfied the decree were placed before this court in writing and
the decree holder had been given opportunity to meet the same.
23.

In E.A. No. 347/2005, the judgment debtor had made a

prayer for dismissal of the execution petition.

The question

therefore arises as to whether in these facts it can be contended
that the judgment debtor had made substantial compliance with
the requirement of Rule 2 (2) of Order 21 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 or not.
24.

It is well settled that rules of procedure are hand maiden to

the ends of justice. Processual jurisprudence shall not override the
substantial requirements of law.

The principal purpose and

intention of sub-rule 2 of Rule 2 of Order 21 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 is to put the decree holder to notice of the claim
by the judgment debtor of having satisfied the decree.
25.

Law mandates that the decree holder has to be given an

opportunity to show cause or meet the claim of the judgment
debtor. In the facts which have been noticed in the instant case, it
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 17 of 26

cannot possibly be urged that the decree holder had not been put
to notice or was not aware of the judgment debtor's plea to the
effect that it had satisfied the decree. It had ample opportunity to
contest the claim of the judgment debtor that the decree stood
satisfied. The matter has remained pending.
26.

The manner in which the court would record satisfaction or

adjustment within the meaning of Order 21 Rule 2(2) of the Code
of Civil Procedure, has been the subject matter of judicial scrutiny
in several judicial pronouncements. The courts have held that
objections embodying the plea of satisfaction, would serve the
purpose of Order 21 Rule 2.

The statute only requires the

judgment debtor to inform the court of payment or adjustments
and apply to the court to issue a notice to the decree holder to
show cause.

No particular mode of giving the information is

prescribed in the Rule. Article 125 of the Limitation Act prescribes
the limitation of 30 days as a period within which the judgment
debtor should bring the payment or the adjustment to the notice of
the executing court.

The aim of the statute is to ensure that the

executing court is not troubled with the controversy relating to
payment or adjustment which are not certified or recorded. The
essential conditions of this order are that intimation should be
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 18 of 26

given to the court within the specified time and that the decree
holder is given an opportunity to place his case before the court.
There is nothing in the language of the rule which prevents the
information envisaged being presented by any means of an
objection petition. The Code does not prescribe any particular
format in which the court is required to issue notice to the decree
holder. For the purposes of this rule, in my view, the requirement
of rule would be satisfied if the decree holder has notice of the
request of the judgment debtor to have the payment or adjustment
recorded by the court. There would be substantial compliance
with the term of Order 22 Rule 2 even if the counter or objections
filed by the judgment debtor contained a plea of satisfaction or the
adjustment of the decree and that is served on the decree holder,
who is thus afforded an opportunity to show cause against such
certification. (Ref: AIR 1930 Patna 526 Chandi Charan Vs.
Panchhe Pandi; 24 Mad.L.J. 541 Alathoor Badruddin Vs.
Gulam Moiden; AIR 1935 Bombay 304 Kalyanji Dhana
Vs. Dharamji & Co.; AIR 1929 Allahabad 79 Ganga
Dianel Rai Vs. Ram Oudi & AIR 1939 All. 581 Abid
Hussain Vs. Kunj Bihari Lal.
27.

It is noteworthy that the decree holder is already before the

Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 19 of 26

court.

When a copy of the objection and reply of the judgment

debtor is served on the decree holder, in my view, there would be
no longer any need to specifically or separately apply to the court
for issuance of notice to the decree holder. The spirit, intendment
and object of the legislation is required to be taken into account.
Insistence upon an application by the judgment debtor and
issuance of notice would certainly amount to paying undue regard
to the form rather than to the substance and would deprive the
judgment debtor of the right given by Order 21 Rule 2.
The view I have taken

is also supported

by the

pronouncement of the Full Bench of the High Court of Andhara
Pradesh Reported at AIR 1959 AP 632 entitled Pagadala
Changayya & Anr. Vs. Noothenakalva Chenga Reddy.
28.

In the instant case, the judgment debtor had orally made a

statement before this court on the 6th July, 2004 that the entire
decretal amount stands paid to the decree holder and the
statement thereof had been furnished to the decree holder through
counsel. This oral statement was made beyond 30 days of 29th
April, 2004 when the payment was allegedly made by the
judgment debtor. This was followed up by the objections taken on
10th September, 2005 in EA No.347/2005. For the reason that the
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 20 of 26

same is beyond the statutorily prescribed period of limitation and
for the view which is taken herein on the facts of the case, it is not
necessary to examine as to whether the payment in the instant
case would require to be certified in accordance with Order 21 Rule
2. However, the contention of the decree holder that the judgment
debtor was required to file a specific application claiming
satisfaction of the decree, cannot be accepted.
29.

The first time when the issue with regard to the payments

being in satisfaction of the decree in the letter dated 29th April,
2004 of the judgment debtor has been repudiated by the decree
holder is not by way of a communication in reply to it but is
contained in the rejoinder which has been filed only on 3 rd
February, 2007.
The decree holder has for the first time also disputed having
given any advise as has been claimed by the judgment debtor in
the letter dated 29th April, 2004.
30.

I find that apart from a bald assertion to this effect, there

are no averments with regard to the date, time or manner of the
advise or the occasion. I see no occasion for the decree holder to
advise payment of interest at a rate lower than the rate awarded in
the decree.

From the several pleadings filed by the judgment

Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 21 of 26

debtor before this court as well as a close reading of the letter
dated 29th April, 2004 also, it is not possible to hold that the
payment of Rs. 6,44,687/- had been advised by the decree holder.
This application has also been filed before the contention of
the judgment debtor was accepted or payment by it certified as
satisfaction of the decree. Therefore, it is not possible to hold that
the payment made by the judgment debtor with the letter dated
29th April, 2004 was in full and final settlement of the decree.
31.

The further question which has been raised is as to the

impact of delay on the part of the decree holder to repudiate the
claim of the judgment debtor in the letter dated 29th April, 2004 or
the delay which has occurred even after such a statement was
made on court record on 6th July, 2004.
Having regard to the liability under the decree, the decree
holder would be expected to react immediately on receipt of such a
communication, if any amount was due and payable to it.
Certainly, no fault can be attributed to the judgment debtor for not
having effected the payment after it had served the letter on the
decree holder on 29th April, 2004 and thereafter. For this reason
the judgment debtor cannot be compelled to make payment of
interest for the period between 29th April, 2004 and 3rd February,
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 22 of 26

2007 and thereafter till adjudication on the present application by
this court.
32.

Detailed submissions have been made by the judgment

debtor before this court with regard to the cheques which have
been relied upon by the decree holder. It has been pointed out
that besides the present execution petition, the decree holder has
filed Execution Petition No. 13/2004 against M/s Morepen
Laboratories in respect of a decree against it.

M/s Morepen

Laboratories had agreed to pay certain amounts to the decree
holder.
33.

With regard to the liability of M/s Morepen Laboratories, by

a letter dated 5th April, 2004, the present judgment debtor had
tendered 12 post dated cheques to the decree holder on the
stipulation that “we hereby give you the following post-dated
cheques from ICICI Bank Ltd.with an understanding that the same
will be banked only if the respective cheques issued by M/s
Morepen Laboratories is/are not honoured by the HDFC Bank
Ltd. It is to be understood clearly that the cheques issued by the
judgment debtor from ICICI Bank Ltd. will be returned to the
company as and when the corresponding cheques of M/s Morepen
Laboratories is/are cleared or honoured by HDFC Bank Ltd. or as
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 23 of 26

and when the pay order of the same is handed over to you”.
34.

The judgment debtor has placed before this court also a

letter dated 24th December, 2004 from the Morepen Laboratories
wherein it is stated thus:“.....We have paid you a sum of Rs. 35 lakhs
(Rupees Thirty Five Lakhs only) vide our letter
dated 23rd December, 2004 and please find
enclosed herewith a pay order no. 266245 dated
24.12.2004 for Rs. 15,00,000/- (Rupees fifteen
lakhs only) drawn on ICICI Bank Ltd. in favour of
M/s Morgan Securities & Credits Pvt. Ltd. towards
balance amount of installment due in November
2004 and with this the installment fully paid.
Kindly acknowledge the receipt of the above pay
order and return the following post dated cheques
which we had issued to you earlier.

35.

There is no dispute that the decree holder received an

amount towards the dues of Morepen Laboratories. However, it
had returned only 10 such post-dated cheques and failed to return

Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 24 of 26

the remaining two cheques to the present judgment debtor.
According to the judgment debtor, one of such cheques was
fraudulently attempted to be encashed by the decree holder which
was dishonoured on 16th August, 2005.
36.

The judgment debtor has contended that the decree holder

had no right to bank this cheque and the dishonouring thereof
does not create any right in favour of the decree holder or any
liability against the judgment debtor so far as the present
execution petition is concerned.
37.

The stand taken by the decree holder in its rejoinder in

answer to these contentions is not supported by any document. It
has been submitted that the cheques were banked on the requests
and representations of the judgment debtor which submissions are
not supported by any document and in fact, are contrary to the
communications which have been noticed hereinabove.
I therefore, find force in the submission of the judgment
debtor so far as the encashment of the cheques and its
dishonouring of 12th August, 2005 is concerned.
38.

In view of the above, it has to be held that the payment made

on 29th April, 2004 is not based on any advise of the decree holder
and that the decree dated 21st July, 2003 is required to be
Ex. P. No. 18/2004

page 25 of 26

complied with.
39.

In view of the afore-noticed discussion, the judgment debtor

will be liable for interest upto 29th April, 2004. However, for the
period after 29th April, 2004, the same shall not be construed as a
period of delay by the judgment debtor and it shall not be liable for
any interest or any amount which is found due or payable.
40.

It is noteworthy that the judgment debtor has contended

payment and satisfaction of the decree. The same has been
disputed by the decree holder. Certainly, there are disputes with
regard to the payment made and the amounts due.
41.

The decree holder has placed its calculation along with the

present application as Annexure 'A'. I therefore give time of four
weeks' to the judgment debtor to place its calculations of what
would be due and payable in terms of the decree dated 21st July,
2003 to the decree holder upto 29th April, 2004 and make
payment thereof within a further period of four weeks.
This application is allowed to this extent and in the above
terms.
