1.

This is an application filed by the respondent/workman under

Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking direction to
the petitioner to pay to the respondent the last drawn salary from the
date of termination of his service.

2.

The

respondent

no.1/applicant

CM No.1405/2006 in W.P(C) No.9490/2004

contended

that

he

was

appointed as a conductor with the petitioner corporation and an
enquiry was conducting against him. Pursuant to the enquiry, the
charges made against him were proved and the disciplinary authority
removed the respondent from the service by order dated 5th August,
1994. The petitioner therefore, filed an application under section 33
(2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes, Act, 1947 in which it was held that
the enquiry held was not legal and valid by order dated 19th
December, 2002 and thereafter the application of the petitioner under
section 33(2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 was dismissed
by order dated 1st September, 2003. The petitioner, therefore, could
not have dismissed the respondent.

3.

The petitioner, however, filed the present petition under Article

226 of the Constitution of India. The order dated 1st September, 2003
dismissing the application of the petitioner under section 33 (2) (b) of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 was stayed by this Court by order
dated 17th September, 2004.The respondent has contended that he is
unemployed since the date of illegal termination of his services by the
petitioner corporation, which was his only source of income. It is
asserted by the respondent that because of termination of his services
he and his family members are suffering irreparably. In these
circumstances the respondent has claimed relief under section 17B of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

A reply has been filed by the petitioner/non-applicant wherein

the petitioner contended that the writ petition be decided in full and
final after hearing the same on merits instead of deciding the
application under section 17B, else the main case will remain pending
unnecessarily and there would also be multiplicity of litigation. The
petitioner further denied the factum of unemployment of the
respondent and contended that as the respondent has not disclosed
the source of his livelihood, therefore, it is to be presumed that he is
in gainful employment.

5.

Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 comes into

operation when an Award directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in further proceedings by the employer. Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act is as under:"17-B. Payment of full wages to workman pending proceedings in Higher Courts. - Where in any case a Labour
Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal by its award directs
reinstatement of any workman and the employer prefers
any proceedings against such award in a High Court or
the Supreme Court, the employer shall be liable to pay
such workman, during the period of pendency of such
proceedings in the High Court or the Supreme Court, full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance
allowance admissible to him under any rule if the workman had not been employed in any establishment during
such period and an affidavit by such workman had been
filed to that effect in such court :

CM No.1405/2006 in W.P(C) No.9490/2004

Page3 of 8

Provided that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the
High Court or the Supreme Court that such workman
had been employed and had been receiving adequate remuneration during any such period or part thereof, the
Court shall order that no wages hall be payable under
this section for such period or part, as the case may be."

6.

The statute, therefore, requires satisfaction of the following four

conditions for granting relief under section under section 17B of the
Act:
(i)

(ii)

during the pendency of such proceedings, employer
is required to pay full wages to the workman;

(iii)

the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full
wages last drawn by him, inclusive of any
maintenance allowance admissible to him under
any Rule;

(iv)

7.

an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is
assailed in proceedings in a High Court or the
Supreme Court;

such wages would be admissible only if the
workman had not been employed in any
establishment during such period and an affidavit
had been filed to such effect.

Further granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and pass-

ing orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the
rule; refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the
relief could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional error where there is no relationship of employer and employee
between the parties.

The object underlying section 17B of the Industrial Disputes

Act, 1947 is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship
which would be caused to a workman due to delay in the
implementation of an award directing reinstatement of his services on
account of the challenge made to it by the employer.

Section 17B

recognizes a workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body
and soul together when a challenge has been made to an Award
directing his reinstatement as the statutory provisions provides no
inherent right of assailing an order or an award by an industrial
adjudicator by way of an appeal.

9.

Thus on satisfaction of the requisites as laid down under

section 17B, the court is bound to grant relief to the workman in
terms of the provision as laid down under section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act and that the Court cannot go into the merits
of the case/writ petition while deciding an application under section
17B of the Act as was held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi)
413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander. Thus an application under 17B
has to be considered strictly in terms of section 17B of the Act
irrespective of the merit of the petition. In a catena of cases the Apex
Court has also held that the application under section 17B should be
disposed of expeditiously and before deciding the writ petition. In JT
CM No.1405/2006 in W.P(C) No.9490/2004

Page5 of 8

2000(8) SC 501 entitled Workman v. Hindustan Vegetable Oil
Corporation Ltd. It was held as under:“2. The order under challenge has been passed by a Division
Bench of the High Court at Calcutta. Its operative portion
states that the writ petition filed by the present appellants and
their application under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes
Act should be disposed of together, expeditiously. We are of the
view that an application under Section 17B should be disposed
of before the principal petition and it should be disposed of
most expeditiously.
3. We, therefore, set aside the order under challenge to the extent that it requires the disposal of the writ petition and the
Section 17B application together and we direct that the Section
17B application should be disposed of with great promptitude
and before disposal of the writ petition.”

Thus the plea of the petitioner that the writ petition be decided
prior to deciding the application under section 17B cannot be
accepted.

10.

The workman has categorically averred in the application that

he has not been employed since the date of termination of his services
and has also filed an affidavit deposing about it. Apart from bald
denial by the petitioner/employer, no cogent material has been placed
on

record

to

negate

the

factum

of

unemployment

of

the

respondent/workman since the date of termination of his services.
Merely on the plea of the petitioner that since the respondent has not
disclosed the source of his livelihood after the termination of his
services, it cannot be presumed or inferred that he is gainfully
CM No.1405/2006 in W.P(C) No.9490/2004

Page6 of 8

employed and the relief under section 17B of the Industrial Disputes
Act cannot be denied. Assumption of petitioner cannot be a ground for
denial of benefit under section 17B to the workman. Further even on
the ground that the petitioner has a good case on merit, the relief
under

section

17B

cannot

be

denied

to

the

workman.

The

applicant/workman, in the facts and circumstances, fulfills the
criteria for availing the benefit under section 17B of the Act. In
exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, if the
requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are
satisfied, no order can be passed, denying the workman the benefit of
statutory provision of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947.

11.

For the foregoing reasons, the application is allowed.

The

petitioner is directed to pay to the respondent/workman the arrears of
last drawn wages or the minimum wages whichever is higher from
26th May, 2004, the date on which the writ petition was filed. The
arrears of last drawn wages or minimum wages be paid within eight
weeks. The petitioner shall continue to pay the last drawn wages or
minimum wages whichever is higher by 10th day of every month in
future during the pendency of the writ petition.

The respondent is

also directed to file an undertaking that in case the writ petition is
allowed, the difference between the last drawn wages or the minimum

CM No.1405/2006 in W.P(C) No.9490/2004

wages shall be repaid/refunded to the petitioner within the time as
may be directed or permitted by this court. The undertaking to this
effect be filed within four weeks.
With these directions, the application is disposed of.
