PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Order dated 26.7.2003 impugned in the present

petition has dismissed an application filed by the petitioner
seeking review of the order dated 28.1.2003 vide which order
learned Matrimonial Judge granted a monthly maintenance of
Rs.25,000/- to the respondent (wife). Additionally, Rs.15,000/towards litigation expenses was directed to be paid by the
petitioner.
2.

Petitioner and the respondent were married as per

CM(M) 818/03

Pg.No.1 of 9

Hindu rites and custom on 31.1.1990.

The marriage soured.

The husband and wife separated. 2 children born out of the
wedlock are admittedly students of a reputed public school in
Kodaikanal.

Expenses of the 2 children are borne by the

petitioner.
3.

Seeking interim maintenance under Section 24 of

the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 respondent stated that she had no
source of income. That proprietory rights of a defunct factory
by name of M/s.Solutions in Gurgaon belonged to her.

She

stated that the factory was lying closed and was a defunct unit.
4.

Qua the petitioner, respondent stated that he had a

factory at Panipat where from he was having a monthly income
of Rs.5 lacs.

He had a residential house at Sikandrabad,

opposite to the residence of the Chief Minister.

He had a

residential flat in a group housing society at Delhi.

He had

agricultural land in district Gurgaon and district Bhiwani,
Haryana.
5.

Pertaining to the lifestyle of the husband she stated

that the husband was maintaining 3 high segment cars viz.
Tata Sierra, Honda City and Mercedes Benz.

member of 3 clubs viz. DLF Gymkhana, Gurgaon; Classic Golf

CM(M) 818/03

Pg.No.2 of 9

factory where from business under the name and style of
M/s.Solutions was being run was on a plot owned by the wife.
That

he

had

raised

a

superstructure

thereon.

That

notwithstanding the fact that the wife was a name lender she
withdrew the power of attorney authorizing him carry on the
affairs of the business of the sole proprietory firm of the wife.
She withdrew Rs.3.5 lacs from the bank. That father of the wife
was an ex-member of the Legislative Assembly in Haryana. He
ousted the petitioner from the said business and has taken over
the entire assets thereof.
7.

Qua the children, the respondent admitted that the

children were in a boarding school.

Qua the residential

properties, petitioner denied owning any house at Sikandrabad.
He admitted being a member of a cooperative society at Delhi
but stated that possession of the flat had yet to be handed over
to him by the society. He stated that he was making payments
in installments to the society as and when money was
demanded by the society. He denied owning any agricultural
land in Haryana. He accepted owning a Tata Sierra but stated
that it was under a hire-purchase agreement.

He denied

owning the Honda City car. He stated that the car Mercedes
Benz was registered in the name of M/s.Solutions and was got
financed by and under a loan obtained from Tata Finance. He
CM(M) 818/03

Pg.No.3 of 9

stated that the car was in possession of Patel Motors who were
claiming a substantial amount for repair of the car.
8.

Regarding membership of the 3 clubs, petitioner

admitted membership of Classic Golf Resort, Jaipur. He stated
that membership of DLF Gymkhana, Gurgaon had lapsed. He
denied being a member of Siri Fort Complex.
9.
noting

Vide order dated 28.1.2003 learned Judge has, after
the

rival

versions,

justified

grant

of

monthly

maintenance in sum of Rs.25,000/- to the respondent on a
single fact, being that, the husband was paying an annual fee
to Kodaikanal International School of nearly Rs.7 lacs per
annum for each child.
10.

Though not expressly stated, it is obvious that the

signature tune of the order dated 28.1.2003 is that if the
husband can spend Rs.14 lacs per annum on the tuition fee of
the 2 children it evidenced his substantial means.
11.

Seeking review it was pointed out that the annual

fee of each child is Rs.1.75 lacs. It was also pointed out that to
finance the fee of the children the husband had to take a loan
against his LIC policy. He further stated that he had obtained
various loans which had to be repaid.
12.

Vide impugned order dated 26.7.2003, learned

Judge has held that all issues raised were discussed while
CM(M) 818/03

Pg.No.4 of 9

passing the order granting monthly maintenance to the wife.
That no case was made out for review of the said order.
13.

At the outset, I may note that in the order granting

maintenance,

as

noted

by

me

herein

above,

learned

Matrimonial Judge noted the respective contentions of the
parties but founded his order primarily on the plea of the wife
that the husband was paying an annual fee of Rs.7 lacs per
child to the school where the children were admitted.
14.

Indeed, this is incorrect.

At the hearing held on

01.08.2007, learned counsel for the respondent conceded that
the annual fee payable to the school per child is Rs.1.75 lacs.
15.

Thus, it was expected from the learned Trial Judge to

have considered the matter afresh as indeed there was an error
apparent

on

the

face

of

the

order

granting

monthly

maintenance to the wife.
16.

But, I do not intend to remit the matter for fresh

adjudication, for the reason in my opinion, independent of the
issue as to what annual fee has to be paid for education of the
2 children, enough material exists on record to justify monthly
maintenance of Rs.25,000/- in favour of the wife.
17.

As opined in various judicial decisions it is a usual

tendency to not truthfully disclose ones income when a dispute
surfaces between a husband and a wife.
CM(M) 818/03

Pg.No.5 of 9

18.

As held in the decision dated 18.4.2007 in CM(M)

No.40/2005 titled as 'Bharat Hegde vs. Saroj Hegde', the
following are the guiding factors which have to be taken into
consideration while adjudicating the claims under Section 24 of
the Hindu Marriage Act:1.

Status of the parties.

2.

Reasonable wants of the claimant.

3.
The independent income and property of the
claimant.
4.
The number of persons, the non applicant has to
maintain.
5.
The amount should aid the applicant to live in a
similar life style as he/she enjoyed in the matrimonial
home.
6.

Non-applicant's liabilities, if any.

7.
Provisions for food, clothing, shelter, education,
medical attendance and treatment etc. of the applicant.
8.

Payment capacity of the non applicant.

9.
Some guess work is not ruled out while estimating
the income of the non applicant when all the sources or
correct sources are not disclosed.
10.

The non applicant to defray the cost of litigation.

11. The amount awarded u/s. 125 Cr.PC is adjustable
against the amount awarded u/s. 24 of the Act.
19.

Admitted by the husband is the fact that he is paying

an annual fee of Rs.3.5 lacs for the education of both the
children in Kodaikanal International School.
CM(M) 818/03

Admitted by the
Pg.No.6 of 9

husband is the fact of membership of a 5 star club called
Classic Golf Resort. Admitted by the husband is the fact that he
is a qualified chartered accountant and had worked with
Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, a reputed firm of chartered
accountants in England. Petitioner admits that having worked
abroad from 1984-1991 he came to India and joined M/s.Price
Water House, a leading firm of chartered accountants.
20.

In Suit No.1150/1998, pending on the Original Side

of this Court he claimed to have invested Rs.15 lacs in the
business of M/s.Solutions which he claimed was his and that his
wife was a name lender. In the said suit he admitted bringing a
Mercedes Benz car to India which was sold for Rs.22 lacs.
21.

In

the

said

suit

he

admitted

that

the

firm

M/s.Solutions made profits of Rs.11,24,436.91 during the
financial year 1993-94, profits of Rs.9,63,827.29 in the financial
year 1995-96 and profit of Rs.23,29,381.77 in the financial year
1996-97.
22.

In Suit No.1150/1998, petitioner stated that his wife

was a housewife and had no means of any income.
23.

Defending the suit, respondent states that she was

managing business and that her husband was looking after the
marketing and accounts of the factory.
24.

Much was attempted to be made out by learned

CM(M) 818/03

Pg.No.7 of 9

counsel for the petitioner with reference to the written
statement

filed

by

the

respondent

while

opposing

Suit

No.1150/1998.
25.

But, I give no credence to the said fact for the

reason it is the usual story of everybody trying to grab
whatever is available to be grabbed.
26.

What is relevant is that the respondent categorically

stated in the written statement that her husband had complete
control over the marketing and finances of the business
conducted under the name and style M/s.Solutions.
27.

Prima facie, the respondent was obviously a name

lender.
28.

The lifestyle of the family and the current lifestyle

enjoyed by the husband can be gauged from the fact that a
Tata Sierra and a Mercedes Benz is still with the husband. It is
difficult to believe that for a repair bill, the husband would not
lift the car from the garage. No doubt, Mercedes Benz and the
Tata Sierra are under a finance, but he who purchases luxury
cars under a finance evidences his lifestyle if nothing more.
29.

Petitioner is also a member of a 5 star club.

30.

The totality of the circumstances justify an inference

that the monthly income of the husband, commensurate with
his lifestyle and ability to repay monthly installments for 2
CM(M) 818/03

Pg.No.8 of 9

luxury cars and a flat cannot be less than Rs.2 lacs.
31.

Matter can be looked at from another angle.

32.

If school fee paid for the 2 children is Rs.3.5 lacs,

annual maintenance to the wife in sum of Rs.3 lacs cannot be
called excessive.
33.

As noted above, monthly maintenance awarded to

the wife is Rs.25,000/- i.e. Rs.3 lacs per annum.
34.

I thus find no merit in the petition.

35.

The petition is dismissed.

36.

No costs.
