and the proceedings arising out of the said FIR.
2.

Briefly stated, the facts are that the marriage between

petitioner no.1, Sanjeev Nagpal and respondent no.2, Sonia
Nagpal was solemnized on 19.8.96 as per Hindu rites and
ceremonies. Unfortunately, the marriage turned sour and they
started living separately since June, 2001. A boy named Shrey
was born to the parties.
3.

A complaint dated 7.1.2003 was filed by the respondent

no.2 against the petitioner no.1, his father (petitioner no.2),
mother (petitioner no.3), sister (petitioner no.5) and brother-inlaw (petitioner no.4). The complaint contained the allegations
of harassment for dowry, illegal retention of istridhan etc.
4.

On the basis of the complaint FIR No.16/03 dated

9.1.2003 was registered.
5.

Subsequently, parties entered into a written agreement

dated 20.1.03 whereby they settled the disputes between them
on the terms and conditions mentioned therein. Inter alia, it
was agreed that a sum of Rs. 8 lakhs was to be paid by the
petitioners to the respondent no.2 and that in consideration of
same petitioner No.1 and respondent no.2 would obtain a
decree of divorce by mutual consent and shall also seek
quashing of aforesaid FIR.

6.

Copy of the agreement dated 20.1.2003 is on record.

Correctness of the same is not disputed. It reads as under:“AGREEMENT/COMPROMISE
This Deed of Agreement is made on 20th day of
January 2003, between Mrs. Sonia Nagpal W/o Sh. Sanjeev
Nagpal at present residing at 7/126, Ramesh Nagar, New
Delhi on the first part.
AND
Sh. Om Prakash Nagpal S/o Late Jeevan Das R/o 17
B/D, Gandhi Nagar, Jammu, India. (The real brother of the
father-in-law of the first party) acting on behalf of Sh. Ram
Saroop Das S/o Late Jeevan Das.
That a marriage took place between the first party
and Sh. Sanjeev Nagpal S/0 Sh. Ram Saroop, on 19.8.96
and a boy named Master Shrey, was born out of the said
wedlock. But due to the differences in temperament of
both the husband and wife, the marriage could not stood
long and ultimately, a FIR No. 16/2003, P.S. Kirti Nagar,
U/s 498-A/406/34 IPC against the husband and his family.
That due to the intervention of the respectables from
both the family, the dispute has been settled, and by this
agreement the complainant (first party) has agreed to
settle the dispute by taking 8,00,000/- rupees (Rupees
Eight Lacs only) from Sh. Om Parkash on behalf of the
accused party, as a total amount in lump-sum, more
specifically, this amount consisting of the entire istridhan,
Alumony, her future maintenance etc.
That out of the above said amount rupees four lacs
(4,00,000/-) would be paid to her at the time of granting
the bail to the accused party and rest of the amount of
four lacs (4,00,000/-) would be paid to the first party at
the time of divorce by mutual consent, and quashing the
FIR No. 16/2003, P.S. Kirti Nagar, U/s 498-A/406/34 IPC by
the first party (Ms. Sonia Nagpal)
That the baby boy master Shrey would be with his
father, Sh. Sanjeev Nagpal on his sole responsibility,
however the mother Smt. Sonial Nagpal would be allowed
to meet the child as and when she desires.
Both the party have at set their hands before the
Crl.M.C.914/2003

following witnesses:WITNESSES:

FIRST PARTY

Sd/7.

SECOND PARTY”

In pursuance of afore-noted agreement, a sum of Rs.4

lakhs was paid to respondent no.2-wife at the time when the
learned Additional Sessions Judge granted the bail to the
petitioners.
8.

As evident from the agreement, balance amount of Rs.4

lakhs was to be paid in two installments of Rs.2 lakhs each.
First installment of Rs.2 lakhs was to be paid at the time when
the decree of divorce by mutual consent was obtained by the
parties. Second installment of Rs.2 lakhs was to be paid at the
time when FIR would have got quashed.
9.

However, parties could not agree about the format of joint

petition which was to be filed under Section 13(B)(1) of the
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 for a decree of divorce by mutual
consent. Petitioner no.1 alleges that he prepared draft joint
petition but that the respondent no.2 did not co-operate with
him and unilaterally filed a petition for divorce.
10.

Petitioner no.1 submitted that since he also wanted a

divorce

notwithstanding

various

allegations

against

him

contained in the divorce petition filed unilaterally by the wife

Crl.M.C.914/2003

Page 4 of 12

and since object of separation was being achieved he did not
appear in said proceedings. The court thus granted an ex-parte
decree to the respondent no.2.
11.

The grievance of the petitioners is that they are ready and

willing to perform their obligations under the afore-noted
written agreement but respondent no.2-wife is resiling from the
said agreement and is not co-operating with them.
12.

The question is whether in these circumstances, the FIR

as also the proceedings arising out of the said FIR should be
quashed or not.
13.

In the decision reported as Ruchi Agarwal v Amit Kumar

Agarwal & Ors. (2005) 3 SCC 299 a complaint was lodged by
the appellant-wife alleging offences under Sections 498-A, 323
and 506 IPC and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
Thereafter, a divorce petition was filed by her. In the said
divorce petition, a compromise was arrived between the parties
in which it was stated that the first respondent-husband was
willing for a consent divorce and that the appellant-wife had
received all her maintenance and istridhan in lump sum. It was
also stated in the said compromise deed that the parties to the
proceedings would withdraw all civil and criminal complaints
filed against each other. Notwithstanding the compromise, the

Crl.M.C.914/2003

Page 5 of 12

appellant-wife did not take any steps to withdraw the said
complaint. Noting that the appellant-wife had signed the
compromise deed and the first respondent-husband performed
his part of obligation under the compromise deed, the Supreme
Court quashed the complaint and observed as under :“Learned counsel appearing for the appellant,
however contended, that though the appellant had
signed the compromise deed with the abovementioned terms in it, the same was obtained by the
respondent-husband and his family under threat and
coercion and in fact she did not receive lump sum
maintenance and her Stridhan properties, we find it
extremely difficult to accept this argument in the
background of the fact that pursuant to the
compromise deed the respondent-husband has
given her a consent divorce which she wanted and
thus had performed his part of obligation under the
compromise deed. Even the appellant partially
performed her part of obligations by withdrawing
her criminal complaint filed under Section 125. It is
true that she made a complaint to the Family Court
where Section 125 Cr. P.C. proceedings were
pending that the compromise deed was filed under
coercion but she withdrew the same and gave a
statement before the said court affirming the terms
of the compromise which statement was recorded
by the Family Court and the proceedings were
dropped and a divorce was obtained. Therefore, we
are of the opinion that appellant having received the
relief she wanted without contest on the basis of the
terms of the compromise, we cannot now accept the
argument of the learned counsel for the appellant. In
our opinion, the conduct of the appellant indicates
that the criminal complaint from which this appeal
arises was filed by the wife only to harass the
respondents.
In view of the said subsequent events and the
conduct of the appellant, it would be an abuse of
process of the court if the criminal proceedings from
Crl.M.C.914/2003

Page 6 of 12

which this appeal arises is allowed to continue.
Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that to
do complete justice, we should while dismissing this
appeal also quash proceedings arising from the
Criminal Case No.224/2003 registered in police
station, Bilaspur, (Distt. Rampur) filed under
Sections 498-A, 323 and 506 IPC and Sections 3 and
4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act against the
respondents herein. It is ordered accordingly. Appeal
is disposed of.”
14. In the decision reported as Mohd. Shamim v Nahid
Begum 2005 (1) JCC 83, first respondent-wife filed a complaint
under Sections 498-A/406/34 IPC against the appellants. During
the pendency of the complaint, a settlement was arrived at by
the parties. An affidavit in support of the said settlement was
filed by the first respondent-wife. The said settlement was duly
recorded in a judicial order. Pursuant to the said settlement,
appellants filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr. P.C.,
1973 before the High Court for quashing the FIR. First
respondent-wife filed an objection to the said petition. In view
of stand taken by the first respondent, the High Court declined
to quash the FIR. Noting that the first respondent had entered
into a settlement and had also received money in pursuance of
said settlement, the Supreme Court in appeal reversed the
decision of the High Court and quashed the FIR. In the said
decision, the Supreme Court had observed as under:“In view of the conduct of the First Respondent in
entering into the aforementioned settlement, the
continuance of the criminal proceeding pending
Crl.M.C.914/2003

Page 7 of 12

against the Appellants, in our opinion, in this case
also, would be an abuse of process of the court. The
Respondent No.1, however, would be entitled to
withdraw the sum of Rs.50,000/- deposited in the
court. We therefore, in exercise of our jurisdiction
under Article 142 of the Constitution of India direct
that the impugned judgment be set aside. The First
Information Report lodged against the appellants is
quashed. The Appeal is allowed. However, this order
should not be treated as a precedent.”
15. In the decision reported as Kamlesh Varma & Ors v NCT of
Delhi & Ors 2002 (2) CCC (Del) 74 on the basis of the complaint
lodged by the respondent no.2-wife, a FIR under Sections 498A/406 IPC was registered against the petitioners. Husband of
the complainant also filed a petition for divorce which was
decreed in his favour. Against the said decree, Respondent
no.2-wife filed an appeal in the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
During the pendency of the said appeal, an compromise was
arrived at between the parties and in terms of compromise
husband paid a sum of Rs.2,25,000/- to the respondent no.2wife. The respondent no.2-wife categorically undertook to
withdraw the aforementioned complaint filed by her. In
pursuance of the compromise, a quashing petition was filed
before the High Court. The respondent no.2-wife however
refused to co-operate with the petitioners in the said quashing
on the ground that the sum of Rs.2,25,000/- was paid only
towards her claim for maintenance. Noting the compromise
which was arrived at before the Punjab and Haryana High
Crl.M.C.914/2003

Page 8 of 12

Court, the learned Single Judge of this court quashed the aforementioned FIR. In the said decision, it was observed as under:“4. It is not in dispute that respondent No.
2/complainant was working in the railway at the
relevant time. In view of the same, I am unable to
accept the argument that the complainant accepted
Rs. 2,25,000/- only towards her maintenance. Articles
of Istridhan were recovered by the police during
investigation on 20th January, 1993 and 13th
February, 1993. The respondent is resting her claim
for the un-recovered jewellery on the list given on
11th February, 1993 during the investigations to the
police. This claim was very much within her
knowledge on the date she accepted Rs. 2,25,000/before Division Bench in High Court on 25th March,
1996
when
she
specifically
undertook
to
withdraw/settle criminal case pending in the
Matrimonial Court, Shahdra. If that was so,
respondent No. 2 ought to have not agreed or ought
to have sought clarification from the High Court. That
having not been done, now it does not lie in her
mouth and argued that she never agreed to get the
criminal proceeding quashed. This contention is
without merit and the same is rejected.
5. In the facts and circumstances noticed above, the
continuation of the criminal proceedings would be an
abuse of the process of the court and the same are
liable to be quashed in terms of same law laid down
by the Supreme Court in State of Haryana v. Bhajan
Lal, AIR 1992 SC 604 and several subsequent
judgments.”

16.

In the decision reported as Satish Gathwal & Ors v State

& Anr 1982 (2) JCC 114 on the basis of the complaint lodged by
the respondent no.2-wife, a FIR under Sections 498-A/406 IPC

Crl.M.C.914/2003

Page 9 of 12

was registered against the petitioners. During pendency of the
criminal proceedings pertaining to the afore-mentioned FIR, a
written agreement was entered into between the parties
whereby they agreed to settle the disputes between them on
the terms and conditions mentioned therein. In pursuance of
said agreement, a sum of Rs.5 lakhs was received by the
respondent no.2-wife. A joint petition for quashing of FIR was
filed before the High Court. During the hearing of the quashing
petition, respondent no.2-wife made a statement before the
court affirming the terms of the agreement. However, later she
refused to participate in the quashing petition on the ground
that the amount mentioned in the agreement was paid towards
her claim for maintenance, stridhan and dowry articles and that
agreement had nothing to do with criminal proceedings
pending trial. Noting the written agreement entered into
between the parties and statement of respondent no.2-wife
before the Court wherein she affirmed the terms of agreement,
the learned Single Judge of this court quashed the FIR in
question. In the said decision, it was observed as under :“17. Her statement was a representation made and
undertaking given before this Court that she will not
pursue her complaint and on the basis of this, the
petitioner has given and she has accepted Rs. 6.00
lakhs in part satisfaction of the agreement. This is
very unfortunate that she is now backing out from
Crl.M.C.914/2003

Page 10 of 12

this undertaking. She is estopped in law from
withdrawing her undertaking and representation.
This would amount to committing Contempt of
Court by her. From the agreement entered into
between the parties and which is confirmed by them
in Court, no doubt is left that this was a package
deal for divorce as well as for quashing the criminal
proceedings. By denying this agreement, she is
certainly misusing the process of the Court. The
Court would not allow a party to misuse its
process.”
17.

Lastly, I note the following observations of the Supreme

Court in the decision reported as State of Karnataka v
L.Muniswamy & Ors AIR 1977 SC 1489 :“In the exercise of this wholesome power, the High
Court is entitled to quash a proceeding if it comes to
the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to
continue would be an abuse of the process of the
Court or that the ends of justice require that the
proceeding ought to be quashed. The saving of the
High Court's inherent powers, both in civil and
criminal matters is designed to achieve a salutary
public purpose which is that a court proceeding
ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a
weapon of harassment or persecution. In a criminal
case, the veiled object behind a lame prosecution,
the very nature of the material on which the
structure of the prosecution rests and the like would
justify the High Court in quashing the proceeding in
the interest of justice. The ends of justice are higher
than the ends of mere law though justice has got to
be administered according to laws made by the
legislature........”
18.

In the light of the afore-noted judicial pronouncements

and noting the fact that the respondent no.2 had entered into a
written agreement dated 20.1.2003 and that she took Rs.4

Crl.M.C.914/2003

Page 11 of 12

lakhs in pursuance of said agreement, I consider it appropriate
to quash the aforesaid FIR and proceedings arising out of the
said FIR.
19.

Petitioners are hereby directed to deposit a sum of Rs. 4

lacs in the Registry of this court within a week from today.
20. On compliance of the aforesaid direction by the petitioners,
the FIR No.16/2003 registered at P.S. Kirti Nagar under Sections
498-A/406/34 IPC would be deemed to be quashed.
21.

Liberty is granted to the respondent no.2-wife to withdraw

the said sum of Rs.4 lacs.
22.
23.

Crl.M.C. No.914/03 is accordingly allowed.
No costs.
