PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
I shall be referring to the appellant as the plaintiff. I

shall be referring to the respondent as the defendant.
2.

Plaintiff is aggrieved by an order dated 16.3.2005

dismissing his application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC
praying that pending adjudication of the suit filed by the
plaintiff seeking relief of specific performance of an agreement
to sell dated 24.7.2002, defendant

be

injuncted

from

transferring,
Page 1 of 5

alienating, parting with possession or creating third party rights
in the suit property.
3.

The suit in question was filed on 22.12.2004.

4.

The agreement to sell relied upon records that the

seller who was the owner of plot No.296-A, Majlis Park
admeasuring approximately 80 sq.yds. had agreed to sell the
same to the plaintiff for the sale consideration of Rs.16 lacs out
of which Rs.2 lacs in cash were being received at the time of
execution of the agreement to sell and that balance sum would
be paid within 30 days when purchaser would get executed the
requisite sale documents before the Sub Registrar, Delhi.
5.

The defendant opposed the suit by filing a written

statement.

Inter alia, it was highlighted in the written

statement that on 28.8.2002 plaintiff had caused to be served
upon the defendant a lawyer's notice calling upon the
defendant to comply with the agreement to sell.

The notice

was duly replied to on 21.9.2002 denying the existence of any
agreement to sell.

It was further pointed out that it was

unbelievable that the defendants would execute any such
agreement.

Reason for said plea was that the parties were

involved in a continuous litigation since 1997. That defendant
had a grievance against the plaintiff of having encroached
upon adjoining public land

Page 2 of 5
and using the same for running an eatery.

A writ petition

bearing No.2040/1997 filed in this court was referred to as
being the one evidencing past litigation. Orders passed by this
Court in the said writ petition on 16.2.2000 were relied upon
which contained a direction to the MCD to remove the
encroachments from the public land made by the plaintiff. It
was additionally pointed out that the defendant and his father
had been making complaints to the police against plaintiff on
23.1.1998, 3.5.2001, 8.5.2001, 28.5.2001 and as late as on
27.8.2002.

It was further pleaded that as recorded in the

agreement to sell the same was purportedly a result of
intervention of a property dealer M/s.Kapoor & Company who
ostensibly acted as a broker.

It was pointed out that

Mr.Kapoor, a property dealer was also carrying on business of
running a chit under the name and style M/s.Kapoor Sunny Pvt.
Ltd.

It was stated that Mr.Kapoor had connived with the

plaintiff to fabricate a false document. Lastly it was pleaded
that the total area of plot bearing No.296-A, Majlis Park is 182
sq.yds. The same was valued at more than Rs.1.8 crores. It
was unbelievable that 80 sq.yds. thereof would be sold for a
meagre sum of Rs.16 lacs.
6.

Considering the rival versions and declining interim

injunction, the learned Trial Judge has noted 4

features.

Firstly
Page 3 of 5
that the plot in question admeasures 182 sq.yds. the
agreement to sell records the same to be only 80 sq.yds.
Secondly, the past litigation between the parties and police
complaints right up to 27.8.2002 made it suspect that the
defendant would have entered into the agreement to sell.
Thirdly, the probability of Mr.Kapoor conniving in creation of
the documents was found to be a probable plea. Lastly, delay
in institution of the suit was noted.
7.

The result was that the injunction as prayed for has

been denied.
8.

From the pleadings of the parties and facts noted

herein above view taken by the learned Trial Judge cannot be
faulted with. It is settled law that if on a given material 2 views
are possible and the Trial Court adopts 1 out of the 2 views the
Appellate Court would not interdict the order merely because
another view is probable.
9.

Adding on to what has weighed with the learned

Trial Judge I may note that the plot in question admittedly
measures 182 sq.yds.

What part thereof admeasuring 80

sq.yds. was agreed to be sold is not mentioned in the

agreement to sell. I wonder, which 80 sq.yds. of land could be
put under the Court injunction from out of 182 sq.yds. of land?

10.

As noted herein above the sale deed had to be

executed as recorded in the agreement to sell within 30 days
thereof.

In this connection delay in filing the suit assumes

importance and the importance get further fortified when one
considers that on 28.8.2002 plaintiff had caused a legal notice
to be served upon the defendant calling upon the defendant to
execute the sale deed pursuant to the agreement to sell in
question.

On 21.9.2002 the defendant categorically denied

having executed any agreement to sell. In spite thereof, the
plaintiff waited till 22.12.2004 to file the suit. Certainly, delay
defeats equity.
11.

I find no merits in the appeal.

The same is

dismissed.
12.

LCR be returned.

13.

No costs.
