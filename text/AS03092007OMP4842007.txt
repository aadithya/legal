By way of this application, petitioner/objector has

sought condonation of delay in refiling the objection petition
under Section 5 of the Limitation Act read with section 151
Code of Civil Procedure.
on

26th

May,

2007

Petitioner filed Objection Petition

challenging

the

award

dated

6th

September, 2006. On 27th May, 2007 Mohd. Imran, clerk of
Ms. Rachna Gupta Advocate checked registry of the court to
find out any defects in the petition but was informed that the
matter had not been checked. Mohd. Imran checked on the
filing counter on several dates but was told that the matter
had not been checked. The matter was returned as defective
to Mohd. Imran in the last week of June 2007 and it was
found that the dealing assistant had checked and defects
were pointed out on 29th May, 2007 itself.

The file was

returned to the clerk only in the last week as it could not be
traced out earlier. One of the objections of the registry was
that the copy of the award was not filed. It is alleged that it
took about two weeks to get the copy of the award but for
certain reasons, the objection petition could not be refiled
due to oversight of the office of the Advocate for the
objector/petitioner as the Advocate was not feeling well in the
month of August, 2007. On her discharge from the hospital on
20th August, 2007, the matter was refiled on 22 nd August,
2007 after removing the objections. Therefore the delay was
OMP No.484/2007

not deliberately but due to genuine reasons. The petitioner
has prayed for condonation of delay in refiling the objection
petition.

2.

Section 5 of the Limitation Act does not apply to

objection petition under section 34 of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as “Act”). The
period of limitation for filing an objection petition under this
section is contained in the said section itself. Section 34, (3)
of the Act reads as follows:-

“(3)
An application for setting aside
may not be made after three months
have elapsed from the date on which
the party making that application had
received the arbitral award or, if a
request had been made under section
33, from the date on which that request
had been disposed of by the arbitral
tribunal:
Provided that if the Court is
satisfied that the
applicant
was
prevented by sufficient cause from
making the application within the said
period of three months it may entertain
the application within a further period
of thirty days, but not thereafter”.
3.

Thus it is clear that objection petition to the award has

to be filed within three months of the service of the award on
the concerned party. The court has the power to extend the
period for filing the objection petition by another 30 days

OMP No.484/2007

Page 3 of 7

provided it is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by
sufficient cause from making the application within the said
period of three months. However, it is made clear that under
no circumstances the said period of 30 days can not be
extended thereafter.

4.

The award

in this case

was

pronounced on 6 th

September, 2006.

The objection petition was filed only on

26th May, 2007.

It seems that claimant had filed the

application under section 33 of the said Act for modification
of the award which was allowed on 27th January, 2007 and
the award was modified to the extend of correction of
typographical error regarding awarding of interest to the
claimant. Against this order petitioner filed application under
section 13 and 18 of the said Act which was dismissed vide
order

dated

28th

February,

2007

with

the

following

observations:-

“Since in the main order only
those errors were rectified that were
apparent on the face of the record, the
application under Section 13 and 18 of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act
moved by the claimant does not lie and
is hereby dismissed.”

5.

None of these two orders dated 27th January, 2007 and

OMP No.484/2007

Page 4 of 7

28th February, 2007 have been challenged. It is the award as
modified vide order dated 27th January, 2007 which has been
challenged by the applicant before this court.

6.

Therefore, the petitioner was required to file

objection petition within the period of limitation as prescribed
under section 34 (3) of the Act.

He failed to file objection

petition during the said period. He did not move to the court
with

any

application

indicating

sufficient

cause

which

prevented him from filing the objection petition within the
said period of three months, for extension of period of 30
days for filing the objection petition. As pointed out above,
the present objection petition was filed only on 26th May,
2007 i.e. after about 8½ months of the pronouncement of the
judgment.

No objection petition was filed even after the

correction in the award was carried out vide order dated 27 th
January,

2007

within

the

said

period

of

limitation.

Therefore, petitioner is not entitle to any condonation of
delay in filing or re-filing the objection petition. The period of
limitation started running against the petition for filing of the
objection petition immediately after the award was served
upon him but not after the application under Section 13 and
18 of the said Act was dismissed.

After the filing of the petition in the registry it seems

that one Mohd. Imran had been checking with the registry
about any defect in the petition.

Admittedly, the dealing

clerk had checked and pointed out the defects on 29th May,
2007 itself. The clerk got the file from the registry only in the
last week of June. There were number of defects pointed out
and one of the objections was that copy of the award was not
filed with the objection petition. It is not explained as to why
it took about two weeks to the petitioner to get the copy of
the award when he himself was served with the award and
had received the copy of the same. Surprisingly, even after
receipt of the copy of the award, which must have been
received by middle of July, 2007, objections were not
removed and the objection petition

was not refiled.

Mrs.

Rachna Gupta, Advocate for the petitioner fell ill only in the
month of August, 2007. The Objection petition could have
been filed in July itself. There is no explanation why the
objection petition was not refiled in July itself.

The

application is supported by an affidavit only of Mohd. Imran,
clerk of Mrs. Rachna Gupta. There is no other documentary
evidence on the record to indicate that counsel for the
petitioner was indisposed in the month of August, 2007 and
was admitted in the hospital on 16th August, 2007 where she
remained for two days only.

Under

these

circumstances,

I

conclude

that

petitioner has not been able to satisfy the court that it was
prevented by sufficient cause from filing the objection
petition within the period of three months or further period of
30 days with an application for extension of time. Therefore,
application is hereby dismissed.

OMP No.484/2007

Since the objection petition is barred by period of
limitation as per the provision contained in section 34 sub
section 3 of the Act, the same is hereby dismissed.
