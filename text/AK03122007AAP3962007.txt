ANIL KUMAR, J.(Oral)

1.

This is a petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act, 1996 for the appointment of an arbitrator in terms of
arbitration agreement between the parties as the disputes have
arisen.

2.

The notice of the petition was issued to the respondent,

however, despite opportunity given to the respondent, reply has not
AA No.396/2007

Page 1 of 9

been filed and consequently the pleas and averments raised by the
petitioner have not been denied by the respondent.

3.

The petitioner is a Government Contractors and General Orders

Suppliers. The petitioner contended that the respondents invited
tender for work under the name and style of “Restoration and
Upgradation of old building at Lahori Gate to be used as museum of
walled city in the city zone”.

4.

Pursuant to the notice inviting tender, the petitioner submitted

the tender for the aforesaid work which was accepted and the work
was

awarded

to

the

petitioner

by

work

order

no. D/EE

(PR.)CZ/TC/2003/3 dated 9th April, 2003. The total amount for the
tender was Rs.34,20,360/-and an amount of Rs.86,000/- was paid as
earnest money to the respondents. According to the petitioner the
work was completed by the petitioner to the satisfaction of all
concerned on 18th October, 2003 within the stipulated period of the
work order. Thereafter the first, second and third running bills were
prepared, payments against which were made by the respondents and
there was a delay of 41 days, 723 days and 712 days in making the
payments of first, second and third running bills respectively. Since
the amounts which were due were not paid within time, the
respondents became liable to pay interest on the delayed payment of
AA No.396/2007

Page 2 of 9

the abovementioned running bills.

5.

According to the petitioner thereafter a fourth and final bill was

prepared and passed for payment on 22nd July, 2004 against which
no payment has been made by the respondent till date and the deficit
liability period of six month has also expired. The petitioner pleaded
that there was a delay of approximately 974 days in the payment of
90% of the earnest money and the security deposit by the respondent
to the petitioner in respect of which also the respondent have become
liable to pay interest. The petitioner contended that despite repeated
visits and oral requests the payment in respect of IV/final bill has not
been made by the respondents.

6.

Consequently disputes have arisen between the parties. There is

an arbitration agreement between the parties for adjudication of the
disputes by an arbitrator in terms of clause 25 of the agreement.
Clause 25 of the agreement containing the arbitration agreement is as
under:“Clause 25:
Settlement of Disputes and Arbitration
Except where otherwise provided in the contract all questions
and disputes relating to the meaning of the specifications
designs, drawings and instructions hereinbefore mentioned
and as to the quality of workmanship or materials as used on
the work or as to any other question, claim, right, matter or
thing whatsoever in any way arising out of or relating to the

AA No.396/2007

Page 3 of 9

contract
designs,
drawings,
specifications,
estimates
instructions orders or these conditions or otherwise concerning
the works or the execution or failure to execute the same
whether arising during the progress of the work or after the
cancellation, termination completion or abandonment thereof
shall be dealt with as mentioned hereinafter:
i)

If the contractor considers any work demanded of him
to be outside the requirement of the contract, or disputes any drawings, record or decision given in writing
by the Engineer in charge on any matter in connection
with or arising out of the contract of carrying out of the
work, to be unacceptable, he shall promptly within 15
days request the Superintending Engineer in writing for
written instructions or decision. Thereupon, the Superintending engineer shall give his written instructions or
decision within a period of one month from the receipt
of contractor’s letter.
If the Superintending engineer fails to give his
instructions or decision in writing within the aforesaid
period or if the contract are is dissatisfied with the
instructions or decision of the Superintending engineer,
the contract may, within 15 days of the receipt of
Superintending Engineer’s decision, appeal to the chief
engineer who shall afford an opportunity to the
contractor to be heard, if the latter so desires, and to
offer evidence in support of his appeal. The chief
engineer shall give his decision within 30 days of the
receipt of contractor’s appeal.
If the contractor is
dissatisfied with this decision, the contractor shall
within a period of 30 days from receipt of the decision,
give notice to the Commissioner MCD for appointment of
arbitrator failing which the said decision shall be final
binding and conclusive and not referable to adjudication
by the arbitrator.

ii).

Except where the decision has become final, binding
and conclusive in terms of sub Para (i) above disputes or
differences shall be referred for adjudication through
arbitration a sole arbitrator appointed by the
Commissioner MCD. If the arbitrator so appointed is
unable or unwilling to act or resigns his appointment or
vacates his office due to any reason whatsoever another

AA No.396/2007

Page 4 of 9

sole arbitrator shall be appointed in the manner
aforesaid. Such personal shall be entitled to proceed
with the reference from the stage at which it was left by
his predecessor.
It is a term of this contract that the party
invoking arbitration shall give a list of disputes with
amounts claimed in respect of each such dispute along
with the notice for appointment of arbitrator and giving
reference to the rejection by the chief engineer of the
appeal.
It is also a term of this contract that no person
other than a person appointed by such Commissioner
MCD as aforesaid should act as arbitrator and if for any
reason that is not possible, the matter shall not be
referred to arbitration at all.
It is also a term of this contract that if the
contractor does not make any demand for appointment
of arbitrator in respect of any claims in writing as
aforesaid within 120 days of receiving the intimation
from the Engineer in charge that the final bill is ready
for payment, the claim of the contractor shall be deemed
to have been waived and absolutely barred and MCD be
shall be discharged and released of all liabilities under
the contract in respect of these claims.
The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance
with the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act,1996 (26 of 1996) or any statutory modification or
re-enactment thereof and the rules made thereunder
and for the time being in force shall apply to the
arbitration proceedings under this clause
It is also a term of this contract that the
arbitrator shall adjudicate on only such disputes as are
referred to him by the appointing authority and give
separate award against each dispute and claim referred
to him and in all cases where the total amount of the
claims by any party exceeds Rs. 1,00,000 the arbitrator
shall give reasons for the award.
It is also a term of the contract that if any fees are
payable to the arbitrator these shall be paid equally by
both the parties.
It is also a term of the contract that the arbitrator

AA No.396/2007

Page 5 of 9

submit their statement of claims and counter statement

place as may be fixed by the arbitrator in his sole
discretion. The fees, if any, of the arbitration shall, if
required to be paid before the award is made and

The cost of the reference and of the award (including the
fees, if any, of the Arbitrator) shall be in the discretion of
the arbitrator who made direct to any by whom and in
what manner, such cost or any part thereof shall be
paid and fix or settle the amount of cost to be so paid.”

7.

Since no payment was forthcoming in respect of the final bill as

raised by the petitioner despite repeated requests, therefore, the
petitioner wrote letters dated 18th July, 2006, 20th February, 2007 and
8th March, 2007 addressed to the Executive Engineer, Superintendent
Engineer and Chief Engineer respectively demanding release of
payment on the final bill along with security deposits due to the
petitioner which letters were neither replied nor the payments were
made. In the facts and circumstances the petitioner was constrained
to invoke the arbitration clause and issued a letter dated 7th May,
2007 addressed to the Commissioner and demanded appointment of
an arbitrator in terms of arbitration agreement to adjudicate the
disputes between the parties. No reply to this letter was also given.

8.

Consequently, the petitioner has filed the present petition and

despite opportunity given, the respondents have not filed any reply
and in any case failed to appoint the arbitrator within 30 days from
AA No.396/2007

Page 6 of 9

the receipt of the notice invoking the arbitration agreement and even
before filing the present petition. In the circumstances, the pleas of
the petitioner that there is an arbitration agreement in terms of clause
25 and that the respondent has forfeited his rights to appoint an
arbitrator cannot be refuted.
9.

The learned counsel for the respondent has contended, without

filing any reply, that the respondents are willing to settle the claims of
the petitioner and offered an amount which offer has been declined by
the petitioner as the amount offered by the respondent is much less
than the amount claimed by the petitioner as reflected in the
statement of claims filed along with the petition. The learned counsel
for the respondents is unable to give any reason for not appointing an
arbitrator on demand being raised by the petitioner nor any
explanation has been given as to how appointment of an arbitrator
could be withheld on the ground of an offer being made.

10.

A learned Single Judge in Haryana Telecom Ltd. v. Union of

India & Anr., 112 (2004) DLT 339=2004 (3) RAJ 147, had held that if
the respondent fails to appoint an Arbitrator within the stipulated
time of 30 days of the notice, and even after filing of the petition
under Section 11 of the Act, it is for the Court to appoint an
Arbitrator. A Division Bench of this Court in Delkon (India) Pvt. Ltd.
v. G.M., Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., 120 (2005) DLT 542 (DB),
AA No.396/2007

Page 7 of 9

relying on Datar Switchgears Ltd Vs Tata Finance Ltd has held in
para 4 is as under:
“4. We have given our careful consideration to the
arguments advanced by learned Counsel for both the
parties. In view of the law laid down in the case of Datar
Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance Ltd. & Anr., IV (2000)
CLT 191 (SC)=VII (2000) SLT 543=JT 2000 (Suppl. 2) SC
226 it is no more res integra that the vacancy can be
supplied by a party pursuant to the arbitration agreement
even after thirty days of the receipt of the notice. However,
once a party approaches the Court and files a petition for
appointment by the designated authority of the Chief
Justice of that Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, the right to supply vacancy by the
opposite party is extinguished. If that right stood
extinguished on filing of the petition under Section 11(6)
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, in September
1998 the appointment of an Arbitrator on 3rd May, 1999
could not be made, therefore in our view, the order
passed by the learned Single Judge on 7th May, 1999
suffers from patent illegality. Therefore, the submission of
the respondent that the petitioner had appeared before
the Arbitrator and the application of the petitioner raising
preliminary objections is pending adjudication which
inter alia challenges the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to
decide the dispute is of no consequence as from the order
reproduced above it was pursuant to the directions
passed by the learned Single Judge that the parties were
directed to appear before the Arbitrator. The petitioner
had no other option but to appear before the Arbitrator
and after appearing before the Arbitrator the petitioner
has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator,
rather has at first opportunity taken the objection that
the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to proceed with the
matter.
11.

In Union of India v. M/s. R.R. Industries, 120 (2005) DLT 572

(DB) also it was held that once a party does not supply the vacancy or
fails to supply the vacancy before filing of a petition under Section
11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, such a party forfeits the
AA No.396/2007

Page 8 of 9

right to supply the vacancy in terms of the arbitration clause and
what remains is only the arbitration clause, i.e. the dispute has to be
resolved under the mechanism of alternative dispute redressal
scheme but no right survives to the respondent to supply the named
Arbitrator in the arbitration clause. Thus the arbitrator was to be
appointed before the filing of the petition and since no arbitrator has
been appointed by the respondent consequently, the respondent has
lost its right to appoint the arbitrator in terms of clause 25 of the
arbitration agreement.

12.

and
