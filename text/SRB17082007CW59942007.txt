1.

Issue notice. Ms. Anjana Gosain, learned counsel accepts notice on behalf of the

New Delhi Municipal Committee (hereafter “NDMC”). With consent of counsel for the
parties, the matter was heard finally.
2.

The petitioner challenges an order dated 22.12.2006

by which it was been

debarred from tendering for a period of two years. The impugned order was made by the
NDMC. The petitioner was awarded a consultancy contract in 2003 for technical repair
and desilting of SWD system in NDMC area under sub-head survey of SWD system for
GIS mapping.

The price bid was submitted pursuant to the NDMC's request on

28.5.2003. The petitioner was informed that its tender was accepted on 8.8.2003. It is
W.P.(C) 5994/2007

1 of 8

not disputed that thereafter the petitioner commenced its work. Apparently, the petitioner
was executing the contract till 15.7.2004 when the respondent acting through its
Executive Engineer(Drainage) rescinded it. This was preceded what was termed as a
final show cause notice on 22.2.2004. It is further not disputed that the decision was
accepted by the petitioner who did not seek legal recourse.
3.

On 8.6.2006, the NDMC issued a show cause notice proposing to debar the

petitioner from tendering with it for a period of two years. The show cause notice reads
as follows:
“To,
M/s. Integrated Techno System (P) Ltd.

Opposite Khel Gaon,
New Delhi – 49.
Sub: - T/R and desilting of SWD system in NDMC area.

The petitioner replied to this show cause notice and recorded its objections by

letters dated 22.6.2006 and 27.9.2006. The communications were detailed and it sought
to give particulars about the claims that the petitioner proposed against the NDMC.
5.

On 22.12.2006, the NDMC issued the impugned order, in the following terms:
“D.No./A-III/254/CE(C)-I/SR.A.O. (W )-I

Dated 22.12.2006

To
M/s. Integrated Techno System )P) Ltd.

Learned counsel for the petitioner urged that the NDMC did not possess the power

W.P.(C) 5994/2007

3 of 8

to issue the impugned order; no term in the contract enabled the respondent to propose or
take action debarring the present petitioner. It was contended on the merits further that
during the subsistence of the contract the inter se correspondence between the parties
establishes that at every stage the NDMC, its staff and its agencies were obstructing and
not co-operating with the petitioner in the smooth functioning and execution of the
contract. Learned counsel relied upon letters written by it in this regard on 22.2.2004,
16.3.2004 and other communications. He also relied upon the replies of the NDMC dated
10.2.2004 and 5.2.2004, which he submitted were virtually admissions that the contract
could not be completed or executed properly due to the deficiencies and non-cooperation
of the NDMC staff.
7.

Learned counsel contended that the action of the NDMC, besides being contrary

to the contract and unlawful is also arbitrary as it has debarred the petitioner for a period
of two years from participating in tender and commercial activities of the NDMC. Its
business and right to carry on profession has been gravely imperilled.

These were

unreasonable, as they deprived the petitioner the opportunity to carry on business with
NDMC.
8.

Learned counsel for the respondent NDMC resisted the petition. She submitted

that this proceeding is not maintainable since the petitioner has neither taken exception to
the recession made as far as on 15.7.2004 nor did he approach this Court within
reasonable time. Learned counsel contended that the impugned order of debarring was
made on 22.12.2006 i.e. almost eight months ago. If the petitioner was really aggrieved
by it he could have approached within reasonable time which in this case is a couple of
W.P.(C) 5994/2007

4 of 8

months.

Not having done so, it cannot rely upon the grounds which impelled the

NDMC to rescind the contract to challenge the impugned debarring order. Learned
counsel contended that the decision to debar the petitioner cannot be challenged on the
grounds that the recession was improper. According to her these two decisions are
different and have differing

consequences.

If the petitioner was aggrieved on the

recession he ought to have raised that aspect by seeking appropriate remedy; not having
done so, his claim in that regard is not maintainable.
9.

Learned counsel contended that a public authority like NDMC has sufficient

flexibility to enter into contracts which include the power to decide not to enter into
contract with a particular agency or concern. Having regard to the past performance of
the petitioner concerned, a private agency, the NDMC acting in public interest fairly
issued a show cause notice and granted sufficient opportunity to the petitioner to meet
with its allegations. Being dissatisfied with the response, the NDMC proceeded to issue
the impugned order. There was nothing unfair or arbitrary with such an order.
10.

The above facts would show that the petitioner had without doubt not challenged

the recession. According to the term of the contract entered into between the NDMC and
the petitioner, if the latter is aggrieved it is entitled to invoke the arbitration under Clause
25. The petitioner seems to be aware of it as it is evident from some of its letters written
to the NDMC subsequent to the recession on 15.7.2004. The question however is
whether the facts persuaded the authority to act as it did in rescinding the contract could
also be considered while debarring the petitioner.
11.

It is well settled that the State or its instrumentalities and agencies like the

W.P.(C) 5994/2007

5 of 8

NDMC do not act differently from private bodies while entering into contract. The super
added obligation, however , in the case of public bodies is that their character as public
agencies cast an additional responsibility upon them to act fairly and non-arbitrarily. The
Court had recognised this while entering into contracts. The Supreme Court had stated in
State of M.P. vs. Nand Lal, 1986(4) SCC 566 that public bodies and state
instrumentalities are afforded “free play in the joints”. The Courts are alive to the power
of the public agencies to enter into contracts and also rescind contracts. One other
principle which is well settled is that the grounds for rescinding the contract or cancelling
commercial obligation are ordinarily not subject to judicial review under Article 226.
Therefore, the question of deciding whether the debarring order, was rightly based upon a
recession to rescind is not open under Article 226.
12.

The jurisdiction of the Court under Article 226 in a case of present type where a

debarring order is impugned is to scrutinize whether the public agency adopted a fair
procedure i.e. in issuing the concern a show cause notice and giving sufficient
opportunity to represent against the proposed. Indeed the reported decisions in Erusian
Equipment & Chemicals Ltd. vs. state of West Bengal, 1975 (1) SCC 70; Raghunath
Thakur vs. State of bihar, 1989 (1) SCC 229 and B.S.N. Joshi vs. Nair Coal Services Ltd.,
2006 (11) SCC 548 have settled the law on this score. The Court will intervene if it is
satisfied that the procedure adopted was unfair, or there was some illegality. In this case,
there is no dispute that the impugned order was preceded by a show cause notice dated
8.6.2006; the petitioner was given sufficient opportunity; it resisted the show cause
notice by letters dated 22.6.2006 and 27.9.2006. The impugned order was made after
W.P.(C) 5994/2007

6 of 8

considering these replies.
13.

It has been often remarked that the Court in judicial review proceedings under

Article 226 is more concerned with the process of decision making rather than the merits
of the decision. It does not don the hat of the decision maker or a super-appellate
administrative body, examine the soundness of the action. (Directorate of Education vs.
Educomp Datamatics Ltd., 2004 (4) SCC 19; Ramchandra Murarilal Bhattad vs. state of
Maharastra, 2007(2) SCC 588). Although the reach and amplitude of the Court is fairly
wide, the Court ordinarily desists from entering into an arena of primary decision making.
In this case, the primary decision maker is the NDMC. In such a case, the duty of the
Court is to see whether the decision was arrived at after following a fair procedure,
considering the relevant factors, and ignoring irrelevant facts.

There is nothing on

record to suggest that the NDMC did not do so. Its show cause notice, consideration of
reply and the consideration of the previous record of the petitioner were all relevant
factors. In these circumstances, I am unpersuaded that the impugned order is either
arbitrary or suffers from an legal infirmity.
14.

For the above reasons, the petition has to fail.

This does not preclude the

petitioner's right to invoke arbitration under Clause 25. If such request is pending, the
same shall be decided and appropriate decision communicated to the petitioner within
two weeks from today.
15.

The writ petition and CM 11145/2007 are dismissed, but subject to the above

directions. No costs.
