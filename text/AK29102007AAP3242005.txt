AA No.324/2005
This is a petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 for appointment of the arbitrator.
The petitioner has contended that he is a MCD contractor and
pursuant to a short notice inviting tender dated 8.5.2000 for desilting
the open nalla from Shahpur Culvert to Subhash Nagar, New Delhi he
had applied and filed a tender which was accepted and he has carried
out the work.
According to the petitioner there is an arbitration agreement
between the parties and pursuant to the work executed by the
petitioner disputes have arisen. The petitioner has given a notice
dated 26.5.2004 seeking appointment of the arbitrator in terms of the
arbitration agreement between the parties, however, no arbitrator was
appointed.
The petition is contested by the respondents contending that
the claim of the petitioner is barred by time and the proper procedure
has not been adopted.
Considering the facts and circumstances the pleas of the
AA No.324/2005

Page 2 of 8

respondents are prima facie untenable. Prima facie the claim of the
petitioner does not seem to be barred by time. The bill was passed by
the respondent and the net amount was Rs.79,993/- after deduction
of Rs.6314/-. The petitioner has been returned the earnest money of
Rs.4000/- after six months after the bill was passed on 27th May,
2001. While passing the bill an endorsement was made to pay the
amount of Rs.79,993/-. The amount was not paid nor it was
categorically refused. Therefore, a notice of demand dated 26th May,
2004 was sent. Since the respondent refused to pay the amount after
notice of demand and nothing has been produced prior to date of the
notice that the respondent refused to pay the amount, therefore, the
claim of the petitioner is prima facie within time. In any case whether
the claim of the petitioner is barred by time or not is to be adjudicated
finally by the arbitrator. On the pleas and contentions of the parties,
it can not be inferred that the claim of the petitioner is barred by time.
The other dispute raised by the petitioner is that the
appointment of arbitrator is sought without going through the
arbitration procedure stipulated in the arbitration agreement. The
arbitration agreement is in terms of clause 25 contained in agreement
no. GW-135, which is as under:
'Clause 25
Settlement of Disputes and Arbitration
Except where otherwise provided in the contract all
questions and disputes relating to the meaning of the
AA No.324/2005

specifications designs, drawings and instructions

any other question, claim, right, matter or thing whatsoever

1. If the contract considers any work demanded of him to

days request the Superintending Engineer in writing for
written instructions or decision. Thereupon, the Superintending engineer shall give his written instructions or
decision within a period of one month from the receipt
of contractor’s letter.
If the Superintending engineer fails to give his
instructions or decision in writing within the
aforesaid period or if the contract are is dissatisfied
with
the
instructions
or decision
of
the
Superintending engineer, the contract may, within
15 days of the receipt of Superintending Engineer’s
decision, appeal to the chief engineer who shall
afford an opportunity to the contractor to be heard, if
the latter so desires, and to offer evidence in support
of his appeal. The chief engineer shall give his
decision within 30 days of the receipt of contractor’s
appeal. If the contractor is dissatisfied with this
decision, the contractor shall within a period of 30
days from receipt of the decision, give notice to the
Commissioner MCD for appointment of arbitrator
failing which the said decision shall be final binding
and conclusive and not referable to adjudication by

the arbitrator.

AA No.324/2005

Except where the decision has become final, binding
and conclusive in terms of sub Para (i) above

the matter shall not be referred to arbitration at all.
It is also a term of this contract that if the
contractor does not make any demand for

intimation from the Engineer in charge that the final
bill is ready for payment, the claim of the contractor
shall be deemed to have been waived and
absolutely barred and MCD be shall be discharged
and released of all liabilities under the contract in
respect of these claims.

Page 5 of 8

shall apply to the arbitration proceedings under this
clause
It is also a term of this contract that the
arbitrator shall adjudicate on only such disputes as
are referred to him by the appointing authority and
give separate award against each dispute and claim
referred to him and in all cases where the total
amount of the claims by any party exceeds Rs.
1,00,000 the arbitrator shall give reasons for the
award.
It is also a term of the contract that if any fees
are payable to the arbitrator these shall be paid
equally by both the parties.
It is also a term of the contract that the
arbitrator shall be deemed to have entered on the
reference on the day he issues notice to both the
parties calling them to submit their statement of
claims and counter statement of claims. The venue
of the arbitration shall be such place as may be
fixed by the arbitrator in his sole discretion. The
fees, if any, of the arbitration shall, if required to be
paid before the award is made and published, be
paid half and half by each of the parties. The cost of
the reference and of the award (including the fees, if
any, of the Arbitrator) shall be in the discretion of the
arbitrator who made direct to any by whom and in
what manner, such cost or any part thereof shall be
paid and fix or settle the amount of cost to be so
paid.

The petitioner has contended that agreement GW-135 was
executed by the petitioner with the respondent which contains an
arbitration agreement in terms of clause 25. This fact has not been
disputed rather what is alleged is that the petitioner should be
directed to produce the original agreement. The learned counsel for

AA No.324/2005

Page 6 of 8

the petitioner has contended that the original agreement is with the
respondent which has not been produced. The respondent also
alleged that the dispute raised by the petitioner is outside the ambit of
Clause 25 of the agreement which is the arbitration agreement. In
totality of circumstances, it is inevitable to infer that there is
arbitration agreement between the parties which is reproduced
hereinabove.
The respondent also failed to appoint an arbitrator within four
weeks of notice being given by the petitioner for appointment of an
arbitrator. Even after filing of the petition the arbitrator has not been
appointed.
A learned Single Judge in Haryana Telecom Ltd. v. Union of
India & Anr., 112 (2004) DLT 339=2004 (3) RAJ 147, had held that if
the respondent fails to appoint an Arbitrator within the stipulated
time of 30 days of the notice, and even after filing of the petition
under Section 11 of the Act, it is for the Court to appoint an
Arbitrator. Learned Counsel for the petitioner relied on this judgment
and states that position is similar in the present case, since in the
present case also notice was issued to the respondent and even after
receipt of notice, no Arbitrator has been appointed by the respondent.
It is contented that even after filing of the present petition till date,
Arbitrator to resolve the disputes between the parties has not been
appointed by the respondent.

petitioner is of about Rs.79,000 with interest and costs. Considering
these facts the fees of the arbitrator shall be Rs.10,000/- payable by
the petitioner. The parties shall appear before the arbitrator on
