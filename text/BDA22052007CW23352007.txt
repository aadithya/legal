BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J
1.

The petitioner is a student of the Delhi Public School, Mathura

Road, New Delhi.

She has filed this writ petition because she has been

detained in class XI by the said school and her representation against such
detention has also been rejected by the review committee on 12.02.2007. The
impugned rejection letter dated 12.02.2007 reveals that the review committee
WP(C)2335/2007

Page No.1 of 11

had considered the application of the petitioner for review of the final result
and that the said committee had concluded that the result was in conformity
with the school rules leaving no scope for any change. The petitioner's parents
were requested to direct the petitioner to attend regular classes for class XI
from 1st April, 2007 with seriousness and regularity.

2.

The petitioner had previously appeared in the class X examinations

conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education in March, 2006.
Thereafter, in April 2006, the petitioner was provisionally promoted to class XI
as were all other students who appeared in the Board Examinations. However,
though the petitioner had opted for the science stream, she was not permitted to
take up that stream on account of the fact that in the pre-board examination, the
petitioner had secured only 66.6 % marks in the aggregate.

3.

In May 2006 the class X CBSE results were declared and the

petitioner secured 88% marks in the aggregate and 89% in integrated science.
In June 2006, because of her good performance in the CBSE Board
Examinations, the petitioner was given an opportunity by the school to opt for
the science stream. She opted for the same. Thereafter, she continue to attend
classes and appear in the internal examinations of the school.

The examination system of the school is that there is a first report

and a second report and then the final result is declared. The first report
comprises of various components which includes the practical and theory half
yearly exams as well as the weekly tests and assignments. In each of the
reports the assignments have been marked out of 5 marks, the weekly tests
carry a total of 25 marks, the practical exams are marked out of 30 and the
theory papers are marked out of 70. The petitioner's mark-sheet, as set out in
Annexure P-7 to the petition, indicates that the petitioner had obtained more
than 33% marks in all the papers (theory and practical) in the first report.
However, in the second report the petitioner had obtained 13 marks and 12
marks in Physics theory and Chemistry theory, respectively.

These marks

were each out of 70. This meant that the petitioner got 18.6% marks in the
Physics theory paper and 17.1% in Chemistry theory. However, she passed in
all her practical examinations. It may also be pointed out that the petitioner
obtained 13 marks and 9 marks, both out of 25 marks, in Physics and
Chemistry respectively in the weekly tests in respect of the first report. The
petitioner, similarly, in respect of the second report, received 9 marks and 7-1/2
marks in weekly tests in respect of Physics and Chemistry respectively, both of
which were allotted out of a total of 25 marks each. Accordingly, the petitioner
obtained the following set of marks in Physics and Chemistry throughout the
year in the weekly tests as well as the half yearly examinations:-

The counsel for the respondents submitted that the examination

bye-laws of the Central Board of Secondary Education are applicable.

The

scheme of examinations and the pass criteria is set out in Chapter 7 of the byelaws.

Rule 37 relates to general conditions. Rule 37(i) stipulates that the

scheme of examinations and pass criteria for All India/ Delhi Senior School
Certificate and All India/ Delhi Secondary Examinations conducted by the
Board, shall be as laid down from time to time. Rule 37(ii) provides as under:“(ii) Class XI/IX examinations shall be conducted internally
by the schools themselves.”
6.

Earlier, the CBSE had not prescribed any specific extent of marks

that were required to be obtained by class XI students for promotion to class
XII. However, this lacuna was remedied by introduction of Rule 40.1(vi) in
the said examination bye-laws. The same reads as under:“40.1(vi): In order to be declared as having passed the class XI
Examination a candidate shall obtain 33% marks in all the
subjects. The pass marks in each subject of examination shall
be 33%. In case of subject involving practical work a candidate
must obtain 33% marks in theory and 33% in practical
separately in addition to 33% marks in aggregate in order to
qualify in that subject.”

WP(C)2335/2007

Page No.4 of 11

It is an admitted position that the class XII examinations are to be conducted by
the CBSE and, therefore, this Rule 40.1(vi) of the examination bye-laws would
have to be complied with and the rules as prescribed by the Directorate of
Education in respect of schools in Delhi in pursuance of Rule 41 of the Delhi
School Education Rules, 1973 would to that extent be superseded by the
provisions of Rule 40.1 (vi) of the examination bye-laws as amended. The said
amendment was brought about pursuant to the recommendations of the
examination committee which were duly ratified by the governing body of the
Central Board of Secondary Education in its meeting held on 30.06.2006. A
plain reading of the said newly added rule makes it clear that for any student to
be declared as having passed the class IX examination, albeit conducted
internally by the school themselves, he/ she must have obtained 33% marks in
all the subjects and in cases of subjects involving practical work, he/ she must
have obtained 33% in theory and 33% marks in practicals separately in addition
to 33% marks in aggregate in order to qualify in that subject.

7.

Going back to the marks obtained by the petitioner, I find that

insofar as the practical exams are concerned, the petitioner obtained more than
33% marks in both Physics as well as Chemistry in both the reports and
consequently in the final result also. However, if the theory marks in Physics
are to be taken for the first and second half yearly exams, the petitioner
obtained 36 marks out of a possible 140 marks which would amount to 25.7%.

WP(C)2335/2007

Page No.5 of 11

Insofar as Chemistry is concerned, the combined marks of the first and second
half yearly examinations would be 40 marks out of a total of 140 which would
come to 28.6% marks. The learned counsel for the petitioner insisted that in
computing the marks for the subject for the year even the weekly tests and
assignments ought to be taken into account.

Insofar as assignments are

concerned, the same cannot be considered at all because the bye-laws speak of
33% marks in “examinations” and assignments do not fall within the category
of examinations.

However, weekly tests may be considered for the purposes

of computing the marks obtained by the petitioner in the two subjects in which
she finds herself in difficulty. If the aggregate of weekly tests and half yearly
examinations are taken then the petitioner would get 58 marks out of a total of
190, which would translate to 30.5%. Similarly, for Chemistry, the petitioner
would get a total of 56.5 marks out of a maximum of 190 marks, which would
mean that she would have obtained 29.7% marks for Chemistry. This makes it
clear that going strictly by the marks obtained by the petitioner, whether the
weekly tests marks are included or not, the petitioner does not have the
requisite 33% marks for Physics theory and Chemistry theory.

8.

Faced with this position, the learned counsel for the petitioner

submitted that the petitioner ought to be provided with an opportunity of a retest in both the papers. She made this submission in view of the fact that the
science stream was awarded to the petitioner only in June, 2006 after she had

WP(C)2335/2007

Page No.6 of 11

already undergone study in another stream from April, 2006. She submitted
that due to the shortened duration of her study period, her performance in the
second half yearly examinations was not up to the mark and if another
opportunity is provided then the petitioner would be able to clear both the
papers with good marks in each of them.
9.

However, the learned counsel for the respondents submitted that

the choice of stream was changed on the request of the petitioner after the class
X CBSE results were declared. So the petitioner knew very well that there was
a shortened duration of study and she would have to cope with the same.
Secondly, it was submitted on behalf of all the respondents that a re-test or a
compartment examination could be held only in respect of one paper and not
two papers as that was impermissible.

10.

Since, the re-test route was also not possible, the learned counsel

for the petitioner then submitted that the petitioner could be awarded grace
marks as per the applicable rules. In this context the learned counsel for the
CBSE submitted that the examination bye-laws are silent with respect to the
award of grace marks.

The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

Directorate of Education, Government of NCT of Delhi (the respondent No.3)
submitted that as per the instructions framed under Rule 41 of the Delhi
Education Rules, 1973, grace marks can be awarded for class IX and XI
examinations. The relevant instruction is instruction 35.

WP(C)2335/2007

Page No.7 of 11

11.

The learned counsel who appeared on behalf of the Delhi Public

School, submitted that, as stated in the affidavit of the Principal dated
14.05.2007, a student can be awarded a maximum of 5 grace marks in one
subject only to enable his promotion to the next class. He also submitted that
both, the award of grace marks and the option of appearing in a compartment
examination, were not permitted to be availed of simultaneously.

12.

The school almanac of the Delhi Public School does not mention

any rule with regard to the grant of grace marks. It is only in the affidavit that
the respondent school has mentioned that grace marks to the extent of 5 marks
in the maximum and for one subject only is permissible.

13.

Looking at the position taken by the three respondents, it is

apparent that the examination bye-laws issued by the CBSE do not speak of
any grace marks. However, it is also clear that Rule 37(ii) of the bye-laws
prescribes that the class XI and IX examinations are to be conducted internally
by the schools themselves. At this juncture, it would be relevant to refer to the
instructions which have been issued by the Administrator of Delhi with regard
to assessment, evaluation and promotion of students from one class to another
for classes I to IX and XI w.e.f 2001-2002. These instructions have been
issued under Rule 41 of the Delhi School Education Rules, 1973, which in turn,

WP(C)2335/2007

Page No.8 of 11

have been issued under the Delhi School Education Act, 1973. Second 3 of the
said Act empowers the Administrator to regulate education in schools and it
provides that the Administrator may regulate education in all schools in Delhi
in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder.
The instructions referred to above were issued in respect of all government and
recognized aided and unaided schools in the National Capital Territory of Delhi
and they were directed to follow the same with effect from the session of 20012002. Instruction 35 pertains to the grant of grace marks for classes IX and XI.
The same reads as under:“35. Grace Marks for Classes IX and XI: Grace marks upto
a maximum of 10 in all, shall be awarded to a student to reach
the minimum required 33% of marks in each of the subject (s),
subject to the condition that a minimum of 25% of marks shall
be secured in each subject at the comprehensive test as per
Rule 29 to make him eligible for promotion, provided he/ she
does not require more than 5 marks in a subject to come upto
the minimum required of 33% of marks in that subject.
However, no grace marks shall be awarded to a student taking
the compartment examination.”
Instruction 37 may also be noticed, which reads as under:-

14.

“37. All Recognised Unaided schools are required to comply
with these instructions and no dilution of the criteria
prescribed is permissible under any circumstances.
If,
however, a recognised Unaided school desires to have more
stringent criteria than those prescribed in these instructions, it
can do so provided it has sought and obtained the prior
approval of the Director of Education. All such requests must
reach the Office of the Director of Education by 30th April of
the session at the latest.”
If the said Instructions are to be followed then the petitioner would

be entitled to a maximum of 10 grace marks to reach the minimum of 33%
marks subject to the condition that a minimum of 25% marks shall be secured
WP(C)2335/2007

Page No.9 of 11

in each subject at the comprehensive test as per Rule 29, to make him eligible
for promotion. The petitioner has obtained the minimum of 25% marks in both
Physics and Chemistry for the theory papers in the half yearly examinations.
She had also obtained more than 25% marks, if the weekly tests are also
included. However, in case the weekly tests are not included then she would,
clearly, require more than 10 grace marks inasmuch as she achieved only
25.7% in Physics and 28.6% in Chemistry and she would not be able to qualify
even if the 10 grace marks are given.

15.

Let me now consider the case of the petitioner where the weekly

tests are also taken into consideration. In the case of Physics, the petitioner
would have obtained 58 marks (13+23+9+13) out of a total of 190 marks (25+
70+25+70). Similarly, in Chemistry, taking into account the weekly tests also,
the petitioner would have obtained 56.5 marks (9+28+7.5+12) out of the said
total of 190 marks. To attain 33% out of a maximum of 190 marks, the
petitioner is required to achieve 63 marks. Therefore, in the case of Physics,
she would require 5 grace marks (63-58 = 5). This would leave her with a
balance of 5 grace marks from the 10 that she is entitled to. In Chemistry, she
would have obtained 56.5 or 57 marks out of 190. She would require six grace
marks to achieve 33% (63-57 = 6). But only 5 grace marks are available to her.
Therefore, even if the 10 grace marks are given to the petitioner as per the said

WP(C)2335/2007

Page No.10 of 11

instructions, she would still fall short of the 33% marks in the Chemistry theory
examinations.

16.

This being the position, the petitioner cannot be declared to have

qualified for promotion from class XI to class XII.

Accordingly, this writ

petition is dismissed. No costs.
