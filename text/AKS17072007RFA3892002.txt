A.K. SIKRI, J. (Oral)
1. The appellant was the plaintiff in the proceedings instituted
by it vide suit No. 638/1993 wherein it claimed a decree of
Rs.2,45,000/- against the defendants/respondents herein. It
comprised the principal amount of Rs.1,69,860.40ps for the
goods supplied to the defendants and also Rs.75,160/- on
account of interest on that amount for delayed period.

2. As per the averments made in the plaint, the appellant is a
registered

partnership

firm

dealing

in

papers.

The

defendant/respondent used to purchase material from the
appellant between 9.10.1997 and 14.5.1998 and certain
amounts were paid by the defendant which were credited
leaving a balance of Rs.1,69,860.40ps. The defendant had
also issued a cheque dated 28.2.1998 for Rs.35,000/- which
had been dishonoured.

3. The respondent had filed the written statement as per which
supply of the goods were not disputed. Even the amount for
which these goods were supplied was not disputed.

They

had also admitted part payment as well as issuance of
cheque

of

Rs.35,000/-

which

had

been

dishonoured.

However, the defence of the respondent was that certain
defective

goods

were

returned

to

the

appellant

and

therefore, they were not liable to make payment of those
defective goods which had been returned. In this manner
they even preferred counter claim but did not pay any court
fee thereon.

4. On the basis of these pleadings, five issues were made
RFA No.389/2002

Page 2 of 7

which are as under:-

1. Whether the goods purchased vide bill No.
371 dt. 21.1.1988 were returned by the
draft to the plaintiff? If so, to what effect?
2. Whether the defendant is liable to pay
court fees on the counter claim set up in
Para No.5 of the WS?
3. Whether the claim of the defendant is
within time?
4. To what amount the plaintiff is entitled to
claim?
5. Relief.
5. In so far as issues No. 2 and 3 are concerned, the defendant
counsel conceded that the claim of the appellant herein was
not time barred. He also stated that since court fee was not
paid, the defendant was withdrawing the counter claim. On
the basis of this statement of the defendant's counsel given
on 26.10.1995, two issues were disposed of and decided in
favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.

6. Evidence was led on the other issues and thereafter,
arguments were heard. Vide impugned judgment the trial
court decided Issue No. 1 in favour of the appellant herein
holding that the goods were purchased by the defendant
RFA No.389/2002

Page 3 of 7

vide bill No. 21.1.1998.
7. However, while deciding the Issue No.4 the Court took up
the question as to whether the appellant firm was a
registered partnership or not and held that for want of proof
regarding registration the plaintiff was not entitled to
institute the suit, and therefore, not entitled to recover any
amount as well and decided Issue No.4 against the
appellant.

Consequentially, the suit was dismissed vide

judgment dated 20.1.2002 against which present appeal is
preferred.

8. Notice in this appeal was issued, however, nobody appeared
on behalf of the respondent, and therefore, the respondent
was proceeded exparte. We have heard learned counsel for
the appellant and have perused the record.

9. In the plaint, the plaintiff' has specifically averred that it is a
registered partnership firm. There is no denial of this by the
defendant. Even no issue was framed on this aspect as is
clear

from

the

five

issues

which

were

framed

and

reproduced above.

RFA No.389/2002

10.

Under issue No.4, the learned ADJ was to decide as to

what amount the plaintiff was entitled to. While considering
this issue, the court below took up the issue as to whether
the plaintiff was registered partnership firm or not and held
that since there was nothing on record to show that it was a
registered firm and the finding was given that it was not
entitled to file the suit. In the absence of pleading on this
aspect and when no issue was even framed, the Court could
not have dealt with this aspect. Even if the trial court was of
the opinion that it was necessary for the appellant to show
that it was a registered firm, it should have put the plaintiff
to notice and given an opportunity to prove the same.

11.

As mentioned above, the appellant had specifically

stated that it was a registered firm which was not denied by
the respondent in the written statement. The respondent,
therefore, did not dispute that the appellant was not a
registered firm and, therefore, no such issue was framed.

12.

There is another significant development thereafter.

After framing the issues, the defendants had filed an
application for framing an additional issue under Order 14
RFA No.389/2002

Page 5 of 7

Rule 5.

However this application was dismissed by the

learned trial court vide order dated 5.2.2007 observing as
under:-

13.

“In view of the contents of Para 1 in the
W.S. There is no denial and simple denial or
general denial does not constituted any
denial in that regard and on the other hand
a simple or general denial amounts to
admission u/o 8 Rule 5 CPC which provides
that every allegation of facts the plain, if
not denied specifically or by necessary
implication or stated to be not admitted in
the pleadings of the defendant shall be
taken to be admitted except as against a
person under disability. Therefore there is
no denial and on the other hand this is
admission of the part of the facts alleged in
plaint in para No.1 in the absence of any
denial in that regard and once the deft.
Had recorded his admission in that regard
u/o 8 Rule 5 CPC no issue was raised and
framed in that regard and accordingly the
appl. filed by the deft. at a such belated
stage is absolutely with no merit or
substance and on the other hand is nothing
devide
to
delay
the
proceedings
unnecessarily so that same is dismissed
with costs Rs.1,000/-”
After refusing to frame issues at the instance of the

defendant on the ground that general denial on the part of
the defendant amounted to admission, the same Judge
within 15 days thereafter, while deciding the case finally,
took somersault and took contrary view on the ground that
the appellant had not led any evidence and dismissed the

RFA No.389/2002

Page 6 of 7

suit of the appellant even when he had refused to frame an
issue on this aspect.

Such a conclusion recorded by the

learned Court below is not only contrary to its own order
dated 5.2.2007, it is even other wise unsustainable in law.
The impugned judgment is accordingly set aside and this
appeal is allowed. The case is remanded back to the learned
trial court to decide Issue No.4 on merits.

14.

Trial court record be sent back.
No costs.
