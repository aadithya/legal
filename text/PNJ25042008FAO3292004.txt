PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

Heard learned counsel for the parties.

2.

The substantial questions of law which arise for

consideration in the instant appeal are three fold. Firstly, whether
without examining the doctor who issued the medical certificate
relied upon by the Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation,
could contents thereof be used in favour of the workman?
Secondly, whether the Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation
has drawn correct conclusions from the medical certificate relied

FAO No.329/04

page 1 of 11

upon by the workman? Lastly whether while computing the loss
of wages, the Commissioner Workmen's Compensation was
bound to take into consideration that being in service of the
appellant the workman served with full wages till he retired?
3.

Before proceeding ahead it may be noted that the

disability certificate in question has not been formally exhibited
as a document. It exists at page 24 of the record of the learned
Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation.
4.

Being a first appeal it would not be out of place to

record that it would be impermissible for this Court to reappreciate evidence and set aside a conclusion of fact arrived at
by the Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation merely because
another view is possible on the same evidence. Further, if it is
found

taken for the reason a Court or a Tribunal of original jurisdiction
where omits to consider a piece of relevant evidence or fails to
note a material circumstance while appraising evidence, it acts in
violation of the jurisdiction vested in it and such a decision would
be required to be corrected.
5.

The facts necessary to be noted are that the Workman,

Mahender
FAO No.329/04

Singh,

laid

a

claim

before

the

Commissioner,
page 2 of 11

Workmen's Compensation alleging that while on duty at the night
shift in the intervening night of 5th June, 1995 and 6th June, 1995
his left leg got stuck in mud which got soggy due to heavy rains.
He stated that as a result thereof he suffered injury in the left leg
which permanently disabled him.

He stated that he was

employed as a watchman. To prove the injury and the extent of
disability he produced no document when he filed the claim
petition before the Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation.
The Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation directed him to
report

at

a

Government

hospital

and

obtain

a

disability

certificate. The workman claims that he reported to the doctors
at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narain Hospital who gave him the
medical certificate dated 5.10.1999 certifying as under:“This is to certify that patient Sh. Mahender Age
45 years S/o Shamsher vide OPD No.42942 whose
specimen signature is given below is suffering from
Paraparesis (both lower limbs). His disability is
more
than
forty
(in
Percentage
%)
(Permanent/Temp.).
It
is
therefore
recommended/advised that he/she may be given
all benefits as per the govt. rules.'
6.

The medical certificate, the circumstances under which

it was obtained and a slip issued by the X-Ray department of Lok
Nayak Jai Prakash Narain Hospital became a bone of controversy
before the Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation.

The slip

issued by the X-Ray Department, proved as Ex.A-1, records that

FAO No.329/04

page 3 of 11

the date of issue thereof as 24.9.1990. At the rear of the slip, the
date noted is 25.9. followed by the year not written with clarity.
The year has been recorded in a manner where the numeral 1990
can also be read as 1999.
7.

The stand of the management was that the workman

had a disability of the left leg since long, in fact since the date of
his employment, and the same was being misused to allege that
it had been incurred during employment.
8.

To bring home the point, the management urged that

the slip Ex.A-1 issued by the X-Ray department of Lok Nayak Jai
Prakash Narain Hospital evidenced that the left leg of the
workman was X-rayed on 24.9.1990.
9.

The workman urged that it was a case of erroneous

recording of a date.

The workman alleged that the date

24.9.1990 was in fact 24.9.1999.
10.

The Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation has held

in favour of the workman, recording that since the workman had
gone to the hospital as directed by the Commissioner, Workmen's
Compensation and in respect whereof a referral letter was issued
by the Commissioner, Workmen Compensation on 24.8.1999, the
date on the X-Ray slip Ex.A-1 had to be 24.9.1999.
11.

With

reference

to

the

disability

certificate,

the

Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation has noted that the
FAO No.329/04

page 4 of 11

same records more than 40% disability and on this basis
compensation has been assessed holding that the evidence
establishes that the workman suffered the injury while on duty.
12.

Pertaining to the first two questions of law (noted in

para 2 above), it is urged by learned counsel for the appellant
that the Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation has completely
misread Ex.A-1.

Two fold submissions have been urged in

relation thereto. It is firstly urged that the date of the document
is clearly recorded as 24.9.1990 on the front side of the slip. That
the date at the rear recorded as 25.9.1990 cannot be read as
25.9.1999. It is urged that the same has to be considered in light
of the date recorded on the front of the slip.

The second

submission made is that assuming the X-Ray slip is dated
24.9.1999, the contents thereof have been ignored for the reason
the slip records that X-Ray of the left leg is being taken with
reference to an old injury.

Elaborating on this aspect, learned

counsel for the appellant draws attention of this Court to the
cross-examination of the workman wherein, in cross-examination,
the workman admitted that he went to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash
Narain hospital on 24.9.1990.
13.

Per contra, learned counsel for the workman urges

that the hiatus in the dates recorded on Ex.A-1, on the front and
the rear, cannot be resolved as urged by learned counsel for the
FAO No.329/04

page 5 of 11

appellant.

Counsel urges that the circumstances under which

appellant went to the hospital to obtain the certificate, and as
noted by the Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation, have to
be kept in mind.

Counsel urges that evidence has to be

probablized with reference to the circumstances under which the
workman was constrained to go to the hospital and obtain a
medical certificate.

With respect to the testimony of the

workman in cross examination, counsel urged that once again the
date 24.9.1999 has been wrongly noted in the testimony as
24.9.1990.
14.

A perusal of Ex.A-1 shows that on the front side of the

document the date 24.9.1990 is written with clarity. At the rear,
the date can be read as 25.9.1990 as well as 25.9.1999.
15.

To err is to human.

Unfortunately, since no witness

was examined from Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narain Hospital with
reference to the record maintained by the hospital, it would be
difficult to opine conclusively one way or the other if I probablize
the date of the X-ray slip Ex.A-1 as per the rival versions noted
above. However, there are circumstances to hold in favour of the
workman. The same is the age of the workman recorded on Ex.A1. It records the age as 45 years.
16.

In the year 1990 the workman was not aged 45 years.

This was his age in the year 1999. I thus hold that the evidence
FAO No.329/04

page 6 of 11

probablizes that the X-ray slip Ex.A-1 was issued on 24.9.1999.
The

conclusion

drawn

by

the

Commissioner,

Workmen's

Commissioner,

Workmen's

Compensation is therefore correct.
17.

However,

whether

the

Compensation has drawn the correct conclusions from the
documents is the question which needs to be answered further.
18.

As noted hereinabove, the X-Ray slip further records

that the injury was old. How old? Nothing has been recorded.
19.

As noted above, the workman suffered the injury on

the intervening night of 5th and 6th June, 1995. Thus as of 1999
one could well record that the injury was old. Nothing therefore
turns on the noting at the rear of Ex.A-1 that it pertains to an old
injury.
20.

The disability certificate records and certifies as

under:“This is to certify that patient Sh. Mahender Age
45 years S/o Shamsher vide OPD No.42942 whose
specimen signature is given below is suffering from
Paraparesis (both lower limbs). His disability is
more
than
forty
(in
Percentage
%)
(Permanent/Temp.).
It
is
therefore
recommended/advised that he/she may be given
all benefits as per the govt. rules.'
21.

From the language of the certificate the Commissioner

Workmen's Compensation has concluded that the workman
suffered a disability due to the injury sustained by him while on

FAO No.329/04

page 7 of 11

duty.
22.

Learned counsel for the appellant has shown medical

jurisprudence to this Court to the effect that paraparesis is a
condition caused by a virus that results in immune dysfunction.
23.

It is urged by learned counsel for the appellant that

the Commissioner Workmen's Compensation has ignored material
circumstances, namely the language of the disability certificate
and has ignored medical jurisprudence, for the reason the
certified disability as per medical jurisprudence is caused by virus
and is a result of immune dysfunction. Counsel urges that the
finding pertaining to the disability attributable to the injury
sustained during employment is thus vitiated.
24.

It

appears

to

be

a

case,

where

before

the

Commissioner Workmen's Compensation this aspect of the
matter was not highlighted and hence not considered.
25.

As held by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High

Court in the decision reported as 1983 Lab. I.C. 1285 Bengal Coal
Co.Ltd. Girimint Vs. Sew Pujan Harijan the contents of a disability
certificate require to be proved by a doctor in relation to his
opinion.

I may add, that as in the instant case, the cross-

examination of the doctor may become necessary to elicit
whether injury was on account of a virus which resulted in
immune dysfunction or was solely attributable to the fracture of a
FAO No.329/04

page 8 of 11

bone of the left leg. I may highlight at this stage that the medical
certificate records dysfunction of both lower limbs. It is not the
case of the workman that while on duty he suffered injury of both
lower limbs.
26.

The matter needs further evidence.

27.

I

note

that

the

Commissioner

Workmen's

Compensation has not dealt with the defence that the workman
suffered no loss of wages on account of the disablement
inasmuch as he was retained in employment on full wages. As
per Section 4(1)(c) of the Workmen's Compensation Act while
computing compensation the impact of the disablement on the
earning capacity has to be considered and as per Explanation-II
to said section while assessing the loss of earning capacity for the
purposes of computing compensation payable due regard has to
be given to the percentage loss of earning capacity in relation to
the different injuries specified in Schedule-I to the Act. Thus, it
was obligatory on the Commissioner Workmen's Compensation to
further consider the matter and deal with the plea of the
employer that the workman suffered no pecuniary loss due to the
injury for the reason he was retained in employment with full
wages.
28.
the

The appeal accordingly stands disposed of quashing
impugned

FAO No.329/04

order

dated

23.8.2004

passed

by

the

page 9 of 11

Commissioner Workmen's Compensation. The claim petition filed
by the workman is restored. The Commissioner Workmen's
Compensation would examine the doctor who has issued the
medical certificate. The opinion of the doctor would be elicited
with respect to the cause of the physical handicap suffered by the
workman.

Fresh decision would be taken on the injury with

reference to the said evidence.

The Commissioner Workmen's

Compensation would also deal with the defence that the
workman suffered no loss of wages due to the disablement
suffered by him.
29.

Before concluding I may note that the issue of

Mahender Singh being a workman under the appellant and his
being on duty on the intervening night of 5th June 1995 and 6th
June 1995 and his being injured while on duty would not be redecided as said findings have not been set aside by me. It would
be treated that the workman was no duty on the night of 5th June
1995 and 6th June 1995 and suffered the injury as claimed by him.
30.

Commissioner Workmen's Compensation would re-

decide the issue within 4 months of date of receipt of the present
order.
