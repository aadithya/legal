1.

Vide the present petition under Section 482 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure the petitioners seek quashing of the
complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act filed by the
respondent

no.2

Citibank

and

compensation

from

the

respondent no.2 for having filed the complaint with the sole
motive of causing harassment to the petitioners. However at
the

hearing

held

on

03.04.07

learned

counsel

for

the

petitioners restricted claim only to the compensation claimed
Page 1 of 7

on account of the harassment of the petitioners by the
complainant bank.
2.

Facts necessary to dispose of the present petition

are that the complainant is a banking institution having its
branches all over the country. The branch of the complainant
situated at Mumbai gave a loan to Ms.Namita Ganwani,
petitioner no.1 and her husband Suresh Ganwani, petitioner
no.2. Both the petitioners are the residents of Mumbai.
3.

Petitioner no.1 issued 12 post-dated cheques in

favour of the complainant bank towards part discharge of the
afore-said loan.
4.

The cheques when presented for encashment were

returned unpaid by the banker of the petitioners.
5.

Statutory notice of demand as contemplated under

Section 138 of the NI Act was got served by the complainant
bank upon the petitioner no.1 as also petitioner no.2 who was a
co-borrower. It is to be noted that said notice was sent at the
residential address of the petitioners and was addressed to
both the petitioners.
6.

When the petitioners failed to make payment of the

amount covered by the dishonoured cheques inspite of service
of statutory notice, 5 complaints under Section 138 of the NI
Act were filed by the complainant bank. In respect of 8
Page 2 of 7

dishonoured cheques, 3 complaints were filed in the courts at
Mumbai and for 4 remaining cheques, 2 complaints were filed
in the courts at Delhi.
7.

The present petition relates to the complaint bearing

no.900/1 titled as 'Citibank v Namita Ganwani' filed in respect
of two cheques bearing nos.286314 and 286315 and dated
1.12.02 and 1.1.03 respectively. Both the cheques were issued
for an amount of Rs.17,499/- and drawn on the Bank of
Maharashtra.

learned

Metropolitan

Magistrate

summoned the petitioners to face trial for an offence under
Section 138 of the NI Act.
9.

During the course of trial of the present complaint

petitioner no.2 filed an application for discharge on the ground
that is not the drawer of the cheques in question.
10.

A perusal of the record of the court of the learned

Metropolitan Magistrate shows that on 29.10.04 the counsel for
the complainant bank stated before the court that the
proceedings be dropped against the petitioner no.2.

12.

Learned

counsel

for

the

petitioners

seek

compensation on following 2 counts:I.

That the petitioner no.2 who was not the drawer of

the cheques in question was impleaded as an accused in the
present complaint. That this caused great inconvenience to
petitioner no.2 as on every date of hearing he used to travel
from Mumbai to Delhi.
II.

That the complainant bank was not justified in filing

the present complaint in the court at Delhi for the reason that
the whole transaction relating to the loan took place in Mumbai,
petitioner no.1 handed over the cheques in question to the
complainant bank in Mumbai and three complaints relating to
dishonour of other cheques forming part of same transaction
had already been filed in Mumbai.
13.

In support of the petition, learned counsel for the

petitioners had undertaken to supply to the court judgments
and literature relating to the rights of the consumer. However,
he did not supply the same.
14.

Learned counsel for the complainant bank justified

the filing of the present complaint in the court at Delhi by
contending that the legal department of the complainant bank
is situated in Delhi and that the statutory notice of demand for
Page 4 of 7

payment of amount of dishonoured cheques was sent to the
petitioners by the complainant bank from Delhi. That in view of
law laid down by the Supreme Court in the decision reported as
K.Bhaskaran v Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan & Anr (1999)7 SCC
510 the court in Delhi has the territorial jurisdiction to try the
present complaint.
15.

Relevant portion of the decision of the Supreme

Court in Bhaskaran's case which is heavily relied upon by the
counsel for the respondent reads as under:“15. The offence under Section 138 of the Act
can be completed only with the concatenation
of a number of acts. Following are the acts
which are components of the said offence : (1)
Drawing of the cheque, (2) Presentation of the
cheque to the bank, (3) Returning the cheque
unpaid by the drawee bank, (4) Giving notice
in writing to the drawer of the cheque
demanding payment of the cheque amount,
(5) failure of the drawer to make payment
within 15 days of the receipt of the notice.
16. It is not necessary that all the above five
acts should have been perpetrated at the
same locality. It is possible that each of those
five acts could be done at 5 different localities.
But concatenation of all the above five is a
sine qua non for the completion of the offence
under Section 138 of the Code. In this context
a reference to Section 178(d) of the Code is
useful. It is extracted below:
“178. (a)-(c)
(d) Where the offence consists of several
acts done in different local areas, it may be
inquired into or tried by a Court having
jurisdiction over any of such local areas.”
Page 5 of 7

17. Thus it is clear, if the five different acts
were done in five different localities any one of
the courts exercising jurisdiction in one of the
five local areas can become the place of trial
for the offence under Section 138 of the Act. In
other words, the complainant can choose any
one of those courts having jurisdiction over
any one of the local areas within the territorial
limits of which any one of those five acts was
done. As the amplitude stands so widened and
so expansive it is an idle exercise to raise
jurisdictional question regarding the offence
under Section 138 of the Act.”
16.

Thus clearly in view of law laid down by the Supreme

Court in Bhaskaran's case, the courts at 5 different locations
have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain a complaint under
Section 138 of the NI Act. But the practice of filing the
complaint at courts situated in different locations in respect of
cheques

forming

part

of

same

transaction

has

to

be

deprecated.
17.

In the instant case, it is noteworthy that all 12

cheques

issued

by

the

petitioner

no.1

were

returned

dishonoured. The said dishonour must have caused great
inconvenience to the complainant bank. In the light of the fact
that the conduct of the petitioners also caused inconvenience
to the complainant bank, petitioners are not entitled in equity
to be recompensed for the inconvenience caused to them by
the complainant bank.

The petition is devoid of any merits and is dismissed.

No costs.
