MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
The Revenue is aggrieved by an order dated 8th September,
2006 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench „G‟ in

ITA No.903/2007

Page 1 of 6

IT(SS) No. 107/Del/2003 relevant for the block period from 1st April,
1989 to 20th February, 2000.
2.

Briefly the facts of the case are that a search was conducted

at the residence of the Appellant on 10th February, 2000. During the
course of search, two Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) dated
1st March, 1999 were recovered.

These MOUs were entered into

between the Assessee, Ravi Talwar and Madhu Talwar. In terms of the
MOUs, the Assessee had paid Rs.25 lakhs each to Ravi Talwar and
Madhu Talwar towards part consideration for the purchase of
agricultural land valued at Rs.123.30 lakhs. The balance amount was to
be paid on or before 30th April, 1999, failing which the amount of Rs.25
lakhs each would be forfeited.
3.

On the basis of the MOUs, the Assessing Officer issued a

questionnaire to Ravi Talwar and Madhu Talwar regarding receipt of
the amount of Rs.25 lakhs each but while they both admitted having
signed the MOUs, they denied having received any amount.

The

Assessing Officer concluded that the denials by the Assessee of having
made payments and of Ravi Talwar and Madhu Talwar of having
received the amounts was only to escape payment of tax liabilities.
Accordingly, an amount of Rs.50 lakhs was added in the hands of the
Assessee under Section 69 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short the
Act) as unexplained expenditure.
4.

The view taken by the Assessing Officer was not accepted

by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and also by the

ITA No.903/2007

Page 2 of 6

Tribunal.

Both concurrently were of the view that there was not

enough evidence to add the amount in the hands of the Assessee.
5.

The Commissioner was of the view that all the parties had

denied the transaction and in fact the property in question was
eventually sold by Ravi Talwar and Madhu Talwar to M/s. Delhi Tent
and Decorators Pvt. Ltd. whose Director gave a statement on 4th
February, 2002 to the effect that he had purchased the agricultural land
in question from Ravi Talwar and Madhu Talwar. It was also held that
in view of the denial of receipt of any money by Ravi Talwar and
Madhu Talwar, there ought to have been some independent
corroboration of the payment but there was no such material
forthcoming.
6.

In so far as the Tribunal is concerned, it was of the view that

under the provisions of Section 132(4A) of the Act, there was a
presumption about the correctness of the contents of the MOUs but
relying upon the decision of the Karnataka High Court in
Commissioner of Income Tax vs. P.R. Metrani (HUF), [2001] 251 ITR
244, it was held that the presumption was rebuttable. It was further
held that the Assessee had been able to successfully rebut the
presumption.
7.

Learned counsel for the Revenue reiterated the view

expressed by the Assessing Officer.

Unfortunately, we are not in

agreement with that view.
8.

The facts of the case make it very clear that there were two

ITA No.903/2007

Page 3 of 6

MOUs entered into by the Assessee with Ravi Talwar and Madhu
Talwar in respect of the purchase of agricultural land. The two MOUs
did record that “the purchase consideration shall be Rs.123.30 lacs. The
purchaser having paid to the vendor the sum of Rs.25,00,000 part of the
said purchase consideration as a deposit and shall pay the residual of
said purchase consideration to the vendor on or before 30th April, 1999
when the purchase will be completed.”
9.

Notwithstanding this, the Assessee as well as Ravi Talwar

and Madhu Talwar denied the money transaction. In addition thereto,
the case set up was that the agricultural land had, in fact, been sold to
M/s. Delhi Tent and Decorators Pvt. Ltd. by Ravi Talwar and Madhu
Talwar. This was confirmed by Shri N.K. Mittal, one of the Directors of
M/s. Delhi Tent and Decorators Pvt. Ltd. Quite clearly, the MOUs did
not fructify.
10.

Section 132(4A) of the Act uses the expression “it may be

presumed”. It is not obligatory on the assessing authority to make a
presumption. Even if a presumption is required to be made, then, as
held in Commissioner of Income Tax v. S.M.S. Investment Corporation
P. Ltd., [1994] 207 ITR 364, the presumption is a rebuttable one and
relates to a question of fact. While coming to this conclusion, the
Rajasthan High Court relied upon an earlier decision rendered by it in
Commissioner of Income Tax v. S.M.S. Investment Corporation, [1988]
173 ITR 393.
11.

Even in Income Tax Officer, B-Ward, Ernakulam v. T. Abdul

ITA No.903/2007

Page 4 of 6

Majeed, [1988] 169 ITR 440, it has been held as follows: “It is true that section 132(4A) of the Act enables the court
to presume the truth of the contents of such books.
However, it is a presumption which can be rebutted.
Moreover, the presumption envisaged therein is only a
factual presumption. It is in the discretion of the court,
depending upon other factors, to decide whether the
presumption must be drawn. The expression used in the
sub-section is “may be presumed” as is used in section 114
of the Evidence Act, 1872. It is not a mandate that
whenever the books of account are seized, the court shall
necessarily draw the presumption, irrespective of any
other factors which may dissuade the court from doing
so.”
12.

In so far as the present case is concerned, the Assessee had

stated that in fact there was no transfer of money between him and
Ravi Talwar and Madhu Talwar. On the other hand, Ravi Talwar and
Madhu Talwar had denied receipt of any money from the Assessee. In
the fact of these denials, there ought to have been corroborative
evidence to show that there was in fact such a transfer of money. Both
the Commissioner as well as the Tribunal have come to the conclusion
that there was no such material on record.
13.

The Assessing Officer relied on certain other transactions

entered into by the Assessee with Ravi Talwar and Madhu Talwar for
drawing a presumption in respect of the transfer of money, but the
Tribunal rightly held that those were independent transactions and
had nothing to do with the MOUs, which were the subject matter of
discussion.

Even if there was something wrong with some other

transactions entered into, that would not give rise to an adverse
inference in so far as the subject MOUs are concerned.
