JUDGMENT
P.K.BHASIN, J:
This petition has been filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 seeking quashing of the FIR no. 153/2004 registered
against

him

for

the

offences

under

Sections

403/406/409/418/420/448/380/120B of Indian Penal Code (‘I.P.C.’ in short) at
Police Station Krishna Nagar on 04.04.2004 pursuant to the order passed by the
Metropolitan Magistrate under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. in the criminal complaint
filed by respondents no. 2 & 3 herein.
2.

Facts leading to the controversy are that an agreement to sell was entered

into by respondents no. 2 & 3 in respect of their one shop in Krishna Nagar through
a property dealer with the petitioner for a total consideration of Rs. 3,00,000/- out
of which sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- was paid by the petitioner herein and the balance
amount was to be paid at the time of execution of the sale deed. After the
execution of the agreement to sell some disputes arose between the parties which
led to the filing of a suit for permanent injunction by the petitioner against
respondents no. 2 & 3 and a criminal complaint in the court of Metropolitan
Magistrate by respondents no. 2 & 3. Metropolitan Magistrate directed the police
to register an FIR against the petitioner and the same was registered as noticed
above. A suit for possession and mesne profits was also filed by the respondents
no. 2 & 3 against the petitioner in respect of their shop on the allegation that he
had entered into that shop illegally. That suit was decreed in favour of respondents
no. 2 & 3 against which the petitioner preferred an appeal. In the course of said
civil proceedings, the parties arrived at an amicable settlement on the basis of
which a compromise decree was passed. It is stated in the petition that in
compliance with the terms of settlement the petitioner has handed over the

peaceful and vacant possession of the shop to respondents no. 2 & 3.
4.

After having resolved their disputes the petitioner filed this petition under

Section 482 Cr.P.C. Notice of the petition was given to the State as well as
respondents no.2 & 3. On 24.10.2007, the complainants (respondents no. 2 & 3)
appeared in person in Court and affirmed that the disputes between them and the
petitioner had been compromised and so they were no more interested in pursuing
their complaint against the petitioner and also that they had no objection for
quashing of the FIR.
5.

Learned APP for the State, however, opposed quashing of the FIR on the

ground that the offences invoked against the petitioner are serious in nature and
non-compoundable also as per the provisions of Section 320 Cr.P.C. and allowing
the compounding of these offences would tantamount to bye-passing the
provisions of Section 320 of Cr.P.C.
6.

I have considered the submissions made by counsel for the petitioner as well

as the APP. It is now well settled that FIRs for the offences which are not
compoundable can also be quashed if it is felt by the Court while dealing with a
petition under section 482 Cr.P.C. that it would secure the ends of justice if the FIR
and criminal proceedings arising therefrom are quashed and continuation of the
investigation/criminal proceedings would amount to abuse of the process of law.
In the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in “B.S.Joshi & Ors. Vs. State of Haryana
& Anr.”, AIR 2003 SC 1386, relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner it

has been so held. Since both the parties in the present case have settled their
disputes amongst themselves and the civil litigation between them also stands
compromised no fruitful purpose would now be served if the investigation goes on.
In a case reported as (2007 (2) Crimes 329) criminal case for the offences
punishable under Sections 418/409/166 I.P.C. was quashed by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court because of the settlement between the complainant and the
accused despite the fact that offence under Section 409 I.P.C. attracts sentence of
even life imprisonment.
7.

This petition is accordingly allowed and consequently FIR No. 153/2004

registered at Police Station Krishna Nagar for the offences under Sections
403/406/409/418/420/448/380/120B of I.P.C. is hereby quashed.
