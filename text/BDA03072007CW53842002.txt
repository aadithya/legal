BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J (ORAL)
1.
By virtue of an agreement dated 05.09.1977, the petitioner was
appointed by the Northern Railway as an Out Agent for Katra (a town 40 Kms
away from Jammu) in respect of ticketing for outbound trains from Jammu.
Initially, the agency was in respect of only unreserved tickets. Subsequently,
the petitioner was also alloted a quota for reserved tickets. This petition has
been filed by the petitioner being aggrieved by the withdrawal of the quota as
also the cancellation of the petitioner's Out Agency.

The order which is

primarily impugned in the present petition is the order dated 17.05.2002 passed

WP(C)5384/2002

Page No.1 of 9

by the Chief Commercial Manager, Northern Railway, Baroda House, New
Delhi whereby it was decided to terminate the Out Agency allotted to the
petitioner at Katra with immediate effect.

2.

The petitioner has also prayed for the quashing of a letter dated

14.12.2001 as well as the orders dated 18.09.2001 and 21.12.2001. It has also
been prayed that an order in the nature of mandamus be issued to the
respondents to restore status quo ante as on 18.09.2001 by restoring the entire
reservation quota of seats allotted to the petitioner. Although these directions
have been sought, the main grievance of the petitioner is clearly with regard to
the order dated 17.05.2002 whereby the petitioner's Out Agency was
terminated. Unless that order is set aside, the question of restoration of the
reservation quota would not arise. The said letter dated 14.12.2001 which is
also impugned by the petitioner is nothing but a show cause notice with regard
to the termination of the agency. The order dated 18.09.2001, referred to
above, is with regard to the reduction of quota in respect of the Katra Out
Agency. By virtue of the said order, the reservation quota, which was earlier
granted to the petitioner, was reduced in respect of different trains. The order
dated 21.12.2001, which is also impugned by the petitioner, is an order whereby
the entire reservation quota allotted to the petitioner's Out Agency at Katra was
withdrawn with immediate effect. It is pertinent to note that being aggrieved by
the reduction in quota and subsequent withdrawal of the quota, the petitioner
WP(C)5384/2002

Page No.2 of 9

had filed a writ petition before this court being CW 378/2002. However,
during the pendency of that writ petition, the show cause notice dated
14.12.2001 which pertains to termination of the Out Agency had been replied to
by the petitioner on 26.12.2001. A personal hearing was also granted to the
petitioner on 10.05.2002 and the impugned order dated 17.05.2002 whereby the
petitioner's Out Agency was terminated came to be passed. Because of these
events, the petitioner sought withdrawal of the writ petition (CW 378/2002) so
as to challenge the main order dated 17.05.2002, whereby the petitioner's Out
Agency itself had been terminated. By an order dated 02.08.2002, this court
permitted the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition (CW 378/2002) with
liberty to the petitioner to file a fresh writ petition so as to also include a
challenge to the order dated 17.05.2002. It is in these circumstances that the
present writ petition has been filed.

3.

From the above facts, it is obvious that unless and until the order

dated 17.05.2002 is set aside, the petitioner cannot get any relief with respect to
the withdrawal of the reservation quota. The reservation quota is dependent
upon the existence of the petitioner's out agency. Therefore, the main challenge
in this petition is to the order dated 17.05.2002.

4.

By virtue of the show cause notice dated 14.12.2001, referred to

above, the petitioner was notified that a check had been conducted by the CBI
WP(C)5384/2002

Page No.3 of 9

on 15.06.2000 at the petitioner's agency at Katra. The allegation was that the
petitioner was indulging in corrupt practices. According to the raid conducted
by the CBI, the petitioner could not produce the requisition slips in respect of
the 152 confirmed tickets which had been processed by the petitioner in respect
of travel by various persons on 15.06.2000. According to Mr Grover, the
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, the reservation requisition
for travel on any date could be made within two months preceding the date of
travel. Since the date of travel in the present case with which we are concerned
was 15.06.2000, requisitions for reservation could have been made by persons
intending to travel on this date at any time between 15.04.2000 and 15.06.2000.
It was submitted by Mr Grover that as the culling of records for this entire
period was taking time, the petitioner was unable to produce all the requisition
slips in respect of the 152 tickets. According to him, the CBI had informed the
petitioner that the same may be produced later and that the petitioner did
produce the same later on 15.09.2000. He also submitted that the CBI itself did
not pursue the matter any further after giving its report and no criminal
proceedings were taken against the petitioner. It may be pointed out, at this
juncture itself, that with regard to the production of the requisition slips on a
subsequent date, the CBI report carries the following note:“Evidence is available that Shri Harcharan Singh, Manager of
Out Agency of Railway, Katra S-3 did not produce the
requisition slips at the time CBI check on 15.6.2000 for
tickets booked for 15.6.2000 from Out Agency of Railway,

WP(C)5384/2002

Page No.4 of 9

Katra but he produced the requisition slips during the enquiry
which are after thought prepared documents by the suspect.”
The final recommendations of the CBI report also include that the licence of the
petitioner's agency ought to be cancelled.

5.

Mr Grover also submitted that a summary sheet / reservation chart

of Katra Out Agency for 15.06.2000 was sent on 14.05.2000. However, the
learned counsel for the respondents contended that this summary sheet is
entirely different from the requisition slips. Mr Grover also submitted that on
17.06.2000, Railway Inspection was carried out and nothing detrimental was
found on that date.

He submitted that subsequent to this incident, the

petitioner's agency was, in fact, renewed on 19.09.2000.

6.

Ms Anjana Gosain, who appeared on behalf of the respondents,

submitted that the agency itself had been terminated by the order dated
17.05.2002. This was based on the findings of the CBI raid. The conduct of
the petitioner in not producing the relevant requisition slips was, according to
her, in clear violation of clause 14.2 of the Agency Agreement read with clause
10.1. She submitted that although the impugned order refers to past conduct of
the petitioner, this was not the basis on which the order was passed. Reference
to the past conduct of the petitioner was only made because the petitioner in his
reply to the show cause notice had stated that in the past, there was no

WP(C)5384/2002

Page No.5 of 9

complaint. These references were only to put the record straight. She also
submitted that the CBI raid had nothing to do with the withdrawal of quota and
that was done due to administrative reasons and was part of the policy of
computerisation. She submitted that the CBI had submitted its report, referred
to above. In the said report, there was a discussion of the evidence and also a
recommendation for cancellation of the petitioner's licence.

However, the

respondents did not cancel the licence merely on the recommendation of the
CBI, but followed the principles of natural justice by first issuing the show
cause notice dated 14.12.2001 to the petitioner. The petitioner replied to the
same on 26.12.2001.

Thereafter, a personal hearing was also granted on

10.05.2002 and it is only then that the impugned order dated 17.05.2002 was
passed after giving due reasons therefor.

7.

In rejoinder, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that

the alleged breaches under clause 14.2 of the Agency Agreement were not
made out. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the Railway
Administration itself had found the petitioner's books in order and, therefore,
clause 14.2 could not have been invoked. He also submitted that the reference
to clause 10.2 of the Agreement which related to failure of providing services
could also not be invoked. He submitted that if there were any deficiencies,
then it was for the Railway authorities to have required the petitioner to remove
those deficiencies, but no such opportunity had been given to the petitioner. It
WP(C)5384/2002

Page No.6 of 9

was also sought to be contended by him that the petitioner was singled out
inasmuch as other agents were also allegedly involved in terms of the CBI
report and no action was taken against them. In this regard, the learned counsel
for the respondents made references of two other travel agents also who were
suspended. Some Railway employees were also suspended.

8.

Considering the arguments advanced by the counsel for the parties,

I am of the view that the arguments qua withdrawal of quota and the arguments
qua termination have to be separated. On behalf of the petitioner, it was
contended that the withdrawal of the quota was bad inasmuch as no opportunity
of hearing was granted. On behalf of the respondents, it was contended that the
withdrawal of the quota was on account of a mere administrative decision taken
by the respondents and was in terms of the contract.

The administrative

decision that was taken was with regard to computerisation at Katra.
According to them, whenever any location is computerised, all manual booking
of quota has to be stopped. This was a purely administrative action and,
therefore, according to the respondents, there was no need for issuing any show
cause notice or granting any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. This view
point is contested by the petitioner. However, in my view, a debate on this
issue is irrelevant for the purposes of the present petition. The main hurdle that
comes in the way of the petitioner is the termination of the agency by virtue of

WP(C)5384/2002

Page No.7 of 9

the order dated 17.05.2002 and unless and until that order is set aside, this
entire debate on the withdrawal of the reservation quota is meaningless.

9.

As regards the impugned order dated 17.05.2002, I note that the

principles of natural justice have been followed. A show cause notice was
issued on 14.12.2001. The petitioner filed a reply on 26.12.2001. A personal
hearing was also granted on 10.05.2002 and it is only subsequent thereto that by
virtue of a reasoned order dated 17.05.2002 the petitioner's Out Agency has
been terminated. In the impugned order itself it is observed that clause 14.2 of
the Agency Agreement had been clearly violated as the petitioner was unable to
produce requisition slips for the reservations done by the petitioner for the date
15.06.2000 and this clearly stood established by the check carried on by the
CBI on 15.06.2000 itself. With regard to the submission that the requisition
slips were available, but could not be sorted out, it was observed in the order
dated 17.05.2002 that while it is factually correct that the requisition slips could
have been scattered in different bunches for a period of two months, it was the
duty of the petitioner to produce all the bunches from 15.04.2000 to 15.05.2000
during the check on 15.06.2000 by the CBI and then it would have been upto
the CBI to sort out the same from these bunches.

The requisition slips

submitted later were found to be an after thought and prepared documents as
per the CBI report.

WP(C)5384/2002

10.

In the impugned order, it is noted that the petitioner had shut down

the agency itself on the withdrawal of the reservation quota without permission
of / intimation to the Railway authorities even though he was bound to sell the
unreserved tickets.

It is in these circumstances that the impugned order

terminating the Out Agency of the petitioner was passed.

11.

At this juncture, it must be reiterated that this court when it

examines an impugned speaking order in exercise of its writ jurisdiction, does
not sit as a court of appeal and is not required to examine the factual issues. It
also does not substitute its views in place of the opinion of the authority which
passed the impugned order. This court is largely concerned with examining as
to whether the order is lawful or not. The principles of natural justice have
been entirely followed in the present case and I see no reason even otherwise to
hold that the impugned order of termination dated 17.05.2002 is not a lawful
order.
Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. No order as to costs.
