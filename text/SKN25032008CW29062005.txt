1. The petitioner was allotted flat no.502, Sector-13, Pocket-A, Phase-II,
Dwarka with block dates 30.7.1999 â€“ 3.8.1999 on hire-purchase basis.
The total disposal cost was Rs.6,99,400/- and the petitioner was
required to pay Rs.3,72,943.12 on or before 2nd September, 1999. The
said deposit was made. The petitioner thereafter also continued to make
payment

on

hire-purchase

installments

and

an

amount

of

Rs.1,35,065.36 was paid by the petitioner on different dates.
2. In spite of these payments, DDA was unable to handover possession of
the flat till May, 2001 because of non-availability of basic civic facilities
in the area. In these circumstances on 24th May, 2001 DDA granted
deferment of monthly installments and interest relief on delayed

payment, for the flats located in Sector-13, Pocket-A, Dwarka upto 31st
May, 2001. The said notification also stipulated that allottees who had
not taken possession letters due to non-availability of services could
collect the same and the date of validity of the possession had been
extended for 90 days w.e.f. May 2001.
3. In these circumstances, I feel that the petitioner is entitled to interest on
the initial deposit of Rs.3,72,943.12 from the date of deposit till 31st May,
2001. Petitioner will be also entitled to interest for hire-purchase
installments paid by him till 31st May, 2001 from the date of payment till
31st May, 2001. DDA will pay interest @12 % per annum. This rate of
interest is being fixed as DDA is charging interest at the rate of 18% per
annum from the allottees including the petitioner.
4. The petitioner had applied for conversion from hire-purchase to cash
down basis on 3.4.2002. The said application should have been
processed within reasonable time of 3 months i.e. by 30th July, 2002.
DDA will accordingly recalculate interest payable on hire-purchase
installments for the period between 31st May, 2001 till 31st July, 2002 on
the basis of their formula/policy and the petitioner will be asked to
deposit balance amount, if any. Interest payable to the petitioner by
DDA will be set off. Petitioner will be also liable to pay interest @ 18%
per annum on the balance amount on cash down basis w.e.f 1st August,

2002. In case the petitioner has made any payment after 1st August,
2002, he will be given benefit of the same and interest will be calculated
on the reducing balance.
The writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
