S.N.AGGARWAL, J (ORAL)
This is unfortunate that a leave to defend application filed by
the defendant in a suit under Order XXXVII CPC is pending for about five
years.
The plaintiff has filed this suit against the defendant for
recovery of Rs.25,21,160.67 with pendente lite and future interest @ 24%
per annum. The suit was filed under Order XXXVII CPC in August 2003.
The plaintiff has stated that the defendant was a wholesale stockist and in
the course of business used to purchase various goods such as Fevicol
brand adhesives, synthetic resins, etc. from the plaintiff. The defendant is

alleged to had given three cheques of total aggregate amount of
Rs.25,21,160.67 to the plaintiff towards price of the goods purchased by
the defendant from the plaintiff. The details of the cheques as given in
para 6 of the plaint, are as follow :-

“Cheque No.

Dated

Amount (in Rs.)
356869

13.2.2003

10,00,000/-

356870

21.2.2003

10,00,000/-

356871

28.2.2003

5,21,120.67”

The further case of the plaintiff is that all the above mentioned
three cheques when presented for encashment, were returned unpaid by
the banker for “insufficient funds”. The present suit had been filed by the
plaintiff for recovery of the amounts of the above mentioned three
cheques.
In response to the summons of the suit, the defendant filed its
leave to defend application which was within limitation.

The leave is

sought by the defendant inter alia on the ground that the three cheques
mentioned above were never issued by the defendant and they are
without consideration.

The defendant has alleged in leave to defend

application that in the course of business dealings the defendant had
given blank cheques duly signed by one of its Directors to the plaintiff
company for being filled up on instructions from time to time.

The

defendant has contended that the blank cheques given by the defendant

to the plaintiff as security were misused by the plaintiff and according to
the defendant it is not liable to pay any amount to the plaintiff company.
The main defence raised by the defendant in the leave to defend
application is that the alleged cheques relied upon by the plaintiff were
blank and were misused by the plaintiff.
Mr. Om Prakash, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
defendant has referred to certain documents at pages 35 to 37 of 1A part
of the file. The reliance on these documents is placed on behalf of the
defendant to substantiate the defence that the cheques in question given
by the defendant to the plaintiff were blank. It would be relevant to refer
to one of these three letters which is at page 35. The said letter is dated
30.05.2002 written by the defendant to the plaintiff and the same reads
as under :“
The Branch Manager,
Parekh Marketing Ltd.,
Rajdhani Enclave, New Delhi

Sd/Director”
The above referred letter written by the defendant to the
plaintiff was prior in point of time to the dates of the cheques in question
on the basis of which the plaintiff has filed the present suit.

It may be

seen from the said letter of the defendant that the defendant did write to
the plaintiff that it had given duly signed blank cheques to the plaintiff.
One of the cheques referred in the letter dated 30-05-2002 at page 35 of
Part 1A file is cheque No.356885 dated 28-05-2002 for Rs.5,09,881.68
paise. All the three cheques on the basis of which the plaintiff has filed
the present suit were allegedly issued by the defendant during the month
of February 2003.

The numbers of these three cheques on which the

plaintiff has sought reliance are 356869, 356870 and 356871.

In case

cheque No.356885 was given by the defendant on 28-05-2002 as referred
in letter at page 35, then how could the cheque which bears earlier serial
number, mentioned in para 6 of the plaint, have been issued by the
defendant in February 2003, i.e., after about nine months of issuance of
the subsequent cheques from the same cheque book. The matter does
not rest here.

The counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent has

further drawn attention of this court to the documents at pages 15, 16

and 17 of part A file and also to the contents of para 8 at page 7 of leave
to defend application and relying on the same he has contended that as
per resolution passed by the Board of Directors of the defendant company
on 25-05-2002, the cheques exceeding Rs.30,000/- were required to be
signed by all the three directors of the defendant company whereas the
alleged three cheques referred in para 6 of the plaint bear the signatures
of only one Director. This court has gone through the reply of the plaintiff
to para 8 of leave to defend application where this fact is not disputed by
the plaintiff that the cheques in question mentioned in para 6 of the plaint
were signed only by one Director.
This court was initially not inclined to grant leave to the
defendant on its defence of blank cheques but after the court has gone
through the pleadings and the documents shown to the court by learned
counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant, there appears to be a
prima facie strength in what the defendant has contended in the leave to
defend application.

In case the defendant is able to prove and

substantiate its plea that the cheques in question relied upon by the
plaintiff were given to it blank then it would non suit the plaintiff. It may
also be noted that the plaintiff has not given any details of the goods
allegedly supplied by the plaintiff to the defendant for which the cheques
in question were allegedly issued.
In view of the above and having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case, this court is of the considered opinion that the
defendant has raised trible issues which would entitle the defendant to

unconditional leave to defend. I, therefore, grant unconditional leave to
defend to the defendant to contest the present suit.
This

leave

to

defend

application

stands

disposed

of

accordingly.
Anything said or observed in this order shall not influence the
trial of the case.

Statement. Replication may be filed within two weeks thereafter.

Joint Registrar on 07-05-2008.
