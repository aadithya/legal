The

plaintiff

herein

is

a

private

limited

company

incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. It
is the claim of the plaintiff that it had been approached by the
defendant no. 1/company for grant of financial assistance in the
form of bill discounting facility.

On terms and conditions

contained in the plaintiff's letter dated 12th September, 1995, the
plaintiff had agreed to provide bill discounting facility to the
defendant no. 1 to the extent of Rs. 55.0 lacs. Terms were duly
accepted for and on behalf of defendant no. 1 whereby a binding
contract between the parties came into existence.
3.

The defendant no. 2 applicant herein, is alleged to have

furnished a personal guarantee as a Managing Director of the
Company which deed was executed on the 15th of September, 1995.
The defendant no. 1 was required to provide additional security by
pledging the shares of M/s Dhanam Trades and Agencies Ltd.,
M/s Charismatic Trade Links Ltd. and M/s Oasis (India) Ltd.
arrayed as the defendant nos. 3 to 5 before this court, as security
with the plaintiff.
4.

Several documents were executed for and on behalf of

C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 2 of 37

defendant no. 1 for securing the facility granted to it. These
included a demand promissory note and a letter of continuity by a
duly authorized person; post dated cheques for the payment of the
principal amount; post dated cheques to the extent of 15% of the
principal amount towards payment of liquidated damages with a
covering letter in case of failure to repay the amounts on the due
date; letters pledging the equity shares of defendant nos. 3 to 5
with resolutions of the respective Board of Directors; bills of
exchange (hundi) duly stamped and accepted and signatures
thereon duly attested; invoices drawn by the drawers together with
the goods receipts; challans and lorry receipts duly completed in
all respects;

and

an undertaking that in respect of these

bills/invoices, the defendant no. 1 had not sought earlier
discounting facilities.
5.

As per the agreement between the parties, the bill

discounting facility was available only for a period of 105 days.
The plaintiff has claimed that in the event of default, the principal
amount was payable with penal interest at the rate of 48 per cent
per annum from the date of maturity, that is after the expiry of 105
days till the date of payment. As the defendant no. 1 failed to fulfil
the commitment and cheques issued by defendant no. 1 towards
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 3 of 37

discharge of its liability were dishonoured, the plaintiff alleged
that the defendants comprising of the principal debtor, guarantor
and sureties became jointly and severally liable to pay the amount
of Rs. 55.0 lacs of bill discounting facility advanced by the plaintiff
with interest at the rate of 48 per cent per annum and damages of
Rs. 8.25 lacs. The plaintiff had issued a registered letter dated 13th
January, 1996 calling upon the defendants to pay to it a sum of Rs.
63.25 lacs together with interest.
However, in the suit, the prayer was restricted to the amount
of Rs. 55.0 lacs which was being claimed towards the bill
discounting facility and pendente lite and future interest at the
rate of 24 per cent per annum from the date of suit till realization
of the amount.
6.

The suit was filed against M/s Premium International

Finance Ltd. (as defendant no. 1) and Shri Sumaj Jain, M/s
Dhanam Trades and Agencies Ltd., M/s Charismatic Trade Links
Ltd. and M/s Oasis (India) Ltd. as defendant nos. 2 to 5
respectively. The suit was filed under the summary procedure
available to a plaintiff under the provisions of order 37 of the Code
of Civil Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the CPC) on 22nd
September, 1998. The admitted position is that the defendant nos.
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 4 of 37

1 and 2 were served with the summons in the suit in the prescribed
format on the 22nd of February, 1999. The summons had notified
the date of hearing as 7th May, 1999. Memo of Appearance on
behalf of defendant no. 2 was served upon the counsel for the
plaintiff on the 4th of March, 1999. However, the same was filed in
this court by the office of the counsel of the defendant no. 2 only
on 5th March, 1999.
7.

When the suit was listed before the Joint Registrar (A) on

the 7th May, 1999 in the presence of the counsel of the plaintiff, the
following order was passed:“Defendants 1 and 2 have filed memo of appearance
which are taken on record without prejudice. Fresh
summons in the prescribed form under Order 37 to
defendants 3 to 5 on the fresh address to be given and
on PF, RC in two weeks. Dasti.”
Thereafter, the matter was adjourned for the service of
defendants 3 to 5 to the 1st of October, 1999.

On the 18th of

February, 2000, the plaintiff's application (being I.A. No.
1753/2000), seeking substituted service of defendant nos. 3 to 5
by publication of a citation in newspaper, was granted. The matter
was directed to be re-notified on 8th August, 2000 for which date
the report of service of defendant nos. 3 to 5 was awaited. It was
thereupon ordered that if process of fixation are not issued, fresh

C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 5 of 37

steps may be taken in this regard within one week.
8.

In the meantime, the plaintiff sent advance copy of an

application being I.A. no. 8642/2000 dated 7th August, 2000,
under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to counsel for the
defendant no. 2 by registered acknowledgment due post. In this
application, it was contended that the defendant nos. 1 and 2 were
served with the summons in the suit on the 22nd of February, 1999
but they did not enter appearance within ten days. According to
the plaintiff, they filed appearance through counsel vide diary no.
7243 dated 5th March, 2000 which was after the statutory period
and no application for condonation of delay was filed by the
defendant nos. 1 and 2. The plaintiff therefore prayed that the
court shall pass a decree for Rs. 55.0 lacs against the defendants
with interest at the rate of 24 per cent per annum from the date of
filing of the suit till the date of payment thereof.

The

acknowledgment due card addressed to Mr. Kamal Mohan Gupta,
Advocate, at the address which was disclosed in the memo of
appearance filed on court record, bears some signature in receipt
which is dated 9th August, 2000.
9.

I.A. No. 8642/2000 was listed before the court on the 29th

August, 2000 for the first time. No notice thereof was issued on
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 6 of 37

this application even though the application dated 7th August,
2000 was filed only on 18th August, 2000 and listed ten days
thereafter. On the same date, the court held that the defendant
nos. 1 and 2 did not file any application for condonation of delay in
entering appearance and therefore, the defendants having failed to
enter appearance within the statutory period, cannot defend the
suit in law and the allegations in the plaint are deemed to be
admitted and the application was allowed. The plaintiff was held
entitled to a decree as prayed for against defendant nos. 1 and 2.
Therefore, a decree was passed in favour of the plaintiff as against
the defendant nos. 1 and 2 for a sum of Rs. 55.0 lacs with interest
at the rate of 24 per cent per annum from the date of filing of the
suit till payment thereof.
10.

Despite the decree having been passed, the plaintiff waited

for more than 2 years and opted to file Execution Case No.
234/2002 only in the year 2002. This court issued notice to the
judgment debtor including the present defendant no. 2. It has
been contended by defendant no. 2 that he was away on a business
tour since the first week of November, 2002 wherefrom he
returned only on the 6th of January, 2003. The summons were
received in his absence in his office and that the office of the
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 7 of 37

applicant had instructed the retainer counsel Mr. Rajesh Arora to
appear in the court on 9th December, 2002 in compliance with the
notice received in the execution case. The applicant submits that
immediately on return, he contacted Mr. Kamal Mohan Gupta,
Advocate who had been engaged to defend the suit on behalf of
applicant and had filed memo of appearance.

However, Mr.

Kamal Mohan Gupta, Advocate had been seriously ill due to
nephritic problem and could not explain anything.

In these

circumstances, the applicant instructed Mr. Rajesh Arora,
Advocate to ascertain the facts from the court. A vakalatnama was
signed in his favour and Mr. Rajesh Arora, Advocate inspected the
court record on 8th January, 2003. The defendant no. 2/applicant
has stated that it was on the 8th of January, 2003 when
information was received by him for the first time that the memo
of appearance filed on behalf of the applicant was late by one day
i.e. it was filed on 5th of March, 1999 instead of 4th March, 1999
upto which date the same could have been filed by the counsel Mr.
Kamal Mohan Gupta and consequently an ex parte decree dated
29th August, 2000 was passed without issuance of the summons
for judgment which the defendant no. 2 was awaiting.
11.

In this application, the defendant no. 2 has objected to the

C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 8 of 37

manner in which service of summons was effected upon him on
the 22nd of February, 1999.

It has been contended that these

summons were not accompanied by a copy of the plaint nor any
document and as such, the same was no service in the eyes of law.
Learned counsel for defendant no. 2 submits that for this
reason, no decree could have been passed against the applicant.
Additionally, it has been submitted that Mr. Rajesh Arora,
Advocate had to reconstruct the whole record.

Apart from

reconstruction of the record, the defendant no. 2 has stated that
the defendant no. 1-company was wound up on 22nd May, 1998
under orders of the Company Court and that an official liquidator
has been appointed. All the records of defendant no. 1 company
were with the official liquidator resulting in a lot of time being
spent to obtain the copies of the relevant record with regard to the
claim of the plaintiff in the suit and repayments made by
defendant no. 1 in the year 1996 itself. Tracing out the copies of
the correspondence exchanged between the parties was also a time
consuming exercise.
12.

In these circumstances, the defendant no. 2 submits that the

present application was filed on 30th January, 2003 praying for
setting aside the ex parte decree dated 29th August, 2000. The
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 9 of 37

applicant has submitted that the application has been filed within
thirty days from the date of receipt of knowledge about passing of
the ex parte decree on 8th January, 2003 and consequently, the
same is within the prescribed period of limitation.
13.

This application has been vehemently contested on behalf of

plaintiff who has submitted that the defendant no. 2, at no point of
time since the service of the summons on 22nd February, 1999 till
the date of passing of the decree ever challenged the validity of the
service which was effected.

It has been contended that no

credence deserves to be given to the objection of the defendant no.
2 in the application that it was not served in accordance with law.
14.

Mr. Sandeep Sharma, learned counsel for plaintiff has also

challenged the submission on behalf of defendant no. 2 that the
counsel Mr. Kamal Mohan Gupta was severely sick and that the
delay in not filing the memo of appearance by the clerk of the
counsel on 4th March, 1999 deserves to be condoned. It has been
submitted that the counsel inspected the record on 20th January,
2000 and 20th July, 2000 clearly showing that he was not so
incapacitated so as to render him unable to address his
professional obligations. The plaintiff also submits that the
judgment/decree dated 29th August, 2000 was as per the
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 10 of 37

mandatory provisions of Order 37 of the CPC and that the court
has no option but to pronounce the judgment in the light of the
delay in filing memo of appearance by the defendant no. 2. In this
behalf, the plaintiff further submits that there was no legal
requirement for the plaintiff to file I.A. No. 8642/2000 bringing
the delay to the court's notice and that the decree could have been
passed de hors such application. It is further submitted that the
defendant no. 2 was aware of the objection taken by the plaintiff as
the copy of I.A. NO. 8642/2000 was sent to the correct address of
the counsel for the defendant no. 2 and duly received in his office.
For this reason, it is contended that the defendant no. 2 was
conscious of the delay in filing the memo of appearance. It has
been contended that no steps were taken to seek condonation of
delay even after receipt of this application and consequently the ex
parte decree dated 29th August, 2000 deserves to be maintained.
15.

Having given my considered thought to the submissions

made on behalf of both parties, I find that the law provides a
stringent time bound schedule to be followed by the parties for
taking different steps while prosecuting and defending a suit
which has been filed under Order 37 of the CPC. The procedure
provided is summary and aimed at expeditious adjudication and
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 11 of 37

disposal of the suit.

Undoubtedly, dalliance of the defendant

cannot be countenanced and negligence would defeat any
assertion of bona fide. However, it is well settled that rules of
procedure are handmaiden to the ends of justice and cannot be
permitted to defeat the substantial rights of the parties. At the
same time, the time requirement being strict, there is a special
duty cast on the court to ensure that the claim which is being
espoused by the plaintiff is legally tenable and that the plaintiff has
laid the necessary pleadings and material on record to satisfy the
requirements of Order 37 to enable the court to pronounce
judgment at the earliest.
16.

A suit under Order 37 of the CPC is instituted by presenting a

plaint which has to satisfy the requirements of Order 37 Rule 2
thereof. Thereafter, order 37 rule 3 mandates that the plaintiff
shall, together with the summons under rule 2, serve on the
defendant a copy of the plaint and annexures thereto.

The

consequence of failure to serve summons as required by law fell
for consideration before this court in 114 (2004) DLT 264
entitled Hans Raj Vs. Lakhi Ram. In this pronouncement, the
court was considering an application by the defendant for setting
aside of an ex parte decree inter alia on the ground of non-service
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 12 of 37

of the summons as required by order 37 of the CPC. In this behalf,
the court held thus:6.
It is obvious that the non-service of
summons under provisions of Order 37, CPC
would by itself be a special circumstance
entitling the defendant/petitioner to ask for
setting aside the decree. On the summons sent
through ordinary process the Process Server had
reported that defendant was reported to be out
of station and this information was given by the
wife. But the Process Server's report nowhere
indicates that the summons were ever tendered
to the wife. Summons sent by registered post
came with the remarks that addressee is not
available despite repeated approach. In a suit
brought under Order 37, CPC, it is all the more
important for the plaintiff to show that the fact
that the suit was filed under summary procedure
was specifically brought to the notice of the
defendant because in these cases he has to put
an appearance within a period of ten days.
There is nothing on record to show that either
the summons were tendered to the wife of the
petitioner or she was told that defendant has to
appear before Court within a period of ten days.
A perusal of the order sheets reveal that on
several dates either the “Process fee was not
filed by the plaintiff or annexures were not
furnished as a result of which summons could
not be issued. As regards substituted service it
is clear from the perusal of copy of the
newspaper”Statesman” dated 21.10.1995 that
copy of the annexures namely the alleged loan
agreement dated 24.3.1994 were not published
in the newspaper. While dealing with the
service of summons in the suit under Order 37
CPC, this Court in the case of Pubjab and Sind
Bank v. Ramji Das Khanna and Another, AIR
1984 Delhi 175 took the view that where a
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 13 of 37

process server has affixed only the copy of
summons without affixing the copy of plaint and
annexures thereto and the Registrar of the Court
has not held any inquiry to determine whether
service under the circumstances was sufficient,
the service of summons is insufficient and it is a
sufficient circumstance to set aside a decree.
The Court took note of relevant rules of the CPC
and the High Court rules in this regard. Order
37, CPC specifically provides that in a suit under
Order 37, CPC, the plaintiff shall together with
the summons under Rule 2, serve the defendant
with a copy of the plaint and annexure thereto.
Thus where only summons have been affixed
without affixing copy of the plaint and
annexures thereto, the service is not in
accordance with the provisions of Order 37 Rule
3 (1), CPC and this would be a sufficient ground
to set aside the decree. The same view is taken
by another bench of this Court in the case of
New Bank of India v. M/s Master Steel
Marketing Co., 59 (1995) DLT 521=1995 III AD
(Delhi) 957. It was a case of the substituted
service. It was held that where only copy of
summons was published without publishing
copy of the plaint and annexures thereto, the
service was not in accordance with law. As
against this, learned counsel for the respondent
has relied upon the decision in the case of M/s
EMESS Advertising Service v. The Hindustan
Times Ltd., AIR 1998 Delhi 14. It was an
ordinary suit for recovery and not under the
provisions of Order 37, CPC. In that case
publication was held to be sufficient. It is clearly
distinguishable as it was rendered in the context
of an ordinary suit in which case publication of
summons is enough. In the case of an ordinary
suit there is no need to affix copy of the plaint
and the annexures thereto but in a suit brought
under Order 37, CPC it is mandatory that
plaintiff shall together with summons serve on
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 14 of 37

the defendant a copy of the plaint and annexures
thereto. It appears that learned District Judge
was not satisfied with the explanation regarding
date of knowledge of the decree given supported
by the affidavit of the petitioner /defendant. If
at all learned Additional District Judge felt
requisite details are lacking, the petitioner could
have been directed to file additional affidavit or
lead evidence regarding circumstances under
which he came to know about the decree.
Summary
rejection
of
the
petitioner's
application under the circumstances was
uncalled for more so when defendant denied the
very cause of action viz. the execution of the
agreement dated 24.3.1994. In his application
for setting aside the decree as well as for leave to
defend, the petitioner denied the loan
transaction. Bare look at the agreement renders
it suspicious as it has so many cutting which are
unsigned. The only eye-witness who allegedly
signed the loan agreement namely Radhey
Shyam has filed two self contradictory affidavits
in this regard. Under the circumstances, the
defence raised by the defendant /petitioner
cannot be said to be moonshine.
The
defendant's case, if proved, will non-suit the
plaintiff/respondent.
17.

In the instant case, the defendant was admittedly served

with the summons as back as on 22nd of February, 1999. Though
the copy of the summons available on the record does not disclose
as to whether copy of the plaint and the annexures of the
documents was enclosed, however, it is a fact that no objection was
laid by the defendants on receiving the summons. Even in the
memo of appearance which was filed by the counsel on 4th March,
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 15 of 37

1999, no objection has been noted or taken that the summons were
not accompanied by the copy of the plaint and the other
documents required to be served. There is no communication
addressed to counsel for the plaintiff or the plaintiff over the
period during which the suit remained pending that copy of the
plaint or documents was not received by the defendant no. 2.
18.

Mr. Sandeep Sharma, learned counsel for the plaintiff has

drawn my attention to the registered covers which were submitted
by the plaintiff for service of the defendants in accordance with
law. These registered covers having been returned unserved by the
postal authorities are available on the court record. Perusal of
these covers show that the same contained not only the copy of the
summons in the prescribed format but also a copy of the plaint
and photocopies of some documents.
19.

However, perusal of the record of this court shows that the

plaintiff had filed process fee on the 11th of February, 1999 on
which it has stated the purpose of filing as 'notice to the
respondents (sets enclosed with registered A.D. covers).'

The

service report of the defendants on the summons which had been
sent on this process fee has been filed with an affidavit of service
dated 10th March, 1999.
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

Shri P.C. Arya, an employee of the
page 16 of 37

plaintiff-company has deposed on affidavit that service of
defendants 1 and 2 was effected by process server while summons
of the other defendants could not be served. This service was
admittedly effected on the 22nd of February, 1999. The summons
of defendants 3 to 5 which have been returned unserved are not
accompanied with any paper book. Even as per the process fee
form filed by the plaintiff, it is apparent that five copies were
enclosed with five registered covers and there was no additional
copy for service through the process server. Service on defendant
no. 2 has been effected through the process server and an affidavit
of service in this behalf was filed by the plaintiff. The registered
covers were returned unserved.

Therefore, though normally,

failure to make an objection on the part of the defendant would
defeat the objection that the summons were not served with a
copy, however, in the instant case the objection is supported by the
record of this court and therefore the same deserves to be upheld.
20.

In this view of the matter, I have no hesitation in holding

that the summons which were served on the defendant no. 2 on
22nd February, 1999 were not accompanied by copy of the plaint
and the annexures or the documents relied upon by the plaintiff.
21.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff has placed strong reliance

C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 17 of 37

on the inspections conducted of the court record by the office of
Mr. Kamal Mohan Gupta, Advocate pursuant to the application
dated 20th January, 2000. Such inspection was conducted on the
21st of January, 2000. This would have revealed only the order
dated 7th of May, 1999 whereby the memo of appearance on behalf
of defendant no. 2 has been taken on record. The objection to the
memo of appearance was taken by the counsel for the first time
when he filed I.A. No. 8642/2000 on 7th August, 2000.
So far as defendant no. 2 and counsel was concerned, they
would be of the impression that the memo of appearance was in
accordance with law having been taken on record or that,
objections thereto, if any, stood waived.
22.

Furthermore, when the matter was listed on 8th August,

2000, the next date on which the suit was to be listed was 11th of
October, 2000. It was because the plaintiff filed I.A. 8642/2000
that the case was listed on 29th August, 2000 which was not a
scheduled date of hearing and the ex parte decree was passed
without any notice of this application to the defendant no. 2. In
my view, the memo of appearance having been taken on record on
7th May, 1999 without any objection by the plaintiff and the matter
having remained pending for over a year, interest of justice would
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 18 of 37

merit that the notice of the listing of I.A. No. 8642/2000 be sent to
the defendant no. 2/non-applicant.
23.

The plaintiff has submitted that advance copy of this

application was sent to the counsel for the defendant by registered
post.

This application was sent on 7th August, 2000.

An

acknowledgment card bearing a signature and date of receipt as 9 th
August, 2000 has also been placed before this court.

The

signature on the acknowledgment card are in vernacular.
Assuming for the moment that, this application was actually
received in the office of the defendant's counsel. However, it is a
fact that this application was not filed immediately but only on 16th
August, 2000 and re-filed on 22nd August, 2000. It was also not
listed on the fixed date of hearing which was 11th of October, 2000
but on 29th August, 2000. There is no dispute that the normal
practice adopted in the court is to issue court notice of an
application when it is listed. This is more so when the application
was not even filed for immediate hearing.

The counsel for

defendant no. 2 could have very well assumed that the plaintiff did
not intend to actually file or press the application.
24.

Furthermore, in a suit under Order 37 of the CPC, the

defendant would normally expect to be served with the summons
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 19 of 37

for judgment after its memo of appearance had been taken on
record to file leave to defend by the plaintiff.
25.

Coming to the contention that no application was necessary

to point out the delay in filing the memo of appearance, this
submission would be of substance but for the conduct of the
plaintiff after the filing of the memo of appearance by defendant
no. 2. The order dated 7th May, 1999 taking the memo on record
was passed by the Joint Registrar in the presence of the plaintiff
and no objection was taken. 'Without prejudice' loses significance
when no objection is taken by the plaintiff for over a year till
August, 2000.

The admitted position is that counsel for the

defendant has inspected the record on 21st February, 2000 when it
would have been informed that the memo of appearance was on
record. 'Without prejudice' could very well relate to the pleas on
the merits of the matter. The plaintiff was bound to have objected
to the memo being taken on record.
26.

The defendant no. 2 has contended that it had been advised

that the memo of appearance had been filed in accordance with
law and the plaintiff was required to serve summons for judgment
in accordance with law upon the defendant no. 2 or its
representative whereupon further steps in the suit by it were
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 20 of 37

necessitated.
27.

It is noteworthy that despatch of a correctly addressed

document by registered post raises a rebuttable presumption of
service. In the instant case, counsel to whose office the application
was sent by post on 7th August, 2000 has filed an affidavit stating
that the application was never received in his office. It is not even
the plaintiff's case that the acknowledgment due card bears the
signatures of the counsel. The onus therefore would be on the
plaintiff to establish that the AD card was signed by someone in
the office of the counsel.
In 1996 (V) AD (Delhi) 108 entitled Smt. Chander
Kanta Singhal Vs. Kapadia Exports, the court held that
presumption of service had to be drawn in the light of the
suggestion put by the defendant to the plaintiff in evidence. There
is no such material before this court.
28.

The procedure for appearance of defendant is provided

under Rule 3 Order 37. The plaintiff is required to serve upon the
defendant together with the summons under Rule 2, a copy of the
plaint and annexures thereto. Upon such service, the defendant
may, at any time within ten days of such service, enter an
appearance either in-person or by pleader and, in either case, he
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 21 of 37

shall file in court an address for service of notices on him.
Sub-rule 3 of rule 3 of Order 37 postulates that on the date of
entering the appearance, notice of such appearance shall be given
by the defendant on the plaintiff's pleader, or, if the plaintiff sues
in-person, to the plaintiff himself, either by a notice delivered at or
sent by a prepaid letter directed to the address of the plaintiff's
pleader or of the plaintiff, as the case may be.
29.

In the instant case, defendant nos. 1 and 2 through counsel

had served a notice of appearance dated 4th March, 1999 on their
behalf upon the counsel for the plaintiff giving an address for the
service of notices upon them and entering appearance in the suit.
This memo of appearance is available on record and was duly
served in the office of the counsel for the plaintiff on the 4 th of
March, 1999. Despite this service, however, the memo was filed in
court on behalf of the plaintiff by the office of the counsel on the 5th
of March, 1999. The admitted position is that the ten days from
the date of service within which the memo was required to be filed
were expiring on the 4th March, 1999. Therefore, its filing on the
5th of March, 1999 was late by one day.
30.

The entire basis of passing of the ex parte decree on 29th

C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 22 of 37

August, 2000 was that the memo of appearance on behalf of the
defendant was filed late by one day. Order 37 of CPC permits
condonation of delay for special circumstances which are brought
before the court by the defendant. The defendant in the instant
case, stated that memo of appearance was duly prepared within
the period prescribed by law and was even served on counsel for
the plaintiff within such period on the 4th of March, 1999. This
position is not disputed even by the plaintiff. However, the memo
was filed by clerk of the counsel for reasons beyond the control of
the defendant on the 5th of March, 1999.
31.

The question which arises for consideration is the procedure

which the court has to follow upon the defendant failing to enter
appearance within the period prescribed by law.

It would be

useful to notice the requirements of the statute as laid down in
order 37 rule 2 (3) which reads as follows:“ (3) The defendant shall not defend the suit
referred to in sub-rule (1) unless he enters an
appearance and in default of his entering an
appearance the allegations in the plaint shall
be deemed to be admitted and the plaintiff
shall be entitled to a decree for any sum, not
exceeding the sum mentioned in the
summons, together with interest at the rate
specified, if any, up to the date of the decree
and such sum for costs as may be determined
by the High court from time to time by rules
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 23 of 37

made in that behalf and such decree may be
executed forthwith.
The condonation of delay has to be considered looking at the
specificities of the suit and not only the basis of the broad
principles laid down which may in some cases go against equity
and justice. In AIR 1990 Rajasthan 98 (102) entitled M/s
Aradhana Textiles Pvt. Ltd. Vs. M/s Vishnu Textiles
Traders & Ors., where the delay in making application for leave
to defend was due to ignorance of the lawyer, the delay was
condoned subject to payment of costs.
It is a well settled principle of law that fault which could be
attributable to a lawyer should not prejudice the litigant. It was so
held in AIR 1981 SC 1400 entitled Rafiq & Anr. Vs. Munshi
Lal & Anr.
32.

The legislature has envisaged the contingency where delay

occurs on reasonable grounds on the part of the defendant in
entering appearance or in applying the leave to defend suit.
Sub-rule 37 of rule 3 of order 37 has been incorporated for
such an eventuality. The court has been empowered to excuse the
delay by the defendant in entering appearance if sufficient cause is
shown by the defendant.
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 24 of 37

33.

In AIR 1989 Calcutta 288 (at 293) entitled Method

Training and Investment Ltd. Vs. Shree Ambica Jute
Mills Ltd., the court was considering sufficiency of cause for
delay in filing the leave to defend application. In this case, it was
held that where an application for leave to defend was presented
before the officer of the court within the time prescribed but was
filed before the court after the expiry of the prescribed period, the
date for presenting the application in court would be taken as a
date on which the application was placed before the court and the
application would be considered to be within the time prescribed
under order 37 as the courts could not be so technical.
Similarly, in AIR 1983 Karnataka 1 (6) entitled
Harikrishna Punaroor Vs. M/s Seaview Tourist Home,
Mangalore; AIR 1982 Calcutta 386 (387) entitled M/s
Haryana Brewaries Ltd. Vs. M/s The Aluminium Mfg.
Co. Ltd. & Anr. and AIR 1980 Delhi 311 (315) entitled M/s
West Bengal Decorating Co. Vs. M/s Damodar Das
Daga, delay for non-appearance for sufficient cause was
condoned.
In the instant case, no mala fide can be attributed to the
defendants for the delay in filing of Memo of Appearance. The
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 25 of 37

defendants have contended that they had approached the counsel
repeatedly. Because of his sickness or for other reason, he was
unable to take steps in the matter till the last date i.e. 4th March,
1999. Counsel for the defendant who was to contest the matter has
filed an affidavit stating that he was ailing on account of problems
with his kidney and not able to attend to his work properly. Even
otherwise, for the purposes of effecting filing after preparation of
pleadings and documentation, counsels rely on court clerks. There
is no reason to disbelieve the submission on behalf of the counsel
for the defendants that it was by the clerical lapse that the memo
was not filed on the 4th of March, 1999 but was filed on the 5th of
March, 1999, hence late by merely a single day. The statutory
provisions itself provide for condonation of delay. Admittedly,
advance copy of the memo was received by the plaintiff within
time. Admittedly, the Memo of Appearance was prepared and the
defendants signed the vakalatnama in favour of the counsel which
was admittedly served on counsel for the plaintiff on the same day.
The defendant nos. 1 and 2 have stated on affidavit that they were
of the reasonable expectation that the same would be filed in court
on the 4th of March, 1999 and were secure in the belief that they
have authorized counsel and also taken all reasonable and prudent
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 26 of 37

steps as were required by law to be taken by them and as such,
were of the firm belief that their matter was in safe hands and well
looked after.
34.

There is no dispute that service of the Memo of Appearance

was effected on the 4th of March, 1999 itself upon counsel for the
plaintiff at the address in the premises of this court.

The

defendants as well as counsel have sworn an affidavit that it was
on account of a clerical lapse that the memo was not filed by him
on the 4th March, 1999 but on the 5th March, 1999.

The

explanation rendered by the applicants is credible and deserves to
be believed. As to what weighed in the mind of the clerk for not
filing the memo of appearance on the 4th March, 1999 cannot be
ascertained with any certainty, whether it was for want of
knowledge of the imperativeness and the legal requirement that
the same be filed on the 4th March, 1999 or ignorance about the
limitation expiring on the 4th of March, 1999 or whether it was
because the registry had closed for the day by the time he served
the memo on the counsel or whether it was because of sheer
negligence in discharge of his duties, is in the realm of speculation.
Be that as it may, no negligence or fault, however, can be
attributed to either the defendants or the counsel for the non-filing
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 27 of 37

of the memo of appearance on the 4th of March, 1999. The fact
however remains that though the memo of appearance was filed
on record on the 11th day from the service of the summons of the
suit on the defendants, so far as the plaintiff was concerned, it had
received the notice of the memo of appearance within the period of
limitation admittedly.
35.

In the instant case, no objection was taken by the counsel for

the plaintiff when the memo was taken on record on 7th of May,
1999. No objection was taken for more than one year thereafter.
In these circumstances, the defendant/applicant has made out a
case for condonation of one day's delay in filing memo of
appearance.
36.

The plaintiff having obtained the decree dated 29th August,

2000 also took no steps in the matter for a long period till he filed
the execution being Execution Case No. 234/2002. The defendant
no. 2 has submitted that he has no knowledge of passing of the ex
parte decree. The plaintiff however places strong reliance on an
inspection form on record which is dated 20th July, 2002. This
inspection form has been filed by a counsel without disclosing who
he was representing merely terming the same as on behalf of the
'defendants'. The vakalatnama of such counsel is not on record
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 28 of 37

and obviously the defendant no. 2 would not be bound by such
inspection by a counsel who it had not authorized or empowered
to represent it in the matter.
37.

The contention of the defendant no. 2 that it had requested

Mr. Rajesh Arora, Advocate to appear in the matter after the 6 th of
January, 2003 is supported by the vakalatnama and the inspection
form on record. There is no denial by the plaintiff that the
defendant no. 1 was ordered to be wound up by an order dated
22nd May, 1998 of the Company Court in Company Petition No.
256/1997. Therefore a question with regard to the maintainability
of the suit against the defendant no. 1, leave of the company court
as also sufficiency and propriety of service on the defendant no. 1
also arise for consideration.
The plaintiff has been unable to place anything on record
which would establish that the defendant nos. 1 and 2 had any
knowledge of passing of the ex parte decree dated 29th August,
2000 prior to 8th of January, 2003.
38.

This matter has to be examined from yet another angle. In

the application filed by the defendant no. 2, certain averments
have been made on the merits of the case which inter alia include
the following:C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 29 of 37

“14. That it may also be submitted that
though the plaintiff had sanctioned an amount
of Rs.55,00,000/- but paid an amount of
Rs.49,78,000/- after deducting a sum of
Rs.5,22,000/- as advance interest for the
period for the period for which loan had been
advanced to the defendant no.1 company. The
said sum of Rs. 49,78,000/- was paid by the
plaintiff to the defendant No.3 company in the
month of September, 1995, which was
repayable within 105 days, by the defendant
No.1 company.
15. The applicant respectfully submits that
due to the financial crunch in the market, the
said amount could not be paid as agreed
between the parties. However, all efforts were
made to repay the said amount of the plaintiff
company and from March, 1996 to July, 19996
a total sum of Rs.17,75,000/- has been paid by
the company to the plaintiff including
Rs.5,20,000/- which amount was already
deducted by the plaintiff, out of the was
already deducted by the plaintiff, out of the
total loan sanctioned while disbursing the
amount of Rs.49,78,000/- and proof whereof
is annexed hereto marked as Annexure -'A'.
15.1. That the defendant No.1 company,
which gave to the plaintiff, its 4,65,000
shares by way of additional security against
the loan have also transferred the said share
to the plaintiff in their favour, the total value
whereof at that point of time was
Rs.39,52,000/ as per Mumbai Stock
Exchange, against the repayment of the loan.
Thus the plaintiff has already received/
recovered a sum in excess of its advance given
to the defendant No.1 company. It may also
be pointed out that in addition to the
4,65,000 shares of defendant NO.1 company,
on their own showing the plaintiffs were also
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 30 of 37

handed over 2,45,000 shares by defendant
No.3, 71, 1000 shares by defendant NO,5, of
the defendant No.1 company alongwith the
duly signed/executed transfer forms / deeds
by the said defendants, for which no credit
whatsoever has been given by the plaintiff to
the defendants. The copy of the relevant
letter of defendant No.1 company with regard
to the transfer of the shares in favour of the
plaintiff company along with a photocopy of
the daily official list of the Stock Exchange,
Mumbai showing the rate of the share of the
defendant No.1 at the relevant period are
annexed hereto marked as Annexure-'B'
(Colly).
16. That the above facts with regard to the
receipt of Rs.17,75,000/- and transfer of
shares to the tune of Rs.39.50 lakhs have been
deliberately concealed from this Hon'ble court
by the plaintiff.
The plaintiff has not
approached this Hon'ble court with clean
hands and as such is not entitled for any
decree as claimed or otherwise. The applicant
further submits that otherwise also no decree
could have been passed without affording the
present defendant an opportunity to defend
the false, baseless and illegal claim raised by
the plaintiff in the suit.”
39.

The defendant no.2/applicant has submitted that the order

of winding up having been passed against the defendant no. 1, no
decree could have been passed without leave of the company court
or impleading the official liquidator as a party to the suit.
40.

The plaintiff has opted not to even deny these allegations let

alone filing a reply to these averments. Other objections taken by
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 31 of 37

the defendant no. 2 in this application also remain unrepudiated.
So far as the stand of defendant no. 2 to the effect that several
payments which were made to the plaintiff are not reflected in the
plaint is concerned, it has been orally submitted by learned
counsel for the plaintiff that these matters relate to accounting and
the accounts of the parties can very well be settled in the execution
proceedings.
41.

Be that as it may, however, the fact therefore would be that

the amount claimed in the suit was not actually due or payable by
the defendants. The plaintiff has not correctly quantified the
amount which the defendants were owing to the plaintiff. For this
reason alone, the decree which was granted in favour of the
plaintiff could not have been granted.
42.

Furthermore, the suit of the plaintiff is based upon a written

agreement purportedly executed between the parties as well as
other documents in the nature of guarantee deed, promissory
notes etc. The suit was based entirely on the written documents.
In order to become entitled to a decree, the court had to be
satisfied at the time of passing judgment and decree, firstly of the
existence of such documentation and secondly, as to the legality
and validity thereof.
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 32 of 37

43.

It has been contended that there was no opposition to the

suit and as a result, the averments made in the plaints were
deemed to be admitted in law as per the provision of order 37 of
the CPC. Consequently, according to the plaintiff, nothing further
was required to be done other than to examine the averments in
the plaint.
44.

To my mind, this would not be the correct position in law. It

would be the duty of the court to satisfy itself that the suit of the
plaintiff was maintainable under Order 37 of the Code of Civil
Procedure and to arrive at a conclusion that the plaintiff was
entitled in law to the award of a decree in its favour even in a case
where the defendant had failed to enter appearance or put in any
kind of defence. A suit which rests wholly on written agreements
and documentation, is required to be supported by such
documents. The plaintiff before this court, did not file the originals
of the documents which it was placing reliance on. Only
photocopies of the agreement, promissory note, hundi, guarantee
deed etc. were filed before the court. Undoubtedly, a photocopy is
at best secondary evidence of the original. Such photocopy can be
looked at only if the original is not available or cannot be produced
for good reason. However, the photocopy cannot take the place of
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 33 of 37

an original documents which is deliberately not placed before the
court. A suit under order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure is
necessarily required to be accompanied by the original documents
which are the basis of the claim before the court.
45.

In 1995 (34) DRJ 86 : 1995 Vol. 2 AD (Delhi) 189

entitled

Sudhir

Engineering

Company

Vs.

Nitco

Roadways Ltd., this court held that even admission of a
document by the other side would not enable the court to dispense
with formal proof so as to entitle a party to lead the document in
evidence. In XII (1976) DLT 82 entitled S.P. Ray Vs. Union
of India, the court defined the meaning of 'documents' and also
set down what documents a party could call upon the other party
to admit or deny.
46.

The Code of Civil Procedure permits summary procedure to

be adopted in respect of suits for recovery of a debt or a liquidated
demand in money payable by the defendants.

Where the

defendant disputes the nature of documents or there were
discrepancies in the purported negotiated documents, courts have
held that the issues raised by the defendant were triable issues and
leave to defend was granted to the defendants (re: State Bank of
Saurashtra Vs. Ashit Shipping Services Pvt. Ltd., (2002)
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 34 of 37

4 SCC 736)
47.

In Sunil Enterprises Vs. SBI Commercial and

International Bank Ltd., (1998) 5 SCC 354, the Bank had
continued to pay out large amounts of bills of exchange accepted
by the party who was already a defaulter.

The bills of exchange

were accepted by the defendant even though they had discharged
earlier bills of exchange as and when they were due.
contended that some of the

It was

bills of exchange were merely

secondary documents and, therefore, these matters required
examination.

In this case, the apex court held that the defence

taken by the appellants could not be held to be totally defenceless
or moonshine or illusory and therefore, the appellant-defendant
was entitled to unconditional leave to defend the suit.
48.

The scheme of Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure shows

that the same is an enabling provision which has been enacted
with the object to abridgment of the proceedings and the rapidity
of disposal of certain claims. The provision of Order 37 provides
certain rules of procedure to be applied after a plaint is admitted in
the prescribed cases without altering in any way the nature of the
suit or the jurisdiction of the courts.
A summary suit is a suit based on documents.
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 35 of 37

If the

document itself is not admissible or cannot be acted upon for any
reason, the summary suit would not lie. In 1989 Maharashtra
Law Journal 310: 1988 Vol. 90 Bombay Law Reporter
560 entitled Yogendra Patwardhan Vs. Khandelwal
Hermann Electronics Ltd., it was held that if the document
was not admissible in evidence for want of proper stamp duty, the
summary suit would not lie.

The documents relied on must

faithfully disclose the transaction and the summary suit should be
based on such transaction alone.
49.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff has drawn my attention to

the pronouncement of the Apex Court in AIR 2003 SC 1322
entitled Rajni Kumar Vs. Suresh Kumar Malhotra to
contend that under Order 37 Rule 4, the defendant has to show not
only special circumstances which prevented him from appearing
or applying for leave to defend but also facts which would have
entitled him to leave to defend. In the instant case, the occasion to
file leave to defend did not arise since the decree was passed as the
memo of appearance was belated. However, on the admission
before this court that certain amounts received from the
defendants have not been reflected and failure to file the original
documents, it has to be held that the defendant has shown special
C.S. (O.S) No. 2010/1998

page 36 of 37

circumstances entitling him to relief in the present application.
50.

In my view, therefore, the instant case is a case where

sufficient cause has been shown for the delay in entering
appearance on the part of the defendant nos. 1 and 2 and the same
deserves to be excused within the meaning of the expression in
sub-rule 7 of rule 3 of order 37.
Accordingly, this application is allowed. The ex parte decree
dated 29th August, 2000 passed in favour of the plaintiff as against
the defendant nos. 1 and 2 cannot stand and is hereby set aside.
The delay in filing the memo of appearance by the defendants is
hereby condoned. The parties shall stand relegated to the stage in
the suit when the memo of appearance was filed by the defendant
nos. 1 and 2.
