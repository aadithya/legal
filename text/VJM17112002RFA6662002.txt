1.

These four connected appeals are being disposed of by

this common judgment as they raise similar questions of law and
fact. For the sake of convenience, reference is being made to the
facts of RFA No.610/2002.
2.

This Regular First Appeal under Section 96 of the Code

of Civil Procedure, 1908 challenges the impugned judgment and
decree dated 16.4.2002 of the Trial Court which decreed the suit of
the respondent/plaintiff/landlord for arrears of rent from 1.12.1996
to 3.6.1998.
3.

The

facts

of

the

case

are

that

the

appellant/defendant/bank took on lease the subject premises
situated at First floor of M-53 , Shopping Centre, Greater Kailash-II,
New Delhi-48 vide a registered lease deed dated 12.11.1996.

The

monthly rent was Rs.30,625/-. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi
(MCD) had issued a show-cause notice dated 28.11.1996 with
respect to deviations from the sanctioned plan in the shape of
excess coverage.

The appellant/bank stated that because of this

RFA Nos.610/2002, 665/2002, 666/2002 & 667/2002

Page 2 of 8

notice, they were not able to utilize the leased premises and
therefore they were not liable to pay the rent from 1.12.1996. The
appellant/bank did not pay the rent from 1.12.1996 to the
respondent/plaintiff/landlord. The subject suit therefore came to be
filed by the respondent/landlord claiming arrears of rent from
1.12.1996 to 3.6.1998, the latter being the date on which
admittedly keys of the premises were handed over by the
appellant/bank to the respondent/landlord.
4.

There

are

two

determination in this appeal.

issues

which

are

required

for

The first issue is that whether the

liability to pay rent by the appellant to the respondent came to an
end on receipt of the notice dated 28.11.1996 of the MCD.

The

second issue is that if the liability did not come to an end, from
when does the liability to pay the rent come to an end in the facts of
the present case.
5.

It is an undisputed fact that the notice of the MCD dated

28.11.1996 was received during the period for which there was a
registered lease deed with respect to the suit premises. The parties
had entered into a registered lease deed dated 12.11.1996 for the
period from 1.11.1995 to 30.10.1998. Thus, the notice of the MCD
dated 28.11.1996 claiming excess coverage was received by the
appellant during the period of the lease of the premises leased out
under the registered lease deed dated 12.11.1996.

A lease for a

fixed period can only be terminated in terms of the clause in the
same and therefore it is necessary, at this stage, to refer to para 10
RFA Nos.610/2002, 665/2002, 666/2002 & 667/2002

Page 3 of 8

of the lease deed and the same reads as under:“10) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in
any other document, the LESSEE shall be free to
vacate the premises by giving a notice to the
LESSOR one month prior to the date of the vacation.”
Once, there is a registered lease deed for a fixed period

6.

with respect to the leased premises, the lease can only be
terminated in terms of the clause of the lease deed.

In such cases,

there is no scope for treating the tenancy as a monthly tenancy
terminable by notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property
Act, 1996.
because

However, in the present case, the effect is still same

the

appellant/bank

could

have

without

any

reason

terminated the tenancy by giving a one month’s notice. Thus, it has
to be seen when did the appellant/bank gave this notice to
terminate the tenancy by giving a notice of one month.
7.

The first document which is relied upon on behalf of the

appellant is a letter dated 4.4.1997 written by the Advocates of the
appellant to the respondent/landlord. Para 8 of this notice is relied
upon and the same reads as under:
“8.
That as our client are unable to use the said
premises freely and are under constant threat of
legal action because of Show Cause Notice by the
MCD, our Client has already suffered heavy business
losses which are still continuing only because of your
false assurances and misrepresentation. Therefore,
in pursuance to the Agreement to Lease, you are
liable to indemnify our Client for all the losses and
damages suffered due to not using the premise to
the extent of `20 Lacs (Rupees Twenty Lacs only).”
In my opinion, nothing in this para can in any manner be
said to be a notice terminating the tenancy after 30 days and as
RFA Nos.610/2002, 665/2002, 666/2002 & 667/2002

Page 4 of 8

was the contractual obligation of the appellant/bank in terms of
afore-quoted para 10 of the lease deed.

Merely stating that the

respondent had given a wrong assurance and would be liable
for damages cannot mean that the letter dated 4.4.1997 can be
treated as a notice terminating the tenancy. Para 8 of the notice, in
fact, is relatable to para 8 of the lease deed and which required the
bank to be indemnified with respect to its occupation of the leased
premises

on

account

of

any

action by a local body or public authority.
8.

Not only, the letter dated 4.4.1997 of the appellant/bank

to the respondent cannot be treated as a notice under Clause 10 of
the lease deed, but also, a simplicitor request made on behalf of the
appellant/bank to the respondent to take over the possession of the
premises without the notice period of 30 days cannot be treated as
a compliance of Clause 10 of the lease deed.
9.

The judgment in the case of Onida Finance Limited

vs. Malini Khanna, 2002 (3) AD (Delhi) 231 as relied upon by
counsel for the appellant will not apply to the facts of the present
case because in the present case there is a registered lease deed
and clauses whereof will bind the parties whereas in the facts of
Onida Finance Limited vs. Malini Khanna (supra), the tenancy
was a month-to-month tenancy and therefore it was observed by
the Court that a landlord has to take possession when the tenant
offers to hand back the possession. As already stated above, in the
present case, lease cannot be terminated by merely seeking to hand
RFA Nos.610/2002, 665/2002, 666/2002 & 667/2002

Page 5 of 8

over the keys because as per Clause 10 of the registered lease
deed, the tenancy has to be terminated specifically by means of a
one month’s notice.
10.

The next letter which is relied upon on behalf of the

appellant is the letter of its Advocate dated 13.9.1997 in which it is
mentioned that the respondent has not taken the keys in spite of
appellant/bank asking the said keys to be taken. Once again, in my
opinion, asking for taking of keys, cannot be said to be compliance
of Clause 10 of the lease deed inasmuch as once there is a
registered lease deed for a fixed period for the leased premises, the
parties are bound by the same and they had to act in accordance
with the same.

I may note that the notice of the MCD dated

28.11.1996 was never followed up in any manner either by a further
notice or either by passing of a sealing order or by serving of a
sealing

order either on the appellant or on the respondent.

Therefore, merely because the MCD had sent a notice, cannot mean
that the appellant/bank would have been ipso facto prevented from
using the premises. The actual stopping of user of premises or the
real threat for stoppage of the use of the premises could only have
come into existence if there was a sealing order of the MCD, and
admittedly there was no sealing order passed by the MCD.
Therefore, mere notice of the MCD dated 28.11.1996 cannot entitle
the appellant to stop making payment of the rent.
11.

Reliance is next placed on behalf of the appellant on its

letter dated 1.3.1998 and in which the appellant has asked the
RFA Nos.610/2002, 665/2002, 666/2002 & 667/2002

Page 6 of 8

respondent to collect the keys not later than 31.3.1998. Though,
this letter does not specifically state that the lease is terminated 30
days after this letter however, one can give a practical/reasonable
interpretation to this letter inasmuch as effectively by asking for
taking the keys after 30 days, would be, in substance, compliance of
Clause 10 of the lease deed. It is therefore necessary to refer to
para 3 of this letter dated 1.3.1998 which was sent on behalf of the
appellant/bank to the respondent:
“3.
Our Client therefore reiterates that the earliest
communication dt.4.4.1997 itself was the notice of
termination of tenancy. But instead of taking the
keys of the premises, you have been harping on
untenable contentions for unjust enrichment.
However, without prejudice to any of the legal rights
or our client you are hereby called upon to collect the
keys of the premises from our client on any working
day between 11 AM and 4 PM not later than
31.3.1998 failing which our client shall take such
steps as may be advised holding you liable for all the
costs and consequences arising therefrom.”
In view of the aforesaid para 3 of this letter dated
1.3.1998 which mentions requirement of the respondent to take
over the keys and which is a notice of 30 days, I would seek to
interpret this notice as a notice to terminate the tenancy, though,
there is no specific language that the tenancy will stand determined.
As I have already stated above request to take the keys after 30
days, i.e. not later than 31.3.1998 by this letter dated 1.3.1998 can
be interpreted as terminating the tenancy with effect from
31.3.1998 by a notice of 30 days as required by Clause 10 of the
lease deed.
RFA Nos.610/2002, 665/2002, 666/2002 & 667/2002

12.

Admittedly, in the present case, physical possession of

the premises was handed over by the appellant/bank to the
respondent on 3.6.1998 and therefore the Trial Court has decreed
the suit for arrears of rent from 1.12.1996 to 3.6.1998. In view of
the fact that I have accepted the argument on behalf of the
appellant that para 3 of the notice dated 1.3.1998 can be said to be
termination of tenancy by giving a notice of 30 days in terms of para
10 of the lease deed, the present appeal is partly allowed and
disposed of by modifying the impugned judgment and decree by
granting rent to the respondent not from 1.12.1996 to 3.6.1998 but
only from 1.12.1996 to 31.3.1998.

Decree sheet be accordingly

prepared. Parties are left to bear their own costs.
13.

The appellant has deposited a sum of `1,00,000/- in

each of the appeals. The impugned judgments and decrees in the
four appeals are for different amounts much in excess of `1,00,000/.
Therefore, the respondent will be entitled to withdraw the amount
deposited in this Court, along with accrued interest, if any, in part
satisfaction of the impugned judgment and decree as modified by
this Court. Appeal is disposed of accordingly. Trial Court record be
sent back.
