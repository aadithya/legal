ANIL KUMAR, J.

1.

This is a petition under Section 11(6) of Arbitration &

Conciliation

Act,

1996

for

appointment

of

an

arbitrator

for

adjudication of disputes which have arisen between the parties.

2.

The petitioner contended that he is a registered contractor of

the respondent and was awarded a work of wild/Imp./Stg. of road

from Rawta village to Galibpur village in Najafgarh Zone S/H Wid. of
carriageway and stg. of carriageway by the respondents through its
Executive Engineer – VI vide work order No.EE-VI/plan/TC/0304/285 dated 12th September, 2003. An amount of Rs.91,40,135/was payable to the petitioner for the work awarded to him.
agreement

was

executed

between

the

parties

and

clause

The

incorporated the arbitration agreement between the parties.

3.

The petitioner contended that as per the terms of the

agreement, the work was to start on 21rd September, 2003 and was to
be completed on or before 20th September, 2004 within twelve
months.

The petitioner started the work

which was completed on

20th January, 2005. According to the petitioner the delay in the
completion of work was on account of reasons attributable solely to
the respondents.

4.

The petitioner contended that the first, second and third

running

bills

for

a

gross

amount

of

Rs.5,07,907.53/-,

Rs.20,62,883.42 and Rs.62,82,716/- respectively were prepared and
passed by the respondents however, a bill for an amount of
Rs.79,48,506/- in respect of the other works done by the petitioner in
terms of the agreement was neither passed nor any payments were
made by the respondents despite repeated requests. The petitioner
AA No.435/2006

Page 2 of 8

contended that the respondent, instead of releasing payment, has
deducted a sum of Rs.5 lac lying with them as security against the
work awarded. According to the petitioner, the respondent refused to
accept the bank guarantee in respect of the work awarded

after a

lapse of 4 months of submission of the same, therefore, the petitioner
have also sought for cost of procuring the bank guarantee and also
the processing charges. The petitioner also pleaded that the
respondent has also wrongly deducted an amount of Rs.3,51,000/under

the

head

water

tax

which

is

not

applicable

to

tender/agreement.

5.

Consequently

disputes

have

arisen

between

the

parties.

According to the petitioner clause 25 of the general agreement entered
into between the petitioner and the respondent contained the
Arbitration agreement.

Clause 25 of the agreement containing the

arbitration agreement is as under:“25. Except where otherwise provided in the contract all
questions and disputes relating to the meaning of the
specifications, designs, drawings and instructions herein
before mentioned and as to the quality of workmanship of
materials used on the work or as to any other question
claim, right matter or thing whatsoever in any way arising
out or relating to the contract designs, drawings,
specifications, estimates instructions orders or these
conditions or otherwise concern in the work or the
execution of the failure to execute the same whether
arising during the progress of the work or after the
completion or abandonment shall be referred to the sole
arbitrator appointed by the Commissioner, MCD. The
AA No.435/2006

Page 3 of 8

parties to the dispute shall be found to abide by the terms
of the award passed by the Arbitrator.”

6.

Since no payment was forthcoming petitioner issued a legal

notice dated 14th August, 2006 requesting the respondent to pay the
amounts due to him and in the alternative sought for appointment of
an arbitrator in terms of clause 25 of the arbitration agreement
between the parties.

The respondent not only failed to make

payments to the petitioner but also failed to appoint an arbitrator in
terms of arbitration agreement between the parties within the
stipulated time.

7.

Consequently, the petitioner had filed the present petition. The

arbitrator was not appointed by the respondents till the time of filing
of the present petition. Despite opportunity given, the respondents
have not filed any reply to the petition. The learned counsel for the
respondent, however, is unable to point out as to how the
Commissioner can now appoint an arbitrator in terms of clause 25 of
the general agreement after failing to appoint an arbitrator within
thirty days of notice and even before filing of the present petition.
Consequently it is for this Court to appoint an arbitrator to adjudicate
the disputes between the parties.

The Apex Court in Datar Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance Ltd.

& Anr., IV (2000) CLT 191 (SC)=VII (2000) SLT 543=JT 2000 (Suppl.
2) SC 226 had held that if the vacancy of an arbitrator is not filled till
a party approaches the Court and files a petition for appointment by
the designated authority of the Chief Justice of that Court under
Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the right to
supply vacancy by the opposite party is extinguished. This ratio of
Datar Switchgear Ltd.(supra) was approved by the Supreme Court in
Punj Lloyed Ltd. Vs Petronet MHB Ltd., (2006) 2 SCC 628 and it was
reiterated that once period of notice had lapsed and the petitioner had
moved under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996, the party having right to appoint arbitrator under arbitral
agreement loses the right to do so.

9.

A learned Single Judge in Haryana Telecom Ltd. v. Union of

India & Anr., 112 (2004) DLT 339=2004 (3) RAJ 147, had held that if
the respondent fails to appoint an Arbitrator within the stipulated
time of 30 days of the notice, and even after filing of the petition
under Section 11 of the Act, it is for the Court to appoint an
Arbitrator. A Division Bench of this Court in Delkon (India) Pvt. Ltd.
v. G.M., Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., 120 (2005) DLT 542 (DB),
relying on Datar Switchgears Ltd Vs Tata Finance Ltd has held in
para 4 as under:
AA No.435/2006

Page 5 of 8

“4. We have given our careful consideration to the
arguments advanced by learned Counsel for both the
parties. In view of the law laid down in the case of Datar
Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance Ltd. & Anr., IV (2000)
CLT 191 (SC)=VII (2000) SLT 543=JT 2000 (Suppl. 2) SC
226 it is no more res integra that the vacancy can be
supplied by a party pursuant to the arbitration agreement
even after thirty days of the receipt of the notice. However,
once a party approaches the Court and files a petition for
appointment by the designated authority of the Chief
Justice of that Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, the right to supply vacancy by the
opposite party is extinguished. If that right stood
extinguished on filing of the petition under Section 11(6)
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, in September
1998 the appointment of an Arbitrator on 3rd May, 1999
could not be made, therefore in our view, the order
passed by the learned Single Judge on 7th May, 1999
suffers from patent illegality. Therefore, the submission of
the respondent that the petitioner had appeared before
the Arbitrator and the application of the petitioner raising
preliminary objections is pending adjudication which
inter alia challenges the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to
decide the dispute is of no consequence as from the order
reproduced above it was pursuant to the directions
passed by the learned Single Judge that the parties were
directed to appear before the Arbitrator. The petitioner
had no other option but to appear before the Arbitrator
and after appearing before the Arbitrator the petitioner
has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator,
rather has at first opportunity taken the objection that
the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to proceed with the
matter.

10.

In Union of India v. M/s. R.R. Industries, 120 (2005) DLT 572

(DB) also it was held that once a party does not supply the vacancy or
fails to supply the vacancy before filing of a petition under Section
AA No.435/2006

Page 6 of 8

11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, such a party forfeits the
right to supply the vacancy in terms of the arbitration clause and
what remains is only the arbitration clause, i.e. the dispute has to be
resolved under the mechanism of alternative dispute redressal
scheme but no right survives to the respondent to supply the named
Arbitrator in the arbitration clause.

11.

The notice dated 14th August, 2006 was sent by UPC and by

registered A.D. post.

The petitioner has produced the copy of

acknowledgment card showing the receipt of the notice. Despite the
receipt of the notice demanding appointment of an arbitrator, the
respondent did not appoint an arbitrator within 30 days of receipt of
notice nor any arbitrator was appointed prior to filing of the present
petition.

12.
no

The petition under Section 11(6) was filed in October 2006 and
reply

has

been

filed

by

the

respondent

despite

various

opportunities given to the respondent. The respondents also failed to
reply to the notice dated 14th August, 2006 demanding the amounts
due from the respondent to the petitioner. In the said notice the
petitioner in the alternative had also sought for appointment of an
arbitrator.

In the circumstances, the statement made by the

petitioner are deemed to be accepted and the respondent has forfeited
AA No.435/2006

Page 7 of 8

his right to appoint an arbitrator in terms of clause 25. A valid
arbitration agreement also cannot be disputed by the respondent in
the facts and circumstances.

13.

Considering

the

facts

and

circumstances,

I

appoint

Mr.G.P.Thareja Advocate, (Retd. Additional District Judge) B-201,
Priyadarshini Apartments, I.P Extension, Patpar Ganj, Delhi-110092

petitioner in the first instance.

Arbitrator on 21st January, 2008 at 4.30 PM. Registry to send a copy
of this order to the Arbitrator forthwith. Parties are also directed to
intimate the Arbitrator about the order. Copy of this order be also
given to the parties dasti.
