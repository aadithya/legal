By way of this appeal, the appellant insurance
company has assailed the findings of the Tribunal
merely on the ground that the respondent no.6, insured
owner of the vehicle had converted the chassis number
which was meant for the

truck into a bus without

informing the insurance company.
The

contention

of

the

counsel

appellant is that a new chassis was issued
representation of the insured

for

the

at the

and the premium as

payable for truck was charged and accordingly, the
insurance policy was issued for a truck and not for a
bus.

Counsel

contends that at no point of time the

owner insured got any rectification done in the policy
for changing it from truck to bus after paying the extra
premium.

Counsel for the appellant, therefore has

sought to urge that

since

the policy issued by the

appellant was not for bus, therefore, the insurance

FAO NO. 887/2003

page 2 of 9

company has no liability whatsoever to indemnify the
third party. In the alternative, counsel for the appellant
also submits that the appellant is entitled for recovery
rights against the owner of the vehicle. In support of
his argument counsel for the appellant has drawn my
attention to the original policy in which in the relevant
column concerning description of the vehicle the same
is clearly filled by giving the description of the vehicle
as 'truck'. The chassis
same

and the engine numbers were

at the time of taking the policy. Counsel also

contends that there is no dispute raised as regards the
said premium paid by the insured, which was meant for
a truck and not for a bus. The policy also shows that no
extra premium for the passenger's risk had been paid.
Counsel thus contends that in such circumstances no
liability can be fastened

on the appellant insurance

company on account of the involvement of the bus in

FAO NO. 887/2003

page 3 of 9

the said accident.
Per contra Mr. Dinesh Goyal, counsel for
respondent no.6 contends that there is no infirmity in
the impugned award. The counsel for respondent no.6
contends that at the time of taking the cover note, it
was duly stated that the owner insured has been taking
the cover note meant for the bus and not for the truck.
Counsel further contends that

whatever amount was

demanded from the insured towards premium,
same was paid by the

the

insured and it cannot be said

that the said premium paid by the insured was meant
for a truck and not for a bus. Counsel also contends
that

the original policy was never received by the

insured, therefore, there was

no occasion for the

insured respondent to request

for any rectification of

the vehicle from truck to the bus.
In support of his argument counsel

FAO NO. 887/2003

for the

page 4 of 9

respondent has invited my attention

to the cross-

examination of R3W-1, Mr. Prem Chand, Development
Officer of the insurance company. In the examinationin-chief the said witness stated that the body of the
vehicle could be converted into a bus or a truck. In the
cross-examination the said witness had admitted that
he had not brought

any document to show

that the

insurance policy had been dispatched to the owner of
the vehicle. It had also been admitted

by the said

witness that no notice was sent to the registered owner
of the vehicle to produce the registration certificate of
the vehicle. Not only this, even no notice under Order
12 Rule 8 was sent by the insurance company so as to
call the original policy from the insured as same is
manifest

from

the

cross-examination

of

the

said

witness.
It is no doubt true that the insurance policy

FAO NO. 887/2003

page 5 of 9

meant for a truck could not have been converted into a
bus at the whims and fancies of the insured itself and
for such a conversion, necessary rectification ought to
have been done by the insured. This question, however
would arise only when it is established that the owner of
the vehicle got the insurance only in respect of the
truck and not of the bus. The proposal form which was
exhibited as Ex.R3W1/1 was filled in by the said
Development Officer, R3W1, who at no place mentioned
that the said proposal form was meant for taking the
insurance policy for a truck.

Surprisingly, there is no

such column in the proposal form in which such
information could be given. Proposal of the cover note,
Ex.R3W1/3, also does not carry any such detail except
the chassis number which was duly mentioned in the
said note. Similarly,

in the

receipt

Ex.R3W1/2,

nothing of this sort has been mentioned.

FAO NO. 887/2003

If the

page 6 of 9

insurance company has accepted the premium for a
truck then at least in the cover note as well as in the
receipt and in the proposal form this should have been
clearly mentioned that the insurance cover is

being

given for the said chassis meant for a truck. The said
witness

of the insurance company has categorically

stated that the said very chassis can be converted into
a truck or even into a bus.

It is, therefore, apparent

that the necessary information of the chassis has to be
furnished right at the initial stage and if the same has
not been furnished by the insured then the fault lies on
the appellant insurance company more than

the

insured. The insured at the time of making payment
towards premium cannot be supposed to know that
he is making payment towards the insurance of a bus
or a truck and it is because of this reason, the Tribunal
in the impugned award has observed that from the

FAO NO. 887/2003

page 7 of 9

entire record he failed to find any reason for respondent
no.2, insured to get the chassis first registered as a
truck and then get it converted

into a bus.

No

inspection of the vehicle was carried out at the time of
issuing of cover note and even at the later stage when
the policy was alleged to have been sent by the
appellant insurance company. The appellant has thus
failed to place or prove anything on record to show that
the respondent had got insured the truck and not the
bus. In the absence of any evidence placed by the
appellant, the arguments now advanced by the counsel
for the appellant cannot be appreciated.
I also do not find any merit in the submission
of counsel for the appellant that recovery rights be
given to the appellant against the respondent. Once
the appellant has failed to substantiate its plea in this
regard before the Tribunal, no recovery rights can be

FAO NO. 887/2003

page 8 of 9

granted at this stage.
I, therefore, do not find any merit in the
present appeal.
Appeal stands dismissed accordingly.
