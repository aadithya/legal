On 07.02.2007 when this matter came up for the first time, the

learned counsel for the petitioner questioned the authority of Mr Nitin
WP(C)1012/2007

Page No.1 of 6

Wakankar to continue as the Estate Officer in respect of the premises, inter
alia, comprised in President's Estate in New Delhi. He had submitted that in
view of Section 3 of the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants)
Act, 1971 (hereinafter referred to as the said Act) the power to appoint an
Estate Officer vests with the Central Government. Section 3 of the said Act
reads as under:
“3. Appointment of Estate Officers.- The Central Government
may, by notification in the Official Gazette,(a) appoint such persons, being Gazetted Officers of
Government 1[or of the Government of any Union
Territory] or officers of equivalent rank of the 2

Officers for the purposes of this Act; 3[xxx]

[Provided that no officers of the Secretariat of the
Rajya Sabha shall be so appointed except after
consultation with the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and
no officer of the Secretariat of the Lok Sabha shall be
so appointed except after consultation with Speaker of
the Lok Sabha:
Provided further that an officer of a Statutory Authority
shall only be appointed as an Estate Officer in respect
of the public premises controlled by that authority; and]
(b) define the local limits within which, or the categories of
public premises in respect of which, the Estate Officers
shall exercise the powers conferred, and perform the

The learned counsel further submitted that the Gazette of India No.

29 for the period July 13 – July 19, 2003 contained a notification dated
15.07.2003 issued by the President's Secretariat designating Shri Nitin
Wakankar as the Estate Officer for premises comprising the President's Estate
in New Delhi, Shimla (Himanchal Pradesh), Dehradun (Uttaranchal) and
Bolarum, Secunderabad (Andhra Pradesh).

The said notification reads as

under:“PRESIDENT'S SECRETARIATE
New Delhi, the 15th July, 2003
S.O. 1955.- in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3 of
the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act,
1971 and in supersession of the then Government of India in the
Ministry of Works and Housing Notification No. S.O. 720 dated
the 10th March, 1973, the Central Government hereby appoints
the officer mentioned in column (1) of the Table below being a
Gazetted Officer of the Government to be the Estate officer for
the purposes of the said act who shall exercise the powers
conferred and perform the duties imposed on Estate officer by
or under the said Act within local limits of his respective
jurisdiction in respect of the public premises specified in
corresponding entry in column (2) of the said table.

It was further contended on behalf of the petitioner that the above

notification was framed by the President's Secretariat and that would not
amount to a notification issued by the Central Government which was a
requirement under Section 3 of the said Act. He referred to the allocation of
Business Rules framed by the President which indicates that the proceedings
under the said Act would fall within the purview of Department of Urban
Development, Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation. It was
the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the said Mr Nitin
Wakankar ought to have been appointed by the Ministry of Urban Development
and Poverty Alleviation, according to the allocation of Business Rules, being
part of the Central Government and not by the President's Secretariat. Since,
this has not been done, Mr Nitin Wakankar had no authority to be appointed as
an Estate Officer and to continue as such and it is for this reason that this writ
of quo- warranto has been filed by the petitioner.
4.

The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent

submitted that the provisions of Section 3 of the said Act have been fully
complied with. She submitted that the notification was issued by the President's
Secretariat and was authenticated by Mr Satish Mathur, Director.

In this

connection, she referred to the Authentication (Orders and other Instruments)

WP(C)1012/2007

Page No.4 of 6

Rules 2002 which was notified on 16.02.2002. As per the said Rules, all orders
and other instruments made and executed in the name of the President shall be
authenticated in the case of orders and other instruments relating to the
President's Secretariat by, inter alia, “a Director” in the President's Secretariat.
There is no dispute that Mr Satish Mathur is a Director in the President's
Secretariat and the said notification has been authenticated by him.
5.

The next submission that was made by the learned counsel for the

respondent was that the President's Secretariat itself would be covered by the
definition of Central Government given in Section 3(8) (b) of the General
Clauses Act, 1897. The said provision defines “Central Government” to mean,
inter alia, in relation to anything done or to be done after the commencement of
the Constitution, “the President”. Even as per the allocation of Business Rules,
the President's Secretariat falls within the purview of the Central Government.
Therefore, according to the learned counsel for the respondent, the notification
appointing Mr Nitin Wakankar as the Estate Officer was clearly one issued by
the Central Government inasmuch as the President's Secretariat is the Central
Government. The learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that
vide Office memorandum dated 29.11.1972 issued by the Central Government,
Government of India, Ministry of Works and Housing, Directorate of Estates,
after a review of the entire position, indicated that the work relating to
appointment of Estate officers by the Central Government ought to be
decentralized.

It was decided that any such notification, appointing /

WP(C)1012/2007

Page No.5 of 6

authorising an Estate officer for action under the said Act, would be issued by
the concerned Ministry / Department. She submits that in view of this Office
Memorandum, the President's Secretariat had the authority to issue the
notification and it would be deemed to be a notice issued by the Central
Government.
6.

Having considered the submissions made by the counsel for the

parties, I am of the view that the position is now crystal clear that the
notification, in question, was issued by the Central Government. That being the
case. The provisions of Section 3 of the said Act were complied with. The
notification was properly authenticated by a Director in the President's
Secretariat in view of the said Authentication Rules 2002. It is therefore, clear
that Mr Nitin Wakankar was legitimately appointed as the Estate Officer and
continues to have the authority to operate and function as the Estate Officer in
respect of the properties mentioned in the notification which includes the
President's Estate in New Delhi.
In these circumstances, the writ petition is dismissed.
