PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

The appellants were the defendants and have

suffered two concurrent decrees against them. The finding of
the learned Trial Judge vide judgment and decree dated
19.5.2001 has been affirmed vide judgment and decree dated
18.8.2001 passed by the learned Appellate Judge.
2.

The courts below have returned a finding based on

RSA.No.137/01

page 1 of 3

documents and in particular the inspection report Ex.P-2 and
the demolition order Ex.P-3.
3.

The first respondent was the plaintiff.

He alleged

that the appellants were raising unauthorised construction on
public land at the rear of his plot bearing Municipal No.165,
Gautam Nagar, New Delhi.
4.

Through the medium of the land owning agency in

the area which was in charge of public lands namely DDA the
plaintiff successfully established that at the rear of his plot
there existed a public street and that the appellants were
raising unauthorized constructions thereon.

Through the

medium of Ex.P-2 and Ex.P-3 he successfully established
unauthorized construction on the public street being booked by
DDA and show-cause notice being issued to the appellants,
followed by a demolition order.

Needless to state, the

demolition order was not challenged by the appellants and it
attained finality.
5.

The findings returned by both Courts below is based

on an appreciation of evidence.
6.

During arguments today learned counsel for the

appellants has not been able to show to this Court whether any
material document has been ignored or a circumstance which has
been ignored by the Courts below. Only argument raised is that the
RSA.No.137/01

page 2 of 3

appellants were not given a fair opportunity to lead evidence. But in
what manner? The counsel has no answer. A feeble attempt was
made to urge that on 19.5.2000 the learned Trial Judge wrongly
closed the evidence of the appellant. In response to this submission
I have asked the counsel what happened on 19.5.2000.

The

response is that neither witnesses nor counsel was present and
defence evidence was closed. When asked was any application filed
to seek recall of the said order, counsel concedes none was filed.
7.

I have queried learned counsel for the appellants as to

what would be the effect of the demolition order passed by DDA
holding that the appellants were in unauthorized encroachment on a
public street and were raising an unauthorized construction,
requiring the same to be demolished; particularly the order having
attained finality.
8.

No answer is forthcoming.

9.

No substantial question of law arises for consideration in

the instant appeal.
10.

The appeal is dismissed.

11.

Cost to follow.
