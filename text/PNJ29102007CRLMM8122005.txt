PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)
Petitioners are aggrieved by

the

order

dated

7.6.2001 summoning them to face trial for offences under
Section 452/323/506/34/149 IPC.
2.

On 27.10.1997, the fateful day, at about 10.00 pm

an altercation had taken place.

This is an admitted fact

between the complainant and the petitioners.
3.

One Hukam Chand had died in the altercation.

Another party had been injured.
complaint

The injured lodged a

pursuant

whereto

FIR

No.397/97

under

Sections

302/307/323/34 IPC was registered.
4.

4 persons including one Dharmender, husband of

the complainant Meenakshi was also put up for trial as an
accused.
5.

Rival versions as to where and in what manner the

incident took place was projected by the prosecution and the
defence. Defence examined Meenakshi as DW-1.
6.

Vide judgment and order dated 20.11.2000, learned

Additional Sessions Judge convicted the accused persons which
included

Dharmender

husband

of

Meenakshi

for

having

committed an offence under Section 302 IPC as also under
Section 307 IPC.
7.

Needless to state, conviction was with the aid of

Section 34 IPC.
8.

The judgment and order dated 20.11.2000 passed

by the learned Additional Sessions Judge reveals that while
considering the testimony of Meenakshi, in para 42, recording
reasons in support of the finding, Meenakshi, DW-1 was held as
not to be a truthful witness.
9.

On merits, version projected by the defence was

held not to be believable. Version projected by the prosecution

was accepted by the learned Additional Sessions Judge.

10.

Meenakshi has invoked jurisdiction under Section

200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. She has filed a private
complaint against the petitioners.

Order dated 7.6.2001

summons the petitioners to face trial for offences under
Sections 452/323/506/34 IPC.
11.

I have perused the complaint filed by Meenakshi.

12.

I have also perused the testimony of Meenakshi

when she appeared as DW-1 at the Sessions' trial in FIR
No.397/97. The allegations in the complaint are pari materia
with her testimony when she deposed in examination-in-chief
before the learned Additional Sessions Judge.
13.

In my opinion, the petition has to succeed for the

simple reason, the version of the complainant on which the
private complaint is based was projected as a defence when
husband of the complainant and 3 other persons were put up
for trial as accused in FIR No.397/97.

Learned Additional

Sessions Judge disbelieved the version of the complainant.
14.

Petitioners cannot be prosecuted in relation to facts

sought to be proved by the complainant which facts have been
disbelieved by the superior court.
15.

Petition is allowed.

Order dated 7.6.2001 is

quashed.
