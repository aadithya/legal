1.

By my order dated 19.7.2007, I had allowed the

application filed by the defendant under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC and
rejected the plaint by holding that the plaintiff had failed to
disclose a cause of action against the defendants to seek the
relief of specific performance of the agreement to sell dated
19.12.2004 as novated or modified on 19.1.2005. The plaintiff has
now filed I.A. 10406/2007 under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC for
I.A. No.10406-407/2007 in C.S. (OS) No. 558/2006

review/recalling the aforesaid order.

Plaintiff's case in the review

is that even after the meeting dated 24.12.2005 the obligations of
the defendant, and the modalities

for fulfilling the same

remained the same as they were informed vide a letter dated
14.1.2005.

It has also been stated that the plaintiff never

intended the defendants to change (Sic charge) the suit property
in favour of ICICI Home Finance Ltd. in relation to the loan account
of the plaintiff before the defendants were paid the balance
consideration. The plaintiff has also averred that the 'stop
payment' instructions for the cheques dated 12.1.2005 for
Rs.13,75,000/- were issued and bank drafts for Rs.18,50,000/were prepared only because the plaintiff apprehended that the
defendants may not clear their loan of Rs.20,50,000/- in relation
to the property in question.

The plaintiff wanted to avoid the

situation wherein, even after making the payment of the entire
sale consideration to the defendants, she ultimately discovers
that the loan amount of Rs.20,50,000/- against the said property
in the name of the defendants had not been cleared. In such a
situation the plaintiff would have been deprived of a clear title to
the property in question despite having paid the entire sale
consideration.

The plaintiff, therefore, submits that there is an

error apparent on the face of the record warranting review of the
I.A. No.10406-407/2007 in C.S. (OS) No. 558/2006

order dated 19.7.2007.
2.

With regard to the averment that the modalities

agreed to in the meeting dated 24.12.2005 were the same as
they were informed vide their letter dated 14.1.2005,

I do not

find any averment to this effect in the plaint. Such modalities
even if agreed do during the meeting, not having been reduced in
the form of a document, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to
have pleaded what they were, or to have at least averred that
they remained the same as what was informed to the defendant
vide the letter dated 14.1.2005. The plaintiff cannot now in the
garb of a review application introduce averments of facts not
originally contained in the plaint.
3.

An order can be reviewed only if at least one of the

pre-conditions for the exercise of the power of Review laid down
in Order 47 Rule 1 CPC have been satisfied. I do not find any of
these

pre-conditions satisfied in this case. There is no error

apparent on the face of the record.
This application is therefore dismissed.
