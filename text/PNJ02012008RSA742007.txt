PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

On 20.7.2007 following substantial question of law

was framed:“When the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to try this
case, could it have decided all the issues on merits
and dismiss the suit?”
2.

Learned counsel for the parties concede that the

aforesaid question of law needs to be decided with reference to
the decision by the learned Trial Court

as affirmed by

the Appellate Court pertaining to issue Nos.(ii), (iv), (v) and
Page 1 of 4

(vi).
3.

For record I may note that issue No.(i) and (iii)

related to the valuation of the suit and the authority of the
person who instituted the suit. Said issues have been decided
in favour of the appellant.
4.

Issue Nos.(ii), (iv), (v) and (vi) read as under:“(ii) Whether the suit is not triable by this Court?
(iv)

(v)

Whether the defendant is in possession of
property in dispute continuously for his own
right for more than 35 years to the knowledge
of the plaintiff? If so to what effect?

(vi)

5.

Whether the suit is barred under the provisions
of Delhi Rent Control Act and this Court has no
jurisdiction?

Whether the defendant is in unauthorized
occupation of property in dispute?”
To appreciate the issues it needs to be noted that

case of the appellant who sought recovery of possession of the
suit property was that it had let out the property in question to
one Siri Chand who in turn had sublet the same to the
respondent and that since Siri Chand had died, appellant was
entitled to eject the respondent from the suit property for the
reason his possession was akin to that of a trespasser.
6.

In other words, case of the appellant was that

an unauthorized occupant is liable to be ejected in a civil

Page 2 of 4

action.
7.

Respondent took the plea that he was a direct

tenant under the appellant and to the knowledge of the
appellant was in occupation of the premises for over 35 years.
According to the respondent he was a tenant under the
appellant at a rent much less than Rs.3,500/- per month and
since Delhi Rent Control Act 1957 applied to the area no court
can order ejectment save and except the Court of the Rent
Controller.
8.

The question raised by the respondent in defence

required evidence to be led. Needless to state the bar to the
jurisdiction of the Civil Court created by the Delhi Rent Control
Act would have come into force only when the respondent
proved that he was a tenant under the appellant and was not a
sub-lettee under Siri Chand and that the rent was less than
Rs.3,500/- per month.
9.

Thus, decision on issues Nos.(v) and (vi) had to be

on facts. Depending upon the decision on the said issues was
the consequential decision on issues No.(ii) and (iv).
10.

I could put the matter differently.

Had the issue

been framed: “Whether in view of the defence taken in the
written statement was the suit triable by the Court in view of
the provisions of the Delhi Rent Control Act?”, the decision
Page 3 of 4

would have embraced the wider issue as framed.
11.

Merely because the wider issue has been split up

into distinct issues does not mean that the Court exceeded its
jurisdiction in deciding the issues as framed.
12.

I repeat, the decision on the question whether the

defence

successfully

established

a

direct

landlord-tenant

relationship and the rent paid being less than Rs.3,500/- was
the core decision.
13.

On the evidence led, finding of fact has been

returned that the respondent was a tenant under the appellant
and

the

rent

originally

fixed

was

Rs.31.44

per

month

subsequently enhanced to Rs.47.16 per month.
14.

The appeal is dismissed.
