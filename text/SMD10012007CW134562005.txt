JUDGMENT

1.

This writ petition seeks a writ of mandamus to quash the

impugned notice dated 16.5.2005 issued by Veterinary Services
Department, Municipal Corporation of Delhi,('MCD') Respondent No.2
herein which reads as under:

“Closure Notice U/S 407 (2),417,423 of DMC ACT 1957

Whereas you are carrying on the trade of storage and
salting of skin (hide) at premises no. 11027 Gali Pipal Wali,
Motia Khan without Municipal Trade License.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case titled
Buffalo Traders Association v. UOI and others in I.A. No 19
in CA No. 3769/96 has directed MCD that no activity of
W.P.(C) 13456/2005

page 1 of 10

storage and salting of skin shall be carried out within the
area of Idgah, without proper License and if such activity is
carried out, MCD will stop it.

I, Dr.Sunil Ranga VO/S.P.Zone MCD order you, to
close down the trade of storage and salting of skin (hide) at
above mentioned premises within 72 hours from the receipt
of this notice, failing which further legal action will be
initiated including sealing of the premises without any
further notice.”

2.

This writ petition also seeks issuance of writ of mandamus to the

Respondents to deseal the premises No.11027/B Motia Khan, New Delhi
110055 of Modern Overseas (P) Ltd. of which the petitioner is Director.

3.

The facts leading to the filing of the petition are that the

petitioner was dealing in raw hides and skins and for the purposes of
storing and salting of skins was issued a licence, which was admittedly
renewed only up to 3.8.2001.

4.

It is also not in dispute that the activity of skinning of the hides of

dead animals and salting, storing and curing the skins is incidental to
the

activity

of

slaughtering

of

animals.

In

Delhi

the

major

slaughterhouse (abattoir) is at Idgah and the trades dealing in skins and
hides were located in the Motia Khan and Quasavvpura areas near the
Idgah slaughterhouse.

On account of the environmental problems

caused by the Idgah abattoir, certain directions came to be passed by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a public interest litigation in Buffalo

Traders Welfare Association v. Union of India

(Civil Appeal

No.3769/1996) and this Court in W.P.(C) No. 2802/2004 (Mohd.

Amjad v. Union of India) pursuant to which a total of 58 godowns of
W.P.(C) 13456/2005

page 2 of 10

skins and hides traders in the area of Motia Khan and Quasavvpura
were sealed.

5.

As a result of the said intervention by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court, the MCD proposed to shift the entire activity of slaughtering of
animals from Idgah and it was proposed that a modern slaughterhouse
would be constructed at Ghazipur by July, 2006. An affidavit was filed in
November,

2004

in

the

Hon'ble

Supreme

Court

seeking

the

enhancement of the capacity of the modern abattoir at Ghazipur from
2500 to 5,000 animals.

In the said affidavit, as regards the dealers

trading in skins and hides, it was stated as under:

“The

corporation

would

be

in

a

position

to

make

arrangements for godowns for them in Ghazipur subject to
their making payment for the space provided to them and
their agreeing to pay the rent fixed by the Corporation from
time to time.

This would require construction of new

godowns at slaughter house site ....”

6.

By an order dated 30.11.2004, in regard to this specific prayer,

the Hon'ble Supreme Court directed as under:

“The application for clarification is filed by the persons who are
involved in the trade of skin and hide of animals. They contend
that it is a trade incidental to slaughtering of buffaloes and hence,
they have a right to carry on the said trade in the area where
slaughtering of the buffaloes is presently being permitted, and
thereafter at the place where the said slaughtering would be
relocated. The MCD in its reply filed to this application has stated
that the activities of skinning the hide of dead animals or curing
the same is incidental to legally permitted activity of slaughtering
of the animals. To that extent, they have no objection to this trade
W.P.(C) 13456/2005

page 3 of 10

being conducted in the vicinity of the slaughterhouse. In the said
view of the matter this application is allowed and the salting and
storage of skins of legally slaughtered animals near the present
slaughterhouse is permitted until the same is shifted.

However

we make it clear that this permission is confined only to legally
slaughtered animals and the authorities concerned are free to
prevent and if necessary take such legal action in regard to the
people who indulge in illegal slaughtering as well as those people
who indulge in salting and storing of skins of such illegally
slaughtered animals.”

7.

At the time of passing of the above Order, the Hon'ble Supreme

Court, had not been informed that many of the dealers trading in hides
and skins, like the petitioner herein, had been operating, without valid
licence. Accordingly on 8.4.2005, the Hon'ble Supreme Court made the
following further order in I.A. No.19 in CA No.3769/1996 (Buffalo

Traders Welfare Association v. Union of India) :
“By our order dated 30th November, 2004 we permitted the
applicants in Buffalo Traders Welfare Association in I.A.
No.19 of 2004 to carry on trade of skinning and salting of
skin of legally slaughtered animals withing the Idgah area
under the impression that these Traders had valid licences
from MCD to carry on the said trade. We are now informed
that these Traders do not have any licence to carry on this
trade.

Therefore, we will have to modify our order dated

30.11.2004. We direct that no such activity of skinning and
salting shall be carried on by any person without a proper
licence for that purpose as required under law and under
the conditions of the licence. If the applicants are entitled
to do the trade they shall make the necessary applications to
the MCD for obtaining the licences and if such applications
are made the MCD will consider the same on merits and in
accordance with law. Until such licence is obtained no such
activity shall be carried on within the area of Idgah, if such
activity is carried out, MCD will stop the same forthwith.”
W.P.(C) 13456/2005

8.

It was consequent upon the above order dated 8.4.2005, that the

notice dated 16.5.2005 impugned in the present petition came to be
issued to the petitioner. According to the MCD, the petitioner, who was
also a person whose licence had already expired way back on 3.8.2001,
applied for the renewal of his trade licence on 3.5.2005 at the Citizen
Service Bureau, SP Zone with the processing fee of Rs.250/-. This
application was forwarded by the said Citizen Service Bureau to the
Veterinary Officer of the MCD. However, the petitioner disputes that it
applied for renewal. On the other hand, it is contended that after the
issuance of the aforementioned closure notice dated 16.5.2005, the
petitioner represented orally to the Respondent on 16.5.2005 and
30.5.2005. According to the petitioner, without waiting for a response
to the oral representations, the petitioner deposited the trade licence
fee along with arrears of late fees on 1.6.2005 with the Citizen Service
Bureau. It appears that on receiving the late fees, a receipt was issued
in form G8 A on 1.6.2005, which stated that it is a computerised receipt
which

PVT. L. TRADE RNWL: If info. found false, Action will be taken as per
DMC Act.”

9.

It is stated by the Respondent No.2 Department, that in the

meanwhile, it rejected the petitioner's application for renewal of its
licence on 22.6.2005 on the ground that “no commercial activity of
storing and skinning can be carried out in a residential area as the
trade being pollutant.” It is stated that the rejection letter was sent to
W.P.(C) 13456/2005

page 5 of 10

the petitioner on 24.6.2005, while this is disputed by the petitioner,
what is not is that the petitioner's premises was sealed on 2.8.2005.

10.

The present writ petition was filed on 22.8.2005 and on 29.8.2005

notice was directed to be issued. The records were asked to be
produced. At the hearing on 6.9.2005, MCD produced the records and
after perusing the same this Court passed the following order:

“+WP(C) Nos. 13456/2005 & 13458/2005
*
Record has been produced by counsel for MCD.
Counsel states that the procedure prescribed and followed
for renewal of licence commences with the submission of
requisite forms, these being processed and orders passed on
the file to renew the licence, followed by receipt of the
licence fee.

Counsel states that in the present case the

petitioner made online payment of the licence fee evidenced
by Annexure P.3 itself.

Counsel states that at no point of

time any application was received and question of the same
being processed and decision taken to renew the licence
does not arise.

Counsel further states that in view of the

directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a public
interest litigation, in compliance with orders passed MCD is
in the process of enforcing the directives of the Supreme
Court.

Let a counter affidavit be filed bringing on record the
stand of MCD. Needful be done within 10 days. Rejoinder
be filed within 3 days thereafter.
List on 26.9.2005.”

11.

In its counter affidavit filed on 23.9.2005, the Respondent No.2

herein pointed out that the action taken to seal the premises of the
petitioner, consequent upon the closure notice, was perfectly valid and
W.P.(C) 13456/2005

page 6 of 10

was by way of implementation of the directives of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in its order dated 8.4.2005. It was pointed out by the Respondent
No.2 that the petitioner had deposited the trade licence fees along with
arrears on 1.6.2005 “without waiting for the approval of the Veterinary
Department.” It was further pointed out by Respondent No.2 as under:

“The license of the Petitioner as claimed by the Petitioner is not
renewed as per the law. Merely, depositing the processing fees
and trade license renewal fees does not give the right to the
Petitioner to carry on the pollutant trade from residential area. It
is to mention herein that the computerised receipt issued to the
Petitioner

by

Citizen Service

Bureau

has

a

rider

that

if

information found is false, action will be taken as per the DMC
Act.”

12.

The petitioner filed a rejoinder maintaining that the petitioner's

licence had in fact been renewed on 1.6.2005 and was valid up to
31.3.2006 and therefore the premises could not have been sealed. It
was also contended that Motia Khan falls under Zone B, which is a
special area.

As per the Master Plan of Delhi mixed land use is

permitted and therefore a non-residential activity like storing of skins
and hides could be carried on even in residential premises.

13.

It is submitted by Mr. Bharat Bhushan Bhatia, learned counsel for

the petitioner that by depositing the licence fee along with the arrears,
the petitioner had been granted a renewal of the licence up to
31.3.2006 and therefore it is incorrect to state that the petitioner was
carrying on the activity of storing hides and skins without a valid
licence. In that view of the matter, the petitioner was not in violation of
order dated 8.4.2005 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the premises

W.P.(C) 13456/2005

page 7 of 10

ought not have been sealed. In reply it is pointed out by Mr.Shivinder
Chopra, learned Advocate for the MCD that the petitioner was fully
aware that his licence had already expired in August, 2001 itself. The
mere deposit of licence fee, cannot tantamount to renewal of licence
and what was issued was only a computerised receipt which was always
subject to the verification and approval of the Veterinary Department.
In that view of the matter it was stated that there was no merit in the
writ petition.

14.

The narration of facts hereinabove reveals that the petitioner

indeed had no valid licence beyond 3.8.2001. It is a matter of concern
that persons like the petitioner were permitted by the Respondents to
continue carrying on the activity of dealing in raw hides and skins,
without a valid licence beyond the said date.

It was only after the

Hon'ble Supreme Court ordered on 8.4.2005 specifically directed that
no such activity would be carried on without a proper licence, that both
the petitioner and the MCD got activated from their complacence. The
petitioner simply went and deposited the arrears of licence fee on
1.6.2005, without any prior approval of the MCD.

15.

Although the fact whether the petitioner applied for renewal of its

licence is not evident, this much is clear that the petitioner did not
possess a valid licence after 3.8.2001.

16.

There is merit in the submission of the MCD that by merely

depositing the arrears of late fees at the Citizen Service Bureau on
1.6.2005, the petitioner cannot claim that his licence was renewed.
This is particularly so since the Hon'ble Supreme Court has been
W.P.(C) 13456/2005

page 8 of 10

monitoring the situation as is evident from its orders dated 30.11.2004
and 3.4.2005 (extracted above). The grant of license would, therefore,
require application of mind by the Respondent to the facts and
circumstances and particularly to the aspect of environmental pollution.
In other words, in this type of a case the renewal cannot be said to be
automatic by the mere deposit of arrears of late fees. The question of
any mixed land use being permitted by the Master Plan does not arise
when a decision has already been taken to shift the abattoir itself and
the

entire shifting is being monitored under the directions of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court. In the circumstances, the explanation by MCD
that the receipt issued on 1.6.2005 to the petitioner for the deposit of
arrears of the late fee did not in the facts and circumstances of the
present case tantamount to an automatic renewal of licence, is a
reasonable

and

valid

explanation and

merits acceptance.

The

submission of the petitioner to the contrary is hereby rejected.

17.

In view of the above facts and circumstances, the closure notice

dated 16.5.2005 issued by the Respondent, which was consequent upon
the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, is valid and does not call for
an interference. The sealing of the petitioner's premises on 2.8.2005
was also consequential upon the aforementioned closure notice and
since the petitioner's licence already stood expired on 3.8.2001, no fault
can be found with the sealing of the premises in question.

18.

Mr. Bhatia, finally submitted that since the petitioner has been in

this trade since 1970, he should, in equity, be given an alternative
space at Ghazipur in or around the modern abattoir that would become
operational there. As regards this prayer, the only direction that can be
W.P.(C) 13456/2005

page 9 of 10

given is that it would be open to the petitioner to make an application
for grant of a licence for dealing in skins and hides in the Ghazipur area
in accordance with the procedure prescribed, and as and when so made
this application would be dealt with by the Respondent in accordance
with law.

19.

With the above observations, the writ petition is dismissed with

no orders as to costs. The application stands disposed of.
