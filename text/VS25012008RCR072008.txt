This petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India

has been preferred against the order passed by the Additional Rent
Control Tribunal,Delhi in RCA No.107/2005 dated 15.10.2007 whereby
the learned Additional Rent Control Tribunal has dismissed the appeal

RCR 7/2008

page 1 of 7

filed by the petitioner-tenant against the order of eviction passed by
the learned Additional Rent Controller, Delhi dated 4.2.2005 in eviction
petition bearing number E-194/2002 on the ground of misuser of the
tenanted premises by the petitioner-tenant.
2.

Admittedly, the respondent is the landlady of premises

bearing No.A-35, Transit Camp, Govindpuri, New Delhi and the
petitioner was the tenant on a monthly rent of Rs.2000/- exclusive of
water and electricity charges.

The case of the respondent/landlady

was that the premises were let out for residential purpose and that the
petitioner had, after the expiry of the contractual tenancy which was
for a period of 11 months, started using the same for a commercial
purpose of running a denting and painting workshop of vehicles. The
respondent relied on a rent agreement dated 20.5.1998 Ex.PW-1/1
which was in two pages. The first page was on a stamp paper of Rs.5
and the second page is typed on a plain sheet.

Clause 3 of the rent

agreement Ex.PW-1/1 stipulates the purpose of letting as residential.
This clause is contained on the first page of the Agreement Ex.PW-1/1
which is Non Judicial Stamp paper of Rs.5/-.
3.

The contention of the petitioner was that an agreement

was got executed by the respondent/landlady by use of coercion on
20.5.1998.

At that time the petitioner was already a tenant in the

premises and that in that agreement, the purpose of letting was
recorded as commercial and he was using the premises for commercial

RCR 7/2008

page 2 of 7

purposes.

However, the agreement produced by the respondent/

landlady Ex.PW-1/1 was not

the one signed by the tenant on

20.05.1998 and the original agreement had been held back, wherein
the purpose of letting had been recorded as commercial. Though the
date of the agreement is shown as 20.5.1998, it is not disputed by the
respondent/landlady that the date mentioned on the stamp paper on
its reverse is 21.5.1998. The first page of the agreement Ex.PW-1/1
does not bear the signature of the petitioner/tenant.

The petitioner

disputes his signature on the second page which is the only page
signed by the parties. The courts below have rejected the contention
of the petitioner that since the stamp paper bears the date 21.5.1998
whereas the agreement bears the date 20.5.1998, it is proved that the
said agreement is forged and fabricated.

The reasoning given by the

Tribunal while rejecting this argument reads as follows:
“Possibility of typing mistake while typing the first
page wherein, the date of execution has been given as
20.5.1998 on the stamp paper which was purchased
on 21.5.98 can not be ruled out. It is also not unusual
that the date of execution of an agreement on an
earlier date may also be reflected in an agreement
executed on subsequently. “
4.

Submission of learned counsel for the petitioner is that it

was not the case of the respondent/landlady that

though the

agreement was executed on a subsequent date, it was ante dated as
20.5.1998.

In fact the positive case of the respondent/landlady was

that the agreement was executed on 20.5.1998 itself.

For this the

RCR 7/2008

page 3 of 7

petitioner referred to the averment made by the respondent/landlady
in an earlier suit filed by her for seeking relief of

mandatory and

permanent injunction against the petitioner/tenant, wherein the
respondent/landlady made the following averments: “3.
That the defendant entered into a rent
agreement with the plaintiff on 20.5.1998 and
took the premises in dispute on rent at the
monthly rent of Rs.2,000/- exclusive of electricity
and water charges.
4.
The defendant took the premises w.e.f.
20.5.1998 and the premises was let out to the
defendant only for residential purpose.”
5.

He further submits that the same averment has been

repeated in the eviction petition.
6.

From the aforesaid it is evident that positive case of the

respondent/landlady was that rent agreement was

executed on

20.5.1998 itself. The stamp paper of the agreement produced by the
respondent/landlady

admittedly

bears

the

date

21.5.1998.

Consequently, the reasoning given by the learned Tribunal as aforesaid
cannot be accepted, since it was not the respondent's case that the
agreement was executed subsequent to 20.5.1998, though it was
dated 20.5.1998.

The stand of the respondent/landlady is that the

stamp paper whereon the agreement was executed on 20.5.1998 was
procured and produced by the petitioner/tenant, and the landlady is
not aware how a stamp paper with that date could have been procured
on 20.5.1998 or earlier.

RCR 7/2008

If that was the explanation of the

page 4 of 7

respondent/landlady, it was for the respondent to establish on record
that stamp paper was in fact procured on or before 20.5.1998 and not
on

21.5.1998,

though

its

date

of

purchase

was

recorded

as

21.05.1998. No evidence has been led by the respondent in support of
this stand. Consequently , in my view Ex.PW1/1 could not have been
taken as the basis to conclude that the purpose of letting was
residential.
7.

The petitioner has also not produced any agreement to

show that the purpose of

letting was commercial.

Therefore, one

would have to examine whether the eviction order & appellate order
can be sustained on the basis of other independent evidence. I find
that the learned

Rent Control Tribunal while passing the impugned

order has not merely relied on Ex.PW1/1 and, even apart from that
evidence, he has furnished sufficient reasons to sustain the conclusion
that the purpose of letting was residential and not commercial.

It

appears that the Tribunal during the course of its proceedings gave
another opportunity to the petitioner to place on record any document
which may

establish that the suit premises was used by him for

commercial purpose prior to 20.5.1998, in view of the petitioner's
stand that he was a tenant in the suit premises prior to the said date
and right from the inception

of the tenancy he had been using the

property for commercial purpose.

However, the petitioner

failed to

produce any such document. Surely, had there been any truth in the

RCR 7/2008

page 5 of 7

claim of the petitioner that the premises was being used for
commercial purposes even prior to 20.05.1998, he would have
produced some evidence in support of the same.

The failure and

inability of the petitioner to produce any evidence in this respect is
telling. Commercial user of a premises, carried out in broad daylight
cannot remain unnoticed and triggers various other developments.
Firstly, there would either be a licence under the Shops and
Establishments Act, or a challan by the MCD.

The electricity/water

meter would either be commercial, or would have misuser charges
levied, if a residential meter installed in the premises is being used for
commercial purposes. There would be entries made in the inspection
register by the MCD maintained for property tax assessment. There
would be assessments of property tax as a commercial property.
Then, there would be bills/invoices for purchase of raw materials, and
those raised on the clients/customers. There would be customers who
would have got their vehicles repaired by the petitioner at the
workshop in the premises. If the petitioner is an income tax assessee,
there would be income tax returns. There could be sales tax returns,
and other statutory records pertaining to the workers employed by the
petitioner. There might also be letterheads/visiting cards showing the
address of the workshop as that of the premises. None of these was
produced.

This leads me to infer that the eventual finding of the

Tribunal that the purpose of letting was not commercial is correct and

RCR 7/2008

page 6 of 7

does not call for interference in these proceedings. The Tribunal also
takes note of the fact that the premises in question was allotted in
lieu of demolition of a jhuggi as a part of resettlement scheme.
Therefore, by its very nature, the suit premises was a residential
property. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that no evidence
was led on this aspect by the respondent/landlady. While that may be
the case, it is equally true that even the petitioner

did not led any

evidence to show that the premises could be used

for commercial

purpose under the terms of allotment. The Tribunal observed, and in
my view rightly so, that there was nothing on record to establish the
plea of the petitioner that the suit premises was let out for commercial
purpose. Since the petitioner had not stopped the misuser despite the
service of the notice, Ex.PW1/7, he was rightly held to be liable for
eviction.
8.
Dismissed.

In view of the aforesaid, I find no merit in the petition.
However, the eviction order shall not be executed for a

period of one month from today.
