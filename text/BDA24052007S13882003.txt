BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J
1.
In the plaint, the plaintiff has, inter alia, contended that the agreement
between the plaintiff and the defendant No.1 dated 07.09.1983 was no
agreement at all and that no such agreement existed. It was further contended
by the plaintiff that, in any event, the said agreement dated 07.09.1983 has been
terminated by a letter dated 14.07.2003. The reasons for termination are that
the defendant allegedly did not account for 35 titles; there was alleged
concealment of true and complete figures relating to publishing, printing,
reprinting and sales of titles; there was an alleged breach of fiduciary duty and
breach of trust on the part of the defendants; there was alleged avoidance of
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 1 of 40

payment of royalty by the defendant No.1 to the plaintiff; there was alleged
misappropriation of money by the defendant; and there was alleged suppression
/ misrepresentation and fraud on the part of the defendants. The plaintiff, inter
alia, sought a mandatory injunction, commanding the rendition of true and
faithful accounts. Alternatively, a direction was sought for initiation of an
inquiry into the list of titles / books in which the plaintiff was the owner of the
copyright.

A permanent and perpetual injunction was also sought for

restraining the defendants from printing, reprinting or publishing any of the
books or titles of which the plaintiff or its associates or subsidiaries were the
owners of the copyright. A similar injunction was sought for marketing and
sale of any of the books in which the plaintiff or its associates or subsidiaries
held copyrights.

A permanent injunction was also sought restraining the

defendant No.1 (Prentice Hall India) from using the name “Prentice-Hall” or
“P-H” as part of its name. Other associative reliefs were also sought.

2.

In the present application (IA No.7219/2003), the plaintiff seeks the

following reliefs:“(a)

An ex parte ad interim temporary injunction, in favour of the
Plaintiff / Applicant and against the Defendant/Respondent
No.1 Company restraining the Defendant / Respondent No.1
company from in any manner printing / reprinting or
publishing and / or marketing and selling any of the books or
titles of which the plaintiff / applicant or its associates or
subsidiaries are the owner of the copyright and/or have a
right in respect thereof;

whatsoever;

3.

Ad-interim reliefs in terms of prayers (a) to (e) above;
For cost.”

The key issues which arise in this application are—whether the

purported agreement dated 07.09.1983 was in existence ? If such an agreement
is found to be in existence, whether the same had been validly terminated by the
letter dated 14.07.2003 ? The related issue is whether the termination, if bad in
law, entitled the defendants only to damages or to continue with the
arrangement under the agreement ?

4.

Dr A.M. Singhvi, the learned senior counsel, who appeared on behalf of

the plaintiff, submitted that on 06.06.1963, Prentice-Hall Inc. (now known as
Pearson Education Inc.—the plaintiff herein) had entered into a collaboration
agreement with the defendant No.1 (Prentice-Hall of India Pvt. Ltd.) wherein
the plaintiff had agreed to grant to the defendant No.1 exclusive rights to print,
reprint, publish and sell in India and to export from India, books, the particulars
of which were set out in the schedule attached to the collaboration agreement.

5.

In 1973, the collaboration agreement was renewed for a further period of

10 years and the Government approval was also sought. According to Dr
Singhvi, the plaintiff, in view of the impending introduction of compulsory

IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 4 of 40

licencing provisions into the Indian Copyright Law, reviewed its existing policy
of granting distribution rights to the defendant No.1 and, accordingly, both the
plaintiff and the defendant No.1 opted not to further renew the collaboration
agreement. On 17.01.1983, a letter was written by Mr Leo Albert, VicePresident of the plaintiff to defendant No.2 (Mr Asoke K. Ghosh). In the said
letter, it was, inter alia, indicated by the said Mr Leo Albert that the
collaboration would expire in June, 1983.

The letter indicates that the

defendant No.2 had been advised by the plaintiff's legal counsel that it may not
be necessary to apply for a renewal collaboration. It was indicated that some of
the major reasons why the Government of India required a collaboration
agreement in the past no longer existed.

Furthermore, in the light of the

impending compulsory licencing, which was about to be introduced by the
Government of India, the plaintiff felt that it would be hard-pressed to prove
that a collaboration renewal is to the advantage of the Government.

6.

In response to this letter, Mr Asoke K. Ghosh (defendant No.2) sent a

letter to the said Mr Leo Albert on 11.03.1983 which essentially accords with
the sentiments expressed by Mr Albert in his letter dated 17.01.1983. With
regard to collaboration renewal, Mr Asoke K. Ghosh's letter was to the effect:“2.
Collaboration Renewal: Mr. Dadachanji is of the view that
there is no need for submitting an application for renewal of
collaboration. Foreign Company and non-resident individuals have
the permission of the Reserve Bank of India to hold shares in
Prentice-Hall of India and this permission is not time bound.
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 5 of 40

Further, now there is no restriction by the Reserve Bank of India for
allowing remittance of royalty on reprints of books of scientific,
technical and educational nature.”

7.

Continuing the sequence of events, Dr Singhvi drew the attention of this

court to a letter dated 24.03.1983 which was written by Mr Leo Albert to Mr
Asoke K. Ghosh (defendant No.2) wherein the second point read as under:“(2)

8.

We will not apply for renewal of a collaboration.”

Dr Singhvi submitted that this correspondence clearly indicates that the

plaintiff and the defendant No.1 as also the defendant No.2 did not contemplate
renewal of the collaboration agreement. This fact, therefore, according to him,
casts serious doubts on the existence of the agreement dated 07.09.1983 which
is said to have been entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant No.1.
The terms of the purported agreement dated 07.09.1983 are relevant and
germane to the discussion and, therefore, are being reproduced hereinbelow:“AGREEMENT
This Agreement made this 7th day of September, 1983 between
PRENTICE HALL INC. a corporation organised and existing

Dr Singhvi then referred to the letter dated 06.10.1983 written by Mr

Asoke K. Ghosh, the defendant No.2, to Mr Leo Albert of the plaintiff. In this
letter, it is noted that in the absence of the collaboration agreement, the plaintiff
and the defendant No.1 ought to have obtained a certificate from the plaintiff
stating that the defendant No.1 had exclusive reprinting rights for reprinting the
plaintiff's publications in India. It was felt that this certificate would be given
to concerned authorities in order to prevent issuance of the compulsory licence
as well as to prevent any piracy. It was noted that Mr Dadachanji had drafted
the certificate which was enclosed with the letter. The plaintiff had directed
that the same be typed on the letter head of the defendant No.1 and be signed

IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

and sent to the plaintiff. That certificate was a draft. It took its final form as

Dr Singhvi submitted that the defendants' case was founded upon the

purported agreement of 07.09.1983. He submitted that there is no mention of
this

purported

agreement

of

07.09.1983

in

any

contemporaneous

correspondence. The correspondence prior to 07.09.1983, referred to above,
indicates that the plaintiff and the defendant No.1 were not interested in
continuing the collaboration agreement. The correspondence after 07.09.1983
also had no reference whatsoever to the purported agreement of 07.09.1983.

IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 9 of 40

11.

Dr Singhvi submitted that the purported agreement of 07.09.1983

granted such extensive rights to the defendant No.1 that it was legitimate to
assume that the plaintiff could not have entered into such an agreement. He
submitted that, in any event, clause 7 of the purported agreement entitled the
plaintiff to terminate the same if the defendant No.1 committed breach of any
terms or conditions and failed to remedy the breach within 30 days of receipt of
a written notice from the plaintiff. He submitted that the breaches committed
by the defendant No.1 in the present case were of such a fundamental nature
and related to the basics of faith and trust that there was no possibility of the
defendant No.1 remedying the same and, therefore, the question of giving a
notice in writing to the defendant No.1 requiring it to remedy the breaches, did
not at all arise.

12.

Dr. Singhvi then referred to the letter from Mr Leo Albert to Mr Don

Schaefer (both of the plaintiff company) with a copy to Mr Asoke K. Ghosh of
the defendant No.1 company. He submitted that this letter also had no mention
of the purported agreement of 07.09.1983.

He then submitted that on

12.04.1984, the mark “Prentice Hall” was registered in favour of the plaintiff in
India under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 in Class 16 in respect
of books, printed matter etc. Thereafter, it was submitted that the plaintiff and
the defendant No.1 entered into individual title agreements from time to time.
These agreements were in respect of individual titles / editions and the rights
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 10 of 40

granted under those agreements were specific and limited to those agreements
alone. In 1998-99, Prentice Hall Inc. was taken over by the Pearson Group and
the name of the plaintiff was changed from “Prentice Hall Inc.” to “Pearson
Education Inc.”. On behalf of the plaintiff, it is stated that after the change in
the management of the plaintiff company, the purported agreement of
07.09.1983 was made available by the defendant No.2 (Mr Asoke K. Ghosh) to
the plaintiff. In January, 2000, the defendant No.1 filed a suit (Original Suit
No.200/2000 [renumbered as CS(OS) 1339/2004] before this court seeking a
declaration that the defendant No.1 was the exclusive licencee of the plaintiff
for the territory of India. It was also claimed by the defendant No.1 in the said
suit that the agreement dated 07.09.1983 had been violated. An injunction had
been sought by the defendant No.1 against the plaintiff's act of restraining it
from publishing, printing, importing titles into India. Essentially, this suit could
be regarded as one for specific performance of the purported agreement dated
07.09.1983.

13.

In February, 2000, the plaintiff filed Original Suit No.716/2000 (later on

renumbered as CS(OS) 1340/2004) essentially seeking a declaration that the
agreement dated 07.09.1983 was a nullity. Interim applications in both the suits
were disposed of by Sikri, J by a common order on 10.05.2002. By virtue of
the said order dated 10.05.2002, both the plaintiff and the defendant No.1 have
been permitted to publish books subject to the terms of accounts and of
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 11 of 40

depositing 10% of the sale proceeds. Appeals have been preferred from the
said order dated 10.05.2002 which are pending. Those appeals are numbered as
FAO(OS) Nos.242/2002, 243/2002 and 252/2002. The following observations
made in the order passed by Sikri, J on 10.05.2002 are relevant:“However, if the matter was to be decided on the basis of this
agreement alone, it would not have posed any problem. But the
fact remains that the agreement has been worked out for number
of years and in the process the parties have acted in a particular
manner. This course of conduct may be relevant for the purpose
of ascertaining as to how the parties understood and acted on this
agreement.
The important question which falls for consideration is as
to whether Agreement dated 7.9.1983 is an Agreement which
could be worked out and enforced without entering into individual
agreements. Fact remains that individual agreements were entered
into each time, which granting copyrights in respect of a particular
book.
The aforesaid question posed can be answered by applying
the following test:
Whether Agreement of 1983 is enforceable by itself i.e. the
plaintiff could enforce this Agreement even if individual
agreement were not entered into in respect of each separate book?
xxxx

xxxx

xxxx

xxxx

xxxx

Therefore, although the extreme position adopted by either
party may not be correct and although Agreement dated 7.9.1983
may be an agreement by which the defendant no.1 granted certain
rights to the plaintiff, the fact remains that the parties acted with
the understanding that without signing an individual agreement in
respect of each book, it was not possible to work out 1983
Agreement. It is because in these individual agreements parties
have agreed upon various other terms and conditions on which
each book in which copyright is given by such specific agreement
is to be printed, published and sold. The parties had adopted this
course of action for number of years. Therefore, there may be
some force in the argument of the defendants that parties
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 12 of 40

contemplated separate agreements whereby detailed terms and
conditions on which each book is to be published were to be
agreed upon.
xxxx

No doubt the court would look into the “comparative
strength” of the case of each party in a matter like this. However,
there is a dispute as to how the Agreement dated 7.9.1983 was to
be worked out. Taking into consideration the conduct of the
parties and particularly the fact that individual agreements were
entered into, the defence of the defendants seems plausible and
cannot be brushed aside lightly. The matter would be thrashed out
in evidence. Thus one can approach the issue after taking into
consideration the admitted position that has emerged.
Undisputed fact is that Defendant No.1 is the owner of the
publications in question in which the plaintiff is seeking to claim
copyright without any individual agreements having been entered
into. Therefore, it is the case of owner versus so called assignee
of the copyright. Since title of the defendant No.1 is not in
dispute and on the other hand copyright of the plaintiff in such
publications is in dispute, the grant of ad interim injunction in
favour of the plaintiff at this stage would mean decreeing the suit
itself. When this is seen in the context that in the past, parties
have entered into specific agreements in respect of each book and
it is only on the strength of such specific agreements that the
plaintiff was able to publish and print the books, can the plaintiff
be granted injunction of the nature prayed for ? Answer has to be
in the negative. Grant of such an injunction would mean
restraining the defendant NO.1 from getting its books printed,
sold etc. through any other person except the plaintiff. In other
words that would mean mandating the defendant No.1 to enter
into specific agreements in respect of each such book with the
plaintiff thereby allowing the plaintiff alone to publish, print and
sell such books. Unless the parties are at ad idem and are able to
agree upon various terms and conditions on which specific
agreements are entered into between the parties in the past, such a
mandatory injunction cannot be issued by the Court at this
interlocutory stage. Even the court cannot suggest the terms and
conditions on which a specific agreement is to be entered. It is for
the parties to agree upon such terms and conditions.

IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 13 of 40

The interest of the plaintiff can be adequately safeguarded
by imposing certain conditions upon the defendant No.1 relating
to maintenance of accounts etc. The balance of convenience is
also, therefore, in favour of the defendant No.1. What would be
the position if ultimately court comes to the conclusion that
Agreement dated 7.9.1983 could not be enforced without specific
agreements and the suit of the plaintiff is dismissed? Grant of
injunction at this stage, if the suit of the plaintiff is ultimately
dismissed, would cause an irreversible situation for the defendant
No.1. On the other hand if the plaintiff ultimately succeeds the
plaintiff shall be adequately compensated and order to that effect
can be passed. The defendant No.1 being the owner of the
publications in question and plaintiff's rights are under cloud,
even on the touchstone of “comparative strength” of the case, it is
the defendant No.1 who would succeed insofar as question of
interim injunction is concerned.
xxxx

In view of the aforesaid discussion relating to Agreement
dated 7.9.1983, it cannot be said that it is a case where no rights
have accrued in favour of Indian company in respect of the
publications already undertaken.
The entire thrust in the
application is that Agreement dated 7.9.1983 was only in the
nature of a Memorandum of Understanding and in any case null
and void being against the public policy etc. It is already
observed hereinabove that prima facie these contentions of the
foreign company are not valid. Therefore, it would not be
appropriate to grant them any injunction of the aforesaid nature in
favour of foreign company as well. The Indian company had
printed/ published various books not only on the basis of
Agreement dated 7.9.1983 but also when the foreign company had
signed individual agreement in respect of these book. It may also
be mentioned that the Indian company was incorporated in
collaboration with the foreign company which is also having 30%
stakes in this company. If the injunction of the nature sought for
by the foreign company is granted at this stage, it would sound
death knell to the Indian company. Therefore, even the balance
of convenience is in favour of Indian company. Accordingly this
application is also dismissed. However, the Indian company shall
also be bound by the conditions imposed upon foreign company,
namely, it would file statement of account in respect of sales made
by it in this Court from time to time and deposit 10% of the sale
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 14 of 40

amount in respect of these publications in this Court. This amount
shall be kept in a fixed deposit by the Registry in the name of
Registrar General of this Court.”

14.

Dr Singhvi then sought to establish the purported fraud that was played

by the defendant No.1 with regard to the 35 titles. He referred to the letter
dated 29.03.2002 written by the defendant No.1 to the plaintiff enclosing the
royalty payment of US$241,438.82 for the fiscal year ending 31.03.2001. It
was contended by Dr Singhvi that the royalty payment did not include 35 titles
in respect of which, also, the plaintiff was entitled to receive royalty. He
submitted that for the next year also, i.e., 31.03.2002, the position was the
same.

Dr Singhvi referred to the letter dated 01.07.2003 received by the

plaintiff from the defendant No.3 (Allied Publishers Pvt Ltd) who were the
distributors of books. The letter essentially enclosed details of the purchases of
titles from the defendant No.1. The list enclosed with the letter showed a
number of titles which were not included in the list annexed to the royalty
letters of 2001 and 2002. As an example, Dr Singhvi referred to the title
“Social Psychology” authored by Baron which was mentioned in the list
supplied by the defendant No.3 and did not find mention in the royalty list for
the year 2001-2002 supplied by the defendant No.1. Dr Singhvi then referred
to para 6 of the affidavit of the defendant No.2 filed on 16.07.2003 wherein,
according to Dr Singhvi, the non-mention of these titles is admitted, though the
excuse of the titles being out of print, etc. was taken. He also referred to the
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 15 of 40

reply filed on behalf of the defendants 1 and 2 to this IA (IA No.7129/2003)
wherein, in paragraphs 12 to 16, according to Dr Singhvi, the defendants have
virtually admitted the fact that the books were sold but the royalty was not
remitted for the aforesaid titles.

It is also mentioned in para 16 that the

defendant No.1 was, now, remitting the royalty in respect of the titles and was
also clearing up the shortfall in the advance royalty. It was also explained in
paragraph 16 that for some titles, no royalty was payable and others were out of
print.

15.

It was submitted by Dr Singhvi that it was because of this breach of trust

and / or dishonesty on the part of the defendant No.1 that the plaintiff was
compelled to issue the letter of termination dated 14.07.2003 terminating the
agreement of 07.09.1983 without prejudice to the plaintiff's contention that the
purported agreement dated 07.09.1983 was never intended to nor had been
acted upon. In the termination letter dated 14.07.2003, the issue of the royalty
not being paid in respect of a number of titles was specifically mentioned in
para 4 thereof. In para 5, it was contended by the plaintiff that the defendant
had deliberately suppressed and concealed the details of the said titles for colateral considerations with ulterior motives and for unjust gain which deprived
the plaintiff of royalty payments to which they were entitled. According to the
plaintiff, this constituted a breach of the terms and conditions of the purported
agreement dated 07.09.1983. According to the plaintiff, the alleged acts of
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 16 of 40

impropriety on the part of the defendant No.1 smacked of dishonesty and
deception and had shattered the basis of the relationship which was built upon
mutual trust and good faith. According to the plaintiff, this constituted a
fundamental breach which went to the root of the matter and was incapable of
being remedied and accordingly, there was no necessity to issue a 30 days
notice for remedying the breach.

16.

Dr Singhvi referred to the provisions of Section 14 of the Specific Relief

Act, 1963 to indicate that the agreement dated 07.09.1983 was, in any event, a
contract which could not be specifically enforced being one which in its nature
was determinable inasmuch as it contained a termination clause.

He also

referred to Sections 15 and 16 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 to point out that
the non-grant of an injunction and / or interim relief in favour of the plaintiff
would amount to permitting specific performance of the purported contract
dated 07.09.1983 when the defendant No.1 was not so entitled in law.

17.

Dr Singhvi then referred to the decision of a learned single Judge of this

court in the case of Vidya Securities Ltd. v. Comfort Living Hotels Pvt Ltd.:
AIR 2003 (Delhi) 214 to demonstrate that in cases of terminable contracts, no
specific performance can be permitted and that where a terminable contract is
wrongfully terminated, the remedy would not be of specific performance, but of
adequately compensating the aggrieved party in terms of money. A reference to
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 17 of 40

the Supreme Court decision in the case of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. v.
Amritsar Gas Service and Others.: 1991 (1) SCC 533 was also made by Dr
Singhvi. In para 12 of the said decision, the Supreme Court observed that a
distributorship agreement which had been terminated and which by its nature
was terminable could not be specifically enforced and even if the finding was
that the breach was committed by the party terminating the contract, the relief
of restoration of the distributorship could not be granted in view of the
provisions of Section 14 (1) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. Dr Singhvi
referred to para 14 of the said decision to indicate that where the termination
clause required a 30 days notice period and that had not been complied with, at
best, the aggrieved party could be compensated for loss of earnings for the
notice period. Para 14 of the said decision reads as under:“14. The question now is of the relief which could be granted
by the arbitrator on its finding that termination of the
distributorship was not validly made under clause 27 of the
agreement.
No doubt, the notice of termination of
distributorship dated March 11, 1983 specified the several acts
of the distributor on which the termination was based and there
were complaints to that effect made against the distributor which
had the effect of prejudicing the reputation of the appellantCorporation; and such acts would permit exercise of the right of
termination of distributorship under clause 27. However, the
arbitrator having held that clause 27 was not available to the
appellant-Corporation, the question of grant of relief on that
finding has to proceed on that basis. In such a situation, the
agreement being revocable by either party in accordance with
clause 28 by giving 30 days' notice, the only relief which could
be granted was th award of compensation for the period of
notice, that is, 30 days. The plaintiff-respondent 1 is, therefore,
entitled to compensation being the loss of earnings for the notice
period of 30 days instead of restoration of the distributorship.
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 18 of 40

The award has, therefore, to be modified accordingly. The
compensation for 30 days notice period from march 11, 1983 is
to be calculated on the basis of earnings during that period
disclosed from the records of the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.”
18.

The decision of a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Rajasthan

Breweries Ltd v. Stroh Brewery Company: AIR 2000 (Delhi) 450 was also
referred to. In para 20 of the said decision, the said Division Bench observed
that even in the absence of specific clause authorising and enabling either party
to terminate the agreement in the event of happening the events specified
therein, from the very nature of the agreement which is a private commercial
transaction, the same could be terminated even without any reason by serving a
reasonable notice.

It was further observed that at the most, in case it is

ultimately found that the termination was bad in law or contrary to the terms of
the agreement or of any understanding between the parties or for any other
reason, the remedies of the aggrieved party would be to seek compensation for
wrongful termination.

19.

Commencing his arguments, Mr Sudhir Chandra, the learned senior

counsel, who appeared on behalf of the defendants 1 and 2, drew my attention
straightway to Section 2 (j) of the Copyright Act, 1957 which defines
“exclusive licence” to mean a licence which confers on the licencee or on the
person authorised by him, to the exclusion of all other persons, (including the
owner of the copyright) any right comprised in the copyright in a work, and
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 19 of 40

“exclusive licence” is required to be construed accordingly. He then referred to
Section 54 of the Copyright Act, 1957 to indicate that the expression “owner of
a copyright”, for the purposes of chapter XII would include an exclusive
licencee. Section 30 of the Copyright Act, 1957 was also referred to indicate
that licences are granted by owners of the copyright. Section 17 relates to the
first owner of the copyright and Section 18 relates to the assignment of the
copyright. Mr Sudhir Chandra also referred to Section 30 (A) to indicate that
the provisions of Section 19 (A) would, with necessary adaptions and
modifications, apply in relation to a licence under Section 30 in the same way
as they apply in relation to assignment of a copyright in a work.

20.

With this background, Mr Sudhir Chandra invited my attention to the

various clauses of the purported agreement dated 07.09.1983 which have
already been set out above. With reference to clause 1, he submitted that an
exclusive licence for current and future books was granted by the plaintiff to
the defendant No.1.

In this context, he submitted that the defendant No.2

worked assiduously hard to build a market for the various titles. With reference
to clause 4 of the purported agreement dated 07.09.1983, Mr Sudhir Chandra
submitted that these individual agreements were only for the purposes of
royalty remittances. The exclusive licence did not flow from these individual
agreements, but from clause 1 of the purported agreement dated 07.09.1983
which was the parent licence for all titles, present and future. He referred to
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 20 of 40

clause 7 of the purported agreement dated 07.09.1983 which related to
termination. He contended that termination was possible only where there was
a breach of a term and condition by the defendant No.1 and where, after notice,
within 30 days thereof, the breach was not remedied by the defendant No.1.
The other ground for termination being the liquidation or insolvency of the
defendant No.1 which is not in question. Mr Sudhir Chandra submitted that
reading the said termination clause, it cannot be submitted that the contract was
terminable by its very nature.

According to him, the contract was not

terminable and only an exception had been provided and that is where the
breach was not remedied within 30 days notice period. Therefore, it was
submitted by Mr Sudhir Chandra that apart from the fact that the termination
letter dated 14.07.2003 was illegal, the contract itself was not terminable and,
therefore, could be specifically enforced.

21.

Thereafter, Mr Sudhir Chandra referred to the background and traced the

history of the relationship between the parties. He submitted that in 1963, a
joint venture collaboration between the plaintiff and members of the Laroia
family was entered into. The result of this relationship was the defendant No.1
company. In 1983, the defendant No.2, Asoke K. Ghosh was invited to take up
the majority shares in the defendant No.1 company as the Laroia wanted to
withdraw. Accordingly, 67.75% of the share-holding was with the defendant
No.2 and the plaintiff held 32.25% shares in the defendant No.1. In 1984,
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 21 of 40

Prentice Hall Inc. was taken over by Gulf Western. In 1998, Pearson Education
took over the controlling interest and the company's name was also changed
from Prentice Hall Inc. to Pearson Education Inc.

Mr Sudhir Chandra

submitted that the plaintiff started importing and printing titles through third
parties in India and that is why the plaintiff filed OS 716/2000 [renumbered as
CS(OS) 1340/2004] claiming that the 07.09.1983 agreement was a nullity. He
submitted that in the interim order passed on 10.05.2002 by Sikri, J, the prima
facie view held by him was that it was not a nullity and that an injunction
granted against the Indian company would sound its death knell. He referred in
detail to the said order dated 10.05.2002 passed by Sikri J to submit that a
prima facie view had been taken in that order that the contract dated 07.09.1983
was not opposed to public policy nor was it in restraint of the trade. With
reference to clause 4 of the agreement dated 07.09.1983, he submitted that the
individual agreements were necessary for complying with the Reserve Bank of
India guidelines. He submitted that the view taken by Sikri, J that the purported
agreement dated 07.09.1983 was not workable without the individual
agreements was only a prima faice view and that in order to strike a balance
between the parties, directions were issued permitting both the plaintiff and the
defendant No.1 to publish titles in India, subject to the condition that statements
of accounts would be submitted to this court and that 10% of the sale proceeds
would be deposited in this court. According to Mr Sudhir Chandra, this is a

IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 22 of 40

balance which had been struck between the competing interests of the parties
and ought not to be disturbed.

22.

To demonstrate as to how the controversy and dispute between the

parties arose, Mr Sudhir Chandra invited my attention to the letter dated
12.06.1998 written by the defendant No.2 to Mr Steve Dowling wherein it was
mentioned that Prentice Hall of India's relationship with the American
management had been very good for the first 33 years of its existence and there
had never been any cause of complaint. It was noted that during the last two
and half hears, the relationship between the Prentice Hall of India and the
present management of Simon and Schuster International had been strained due
to the most unreasonable and hostile attitude of the latter. In response to this
letter, Mr Steve Dowling, by a letter dated 25.08.1998, indicated to the
defendant No.2 that the new Pearson Education was keen to work with him and
to expand its presence in India and that he was open to discussion about the
past and about how they could be more successful in the future. Further
correspondence was referred to by Mr Sudhir Chandra to indicate the souring of
the relationship between the defendant No.2 and the plaintiff represented by Mr
Steve Dowling. A sample of this is indicated by the following passage in the
letter dated 19.07.1999 written by the defendant No.2 to Mr Steven Dowling of
the plaintiff:-

IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 23 of 40

“Pearson Education has purchased in the USA a company which
also include Prentice-Hall Inc. Just as you have taken over the
assets and liabilities of the purchased company, you have also
taken over the responsibility to respect the commitments and
agreements entered into by the purchased company. Apparently
some of your executives think that they can throw these
agreements to the wind as if we are living in a world where
there is no law. They show no respect to agreements that exist
between Prentice-Hall Inc. and Prentice-Hall of India from the
day the Indian company was formed 36 years ago.”
23.

In an e-mail received by the defendant No.2 from the said Mr Steven

Dowling, there is reference to the agreements of 1963 and 1983 which,
according to Mr Dowling, both, seemed to contemplate individual contracts for
each title for each edition. In response, the defendant No.2 indicated that the
defendants had been working for Prentice Hall Inc. since 1963, but had never
been harassed in the way the plaintiff had been doing so now. It was also
indicated that for most of the titles, no individual agreements were necessary
and that where they were necessary, it was only for the purposes of remittance
of royalty. It was lastly mentioned in the letter dated 25.08.1999 that the
agreements which existed between Plaintiff Hall Inc. and the defendant No.1 be
honoured with immediate effect.

24.

Mr Sudhir Chandra submitted that the discernible shift in stands took

place when the said Mr Steven Dowling sent a letter dated 02.11.1999 to the
defendant No.2 and the defendant No.2 responded to the same by its letter

IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 24 of 40

dated 06.12.1999. The following extracts from the letter dated 02.11.1999
would be indicative of such a change in stance:“I began by stating that the goal of Pearson Education is to be a
more significant participant in the Indian market. This means
an increase in revenue and profits greater than we are realizing
from the limited joint venture that we currently have with PHI.
While the dividend income has been steady and the licensing
income from PHI reprints has been increasing, we feel that we
can do better with our own company and in control of our own
destiny in the market.
xxxxx

xxxxx

xxxxx

xxxxx

xxxxx

I agreed that Pearson Education would review your requests for
reprint rights for Prentice Hall Higher Education titles on a
title-by-title basis. This includes any titles reprinted in the past
by PHI. I stated our view that grants of reprint rights are on a
title-by-title and edition -by-edition basis. There are no
continuing grants of rights to reprint any titles. Each reprint of
a new edition requires a new reprint license. The requests for
reprint licenses in respect of identified titles and identified
editions should be sent to Rosalia Garcia in Singapore with a
copy to me.
xxxxx

xxxxx

xxxxx

xxxxx

xxxxx

Our goal is to be a full participant in the Indian market. There
is great opportunity. We can do that as Pearson Education
India through a fuller ownership of PHI or by establishing a
new company. If we pursue the latter route, we will consider
and discuss how we can work with PHI in licensing and
distribution.”
The response of the defendants is exemplified by the following extracts from
the letter dated 06.12.1999:“Soon after my return from Frankfurt I got a nasty shock when I
discovered fresh and flagrant violations of the rights vested in
Prentice-Hall of India. By now you are fully aware of the
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 25 of 40

exclusive rights vested in Prentice-Hall of India to reprint,
publish, import, sell, export etc. all books in respect of which
Prentice Hall Inc. or any of its subsidiary or associate companies
owns or may own copyright. This right of Prentice-Hall of India
is a right protected by the Indian Copyright Act. Hence the
violation of the agreements in this manner is not a simple breach
of contract but an offence punishable under the Copyright Act.
All civilized nations have similar laws based on various
copyright conventions. By reprinting and importing into India
Prentice-Hall PTR titles which stand “assigned” to Prentice-Hall
of India you have again brought yourself in direct collision with
law. Such action on the part of Pearson Education is most
unbecoming, to say the least.
xxxxx

xxxxx

xxxxx

xxxxx

xxxxx

Your view that “there are no continuing rights” and “each
reprint of a new edition requires a new reprint license” is entirely
your personal view. A plain reading of our contract would
clearly convey that Prentice-Hall of India has a continuing
right.”
25.

Mr Sudhir Chandra submitted that the reliefs sought in the present suit

are virtually identical to the reliefs sought by the plaintiff in its first suit—OS
716/2000 [renumbered as CS(OS)1340/2004]. Mr Sudhir Chandra referred to
various provisions of the purported agreement dated 07.09.1983 and then
referred to the documents indicating the payments of royalty by the defendant
No.1 to the plaintiff for the years 31.03.2001 and 31.03.2002 and also indicated
the form of the Reserve Bank of India which is utilised for remittance of
royalty. He then referred to the earlier suit filed by the plaintiff as well as the
suit filed by the defendant. In this context, he referred to the judgment and / or
order of Sikri, J passed on 10.05.2002. He drew my attention to the order

IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 26 of 40

passed in IA No.992/2002 in Suit No.200/2000 [renumbered as CS(OS)
1339/2004] whereby the application filed by the defendant No.1 was disposed
of by holding that the defendant No.1 was not entitled to an injunction at that
stage and that the plaintiff herein would be entitled to get its book published
through any other person, but that the arrangement would be subject to the
condition that the plaintiff herein shall file complete accounts / statements of
sales relating to the publications in this court from time to time. Furthermore,
the plaintiff herein was required to also include those publications which had
already been undertaken by the plaintiff and particulars where of were given by
the defendant. The plaintiff was also required to deposit 10% of the sale
amount in respect of these publications in this court. He also referred to the
order passed in IA No.3524/2000 in OS No.716/2000 [renumbered as CS(OS)
1340/2004]. The said IA and the suit were filed on behalf of the plaintiff
herein. In that application, the plaintiff sought a restraint order against the
defendant No.1 prohibiting and restraining it from printing, etc. any book over
which the plaintiff had a copyright, including the books mentioned at
Annexure-F to the plaint therein other than the books over which the defendant
No.1 had a separate independent, valid and enforceable agreement in operation.
In this context, Sikri, J, while disposing of that application, observed that if the
injunction of the nature sought by the plaintiff was granted at that stage, it
would sound the death knell of the defendant No.1.

Accordingly, that

application was also dismissed and the defendant No.1 was bound to the same
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 27 of 40

conditions which were imposed on the plaintiff, of filing statements of accounts
in respect of the sales made by it and of depositing 10% of the sales in this
court.

26.

Mr Sudhir Chandra pointed out that the present suit was filed in a very

secretive manner. He submitted that the purported termination letter is dated
14.07.2003, whereas the present suit was also filed on the same day, i.e.,
14.07.2003 and the termination letter was faxed on 15.07.2003.

The first

hearing in the suit took place on 15.07.2003. The reliefs that are claimed in the
present suit were similar to the reliefs sought in Suit No.716/2000 [renumbered
as CS(OS) 1340/2004]. The appeals in respect of the order passed by Sikri, J
were directed to be listed for hearing before the Division Bench on 21.07.2003.
This direction was given on 22.04.2003 prior to the issuance of termination
letter. The order of 22.04.2003 passed by the Division Bench in FAO(OS)
242/2002 clearly indicates that the parties had submitted that they were in the
process of settlement and the matter had been adjourned at the counsels'
requests. Thus, according to Mr Sudhir Chandra, on the one hand, the plaintiff
took an adjournment on the ground that the possibility of a settlement was
being explored, while on the other hand, it issued the termination letter and
filed the suit on the same day. Apart from this, the termination letter was itself
bad because the required 30 days notice was not given to enable the defendant
No.1 to remedy the breaches, if any. Consequently, according to Mr Sudhir
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 28 of 40

Chandra, the plaintiff was not entitled to any equitable remedy on account of its
conduct. This is apart from the fact that ex facie the plaintiff has no case as
admittedly no notice was given. The purported reason for not giving the 30
days notice was, according to Mr Sudhir Chandra, clearly bogus.

27.

Mr Sudhir Chandra then referred to the Supreme Court decision in the

case of M/s Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. And Others v. Coca Cola Company and
Others: AIR 1995 SC 2372 and in particular para 46 thereof.

He also

submitted that Sikri, J has considered the balance of convenience and has
observed that granting an injunction in favour of the plaintiff would amount to
sounding the death knell of the defendant No.1. Mr Sudhir Chandra submitted
that the entire attempt of the plaintiff behind the issuance of the termination
letter and the filing of the suit was designed to present the court with a fait
accompli. Both the parties were already before Court and litigating and there
was no occasion for the plaintiff to have surreptitiously issued the termination
letter. It was also contended by Mr Sudhir Chandra that in Suit No.200/2000
[renumbered as CS(OS) 1339/2004], an order had been passed on 31.01.2000 in
the following terms:“Pending the further orders the defendant No.1 is restrained from
invoking clause 7 of the agreement dated 7.9.1983 (Annexure-1 at
pages 1-2 of the documents file) to terminate the agreement with
the plaintiff.”

IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 29 of 40

28.

Mr Sudhir Chandra submitted that this order has not been vacated by the

subsequent order dated 10.05.2002 which disposed of the application for
interim relief and, according to him, the order of 10.05.2002 does not supplant
the order of 31.01.2000, but the former order merges into the latter order.
Thus, even on this ground, the termination letter could not have been issued.
Mr Sudhir Chandra submitted that the plaintiff is only interested in multiplying
proceedings and complicating the issue further. He submitted that now the
plaintiff has filed a fourth suit being CS(OS) 1554/2005 wherein the plaintiff
has, inter alia, sought a decree for cancellation of the agreement dated
07.09.1983 and delivery of the deed to the plaintiff after cancellation. He
submitted that instead of seeking an amendment under Order 6 Rule 17 of the
CPC, the plaintiff is filing fresh suits and adding to the multiplicity of
proceedings. Order 6 Rule 17 could have been resorted to. For this, reliance
was placed on the case of Suraj Prakash Bhasin v. Smt. Raj Rani Bhasin &
Others: AIR 1981 SC 485 (paragraph 6). And, this, according to Mr Sudhir
Chandra, clearly amounts to an abuse of the process of court. For this, Mr
Sudhir Chandra placed reliance upon the decision of the case of Rajappa
Hanamantha Ranoji v. Mahadev Channabasappa & Others: 2000 (6) SCC
120 (paragraph 13). He also placed reliance on the case of K.K. Modi v. K.N.
Modi and Others: AIR 1998 SC 1297 as an instance of abuse of process of
court. One of the examples cited in the said decision was re-litigation. The
Supreme Court observed that it is an abuse of the process of the court and
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 30 of 40

contrary to justice and public policy for a party to re-litigate the same issue
which has already been tried and decided earlier against him. It also observed
that the re-agitation may or may not be barred as res judicata. But if the same
issue is sought to be re-agitated, it also amounts to an abuse of the process of
the court. Mr Sudhir Chandra also placed reliance on the case of Salem
Advocate Bar Association, Tamil Nadu v. Union of India: AIR 2005 SC 3353
(paragraph 39) and Austin Nicholas & Co. & Anr v. Arvind Behl & Anr:
2006 (32) PTC 133 (Delhi) (paragraph 69).

29.

In rejoinder, Dr Singhvi submitted that the prayers in OS 716/2000

[renumbered as CS(OS) 1340/2004] and CS(OS) No.1388/2003 (the present
suit) are different. The former suit related to a stage pre-termination and the
present suit relates to a stage post-termination.

He submitted that the

termination letter dated 14.07.2003 constituted a fresh and subsequent cause of
action and entitled the plaintiff to file a fresh suit.

In such a situation,

according to Dr Singhvi, there is no compulsion for amending the earlier suit
and a fresh suit on a subsequent cause of action could be filed. For this
proposition, he referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of The
Haryana Co-operative Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Joint Hindu Family Firm Styled as
Gupta Drum Supply Company: AIR 1976 P&H 117 (DB) (paragraphs 7, 8,
16), Sujanbai Haribhau Kakde and Others v. Motiram Gopal Saraf and
Another: AIR 1980 Bom 188 paragraphs 9, 10, 12 and Sidramappa v.
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 31 of 40

Rajashetty and Others: AIR 1976 SC 1059 paragraphs 7 & 8. He also
submitted that CS(OS) 1554/2005 was also in respect of a separate cause of
action and in that suit the prayer was for cancellation of the agreement dated
07.09.1983.

30.

He further submitted that the order dated 31.01.2000 which was an

interim order against termination passed in OS No.200/2000 [renumbered as
CS(OS) 1339/2004] does not survive any more inasmuch as after the passing of
the final order on 10.05.2002, the same stood merged therewith. He referred to
the Supreme Court decision in the case of National Bal Bhawan and Another
v. Union of India and Others: 2003 (9) SCC 671 for the purposes of
demonstrating the doctrine of merger.

With respect to the balance of

convenience argument raised by the defendant to the effect that, if the reliefs
prayed for by the plaintiff are granted at this interim stage, it would sound the
“death knell” of the defendant company, Dr Singhvi submitted that this is a
mere false alarm. He submitted that 60% of the revenues that are received by
the defendant company are from non-Pearson titles and, therefore, there is no
question of raising the “death knell” argument. He submitted that, in any event,
after May, 2002, there was no individual agreement subsisting.

31.

With regard to the argument of exclusivity under the agreement dated

07.09.1983, Dr Singhvi submitted that this exclusivity has not even been
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 32 of 40

sustained by the order dated 10.05.2002 because it permits both the plaintiff
and the defendant to publish titles in India. He also submitted that the reference
to Section 2 (j) of the Copyright Act, 1957 for the purposes of defining the
expression “exclusive licence” can only be used for explaining the said
expression wherever it is used in the Act. It is so used in Sections 54, 55, 56
and 61. He submitted that the copyright does not vest in the licencee as it is not
a case of assignment. Sections 18 and 19 of the said Act related to assignees
but, that, is not where the expression “exclusive license” is used. He further
submitted that the individual agreements that were entered into between the
parties cannot be regarded as progeny of the purported parent agreement dated
07.09.1983. This is so because the individual agreements were at variance with
the general agreement of 07.09.1983. He submitted that the relationship of the
parties are governed in respect of the different titles of books on the basis of the
individual agreements that had been entered into between them. They were
stand-alone agreements which have expired and he submitted that, in any event,
the owner can always terminate a licence even if it is an exclusive licence. He
further submitted that the licences were terminable.

32.

As mentioned at the beginning of this judgment, the key issues

that have been raised are whether the agreement dated 07.09.1983 was in
existence ? If yes, whether the same had been validly terminated by the letter
of 14.07.2003 ? If the termination was bad in law, would the defendants only
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 33 of 40

be entitled to damages ? The issue with regard to the existence and / or validity
of the agreement dated 07.09.1983 was before this Court when the said order
dated 10.05.2002 was passed by Sikri, J. Therefore, it would not be appropriate
for this court to venture into that arena. The only thing that has happened after
the passing of the order dated 10.05.2002 is the issuance of the letter dated
14.07.2003 invoking clause 7 of the purported agreement dated 07.09.1983. It
has been contended by the plaintiff that the agreement dated 07.09.1983 was a
terminable contract and, therefore, no specific performance could be permitted
of the same. And, if the defendants were aggrieved by the termination, they
could claim damages only. However, it must be remembered that it is not the
defendants who have filed the present suit, but it is the plaintiff who, after
purportedly terminating the agreement dated 07.09.1983, is claiming an
injunction on the basis of such termination.

The defendants have not

approached this court seeking specific performance of the contract.

The

decision in Vidya Securities Ltd (supra) would, therefore, not be applicable.
As regards the decision in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (supra), it must be noted
that in that case, though the distributorship was terminated, the termination
clause itself permitted termination of the contract by either party on giving 30
days notice. It was an admitted case of a terminable contract and terminable at
the instance of either party. Para 14 of the said decision which has been
extracted earlier in this judgment clearly indicates this. In the present case, it is
disputed as to whether the contract dated 07.09.1983 was a terminable contract
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 34 of 40

at all. It has been contended that this contract was not terminable and only two
exceptions have been provided in clause 7 of the agreement dated 07.09.1983.

The exception of insolvency or liquidation of the defendant is not in issue and,
therefore, does not call for any consideration. The other exception is that the
plaintiff was required to issue a written notice of 30 days requiring the
defendants to remedy any breaches. In case the breaches were not remedied
during the notice period, only then was it open to the plaintiff to terminate the
same. It was contended by Mr Sudhir Chandra that this was the only exception
which permits the contract to be terminated. Otherwise, the contract was not
terminable

by its own terms.

To my mind, the issue as to whether the

agreement dated 07.09.1983 was

or was not a terminable contract is a

debatable one which need not be determined at this stage. Consequently, the
issue of whether the defendant is only entitled to damages or not is also not in
issue at this stage because, firstly, the present suit is one of injunction at the
instance of the plaintiff and is not a suit for specific performance at the instance
of the defendant. Secondly, the question of any damages, if at all, would arise
only at the final stage of the suit and cannot be determined at this interim stage.
Therefore, the decision in Rajasthan Breweries Ltd (supra) would also not be
applicable at this stage.

33.

As pointed out in Gujarat Bottling Company Ltd (supra) the grant of an

interlocutory injunction during the pendency of legal proceedings is a matter
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 35 of 40

requiring exercise of discretion of the court. It has also been pointed out that
while exercising discretion, the court is required to apply the following tests:i)

Whether the plaintiff has a prima facie case;

ii)

Whether the balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiff;

iii)

Whether the plaintiff would suffer an irreparable injury if his
prayer for interlocutory injunction is disallowed.

It was pointed out that the decision whether or not to grant interlocutory
injunction has to be taken at a time when the existence of a legal right assailed
by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and uncertain and
remain uncertain till they are established at the trial on evidence. Relief by way
of interlocutory injunction is granted to mitigate the risk of injustice to the
plaintiff during the period before the uncertainty could be resolved.

The

Supreme Court also pointed out that the object of the interlocutory injunction is
to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his right for which he could
not be adequately compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the
uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. It was, however, pointed
out that the need for such protection has to be weighed against the
corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting
from his having been prevented from exercising his own legal rights for which
he could not be adequately compensated. The court must weigh one need
against another and determine where the balance of convenience lies.
Considering the present case in this context, one finds that the plaintiff does not
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 36 of 40

have a clear-cut prima facie case of a valid termination of the agreement dated
07.09.1983. Clearly, the purported termination does not comply strictly with
the provisions of clause 7 of the agreement inasmuch as no written notice of 30
days has been issued. The plaintiff claims that issuance of such a notice would
be a redundancy in view of its understanding that the alleged breach was of
such a nature that it could not be remedied. But this so-called redundancy has
to be established on evidence in the trial. It cannot, at this stage, be accepted
that the plaintiff was entitled to give a go-bye to the requirement of issuing the
said written notice.

34.

As regards the question of balance of convenience, the same has to be

considered by weighing the needs of the plaintiff against the needs of the
defendants. If the injunction that the plaintiff is seeking is granted at this stage,
it would amount to virtually decreeing the suit and setting at naught the
arrangement that has been determined by Sikri, J in his order dated 10.05.2002.
It would, in my view, completely disturb the balance that has been achieved by
that order and would permit the plaintiff to do something which was not
allowed by this court earlier.

35.

There is another aspect of the matter and that is that on 31.01.2000, as

indicated above, an order had been passed in Suit No.200/2000 [renumbered as
CS(OS) 1339/2004] to the effect that pending further orders, the plaintiff was
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 37 of 40

restrained from invoking clause 7 of the agreement dated 07.09.1983 to
terminate the agreement with the defendant No.1. According to Dr Singhvi,
this order has merged with the order dated 10.05.2002 and, therefore, no longer
exists. However, according to Mr Sudhir Chandra, this order, though it has
merged with the order dated 10.05.2002 has not been supplanted by it. Dr
Singhvi had relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
National Bal Bhawan (supra) to indicate that once a writ petition is finally
disposed of by the High Court, any interim order passed in the pending writ
petition merges with the final order. Unfortunately, in this case, the suit has
not yet been disposed of and only interim orders have been passed. The
question would still remain as to whether the interim order passed on
31.01.2000 has been supplanted by the interim order passed on 10.05.2002 in
its entirety. As observed by the Supreme Court in Gojer Brothers v. Ratan Lal
Singh: 1974 (2) SCC 453, the juristic justification of the doctrine of merger
may be sought in the principle that there cannot be, at one and the same time,
more than one operative order governing the same subject-matter. It is in this
context that the Supreme Court observed that the judgment of an inferior court,
if subjected to an examination by the superior court, ceases to have existence in
the eye of law and is treated as being superseded by the judgment of the
superior court. The Supreme Court further observed that in other words, the
judgment of the inferior court loses its identity by its merger with the judgment
of the superior court. In the present case, it could be argued that the fields
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 38 of 40

covered by the order dated 31.01.2000 and that by the order dated 10.05.2002
are different and, therefore, the latter order did not supplant the former. That
of course, is also a debatable issue.

36.

Therefore, the crux of the issue in this application is the course of action

to be adopted in view of the purported termination on 14.07.2003 of the
agreement dated 07.09.1983. This by itself does not pose much difficulty.
However, this issue cannot be considered in a vacuum and has to be considered
in the background of the other suits filed by the parties and particularly the said
order dated 10.05.2002 passed therein as an interim arrangement.

I have

referred to the arguments advanced by the counsel for the plaintiff and the
defendants in great detail so as to demonstrate the internecine battle that is
raging between the plaintiff and the defendants.

All issues prior to the

purported termination letter dated 14.07.2003 have already received the
attention of this court and have culminated in the order dated 10.05.2002
passed by Sikri, J. That order is also the subject matter of Letters Patent
Appeals, as mentioned above. The circumstances in which the order was
passed and the order itself indicates that the matter of dispute between the
parties lies in a critical balance. Which way the balance tilts can only be
determined after the conclusion of the trial in the suits. Therefore, I feel that at
this stage, this balance ought not to be disturbed by passing any order of
injunction in favour of the plaintiff. Because if such an order were to be
IA 7129/03 in CS(OS)1388/03

Page No. 39 of 40

passed, it would definitely impinge upon the earlier order passed on 10.05.2002
in the other suits. It is not as if the suits are unrelated. The entire litigation
between the parties which has resulted, so far, in the filing of four suits has
formed an intricate web which, to my mind, can only be resolved after evidence
is led and the suits are concluded.

37.

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss this application.
