SANJIV KHANNA, J :
1. The appellants herein have challenged the judgment dated 8th
May, 2006 passed in Civil Writ Petition No. 1163/95 and the
order dated 3rd November, 2006 dismissing their Review
Application No. 7971/06.
2. The appellants were appointed as steno-typist by the erstwhile

LPA No. 2316-20/2006

Page 2

Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking (hereinafter referred to as
DESU, for short) on ad-hoc basis during the period between
May, 1989-February, 1990, after holding a competitive
examination. The appellants were regularized on different
dates in 1992.
3. By an employment notice no. F1(69)/92/AO(PIV)/94-95/16
dated 19th August, 1994, DESU invited applications from its
employees who had three years regular service in the grade of
steno typist as on 30th September, 1994, for appearing in a
departmental competitive examination for appointment to the
post of Junior Stenographer (English). The appellants together
with the respondent nos 7-12 herein and others appeared in
this examination.
4. On 23rd January, 1995, the respondent no.2 DESU declared
that the respondent nos 7-12 had been selected for the
appointment to the post of Junior Stenographer (English).
Aggrieved by the selection of respondent nos 7-12, the
appellants approached this Court by way of Civil Writ Petition
No. 1163/95.
5. Before the learned Single Judge, it was urged by the appellants
that the respondent nos 7-12 were not qualified and eligible for
appointment to the said post, as they did not satisfy the

LPA No. 2316-20/2006

Page 3

condition of having served as regular employees for a period of
three years in the grade as on 30th September, 1994. It was
submitted that the result of the appellants had also not been
declared.
6. The same ground has been urged in this Appeal. Learned
counsel for the appellant contended that the appellants were
not permitted to appear in a similar Departmental Competitive
Examination held in 1992 on the ground of not having
completed three years' regular service.
7. Learned Single Judge, however, dismissed the writ petition,
inter alia, holding that the appellants herein did not have
actionable grievance. They had also appeared for selection as
Jr. Stenographer in the limited departmental competitive
examination in 1992, when they had not completed three years
regular service in the grade of steno typist, but had failed to
qualify. Ld. Single Judge also held that the appellants had not
qualified in the exam held in 1994. The Review Application was
also dismissed by the learned Single Judge on the ground that
the appellants had participated in a similar test in 1992 though
they had not put in three years regular service and did not meet
the eligibility criteria. It was further held that the Court was not
empowered to review it's earlier order by re-examining and re-

LPA No. 2316-20/2006

Page 4

appreciating merits of the case once again.
8. Our attention has been drawn to the Recruitment Rules for
appointment to the post of Jr. Stenographer (English). As per
the said Recruitment Rules, post of Jr. Stenographer (English)
is a selection post. 75% of the said posts are required to be
filled by limited Departmental Examination and 25% posts are
to be filled by promotion. The qualification for recruitment by

the

post

of

Jr.Stenographer (English) in DESU is Steno-typist having three
years regular service in the Grade having requisite typing and

which 100 w.p.m. in shorthand
and 30 w.p.m. in typewriting in
English.

9. It is clear from the counter affidavit filed by DESU that it was
not acting in consonance with the said Rules. It was stated in
the additional affidavit filed by DESU that

the stipulation of

three years regular service was not adhered to in 1992 when
candidates working on adhoc basis were also allowed to
participate

and

appear

in

the

limited

Departmental

Examination. Similarly, in 1994 again candidates who were
working on adhoc basis were allowed to appear in the
examination. It was further pointed out that in response to the

LPA No. 2316-20/2006

Page 6

employment notice in question, 27 applications were received
out of which only 18 persons had three years regular service.
However, as before DESU took a lenient view and

all 27

candidates were allowed to appear in the examination. In the
additional affidavit it was also pointed out that as a matter of
policy, DESU had always allowed adhoc employees to appear
for limited departmental examination without any discrimination.
This is unfortunate and is contrary to law. Recruitment Rules
must be adhered to and are mandatory. The submission that in
the past also Recruitment Rules had been violated and
therefore

they can be repeatedly violated with immunity

deserves to be rejected. The submission is legally untenable.
Repeated violations of law and mandatory provisions of the
Recruitment Rules does not confer any right to violate the
Rules in future. Strict compliance with the Recruitment Rules,
specially mandatory statutory qualifications is a must. Only
those who meet the minimum eligibility criteria can be allowed
to participate in the limited departmental examination. Failure to
adhere to the Recruitment Rules and the qualification/eligibility
criteria prescribed would encourage nepotism, arbitrariness
and certainly violates Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of
India. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the

LPA No. 2316-20/2006

Page 7

minimum qualification prescribed in the Recruitment Rules
must be adhered to. The decision of the Supreme Court in case
of National Fertilizers Ltd. v. Somvir Singh, reported in
(2006) 5 SCC 493 is relevant. It was observed:
“13. The respondents herein were appointed
only on applications made by them.
Admittedly, no advertisement was issued in a
newspaper nor was the employment
exchange notified as regards existence of
vacancies. It is now trite law that “State”
within the meaning of Article 12 of the
Constitution is bound to comply with the
constitutional requirements as adumbrated in
Articles 14 and 16 thereof. When the
Recruitment Rules are made, the employer
would be bound to comply with the same. Any
appointment in violation of such Rules would
render them as nullities. It is also well settled
that no recruitment should be permitted to be
made through back door.”
10.The requirement in the Recruitment Rules is three years
regular service in the Grade of Steno-typist. As per the
employment notice dated 19th August, 1994 also the said
minimum requirement of three years regular service in the
Grade as on 30th September, 1994 had to be complied with.
Unfortunately, the respondent Nos. 7-12 who did not fulfill the
said criteria were allowed to participate in the limited
departmental examination. It is quite possible that there may be
others, who may not have applied keeping in view the

LPA No. 2316-20/2006

Page 8

Recruitment Rules and the eligibility criteria laid down in the
employment notice.
11.Learned Single Judge in the judgment dated 8th May, 2006 has
observed that the appellants do not have any actionable
grievance as they had joined services in 1989 and were
regularised in 1992. It has been further observed that the
appellants had appeared in the competitive examination held
in 1995 but they had failed to qualify. This would not justify
appointment of Respondents 7 to 12 who were not eligible.
The question of selection of respondent Nos.7-12 and their
appointments as Jr.Stenographer (English) was also required
to be examined. In case the said respondent Nos.7-12 did not
meet the minimum eligibility criteria for appointment as per the
Recruitment Rules, they could not have been appointed to the
said posts. Appointment of the respondent Nos.7-12 to the said
posts may have affected the appellants even if they had not
qualified in the limited departmental examination and the said
respondents have become their seniors, even though they did
not fulfill the requisite eligibility criteria for appointment. Thus, if
the appellants subsequently qualify in the limited departmental
examination for Jr. Stenographers (English), they would
become juniors to the respondent Nos.7-12. We feel these

LPA No. 2316-20/2006

Page 9

aspects have to be gone into and examined by the learned
Single Judge. It is also to be examined whether the respondent
Nos.7-12 were regularised as Steno-typist at any point of time
and if so, from which date. Suitable directions may be required
to be given in case the appellants have later on qualified in the
limited departmental examination in respect of their seniority
vis-a-vis the respondent Nos.7-12.
12. We have also examined the register produced before us by
the respondents. The register shows that in the shorthand test
at 100 w.p.m. for 10 minutes and typing held on 7 th January,
1995, the appellants had been declared 'passed'. However, in
the shorthand (English) test and typing held on the same date
for 120 w.p.m. for 7 minutes, the appellants were declared
'failed'. The Recruitment Rules quoted above clearly specify
that in the limited departmental examination, persons fulfilling
the eligibility criteria should qualify the examination at a speed
of 120 w.p.m. in shorthand (English) and 45 w.p.m. in
typerwriting (English), failing which test in shorthand (English)
at 100 w.p.m. and typewriting (English) at 30 w.p.m. has to be
passed. The appellants, therefore, had not passed the test of
speed of 120 w.p.m. in shorthand (English) and 45 w.p.m. in
typing (English) but has passed the test of 100 w.p.m. typing
(English). The question whether under the relevant Recruitment
Rules the appellants had qualified depending upon the number
of eligible candidates therefore has to be examined.
13.Another question which requires examination is whether the
appellants were also eligible under the Recruitment Rules in

LPA No. 2316-20/2006

Page 10

1994-95, has not been decided in the impugned judgment. The
appellants were also appointed on adhoc basis between the
period May 1989-February, 1990 and were regularized on
different dates in 1992. As per the employment advertisement
only those employees who had completed three years of
regular service in the grade of Steno-typist on 30th September,
1994 were eligible to appear in the examination and for
appointment to the post of Jr. Stenographer (English). Thus the
appellants were not eligible as they had not completed three
years of regular service in the Grade of Steno-typist on 30th
September, 1994. However, it is a case of the appellants that
regularization once given must relate back to the date of
original appointment. This question has not been specifically
examined and decided in the impugned judgment. For this
reason also we feel that the matter should be remanded back.
Learned Single Judge while examining this contention will also
keep in mind whether the respondent Nos.7-12 herein were
regularised and from what dates.
14.Learned Single Judge will also have to examine if the
appointments are illegal and contrary to the Recruitment Rules
then from which date the appellants and the respondent Nos.712 qualified for appointment and should be promoted as Jr.
Stenographers (English).
15.In view of the facts and circumstances as stated above, we
allow the present Appeal and set aside the judgment dated 8th
May, 2006 and remand the matter back to the learned Single
Judge to decide afresh, all issues and controversies in the light

LPA No. 2316-20/2006

of the observations made above. No Costs.
