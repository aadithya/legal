GITA MITTAL, J.
1.

The present writ petitions are being taken up together

for hearing inasmuch the factual matrix in both these cases is the
same and further that the issues raised therein stand answered by
the Apex Court in the pronouncement reported at AIR 2004 SC
4161 Delhi Transport Corporation vs Sardar Singh and as such are
being disposed of by this common judgment.
2.

The respondent Shri Dalip Kumar was appointed as a

driver with the petitioner on 6th February , 1989. On the allegation
that he remained unauthorisedly absent from duty with effect from
1st January, 1991 to 31st December, 1991, the petitioner issued a
chargesheet dated 24th March, 1993 to him. A domestic inquiry
was conducted in respect of the charges which were levelled
against the respondent which culminated in an inquiry report.
The petitioner issued a show cause notice dated 15th March, 1994.
After a consideration of the matter, by the disciplinary authority,
vide an order passed on 6th July, 1994, the punishment of removal
from service was imposed upon the respondent.
3.

The

petitioner

W.P.(C) Nos. 1536/00 & 3233/2001

DTC

has

contended

2

that

the

respondent/workman remained absent unauthorisedly for a
period of 81 days from 1st January, 1991 to 31st December, 1991. It
has been urged before this court that out of this period of 81 days,
leave applications for 78 days were rejected while he absented
himself on three days without even making any application.
4.

It appears that the respondent had raised an industrial

disputes which had been referred for adjudication by way of ID
No. 17/1988 which was pending. In this view of the matter, the
DTC had sought approval of the disciplinary action and the order
imposing punishment by way of an application under Section 33
(2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
5.

The alleged unauthorised absence of the respondent in

its records was

treated as leave without pay.

The Industrial

Adjudicator was of the view that the effect of the action of the DTC
in treating unauthorised absence as leave without pay amounted to
its regularisation. For this reason it held that the disciplinary
action conducted by the DTC could not be sustained and that there
was no irregularity on the part of the respondent.

In these

circumstances, vide an order dated 9th August, 1999, the Industrial
Tribunal vitiated the domestic inquiry conducted by the petitioner
holding that the chargesheet was issued on unfounded facts on
W.P.(C) Nos. 1536/00 & 3233/2001

3

irregularity and misconduct of the respondent.
6.

Aggrieved by the order dated 9th August, 1999, the DTC

has filed Writ Petition(Civil) 1536/2000 impugning the same.
7.

In the meantime, it appears that the respondent had also

challenged his removal from service and the disputes raised by
him had been referred by the Government of National Capital
Territory of Delhi vide an order of reference dated 8th September,
1998. The reference was in the following terms :-

8.

“Whether the removal of Sh. Dalip Kumar from
service is illegal and/or unjustified and if so, to
what relief is he entitled and what directions are
necessary in this respect?”
This reference was registered as ID No. 394/1998.

Based on the order passed by the Industrial Tribunal dated 9th
August, 1999 dismissing the application of the petitioner under
Section 33 (2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, it was held by the
Labour Court in these proceedings that the inquiry proceedings
having been initiated, there was no punishment against the
respondent and the removal of the workman from service
tantamounted to retrenchment which necessitated mandatory
compliance with the provisions of Section 25 F of the Industrial
Disputes Act. After so finding, the Labour Court answered the
reference in favour of the respondent/workman holding that the
W.P.(C) Nos. 1536/00 & 3233/2001

4

removal of the respondent Shri Dalip Kumar from service was
illegal and directed reinstatement of his services with full back
wages.

An award in these terms was passed in favour of the

workman on 13th May, 2000.
9.

This award in favour of the workman dated 13th May,

2000 has been assailed by the petitioner before this court in Writ
Petition(Civil) 3233/2001.
10.

The effect of the action of the DTC in treating

unauthorised absence as leave without pay has fallen for
consideration before the Apex Court which has authoritatively
decided the principles of law in the judgment reported at AIR
2004 SC 4161 DTC vs. Sardar Singh.
11.

After consideration of the applicable Regulations and

the provisions of the Standing Order, it was held by the Apex Court
as follows :“ 9.
When an employee absents himself
from duty, even without sanctioned leave for
very long period, it prima facie shows lack of
interest in work. Para 19(h) of the Standing
Order as quoted above relates to habitual
negligence of duties and lack of interest in the
Authority's work. When an employee absents
himself from duty without sanctioned leave
the Authority can, on the basis of the record,
come to a conclusion about the employee
being habitually negligent in duties and an
W.P.(C) Nos. 1536/00 & 3233/2001

5

12.

exhibited lack of interest in the employee's
work. ...... Habitual absence is a factor which
establishes lack of interest in work. There
cannot be any sweeping generalization. But
at the same time some telltale features can be
noticed and pressed into service to arrive at
conclusions
in
the
departmental
proceedings.”
Placing reliance on its earlier judgment in 1969 (3)

SLR 274 in State of Madhya Pradesh vs Harihar Gopal,
the Apex Court observed as follows:“10.
.....The charge in that case was, as in
the present case, absence without obtaining
leave in advance.
The conduct of the
employee in this case is nothing but
irresponsible in extreme and can hardly be
justified.
The charge in this case was
misconduct by absence. In view of the
Governing Standing Orders unauthorised
leave can be treated as misconduct.
11.
Conclusions regarding negligence
and lack of interest can be arrived at by
looking into the period of absence, more
particularly, when same is unauthorised.
Burden is on the employee who claims that
there was no negligence and/or lack of
interest to establish it by placing relevant
materials.
Clause (ii) of Para 4 of the
Standing Order shows the seriousness
attached to habitual absence. In clause (i)
thereof, there is requirement of prior
permission, Only exception made is in case of
sudden illness. There also conditions are
stipulated, non-observance of which renders
the absence unatuhroised.”
13.

The court accepted the contention of the DTC that its

W.P.(C) Nos. 1536/00 & 3233/2001

6

action is treating unauthoried absence from duty as leave without
pay did not amount to regularisation of absence. Observing that
in all the cases before it, almost the whole period of the absence
was without sanctioned leave, it was held that mere making of an
application after or even before absence does not in any way
assist the concerned employee and that the legal requirement was
to obtain leave in advance.
14.

It is noteworthy that the Apex Court has held that

findings with regard to negligence and lack of interest would be
arrived at by examination of the period of absence and the conduct
of the employee. Habitual absence is one of the factors which
would establish lack of interest in the work.
15.

Even in the case of illness preventing a workman from

reporting on duty, a prior permission of the employer and sanction
of leave is mandatory and the only exception drawn in the
applicable Regulations and order is to be found in para 4 (ii)
wherein an exception is made in the case of sudden illness. It was
stated that intimation would need to be sent to the office
immediately in accordance with para 4 (ii) of the applicable
standing orders of the Delhi Transport Corporation. However non
observance of the stipulated conditions renders the absence
W.P.(C) Nos. 1536/00 & 3233/2001

7

unauthorised.
16.

The principles applicable have been authoritatively laid

down by the Apex Court.

In view thereof, the action of the

Industrial Tribunals in dismissing the application under Section
33 (2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 which was filed by
the DTC seeking approval of the disciplinary action taken by it
against such a workman who has remained unauthorisedly absent
from duty on the sole ground that the DTC had treated this
unauthorised absence as “leave without pay” is contrary to law
and deserves to be struck down.
17.

As per the principles laid down by the Apex Court, the

burden of proof is on the employee who claims that there was no
negligence and/or lack of interest in performing the duties and he
has to establish the same by placing relevant materials before the
court.
Mere making of an application before or after absence
from the work does not assist a workman as the requirement is to
be obtain leave in advance.
18.

The question as to whether there was negligence or lack

of interest to perform duties, whether the employee had made
applications and the fate thereof are matters of fact which require
W.P.(C) Nos. 1536/00 & 3233/2001

8

evidence.

Individual cases have to be scrutinised in the light of

the evidence which is produced by the parties before the Industrial
Tribunals/Labour Court on their own merits.

The effect of

workmen having submitted leave applications has to be evaluated
based on the oral and documentary evidence which the parties
may adduce before the Industrial Tribunal which has the
jurisdiction to examine the entire gamut of circumstances and
actions of the workman.
The industrial adjudicator would be required to consider
the effect of the orders passed on the applications and the effect of
failure of DTC to pass orders on these applications.
19.

In view of the above legal position, I find that the

impugned order dated 9th August, 1999 and Award dated 13th May,
2000 was based on a misconception in law to the effect that the
action of the DTC in treating the unauthorised absence as a period
of leave without pay amounts to the regularisation of the
unauthorised absence. The same cannot be legally sustained in
the light of the above position in law.
20.

Accordingly,

the

writ

petitions

3233/2001

and

1536/2000 have to be allowed. The order passed by the Industrial
Tribunal No. II dated 9th August, 1999 in OP No. 105/1994 is
W.P.(C) Nos. 1536/00 & 3233/2001

9

hereby set aside and quashed. For the same reason, the Award
dated 13th May, 2000 in ID No. 394/1998 by the Labour Court No.
VII cannot be sustained in law and is hereby quashed.
The parties are directed to appear before the Industrial
Tribunal No.II in OP No. 105/1994 and Labour Court No. VII in ID
No. 394/1998 on 20th December, 2005 for further proceedings.
The matter shall be proceeded with accordance with law after
giving full opportunity to both parties.
21.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has pointed out that

pursuant to an order dated 22nd February, 2000 passed in Writ
Petition(Civil) 3233/2001, the petitioner has deposited an amount
of Rs.1,53,203/- in this court. In view of the impugned award
having been set aside, this amount has to be refunded to the
petitioner.
Accordingly the Registry is directed to return the
amount which stands deposited by the petitioner to the
respondent through learned counsel representing it in this court.
22.

It is made clear that nothing observed herein in an

expression on the merits of the controversy between the parties
and the matters shall be decided by the adjudicators uninfluenced
by any observation herein.
W.P.(C) Nos. 1536/00 & 3233/2001

These writ petitions are allowed in the above terms.
