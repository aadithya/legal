1.

Heard learned counsel for the parties.

2.

Vide impugned order dated 4.6.2005, appellant's

application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC has been dismissed on
account of the same being barred by limitation and benefit of
Section 5 of the Limitation Act being denied.
3.

The appellants had sought recall of an ex-parte

decree dated
FAO.No.211/05

3.8.2002

alleging that the appellant got
page 1 of 7

knowledge of the decree only on 26.9.2004 when in an
arbitration

proceedings

relating

to

another

firm

of

the

appellant, namely Swati Exports, reference was made to the
instant decree.
4.

It was stated in the application that the appellant

was not served with summons in the suit.
5.

Respondent's response was that not only was the

appellant served with the summons in the suit by registered
post AD and that AD card was on the file of the court but
additionally it was stated that the appellant had sought
appointment

of

an

Arbitrator

vide

Arbitration

Petition

No.16/2002 pertaining to a jural relationship between the
appellant's firm Swati Exports and the respondent. That said
Arbitration Petition was filed in the Lucknow Bench of the
Allahabad High Court in which a counter affidavit was filed by
the respondent wherein reference was made to the suit and
the ex-parte decree dated 3.8.2002.

Pertaining to the said

Arbitration Petition, in para 2 of the preliminary objections, in
the reply to appellant's application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC,
it was inter alia pleaded as under:“That the application of the Defendant under
Order 9 Rule 13 CPC is barred by limitation. The
limitation to set aside an Exparte Decree as per
Article 123 of the Limitation Act is 30 days. In
the instant case, the Judgment and decree was
FAO.No.211/05

page 2 of 7

passed on 03.08.2002 and the present
application bears the date 25.10.2004. There is
a delay of more than two years. The application
has been filed by the Defendant with the
allegation that the Defendant came to know of
the Judgment and Decree on 26.09.2004, when
the Plaintiff herein filed reply to the claim of the
Defendant in an Arbitration proceeding. It is
stated that the alleged date of the knowledge of
the Defendant about the Judgment and Decree
is a blatant lie. The Defendant was only duly
served with the summons of the suit by
registered AD Post, but he now erroneously
claims that the signatures on the AD cared have
been manipulated by the Plaintiff. Be that as it
may, the Plaintiff had filed an application for
taking his counter affidavit on record on
15.12.2003, in the matter of Arbitration
Proceeding No.16/02, before the Hon'ble High
Court of Judicature “Dinesh Chandra Mahendra
Vs. Adarsh Priya Srivastava”, at Allahabad
Lucknow Bench, Lucknow.
In that counter
affidavit of 15.12.2003, the Plaintiff had duly
mentioned about having filed the present suit
and having obtained the Judgment and Decree
dated 03.08.02 in suit No.214/02 in the matter
of “Adarsh Priya Srivastava Vs. Globe
Industries", through its proprietor Sh. Dinesh
Chandra Mahendra. The said affidavit was taken
on record by the Hon'ble High Court of
Judicature of Allahabad on the same day and the
Hon'ble High Court passed an order dated
15.12.2003, wherein it has been mentioned that
counter affidavit filed in the Court be kept on
record. Copy of the counter affidavit was duly
supplied to the counsel for the Defendant. The
order dated 15.12.2003 was passed by the
Hon'ble High Court in the presence of counsel
for both the parties. Assuming for the sake of
arguments, but not admitting that the
Defendant was not served with the summons of
the suit, still he came to know of the present
suit and the Judgment and Decree dated
03.08.02, atleast on 15.12.2003, when it was
mentioned by the Plaintiff in his counter
FAO.No.211/05

page 3 of 7

affidavit. The application is wholly barred by
limitation and is liable to be dismissed with
exemplary costs.”
6.

Holding that the appellant had knowledge about the

instant suit and the decree when counter affidavit was filed
before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court on
15.12.2003 learned Trial Court held that at least on said date
i.e. 15.12.2003 appellant would be having knowledge of the
decree and that since the application under Order 9 Rule 13
CPC was filed on 25.10.2004, delay post December, 2003
remained unexplained.
7.

It is urged in the instant appeal that the counter

affidavit which was filed before the learned Judge of the
Lucknow High Court was taken on record on 15.12.2003, as
recorded in the order dated 15.12.2003, and hence the
appellant did not have knowledge of the contents of the
counter affidavit as the appellant had no occasion to respond
thereto.
8.

At the first blush argument of the learned counsel

for the appellant appears to be attractive but a re-look and
specially at the pleadings of the appellant in rejoinder to the
reply filed by the respondent to appellant's application under
Order 9 Rule 13 CPC requires much to be explained as far as
the appellant is concerned.
FAO.No.211/05

9.

Responding to the preliminary objection No.2 in the

reply filed by the respondent to appellant's application under
Order 9 Rule 13 CPC, the respondent submitted as under :“2. The contents of the para under reply are
wrong and denied. It is denied that the
application of the defendant under order 9 Rule
13 CPC is barred by limitation. Rest of the
contents of the para under reply are a matter of
record. It is however wrong and denied that the
date of knowledge is wrongly given by the
defendant. It is further wrong and denied that
the defendant had been duly served in the
above noted suit or the signatures on the AD
card have not been manipulated.
The
proceedings before the Hon'ble High Court at
Lucknow, are a matter of record. It is however
wrong and denied that the defendant had
acquired the knowledge about the present
decree, through the counter affidavit. It is
submitted that the matter had been disposed off
on 15.12.2003 itself, when the application for
taking on record the counter affidavit had been
filed on behalf of the plaintiff and the same did
not come to the knowledge of the defendant, at
all. It is wrong and denied that the defendant
had come to know about the proceedings on
15.12.2003, as alleged.”
10.

Faced with the situation of their being no specific

denial to the categorical plea taken in the reply that the
counter affidavit was supplied to the appellant's counsel, it is
to be noted that in the rejoinder there is no denial of the fact
that the counsel received the counter affidavit.
11.

However learned counsel for the appellant urges

that an affidavit of the clerk of the counsel concerned has been

FAO.No.211/05

page 5 of 7

filed to the effect that counter affidavit was not received by the
counsel.
12.

It is trite that what you prove is controlled by what

you plead. It becomes important to have a 360° vision while
pleading. In the absence of any pleading by the appellant that
the copy of the counter affidavit filed before the Lucknow
Bench of the Allahabad High Court was not supplied to his
counsel, I am afraid no evidence pertaining thereto can be
looked into by this court.
13.

Be that as it may order dated 15.12.2003 passed by

the learned Single Judge of the Lucknow Bench of the
Allahabad High Court, in the very first line records:“Counter affidavit filed in the court today be kept on record.”
14.

When

questioned

as

to

when

appellant

got

knowledge of the order dated 15.12.2003, the counsel
responds, probably within a week or 10 days.

When

questioned as to what did the appellant do when he read in the
order dated 15.12.2003 that a counter affidavit has been filed
in court today and why did he not seek a copy from the
counsel concerned, learned counsel for the appellant concedes
that the appellant remained negligent in not requiring his
counsel to transmit to him the counter affidavit filed in the
Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court.
FAO.No.211/05

15.

Under the circumstances, I find no infirmity in the

view taken by the learned Judge that the evidence probablises
prior knowledge with the appellant of the decree through the
medium of the counter affidavit filed by the respondent in
Arbitration Petition No.16/2002.
16.

Needless to state, sitting in the first appeal,

pertaining to findings of fact, if the view taken by the learned
Trial Judge on the given evidence is a probable view this Court
would not be justified in substituting the view merely because
another view is possible.
17.

The appeal is dismissed.

18.

No costs.
