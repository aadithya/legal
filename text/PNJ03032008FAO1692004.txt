PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

The above captioned appeals raise similar issues

and lay a challenge to 2 identically worded orders dated
22.5.2004 passed in Suit No.397/2003 and 371/2003.
FAO No.169/04

page 1 of 6

2.

M/s.Mittal Hardware Store is the plaintiff in Suit

No.371/2003. Gyanendra Singh & Ors. are the plaintiffs in Suit
No.397/2003.
3.

The plaintiffs of the suit are aggrieved by the fact

that their applications under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC
praying for an interim injunction pending disposal of the suit
have been dismissed.
4.

M/s.Mittal Hardware Store claims to have taken a

shop on rent from late Chaudhary Hari Ram, father of
Gyanender Singh.
5.

Said plaintiff as also Gyanender Singh & Ors. allege

that the shop on rent with M/s.Mittal Hardware Stores and an
adjoining shop in possession of Gyanender Singh & Ors. is
constructed on Khasra No.637/350 (Min.) Village Kotla Mubarak
Pur. That the land was inherited through their ancestors. That
a house and shops were built on the land over 60 years back.
It was alleged that there was a threat of demolition.

Suits

sought injunction against the defendants restraining the
defendants from demolishing the shops and interfering with
the possession of the plaintiff.
6.

In the written statement filed by the defendants it is

pleaded that the shops are comprised in Khasra No.636/350.
That as per revenue record said land comprised in Khasra
FAO No.169/04

page 2 of 6

No.636/350 was entered in the name of Deputy Commissioner,
Delhi and was shown as Patwar-Ghar.
7.

With reference to the revenue record the learned

Trial Judge held that land comprised in Khasra No.636/350
Village Kotla Mubarak Pur, Delhi did not belong to the
ancestors of Gyanender Singh & Ors.

Thus, injunction was

declined.
8.

In the instant appeals taking note of the fact that

the real issue between the parties was whether at site, the 2
shops

were

constructed

on

land

comprised

in

Khasra

No.637/350 (Min.) as alleged by the plaintiffs or the shops were
on land comprising Khasra No.636/350 (Min.) and that said
issue was not decided by the learned Trial Judge, notice was
issued in the appeals and interim stay was granted.
9.

On 28.5.2004 an interim order was passed in CM

No.7215/2004 in FAO No.276/2004. The interim order reads as
under:“CM No.7215/2004 (Stay)
Notice for the date fixed.
Until further orders, the shop bearing
No.D-8/1(1539)
Gurudwara
Road,
Kotla
Mubarak Pur, New Delhi situated in Khasra
No.637/350 (Min.) Village Kotla Mubarak Pur,
New Delhi be not demolished. However, the
respondents are free to take action in respect
of the shop to the extent it encroaches upon
FAO No.169/04

page 3 of 6

Khasra No.636/350 (Min.) Village Kotla Mubarak
Pur, New Delhi.
Needless to say that the demolition
in Khasra No.636/350 (Min.) Village Kotla
Mubarak Pur, New Delh be carried out only on
proper demarcation.
The matter is said to be listed before
the learned Trial Judge on 12th July, 2004. The
learned Trial Judge will give a date for
demarcation on that date so that the entire
controversy is sorted out.

Indeed, if the shops were constructed on land

comprised in Khasra No.637/350 (Min.) Village Kotla Mubarak
Pur the same could not be demolished, but, if the shops were
an encroachment on Khasra No.636/350 (Min.) Village Kotla
Mubarak Pur, appellants would have no prima facie case.
11.

I am informed that pursuant to the order dated

28.5.2004 necessary directions were issued by the learned
Trial Judge requiring demarcation to be effected and that on
25.9.2004 demarcation has been effected.
12.

As per demarcation report it has been found that

there is an encroachment measuring 8' 9” x 33' 0”on Khasra
No.636/350.
13.

Whether the encroachment spans one shop or both

FAO No.169/04

page 4 of 6

shops has not been brought out in the demarcation report.
14.

It was urged by learned counsel for the appellant

that they have filed objections to the demarcation report.
15.

I am a little surprised that the objections filed to the

demarcation report have not been decided for nearly 3 years.
16.

In my opinion, considering the controversy between

the parties as also the interim order dated 28.5.2004 (noted
herein above) the appeals are liable to be disposed of directing
that the learned Trial Judge would decide the objections to the
demarcation report within 2 months from the date of the
receipt of the present order.
17.

Further, only if the 2 shops are prima facie found to

be existing on land comprised in Khasra No.637/350 would an
injunction operate in favour of the appellants and against the
respondents restraining the respondents from demolishing the
shops till the decision of the suit. If, however, it is prima facie
found that the shop(s) or part thereof is an encroachment to
the extent of encroachment no injunction shall operate.
18.

Before concluding I may note that in effect the 2

suits can be disposed of on the demarcation report for the
reason this would be the only evidence on which final decision
has to be based.
19.

The learned Trial Judge would consider disposing of

FAO No.169/04

page 5 of 6

the 2 suits in light of the decision on the application raising an
objection to the demarcation report dated 25.9.2004.
20.

No costs.

21.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned

counsel for the parties on payment of usual charges.
