basis of a report by the police officer concerned a
case FIR No.33/2006 under Section 308 IPC was
registered.

Pursuant to registration of FIR

another police officer, who was entrusted with
investigation, went to the hospital where he met
another injured namely Jitender Kumar Shokeen.
He recorded his statement. Injured Jitender
Kumar Shokeen was one of the students

him as well as one Prashant, he and Prashant
had won the election while the petitioner, who
was one

of the rival candidates,

had lost.

Jitender Kumar Shokeen and Prashant belonged
to a group of students known as Najafgarh group
while

the petitioner

called as

was from another group

Bharthal group.

On account of

his

defeat in the election, it is alleged, the petitioner
and his

associated with Bharthal

had turned hostile to

Shokeen and his supporters of Najafgarh group.

On 12th January, 2006 a quarrel took
place between some of the students belonging to
the said groups which

aggravated the hostility

between the two groups.

On 17th January, 2006 at about 1.00 p.m.
while

in front of the college

They were armed with Dandas and Balli
Evincing their aggressive posture, all of

them rushed inside the

college gate declaring

that the Najafgarh group was to be eliminated.
The petitioner and his co-accused Karambir
caught hold of Jitender Kumar Shokeen at the
exhortation of other members of Bharthal group
and their co-accused Subhash inflicted a Danda
blow on Jitender Kumar Shokeen which landed
on left side of his body near waist region.
Jitender Kumar Shokeen was somehow able to
free himself from the hold of the petitioner and
his co-accused and succeeded in running away
from there. Apprehending attack other members
of the Najafgarh group also started running away

took

shelter in a room for photocopying while others
of his group in a pump house. However, Som
Veer, deceased, who was

still running away

towards college ground, was chased by the
petitioner and

his co-accused

and eventually

surrounded by them. On instigation of their coaccused,

Karambir, co-

accused inflicted a heavy Danda/Balli blow on
the head of Som Veer. As a result of Danda blow
while Som Veer was falling down, the petitioner
also inflicted another Danda blow on his person
followed by a further Danda blow by co-accused
Ravinder after Som Veer had fallen to the ground.
The petitioner and his co-accused then left the
spot but not before
BAIL APPLN.71/2007

ascertaining that Som Veer
Page 5 of 13

was dead. Som Veer later,

succumbed to

his

head injury at Safdarjung Hospital.
5.

Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner
argued that the fatal blow on the head of Som
Veer deceased was allegedly caused by coaccused Karambir and the petitioner had simply
caught hold of the deceased while his co-accused
Karambir inflicted fatal blow on his head.

He

contended that the Danda blow allegedly inflicted
by the petitioner while the deceased was in the
process of falling to the ground after sustaining
head injury, did not

account for death of Som

Veer. In the facts and circumstances of the case,
argued the learned Senior counsel, the petitioner
cannot be held liable

for committing murder of

Som Veer with the aid of Section 34 IPC. He in
support of his

plea

sought to rely upon two

decisions of the Supreme Court in Tehal Singh &
Ors. Vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1979 SC 1347 and
Ramashish Yadav & Ors. Vs. State of Bihar; 1999
BAIL APPLN.71/2007

(2) JCC (SC) 471.

Another argument was that

the petitioner being a student of the college his
presence within the precincts of his college could
not be taken to make him a member of alleged
unlawful assembly.

He

contended that it were

rather the deceased and others, who

were

outsiders being not the students of the college.
The learned Senior counsel for the petitioner
pointed out that co-accused Pradeep Kumar
facing

more or less

similar allegations

has

already been granted bail by this court vide order
dated 14th November, 2006 while two other coaccused namely Ravinder and Yogesh have been
granted bail by the trial court.

It was pleaded

that the investigation has been completed

and

charge sheet is already filed and thus further
custody of the petitioner is no longer required.

It

was submitted that the petitioner being a 20 year
old young man and a student of BA (IInd year)
deserves to be released on bail.

On behalf of the State, opposing the bail
application, it was contended by learned Addl.
P.P. that from the facts of the case as also the
statements of the witnesses, the
one of those who had played
commission of crimes

petitioner was

an active role in

complained of.

It was

contended that even if the petitioner is shown to
have had not inflicted the fatal blow on the head
of the deceased Som Veer, he would still be
equally liable for committing his murder as he
shared common

intention

with his co-accused

Karambir and others to kill Som Veer. To lend
assurance to his plea in this regard learned Addl.
P.P. referred to decisions of the Supreme Court
in Lalai @ Dindoo & Anr. Vs. State of U.P.; AIR
1974 SC 2118, Krishnan & Anr. Vs. State Rep.
by Inspector of Police; 2003 Crl.L.J. 3705 and

In the context of

bail order dated 14th

January, 2006 of this court
accused Pradeep Kumar,
pointed out that

in respect of colearned Addl. P.P.

he was granted

that no specific role

bail noticing

had been ascribed to him

which could be said to have accounted for Som
Veer's death and that the only allegation was of
general exhortation by the group in common. He
contended that the role of the petitioner being
much different from his co-accused Pradeep he
cannot plead for bail on parity. It was pointed
out by learned Addl. P.P. that after commission of
crime

the

petitioner

evaded

his

arrest

and

remained absconding before he was eventually
arrested on 10th March, 2006 on proceedings
under Section 82 Cr.P.C. being initiated against
him. Looking at his past conduct, it was argued,
BAIL APPLN.71/2007

Page 9 of 13

in case of his release on bail there is reasonable
apprehension of his not making himself available
for trial, apart from his trying to tamper with
evidence by pressurizing and influencing the eye
witnesses.
8.

It is noticed that though the charge sheet
appears

to

have

been

filed

under

308/302/147/148/149/506/120-B

Sections

IPC,

the

learned Trial Court vide its order dated 30th
March, 2007 found the

petitioner and

his co-

accused liable to be charged under Sections
148/323/34 IPC and 302/34 IPC only.

The

learned Trial Judge while directing the charges to
be framed, as aforesaid, held that Section 149 IPC
was not attracted to the case and it was rather
Section 34 IPC which was applicable. Whether in
the facts and circumstances of the case and the
evidence collected during the investigation, the
said offences were committed by the petitioner
and

his co-accused in prosecution of common

of common intention, in view of

Ravinder and

Yogesh appear to have been

granted bail keeping in view that no specific role
was ascribed to them in the commission of crime
and there was only an allegation of general
exhortation by them to kill Som Veer.

The role

played by the petitioner is clearly distinguishable
and

thus his plea for bail on parity cannot be

granted. Further, as pointed out by learned Addl.
P.P., the petitioner remained

absconding for

about three months after commission of crime
and could be arrested only on proceedings under
Section 82 Cr.P.C. being initiated against him.
Such a conduct on his part

raises reasonable

apprehension that in case of his release on bail

This apart, the

keeping in view the gravity of offence allegedly
committed by him and his co-accused.

Thus finding no good ground for bail, the

petition is dismissed.
